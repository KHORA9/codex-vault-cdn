S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI would explain the real causes and greater consequences of the bloody\r\nbrothers' war. I pray that all of us be delivered, as far as may be, from\r\nbias and prejudice. The return of old affection between the sections\r\nshowed gracious beginning in the centennial year. In the war with Spain\r\nsoutherners rallied to the stars and stripes as enthusiastically as\r\nnortherners. Reconcilement has accelerated its pace every hour since. But\r\nit is not yet complete. The south has these things to learn:\r\n\r\n1. A providence, protecting the American union, hallucinated Garrison,\r\nWendell Phillips, Mrs. Stowe, Sumner, and other radical abolitionists, as\r\nto the negro and the effect of southern slavery upon him, its purpose\r\nbeing to destroy slavery because it was the _sine qua non_ of southern\r\nnationalization, the only serious menace ever made to that union. This\r\nnationalization was stirring strongly before the federal constitution was\r\nadopted. The abolitionists, as is the case with all forerunners of great\r\noccurrences, were trained and educated by the powers directing evolution,\r\nand they were constrained to do not their own will but that of these\r\nmighty powers.\r\n\r\n2. The cruel cotton tax; the constitution amended to prevent repentance of\r\nuncompensated emancipation, which is the greatest confiscation on record;\r\nthe resolute effort to put the southern whites under the negroes; and\r\nother such measures; were but natural outcome of the frenzied\r\nintersectional struggle of twenty-five years and the resulting terrible\r\nwar. Had there been another event, who can be sure that the south would\r\nnot have committed misdeeds of vengeance against citizens of the north?\r\n\r\n3. We of the south ought to tolerate the freest discussion of every phase\r\nof the race question. We should ungrudgingly recognize that the difference\r\nof the northern masses from us in opinion is natural and honest. Let us\r\nhear their expressions with civility, and then without warmth and show of\r\ndisrespect give the reasons for our contrary faith. This is the only way\r\nfor us to get what we need so much, that is, audience from our brothers\r\nacross the line. Consider some great southerners who have handled most\r\nexciting sectional themes without giving offence. There is no invective in\r\nCalhoun's speech, of March 4, 1850, though he clearly discerned that\r\nabolition was forcing the south into revolution. Stephens, who had been\r\nvice-president of the Confederate States, reviewed in detail soon after\r\nthe brothers' war the conflict of opinion which caused it, and yet in his\r\ntwo large volumes he spoke not a word of rancor. When congress was doing\r\nmemorial honor to Charles Sumner, it was Lamar, a southerner of\r\nsoutherners, that made the most touching panegyric of the dead. And the\r\nother day was Dixon's masterly effort to prove that the real, even if\r\nunconscious, purpose of the training at Tuskegee is ultimately to promote\r\nfusion, which the southern whites deem the greatest of evils. His language\r\nis entirely free from passion or asperity. He wonders in admiration at the\r\nmarvellous rise of Booker Washington from lowest estate to unique\r\ngreatness. And he gives genuine sympathy to Professor DuBois, in whose\r\nbook, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" as he says, \"for the first time we see\r\nthe naked soul of a negro beating itself to death against the bars in\r\nwhich Aryan society has caged him.\"\r\n\r\nThese examples of Calhoun, Stephens, Lamar, and Dixon should be the\r\nemulation of every southerner speaking to the nation upon any subject that\r\ndivides north and south. This done, we will get the audience we seek. It\r\nwas this which not long ago gave Clark Howell's strong paper opposing\r\nnegro appointments to office in the south prominent place in _Collier's_,\r\nand which last month obtained for Dixon's article just mentioned the first\r\npages of the _Saturday Evening Post_. When we get full audience, other\r\nsuch discussions as those of Howell and Dixon, and that in which Tom\r\nWatson, in the June number of his magazine, showed Dr. Booker Washington a\r\nthing or two, will be digested by the northern public, to the great\r\nadvantage of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe last I have to say here is as to differing opinions upon social\r\nrecognition of prominent negroes. We of the south give them great honor\r\nand respect. Could not Mr. Roosevelt have said to us of Georgia protesting\r\nagainst his entertainment of Booker Washington, \"Have I done worse than\r\nyou did when you had him to make that address at the opening of your\r\nExposition in 1895, and applauded it to the echo?\" Suppose, as is true,\r\nthat hardly a man in the south would eat at the same table with Dr.\r\nWashington or Professor DuBois, how can that justify us in heaping\r\nopprobrium upon a northern man who does otherwise because he has been\r\ntaught to believe it right? What has been said in denunciation of the\r\npresident and Mr. Wanamaker for their conduct towards Booker Washington\r\nseems to me rather a hullabaloo of antediluvian moss-backs than the voice\r\nof the best and wisest southerners.\r\n\r\nAmid all her gettings let the south get complete calmness upon everything\r\nconnected with the race question--complete deliverance from morbid\r\nsensitiveness and intemperate speech in its discussion.\r\n\r\nNow here is what the north should learn:\r\n\r\n1. Slavery in America was the greatest benefit that any large part of the\r\nnegro race ever received; and sudden and unqualified emancipation was woe\r\ninexpressible to nearly all the freedmen. The counter doctrine of the\r\nabolitionists who taught that the negro is equal to the Caucasian worked\r\nbeneficently to save the union, but it ought now to be rejected by all who\r\nwould understand him well enough to give him the best possible\r\ndevelopment. The fifteenth amendment was a stupendous blunder. It took for\r\ngranted that the southern negroes were as ready for the ballot as the\r\nwhites. The fact is that they were as a race in a far lower stage of\r\nevolution. Consider the collective achievement of this race, not in savage\r\nWest Africa, but where it has been long in contact with civilization, in\r\nHayti, and the south. Hayti has been independent for more than a hundred\r\nyears. \"Sir Spencer St. John ... formerly British Minister Resident in\r\nHayti, after personally knowing the country for over twenty years, claims\r\nthat it is ... in rapid decadence, and regards the political future of the\r\nHaytians as utterly hopeless. At the termination of his service on the\r\nisland, he said: 'I now quite agree with those who deny that the negro can\r\never originate a civilization, and who assert that with the best of\r\neducations he remains an inferior type of man.'\r\n\r\n\"According to Sir Spencer, Hayti is sunk in misery, bloodshed,\r\ncannibalism, and superstition of the most sensual and degrading character.\r\nEver since the republic has been established Haytians have been opposed to\r\nprogress, but of recent years retrogression has been particularly\r\nrapid.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn the south, where reversion to West African society has been checked by\r\nwhite government, this is a full catalogue of the main institutions\r\nevolved by the freedmen. They have provided themselves with cheaply built\r\nchurches, in which their frequent and long worship is mainly sound and\r\nfury. In the pinch of crop cultivation or gathering they flock away from\r\nthe fields to excursion trains and \"protracted meetings.\" Perhaps their\r\nmost noticeable institutions are \"societies,\" some prohibiting hiring as\r\ndomestic servants, except where subsistence cannot otherwise be had, and\r\nothers providing the means of decent burial. Compare these feeble negro\r\nrace performances with such white institutions, made in the same territory\r\nand at the same time, as Memorial Day, which the north has adopted; the Ku\r\nKlux Klan; enactment of stock laws when the freedmen's refusal to split\r\nrails made much fencing impossible; and the white primary.\r\n\r\nInstitutions--what I have just called the collective achievement of a\r\nrace--mark in their character its capacity for improvement, and also its\r\nplane of development. When the negro, with his self-evolved institutions,\r\nis compared with the race which has furnished itself with fit organs of\r\nself-government all the way up from town-meeting to federal constitution,\r\nand is now about to crown its grand work with direct legislation, it is\r\nlike comparing the camel dressed to counterfeit an elephant, of which dear\r\nold Peter Parley told us in his school history, with a real elephant, or\r\ntrying to make a confederate dollar in an administrator's return of 1864\r\ncount as a gold one.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the negro, Professor Kelly Miller, replying to Tom Watson, assumes\r\nthat Franks, Britons, Germans, Russians, and Aztecs have severally been in\r\nhistorical times as incapable as West Africans of rising from savagery and\r\ncrossing barbarism into civilization. He outdoes even this--he would have\r\nit believed that Hayti is now a close second behind Japan in striding\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSurely the good people of the north ought to learn the difference between\r\nthe negro race and the white. There is a small class of exceptional\r\nnegroes which is assumed by a great many at the north to be most fair\r\nsamples of the average negro of the south. Dr. Washington and Professor\r\nDuBois severally lead the opposing sections of this class. It consists of\r\nauthors, editors, preachers, speakers, some who with small capital in\r\nbanking, farming, and other business, have each by Booker Washington's\r\nblazon been exalted into a national celebrity, and others. Its\r\nnever-sleeping resolve, fondly cherished by the greater part, is to \"break\r\ninto\" white society and some day fuse with it. Its members are nearly all\r\nat least half white, and many are more than half white. But when a Bourbon\r\nsnub to one of them is received, as it often is, with dignity and proper\r\nbehavior, Mr. Louis F. Post, and a few more, exclaim to the country, \"See\r\nhow this coal-black and pure negro excels his would-be superiors!\" This\r\nman, almost white, is to them a coal-black, genuine, unmixed negro. Ought\r\nnot attention to facts incontrovertibly cardinal to rule here as\r\neverywhere else? To what is due the great accomplishment of Dumas,\r\nDouglass, and Booker Washington--to their negro blood or to their white\r\nblood? If half negro blood can do so well, why is it that pure negro blood\r\ndoes not do far better?\r\n\r\nI have seen it asserted that Professor Kelly Miller is pure negro. His\r\nhead has the shape of a white man's. The greyhound crossed once with the\r\nbull-dog, as Youatt tells, and each succeeding generation of offspring\r\nrecrossed with pure greyhound until not a suggestion of bull-dog was\r\nvisible, occurs to me. Thus there was bred a greyhound, possessing the\r\ndesired trait of the bull-dog. Who can say that there is not among the\r\nprofessor's American ancestors one of half white blood? If there is in\r\nfact no such, he is, in his high attainment, almost a _lusus naturae_.\r\n\r\nThe north, by due attention, will discern that the small number\r\nconstituting what I provisionally name the upper class of negroes, is\r\nhardly involved in the race question.\r\n\r\nThe negroes in the south outside of the upper class--the latter not\r\namounting to more than five percent of the entire black population--are\r\nslowly falling away from the benign elevation above West Africa wrought by\r\nslavery. That they are here, is felt every year to be more injurious. They\r\ngreatly retard the evolution of a white-labor class, which has become the\r\nhead-spring of all social amelioration in enlightened communities. There\r\nappears to be but one salvation for them if they stay, which is fusion\r\nwith the whites. Though Herbert Foster, and a few others, confidently\r\nassume that our weakening Caucasian strain would be bettered by infusion\r\nof African blood, we see that while amalgamation would bless the negro it\r\nwould incalculably injure us. It would be stagnation and blight for\r\ncenturies, not only to the south but to the north also. Northerners are\r\nmore and more attracted to the south by climate and other advantages, and\r\nintermarriage between the natives of each section increases all the while.\r\nThe powers, protecting America, inscrutably to contemporaries kept busy\r\ncertain agencies that saved the union. It seems to me that these same\r\npowers are now in both sections increasing white hostility to the blacks,\r\nof purpose to prevent their getting firm foothold and becoming desirable\r\nin marriage to poorer whites. One will think at once of the frequent\r\nlynchings in the south. But let him also think of how the strikers in\r\nChicago were moved to far greater passion by the few black than the many\r\nwhite strike-breakers, the late inexplicable anti-negro riot in New York\r\nCity, and the negro church dynamited the other day in Carlisle, Indiana.\r\nThese powers, who have protected our country from the first settlement of\r\nthe English upon the Atlantic coast down to the present time, appear to\r\nspeak more plainly every day the fiat, \"If Black and White are not\r\nseparated, Black shall perish utterly.\" I am convinced that at the close\r\nof the century, if this separation has not been made long before,\r\nProfessor Willcox's apparently conservative estimate of what will then be\r\ntheir numbers will prove to be gross exaggeration. In my judgment he comes\r\nfar short of allowing the anti-fusion forces their full destructiveness.\r\n\r\nLet the north purge itself from all delusion as to the negro, and help the\r\nsouth do him justice and loving kindness, by transplanting him into\r\nfavorable environment.\r\n\r\n2. It is high time that the Ku Klux be understood. When in 1867 it was\r\nstrenuously attempted to give rule to scalawags and negroes, the very best\r\nof the south led the unanimous revolt. Their first taste of political\r\npower incited the negroes to license and riot imperilling every condition\r\nof decent life. In the twinkling of an eye the Ku Klux organized. It\r\nmustered, not assassins, thugs, and cutthroats, as has been often alleged,\r\nbut the choicest southern manhood. Every good woman knew that the order\r\nwas now the solitary defence of her purity, and she consecrated it with\r\nall-availing prayers. In Georgia we won the election of December, 1870, in\r\nthe teeth of gigantic odds. This decisive deliverance from the most\r\nmonstrous and horrible misrule recorded among Anglo-Saxons was the\r\nachievement of the Ku Klux. Its high mission performed, the Klan, burning\r\nits disguises, ritual, and other belongings, disbanded two or three months\r\nlater. Its reputation is not to be sullied by what masked men--bogus Ku\r\nKlux, as we, the genuine, called them--did afterwards. The exalted\r\nglorification of Dixon is not all of the Klan's desert. It becomes dearer\r\nin memory every year. I shall always remember with pride my service in the\r\nfamous 8th Georgia Volunteers. I was with it in the bloody pine thicket at\r\nFirst Manassas, where it outfought four times its own number; at\r\nGettysburg, where, although thirty-two out of its thirty-six officers were\r\nkilled or wounded, there was no wavering; and in many other perilous\r\nplaces, the last being Farmville, two days before Appomattox, where this\r\nregiment and its sworn brother, the 7th Georgia, of Anderson's brigade,\r\ncoming up on the run, grappled hand-to-hand with a superior force pushing\r\nback Mahone, and won the field. But I am prouder of my career in the Ku\r\nKlux Klan. The part of it under my command rescued Oglethorpe county, in\r\nwhich the negroes had some thousand majority, at the presidential election\r\nof 1868,--the very first opportunity,--and held what had been the home of\r\nWilliam H. Crawford, George R. Gilmer, and Joseph H. Lumpkin, until\r\npermanent victory perched upon the banners of the white race in Georgia.\r\n\r\n3. I observe that the north begins in some sort the learning of the two\r\nlessons above mentioned. But now comes one which seems hard indeed.\r\nCalhoun, Toombs, Davis, and the other pro-slavery leaders, ought to be\r\nthoroughly studied and impartially estimated. They were not agitators, nor\r\nfactionists, nor conspirators. They were the extreme of conservatism.\r\nTheir conscientious faithfulness to country has never been surpassed.\r\nTheir country was the south, whose meat and bread depended upon slavery.\r\nThe man whose sight can pierce the heavy mists of the slavery struggle\r\nstill so dense cannot find in the world record of glorious stands for\r\ncountries doomed by fate superiors in moral worth and great exploit. In\r\ntheir careers are all the comfort, dignity, and beauty of life, supreme\r\nvirtue, and happiness of that old south, inexpressibly fair, sweet and\r\ndear to us who lived in it; and in these careers are also all the varied\r\ndetails of its inexpressibly pathetic ruin. What is higher humanity than\r\nto grieve with those who grieve? Brothers and sisters of the north, you\r\nwill never find your higher selves until you fitly admire the titanic\r\nfight which these champions made for their sacred cause, and drop genuine\r\ntears over their heart-breaking failure.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing summarizes the larger obstacles which bar true sight of the\r\nsouth and the north. The devastation attending Sherman's march beyond\r\nAtlanta, the alleged inhumanity at Andersonville, and many other things\r\nthat were bitterly complained of during the brothers' war, and afterwards,\r\nby one side or the other, seem to me almost forgotten and forgiven.\r\nBrothers who wore the gray with me, brothers who wore the blue against me,\r\nI would have all of you freed from the delusions which still keep you from\r\nthat perfect love which Webster, Lincoln, and Stephens gave south and\r\nnorth alike. I am sure that you must make the corrections indicated above\r\nbefore you can rightly begin the all-important subject of this book. With\r\nthis admonition I commit you to the opening chapter, which I hope you will\r\nfind to be a fit introduction.\r\n\r\nJOHN C.

Such homogeneousness, as has long been recognized, works\r\npowerfully for the political coalescence of separate communities. With the\r\nadjacent ones of the colonies just mentioned there has always been trend\r\nto such coalescence, as is impressively illustrated by the recent\r\nestablishment of the Australian Federation. The thirteen colonies out of\r\nwhich the United States developed were likewise English, and there was the\r\nsame homogeneousness in their population, which made in due time, and also\r\nmaintained for a few generations, a union of them all--a continental\r\nunion. But there had crept in a heterogeneity, overlooked for many years,\r\nduring which time it acquired such force that it at last overcame the\r\nhomogeneousness just emphasized and carried a part of the inhabitants of\r\nthe United States out of the continental union. African slavery dying out\r\nin the north, but prospering in the south, was this heterogeneity. By a\r\nmost natural course the south grew into a nation--the Confederate\r\nStates--whose end and purpose was to protect slavery, which had become\r\nits fundamental economical interest, against the north standing by the\r\noriginal union, and which having gained control of the federal government\r\nwas about to use its powers to extirpate slavery. The continental or\r\nPan-American nation--the American union, as we most generally think of\r\nit--could not brook dismemberment, nor tolerate a continental rival, and\r\nconsequently it warred upon and denationalized the Confederate States. The\r\nlast two sentences tell how the brothers' war was caused, what was its\r\nstake on each side, and the true result. This compendious summary is to\r\nserve as a proposition, the proof of which we now purpose to outline.\r\n\r\nOur first step is to emphasize how the free-labor system which prevailed\r\nin the north, and the slave-labor system which prevailed in the south,\r\nwere utterly incompatible. Free labor is far cheaper and more efficient\r\nthan slave labor. It had consequently superseded slavery in the entire\r\nenlightened world. But certain exceptional peculiarities of climate, soil,\r\nand products planted made slavery profitable in the south.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the market value of the slaves two things were needed: (1) the\r\ncompetition of free labor and the import of cheap slaves must be\r\nrigorously prevented; (2) a vast reserve of virgin soil, both to replace\r\nthe plantations rapidly wearing out and to afford more land for the\r\nmultiplying slaves. The fact last mentioned made it vital to the south to\r\nappropriate such parts of the soil of the Territories as suited her cotton\r\nand other staples. Therefore whenever she made such an appropriation she\r\nturned it into a slave State; for thus the competition of free labor would\r\nbe effectually excluded therefrom. The much more rapid increase of her\r\npopulation made appropriation of lands in the Territories likewise vital\r\nto the north. Hers were all free-labor interests, as the south's were all\r\nslave-labor interests; and whenever the former appropriated any of the\r\nTerritories, she made a State prohibiting slavery in order to protect her\r\nfree-labor interests. The north was not excluded by nature from any part\r\nof the public domain as the other section was. Her free labor could be\r\nmade productive everywhere in it, and she really needed the whole.\r\n\r\nThus the brothers of the north and the brothers of the south commenced to\r\nstrive with one another over dividing their great inheritance. The former\r\nwanted lands for themselves, their sons, and daughters in all the\r\nTerritories possible made into States protecting their free-labor system;\r\nthe latter wanted all of the Territories suiting them made into States\r\nprotecting their slave-labor system. What ought especially to be\r\nrecognized by us now is that this contention was between good, honest,\r\nindustrious, plain, free-labor people on one side, and good, honest,\r\nindustrious, plain, slave-labor people on the other, those on each side\r\ndoing their best, as is the most common thing in the world, to gain and\r\nkeep the advantage of those of the other. It was natural, it was right, it\r\nwas most laudable that every householder, whether northerner or\r\nsoutherner, should do his utmost to get free land for himself and family.\r\nThis fact--which is really the central, foundation, and cardinal one of\r\nall the facts which brought the brothers' war--must be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, otherwise the longer one contemplates this exciting theme the\r\nfurther astray from fact and reasonableness he gets.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing shows in brief how there came an eager contention for the\r\npublic lands between parents, capitalists, workers, employers,\r\nmanufacturers, and so forth, bred to free labor and hostile to slavery on\r\nthe one side--that is, in the northern States; and the same classes bred\r\nto slavery and hostile to free labor on the other side--that is, in the\r\nsouthern States. The contention grew to a grapple. As this waxed hotter\r\nthe combating brothers became more and more angry, called one another\r\nnames more and more opprobrious; and at last each side, in the height of\r\nrighteous indignation, denounced their opponents as enemies of country,\r\nmorality, and religion. Here the root-and-branch abolitionist and the\r\nfire-eater begin their several careers, and get more and more excited\r\naudience, the former in the north and the other in the south. Both were\r\nemissaries of the fates who had decreed that there must be a brothers'\r\nwar, to the end that slavery, the only peril to the American union, be\r\ncast out.\r\n\r\nUnder the necessity of defending slavery against free labor there came\r\nearly an involuntary concretion of the southern States. This was very\r\nplainly discernible when the epoch-making convention was in session. It\r\nwas the beginning of a process which has been well-named nation-making.\r\nAfter a while--say just before Toombs takes the southern lead from\r\nCalhoun--it had developed, as we can now see, from concretion into\r\nnationalization--not nationality, yet--of the south. It was bound, if\r\nslavery was denied expansion over the suitable soil of the Territories and\r\nthe restoration of its runaways, to cause in the ripeness of time\r\nsecession and the founding of the Confederate States. But there was\r\nanother nationalization, older, of much deeper root and wider scope--what\r\nwe have already mentioned as the continental or Pan-American. Its origin\r\nwas in an involuntary concretion of all the colonies--both the northern\r\nand the southern--antedating the commencement of the southern concretion\r\nmentioned a moment ago. While southern nationalization was the guardian of\r\nthe social fabric, the property, the occupations, the means of subsistence\r\nof the southern people, the greater nationalization was not only the\r\nguardian of the same interests of the northern people, but it had a higher\r\noffice. This was in due time to give the whole continent everlasting\r\nimmunity from war and all its prospective, direct, and consequential\r\nevils, by federating its different States under one democratic\r\ngovernment--this higher office was to perpetuate the American union. This\r\ncontinental nationalization had probably ripened into at least the\r\ninchoate American nation by 1776. It was this nation, as I am confident\r\nthe historical evidence rightly read shows, that made the declaration of\r\nindependence and the articles of confederation, carried the Revolutionary\r\nwar on to the grandest success ever achieved for real democracy, and then\r\ndrafted and adopted the federal constitution. The constitution was not the\r\ncreator of this nation, as lawyers and lawyer-bred statesmen hold, but the\r\nunion and the constitution are both its creatures. This nation is\r\nconstantly evolving, and as it does it modifies and unmakes the\r\nconstitution and system of government of the United States, and the same\r\nof each State, as best suits itself. Why do we not trace our history from\r\nthe first colonial settlements down to the present, and learn that the\r\nnation develops in both substance and form, in territory, in aims and\r\npurposes, not under the leading hand of conventions, congress, president,\r\nState authority, of even the fully decisive conquest of seceding States by\r\nthe armies of the rest, but by the guidance of powers in the unseen, which\r\nwe generally think of as the laws of evolution? To illustrate: For some\r\ntime after I had got home from Appomattox I was disheartened, as many\r\nothers were, at the menace of centralization. A vision of Caleb Cushing's\r\nman on horseback--the coming American Caesar--seared my eyeballs for a few\r\nyears. But after the south had been actually reconstructed I was cheered\r\nto note that the evolutionary forces maintaining and developing local\r\nself-government were holding their own with those maintaining and\r\ndeveloping union. To-day, you see the people of different localities all\r\nover the north--in many cities, in a few States--driven forward by a power\r\nwhich they do not understand, in a struggle which will never end till they\r\nhave rescued their liberties from the party machine wielded everywhere by\r\nthe public-service corporations.\r\n\r\nTo resume what we were saying just before this short excursion. Of course\r\nwhen the drifting of the south toward secession became decided and strong,\r\nPan-American nationalization set all of its forces in opposing array. As\r\nsoon as the southern confederacy was a fact, the brothers' war began. I\r\nemphasize it specially here that this war was mortal rencounter between\r\ntwo different nations.\r\n\r\nThe successive stages by which her nationalization impelled the south to\r\nsecession are roughly these:\r\n\r\n1. The concretion mentioned above probably passes into the beginning of\r\nnationalization when the south was aroused by the resistance of the\r\nfree-labor States to the admission of Missouri as a slave State. With a\r\nmost rude shock of surprise she was made to contemplate secession.\r\nAlthough there was much angry discussion and the crisis was grave, you\r\nought to note that the root-and-branch abolitionist and fire-eater had not\r\ncome. That crisis over, which ended the first stage, there was apparently\r\nprofound peace between the free-labor communities and the slave-labor\r\ncommunities for some while.\r\n\r\n2. The south rises against the tariff which taxes, as she believes, her\r\nslave-grown staples for the profit of free-labor manufacturers. Here the\r\nnext stage begins. Perhaps the advent of nullification, proposed and\r\nadvocated by Calhoun as a union weapon with which a State might defend\r\nitself against federal aggression, signalizes this stage more than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n3. The second gives place to the third stage, when the congressional\r\ndebate over anti-slavery petitions opens. It is in this stage that the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist and the fire-eater begin their really\r\neffective careers. Opposition to the restoration of fugitive slaves was\r\nspreading through the north and steadily strengthening. It ought to be\r\nrealized by one who would understand these times that this actual\r\nencouragement of the slaves to escape was a direct attack upon slavery in\r\nthe southern States, becoming stronger and more formidable as the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists became more zealous and influential, and\r\nincreased in numbers, and the slaveholder was bound to recognize what it\r\nall portended to him. It was natural that when he had these\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists before himself in mind, he should say of\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n    \"The lands of the Territories suiting slave labor are much less in\r\n    area than the due of the south therein. She will soon need all these\r\n    lands, as the slaves are multiplying rapidly, and the virgin soil of\r\n    her older States is going fast. With an excess of slaves and a lack of\r\n    fit land soon to come, if we are barred from the Territories our\r\n    property must depreciate until it is utterly worthless. But these\r\n    abolitionists attempt a further injury. They instigate our slaves to\r\n    fly into the north, and then encourage the north not to give them up\r\n    when we reclaim them. They deny our property the expansion into what\r\n    is really our part of the Territories which it ought to have in order\r\n    to maintain its value; and further they try to steal as many of our\r\n    slaves from us in the States as they can.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the double peril, as it were, which gathered in full view against\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nI cannot emphasize it enough that the hot indignation of such as Garrison\r\nagainst slavery as a hideous wrong was not excited before the competition\r\nbetween north and south over the public lands had become eager and\r\nall-absorbing. It is nearly always the case that such excitement does not\r\nappear until long after an actual menace by a rival to the personal or\r\nselfish interest of another has shown itself. It is not until the menace\r\nbecomes serious that the latter wakes up to discover that the former is\r\nviolating some capital article of the decalogue. This was true of the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist. And his high-flown morality was made still\r\nmore Quixotic by his conscientiously assuming that the negro slave was in\r\nall respects just such a human being as his white master.\r\n\r\nThis third stage extends from about January, 1836, until the country was\r\nalarmed as never before by the controversy of 1849-50 over the admission\r\nof California, in southern latitude, with an anti-slavery constitution. At\r\nits end the southern leadership of Calhoun standing upon nullification, a\r\nremedy that contemplated remaining in the union, is displaced by that of\r\nToombs, who begins to feel strongly, if not to see clearly, that the south\r\ncannot preserve slavery in the union.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth stage begins with the compromise of 1850. Afterwards during\r\nthe same year was an occurrence which cannot be overrated in importance by\r\nthe student of these times. That was the consideration of the pending\r\nquestion in Georgia, and action upon it by a convention of delegates\r\nelected for that special purpose. The Georgia Platform, promulgated by\r\nthat convention, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"To the end that the position of this State may be clearly apprehended\r\n    by her confederates of the south and of the north, and that she may be\r\n    blameless of all future consequences, _Be it resolved by the people\r\n    of Georgia in convention assembled_, _First_, that we hold the\r\n    American union secondary in importance only to the rights and\r\n    principles it was designed to perpetuate. That past associations,\r\n    present fruition, and future prospects, will bind us to it so long as\r\n    it continues to be the safeguard of these rights and principles.\r\n\r\n    _Second._ That if the thirteen original parties to the compact,\r\n    bordering the Atlantic in a narrow belt, while their separate\r\n    interests were in embryo, their peculiar tendencies scarcely\r\n    developed, their Revolutionary trials and triumphs still green in\r\n    memory, found union impossible without compromise, the thirty-one of\r\n    this day may well yield somewhat in the conflict of opinion and\r\n    policy, to preserve that union which has extended the sway of\r\n    republican government over a vast wilderness to another ocean, and\r\n    proportionally advanced their civilization and national greatness.\r\n\r\n    _Third._ That in this spirit the State of Georgia has considered the\r\n    action of congress, embracing a series of measures for the admission\r\n    of California into the union, the organization of territorial\r\n    governments for Utah and New Mexico, the establishment of a boundary\r\n    between the latter and the State of Texas, the suppression of the\r\n    slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and the extradition of\r\n    fugitive slaves, and (connected with them) the rejection of\r\n    propositions to exclude slavery from the Mexican Territories, and to\r\n    abolish it in the District of Columbia; and, whilst she does not\r\n    wholly approve, will abide by it as a permanent adjustment of this\r\n    sectional controversy.\r\n\r\n    _Fourth._ That the State of Georgia, in the judgment of this\r\n    convention, will and ought to resist, even--as a last resort--to a\r\n    disruption of every tie which binds her to the union, any future act\r\n    of congress abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, without\r\n    the consent and petition of the slaveholders thereof, or any act\r\n    abolishing slavery in places within the slaveholding States, purchased\r\n    by the United States for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\r\n    dockyards, and other like purposes; or any act suppressing the\r\n    slave-trade between slaveholding States; or any refusal to admit as a\r\n    State any Territory applying, because of the existence of slavery\r\n    therein; or any act prohibiting the introduction of slaves into the\r\n    Territories of Utah and New Mexico; or any act repealing or materially\r\n    modifying the laws now in force for the recovery of fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\n    _Fifth._ That it is the deliberate opinion of this convention, that\r\n    upon the faithful execution of the fugitive slave bill by the proper\r\n    authorities depends the preservation of our much loved union.\"\r\n\r\nThis platform was the work of statesmen who had added to the wisdom of the\r\nfathers, making the declaration of independence, articles of\r\nconfederation, and the great constitution, worthy wisdom of their own from\r\na far more varied experience and better training in government. These\r\nstatesmen came indiscriminately from all parties. The people in the State,\r\nfrom the highest in authority through every intermediate circle down to\r\nthe humblest citizen, deliberately, without excitement or passion,\r\nendorsed this platform with practical unanimity. And all parties stood\r\nupon it to the end. This was not an ignorant, debased, corrupt,\r\nunrighteous people; but it was even better in everything that makes a\r\npeople great and good than the former generation which had given the\r\ncountry Washington and Jefferson.\r\n\r\nEspecially should the student meditate what this solemn declaration shows\r\nwas the sentiment of the people of the State at that time towards the\r\nAmerican union. Every one of the five planks contains its own most\r\nconvincing proof of deepest devotion. Think of the child who at last\r\nresolves to fly from the home which had been inexpressibly sweet until the\r\nstepmother came; of the father whose conscience commands him to save the\r\nmother's life by killing the assailing son; of what the true Othello felt\r\nwhen he had to execute the precious Desdemona for what he believed to be\r\nher falseness--think of these examples, if you would realize the agony of\r\nthe better classes of the southern people when they at last discovered\r\nthat the union had changed from being their best friend into their most\r\nfell enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia Platform was actually drafted, I believe, by A. H. Stephens,\r\nthen a whig. It was probably moulded in its substance--especially in the\r\nfourth and fifth planks--more by Toombs, also a whig, than any other.\r\nHowell Cobb, a democrat, approved, and was elected governor upon it the\r\nnext year, receiving the ardent support of Toombs and Stephens. Toombs was\r\njust forty, Stephens a year or two, and Cobb some six or seven years, less\r\nthan forty. These three were the leading authors. Note how much younger\r\nthey were than Calhoun, who had a few months before died in his\r\nsixty-ninth year. The platform indicates the new sentiment, not only of\r\nGeorgia but of the entire south. When its contents are compared with the\r\ndoctrine of nullification, it clearly shows as the production of a new era\r\nin the history of southern nationalization; for it marks what we may\r\nsomewhat metaphorically distinguish as the close of the pro-union and\r\nopening of the anti-union defence of slavery. The proclivity to secession\r\nuninterruptedly increases from this point on.\r\n\r\nI would have it noted that the tactics of this fourth stage are\r\nunaggressive. The Georgia Platform was no more than most grave and serious\r\nwarning against being driven to the wall. It did not bully nor hector. The\r\nthreat of what must be done in case certain menaced blows to slavery were\r\nstruck was so calmly, deprecatingly, and decorously made, that one wonders\r\nit was not heeded. He ceases to wonder only when history reveals to him\r\nthat fate had become adverse to the good cause of this noble people.\r\n\r\n5. A change of tactics characterizes the fifth stage. The faster growing\r\npopulation of the north, furnishing settlers in far greater number than\r\nthat of the south, was sweeping away all chance of new slave States. The\r\nsituation commanded that the defence of the south change to the\r\naggressive, just as Stoessel was constrained the other day to take the\r\noffensive against 203 Meter Hill. In the first sortie the south got the\r\nMissouri compromise repealed. Then she tried to make a slave State of\r\nKansas. She failed. When she had lost Kansas--like California in southern\r\nlatitude--she could not help recognizing that the outlook for slavery in\r\nthe union had become desperate. My northern countrymen, if you were as\r\nfree from the surviving influence of the old intersectional quarrel as we\r\nall ought to be, you would applaud the ability and valor with which the\r\nsouth had fought this losing fight for the welfare and comfort of her\r\npeople; and especially would you admire her supreme effort in behalf both\r\nof that people, and also of the union which she loved next to the cause of\r\nher people. Not quailing before odds incalculable, she was as brave and\r\nself-sustained as Miltiades, coming forth with his little ten thousand to\r\nfight the host of Mardonius hand-to-hand. The only thing for her now was\r\nnew aggression, to make a demand never seriously urged before. That was\r\nthat congress protect the master's property in every Territory until it\r\nbecame a State. If this were done, she could, perhaps, keep slavery in\r\nsome of the Territories long enough for it to strike root permanently. If\r\nit could not be done she must choose between her own cause and the union.\r\nHer persistence in the demand mentioned--and she was obliged to\r\npersist--split the democratic party, which had until this time been her\r\nmain upholder in the union. The north refused her demand by electing\r\nLincoln. This was the end of the fifth stage. Her nationality had become\r\nfully ripe. She seceded into the Confederate States, her only opportunity\r\nof conserving the property and occupation interests of her people. Of\r\ncourse she expected to get her part of the public domain, and to enforce\r\nextradition of her fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is the barest outline of the rise and conflict between the\r\ntwo nationalizations. The subject has been neglected too long. There\r\nbegins to be some faint understanding of the greater nationalization, but\r\nthat understanding is far short of completeness. There is hardly a\r\nsuspicion of the other. And yet as to our own special subject it is really\r\nthe more important, for in it is the initiative of the brothers' war.\r\nThere has been made by nobody any investigation at all of the main parts\r\nof that train of events which I designate as southern nationalization. Not\r\nWilson's \"The Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in the United States,\" nor\r\nany book by a partisan of either side in the struggle, gives any help\r\ntowards this investigation. The historical sources have never been studied\r\nat all; such as the colonial records now publishing, the records and\r\npapers of the probate court in some of the older and more important\r\ncounties of the south--especially the returns of administrators,\r\nexecutors, and guardians, and files of newspapers advertising their\r\ncitations. Here can be found the prevailing prices of slaves, their rate\r\nof multiplication, all details of their management, from the very\r\nbeginning. The trial and equity courts contain records of litigation about\r\nslaves; of advice of chancellors to trustees seeking to make or change\r\ninvestment; of wills manumitting slaves; and a thousand other relevant\r\nmatters. The course of legislation as to slaves from the first to the end\r\nis also important. From these, from local literature such as \"Georgia\r\nScenes,\" \"Simon Suggs,\" biography, and various pamphlets, and other\r\noriginal sources,--far better historical evidence than any which is now\r\ngenerally invoked,--can be learned the real facts as to the growth of\r\nslavery; and especially how in its economic potency consequent upon the\r\ninvention of the gin it supplanted or made dependent upon itself all other\r\nproperty, and became the solitary foundation of every kind of production\r\nand mode of making a living; so that even by 1820 to abolish slavery would\r\nhave been almost to beggar the southern people for two or three\r\ngenerations. It is to be hoped that Professor Brown, finding the\r\nopportunity which he desires, may yet exhaust not only the sources I have\r\nmentioned, but also important ones that I have not even thought of, and\r\ngive the true ante-bellum history of the lower south. Some such work is\r\nnecessary to explain the active principle, the _raison d'etre_ of southern\r\nnationalization.\r\n\r\nHow north and south were sundered by the different nationalizations is yet\r\nto be told in full detail without any censure of the people of either.\r\nPractically every American was born into an occupation or way of life\r\nconnected with or founded upon either slave or free labor interests, and\r\nso was born into one or the other of these two nationalizations, and his\r\nconscience coerced him to stay with it. These nationalizations made two\r\ndifferent publics and two different countries in the United States. After\r\nthe slavery agitation had become active the masses in either public knew\r\nbut little of the other, and cared for it less; and when war broke out\r\nbetween the two countries every man, woman, and child was ready to die, if\r\nthere was need, for his own. When the history of the times has been\r\nimpartially and adequately written the world will recognize that the\r\npatriotism and moral worth of neither side excels that of the other, and\r\nit will crown both.\r\n\r\nThe evolution indicated above produced not only the two hostile peoples,\r\nbut also their leaders and representatives of every class. I have taken\r\npains in a relevant chapter to show how the fire-eaters and the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists were at last brought upon the stage. Every\r\nfierce controversy in history has had their like on each side. Their\r\ncoming is late. The antagonists have become excited. The intelligence\r\nguiding evolution deceives them as to the parts they must play. They\r\nbelieve that their mission is to arouse the public conscience in order to\r\nright some alleged moral wrong. Their real mission is to excite to angry\r\naction. Cicero condemns the Peripatetics for asserting that proneness to\r\nanger has been usefully given by nature.[2] He overlooked the fact that\r\nthe outbreak of the passion is intended to spur us into doing something\r\nimportant for our own protection; and that it is therefore an\r\nindispensable weapon in our self-defensive armory. These fanatics, as we\r\noften call them, instigated north and south to quarrel more and more\r\nfiercely, and finally to fight. The purpose of the powers in the unseen in\r\ncausing the fight has already been stated.\r\n\r\nWhat especially concerns us here is that we avoid adhering to the mistakes\r\nof these partisans which still have injurious effect upon opinion. Thus\r\nthe fire-eater could see no good whatever in the yankees, as he called\r\nthem, denying them honesty, trustworthiness, and other elementary virtues;\r\naccusing them of robbing us by the tariff and other measures, and hating\r\nus for the prosperity and comfort which the slavery system had blessed us\r\nwith. Other of his false charges are still lodged in the memory of some\r\ninfluential southerners. But the fire-eater's predictions were all\r\ncompletely falsified by the result of the war; and he has become so much\r\ndiscredited as an authority, there is no very great need for consuming\r\nmuch time and effort in correcting his misstatements. On the other hand\r\nthe decisive success of their side has kept thousands at the north fully\r\nbelieving the wildest fabrications of the root-and-branch abolitionists.\r\nThe latter believed that the African slave of the south was just such a\r\nhuman being, ready for liberty and self-government in all particulars, as\r\ncivilized and enlightened whites. They believed that the condition of his\r\nimmediate ancestors in West Africa was one of high physical, mental,\r\nmoral, and social development, and that if there was in him now any\r\ninferiority to his master it was entirely due to the sinister influence of\r\nAmerican slavery. They also believed that the system was fraught with such\r\ncruelties as frequent separation of man and wife and of mother and young\r\nchildren, under- feeding and clothing, and grinding overwork,--that, in\r\nshort, the average slave was daily exposed to something like the torture\r\nof the Inquisition. All this was invention. American slavery found the\r\nnegro gabbling inarticulately and gave him English; it found him a\r\ncannibal and fetishist and gave him the Christian religion; it found him a\r\nslave to whom his savage master allowed no rights at all, and it gave him\r\nan enlightened master bound by law to accord him the most precious human\r\nrights; it found him an inveterate idler and gave him the work habit; it\r\nfound him promiscuous in the horde and gave him the benign beginning of\r\nthe monogamic family,--in short, as now appears very strongly probable,\r\nAmerican slavery gave him his sole opportunity to rise above the barbarism\r\nof West Africa.\r\n\r\nThese tremendous mistakes of fact, after knitting the north in solid\r\nphalanx against dividing the Territories with the south and restoring\r\nfugitive slaves and thus hasting forward the war, prompted that folly of\r\nfollies the fifteenth amendment, and have ever since kept the north from\r\nunderstanding the race question.\r\n\r\nI am sure that it is high time that we of each section should school\r\nourselves into impartially appreciating the civil leaders of the other\r\nside. The south has made more progress towards this than the north.\r\nCertain causes have operated to help her onward. One of these is that\r\npractically all of us recognize it is far better for the section that the\r\nunion side won. Another is that the great mass have learned that slavery\r\nboth effeminated and paralyzed the whites and was a smothering incubus\r\nupon our due social and material development. It is natural that although\r\nwe give our pro-slavery political leaders and the confederate soldiers\r\nincreasing love, we should more and more commend the pro-union and\r\nanti-slavery activity of the northern statesmen. Nothing like this has led\r\nthe north to revise the reprobation which in the heat and passion of the\r\nconflict it bestowed upon the public men of the south. If I ever read a\r\ngood word from a northern writer as to them, it is for something in their\r\ncareers disconnected with the southern cause. Even Mr. Rhodes, the ablest\r\nand most impartial of northern historians of the times, finds in Calhoun\r\nonly a closet spinner of utterly impractical theories. Further, I could\r\nhardly believe it when I read it--and it is hard for me to believe it\r\nyet--that, citing some flippant words of Parton in which a slander of\r\ncontemporary politics is toothsomely repeated as his voucher, he flatly\r\ncharges the lion-hearted knight of the south with playing the coward in\r\nthe most heroic episode of his grand career. My faith is strong that this\r\nmode of treating the good and great southern leaders will soon go out of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nI am greatly in earnest to vindicate these leaders--especially Calhoun,\r\nToombs, and Davis. Much of the public life of each one was concerned with\r\nmatters of national interest. To this I give special attention, for I want\r\nmy northern readers to know what true Americans they all were. Without\r\nthis they cannot have their full glory. And their justification is that of\r\ntheir people. Such effective leaders are always representative. It is a\r\nmisnomer to call them leaders. They were really followers of their\r\nconstituents who were struggling for the subsistence of themselves and\r\ntheir dear ones. During this time Calhoun, Toombs, and Davis, had they not\r\nlabored in every way to protect this great cause--the cause of their own\r\ncountry--as they did, would have been as recreant as the confederate\r\nsoldier, skulking away from the line defending home and fireside. When our\r\ncountry is in peril the unseen lords of its destiny do not take any one of\r\nus, from the greatest to the humblest, into their confidence as to the\r\nevent. Every man of us must support in politics and on the field the cause\r\nof our people. If that must go down it will make defeat glorious to go\r\ndown with it, as contentedly and bravely as did Demosthenes, Cicero, and\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\nWhoever diligently studies the facts will be convinced that southern\r\nnationalization, with a power superior to human resistance, carried the\r\nsouthern people into secession, and that their so-called leaders were\r\ncarried with them. He will discern that the parts of the latter were\r\nmerely to serve as floats to mark the course of the current beneath.\r\nTherefore be just to these leaders for justice' sake. Further, you\r\nbrothers and sisters of the north ought to bethink yourselves and keep in\r\nmind how we regard them. The reputation of these our civil champions and\r\ntheir graves are as dear to us as those of our mothers. If you adopted an\r\norphan, you would feel it to be unpardonable to speak slightingly to him\r\nof his parents. Cleopatra, her conqueror sending her word to study on what\r\nfair demands she would have, answered:\r\n\r\n  \"That majesty to keep decorum, must\r\n  No less beg than a kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nLet those who wore the blue and their descendants think over it long\r\nenough to realize how unspeakably low and treacherous it would be in us to\r\nabet any condemnation whatever of these men for their anti-union\r\nacts--these men whom we or our fathers voted for and supported because of\r\nthese acts. If you deny justification to them, how can we keep decorum in\r\naccepting it ourselves?\r\n\r\nI would say one more word, where perhaps I am a little over-earnest. These\r\nsouthern leaders have contributed richly to the treasures of American\r\nhistory. Their moral worth,--nay, moral grandeur,--their great natural\r\nparts, their statesmanly ability, their eloquence, their heroic fidelity\r\nto their people,--by these each has won indefeasible title to the best of\r\nrenown. Whenever the north has made real study of them, she will give them\r\nas generous admiration as she now does to the charge of Pickett. I have\r\ndone my utmost to present Calhoun, Toombs, and Davis faithfully, using, as\r\nI believe, all the main facts which are relevant and incontrovertible. I\r\nam sure that every northerner who reads them, after he has laid aside all\r\nprejudice, will admit that I did not claim too much when I was recounting\r\ntheir merits a moment ago.\r\n\r\nI invite close consideration of all that I say of Webster. The purpose of\r\nprovidence, bestowing birthplace, early environment, training, and career\r\nas preparation for a paramount mission, shows more conspicuously in him\r\nthan in any other of America's great, with the solitary exception of\r\nWashington. How the names of detracting agitators and mere politicians\r\nwritten over his in the temple of fame are now fading off, and how the\r\ninvincible and lovable champion of the brother's union looms larger upon\r\nus every year!\r\n\r\nI am painfully conscious of how certain omissions, unavoidable in my\r\nlimited space, mar the symmetry of my ground-plan. The average reader will\r\nprobably think that I ought to have sketched Lincoln, Grant, and Lee. I\r\nwas convinced that the public had already become reasonably instructed as\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nJohn Q. Adams is one of the most conspicuous men of his day. Standing\r\naloof from parties, completely self-reliant, opulently endowed with every\r\nhigh power of moderation, insight, and effective presentation, his good\r\ngenius gave him the championship in congress of the free-labor cause\r\nduring the critical years that it was preparing for the decisive meeting\r\nwith the slave-labor cause. In this time it seems to me that single-handed\r\nhe achieved more for the latter than all its other champions. A pleasant\r\nparallel between him and Lee occurs to me. Each had filled the proudest\r\nplace in the chosen avocation of his life. Adams had been the chief\r\nmagistrate of the great republic, elected by the votes of a continent. Lee\r\nhad been the foremost general of the bravest and most puissant nation that\r\never lost its existence by war. Each one of the two passed from power down\r\ninto what is usually a condition of inaction and accumulating rust till\r\nthe end of life, and to each was most kindly granted the achievement of\r\nnew fame and glory. In the national house of representatives, Adams,\r\nduring the last twelve years of his life,--1836-48,--did the great deeds\r\nwhich we have just lauded. In the last years of his life Lee, as the head\r\nof an humble institution of learning, showed not only the youth in his\r\ncharge, but all of his stricken people, how to conquer direst adversity\r\nwith such grand success in an example of unmurmuring endurance that every\r\nfuture generation of men will give it more loving appreciation.\r\n\r\nJohn Q. Adams, as I have tried to explain, is almost an American epoch of\r\nhimself; but I could not give him the chapter that is his due.\r\n\r\nI felt that it would have been well to pair Stephen A. Douglas of the\r\nnorth with Alexander H. Stephens of the south. They are in nearly exact\r\nantithetical contrast. The former clung to the south, the other to the\r\nunion, until the clock struck the dread hour of separation. How they loved\r\neach other and each other's people! They most strikingly exemplify the\r\nadamantine grip which each one of the two nationalizations kept upon its\r\ngreatest and best.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips and William L. Yancey should be contrasted. Each one was\r\nthe very prince of sectional agitators, helping with great efficiency to\r\nmake the public opinion that carried forward Seward and Lincoln, the\r\nactual leaders of the north, and Toombs, the actual leader of the south.\r\nIt is my strong conviction that Phillips and Yancey were the most gifted,\r\neloquent, and influential stump speakers in America since Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\nChase steadily rises in my estimate. His solid parts, his consistent,\r\nconscientious, and able anti-slavery career, and especially that decisive\r\nspeech in the Peace Congress,--these, and other relevancies that can be\r\nmentioned, drew me powerfully. The firm candor with which he avowed in\r\nthat memorable speech that the north had decided against the expansion of\r\nslavery, demonstrates the clearness of his vision. The part of it which\r\nrecurs to me most frequently is that in which he impressively recounts the\r\nintersectional dissension over the fugitive slave law,--the south\r\nbelieving slavery right, the north believing it wrong,--and proposes that\r\nin place of the remedy given by that law the master be paid the value of\r\nhis slave. \"Instead of judgment for rendition,\" he said, \"let there be\r\njudgment for compensation determined by the true value of the services,\r\nand let the same judgment assure freedom to the fugitive. The cost to the\r\nnational treasury would be as nothing in comparison with the evils of\r\ndiscord and strife. All parties would be gainers.\"\r\n\r\nCalhoun devised to restrain the sections from mutual aggression by\r\nendowing each with an absolute veto against the other. Webster fondly\r\nbelieved that if he could be president he would bring back the wrangling\r\nbrothers to love one another again as much as he loved them all. Chase\r\nalso had his pet impracticable project. Each one of the three recoiled and\r\nracked all of his invention to save his country from the huge fraternal\r\nslaughter that his divining soul whispered to him was near.\r\n\r\nThe south will cherish the memory of Chase more and more fondly as she\r\nlearns better how he firmly stood for civil law against military rule, and\r\nthat he was heart and soul for universal amnesty.\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to deny a chapter to William H. Seward. He seems to\r\nme to have been the only northern man whose foresight of the coming\r\nconvulsion equalled that of Calhoun. He did not become a Jeremiah as the\r\nother did, for his section was not, after it had just emerged from a gulf\r\nof blood, to be plunged and held for years in a gulf of poverty and\r\ndisorder. He was far less serious and much more optimistic in his nature\r\nthan Calhoun. Affectionate, sympathetic, rarely agreeable in his\r\nmanners--how well Mrs. Davis depicts him in what is to me one of the\r\npleasantest passages of her book.[3] He was spoils politician, able\r\npopular leader, and great statesman in rare combination. While his heart\r\nwas extremely warm, his head was never turned by his feelings. Lincoln\r\nardently believed in his soul what Choate calls \"the glittering\r\ngeneralities\" of the declaration of independence. But to Seward current\r\nillusions were the same as they were to Napoleon Bonaparte--he was to lead\r\nthe masses with them just as far as possible, but not to deceive himself.\r\nRead in your closet his two epochal speeches, the \"higher law\" one of\r\nMarch 11, 1850, and that proclaiming the irrepressible conflict at\r\nRochester, October 25, 1858, then read that of Chase at the Peace\r\nCongress, and you cannot avoid feeling that while Chase opposes slavery\r\nmainly because he conceives it to be a gross moral wrong, the other\r\nopposes because it is the belonging of an inferior civilization. In my\r\nopinion no man of that time had such a clear conception as Seward of the\r\nutter economical incompatibility of the free-labor system and the\r\nslave-labor system, and of the doom of the latter in their conflict then\r\non. While he had this superior insight and wisdom it was the better way\r\nfor him to follow the tide of morbid moral sentiment and unreasoning zeal\r\ncarrying the country on to his goal. Following thus he proved a leader\r\nunsurpassed. The longer I contemplate Seward the stronger becomes my\r\nconviction that he is the most entertaining subject and the most\r\ndelightful in variety of parts and traits of all American statesmen for\r\nthe essayist portrait painter. To give a picture true to life demands the\r\nvery best and highest art.\r\n\r\nIn my last two chapters I do all I can to clear up the race question,\r\nwhich is now densely beclouded with northern misunderstanding and southern\r\nprejudice. The negro has a nature that in some material particulars\r\ndiffers so widely from that of the Caucasian that it ought to be duly\r\nallowed for; and yet as people are so prone to think all others just like\r\nthemselves, this is hardly ever done. Now, forty years after emancipation,\r\nwe see that the promptings and consequences of his nature just emphasized\r\nin combination with the social forces operating upon him have caused\r\nchanges in the situation, of the gravest import to him. His native\r\nidleness, coming back stronger and stronger the further he gets in time\r\nfrom the steady work of slavery, his lack of forecast, his vice,\r\ninveterate pauperism, increasing disease and insanity, on one side; the\r\nhostility excited against him by the inexpressibly unwise grant to him of\r\nequal political rights, and the rapid invasion by white labor since the\r\nearly nineties of the province which he appropriated during the years when\r\nthe whites had not recovered from the paralyzing shock and surprise of\r\nemancipation, on the other side, example these changes. There has evolved\r\na division of the southern negroes into two classes. One class, which I\r\nmost roughly distinguish as the upper, contains all those who are not\r\ncompelled by their circumstances to be unskilled laborers in country and\r\ntown. It hardly amounts to one-twentieth of the whole. The millions are\r\nall in the other class, which I again most roughly distinguish as the\r\nlower. Ponder what I tell you of them, their helplessness, their\r\naccelerating degradation, their mounting death rate, their gloomy\r\nprospects. I try hard also to have the upper class well understood. To a\r\nsoutherner it is amazing how many outside people of education,\r\nintelligence, and fair-mindedness assume that the multitude in the lower\r\nclass are the same in every material detail of character and ability as\r\nthose few who by various favors of fortune have found place in the upper\r\nclass. To stress here, in the beginning, a fact as its very great\r\nimportance demands, nearly all the negroes who get high station are part\r\nwhite. Dumas, the father, was at least half white. The son Dumas was\r\nprobably three-quarters white. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the Anglo-African\r\ncomposer, is half white. Such as these are the samples by which nearly all\r\nthe continent and England, and many northerners, estimate the capacity of\r\nthe pure negroes of the south, grovelling in depths out of which one\r\nclimbs only now and then by a miracle. The men just mentioned are not real\r\nnegroes. It is the same with nearly all the so-called negroes of America,\r\nfrom Douglass to Dr. Washington, who have become famous. They are but\r\nexamples of what whites can do against adversity. The coal-black equalling\r\nthese in achievement would be as rare among his fellows as Hans, the\r\nBerlin thinker, is among horses. This palpable distinction between men who\r\nare largely, if not nearly all, Caucasian, and men who are purely West\r\nAfrican in descent, is utterly overlooked by many most conscientious and\r\nearnest ones of the north, like Mr. Louis F. Post, who is always telling\r\nus of the south what the negro is--not, and how we should treat him,\r\nmagisterially reading us lessons in A B C democracy.\r\n\r\nThere will be fewer and fewer part-white negroes in the south by reason of\r\nthe steadily increasing hostility of each race to mixed procreation. This\r\nupper class has long shown a drift northward. Under the expulsion of many\r\nof its members from certain occupations by white competition, lately\r\ncommenced and fast increasing, this drift now gathers strength. From what\r\nI see every day it seems to me that the destiny of much the greater part\r\nof this upper class is disappearance partly by absorption and partly by\r\neuthanasy.\r\n\r\nIt is the millions of the lower class that should be our deepest concern.\r\nIf they be left where their utopian emancipators and enfranchisers have\r\nplaced them, it is almost certain that nearly the whole will go into the\r\njaws of destruction, now opening wide before them and sucking them in.\r\nSuch a result of the three amendments--that is, to have annihilated hosts\r\nupon hosts of pure negroes in order to make just a few part-whites\r\nall-white--would be a fit monument to the statesmanship of the maddest\r\nvisionaries in all history. We must come resolutely and lovingly to the\r\nhelp of these wretched creatures. I tell you at large how it is our duty\r\nto give the black man his own State in our union, and supervise him in it\r\neven better than we are now doing for the Philippine.\r\n\r\nI believe that the foregoing, re-enforced by a glance over the\r\nchapter-titles, will give a reader the preconception which he ought to get\r\nfrom an introduction to a book which he is about to begin. In dealing with\r\nthe causes and some of the more important consequences of the brothers'\r\nwar my method is rationale rather than narrative. My first purpose is to\r\nindicate how everything happened according to laws that with cosmic force\r\nreared two great economic powers, divided the whole land into a vast host\r\nstanding up for one of the two in the south, and a still larger host\r\nstanding up for the other in the north, and how these same laws were most\r\nfaithfully served by all the actors on each side. I try to set out and\r\nexplain what are the principles of evolution and the ways of human action,\r\nand especially the commanding view-points, which must be rightly attended\r\nto in their supreme importance before the greater one of the two critical\r\nAmerican eras can have its fit history. The man who writes it will be\r\nentirely free from the monomania and orgiastic fury of both fire-eater and\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist, from their excessively emotional\r\nassumptions, their explosive and exclamatory argumentation; he will have\r\nthe industry, the undisturbed vision, and the perfect fairness of the\r\nforemost sociologists of our time; he will show how each side was right\r\nfrom first to last in upholding its own separate country,--all belonging\r\nto it, statesmen, agitators, demagogues, fanatical fire-eaters and\r\nabolitionists, generals and soldiers. He will show that such things which\r\nin expedience ought not to have been done were unavoidable, and therefore\r\nto be excused. He will show what erroneous judgments of each section\r\nshould now be challenged and kept from working injury. Especially do I\r\nemphasize it, he will convince every average reader that north and south\r\nwere equally conscientious, honest, heroic, and lovable from beginning to\r\nend. Such a history will be even greater than that by which Thucydides\r\nrealized his soaring ambition to give the world an everlasting possession;\r\nand it will become the bible of America, treasured and loved alike by the\r\npeople both north and south.\r\n\r\nThis bible is coming, as many signs show. I will illustrate by examples\r\nfrom three northern authors, given not exactly in the order of time, but\r\nin that of their approximation to full attainment. After a circumstantial\r\ndescription of each one of the three days' fighting at Gettysburg, fair\r\nand impartial in the extreme, Mr. Vanderslice eulogizes both sides,\r\nwithout invidious distinction, for \"their fidelity and gallantry, their\r\nfortitude and valor,\" and because there was nothing done by either \"to\r\ntarnish their record as soldiers,\" and most becomingly emphasizes the\r\n\"martial fame and glory\" thereby won \"for the American soldier.\" But just\r\nhere he sounds a most unpleasantly discordant note by saying, \"One was\r\nright and the other wrong.\"[4] He forgot that brothers who fight as those\r\ndid at Gettysburg are all right, and that whenever one falls on either\r\nside flights of angels sing him to his rest.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1902, Mr. Charles F. Adams, making an academic address at\r\nChicago, startled many of his auditors with this outspoken vindication of\r\nthe south:\r\n\r\n    \"Legally and technically,--_not morally_,-- ... and wholly\r\n    irrespective of humanitarian considerations,--to which side did the\r\n    weight of argument incline during the great debate which culminated in\r\n    our civil war?... If we accept the judgment of some of the more modern\r\n    students and investigators of history,--either wholly unprejudiced or\r\n    with a distinct union bias,--it would seem as if the weight of\r\n    argument falls into what I will term the confederate scale.\"[5]\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, having made further inquiry of his own, December 22 of the same\r\nyear, announced a still more advanced conclusion. He had said at Chicago\r\nthat the confederate scale preponderated; but now his vision having become\r\nmore certain he said the scales hung even.[6] Note that in the passage\r\njust quoted from him I have italicized the two words \"not morally.\" I do\r\nnot understand that in the Charleston speech he meant to revoke the\r\nitalicized words, and to say anything more than that each side was right\r\nin its own view of the nature of the government. Even with this\r\nreservation, the utterances of Mr. Adams evince a grateful improvement\r\nupon the dogmatism which characterizes nearly every other northerner or\r\nsoutherner who has treated the subject.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wendell sees clearly that both sides were morally right, and he\r\nis impartially just and equally loving to both. I feel that the quotations\r\nfrom a late work of his which I now make are the chief merits of this\r\nchapter. Considering the controversy between the sections, he says, with\r\nthe truest insight, \"The constitution of the United States was presenting\r\nitself more and more in the light of an agreement between two incompatible\r\nsets of economic institutions, assuming to each the right freely to exist\r\nwithin its own limits.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIn this next passage as to the same subject, rising above Mr. Adams to the\r\nhigh frankness which the facts demand, he says, \"The truth is that an\r\nirrepressible social conflict was at hand, and that both sides were as\r\nhonorable as were both sides during the American Revolution, or during the\r\ncivil wars of England.\"[8]\r\n\r\nHow just to north and south each, and how fraternally compassionate\r\ntowards the south is this: \"Solemn enough to the uninvaded north, the war\r\nmeant more than northern imagination has yet realized to those southern\r\nStates into whose heart its horrors were slowly, surely carried. Such a\r\ntime was too intense for much expression; it was a moment rather for\r\nheroic action; and in south and north alike it found armies of heroes. Of\r\nthese there are few more stirring records than a simple ballad made by Dr.\r\nTicknor, of Georgia, concerning a confederate soldier.\"[9] And then he\r\nquotes \"Little Giffen\" in full.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wendell reaches a still greater height when he decorates the\r\nTyrtaeus of the Confederate States and the supereminent anti-slavery\r\nlyricist of the north with equal homage and admiration. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"The civil war brought forth no lines more fervent [than the\r\n    concluding thirty-six of Timrod's 'The Cotton Boll,' which are set\r\n    out], and few whose fervor rises to such lyric height. In the days of\r\n    conflict, north regarded south, and south north, as the incarnation of\r\n    evil. Time, however, has begun its healing work; at last our country\r\n    begins to understand itself better than ever before; and as our new\r\n    patriotism strengthens, we cannot prize too highly such verses as\r\n    Whittier's, honestly phrasing noble northern sentiment, or as\r\n    Timrod's, who with equal honesty phrased the noble sentiment of the\r\n    south. A literature which in the same years could produce work so\r\n    utterly antagonistic in superficial sentiment, and yet so harmonious\r\n    in their common sincerity and loftiness of feeling, is a literature\r\n    from which riches may come.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThese words are more golden than I can tell. They parallel the elevation\r\nof Webster, showing the same love for South Carolina and Massachusetts, in\r\nthe pertinent parts of the reply to Hayne, which since my boyhood I have\r\ncherished as a nonpareil. It is cheering to a faithful southerner to\r\nreceive such sure proof that the day must soon come when all obloquy will\r\nbe lifted from the fame of Calhoun, Toombs, and Davis. What a grand\r\ntriumph of contrast, almost surpassing the best achievement of Shakspeare,\r\nit will be when some honest Griffith, having shown Webster, Lincoln, and\r\nGrant in all the worth which merited their unspeakably happy lot, each\r\nradiant with the victor's glory, places opposite the great civic heroes of\r\nthe southern nation, their due renown at last fitly blazoned. That renown\r\nwill be that they devoted the very greatest human powers and virtues all\r\ntheir lives, with never remitted effort and spotless fidelity, to save a\r\ndoomed country,--the imperishable renown of grand failure in a cause which\r\nadverse fate cannot keep from being ever dear to all humanity.\r\n\r\nMy last word as to what I have just quoted from the three northern authors\r\nis that all of us--and especially the fast widening public of\r\nreaders--ought to be forever in earnest to applaud such sentiments and\r\nchide every manifestation of excessive sectional bias or prejudice from\r\neither northerner or southerner. This has been my incessantly kept faith\r\nfor years. As proof I refer to my article, \"The Old and New South,\" nearly\r\nall of it written in the early part of 1875--thirty years ago--and which I\r\npublished the next year. I give an exact copy of it in the Appendix. As\r\nyou go through it remember these things of the author: The election of\r\nLincoln made me believe, as it did thousands of other southerners, that\r\nsecession was the only patriotic course. I therefore voted for secession\r\ndelegates to the State convention. I served in the confederate army all\r\nthe war, taking part in the First Manassas and many other battles; and\r\nwhen I had been surrendered and paroled at Appomattox I walked back to my\r\nhome in Georgia. Ten years after this I had found full solace and comfort\r\nfor the direful event to the south of the brothers' war; and I had learned\r\nthat the brothers on each side had complete justification in conscience\r\nfor their contrary parts as statesmen, public leaders, voters, and at the\r\nend as soldiers. I want my readers of each section to see that I have long\r\npractised what I am now preaching.\r\n\r\nI beg attention to the article on another score. It shows that the\r\nopinions expressed in this book have not been formed in haste. Nearly all\r\nof the more important will be found therein, in embryo, at least; and the\r\npresent book will show, I hope, that they have prosperously grown. There\r\nare passages in the article, such as those touching the relations of the\r\nraces, the future of the negro, the maintenance by the decentralizing\r\nforces of the union of their balance with the counter ones, and also\r\nothers, which I might now justly claim to have proved prophetic; and I do\r\nnot believe that a serious misprediction can be found in the entire\r\narticle. This is, I hope, such corroboration by after occurrences as\r\nindicates that even my early studies of the transcendently important\r\ntheme were not unfruitful.\r\n\r\nFurther, the article serves in some sort to mark a definite stage in\r\nevolution. To give but one illustration: Although my close attention to\r\nplanting interests at the time and for the seven or eight preceding years\r\nhad kept me closely watching the negro, I had not then discovered even the\r\nbeginning of that division of the race into two classes which is now so\r\nplain to me.\r\n\r\nPossibly some readers may shy away from my book, deeming that its subject\r\nis hackneyed and worn out. They will exclaim, What can this author say\r\nthat has not been said in the vast library of books already written upon\r\nthe civil war? This will be asked, I am sure, only by the unobservant and\r\nunreflecting. If one but turn away from the assumptions, dogmas, and\r\nphilippics, with which north and south cannonaded each other's morality\r\nwith increasing fury from 1831 to 1861, to the _rerum causae_, the play of\r\nresistless social forces, and the other actualities and great things\r\nindicated above, their huge stores of varied novelty, interest, romance,\r\nand wisdom will greatly embarass him--as has been my painful\r\nexperience--both in making the best selection and in his felt inability to\r\ngive what he does at last select its fit presentation.\r\n\r\nAs illustration I will say that every thoroughly impartial northern reader\r\nwho meditates what I narrate as to Toombs will, I believe, be astonished\r\nto learn that one so prodigally gifted with supreme virtue and supreme\r\ngenius, and who was of unexampled success in doing all the common and all\r\nthe extraordinary duties of high place, has become worse than forgotten in\r\nalmost his own day; and such a reader will suspect, as I do myself, that\r\nthere is much more of value in his career that I have overlooked.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this chapter is too long already. But I pray my reader to allow me\r\nto say a little more. We are upon the threshold of a new American era.\r\nEvidently because of our western coast we are to dominate the Pacific\r\nocean commerce and to develop it into proportions so enormous as to be now\r\nalmost inconceivable. That coast will soon outstrip the Atlantic in\r\npopulation and great cities. Our people, safe against wars on the\r\ncontinent, maintaining armies only of workers, taught better methods every\r\nyear by practice and science, will soon be far in advance of their present\r\nenviable prosperity and comfort. Cheering as is the promise of their\r\nmaterial progress, that of their progress in virtue and good government is\r\nstill more cheering. Everywhere in the north--which was not impoverished,\r\ndeprived of familiar modes of production, and paralyzed with a race\r\nquestion by the event of the brothers' war--the State electorates are\r\nrebelling successfully against the party machine, cashiering the boss, and\r\nsubverting the corporation oligarchy. That in the last election the voters\r\nmost intelligently split their tickets assures the early expulsion of\r\nspoilsmen, grafters, and public-service franchise-grabbers from the\r\ncontrol of our politics, legislation, and administration of government,\r\nand the real and permanent elevation of the people to being their own\r\nabsolute governors. In several States--one of these a southern--the vote\r\nwas for the most democratic and anti-plutocratic president since Lincoln,\r\nwhile at the same time the anti-plutocratic State candidates, either of\r\nthe other party or independent, were elected. Our population will soon\r\noutstrip all the world in average riches, comfort, virtue, and education.\r\nThe special note to be made of this new American era now beginning is that\r\nwe are to lead the nations into a war-abolishing United States of the\r\nworld, which in the end will make and keep them our equals in solid\r\nwelfare and happiness. With this prospect in view, the brighter and more\r\nenrapturing as I cannot keep from contrasting it with the black and\r\nhopeless future which settled around me at Appomattox, I would do all that\r\nI can to bring about that better understanding between north and south\r\nwhich befits the good time near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA BEGINNING MADE WITH SLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a distinguished southerner, familiar with the subject, says, slavery in\r\nthe United States was \"a stupendous anachronism.\"[11] It is almost\r\nincredible to the average northerner of to-day that the enlightened people\r\nof the south sank backwards in social development a thousand years or\r\nmore, and hugged to their bosoms for several generations such a monstrous\r\nevil and peril.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of two facts fully explains the wonder just noted. Now\r\nlet us try to understand this.\r\n\r\nThe first fact is the part played by tobacco and cotton before the\r\nanti-slavery sentiment became influential. At a time when there was\r\npractically no industry but agriculture these two staples became the most\r\nlucrative of all common American crops. Tobacco found its true soil in\r\nVirginia, and cotton farther south. It developed in time that both could\r\nbe made far more profitably with African slaves than by free white labor,\r\nthe only other labor to be had. Of course you are to remember that slave\r\ncultivation of tobacco did not become general in Virginia until near the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, and that it was the invention of the gin\r\nsoon after the adoption of the federal constitution in 1789 that started\r\ncotton production on a large scale. What you are especially to grasp here\r\nis the economic conditions which naturally spread slavery from its\r\nbeginning at Jamestown, first over Virginia, and then throughout the\r\nentire south, either settled in large measure from Virginia, or looking\r\nthither for example. The Virginian who could not replace his exhausted\r\nfields with virgin soil at home went with his slaves either west or south,\r\nand hacked down enough of the primeval forest to give his working force\r\nits quantum of arable land. We need not stop here to tell of rice and\r\ncane, nor of other crops and industries which for a while engaged slave\r\nlabor in northern regions of the south where the soil did not suit\r\ntobacco. The foregoing suggests adequately for this place how slavery\r\nbecame general in the south.\r\n\r\nThe second fact is that the prevalent opinion of that time was far\r\ndifferent from that of to-day, for certain reasons, to which I would now\r\nhave you attend.\r\n\r\nLong before the discovery of America personal slavery had fallen under the\r\nban of the christian church and become in Europe a thing of the past. The\r\nDivine Comedy catalogues in detail the religious, political, moral, and\r\nsocial events of its age. It is utterly silent throughout as to slavery.\r\nDante died in 1321, soon after he had finished the Divine Comedy. That was\r\nnearly three hundred years before the appearance of African slavery in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nNow for something of very great importance to us here, which occurred soon\r\nafterwards, and before the introduction of African slavery into America.\r\nIt is that by the Renascence the literature of slaveholding Greece and\r\nRome suddenly acquired and long held commanding influence upon almost\r\nevery educator of the public in the enlightened world. It was in the last\r\nquarter of the fourteenth century--some fifty years after Dante had\r\ndied--that the classics revived in Italy. Spreading thence over Europe,\r\nthey are found dominating the great Elizabethan divines, philosophers,\r\npoets, and other opinion-forming writers at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. And during all of the time from the landing of the twenty\r\nAfricans at Jamestown by the Dutch man-of-war in 1619 until slavery had\r\nbecome the solitary prop of southern industry and property, the Greek and\r\nLatin ancient writers were in our mother country almost the sole subjects\r\nof school or university education, and the main reading of all those that\r\nread at all. And every page of this literature, studied with enthusiastic\r\nworship and resorted to day in and day out for instruction and\r\ninspiration, disclosed that in Greece and Rome the average family was\r\ndependent for its maintenance upon slaves; and that so far from slavery\r\nbeing a relic of barbarism, as the American root-and-branch abolitionists\r\nafterwards fulminated in a platform, it was the very foundation of the\r\nstate in those two great nations whose philosophy, learning, science,\r\njurisprudence, poetry, art, and eloquence are still the models in every\r\nenlightened land. Naturally the educated classes, now that it had been\r\nseveral hundred years since slavery was a burning question, had forgotten\r\nor had never heard of the old disinclination of the church, and could not\r\nsee any evil in that which their most admired and dearest ones had all\r\npractised. The classics did not stop with giving slavery the negative\r\nsupport just mentioned. Although such authors as Quintilian and Seneca,\r\nand the later jurists--all of the discredited silver, and not of the\r\nglorified Ciceronian and Augustan ages--do express, theatrically and\r\nacademically, anti-slavery opinions, yet what they say was merely dust in\r\nthe balance when weighed against the commendations of the institution to\r\nbe found in the writings of Aristotle, Plato, and Cicero, who had now\r\nbecome the great idols of intellectual society.[12]\r\n\r\nThe church would not stay out in the cold and dark, whither it had been\r\nsuddenly and rudely cast by the Renascence. It woke up to discover that as\r\nthe African was a heathen barbarian it was God's mercy to kidnap him for a\r\nchristian master, and thus give him his only opportunity of saving his\r\nsoul. And although it is not right to enslave other races, the descendants\r\nof Ham are an exception, who by reason of Noah's curse are to be the\r\nservants of servants to the end of time--that is what Holy Church taught\r\nby precept and example.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Hawkins has the unenviable distinction of being the first\r\nEnglish captain of a slave-ship, about the year 1552.\"[13] His venture\r\nproved a great success. Good Queen Bess reproached him for his\r\nmistreatment of human beings. He answered that it was far better for the\r\nAfrican thus to become a slave in a christian community, than to live the\r\nrest of his life in his native home of idolatry; and this was so\r\nconvincing that \"in the subsequent expeditions of this most heartless\r\nman-stealer, she was a partner and protector.\"[14] Until the end of the\r\nseventeenth century the masses regarded the negro as being rather wild\r\nbeast than man, showing no more scruples in catching and making a drudge\r\nof him than later generations did in lassoing wild horses and working them\r\nunder curb-bit, spur, and whip. And the more understanding ones, who\r\nrecognized that the negro belonged to humanity, re-enforced Aristotle[15]\r\nand Pliny[16] with much that they found both in the Old and New\r\nTestaments.[17] The many who preached liberty or the true religion posed\r\nas humanitarians, pharisaically comparing themselves with the best\r\ncharacters of Greece and Rome. The citizens of those great republics, they\r\nsaid, in spite of their advanced democracy, tore men and women of their\r\nown race and blood away from home and country and forced them with the\r\nscourge to toil in chains, while we do that only with savages and\r\nheathens, who cannot be civilized or christianized in any other way. We\r\neschew slavery in the abstract. We tolerate it only in the concrete, which\r\nis the slavery of those destined for it by God and nature. Slave-catcher,\r\nslaveholder, and the public seriously and conscientiously held this creed.\r\n\r\nYou must now add to the list of influences planting and stimulating\r\nslavery in America the protection it got in the constitution under which\r\nthe federal government started in 1789. As Mr. Blaine says:\r\n\r\n    \"The compromises on the slavery question, inserted in the\r\n    constitution, were among the essential conditions upon which the\r\n    federal government was organized. If the African slave-trade had not\r\n    been permitted to continue for twenty years, if it had not been\r\n    conceded that three-fifths of the slaves should be counted in the\r\n    apportionment of representatives in congress, if it had not been\r\n    agreed that fugitives from service should be returned to their owners,\r\n    the thirteen States would not have been able in 1787 'to form a more\r\n    perfect union.'\"[18]\r\n\r\nThink over it until you can fully take in the prodigious favor to slavery\r\nwhich this countenance of it by the American bible of bibles naturally\r\ncreated in the north and south.\r\n\r\nThe forces rapidly sketched in the foregoing were so powerful in their\r\nco-operation to bring in slavery that its establishment and a long era of\r\nvigorous growth were inevitable. Note the years during which they met no\r\nsensible or only a fitful opposition. The first anti-slavery agitation\r\nthat shook the entire country was that over the Missouri question, which\r\nhaving lasted a little more than two years ended in 1821, thirty-two years\r\nafter the adoption of the constitution. This agitation was only against\r\nthe extension of slavery. It was not until 1835 that the presentation to\r\nCongress of petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia disclosed to the far-seeing Calhoun alone that serious and mighty\r\naggression upon slavery in the States was commencing. Here we may date the\r\nbeginning of the abolition movement. But that movement did not become\r\nrespectable with the great mass of northern people until the application\r\nof California in 1850 for admission into the union as a free State widened\r\nthe chasm between the sections so that it commenced to show to the dullest\r\neye, and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which came out in 1852, stirred the north to\r\nits depths. The growth of slavery was then and had been for a quarter of a\r\ncentury complete. The soil, climate, and best agricultural interests of\r\nthe south, at a time when she was to be wholly agricultural or\r\neconomically nothing at all, the practice and precepts of the sages of\r\nGreece and Rome, of the patriarchs of Israel, of Jesus and his disciples\r\nand apostles, of the great and good of modern times,--all these had, with\r\noracular consensus, led her understanding and conscience into adopting,\r\nnurturing, and on into extending slavery over her territory. Thus when\r\nabolition first emerged into open day, slavery had become the very\r\neconomical life of the south. It had so permeated and informed the\r\ncombined property, social, and political structure, that abolition would\r\nsubvert the community fabric and beggar the population of the southern\r\nStates now living in content and comfort.\r\n\r\nI trust that the foregoing shows you that it is not so strange after all\r\nthat slavery ran the career just described.\r\n\r\nBut some one says, how could the southerners as Americans, the especial\r\nchampions of liberty, stultify themselves by slaveholding? how could they\r\nforget the world-arousing words of the declaration of independence that\r\nall men are created equal, and endowed with unalienable rights to life,\r\nliberty, and pursuit of happiness?\r\n\r\nThis has already been answered. The slaveholding republics of Greece and\r\nRome had advanced in democracy so far beyond anything to be found in\r\nEurope at the revival of learning, that from that time on for many years\r\nthe political doctrine in the recovered classics was the very greatest of\r\nall the intellectual influences that made for mere democracy. The\r\ncelebrated passage in which Burke eulogizes the stubborn maintenance of\r\ntheir freedom by free slaveholders has been the text of speakers from\r\nPinkney, addressing the United States senate on the Missouri question, to\r\nToombs, lecturing in Tremont Temple, Boston, and it has never been\r\nconfuted. History shows no instance where such men ever reproached\r\nthemselves for slaveholding, and while it was profitable put it aside\r\nbecause it is undemocratic.\r\n\r\nAs to the words which you quote from the declaration of independence,\r\nJefferson, the draftsman, doubtless, meant them to include the African;\r\nbut the majority of the congress making it, and the American people\r\nactually ratifying it, almost unanimously held that the African was not\r\nenough of man to come within the words.\r\n\r\nA Roman law parallel aptly illustrates. In the Institutes it is said that\r\nslavery is contrary to the law of nature, for under this every one is born\r\nfree;[19] and again, that slavery was established by the _jus gentium_\r\nunder which a man is made subject to the dominion of another _contra\r\nnaturam_, that is, against nature, against _jus naturale_, or the law of\r\nnature.[20] And in the Pandects this is weakly echoed.[21] But the actual\r\nenactment of the _corpus juris civilis_ fortifies slavery as it had been\r\nestablished all over the world by the _jus gentium_ with these plain\r\nwords: \"The master has power of life and death over his slave; and\r\nwhatever property the slave acquires, he acquires for the master.\"[22]\r\n\r\nOur forefathers making the declaration of independence, and the Romans of\r\nJustinian's time, sentimentalized in the same words over the natural right\r\nto equality and liberty of all human beings, and also resolutely held on\r\nto their slaves. The solemn assertion that all men are created equal and\r\nof inalienable liberty made by American slaveholders was but a repetition\r\nof what Roman slaveholders had already said; and it is curious that the\r\nfact has not attracted due attention.\r\n\r\nI fancy that my objector now shoots his last bolt. He exclaims that\r\nsoutherners were incredibly dull and obtuse not to discern that\r\nresistlessly puissant economical, political, moral, and intellectual\r\nforces, not of America only but of the entire world, were leaguing\r\ntogether against slavery, and therefore they ought to have fled in time\r\nfrom the coming wrath and evil day.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory reply need not postulate any other than ordinary\r\nintelligence and alertness for the south. Note how people dwell near\r\noverflowing rivers, or a sea of tidal waves, or live volcanoes, or in\r\nearthquake districts, or near a tribe of scalping redskins, where they,\r\ntheir wives and children, keep merry as the day is long until calamity\r\ncomes. The warning of the abolitionists was too late. Suppose we had given\r\nthe inhabitants of Herculaneum or Pompeii or St. Pierre timely counsel to\r\nabandon their homes and settle beyond the reach of eruption. How many\r\nwould have done it? I knew hundreds of people, and among all of them there\r\nwas but one who showed by his actions that he foresaw the early fall of\r\nslavery. That was Mr. Frank L. Upson of Lexington, Georgia, a highly\r\naccomplished and well-informed man. In 1856, I think it was, he sold all\r\nof his slaves, declaring as his reason that he believed if he kept them he\r\nwould see them freed without compensation. He was so serious that he\r\ndeclared this even to his purchasers. They merely laughed, and everybody\r\nelse laughed too, to think how green he was to give them the good bargain\r\nthat he did. But after the war he enjoyed comfort from the money those\r\nslaves had brought him, when all his neighbors had been plunged into hard\r\ntimes by emancipation. There may have been others that did like him. There\r\ncould not have been many such, for I have never been able to hear of a\r\nsingle one.\r\n\r\nWe did like the rest of mankind do or would have done. We stuck to our\r\nhomes and business until the tidal wave washed them away. Yet there are\r\nwise ones who are positive that had we not been far more dull and\r\nunforeseeing than the average we would have understood many years before\r\nthe final convulsion that the forces arrayed against slavery were\r\nirresistible, and surrendered it in time to get compensated emancipation.\r\nLook at the monopolists now preying upon the public in every corner of the\r\nland. They are confident that their holdings are impregnable against\r\ndemocracy coming invincibly against them. Look at the great mass of our\r\npopulation, shutting the fresh air out of their houses in order to be\r\ncomfortably warm, and thereby rearing parents--especially mothers--who\r\nunawares are incessantly developing tuberculosis to destroy themselves and\r\ntheir children. Some years hence when resumption by government of its\r\nfunctions now granted to private persons has dispossessed all the\r\nmonopolists, and when every dwelling-house is kept perfectly ventilated\r\nand free from infected air, there will be other wise ones to believe that\r\nhindsight is just the same as foresight, and to inveigh against the\r\nmonopolists and parents just mentioned for their unwonted stupidity and\r\nimprovidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nUNAPPEASABLE ANTAGONISM OF FREE LABOR AND SLAVE LABOR, AND THEIR MORTAL\r\nCOMBAT OVER THE PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow a brief explanation of the antagonism between free and slave labor.\r\nThe expense of his slaves to the farmer is the same whether they are\r\nresting or at work. Sundays, days and even seasons of unfavorable weather,\r\nin long do-nothing intervals succeeding the making and also the gathering\r\nof the crop, they cost him just as much as when he can work them from sun\r\nto sun. But this is not all of his load. The year round he must subsist\r\nthe numerous non-workers in the families of his laborers, whether young,\r\nsuperannuated, or afflicted. Suppose another farmer to be on adjoining\r\nland who can employ laborers just as he wants them, and discharge them as\r\nsoon as he has no further use for them. Do you not perceive that this\r\nfree-labor farmer can produce far more cheaply than the slave farmer? And\r\ndo you not also perceive that if there is a supply of free labor to be had\r\nin a slave country, and it can be got by every farmer _ad libitum_, slaves\r\nmust lose their value as property and be driven to the wall? Free labor\r\nwas kept out of the south by the repugnance of the white laborer to the\r\nnegro. Note also that when the number of slaves had become considerable\r\ntheir owners would naturally combine to protect the market value of their\r\nproperty by preventing the coming in of cheaper labor. This was the real\r\nreason why Virginia and Delaware opposed the extension of the African\r\nslave-trade from 1800 to 1808, and the Confederate States' constitution\r\nrefused to reopen it. Slavery made some headway in the north. But not\r\nfinding there the stimulus of such products as tobacco and cotton, it\r\ncould not become so widespread and deep-seated as to sweep out free labor.\r\nThe latter under favorable conditions commenced the competition in which\r\nit could not fail to win; and in due time slavery died out in the north.\r\nWe especially desire to emphasize the attitude towards extension of\r\nslavery that free labor was bound to take. That it had already ejected\r\nslavery from every other enlightened community will occur to the reader at\r\nonce as weighty proof that the two cannot live together.[23] Think of the\r\nfree worker's suffrage, and you cannot believe that he could long be\r\ninduced to vote for the protection and further spread of a system taking\r\nthe bread out of his own mouth, and degrading him by engendering profound\r\ndisrespect for his class; and then think of the vast and rapidly growing\r\nnumbers of the free laborers of the north, receiving every day great\r\naccessions of foreign immigrants avoiding the south as they would the\r\nplague; think of all these, and you begin to discern what a mighty power\r\nwas rising against slavery.\r\n\r\nThis has brought us to the place where we can properly treat the\r\ncontention for the Territories. Consider their vast area. Remember that\r\nour people have settled thereon in such numbers that thirty-two new States\r\nhave been added to the old thirteen, and others still are to be added.\r\nHere for some generations was land for the landless; the full meaning of\r\nwhich Henry George has made us plainly see. The adventurous and\r\nenterprising of the old States of each section set their faces\r\nthitherward in a constantly swelling stream. Attend to the only material\r\ndifference for us between the northerner and the southerner going west.\r\nEach settler wanted a community like his native one. The northerner had\r\nnot been trained to manage slave labor and property; he did not like it;\r\nhe thought it out of date and vastly inferior to free labor; and he could\r\nnot endure to have himself and family live among negroes, repulsive to him\r\nbecause of unfamiliarity. He had learned from its history in the south\r\nthat wherever slavery established itself it superseded all other labor.\r\nTherefore he would none of it in his new home; and he settled in a\r\nnon-slave community. Of course the southerner, knowing nothing of free\r\nlabor and bred into a love of the slave system, settled among\r\nslaveholders. And so for a generation or two free and slave States were\r\nsteadily added to the union in pairs.\r\n\r\nBut the unsettled lands were diminishing in area. Its population\r\nmultiplying so marvellously, the north felt urgent need for the whole of\r\nthese lands. The great majority of settlers going thence into the\r\nTerritories were farmers. Note some of the more influential classes left\r\nbehind them. The parents, relatives, and friends who wanted them suited in\r\nthe west--this was the largest class of all, and it was of prodigious\r\nintellectual, political, and moral potency. Then the manufacturers of\r\nagricultural implements, and of many articles, all of which the\r\nsoutherners either had their mechanic slaves to make by hand, and of\r\noldtime fashion, or did without; the millers, and many sorts of wholesale\r\nmerchants who had found slave owners poor and the employers of free labor\r\ngood customers; and these manufacturers and merchants were greedy for the\r\nnew markets which they could get only in free States.\r\n\r\nThese are but the merest hints, but they serve somewhat to suggest the\r\nall-powerful motives which at last united the great majority of northern\r\npeople, east and west, in intelligent and inveterate opposition to the\r\nfurther spread of slavery.\r\n\r\nNow look at the southern situation. At the outset, note that his slaves\r\nwere the southerner's only laborers, and practically his only property.\r\nAnd note especially that this property was not only self-supporting, but\r\nit was also the most rapidly self-reproducing that Tom, Dick, and Harry\r\never had in all history. A reliable witness tells this: \"On my father's\r\nplantation an aged negro woman could call together more than one hundred\r\nof her lineal descendants. I saw this old negro dance at the wedding of\r\nher great-granddaughter.\"[24]\r\n\r\nLet me repeat that slaves were not only money-making laborers, but also\r\nthings of valuable property, which of themselves multiplied as dollars do\r\nat compound interest. Let the northern man unfamiliar with slavery try to\r\nunderstand this one of its phases by supposing that he has orchards\r\nabundantly yielding a fruit which is in good demand, and that the trees\r\nplant and tend themselves, gather and store the fruit, set out other\r\norchards, and do all things else necessary to care for the property and\r\nkeep it steadily growing. Such trees with their yearly produce and\r\nprodigious increase--each by an easy organic or natural, and not by a\r\ndifficult artificial, process, relieving the owner from all but the\r\nslightest attention and labor of superintendence--would soon be the only\r\nones in their entire zone of production; bringing it about that all other\r\noccupations and property therein would be dependent upon this main and\r\nreally only industry. Such orchards would be somewhat like the slaves in\r\ntheir automatic production and accumulation, but they would be much\r\ninferior as marketable property in many particulars.\r\n\r\nAlthough the profits of slave-planting were considerable, the greatest\r\nprofit of all was what the master thought of and talked of all the day\r\nlong,--the natural increase of his slaves, as he called it. His negroes\r\nwere far more to him than his land. His planting was the furthest removed\r\nof all from a proper restorative agriculture. Quickly exhausting his new\r\ncleared fields, he looked elsewhere for other virgin soil to wear out. The\r\nnumber of the slaves in the south was growing fast, and the new lands in\r\nthe older slave States were nearly gone. To keep the hens laying the\r\ngolden eggs of natural increase, nests must be found for them on the\r\ncotton, sugar, and rice lands of the Territories. In other words, the area\r\nof slave culture must be extended; for whenever there is no land for a\r\nconsiderable number of our workers, it is evident that we have a surplus\r\nof slaves; and the effect of that will be at the first to lower the market\r\nvalue of our only property, and then gradually to destroy it. So the\r\ninstincts of the southerners whispered in their ears.\r\n\r\nWe hope that we now have helped you to an understanding of the active\r\nprinciples each of free labor and of slave labor; how by reason of them\r\nthe interests of north and south in dividing the public domain were in\r\nirreconcilable conflict; and how it was natural that the free States\r\nshould band together against, and the slave States band together for,\r\nslavery. Thus the country split into two geographical though not political\r\nsections, the political division which ripened later being as yet only\r\nimminent and inchoate. That these sections had been made by deadly war\r\nbetween free labor and slave labor is all that we have to say here. The\r\ndevelopment went further, as we shall explain in the next chapter--all of\r\nit under the propulsion of the two active principles. They were always the\r\nultimate and supreme motors. Often they are not to be seen at all. Still\r\nmore often what they did was disguised. To read the facts of that time\r\naright you must always and everywhere look for their work. Do that\r\npatiently, and you will detect every one of the many controversies over\r\nmatters affecting an interest of either section as such--whether questions\r\napparently of national politics, of morals, or religion, in newspapers,\r\npamphlets, reviews, books, and all the vast contemporary literature, in\r\nthe pulpit, on the platform, and in every place and corner of the entire\r\nland where policy and impolicy or right and wrong were mooted--to be but a\r\npart of one or the other of two great complexes of machinery, each geared\r\nto its particular motor and kept going by its mighty push.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGENESIS, COURSE, AND GOAL OF SOUTHERN NATIONALIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalization is the process by which a nation makes itself. The process\r\nmay be active for a long while without completion, as we see in the case\r\nof Ireland; it may form a nation, but to be overturned and wiped out, as\r\nthe southern confederacy was; or it may find its consummation in such a\r\npowerful one as the United States. The most conspicuous effect of the\r\nprocess we now have in hand is to make one of many communities. But\r\nsometimes a part breaks off from a nation and sets up and maintains its\r\nindependence as a country. Thus a portion of the territory of Mexico was\r\nsettled over from our States, and after a while these settlers tore\r\nthemselves loose from Mexico and became the nation of Texas. We shall tell\r\nyou more fully in another chapter how the separate colonies became\r\nnationalized into the United States, and what we say here of southern\r\nnationalization will illustrate to the reader that important\r\ntransformation, to understand which is of especial moment to us in\r\nexamining the brothers' war. But we must emphasize the characteristic\r\nfeature of the nationalization of the south. I have searched the pages of\r\nhistory in vain for an example like it. The idiosyncrasy is that the south\r\nwas homogeneous in origin, race, language, religion, institutions, and\r\ncustoms with the north, and yet she developed away from the north into a\r\nseparate nation. I have long been accustomed to parallel the case of\r\nIreland's repulsion from Great Britain, but I always had to admit that\r\nthere was dissimilarity in everything except the strong drift towards\r\nindependence and the struggle to win it;[25] for the Irish are largely\r\ndifferent from the English in origin, race, language, religion,\r\ninstitutions, and customs. The more you consider it the more striking\r\nbecomes this uniqueness of southern nationalization. Think of it for a\r\nmoment. Thirteen adjacent colonies; each a dependency of the same nation;\r\nall settled promiscuously from every part and parcel of one mother\r\ncountry, and therefore the settlers rapidly becoming in time more like one\r\nanother everywhere than the English were who at home were clinging to\r\ntheir several localities and dialects; governed alike; standing together\r\nagainst Indians, French, and Spanish, and after a while against the mother\r\ncountry;--where can you find another instance of so many common ties and\r\ntendencies, all prompting incessantly and mightily to union in a political\r\nwhole, which is ever the goal of the nationalizing process. That the\r\ncolonies did grow into a political whole is not at all wonderful to the\r\nhistorical student. The wonder is that after they had done this a number\r\nof them just like the others in the particulars above pointed out, which\r\nfuse adjacent communities into a nation, turn away from the old union and\r\nseek to form one of their own. The southern States all did the same thing\r\nwith such practical unanimity that even the foreigner may know that the\r\nsame cause was at work in every one of them. Manifestly there was a\r\nnationalizing element in them which was not in the others, and which made\r\nthe former homogeneous with one another and heterogeneous to the rest.\r\nAnd that element which differenced the south from the rest of the union so\r\ngreatly that it was, from a time long before either she or the north had\r\nbecome conscious of it, impelling her irresistibly towards an independent\r\nnationality of her own, all of us natives know was the constructive and\r\nplastic principle of her slave industrial and property system.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of the foregoing expatiation to prove to you such a\r\nfamiliar and well-known fact as that slavery parted north and south and\r\ncaused the brothers' war. Its purpose is to arouse you to consider\r\nnationalization, and have you see how it acts according to a will of its\r\nown and not of man, and now and then works out most stupendous results\r\ncontrary to all that mortals deem probabilities. You ought to recognize\r\nthat the forces which produced the Confederate States were just as\r\nall-powerful and opposeless as those which produced the United States;\r\nthat in fact they were exactly the same in kind, that is, the forces of\r\nnationalization.\r\n\r\nTo have you see that even at the time of making the federal constitution\r\nthe south had grown into a pro-slavery section and was far on the road\r\ntowards independence, it is necessary to correct the prevalent opinion\r\nthat there was then below Mason and Dixon's line a very widespread and\r\ninfluential hostility to slavery. The manumission of his slaves by\r\nWashington, the fearless and outspoken opposition to the institution by\r\nJefferson and some other prominent persons, and certain facts indicating\r\nunfavorable sentiment, have been too hastily accepted by even historians\r\nas demonstrations that the opinion is true. Here are the facts which prove\r\nit to be utterly untrue. In 1784, three years before our epochal\r\nconvention assembled, Jefferson, as chairman of an appropriate committee\r\nconsisting besides himself of Chase of Maryland and Howell of Rhode\r\nIsland, reported to congress a plan for the temporary government of the\r\nWest Territory. This region contained not only all the territory that was\r\nsubsequently covered by the famous ordinance of 1787, but such a vast deal\r\nmore that it was proposed to make seventeen States out of the whole.\r\nConsider this provision of the report, the suggestion and work of\r\nJefferson:\r\n\r\n    \"That after the year 1800 of the christian era there shall be neither\r\n    slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of said States, otherwise\r\n    than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been\r\n    convicted to have been personally guilty.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the report was taken up by congress, Spaight of North Carolina made a\r\nmotion to strike out the provision just quoted, and it was seconded by\r\nReed of South Carolina. On the vote North Carolina was divided; but all\r\nthe other southern States represented, to wit, Maryland, Virginia, and\r\nSouth Carolina, voted for the motion, the colleagues of Jefferson of\r\nVirginia and those of Chase of Maryland out-voting these two southerners\r\nstanding by the provision. All the northern States represented, which were\r\nthe then four New England States, New York, and Pennsylvania, voted for\r\nthe provision. But as it failed to get the necessary seven States it was\r\nnot retained.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that at the close of the Revolutionary war the interest of\r\nthe south in and her attachment to slavery were so great that by her\r\nrepresentatives in congress she appears to be almost unanimous against the\r\nproposal to keep the institution from extending.\r\n\r\nThis action of the south shows that both Virginia in ceding that part of\r\nthe West Territory which was three years afterwards by the ordinance of\r\n1787 put under Jefferson's provision which had been rejected when it had\r\nbeen proposed for all the territory, and the south in voting unanimously\r\nfor the ordinance, were not actuated by hostility to slavery. The soil of\r\nthe territory north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi to which the\r\nordinance applied probably may have been thought by Virginians unsuited to\r\ntobacco, the then sole crop upon which slave labor could be lucratively\r\nused. Be that as it may, that the southern States in subsequent cessions\r\nmade not long afterwards guarded against slavery prohibition must be kept\r\nin mind. When they are, it is proved that always from the time that\r\nJefferson's provision failed to carry in 1784, as has been told above, the\r\nprevalent sentiment of the southern people overwhelmingly favored slavery.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate from later times. Writers who claim that the south,\r\nmeditating secession, purposed to reopen the African slave-trade, adduce\r\nsome relevant evidence which at first flush appears to be very weighty, if\r\nnot convincing. They show that A. H. Stephens of Georgia, who afterwards\r\nbecame vice-president of the confederacy, in 1859 used language indicating\r\nthat he thought it vital to the south, in her struggle to extend the area\r\nof slavery, to get more Africans; and they further show similar utterances\r\nmade at the time by certain papers and other prominent men of the south.\r\n\r\nBut the constitution of the Confederate States, adopted in 1861, contains\r\nthis provision:\r\n\r\n    \"The importation of negroes of the African race from any foreign\r\n    country other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the\r\n    United States of America is hereby forbidden, and congress is required\r\n    to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the same.\"\r\n\r\nOf course this solemn act unanimously voted for by the members of the\r\ncongress, Stephens being one of them, counts incalculably more in weight\r\nto prove that predominant southern sentiment was against reopening the\r\nAfrican slave-trade, than the counter evidence just stated. Likewise all\r\nthat Washington, Jefferson, and other of their contemporaries may have\r\ndone or said against slavery is outweighed by the contemporary pro-slavery\r\nlegislation and measures dictated by the south. It is very probable that\r\nduring the time we are now contemplating anti-slavery men were really as\r\nfew in the south as union men were after the first blood spilled in the\r\nbrothers' war.\r\n\r\nRecall the three compromises between north and south, mentioned above, by\r\nwhich the union was formed, and you will understand that the fathers were\r\npreaching but to stones when they impugned slavery. And at this point\r\nmeditate the language of Madison in the historic convention, which shows\r\nthat he saw accurately even then the permanence of slavery, and the\r\nunequivocal geographical division it had made. He was discussing the\r\napprehension of the small States, New Jersey, Delaware, and Rhode Island,\r\nthat under the union proposed they would be absorbed by the larger\r\nadjacent States. He affirmed there was no such danger; and that the only\r\ndanger arose from the antagonism between the slave and the non-slave\r\nsections. To avert this danger he proposed to arm north and south each\r\nwith defensive power against the other by conceding to the former the\r\nsuperiority it would get in one branch of the federal legislature by\r\nreason of its greater population if the members thereof came in equal\r\nnumbers from every State, large or small, and at the same time giving the\r\nsouth superiority in the other branch by allowing it increased\r\nrepresentation therein for all its slaves counted as free inhabitants.\r\nThis prepares you for the language which we now give from the report, and\r\nwhich we would have you meditate:\r\n\r\n    \"He [Madison] admitted that every peculiar interest, whether in any\r\n    class of citizens, or any description of States, ought to be secured\r\n    as far as possible. Wherever there is danger of attack, there ought to\r\n    be given a constitutional power of defence. But he contended that the\r\n    States were divided into different interests, not by their difference\r\n    of size, but by other circumstances; the most material of which\r\n    resulted partly from climate, but principally from the effects of\r\n    their having or not having slaves. These causes concurred in forming\r\n    the great division of interests in the United States. It did not lie\r\n    between the large and small States. It lay between the northern and\r\n    southern; and if any defensive power were necessary, it ought to be\r\n    mutually given to these two interests. He was so strongly impressed\r\n    with this important truth, that he had been casting about in his mind\r\n    for some expedient that would answer the purpose. The one which had\r\n    occurred was that, instead of proportioning the votes of the States in\r\n    both branches to their respective number of inhabitants, computing the\r\n    slaves in the ratio of 5 to 3, they should be represented in one\r\n    branch according to the number of free inhabitants only; and in the\r\n    other according to their whole number, counting the slaves as free. By\r\n    this arrangement the southern scale would have the advantage in one\r\n    house and the northern in the other.\"\r\n\r\nMadison meant to say that the great danger of disunion was that--we\r\nemphasize his statement by repeating and italicizing the essential\r\npart--\"_the States were divided into different interests ... principally\r\nfrom the effects of their having or not having slaves. These causes\r\nconcurred in forming the great division of interests in the United\r\nStates_.\"\r\n\r\nHow truly he expresses the economical antagonism of the southern and\r\nnorthern States, although he hints nothing of the nationalizing tendency\r\nof the former which was bound in time to show itself as one of \"the\r\neffects of their having slaves.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Mr. Adams overeulogizes the political instinct and\r\nprophecy evinced by Madison at this tune. I cannot see that the latter\r\ndoes anything more than merely recognize the fact then plain to all. Note\r\nas proof this other passage quoted by Mr. Adams from Madison in the\r\nconvention, in which the material words are given by me in italics: \"_It\r\nseems now well understood_ that the real difference of interests lies, not\r\nbetween the large and small, but between the northern and southern\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nIf the historical expert but duly consider the important facts marshalled\r\nin the foregoing he must find them to be incontrovertible proofs that in\r\n1787, when our fathers were making the federal constitution, and for some\r\nyears before, southern nationalization was not simply inchoate, but that\r\nit was growing so rapidly its course could be stopped in but one way; that\r\nis, by the extirpation of slavery, which was both its germ and active\r\nprinciple. This was before the invention of the gin. After that the lower\r\nsouth and west quickly added a vast territory to the empire of slavery,\r\nand southern nationalization received throughout its whole domain a new, a\r\nlasting, and a far more powerful impetus. And when the cotton States, as\r\nwe call them, had really developed their industry, the southern\r\nconfederacy was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this nationalization is indisputable. When the confederates\r\norganized their government at Montgomery, everybody looking on felt and\r\nsaid that a new nation was born. Why ignore what is so plain and so\r\nimportant? Thus Mr. Adams most graphically contrasts the two widely\r\ndifferent northern and southern civilizations which were flourishing side\r\nby side,[26] and with a momentary inadvertence he ascribes national\r\ndevelopment only to the civilization north of the Potomac and Ohio, and\r\ntreats State sovereignty as anti-national. The fact is that a\r\nnationalization, the end of which was southern independence, had been long\r\nactive, as we have perhaps too copiously shown, and the doctrine of State\r\nsovereignty was really nothing but its instrument, nurse, and organ. Every\r\nsouthern State that invoked State sovereignty and seceded was shortly\r\nafterwards found in the new southern nation. Had that nation prospered,\r\nthe doctrine would soon have died a natural death even in the confederacy.\r\nNationalization is the cardinal fact, the _vis major_, on each side. The\r\nfree-labor nationalization of the north, purposing to appropriate and hold\r\nthe continent, fashioned a self-preserving weapon of the assumption that\r\nthe fathers made by the constitution an indissoluble union; the slave\r\nnationalization of the south, purposing to appropriate and hold that part\r\nof the continent suiting its special staples, assumed that the fathers\r\npreserved State sovereignty intact in the federal union.\r\n\r\nThe closer you look the plainer you will see that the United States held\r\nwithin itself two nationalities so inveterately hostile to each other that\r\ngemination was long imminent before it actually occurred. The hostility\r\nbetween the statesmen of Virginia and her daughter States and those of the\r\nnorth, and especially New England,--Jefferson on one side and Hamilton and\r\nAdams on the other,--the party following the former calling itself\r\nrepublican and that following the latter calling itself federalist, was\r\nreally rooted in the hostility of the two nationalities; and a survival of\r\nthis hostility is now unpleasantly vigorous between many northern and\r\nsouthern writers and lecturers, each class claiming too much of the good\r\nin our past history for its own section and ascribing too much of the bad\r\nto the other. As a lady friend, a native of Michigan who has lived in the\r\nsouth some years, remarked to me not long since, as soon as one going\r\nnorth crosses the Ohio he feels that he has entered another country;\r\nbehind him is a land of corn-pone, biscuit, three cooked meals a day, and\r\nhouses tended untidily by darkey servants; before him is a land of bakers'\r\nbread of wheat, where there is hardly more than one warm meal a day, and\r\nthe houses are kept as neat as a pin by the mothers and daughters of the\r\nfamily. Greater public activity of the county while there is hardly any at\r\nall of its subdivisions, the representative system almost everywhere in\r\nthe municipalities, no government by town-meeting and no direct\r\nlegislation except occasionally, a most crude and feeble rural common\r\nschool system, distinguish and characterize the south; buoyant energy of\r\nthe township in public affairs, government by town-meeting instead of by\r\nrepresentatives, a common-school system energetically improving,\r\ndistinguish and characterize the north. The manners and customs of\r\nsoutherners are peculiar. To use an expressive cant word, they \"gush\" more\r\nthan northeners. In cars and public meetings they give their seats to\r\nladies, while northerners do not. Southerners are quick to return a blow\r\nfor insulting words, and in the consequent rencounter they are prone to\r\nuse deadly weapons; while northerners are generally as averse to personal\r\nviolence as were the Greeks and Romans in their palmiest time. The\r\nbattle-cry of the confederates was a wild cheering--a fox-hunt yell, as we\r\ncalled it; that of the union soldiers was huzza! huzza! huzza! From the\r\nbeginning to the end, even at Franklin and Bentonville, and at Farmville,\r\njust two days before I was surrendered at Appomattox, the confederates\r\nalways, if possible, took the offensive; the union soldiers were like the\r\nsturdy Englishmen, whose tactics from Hastings to Waterloo have generally\r\nbeen defensive.\r\n\r\nThis battle yell, this impetuous charge after charge until the field is\r\nwon, marks the fighting of the Americans at King's Mountain--all of them\r\nsoutherners; and it is another weighty proof of the early coalescence of\r\nthe south as a community on its way to independence.\r\n\r\nMany other contrasts could be suggested. Think over the foregoing. They\r\nare the respective effects of two different causes,--a free-labor\r\nnationalization above, and a slave-labor nationalization below, Mason and\r\nDixon's line. The latter--its origin and course--is the especial subject\r\nof this chapter. I believe that the proofs marshalled above demonstrate to\r\nthe fair and unprejudiced reader that southern nationalization commenced\r\nbefore the making of the federal constitution, and afterwards went\r\ndirectly on, gathering force and power all the while, until it culminated\r\nin\r\n\r\n  \"A storm-cradled nation that fell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAMERICAN NATIONALIZATION, AND HOW IT MADE THE BOND OF UNION STRONGER AND\r\nSTRONGER\r\n\r\n\r\nGreece was going down in her contest with Macedon when she gave the world\r\nto come the Achaean league, the first historical example of full-grown\r\nfederation. As Freeman says of such a federal government: \"Its perfect\r\nform is a late growth of a very high state of political culture.\"[27] This\r\nhistorian thus summarizes its essentials:\r\n\r\n    \"Two requisites seem necessary to constitute federal government in\r\n    this its most perfect form. On the one hand, each of the members of\r\n    the union must be wholly independent in those matters which concern\r\n    each member only. On the other hand, all must be subject to a common\r\n    power in those matters which concern the whole body of members\r\n    collectively.\"[28]\r\n\r\nNo author has yet shown a better-considered and more accurate appreciation\r\nof the benefits to different communities of federal union. But the\r\nislander could not conceive--even at the centre of the British empire\r\nspread over the world--the advanced phase of Anglo-Saxon federation in\r\nAmerica and Australia, which for want of a better name we may call, using\r\na grand word of our fathers, continental federation.\r\n\r\nAnd Americans of every generation have misunderstood the true nature of\r\nour union, and especially how it was made and how it could be unmade. The\r\nfathers were as much mistaken as to the real authorship of the\r\ndeclaration of independence, the articles of confederation, and the\r\nfederal constitution, as Burke and many people of his time were as to the\r\ntrue causes of the French revolution, or as the brothers were as to those\r\nof their war. In all that the fathers did they were sure that they acted\r\nas agents solely of their respective colonies or States, which they\r\nbelieved to be independent and sovereign. Therefore they maintained that\r\nthe authorship of the three great documents just mentioned was that of the\r\nseparate States, when in truth it was that of the union. When the latter,\r\nwhich had been long forming its rudiments, came into something like\r\nconsciousness, it at once spurred our fathers to make the declaration of\r\nindependence. The declaration corresponds to the later ordinances of\r\nsecession. And this union, gathering strength, led our fathers to make the\r\nold confederation; and its articles and the belonging government are\r\nclosely paralleled by the constitution of the Confederate States and its\r\nbelonging government. As southern nationalization brought forth the\r\nsouthern confederacy, so it was American nationalization that caused\r\nsecession from England, the declaration of independence, and the\r\nconfederation which won the Revolutionary war. To summarize the foregoing:\r\nSouthern nationalization evolved the southern union, and American\r\nnationalization evolved the American union. The fathers, with the usual\r\nundiscernment of contemporaries, by a most natural _hysteron proteron_\r\nconceived the latter union to be the work, product, and result of the\r\nconstitution. In the intersectional contention, the south accepted the\r\nmistakes of the fathers and rested her cause upon them, and the north,\r\ninstead of correcting them, substituted a huge and glaring mistake of her\r\nown. Advocating the maintenance of the constitution over all the States,\r\nshe sought to refute the doctrine of State sovereignty urged by the south\r\nwith the arguments of those who had opposed the adoption of the federal\r\nconstitution. Patrick Henry and Nathan Dane--we omit the others--argued\r\nthat the constitution, if ratified, would really wipe out State lines and\r\nmake the central government supreme in authority over the States, and\r\nactually sovereign. Could the people of the thirteen States have been made\r\nto believe this, they would have unanimously rejected the instrument.\r\nWashington, Hamilton, Madison, and many others competent to advise, stood\r\nin solid phalanx on the other side, and the people were convinced by them\r\nthat adoption would have no such effect. They decided that the arguments\r\nwere not good, and the constitution was ratified. But the discredited\r\narguments were afterwards, by a very queer psychological process, taken up\r\nby Story, Webster, and a great host, and paraded as unanswerable\r\nrefutation of the doctrine of State sovereignty, and demonstration that by\r\nthe constitution the United States had acquired absolute supremacy over\r\nthe different States.[29] At a later place we will try to show you how\r\nWebster's glory outshines that of every other actor, except Lincoln, in\r\nthe great struggle between north and south. But here we must emphasize\r\nhow, when supporting the fallacies of Patrick Henry and Nathan Dane, he\r\nmet the one real and signal defeat of his life, to which the drubbing he\r\nreceived from Binney in the Girard College case was a small affair--a\r\ndefeat none the less signal because at the time, and long afterwards, it\r\nwas and still is crowned as a glorious victory by thousands upon\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nThe force-bill had just been introduced into the senate of the United\r\nStates. It provided for the collection of the revenue in defiance of the\r\nnullification ordinance of South Carolina. The next day, January 22, 1833,\r\nCalhoun offered in that body his famous resolutions, embodying his\r\ndoctrine of nullification, under which he justified the ordinance just\r\nmentioned. The 16th of the next month, Webster discussed the two cardinal\r\nones of these resolutions at length. As he summarized them, they affirmed:\r\n\r\n    \"1. That the political system under which we live, and under which\r\n    congress is now assembled, is a compact, to which the people of the\r\n    several States, as separate and sovereign communities, are the\r\n    parties.\r\n\r\n    2. That these sovereign parties have a right to judge, each for\r\n    itself, of any alleged violation of the constitution by congress; and\r\n    in case of such violation, to choose, each for itself, its own mode\r\n    and measure of redress.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not long before contemplated making an address to the public in\r\nanswer to Calhoun's pro-nullification letter to Governor Hamilton in the\r\nform of a letter from himself to Kent; and it cannot be doubted that he\r\nhad got himself ready for this; nor can it be doubted that in the\r\ntwenty-five days' interim he had not only worked over and adapted the\r\nunused materials of the address mentioned, but he had most diligently made\r\nspecial preparation for his speech--in short, it may be assumed that he\r\nhad bestowed upon the subject of the resolutions the most searching\r\nexamination and profound meditation of which, with his superhuman powers,\r\nhe was capable. In spite of all his conscientious labors, as I am now\r\nespecially concerned to impress upon you, he injured and set back the\r\ncause of the union by defending it with answerable arguments--nay, rather,\r\nwith arguments helping the other side.\r\n\r\nAt the outset he severely and sternly rebukes two terms of Calhoun's, one\r\nbeing the use of _constitutional compact_ for _constitution_, and the\r\nother being _the accession of a State to the constitution_. These terms\r\nare utterly impermissible, and are to be scouted. If we accept them, _we\r\nmust acquiesce in the monstrous conclusions which the author of the\r\nresolutions draws from them_. That is really what Webster says. Note the\r\nconfident positiveness of his pertinent language, some of which we\r\nsubjoin:\r\n\r\n    \"It is easy, quite easy, to see why the honorable gentleman has used\r\n    it [constitutional compact] in these resolutions. He cannot open the\r\n    book, and look upon our written frame of government, without seeing\r\n    that it is called a _constitution_. This may well be appalling to him.\r\n    It threatens his whole doctrine of compact, and its darling\r\n    derivatives, nullification and secession, with instant confutation.\r\n    Because, if he admits our instrument of government to be a\r\n    _constitution_, then, for that very reason, it is not a compact\r\n    between sovereigns; a constitution of government and a compact between\r\n    sovereign powers being things essentially unlike in their very\r\n    natures, and incapable of ever being the same.\r\n\r\n    We know no more of a constitutional compact between sovereign powers\r\n    than we know of a _constitutional_ indenture of copartnership, a\r\n    _constitutional_ bill of exchange. But we know what the _constitution_\r\n    is; we know what the bond of our union and the security of our\r\n    liberties is; and we mean to maintain and to defend it, in its plain\r\n    sense and unsophisticated meaning.\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough of the exorcism of that malignant spirit, constitutional\r\ncompact. Now as to the other malignant spirit. Webster says:\r\n\r\n    \"The first resolution declares that the people of the several States\r\n    '_acceded_' to the constitution, or to the constitutional compact, as\r\n    it is called. This word 'accede,' not found either in the constitution\r\n    itself, or in the ratification of it by any one of the States, has\r\n    been chosen for use here, doubtless, not without a well-considered\r\n    purpose.\r\n\r\n    The natural converse of _accession_ is _secession_; and, therefore,\r\n    when it is stated that the people of the States acceded to the union,\r\n    it may be more plausibly argued that they may secede from it. _If in\r\n    adopting the constitution, nothing was done but acceding to a compact,\r\n    nothing would seem necessary to break it up, but to secede from the\r\n    same compact._ But the term is wholly out of place.... The people of\r\n    the United States have used no such form of expression in establishing\r\n    the present government. They do not say that they _accede_ to a\r\n    league, but they declare that they _ordain and establish_ a\r\n    constitution. Such are the very words of the instrument itself; and in\r\n    all the States, without exception, the language used by their\r\n    conventions was, that they '_ratified_ the constitution;' some of them\r\n    employing the additional words 'assented to' and 'adopted,' but all of\r\n    them 'ratifying.'\"\r\n\r\nNote that I have italicized in the quotation certain admissions of\r\nWebster, which, in case his premises should be disproved, concede the\r\ncause to his adversary. And we will now tell you how Calhoun did disprove\r\nthose premises.\r\n\r\nHe showed that Webster himself had in a senate speech called the\r\nconstitution a _constitutional compact_; and that President Washington, in\r\nhis official announcement to congress, described North Carolina as\r\n_acceding_ to the union by the ratification she had at last made of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAs to these two points Calhoun further sustained himself with\r\nunquestionable authority and also argument inconfutable by one who, like\r\nWebster, did not find the true _ratio decidendi_, that is, the effect of\r\nevolution to bring forth the nation.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Calhoun's answer will be considered a little later. But what\r\nof it has already been given covers the essentials of the controversy. In\r\nsupporting his proposition that the States were sovereign when they made\r\nthe constitution, and kept their entire sovereignty intact afterwards, he\r\nwas too strong for his antagonist. And yet had his knowledge of the facts\r\nbeen fuller, how much better he could have done. He could have quoted from\r\nall the great men who made the constitution and secured its ratification\r\nlanguage, in which _accede_ is used again and again in the same sense as\r\nit is in his resolutions.\r\n\r\nLikewise, he could have quoted language in which they designated the\r\nconstitution as a compact or something synonymous. Madison--to mention\r\nonly one of many instances--advocating ratification in the Virginia\r\nconvention, called the constitution \"a government of _a federal nature_,\r\nconsisting of _many coequal sovereignties_.\" What an effective _argumentum\r\nad hominem_ could Calhoun have found in the provision of the constitution\r\nof the State of Webster, to wit: that Massachusetts is free, sovereign,\r\nand independent, retaining every power which she has not expressly\r\ndelegated to the United States.[30]\r\n\r\nWebster also made blunders in construing the context of the constitution,\r\nas well as the clauses specially involved, in contrasting the constitution\r\nwith the articles of confederation, and in his reading of our\r\nconstitutional history. These blunders were exhaustively, ably,\r\nrelentlessly exposed.\r\n\r\nWe who are trained either in forensic or parliamentary debate well know\r\nthe conquering and demolishing reply. Although, as we have just shown,\r\nCalhoun's reply could have been far more effective than it really was,\r\nstill its success and triumph were so evident that when he closed, John\r\nRandolph, who had heard it, wanted a hat obstructing his sight removed, so\r\nthat, as he said, he might see \"Webster die, muscle by muscle.\"\r\n\r\nMaster the question at issue, and read the two speeches as impartially as\r\nyou strive to read the discussion of AEschines and Demosthenes, and if you\r\nare qualified to judge of debate between intellectual giants you must\r\nadmit that Webster was driven from every inch of ground chosen by him as\r\nhis very strongest, and which he confidently believed that he could hold\r\nagainst the world.\r\n\r\nYet the union men, who were hosts in the north and numerous even in the\r\nsouth at that time, accepted Webster's speech as the bible of their\r\npolitical faith, and as its reward ennobled him with the pre-eminent title\r\nof Expounder of the Constitution. They ignored, or they never learned of,\r\nthe pulverizing refutation. But the State-rights men and the south\r\ngenerally understood. Webster also understood. He did not make any real\r\nrejoinder. And his subsequent utterances are in harmony with the\r\nState-rights doctrine to which Calhoun seems to have converted him.[31] I\r\nfancy that with that rare humor which was one of his shining gifts, he\r\ndubbed himself in his secret meditations, \"Expounder because not\r\nexpounding.\" Later I shall tell you how Webster builded better than he\r\nknew, and that there was, after all, in the speech that which fully\r\njustifies the worship it received from the union men.\r\n\r\nBut there is something else pertinent to be learned here. That the north\r\ngenerally found out only what Webster said in the debate for his side, and\r\nnever even heard of what was said on the other, and that the south became\r\nat once familiar with both speeches, proves that each section had already\r\nformed its own belonging and independent public, and that the southern\r\npublic kept attentive watch upon all affairs of fact or opinion\r\ninteresting the other, while the northern public knew hardly anything at\r\nall of the south. A large percentage of the southern leaders had studied\r\nin northern schools and colleges. In this and many other ways they had\r\nbeen instructed as to the north. Such instruction contributed very greatly\r\nto southern supremacy in the federal government until the election of\r\nLincoln. We can now see that the powers in charge, as a part of their\r\nwork, made the great northern public, which, as Lincoln observed, was to\r\nbe the savior of the union, stop its ears to all anti-union sentiments or\r\narguments. How else can you understand it that the ante-bellum notices of\r\nWebster, the memoir by Everett, the different utterances of Choate, and\r\nmany, many other sketches, are so utterly dumb as to Calhoun's great\r\nreply? And is not the same dumbness of Curtis, Von Holst, and McMaster,\r\nwriting after the war, due to the survival in the north of the old\r\nconstraint? a constraint so powerful that, while Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge, in\r\n1883, did concede just a little to Calhoun, he stopped far short of the\r\nfull justice that I believe he would now render were he to traverse the\r\nground again.\r\n\r\nWe must now go beyond what we have already hinted, and show you plainly\r\nhow both the union men and the State-rights men assumed untenable\r\npremises, and how the south, maintaining a cause foredoomed, vanquished in\r\nthe forum of discussion her adversary, maintaining the side which fate had\r\ndecreed must win. In no other way can the reader be better made to\r\nunderstand the incalculable potency of the forces which preserved the\r\nAmerican union after its orators and advocates had all been discomfited;\r\nand in no other way can he better learn what principles are to be invoked\r\nif he would grasp the real essence of the union.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize the material and cardinal mistake of the union men, thus\r\nphrased by Webster in the speech we have discussed: \"Whether the\r\nconstitution be a compact between States in their sovereign capacities, is\r\na question which must be mainly argued from what is contained in the\r\ninstrument itself.\"\r\n\r\nThis was to abandon inexpugnable ground. That ground was the great body of\r\npertinent facts, known to all, which begun the making of the union before\r\nthe declaration of independence, and which, from that time on to the very\r\nhour that Webster was speaking, had been making the union stronger and\r\nmore perfect. He ought to have contended that a nation grows; that it\r\ncannot be made, or be at all modified, even by a constitution. Any\r\nconstitution is its creature, not its creator.\r\n\r\nHow weak he was when he invoked construction of the federal constitution\r\nas the main umpire. That constitution had been always construed against\r\nhim. The three departments of the federal government had each uniformly\r\ntreated it as a compact between sovereign States; and they kept this up\r\nuntil the brothers' war broke out. Mr. Stephens, in his great\r\ncompilation,[32] demonstrates this unanswerably. But the State-rights men\r\nhad a still greater strength than even this, if the question be conceded\r\nto be one of construction. As the author of the Republic of Republics\r\nshows by a mountain of proofs, the illustrious draftsmen of the\r\nconstitution and their contemporaries who finally got the constitution\r\nadopted--all the people, high and low, who favored the cause--declared at\r\nthe time that the sovereignty of the States would remain unimpaired after\r\nadoption.[33]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the generation that drafted and adopted the constitution, and\r\nall the succeeding ones who had lived under it, agreed that the States\r\nwere sovereign.\r\n\r\nHow could even Webster talk these facts out of existence? At every stage\r\nof the intersectional debate the cause of the south supporting State\r\nsovereignty became stronger. And there were great hosts at the north who\r\nunderstood the record as the south did; and, while they hoped and prayed\r\nthat separation would never come, they conscientiously conceded State\r\nsovereignty to the full. It seems to me to be the fact that, although the\r\nfederal soldiers cherished deep love for the union, a very great majority\r\nof the more intelligent among them did not long keep at its height the\r\nemotion excited by the attack on Fort Sumter, and soon settled back into\r\ntheir former creed, holding, because of the reasons summarized above, the\r\nStates to be sovereign; and while they thought it supreme folly in the\r\nsouth to set up the confederacy, they still believed that to do so was\r\nbut the exercise of an indubitable right of the States creating it. From\r\nwhat I saw at the time, and the many proofs that appeared to accumulate\r\nupon me afterwards, this explains the unprecedented panic with which the\r\nfederal army abandoned the field at the First Manassas. Consider just a\r\nmoment. The federal army, giving the confederates a complete surprise,\r\nturns their position and drives them back in rout. The confederates make\r\nan unexpected stand, fight for some hours, and at last, assuming the\r\noffensive, win the field. The troops on each side practically all raw\r\nvolunteers, very much alike in race and character. But the federals had\r\nmuch more than two to one engaged, as is demonstrated by the fact that the\r\nconfederates had only twenty-five regiments of infantry in action, and\r\nthey took prisoners from fifty-five. The more one who, like me, observed\r\nmuch of the war, thinks it over, the more clearly he sees that the flight\r\nfrom Manassas is not to be explained because of the superior courage and\r\nstamina of the southern soldiers. I believe that the union men, observing\r\nhow brave and death-defying their brothers on the other side were in\r\nfacing disaster that seemed irretrievable and odds irresistible, at last\r\nbecame convinced that these brothers, defending home and firesides, were\r\nright, and that they themselves, invading an inviolably sovereign State,\r\nwere heinously wrong; and thus awakened conscience made cowards of all\r\nthese gallant men. And it is thoroughly established, I believe, that\r\neverywhere in the first engagements of the war, the southern volunteers,\r\nif they were commanded by a fighter, showed far more spirit and stomach\r\nthan their adversaries. In the amicable meetings, often occurring upon the\r\npicket line, when we confederates would with good humor ask the union men\r\nhow it was that we won so many fights, it was a stereotyped reply of the\r\nlatter, \"Why, you are fighting for your country and we only for $13 a\r\nmonth.\" It was but natural that, by reason of what has been told in the\r\nforegoing, the south unanimously, and a very large number at the north,\r\nshould believe any State could under its reserved powers rightfully secede\r\nfrom the union whenever and for whatever cause it pleased.\r\n\r\nWe see now what the angry brothers did not see. The absolute sovereignty\r\nof the States, and the right of secession both _de facto_ and _de jure_\r\ncould have been conceded, and at the same time the war for the union\r\njustified. The unionists could well have said to the south:\r\n\r\n    \"Your independence is too great a menace to our interests to be\r\n    tolerated, and the high duty of self-defence commands that we resist\r\n    to the death. The _status quo_ is better for us all. Now that you have\r\n    set up for yourself, we must tell you, sadly but firmly, that if you\r\n    do not come back voluntarily, we must resort to coercion,--not under\r\n    the constitution, for you have thrown that off, but under the law of\r\n    nations to which you have just subjected yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who of all southerners has given State sovereignty its most\r\nlearned and able defence--Sage, the author of \"The Republic of\r\nRepublics\"--says: \"To coerce a state is unconstitutional; but it is\r\nequally true that the precedent of coercing states is established, and\r\nthat it is defensible under the law of nations.\"[34]\r\n\r\nTo have received the confederate commissioners as representing an\r\nindependent nation, and made demand that the seceding States return to the\r\nunion, would have been a far stronger theory than that on which the war\r\nwas avowedly waged; for it would have taken from the south that\r\nsuperiority in the argument which had given her great prestige in Europe,\r\nand even in the north. And lastly, under the law of nations, the federal\r\ngovernment, after coercing the seceding States back, would have had--even\r\naccording to the theory of State rights as maintained in the\r\nsouth--perfectly legitimate power to abolish slavery. The statement that\r\nemancipation was \"sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by\r\nthe constitution, upon military necessity,\" protests so much that one sees\r\nthat the highly conscientious man hesitated and doubted. And well may he\r\nhave doubted; for what warrant can be found in the constitution for\r\ndestroying that property which it solemnly engaged to defend and protect\r\nas a condition precedent of its adoption?--that is, if the southern States\r\nwere still in the union and under the constitution, as was claimed by all\r\nwho justified the proclamation? But if the southern States had gone out of\r\nthe union, they had revoked their ratification and had thrown away all the\r\nprotection of slavery given by the constitution; and while the\r\nconstitution did not direct how the federal government should act in the\r\nmatter, the law of nations gave full and ample directions. Its authority\r\nwas not stinted nor hampered by any rights recognized in the constitution\r\nas reserved to the States under it. The subsequent amendment, imposed as a\r\ncondition of reconstruction, shows that the people of the north seriously\r\nquestioned if slavery had been abolished by the proclamation and its\r\nenforcement by the union armies.\r\n\r\nBut this, strong as it was, would not have been the true theory. The true\r\ntheory--the real fact--is that at the outbreak of the brothers' war, and\r\nlong before, the States had become more closely connected than the\r\nSiamese Twins,--indissolubly united as integral parts of the same\r\norganism, like the different trunks of the Banyan tree; and while the\r\nsouthern nationalization was opposing the union forces with might and\r\nmain, it was really but an excrescence, with roots far more shallow than\r\nthose of the American union--a parasite like the mistletoe, growing upon\r\nthe American body politic, fated to die of itself if not destroyed by its\r\nfell foe. For, as we have explained, the sole motor of this southern\r\nnationalization--slavery--could no more maintain itself permanently\r\nagainst free labor than the handloom could stand against the steam-loom,\r\nor the draft-horse can much longer compete with artificial traction power.\r\n\r\nNow let us rapidly set in array the stronger supports of this true theory.\r\nWe should start with the impulse to combine which adjacency always gives\r\nto communities of the same origin; and external compression and joint\r\ninterest to those of diverse origin, as we see in the case of the Swiss.\r\nHow clearly does our great American sociologist trace the effect of this\r\nimpulse in ancient society. First a body of consanguinei grows into a\r\ngens; after a while, neighboring gentes of the same stock-language form a\r\ntribe; then neighboring tribes, as some of the Iroquois and Aztecs, form a\r\nconfederacy. At this point the development of the American Indians was\r\narrested by the coming of the whites. \"A coalescence of tribes into a\r\nnation had not occurred in any case in any part of America,\" says the\r\ngreat authority.[35] But we can easily understand what would have occurred\r\nhad the Indians been left to themselves. They would have passed out of the\r\nnomadic state into settlements of fixed abodes, local and geographical\r\npolitical divisions evolving from the old gentes and tribes, the\r\ncontiguous ones often uniting. History furnishes many examples of\r\nneighboring communities coalescing into nations. One of the most\r\nremarkable of all is the environment which has constrained peoples of four\r\ndifferent languages to coalesce into the little Swiss nation. Turning away\r\nfrom prehistoric times and also ancient history, let the student\r\nre-enforce the case of the Swiss, just alluded to, with the modern\r\nnation-making in Italy and Germany. These few of the many instances which\r\ncan be given show how and what sorts of adjacent communities are prone to\r\nco-operate or combine for a common purpose, and how such combination\r\ndevelops at last an irresistible proneness to national union. Drops of\r\nliquid in proximity to one another on a plane may long maintain each their\r\nindependent forms; but bring them into actual contact, and presto! all the\r\nglobules have coalesced into a single mass. After the belonging part of\r\nthe evolutionary science of sociology has been fully developed--which time\r\ndoes not seem very far off--the subject will receive adequate\r\nillustration. Then all of us will understand that, many years before\r\nAlamance and Lexington, the colonies, in their defence of themselves\r\nagainst the Indians and the French, in their intercommunication over\r\ninnumerable matters of joint interest, in the beneficent example of the\r\nIroquois confederacy and the advice of our fathers by the Iroquois, as\r\nearly as 1755, to form one of the colonies similar to their own,[36] and\r\nin many other things that can be suggested, were steadily becoming one\r\npeople, and more and more predisposed to political union. We shall also\r\nsee, much more clearly than we do yet, that the Revolutionary war, by\r\nkeeping them some years under a general government, imparted new and\r\npowerful impetus to the nationalizing forces, which were working none the\r\nless surely because unobserved. Our lesson will be completely learned\r\nwhen we recognize that about the time the war with the mother country\r\ncommenced the globules, that is, the separate colonies, had become\r\nactually a quasi-political whole,--a stage of evolution so near to that of\r\nfull nationality that it is hard to distinguish the two. It seems to me\r\nthat the nation had come at least into rudimentary existence when the\r\ndeclaration of independence was made. Surely from that time on something\r\nwondrously like a _de facto_ national union of the old colonies grew\r\nrapidly, and became stronger and stronger; and this to me is the\r\nsufficient and only explanation of the seismic popular upheaval that\r\ndisplaced the weaker government under the articles of confederation with\r\none endowed by the federal constitution with ample powers to administer\r\nthe affairs of the nation now beginning to stir with consciousness. And\r\nyet so blind was everybody that in 1787 the delegates and their\r\nconstituents all believed the convention to be the organ of the States,\r\nwhen in truth it was the organ of the new American nation. Prompted by a\r\nself-preserving instinct, this nationality deftly kept itself hid. Had it\r\nbeen disclosed, the federal constitution could not have been adopted; and\r\nhad a suspicion of it come a few years later, there would have been\r\nsuccessful secession. And so each State dreamed on its sweet dream of\r\ndominion until the call to the stars and stripes rang through the north.\r\nThen its people began darkly and dimly to discern the nationalization\r\nwhich had united the States and become a hoop of adamant to hold the union\r\nforever stanch. Of course to the south nothing appeared but the State\r\nsovereignty of the fathers. Her illuded sight was far clearer and more\r\nconfident than the true vision of the north, and she magnified State\r\nsovereignty which she thought she saw, and damned the American\r\nnationality preached by the north as anti-State-rights, when at that very\r\ntime a nationality of her own had really put all the southern States at\r\nits feet. It mattered not for the thick perception of the north and the\r\noptical illusion of the south, the American nation was now full grown; and\r\nby the result of the brothers' war it made good its claim to sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe historian must accurately gauge the effect wrought by the wonderfully\r\nsuccessful career of the United States under the federal constitution in\r\nits first years. War with France imminent, Pinckney's winged word,\r\n\"Millions for defence, but not a cent for tribute,\" the sword buckled on\r\nagain by the father of his country--and peace; the extension of our domain\r\nfrom the Mississippi to the Pacific by the Louisiana purchase; the\r\nvictories won against the men who used to say scornfully that our fathers\r\ncould not stand the bayonet, and the still more surprising victories won\r\nwith an improvised navy against the mistress of the seas, in the war of\r\n1812; the brilliant operations of Decatur against Algiers; the military\r\npower of the Indians decisively and permanently outclassed, until soon our\r\nwomen and children on the border were practically secure against the\r\ntomahawk and scalping knife; and perhaps above all the world-wide\r\nspaciousness, as it were, and the inexpressibly greater dignity and\r\nsplendor of the public arena, as compared with that of any single colony\r\nor State, which was opened at once to every ambitious spirit--these are\r\nsome, only, of the feats and achievements which gave the United States\r\nunquestioned authority at home and incomparable prestige around the world.\r\nAnd on and on the American nation rushed, from one stage of growth into\r\nand through another, until the result was that for some years before\r\nsecession State sovereignty, for all of the high airs it gave itself and\r\nthe imposing show of respect it extorted, had become merely a survival.\r\n\r\nThus did the American nation form, from a number of different neighboring,\r\ncognate, and very closely-akin communities, under that complex of the\r\nforces of growth and those of combination which imperceptibly and\r\nresistlessly steers the social organism along the entire track of its\r\nevolution. The nationalizing leaven was hidden by the powers in charge of\r\nour national destiny in the colonial meal, and it had in time so\r\ncompletely leavened the whole lump that Rhode Island, and North Carolina,\r\ntrying hard to stay out, and Texas desporting joyfully and proudly under\r\nthe lone star in her golden independence, could not break the invisible\r\nleading strings, which pulled all three into the United States. Note how\r\nOregon and California, though largely settled from the south yet being\r\nwithout slavery, in their extreme remoteness from the brothers' war\r\nadhered to the union cause. And had the southern confederacy triumphed in\r\nthe war, the States in it would have staid out of the federal union only\r\nthe few years necessary for slavery to run its course. When there was no\r\nmore virgin soil for cotton, the southern nation, which was merely a\r\ngrowth upon the American nation, would have collapsed of itself, as did\r\nthe State of Frankland; and that continental brotherhood which brought in\r\nRhode Island, North Carolina, and Texas, would have commandingly\r\nreasserted itself. The more you contemplate the facts, the more it is seen\r\nthat this continental brotherhood was and is the most vigorous tap-root\r\nand stock of nationality in all history. The providence which at first\r\ngradually and surely mixed the colonies into one people, then into a\r\nfeeble and infirm political whole, rapidly hardening in consistency, and\r\nlastly into an indissoluble union, and which was from the beginning more\r\nand more developing us into a nation--this overruling evolution, and not\r\nconstitution or lawmaking organs, has been, is, and always will be the\r\nultimate and supreme authority, the opposeless lawgiver, the resistlessly\r\nself-executing higher law in America, creating, altering, modifying or\r\nabolishing man-made constitutions, laws, ordinances, and statutes, as\r\nsuits its own true democratic purpose, often inscrutable to\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is the substance of the argument that must now take the\r\nplace of that made by Webster and the unionists after him, which was\r\nconvincingly confuted by the south. It proves the complete and immaculate\r\njustice of the war for the union.\r\n\r\nThis view differs from the other, which we admitted above to be very\r\nstrong, mainly in refusing to concede that a State is sovereign and can\r\nlegitimately secede at will. But under it, it ought to be conceded that\r\nthe States in the southern confederacy were for the time actually out of\r\nthe American union by revolution. It is not possible to say they were in\r\nrebellion; that is an offence of individuals standing by an authority\r\nhastily improvised and manifestly sham. It was not by the action of\r\nindividuals, but it was by the action of States, veritable political\r\nentities and quasi sovereigns, that the confederacy was organized. When\r\nthese States were coerced back, they could not invoke the protection to\r\ntheir slaves given in a constitution which they had solemnly repudiated.\r\nThe United States could therefore deal with them as it had with the\r\nTerritories from which it excluded slavery. While of course adequate\r\nprotection of the freedmen against their former masters ought to have been\r\nprovided, it should at the same time have been made clear to the world\r\nthat slavery was abolished solely because events had demonstrated it to be\r\nthe only root and cause of dismemberment of the union. Such a familiar\r\nexample as the often-exercised power of a municipality to blow up a house,\r\nwithout compensation therefor, to stop the progress of conflagration, and\r\nmany other seemingly arbitrary acts done by society in its\r\nself-preservation, would have occurred to conscientious people\r\ncontemplating. And it would have been a long flight in morals above the\r\nproclamation, merely to have justified emancipation on the ground that the\r\nexistence of slavery was a serious menace to the life of the nation.\r\n\r\nOne's logic may be often wrong, and yet his proposition has been rightly\r\ngiven him by an instinct, as we so often see in the case of good women. O\r\nthis subliminal self of ours, how it bends us hither and thither, as the\r\nsolid hemisphere does the little human figure upon it, posing with a\r\nseeming will of his own! Hence, and not from our argument-making faculty,\r\ncome not only our own most important principles of action, but also our\r\nvery strongest persuasive influence. And it is the subconscious mental\r\nforces moving great masses of men and women all the same way--that is, the\r\nnational instincts--which are the all-conquering powers that the apostle\r\nof a good cause arouses and sets in array. And while it is true that the\r\nmere logic of Webster's anti-nullification speech is puerile, the after\r\nworld will more and more couple that speech with the reply to Hayne, and\r\nkeep the two at the top--above every effort of all other orators. In the\r\nreply to Hayne, in 1830, he had magnified the union in a passage which\r\never since has deservedly led all selections for American speech books.\r\nAnd now, in 1833, when dismemberment actually makes menace of its ugly\r\nself, the great wizard of speech that takes consciences and hearts\r\ncaptive,[37] proclaimed to his countrymen that there could be no such\r\nthing as lawful secession or nullification. The earnestness and the\r\nemphasis with which he said this were supreme merits of the speech. And\r\nthenceforth it was enough to the hosts of the north to remember that the\r\nAmerican, towering like a mountain above them all, had in his high place\r\nsolemnly declared that secession is necessarily revolution. And, to one\r\nwho is familiar with the hypnotizing effect of subconscious national\r\nsuggestion it is not strange that they scouted Calhoun's demolishing\r\nreply, and treasured Webster's false logic as supreme and perfect\r\nexposition of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nROOT-AND-BRANCH ABOLITIONISTS AND FIRE-EATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long while opposition to slavery was moderate and not unreasoning.\r\nThe first actual quarrel over it between the sections was when Missouri\r\napplied for admission to the union in 1818. That was settled by the famous\r\ncompromise of 1820. The most of the anti-slavery men of that day stood\r\nonly against the extension of slavery. While many a one of them believed\r\nhis conviction was dictated, independently and entirely, by his\r\nconscience, it was in fact given him because of his relation to the\r\nfree-labor nationalization claiming the public lands for itself. That was\r\nalso true of the great mass of northerners opposed to slavery down to the\r\nvery beginning of the war. They wanted the Territories for themselves. The\r\ncontest between the United States and England for Oregon is a parallel\r\ncase. The American felt, if this territory falls to the United States, I\r\nand my children and children's children can get cheap land somewhere in\r\nit; but if it falls to England, I and they are forever shut out. In the\r\nintersectional contest over the public lands northerners felt that they\r\nwould be practically excluded from any part of them into which slavery was\r\ncarried; for infinitely preferring, as they did, the free-labor system, to\r\nwhich they had been bred, to the slavery system, of which they had no\r\nexperience, and against which they were prejudiced, they would never\r\nvoluntarily settle where it obtained. This, the prevalent view, brought\r\nabout the compromise of 1820, by which all the territory north of 36 deg. 30'\r\nwas guaranteed to free labor, that is, to the north, not because its\r\ninhabitants were burning with zeal to repress the spread of what they\r\nthought to be an unspeakable moral wrong, but because they purposed\r\nthereby to insure a fair inheritance to their own children.\r\n\r\nSo much for what we have called the first quarrel between the sections\r\nover slavery. Let us now glance at the stages following until the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist shows himself.\r\n\r\nFor some twenty years after the Missouri compromise was made there was\r\nhardly any public agitation at all as to slavery. In 1840 an abolition\r\nticket for the presidency was nominated, but it received a support much\r\nsmaller than had been currently predicted. It is not until January, 1836,\r\nwhen, upon Calhoun's motion in the senate of the United States to reject\r\ntwo petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nthere ensued a prolonged and passionate discussion, that we can say that\r\nthe old free-soil practically begins to pass into an abolition movement.\r\nHere moral attack upon slavery seriously begins. If we think but a moment\r\nwe will understand it too well to explain it as an arousal of conscience,\r\nwhich ought to have been aroused many years before if slavery was indeed\r\nthe terrible sin the abolitionists now commenced to say it was. The\r\nagitation of 1830, the year that Webster replied to Hayne, and that of\r\n1833, when he and Calhoun crossed swords over nullification, mark a great\r\nadvance of intersectional antagonism beyond that of the time of the\r\nMissouri compromise. We can see now as we look back what contemporaries\r\ncould not see, that is, that the two were _avant couriers_ of the southern\r\nconfederacy. But some of the contemporaries did discern the fact--not\r\nconsciously, but instinctively. With these there was, in subliminal\r\nratiocination, a process somewhat as follows: The southern confederacy, if\r\nit does come, will disrupt the union, which assures, while it lasts,\r\nimmunity of our country from frequent wars upon its own soil, and from the\r\nheavy load of great armies kept up even in the intervals of peace. This\r\ndisruption will establish in America all the evil conditions of Europe\r\nfrom which our fathers fled hither. Slavery is the _vis matrix_, the sole\r\ndeveloping force, the life of this menaced confederacy. Let us abolish\r\nslavery, and preserve the union.\r\n\r\nHow accurately the common instincts--especially those protecting our\r\nprivate interests--discern both the favorable and unfavorable, becomes\r\nmore of a marvel to me every year. To them the favorable is morally right,\r\nthe unfavorable morally wrong. If the latter threatens great injury, they\r\nexcite against it deep-seated indignation as if it were a crime. How else\r\ncan you explain it that all the churches, accepting the same Christ and\r\nworshipping the same God, were at last divided, the northern churches\r\nimpugning and the southern churches defending slavery. Dwell upon this\r\nfact until you interpret it aright. On one side the most conscientious and\r\nthe best of the north unanimous that slavery is morally wrong; on the\r\nother the most conscientious and best of the south unanimous that it is\r\nmorally right. Then think of the northern and southern statesmen, jurists,\r\nand the great public leaders; and at the last consider that the entire\r\npeople of one section prayed for, fought and died for, slavery, while that\r\nof the other did the same things against it. When you do this, you must\r\nadmit that our community, our country, the society of which we are\r\nmembers, fashions our consciences and makes our opinions.\r\n\r\nThe economic interest of the north was against slavery. It was her\r\ninterest to get all the territory possible for opportunity to her free\r\nworkers. It was also a transcendent economic interest of hers that there\r\nbe no great foreign power near her to require of her that she put\r\nthousands of bread-winners and wealth-makers to idle in a standing army.\r\nOn the other side the economic interest of the south in slavery was so\r\ngreat it commanded her to sacrifice all the advantages of union to\r\npreserve slavery, if that should be necessary. Each side feels deeply and\r\nmore and more angrily that the other is seeking to rob it of the means of\r\nproduction and subsistence--the property to which of all it believes its\r\ntitle most indefeasible. It required some years to bring affairs to this\r\npoint; but it was accomplished at last; and the north was ready for the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist and the south for the fire-eater. Of course\r\nall this effect of oppugnant economical interests is under the guidance of\r\nthe directors of evolution, who generally have their human servants to\r\nmasquerade as characters widely different from the true. When these\r\nservants put on high airs as if they were doing their own will and not\r\nthat of their masters, how the directors must smile. They have guaranteed\r\nanimal reproduction from one generation to another by the impulsion of a\r\nsupreme momentary pleasure, as Lucretius most philosophically recognizes\r\nin his _dux vitae dia voluptas_. The passion of anger is the converse of\r\nthat of love. When consent cannot settle some great controversy that must\r\nbe settled, the passion of anger is so greatly excited by the instigation\r\nof the directors that the disputants leave arguments and come to blows. In\r\nthe ripeness of time the Ransy Sniffleses[38] come forth. They say and do\r\neverything possible to bring on the impending mortal combat. They never\r\ngrasp the essence of the contention, for it is their mission to arouse\r\nfeeling, passion, anger. They are resistlessly--most conscientiously and\r\nhonestly--impelled to make the other side appear detestable and\r\ninsultingly offensive in heinous wrong-doing. The most zealous and the\r\nmost influential of the root-and-branch abolitionists were young when they\r\nvaulted into the arena. Garrison was twenty-six when he started the\r\n\"Liberator\" in 1831, Wendell Phillips was some six years younger than\r\nGarrison, and he was about twenty-six when he made his debut with a\r\npowerful impromptu in Boston, in 1837. Whittier was two years younger than\r\nGarrison, and he was early a co-worker in the \"Liberator.\" It is\r\ndemonstrated by everything they said that they were entirely ignorant of\r\nthe south and its people, of the average condition of the slave in the\r\nsouth, and especially of the negro's grade of humanity. They never studied\r\nand investigated facts diligently and impartially, desiring only to\r\nascertain the truth. They assumed the facts to be as it suited their\r\npurposes, given them by the directors, of exciting hatred of their\r\nopponents,--and it added greatly to their efficiency that they fully\r\nbelieved their assumptions. Knowing really nothing of the negro except\r\nthat he was a man, it was natural for them to believe, as they did, that\r\nthe typical, average negro slave of the south was in all the essentials of\r\ngood citizenship just such a human being as the typical, average white. If\r\nthey did not go quite so far, they surely claimed for him something so\r\nnear to it that it is practically the same. We shall, as suggested above,\r\ntreat this pernicious error more fully in later chapters.\r\n\r\nThe root-and-branch abolitionists have claimed ever since the\r\nemancipation proclamation became effective that the overthrow of slavery\r\nwas brought about by them; and thousands upon thousands believing it sing\r\nthem hosannas. But it is an undeniable fact that the superior power of\r\nfree labor in its irreconcilable conflict with slavery was bound to do in\r\nAmerica what it had done everywhere else. And without the abolitionist at\r\nall the days of slavery were numbered, and they were few even if there had\r\nbeen no secession, and very few if secession had triumphed. For free\r\nlabor--its fell and implacable foe--was on the outside steadily and surely\r\nencircling it with a wall that hemmed it from the extension that was a\r\ncondition of its life; and within its ring fence necessarily it was\r\nrapidly exhausting all of its resources. It was the mighty counteraction\r\nof free labor that crushed slavery. The root-and-branch abolitionist\r\nthrown up by this movement which had set forward irresistibly, long before\r\nhe was ever heard of, and who believed that he started it and was guiding\r\nit, strikingly examples the proverb\r\n\r\n  \"Er denkt zu schieben und ist geschoben.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that future history will give him credit only for having a\r\nlittle hastened forward the inevitable.\r\n\r\nAnother abolition misstatement ought to be corrected. Sumner fulminated\r\nagainst what he called the oligarchs of slavery. And it was common at the\r\nnorth to speak of southern aristocracy and southern aristocratic\r\ninstitutions. Of course the slaves had no political privileges, no more\r\nthan they had in Athens, which has always been deemed the most genuine\r\nrepublic ever known. There was in the old south no oligarch, or anything\r\nlike him, unless you choose to call such a man as Calhoun an oligarch,\r\nwhose influence over his State was entirely from the good opinion and\r\nunexampled confidence of the free citizens of all classes, which he had\r\nwon. There was no aristocracy, except such a natural one as can be found\r\nin every one of our States, as is illustrated by the Adamses in\r\nMassachusetts, the Lees in Virginia, and the Cobbs in Georgia. In those\r\ndays property was much more equally distributed than now; and it was easy\r\nfor the energetic and saving poor young man, of the humblest origin, to\r\nmake his way up. In all my day there was universal suffrage, and it was\r\npolitical death to propose any modification. I explained nearly thirty\r\nyears ago how southern conditions prevented the development of anything\r\nlike the beneficent New England town-meeting system.[39] But for all of\r\nthat the entire spirit of southern society was democratic in the extreme,\r\nfar more so than it is now with the nominating machinery everywhere in the\r\nsouth except South Carolina, controlled by corporation oligarchs. When the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionist inveighed against oligarchy and aristocracy,\r\nand aristocratic institutions in the south, he was just as mistaken as he\r\nwas in denouncing what he asserted to be the guilt in morals of\r\nslaveholding.\r\n\r\nThe more I study the abolitionists whom I distinguish as root-and-branch,\r\nthe more completely self-deceived as to facts, the wilder and more\r\nemotional I find them to be. I have just mentioned some of their\r\nmisrepresentations; and in later chapters I shall dwell upon their\r\ncardinal mistake as to the place of the negro in the human scale. I have\r\nnot sufficient space for more of these things. I will give just one\r\nexample of their wildness. They put in circulation that Toombs had said he\r\nexpected some day to call the roll of his slaves at the foot of Bunker\r\nHill monument,--a slander which they persisted in renewing after he had\r\nsolemnly and publicly denied it.[40] In their excited imaginations they\r\nwere sure that the south was cherishing a scheme by which, under the help\r\nof the court that made the Dred Scott decision, slavery was to be\r\nestablished and protected by law everywhere in the north. The only\r\nparallel I can think of to this utterly groundless panic is that of some\r\npoor souls in the Confederate ranks in front of Richmond in 1862, who,\r\nwhen they learned that Jackson had got in the enemy's rear, expressed\r\nlively fears that he was going to drive McClellan's army over them.\r\n\r\nAnd the fire-eaters,--how they got important facts wrong! They habitually\r\nsaid that the northern masses were too untruthful and dishonest for us of\r\nthe south to stay in the partnership without disgrace and loss of\r\nself-respect. I heard of one who was wont gravely to assert that\r\nprostitutes and ice were all that the south was dependent upon the north\r\nfor; and these were only luxuries which it was better to do without.\r\nPerhaps the height of falsification by the hotspurs was the assertion,\r\nmade everywhere again and again, that northerners were such cowards that,\r\neven if they were spurred into a war in defence of the union, any one\r\naverage southerner would prove an overmatch for any five of them.\r\n\r\nIt is now high time that each section turn resolutely away from these\r\nfanatics, and the literature which they have made or informed, to seek\r\nright instruction as to slavery, the struggle over it, the characters of\r\nthe masses on each side and of their leaders, and all other belonging\r\ndetails, in the real facts. Especially must we understand the internecine\r\nduel between free labor and slavery, and what was the purpose of the\r\ndirectors of evolution placing the fanatical abolitionist and the\r\nfire-eater upon the stage. When we grasp that purpose clearly, how\r\npretentious do we understand their claims and self-laudation to be, and\r\nhow clearly we see that they are like the fly on the cart-wheel that\r\nbecame so vain of the great dust it was raising, and also like the little\r\nfice egging on the big dogs to do their fighting. I have still vivid\r\nrecollections of hearing in amicable interviews of hostile pickets these\r\ncharacters denounced for keeping out of the war which, as was then said,\r\nthey had caused,--the fanatical abolitionists denounced by the federals,\r\nthe fire-eaters, original secessionists, the blue cockade wearers, by the\r\nconfederates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCALHOUN\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter John Caldwell Calhoun, who was born March 18, 1782, the birth-year\r\nof Webster, had become large enough to go to the field, the most of his\r\ntime until he was eighteen was spent in work on the plantation. His father\r\nhad never had but six months' schooling. There were no schools in that\r\nregion except a few \"old field\" ones, where the three R's only were\r\ntaught. To one of these John went for a few months. The boy learned to\r\nread, and manifestly he had acquired some habit of reading. In his\r\nthirteenth year he was sent to school to his brother-in-law, Moses\r\nWaddell, who was an unusually good teacher. He found a circulating library\r\nin the house. This was his first access to books. He read old Rollin, and\r\nhe probably moused about in Robertson's History of America and Life of\r\nCharles V, and Voltaire's Charles XII. Having laid Rollin aside, he\r\nassailed Locke's famous Essay; but when he got to the chapter on Infinity\r\nhis health had become bad, doubtless due to his change from active to\r\nsedentary habits and from physical to mental activity. So he was taken\r\nback to his work at home. His father had died in the meanwhile, and his\r\nmother, who had great business talent, taught him, as we are told, \"how to\r\nadminister the affairs of a plantation.\"[41] It will appear in the sequel\r\nthat he was superbly trained.[42] When he attained the age of eighteen the\r\nfamily had become convinced that he ought to be got ready for a\r\nprofession. John, knowing himself to be the mainstay of his mother, and\r\nhaving resolved to be a planter, at first would not hear to this. But the\r\nfamily persisted. This doubtless influenced him to turn the subject\r\ncarefully over in his mind; and the decision which he made showed an\r\nunderstanding of his own peculiar talents and needs, and also a prescience\r\nof his future which, when his youth, small opportunity of observation, and\r\nwant of schooling are remembered, are very wonderful. He gave this family,\r\nwho were not well-to-do, to understand he would not accept a limited and\r\nmakeshift education. Naturally they asked what sort did he mean, and he\r\nanswered, \"The best school, college, and legal education to be had in the\r\nUnited States.\"[43] Then they asked, How long did he think all this would\r\ntake, and he promptly answered seven years. To the average reader it seems\r\nthat the time necessary to carry this unschooled lad through the course he\r\nproposed had been egregiously underestimated by him; but to the family, as\r\nthey thought of the appertaining annual expenses, it must have looked very\r\nlong. They had to give in. That irrefragable influence over his people\r\nwhich showed itself as soon as he came upon the public stage begins here.\r\nSome one long afterwards said of him, that if he could but talk with every\r\nman he would always have the whole United States on his side. It is more\r\nthan probable that in the five years after he had left Waddell's school he\r\nhad, in plantation management and other interests of the family,\r\nconvinced them that he always acted or advised wisely. Another comment is\r\nin place here. Study of the record of his early life convinces you that\r\nvery soon after, if not before, the commencement of his legal studies, he\r\ndecided to make law only a stepping-stone by which to enter public life\r\nand also acquire the means to plant. I cannot help inferring that this\r\nwas--somewhat vaguely it may be--his intention already formed when he\r\ndictated terms to the family as just told. It is not at all impossible\r\nthat to him who afterwards astonished the world by the sureness of his\r\nprophecy there had even then been revealed the career awaiting; and so he\r\nresolved to get ready for college in two years, and pass the rest of the\r\nseven where, besides competent instructors, he would have cultivated\r\nsociety, libraries, and the best of opportunities to qualify himself for\r\npublic life. Be our conjecture true or not, in two years after he had\r\nopened his Latin grammar he entered the junior class at Yale, and two\r\nyears later he graduated with credit. After reading law in an office he\r\ntook a year's course at the Litchfield law school in Connecticut, and then\r\nhe went into an office again for a while. Some time in June, 1807, he hung\r\nout his shingle at Abbeville Court-house, as it was called up to the time\r\nof reconstruction. A few days afterwards in that month occurred the attack\r\non the Chesapeake, and when the news came it caused a public meeting in\r\nthe town. Some good report of him must have been bruited about in the\r\ncommunity in advance of his coming. It is almost certain that his\r\neducation had greatly developed those powers of conversation mentioned\r\nabove, and that many listeners had greatly approved his views of the\r\noutrage, and the patriotic indignation he uttered over it. It is not\r\nstretching probability too far to assert that, young as he was, he was by\r\nfar the ablest man that could be found in the locality to advise upon the\r\nburning question which had arisen so suddenly. He was selected to draft\r\nappropriate resolutions and present them. There is no record of these or\r\nof his speech. But as we know that the resolutions carried, and that\r\ntradition still reports admiringly of the speech, we may be sure that his\r\nperformance in both was extraordinarily good. Although there had been a\r\nstrong popular prejudice in the county--or district, as it was then\r\ncalled--against lawyer representatives, October 13, 1807, less than four\r\nmonths after the meeting just described, he was elected to the legislature\r\nat the head of the ticket.\r\n\r\nIn that day presidential electors were appointed by the State\r\nlegislatures. Shortly after the session of this legislature to which\r\nCalhoun had been elected opened, there was an informal meeting of the\r\nrepublican members to make nominations for president and vice-president.\r\nThe first was unanimously given to Madison. When the other was up, Calhoun\r\ndeclared his conviction that there was soon to be war with England. At\r\nsuch a time there should be no dissension in the party. He gave strong\r\nreasons why George Clinton should not be nominated, as had been proposed;\r\nand he suggested John Langdon of New Hampshire as the proper man. The\r\nthorough acquaintance with the grave situation which he manifested, the\r\ndue respect he showed Clinton while opposing his nomination, and the\r\nability with which he discussed the question, advanced him at once to a\r\nplace among the most distinguished members of the legislature.\r\n\r\n\"Several important measures were originated by Mr. Calhoun while in the\r\nlegislature which have become a permanent portion of the legislation of\r\nthe State, and he soon acquired an extensive practice at the bar.\"[44] He\r\nkept in the very midst of the political swim. His reputation as an honest,\r\ntrue, and able adviser had become so great and influential that the\r\npeople, in their warm approval of the strong measures he advocated as\r\npreparation for the threatened war, pushed him out as their candidate for\r\ncongress and elected him most triumphantly in October, 1810. The first\r\nsession of this, the twelfth congress, commenced November 4, 1811. Clay,\r\nthen speaker of the house, evidently expecting much of him, gave him the\r\nsecond place in the committee on foreign relations. There came before the\r\nhouse a measure contemplating an increase of the army in view of the war\r\nwhich appeared to many to be nearer than ever. John Randolph was against\r\nit. In March, 1799, a year before Calhoun started to school, Randolph,\r\nthen not twenty-six years old, had fearlessly met the great Patrick Henry\r\nin stump discussion, and had, in the opinion of his auditors, got the\r\nbetter of it. He was elected to congress in this year. Steadily since then\r\nhe had developed, until he was now one of the most prominent figures upon\r\nthe national stage. While his powers of discussion of a subject were\r\ngreat, the power that especially characterized him was that of nonplussing\r\nhis antagonist with a snub or a sarcasm. Randolph made an earnest speech.\r\nCalhoun replied. It is not enough to say of this speech that it evinces\r\nfull mastery of the subject. It presents every important view most\r\neffectively, satisfactorily answering everything which had been said on\r\nthe other side. And it is especially happy in the wise use made at each\r\nproper place of the commands of morality and patriotism.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinkney has instructively and entertainingly illustrated this speech\r\nby his excerpts.[45] To them I here add another, which I would have you\r\nconsider,--Randolph had strenuously insisted that the cause of this war,\r\nsaid by the other side to be impending, should first be defined; and until\r\nthis plain duty was done there should be no preparation. To this Calhoun\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"The single instance alluded to, the endeavor of Mr. Fox to compel Mr.\r\n    Pitt to define the object of the war against France, will not support\r\n    the gentleman from Virginia in his position. That was an extraordinary\r\n    war for an extraordinary purpose. It was not for conquest, or for\r\n    redress of injury, but to impose a government on France which she\r\n    refused to receive--an object so detestable that an avowal dared not\r\n    be made.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a thrust which Randolph especially could appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe more I examine this first speech of a very young member of congress\r\nupon a question of such transcendent importance to the people of the\r\nUnited States, the more sound, able, complete,--to sum up in one\r\nword,--the more statesmanly it appears. I am confident that whoever will\r\nweigh it carefully will agree with me. He will not be surprised to learn\r\nthat it carried the house decisively. Even in Randolph's own State it drew\r\ngreat praise. But its fame went abroad everywhere, and it was revealed to\r\nAmerica that she had found among her public men another giant.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 Calhoun was a lad of eighteen, without even a complete\r\ncommon school education. Represent to yourself clearly what he had\r\naccomplished in the interval from the year last mentioned to December 12,\r\n1811, when, not yet thirty, he made the speech we have just considered. If\r\nany public man of America, burdened with such disadvantages, has\r\nsurpassed, or even equalled, this meteoric stride, I do not now recall\r\nhim. I am not emphasizing especially that he got to congress in such a\r\nshort while. What I do especially emphasize is that he so early won place\r\nas an eminent statesman. In these eleven years he lost no time at all in\r\nidleness, or probation, or waiting.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8, 1811, some three months after his election to congress, he\r\nmarried his cousin, Floride Calhoun--not a first cousin, but a daughter of\r\na first cousin. His letters of courtship, not to her, but, in the old\r\nstyle, to her mother; his only letter to her, written shortly before the\r\nmarriage; and other letters from and to him afterwards, all of which you\r\ncan read in the Correspondence,--show him to be such a lover, father,\r\nbrother, son-in-law, brother-in-law, grandfather, etc., as everybody\r\nwants. Some South Carolinian, adequately gifted, ought to tell befittingly\r\nthe tale of Calhoun's beautiful domestic life.\r\n\r\nI must now mention some other facts which will further enlighten you as to\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nI was fourteen when Calhoun died. For four or five years before, and\r\nafterwards until I went to the brothers' war, I heard much of Calhoun from\r\nrelatives in Abbeville county and the Court House. I still recall most\r\nvividly what a paternal uncle habitually said of the brightness and\r\nunexampled impressiveness of Calhoun's eyes, and the charm and\r\ninstructiveness of his conversation. In Georgia there was not a public man\r\nwhose course in politics commended itself to all of my acquaintances. I\r\nhad become accustomed to hearing much disparagement of Toombs and of\r\nStephens, with whom I was most familiar. But my South Carolina relatives,\r\nand every man or woman of that State whose talk I listened to; every boy\r\nor girl with whom I talked myself, yea, all of the negroes,--always warmly\r\nmaintained the rightfulness of Calhoun's politics, national or State. I\r\nthought it a good hit when a Georgia aunt of mine dubbed the Palmetto\r\nState \"The Kingdom of Calhoun,\" and Abbeville Court House \"its capital.\"\r\nThis universal political worship was a great surprise to me. But there was\r\na still greater one to come. That was, that according to all accounts, and\r\nwithout any contradiction, in spite of his living away from home the most\r\nof his time, he yet gave his planting interests and all else appertaining\r\nthe very best management, and with such unvarying financial success it\r\nwould be unkind to compare Webster's money-wasting and amateur farming at\r\nMarshfield. In this community, where he seemed to be known as well as he\r\nwas before he removed to Fort Hill, some sixty miles distant, in 1825, he\r\nhad become a far greater authority in business than he had even attained\r\nin politics. His acquaintances all sought his advice, which they followed\r\nwhen they got it; thus making this busiest of public servants their\r\nagricultural oracle.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in Starke's memoir and the Correspondence ample\r\nproofs of that diligent attention of Calhoun to his home affairs which\r\nmade him the exceptionally successful planter that he was. Starke happily\r\ncalls him \"the great farmer-statesman of our country.\"[46]\r\n\r\nNow let us see where he made his mark as an able business man in another\r\nplace. He was Monroe's secretary of war from 1817 to 1825. When he entered\r\nthe office he found something like $50,000,000 of unsettled accounts\r\noutstanding, and jumble in every branch of the service. He soon brought\r\ndown the accounts to a few millions. And he reduced the annual expenditure\r\nof four to two and a half millions, \"without subtracting a single comfort\r\nfrom either officer or soldier,\" as he says with becoming pride. He\r\nestablished it, that the head of every subordinate department be\r\nresponsible for its disbursements. His economy was not parsimonious. He\r\nwas especially popular at West Point, for which he did great things, and\r\nwith the officers and men of the army.\r\n\r\nAnd if one chose to look through the belonging parts of the Correspondence\r\nand the other accessible pertinent records, he will find ample proofs that\r\nhe was ever alert to all the duties of his office, performing each one,\r\nwhether important or trivial, with the height of skill and diligence.\r\n\r\nConsider, as to his career in the war department, this language of one of\r\nthe most inveterate of his disparagers:\r\n\r\n    \"Many of his friends and admirers had with regret seen him abandon his\r\n    seat in the legislative hall for a place in the president's council.\r\n    They apprehended that he would, to a great extent, lose the renown\r\n    which he had gained as a member of congress, for they thought that the\r\n    didactic turn of his mind rendered him unfit to become a successful\r\n    administrator. He undeceived them in a manner which astonished even\r\n    those who had not shared these apprehensions. The department of war\r\n    was in a state of really astounding confusion when he assumed charge\r\n    of it. Into this chaos he soon brought order, and the whole service of\r\n    the department received an organization so simple and at the same time\r\n    so efficient that it has, in the main, been adhered to by all his\r\n    successors, and proved itself capable of standing even the test of the\r\n    civil war.\"[47]\r\n\r\nNow let us glance at his magnificent success in winning for the United\r\nStates the vast territory of Texas and Oregon. The latter had long been in\r\ndispute between us and England. Ever since 1818 it had been jointly\r\noccupied under agreement. We wanted all of it; and of course as our\r\nsettlements in the west approached nearer and nearer, our desire for it\r\nmounted. And England wanted all of it too. Soon after Texas achieved her\r\nindependence she applied for admission into our union, but as the settlers\r\nhad carried slavery with them free-soil opposition kept her out. Texas got\r\nin debt, and the only thing for her to do was to tie to some great power\r\nwilling to receive her. England, seeing her opportunity, was trying to\r\npropitiate Mexico in order, with the favor of the latter, to get Texas for\r\nherself. Of course the south wanted Texas to come in, but the free-soilers\r\ndid not. And the north wanted Oregon; and although its soil and climate\r\ndid not admit of slavery, the south was against its acquisition unless the\r\nconcession be made that it be permitted to slavery to occupy all the\r\nsuitable soil of the Territories. As early as 1843 Calhoun, with his\r\npiercing vision, saw the situation clearly. If the dispute as to Oregon\r\nprovoked war, England could throw troops thither from China by a much\r\nshorter route than ours, the latter going as it did from the States on the\r\nAtlantic coast around Cape Horn. That would be bad enough for us. But\r\nsuppose England gets Texas. A hostile power, with a vast empire of land,\r\nwill spring up under the very nose of the States, where our adversary will\r\nacquire a base of operations in the highest degree unfavorable to us. Then\r\nEngland will rise in her demands as to Oregon, and perhaps win all of it\r\nfrom us. In an affair of inter-dependent contingencies it is of the first\r\nimportance to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing first. Texas\r\nwas ripe, Oregon was not. Calhoun saw the first thing to do was to annex\r\nTexas. For when England cannot secure that base of operations in Texas she\r\nwill shrink from making Oregon a cause of war, and while she is\r\nhesitating, Oregon--which is near to us and far from her--is steadily\r\nfilling with population in which settlers from the United States more and\r\nmore preponderate; and at the same time the populous States are fast\r\napproaching. After a while the inhabitants will all practically be on our\r\nside, and they will have hosts of allies to the eastward in supporting\r\ndistance, which would give us an invincible advantage in case war for\r\nOregon does come. This is what Calhoun styled \"masterly inactivity\" on our\r\npart, and which, had it been fully carried out as he advised, Oregon would\r\nnow extend much further north than it does. To sum up in a line, he saw\r\nthat activity as to Texas and inactivity as to Oregon was each masterly.\r\n\r\nBut the hotheads of the south and the fanatical wing of the anti-slavery\r\nmen at the north rose up, obstructing his way like mountains. At the same\r\ntime there was lack of vision in even the leaders of each section who\r\ncould rise to patriotism above prejudice. Polk blundered in not continuing\r\nCalhoun as secretary of State, in which place he had made so good a\r\nbeginning that it soon accomplished the annexation of Texas. In his\r\ninaugural Polk asserted that our title to Oregon was good, and to be\r\nmaintained by arms if need be; and he went further away from \"masterly\r\ninactivity\" in his first annual message. He evoked great popular\r\nexcitement, and \"Fifty-four forty or fight!\" and \"All of Oregon or none!\"\r\ncame forth in passionate ejaculations in every corner of the land. Calhoun\r\nhad been called from retirement to take Texas and Oregon in hand, and when\r\nPolk made a new secretary he went back into the retirement for which he\r\ngreatly longed. The record shows that the best men of all parties, north\r\nand south, felt that as Tyler's secretary he was the man of all to manage\r\nthe two matters so vitally important to the United States, and they deeply\r\nregretted that the place was not continued to him by Polk. And now\r\ninstead of the happy settlement they had been sure the master would\r\neffect, the country was face to face with a war that portended direful\r\ndisaster to each section. The eyes of patriots turned to Calhoun again;\r\nand as he cannot be secretary, he must be in the senate. And a way being\r\nmade, he was seated in due time. It needs not to go into much detail. The\r\nsituation had changed greatly. The especial thing to do now was to avoid\r\nwar. And as a resolution to terminate the joint occupation had been passed\r\nby congress, and as the ire of Great Britain had been greatly aroused,\r\nthere must at once be a settlement of the Oregon controversy. And so the\r\ncontroversy was compromised and averted, this good result being mainly due\r\nto the efforts of Calhoun. Even Von Holst calls his speech of March 16,\r\n1846, great. It will live forever. It is paying it gross disrespect to\r\ntreat it as mere oratory, even if one concede to it the highest eloquence.\r\nIt voices the ripest wisdom of the ablest practical statesman dealing with\r\na most momentous public affair, in a crisis delicate and perilous in the\r\nextreme. The vindication of the true course of action is majestic. But to\r\nmy mind the great achievement of the speech is his sublime philanthropic\r\ndeprecation of war between England and America. When the papers told us at\r\nthe outbreak of our war with Spain that all the British subjects on the\r\nwarships of the latter had thrown up their places, it seemed to me that\r\nnothing else could so fairly omen co-operation of England and America in\r\nthe near future to democratize and make happy the world. And I believe\r\nthat that inexpressibly sweet token of Anglo-American brotherhood would\r\nhave been postponed at least a half-century, if not much longer, had it\r\nnot been for that speech.\r\n\r\nThis speech likewise discomfited pro-slavery and anti-slavery fanatics\r\nalike, and won the hearty approval of the wisest and best of every part of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nCalhoun's self-education merits the closest attention. Railroaded through\r\nschool and college, as he was, his tuition was necessarily defective in\r\nsome important particulars. In the main he spelled accurately, but the\r\nCorrespondence shows that he wrote \"sylable,\" \"indisoluably,\" \"weat\" for\r\nwet, \"merical\" for miracle, \"sperit,\" \"disappinted,\" \"abeated,\" etc. It is\r\ndoubtless to be regretted that he did not have larger familiarity with\r\npolite literature. Admitting these faults, still we must know he had been\r\nuncommonly studious and thoughtful to win his degree in four years after\r\nhis start to school; but his systematic study, careful observation, and\r\nhard thinking really commenced with his entrance of public life, and were\r\nkept up to his very death. Note this pertinent excerpt from Webster's\r\nmemorial speech, in which I italicize a passage happily describing his\r\nstudies:\r\n\r\n    \"I have not, in public nor private life, known a more assiduous person\r\n    in the discharge of his appropriate duties. I have known no man who\r\n    wasted less of life in what is called recreation, or employed less of\r\n    it in any pursuits not connected with the immediate discharge of his\r\n    duty. He seemed to have no recreation but the pleasure of conversation\r\n    with his friends. _Out of the chambers of congress, he was either\r\n    devoting himself to the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to the\r\n    immediate subject of the duty before him_, or else he was indulging in\r\n    those social interviews in which he so much delighted.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his first speech in congress to the end of his life you note that he\r\nhas always mastered the pertinent facts, literature, and guiding\r\nprinciples of whatever he has to do with, whether in speech or action.\r\nThis indicates continuous, most industrious, and most wise\r\nself-instruction. I believe it was Mr. Parton who said that Jefferson was\r\nthe best educated man of his time. His full equipment from all belonging\r\nlearning and science was surpassed only by the versatility with which he\r\ninstantly solved all new questions. But Calhoun's was more of a special\r\ntraining than Jefferson's. Having for some years learned by doing,--doing\r\nafter the best study and reflection, consistent with due promptness, that\r\nhe could give each thing he had to do,--his capital of knowledge and\r\ndeveloped faculty had become all-sufficient. Stephens, a profound student\r\nof both Jefferson and Calhoun, makes this comparison:\r\n\r\n    \"Amongst the many great men with whom he associated, Mr. Calhoun was\r\n    by far the most philosophical statesman of them all. Indeed, with the\r\n    exception of Mr. Jefferson, it may be questioned if in this respect\r\n    the United States has ever produced his superior.\"[48]\r\n\r\nGovernment--that is, good democratic government--he studied all his life\r\nwith rare devotion. His two special works,[49] and the parallel parts of\r\nhis speeches, warmly commended by such a thinker and friend of democracy\r\nas John Stuart Mill, are sufficing proof. In all the long tract from Plato\r\nand Aristotle down to the popularization of direct legislation, which\r\ncommences with the publication of Mr. Sullivan's pamphlet a few years ago,\r\nthere is to be found nobody who has penetrated so deeply into the secrets\r\nof those principles by which alone true democracy must be maintained. With\r\nwhat clear vision does he read us lessons from the unanimous veto of the\r\nRoman tribunes; the political history of the twelve tribes of Israel; the\r\nbalance of interests in the English constitution and our own, intended to\r\nguarantee what he calls government of the concurrent majority. His\r\nillustration from the confederacy of Indian Tribes is to be especially\r\nemphasized as demonstration of his industry in collecting his materials\r\nand of his great insight.[50]\r\n\r\nI must give still another example, which I am sure will yet benignly\r\nenlighten America.\r\n\r\nEver since Adam Smith fell into my hands in early manhood I have had a\r\nstrong predilection for political economy. My conviction during the\r\nbrothers' war that proper management of the currency of the confederacy\r\nwas indispensable to the success of our cause initiated me into an earnest\r\nstudy of the science of money. And later intense interest in the greenback\r\nquestion, and afterwards the silver question, added to the impetus. The\r\nlonger I observed the more plainly I saw a few private persons controlling\r\nthe coinage, the greenbacks, and the national bank currency of purpose to\r\nmonopolize government credit, and also fix the interest rate and the price\r\nlevel, at any particular time, as suited their selfish interests. The\r\nremedy became clear,--government must retake and fulfil all its money\r\nfunctions. Especially must it keep the country supplied with a volume of\r\nmoney which never becomes either redundant or contracted. How to do this\r\nproperly brought up the question, What is money? What is it that makes a\r\nsheep, or cow, or coin, or piece of paper, money? For the true answer to\r\nthis question is the very beginning and foundation of all monetary\r\nscience. I took up Ricardo again, who, with a solitary exception mentioned\r\na little farther on, had, from the time I turned into him during my study\r\nof the confederate currency, of all the economists by profession, showed\r\nto me the best understanding of the real nature of money; and of course\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, Jevons, Carl Marx, and others of less note, were\r\nexamined. The result confirmed Ricardo in his primacy; although I felt\r\nthat the true nature of money was assumed--rather vaguely--by him, and not\r\nclearly expressed as it ought to be. I believed myself familiar with all\r\nthe important work of Calhoun. Somehow I had overlooked his contributions\r\nto this subject. A few brief quotations from the more unimportant of these\r\nI found in certain American books, which made me read the pertinent\r\nspeeches.[51] It was a most inexpressible surprise to me to find that he\r\nhad perfected Ricardo. Briefly stated, this is the true doctrine according\r\nto Calhoun. It is not legal-tender laws, nor is it intrinsic value, which\r\nmakes even gold go as money. Well, what is it? Calhoun was not the first\r\nto answer it, for others had given the true answer; but they ran away from\r\nit as soon as they made it. He divined the full satisfactoriness of the\r\ntrue answer, which he demonstrated to be true by a method as nearly\r\nmathematical as the case admits of. And he lightens up what was dark\r\nbefore by showing that that is money, and good money, whatever it may\r\nbe,--gold, silver, paper, property, what not,--which the government\r\nreceives in payment of its dues. The practice of the government,--not\r\nlaws, nor the market value of different materials of money,--this is the\r\ngreat thing. If the United States should refuse to receive gold for its\r\ndues, that would so greatly lessen the demand for gold as money that the\r\ncoin would depreciate and drop out of circulation. Nothing--not the\r\nprecious metals, not diamonds of the first water, not radium, not the\r\nbills of the best bank, not greenbacks, not treasury notes can maintain\r\nthemselves as money if the government will not receive it. This is the\r\nfirst half of the subject. Calhoun adds the other by showing that whatever\r\nthe government makes money, its volume can always be kept of the proper\r\nquantity,--which proper quantity varies with the needs of commerce,--so as\r\nto avoid the too much or too little. His illustration from the treasury\r\nnotes of North Carolina, which could not be a legal tender under the\r\nfederal constitution, but which circulated briskly and buoyantly and\r\nstayed at par for many years, because they were received without discount\r\nby the State, and also because their volume was kept within bounds, will\r\nyet greatly help the cause of honest money.\r\n\r\nIn the achievement just told Calhoun not only excelled the economists of\r\nhis day, but he is yet in advance of all of the present except Del\r\nMar,[52]--the only economist who has excelled Ricardo in divining the\r\nessence of money. These two alone explain clearly and fully why it is that\r\nbankers keep such tenacious grip upon the money function of\r\ngovernment--they thereby so shape its practice that their wares shall be\r\nmoney, with all the incidents of profit therefrom, and no others shall.\r\nDel Mar never quotes him; and I almost know he has never studied his views\r\nupon this subject.\r\n\r\nAmerica will yet have a \"rational money,\" a term which Prof. Frank Parsons\r\nhas happily chosen as the name of his invaluable book.[53] To win it she\r\nmust fight many battles with the money power. When this war of the people\r\nis waging by the people for the people, the doctrine of Calhoun will be\r\nthe banner of the right. After the sordid money oligarchy is overthrown\r\nand the United States is blessed with a people's money, that benign\r\ndeliverance will add prodigiously to the fame of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nMy space does not admit of telling you how deeply Calhoun loathed the\r\nspoils system. That must be borne in mind, and taken into account in any\r\ntrue estimate of him as a statesman.\r\n\r\nI deem it especially important to have you consider his standing with the\r\npeople of his State. Literally his word was law in South Carolina. Hayne\r\nin 1832, and Huger in 1845, resigned their seats in the national senate to\r\ngive place to him. Everybody in his State always wanted him to lead, and\r\neverybody always wanted him to lead according to his own will. This\r\nunwonted influence, utterly without precedent, was due to the accurate\r\nmeasure which the masses had taken of him. As he lived and aged among them\r\nthey knew him better and better to be irreproachable in private and public\r\nlife, the ablest of the able, the most diligent of the diligent, and the\r\ntruest of the true as a representative or official, and of that severe and\r\nlofty virtue which scorns all popularity that is not the reward of\r\nrighteousness. And so he became example, model, worship, to all classes.\r\nThe forty years political ascendency of Pericles in the Athenian democracy\r\nis the only befitting historical parallel which I can think of. Familiar\r\nwith the State from boyhood, I have long thought its people the most\r\nadvanced of the south. In spite of the revenge wreaked upon her in war,\r\nand in spite of the direr devastation of the twelve years of negro rule\r\nfollowing the fall of the Confederate States, that little community, with\r\nher dispensary and her system of really direct nomination,[54] to say\r\nnothing of her wise management of all her material resources, is teaching\r\nthe nation lessons of the highest wisdom. These are the people from whom\r\nCalhoun won a crown more resplendent than any other of our States has ever\r\nbestowed upon a loved son. How eloquent were her last offices. Read Mr.\r\nPinkney's extracts from the \"Carolina Tribute,\" narrating the reception of\r\nhis mortal remains in Charleston:[55] the novel procession of vessels,\r\ndisplaying emblems of mourning, the solemn landing at noon, an imposing\r\ntrain moving amid houses hung with black, \"a Sabbath-like stillness\"\r\nresting on the city, \"The solemn minute gun, the wail of the distant bell,\r\nthe far-off spires shrouded in the display of grief, the hearse and its\r\nattendant mourners waiting on the spot, alone bore witness that the pulse\r\nof life still beat within the city, that a whole people in voiceless woe\r\nwere about to receive and consign to earth all that was mortal of a great\r\nand good citizen.\"\r\n\r\nAppropriately and impressively Mr. Pinkney closes his description of this\r\nforever memorable demonstration by quoting Carlyle's \"How touching is the\r\nloyalty of men to their sovereign man.\"[56]\r\n\r\nSome men reserve out of the pillage of their fellows a great fund to\r\nsignalize their graves. Stronger cars must be made, bridges strengthened,\r\nand too narrow passages avoided by long circuits in order that their huge\r\npiles be transported to the conspicuous spot selected in a fashionable\r\ncemetery. How the funerals which a weeping people give a Calhoun,\r\nLiebknecht, Pingree, Altgeld, and other true ones dwindle such monuments\r\ninto smallness and contempt!\r\n\r\nI must add something here to what has been said in the foregoing of\r\nCalhoun's speeches. Somebody must after a while do for him what the\r\ncompilation called \"The Great Speeches and Orations\" has done so well for\r\nWebster. His very greatest effort is that against the force bill,\r\ndelivered in the United States senate February 15 and 16, 1833. As an\r\nappeal in behalf of the rights of the minority against the oppressive\r\nmajority it is unequalled. All through it, from its most befitting\r\nexordium to the righteous indignation of the closing sentence, there are\r\npassages which \"the world will not willingly let die.\" No one who has ever\r\ngiven it attention can forget the paragraph defending Carolina against the\r\ncharge of passion and delusion; that demolishing as by a tornado the\r\nassertion of a senator that the bill was a measure of peace; the far-famed\r\none as to metaphysical reasoning; what is said as to the nature of the\r\ncontest between Persia and Greece; the rupture in the tribes of Israel\r\ngraphically expounded; the first mention of the government of \"the\r\nconcurring majority\" as distinct from and far better than that of the\r\nabsolute majority; the lesson to us of the Roman tribunes. To read this\r\nspeech becomingly, purge yourself of all prejudice; by an adequate effort\r\nof the historical imagination see all the main things of the then\r\nsituation, and put yourself fully in Calhoun's place; so that you cannot\r\nfail to feel all of his deep earnestness. You will have succeeded when you\r\ncan rightly appreciate this outburst:\r\n\r\n    \"Will you collect money when it is acknowledged that it is not wanted?\r\n    He who earns the money, who digs it from the earth with the sweat of\r\n    his brow, has a just title to it against the universe. No one has a\r\n    right to touch it without his consent except his government, and this\r\n    only to the extent of its legitimate wants. To take more is robbery;\r\n    and you propose by this bill to enforce robbery by murder.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I pronounced that against the force bill, the greatest of his\r\nspeeches, I was not unmindful of his last, that of March 4, 1850, not\r\nfour weeks before his death. I can hardly class it as a speech. It was a\r\nrevelation of the woe in store for America if the abolition movement was\r\nnot checked. Its analysis and demonstration of the preponderant power of\r\nthe north, and its retrospection over the progressive stages by which the\r\nformer equilibrium of the sections had been destroyed, are as\r\nclear-sighted as its prediction. Never in all history has an actor in a\r\nrevolution described its course behind him so understandingly, nor its\r\nfuture course with such true prophecy.\r\n\r\nLet us give you the fewest possible selected brief passages that will do\r\nsomething towards possessing you of the core of Calhoun's valedictory to\r\nthe United States and the South.\r\n\r\nThis is first in order: \"How can the union be saved? There is but one way\r\nby which it can with any certainty; and that is by a full and final\r\nsettlement, on the principles of justice, of all the questions at issue\r\nbetween the two sections. The south asks for justice, simple justice, and\r\nless she ought not to take. She has no compromise to offer but the\r\nconstitution, and no concession or surrender to make.\"\r\n\r\nThe vital concern of his section against abolition, and what it must do to\r\navoid it, he tells in these passages:\r\n\r\n    \"[The South] regards the relation [of master and slave] as one which\r\n    cannot be destroyed without subjecting the two races to the greatest\r\n    calamity, and the section to poverty, desolation, and wretchedness,\r\n    and accordingly she feels bound, by every consideration of interest\r\n    and safety, to defend it.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Is it not certain that if something is not done to arrest it [the\r\n    abolition movement], the south will be forced to choose between\r\n    abolition and secession?\"\r\n\r\nIf the south must choose secession, he justifies her by the example of\r\nWashington, with a calm and repose that prove his deepest conviction of\r\nits rightfulness, and with a power that cannot be confuted. He says:\r\n\r\n    [\"The Union cannot] be saved by invoking the name of the illustrious\r\n    southerner whose mortal remains repose on the western bank of the\r\n    Potomac. He was one of us--a slaveholder and a planter. We have\r\n    studied his history, and find nothing in it to justify submission to\r\n    wrong. On the contrary, his great fame rests on the solid foundation\r\n    that, while he was careful to avoid doing wrong to others, he was\r\n    prompt and decided in repelling wrong. I trust that, in this respect,\r\n    we have profited by his example.\r\n\r\n    Nor can we find anything in his history to deter us from seceding from\r\n    the union should it fail to fulfil the objects for which it was\r\n    instituted, by being permanently and hopelessly converted into a means\r\n    of oppressing instead of protecting us. On the contrary, we find much\r\n    in his example to encourage us should we be forced to the extremity of\r\n    deciding between submission and disunion.\r\n\r\n    There existed then as well as now a union,--that between the parent\r\n    country and her then colonies. It was a union that had much to endear\r\n    it to the people of the colonies. Under its protecting and\r\n    superintending care the colonies were planted, and grew up and\r\n    prospered, through a long course of years, until they became populous\r\n    and wealthy. Its benefits were not limited to them. Their extensive\r\n    agricultural and other productions gave birth to a flourishing\r\n    commerce which richly rewarded the parent country for the trouble and\r\n    expense of establishing and protecting them. Washington was born and\r\n    grew up to manhood under that union. He acquired his early distinction\r\n    in its service; and there is every reason to believe that he was\r\n    devotedly attached to it. But his devotion was a rational one. He was\r\n    attached to it, not as an end, but as a means to an end. When it\r\n    failed to fulfil its end, and, instead of affording protection, was\r\n    converted into the means of oppressing the colonies, he did not\r\n    hesitate to draw his sword and head the great movement by which that\r\n    union was forever severed, and the independence of these States\r\n    established. This was the great and crowning glory of his life, which\r\n    has spread his fame over the whole globe, and will transmit it to the\r\n    latest posterity.\"\r\n\r\nWith what moving entreaty does he thus adjure the victorious north:\r\n\r\n    The north \"has only to wish it to accomplish it--to do justice by\r\n    conceding to the south an equal right in the acquired territory, and\r\n    to do her duty by causing the stipulations relative to fugitive slaves\r\n    to be faithfully fulfilled, to cease the agitation of the slavery\r\n    question, and to provide for the insertion of a provision in the\r\n    constitution, by an amendment, which will restore to the south, in\r\n    substance, the power she possessed of protecting herself before the\r\n    equilibrium between the sections was destroyed by the action of the\r\n    government. There will be no difficulty in devising such a\r\n    provision--one that will protect the south and which at the same time\r\n    will improve and strengthen the government instead of impairing and\r\n    weakening it.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The responsibility of saving the union rests on the north, and not on\r\n    the south. The south cannot save it by any act of hers, and the north\r\n    may save it without any sacrifice whatever, unless to do justice and\r\n    to perform her duties under the constitution should be regarded by her\r\n    as a sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThis sleepless watchman since 1835 had again and again blown the trumpet\r\nas the sword of disunion was coming upon the land. Now, the grave yawning\r\nbefore him, he sees that sword nearer and sharper, and conscious that it\r\nis his last public duty he sends forth to all his country a blast of\r\nwarning more earnest and more solemn than ever. Warning that the bloodiest\r\nof all wars is coming, and that between brothers. Warning--it is the whole\r\nof this dread deliverance. Here is the first paragraph:\r\n\r\n    \"I have, senators, believed from the first that the agitation of the\r\n    subject of slavery would, if not prevented by some timely and\r\n    effective measure, end in disunion. Entertaining this opinion, I have\r\n    on all proper occasions endeavored to call the attention of both the\r\n    two great parties which divide the country to adopt some measure to\r\n    prevent so great a disaster, but without success. The agitation has\r\n    been permitted to proceed, with almost no attempt to resist it, until\r\n    it has reached a point where it can no longer be disguised or denied\r\n    that the union is in danger. You have thus had forced upon you the\r\n    greatest and the gravest question that can ever come under your\r\n    consideration,--How can the union be preserved?\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is the last paragraph:\r\n\r\n    \"I have now, senators, done my duty in expressing my opinions fully\r\n    and candidly on this solemn occasion. In doing so, I have been\r\n    governed by the motives which have governed me in all stages of the\r\n    agitation of the slavery question since its commencement. I have\r\n    exerted myself during the whole period to arrest it with the intention\r\n    of saving the union, if it could be done, and if it could not, to save\r\n    the section where it has pleased providence to cast my lot, and which\r\n    I sincerely believe has justice and the constitution on its side.\r\n    Having faithfully done my duty to the best of my ability both to the\r\n    union and my section, throughout this agitation, I shall have the\r\n    consolation, let what will come, that I am free from all\r\n    responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nHad abolition been in charge of men, Calhoun, claiming, as appeared to\r\nthem, the most palpable rights under current views of justice, under the\r\nconstitution, under the law, and under patriotic duty, would have\r\nprevailed. He never understood, no more than the abolitionists themselves\r\ndid, that providence was making an instrument of abolition to remove the\r\nonly danger to the American union, and that providence was not under human\r\nconstitutions, laws, and convictions of duty. As you meditate this\r\nsuperhuman achievement of the true citizen in his last stand for his\r\ndoomed section, does it not help you to appreciate better the high saying\r\nof the Greeks, that the struggle of a good man against fate is the most\r\nelevating of all spectacles?\r\n\r\nThe speeches that will find place in the selection suggested above will\r\nnot enrapture the reader with the proud diction, learning, ornateness, and\r\nexquisite finish of Webster, but he will find them everywhere to be proofs\r\nof the dictum of Faust:\r\n\r\n  \"Es traegt Verstand and rechter Sinn\r\n  Mit wenig Kunst sich selber vor;\r\n  Und wenn's euch Ernst ist, was zu sagen,\r\n  Ist's noethig, Worten nachzujagen?\"[57]\r\n\r\nHe will also note that many of the wisest and most eloquent passages are\r\nalmost the extreme of choice, but chaste and severe, expression. Here read\r\naloud the passage as to Washington quoted above from the speech of March\r\n4, 1850, and you will hardly dissent.\r\n\r\nAmerica owes it to Calhoun to publish a cheap edition of his best\r\nspeeches, and also of his \"Dissertation on Government.\"\r\n\r\nA word as to the \"Dissertation\" and the \"Discourse on the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\" The project of these two books lay close to his heart\r\nfor many years. He intended them as his last admonitions to the people of\r\nthe great republic. Doubtless the special object of his retirement was to\r\nfinish them, but he had to return to the senate. What we have of the books\r\nwas written in the little leisure which he snatched from the pressure of\r\npublic duties, domestic affairs, and ill-health. The resoluteness with\r\nwhich, in the midst of these difficulties, he worked at the self-imposed\r\ntask proves a lofty and unselfish love. He did not finish them to his\r\nsatisfaction. Darwin did not do that with his epoch-making \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" for he found there was no need to do so. I believe that, as the\r\nessentials of the belonging part of evolution are all to be found in the\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" so all the essentials of Calhoun's great doctrine of\r\ngovernment are fully set forth in his two books. To me the \"Dissertation\"\r\nseems complete. I note with pleasure that, though slowly, it is steadily\r\nclimbing to the lofty height which is its due place in the world's\r\nestimation. And the \"Discourse\"--of which he did not live to finish the\r\nfinal draft--surely leads all the productions of the State sovereignty\r\nschool. The providence which opposed his wishes was kind to his country,\r\nto the world, and to himself in calling him from his desk; for it allowed\r\nhim to get Texas and Oregon for us, to give mankind his Oregon speech, and\r\nhis last, and thus to finish his good work and make his fame full.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is intended to influence my readers to turn away from Von\r\nHolst, who wrote Calhoun's life, with the smoke and dust of the brothers'\r\nwar still in his eyes, and from Trent, who merely says ditto to Mr. Burke,\r\nto Stephens, to the great Webster, to the touching \"Carolina Tribute,\" to\r\nthe happy and appreciative sketch of Pinkney, to the man himself and his\r\ngrand career, in order to find the facts and principles by which one of\r\nAmerica's very greatest ought to be judged. And I do hope that they now\r\nbegin to discern that Calhoun was nothing at all of a doctrinaire, nor\r\nchop-logic, nor fanatic, nor professional politician, nor ignorant and\r\nover-zealous partisan, but was the very height of practical talent and an\r\nextraordinarily successful man of affairs, of more than Roman integrity,\r\nconscientious and diligent beyond almost all others in the duties of his\r\nplace, and a foremost statesman of wide and profound culture. Whether I\r\nhave accomplished my design or not, let me beg you to read for yourself\r\nwith careful attention what Webster said of him in the United States\r\nsenate just after his death. Remember two things as you read: (1) The\r\nspeaker and the dead had been opposed to one another in politics for more\r\nthan twenty years, the former being the great exponent of free-labor\r\nnationalization and the other the great exponent of slave-labor\r\nnationalization; (2) nobody ever weighed his public utterances more\r\ncarefully than did Webster, and that he would not say anything which he\r\ndid not believe, even as a politeness.\r\n\r\nLet us now try to follow with proper discernment this man whom we hope we\r\nhave proved to be good and wise through his titanic defence of the cause\r\nwhich fate had decreed must fail. As our explanation of how evolution, and\r\nnot the north on one side nor the south on the other, brought forward the\r\ncrisis in which slavery, the sole menace of American dismemberment, was to\r\nperish, is so nearly complete, we can be much briefer in the rest of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe true beginning here is with the proposition that everything which\r\nCalhoun did as the southern leader was prompted by a righteous conscience\r\nand the highest and most unselfish patriotism. He was the very first to\r\ndiscern the full menace of abolition to the welfare of the people he\r\nrepresented. And when years afterwards the situation became darker and\r\nmore serious, and more and more importunately put to him the question, If\r\nabolition can be avoided only by leaving the union, what ought the south\r\nto do? he answered to himself, with the fullest approval of his\r\nconscience, she must go out; for manifestly it is her paramount duty to\r\nprotect her citizens against any such invasion of their rights as\r\nabolition. But he had no illusion as to peaceable secession; and he\r\nlikewise worshipped the union, believing with deepest conviction that it\r\nis far better for neighboring communities to be federated than\r\nindependent. And the memories of the great American history were as sweet\r\nto him as they were to Webster. To sum up, only one thing in his opinion\r\ncould justify secession. That was control of the federal government by the\r\nabolitionists. If that comes, the south must seek her independence, even\r\nif it is beyond a sea of blood.\r\n\r\nAbolition was on its way then to overturn the supports of comfort and\r\ndomestic peace in the south, as it afterwards did. Suppose Webster had\r\nseen the imminence of such a dreadful evil to New England, would he not\r\nhave felt that his duty to his section was now the great thing? My brother\r\nwho wore the blue, ought he not to have so felt? If the union had been\r\nturned into a course which would not only impoverish and beggar the people\r\nof New England, but would for long years actually deprive the masses of\r\nthose modes of business and labor by which they were subsisting themselves\r\nand their families, can it be thought that Webster, with his exalted\r\nadmiration of the fathers, who endured all privations to win liberty from\r\ntheir oppressors, would not have been heart and soul for secession?\r\n\r\nThe only actual difference between the two great patriots was that to\r\nCalhoun the dread alternative of looking outside the union for defence and\r\nprotection of home and fireside was commended by a cruel fate, while a\r\nkind fate withheld it from Webster.\r\n\r\nI shall corroborate the foregoing by some pertinent excerpts from\r\nCalhoun's speeches in the United States senate. And as my purpose is to\r\nbuild everywhere in this book, as far as possible, upon only the most\r\nobvious facts and to vouch therefor the most accessible authorities, I\r\ntake the excerpts from quotations made by Von Holst:\r\n\r\n    \"It is to us a vital question. It involves not only our liberty, but,\r\n    what is greater (if to freeman anything can be), existence itself. The\r\n    relation which now exists between the two races in the slaveholding\r\n    States has existed for two centuries. It has grown with our growth,\r\n    and strengthened with our strength. It has entered into and modified\r\n    all our institutions, civil and political. None other can be\r\n    substituted. We will not, cannot, permit it to be destroyed.... Come\r\n    what will, should it cost every drop of blood and every cent of\r\n    property, we must defend ourselves; and if compelled, we should stand\r\n    justified by all laws, human and divine; ... we would act under an\r\n    imperious necessity. There would be to us but one alternative,--to\r\n    triumph or perish as a people.\"[58]\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"To destroy the existing relations would be to destroy this prosperity\r\n    [of the southern States] and to place the two races in a state of\r\n    conflict, which must end in the expulsion or extirpation of one or the\r\n    other. No other can be substituted compatible with their peace or\r\n    security. The difficulty is in the diversity of the races.... Social\r\n    and political equality between them is impossible. The causes lie too\r\n    deep in the principles of our nature to be surmounted. But, without\r\n    such equality, to change the present condition of the African race,\r\n    were it possible, would be but to change the form of slavery.\"[59]\r\n\r\n    \"He must be blind, indeed, who does not perceive that the subversion\r\n    of a relation which must be followed with such disastrous consequences\r\n    can be effected only by convulsions that would devastate the country,\r\n    burst asunder the bonds of union, and engulf in a sea of blood the\r\n    institutions of the country. It is madness to suppose that the\r\n    slaveholding States would quietly submit to be sacrificed. Every\r\n    consideration--interest, duty, and humanity, the love of country, the\r\n    sense of wrong, hatred of oppressors and treacherous and faithless\r\n    confederates, and, finally, despair--would impel them to the most\r\n    daring and desperate resistance in defence of property, family,\r\n    country, liberty, and existence.\"[60]\r\n\r\nThe student unfamiliar with the confederate side of the brothers' war can\r\nfind the whole of it clearly stated in these short passages re-enforced by\r\nthe cognate ones quoted above from the speech of March 4, 1850. The\r\nmaintenance of the then existing relations between white and black was\r\nvital both to liberty and existence. Because of the world-wide diversity\r\nof the two races they cannot be socially or politically equal (a subject\r\nwhich we will deal with specially after a while). And it was the duty of\r\nthe south to fight to the bitter end \"in defence of property, family,\r\ncountry, liberty, and existence.\" This is the marrow of the quotations.\r\nThey convincingly show not only the grasp of the statesman, but the\r\nprescience of the prophet, as has been plainly proved by the brothers' war\r\nand what followed in its track.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the tariff, which in his judgment favored the manufacturing\r\nat the expense of the staple States, seems to have been the first thing\r\nthat led Calhoun to take a pro-Southern stand in politics.[61] It finally\r\nproduced the famous nullification episode, which we have already somewhat\r\ndiscussed. In this his platform was simply anti-tariff. But the current,\r\nwithout his being aware of it, was carrying him resistlessly and rapidly\r\non into the anti-abolition career in which his life ended. It was the\r\npetition presented in 1835 to congress against slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia which, it seems, was the first thing that opened his eyes to the\r\nmenace of abolition. Note his wonderful foresight. Compare him with Cicero\r\njust before the outbreak of the war between Pompey and Caesar; or with\r\nDemosthenes before Philip discloses his purpose towards Greece; or with\r\nCarl Marx, predicting the future of co-operative enterprise. Cicero almost\r\nforesees nothing--he mostly fears; Marx is utterly mistaken. The\r\ndivination of Demosthenes is far superior, and it is clear; yet it is\r\nbelated when it comes. But Calhoun sees with \"appalling clearness,\" as Von\r\nHolst says, all the storm-cloud from which tempest and tornado will ravage\r\nthe entire land, just as its first speck shows on the horizon; and nobody\r\nelse will see that. If this abolition movement is not stopped in its\r\nincipiency, it will soon get beyond all control. This he says over and\r\nover in his public place. What a horrible spectre of the future haunted\r\nhim for the rest of his life! The south in her self-defence forced out of\r\nthe union, and then perhaps overcome in war. After her braves have\r\nperished, and their dear ones at home have been plunged in the depths of\r\nwant, the triumphant abolitionists will have the former slaves to lord it\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nHis conscience commanded him to stand by slavery as the fundamental\r\ncondition of his people's well-being; it also at the same time commanded\r\nhim to strain all his energies to save the union by making it the\r\nprotector instead of the assailant of slavery. This was the insuperable\r\ntask which the powers in the unseen put him in the treadmill to do. From\r\nthe time he commenced the discussion of the anti-slavery petitions until\r\nhis exclamation over the \"poor south,\" on his death-bed, life was to him\r\nbut a deepening agony of solicitude and utmost effort,--solicitude for his\r\ncountry and section, effort to avert the danger that became greater and\r\nmore awful to him every day. He strove after remedies under the\r\nconstitution. The more he recalled the success of the single stand of\r\nSouth Carolina against the tariff, the prouder he became of being the\r\nauthor of nullification. Its dearness to him was that it was peaceable as\r\nwell as efficient. The better opinion of the State-rights school is that\r\nnullification is an absurdity, and that South Carolina's only true remedy\r\nagainst the tariff was to secede if it were not repealed. But he knew\r\nbetter than everybody else that secession meant internecine war between\r\nthe sections, and this influenced him to exalt peaceable nullification\r\nabove bloody secession.\r\n\r\nIt needs not to consider each barrier, whether party combinations,\r\nadmission of new slave States, legislation, etc., that he tried to erect\r\nagainst the incoming oceanic wave. But we must briefly consider the\r\namendment of the constitution which he proposed. He wanted the north and\r\nthe south each to have a president, as he said, \"to be so elected, as that\r\nthe two should be constituted the special organs and representatives of\r\nthe respective sections in the executive department of the government; and\r\nrequiring each to approve all the acts of congress before they shall\r\nbecome laws.\"[62] Do this, he urged, and neither section can use the\r\npowers of government to injure the other, for whatever proposed law\r\nmenaces a section will be vetoed by its president. It profits the student\r\nof the science of government to consider the historical examples which\r\nCalhoun adduced here. They are indeed so apt that the hearing which has\r\never been denied him should be granted him at least academically. He says:\r\n\"The two most distinguished constitutional governments of antiquity both\r\nin respect to permanence and power had a dual executive. I refer to those\r\nof Sparta and Rome.\"[63]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to be informed that those same wise Iroquois from whom\r\nour fathers probably got the precedent of the old confederation, put in\r\npractice something very like what Calhoun advises. We append both the\r\naccount and instructive comment of Morgan:\r\n\r\n    \"When the Iroquois confederacy was formed, or soon after that event,\r\n    two permanent war-chiefships were created and named.... As general\r\n    commanders they had charge of the military affairs of the confederacy,\r\n    and the command of its joint forces when united in a general\r\n    expedition.... The creation of two principal war-chiefs instead of\r\n    one, and with equal power, argues a subtle and calculating policy to\r\n    prevent the domination of a single man even in their military affairs.\r\n    They did without experience precisely as the Romans did in creating\r\n    two consuls instead of one, after they had abolished the office of\r\n    _rex_. Two consuls would balance the military power between them, and\r\n    prevent either from becoming supreme. Among the Iroquois this office\r\n    never became influential.\"[64]\r\n\r\nBut Calhoun lays much more stress upon another example,--that of the\r\nprotection which the Roman plebeians got in tribunes elected from their\r\nown order alone, which tribunes could veto any act of the lawmaking\r\norgans, all of which were then actually in the hands of their oppressors,\r\nthat is, the order of patricians; the result being that in course of time\r\nthe plebeians achieved equality.[65]\r\n\r\nOf course the inevitable could not be put off. And yet ought we not to\r\nadmire the inventive genius of the statesman who of all proposed the\r\nremedy that promised the best? And ought we not also to cherish in\r\naffectionate memory this last and high effort of Calhoun to avert a\r\ndreadful brothers' war at hand, the end and consequences of which nobody\r\ncould then forecast?\r\n\r\nThe situation of Rome granting tribunes to the plebs was widely different\r\nfrom ours. That was a case of giving a veto to one class only, and to a\r\nclass which belonged to the entire body politic. Calhoun proposed not a\r\nsingle veto, but two; neither one to be given such a class as we have just\r\nmentioned, but a veto to each one of two geographical divisions, in one of\r\nwhich there was a developed, and in the other a nascent and almost\r\ncomplete, nationality, these two nationalities already closed with each\r\nother in a life and death grapple. His hope must have been to confine the\r\ncombatants to an arena which could be effectually policed by the civil\r\npower, and in which all fighting except with buttoned foils be prevented.\r\nWe may be almost sure that his heart broke when that presentiment which\r\noften comes to the dying as clear as sunlight revealed the bloody war that\r\nwas quickening its approach.\r\n\r\nO the unutterable pathos of his life from 1835 to 1850! During this time\r\nhe was like the mother of a boy whom consumption has marked for its own.\r\nIn advance of all others she reads the first symptom, nay, she anticipates\r\nit. All those who believe that they know him as well as she does, laugh at\r\nher fears with unsympathetic incredulity. But her eyes never fail to see\r\ngrim death at the door, although bravely she hopes against hope, and\r\nfights, fights, fights. Inexorably, relentlessly the end, which others now\r\nbegin to discern, comes on, but until the last breath of her darling she\r\nhas ever some suggestion of change of place or climate, of a new remedy,\r\nof something else to be done. It is the supreme tragedy of her trial that\r\nwhile outwardly she is all self-gratifying love, inwardly she is all\r\nself-consuming misery. We say the love of a mother is greater than all\r\nother. But we know that she loves her country better than she does her\r\nchild. Patriotism is as yet the strongest love of all. Realize that our\r\nexalted patriot was tending and nursing the cause of his country. Think of\r\nthe noble Lee, his career of victory over, wearing away the winter at\r\nPetersburg, hourly expecting his line, so tensely stretched in order to\r\nface overwhelming odds, to break; think of him after it does break, on the\r\nretreat, when he has discovered that his supplies have gone wrong; and\r\nthink of him when he must yield the sword as ever memorable as Hannibal's.\r\nThe world has given Lee, and will long give him, rains of gracious tears.\r\nBut he was never plagued with Calhoun's sharpened eyes to future disaster,\r\nand he was confident that he would reach the mountains almost until the\r\nvery moment of surrender. Think rather of the great sufferers for high\r\ncauses,--Bonnivard, wearing a pathway over the stone floor of his prison;\r\nLear, of all of Shakspeare's heroes, in the deepest gulf of misfortune;\r\nand especially of Calvary and the crucifixion, for Jesus travailed for his\r\nbrothers and sisters. It is here you must look for the like of Calhoun.\r\nFor fifteen years that \"mass of moan\" which was coming to his dear ones\r\npierced his ears plainer and plainer and made his heart sicker and sicker,\r\nand during this long bloody sweat he gave the rarest devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice to his country which he feared more and more was to plunge\r\nover the precipice. As we recall the scene of his death it makes us\r\nrejoice to know that the cross he had borne so long has at last been cast\r\noff and he has entered into the rest of the martyr-patriot. Then it\r\noccurs to us that he carried with him his affections,--too lofty not to be\r\nimmortal,--and we cannot believe that the sad spirit ever smiled until\r\nWade Hampton, twenty-six years afterwards, re-erected white domination in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nDixie will never forget that one who of all her sons loved her best and\r\nsuffered for her the most. And it is my conviction that each noblest soul\r\nof the north will after a while revere in Calhoun the American parallel to\r\nthe moral grandeur of Dante, of whom Michaelangelo said he would\r\ncheerfully endure his exile and all his misfortunes for his glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWEBSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nCalhoun was the pre-eminent champion of the southern cause in the union,\r\nwhile Toombs was that of southern nationalization seeking independence.\r\nWebster was the pre-eminent champion of American nationalization seeking\r\ncontinental union. Toombs and Webster are therefore in antithesis; and it\r\nwill be well for me to begin the chapter by anticipating some of the\r\ncharacteristics of the former, who will be treated at large later on, and\r\nbriefly contrasting the two.\r\n\r\nBy nature Toombs was so prone to action that even in his daily\r\nrecreation--talk with the nearest to him was by far the most of it--his\r\nimmense and tireless outpouring of fine phrase, wisdom, and wit was the\r\nincreasing wonder of all who knew him. Webster's proneness was to repose,\r\nalmost indolence. He often seemed lethargic. His activity could be excited\r\nonly by the pressure of necessity. This difference between the two showed\r\nitself very markedly in their several careers. Toombs, coming to the bar\r\nin the last year of his nonage, took the profession at once to his heart,\r\nsettled in his native county, in a lucrative field of practice, overcame\r\nall hindrances of natural defects and insufficient training seemingly by a\r\nmere act of will, and in four or five years his collecting a\r\nthousand-dollar fee in an adjoining county was no very uncommon thing.\r\nWhen he was twenty-eight he was a fully developed lawyer and advocate on\r\nevery side--law, equity, and criminal--of the courts of that prosperous\r\nplanting community, then overrunning with cases of importance, and his\r\nannual income from practice was $15,000. Webster went up much more slowly.\r\nHe read long and industriously; was not called until he was twenty-three;\r\nfor the next two and a half years was content with an income of $600 or\r\n$700; and then for nine years at Portsmouth his average income was $2,000\r\nyearly. Even when Webster at thirty-four removed to Boston he was hardly\r\nas a lawyer the equal of Toombs at twenty-eight; and I believe that the\r\nlatter was always the superior lawyer. The greater reputation of Webster\r\nis due to the greater reputation of his cases, and of the tribunal wherein\r\nhe long held the lead.\r\n\r\nWe see a like difference between the two in congress. Webster shirks the\r\nroutine duties of his place to gain opportunity for practice in the United\r\nStates supreme court. Toombs stays away from all courts during the\r\nsession, and gives every measure before the body to which he belongs its\r\nproper attention, study, and labor. But the performance by him of all the\r\nmany duties of representative or senator, whether little or great, with\r\nunparalleled diligence, ability, and splendor, has been so completely\r\nobscured by the few of Webster's great congressional exploits, that it is\r\nnot now cared for by anybody.\r\n\r\nThe greater lawyer and the greater congressman has been accorded the\r\nlesser renown. This is because of the relation which each one bore to the\r\ntwo publics which I have tried to make you understand,--the southern\r\npublic and the northern public. Toombs's legal career was mainly in the\r\ncourts of his own State. It was not much heard of outside, in even the\r\nsouthern public, until his extraordinarily meritorious discharge of\r\ncongressional duties involving a mastery of law was observed. Although\r\nsome of Webster's cases in State courts were celebrated, his greatest\r\nones, to be considered in a moment, were won in the United States supreme\r\ncourt, in the eyes of both publics watching intently. The highest\r\naccomplishments of Toombs in the non-sectional parts of his congressional\r\ncareer were almost matters of indifference at the time to both publics,\r\nbecoming steadily more absorbed in pro- and anti-slavery politics; and\r\nwhat he did in the other part of it excited the hostility of the northern\r\npublic, and brought him obloquy instead of good name. The few memorable\r\ndeeds of Webster in congress were victorious vindications of the cause\r\nclearest of all to the northern, that is, the free-labor, public. That\r\npublic has at last not only conquered, but it has annexed the other as a\r\npart of itself. And so Toombs's fame as a lawyer and statesman has been\r\nleft so far behind that it can hardly hope ever to have impartial and fair\r\ncomparison with that of Webster.\r\n\r\nJust one more parallel, and I shall proceed with my sketch. Each one of\r\nthe two, in order to accept his mission of leadership, was plainly made by\r\nhis destiny to abandon a previously cherished doctrine for a new and\r\ncontrary one. Toombs was once an ardent union man, Webster was once almost\r\na secessionist. In his Taylor speech, made in the United States house of\r\nrepresentatives July 1, 1848, speaking of the then expected acquisition of\r\nterritory, Toombs said:\r\n\r\n    \"All the rest of this continent is not worth our glorious union, much\r\n    less these contemptible provinces which now threaten us with such\r\n    evils. It were better that we should throw back the worthless boon,\r\n    and let the inhabitants work out their own destiny, than that we\r\n    should endanger our peace, our safety, and our nationality by their\r\n    incorporation in our union.\"\r\n\r\nThe silly embargo measures, making war upon our own citizens instead of\r\nour enemies, had deeply injured New England interests. On their heel came\r\nthe second war with England, into which the government of France had, as\r\nMr. Lodge says, \"tricked us ... by most profligate lying.\"[66] This war\r\nparalyzed the production and occupations of Webster's people.\r\n\r\nA speech made by him July 4, 1812, is \"a strong, calm statement of the\r\ngrounds of opposition to the war.\"[67] Mr. Lodge quotes and emphasizes a\r\npassage as proof that Webster, although a federalist, and the majority of\r\nhis party in New England were--to use the words of the same\r\nauthor--\"prepared to go to the very edge of the narrow legal line which\r\ndivides constitutional opposition from treasonable resistance,\"[68] was\r\nthen standing by the union with might and main. This quotation, separated\r\nfrom its circumstances and the immediate sequel, strongly supports the\r\ncontention. The speech being printed, circulated widely among those\r\nfederalists who were gravitating so strongly towards \"treasonable\r\nresistance.\" By reason of it Webster was chosen as a delegate to a\r\nconvention, held the next month. This man, whom Mr. Lodge would have us\r\nbelieve to be so fixedly counter to the then uppermost revolutionary\r\nsentiment of his party, was chosen to be their mouthpiece. He wrote their\r\nreport--the \"Rockingham Memorial\" in the form of a letter to President\r\nMadison. Mr. Lodge thus contrasts the report and the speech. \"In one point\r\nthe memorial differed curiously from the oration of the month before. The\r\nlatter pointed to the suffrage as the mode of redress; the former\r\ndistinctly hinted at and almost threatened secession, even while it\r\ndeplored a dissolution of the union as a possible result of the\r\nadministration's policy.\"[69] Then the biographer most confidently states\r\nthat in the speech Webster was declaring his own views, but in the other\r\ndocument he was declaring those of members of his party.\r\n\r\nBut the average American will be sure that those familiar with the speech\r\nat the time did not strain its counsels as far away from their own as Mr.\r\nLodge does, otherwise they would not have elected him as delegate; and\r\nfurther, he never would have made their report for them unless he had been\r\nknown to entertain their own sentiments.[70]\r\n\r\nThe popular wave that he had thus mounted carried the draftsman of the\r\n\"Rockingham Memorial\" into congress, where, while British armies were\r\nactually treading our soil, he voted against the taxes proposed for\r\nnational defence. Mr. Lodge does not go the full length of sustaining this\r\nconduct.[71] The severe comment of another biographer will be cordially\r\napproved by average readers, northern and southern.[72]\r\n\r\nThe facts properly considered show that from the speech of July 4, 1812,\r\non, Webster, although he stood aloof from the Hartford convention\r\nmovement, was in full sympathy with the federalists of New England, whom\r\nthe national government by its unrighteous oppressions had driven to\r\ncontemplate disunion as a possible measure of self-protection.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of Webster towards the union was entirely contrary to that\r\nwhich afterwards became his power and glory among his countrymen. We wish\r\nit noted that as he changed with the people of New England from\r\nanti-tariff to pro-tariff politics, he likewise changed with them in their\r\nprinciples as to the union; and that Toombs went with the south, in an\r\nopposite direction, that is, from embrace to rejection of the union.\r\n\r\nHaving in the foregoing brought out the prominent characteristics of\r\nWebster's nature and career, and having also impressed you that he, like\r\nall other great statesmen, could lead only by following his people, I will\r\ncursorily trace him from stage to stage through his development. He was\r\nselected in infancy, if not before by providence, to be made not the\r\nexpounder of the constitution, but the invincible defender of the union.\r\nWhen his activity begins, he is at first to consolidate the union by the\r\nmanagement of some great law cases, and delivery of occasional addresses\r\nto popular assemblies; and afterwards in his high place as United States\r\nsenator he is to demonstrate to the northern public its complete guaranty\r\nof their highest material interests, and set it in their hearts above all\r\nthings else. Thus did providence assign to him the preservation of the\r\ngreatest of all democracies, to the end that there be no break in the\r\nfuture course of human improvement.\r\n\r\nBefore his activity begins the powers train him. They gave him a long\r\neducation, and a slow growth as a statesman. He could never remember when\r\nhe had been unable to read. His feeble physique while a child shielded him\r\nfrom the labor required of the other children, and permitted him to enjoy\r\nbooks. Early he soaked his mind in the King James version of the bible and\r\nother good English standards. As he grew apace his opportunities of\r\nreading were far better than those of Calhoun, who never saw even a\r\ncirculating library until he was in his thirteenth year, and soon was\r\ntaken away from that. These opportunities he used in his leisurely way.\r\nHis mind was strong and his memory good, and he digested and kept under\r\ncommand what he read. His schooling and college course were in the main\r\ncontinuous. He got to Dartmouth at fifteen, where he spent four years.\r\nHere he made the reputation of being the best speaker and writer of all\r\nthe students. In his study for the law he took ample time. And in his\r\nfirst years of practice he had much leisure. Besides revelling in the\r\nLatin classics, Shakspeare, Milton, Pope, and Cowper, and much history, he\r\nwas keenly observant of what was going on about him. We know how Jeremiah\r\nMason gave him lessons both in law, rhetoric, and elocution to his great\r\nadvancement. We know too that his interest in current political questions\r\nwas vigilant. He took his seat in congress May, 1813, being then a little\r\nover thirty-one. His speech against a bill to encourage enlistments made\r\nJanuary 14, the next year, shows, as Mr. Lodge says, that \"he was now\r\nmaster of the style at which he aimed.\"[73] Of this peculiar style I shall\r\nsay something after a while. Mention of his greatest exploits in\r\nconsolidating the union is now in order.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is his conduct of the Dartmouth college case in the\r\nUnited States supreme court. It is entirely out of place for me to give\r\neven the briefest notice of the details which fill Mr. Shirley's unique\r\nbook.[74] Little more than emphasis of the effect of the decision to knit\r\nmore closely the bonds of union between the States is required. This\r\neffect will be considered more carefully when we comment on Gibbons _v._\r\nOgden, which finishes the important work commenced in the other. It needs\r\nonly to remind the reader now that the protection of contracts against\r\nimpairing State legislation has contributed probably more than anything\r\nelse to the prosperous development of American internal trade and\r\ncommerce,--a most potent factor in consolidating the union,--and that this\r\nprotection originates in the Dartmouth college decision. But there is\r\nsomething special to be said of Webster as to the case. He did not stress\r\nthe constitutional point--that upon which the judgment was finally\r\nplaced--either in his law-brief or argument. The victory is all due to his\r\nconsummate management of the court, especially of the chief-justice. The\r\nlatter really found the true ground of the decision. But the powers had\r\nWebster in hand, and it suited their purposes to crown their _Liebling_\r\nwith the credit of the decision. When he found out the reasons given for\r\nthe ruling he had won, I fancy that a good angel of his destiny whispered\r\nin his ear he ought to have discerned that the weal of all classes of his\r\nentire country, and not merely that of its colleges, was at stake in his\r\ncase, and he must never in the future overlook such an opportunity again.\r\nIn his Hanover fourth of July speech, made when he was only eighteen years\r\nold, to quote from the authority we make so much use of, \"the boy Webster\r\npreached love of country, the grandeur of American nationality, fidelity\r\nto the constitution as the bulwark of nationality, and the necessity and\r\nthe nobility of the union of the States.\"[75] Mr. Lodge impressively adds,\r\n\"and that was the message which the man Webster delivered to his fellow\r\nmen.\"[76] His Fryeburg fourth of July speech, made not long afterwards,\r\nwas in the same strain. After the powers had thus started him in the way\r\nthey wanted him to go, we have noted above how he was carried by the\r\nfederalists of New England into a movement hostile to the union. This\r\nbrief wandering from his destiny, as it were, is to be compared with his\r\nneglect to grasp the point in the Dartmouth college case which was in the\r\nexact line of that high destiny. This shows how even the greatest genius\r\nmust stumble and grope before it has found the right road. I think the\r\nVenus and Adonis, Lucrece, First Part of Henry VI, and the Sonnets of\r\nShakspeare are like examples.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth oration, delivered in 1820, begins a new and very important\r\nstage of Webster's career. As Virginia was the mother of the southern\r\nStates, so New England was in large measure the mother of the northern.\r\nThe latter was the very fountain of the free-labor nationalization. And as\r\nshe was known to be exceptionally advanced in intellectual as well as\r\nmaterial development, she was to all the free States both their great\r\nexample and highest authority. Hardly anybody has even yet fully taken in\r\nall the permanent good which New England has done for herself at home and\r\nfor her children and scholars outside. Of course still less of it was\r\nunderstood in 1820. But in the Plymouth oration Webster set forth so much\r\nof it, the effect upon New England was magical. It was as if he had raised\r\na curtain concealing great riches and treasures of her merit and glory,\r\nthe existence of which had not been suspected. New Englanders all fell in\r\nlove with him, and accorded him the foremost place among their\r\ncounsellors.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery spirit of the speech deserves special notice. I do not\r\nmean to emphasize the oft-quoted passage denouncing the African\r\nslave-trade; for everybody in the south--even the smuggler and the few\r\npurchasers who encouraged him--had been against legalizing it, for reasons\r\nmentioned above, from a time long before the southern States showed a\r\ndesire in the constitutional convention to stop the trade at once. I mean\r\nhis mention of slavery in the West Indies. I do not think that he had the\r\nsouth in mind, stressing as he does the absenteeism of the masters and the\r\nmortgages of their lands for capital borrowed in England. But much else\r\nthat he says of the evil effects of slavery could be easily applied, at\r\nleast in some measure, to the system as it then existed in the south, such\r\nas, for instance, the backwardness to make permanent improvements or endow\r\ncolleges. His contrast of New England with the West Indies is intended to\r\nshow that a free-labor community is far superior to a slave-labor\r\ncommunity in the most important elements of a good and progressive\r\ncivilization. His conviction of this truth is serious and undoubting. And\r\nthose few words, \"the unmitigated toil of slavery,\" which show that he\r\nerroneously believed that the slave toiled as hard as the wage-earning\r\nlaborer, evince a strong moral revulsion on his part.\r\n\r\nWe summarize as to the Plymouth oration. It made Webster really the\r\npolitical leader of New England, which--the animosity excited by the\r\nembargo and the late war having become a forgotten thing of the past--is\r\nnow both in command of and also in the van of the free-labor and\r\nanti-slavery nationalization, destined by the powers to perpetuate the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nWe have told you how Webster--being at the time the very antipodes of what\r\nhe was afterwards when he talked with Bosworth as to the Rhode Island\r\ncase--missed the true and cardinal point in the Dartmouth college case,\r\nand how the powers, after having Marshall to establish it, gave all the\r\nglory of the great accomplishment to Webster. We come now to Gibbons _v._\r\nOgden, argued in 1824, in which the latter made far more than ample amends\r\nfor his shortcoming, and taught even the great Marshall how to decide.\r\n\r\nNew York State had given Fulton and Livingston for a term exclusive steam\r\nnavigation of all its waters, and Webster was to maintain that the grant\r\nimpugned the federal constitution and was therefore invalid. The question\r\nwas _res integra_, without analogies which often help us forlorn advocates\r\nwho cannot find a precedent and are utterly without any literature\r\nsuggesting the _ratio decidendi_. I know I cannot explain to a layman how\r\nsuch cases as these bewilder and paralyze the typical Anglo-American\r\njudge, who has walked all his life by precedent and not by sight. Further,\r\nWebster's side antagonized prevailing sentiment and, it would be hardly\r\ntoo much to say, the public conscience; either one of which generally\r\nsways courts more powerfully than the law-brief, argument, and appeal of\r\ncomplete advocates. The only thing which Webster could oppose to these\r\nformidable odds was just a clause of a sentence of the constitution, this\r\nclause being only of twelve words when even the belonging context is read\r\ninto it,[77] and appearing to be, we cannot say surplusage, but neither\r\nwell-considered nor of any particular force. Out of this he constructed\r\nsuch a perfect and wise doctrine of the immunity of our interstate\r\ncommerce from local attack and restraint that every succeeding generation\r\nhas admired its wisdom more, and subsequent additions and extensions of\r\nimportance are all manifest conclusions from the promises which he made\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nReading and reflecting for writing my \"American Law Studies\" familiarized\r\nme with a few instances in which a man has left a lasting impress upon the\r\ndevelopment of the law (some of which instances will be mentioned in a\r\nmoment). Thus I was led to meditate Webster's work in this case; and it\r\nbecomes an increasing wonder to me. Read what his biographer tells of the\r\nunfavorable circumstances of the preparation for the argument and how he\r\novercame them by superhuman effort. Read also his own account as given by\r\nHarvey, how Wirt, his associate, older and of much more experience in that\r\ncourt, disparaged the ground upon which he said he should stand, and\r\nproposed another; and how Marshall drank in every word of Webster's\r\nargument, and afterwards virtually reproduced it in the opinion.\r\n\r\nBut the great thing is what he did for the law. The current distribution\r\nof the common law under its larger heads was made by Hale and Blackstone\r\nafter that of the contemporary civilians, which is founded upon that of\r\nthe Institutes of Justinian. This book is but a reproduction of that of\r\nGaius. So we may assert of this last mentioned author that it is his\r\nsystematization which still obtains both in the English and Roman law,\r\nthat is to say, the entire law of the enlightened world.[78] A few English\r\nchancellors perceptibly moulded equity; Mansfield almost created English\r\ncommercial law; in our country, Hamilton, in one argument overturned the\r\ndoctrine of tacking securities, and in another remade the essentials of\r\nlibel; our great text-author Bishop, with his treatise often worked over\r\nin new editions, is really the enacter of the American law of divorce; and\r\nMarshall's additions to our federal law will never be forgotten. By what\r\nhe did in Gibbons _v._ Ogden, Webster has won a proud place in the small\r\ncompany of great law-givers.\r\n\r\nAnd he is entitled to a liberal share of the glory which the Dartmouth\r\ncollege decision has won, for without him Marshall would have had no\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the prodigious effect of the rulings in these two cases, try\r\nto realize to yourself what would be the consequences to American trade\r\nand commerce if the States were not effectually kept from infringing\r\ncontracts or granting monopolies of transportation. Try to realize the\r\nloss, the inconvenience, the trouble, the vexation, all the evil that\r\nwould have unavoidably befallen us if these two companion decisions and\r\nthe subsequent ones following them as precedents or extending them as\r\nanalogies, had not made practically the whole of American inland business\r\na unit--to use Webster's word--under the protection everywhere of the same\r\nimpartial law. The longer you think it over the more confirmed will be\r\nyour opinion that from no other cause has the evolution away from the old\r\nindependence of States towards a permanent union and a single organism of\r\nperpetually federated communities been more furthered. The unification of\r\nproduction and distribution thus given resistless impulse has almost of\r\nitself alone worked the unification of all our States. So looking back\r\nfrom the standpoint of to-day we may be sure that the powers had Webster\r\nby his accomplishment in the cases now in mind, to build for perpetual\r\nunion far better than he knew.\r\n\r\nIt needs not to dwell upon the Bunker Hill oration, made June 17, 1825. It\r\nis, as I believe, the most familiar as a whole of all speeches to\r\nAmericans. It did not stop with adding greatly to the influence he had won\r\nover New England by the Plymouth oration; it revealed him to the whole\r\ncountry as its supreme orator. Bear in mind its theme, remembering how\r\nlarge a part the battle of Bunker Hill was in founding our union.\r\n\r\nThe plainest manifestation that providence ever made of its favoritism to\r\nWebster was its having Adams and Jefferson both to die on the same day of\r\nall the year the most commemorative of each. By the eulogy of the two\r\npatriots which Webster made the next month he attained the height of his\r\npopular celebrity. His subject was no longer one that principally\r\nconcerned New England and the north, but it was the co-operation of both\r\nsections in making the United States. Slowly, but surely, he has climbed\r\nto the top of authority, whence he ever draws audience and attention from\r\nnorth and south, both in the present and for ages after the brothers' war.\r\n\r\nThese three popular speeches just noticed are unique in oratory, not in\r\ntheir general character, but in the nobility of the subjects, the ripeness\r\nof the occasion, the profound wisdom of treatment, and the extraordinary\r\nelevation and perfection of style.\r\n\r\nAnother stage begins in 1830 with the reply to Hayne. What Webster says\r\ntherein, recommending brotherly love between the sections, and commending\r\nthe union, he reproduced with grateful variation in many memorable\r\npassages of later speeches. The original and reproductions are the most\r\nprecious gems of our literature, ranking in excellence even above Poe's\r\npoetry, America's best.\r\n\r\nThe speech of 1833 against Calhoun's nullification resolutions, that which\r\nwon for Webster the cognomen, The Expounder of the Constitution, belongs\r\nto the next succeeding stage, wherein he rose from supreme panegyric to\r\ninvincible defence of the union. As we have already given in a former\r\nchapter this performance its due praise, we need not say more of it.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete if we failed to glance at the\r\nessentials of Webster's greatness as an orator, and to point out the means\r\nused by the powers to give him his extraordinary excellence. He did not\r\nstale himself by discussing trivial matters. When he rose, people knew\r\nthat he had an important message, and they ought to attend. In harmony\r\nwith this was his uniform seriousness, gravity, and becoming dignity of\r\nmanner; and even in his merry-making humor, as instanced in describing\r\nHayne leading the South Carolina militia, he never stooped. He spoke to\r\nthe sound common sense and the regnant conscience of the masses. His\r\npropositions, his illustrations, his argument went home without effort to\r\nevery one who thought at all and who cared for moral virtue. The entire\r\ncountry has heard with great acceptance that Davy Crockett said to him,\r\n\"Mr. Webster, you are not the great orator people say you are; for I heard\r\nyour speech, and I understood every word of it.\" Whether this be an\r\ninvention or not, it well characterizes his easy intelligibility. Herbert\r\nSpencer could have exampled the main proposition of his able essay on\r\nstyle by Webster's best efforts, and every part and parcel of\r\nthem--statement of proposition, necessary explanation and narrative,\r\ndistinctions, illustrations, reasoning, invocation of feeling--appeal to\r\nthe sense of justice. I often feel that he is not more majestic in any\r\nparticular than the always manifest meaning of what he says. In this he\r\nreminds of Bacon.\r\n\r\nHe chose only the most important subjects; he befittingly addressed always\r\nthe higher nature of his hearers; and he always spoke with a transparent\r\nclearness. But all this does not indicate more than the mere beginning of\r\ntrue eloquence. The greatest teachers--those who win and keep the\r\nadmiration of the world--have, as their worshippers teach us, gifts of\r\nexpression commensurate with the desert of their communications. Remember\r\nHomer, Plato, Demosthenes, Vergil, Cicero, Dante, Bacon, Goethe, and above\r\nall Shakspeare. As the reader hangs over them he becomes more and more\r\nunconscious of what we call, rather vaguely, their style. Their diction,\r\nin unhackneyed use of hackneyed words, in metaphors that flash like\r\nelectric sparks, in appropriateness of varied rhythm, and all appertaining\r\njewels, becomes to him but a belonging of the much more precious sense. As\r\nit must impart that without impediment it is unconsciously made as like it\r\nas the protecting coloring of animals is made like that of the objects\r\namidst which they lurk. There has been but one other which admits of\r\ncomparison in world-wide secular importance with Webster's theme--that\r\nwhich inspired\r\n\r\n  \"Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.\"\r\n\r\nWe have learned how the AEneid was prized above all other poetry, not only\r\nby the Romans themselves, but, long after they had become a mere name and\r\nmemory, by the different nations of Europe. Plainly it was because Vergil,\r\nin that \"stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man,\" had fitly\r\ncelebrated the greatest factor delivering from barbarism, and spreading\r\ncivilization abroad, that had yet appeared in history,--the Roman empire.\r\nThe American union, immeasurably exceeding that empire in immediate good\r\nto millions at home, and in fair promise to all the earth, was Webster's\r\nsubject. It got from him an appropriate style. The variety of ornament in\r\nhis language reaches all the way from the modest violets of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon common to Bunyan and King James's version, up to the most\r\ngorgeous trappings which are part and parcel of the sense in the best\r\npassages of Paradise Lost. There is also a variety of idiom. He uses that\r\nof the field or street, or of the gentleman or of the scholar, as best\r\nsuits. He affected short sentences, and also pure English words. He told\r\nDavis to weed the Latin words out of his speech on Adams and Jefferson.\r\nBut when occasion calls he can revel in that latinity of our tongue which,\r\nas De Quincey has noted, becomes intense with Shakspeare, when he is\r\nsoaring his strongest. If you are inclined to dispute this, look over the\r\nlast two sentences of the reply to Hayne. How you would lower this sublime\r\nperoration into the dust, if you replaced the Latin with native\r\nderivatives, or changed the long for short sentences in what is now above\r\nall example in English or American oratory, and can be paralleled in\r\nstructure, \"ocean-roll of rhythm,\" and exquisite words only by the most\r\nfamous paragraphs of Cicero and Livy. As our last word here, Webster\r\nalways imparts the wisest counsel as to the American union in phrase\r\nall-golden, and his eloquence is entitled to praise beyond all other,\r\nbecause it is always what his high subject demands.\r\n\r\nAs I have to do mainly with the permanent and lasting in Webster, I can\r\nmerely allude to his physical endowments, described with such rapture by\r\nMarch, Choate, and many others of his time, and well summarized by Mr.\r\nLodge. I must remind the reader how it accorded with the purpose of the\r\npowers to bestow upon their favorite majesty of form, mien, and look, a\r\nvoice that suggested the music of the spheres, action that would have been\r\na model to Demosthenes; in short, a physique for the orator superior to\r\nany on record. These things helped him mightily in his day.\r\n\r\nApparently I finished with Webster's education some pages back of this.\r\nBut the more important part of it has not as yet been touched upon; and it\r\nis incumbent upon me to tell it, because of the lesson we ought to learn\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most characterizing part of our education--perhaps it\r\nwould more accurately express my meaning to say our culture--each one of\r\nus gets from his associations, from his contact with the people of all\r\nsorts around him in his infancy, boyhood, and manhood often as far on as\r\nmiddle age, if not sometimes farther. We get it by imitation, unconscious\r\nand conscious, and by absorption from what we see, hear, and read, etc.,\r\nwhich absorption is often most active when we are least aware of it. Now\r\nlet us consider the community of which Webster was the product.\r\n\r\nIn the Plymouth oration, as we have already suggested, he exhibits the\r\nexceptional progress and acquisitions of New England. What other community\r\never showed greater courage against danger or greater energy against\r\nobstacles, and such wise building-up of a new country in a strange land?\r\nThe Pilgrim Fathers could not have liberty and their own religion at home,\r\nand for these they went into the wilderness. There they kept the savage at\r\nbay. With soil and climate both unfavorable they wrought out general\r\nplenty and comfort. They prospered in industry. They equalized as far as\r\nthey could all in property rights. And these liberty-lovers gave the\r\nregulation of local affairs to the town meeting, of which Webster says:\r\n\"Nothing can exceed the utility of these little bodies. They are so many\r\ncouncils or parliaments, in which common interests are discussed, and\r\nuseful knowledge acquired and communicated.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson, the great apostle of popular self-government, most earnestly\r\nlonged to see all America outside of New England divided into such\r\ntownships as hers.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Pilgrims. They established schools and churches\r\neverywhere. Free education was maintained by taxation of all property.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up. Here was a country in which everybody had been well trained\r\nin the available ways of self-support and also of saving and\r\naccumulating,--the very first essential to make good citizens. Such\r\ncitizens were required to administer their public affairs themselves; and\r\nthus they received the very best political education and training in a\r\nschool of genuine democracy,--which is the next essential. The children of\r\neach generation were schooled better than those of the former, the\r\ncolleges and universities constantly did better with the students, and\r\nlibraries open to the public both multiplied and enlarged,--the third\r\nessential. And education and business were rationally mixed, until in\r\nWebster's time it might be said with truth that the average New Englander\r\nworked with a will, and wisely, every day to maintain himself and family,\r\nand also found leisure to add something of value to his store of\r\nknowledge. Here is another essential. The moral and religious atmosphere\r\nbecame purer and purer, and more and more on all sides good intention was\r\nconspicuous in the light, and evil intention hid itself deep in the dark.\r\nThis is the last essential.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is made up from the Plymouth oration. Webster was too near\r\nto discern all the intellectual and moral advancement and the opulent\r\nfuture promise of his own community, the proper fruit of the conditions\r\njust summarized.[79] Let us indicate by only such a paucity of examples as\r\nwe have room for. Able and fully furnished lawyers everywhere. Think of\r\nStory, a most diligently attending judge and one of the best; also\r\nfinding time both to be the first law professor and most fertile and\r\neminent author of the age, exhausting English and American sources and\r\nauthority in his books, and crowding them with a civil law learning to be\r\nsurpassed only by that of the Roman jurists of Germany; let Ticknor, whom\r\nwe may call the founder of the post classical school of literature in our\r\ncountry, suggest the students of modern languages who followed in an\r\nillustrious line,--let him suggest also the famous historians, such as\r\nPrescott, Bancroft, Hildreth, Motley, Parkman, really representatives of\r\nthe school just mentioned, using methods that got into the American air\r\nfirst from Ticknor; let Channing suggest the pulpit,--Channing, who raised\r\nreligion from the gloom of dogma and orthodoxy into a life of angelic joy;\r\nwhat can one say to describe Emerson in a breath,--the teacher to us all\r\nof fit aspiration, right thinking, noble expression, the highest virtue\r\nand truest religion, and who lived, as Dr. Heber Newton has lately told,\r\nthe most perfect of lives as a man; Hawthorne, showing the world sick with\r\nits yearning for moral redemption that even a disgraced, lone, and\r\nfriendless woman can by a subsequent life of unreserved confession,\r\npurity, and love to her neighbors turn a horrible brand of guilt into a\r\njewel more precious and brilliant than diamond,--how his consummate\r\nachievement rebukes the sixty years' dilatoriness of Goethe over his\r\nunfinished Faust; and divine poets, Whittier, Longfellow, Lowell, and\r\nHolmes,--the last two conspicuous in letters, Lowell being in my judgment\r\nthe greatest American man of letters; I have said nothing of the statesmen\r\nand orators, beginning with Fisher Ames and John Adams,--and there are\r\nothers in every high round of the intellectual life known all over the\r\nland whose names I must omit.\r\n\r\nIn this enumeration I have intentionally looked somewhat forward; for what\r\nis in one particular generation you cannot find out until its effects are\r\nplain in the next. I want to accentuate it that Webster belonged to a\r\nsociety which had made some of the extraordinary figures whose names are\r\ngiven, and was making the rest of them. When the view just suggested has\r\nbeen taken, and if in comparing New England with any other community--even\r\nwith Athens, Florence, England, or Germany, in their best eras--periods of\r\ntime be equalized and differences of population be properly allowed for,\r\nit will appear that the conditions moulding Webster were more energetic in\r\nproductivity than can be found elsewhere. And if, in this comparison, the\r\nrelative general condition of the masses in each community be duly taken\r\ninto the account, the result will be far more favorable to New England;\r\nfor a high level of the masses is a much better proof of a fecund culture\r\nthan merely many striking individual instances.\r\n\r\nThus we bring out the point that Webster was born, grew up, and lived in a\r\nnursery prolific in men and women of extraordinary powers and virtues. How\r\ninsignificant is the muster-roll of any other part of our country! I\r\ncompare that of the south because I am familiar with it, and one can with\r\nbetter manners disparage his own section than another. The ante-bellum\r\nsouthern treasures of art and literature except speeches, political and\r\nforensic, can be counted on the fingers of one hand without taking them\r\nall. The poetry of Poe, a few essays of Legare, especially that on\r\nDemosthenes, Calhoun's Dissertation on Government, and Toombs's Tremont\r\nTemple lecture, are all that are pre-eminent; and some of the historians\r\nof our literature insist that Poe was southern only in his prejudices, and\r\nnot in his making. To turn away from authors, how few can be found to\r\ncompare in education, polish, and literary or scientific accomplishments\r\nwith average New Englanders of their several professions or occupations.\r\nToombs, in the diamond-like brilliance of his extempore effusion in talks\r\nor speeches, is as solitary in the south as Catullus, the greatest of the\r\nspontaneous poets of his nation, was in the Rome of his day.\r\n\r\nWebster absorbed and absorbed, assimilated and assimilated, all the better\r\nelements of this marvellous New England culture, which I am painfully\r\nconscious of having most insufficiently described above, until at last he\r\nmounted its eminences in his profession, in the politics of democracy,\r\naesthetic taste, and especially statesmanly eloquence. So assured was his\r\nstand upon these eminences that all the wisest and most refined of the\r\nsection spontaneously and involuntarily did him obeisance, recognizing in\r\nhim their ideal of wisdom and counsel befittingly expressed. We can stop\r\nto give only two examples. Edward Everett is the one American master of\r\ngrand rhetoric. He heard the reply to Hayne, and, as he says, he could not\r\nbut be reminded throughout of Demosthenes' making the unrivalled crown\r\noration. Choate, profoundly versed in the law, the incomparable forensic\r\nadvocate and popular speaker, daily flying higher with inspiration drawn\r\nfrom Demosthenes and Cicero--he poured out his admiration in many\r\nutterances that have already become classic. Webster was made in and by\r\nNew England, and not for herself alone. The toast, \"Daniel Webster,--the\r\ngift of New England to his country, his whole country, and nothing but his\r\ncountry,\" to which he responded December 22, 1843, tells but the truth. No\r\nAmerican other than a New Englander ever had what one may term such a\r\ngreatness breeding environment as he. And passing in review all the famous\r\nchildren of those famous six States, whether they spent their lives at\r\nhome as Choate, or developed elsewhere as Henry Ward Beecher, it is my\r\ndecided opinion that Daniel Webster as fruit and example of her culture is\r\nNew England's greatest glory.\r\n\r\nThere remain now but a few prominences of Webster for me to touch upon.\r\n\r\nHis speech of March 7, 1850, was fiercely denounced by the root-and-branch\r\nabolitionists. Horace Mann called him a fallen Lucifer. Sumner charged him\r\nwith apostasy. Giddings said he had struck \"a blow against freedom and the\r\nconstitutional rights of the free States which no southern arm could have\r\ngiven.\" Theodore Parker could think of no comparable deed of any other New\r\nEnglander except the treachery of Benedict Arnold. Wittier condemned him\r\nto everlasting obloquy in a lofty lyric, which from its very title of one\r\nword throughout was reprobation more stinging than the world-known lampoon\r\nof Catullus against Julius Caesar. The effect of this tempest has not yet\r\nall died out; and in many quarters of the north Webster is still regarded\r\nas a renegade. His defenders, however, multiply and become more earnest\r\nand strong. Let us consider this speech with the serenity and riper\r\njudgment which should mark the historical writer of to-day.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost let us grasp the wide difference of the situation from\r\nthat at the beginning of 1833. Then, the question was only remotely a\r\npro-slavery or southern one. A southern president, the most popular\r\nAmerican, of great firmness of purpose and extraordinary courage, had\r\ntaken a decided stand against the movement of one southern State hostile\r\nto the general government,--a stand the more decided because he cordially\r\nhated Calhoun, who was leading the movement. The southern leaders outside\r\nof that State did not approve of nullification; most of them believing it\r\nwas an absurdity for a State to contend she could stay in the union and\r\nat the same time rightfully refuse to perform a condition of that union.\r\nIt seemed that no southern State except Virginia would stand by South\r\nCarolina in the event of a collision between her and the United States. We\r\ncan well understand that Webster could then see no danger to the cause he\r\nloved above all others, that is, the union, in uncompromisingly demanding\r\nthat the revenue be collected, and with force if necessary.\r\n\r\nNullification was palpably unjustifiable, even under the doctrine\r\nprevalent in the south. We have explained how Calhoun's extreme desire for\r\npeaceable remedies only, led him to champion this illogical measure. The\r\ntheory of State sovereignty demanded that, instead of the nullification\r\nordinance, South Carolina pass an ordinance of secession, conditioned to\r\ncommence its operation at a stated time if the objectionable duties had\r\nnot been repealed. The situation in 1833 was that all the north and nearly\r\nall of the south were arrayed under a southern leader against only one\r\nsouthern State, making a demand which was plainly untenable in either one\r\nof the two differing schools of constitutional construction.\r\n\r\nBut the situation, in 1850, was a south solidly united, not upon such an\r\nobvious heresy as nullification, but aroused as one man to protect the\r\nvery underpinning of its social structure. It was standing confidently\r\nupon the doctrine of State sovereignty, which, as the historical records\r\nall showed, was the creed of the generation, both north and south, that\r\nmade the constitution. As we have already told, Calhoun in 1833 probably\r\nconvinced Webster that the States were sovereign. That did not mean that\r\nthe force-bill was wrong; it meant only that if South Carolina chose, she\r\ncould rightfully secede. And we may say that this great argument of\r\nCalhoun, demolishing as it does the premises of Webster, was really\r\nirrelevant, for it did not support his own proposition. Now in 1850, as\r\nWebster saw it, the south was justified by the constitution, however\r\nfoolish might be her policy, and he was too conscientious to oppose what\r\nhe believed right and just. In addition to this claim by the south of\r\nState sovereignty as abstractly right, his conscience told him that some\r\nof her practical demands were just. It had been provided not only that all\r\nof Texas south of 36 deg. 30' be admitted with slavery, but further that four\r\nother States be made out of the same territory. Although Webster was a\r\nfree-soiler from first to last, his conscience told him peremptorily that\r\nthe only honest course of congress as to the provision mentioned, which\r\nwas really a solemn contract with Texas, was to perform the contract in\r\ngood faith. This advice, of course, aroused the ire of the abolitionists,\r\nwho had united upon the position that no other slave State should ever be\r\nadmitted into the union. And he boldly said that the south was right in\r\nher complaint that there was disinclination both among individuals and\r\npublic authorities at the north to execute the fugitive slave law.\r\nMeditate these serious words:\r\n\r\n    \"I desire to call the attention of all sober-minded men at the north,\r\n    of all conscientious men, of all men who are not carried away by some\r\n    fanatical idea or some false impression, to their constitutional\r\n    obligations. I put it to all the sober and sound minds at the north as\r\n    a question of morals and a question of conscience, What right have\r\n    they, in their legislative capacity or any other capacity, to endeavor\r\n    to get round this constitution, or to embarrass the free exercise of\r\n    the rights secured by the constitution to the persons whose slaves\r\n    escape from them? None at all; none at all. Neither in the forum of\r\n    conscience, nor before the face of the constitution, are they, in my\r\n    opinion, justified in such an attempt.\"\r\n\r\nI must believe that as time rolls on the outcry against this position of\r\nWebster's, so unshakably founded in conscience and reason as the position\r\nis, must not only cease, but turn to words of praise and commendation. The\r\nnorthern fanatics who tried to abolish slavery by repudiating such solemn\r\ncontracts as the resolution of March 1, 1845, respecting the admission of\r\nTexas, and the fugitive slave restoration clause of the federal\r\nconstitution, _while purposing to stay in the union_, were just as morally\r\nwrong as were the southern fanatics who proposed to stay in the union and\r\nenjoy its benefits and not pay the taxes necessary for its maintenance.\r\n\r\nOne other passage of this speech has been strongly attacked. Webster\r\nopposed applying the Wilmot proviso to California and New Mexico, where,\r\nas he said, \"the law of nature, of physical geography, the law of the\r\nformation of the earth ... settles forever with a strength beyond all\r\nterms of human enactment, that slavery cannot exist.\" To apply the proviso\r\nwould be, as he added, to \"take pains uselessly to reaffirm an ordinance\r\nof nature,\" and \"to re-enact the will of God;\" and its insertion in a\r\nTerritorial government bill would be \"for the mere purpose of a taunt or\r\nreproach.\" Mr. Lodge, reprehending most severely, confidently asserts that\r\nthough these Territories were not suited to slave agriculture, yet that\r\ntheir many and rich mines could have been profitably worked by slaves.[80]\r\nHe stresses the fact that certain slave owners declared that they would,\r\nif they could, so work these mines. This distinguished author is to be\r\nreminded of how cheaply Seius could replace any one of his slaves that he\r\nworked to death in Ilva's mines. Let him re-read the Captivi of\r\nPlautus,--not to mention many other ancient records just as\r\ninstructive,--and realize that in that time it was not only one race that\r\nfurnished slaves, but that every free human being was in lifelong danger\r\nof falling to a master. The prisoners taken in the incessant wars kept the\r\nslave markets glutted. A few months' work of one of his slaves would bring\r\nthe master enough to pay the purchase money and leave a considerable sum\r\nto his credit with the banker. The Spaniards worked their mines with\r\nIndians to be had for the catching in near-by places. And Mr. Lodge\r\nmentions mining with the labor of criminals and serfs. In all the\r\ninstances that he has in mind the worker can be had for his keep or a\r\nlittle more than that. But to have mined with the slaves of the\r\nsouth,--that was widely different. There was no way to get such a slave\r\nexcept to rear or hire or buy him in a protected market. Does Mr. Lodge\r\nreally believe that Seius would have permitted his eight hundred slaves to\r\nsicken in the mines of Ilva if each one had been worth at least $1,000 in\r\nthe market? Really the leading industry of the south was slave rearing.\r\nThe profit was in keeping the slaves healthy and rapidly multiplying. This\r\ncould be done at little expense in agriculture, where even the light\r\nworkers were made to support themselves. But had a planter gone into a\r\nmining section, where he could get no land, for corn to feed his slaves\r\nand stock, and for cotton to bring him money, he would have found no\r\nmargin of profit whatever in mining. I was reared in the gold-bearing\r\ndistrict of Georgia. I can remember old Mr. John Wynne, a wealthy cotton\r\nplanter living in Oglethorpe county, some six or seven miles from my\r\nfather's, who, when--to use plantation parlance--he had laid by his crop\r\nat the middle or end of July, would work his gold mine until\r\ncotton-picking became brisk about the middle of September. He made money\r\nout of his gold mine, without injuring his other far more valuable mine,\r\nthat is, the natural increase of his negroes. And I heard of other such\r\nmine workers. But you could not have tempted one of these shrewd business\r\nmen to settle with his slaves outside of a cotton-making district in order\r\nto mine. Had either Mr. Clingman or Mr. Mason--mentioned by Mr.\r\nLodge--made the trial, he would have soon returned to his old neighborhood\r\na sadder and wiser man.\r\n\r\nThe negro's work as a slave in the coal and iron mines of the south never\r\ncommenced until after the thirteenth amendment freed him. Since then he\r\nhas done much cruelly hard work as _servus poenae_--a slave of\r\npunishment--in these mines, for convict lessees, having no other interest\r\nin him than to get all the labor possible during his term.\r\n\r\nSo it is clear that Webster, in contending that the conditions in these\r\nTerritories were prohibitive of slavery was as statesmanly and\r\nperspicacious as he was generally in other matters.\r\n\r\nHis detractors charged that the entire speech was a bid for the support of\r\nthe south in his eager struggle for the presidency. That he passionately\r\nlonged for the chair was manifest. But his was not the sordid ambition of\r\nthe professional place-hunter. He had a heaven-reaching aspiration to show\r\nAmerica what a president should be in those angry times. He must have been\r\nconscious that he was the only man of gifts to do the great deed. What an\r\nappropriate climax that would have been for the invincible defender of the\r\nunion, who, when replying to Hayne twenty years before, had outsoared\r\nPindar in eulogizing South Carolina leading the south, and Massachusetts\r\nleading the north, in the same breath; and who, neither from prepossession\r\nin favor of his native community or resentment because of attack upon it\r\nby those of the other section, had ever been removed out of brotherly\r\nlove for all his countrymen alike. If you can do an all-important thing\r\nfor your fellows which you believe no one else can do, and are without\r\nambition for opportunity, are you not a poor grovelling creature? Webster,\r\nknowing that secession could not be peaceable, and seeing it become more\r\nand more probable, racked with fears for the union, and aghast at the\r\nmenace of fraternal bloodshed, like Calhoun, he cheated himself with a\r\nfutile remedy. We have told you of Calhoun's proposal to disarm the\r\ncombatants. In his amiability Webster believed with his whole soul that he\r\ncould as president make his countrymen love one another as he himself\r\nloved them, and that he could pour upon the waters now beginning to rage\r\noil enough to safe the ship of union through the tempest soon to be at its\r\nheight. It was an aspiration high and holy, deserving of eternal honor\r\nfrom all America. You cannot read this great speech of March 7 aright if\r\nyou do not discern that Webster was seriously alarmed. When you see that a\r\ndear one's malady is fatal, you will not confess it to others,--not even\r\nto yourself. His excited exclamations, \"No, sir! no, sir! There will be no\r\nsecession! Gentlemen are not serious when they talk of secession,\" cannot\r\ndeceive a reader whose wont it has been to look into his own heart.\r\nWebster did not see the future with the superhuman prevision of Calhoun;\r\nbut he had observed the course of things in that stormy session. Is it to\r\nbe believed that he had overlooked the tremendous significance of Toombs's\r\nspeech of December 13, and of the wild plaudits it brought from the\r\nsouthern members? And try to conceive what must have been the effect upon\r\nhim of that most solemn and the saddest great speech in all oratory of\r\nCalhoun just three days before. Read the 7th of March speech by its\r\ncircumstances and it is revealed to you, as by a flashlight, that Webster\r\nhad peeped behind the curtain which he had prayed should never rise in his\r\nlifetime. Horror-struck as he was, he would not despair of his\r\ncountry,--he would not believe that the brothers' union was about to turn\r\ninto a brothers' war. Oh, let nobody dishonor his better self by seeing in\r\nthis glorious speech, which our best and most lovable have placed in their\r\nhearts beside Washington's farewell address, the bid of a turncoat. Rather\r\nlet us learn to understand its supreme statesmanly reach; its impartiality\r\ntowards and just rebuke of the orator's own section and its merited\r\ncastigation of the other courageously given, while affection for both is\r\nkept uppermost; its grand dignity, moral height, and pre-eminent\r\npatriotism. Let us also learn properly to estimate the disfavor with which\r\nhe regarded ever afterwards during the rest of his life the active\r\nanti-slavery men of the north, whom he could not understand to be other\r\nthan bringers of the unspeakable calamity he would avert. And let us give\r\nhim his due commiseration for missing the nomination, and realizing that\r\nthe hopes of saving his country which he had cherished so fondly were all,\r\nall shattered. When we do our full duty to him we will, northerners and\r\nsoutherners alike, agree that Whittier's palinode ought to have gone full\r\ncircle before it paused.\r\n\r\nWhat is Webster's highest and best fame? In answer we think at once of the\r\nreply to Hayne, its loftiness throughout, its eagle ascensions here and\r\nthere, and most of all the organ melodies at the grand close, beside which\r\nthe famous apostrophe of Longfellow is harsh overstrain. The next moment\r\nwe feel he is higher in his profound love for his whole country than in\r\nhis unequalled eloquence. He and Lincoln were the supereminent Americans\r\nwho could never, never forget that the people of the other section were\r\ntheir own full-blood brothers and sisters. They are the supreme exponents\r\nof that American brotherhood, more deeply founded and more lasting than\r\neither one of the nationalizations which we have explained, out of which a\r\ncontinental is first, and then a world-union to come. To save our union\r\nwas also to do the better deed of saving that brotherhood. For this each\r\nstrove in his own way. I believe that the people of the world-union will\r\npair them in Walhalla, and set them above all other heroes, crowning\r\nWebster as the monarch of speech which prepared millions with faith and\r\nfortitude for the crisis, and crowning Lincoln the monarch of counsels and\r\nacts in the crisis. It will be understood that neither was called away\r\nbefore his mission was finished. The greatest work of each was example of\r\nthe love with which we should all love one another; and that was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\"UNCLE TOM'S CABIN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe misrepresentations in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" of the character of the\r\nnegro and his usual treatment in southern slavery have been taken as true\r\nby the best-informed and most unprejudiced everywhere outside of the\r\nsouth. The quotations which I make above from Prof. Barrett Wendell's\r\n_bahnbrechend_ work on American literature[81] show a rare and exemplary\r\nfreedom from sectional bias. But he is a most convincing witness to the\r\nstatement with which I begin this chapter, as I shall now show by two\r\nother excerpts from the same book, making it appear that even Professor\r\nWendell has accepted without question the misrepresentations mentioned. In\r\nthese excerpts I italicize the important statements, and I follow each\r\nwith a contradictory one of my own. I invite close attention to what\r\nProfessor Wendell says on one side and I on the other, for they make up\r\nissues of fact that must be rightly settled before the historical merit of\r\nthe work which is the subject of this chapter can be accurately judged.\r\n\r\nThis is the first excerpt:\r\n\r\n    \"Written carelessly, and full of crudities, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' even\r\n    after forty-eight years, remains a remarkable piece of fiction. The\r\n    truth is that almost unawares Mrs. Stowe had in her the stuff of which\r\n    good novelists are made. Her plot, to be sure, is conventional and\r\n    rambling; but her characters, even though little studied in detail,\r\n    have a pervasive vitality which no study can achieve; _you\r\n    unhesitatingly accept them as real. Her descriptive power, meanwhile,\r\n    was such as to make equally convincing the backgrounds in which her\r\n    action and her characters move. What is more, these backgrounds, most\r\n    of which she knew from personal experience, are probably so faithful\r\n    to actual nature that the local sentiment aroused as you read them may\r\n    generally be accepted as true._\"[82]\r\n\r\nI say as to the characters in the novel that the negroes are monstrous\r\ndistortions, being drawn in the main with the leading peculiarities of\r\nwhites and without those of negroes; and that as to her most\r\nrepresentative southern whites Mrs. Stowe is utterly untrue to fact by\r\nmaking them all anti-slavery. I say as to the \"backgrounds,\" that she knew\r\nas little of them as she did of the negroes. I expect to demonstrate that\r\nthe \"personal experience\" claimed for her by Professor Wendell was scanty\r\nand inadequate in the extreme.\r\n\r\nI now give the second and last excerpt: \"She [Mrs. Stowe] differed from\r\nmost abolitionists _in having observed on the spot all the tragic evils of\r\nslavery_.\"[83]\r\n\r\nI do not dispute that her opportunity of learning southern slavery, small\r\nas it was, was very far superior to that of the other prominent\r\nabolitionists except Seward, who had taught school in the black belt of\r\nGeorgia.[84] I maintain that she knew but little of southern slavery, and\r\nthey less; that what both they and she conscientiously and most\r\nconfidently believed to be their knowledge of this slavery, the slave, and\r\nof the slaveholder, was but a prodigious mass of delusion and prejudice.\r\n\r\nI shall show, I think, that, instead of observing, she merely fancied and\r\nimagined, and that, to say the least, it is very misleading to allege\r\nthat this fancying and imagining of hers was done \"on the spot.\"\r\n\r\nBy the words, \"all the tragic evils of slavery,\" Professor Wendell\r\nevidently means that the evils of southern slavery to the slave were both\r\nvery many and very great. I shall show, I believe, that the condition of\r\nthe average negro in southern slavery was far better than it was in Africa\r\nwhence he came, and far better than it is now since he has been freed.\r\nThere are occasionally incident to every human condition--even to the\r\nrelation of parent and child--some tragic evils of its own. In the native\r\nhome of the negro in West Africa all the women and nearly all the men are\r\nslaves of brutally cruel savages, without any protection of law whatever.\r\nThe social organism is in the very lowest stage; and there is complete\r\ninability to evolve into a better one as the stationariness of ages\r\nproves. In the new south, certain causes which I have described at length\r\nin the last two chapters of this book have, ever since emancipation, been\r\nsteadily and with acceleration depressing the average negro; and the rise\r\nof the few who have managed to acquire some property, or to get a good\r\nindustrial education, only brings out more conspicuously the misery and\r\nwretchedness of the mass. It is correct to say that there was a vast\r\nmultitude of tragic evils to the negroes in West Africa; and it is also\r\ncorrect to say that there is now the same to them in the south; but it is\r\nnot correct to say that the tragic evils of southern slavery to the slave\r\nwere frequent or general. The truth as to southern slavery ought to be\r\nknown everywhere, which is, that it raised the negro very greatly in\r\ncondition, and, now that he has been taken out of it, his progress has\r\nbeen arrested, and he is relapsing.\r\n\r\nThe great proposition of Mrs. Stowe and of the root-and-branch\r\nabolitionists was that slavery in the south was such a flagrant and\r\natrocious wrong to the negro, that every human being was commanded by\r\nconscience to do everything possible to help him if he should try to\r\nescape from his master. Combating this proposition, without any concession\r\nwhatever, I think it well that we try at the outset to ascertain how\r\nsouthern slavery affected the negro, whether cruelly or beneficially. To\r\ndo this, his condition in his native land, his condition while a slave in\r\nAmerica, and, lastly, his condition after his emancipation, must be\r\ncompared. I beg my reader to follow me attentively as I now review and\r\ncontrast these three conditions. First, as to his condition in Africa.\r\nHere is what Toombs said of him to a Boston audience, January 24, 1856:\r\n\r\n    \"The monuments of the ancient Egyptians carry him back to the morning\r\n    of time--older than the pyramids; they furnish the evidence both of\r\n    his national identity and his social degradation before history began.\r\n    We first behold him a slave in foreign lands; we then find the great\r\n    body of his race slaves in their native land; and after thirty\r\n    centuries, illuminated by both ancient and modern civilization, have\r\n    passed over him, we still find him a slave of savage masters, as\r\n    incapable as himself of even attempting a single step in\r\n    civilization--we find him there still, without government or laws of\r\n    protection, without letters or arts of industry, without religion, or\r\n    even the aspirations which would raise him to the rank of an idolater;\r\n    and in his lowest type, his almost only mark of humanity is, that he\r\n    walks erect in the image of the Creator. Annihilate his race to-day,\r\n    and you will find no trace of his existence within half a score of\r\n    years; and he would not leave behind him a single discovery,\r\n    invention, or thought worthy of remembrance by the human family.\"[85]\r\n\r\nIf my reader deems Toombs's picture overdrawn let him consult those parts\r\nof the recent work of a most diligent and conscientious investigator\r\ndescribing the negroes of West Africa, and note what is there told of\r\nheathen practices still surviving,--slavery of women to their polygamic\r\nhusbands, pitiless destruction of useless members of the family, robbery,\r\nmurder, cannibalism, the utter want of chastity.[86] We quote this as to\r\nslavery, which is especially important here:\r\n\r\n    \"Slavery, having existed from time immemorial, is bound up with the\r\n    whole social and economic organization of West African society. There\r\n    are, broadly speaking, three kinds of slaves: those captured in war,\r\n    those purchased from outside the tribe,--usually from the\r\n    interior,--and the native-born slaves. _All alike_ are mere chattels,\r\n    and _by law are absolutely subject to the master's will without\r\n    redress_. But in practice a difference is made, for obvious reasons,\r\n    between native-born slaves and captives taken from hostile tribes.\r\n    _The latter are numerous, and the severest forms of labor fall to\r\n    their lot. They are treated with constant neglect, and cruelly\r\n    punished on the slightest provocation. Their lives are at no time\r\n    secure; they serve as victims for the sacrifice; when sick they are\r\n    driven into the jungle; in times of scarcity they starve._\"[87]\r\n\r\nThe master has the power of life and death over all slaves.[88]\r\n\r\nThe same author adds: \"_The pawning of persons for debt is exceedingly\r\ncommon. If the debt is never paid in full, the pawn_ and his descendants\r\nbecome slaves in perpetuity.\"[89]\r\n\r\nSurely the reader who has attended to these details which I have given\r\nfrom Mr. Tillinghast will admit that the southern master transferred the\r\nAfrican into a condition far better than any he could find at home. In the\r\nsouth two agencies gave him beneficent favor to which he and his fathers\r\nhad always been strangers. The law of the land protected his life and\r\nshielded him from cruelty; and his high market value made it the interest\r\nof his American master not to overwork or under- feed and clothe him. And\r\nhe was introduced into the first stage of monogamic life, which he\r\ndeveloped steadily and rapidly until he was freed. In this he was\r\ntravelling the only true road up from barbarism. If he could have but\r\nstayed in it until, after some generations--perhaps centuries--chaste\r\nwives and mothers had been evolved, he would have stood firmly on the\r\nthreshold of permanent civilization and improvement.\r\n\r\nWhatever evil of southern slavery to the negro my readers, prompted by the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists, may suggest, they will find on reflection\r\nthat it would have been far greater to him and more frequent had he\r\nremained in Africa. Separation of members of the family has been\r\nrepeatedly emphasized as a most horrible evil of slavery in the south.\r\nSuch separation was incalculably more cruel and frequent in West Africa\r\nthan it ever was among the negro slaves in America. And how have the\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists mended matters? What do we see in the new\r\nsouth, now that slavery, the great rupturer of family circles, is no more,\r\nand a master no longer can part parent and child, or husband and wife?\r\nBefore the end of the brothers' war there had not been a single\r\nseparation of a family among my father's slaves. At much expense and\r\ninconvenience he had bought the husband of one and the wife of another in\r\norder to keep each one of these two pairs united. In 1866, Bob, a boy of\r\nsixteen, who, because of his obedience and merry-making gifts, had always\r\nbeen a greatly indulged pet, signalized his new-found freedom by stealing\r\nfrom the house of one of our neighbors some articles of considerable\r\nvalue. He fled from justice, and, never seeing his parents or his brothers\r\nand sisters again, died among strangers. In 1868, Lewis abandoned his wife\r\nEsther and their young child, and went to a distant town. Some ten years\r\nafterwards, Bill, a brother of Bob, and several years younger, convicted\r\nof an unmentionable crime, received a ten years' chain-gang sentence. Not\r\nlong before this the body of one of his two wives who was at the time out\r\nof his favor was found in a well. Reputable whites living near were\r\nconvinced that he had murdered her. If that be true, it should count as a\r\nseparation. While he was serving out his sentence his remaining wife\r\nmarried again, and this should be set down also as a separation. Bob,\r\nLewis, Esther, and Bill were slaves of my father. He did not own twenty in\r\nall. This example shows how, as to the same negroes, southern slavery\r\noperated to prevent separation of families, and how freedom has operated\r\nto encourage and stimulate it. It is not an exceptional example. My\r\nmaternal grandfather and a maternal aunt owned each many more slaves than\r\nmy father did. Some of my father's near neighbors had slaves in\r\nconsiderable number. In all of these slaves, while I knew them, there\r\nnever was a separation of a family except by death or the voluntary act of\r\nparties to a marriage? But when they were freed in 1865 separation at once\r\nbecame rife, and it has always been active. What I have just told is\r\nfairly representative of the new south throughout the cotton States.\r\n\r\nThere were now and then sales made of slaves which sundered man and wife,\r\nand parent and child; but such were extremely few, and their proportion\r\nwas steadily decreasing under two potent influences. Restraint of them by\r\nthe law had commenced and was growing. But the stronger influence was\r\ncustom and public opinion. Before approaching sales at public outcry by\r\nsheriffs or representatives of a deceased, and also before private sales,\r\nthe slaves to be sold were given opportunity to find their new masters.\r\nThere was generally a neighbor who owned husband, wife, parents, or\r\nchildren, or wanted a cook, washerwoman, seamstress, boy to make a\r\ncarpenter, striker, or blacksmith of, somebody careful with stock, etc.,\r\nand the upshot would be that the man selected by the slave had got him.\r\nThe seller had natural feelings. His wife and all of his children would do\r\ntheir utmost to get such new masters as the negroes preferred. I shall\r\nalways cherish in memory the affectionate regard which the mother of the\r\nhousehold and all the family habitually showed to their slaves. As I\r\nwrite, a sweet reminiscence comes of how the children would always clamor\r\nand mutiny against the most merited punishment of their nurse by father or\r\noverseer. There is no doubt that the slave steadily won larger place in\r\nthe domestic affections, and that his treatment by each generation of\r\nmasters was more kind and humane. And as a part of this amelioration the\r\npercentage of forced separation of slave families was all the while\r\nbecoming less.\r\n\r\nLet us devote a moment to the negro trader, as he was called, and his\r\nslave-pens, which were the subjects of much and heated invective. The\r\nfirst suggestion in order here is that there were such in West Africa, far\r\nmore frequent and far exceeding in cruelty any ever known in the south.\r\nTo take the African away from the latter and turn him over to the former\r\nwas great kindness to him. I remind my readers, in the next place, that\r\nthe factors constantly minimizing separation of slaves from other members\r\nof the family--law, public opinion becoming more sensitive, custom\r\nbecoming more merciful, and the sway of the domestic affections\r\nstronger--were _pari passu_ humanizing every incident of the commerce in\r\nslaves as property. Lastly, the negro trader and the pen, by reason of the\r\nsmall number of the slaves to whom they caused real suffering, were mercy\r\nand prosperous condition itself beside the convict gangs and pens which\r\nemancipation has put in their place, as will come out more clearly in a\r\nshort while.\r\n\r\nHis use of the lash was a dire accusation of the master. The reader thinks\r\nat once of the relevant words in a famous passage so often quoted from one\r\nof President Lincoln's messages: \"If this struggle is to be prolonged till\r\n... every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another drawn\r\nwith the sword.\" This was said March 4, 1865, a month and five days only\r\nbefore General Lee's surrender, and when all the great battles of the\r\nbrothers' war had been fought,--a war by far the most sanguinary in the\r\nworld's history. Blood did sometimes follow the blow of the lash, but not\r\noften. The overseer who could not correct without breaking the skin always\r\nlost his place. When the statement of Mr. Lincoln just commented on is\r\ncompared with the actual fact, it appears to be one of the most\r\nextravagant hyperboles ever uttered.\r\n\r\nBefore I have my readers to look at the actual facts I want to say a\r\npreliminary word. The parent was enjoined by Solomon not to spare the rod.\r\nThe rod was permitted to the master of the apprentice, the school-teacher,\r\nthe drill officer, and others. It was often used with great severity. As\r\nwe see from the Decameron husbands were wont to correct their wives by\r\nbeating them with sticks. Whipping on the bare back was a common execution\r\nof the judgment of a criminal court. Our insubordinate convicts are\r\nstrapped. The usual punishment of a slave's disobedience was to whip him.\r\nA switch was not generally used, because by reason of his thick and tough\r\nskin and lower nervous development--to use a common expression--it would\r\nnot hurt him. It was a familiar thing to me in my childhood to hear some\r\nnegro tell of the use of a switch on him by women or feeble men, how the\r\nblows could scarcely be felt, and yet with what outcry and clamor he\r\npretended that each one gave him great pain. The cowhide, but far more\r\nfrequently the whip, took the place of the switch. The former was more and\r\nmore discredited, because it could seldom be laid on hard enough without\r\ncutting the skin. The whip had a flat lash at the end, with which, as the\r\nstrap or paddle now used on our convicts, a stinging blow could be hit\r\nthat would not draw blood.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary correction of a negro did not cause him as much pain as your\r\nchild, with his far superior sensitiveness, receives when you give him the\r\nrod. Large and heavy as the overseer's whip looked, the negro, with his\r\nhigh degree of insensibility to physical pain inherited from his African\r\nancestors, who for a hundred generations or more had bestowed upon one\r\nanother all kinds of corporal torture, cared far less for it than the\r\nabolitionist who insisted on making him merely a black white man, could\r\never understand. How little of both mental and corporal suffering the lash\r\ncauses the average negro is strikingly shown by the fact that ever since\r\nhis emancipation, when he is detected in a serious offence, he is prone to\r\npropose that he be whipped instead of being carried to court. If his\r\noffer is accepted he strips off his clothes with alacrity, exclaims the\r\nconventional \"O, Lordy!\" under every fall of the whip; and when the\r\ncontract number of lashes has been given he goes away with the look and\r\nair of one who has just learned that he has drawn a lottery prize of\r\nthousands; and his nearest and dearest, his wife and children, all his\r\nsweethearts, congratulate him cordially, and the entire negro community\r\nrate him as rarely fortunate. This is enough here of the lash; but a word\r\nor two more will be appropriate when we give the chain-gang attention.\r\n\r\n  \"Run, nigger, run, patroller get you.\"\r\n\r\nThe riotous merriment of this air can be fully appreciated only by one who\r\nhas heard Cuffee sing it at the quarters while picking his banjo. It\r\ncompletely confutes the charge often made that the patrol law was a cruel\r\none. To the negro, the execution of that law was more of fun and frolic\r\nthan punishment. Let this air, and all the others to which the slaves used\r\nto dance, be meditated by those, if there are such, who incline to believe\r\nthat Professor DuBois has really detected, as he seriously contends, in\r\nthe negro melodies of the old south deep sorrow over slavery. If miserable\r\nconditions give character to musical expression, the songs, if any, that\r\nnow come forth spontaneously from the mass of southern negroes--that is,\r\nfrom those of the lower class, which class will be described later\r\nherein--ought to be sadder than the tears of Simonides.\r\n\r\nMy reader who has his memory stored with the raw-head and bloody bones\r\nfiction of abolitionists who had never set foot on an inch of slave\r\nterritory, probably thinks of bloodhounds, and wonders if I will be frank\r\nenough to mention them. He has been made to believe that runaway slaves\r\noften had the flesh torn from their bones by these dogs. I witnessed\r\nseveral chases of runaways, and in every one, when the negro was overtaken\r\nby the dogs, he was in a tree far above their reach. Think about it, and\r\nbring it home to yourself. Put yourself in the runaway's place, you would\r\nsurely understand as well as a common house cat does how to avoid pursuing\r\ndogs. Negro dogs, as they were called, were bred to be far more slow than\r\nfox dogs. The tricks of the runaway would put the latter at fault so often\r\nthat they could hardly ever catch him. Further, the packs of negro dogs\r\nwere usually too small to overpower a stout negro. He was often armed with\r\na scythe-blade for use if overtaken where he could not find a tree. When\r\nhe could keep ahead no longer he preferred taking refuge to fighting with\r\nthe dogs. He knew he could kill or disable only the few that would rush in\r\nrecklessly, and that the others would stay too far from him to be hurt and\r\nyet keep him at bay. He was now going to be caught, and he would think it\r\nbetter not to provoke the ire of the owners by killing or injuring their\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nThe negro hunted the 'possum and 'coon by night and the hare--the rabbit,\r\nas everybody called it--on Sundays, half-holidays, and Christmas, either\r\nwith his young master or without him, and always with the dogs; which he\r\nthus learned to control. A negro woman cooked the corn-bread and\r\npot-liquor, with which they were fed by her or some other slave. They were\r\nalways waiting near when the slaves ate by day in the fields or at all\r\nhours of night in their cabins, and many a bit was thrown to them. Usually\r\nthere was the greatest friendship between the dogs on the plantation,\r\nthose intended for chasing runaways included, and the negroes. It was\r\ngreat entertainment for a negro, at the command of his master, to give the\r\nyoung negro dogs a race, as it was called. These races were frequent, and\r\nthey were the entire training of the dogs for their business. A hunting\r\ndog when lost will track his master. And many a runaway was caught by dogs\r\nwhich he was in the habit of feeding and hunting with. The average negro\r\nof those days, prowling so much at night as he did, necessarily became a\r\nmost expert dog-tamer. How often I have been diverted with this sight! A\r\nstrange negro, coming on some errand, intrepidly opens the front gate and\r\nenters the yard of a dwelling. A savage dog dashes forward. Just as the\r\ndog couches near for his spring, the negro, by a very quick movement,\r\ntakes off his hat and extends it to the dog. The latter turns his eyes\r\naway from the negro, looks at the old, soiled wool hat, smells it, and\r\nthen retires, nonplussed.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule a negro was safe from the bite of dogs. Running away was\r\nnot frequent. The almost insuperable difficulty of final escape from the\r\ndogs prevented it. And it was in practice a most mild means of prevention.\r\nI suppose that I knew and heard of the catching of some twenty odd slaves\r\nin the contiguous parts of Oglethorpe, Wilkes, Taliaferro, and Greene\r\ncounties, which constituted the locality with which I was familiar, and in\r\nnot a single case was one injured by the bloodhounds. The dogs that are\r\nnow turned loose after our convicts are of far more savage temper than\r\nwere the negro dogs of the old south; and consequently the human game,\r\nwhen come up with, is more prompt to go up a tree than was the old slave.\r\n\r\nThere was much less lack of food and raiment among the slaves than among\r\nthe class known as the white trash. It was considered a business blunder\r\nnot to keep them supplied always with more food than they wanted. They\r\nwere in better physical condition than the average white laborer now\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nAnd they were not worked hard. Even in the longest days of the year, when\r\nthe battle with the grass was fiercest, at night the quarters were\r\nresonant with mirth, song, and dancing as soon as the mules had been\r\nwatered, stabled, and fed.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a report, from my observation on the spot, of \"all the\r\ntragic evils of slavery\" to the negro in the south. I have been at pains\r\nto make it as true as can be. I purpose to follow it now with a like\r\nreport of all the gladsome blessings to him of his freedom.\r\n\r\nHis true and fast friends, the abolitionists, equalized him _per saltum_\r\nto his master as a voter and office-holder. This single measure was sure\r\nto make deadly enemies of white and black in the south, and to bring a war\r\nof races in which the superior one was bound to conquer and become\r\nabsolute. This war did come, and was fought out. Profound peace has\r\nreigned for some years, and the negroes now contentedly stay away from the\r\npolls, and manifest no aspiration whatever for office and place.\r\n\r\nHis same friends gave the ex-slave equality with his old master under the\r\ncriminal law. He had this in slavery only when charged with a capital\r\noffence; and if he was charged with a graver one of the non-capital\r\noffences, such as breaking and entering a dwelling, stealing something of\r\nconsiderable value, he was brought before a statutory court of justices of\r\nthe peace, and if upon his summary trial he was convicted, his punishment\r\nwas usually a short term in jail, the sheriff to give him so many lashes\r\neach day until he had received the full number adjudged in his sentence. I\r\nnever heard of one that was seriously injured by this kind of punishment.\r\nIt never gave him any permanent mental anguish. His conscience approved\r\nwhipping as the most fit punishment for every offence. The crimes of\r\nnegroes mentioned above in this paragraph were very infrequent. Their many\r\npeccadillos were in practice wholly ignored by the law, and given over to\r\nprivate and domestic jurisdiction. Cuffee would sometimes indulge a sudden\r\ncraving for fresh meat by appropriating a shoat or grown lamb, or he would\r\ngratify a watering mouth by stealthy invasion of melon patches or sweet\r\npotato patches and banks. And he was prone to other small larcenies. If\r\ncaught,--which was very far from always happening,--he was whipped; and\r\nthat was the last of it. Now he must replace the bounty of his master\r\nwhich sheltered, clothed, and fed him comfortably all his life by living\r\nfrom hand to mouth. His forecast utterly undeveloped, and more and more\r\nlosing the work habit, there is often but one way for him to avoid\r\nstarving or freezing, and that is to get the necessaries of life by\r\nvarious acts which are crimes in the law. It is but a scanty supply that\r\nhe thus manages to get. His year is nearly always, from beginning to end,\r\nbut an alternation of short feasts upon the cheapest fare, and prolonged\r\nfasts. Yet in the eye of the stern and severe law how many gross offences\r\ndoes he commit by doing only the things which, if he did not do, he could\r\nnot keep soul and body together. And so he is brought before every court\r\nof any criminal jurisdiction, and when convicted, as he generally is, for\r\nhe is nearly always guilty,--not in conscience, but guilty under the law\r\nwhich his emancipators have put him under,--often he cannot find a friend\r\nto pay his fine, and he must work it out in the chain-gang. The city has\r\nits chain-gang, the county has its chain-gang, and the State works or\r\nfarms out its convicts. The percentage of whites among these convicts is\r\nvery small. Often when you encounter a gang at work you cannot find a\r\nsingle white person in it. These negro convicts are many, many. As fast\r\nas one's time expires his place is filled by another. Disease, decay of\r\nenergy from irregular food supply, growing habits of idleness, and other\r\nthings in the train, bring forth tramps more plentifully, and from these\r\nthe chain-gangs are more and more largely recruited. These slaves of\r\npunishment work under the eyes of guards furnished with the best of\r\nsmall-arms loaded to kill. The most of them work in shackles. If they do\r\nnot work as their superintendents think they ought, they are strapped. I\r\nhave seen them working in the rain, as I never saw required of slaves. At\r\nnight they are put to sleep in a crowded log-pen, all of them chained\r\ntogether, the chain being made fast to each bunk. The guards are practised\r\nmarksmen, known to be men who will promptly and resolutely \"do their\r\nduty.\" This hell-like life constantly keeps each convict watching for\r\nopportunity to make a dash for liberty. If the guards have anything like\r\nfair shots when he starts, one more unmarked and soon forgotten grave is\r\ndug and filled in the paupers' burial ground, and that is the earthly end\r\nof this poor derelict of the human race. Suppose he gets safely away from\r\nthe guard. In a few minutes the unleashed dogs are yelping on his track.\r\nIn the old days even the negro dogs were fed and tended by slaves, and\r\nalmost every dog in the land seemed to love negroes. But these bloodhounds\r\nin the convict camps have been bred into a deadly hatred of every negro.\r\nEscaping Cuffee is usually caught. Then more of the paddle, heavier\r\nshackles, chains at night stronger and more taut, and the bosses harder to\r\nsatisfy as he works under greater hindrances--these make his lot more\r\nhell-like than it was before.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy proof of the insufficient dietary and bad hygiene of\r\nthe common negroes that these convicts fatten in spite of their cruel\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\nThe long-term convicts, farmed out to coal and other mine owners and\r\nvarious manufacturers, and private employers, I know but little of from\r\nobservation. But what I hear makes me believe that their condition is\r\nworse than that of those just described. This is to be expected, for two\r\nreasons. First, they are worked for profit by persons whose only interest\r\nis to get the largest possible product out of their labor. The labor\r\nexacted by the owner, bear in mind, would not be severe enough either to\r\nimpair the market value or check vigorous reproduction of his slaves.\r\nSecond, the places where these convicts are worked are more or less\r\nretired, and thus the employer escapes scrutiny nearly all the year. Think\r\nof a negro who, receiving a twenty years' sentence for burglariously\r\nstealing a ham when he was hungry, is put to work in the coal mine! Who\r\never hears of him afterwards? He is soon forgotten by his wife, who takes\r\nanother husband, and by his children either skulking here and there to\r\nshun the officer, or toiling in a chain-gang. Here is indeed a bitter\r\nslavery--bitterer by far than any West Africa ever knew. There the slave\r\ndoes not labor underground and out of the sun so dear to him. His\r\nmanumission comes mercifully in many ways, long before the expiration of\r\ntwenty years--the sacrifice may need a victim; he may starve; he may fall\r\nsick and be cast out in the bush. But the mine slave--the mine boss will\r\nnot whip him hard enough to give him even short rest from his work, work,\r\nwork; he shall always have enough of raiment, food, and sleep to keep him\r\nable to work, work, work; when he gets very sick the mine doctor will\r\npatch him up and send him back to his work, work, work; he will work,\r\nwork, work out his twenty years in this hell hole. Miss Landon in her\r\nimmortal invective against child labor exclaims:\r\n\r\n  \"Good God! to think upon a child\r\n    That has no childish days,\r\n  No careless play, no frolics wild,\r\n    No words of prayer and praise!\"\r\n\r\nThis factory child that never knew any of the proper joys of a child is\r\nwithout either sweet memory or unavailing wish. But the mine slave, the\r\nmost of whose former life was passed in the open air, how he pines for the\r\nsplendor of his loved sun by day; how in his bunk he recalls his rounds by\r\nnight when the Seven Stars, the Ell and Yard and Job's Coffin were his\r\nclock and the North Star his compass. Each part of the revolving year\r\nwhispers to him when he is at work or dreaming. Christmas suggests the jug\r\nwith the corn-cob stopper, the 'possum cooked brown, the yams exuding\r\ntheir sugary juice, the banjo picker and his song, the fiddle playing a\r\ndancing tune, and the floor shaking under the thumping footfalls; the cold\r\nweather following suggests the 'possum and 'coon hunt; the early spring\r\nbrings what he used to call the corn-planting birds and their lively\r\ncalls; and on and on his thoughts go over mocking-bird, woodpecker, early\r\npeaches and apples, full orchards spared by frost, the watermelon,\r\nsolitary and incomparable among all things for a negro to eat, his Sunday\r\nfishings and rabbit hunts, his church and society meetings, this and that\r\ndusky love who fooled him into believing that he was dearer to her than\r\nhusband or any other man, especially some yellow girl, his nonesuch,\r\nexceeding all other women as the watermelon excels all other produce of\r\ntree or vine,--on and on his thoughts go over what he can never have\r\nagain. I need not say a word for the white victims of child labor, for\r\ntheir race is rousing for their rescue, and I know its power to achieve.\r\nBut I do feel that it is my duty to put that friendless, forgotten,\r\nlong-term negro convict in the minds of my southern readers. If he must\r\nbe a convict, do not farm him out to mine operators or where he will be\r\nworked behind any screen. Put all our convicts, both felony and\r\nmisdemeanor, upon the public roads until they need only a little working\r\nnow and then, say I. There the convicts will not be worked for profit, nor\r\nin secret.\r\n\r\nThe total of the negroes suffering in southern slavery from all causes\r\nfalls in amount far below that alone which has come upon him because he\r\nwas stupidly subjected to the white man's criminal law, and not given\r\nreformatories and other belongings of the system which we are perfecting\r\nfor juvenile offenders. The suffering in slavery was occasional only, and\r\nsoon over. The present suffering of the negroes under the criminal law is\r\nconstant, and is to be found rife in every locality. The aggregate of the\r\nfelony and misdemeanor convicts of Georgia now at hard labor is about\r\n4,500. The convicts sentenced by city and town police courts for short\r\nterms of days I cannot give with any approximate accuracy. I think it\r\nprobable that the number of those convicted each year in the municipal\r\ncourts is somewhat larger than that of those convicted in the State\r\ncourts. By reason of a late wholesale reduction of felonies the number of\r\nlong-term convicts does not increase,--it is at a standstill,--but the\r\nnumber of the misdemeanor and municipal convicts steadily increases. More\r\nthan nine-tenths of those in each one of the three classes are negroes.\r\nThe stench, filth, and discomfort of their nights and the hardship of\r\ntheir days, who can describe? How it moves my pity to see, as I often do,\r\nthe convict toiling incessantly for long hours, impeded and tortured by\r\nhis iron shackles, the paddle at hand, and a double-barrel or Winchester\r\nfrowning over him, each to be used on occasion by somebody who cares\r\nnothing for and has no interest in him. Weary as the worker may be, a\r\nword from the boss gives new impetus to his pick or shovel. Here is the\r\nonly place I have ever known on American soil where one can find \"poor,\r\noppressed, bleeding Africa.\" How different it was with the slave offender!\r\nIt mattered not what was the charge against him, he had persons related to\r\nhim both in interest and affection who would intercede powerfully at his\r\ncall. Wherever he might be,--in the sheriff's hands, or locked up by the\r\noverseer in the gin-house,--a messenger-service as secret and more sure\r\nthan wireless telegraphy even if not as quick, was at his command; and\r\nsome child, white or colored, or favorite servant would carry his\r\nentreaties to the Big House. And the justices, or ole master or the\r\noverseer, would be influenced by a word from ole miss, or the tears of\r\nyoung miss, or the importunity of young master. In the end Cuffee's\r\npunishment would be made tolerable; and after it was over he would the\r\nnext night at the cabin brag joyfully of the many friends he had and what\r\ngreat things they had done for him--the children of his master present and\r\nshowing more gladness than himself.\r\n\r\nWhich of the two was the more humane and christian punitive system for the\r\nnegro? Which of the two was the better for him? That of slavery, or that\r\nproduced by the conditions which his professed friends put in place of\r\nslavery?\r\n\r\nI assert it most solemnly that I never saw a negro slave worked in\r\nshackles and under a loaded firearm, neither by his master nor an\r\noverseer, nor by their command, nor by an officer of the law; and,\r\nfurther, that I never had information or report that such had been done.\r\n\r\nWhen their emancipators led the negroes out of their cabins into their new\r\nlife it was something like throwing our domestic animals into the forest\r\nand desert, where they, without formed habits of self-maintenance and\r\nwithout knowledge of the new environment, must live, if they can live,\r\nonly in competition with their wild brothers and sisters knowing the\r\nenvironment and who are self-maintaining experts therein. That comparison\r\nserves somewhat. But this comes nearer: Suppose children between the ages\r\nof eight and twelve, who have never been taught to do anything for\r\nthemselves, to be taken away from their parents, and settled among a\r\npeople lately made bitterly hostile to the children, as the whites were\r\nmade to the negroes by the effort of the emancipators to give political\r\nequality--nay, supremacy--to the latter. Those emancipated children must\r\nsubsist themselves. How little they could earn by begging or work. They\r\nwould have to steal to live. Those that did not steal, and for whom no\r\ncompanion would steal, would perish. The philanthropists who founded this\r\ninfantile colony would have outdone but by a very little those who thrust\r\nthe reluctant negroes into freedom.\r\n\r\nI ask my reader to add here mentally the full description which in my last\r\ntwo chapters I have given of the lower class of the negroes in the\r\nsouth--this description showing them to be ninety-five per cent of the\r\nwhole, far below their average condition in American slavery, and steadily\r\nbecoming worse.\r\n\r\nI believe that in due time the people of the north will make these\r\nadmissions:\r\n\r\n1. Any and every evil of southern slavery to the negro was accidental, and\r\nnot a necessary incident of the system, just as the occasional evils of\r\nmarriage to the parties are not necessarily incidental to that\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n2. As this slavery had improved and was still improving the negroes so\r\nprodigiously in every particular, and as their condition during the forty\r\nyears following emancipation has been going uninterruptedly from bad to\r\nworse, until now the extinction of the great body is frightfully probable,\r\nas I shall show in my last two chapters, the sudden and sweeping abolition\r\nof 1865 was an unutterable misfortune to these dependent creatures.\r\nEmancipation ought to have been gradual. Especially ought there to have\r\nbeen established something like the Roman patronate, under which the\r\nfreedman would have been sure of wise advice, beneficial overlooking, and\r\nefficient protection from his former master.\r\n\r\n3. The grant at once of right to vote and hold place and office to the\r\nsouthern negroes indiscriminately exceeds all blunders of democracy in\r\nmadness and stupidity.\r\n\r\n4. Southern slavery, so far from being wrong morally, was righteousness,\r\njustice, and mercy to the slave. The federal constitution was simply\r\nobeying the commands of good conscience in recognizing the slave as the\r\nproperty of his owner, and protecting that property. Therefore, when the\r\nfederal government emancipated the slaves it ought to have given the\r\nmasters just compensation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for what American slavery was to the negro, and what its abolition\r\nhas done for him in the south. This can be told now. But for years the\r\npowers watching over our union kept the subject in the dark. It did not\r\nsuit their purpose that the people of the union-preserving section should\r\nsee and understand. They had decreed that northern resistance to slavery,\r\nas the solitary root of disunion, should go beyond refusing it extension\r\ninto the Territories. They chose to add another provocation of the\r\nsecession which they had planned as the means of abolishing slavery. This\r\nnew provocation was that the north be induced to make the fugitive slave\r\nlaw a dead letter. To drive the south into early secession, perhaps it\r\nwould not be enough merely to deny her new territory. But unite the north\r\nagainst the law mentioned, and encourage both running away and the\r\nunderground railroad by an active public opinion, then soon all along the\r\nsouthern border slavery will lose its hold, some of the slaves escaping\r\nand the rest going south. This zone will, after a while, be settled by the\r\nfriends and employers of free labor, who from year to year will push the\r\nsouthern non-slave district further in. The menace of this hostile\r\noccupation will steadily become greater to the slaveholders, and finally\r\nit will convince them that they cannot protect slavery in the union.\r\n\r\nMany northerners who declared it was wrong to interfere with slavery in\r\nthe States, at the same time sympathized with the public opposition to\r\nrestoring the fugitive to his master. It is clear that they did not regard\r\nthis opposition to be what it really was; that is, actual war upon slavery\r\nwhere it existed. To oppose execution of the law was both to invite and\r\nhelp runaways. And if such invitation and help was persisted in, from one\r\nend of Mason and Dixon's line to the other, the risk of escape of slaves\r\nand their consequent depreciation in market value would both steadily\r\nincrease. The refusal to enforce the fugitive slave law was therefore a\r\ndeadly attack upon slavery in the States; and this was so plain that the\r\nunion-loving people of Georgia declared in the famous Georgia Platform of\r\n1850 that the union could not be preserved if that law was not faithfully\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe faithful guardians of the American union had \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\r\nwritten of purpose to prevent the execution of the fugitive slave law.\r\nThey hypnotized the root-and-branch abolitionists and Mrs. Stowe into\r\nbelieving that to abet in any way the restoration of a flying slave was an\r\nunpardonable crime; and that the obligation of conscience to refrain from\r\ncommitting such a crime imperatively commanded disregard of all counter\r\nprovisions of the constitution and the law of the land. One cannot at all\r\nunderstand the mighty abolition movement if he stop with the professed\r\nmotives of Phillips, Whittier, Garrison, Mrs. Stowe, and the rest. They\r\nbelieved in their hearts, and declared, its purpose was to wipe out the\r\ngreat national disgrace of slavery, to lift the slave out of an abyss of\r\nunspeakable outrage and injustice, and to better his condition. As we have\r\nshown you, they were, in their very extreme of conscientiousness, as wide\r\nfrom the facts and right as wide can be. They were not doing their own\r\nwills, as they thought they were. They but did the will of the fates. The\r\nlatter ruthlessly--so it seems to us now--sacrificed both the prosperity\r\nand comfort of the southern people for several generations, and the very\r\nexistence, it may be, of nearly all the negroes in America, besides also\r\nmaking a laughing-stock of the abolitionists--all to the end to kill that\r\nnationalization which threatened the integrity of the American union.\r\n\r\nI believe that I can now take my reader on with me in what I have to say\r\nof Mrs. Stowe's book. Let him bear in mind that the object of the fates\r\nwas to have in it not a representation true to fact, but such an untrue\r\nand probable one as would unite the people of the north in moral and\r\nconscientious resolve against any and every attempt to restore a fugitive\r\nslave. What the fates wanted was an author who appeared to have extensive\r\nand accurate acquaintance with slavery, and who, while believing it most\r\nconscientiously to be the extreme of evil to the black, was endowed with\r\nthe power to make the north see with _her_ eyes. They found their author\r\nin Mrs. Stowe, whom they had educated and trained from infancy.\r\n\r\nIn view of the mighty influence which \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" exercised upon\r\npublic opinion, it is important to examine what were Mrs. Stowe's\r\nqualifications to speak as an authority on southern slavery. And in this\r\ninvestigation the same qualifications of all others who arraigned the\r\nsystem for what they alleged were its heinous moral wrongs to the slave\r\nare likewise involved. The statement of Professor Wendell, quoted above,\r\nthat she was the only one of the abolitionists who had observed slavery\r\n\"on the spot,\" can be corroborated by overwhelming proofs. If it be made\r\nto appear, as I think will be the case, that she was from first to last\r\nunder a delusion which metamorphosed the negro into a Caucasian, and\r\nfurther that she had no real opportunities of learning the facts of\r\nslavery, then the case of the root-and-branch abolitionists must fall with\r\nthe testimony of the only eye-witness whom they have called.\r\n\r\nWhether she was biased or not we will let her own words decide. Here they\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    \"I was a child in 1820 [she was then nine years old] when the Missouri\r\n    question was agitated; and one of the strongest and deepest\r\n    impressions on my mind was that made by my father's sermons and\r\n    prayers, and the anguish of his soul for the poor slave at that time.\r\n    I remember his preaching drawing tears down the hardest faces of the\r\n    old farmers in his congregation. I well remember his prayers morning\r\n    and evening in the family for 'poor, oppressed, bleeding Africa,' that\r\n    the time of her deliverance might come; prayers offered with strong\r\n    crying and tears, and which indelibly impressed my heart, and made me\r\n    what I am from my very soul, the enemy of all slavery. Every brother\r\n    that I have has been in his sphere a leading anti-slavery man. As for\r\n    myself and husband, we have for the last seventeen years lived on the\r\n    border of a slave State, and we have never shrunk from the fugitives,\r\n    and we have helped them with all we had to give. I have received the\r\n    children of liberated slaves into a family school, and taught them\r\n    with my own children, and it has been the influence that we found in\r\n    the church and by the altar that has made us do all this.\"[90]\r\n\r\nNo comment is needed. The passage shows that her strongly excited feelings\r\nunavoidably shaped all her perceptions and formed all her judgments as to\r\neverything in slavery.\r\n\r\nNow as to the means she had of acquiring the facts. Although she had seen\r\na little of Kentucky, a border slave State, she had never lived in it, nor\r\nanywhere else in the south. Especially is it to be emphasized that she had\r\nhad no experience of the cotton region, the real seat of slavery, and the\r\nonly place where it could be fully studied and learned. She passed some\r\neighteen years in lower Ohio, just across the river from Kentucky, where\r\nshe saw much of escaping slaves. Of course, being aflame with zeal as she\r\nwas for her subject, she had observed closely the native negroes of the\r\nnorth. Such of these as she met were widely different from the mass in\r\nslavery; for, born and bred in the north, they had had the beneficent\r\ntraining of the free-labor system, and also opportunity to absorb\r\nconsiderable of a higher culture. These negroes were exceptional, even of\r\nthe northern natives. And the fugitives were also exceptional; for they\r\nfar excelled the companions left behind them in intelligence, spirit, and\r\nevery essential of good character. An ordinary Cuffee had liberty the\r\nleast of all things in his thoughts. A negro like Hector or Garrison, the\r\nformer escaping from Calhoun and the other from Toombs, was as much above\r\nthe average as the shepherd dog is above common sheep-worriers and\r\negg-suckers. Mrs. Stowe, as her book shows, had no conception whatever of\r\nthe ordinary plantation negro. And while she had seen much of some\r\nKentuckians, these were not representative southerners. They lived upon\r\nthe border, where slave labor found but little lucrative opportunity, and\r\nthey were also affected more or less with the sentiments of their nearby\r\nnorthern neighbors. Naturally only those Kentuckians of the border who\r\nreally were of her opinion would consort with this decided anti-slavery\r\npartisan; the others would stand aloof. Mrs. Stowe never knew either real\r\nnegroes or real slaveholders. And she also knew nothing whatever of cotton\r\nplantation management. Some authors show an amazingly full and accurate\r\nknowledge of countries and communities which they never saw. Burke's\r\nknowledge of every detail touching India occurs to me. Lieber had visited\r\nGreece while Niebuhr had not. When the former had minutely described to\r\nthe other some famous landscape,--say the battlefield of\r\nMarathon,--Niebuhr would make copious inquiries about remains of old roads\r\nand belongings which the other had forgotten, although he had seen them.\r\nTom Moore had never been in Persia, but there is so much of that country\r\ndrawn to the life in Lalla Rookh that somebody applied to him the saying\r\nthat reading D'Herbelot was as good as riding on the back of a camel. Mrs.\r\nStowe could not collect, sift, and read facts, and see through the most\r\ncunningly devised masks, as Henry D. Lloyd showed his marvellous power to\r\ndo in \"Wealth against Commonwealth.\" That was not her gift. Her gift was\r\nto tell the best of stories--to vary it prodigally and artistically\r\nthroughout with wonders, with things to make you shudder and also thrill\r\nwith pleasure, with things to make you cry and laugh. Her emotional\r\ninvention was the great factor. Here is her own account:\r\n\r\n    \"The first part of the book ever committed to writing was the death of\r\n    Uncle Tom. This scene presented itself almost as a tangible vision to\r\n    her mind while sitting at the communion-table in the little church in\r\n    Brunswick. She was perfectly overcome by it, and could scarcely\r\n    restrain the convulsion of tears and sobbings that shook her frame.\r\n    She hastened home and wrote it, and her husband being away she read it\r\n    to her two sons of ten and twelve years of age. The little fellows\r\n    broke out into convulsions of weeping, one of them saying through his\r\n    sobs, 'Oh, mamma, slavery is the most cursed thing in the world!'\"\r\n\r\nThe description of Uncle Tom's death is the goal and climax of the novel.\r\nIts scene is laid far down in the south, hundreds of miles below any place\r\nwhich she or the children had ever seen or studied. It would have been\r\nmore in order for her to submit the draft to observant residents of that\r\nlocality; but the fates did not intend that her convictions should be\r\nweakened by real information. Evidently she considered that her truth to\r\nfact was fully vindicated by the effect of the narrative upon her\r\nchildren, who, like herself, were entirely without knowledge of the\r\nsubject. They wept and exclaimed over it. Why, of course, like all\r\nchildren they loved horrible tales, which their weeping and lamentation\r\nproved that they thought were true. Doubtless these same children had made\r\nrespectable demonstrations over Bluebeard or Little Red Ridinghood. And\r\nnow over Uncle Tom's death, which is more dreadful than anything in\r\nDante's Inferno, and as pure figment, their feelings were shaken with\r\nstorm and tempest as never before.\r\n\r\nThe statement just quoted proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n    \"From that time the story can less be said to have been composed by\r\n    her than imposed upon her. Scenes, incidents, conversations rushed\r\n    upon her with a vividness and importunity that would not be denied.\r\n    The book insisted upon getting itself into being, and would take no\r\n    denial.\"\r\n\r\nI often fancy, as I think over it, that the last quotation describes\r\nsuggestions from the fates.\r\n\r\nBut we must let Mrs. Stowe finish what we have had her tell in part.\r\nInforming us that, after writing \"two or three first chapters,\" she made\r\nan arrangement for weekly serial publication in the _National Era_, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"She was then in the midst of heavy domestic cares, with a young\r\n    infant, with a party of pupils in her family to whom she was imparting\r\n    daily lessons with her own children, and with untrained servants\r\n    requiring constant supervision, but the story was so much more intense\r\n    a reality to her than any other earthly thing that the weekly\r\n    instalment never failed. It was there in her mind day and night\r\n    waiting to be written, and requiring but a few moments to bring it\r\n    into veritable characters. _The weekly number was always read to the\r\n    family circle before it was sent away, and all the household kept up\r\n    an intense interest in the progress of the story._\"[91]\r\n\r\nThis household had been indoctrinated by the zeal of Dr. Lyman Beecher\r\ninto believing unreservedly all the inventions of ignorant assailants of\r\nslavery instead of the widely different facts.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin a detailed statement of the material errors and perversions\r\nof fact in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" I want to emphasize it that every one of\r\nthem appeared to northern readers, unfamiliar with the negro and the\r\nsouth, to be true, and most efficiently helped to form and strengthen\r\nsentiment against enforcement of the fugitive slave law.\r\n\r\nMany things that she writes show that Mrs. Stowe was completely ignorant\r\nof the ways of the cotton plantation. I have space to mention but one. Tom\r\nwas bred in Kentucky, where no cotton was grown. And Cassy, by reason of\r\nher indulgent rearing, had had as little experience as Tom in\r\ncotton-picking. Yet these two show such expertness that Tom can add to the\r\nsack of a slower picker, and Cassy give Tom some of her cotton, and each\r\nhave enough to satisfy the weigher at night. The good cotton-picker is\r\nsurely a most skilled laborer. He must be trained from childhood to use\r\nboth hands so well that he becomes almost ambidexterous. The training that\r\nthe typewriter is now urged to take is a parallel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe shows that she had no accurate knowledge of the sentiments of\r\nthe whites of the south as to slavery. As we have already suggested, there\r\nmay have been among the Kentuckians of the border some outspoken opponents\r\nof slavery; but it is very probable that in her womanly ardor for her\r\ngreat cause she lavishly magnified their numbers. In her novel she has\r\nnearly all of her white southerners--I may add all of the attractive\r\nones--to declare themselves as abolitionists at heart. Misrepresentation\r\nof fact could not be grosser than this. I was twenty-five years old when\r\nthe brothers' war commenced. I had mingled intimately with the people,\r\nhigh and low, of my part of the south. During all of this time I never\r\nfound out there was a single one of my acquaintances, man, woman, boy, or\r\ngirl, who did not believe slavery right. The charge implied by Mrs. Stowe\r\nthat we southerners were doing violence to our consciences in holding on\r\nto our slaves is utterly without evidence; nay, it is unanimously\r\ncontradicted by all the evidence. As we and our parents read the bible, it\r\ntold us to hold on to them, but to treat them always with considerate\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe emphasizes the frequent cruelty of the master to the slave; and\r\nshe emphasizes more strongly still that under the law he was helpless. The\r\nslave was not helpless. He was protected by law. Note this example, given\r\nby Toombs:\r\n\r\n    \"The most authentic statistics of England show that the wages of\r\n    agricultural and unskilled labor in that kingdom not only fail to\r\n    furnish the laborer with the comforts of our slave, but even with the\r\n    necessaries of life, and no slaveholder could escape _a conviction for\r\n    cruelty to his slaves_ who gave his slave no more of the necessaries\r\n    of life for his labor than the wages paid to their agricultural\r\n    laborers by the noblemen and gentlemen of England would buy.\"[92]\r\n\r\nThe witness just called has full knowledge, and is the extreme of frank\r\nhonesty and truthfulness.\r\n\r\nThe statute-book demonstrates that the law was steadily bettering the\r\ncondition of the slave. I have not space to state the progression which\r\ncan be found in the different Georgia enactments. But I must mention two\r\ninstances. In 1850 the procedure of trying a white person charged with a\r\ncapital offence was extended to the slave. The code which came of force\r\nJanuary 1, 1863, and which had been adopted some while before, prevented\r\nany confession made by a slave to his master--it mattered not how\r\nvoluntary or free from suspicion it might be--from ever being received in\r\nevidence against him.\r\n\r\nI commenced law practice in 1857. From that time until I went to the front\r\nI observed that public opinion was becoming more decided against\r\nmistreatment of the blacks. The masters of _ashcats_,--as ill-fed negroes\r\nwere called in derision of their lean and dingy faces by the great\r\nmultitude of sleek and shining ones,--those who punished with unreasonable\r\nseverity, those who exacted overwork,--they were few and far\r\nbetween,--they were all more and more detested; and grand juries became\r\nmore and more prone to deal properly with them. I would support this by\r\ncases, if their citation would not be unpleasant to descendants of\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe has his master to brand George Harris in the hand with the\r\ninitial letter of the former's surname. She has Legree's slaves to pick\r\ncotton on Sunday. I never heard of any cases of branding human beings\r\nexcept as a punishment for crime in execution of a judgment of conviction,\r\nand very few of them. Tidying up the house, cooking, serving meals, caring\r\nfor the animals on the place, and such other things as are done everywhere\r\non Sunday, were of course required of the domestic slaves. Leaving these\r\nout, no slave was ever put to work on Sunday except to \"fight fire,\" or at\r\nsomething commanded by a real emergency. Their employers now exact from\r\nthousands of white persons of both sexes all over the country a great\r\namount of such hard and grinding Sunday work as was never exacted of the\r\nslaves in the south. Peep into stores, offices of large corporations, and\r\nelsewhere, while others are at Sunday-school or church, and count those\r\nweary ones you find finishing up the work of the last week.\r\n\r\nBut all of the mistakes of Mrs. Stowe noticed in the foregoing are mere\r\nmatters of bagatelle as compared with the character and nature which she\r\ngives the average negro of the south.\r\n\r\nShe represents the women as chaste as white women, and the husbands\r\nfaithful to their wives even when separated from them. I shall now tell\r\nthe truth as I know it to be--the truth that all observant people who have\r\nhad experience with negroes know.\r\n\r\nThe moment almost that a married pair of slaves were separated for any\r\ncause, each one secretly, or more often openly, took another partner. Even\r\nwhen not separated, infidelity of both was the rule. Mrs. Stowe has the\r\ngirls and their parents to shrink with horror from the desires of the\r\nmaster. To the simple-hearted African the master was always great, and\r\nthere was among them not a woman to be found who would not dedicate\r\nherself or her daughter to greatness, finding it so inclined,--husband,\r\nfather, brothers, and sisters all in their desire for a friend at court\r\nheartily approving. The white whose concubine gave favors behind his back\r\nto her slave friends was the stalest joke of every neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the negroes are more unchaste now than they were in slavery, a\r\nsubject of which I shall say something further in another chapter. But\r\neven where the master's steady requirement from one generation to another\r\nof a stricter observance of family ties, and the natural imitation of the\r\nways of the dominant race, had lifted the slaves, in appearance at least,\r\nfar above their West African ancestors, not even mothers had become\r\nchaste. Boys, girls, men, and women, both married and unmarried, were as\r\npromiscuous by night as houseflies are by day. The horror of horrors in\r\nthis abyss of moral impurity to one of a superior race was their utter\r\nunconsciousness of incest.[93]\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe has their philoprogenitiveness--as phrenologists call it--as\r\nfully developed as the whites. One bred in the cotton districts well\r\nremembers that it required all the vigilance of master and mistress,\r\noverseer, and the deputies selected from the older slave women, to secure\r\nfrom the mothers proper attention to their children, and especially to\r\nkeep them from punishing too cruelly. But I do not mean to say that this\r\nparental misbehavior was as general as the unchastity mentioned. When the\r\nmothers aged beyond forty-five or fifty, they would begin to think\r\nsomewhat less of beaux and somewhat more of their children.\r\n\r\nGeorge Harris and Eliza are next of the slave characters in prominence and\r\nimportance to Uncle Tom. With their large admixture of white blood, their\r\ncomparatively good education and superb moral training, a southerner would\r\nthink that you were merely mocking him if you named these as fairly\r\nrepresentative negroes. As they are drawn, they are really whites--whites\r\nof high refinement--with only a physical negro exterior, and that softened\r\ndown to the minimum.\r\n\r\nBut Uncle Tom--I pray my northern readers to take counsel of their common\r\nsense and consider what I shall now say of him. Rightly to estimate him, I\r\nmust begin with some contrasts. The first that occurs to me is Tyndarus,\r\nthe slave hero of the Captivi of Plautus, pronounced by the great critic\r\nLessing to be the most beautiful play ever brought upon the stage.\r\nTyndarus and Philocrates, his young master, taken prisoners, are sold to\r\nHegio. The two captives personate each other, and induce Hegio to send\r\nhome Philocrates, who was a wealthy noble, and keep only the born slave.\r\nHegio was scheming to recover his own son, now a slave in the land of the\r\ncaptives, by a bargain for Philocrates, this bargain to be negotiated by\r\nthe counterfeit Tyndarus. Discovering how he had been duped, the anguished\r\nfather tells the real Tyndarus that he shall die a cruel death. This is\r\nthe reply of the slave:\r\n\r\n    \"As I shall not die because of evil deeds, that is a small matter. My\r\n    death will keep it ever in remembrance that I delivered my master from\r\n    slavery and the enemy, restored him to his country and father, and\r\n    chose that I myself should perish rather than he.\"\r\n\r\nThat is exalted. But Tyndarus has not the complete goodness of Uncle Tom.\r\nAs soon as he is at last rescued from the horrible mines, to find\r\nPhilocrates true and himself a free man, he threatens woe to a slave who\r\nhad injured him, and looks approvingly upon the execution of his threat.\r\n\r\nCompare Uncle Tom with the good men of the bible, such as Moses, Peter,\r\nand Paul, to mention no more. Not one of these was able always to keep his\r\nfeelings and tongue in that complete subjection that never fail Uncle Tom.\r\n\r\nUncle Tom, in whom love alone prompts all thoughts and deeds, surpasses\r\nevery saint in Dante's Paradise--he surpasses even the incomparably sweet\r\nBeatrice, who now and then chides unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe climax of my comparison is reached when I suggest that Uncle Tom is\r\nmade from first to last a more perfect Christ than the Jesus of the\r\ngospels. The latter, as Matthew Arnold and other reverent christians\r\nremark, was sometimes unamiable. Remember his expulsion of the money\r\nchangers and traders from the temple, and the many opprobrious words he\r\nused of and to the Pharisees. Growing recognition of the all-human Jesus\r\nis benignly replacing a religion of superstition, intolerance, and dogma\r\nwith one of universal love and brotherhood. I cannot fully express my\r\nappreciation of the liberal divines, from Charming to Savage, who are\r\npreparing us so well for the millennium. But I am sure a new study of\r\nUncle Tom would give each one of them firmer grasp of christlikeness and\r\nfar more power to present it. Think over such instances in that holiest\r\nand most altruistic of lives as these: He has just learned that he has\r\nbeen sold; that he is to be carried down the river. His wife suggests that\r\nas he has a pass from his master permitting him to go and return as he\r\npleases, he take advantage of it and run away to the free States. As\r\nfirmly as Socrates, unjustly condemned to death, refused to escape from\r\nprison when his friends had provided full opportunity, Tom declared he\r\nwould stay, that he would keep faith with his master. He said that,\r\naccording to Eliza's report of the conversation she had overheard, his\r\nmaster was forced to sell him, or sell all the other slaves, and it was\r\nbetter for himself to suffer in their place. And as he goes away he has\r\nnothing but prayers and blessings for the man who sends him into dread\r\nexile from his wife and children. He falls to a new master, whom, and his\r\nfamily, he watches over with the fidelity and love of a most kind father,\r\ndoing every duty, but above all things trying to save that master's soul.\r\nThen his cruel fortune delivers him to the monster Legree. For the first\r\ntime in his life he is treated with disrespect, distrust, and harshness.\r\nYet he forgets his own misery, and finds pleasure in helping and\r\ncomforting his fellow sufferers, striving his utmost to bring them into\r\neternal life. He will not do wrong even at the command of his cruel\r\nmaster, who has him in a dungeon, as it were, into which no ray of justice\r\ncan ever shine. And here he dies from the cruel lash--almost under it. He\r\nfalters some, it is true; but there was no sweat of blood as in\r\nGethsemane, nor exclamation upon the cross, \"My God, my God, why hast thou\r\nforsaken me!\" He went more triumphantly through his more fell crucifixion.\r\n\r\nI believe that the character of Uncle Tom is the only part of the book\r\nwhich future generations will cherish; not for the lesson against slavery\r\nit was intended to teach, but because it excels in ideal and realization\r\nall imitation of Christ in actual life or the loftiest religious fiction.\r\nConsider its marvellous effect upon Heine, as told by a quotation from the\r\nlatter in The Author's Introduction to the book.[94]\r\n\r\nThe detailed comparison which I have just made puts Uncle Tom upon a\r\npinnacle, where he is above all the saints in lofty, self-abnegating, and\r\nlovingly religious manhood; and the reader notes how fruitlessly I have\r\ntried to find another like him. But Mrs. Stowe was confident that she had\r\nnot exaggerated or overdrawn him, and further that such were common among\r\nthe southern slaves. Here is what she deliberately says in her Key:\r\n\r\n    \"The character of Uncle Tom has been objected to as improbable; and\r\n    yet the writer has received more confirmations of that character, and\r\n    from a greater variety of sources, than of any other in the book.\r\n\r\n    Many people have said to her, 'I knew an Uncle Tom in such and such a\r\n    southern State.' All the histories of this kind which have thus been\r\n    related to her would of themselves, if collected, make a small\r\n    volume.\"[95]\r\n\r\nToombs once said to me, \"It would have been a matchless eulogy of slavery\r\nif it had produced an Uncle Tom.\" But, as we see from the last quotation,\r\nshe claims far more. She really claims that it was fruitful of Uncle Toms\r\nin every southern State.\r\n\r\nShall we attribute this firm belief, that there were among the southern\r\nslaves many who were better christians than Christ himself is represented\r\nto have been, to a mere hallucination? That word is not strong enough. To\r\nexplain the belief, we must think of visions suggested by the hypnotizing\r\npowers, or something like the spell on Titania, when Bottom with his ass's\r\nhead inspired her with the fondest admiration and love.\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing is far from being exhaustive, it is enough; it\r\nshows incontrovertibly that Mrs. Stowe builded throughout upon the\r\nexceptional and imaginary. My father, a Presbyterian clergyman, with the\r\nstrictest notions as to the Sabbath, as he generally called Sunday, made\r\nme read, when a boy, a book called, if I recollect aright, \"Edwards's\r\nSabbath Manual.\" Be the title whatever it may, the entire book was but a\r\ncollection of instances of secular work done on Sunday, and always\r\nfollowed closely by disaster, which appeared to be divine punishment of\r\nsabbath-breaking. The author was confident he had proved his case. He\r\nbelieved with his whole soul that if one should do on Sunday any week-day\r\nwork not permitted in the catechism, it was more than probable that God\r\nwould at once deal severely with him for not keeping his day holy.\r\n\r\nThis is a somewhat overstrained example of Mrs. Stowe's method. I will\r\ntherefore give one which is as close as close can be. Suppose a diligent\r\nworker to cull from newspaper files, law reports, and what he hears in\r\ntalk, the cases in which one party to a marriage has cruelly mistreated\r\nthe other. If he digested his collection with a view to effect, it would\r\nprove a far more formidable attack upon the most civilizing and improving\r\nof all human institutions than Mrs. Stowe's Key is upon slavery; and if he\r\nhad her rare artistic gift he could found upon it a wonderful\r\nanti-marriage romance. The author of such a Key and romance would be\r\nconfuted at once by the exclamation, \"If these horrors are general, people\r\nwould flee marriage as they do the plague.\" Let it be inquired, \"If 'Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin' and Mrs. Stowe's Key truly represent, why did not more of the\r\nblacks escape into the free States? and why did they not revolt in large\r\nbodies during the war in the many communities whence all the able-bodied\r\nwhites had gone to the front far away?\" and there can be but one answer,\r\nwhich is, there was no general or common oppression of the African in\r\nslavery--there were no horrors to him in the condition--but on the\r\ncontrary he was contented and happy, merry as the day is long.\r\n\r\nHow was it that a book so full of untrue statement and gross exaggeration\r\nas to an American theme found such wide acceptance at the north and\r\nelsewhere out of the south? For years I could not explain. When I read it\r\nat Princeton, I talked it over with the southern students. We pooh-poohed\r\nthe negroes, but we admired the principal white characters except Mrs. St.\r\nClaire, whom we all regarded as a libellous caricature. The representation\r\nof slavery was incorrect, and the portrayal of the negro as only a black\r\nand kinky-haired white was so absurd that one of us dreamed that either\r\nwould be taken seriously by the north. It was some ten years after the\r\nbrothers' war that the true explanation commenced to dawn upon me, and it\r\nhas at last become clear.\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact that the great body of the people of the north\r\nknew almost next to nothing of the south, and especially of the average\r\nnegro. As one calmly looks back now he sees that in the agitation over the\r\nadmission of California, the cleavage between the two nationalizations\r\ntreated in foregoing chapters was becoming decided, and that the people\r\nbelonging to each were losing their tempers and getting ready to fight.\r\nWhen even a political campaign in which the only question is, who shall be\r\nins and who outs, is on, each party is prone to believe the hardest things\r\nof the other. But when such a fell resort to force as that of 1850 and the\r\nyears immediately following is impending, all history shows that those on\r\none side will believe any charge reflecting upon the good character of\r\nthose on the other side which is not grossly improbable. Such quarrels are\r\nso fierce that we never weigh accusations against our adversaries--we just\r\nembrace and circulate. Thus had the northern public become ripe for an\r\narraignment of the morality of slavery, which--as was with purblind\r\ninstinct felt, not discerned--was the sole active principle of the\r\nsouthern nationalization. Even without the provocation just mentioned, a\r\nnorthern man would liken the African in everything but his skin and hair\r\nto a white. We always classify a new under some old and well-known object.\r\nWhen the Romans first saw the elephant they thought of him as the Lucanian\r\nox. The automobile which propels itself around our streets is made as much\r\nlike the corresponding horse-drawn vehicle familiar to the public for ages\r\nas can be. The northerner knew no man well but the Caucasian, and he had\r\nlong been led by a common psychological process to give his characteristic\r\nessentials to the negro. And now when anti-slavery partisans positively\r\nmaintained that the latter was a white in all but his outside, adducing\r\nseeming proofs, and the free-labor nationalization was with its leading\r\nstrings pulling all the northern people into line, even the calmest and\r\nmost dispassionate among them were influenced to believe that the negroes\r\nwere so much like our Anglo-Saxon selves it was an unspeakable crime to\r\nkeep them in slavery. And all tales of cruelty and horror found easy\r\ncredence.\r\n\r\nThus had the northern public been made ready for \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" And\r\nalthough the book wholly ignored and obscured the really live and burning\r\nissue, and it was packed from beginning to end with the most gigantic\r\nerrors of fact, it took the section by storm.\r\n\r\nIt is a great book. When something has been as persistently demanded as\r\nlong as \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has been by the northern public and the\r\n\"Conquered Banner\" by the southern public; when thousands upon thousands\r\nof plain people weep over them and lay them away to weep over them again,\r\nyou may know--it matters not what the unruffled and sarcastic critic may\r\nsay--that each is a work of the very highest and the very rarest genius.\r\nTears of sympathy for tales of distress and misery, whoever can set their\r\nfountain flowing is always a nature's king or queen.\r\n\r\nI have read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" four times: first at Princeton in 1852;\r\nthe second time amid the gloom of reconstruction, more accurately to\r\nascertain northern opinion of the negro and forecast therefrom, if I\r\ncould, what was in store for the south; the third time as I was meditating\r\nthe Old and New South; and just the other day the last time. The more\r\nfamiliar I become with it the greater seems to me the power with which the\r\nattention is taken and held captive. The very titles to the first twelve\r\nchapters are, in their contents and sequence, gems of genius, and draw\r\nresistlessly. I become more and more impatient with Ruskin's reprehending\r\nthe escape of Eliza, when, with her child hugged to her bosom, she leaps\r\nfrom block to block of floating ice in the Ohio until she is safe on the\r\nother side--a marvel like the ghost's appearance in the first scene of\r\nHamlet, exciting a high and breathless interest at the outset, which is\r\nnever allowed to flag afterwards. Whenever I begin to read the book, I\r\nfall at once into that illusion which Coleridge has so well explained. I\r\naccept all her blunders and mistakes as real facts, and although it is\r\nhard to tolerate her negro travesties and the anti-slavery sentiments of\r\nher southern whites, somehow they do not then offend me, and there is\r\nchapter after chapter in which I follow the action with breathless\r\ninterest. \"Gulliver's Travels\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\" are examples to\r\nshow how little of reality either entertaining or moving fiction needs.\r\nFrom a mass of false assumptions, seasoned with the merest sprinkling of\r\nfact; and especially from her taking for granted that the negro is really\r\non a par of development with the white, she has constructed the Iliad of\r\nour time. The nursery tale out of which Shakspeare fashioned the drama of\r\nLear did not furnish him with smaller resources. What a wonderful action\r\nhe puts in the place of the nursery tale! how natural and probable it all\r\nappears to us as it unfolds! how we hate, or pity, or admire, or love as\r\nwe cannot keep from following it! Likewise every reader in the north\r\naccepted Mrs. Stowe's novel as the very height of verity, and afterwards\r\nsaw in every fugitive slave a George Harris, or Eliza, or an Uncle Tom.\r\nAnd the book evoked the same effect out of America. The most curious proof\r\nof this that I can think of is the statue of The Freed Slave, which I saw\r\non exhibition at the Centennial. It has nearly all the peculiar physical\r\ncharacteristics of the Caucasian; and it represents not a typical man of\r\nAfrican descent, but a negro albino, that is, a white negro, not a black\r\none. There are albino negroes, but there are also albino whites. That\r\nstatue shows what was European conception of the negroes whose chains were\r\nbroken by the emancipation proclamation. Its reception in America shows\r\nalso that the same conception prevailed here. Day after day I saw crowds\r\nof northern people contemplating that counterfeit with deep emotion, many\r\nof the women unable to restrain their tears.\r\n\r\nSurely \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in its propagandic potency is unrivalled. It\r\ndid more than the anti-slavery statesmen, politicians, preachers, talkers,\r\nand orators combined. To it more than to all other agencies is due that\r\nthe people of the north took such a stubborn stand in opposition that the\r\nsouth at last saw that the fugitive slave law had been practically\r\nnullified. Thus the fates worked to bring about secession. For secession\r\nwas to bring the brothers' war; and this war was to do what could not be\r\ndone by law or consent,--that is, to get rid of slavery as the informing\r\nprinciple of southern nationalization.\r\n\r\nThe post-bellum propagandic effect of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has been very\r\nmalign. With the companion literature and theories, it formed the opinion\r\nthat devised and executed the reconstruction of the southern States. The\r\ncardinal principle of that reconstruction was to treat the blacks just\r\nemancipated as political equals of the whites.\r\n\r\nThose who did this are to be forgiven. They had been made to believe that\r\nthe negroes of the south were as well qualified for full citizenship as\r\nthe whites, and it was but meet retributive punishment of the great crime\r\nof slavery and waging war to hold on to it, that the masters be put under\r\ntheir former slaves. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" had made them believe it.\r\n\r\nThe only parallel of mass of pernicious error engendered by a book, so far\r\nas I know, is \"Burke's Reflections.\" Constitutional England ought to have\r\nfollowed Charles Fox as one man, and given countenance to the rise in\r\nFrance for liberty. But Burke's piece of magnificent rhetoric effectually\r\nturned the nation out of her course, and had her in league with\r\nabsolutists to put back the clock of European democracy a hundred years or\r\nmore. Even yet intelligent Englishmen magnify that most unEnglish\r\nachievement. The bad effects of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" have not been so\r\nlasting in our country. We Americans get out of ruts much more easily than\r\nthe English. The north is now rapidly learning the real truth as to the\r\nutter incapacity of the mass of southern negroes to vote intelligently,\r\nand complacently acquiesces in their practical disfranchisement by the\r\nonly class which can give good government.\r\n\r\nWe must utterly reject and discard everything that Mrs. Stowe and those\r\nwhom I distinguish as the root-and-branch abolitionists have taught, in\r\ntheir unutterable ideology, as to the nature and character of the negro,\r\nand in its place we must learn to know him as he really is--to tolerate\r\nhim, nay, to love him as such. This is the only way in which we can\r\nprepare ourselves for giving the negroes their due from us.\r\n\r\nFurther, we owe it to our proud American history, now that the brothers'\r\nwar is forty years past, to ascertain the real cause of that mighty\r\nstruggle, maintained most laudably and gloriously by each side. Those whom\r\nI am here criticising made many believe that the real stake was whether\r\nthe slave should remain the property of his master or not. Note the\r\nemphasized adjuration in the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic:\"\r\n\r\n  \"As he [Christ] died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.\"\r\n\r\nA most beautiful sentiment, fitly expressed; but how it humiliates the\r\ngrand issue, which was whether federal government should live or perish!\r\nAnd that greatest of American odes, Whittier's \"Laus Deo,\" how wide of the\r\ntrue mark is its sublime rejoicing! Celebrating the abolition of slavery\r\nby constitutional amendment, the occasion demanded that he extol the\r\nreally benign achievement. That achievement was that all cause of diverse\r\nnationalization in the States had been forever removed, and thus it was\r\nassured that brotherhood of the nations was to grow without check. But the\r\nrapt bard was blinded, as his utterances show, by what now almost appears\r\nto have been a fit of delusional insanity. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"Ring! O bells!\r\n  Every stroke exulting tells\r\n  Of the burial hour of crime.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does he mean is the crime? Why, the delivering of certain Africans\r\nand their descendants from lowest human degradation and misery, and\r\nblessing them with opportunity and help to rise far upward? Had he seen,\r\nas we do now, forty years later, instead of pouring out this wild and mad\r\ndelight, he would have dropped scalding tears over the \"burial hour\" of\r\nall that promised anything of welfare to those for whom he had labored so\r\nlong and faithfully. And in the last stanza his command that\r\n\r\n  \"With a sound of broken chains\"\r\n\r\nthe nations be told\r\n\r\n                \"that He reigns,\r\n  Who alone is Lord and God!\"\r\n\r\nThe poet misunderstood the \"broken chains\" as greatly as he did the\r\n\"burial hour.\" Chains were broken, but their breaking was no blessing to\r\nthe negro. Golden chains of domestic ties, drawing him gently, kindly,\r\nsurely up to higher morality and complete manhood--these were broken; and\r\nfar other were forged for him, with which fear he has been made fast to\r\ndestruction. His only friends able to help alienated; what a clog! Given\r\nback to African improgressiveness; what a fetter! How he is held to the\r\nbody of death by unbreakable chains of want, misery, vice, disease, and\r\nutter helplessness! and how his shackles gall him and his convict chains\r\nclank in every corner of the land which was once an earthly paradise to\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nLet us not sully with Whittier the glory of the federal arms by ascribing\r\nto them as their chief triumph the gift of illusory freedom to a few\r\nnegroes. Rather let us inform ourselves with the spirit of Webster, and\r\ngive praise and thanks without end for the actual blessings and the richer\r\npromise of the restored union to myriads of that race whose mission it is\r\nto spread an inexpressibly fair socialism over all the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say at the last, the people of the north should learn that all\r\nthe tragic evils which Professor Wendell and others outside of the south\r\nhave in mind belong only to the slave-ships, and by a strange\r\npsychological metastasis--no stranger, however, than that by which the\r\nfourth commandment, in popular conception, has been abrogated as to the\r\nseventh day, and applied to the first day of the week--they have firmly\r\nattached themselves to the reputation of southern slavery. For long years\r\nwe of the south, our mothers and our mothers' mothers, our fathers and our\r\nfathers' fathers, have been charged with cruelties and outrages purely\r\nfancied. These fabrications are the stock comparisons with which almost\r\nevery invective against the wrongs of any lower class is sharpened. The\r\nwriter or speaker whenever he is taken short says something of the\r\ndreadful condition of the southern slave under the sway of an entirely\r\nabsolute master. Variety of the misdeeds invoked as illustration is\r\nlimited only by the promptness with which the utterer can think of what he\r\nhas read in abolition literature or its sequel. It is all mere parrot\r\ngabble. To hear so much of it as we do is \"a little wearing,\" as Reginald\r\nWilfer said. Surely if our brothers and sisters of the north but think,\r\nthey will acknowledge that these so-called horrors of slavery were all\r\nnothing but the inventions of the angry passions provoked by the powers in\r\nthe unseen after they had decided that slavery must be sacrificed in the\r\ninterests of the union. And these dear brothers and sisters will no longer\r\npersist in asserting that southern slavery was but robbery and oppression\r\nof and cruelty to the slave; that the system was evil to him of itself.\r\nThey will talk no more of the pro-slavery infamy, of the unscrupulousness\r\nand perfidy of the slave power, and all such false twaddle, that can now\r\nserve no purpose whatever except to offend good men and women and their\r\nchildren without cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSLAVERY AT LAST IMPELLED INTO A DEFENSIVE AGGRESSIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the crisis of 1850, slavery had never changed from purely defensive\r\ntactics. This year made it seem that the north had fully resolved that\r\nslavery should never be allowed another inch of new territory; and also\r\nwas very near, and was rapidly coming nearer to, the point of practically\r\npreventing the enforcement of the fugitive slave law. We have explained\r\nhow slave property could not live unless it found new virgin soil in the\r\nTerritories; and we have also explained what a deadly blow it would\r\nreceive, in the refusal to restore fugitives. This refusal would be really\r\nindirect abolition. Read the masterly sketch by Calhoun, in his speech\r\nMarch 4, 1850, of the conquering advance of the anti-slavery party, until\r\nnow--to use his language--\"the equilibrium between the two sections ...\r\nhad been destroyed;\" and he demonstrates that the actual exercise of the\r\nentire national political power must soon be in the hands of the\r\nfree-labor section. The south instinctively felt that the time for her old\r\ntactics was over, and that she must do more than merely fend off the blows\r\nof abolition. And, as we will tell in the next chapter, she found her new\r\nleader in Toombs. Nullification as advocated by Calhoun was the extreme\r\nenergy of the pure defensive of the south. His proposed dual executive\r\namendment was merely that nullification be made a right granted to the\r\nfederal government instead of remaining one reserved to the States.\r\nToombs had grown up in the school of William H. Crawford. George R.\r\nGilmer, a follower of Crawford, tells of the latter: \"He was violently\r\nopposed to the nullification movement, considering it but an ebullition\r\nexcited by Mr. Calhoun's overleaping, ambition.\"[96]\r\n\r\nToombs scouted nullification. Under his lead his State, in 1850, adopted\r\nthe Georgia Platform quoted above. This platform was considerate and\r\nresolute preparation for the southern offensive.\r\n\r\nNext the south assumes initiative. Extension of slave-territory is so\r\ngreat an economical _sine qua non_ that she attacks its barriers. Using\r\nher control of the then dominant democratic party she got the Missouri\r\ncompromise repealed. Her main purpose in this was to wrench from the\r\nanti-slavery men the weapon of congressional restriction, then deemed by\r\nthem the most powerful of all in their armory. She also contemplated\r\nextorting a concession of all lands in the Territories which could be\r\nprofitably cultivated by slaves from the north, alarmed into apprehending\r\nthat otherwise slavery might be carried above 36.30'.\r\n\r\nThis repeal did more than anything else--more even than \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin\"--to arouse the north into mortal combat with slavery. The historian\r\ncannot understand why the south procured it, if he ignores that energy of\r\nsouthern nationalization which we have done our utmost to explain. This\r\nnationalization had got into what we may call the last rapids, and was\r\nbound to go over the precipice into the gulf of secession.\r\n\r\nThe bootless struggle by the south against overwhelming odds of northern\r\nsettlers to make Kansas a slave State was the sequel to the repeal of the\r\nMissouri compromise. When the South understood that Kansas was really\r\ngone, she advanced her forlorn hope in her endeavor to secure slavery in\r\nthe union. The essence of the compromise measures of 1850 was that the\r\ndemand of congressional non-interference with slavery in the States and\r\nTerritories, made by the south, was declared adopted as future policy. As\r\nthe forlorn hope just mentioned she now made the demand that the owner's\r\nproperty in his slaves, if he should carry them into a Territory, should\r\nbe protected by congress until its people had made the constitution under\r\nwhich the Territory would be admitted into the union. Her adherence to\r\nthis demand split the democratic party; and the election of Lincoln\r\nensued. This election meant that slavery--the property supporting more\r\nthan nine-tenths of the southern people, and which was virtually their\r\nentire economic system--was put under a ban. There was nothing for it but\r\ndepreciation in the near future; soon more and more depreciation; until\r\nafter prolonged stagnation and paralysis the value of all her property\r\nwould collapse as did that of the continental currency. That was the way\r\nit looked to her. We believe that the facts show that her conviction was\r\nright. She felt with her whole soul that the time had come to invoke State\r\nsovereignty. So she seceded, with intent to save the property of her\r\npeople and maintain their domestic peace. Of course she purposed an\r\nequitable apportionment of the public domain between herself and the north\r\nunder which she would get the small part that suited slave agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances constrained the south throughout every part and parcel\r\nof her offensive as powerfully as exhaustion of his supplies constrains\r\nthe commander of a garrison to a sortie upon what he has reason to believe\r\nis the weakest point of the circumvallation. She was hypnotized by the\r\npowers. They made her believe that she was always doing the right thing\r\nto protect slavery when they were having her to do that only which assured\r\nits destruction. She was all the while as conscientious as the mother who,\r\nafraid of drafts, keeps the needed fresh air from her consumptive child\r\nand thereby kills him.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the resistless play of the cosmic forces upon the sun, moon,\r\nand stars; upon our earth; in the yearly round of the seasons; in the\r\nocean tides; in storms and heated terms; in vegetation; and in things\r\ninnumerable taken note of by the senses. But this is not all of their\r\nempire. They sway individuals, communities, peoples, nations, making the\r\nlatter even believe that they are having their own way when in fact they\r\nare most servilely doing the will of the powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTOOMBS\r\n\r\n\r\nCalhoun solidified the south in resolve to leave the union if the\r\nabolition party got control of the federal government. Just before his\r\ndeath there commenced such serious contemplation of an aggressive defence\r\nof slavery that we may call it an actual aggressive. Although by reason of\r\nhis unquestioned primacy he could have assumed the conduct of this\r\naggressive, he did not. Toombs was its real, though not always apparent,\r\nleader, from its actual commencement until it resulted in secession. Thus\r\nhe played an independent part of his own, and deserves a chapter to\r\nhimself. While Calhoun was the forerunner, Toombs was both apostle and the\r\nMoses of secession. As nearly all of my readers have never thought of any\r\none else than Calhoun in this capacity, the statement of Toombs's\r\nprominence just made will probably startle them. But I know if they will\r\nfollow me through the record they will all at last agree with me. In view\r\nof Calhoun's conspicuousness in the southern agitation from 1835 until his\r\ndeath in 1850, this misapprehension of my readers is very natural.\r\nContemporaries following Sulla, named Pompey, not Julius Caesar, The Great.\r\nSimilarly Toombs, as an actor in the intersectional arena, is as yet\r\ndwarfed from comparison with the really great but not greater Calhoun.\r\n\r\nIt is much more necessary than I saw such a method was with Calhoun to\r\ndeal first with what we may call the non-sectional parts of Toombs's\r\ncareer. And I wish to assure my readers at the outset that these parts\r\nare exceptionally important and valuable not only to every American, but\r\nto all those anywhere who prize shining examples of private virtue and\r\nexalted teachers of good and honest government.\r\n\r\nI was nearly ten years old when Toombs's congressional career commenced in\r\nDecember, 1845. Living only eighteen miles from him I heard him often\r\nmentioned. It was the delight of many people to report his phrases and\r\nrepartees. By reason of their wisdom or wit and fineness of expression,\r\nthe whole of each one lodged in the dullest memory. I never knew another\r\nwhose sayings circulated so widely and far without alteration. As they\r\nserve to introduce you to his rare originality, I will tell here a few of\r\nthem that I heard admired and laughed at in my boyhood.\r\n\r\nHe had not then left off tobacco, but he chewed it incessantly, and a\r\nspray of the juice fell around him when he was speaking. Once while he was\r\nharanguing at the hustings, a drunken man beneath the edge of the platform\r\non which he was standing, rudely told him in a loud voice not to let his\r\npot boil over. Toombs, looking down, saw that his interrupter had flaming\r\nred hair: \"Take your fire from under it, then,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nIn another stump speech he was earnestly denying that he had ever used\r\ncertain words now charged against him. A stalwart, rough fellow--one of\r\nChoate's bulldogs with confused ideas--rose, and asserted he had heard him\r\nsay them. When and where was asked. The man gave time and place, and added\r\ntauntingly, \"What do you say to that?\" Toombs rejoined, \"Well, I must have\r\ntold a d--d lie.\"\r\n\r\nA rival candidate, really conspicuous and celebrated for his little\r\nability, in a stump debate pledged the people that if they would send him\r\nto congress he would never leave his post during a session to attend the\r\ncourts, as he unjustifiably charged Toombs with habitually doing. The\r\nlatter disposed of this by merely saying, \"You should consider which will\r\nhurt the district the more, his constant presence in, or my occasional\r\nabsence from, the house.\"\r\n\r\nIn another discussion this same opponent charged him with having voted so\r\nand so. Replying, Toombs denied it. The other interrupted him, and\r\nsustained his charge by producing the _Globe_; and he expressively\r\nexclaimed, \"What do you think of that vote?\" Toombs answered without any\r\nhesitation--nothing ever confused him--\"I think it a d--d bad vote. There\r\nare more than a hundred votes of mine reported in that big book. He has\r\nevidently studied them all, and this is the only bad one he can find. Send\r\n_him_ to congress in my place, the record will be exactly inverted; it\r\nwill be as hard to find a good one in his votes as it is now to find a bad\r\none in mine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the congressional session of 1849-50 Toombs had made his Hamilcar\r\nspeech, to be told of fully after a while. In this he avowed his\r\npreference of disunion to exclusion of the south from the Territories so\r\npositively and strongly that the ultra southern rights men hailed him as\r\ntheir champion. But soon afterwards, with the great majority of the people\r\nof the State, he took his stand upon the compromise of 1850 and the\r\nGeorgia Platform quoted above. This was really on his part a recession\r\nfrom the extreme ground he had taken in the speech. In 1851, a coalition\r\nof the whigs and democrats of Georgia nominated Howell Cobb, a democrat,\r\nfor governor, and Toombs, then a whig, canvassed for him with great zeal.\r\nHe had an appointment to speak, in Oglethorpe county, at Lexington, the\r\ncounty seat. There were quite a number of ardent southern rights men in\r\nthe county, who held that the admission of California, really in southern\r\nlatitude, with its anti-slavery constitution, called for far more decided\r\naction on the part of the south than was counselled in the Compromise and\r\nGeorgia Platform. Hating Toombs, whom they regarded as a renegade, they\r\nplotted to humiliate him when he came to Lexington. As he never shrank\r\nfrom discussion they easily got his consent to divide time with--as the\r\nphrase goes--a canvasser for McDonald, their candidate for governor.\r\nToombs was to consume a stated time in opening the stump debate; then the\r\nother was to be allowed a stated time; after which Toombs had a reply of\r\ntwenty minutes--these were the terms. In opening, Toombs, as was natural,\r\nstressed the compromise measures and set forth the advantages of\r\npreserving the union; and he fiercely inveighed against the men who could\r\nnot be satisfied with the Georgia Platform, embraced as it had been by a\r\ngreat majority of all parties, denouncing them as disunionists. The other\r\ndisputant took the Hamilcar speech of Toombs, made just the year before,\r\nas his text. Deliberately, accurately, systematically he unfolded the\r\ndoctrine of that speech, and he did the same for the speech just made, and\r\ncontrasting the two, he put them into glaring inconsistency. Southern\r\nrights stock rose and union stock sunk rapidly as the comparison went on.\r\nIn his peroration the speaker commented upon Toombs's tergiversation with\r\nsuch effective severity it elicited wild applause from the men of his\r\nside. They had pushed themselves to the front. Toombs rose to reply. In\r\ntheir riotous rejoicing over the great hit of their speaker, they forgot\r\nthe proprieties of the occasion; forgot that it was Toombs's meeting, as\r\nwas said in common parlance; and they rapped on the floor with canes, and\r\neven clubs provided for the nonce, howled, and made all kinds of noises\r\nto drown his voice. Unabashed he looked upon them, smiling that grandest\r\nand blandest of smiles. As the foremost of these roysterers told me long\r\nafterwards, his self-possession excited their curiosity. They wanted to\r\nhear if he could say anything to get out of the trap in which they had so\r\ncleverly caught him; and they became still. \"It seems to me,\" he\r\ncommenced, \"that men like you meditating a great revolution ought first to\r\nlearn good manners.\" At this condign rebuke of behavior which, according\r\nto stump usage, was as uncivil and impolite as if it had been shown Toombs\r\nin his own house by guests accepting his hospitality, spontaneous cheers\r\nfrom the union men, who were in very large majority, appeared to raise the\r\nroof. In his highest and readiest style--for mob opposition always lifted\r\nhim at once into that--he reminded his hearers that their whole duty was\r\nto decide whether they would approve the compromise and the Georgia\r\nPlatform or not; and that to discuss whether what he had spoken last year\r\nbefore these measures were even thought of, was right or wrong, was to\r\nsubstitute for a transcendently important public question a little\r\npersonal one of no concern to them whatever. \"If there is anything in my\r\nHamilcar speech that cannot be reconciled with the measures which I have\r\nsupported here to-day with reasons which my opponent confesses by his\r\nsilence he cannot answer, I repudiate it. If the gentleman takes up my\r\nabandoned errors, let him defend them.\"\r\n\r\nHow the union men cheered as he broke out of the trap, and caught the\r\nsetters in it!\r\n\r\nI heard much of this day, still famous in all the locality, when six years\r\nafterwards I settled in Lexington, to begin law practice. Over and over\r\nagain the Union men told how their spirits fell, fell, fell as the\r\nsouthern rights speaker kept on, until it looked black and dark around;\r\nand then how the sun broke out in full splendor at the first sentence of\r\nToombs's reply, and the brightness mounted steadily to the end. That\r\nsentence last quoted is a proverb in that region yet. If in a dispute with\r\nanybody there you try to put him down by quoting his former contradictory\r\nutterances, he tells you that if you take up his abandoned errors you must\r\ndefend them.\r\n\r\nThe interest excited in me by what is told in the foregoing was the\r\nbeginning of my study of Toombs, which never at any time entirely ceased,\r\nand which will doubtless continue as long as I live. He has impressed me\r\nfar more than any other man whom I ever knew. Soon after his return, in\r\n1867, from his exile I resolved I would try to write his Life under the\r\ntitle, \"Robert Toombs, as a Lawyer, Statesman, and Talker;\" and for ten or\r\nfifteen years I had been systematically collecting the data. These had\r\naccumulated under each head--especially reports of his epigrams and winged\r\nphrases--far more considerably than was my expectation at first. I added\r\nto them very largely by copious notes of the record of his congressional\r\nlife which I read attentively in course, commencing immediately after his\r\ndeath. In a few years I had finished my task. As yet I have not found the\r\ntimes favorable for publication, and the MS. may perplex my literary\r\nexecutor. Of course my object in the too egotistic narrative just made is\r\nto inform you that I have bestowed very great labor and study upon the\r\nsubject, hoping thus to draw your attention.\r\n\r\nRobert Toombs was born July 2, 1810, on his father's plantation in Wilkes\r\ncounty, Georgia. He went to school at Washington, the county seat; then to\r\nthe State university; which having left, he finished his collegiate course\r\nat Union. Next he spent a year at the law school of Virginia university.\r\nHe never was a bookworm. His habitual quotations during the last fifteen\r\nyears of his life--when I was much with him--betrayed a smattering of the\r\nRoman authors commonly read at school, a much greater knowledge of the\r\nLatin quoted by Blackstone and that of the current law maxims, and\r\nconsiderable familiarity with \"Paradise Lost,\" \"Macbeth,\" and the Falstaff\r\nparts of \"King Henry IV.,\" and \"Merry Wives,\" Don Quixote, Burns, and the\r\nbible. But this man, whose diction and phrases were the worship of the\r\nstreet and the despair of the cultured, had no deep acquaintance with any\r\nliterature. Erskine got the staple of his English from a long and fond\r\nstudy of Shakspeare and Milton; but Toombs must have drawn his only from\r\nthe fountains whence Tom, Dick, Harry, and Mariah get theirs, and then\r\npurified and refined it by a secret process that nobody else knew of,--not\r\neven himself, as I believe. If he had only corrected after utterance as\r\nassiduously as Erskine did, of the two his diction would be much the\r\nfiner.\r\n\r\nThe year before he came of age he was admitted to the bar by legislative\r\nact. In the same year he married his true mate and settled at Washington.\r\nFor four years the famous William H. Crawford was the judge of the\r\ncircuit. Toombs was born into the Crawford faction, and the judge who, as\r\nthere was no supreme court then, was law autocrat of his circuit, gave him\r\nfavor from the first. The courts were full of lucrative business. The old\r\ndockets show that in five years Toombs was getting his full share in his\r\nown county and the adjoining ones. The diligent attention that he gave\r\nevery detail of preparation of his cases, had, in a year or two after his\r\ncall, made him first choice of every eminent lawyer for junior. One of\r\nthese was Cone, a native of Connecticut, who had received a good education\r\nboth literary and professional, before he came south. Toombs, who had\r\nknown the great American lawyers of his time, always said after his death\r\nin 1859 that Cone was the best of all. Lumpkin used to tell that during a\r\nvisit to England he haunted the courts, but he never found a single\r\ncounsel who spoke to a law point as luminously and convincingly as Cone.\r\nAnother one of these was Lumpkin. He is, I believe, the most eloquent man\r\nthat Georgia ever produced. He had some tincture of letters; but he was\r\nwithout Choate's pre-eminent self-culture and daily drafts of inspiration\r\nfrom the immortal fountains. A. H. Stephens admired Choate greatly. He\r\nheard the latter's reply to Buchanan. Often, at Liberty Hall--as Stephens\r\ncalled his residence--he would repeat with gusto the passage in which\r\nChoate roasts Buchanan for his inculcation of hate to England. Stephens\r\ncontended that if all that education and art had done for each--Choate and\r\nLumpkin--could have been removed, a comparison would, as he believed, show\r\nLumpkin to be the stronger advocate by nature.\r\n\r\nThese three--Cone, Lumpkin, and Toombs--were often on the same side. But\r\nwhether Toombs had them as associates or as adversaries, they were always\r\nin these early years of his at the bar, in his eye. With the unremitted\r\nattentiveness of what we may call his subconscious observation, and a\r\nreceptivity always active and greedy, he seems to have soon appropriated\r\nall of Cone's law and all of Lumpkin's advocacy--that is, he had, as he\r\ndid with the speech and language heard by him every day, transmuted them\r\ninto the rare and precious staple peculiar to his own _sui generis_ self.\r\n\r\nIn his first forensic arguments his rapid utterance was as indistinct as\r\nif he had mush in his mouth, old men have told me. But after a year or two\r\nof practice he developed both power and attractiveness. In due time when\r\nCone or Lumpkin were with him, he would be pushed forward, young as he\r\nwas, into some important place in court conduct. I myself heard Lumpkin\r\ntell that the greatest forensic eloquence he had ever heard was a rebuke\r\nby Toombs--then some twenty-seven years old--of the zeal with which the\r\npublic urged on the prosecution of one of their clients on trial for\r\nmurder. The junior--the evidence closed--was making the first speech for\r\nthe defence. As he went on in a strong argument, the positiveness with\r\nwhich he denied all merit to the case for the State, angered the\r\nspectators outside of the bar, and a palpable demonstration of dissent\r\ncame from some of them, which the presiding judge did not check as he\r\nought to have done. Toombs strode at once to the edge of the bar, only a\r\nrailing some four feet high separating him from these angry men, and\r\nchastised them as they merited. His invective culminated in denouncing\r\nthem as bloodhounds eager to slake their accursed thirst in innocent\r\nblood. These misguided ones were brought back to proper behavior, and with\r\nthem admiration of the fearless and eloquent advocate displaced their\r\nhostility, and carried upon an invisible wave an influence in favor of the\r\naccused over the entire community, and even into the jury box. And the\r\nnarrator, who was one of Toombs's greatest admirers, told with fond\r\nrecollection how the popular billows were laid by the speech of his\r\njunior, and how he himself took heart and found the way to an acquittal\r\nwhich he feared he had lost.\r\n\r\nThis affair is illustrative of Toombs in two respects. In the first place\r\nit shows his extempore faculty and presence of mind. I have seen him so\r\noften in sudden emergencies do exactly the thing that subsequent\r\nreflection pronounced the best, that I believe had he been in Napoleon's\r\nplace when the Red Sea tide suddenly spread around, he would have escaped\r\nin the same way, or in a better one. I do not believe that this can be\r\nsaid of any one else of the past or present. In the second place it is one\r\nof the many proofs extant that he could always vanquish the mob.\r\n\r\nHe divined what offered cases are unmaintainable more quickly, and\r\ndeclined them more resolutely than any one I ever knew. So free was he\r\nfrom illusion that he could not contend against plain infeasibility. It\r\nwas impossible for clients, witnesses, or juniors to blind him to the\r\nactual chances. For ten years or more, commencing with 1867, I observed\r\nhim in many _nisi prius_ trials, and I noted how unfrequently, as compared\r\nwith others, he had either got wrong as to his own side or misanticipated\r\nthe other. But now and then it would develop that the merits were\r\ndecidedly against him. He would at once, according to circumstances,\r\npropose a compromise, frankly surrender, or, if it appeared very weak,\r\ntoss the case away as if it was something unclean. When he had thus\r\nfailed, his air of unconcern and majesty reminded of how the lion is said\r\nto stalk back to his place of hiding when the prey has eluded his spring.\r\n\r\nStephens came to the bar some four years after Toombs did, and settled in\r\nan adjoining county. I need merely allude to their long and beautiful\r\nfriendship, full details of which are to be found in the biographies of\r\nthe former. I merely emphasize the importance of Stephens's help to\r\nToombs's development in his early politics. The former got to congress two\r\nyears before he did. Toombs evidently relied greatly upon the sagacity\r\nwith which the other divined how a new question would take with the\r\nmasses. On his return from a brief and bloodless service in the Creek war\r\nas captain of a company of volunteers, Toombs commenced a State\r\nlegislative career, which Mr. Stovall has creditably told.[97] I can stop\r\nonly to say it was honorable, and contributed greatly to his political\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nWhen Toombs was at the Virginia law school, he heard some of Randolph's\r\nstump speeches; and for a few years afterwards he often vouched passages\r\nfrom them as authority. Stephens would tell this; and then with\r\naffectionate mischief tell further that his friend, before he had finished\r\nin the Georgia legislature, had ceased entirely to support his contentions\r\nwith anything else than his own reasons.\r\n\r\nBefore he got to Congress, he had made reputation at the hustings. In 1840\r\nhe crossed the Savannah, and meeting the veteran McDuffie in stump debate\r\nis reported to have come off with the high opinion of all hearers,\r\nincluding his adversary.\r\n\r\nLet us now take an inventory of him as he is about to enter congress. He\r\nis the best lawyer in the State, except Cone, and fully his equal; while\r\nas a speaker he did not have Lumpkin's marvellous suasion of common men,\r\nyet with them he was almost the next, and he was far greater than Lumpkin\r\nin quelling the mob, convincing the honest judge that his law was right,\r\nand convincing also the better men of the jury and citizens present that\r\nthe principles of justice involved in the issue of facts were to be\r\napplied as he claimed; he had acquired enough of property to be considered\r\nrich in that day, although he had always lived liberally; his legislative\r\nand political career had convinced the people that he was incomparably the\r\nbest and ablest man of the district for their representative. It is to be\r\nespecially emphasized that he had practical talent of the highest order.\r\nHis plantation was a model of good management. His investments were always\r\nprudent and lucrative. Practical men of extraordinary ability were bred\r\nby the conditions about him. In the Raytown district of Taliaferro\r\ncounty--about ten miles distant--my maternal grandfather, Joshua Morgan,\r\nlived on his plantation of more than a thousand acres, which he managed\r\nwithout an overseer. His father had been killed by the tories. His\r\neducation had been so scant that he found reading the simplest English\r\ndifficult, and to sign his name was the only writing I ever knew him to\r\ndo. But his plantation management was the admiration of all his neighbors.\r\nHis land was sandy and thin, but he made it yield more than ample support\r\nfor his numerous family, his rapidly increasing force of negroes, his\r\nblooded horses, his unusually large number of hogs, cows, sheep, and\r\ngoats; and a fair quantity of cotton besides. The slaves loved sweet\r\npotatoes more than any other food, and they were a favorite food in the\r\nBig House. His supplies never failed, there being some unopened \"banks or\r\nhills\" when the new potatoes came. His hogs were his special attention.\r\nHis fine horses required so much corn, and so much more of it was needed\r\nfor bread, that he could not feed it lavishly to his hogs. So he developed\r\na succession of peach orchards, with which he commenced their fattening in\r\nthe summer. These were four in all; the first ripened in July and the last\r\nthe fourth week in October. The fruit in any particular one ripened at the\r\nsame time, and he cared not how many different varieties there were.\r\nWhenever he tasted peaches away from home that he liked, if they were not\r\nfrom grafted trees, he would carry away the seed, and there was a\r\nparticular drawer labelled with the date, into which they were put.\r\nWhenever he had need to plant a tree whose fruit was desired at that\r\nparticular time of the year, the seed was planted where he wanted the\r\ntree. Many of his neighbors planted the seeds in a nursery, whence after\r\na year or two they transplanted the young trees; but my grandfather, as he\r\ntold me, saved a year by his method. He was always replanting in place of\r\ninjured trees and those he had found to be inferior. The \"fattening\"\r\nhogs--that is, those to be next killed for meat--were turned into the July\r\norchard just as soon as the peaches commenced to fall; and they went on\r\nthrough the rest of the series. There was running water in each orchard.\r\nAfter peach-time, these hogs ran upon the peas which were now ripe in the\r\ncorn fields, the corn having been gathered. And for some two weeks before\r\nthey were to be killed they were penned and given all the corn they would\r\neat. What pride the good planter of that time took in keeping independent\r\nof the Tennessee hog drover, who was the main resource of his rural\r\nneighbors who did not save their own meat, as the phrase then was!\r\nObserving that his hogs were not safe against roving negroes when away\r\nfrom the house on Sunday, on that day they were kept up. One of my\r\nearliest recollections is that of Old Lige driving them to the spring\r\nbranch twice every Sunday. For a long while he tried in various ways to\r\nprotect his sheep against worrying dogs. At last he had them \"got up\"\r\nevery night in some enclosure he wished to enrich near enough to the Big\r\nHouse for his own dogs to be aware of any invasion by strangers, and he\r\nnever had a sheep worried afterwards. The foregoing is enough to suggest\r\nthe whole of the system. The management of its different trains and many\r\nseparate departments upon an up-to-date railroad was not superior in\r\npunctuality and due discharge of every duty. He lived well, entertained\r\nhospitably, and kept out of debt. Mr. Thomas E. Watson has lately given a\r\ngraphic description of good plantation conduct,[98] which ought to be\r\nconsidered by all those who now believe that every planter was necessarily\r\nslipshod and slovenly in his vocation. It was a good training school for\r\nthe born business man. Let me give an example to show how extensive\r\nplanting bred experts in affairs. The Southern Mutual fire insurance\r\ncompany--its principal office being at Athens, some forty miles distant\r\nfrom Toombs's home--at the beginning of the brothers' war had for some\r\nyears almost driven all other insurers out of its territory. It is still\r\nsuch a favorite therein that it is hardly exaggeration to state that its\r\ncompetitors must content themselves with its leavings. The plan of this\r\ngreat company is a novel form of co-operative insurance--indeed, I may\r\nsay, it is unique. It was invented, developed, and most skilfully worked\r\nforward into a success which is one of the wonders of the insurance world.\r\nThe men who did this were never any of them reputed to be of exceptional\r\ntalents. They had merely grown up in the best rural business circles of\r\nthe old south. A similar fact explains the mastery of money, banking, and\r\nrelated matters which Calhoun acquired in a locality of South Carolina,\r\nnot forty miles distant from Washington, Georgia. It also explains why\r\nToombs, bred in the interior and far away from large cities, had perfectly\r\nacquired the commercial law; had complete knowledge of the principles and\r\npractice of banking, and those of all corporate business, and also a\r\nfamiliarity with the fluctuating values of current securities equalling\r\nthat of experts.\r\n\r\nHe was also, as I know, almost a lightning calculator, and fully\r\nindoctrinated in the science of accounts.\r\n\r\nSurely this man, now thirty-five, is ripe for congress.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12, 1846, the United States house of representatives having under\r\nconsideration a resolution of notice to Great Britain to abrogate the\r\nconvention between her and the United States, of August 6, 1827, relative\r\nto the region commonly called Oregon, Toombs made his congressional debut.\r\n\r\nIt is an able speech for a new member--especially for one grappling with a\r\nquestion peculiar to a part of the country so far away from his own.\r\nConvinced that the adoption of the resolution could give no just cause of\r\noffence, he will not yield anything to those who merely cry up the\r\nblessings of peace. The warlike note is deep and earnest. Then comes the\r\nmost original part of the speech. Showing great familiarity with the facts\r\nand the applicable international law, he does his utmost to prove that the\r\ntitle of each country is bad; and it seems to me that he succeeds. He\r\nurges that the time has arrived when American settlers are ready to pour\r\ninto Oregon. \"Terminate this convention and our settlements will give us\r\ngood title.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I believe that Calhoun's policy, as I have explained it above,\r\nwas the true one, and that we should have continued the convention as to\r\njoint occupancy as long as possible. Toombs was bred among the followers\r\nof Crawford, who regarded Calhoun as his rival for the presidency, and I\r\ndoubt if he ever did neutralize this early influence enough to enable\r\nhimself to do full justice to Calhoun. And as a further palliation, his\r\ncombative temperament must be remembered, and also that he had inherited\r\nfrom a gallant Revolutionary father an extreme readiness to fight England.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1846, he discusses a proposal to reduce import duties in a long\r\nspeech, carefully premeditated as is evident. He shows great familiarity\r\nwith Adam Smith, economical principles, fluctuations in prices of leading\r\ncommodities, and the consequences of affecting legislation. Its main\r\ninterest here is the detailed argument in its concluding passages against\r\nthe expediency of free trade, of which he afterwards became an advocate.\r\n\r\nJanuary 8, 1847, a speech on the proposed increase of the army is his next\r\nconsiderable effort. He denounces the Mexican war as unjust in its origin,\r\nbut he reprehends its feeble conduct. He is very strong, from the southern\r\nstandpoint, in what he says of the Wilmot proviso. Here is a passage\r\ncharacteristic of Toombs later on:\r\n\r\n    \"The gentleman from New York [Grover] asked how the south could\r\n    complain of the proposed proviso accompanying the admission of new\r\n    territory, when the arrangement was so very fair and put the north and\r\n    south on a footing of perfect equality. The north could go there\r\n    without slaves, and so could the south. Well, I will try it the other\r\n    way. Suppose the territory to be open to all; then southerners could\r\n    go and carry slaves with them, and so could northerners. Would not\r\n    this be just as equal? [Much laughter.] I will not answer for the\r\n    strength of the argument, but it is as good as what we of the south\r\n    get. [Laughter.]\"\r\n\r\nWinthrop, who followed, commences by deprecating the necessity that\r\nexposed him to the disadvantage of contrast with a speech which had\r\nattracted so much attention and admiration. And Stephens praised the\r\neffort greatly.[99]\r\n\r\nDecember 21, 1847, Toombs offered a resolution in the house, that neither\r\nthe honor nor interest of the republic demand the dismemberment of Mexico,\r\nnor the annexation of any of her territory as an indispensable condition\r\nto the restoration of peace.\r\n\r\nHis Taylor speech of July 1, 1848, evinces warm whig partisanship.\r\n\r\nIn his first years at the bar he loitered a while as a speaker. And one\r\nwho studies his record in congress discerns that it is some two years\r\nbefore he commences to feel easy as a member of the house. The speeches\r\nwhich I have mentioned above, with the solitary exception of that of\r\nJanuary 8, 1847, are labored communication of cram rather than the\r\npeculiar language of the speaker who, when I commenced to observe him a\r\nfew years later on the stump, had become a marvel both of strong thinking\r\nand fit expression extempore.\r\n\r\nI detect a gleam of the coming man, when August 4, 1848, and February 20,\r\n1849, he exhibits his inveterate hostility to maintaining and increasing\r\nan army in time of peace. Next he begins his lifelong war upon high\r\nsalaries, and the extravagance and waste of congressional printing. Note\r\nwhat he says February 29, 1848, advocating reduction of salaries of patent\r\nexaminers; and his denouncing the evil of congress's publishing\r\nagricultural works, in two speeches, the one made March 20, 1848, the\r\nother January 18, 1849. These are short, but strong, and their forcible\r\nstyle gives sure promise that the true Toombs is at hand. He suddenly\r\nfound his real self in December, 1849, when his lead towards secession\r\ncommenced, as I shall detail later. After that date he soon becomes one of\r\nthe strongest and most influential members; and especially one whose\r\nspeech greatly attracts audience. I must support this assertion by the\r\nrecord. With my limited space I must be very brief. My trouble is that the\r\nmany examples which I could use are all so good it is hard to decide what\r\nmust be left out. While I shall always give dates, so that my statements\r\ncan be checked by reference to the _Globe_, I need not confine myself\r\nstrictly to the order of time.\r\n\r\nHis mastery of parliamentary law is a good subject to begin with.\r\n\r\nJanuary 18, 1850, it was moved that the sergeant-at-arms act as doorkeeper\r\nuntil one be elected. The chair decided that the question affected the\r\norganization of the house and was therefore one of privilege. On an\r\nappeal there was much discussion. Here is the part played by Toombs:\r\n\r\n    \"_Mr. Toombs._ I apprehend that the speaker has committed error. This\r\n    is not an office known to the law; it was created only by the rules of\r\n    the house. The office of speaker and clerk alone are known to the\r\n    law.... It is not every officer whom by their rules they may choose to\r\n    appoint, that is necessary to the organization of the house. Suppose\r\n    that by a rule they provided for the appointment of a bootblack; could\r\n    a resolution for his appointment be made a question of privilege to\r\n    arrest and override all other business?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bayley inquired of the gentleman from Georgia if a rule was not as\r\n    clearly obligatory upon the house as a law.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Toombs._ It is; but its execution is not a question of\r\n    organization.\"\r\n\r\nA reversal was the result.\r\n\r\nThe following took place February 20, 1851, and is a good illustration of\r\nhis forcible way of putting things:\r\n\r\n    \"_Mr. Toombs._ (Interrupting Mr. Stanton) called the gentleman to\r\n    order. The committee ought not to tolerate this custom of speaking to\r\n    matters not immediately before it.\r\n\r\n    _The Chairman._ Does the gentleman from Georgia raise the point of\r\n    order that the remarks of the gentleman from Tennessee are not in\r\n    order because they have no reference to the bill before the committee.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Toombs._ My point is that debate upon steamboats is not in order\r\n    upon a pension bill.\r\n\r\n    _The Chairman._ I decide the gentleman is in order. It has been\r\n    invariable practice to permit such debate in committee of the whole on\r\n    the state of the union.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Toombs._ The practice may have been permitted; but it was wrong.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal by Toombs the chairman was reversed.\r\n\r\nThough Toombs--a whig--had stubbornly opposed the candidacy of Howell\r\nCobb--a democrat--he soon became to the latter, after his election as\r\nspeaker, the leading parliamentary authority. Often there would be\r\nconfused clamor and wild disorder, nearly every member proposing\r\nsomething. At a loss himself, Cobb would look at Toombs and see him\r\nintently conning his Jefferson. Soon he would rise, and being recognized\r\nby the speaker at once, would forthwith suggest the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing was often told by Cobb, as his friends have informed me.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, 1853, he shows up the bad consequences of overpaid offices,\r\nthe duties of which the holders can hire others to do for half of its\r\ncompensation; and March 2, the same year, he thus speaks of a cognate\r\nevil:\r\n\r\n    \"The gentleman seems to go upon the principle that as many clerks with\r\n    high salaries should be attached to one office as to any other--the\r\n    principle of equalizing the patronage of these different offices\r\n    without regard to the species of labor required by each.\"\r\n\r\nI append here a collection of short extracts from Toombs's speeches in the\r\nlower house, which illustrate his power to tickle the ear by striking\r\npresentation, epigram, and novel expression:\r\n\r\n    _Debate always Harmless._ \"A little more experience will show the\r\n    gentleman that he is mistaken, and that the absence of discussion here\r\n    does not accelerate adjournment. The most harmless time which is spent\r\n    by the house, he will find, is that spent in discussion.\" February 17,\r\n    1852.\r\n\r\n    _Nominees of National Conventions._ \"What are the fruits of your\r\n    national conventions?... They have brought you a Van Buren, a\r\n    Harrison, a Polk, and a General Taylor.... I mean no disparagement to\r\n    any one of these. All of them but one [Van Buren] have paid the last\r\n    debt of nature, and the one who survives, unfortunately for himself,\r\n    has survived his reputation.\" July 3, 1852.\r\n\r\n    _Two Classes of Economists._ \"There is a class of economists who will\r\n    favor any measure by which they can cut off wrong or extravagant\r\n    expenditures. But there is another class who are always preaching\r\n    economy--who are always ready to apply the rule of economy and get\r\n    economical in every case except that before the house.\" February 17,\r\n    1852.\r\n\r\n    _Principles of Banking._ \"If we intend to regulate the business of\r\n    banking in this District, the bill does too little; if we do not, it\r\n    does too much, As it does not seek to control generally the business\r\n    of banking, but permits the issue of notes greater than five dollars,\r\n    it violates the principles of unrestrained banking, but does not go to\r\n    the extent of regulation by law. I think the public are more likely to\r\n    suffer, and to a greater extent, from bank issues above five dollars\r\n    than those under that amount.\" January 11, 1853.\r\n\r\n    _The Dahlonega Mint, in his own State._ \"I believe the mints at\r\n    Dahlonega, Charlotte, and New York are each unnecessary.... I do not\r\n    desire to continue abuses in Georgia any more than in New York. I am\r\n    willing to pull up all abuses by the root.... I think the existing\r\n    mint is adequate to the wants of the country.\" February 17, 1853.\r\n\r\n    _Personal Explanations in Debate of Appropriations._ \"I believe that\r\n    with all the abuses we have had in the discussion of appropriation\r\n    bills, we have never had personal explanations.\" February 21, 1850.\r\n\r\nToombs is now about to leave the lower for the upper house. He has grown\r\nin all directions in the qualifications and powers marking the good\r\nrepresentative. There is no other man in the house, from either section,\r\nwhose ability is superior or whose promise greater. Three days before his\r\ncareer in the United States senate begins, he made the following appeal,\r\nprotesting against hasty and reckless expenditure, which seems to me a\r\nmodel of matter and extemporaneous expression:\r\n\r\n    \"In this bill the fortification bill is introduced; and provision made\r\n    for private wagon ways for Oregon and California. There is in it an\r\n    appropriation of $100,000 to pay somebody for the discovery of ether.\r\n    You have a provision for a Pacific railroad; and you have job upon job\r\n    to plunder the government in the military bill;--and the\r\n    representatives of the people are called upon to vote on all these\r\n    grave questions under five minutes' speeches. You do gross injustice\r\n    to yourselves; you betray great interests of the people when you act\r\n    upon such important measures in this manner. Let the house reject the\r\n    amendments; let the senate devote its time to maturing bills, and send\r\n    them to us to be acted upon deliberately; and then whichever way\r\n    congress determines for itself, it will have a right so to do. But to\r\n    act upon them in this way, is not only to abdicate our powers, but to\r\n    abdicate our duties. Put your hands upon these amendments and strike\r\n    them out.\" March 1, 1853.\r\n\r\nManifestly all that he had learned of the pending bill was from having\r\nheard it read. The instant apprehension and accurate statement, and the\r\nexhaustion of the subject in far shorter time than his small\r\nallowance--these recall what I often heard Stephens say, \"No one else has\r\never made such perfect and telling impromptus as Toombs.\"\r\n\r\nHis famous Hamilcar outburst did not consume all of his five minutes.\r\n\r\nToombs was United States senator from March 4, 1853, until the spring of\r\n1861. His peculiarities must be suggested. Although he was perhaps the\r\nablest lawyer in the senate, loved the profession with all the ardor of\r\nfirst love, and had great cases with large fees offered him every day, he\r\nresolutely subordinated law practice to his congressional duties. He did\r\nmuch practice, but it was all in the vacations of congress. He did not\r\nseek office. There is not to be found, so far as I know, a trace of any\r\naspiration of his during his congressional career for other than the place\r\nof senator. If on a special committee, he worked energetically; but he\r\navoided the standing committees. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"It is only occasionally that I go to the committee meetings to make a\r\n    quorum to act on important business. I do not attend them one day more\r\n    than I am obliged to, for I am quite sure it is not my duty unless\r\n    charged with a certain subject. This whole machinery is a means of\r\n    transferring the legislation of the country from those to whose hands\r\n    the constitution commits it to irresponsible juntas.... I say general\r\n    standing committees, without any exception, are great nuisances, and\r\n    they ought to be abolished.... They are not proper bodies to exercise\r\n    legislative powers. They are not known in the country from which we\r\n    derive our institutions. The English have no standing committees. They\r\n    raise special committees on special objects.\"[100] February 18, 1859.\r\n\r\n\"The general business of the country,\" as he expressed it, January 10,\r\n1859, that was his concern. Each subject requiring the action of the\r\nsenate, whether important or trivial, received his industrious attention,\r\nas his course and language on the floor always show; and he evidently\r\nfeels it his duty to furnish the body on all questions the utmost\r\ninstruction and aid that he can possibly give. He had no ambition to be\r\nthe author of novel measures--he was strenuous only to bestow upon every\r\nsubject of current legislation the proper consideration. His premeditated\r\nefforts are but few. He never shows any distrust of his offhand faculty.\r\nHe takes part in nearly all the discussions, often being up several times\r\nthe same day on the same subject. He is seldom lengthy, hardly ever away\r\nfrom the point needing explanation, and never, never dull. Generally he\r\ncomes with correcting fact or enlightening principle, and it is seldom\r\nthat his matter and words are not both impressive. I found it well in\r\nwriting the Life mentioned above to present the most of his senatorial\r\ncourse by assorting his utterances under their proper heads, with the\r\nbriefest possible comment, rather than to narrate chronologically in the\r\ncommon way of biographers. In his speeches it is only now and then that he\r\nis steadily progressive as he was in the Iowa contested election case. His\r\nadvocacy or opposition is generally founded upon a principle, and from\r\nthis principle--usually central and self-evident--the different passages\r\nradiate in aphorisms, self-supporting paragraphs, and detached\r\narguments,--this common radiation being their only connection. Accordingly\r\nif you know what is the particular subject that is under discussion, a\r\npart taken at random anywhere from any of his extempore speeches is nearly\r\nalways complete in itself and fully intelligible. Therefore we can have\r\nhim to give in his own words, in a comparatively small space, an\r\napproximately full collection of the rich and varied teachings of his\r\nsenatorial career, although our chrestomathy would appear to one putting\r\nit beside the unmutilated report of the _Globe_ as a beggarly and jejune\r\nabstract. I know of no other public man with whom this can be as\r\nsatisfactorily done. Of course the compilation made by me, as just told,\r\ncannot be given here. He challenged every bad and defended every good\r\nmeasure. He is on record both by speech, nearly always hitting the nail on\r\nthe head, and by vote, nearly always right, upon every one. What he did in\r\nthe house deserves close attention; but his actings and doings in the\r\nsenate, to which he belonged from March 4, 1853, until shortly after his\r\nfamous speech of January 7, 1861, when he left to go with his seceding\r\nState, are such that I challenge all students of history to produce a\r\nsingle example of such earnest grappling with and able handling of so many\r\nmatters of importance in so short a time--not eight full years--by any\r\nmember of ancient or modern parliaments.\r\n\r\nHaving now, I hope, aroused my readers to some faint conception of\r\nToombs's greatness as a senator in non-sectional matters, I must bring\r\nthat greatness into fuller view, if I can. I therefore add to the\r\nforegoing catalogue the rough character sketch next following.\r\n\r\nWe begin with his devotion to his duties. One examining the _Globe_ will\r\nhardly find any other member who calls as often for the reading of the\r\nreports accompanying bills to pay private claims, and such other small\r\nmatters; and he will always observe that his immediate comment shows that\r\nhe has fully taken in what has been read. He said once, \"I have been\r\nreproached half a dozen times within the last two days as being rather\r\nfractious because I desired to understand the business on which I was\r\ncalled to vote.\" August 3, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe alert and intelligent vigilance which he gives every measure proposed\r\nseems superior to that of all his colleagues. They acknowledge this by the\r\nmany inquiries they make of him for information as to pending bills. Thus\r\nJune 20, 1860, Green asks him where is the amendment? when was it adopted?\r\nhas the house disagreed to it? has it been before a committee? etc., and\r\nevery query is answered without hesitation. This but examples how the\r\nother senators very often made a convenience of Toombs's accurate note of\r\nwhat was passing.\r\n\r\nHe shows a like readiness upon facts of history--especially English and\r\nAmerican--on clauses of the constitution, or statutes, or treaties,\r\nprovisions of the law of nations, principles of political economy,\r\ninstitutions, commercial systems, customs of particular nations, and all\r\nsuch topics as may illustrate the pending question, however suddenly it\r\nmay have risen. And so he discusses every matter, grave or trivial, with\r\nperfect grasp of the proposition submitted, and with fullness of\r\nknowledge and understanding. He avoids strained and over-ingenious\r\nreasoning. Plain and safe men never disparaged his arguments by calling\r\nthem hair-splitting or metaphysical. But though he took his stand upon the\r\npalpable meaning of undisputed facts and the most plainly applicable\r\ndoctrines of reason and justice, he displayed an unparalleled power of\r\nformulating in intelligible and striking words the key principles of\r\ncommon affairs. This gift always found instant appreciation with practical\r\nmen, and they admired it as genius. Though he has his eye ever open to\r\nprinciple, he is the very opposite of the mere doctrinaire. He is\r\npractical, and always pushing business on, except when the bills depleting\r\nthe treasury--to use his favorite name for them--are up and likely to pass\r\nbecause of the coalition between the opposition and the fishy democrats\r\nwhich he is always exposing with exhaustless variety of language. Only\r\nthen he prefers to do nothing.\r\n\r\nAs to his own measures, he changes words, accepts amendments--in short\r\nmakes every concession which will gain him the substance of his desire.\r\n\r\nWe will here say a little of him as a speaker. He thus describes himself:\r\n\r\n    \"I speak rapidly; but the idea which I intend to utter generally comes\r\n    out, sometimes perhaps with too much plainness of speech. What I say,\r\n    I mean; and the whole of what I mean generally gets out.\" July 30,\r\n    1856.\r\n\r\nHe shows in the following a contemptuous opinion of written speeches:\r\n\r\n    \"As a general rule a speech that is fit to be spoken is not fit to be\r\n    printed, and one fit to be printed is not fit to be spoken.... The\r\n    senator from New York [Seward] comes in with his already in type;\r\n    other gentlemen around me, on both sides of the house, from all\r\n    sections of the union, who think proper to write essays, bring them\r\n    here and read them to the senate.... I am not objecting to their\r\n    character, but I would rather read them in my room. Of course nobody\r\n    pays any attention to them here.\" April 22, 1858.\r\n\r\nHe did not habitually correct the report of his speeches, as he says May\r\n13, 1858; at the same time entering a general disclaimer as to all that he\r\ndoes not report himself. This disclaimer must not be pressed too far. If\r\nyou are familiar with the man you need not fear being led astray by the\r\ninaccuracies, the number of which he greatly exaggerates. His stamp is so\r\nunmistakable that you always know what is his. Extempore discussion was\r\nhis forte. Therefore nearly all the quotations I use in the Life which I\r\nhave written I intentionally take from his shorter, impromptu, and\r\nevidently unrevised speeches. These unlabored effusions, it matters not\r\nhow dry or small the particular theme may be, have generally the double\r\nmerit of showing the true solution and refreshing with figure, apt\r\nillustration, or wit.[101]\r\n\r\nIn important debate he is conspicuously the strongest man in the senate.\r\nWe will run over the leading ones:\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1854, a bill containing appropriations for places in nearly every\r\none of the States came up. Through the long debate he evinces uncommon\r\npower and readiness. He is too tart in rejoinder, and too much gives the\r\nrein to invective.\r\n\r\nIn the two days' debate of the mail steamer appropriation--February 27,\r\n28, 1855,--he distinguishes himself.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1856, Toombs, with Hunter and Toucey, supports a resolution\r\nproposing the origination of appropriation bills in the Senate. Sumner and\r\nSeward take the other side. The argument of Seward is very elaborate,\r\nnotwithstanding his declaration at the outset that he is wholly\r\nunprepared. It is demolished by Toombs in his most crushing style. Note,\r\ntoo, how accurate the latter is as to the proceedings of the\r\nconstitutional convention, how familiar he is with the abuses of wild\r\nappropriations which he is trying to correct, and how graphically he\r\ndepicts them.\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1856, the Black Lake harbor appropriation is the subject. All\r\nthat he says is noticeable for power; especially his replies to\r\ninterruptions by Pugh, Wade, and Cass. Though the bill was passed over his\r\nhead, as you read the report you feel that his was the actual triumph.\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 1856, another debate of river and harbor improvements. It is\r\nbegun by Hunter. Benjamin takes the lead in support of the bill; Toombs\r\njoins discussion with the latter, who by his coolness and adroitness for a\r\nwhile foils his adversary; but soon Toombs gets his feet firmly on the\r\nconstitution, and still more firmly upon the injustice of extorting the\r\nsupport of commerce from other interests, and he is resistless. The\r\ndisputants often put questions to one another. Toombs's promptness to\r\nanswer every adverse position is a taking exhibition. It is to be noted\r\nthat many sparkling sentences are struck out of him by the incessant\r\nhammering of the others. At the close, he seems either to have wearied or\r\nsilenced his opponents. One cannot but feel that this is no arena for a\r\nman who can make only written speeches.\r\n\r\nAugust 4, 1856, the subject being the improvement of the Mississippi,\r\nToombs urges that the valley is prosperous, and it should improve its\r\nriver. The examination he gives the question is profoundly searching.\r\nTowards the conclusion of the debate, Cass reads the counter doctrine of\r\nCalhoun, in the report of latter to the Memphis convention, his reason\r\nbeing, as he says: \"I will confess frankly my object in reading it. The\r\nsenator from Georgia has treated the question with great ability; and I\r\nwant the same vehicle that carries his remarks to the public to carry\r\nalso the opinions and views of Mr. Calhoun, whose authority is vastly\r\nbetter than mine.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of this debate the faculty and force exhibited by Toombs\r\nare wonderful even for him.\r\n\r\nConsider all that he says of the proper management of the post-office,\r\nFebruary 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1860, there was an animated debate, which occupied the morning\r\nand was renewed in the evening. The vigorous blows which he deals the\r\ncoalition passing the appropriations--ever the theme of his severest\r\nreprehension--and the review he makes of each item in the appropriation\r\nbill, taken all in all, are high feats.\r\n\r\nHis conduct, January 6, 1857, in the Iowa contested election manifests\r\nsuch rare courage against party and section for the right that it must be\r\ntold at some length. We think it belongs with the more important matters\r\njust noticed rather than to its chronological place.\r\n\r\nHarlan, a republican, had been sitting for some time as a senator from\r\nIowa. There was no contestant. The adverse report was grounded upon a\r\nprotest of the Iowa senate, stating that that body did not participate in\r\nthe so-called joint convention which had affected to elect Harlan. It\r\nappeared that both houses of the Iowa legislature had met in joint\r\nconvention, had balloted without result, and the convention had adjourned\r\nto meet at 10 A. M. the next day. On this day the senate--the majority of\r\nits members manifestly being democrats and opposed to the sense of the\r\njoint majority--met in their own chamber and adjourned before the hour\r\nappointed for the assembling of the convention. But a majority of the\r\nsenate were present in the convention when it made the election--several\r\nof them having been brought in by the sergeant-at-arms, and who protested\r\nthat they did not act in the proceedings. In the United States senate the\r\ndemocrats were in a majority, but Toombs, who was always above mere party\r\nconsiderations, supported the cause of Harlan, saying afterwards, \"I\r\nmaintained his title, black Republican though he was, because I believed\r\nit stood on right.\" February 15, 1858. The decision was against Harlan;\r\nbut I do not think that an unbiased man who regards mere technical rules\r\nas no more than the instruments of justice, will fail to concur with\r\nToombs. His treatment of the subject is extremely good and entertaining.\r\nEvery material fact is given prominence; every important distinction\r\ntaken, as, for instance, that the convention, as it could do no\r\nlegislative act and did not require the concurrence of the executive, was\r\nnot really the legislature, but only the persons constituting the\r\nlegislature acting in a body of their own as electors; and further, his\r\nposition that after the convention had organized it could proceed with the\r\nelection as long as it had a quorum. Having completed a most lawyer-like\r\nand concatenated argument, which is a wonderful exhibition of concise and\r\nexhaustive extemporaneous reasoning, he rises to the higher plane of\r\nstatesmanship and justice, in which he shows in a vivid light what a\r\nmonstrous evil it would be to approve the factious withdrawal of the\r\nmajority of the Iowa senate from the convention. Note especially the many\r\nquestions asked him by different members, and the readiness and\r\nsatisfactoriness of his answers.[102] It is all in all one of the best\r\nsamples of Toombs's dispassionate debate to which I can refer. Very\r\nprobably the democrats would have done right by Harlan had it not been for\r\nBayard's argument, the special effectiveness of which was the use he made\r\nof the case of his own election, in 1839, to the United States senate by\r\nthe Delaware legislature. As he stated it, it was this: There being a\r\nmajority of one in the Delaware house of representatives in favor of the\r\nopposite party, a majority of that house refused to go into the joint\r\nballoting. Bayard was elected, and it was maintained by his party, the\r\ndemocrats, that a majority of the members of the two houses had authority\r\nto proceed; but he hesitated, and at last consulted Silas Wright, of New\r\nYork. The latter gave a decided opinion that such an election was invalid.\r\nWhereupon Bayard succumbed, and his State was without a senator for two\r\nyears. I cannot help feeling that if Wright had considered the subject and\r\nbottomed it on true principle, as Toombs afterwards did, Bayard would have\r\nsettled down in the opposite conclusion, and he and Toombs in concert\r\nwould have forced their fellow-democrats of the United States senate into\r\ndoing justice to an opponent.\r\n\r\nMany have been superior to Toombs in making perfect orations, but it is\r\nhard to find in any deliberative body a match for him as a debater.\r\nCharles Fox was a giant; but he did not have the strength, the grip, the\r\nnever remitted activity, the infinite thrust, the parry, illustration,\r\nwit, epigram, and invincible appeal to conscience, feeling, and reason--in\r\nshort, the complete supply and command of all resources that marked Toombs\r\nas foremost in the pancratium of parliamentary discussion. It ought to add\r\ninexpressible brightness to his fame that he sought for no triumphs except\r\nthose of justice and good policy. He was far more than a mere logician in\r\ndebate. His brilliant snatches, his sudden uprisings, his thawing humor,\r\nand flashing wit--all these did their part as effectively in winning favor\r\nand working suasion as his array of facts and his ratiocination did theirs\r\nin convincing. He was too prone to use harsh language towards the other\r\nside. There are many places in his speeches where I wish he had used soft\r\ninstead of bitter words. That he could observe perfect parliamentary\r\npropriety there are proofs in the _Globe_. Especially would I refer to his\r\nbehavior in the Harlan debate, spoken of a moment ago, and his discussion\r\nof the Indiana senatorial election, June 11, 1858. Note the last\r\nespecially (belonging volume, 2943-2947) for his moderation, courtesy, and\r\ninvitation of question while he is most ably supporting the central\r\nproposition he had before urged in the Iowa case.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of his occasional vehemence and acrimonious language, he\r\nseems to have the respect and regard of even his most decided political\r\nopponents. Wade and he recognize each the great merit of the other. Once\r\nafter applauding his honesty and frankness, Toombs says of him: \"He and I\r\ncan agree about everything on earth until we get to our sable population,\r\nI do believe.\" March 22, 1858.\r\n\r\nWade had already said this of Toombs: \"I commend the bold and direct\r\nmanner in which the senator from Georgia always attacks his opponents.\"\r\nFebruary 28, 1857.\r\n\r\nFebruary 8, 1858, Fessenden said, \"I am very happy to get that admission\r\nfrom the senator from Georgia. It is made with his customary frankness and\r\nclearness.\"\r\n\r\nHale also respects him. January 23, 1857, he says that Toombs ought to\r\nhave been on the bench, complimenting his desire for justice and fairness\r\nas well as his legal ability.\r\n\r\nThe northern democrat Simmons loves to praise him, as is evidenced by what\r\nhe says June 2, 1858, February 9, 1859, and June 23, 1860.\r\n\r\nSuch unsought and spontaneous commendations of the great southern partisan\r\nby northern men during the heat of sectional agitation are extraordinarily\r\nstrong proofs of his high character as well as great genius.\r\n\r\nOf course the southern members showed their appreciation. Especially note\r\nwhat Bayard says March 21, 1860, and what Butler says January 6, 1857. I\r\ncould give many more such; but I shall only add here how, February 14,\r\n1860, by reason of the importunate urgency of some of these, evidently\r\nregarding him as the special southern champion, he is pushed into making\r\nan able rejoinder to Hale, who had just concluded a reply to Toombs's\r\nspeech on the Invasion of States.\r\n\r\nToombs's inflexible keeping to what he deemed the right course parallels\r\nthe absolute fearlessness with which Julius Caesar, when a young man, clung\r\nto the wife whom the all-powerful and bloody-minded Sulla commanded him to\r\nput away. The Sulla of America are the people in their unconscientious\r\nmoments, and unpopularity the proscription threatened which disquiets\r\nalmost all public men with torturing apprehension. And so there is in\r\nnearly every one some admixture of the trimmer. But Toombs never showed\r\nfear either of the people at large or of those of his own State and\r\nlocality. He thus scourges juries assessing the value of land condemned\r\nfor the government:\r\n\r\n    \"It has come to such a pass that in getting places for the army, it\r\n    seems to be considered better to be cheated by the owners of a site\r\n    out of a few hundred thousand for $10,000 worth of property rather\r\n    than trust a jury.\" June 12, 1860.\r\n\r\nWhen he uttered the following he knew it was extremely unpalatable to his\r\nsection:\r\n\r\n    \"The southern States from their sparseness of population do not pay\r\n    all their postal expenses. The whole mail service of the south ought\r\n    to pay its whole expenses, and I am ready to put it on that ground....\r\n    I say the point to retrench is in the south.\" February 28, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe following distasteful lesson he read his own State:\r\n\r\n    \"I know that some of the mail routes in my own neighborhood were taken\r\n    away, and I never was consulted about them, and I never thought it was\r\n    the duty or business of the postmaster-general to consult me. I have\r\n    not been to his office during this winter in regard to a single one;\r\n    and I have been very much complained of, even in my own county and\r\n    town, on account of it.... I have a word to say about the _Isabel_.\r\n    She touches at Savannah; and I have received memorials from people,\r\n    letters from interested people, from the Savannah chamber of commerce,\r\n    and others, saying, 'By all means keep up the _Isabel_; we want it.'\r\n    It is a very popular thing; it is a good ship, and has done its duty\r\n    well. What have I to do but follow my uniform line of policy, and give\r\n    them the same rules as everybody else? Sixteen years' experience\r\n    here--and I was here in 1847, when this steamship system\r\n    commenced--have satisfied me that congressional contracts are always\r\n    unwise, and are the fruitful sources of boundless legislative\r\n    corruption. Therefore, I will never sustain one under any necessity\r\n    whatever.\" May 28, 1860.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 1859, though Iverson, his companion from Georgia, was the\r\nother way, he advocated abolishing the mint at Dahlonega in that State,\r\nand the mint also in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe last instance we cite is his declaration, April 25, 1856, that he had\r\nalways voted against a claim of the daughter of Governor Irvin of Georgia.\r\n\r\nAnd to this proud independence he was without spot of corruption. This was\r\nnever questioned but once. May 13, 1858, he was taunted for having\r\nsupported the Galphin claim. When at last he sees that the charge is\r\nseriously urged, in a becoming glow he demands an explanation. A\r\ndisclaimer of reflection upon his character being made, he gives a\r\ndetailed account of the claim, his steady support of it, and a complete\r\njustification of George W. Crawford in the affair. At its close, Hammond\r\nof South Carolina, who was familiar with all the details, bestowed upon it\r\nhis unqualified voucher. The lofty spirit and just indignation informing\r\nthis statement of Toombs from beginning to end distinguish it as that of\r\none who has kept out of dark places and walked so purely in the light that\r\naccusation is far more of a surprise than insult.[103]\r\n\r\nHe never showed any symptom of the presidential fever, which, to say\r\nnothing of its many other victims, enfeebled each one of the great\r\ntrio,--Clay, Calhoun, and Webster. Fully content with his place in the\r\nsenate, he did not look elsewhere. Taking popularity at its exact worth;\r\ncandid and frank to the extreme; contented in the course dictated by his\r\njudgment and conscience though opposed by his people or party and his own\r\nprivate interest; in no bargains with men nor smirching connections with\r\nwomen, doing nothing in secret which, if published, would bring a blush;\r\nelevated above the amiable weaknesses of unwise benevolence, ever\r\nchampioning with all his powers the righteous cause of the weak and\r\nunpopular,--as exampled in his maintaining the claims of certain persons\r\nin Louisiana to the Houmas land against the formidable opposition of the\r\ntwo senators from that State, in his extraordinarily eloquent appeal for\r\nthe naval officers retired without a hearing, in his heroic endeavor to\r\nhave his party seat the republican Harlan; incorruptible and really\r\nconsistent forever and always,--when he is scrutinized as a public man his\r\ncharacter rises into a grandeur of unselfishness, firmness of high\r\npurpose, honesty, and power to show and do the right almost superhuman. It\r\nstands by itself awe-striking and imposing.\r\n\r\nBut let us particularize the special lesson of his senatorial career. We\r\nmust begin by suggesting his peculiar bent. It is clear that he chose as\r\nhis province commerce and industry, with the related themes of political\r\neconomy, finance, the currency, taxation, the tariff, the principles of\r\nexchange and distribution, and so on.[104] He probably had the best\r\nbusiness insight of all our prominent statesmen, Calhoun even not\r\nexcepted. Though Hamilton and Webster--the former especially--evince\r\ntitanic comprehension of financial theory, yet we see from their lives and\r\npoor money-saving success that commercial and business affairs were not to\r\nthem both practice and theory as they were to Toombs. Of all his peers he\r\nwas most at home in the ways and principles which dictate proper\r\nlegislation as to trade and business. To judge by his words, uttered year\r\nin and year out, nobody else ever saw more clearly that there ought to be\r\nno tariff, improvement, job, or any other pets of government. The latter\r\nshould not foster such a class, yearly increasing in number, as it always\r\nwill, living idly and luxuriously upon the public income, that is, upon\r\nthe labor and property of others. This class supplants the vigorous\r\nproducts of natural selection by pampered fatlings of bounty, always\r\nraising their demands for support, and ever more and more clamorously\r\ncalling for the suppression of all self-supporting competition at home and\r\nabroad. With the moral hardihood of Shakspeare, who shrinks not from\r\nrudely shocking our feelings by making Henry V discard his old boon\r\ncompanion Falstaff, Toombs never wearied of proclaiming the unpopular\r\ntruth that the government ought not to be the helper, guardian, patron,\r\nprotector, guarantor, surety, almoner, of any of its citizens. Ponder\r\nthese stout-hearted and golden words of his, although the evil represented\r\ntherein is now established and magnified into dimensions far beyond what\r\nhe could conceive when they were said--an evil, to suppress which let us\r\nhope all patriots will soon unite:\r\n\r\n    \"Whenever the system shall be firmly established that the States are\r\n    to enter into a miserable scramble for the most money for their local\r\n    appropriations, and that senator is to be regarded the ablest\r\n    representative of his State who can get for it the largest slice of\r\n    the treasury, from that day public honor and property are gone, and\r\n    all the States are disgraced and degraded.\" February 27, 1857.\r\n\r\nHe is always preaching against the heinous abuse of diverting government\r\nfrom impartially guarding the whole community and making it profit only a\r\nfew. His text is never far-fetched. He finds it in the proposed\r\nlegislation of the day, which it is his duty to consider in his place. He\r\ncares not that he makes no present effect. Just before Bell's bill for\r\nimproving the Cumberland river was passed, he said of it and its\r\ncompanions: \"These bills are passing _sub silentio_, and I suppose attempt\r\nto resist is wholly useless. I wish it understood that I do not assent to\r\ntheir passage. I am opposed to all of them.\" February 24, 1855.\r\n\r\nHe sees that the appropriations for harbors and rivers, lighthouses,\r\nprivate claims, pensions, etc., are almost as baneful as was the\r\ndistribution of corn to the Roman populace, and yet the people everywhere\r\nare eager for the corrupting gifts. Against his party, against many of his\r\nsection, he fights alone and single-handed, reminding of Horatius keeping\r\nthe bridge against the Etruscan host. Though always outvoted, he behaves\r\nwith spirit and dignity. Either he, or some one of the faithful few who\r\nact with him in the slim minority, always have the yeas and nays recorded.\r\nHis grand purpose was to appeal to the American people upon an issue\r\ninvolving the article of his creed which he had held up with so much\r\npuissance and fidelity in days of evil report. These words contain the\r\nmotto of the long contest which occupied all of his non-sectional career\r\nin the senate:\r\n\r\n    \"I think every one of these bills should be considered. I do not wish\r\n    to have them considered in such a manner as improperly to occupy the\r\n    time of the senate. I desire to spread before the country reasonable\r\n    information. That is the only purpose we can have now; because the\r\n    combination is sufficient to carry everything that the committee\r\n    report. But there is a day of reckoning to come; and I trust that\r\n    those who support this system will be called to judgment.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I desire the truth to go to the honest people all over the country.\r\n    Let the taxpayers look at this matter; let the jobbers beware. 'To\r\n    your tents, O Israel!'\" July 29, 1856.\r\n\r\nThe sectional agitation, mounting higher and higher, as Toombs said often,\r\nblinded the people to this great subject. Secession came, and his\r\nState--to him the only sovereign--called the solitary combatant away from\r\nthe ground that ought to be kept forever in loving memory for his long,\r\ndesperate, thrice-valiant stand. And the world should also remember that\r\nthe clauses of the constitution of the Confederate States, \"prohibiting\r\nbounties, extra allowances, and internal improvements,\" came from\r\nhim.[105]\r\n\r\nThe struggle that wins our deliverance from the monopolists now causing us\r\nto go hungry, cold, and unshod is yet to be. I cannot say when; but I know\r\nit will come soon, and that the people will conquer. As in that day\r\nCalhoun's monetary doctrine will be brought out of its obscurity to add\r\nnew lustre to his fame, as I believe, so I believe also that the name of\r\nRobert Toombs will become an object of affectionate reverence to all his\r\ncountrymen, and the weighty and eloquent sentences in which he sought to\r\nshield general industry from drones and rivals favored by government, and\r\nin which he advocated that the public burdens be reduced to the minimum,\r\nand then apportioned justly,--these stirring words will be quoted\r\neverywhere to receive at last their due audience and favor. And when no\r\nbranch of our government either robs or gives to its citizens, Toombs's\r\nnever-remitted, brave, unselfish, and gigantic endeavor to bring on this\r\nmillennium ought to be put by Americans in their Sunday-school books. When\r\nwe who fought the brothers' war completely forget and forgive, as we soon\r\nwill, it will then be understood how much the sectional agitation impeded\r\nhim, and that when he was caught away from the senate by the whirlwind of\r\nsecession he was only fifty years old, and of such constitutional vigor\r\nthat he had the guaranty of at least a quarter of a century more of\r\nundiminished activity. A fond imagination will inquire: Suppose the energy\r\nspent upon the Kansas discussion; the protection of slavery in the\r\nTerritories; in the great speech of January 24, 1860, on the Invasion of\r\nStates, and in that of January 7, 1861, justifying secession, his supreme\r\neffort, as most of his admirers claim, could have been saved for themes of\r\nPan-American concern; and suppose him remaining in the senate, eschewing\r\nall other place, with increasing years loved the more by his people for\r\nhis courageous fidelity to the right, age assuaging his vehemence and\r\nsoftening his invective, ripening his judgment and bringing him charity\r\nand wisdom to the full,--to what a height and glory he would have grown!\r\n\r\nIf there had been no slavery, I verily believe that the south would have\r\nbeen the leading and most prosperous part of the union, and that Toombs\r\nwould have been the greatest American. Stephens knew Webster, Calhoun, and\r\nClay. The longer he lived the more positive he became in believing that\r\nToombs was superior in ability to each one of the three. I have heard him\r\nsay often that he had never found anything to which he could compare the\r\npower of Toombs, discussing a great theme extempore, except Niagara.\r\n\r\nTurning back from these unavailing conjectures, I must say a last word as\r\nto that part of Toombs's career in the senate which I have been\r\ndiscussing. Its exemplariness is not so much in single great achievements.\r\nIt is his uniform attention to the current duties of his place. Whether\r\nthe particular duty impending was important or trivial, whether it was\r\npopular or not, it received from him at the proper time whatever effort\r\nwas needed for doing it rightly. His performance averages so high in merit\r\nthat I cannot find a like. No plodder ever kept more closely to the safe\r\nand beaten path. But he did far more than plod. Almost every day for eight\r\nyears he showed how genius can manifest itself fully and fitly and find\r\nits true activity in the common round of affairs; how it can better,\r\nexalt, ennoble, and beautify daily routine. I believe that if you will\r\nreflect over this, you will at last see that such are the greatest of men,\r\nand those that the world most needs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now take up Toombs's sectional career. The aggressive defence of\r\nslavery, looming in sight as Calhoun is within a few months of death,\r\ncalled for a leader who did not hug the union, and whose eyes were shut to\r\neverything but the justice and sanctity of the southern cause. Calhoun's\r\nlast speech, that of March 4, 1850, was throughout an appeal to the north.\r\nIn that same session, and some while before that speech was delivered, the\r\ntrue apostle of secession begins the proclamation of his mission, and some\r\ntime after Calhoun's death and before the end of the session that\r\nportentous proclamation was complete. Robert Toombs--then in his fortieth\r\nyear, and having as yet attained but little conspicuousness in\r\ncongress--is the man I mean. His appeal was really to the south.\r\n\r\nJust after the new congress assembled in December, 1849, a caucus of the\r\nwhigs, to which party Toombs then belonged, having met to nominate a\r\ncandidate for speaker of the house, he introduced a resolution to the\r\neffect that congress ought not to put any restriction upon any State\r\ninstitution in the Territories, nor abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, and, the resolution being rejected, Toombs, Stephens, and a\r\nsmall number of others retired from the caucus, and they did not act any\r\nfurther with their party in the organization of the house. Toombs and his\r\nfollowing declared their purpose to disregard former connections and side\r\nwith whatever party accorded the south the guaranty demanded by the\r\nresolution above mentioned. As these southern whigs, and also fourteen\r\nnorthern democrats and whigs, would not support for speaker either Cobb,\r\nthe democratic nominee, or Winthrop, the whig, neither one of the two\r\nnominees could muster the majority necessary under the rules for election.\r\nToombs's tactics were like those of the commons who would not vote the\r\nsupplies until the king granted their wishes in other matters. At this\r\ntime all the southern democrats and a majority of the southern whigs were\r\nopposed to his action. He was leading what appeared to be a hopeless\r\nadvance. This is the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is when, after nine days of balloting for speaker without\r\nresult, a resolution was introduced declaring Cobb, who had received a\r\nplurality, speaker, when Duer of New York opposing, said he was willing\r\nfor the sake of organizing to elect a whig, democrat, or free-soiler--only\r\nthat he could not support a disunionist. This manifest reflection upon the\r\nwhigs who had held themselves aloof made Toombs break the silence he had\r\ntheretofore kept.\r\n\r\nHe surprised everybody--perhaps himself--with an impromptu of powerful\r\nargument and burning eloquence. Note, in order to compare it with whatever\r\nutterance of Calhoun you please, these passages:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir, I have as much attachment to the union of these States, under\r\n    the constitution of our fathers, as any freeman ought to have. I am\r\n    ready to concede and sacrifice for it whatever a just and honorable\r\n    man ought to sacrifice. I will do no more. I have not heeded the\r\n    aspersions of those who did not understand or desired to misrepresent\r\n    my conduct or opinions. The time has come when I shall not only utter\r\n    them, but make them the basis of my political action here. I do not,\r\n    then, hesitate to avow before this house and the country, and in the\r\n    presence of the living God, that if by your legislation you seek to\r\n    drive us from the Territories of California and New Mexico, purchased\r\n    by the blood and treasure of the whole people, and to abolish slavery\r\n    in the District, thereby attempting to fix a national degradation upon\r\n    half of the States of this confederacy, _I am for disunion_; and if my\r\n    physical courage be equal to the maintenance of my convictions of\r\n    right and duty, I will devote all I am and all I have on earth to its\r\n    consummation.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The Territories are the common property of the United States.... You\r\n    are their common agents; it is your duty while they are in the\r\n    territorial state to remove all impediments to their free enjoyment\r\n    by both sections ... the slaveholder and the non-slaveholder. You have\r\n    made the strongest declarations that you will not perform this trust;\r\n    that you will appropriate to yourselves all the Territories.... Yet\r\n    with these declarations on your lips, when southern men refuse to act\r\n    with you in party caucuses in which you have a controlling\r\n    majority--when we ask the simplest guaranty for the future--we are\r\n    denounced out of doors as recusants and factionists, and indoors we\r\n    are met with the cry of 'Union, union!'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Give me securities that the power of the organization which you seek\r\n    will not be used to the injury of my constituents, then you have my\r\n    co-operation; but not till then.... Refuse them, and, as far as I am\r\n    concerned, 'let discord reign forever.'\"\r\n\r\nI must emphasize the effect of this speech made December 13, 1849,--nearly\r\nthree months before that of Calhoun last mentioned,--and which goes great\r\nlengths beyond anything ever said by Calhoun. The _Globe_ mentions that\r\nthe speaker was loudly applauded several times. Stephens, who was present,\r\nsays \"it received rounds of applause from the floors and the galleries,\"\r\nand we can well believe his assertion that it \"produced a profound\r\nsensation in the house and in the country.\"[106] Another eye-witness,\r\nHilliard of Alabama, a southern whig who was not in sympathy with his\r\nrefusal to act with his party, relates with rapturous reminiscence the\r\nfull-orbed splendor with which Toombs unexpectedly rose upon the house at\r\nthis time. He tells: \"A storm of applause greeted this speech. Mr. Toombs\r\nhad left his desk and taken his stand in the main aisle and the southern\r\nmembers crowded about him.\"[107]\r\n\r\nFor completeness and height, and for sudden surprise, this speech exceeds\r\nall impromptus on record. To appreciate it you must recognize it as surely\r\nforerunning the future uprising of southerners as one man in what they\r\ndeemed the holiest of causes. When you do this you can adapt to it\r\nWebster's words:\r\n\r\n    \"True eloquence ... does not consist in speech.... It must exist in\r\n    the man, in the subject, and in the occasion.... It comes ... like ...\r\n    the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous original,\r\n    native force.... Then patriotism is eloquent, then self-devotion is\r\n    eloquent.... This, this is eloquence; or rather it is something\r\n    greater and higher than all eloquence--it is action, noble, sublime,\r\n    godlike action.\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining facts of this remarkable session, which show that Toombs and\r\nnot Calhoun was the apostle of secession, can now be told very briefly.\r\n\r\nDecember 14, 1849, debate in the house was prohibited by resolution. On\r\nthe 22d the whigs and democrats, in order to organize without agreeing to\r\nthe demands of Toombs, joined in a resolution that the person receiving\r\nthe largest vote on a certain ballot, if it should be a majority of a\r\nquorum, should be speaker. This was a palpable violation of the rules, but\r\nperhaps authorized by the great emergency. When the resolution was\r\npresented, Toombs, having resolved to prevent any organization until he\r\nhad secured the guaranty he was standing for, in defiance of the\r\nprohibition of debate, made a demonstration of his surpassing endowment,\r\nas compared with all other orators, to outmob a hostile mob and scourge\r\nthem into respectful audience. He adroitly led Staunton, introducing the\r\nresolution, to yield the floor. Why should he want the floor? The house\r\nhad forbidden any discussion, and especially were nine-tenths of them deaf\r\nto him, deeming him the cause of their failure to organize. Announcing his\r\npurpose of discussion, he was called to order. Then a point of order was\r\nraised, which the clerk tried to put. The yeas and nays being demanded,\r\nthe clerk began to call the roll. There was turmoil and din, but Toombs\r\nheld on, denying the right of anybody to interrupt him, supporting his\r\nattack on the resolution by the constitution, the act of 1789, and the\r\nhigh authority of John Q. Adams, challenging the right of the clerk\r\ncalling the names, and indignantly inquiring of the house how they could\r\nso permit an intruder and an interloper in nowise connected with them to\r\ninterrupt their proceedings. At the last he forced the house into quiet,\r\nand completed the argument he had risen to make. You will not understand\r\nthis marvellous achievement if you deem it, as many do, to have been\r\nprompted by the pride of ostentation and the rage of turbulence. Toombs\r\nwas thinking only of securing the rights of his people. He was as earnest\r\nin this cause as ever Webster was for the union. And destiny,\r\nprovidence,--not himself nor other men,--was in this juncture revealing\r\nhim to the south as her leader.\r\n\r\nHe now begins to be conscious of his coming leadership, and to feel that\r\nhe is an authority and entitled to pronounce _ex cathedra_ upon the\r\nquestion of southern equality in the disposition of the Territories.\r\nConsequently, February 27, 1850, he made a long speech on the subject of\r\nthe admission of California--one far more elaborate and finished than his\r\naverage efforts. Especially to be noted is its ending with the famous\r\nwords of Troup, \"When the argument is exhausted, we will stand by our\r\narms.\"\r\n\r\nOne other exploit of Toombs during this session must be told. It crowned\r\nhim as the leader of the south.\r\n\r\nExcitement had become intense. The extreme northern partisans for bringing\r\nin California were challenged to answer if they ever would vote to admit a\r\nslave State, and they declined to say that they would. Thereupon came from\r\nToombs an outburst which is perhaps the finest example of his miraculous\r\nextempore declamation which has survived. He did not consume the five\r\nminutes to which he was limited. We append the conclusion, which is a\r\nlittle more than a third of the whole:\r\n\r\n    \"We do not oppose California on account of the anti-slavery clause in\r\n    her constitution. It was her right to exclude slavery, and I am not\r\n    even prepared to say she acted unwisely in its exercise--that is her\r\n    business; but I stand upon the principle that the south has the right\r\n    to an equal participation in the Territories of the United States. I\r\n    claim for her the right to enter them all with her property and\r\n    securely to enjoy it. She will divide with you, if you wish it; but\r\n    the right to enter all, or divide, I shall never surrender. In my\r\n    judgment, this right, involving as it does political equality, is\r\n    worth a thousand such unions as we have, even if they each were a\r\n    thousand times more valuable than this. I speak not for others, but\r\n    for myself. Deprive us of this right and appropriate this common\r\n    property to yourselves, it is then your government, not mine. Then I\r\n    am its enemy, and I will, if I can, bring my children and my\r\n    constituents to the altar of liberty, and, like Hamilcar, swear them\r\n    to eternal hostility to your foul domination. Give us our just rights,\r\n    and we are ready, as ever heretofore, to stand by the union, every\r\n    part of it, and its every interest. Refuse it, and for one I shall\r\n    strike for independence.\"\r\n\r\nStephens, ever a most accurate and trustworthy witness, says that of all\r\nspeeches which he heard during his congressional course, which covered the\r\nyears 1843-1859, this produced the greatest sensation in the house.[108]\r\nIts effect outside--that is, in the southern public--was widespread, deep,\r\nand permanent. The comparison with which it closed had been, I believe,\r\nused before; but what of that? It exactly voiced the revolutionary\r\nsentiment which, as his deliverances on the 13th of December before\r\nshowed, was beginning to come into consciousness in his section. It gave\r\nnew impetus to the circulation of the other speeches. The young men of\r\nGeorgia, as I know, and perhaps those of other southern States, read them\r\nover and over, reciting with passionate emphasis the most stirring\r\npassages. Especially did they delight to declaim the peroration of the\r\nHamilcar speech, as that of June 15, 1850, has always been called in\r\nGeorgia. To the stump orators, the last mentioned and that of December 13\r\nbecame examples which they emulated only to find in their despairing\r\nadmiration that parallel was impossible. And even the retiring, quiet, and\r\nelderly people who care for nothing but their daily business caught the\r\nfire. Not long ago, one who is now old, who was entering middle age in\r\n1850, and who has been a stanch union man all his life, told me that he\r\ncould not keep from reading these speeches over and over, and whenever he\r\nread one of them, it made him for the time a disunionist.\r\n\r\nThe part played by Toombs in the congressional session of 1849-50 seems to\r\nme one of the most wonderful exploits in all parliamentary annals. Since\r\nslavery is gone, and I can at last understand that it was all blessing to\r\nthe African and all curse to us, my joy is inexpressible. But I must ever\r\nhold that its defence was one of the noblest efforts of the best of\r\npeople. It will soon be understood by the whole world, and especially by\r\nour brothers of the north. They will acknowledge that neither Greek nor\r\nScot nor Swiss were more manly or heroic than southerners, and the\r\nsupporters of the Lost Cause will be crowned with such lustre and glory as\r\nmagnify Hannibal succumbing to Rome, or Demosthenes unvailingly stirring\r\nup his country against Macedon. It will forever bring me ecstatic emotion\r\nto recall the many, many places where my fellows suffered or fell at my\r\nside without a murmur. Our victories at the opening of the brothers' war;\r\nthen the drawn battles; then the defeats; and the round of sickening\r\ndisasters at the end,--all these come thronging back, and I can never be\r\nother than proud of the prowess and endurance of our out-numbered armies,\r\nthe energy and untamable spirit of our people, and the devotion of our\r\nblessed women to the weal of our soldiers. I often look back over the\r\ntrack of what I have called the aggressive defence of slavery. Though it\r\nwas disguised under various names, such as the threat of disunion in\r\ncertain contingencies by the Georgia Platform, just division of the public\r\ndomain between the sections called for by all parties in the south, and\r\nfinally the demand for full protection of slavery in the Territories; and\r\nthough it was now and then seemingly at rest, that movement from the day\r\nit set in was in reality one directly towards secession, and it kept on as\r\nsteadily as the Propontic. And as I look back at the further edge of this\r\nretrospect, marking the beginning, towering above all who took high place\r\nlater,--even above Lee and Jackson,--ever comes more plainly into view the\r\nmajestic figure of Robert Toombs, revealing his unsuspected power like a\r\nthunderclap from the sunny sky, December 13, 1849, when he extorts wild\r\nacclamations of applause from the majority of southern whigs and all of\r\nthe southern democrats, both unanimous against his stand for a guaranty of\r\ncongressional non-restriction; a few days later coercing an infuriated\r\nhouse trying to cry him down into wondering silence; and through the whole\r\nsession upholding his cause with such might that the single champion\r\nproves an overmatch for the two parties striking hands against him, and he\r\nfinally conquers preaudience and dictation upon the main southern theme.\r\n\r\nI become more and more confident that future history will find the\r\nachievement of Toombs in the session of 1849-50 to be the exact point\r\nwhere the drift towards secession, which had before that been only latent\r\nand potential, becomes actual, and that here is the dawn of the\r\nConfederate States. The more I gaze at it the plainer and redder that dawn\r\nbecomes.\r\n\r\nWe need not tell the rest of Toombs's sectional career with much detail.\r\nThe all-important part of it historically is its beginning, and how he\r\nvaulted into the lead of the aggressive defence of the south, which I hope\r\nI have adequately told. From this time he showed in all that he did the\r\nquality which Mommsen glorifies in Julius Caesar,--ready insight into the\r\npossible and impossible. Much discontent manifested itself in Georgia, and\r\nalso in Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, against the compromise\r\nmeasures, and especially against the admission of California with its\r\nconstitution prohibiting slavery. A convention being called in Georgia to\r\nconsider what should be done, there was thorough discussion. An\r\noverwhelming majority of delegates opposing any resistance was elected. To\r\nthis result Toombs contributed more than any one else, and he really\r\nshaped the platform finally promulgated by the convention. This--the\r\nGeorgia Platform of 1850, as we always called it--is a most important\r\ndocument to the historian; for it was the weighed and solemn declaration\r\nof some nine-tenths of the people of a pivotal southern State.\r\n\r\nThe southern-rights men, as a small but noisy part of the southern people\r\nthen called themselves, had mistaken Toombs's last-mentioned speeches in\r\ncongress as declarations for immediate disunion in case California was\r\nadmitted under her free constitution; and when he supported the compromise\r\nmeasures, and also the Georgia Platform, they hotly denounced him as a\r\nturncoat. In their blind fury they could not see, as everybody else did,\r\nthat vehement and fervent language, proper to awaken one's people from\r\nperilous apathy, may really be at the time understatement, and that, after\r\nthe people have awakened, to seek in that same language the counsel of\r\nright action would be the extreme of immoderate folly. The more you\r\nmeditate it the more plainly you discern that his leadership was masterly.\r\nFrom the first to the last his appeal was to the middle class of property\r\nowners--then so numerous that it was practically the whole of southern\r\nsociety. His object at the first, as he declared, was to make with this\r\nclass the protection of their fundamental property interest the prominent\r\nquestion of national politics. And the end showed that he not only took,\r\nbut that he kept, the right road. The Georgia Platform became the bible of\r\nevery political following in the State. The next year, 1851, Toombs, still\r\na whig, supported Howell Cobb, a democrat, for governor against McDonald,\r\none of the most popular men of the State, the southern-rights candidate.\r\nToombs's side, which won by a large majority, was called the union party.\r\nYou will not be deceived by this if you keep in mind that Cobb was elected\r\non the Georgia Platform, which had pledged the people of the State to\r\nresist, even to disunion, certain named encroachments upon slavery which\r\nprovidence had already ordered to be made.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Yancey had aroused the people of Alabama into demanding that the\r\nUnited States protect slavery in the Territories, and he advocated\r\nsecession in 1850. But in both these things he was premature. As compared\r\nwith Toombs he uncompromisingly stood for every tittle of what he believed\r\nwere the rights of the south. Toombs was a far more practical and able\r\nopportunist. His falling back upon the Georgia Platform from a much more\r\nadvanced position, as I have just told, is an instance. I want to give\r\nothers. He always declared in private conversation after the war that the\r\ndemocratic party was ripened and committed by Douglas and his co-workers\r\nto the repeal of the Missouri compromise while he was kept away from\r\nWashington by necessary attention to the interests of a widowed sister,\r\notherwise, with his commanding position at the time, he would have crushed\r\nthe scheme at its first proposal. When he returned to his public duties,\r\nto his amazement he found that every prominent member of the party was\r\nirrevocably for the repeal, and he could do nothing but embrace the\r\ninevitable. Then he would say substantially, \"Had it not been for that\r\nadministratorship which I could not avoid taking, we would all still be\r\nworking our slaves in peace and comfort. That Missouri settlement was not\r\nright, but we had agreed to it; and with me a wrong settlement, when I\r\nagree to it, is just as binding as a righteous one.\"\r\n\r\nWhen others are urging that the United States ought to protect slavery in\r\nthe Territories, the record does not show that he is interested at first;\r\nalthough when at last the question is forced into debate he makes by far\r\nthe strongest speech of all in championship of the Davis resolutions. I\r\nbelieve the current sucked him in.\r\n\r\nJust after Lincoln's election--an event which influenced nearly all of\r\neven the most moderate elderly people of my acquaintance to declare at\r\nonce for a southern confederacy--he proposed that Stephens join with him\r\nin an address to the people of Georgia, counselling that no immediate\r\nsecessionist nor non-resistance man be elected to the convention;[109] and\r\nlater he professed willingness to accept the Crittenden compromise.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the ablest leaders, as we call them, do not lead--they\r\nare led. If they should become non-representative, their followers would\r\ngo elsewhere. And those of these leaders whose influence is the most\r\npotent and permanent are the conservative and moderate. Toombs was never\r\nreally ahead in the southern movement except when for a brief while in the\r\nsession of 1849-50 he planted the standard far to the front and called his\r\npeople forward. Afterwards there were always others who appeared to be\r\nfighting much in advance of him.\r\n\r\nHe companioned his people as they steadily developed their readiness for\r\nthe dread action commanded by the Georgia Platform if the north should say\r\nnot another inch of extension for slavery, and no extradition of fugitive\r\nslaves. Of course he matured in feeling for secession far beyond what\r\nappeared to be his ripeness in 1850. With all his conservatism, he was of\r\nthat stuff out of which the most earnest and biased partisans are made.\r\nThere are many who can admit nothing against those they love, and a still\r\nlarger number who hug their country with a religious acceptance of\r\neverything in it as the best in the world. To him and his people, the\r\nsouth, under the mighty influence of the nationalization we have\r\nexplained, had long been unconsciously displacing the union in their\r\nhearts. As one may learn from his Tremont Temple lecture, he saw and\r\nmagnified all of the good in the society to which he belonged, and was as\r\nblind to the bad as a mother is to the faults of her children. He was\r\noften heard to run through an enumeration of southern superiorities. The\r\ncourage and valor of the men, the virtue and loveliness of the women, the\r\npurity of the administration of justice and of the performance of all\r\npublic duties; especially did he love to say that the honesty of his\r\nsection was so well established that its few venal congressmen were like a\r\nwoman of easy virtue in a good family, whom the reputation of the latter\r\nkeeps from solicitation; and he would fall to praising the kingliness of\r\ncotton, the beneficence of slavery both to master and slave, the delicacy\r\nof our yam, the excelling flavor given by crab grass to beef and butter,\r\nthe juice of the peach of Middle Georgia, sweeter than nectar, the\r\nincomparable melon, and cap the climax by asserting persimmon beer to be\r\nmore acceptable to the palate of a connoisseur than any champagne. And in\r\nthe days just preceding the great outbreak he had become more intense in\r\nhis deep love for his State and section. The raid of John Brown into\r\nVirginia was, I think, the event which turned the scale with him, and made\r\nhim feel that secession was near. Taking the occasion offered by Douglas's\r\nresolution, directing the judiciary committee to report a bill for the\r\nprotection of each State against invasion by the authorities and\r\ninhabitants of other States, January 24, 1860, he delivered in the senate\r\na speech which we must notice. It is common in Georgia to adopt the eulogy\r\nof Stephens and pronounce the speech of January 7, 1861, justifying\r\nsecession, as Toombs's greatest effort. But I hesitate, unable to decide\r\nwhich is superior. He states his propositions thus:\r\n\r\n    \"I charge, first, that this organization of the abolitionists has\r\n    annulled and made of no effect a fundamental principle of the federal\r\n    constitution in many States, and has endeavored and is endeavoring to\r\n    accomplish the same result in all non-slaveholding States.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, I charge them with openly attempting to deprive the people\r\n    of the slaveholding States of their equal enjoyment of, and equal\r\n    rights in, the common Territories of the United States, as expounded\r\n    by the supreme court, and of seeking to get the control of the federal\r\n    government, with the intent to enable themselves to accomplish this\r\n    result by the overthrow of the federal judiciary.\r\n\r\n    Thirdly, I charge that large numbers of persons belonging to this\r\n    organization are daily committing offences against the people and\r\n    property of the southern States which, by the law of nations, are good\r\n    and sufficient causes of war even among independent States; and\r\n    governors and legislatures of States, elected by them, have repeatedly\r\n    committed similar acts.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts are reviewed closely and summed up with extraordinary force; the\r\nsubject is treated as carefully under the law of nations as under the\r\nconstitution; the quotation from Mill's \"Moral Sentiments,\" and that from\r\nThucydides, narrating the successful effort of Pericles in persuading the\r\nAthenians to resort to war rather than concede the right of the Megareans\r\nto receive their revolted slaves, are appositely used; the conviction that\r\nthere is no longer safety for the south in the union speaks out in every\r\nline; and, with the exception of a few overheated passages, the entire\r\nspeech is from the loftiest height of the statesman who bids his people\r\narm for self-preservation. Just preceding the peroration there are\r\nparagraphs describing nervously and graphically the great resources of the\r\nsouth and her rapid development from feeble beginnings, one of which\r\nespecially emphasizes the past and present of Virginia, adding at the last\r\n\r\n  \"One blast upon her bugle horn\r\n  Were worth a million men.\"\r\n\r\nNext before this are words which invoke the northern democracy, but they\r\nseem out of place and foreign. He abruptly ends his appeal to the national\r\nclasses who have his respect by saying, \"The union of all these elements\r\nmay yet secure to our country peace and safety. But if this cannot be\r\ndone, peace and safety are incompatible with this union. Yet there is\r\nsafety and a glorious future for the south. She knows that liberty in its\r\nlast analysis is but the blood of the brave. She is able to pay the price\r\nand win the blessing. Is she ready?\"\r\n\r\nThe last three sentences are the southern correlative of Webster's soaring\r\nwhen he magnified the union in his reply to Hayne. They were repeated over\r\nand over by everybody with a wild acceptance utterly without parallel in\r\nmy knowledge, and after the election of Lincoln became the war cry of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe position taken in the very conclusion of this truly Periclean speech\r\nis especially to be attended to here. It is that in the event of the\r\nsuccess of the republican party in the next presidential election the\r\npeople of his State must redeem their pledge made nine years before in the\r\nGeorgia Platform.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on he is _facile primus_ of southern champions. Note his\r\nlong and elaborate reply to Doolittle, February 27, 1860; the discussion\r\nwith Wade, March 7, 1860,--both relating to his speech last noticed above;\r\nand his very able argument, May 21, 1860, on the duty of protecting\r\nslavery in the Territories.\r\n\r\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1860 the Douglas men and the Americans\r\nin Georgia charged the supporters of Breckinridge with plotting disunion\r\nthat would bring on war. The charge was generally denied. The truth is,\r\nhardly anybody was aware that the awful crisis was near. Those who really\r\nexpected secession believed with Howell Cobb and his brother Thomas, and\r\nwith Thomas W. Thomas, that it would be peaceable, and perhaps they were\r\nabout a tenth; the rest followed Stephens, believing that the American\r\npeople on each side of Mason and Dixon's line would, when it was demanded,\r\nrise up in resistless co-operation and make safe both southern\r\ninstitutions and the union. Generally Stephens was far superior to Toombs\r\nin forecast and discernment of the sentiment of the masses. But while the\r\nformer was too wise to consider even for one moment the probabilities of\r\npeaceable secession, he had a most un-American conviction that nothing\r\ngood was ever gained by war, and he so loved peace and the union that he\r\ncould not believe his people would secede. In his great sympathies Toombs\r\nwas here far more clear-sighted. While he was the only speaker in this\r\npresidential campaign that was disrespectful to the union, often calling\r\nit in derision \"the gullorious,\" and he gave no promise that withdrawal\r\nfrom the union would be peaceful, and so appeared to be to himself and\r\nalone, he was really the only one riding the waves of the undercurrent\r\nrising every day nearer the surface, and soon to sweep all of us onward\r\nupon its raging waters. The other speakers discussed the rival platforms,\r\nbut the nearer election day approached the more potently he was preparing\r\nthe people and himself for secession, though unawares to both. And when\r\nLincoln was elected,--the man who had solemnly published his belief that\r\nthis government could not endure permanently part slave and part free,--an\r\noccurrence which aroused the south throughout as the firing upon Fort\r\nSumter afterwards aroused the north, Toombs drank in every accession to\r\nthe emotion of his people, and towered more largely before them every day\r\nas the soul of the revolution now palpable in its coming to all. When\r\nsecession was debated before the Georgia legislature, after enumerating\r\nwhat he declared to be the wrongs of the south, he said, \"I ask you to\r\ngive me the sword; for if you do not give it to me, as God lives, I will\r\ntake it myself.\" In his immortal eulogy of the union the next night,\r\nStephens quoted these words, and Toombs, who was present, answered in a\r\nvoice of thunder, \"I will.\" The house rocked to and fro with frenzied\r\napplause. Long afterwards Stephens told me that this outburst was the\r\nfirst revealing sign to him that his people were rushing to war. He lost\r\nhis breath while gasping out the awful word, and there was terror in his\r\nlooks as if the direful ghost had risen again. Some ardent secessionists\r\nprofessed themselves ready to drink all the blood that would be spilled,\r\nbut Toombs, in his warlike nature, was already revelling in the joy of\r\nfighting for his people in this most sacred of causes. In one of his\r\nspeeches he eulogized beforehand those who were to fall in defence of the\r\nsouth, giving them the requiem of sleeping forever where\r\n\r\n  \"Honor guards with solemn round\r\n  The silent bivouac of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nI did not hear this, but a friend told me that the speaker's electric\r\nrecitative made the hackneyed words forever new and fresh to him.\r\n\r\nI must go faster. January 7, 1861, Toombs made in the United States senate\r\nhis famous defence of secession. He presented in behalf of the south these\r\ndemands expressed in writing:\r\n\r\n1. Any person to be permitted to settle in any Territory, with any of his\r\nproperty, including slaves, and be protected in his property till such\r\nTerritory is admitted as a State on an equality with the other States,\r\nwith or without slavery as its people may determine.\r\n\r\n2. Property in slaves to receive everywhere from the United States\r\ngovernment the same protection which under the constitution it can give\r\nany other property, it being reserved to each State to deal with slavery\r\nwithin its limits as it pleases.\r\n\r\n3. Extradition of persons committing crimes against slave property, as\r\ncommanded by the constitution.\r\n\r\n4. Extradition of fugitive slaves as commanded by the same constitution.\r\n\r\n5. Congress to pass efficient laws punishing all persons aiding or\r\nabetting invasion of a State or insurrection therein, or committing any\r\nother act against the law of nations that tends to disturb the\r\ntranquillity of the people or government of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly evident to the unprejudiced that he had the warrant of the\r\nconstitution, the law of nations, of the practice and professions of the\r\ngreat body of even northern citizens ever since the adoption of the\r\nconstitution, for every one of these demands. It is also as plainly\r\nevident that every one was vital to each southern community, founded as it\r\nwas from basement to roof, upon property in slaves. The justice of his\r\ndemands could not be denied without repudiating the constitution, the law\r\nof nations, and the solemn compacts of the fathers, their children and\r\nchildren's children. And providence had really made each one of these\r\nastounding repudiations, in her purpose to extirpate slavery as the only\r\nmenace to the American union, even if the people so dear to Toombs must be\r\nall cast out of their prosperity and comfort into beggary. But when a man\r\nis fighting for his loved ones,--especially if he is fighting for his\r\ncountry,--and he has the valor of Toombs, his not-to-be-shaken conviction\r\nis that providence is on his side, and the nearer great disaster\r\napproaches, the stouter becomes his heart. Toombs's support of his\r\ndemands, and his defence of what he knew the south would do if they were\r\nrefused, are the most earnest words he ever spoke. Note these paragraphs:\r\n\r\n    \"You cannot intimidate my constituents by talking to them about\r\n    treason. They are ready to fight for the right with the rope around\r\n    their necks.\"\r\n\r\n    \"You not only want to break down our constitutional rights; you not\r\n    only want to upturn our social system; your people not only steal our\r\n    slaves and make them freemen to vote against us; but you seek to\r\n    bring an inferior race into a condition of equality, socially and\r\n    politically, with our own people. The question of slavery moves not\r\n    the people of Georgia one half as much as the fact that you insult\r\n    their rights as a community. You abolitionists are right when you say\r\n    that there are thousands and ten thousands of men in Georgia, and all\r\n    over the south, who do not own slaves. A very large portion of the\r\n    people of Georgia own none of them. In the mountains there are\r\n    comparatively few of them; but no part of our people are more loyal to\r\n    their race and country than our brave mountain population; and every\r\n    flash of the electric wires brings me cheering news from our mountain\r\n    tops and our valleys that these sons of Georgia are excelled by none\r\n    of their countrymen in loyalty to the rights, the honor, and the glory\r\n    of the commonwealth. They say, and well say, this is our question; we\r\n    want no negro equality, no negro citizenship; we want no mongrel race\r\n    to degrade our own; and as one man they would meet you upon the\r\n    border, with the sword in one hand and the torch in the other. We will\r\n    tell you when we choose to abolish this thing; it must be done under\r\n    our direction, and according to our will; our own, our native land\r\n    shall determine this question, and not the abolitionists of the north.\r\n    That is the spirit of our freemen.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the grand conclusion:\r\n\r\n    \"This man, Brown, and his accomplices, had sympathizers. Who were\r\n    they? One who was, according to his public speeches, his defender and\r\n    laudator, is governor of Massachusetts. Other officials of that State\r\n    applauded Brown's heroism, magnified his courage, and no doubt\r\n    lamented his ill success. Throughout the whole north, public meetings,\r\n    immense gatherings, triumphal processions, the honors of the hero and\r\n    conqueror, were awarded to this incendiary and assassin. They did not\r\n    condemn the traitor; think you they abhorred the treason?\r\n\r\n    Yet ... when a distinguished senator from a non-slaveholding State\r\n    proposed to punish such attempts at invasion and insurrection, Lincoln\r\n    and his party say before the world, 'Here is a sedition law.' To carry\r\n    out the constitution, to protect States from invasion and suppress\r\n    insurrection therein, to comply with the laws of the United States is\r\n    a 'sedition law,' and the chief of this party treats it with contempt;\r\n    yet, under the very same clause of the constitution which warranted\r\n    this bill, you derive your power to punish offences against the law of\r\n    nations. Under this warrant you have tried and punished our citizens\r\n    for meditating the invasion of foreign States; you have stopped\r\n    illegal expeditions; you have denounced our citizens engaged therein\r\n    as pirates and commended them to the bloody vengeance of a merciless\r\n    enemy. Under this principle alone you protect our weaker neighbors of\r\n    Cuba, Honduras, and Nicaragua. By this alone are we empowered and\r\n    bound to prevent our people from conspiring together, giving aid,\r\n    money, or arms to fit out expeditions against a foreign nation.\r\n    Foreign nations get the benefit of this protection; but we are worse\r\n    off in the union than if we were out of it. Out of it we should have\r\n    the protection of the neutrality laws. Now you can come among us;\r\n    raids may be made; you may put the incendiary torch to our dwellings,\r\n    as you did last summer for hundreds of miles on the frontier of Texas;\r\n    you may do what John Brown did, and when the miscreants escape to your\r\n    States you will not punish them, you will not deliver them up.\r\n    Therefore, we stand defenceless. We must cut loose from the accursed\r\n    'body of this death,' even to get the benefit of the law of nations.\r\n\r\n    You will not regard confederate obligations; you will not regard\r\n    constitutional obligations; you will not regard your oaths. What,\r\n    then, am I to do? Am I a freeman? Is my State a free State? We are\r\n    freemen. We have rights; I have stated them. We have wrongs; I have\r\n    recounted them. I have demonstrated that the party now coming into\r\n    power has declared us outlaws, and is determined to exclude thousands\r\n    of millions of our property from the common Territories, that it has\r\n    declared us under the ban of the union, and out of the protection of\r\n    the law of the United States everywhere. They have refused to protect\r\n    us by the federal power from invasion and insurrection, and the\r\n    constitution denies to us in the union the right either to raise\r\n    fleets or armies for our defence. All these charges I have proved by\r\n    the record; and I put them before the civilized world and demand the\r\n    judgment of to-day, of to-morrow, of distant ages and of heaven\r\n    itself, upon the justice of these causes. I am content, whatever may\r\n    be the event, to peril all in so noble, so holy a cause. We have\r\n    appealed time and time again for these constitutional rights. You have\r\n    refused them. We appeal again. Restore us these rights as we had them,\r\n    as your court adjudges them to be just as our people have said they\r\n    are; redress these flagrant wrongs, seen of all men, and it will\r\n    restore fraternity and peace and unity to all of us. Refuse them, and\r\n    what, then? We shall ask you, 'Let us depart in peace.' Refuse that,\r\n    and you present us war. We accept it; and inscribing upon our banners\r\n    the glorious words 'Liberty and Equality,' we will trust to the blood\r\n    of the brave and the God of battles for security and tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nNo new nation about to be launched upon a sea of blood was ever heralded\r\nwith words that were above these in appeal to the conscience and strongest\r\naffections of humanity. They are not outvied by those of Patrick Henry\r\nreported by Wirt, or those of John Adams reported by Webster, which the\r\nworld will ever treasure as all gold. O that he had corrected them! He\r\ncould not use the file, as we have already said.\r\n\r\nSoon after making the speech he went away from the senate without taking\r\nleave. March 14, 1861, that body passed a resolution reciting that the\r\nseats before occupied by Brown, Davis, Mallory, Clay, Toombs, and Benjamin\r\nhad become vacant, and directing that the secretary omit their names from\r\nthe roll.\r\n\r\nIt was clear from his incomparable and faultless leadership of the active\r\ndefence of the south, and his unique ability in affairs, that he was the\r\nchoice of the directors of southern nationalization for president of the\r\nConfederate States; but these were overcome by stronger spirits, and Davis\r\nwas made president. I have always believed that Toombs regarded this as\r\nthe great miscarriage of his life. He could not continue his connection\r\nwith the unbusinesslike conduct of the administration, and he retired from\r\nhis secretaryship of state. Read what his superiors say of him at\r\nSharpsburg, and what Dick Taylor with admiration tells of the help he\r\nafterwards got from him in a dark hour, as specimens of his gallantry and\r\nefficiency in the service. But his was not the nature of Epaminondas, to\r\ndoff his natural supereminence and sweep the streets. Pegasus did not show\r\nmore unsuited to the plow than he did to his inferior station in this\r\nstage of the great conflict which was his meat and drink.\r\n\r\nThe collapse came, flight from America, return at last to his stricken\r\npeople, and disability for the rest of his life. Though he had something\r\nof even a great career at the bar, and in State politics, his longing for\r\nthe old south and discontent with the new increased, slowly at first, then\r\nfaster and faster. As infirmity from age came on apace, and his wife whom\r\nhe had always made his good angel went to heaven, every day he became more\r\nlonely. He had survived _his_ country. Such love as his for that loves but\r\nonce and always. The sacrifices that he had made for it became his\r\ntreasures. He hugged his disability as his most precious jewel. Our\r\ngallant Gordon was not more proud of the scars on his face. Not long\r\nbefore his mind and memory were failing, speaking of the past, he said\r\nwith the utmost firmness: \"I regret nothing but the dead and the failure.\r\n\r\n  'Better to have struck and lost,\r\n  Than never to have struck at all.'\"\r\n\r\nWhat a fall! Greater by far than Lucifer's. Lucifer was rightfully cast\r\nout because of heinous offence. But Toombs was cashiered because he had\r\nbeen the best, ablest, and most faithful servant of his people, whose\r\ndearest rights were in jeopardy. According to our merely human view it is\r\nthe way of fiends to reward such supremacy in virtue and achievement with\r\nhell pains. If we cannot hope confidently, may not we survivors at least\r\nsend up sincere prayers that the Lord will yet give this Job of the old\r\nsouth twice as much of fair fame as he had before.\r\n\r\nIf the defeated in the wars between England and Scotland and in the\r\nEnglish civil wars; and if Cromwell and the regicides who set up a\r\ngovernment that had to fall,--if all these have found respectful and fully\r\nappreciative mention at last, why shall not Calhoun and Toombs look to\r\nhave the same after some years be passed? Trusting that such will come, I\r\nclose this sketch by suggesting where Toombs will, I think, be niched in\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\nHe is often spoken of as the southern correspondence to Wendell Phillips.\r\nThere was nothing whatever in common between the two except extraordinary\r\nfluency of zealous speech. Early in life, Phillips, almost a mere boy,\r\nbroke with Mrs. Grundy by advocating abolition before his neighbors were\r\nripe for it. While Toombs cared nothing for Mrs. Grundy, he always so\r\ncomported himself that he was her great authority. He was a very able\r\nlawyer, who had made a considerable fortune by practice, and a thorough\r\nstatesman, when fate confided the southern lead to him; and while Phillips\r\nwas reckless and rash, Toombs never, never essayed the impossible with his\r\npeople. The more you balance him and Phillips against each other, the more\r\nunlike you will find them. Prof. William Garrott Brown is quite correct in\r\npairing Phillips and Yancey.\r\n\r\nThere is a northern character to whom Toombs as a southern opposite\r\ncorresponds in so many important particulars that it surprises me it has\r\nnot been proclaimed. As Webster was the special apostle of the\r\npreservation of the union, Toombs was the same of secession. Their\r\nmissions were parallel in that each one was the foremost champion of his\r\nnationality, Webster of the Pan-American, as we may call it; and Toombs of\r\nthe southern. All through the brothers' war their phrases were on the lips\r\nand fired the hearts of each host, those of Webster impelling to fight for\r\nthe union, those of Toombs for the southern confederacy. Each was probably\r\nthe ablest lawyer of his day. Each was surely the ablest debater to be\r\nfound. Each was of sublime courage in defying what he thought to be unjust\r\ncommands of his constituents. And the last point which I think of is that\r\neach was of most complete and perfect physical development, and was the\r\nmost majestic presence of his day. The busiest men in the streets of all\r\nsorts and ranks always found time to look upon either Webster or Toombs as\r\nhe passed, and admire. I never saw Webster. But I believe that from his\r\npictures, from long study of his best speeches, and from what I have\r\ngreedily read and heard of him in a fond lifelong contemplation, I have an\r\nalmost perfect figure of him before my mind's eye. Toombs from my boyhood\r\nI saw often. I will describe him as I observed him at the hustings just\r\nbefore the war. His face, almost as large as a shield, but yet not out of\r\nproportion, was in continual play from the sweetest smile of approval to\r\nthe scowl of condemnation, darkening all around like a rising\r\nthundercloud. His flowing locks tossed to and fro over his massive brow\r\nlike a lion's mane, as was universally said. In every attitude and gesture\r\nthere was a spontaneous and lofty grace--not the grace of the\r\ndancing-master, but the ease and repose of native nobility. His face was\r\nnot Greek, but in his total he looked the extreme of classic symmetry and\r\nthe utmost of power of mind, will, and act. Princely, royal, kingly, even\r\ngodlike, were the words spontaneously uttered with which men tried in vain\r\nto tell what they saw in him. He and just one other were the only men of\r\nmy observation whose greatness, without their saying a word, spoke plainly\r\neven to strangers. That other man was Lee. I noted, when we were near\r\nChambersburg in Pennsylvania those three or four days before the great\r\nbattle, that, while the natives would curiously inquire the names of\r\nothers of our generals as they rode by, every one instantaneously\r\nrecognized Lee as soon as he came near. This publication of her chosen in\r\ntheir mere outside which destiny makes is not to be slighted nor\r\nunderprized. And so remember that Webster looked the greatest of all men\r\nof the north, and Toombs the greatest of all men of the south.\r\n\r\nTo my mind I give each unsurpassable praise and glory when I call Webster\r\nthe northern Toombs and Toombs the southern Webster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI add a note by way of epilogue. I observe with pain that the obloquy\r\nagainst Toombs in the north seems to increase, while that against him in\r\nthe rising generation of the south--who do not know him at all--is surely\r\nincreasing. It is, however, a growing consolation to me to note that every\r\ncharge, currently made against him north or south, is founded either upon\r\ncomplete mistake of fact or the grossest misunderstanding of his character\r\nand career. It is a duty of mine not only to him as my dead and revered\r\nfriend, but a high duty to my country, to set him in his right place in\r\nthe galaxy of America's best and greatest. I never knew a man of kinder or\r\nmore benevolent heart; nor one who had more horror of fraud, unfairness,\r\nand trick; nor one whiter in all money transactions; nor one whose\r\nlonging and zeal for the welfare of neighbors and country were greater;\r\nnor one who showed in his whole life more regard for the rights and also\r\nthe innocent wishes of everybody. The model men of the church, such as Dr.\r\nMell and Bishop George Pierce, loved him with a fond and cherishing love.\r\nThe humblest and plainest men were attracted to him, and they gave him\r\nsincere adulation. Many of my contemporaries remember rough old Tom\r\nAlexander, the railroad contractor. I saw him one day in a lively talk\r\nwith Toombs. As he passed my seat while leaving the car he whispered to\r\nme: \"Bob Toombs! his brain is as big as a barrel and his heart is as big\r\nas a hogshead.\" From 1867 until 1881 I was often engaged in the same cases\r\nwith Toombs, either as associate or opposing counsel, and I saw a great\r\ndeal of him. It falls far short to say that he was the most entertaining\r\nman I ever knew. He was just as wise in judgment as he was original and\r\nstriking in speech. I am sure that his superiority as a lawyer towered\r\nhigher in the consultation room just before the trial than even in his\r\nable court conduct. And he led just as wisely and preeminently in the\r\npolitics of that day, when it was vital to the civilization of the south\r\nto nullify the fifteenth amendment. Georgia would indeed be an ungrateful\r\nrepublic should she forget his part in the constitution of 1877. That was\r\ndeliverance from the unspeakable disgrace of nine years--a constitution\r\nmade by ignorant negroes, also criminals who, to use the words of Ben\r\nHill, sprang at one bound from State prisons into the constitutional\r\nconvention, and some native deserters of the white race--the constitution\r\nso made kept riveted around our necks by the bayonet. The good work would\r\nhave remained undone for many years had not Toombs advanced $20,000 to\r\nkeep the convention, which had exhausted its appropriation, in session\r\nlong enough to finish our own constitution. The railroad commission\r\nestablished by that instrument is really his doing. This post-bellum\r\npolitical career of his, in which he restored his stricken State to her\r\nautonomy and self-respect, has not yet won its full appreciation.\r\n\r\nIf Toombs could but be delineated to the life in his extempore action,\r\nadvice, and phrase he would soon attain a lofty station in world\r\nliterature. It mattered not what he was talking about,--an affair of\r\nbusiness or of other importance, communicating information, telling an\r\nexperience, complimenting a girl, disporting himself in the maddest\r\nmerriment, as he often did after some great accomplishment,--his language\r\nflashed all the while with a planet-like brilliancy, and the matter was of\r\na piece. Those of us who hang over Martial, how we learn to admire his\r\nperpetual freshness and variety! But when we compare him with Catullus,\r\nhis master, we note that while his epigram is always splendid, the\r\nlanguage is commonplace beside that of the other.[110] Toombs was even\r\nmore than Martial in exhaustless productivity and unhackneyed point, and\r\nhis words always reflected, like those of Catullus, the hues of Paradise.\r\nPerhaps a reader exclaims, \"As I do not know Martial and Catullus your\r\ncomparison is nothing to me.\" Well, I tell him that I have read Shakspeare\r\nfrom lid to lid more times than I can say, and that I have long been close\r\nfriends with every one of his characters, all the way from Lear, Othello,\r\nHamlet, and Macbeth at the top, down to his immortal clowns at the bottom.\r\nSurely with this experience it can be said of me, \"The man has seen some\r\nmajesty.\" I have often tried, and that with the help of a few intimates\r\nalmost as deeply read in Shakspeare as myself, to find in the dainty plays\r\nan equal to Toombs throwing away everywhere around him with infinite\r\nprodigality gems of unpremeditated wisdom and phrase. Samuel Barnett,\r\nLinton Stephens, Henry Andrews and my cousin, his wife, Samuel Lumpkin,\r\nand S. H. Hardeman, all of whom knew him well, were among these. The end\r\nof every effort would be our agreement that Shakspeare himself could\r\nhardly have made an adequately faithful representation of Toombs.\r\n\r\nThe mental torture of the last three or four years of his life I must\r\ntouch upon again. The most active anti-slavery partisan and most scarred\r\nsoldier of the union will compassionate if he but contemplate. I met him\r\nonly now and then. As I read his feelings--one eye quenched by cataract\r\nand the other failing fast; his contemporaries of the bar and political\r\narena dead; the wife whom he loved better than he did himself sinking\r\nunder a disease gradually destroying her mind; ever harrowed with the\r\nthought that his country was no more, and that he was a foreigner and\r\nexile in the spot which he had always called home,--though I was full of\r\nincreasing joy over the benefit of emancipation to my people and gladness\r\nat the promise of reunited America, my tranquillity would take flight\r\nwhenever he came into my mind. He was that spectacle of a good man in a\r\nhopeless struggle against fate that moves enemies to pity. To me his last\r\nstate was more tragic and pathetic than that of Oedipus.\r\n\r\nOf course his powers were declining. I know that he would never have drank\r\ntoo much if there had been no sectional agitation, secession, war, nor\r\nreconstruction. His appetite was never that insane thirst, as I have heard\r\nhim call it, which impels one into delirium tremens. He always\r\ndisappointed his adversaries at the bar calculating that drink would\r\ndisable him at an important part of the conduct. Others as well as myself\r\ncan testify to this. Near the end he deliberately chose to drain full cups\r\nof purpose to sweeten bitter memories. With moderation he had more\r\nassurance of longevity than any other of his generation; and he would, I\r\nverily believe, have been green and flourishing in his hundredth year. He\r\nlost his rare faculty of managing money. It was a shock of surprise to me\r\nwhen the fire in August, 1883, disclosed that he had let the insurance of\r\nhis interest in the Kimball house run out shortly before. It was a\r\npitiable sight to see him in his growing blindness and wasting frame armed\r\nby his negro servant along the streets of Atlanta in his last visits to\r\nthe place. During all this time he was dying by inches.\r\n\r\nBut the sun going down behind heavy clouds would now and then send forth\r\nrays of the old glory. It was in May, 1883, during the session of the\r\nsuperior court of Wilkes, where I had some of my old business to wind up,\r\nthat I was last in his house. He had made invitations to dinner without\r\nkeeping account. At the hour his sitting-room was densely packed. A few of\r\nus were late. When we arrived many were compounding their drinks. He\r\nhospitably suggested to us new-comers that there was still some standing\r\nroom around the sideboard. In a little while the throng was treading the\r\nwell-known way to the dining-hall, which we overflowed so suddenly that\r\nhis niece, whom Mrs. Toombs, then keeping her room, had charged with\r\nseeing the table laid, was astounded to find she could not seat all of the\r\nbidden guests. Just as her flurry was beginning to make us uncomfortable\r\nour host entered. In spite of his infirmity and purblindness he took in\r\nthe situation with his wonted quickness. He said in a tone of tender\r\nremonstrance to his niece, \"O, I do not object to having more friends\r\nthan room; it is usually the other way in this world.\" And with despatch\r\nand order he had the surplus given seats at side tables. My eyes\r\nmoistened. I had an unhappy presentiment that this was my last observation\r\nof the only man I ever knew whose fine acts and words never waited when\r\noccasion called. I was aroused by the whisper of a neighbor, \"Can any one\r\nelse in the world do such a beautiful thing on the spur of the moment?\"\r\nThe admiring looks that followed inspired him, and his talk seemed to have\r\nmore than its old lustre and gleam.\r\n\r\nIn his final illness, when paralysis was slowly creeping up his frame, and\r\nhe had lost the sense of place and time, he would now and then start from\r\nhis stupor and send across the State a bolt from the bow which no other\r\ncould bend. Somebody spoke of a late meeting of \"prohibition fanatics.\"\r\n\"Do you know what is a fanatic?\" he asked unexpectedly. \"No,\" was replied.\r\n\"He is one of strong feelings and weak points,\" Toombs explained. And\r\noverhearing another say that an unusually prolonged session of the State\r\nlegislature had not yet come to an end, he exclaimed with urgency, \"Send\r\nfor Cromwell!\"\r\n\r\nHe died December 15, 1885, in his seventy-sixth year.\r\n\r\nIf I have told the truth in this chapter,--and God knows I have tried my\r\nutmost to tell it,--ought not my brothers and sisters of each section to\r\nlay aside their angry prejudices and bestow at last upon the only and\r\npeerless Toombs the love and admiration which are the due reward of his\r\nvirtues, his towering example, his wonder-striking achievements, and his\r\nincomparable genius? May that power which incessantly makes for\r\nrighteousness, and which always in the end has charity to conquer hate,\r\nsoon bring to us who really knew him our dearest wish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHELP TO THE UNION CAUSE BY POWERS IN THE UNSEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not balked by adherence, either to the rapidly waning\r\noverpositiveness of materialism, or to the ferocious orthodoxy which\r\ndenies that there has been any providential interference in human affairs\r\nsince that told of in the bible; and if you are exempt from the fear of\r\nbeing regarded as superstitious which keeps a great number of even the\r\nmost cultivated people forever in a fever of incredulity as to every\r\nexample of what they call the supernatural, you have long since become\r\nconvinced that evolution is intelligently guided by some power or powers\r\nin the unseen. I seem to myself to discern plainly in many important\r\ncrises of history the palpable influence of what are to me the directors\r\nof evolution. Washington, to found our great federation, and Lincoln to\r\nperpetuate it--these come at once as examples. Now follow me while I try\r\nto show you what the directors did in preparation for and in conduct of\r\nthe brothers' war, of purpose that the north should triumph and save the\r\nunion. Of course I am precluded from all attempt to be exhaustive. I shall\r\nonly glance at a few of the facts that appear to me cardinal and most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they deferred the war until under the effect of\r\nforeign immigration the population of the north greatly outnumbered that\r\nof the south and had become almost unanimous against slavery; and until\r\nthe south was almost entirely dependent upon her railroads and her river\r\nand ocean commerce. Had secession occurred because of the excitement over\r\nthe application of Missouri for admission into the union with a slave\r\nconstitution, there might have been a war, but it would have been short,\r\nthe end being that every foot of the public domain admitting of profitable\r\nslave culture would have fallen to the south. Suppose a serious effort had\r\nbeen made in 1833 to collect the revenue in South Carolina, how long would\r\nthe south have endured invasion of the little State and slaughter of its\r\ncitizens? Even President Jackson would have soon forgotten his enmity to\r\nCalhoun and recognized that blood is thicker than water. The time was not\r\nthen ripe, as the directors saw; and so they effected an adjustment of the\r\ncontroversy. It did not suit the directors to have the war commence in\r\n1850, for there was at the time no general use of ironclads, and the\r\nrailroad system was far from completion. Consider for a moment the\r\nadvantage to the north of having gunboats and the disadvantage to the\r\nsouth of not having them. Fort Donelson really fell because of gunboats.\r\nGrant got re-enforcements in time to save him from disastrous defeat at\r\nShiloh because of the command of the river by gunboats. The gunboats\r\ncaused the fall of Vicksburg. And it was the holding of the James from its\r\nmouth to Fort Darling by gunboats which gave Grant such secure grip at\r\nPetersburg that Richmond had to fall at last, and with it the confederacy.\r\n\r\nNow a word as to the southern railroads. Next to the navigable rivers they\r\nwere the lines of easiest penetration to invaders. Remember how the\r\nBritish in 1898 advanced in Africa only as they completed their railroad\r\nbehind them. Of course had the railroad been already made their advance\r\nwould have been along it. How could Sherman have ever crossed the\r\ndevastated tract from Dalton to Atlanta had he been without the railroad\r\nbehind him? During his retreat Johnston kept the invading army between\r\nhimself and the railroad without which it could not have been subsisted,\r\nand staid so close that Sherman had him constantly in view; conduct which\r\nis still lauded by some people in the south as masterly beyond compare.\r\n\r\nTo conceive more vividly the river and railroad situation which I am\r\nstriving to explain, suppose that during the Revolutionary war the States\r\nhad been as dependent as the south afterwards became upon rivers and\r\nrailroads, and the British had and the Americans did not have iron-clad\r\ngunboats; as matters now look, our forefathers would have been beaten back\r\nto the foot of the throne. I believe that the railroads alone would have\r\nrendered their subjugation certain.\r\n\r\nSo much for the matchless judgment shown by the directors in deciding as\r\nto the time of the war. I shall now tell what I have long thought is most\r\nunmistakably their work in conducting that war.\r\n\r\nAs soon as secession was an accomplished fact, they deprived the better\r\nsouthern statesmanship of all guidance of the brothers' war now inevitable\r\nand about to begin. In such a war a proper executive is of far more\r\nimportance than good legislators and even good generals. Toombs was the\r\nman who stood forth head and shoulders above all others as the logical\r\npresident of the southern confederacy. But the wily directors hypnotized\r\nthe electors into believing that Davis, because of his military education,\r\nservice in Mexico, and four years' secretaryship of war, was the right\r\nman. It is generally believed in the south that the considerations just\r\nmentioned turned the scale in favor of Davis. But sometimes I think that\r\nthe true explanation is different. Stephens has told how Toombs was got\r\nout of the way. When this narrative[111] was published, both Toombs and\r\nDavis, with many of the partisans of each were alive, and regard for them\r\nmay have kept him silent as to a reported mischance to Toombs, which\r\nprovoking opposition--as was whispered--from some of those who had been\r\namong his most earnest supporters, decided him to retire. A biographer\r\nwrites: \"There was a story, credited in some quarters, that Mr. Toombs's\r\nconvivial conduct at a dinner party in Montgomery estranged from him some\r\nof the more conservative delegates, who did not realize that a man like\r\nToombs had versatile and reserved powers, and that Toombs at the banquet\r\nboard was another sort of a man from Toombs in a deliberative body.\"[112]\r\n\r\nSomething like that stated in the quotation just made did happen, as\r\nStephens was wont to relate at Liberty Hall--the name which he gave his\r\nhospitable home at Crawfordville, Georgia. I was present more than once at\r\nsuch times.\r\n\r\nSuch could have been the work of the directors.\r\n\r\nGeorgia, being the pivotal State of the new federation, was by many\r\nconceded the presidency. Besides Toombs she had two other men, far abler\r\nstatesmen than Davis and then as conspicuous in the public eye--A. H.\r\nStephens and Howell Cobb. The election of either one of these would really\r\nhave been the same almost as the election of Toombs, for the three were in\r\ncomplete accord, and Toombs was the natural and actual leader. So great\r\nwas their fealty to him that neither one could have been induced to stand\r\nfor the place after he had missed it. The directors saw to it that neither\r\none of the three should be president of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\nSuppose that Toombs--or that either Stephens or Cobb--had been made\r\npresident, what a different conduct there would have been of the war.\r\nBesides being the foremost statesman of the south, Toombs was its very\r\nablest man of affairs, and as far superior to Davis in practical and\r\nbusiness talent as a trained and experienced man is to an untrained and\r\ninexperienced woman. Not intending to disparage the other great\r\nqualifications of Toombs, I must emphasize it that of all his\r\ncontemporaries he alone evinced a clear understanding of the principles\r\naccording to which the confederate currency could have been better managed\r\nthan were the greenbacks by the other side. A letter of his during the war\r\nto Mr. James Gardner, of Augusta, Georgia, published at the time in the\r\npaper of which the latter was then editor, shows insight and grasp of the\r\nsubject equal to Ricardo's. Toombs as president of the confederacy would\r\nhave had congress enact proper currency measures. When he was in place to\r\nadvise and lead, his influence exceeded by far that of any other man that\r\nI ever knew.\r\n\r\nBut this, important as it is, is far from being the most important. He and\r\nStephens were fully convinced at the very first of the overruling\r\nimportance to the confederacy of these two things: (1) to make full use of\r\ncotton as a resource; (2) to prevent a blockade of the southern ports. I\r\nmake these extracts following from a speech of Stephens's at\r\nCrawfordville, Georgia, November 1, 1862:\r\n\r\n    \"What I said at Sparta, Georgia, upon the subject of cotton, many of\r\n    you have often heard me say in private conversation, and most of you\r\n    in the public speech last year to which I have alluded. Cotton, I have\r\n    maintained, and do maintain, is one of the greatest elements of power,\r\n    if not the greatest at our command, if it were but properly and\r\n    efficiently used, as it might have been, and still might be. Samson's\r\n    strength was in his locks. Our strength is in our locks of cotton. I\r\n    believed from the beginning that the enemy would inflict upon us more\r\n    serious injury by the blockade than by all other means combined. It\r\n    was ... a matter of the utmost ... importance to have it raised. How\r\n    was it to be done?... I thought it ... could be done through the\r\n    agency of cotton.... I was in favor, as you know, of the government's\r\n    taking all the cotton that would be subscribed for eight per cent\r\n    bonds at a rate or price as high as ten cents a pound. Two millions of\r\n    the last year's crop might have been counted upon as certain on this\r\n    plan. This, at ten cents, with bags of the average commercial weight,\r\n    would have cost the government one hundred millions of bonds. With\r\n    this amount of cotton in hand and pledged, any number, short of fifty,\r\n    of the best ironclad steamers could have been contracted for and built\r\n    in Europe--steamers at the cost of two millions each, could have been\r\n    procured, equal in every way to the 'Monitor.' Thirty millions would\r\n    have got fifteen of these, which might have been enough for our\r\n    purpose. Five might have been ready by the first of January last to\r\n    open some one of the ports blockaded on our coast. Three of these\r\n    could have been left to keep the port open, and two could have\r\n    conveyed the cotton across the water if necessary. Thus, the debt\r\n    could have been promptly paid with cotton at a much higher price than\r\n    it cost, and a channel of trade kept open till other ironclads, and as\r\n    many as were necessary, might have been built and paid for in the same\r\n    way. At a cost of less than one month's present expenditure on our\r\n    army, our coast might have been cleared. Besides this, at least two\r\n    more millions of bales of the old crop on hand might have been counted\r\n    upon--this with the other making a debt in round numbers to the\r\n    planters of $200,000,000. But this cotton, held in Europe until its\r\n    price became fifty cents a pound, would constitute a fund of at least\r\n    $1,000,000,000 which would not only have kept our finances in sound\r\n    condition, but the clear profit of $800,000,000 would have met the\r\n    entire expenses of the war for years to come.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe reader who carefully reflects over the passage just quoted may well\r\nthink that the extravagant profit pictured savors more of Mulberry Sellers\r\nthan of a cool-headed statesman; but if the war price of cotton be\r\nrecalled he readily agrees that under the plan proposed the south could\r\neasily have got a fleet of the best ironclads. Such a fleet would have\r\nkept the southern ports open. The advantage of which would have been very\r\ngreat. It would have held the Mississippi from the first, or have\r\nrecovered it after the capture of New Orleans. It would have cleared the\r\ngunboats out of all the navigable rivers in the south. And we must not\r\nforget how it might have ravaged the northern coast, perhaps capturing New\r\nYork, and forcing an early peace.\r\n\r\nI must make you see the greatness of cotton as a resource. There has been\r\nfrom soon after the invention of the gin a steadily increasing world\r\ndemand for it, and the south has practically monopolized its production. I\r\ncan think of no other product of the soil except wine and liquor that is\r\nas imperishable. But wine and liquor spill, leak, and evaporate, while\r\ncotton does neither. If you but safe it against fire it will not\r\ndeteriorate by age. In 1884 I was told of a sale just made of some cotton\r\nfor which the owner had refused the famine price in 1865. It brought the\r\nmarket price of the day, and experts said it sampled as well as new\r\ncotton. It was at least 19 years old. Wine and liquor cannot be\r\ncompressed, but the same weight of raw cotton becomes less and less bulky\r\nevery year. By reason of the foregoing, cotton is always the equivalent of\r\ncash in hand. Now add the effect of the steadily growing war scarcity, and\r\nremember how easy it was during the first two years of the war to carry\r\nout cotton in spite of the blockade. The European purchasing agent of the\r\nConfederate States government says \"it possessed a latent purchasing\r\npower such as probably no other ... in history ever had.\"[114] He means\r\ncotton. There were several million bales of it in the confederacy, all of\r\nwhich could be had for the taking--much of it for merely the asking. And\r\nthere were a legion of carriers eager to run the blockade. I cannot\r\nunderstand how Professor Brown could have ever written, \"The government\r\nhad not the means either to buy the cotton or to transport it.\"[115]\r\nSurely the government could have seized the cotton as easily as it did all\r\nthe men of military age, and collected the tithes in kind.\r\n\r\nIf Toombs had been president of the southern confederacy, the very best\r\npossible use of its cotton as a resource would have been made. At the\r\ntime, if but managed with the financial skill which he always showed, that\r\ncotton would have been a great war chest in a secure place, always full\r\nand appreciating. It is very probable that almost at the beginning of the\r\nwar the confederacy would have struck terror into its adversaries with\r\nsome warships far superior to any with which the United States could have\r\nthen supplied itself. In this case there never would have been any\r\nMonitor. And the south would have had all the benefits of wise husbandry\r\nand conduct.\r\n\r\nDuring his short premiership of the confederacy Toombs showed marked\r\nability. Note his extraordinary insight when instructing the\r\ncommissioners, that \"So long as the United States neither declares war nor\r\nestablishes peace, the Confederate States have the advantage of both\r\nconditions;\" and consider how accurately he foresaw that the north would\r\nbe rallied as one man to the stars and stripes by attack upon Fort Sumter,\r\nand how earnestly he opposed the proposed attack.[116]\r\n\r\nStephens was thoroughly against the policy of many pitched battles. He\r\ncounselled from the very first that we should draw the invaders within our\r\nterritory, where, having them far from their base and taking advantage of\r\nour shorter interior lines, we could when the right moment came, by\r\nattacking with superior numbers, virtually destroy their entire army. The\r\nmore I think over it, the more clearly I see that this was the true way\r\nfor us to have fought. Stephens's influence would have been so great with\r\nToombs or Cobb as president that he would have shaped the conduct of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThere would have been no keeping of inefficient men in high command; and\r\nno efficient one would have been kept out. Mr. Lincoln would have had an\r\nexecutive rival worthy of his steel. As the former searched diligently and\r\nwith rare judgment for his commander-in-chief and at last found him in\r\nGrant, so Toombs would in all probability have found the proper southern\r\ngeneral in the west. It would have been Forrest. The marvellous military\r\ngenius of this illiterate man, who at the beginning of the war could not\r\nhave put a recruit through the manual of arms, showed him far superior to\r\nhis superiors who sacrificed the southern army at Fort Donelson. The\r\nlieutenant-colonel would not surrender, and his escape with his entire\r\ncommand proved that he could have executed the offer he had made to the\r\ncommander to pilot the whole army out. From this moment Forrest moves on\r\nand upward with the stride of a demigod. The night after Johnston has\r\nfallen at Shiloh he alone in the southern army discovers that Grant is\r\nreceiving by the river thousands as re-enforcement, and he gives\r\nBeauregard wise counsel which the latter is not wise enough to heed. Read\r\nhis letter of August 9, 1863, to Cooper, adjutant-general of the\r\nConfederate States,[117] in which he proposes to do what will virtually\r\nwrest the Mississippi from the federals, and the sane comment thereon of\r\nhis biographer.[118] Think of him just after the battle of Chickamauga;\r\nhow, had Bragg listened to him, he would have reaped the fruits of a great\r\nvictory which he was too stupid to know he had won. Meditate the capture\r\nof Fort Pillow, in spite of its strong defences and the succoring gunboat,\r\nby dispositions of his troops and a plan of attack which, though made and\r\nexecuted on the spur of the moment, are the most superb and brilliant\r\ntactics of all the engagements of the brothers' war. And his incomparable\r\nconduct by which the army of Sturgis was almost annihilated at Brice's\r\nCross-Roads. The conception of Forrest is as yet, even in the south, very\r\nuntrue. He is thought of only as always meeting charge with countercharge,\r\nin the very front crying \"Mix!\" sabring an antagonist, and having his\r\nhorse killed under him. When he is rightly studied he is found to be a\r\nhappy compound of the characterizing elements of such fighters as mad\r\nAnthony Wayne and Paul Jones, of such swoopers and sure retirers as Marion\r\nand Stonewall Jackson, of such as Hannibal, whose action both before,\r\nduring, and after the engagement, is the very best possible. Of all the\r\nnorthern generals Grant showed by far the best grasp of the military\r\nproblem. I think Forrest's grasp was equal. Toombs would have divined the\r\ngenius of Forrest. The confederate army under him would probably have\r\nequalled--possibly surpassed--the achievements and glory of that under\r\nLee.\r\n\r\nIt was one of Toombs's epigrams that the southern confederacy died of too\r\nmuch West Point. Of course one must not unjustly disparage the military\r\nschool. Yet there were plainly graduates on both sides who had in them too\r\nmuch of it. This was true of Halleck and McClellan; also of Davis and\r\nBragg. Mr. Davis, by reason of his exaggerated West Point spirit, was not\r\nnearly so well qualified as Mr. Lincoln for finding the few real generals\r\nin the south. Toombs, with the help of Stephens and all the real statesmen\r\nof the section, would have kept the best generals in command.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly summarize. Had Toombs been president these things would\r\nhave followed:\r\n\r\n1. The cotton of the south, fully realized as a resource, would have given\r\nher an adequate gold supply, a stable currency, and an unimpaired public\r\ncredit. It would have also kept our ports open and the hostile gunboats\r\nout of our rivers.\r\n\r\n2. There would have been no unwise waste of our precious soldiers. As it\r\nwas, their very gallantry in our contest with a foe so greatly\r\noutnumbering, was made a guaranty of defeat.\r\n\r\n3. These magnificent soldiers would have been led always by the best\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nThese were resources enough, and more than enough, to have won for the\r\nsouth. I often paralleled her neglect to use them with the supineness of\r\nthe French Commune in 1871. Lassigaray tells us how there were piles of\r\nmoney and money's worth in the bank deposits and reserves, which could\r\nhave all been had by mere taking.[119] But the Commune made no use of this\r\ngreat treasure. It surprises one as he reads of it. Then it occurs to him\r\nthat the new French government was in the hands of men who generally had\r\nhad no experience in government whatever. It was widely different with the\r\nsouthern confederacy. No other revolutionary government ever started with\r\nso little jolt and difficulty. The grooves along which it was to run were\r\nall ready. \"Confederate States\" was instantaneously substituted for\r\n\"United States\" in the constitution, organic federal statutes, and the\r\nthoughts of the people, and the administration of the new government\r\nseemed to everybody in the south but a continuation of that of the United\r\nStates. And this new federation was inaugurated by the best-trained\r\nstatesmen in America. That these men should have overlooked the great\r\nresources we have pointed out is a far more strange and wonderful blunder\r\nthan was that of the raw and inexperienced managers of the Commune. You\r\ncan explain it only by recognizing it as the accomplishment of fate. Fate\r\nput in charge of the fortunes of the confederacy an executive as just as\r\never was Aristides, and as much respected and confided in by his people.\r\nThat executive most conscientiously drove out of the public counsels the\r\nonly men who could have saved the southern cause.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing I shall add but a few other instances briefly told.\r\n\r\nGrant was at the opening of his career put in a place which taught him the\r\nimportance of gunboats, and held there until his skill in using them had\r\ngiven him resistless prestige. Beauregard's failure to make use of the\r\ndaylight remaining after the fall of Albert S. Johnston seems to have been\r\nprompted by the powers who had the future conqueror in charge. Had he been\r\nsent against Lee in 1862 or 1863 he would hardly have done better than\r\nMcClellan, Burnside, or Hooker. Compare how the powers in charge of the\r\nRoman empire prevented a too early encounter of Scipio with Hannibal.\r\n\r\nOrdinary conduct ought to have captured McClellan instead of driving him\r\nto the James. The tone of McClellan's boasting over the flank movement by\r\nwhich he successfully marched across the entire front of Lee's army within\r\ncannon shot is really that of a man who feels that he has miraculously\r\nescaped an unshunnable peril.\r\n\r\nThe directors sent Stuart astray and hypnotized Lee into believing that\r\nGettysburg was to be another Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\nThey blinded Davis to the merits of Forrest. Especially to be thought of\r\nhere is the rejected proposal of the latter to recover the Mississippi\r\nshortly after the fall of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nI need not go further. The student of the brothers' war can add to the\r\nforegoing many other favors shown the union cause by the powers in the\r\nunseen.\r\n\r\nOf course we of the south stood by our side, fighting to the last against\r\nincreasing odds with the resoluteness of hereditary freemen. In spite of\r\nall their potency the powers were often hard pressed by Lee, Jackson,\r\nForrest, and the incomparable valor of the confederate soldiers. These\r\nshould have some such eternizing epitaph as this:\r\n\r\n\"For four years they kept the fates banded against them uneasy.\"\r\n\r\nThe parallelism of the fall of the confederacy to that of Troy has\r\nincalculably deepened the interest I take in Vergil's great description.\r\nEspecially of late years do I realize more vividly how his goddess mother\r\nremoved the cloud darkening his vision, and gave AEneas to see Neptune,\r\nJuno, and Pallas busy in the destruction of the burning city; and a lurid\r\nillumination falls upon the statement,\r\n\r\n  \"Apparent dirae facies inimicaque Troiae\r\n  Numina magna deum.\"[120]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after the brothers' war it was very generally believed that\r\nDavis had been one of the Mississippi repudiators; that through all his\r\nante-bellum public career he had been an unconditional secessionist--what\r\nwe in the south mean by a fire-eater; that cherishing an accursed ambition\r\nfor the presidency of the southern confederacy he organized a secret\r\nconspiracy which consummated secession; that as the chief executive of the\r\nConfederate States he aided and abetted the perpetration of inhuman\r\ncruelties upon federal prisoners of war; that he was accessory to the\r\nmurder of President Lincoln; and that when captured he was disguised as a\r\nwoman. I suppose that these accusations--all of which are utterly\r\nuntrue--are still in the mouths of many at the north. They have attained\r\nsome currency abroad. I note that the leading German encyclopedia--that of\r\nBrockhaus--repeats those as to the conspiracy and disguise. But \"The Real\r\nJefferson Davis,\" as Landon Knight has of late presented\r\nhim,[121]--without hostile bias and with something like an approach to\r\ncompleteness--is at least beginning to be recognized outside of the south.\r\nIt is about as certain as anything in the future can be that all\r\ndetraction from the moral character and patriotism of Davis will after\r\nsome while wear itself out. I believe far greater favor than mere\r\nvindication from false accusation will at last be awarded him in every\r\npart of his own country and also abroad. Later in the chapter I shall try\r\nto bring out fully the praise and appreciation which world history will,\r\nas seems probable to me, shower upon his career. Here I can take time to\r\nmention only the beginning of that great fame which we of this day have\r\nlooked upon. We saw him fall from one of the highest and proudest places\r\nin which for four years he had been the talk and envy of the earth. We saw\r\nhim in sheer helplessness, accused of murder and treason, his feeble\r\nhealth and personal comfort made a jest of, disrespect and insult heaped\r\nupon him--we saw him endure all the most refined tortures of imprisonment.\r\nThen we saw him set free--his innocence confessed by the acts of his\r\naccusers. Then for over twenty years he lived with the people who under\r\nhis lead had been conquered and despoiled; and we saw them always eager to\r\npay him demonstrations of the warmest love; we saw them bury him with\r\ninconsolable grief; and we see them keeping his memory green by\r\nreinterring him in the old capital of the Confederate States, giving him\r\nthere a conspicuous monument, and making the anniversary of his birth a\r\nlegal holiday in different States. This--which we impressively mark now as\r\nonly a beginning of glory--must develop into something far larger.\r\n\r\nWhenever Davis comes into your mind, of course, you first think of that\r\nwith which his name is most closely connected--his elevation and his great\r\nfall. Therefore it is quite right that we make our start from this point,\r\nwhich is, that he was the head of a subverted revolutionary government. He\r\nis one of a few who, like Richard Cromwell, Napoleon, and Kruger, were\r\nsuffered to survive deposition. Nothing in nature hates a rival more than\r\nsovereignty--which, be it remembered, is the representative of a distinct\r\nnationality. Note how inevitably a young queen bee is killed by her own\r\nmother when found in the hive by the latter. Humanity has not in this\r\nparticular evolved as yet very far above bee nature; and the fate of\r\nMaximilian, emperor of Mexico, usually befalls the sovereign head of a\r\ndefeated revolution. To the student of history it is a surprise that the\r\nlife of Davis was spared when American frenzy was at its height. Think of\r\nsome of the things which then occurred. Mrs. Surratt and Wirz were hanged;\r\nthe cruel cotton tax; the negroes were made rulers of the southern whites;\r\nit was provided _ex post facto_ that the high moral duty of paying for the\r\nemancipated slaves should never be done. While good men and women both of\r\nthe north and the south will always censure with extreme severity the\r\ntreatment which Davis as a prisoner received, they ought to note it as a\r\nmost significant sign of American progress that he was at last allowed to\r\ngo forth and live without molestation the rest of his life among his old\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nBefore we begin the sketch which we contemplate let us bring out more\r\nvividly the novelty of his example by contrasting him with the failing\r\nleaders of revolutions mentioned above. Richard Cromwell could be\r\ntolerated as a private man by the restored royal government, because his\r\nprotectorate had been, so far as he himself is considered, a mere\r\naccident. It was the mighty Oliver, his father, that overthrew and\r\nbeheaded Charles I, and then took the reins of rule. These, when he died,\r\ncame to his son, who in ability and ambition was a cipher. They who set\r\nhim aside would have been ashamed to confess the slightest fear of him.\r\nHis captors exiled Napoleon, and Kruger exiled himself. Richard Cromwell,\r\nhaving been cast out of the protectorate, living forgotten in England, is\r\nno parallel to Davis spending his last years in Mississippi honored by the\r\nentire south with mounting demonstration to his death. Had Napoleon lived\r\nin France and Kruger in the Transvaal, each after his overthrow, they\r\nwould be parallels. As it is, the subsequent life of Davis is without any\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown you what it is that Davis especially examples, let us\r\nnow give you briefly such a biography as suits the purpose of this book.\r\n\r\nThe fairies bestowed upon him treasures of mind and heart, of form, mien,\r\nand face, of speech and manners. He was not of the very first rank, as\r\nWebster, Toombs, and Lee, who suggest comparison with the Pheidian Zeus,\r\nnor was he in the next with Poseidon and Ares. When President Pierce and\r\nthe members of his cabinet were passing by Princeton, a throng of citizens\r\nand students called them out during the stop of the train at the Basin. As\r\nwe went away it seemed to me that no speech but that of Davis was\r\nremembered. Compliments were rained upon him. At last a student from New\r\nYork State cried, \"He's an Apollo!\" and all the hearers assented with\r\nenthusiasm. This placed him right,--at the head of the Olympians in the\r\nthird circle.\r\n\r\nThough he became a very prominent political leader, the choice of a\r\nprofession made by him was that of a soldier. And that profession was\r\nalways his first love. His early education, though very deficient and\r\nlimited, was far superior to that with which Calhoun had to be content\r\nuntil he was eighteen. But Davis had when a boy something which supplies\r\neducational defects--a taste for study and a fondness of and access to\r\nbooks. When at the age of thirty-five he made his debut in politics he had\r\nbecome really a well-schooled and highly cultured man. He completed his\r\nWest Point course, graduating in July, 1828. His wife says: \"He did not\r\npass very high in his class; but he attached no significance to class\r\nstanding, and considered the favorable verdict of his classmates of much\r\nmore importance.\"[122]\r\n\r\nHe served in the army until June 30, 1835, when he resigned. I will cull\r\nfrom the entertaining narrative of Mrs. Davis certain occurrences of his\r\narmy life which are characteristic.\r\n\r\nReaching a ferry on Rock river in Illinois, in 1831, with his scouts, he\r\nfound the boat stopped by ice, and the mail coach with certain wagons\r\ngoing to the lead mines waiting on the bank. All the crowd put themselves\r\nat his direction. He had the men to cut blocks from the ice for a bridge.\r\nWater was poured upon each block as soon as it was laid, and this\r\nfreezing, the block was kept firmly in its place. Whenever a cutter would\r\nfall overboard, he was sent to turn himself round and round before the\r\nfire until he was dry and ready to resume work. The bridge was soon\r\nfinished, and the entire party crossed the river. This incident shows that\r\nthere was something in Davis's appearance that invited full trust, and\r\nthat he was unwontedly quick and ingenious in expedient.\r\n\r\nHow he disabled a disobedient soldier of ferocious temper and great size\r\nby an unexpected blow, and then beat him into complete submission; and how\r\nhe captivated the other soldiers by announcing that he would not notice\r\nthe affair officially, illustrates his talent for command.\r\n\r\nMen desperate and well armed had taken possession of the lead mines, and\r\nthey were to be removed. He tried to induce their consent by making them a\r\nspeech. Some weeks later he sought another conference. Finding a number\r\nof them in a drinking booth, he was begged by his orderly not to go in.\r\n\"They will be certain to kill you,\" the orderly said; \"I heard one of them\r\nsay they would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Davis entered the cabin at once, and, as they expressed it,\r\n'gave them the time of day' [that is, he said \"Good-morning\" or what the\r\nhour demanded]. He immediately added, after saluting them, 'My friends, I\r\nam sure you have thought over my proposition and are going to drink to my\r\nsuccess. So I shall treat you all.' They gave him a cheer.\"[123]\r\n\r\nHow much more heroic is such Caesar-like courage and tact in quelling the\r\nmob than to butcher misguided men with musketry.\r\n\r\nI have reserved for emphasis here, as illustrating Davis's presence of\r\nmind and readiness in emergency, two incidents which are earlier in time\r\nthan what I have just been telling. The first is this. One of the\r\nprofessors disliked and was inclined to disparage Davis while he was a\r\ncadet at West Point. Lecturing on presence of mind, this professor fixed\r\nhis eye on Davis \"and said he doubted not there were many who, in an\r\nemergency, would be confused and unstrung, not from cowardice, but from\r\nthe mediocre nature of their minds. The insult was intended, and the\r\nrecipient of it was powerless to resent it. A few days afterwards, while\r\nthe building was full of cadets, the class were being taught the process\r\nof making fireballs, when one took fire. The room was a magazine of\r\nexplosives. Cadet Davis saw it first, and calmly asked of the doughty\r\ninstructor, 'What shall I do, sir? This fireball is ignited.' The\r\nprofessor said, 'Run for your lives!' and ran for his. Cadet Davis threw\r\nit out of the window, and saved the building and a large number of lives\r\nthereby.\"[124]\r\n\r\nIn the affair last told, Davis showed a freedom from confusion and an\r\nalertness that is very rare. But the second thing which I have to tell is\r\nstill more remarkable.\r\n\r\nWhile stationed at Fort Crawford in 1829, he had set out in a boat with\r\nsome men to cut timber, accompanied by two _voyageurs_.\r\n\r\n    \"At one point they were hailed by a party of Indians who demanded a\r\n    trade of tobacco. As the Indians appeared to have no hostile\r\n    intentions, the little party rowed to the bank and began to parley.\r\n    However, the voyageurs ... soon saw that their peaceful tones were\r\n    only a cloak. They warned Lieutenant Davis of the danger, and he\r\n    ordered his men to push out into the stream and make the best time\r\n    they could up the river. With yells of fury the Indians leaped into\r\n    their canoes and gave chase. There was little, if any, chance for the\r\n    white men to escape such experienced rowers.... If taken ... death by\r\n    torture was inevitable. They would have been captured had not\r\n    Lieutenant Davis thought of rigging up a sail with one of their\r\n    blankets. Fortunately the wind was in their favor, but it was very\r\n    boisterous. As it was a choice between certain death by the hands of\r\n    the Indians, or possible death by drowning, they availed themselves of\r\n    the slender chance left and escaped.\"[125]\r\n\r\nThese things which we have selected to tell of him prove that he had in\r\nlarge measure some of the endowments which are indispensable to the\r\nexcellent soldier. They will be recalled by you when we tell his feats in\r\nMexico. I must say here that I do not mean to claim first-rate ability for\r\nhim; but I do believe that he was equal or almost equal to the best in\r\nthat great department of the military requiring the powers of the gifted\r\nofficer and not those of the few born generals of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is a most amiable touch that he left the army to marry a woman the\r\nchoice of his heart, and give her a happy home. He cordially sacrificed\r\nfor her an occupation which he loved only less than herself. He had had as\r\nbrilliant a career as could be won by a lieutenant in garrison duty and\r\nservice against the Indians. It must be remembered he had been promoted to\r\nfirst lieutenant for gallantry.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to mention here one other fact of his army life. He had\r\nresolved that if the regiment to which he belonged should be sent to help\r\nexecute the force bill in South Carolina, he would resign. Though he never\r\nwas a nullifier, his conscience could not permit him to abet in any way\r\nthe coercion of a sovereign State, as he always believed each one of the\r\nUnited States to be.\r\n\r\nHis wife lived only a few months. Her death was a fell blow. Her husband\r\nmourned her for nearly ten years. Then he made a most happy marriage with\r\nthe lady who survives him.\r\n\r\nIn 1836--the next year after the death of his first wife--he settled on a\r\nplantation. Mr. Knight is especially happy in telling how, with his elder\r\nbrother Joseph, who had been a successful lawyer, but was now a rich\r\nplanter, as instructor and guide, he studied diligently for some while. To\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n    \"During the period of their residence together, the time not required\r\n    by business the brothers devoted to reading and discussion. Political\r\n    economy and law, the science of government in general and that of the\r\n    United States in particular, were the favorite themes. Locke and\r\n    Justinian, Mill, Adam Smith, and Vattel divided honors with the\r\n    Federalist, the Resolutions of ninety-eight, and the Debates of the\r\n    Constitutional Convention. It was said they knew every word of the\r\n    last three by memory; and it is certain that year after year, almost\r\n    without interruption, they sat far into the night debating almost\r\n    every conceivable question that could arise under the constitution of\r\n    the United States.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, as his congressional speeches and his book show, became\r\ndeeply versed in the subjects of the joint study just described. I must\r\nnote, however, that the discussion which engaged him for such a\r\nconsiderable period of his ante-public life was had only with one who was\r\nof the same State-rights creed as he himself was, and that it was all in\r\nthe closet, as it were. You can only begin the making of a great lawyer by\r\nfeigned cases and moot courts. Likewise the true political leader must\r\nearly be plunged into real contentions over questions of actual interest,\r\nand thus almost from the very first mix practice with theory. Compare\r\nWebster and Toombs, each at his outset combating with the ablest lawyers\r\nof his State as adversaries, and also publicly discussing varied questions\r\nof policy. I suspect that this prolonged closet training, with its\r\nabundance of academic debate, had much to do in developing Davis into that\r\nsupra-logical consistency, stiffness, and unmodifiability of opinion which\r\nis one of his special differences as a practical statesman from the two\r\ngreat men last mentioned. This, and the mental habitude given by his\r\nmilitary education and experience, mark him as _sui generis_ among our\r\npolitical leaders. His public career shows more of the doctrinaire and\r\nprecisian than can be found in any other one of these.\r\n\r\nIn the long post-graduate course which he took in private under his\r\nbrother, he was preparing for public life without being aware of it, as it\r\nseems to me.\r\n\r\nHe had now but one acquisition to make--to think on his legs and tell his\r\nthoughts at the same time. Extempore speakers are generally made. But\r\nDavis was a born one. He did not have that experience at the bar and in\r\nthe State legislature which has been the beginning of so many famous\r\nAmerican orators. The democrats of his county nominated him for the\r\nlegislature in 1843, and his first experience in public speaking was in a\r\nstump-debate immediately afterwards with the redoubtable S. S. Prentiss,\r\nDavis then being thirty-five years old. The debate consumed most of the\r\nday. The disputants had each fifteen minutes at a time. The result of the\r\ncampaign was in favor of Prentiss. As Davis, a democrat, was merely\r\nleading a forlorn hope in a county overwhelmingly whig, that was to be\r\nexpected. But the pluck, readiness, and power which he exhibited in this,\r\nhis maiden effort, pitted as he was against the ablest speaker of the\r\nState, astounded the auditors, and it seemed even to the whigs that the\r\nraw debater while nominally losing had really triumphed.\r\n\r\nThe next experience he had is thus narrated by Mr. Knight: \"Mr. Davis took\r\na conspicuous part in the presidential campaign of 1844, and was chosen as\r\none of the Polk electors. Before this campaign he was but slightly known\r\nbeyond his own county, but at its conclusion his popularity had become so\r\ngreat that there was a general demand in the ranks of his party that he\r\nshould become a candidate for congress in the following year.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to receive just one more lesson as a speaker. In 1845 Calhoun was\r\ncoming to Natchez. Davis was selected to welcome him with a speech. He\r\nmade careful preparation, which his wife, whom he had lately married, took\r\ndown at his dictation. But when Calhoun had come, after a moment or two of\r\nslowness in the exordium, Davis gave up trying to recite from memory, and\r\ndelivered with grace and effect an unpremeditated speech of taking\r\nappropriateness.[126]\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Davis says of him as a speaker is so just and in such good\r\ntaste, that I quote it:\r\n\r\n    \"From that day forth no speech was ever written for delivery. Dates\r\n    and names were jotted down on two or three inches of paper, and these\r\n    sufficed. Mr. Davis's speeches never read as they were delivered; he\r\n    spoke fast, and thoughts crowded each other closely; a certain\r\n    magnetism of manner and the exceeding beauty and charm of his voice\r\n    moved the multitude, and there were apparently no inattentive or\r\n    indifferent listeners. He had one power that I have never seen\r\n    excelled; while speaking he took in the individuality of the crowd,\r\n    and seeing doubt or a lack of coincidence with him in their faces, he\r\n    answered ... with arguments addressed to the case in their minds. He\r\n    was never tiresome, because, as he said, he gave close attention to\r\n    the necessity of stopping when he was done.\r\n\r\n    Only so much of his eloquence has survived as was indifferently\r\n    reported. The spirit of the graceful periods was lost. He was a\r\n    parenthetical speaker, which was a defect in a written oration, but it\r\n    did not, when uttered, impair the quality of his speeches, but rather\r\n    added a charm when accentuated by his voice and commended by his\r\n    gracious manner. At first his style was ornate, and poetry and fiction\r\n    were pressed from his crowded memory into service; but it was soon\r\n    changed into a plain and stronger cast of what he considered to be,\r\n    and doubtless was, the higher kind of oratory. His extempore addresses\r\n    are models of grace and ready command of language.\"[127]\r\n\r\nHe took his seat in the United States house of representatives in\r\nDecember, 1845, he and Toombs, who was two years younger, beginning their\r\ncongressional careers together. Davis made a very creditable speech on the\r\nOregon question early in February, 1846. He was a modest member, but he\r\ndid all the duties of his place with praiseworthy diligence.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was a thoroughgoing anti-tariff democrat and Webster a\r\npro-tariff whig leader, he could not be induced to join in the effort to\r\nmake political capital for his own party by blackening the name of\r\nWebster. The minority report of the committee which investigated the\r\nconduct of Webster, as secretary of state, was really made by Davis, who\r\nwas one of the committee. The stand taken by the latter, and the true\r\npresentation which he made, at last got the whole committee to adopt his\r\nreport substantially. Webster was greatly pleased with it.\r\n\r\nEarly in May, 1846, Taylor had won his first victories. On the 29th Davis,\r\nsupporting joint resolutions of thanks to the general and his army, made\r\nreply to what he deemed were unwarranted reflections upon West Point. He\r\nemphasized Taylor's operations as proving the high value of military\r\neducation. He asked Sawyer of Ohio, who had disparaged the Academy, if the\r\nlatter believed that a blacksmith or tailor could have done such good\r\nwork. Thus, without knowing it, he trod upon the toes of two members of\r\nthe house; for Sawyer had been a blacksmith, and Andrew Johnson, of\r\nTennessee, a tailor. Sawyer took it good-humoredly, but Johnson, the next\r\nday, passionately defended tailors, and used language very offensive to\r\nDavis, implying that the latter belonged to \"an illegitimate, swaggering,\r\nbastard, scrub aristocracy.\" To this the latter, justly indignant,\r\nrejoined with cutting severity. There was never any love lost between the\r\ntwo afterwards. When President Lincoln was murdered Johnson, succeeding\r\nhim, committed the unspeakable folly of offering by proclamation $100,000\r\nreward for the arrest of Davis as accessory. When Davis, having been\r\ncaptured, was told of the proclamation he said to General Wilson--hoping\r\nhis words would be reported to Johnson--that there was one man in the\r\nUnited States who knew the charge was false; this was the man who had\r\nsigned the proclamation; \"for,\" said Davis, \"he at least knew that I\r\npreferred Lincoln to himself.\"\r\n\r\nOf course had Davis possessed the chief qualifications of popular\r\nleadership he would have made a fast friend instead of a bitter enemy of\r\nthis man, whose rise from low estate to greatness proves that he had in\r\nhim elements of manhood and virtue that ought to have homage from the\r\nhighest and proudest.\r\n\r\nIt was by his course in the Mexican war that Davis commenced life in the\r\neye of the nation. Without canvassing for the place--he never did canvass\r\nfor a place--he was elected colonel of the First Mississippi volunteers,\r\nand \"he eagerly and gladly accepted.\" The president, authorized by a new\r\nlaw, offered to make him a brigadier general. Mrs. Davis says: \"My husband\r\nexpressed his preference for an elective office; when pressed, he said\r\nthat he thought volunteer troops raised in a State should be officered by\r\nmen of their own selection, and that after the elective right of the\r\nvolunteers ceased, the appointing power should be the governor of the\r\nState whose troops were to be commanded by the general. This was his first\r\nsacrifice to State rights, and it was a great effort to him.\"[128]\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott doubted if the percussion lock was as well suited to field\r\nuse as the flint lock, but Davis knew better. He had his men furnished\r\nwith the percussion-lock rifle, a very superior arm to the old\r\nsmooth-bore. He drilled his regiment well. And he kept its members from\r\npillaging.\r\n\r\nAs the storming of Monterey opened, the head of the column recoiled in\r\nconfusion from a deadly cross-fire, \"producing the utmost confusion among\r\nthe front of the assaulting brigade. The strong fort, Taneira, which had\r\ncontributed most to the repulse, now ran up a new flag, and amid the wild\r\ncheering of its defenders redoubled its fire of grape and canister and\r\nmusketry, under which the American lines wavered and were about to break.\r\nColonel Davis, seeing the crisis, without waiting for orders, placed\r\nhimself at the head of his Mississippians, and gave the order to charge.\r\nWith prolonged cheers his regiment swept forward through a storm of\r\nbullets and bursting shells. Colonel Davis, sword in hand, cleared the\r\nditch at one bound, and cheering his soldiers on, they mounted the works\r\nwith the impetuosity of a whirlwind, capturing artillery and driving the\r\nMexicans pell-mell back into the stone fort in the rear. In vain they\r\nsought to barricade the gate; Davis and McClung [the lieutenant-colonel]\r\nburst it open, and leading their men into the fort, compelled its\r\nsurrender at discretion. Taneira was the key of the situation, and its\r\ncapture insured victory. On the morning of the 23d of September, the\r\nfollowing day, Henderson's Texas Rangers, Campbell's Tennesseeans, and\r\nDavis's Mississippians, the latter again leading the assault, stormed and\r\ncaptured El Diabolo, and the next day General Ampudia surrendered the\r\ncity.\"[129]\r\n\r\nDavis's quickness, coolness, and dash--and especially his promptness to\r\ntake such wise initiative as is permissible to a colonel in action--shone\r\nforth conspicuously in this affair.\r\n\r\nHe was the very soul of the glorious stand of the Americans at Buena Vista\r\nagainst odds of more than 4 to 1. At the opening of the battle a ball\r\ndrove a part of his spur into the right foot just below the instep, making\r\na very painful wound. He kept his seat as though nothing had happened.\r\nLater in the day, his bleeding foot thrown over the pommel, he spurred his\r\nhorse into leaping a ravine, in which he saw a horse and cart beneath him\r\nas he flew over. But his great exploit was the re-entering line of his\r\nregiment and Bowles's Indianians, with which he received the charge of a\r\nhost of heavy cavalry. His rifles being without bayonets, the hollow\r\nsquare, then the approved mode of defence, was not to be thought of. So\r\nnecessity, the mother of invention, suggested to him a formation which\r\npoured something like two crossing enfilades into the head of the cavalry\r\ncolumn. The brilliant conception was brilliantly executed. The carnage\r\nthat befel the cavalry drove it from the field. Did not the spirit of\r\nNapoleon looking on regret that he had not given the pesky Mamelukes like\r\npunishment? The world has noted how Sir Colin Campbell learned from Davis\r\nthe right way of opposing infantry to the onset of heavy cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe great distinction won most deservedly by Davis, as the colonel of a\r\nraw regiment in these important engagements, is, so far as I know, without\r\nany parallel. It was but natural that he should always afterwards believe\r\nhimself to be a great military genius. Of course he had become famous\r\nthroughout the whole country.\r\n\r\nThere was a vacancy in one of the United States senatorships from\r\nMississippi, and Davis was appointed to fill it. I need not go into much\r\ndetail at this point. He was warmly greeted at his entrance into the upper\r\nhouse. He maintained himself with growing ability. While he was\r\nindependent and self-reliant enough now and then to differ with Calhoun,\r\nin the main he followed the latter as his leader. There was a dignity and\r\npoise in his nature that suited the senate better than the house of\r\nrepresentatives. And he was doubtless frank when he asserted later that he\r\npreferred the senate to any other place. As I contemplate his record at\r\nthis part of his life he impresses me as that one of all the more\r\nprominent southern public men who was most fixed in the opinion that the\r\nvery surest preservative of the union was for the south to be always\r\nunflinching and utterly uncompromising in demanding exact enforcement of\r\nevery constitutional protection of slavery. He loved the union most\r\nfondly. It was only the south that he loved more. Conscientious\r\ndoctrinaire as he was, he believed that the rights of the south were so\r\nplain and palpable that if they were but stated they would be conceded by\r\nthe great mass of the northern people. He thought it was to encourage\r\ndisunion to surrender even a jot of our claim to equality in the\r\nTerritories and that the fugitive slave law should be fully enforced. His\r\nanticipation was that the more we yielded to the anti-slavery men the more\r\nwe would be asked to yield, until at last we would be driven into the\r\nditch, when we could save the south only by secession. So he counselled\r\nwith all his might that the south should resolve to surrender nothing\r\nwhatever--to go out of the union rather than so to do. Let the north\r\nunderstand this and the abolition party will disappear. That is the only\r\nway to save the union. This explains why he refused to support the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850. He was beaten for governor of Mississippi on\r\nthat issue. He was classed with the fire-eaters. But that was utterly\r\nuntrue. Remember that in 1860 he actually contemplated being the\r\ndemocratic presidential candidate, and that Massachusetts sent a\r\ndelegation to the Charleston convention instructed for him.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to his secretaryship of war. He was as up to date in\r\nadopting every new thing of merit as he had been in insisting upon\r\npercussion-lock rifles for his regiment in the Mexican war. The diligence\r\nand prolonged labor which he conscientiously gave his official duties were\r\ntruly exemplary. I wish especially to have my reader reflect upon two\r\nthings belonging here. In selecting men to fill offices, from the highest\r\nto the lowest, he was utterly regardless of their politics. When\r\nremonstrated with by democratic partisans for not giving democrats the\r\npreference in competition for appointments, he declared positively that he\r\nshould always make fitness and qualification the only conditions of such\r\nselection. And his actions as long as he held the important office spoke\r\neven louder than his words. Surely here is an example for these times to\r\nprofit by. The second thing really belongs to the same class as the first.\r\nIt is that when civil war actually prevailed in Kansas between the\r\nanti-slavery men on one side and the pro-slavery men on the other, and the\r\ncommander of the federal troops in the Territory would virtually be\r\nabsolute in power, though Davis was the very extreme of pro-slavery he\r\ngave the place to Colonel Sumner, an outspoken abolitionist, \"whose honor,\r\nability, and judgment recommended him as the best man for the difficult\r\nduty.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe secretaryship must be noted as deepening the regular-army grooves in\r\nwhich Davis's thoughts and tastes had long been moving.\r\n\r\nHe became United States senator again in 1857, which position he held\r\nuntil the secession of his State. I need touch upon nothing but the\r\nprominent part he took. Without knowing it he became the guide that\r\nconducted the south in the aggressive defensive which the closing in\r\naround her of the hostile lines imperatively dictated. All that he did of\r\nimportance but led up to or supported his famous resolutions of February\r\n2, 1860. Their gist was that if the judiciary and executive could not and\r\nthe Territorial legislature would not protect slave property in any of the\r\nTerritories, congress was bound to pass efficiently protecting laws, to\r\nremain of force until the Territory was admitted as a State, with a\r\nconstitution that authorized or prohibited slavery.\r\n\r\nCompare the speech he made for these resolutions with that made for them\r\nby Toombs, and the wide difference of the two men comes out plainly. The\r\nformer is the height of commonplace morality and patriotism, expressed\r\nwith manly strength and eloquence, while the speaker does not see clearly\r\ninto the gulf of the brothers' war into which his measure has been made by\r\nthe fates the lever to plunge America. That of Toombs shows titanic\r\nmastery of law and statesmanship, and almost full discernment of the\r\nnational catastrophe at the door. It is destined, I believe, to stand in\r\nthe highest class of great speeches.\r\n\r\nCompare the last speeches of each in the senate. Toombs's justification of\r\nsecession is with argument and appeal to conscience that the greatest men\r\ncannot, and only cosmic forces, the fates, the directors of evolution, can\r\nanswer. Davis's does satisfy the conscience of the typical southerner, and\r\nin the tone preserved from beginning to end is a marvel of propriety. The\r\npathos of his leave-taking melted the sternest hearts on the other side.\r\nIt was especially in his freedom from offensive words and the gentlemanly\r\nself-restraint of his manner that Davis showed as decidedly superior to\r\nthe other. In the speech of Toombs last noticed there are some harsh and\r\nheated words that I would blot into complete oblivion if I could. There is\r\nnot a single line in the other that I can find fault with. I will here\r\nparallel them in another place that is strikingly illustrative. Some years\r\nafter the war the people of Mississippi wanted to send Davis back to the\r\nUnited States senate. To this end the legislature memorialized him to\r\napply for the removal of his disability. He replied that repentance ought\r\nalways to precede asking for pardon, and that he had not yet repented. One\r\nday about the same time a sympathizing southerner asked Toombs if the\r\nyankees had pardoned him yet. He scowled his darkest, and thundered, \"No.\r\nAnd God damn 'em, I haven't pardoned them.\" Of course the average man or\r\nwoman will cordially approve the decorum of Davis's reply, and on\r\nreflection will censure the other.\r\n\r\nDavis was completely representative of the real chivalry of the south; and\r\nfrom the Mexican war on, this was more and more recognized in the section.\r\nWhen he was made president of the confederacy the great majority of the\r\npeople approved. He is such a gentleman; so conscientious; so attentive to\r\nhis public duties; and then his military education and experience make him\r\nfar superior to Lincoln--this was said by the general. Thus were his\r\ndisqualifications for the place concealed from the people of the south.\r\n\r\nHis chief defect was that not being a successful business man, he was not\r\na practical statesman. On this point we have already said enough.\r\n\r\nHis own judgment upon himself was that he ought to command the armies of\r\nthe confederacy. To the very last he believed he had the extreme of\r\nmilitary ability. During the gloomy days that set in after Gettysburg he\r\noften exclaimed, \"If I could take one wing and Lee the other, I think we\r\ncould between us wrest a victory from those people.\"[131]\r\n\r\nBut he did not have extraordinary military capacity, as appears from the\r\nfacts which I will now tell.\r\n\r\nHe was on the field at First Manassas when that unprecedented panic seized\r\nthe federal army. It was instantaneously understood by the latest recruit\r\nlooking on from our side. The men and line officers around me ejaculated,\r\n\"We ought to press forward and go into Washington with 'em.\" Davis with\r\nhis training should have seen better even than these raw volunteers, and\r\nrecognized it was his part by pursuit to accelerate the flight and raise\r\nthat panic to its top. There were remaining several hours of daylight,\r\nduring which five of his men could chase a hundred and a hundred put ten\r\nthousand to flight, and when night came the excited imagination of the\r\nfliers would re-enforce the confederates with a vast host of destroying\r\nmonsters behind and before. The federals losing all organization, were\r\nracing to escape over the bridge at Washington which was a little more\r\nthan twenty miles away. They were choking the roads with abandoned\r\nvehicles and artillery. As it was, they seriously choked the bridge. Had\r\nthere been rapid advance by us, and firing in the rear, it is more than\r\nprobable we should have got the bridge unharmed. We should have added\r\nthousands to our prisoners. But far more important than this, would have\r\nbeen the arms, ammunition, wagons, horses, quartermaster and commissary\r\nsupplies of all sorts--in short, the entire baggage of the enemy--that\r\nwould have been ours for the taking. And if the federals had destroyed the\r\nbridge before we reached it, we should have had McDowell's pontoons, or\r\ncaptured material out of which to make a bridge of our own. We should have\r\ncrossed somehow, and at the place which circumstances and the insight of\r\ngenius suggested. The capital would have fallen, really without a blow;\r\nand what an immense addition to our booty would have been here. And the\r\nprestige! In a day or two our flag would have waved over Baltimore, the\r\nconsequence being that Maryland, with a throng of most true and valiant\r\nfighters, would have been won for the Confederate States, and its northern\r\nline instead of the Potomac would have become the frontier. All this would\r\nhave happened if Davis had been a Caesar and had Caesar-like used the one\r\ngreat opportunity of the war. It must be set down to his credit that he\r\ndid far more than Johnston and Beauregard insist upon pursuit. But he does\r\nnot seem to have thought of it until night; and at last he permitted\r\nhimself to be reasoned out of it.\r\n\r\nThere have been earnest efforts to justify the fateful supineness of our\r\narmy after this victory. We were without transportation means, and a\r\nretreating army always outruns its pursuers, said Johnston. Mr. Knight\r\nsays Northrop had left us without commissary supplies, and of course men\r\nwithout anything to eat had to wait until they could be fed. Beauregard\r\nsays we ought to have made for the upper Potomac, which was fordable. All\r\nsuch reasons come from those who ignore the situation. A real general\r\nwould have said to his soldiers, in the first moment of the panic, \"You\r\nare weary; it will rest you to chase your flying foe; you can catch him\r\nbecause of the obstructing bridge. You are hungry; there are full\r\nhaversacks and commissary wagons of your enemy just beyond Centerville\r\nwithout defenders. Forward, and escort the grand army into Washington\r\ncity!\" And such a general with just what infantry he could find to hand,\r\nall the while being re-enforced by eager men catching up, pressing forward\r\nas persistently as Blucher spurred with his cavalry after the French\r\nflying from Waterloo, would have been in sight of Washington when the sun\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight sets forth very truly the incapacity of Davis as the military\r\nchieftain of the Confederate States.[132] I would abridge what can be said\r\nhere under these heads:\r\n\r\n1. Each particular army ought to have operated as a part of the whole\r\nforce of the confederacy, and that whole force ought to have been wielded\r\nas one machine. Instead of trying to effect this end, the president\r\ndecided that all exposed points must be defended. The result was that\r\nthese were taken one after another by superior armies. A military man will\r\nunderstand me when I say his strategy was below mediocrity. True strategy\r\ndictated the abandonment of many places in order to assemble by using our\r\nshorter interior lines a resistless power on a really decisive occasion.\r\nMcClellan, in Virginia, and Grant, in Mississippi, ought each to have been\r\ncaptured as Burgoyne and Cornwallis were.\r\n\r\n2. He selected his generals and important officers according to his likes\r\nand dislikes, and not according to their true qualifications.\r\n\r\n3. He was without practical administrative talent in any high degree. Such\r\na man as Joseph E. Brown, of Georgia, would have shown far superior to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless be the decision of future history that he was neither\r\nstatesman nor military man of sufficient ability for the presidency. He\r\ndid not want it. Compare him as secession was dawning, with Toombs, who\r\nwas the man of all to be president. The latter scenting battle in the air,\r\nwas really eager for the inevitable fighting to begin; Davis was cast down\r\nand dejected. He loved the union, and it was inexpressibly bitter to him\r\nto part with it. And then he was sure that there would be a long and\r\nbloody brothers' war. What he wanted was to fight for the south so dear to\r\nhim. The news of his election as president was perhaps the greatest\r\nsurprise of his life. Says Mrs. Davis: \"When reading the telegram he\r\nlooked so grieved that I feared some evil had befallen our family. After a\r\nfew minutes' painful silence he told me, as a man might speak of a\r\nsentence of death.\"[133]\r\n\r\nWriting of his inauguration at Montgomery, he says to his wife: \"The\r\naudience was large and brilliant. Upon my weary heart were showered\r\nsmiles, plaudits, and flowers; but, beyond them, I saw troubles and thorns\r\ninnumerable.\"[134]\r\n\r\nAnd she tells this of his inauguration as president of the permanent\r\ngovernment:\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Davis came in from an early visit to his office and went into his\r\n    room, where I found him an hour afterwards on his knees in earnest\r\n    prayer 'for the divine support I need so sorely' [as he said].... 'The\r\n    inauguration took place at twelve o'clock.' [The anterior proceedings\r\n    having been described, the contemporary account she quotes goes on\r\n    thus:]\r\n\r\n    \"The president-elect then delivered his inaugural address. It was\r\n    characterized by great dignity, united with much feeling and grace,\r\n    especially the closing sentence. Throwing up his eyes and hands to\r\n    heaven he said, 'With humble gratitude and adoration, acknowledging\r\n    the providence which has so visibly protected the confederacy during\r\n    its brief but eventful career, to Thee, O God, I trustingly commit\r\n    myself, and prayerfully invoke Thy blessing on my country and its\r\n    cause.'\"\r\n\r\nThen she adds:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus Mr. Davis entered on his martyrdom. As he stood pale and\r\n    emaciated, dedicating himself to the service of the confederacy,\r\n    evidently forgetful of everything but his sacred oath, he seemed to me\r\n    a willing victim going to his funeral pyre; and the idea so affected\r\n    me that, making some excuse, I regained my carriage and went\r\n    home.\"[135]\r\n\r\nSo did this thrice-noble man sacrifice his dearest wishes and with\r\nsuperhuman resolution step into the arena at the command of the fates, to\r\nbe the target of their wrath against his people.\r\n\r\nHe was like Hamlet upon whom destiny had imposed a high task far beyond\r\nhis powers. We can believe that to the end of his presidency Davis sorely\r\nsighed more and more often:\r\n\r\n  \"The time is out of joint: O cursed spite\r\n  That ever I was born to set it right.\"\r\n\r\nHis official career from beginning to end was full of fatal mistakes. But\r\nin every one of these he did the right--to use Lincoln's grand word--as\r\nGod gave him to see it. This will more and more through all the future\r\nturn his failure to glory. He will be like Hector, who draws the\r\nadmiration of the world a thousand-fold more than Achilles, his\r\nvanquisher.[136]\r\n\r\nAt the last, when the sword of Grant had beaten down the sword of Lee, and\r\nall of us, it seemed to me, knew that it was the highest duty of\r\npatriotism to yield our arms, he was for fighting on. Casabianca would\r\nnot go with those who were leaving the burning ship until his dead father\r\nbade him go. Davis would not abandon the cause of his nation without its\r\ncommand; and it could give none; for it was dead and he did not know it.\r\nHe was trying his hardest to reach the west, intent upon prosecuting the\r\nwar from a new base, when he was taken.\r\n\r\nHis capture was accepted by the southern people as the fall of the blue\r\ncross. Every man, woman, and child old enough to think, in the late\r\nconfederacy became sick and faint. Sorrow after sorrow, and grief after\r\ngrief tore their hearts. The first was the thought, for all the blood we\r\nhave poured out during four years of such effort on the battlefield as the\r\nworld never knew before we have lost; we have been beaten, and we are\r\nsubjugated. The next thought that pierced was, the property that made our\r\nhomes the sweetest and most comfortable on earth has all been destroyed,\r\nand for the rest of their lives our dear ones must pine in hardship and\r\nmisery. O how this pang actually killed many old men and women! It seems\r\nto me that heart failure commenced in the south with the great harvest it\r\ngathered in the first five years succeeding the war. But the agony of\r\nagonies was that the negroes were put over us. Those five\r\nyears--particularly the last three of them--are the one ugly dream of my\r\nlife. To pay his debts, which would have been a small thing to him had he\r\nkept his slaves, but which were now monsters, my father overworked\r\nhimself, while trying to make a cotton crop with freedmen. I did not learn\r\nof his imprudence until I had been summoned to see him die. There was\r\nsomething like this in every family. A night of impoverishment, misery,\r\ncontumely, and insult descended upon us, and the sun would not rise. I\r\nkept the stoutest heart that I could. Now and then it was a comforting\r\nday dream to imagine how well it would have been for me if I had fallen in\r\nthe front of my men on the second day of Gettysburg, when I was trying my\r\nutmost to make them do the impossibility of charging across the narrow bog\r\nstaying us, and mixing with the men in blue lining the other side. Had\r\nthat happened to me I should never have known, in the flesh, of our\r\ndecisive defeats, nor of the trials of my people after they laid down\r\narms; and even if my grave could not have been found, there would have\r\nbeen at a place here and there for some years honorable mention of me with\r\ntears on Memorial Day, to gladden my spirit taking note. This would\r\nsometimes be my thought, and thousands of others had like thoughts.\r\n\r\nEarly in this time of sorrow and suffering the women of the south\r\ninstituted Memorial Day. Each year when it comes they do rites of\r\nremembrance to the fallen soldiers of the confederacy. These soldiers lie\r\nin every graveyard from the Ohio and Potomac to the Rio Grande. When the\r\nday comes these women in their unforgetting love assemble the people, have\r\npraises and lamentations of their dead darlings fitly spoken; and then\r\nthey deck their graves with the fairest flowers of spring. It is an annual\r\nholiday, sacred to grief for our heroes who died in vain. It is the\r\nfairest, tenderest, and sweetest testimonial of love ever given--love from\r\nthose who have nothing else to bestow, lavished upon those who can make no\r\nreturn; and it is further the most splendid and glorious, being the\r\nco-operative demonstration of a whole people of \"true lovers.\"[137]\r\n\r\nI cannot say where and when the observance of Memorial Day began. Perhaps\r\nMiss Davidson correctly asserts that it was in Petersburg, Virginia, in\r\n1866.[138] It had reached its height at Charleston, South Carolina, in the\r\nspring of 1867, when as prelude to decorating the graves in Magnolia\r\ncemetery, Timrod's hymn, containing this oft-quoted passage, was sung:\r\n\r\n  \"Behold! your sisters bring their tears,\r\n  And these memorial blooms.\r\n\r\n  \"Small tributes! but your shades shall smile\r\n  More proudly on these wreaths to-day,\r\n  Than when some cannon-moulded pile\r\n  Shall overlook this bay.\r\n\r\n  \"Stoop, angels, hither from the skies!\r\n  There is no holier spot of ground\r\n  Than where defeated valor lies,\r\n  By mourning beauty crowned.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"true lovers\" could no more forget their living leader in prison than\r\nthey could forget their soldiers in the grave. \"Out of sight, out of mind\"\r\ncould not be said of Davis during his two years' confinement. The concern\r\nof his people mounted steadily. They made all his sufferings their own,\r\nlamenting and praying for him as a loved father. When he was about to be\r\nreleased on bond the news gave the south a wilder joy than did the\r\nunexpected victory of First Manassas. He was brought in custody to\r\nRichmond by a James river steamboat. Mrs. Davis thus describes how he was\r\nreceived:\r\n\r\n    \"A great concourse of people had assembled. From the wharf to the\r\n    Spottswood Hotel there was a sea of heads--room had to be made by the\r\n    mounted police for the carriages. The windows were crowded, and even\r\n    on to the roofs people had climbed. Every head was bared. The ladies\r\n    were shedding tears.... When Mr. Davis reached the Spottswood Hotel,\r\n    where rooms had been provided for us, the crowd opened and the beloved\r\n    prisoner walked through; the people stood uncovered for at least a\r\n    mile up and down Main street. As he passed, one and another put out a\r\n    hand and lightly touched his coat. As I left the carriage a low voice\r\n    said: 'Hats off, Virginians,' and again every head was bared. This\r\n    noble sympathy and clinging affection repaid us for many moments of\r\n    bitter anguish.\r\n\r\n    When Mr. Davis was released, one gentleman jumped upon the box and\r\n    drove the carriage which brought him back to the hotel, and other\r\n    gentlemen ran after him and shouted themselves hoarse. Our people\r\n    poured into the hotel in a steady stream to congratulate, and many\r\n    embraced him.\"\r\n\r\nBear in mind the people, and where it was, and when it was, from whom this\r\nshow of respect so great, so earnest and unfeigned, spontaneously came.\r\nThey were of that part of the south which had lost more in blood,\r\nproperty, and devastation than any other, and who, one might think, were\r\ntoo embittered against their defeated leader to show him anything but\r\ndisapproval. They were also of a State which had not been readmitted into\r\nthe union. The axe was suspended over their necks by a party seeking\r\nexcuses for letting it fall; by a party to whom Davis was the most hated\r\nof men. Surely these Virginians who thus risked their fortunes were the\r\ntruest of lovers.\r\n\r\nNo reader of mine, though he search history and encyclopedias through and\r\nthrough for years, can find anything like the Southern Memorial Day and\r\nthe honors given Davis in Richmond as we have just told. They unmistakably\r\nmark an ascent of humanity. But it is not my purpose to emphasize them as\r\nspecially signalizing the south. Their great lesson is not learned if it\r\nis not understood that they are glories of federal government. Under any\r\nother form of government such demonstrations would be suppressed as\r\ndisloyal and treasonable.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty-two years after this auspicious day the ex-president\r\nof the southern confederacy lived most of his time among his people. Their\r\nlove for him steadily grew. He proved worthy of it. He would not accept\r\nthe bounty they stood ready to shower upon him, and he was poor and\r\nwithout money-making faculty. When Mississippi wanted to make him United\r\nStates senator again, he felt that he was too old and broken to serve the\r\nState efficiently, and he declined. It occurred to all of us that he\r\nsorely needed the salary of the place. He struggled on under the load of\r\npoverty and ill-health. All of us knew that the latter came from that\r\ncruel and inhuman imprisonment, and the more he suffered the closer our\r\nhearts drew to him. The cause of his section he justified to the last, and\r\nwith all his energy. His book defending that cause was written under\r\ndifficulty almost insurmountable by man. His character as one tried in\r\nevery way and found true came out clearer and clearer. He showed more and\r\nmore of spotless virtue, becoming all the while to us a stronger\r\njustification of the fight we had made under him for the lost cause. We\r\nthought to ourselves with pride that the world will some day learn what a\r\ngood man he was, and that will be our complete vindication from the\r\nslanders now current.\r\n\r\nLet me tell of some of the other demonstrations made over him. I witnessed\r\nthat in Atlanta, in 1886. April 30, all the State of Georgia was there, as\r\nit seemed. Old and young, white and colored, waited impatiently for the\r\nrailroad train bringing him from Montgomery. My wife, divining the rare\r\nsight thus to be gained, secured a station out of town where she could see\r\nthe train pass without obstruction. As long as she lived afterwards, his\r\ncar, prodigally and appropriately bedecked with the fairest May flowers of\r\nthe sunny south, was her proverb for that which pleases too greatly for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWhen he had come out of his bower of flowers and we knew he was resting,\r\nwe felt as if the angel of the Lord was here with tidings of great joy for\r\nall our people.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the rejoicing of the next day that came forth everywhere\r\nas Mr. Davis showed himself to his people! I have seen popular outbursts\r\nof gladness, but nothing like this. It surpassed in profundity of feeling\r\nand sustained energy and flow that which seemed to come straight out of\r\nthe ground when, in 1884, we knew at last that Cleveland was elected, and\r\nthe south was convulsed with an ecstasy of happy surprise. The women and\r\nmen who had tasted the war all crying; all pouring benedictions upon his\r\ngray hairs as they came in sight; \"God bless him\" displayed on every\r\ncorner. I am utterly unable adequately to report this grand occasion. I\r\nwill tell only a few things that I saw or heard of. He passed by a long\r\nline of school-children in Peachtree street. They made the sincere and\r\ndecided demonstrations of children whose pleasure is at its height. But\r\nwhat was especially noticeable to me here was the behavior in the section\r\nof colored children. Their delight seemed, if that were possible, to be\r\nsomewhat wilder and more unrestrained than that of the white children. The\r\noccurrence has come back to me a thousand times. Is it to be explained by\r\nMr. Davis's character as a master, to whom, as to all really typical\r\nmasters, his slaves were but a little lower in his affections than his\r\nchildren? Or was it unconscious approval of the resistance by the south\r\nwith all her might against the emancipation proclamation, the end of which\r\nmay be the wholesale destruction of the black race in America, such\r\napproval being suggested by a cosmic influence as yet inexplicable?\r\n\r\nWhen he was going through Mrs. Hill's yard to enter her house, little\r\ngirls on each side of the walk threw bouquets before him, every one\r\nbegging, \"Mr. Davis, please step on my flowers.\" The feeble man tried to\r\ngratify all of them. The flowers that he did step on were eagerly caught\r\nup by the owners, to be treasured as the dearest of relics and keepsakes.\r\n\r\nI was told that some old grayhead who met him during the day, gently\r\nraised Mr. Davis's hands to his lips, saying, \"Let me kiss the hands that\r\nwere manacled for me,\" and as he kissed his tears fell in a flood.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just described occurred in Georgia--a State in which of all\r\nduring the brothers' war the most formidable opposition to his\r\nadministration was developed. This opposition was lead or upheld by\r\nToombs, both the Stephenses, and Brown--the most influential of all the\r\nGeorgians at that time. That for all this the State gave him this\r\nwonderful ovation shows how deep and strong is the southern sentiment that\r\nglorifies the lost cause. It was Henry Grady, a Georgian revering and\r\ntreasuring the men I have just mentioned, who when Mr. Davis was in\r\nAtlanta, in 1886, called him the uncrowned king of our hearts, the words\r\nevoking plaudits from the entire south. And remember that Georgia voted\r\nfor Greeley in 1872, although Toombs and the Stephenses opposed him. I\r\nthink I was representative of the dominant public feeling at the time.\r\nWhile my companions and I avowed the fullest confidence in Greeley's\r\nintegrity and statesmanship, we each said we were in haste to honor with\r\nour votes the northern man who got Mr. Davis bailed and became one of his\r\nsureties. And Georgia is among the States which has made June 3 a legal\r\nholiday, because it is the anniversary of Mr. Davis's birth.\r\n\r\nSome northern paper sympathetically described the reception given Mr.\r\nDavis in Atlanta, in 1886, as the swan song of the southern confederacy.\r\nAnd to me it has always been the funeral of the old south. But there were\r\nother obsequies and swan songs. When he died December 6, 1889, the south\r\nsorrowed as it never sorrowed before. We are pleased to quote from the\r\nmemoir, the noblest monument a true wife has ever given a dead\r\nhusband--far nobler, more splendid and immortal than that which Artemisia\r\ngave Mausolus. Mrs. Davis tells:\r\n\r\n    \"Floral offerings came from all quarters of our country. The orphan\r\n    asylum, the colleges, the societies, drew upon their little stores to\r\n    deck his quiet resting-place. Many thousands passed weeping by the\r\n    bier where he lay in state, in his suit of confederate gray, guarded\r\n    by the men who had fought for the cause he loved, and who revered his\r\n    honest, self-denying, devoted life. His old comrades in arms came by\r\n    thousands to mingle their tears with ours. The governors of nine\r\n    states came to bear him to his rest. The clergy of all denominations\r\n    came to pray that his rest be peaceful, and to testify their respect\r\n    for and faith in him. Fifty thousand people lined the streets as the\r\n    catafalque passed. Few, if any, dry eyes looked their last upon him\r\n    who had given them his life's service. The noble army of the West and\r\n    that of Northern Virginia escorted him for the last time, and the\r\n    Washington Artillery, now gray-haired men, were the guard of honor to\r\n    his bier. The eloquent Bishops of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the\r\n    clergy of all denominations, delivered short eulogies upon him to\r\n    weeping thousands, and the strains of 'Rock of Ages,' once more bore\r\n    up a great spirit in its flight to Him who gave, sustained, and took\r\n    it again to himself.\"\r\n\r\nThese aptly chosen words come short of describing the general grief.\r\nNobody can yet tell all of it. One but feebly expresses it by saying that\r\nwhen Jefferson Davis died, broken-hearted men, women, and children\r\ngathered in funeral assemblies everywhere in that vast area from Mason and\r\nDixon's line on the north to the Mexican border on the south, wept over\r\nhis bier, and hung the air and heavens with black.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 his remains were carried to Richmond, the dead capital of the dead\r\nConfederate States, and there reinterred. The ceremonies were impressive,\r\nand thoroughly in keeping with those I have narrated in the foregoing.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1896 the corner-stone of a monument to him was laid in Monroe Park.\r\nOn this occasion General Stephen D. Lee delivered an oration which, as a\r\nmonument itself, will long outlast the stone one.\r\n\r\nThus has the overthrown and most evilly entreated president of the\r\nConfederate States become, by some marvel of fortune, far more than the\r\nproudest conqueror. The honors which every one who \"can above himself\r\nerect himself\" estimates as the very richest, Mr. Davis has had given him\r\nmore prodigally than any other man. These honors that make everything else\r\nshabby in appearance and cheap, are the spontaneous offerings of sincere\r\nlove from those who know us. Smiles, tender words, prayers for blessing,\r\ntears of joy, admiration, pity, and sympathy, flowers--how dear are any of\r\nthese from a friend, brother, sister, father, mother, sweetheart, wife,\r\nchild. For almost a generation all these tokens were given the\r\nex-president by everybody in the south, and each year to his death they\r\nwere given in greater profusion. And really the whole south mourned at his\r\nburial. Our wives, mothers, and other dear ones give us up, and we give,\r\nthem up, to fight and perhaps die for the country. We are so made that we\r\nlove the great brotherhood better than we do ourselves. And so an offering\r\nof regard from that brotherhood--to be made to feel that throughout the\r\nwhole of it one is recognized as most worthy of love--the true man would\r\nprize this above every other. Before this time this great honor has been\r\ngiven only by happy ones to their victors--to such as Washington, Lincoln,\r\nGrant. But the south has begun a new era. In the misery and ruin of her\r\nsubjugation she magnifies her deposed chief. Much of the applause heaped\r\nupon the victor is selfish and feigned, but the whole of that given the\r\nconquered hero comes direct and straight from the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen. It seems, therefore, to me that this decoration of the\r\nconquered hero is the crown of crowns of this world. It is Davis's\r\nhistorical uniqueness that he has won this lone crown.\r\n\r\nThe achievement is so counter to common-sense that it is not yet credited\r\nnor understood. I cannot help believing that when all the fog raised by\r\nthe brothers' war has cleared away, and our historians tell what brought\r\nand what followed that war with unclouded vision of cosmic agency, that\r\nJefferson Davis will be permanently placed high in the American temple of\r\nfame. There he will be the world's contemplation, showing something like\r\nHester Prynne. As what was at first to her the branding placard of guilt\r\nturned to a badge of the greatest righteousness, so has that which was\r\nunutterable obloquy and disgrace to him become unparalleled fortune and\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE OF SLAVERY TO THE WHITE, AND ITS BLESSING TO THE NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe master got the curse and the negro the blessing of slavery.\r\n\r\nWe set out by mentioning how certain ants have been injured by becoming\r\nmasters. Before this they were doubtless the equals of any\r\nnon-slaveholding tribe in self-maintenance. Now they \"are waited upon and\r\nfed by their slaves, and when the slaves are taken away the masters perish\r\nmiserably.\"[139] It did not become so bad as this with human slaveholders;\r\nbut the consequent disadvantage was very great, as we shall now exemplify\r\nwith some detail. We shall throughout keep to the average and typical man\r\nand woman. And for brevity's sake, we shall not look beyond the domestic\r\nand agricultural spheres, because when the reader has learned what slavery\r\ndid in these, he can of himself easily add the little required to make\r\ncomplete statement of its entire effect.\r\n\r\nIn non-slave communities baby is tended only by mother and near relatives.\r\nThough petted and indulged, it is steadily constrained into more obedience\r\nto those who tend it. In due time the child is taking care of itself in\r\nmany things, and is also doing light chores. Until the parental roof has\r\nbeen left he or she has every day something to do. What we may call the\r\nopen-air home-work is done by the boys, and the inside by the girls. But\r\nin the old south baby commenced its life as a slaveholder with a nurse\r\nthat it learned to command by inarticulate cries and signs before it could\r\ntalk. And to the end, as grandfather or grandmother, self-service in many\r\ncommon things, as is usual with all other people, was never learned, but\r\ngreat expertness in getting these things done by slaves was learned\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nI was only fifteen years old in 1851, when I entered the sophomore class\r\nin Princeton College, never having been out of the south before. Of course\r\nmuch of my time at first was consumed in observing and thinking over many\r\nsights very novel and strange to me. I came in August. Soon afterwards I\r\nsaw them saving their Indian corn. In the south we \"pulled\" the fodder,\r\nand some weeks later we \"pulled\" the corn, leaving the stripped stalks\r\nstanding. But the New Jersey farmers, without removing the blades or the\r\nears, cut the stalks down, put them up in stacks, and after a while hauled\r\nthem to the barn. This was such a wonder that I described it minutely in a\r\nletter to my mother. The next great surprise that I had was to note the\r\nlady of the family and her daughters doing everything in and about the\r\nhouse, which I used to see at home only the negroes do. They were\r\nmarvellously more expert and neat in despatch than the negroes. Their easy\r\nand, as it seemed, effortless way of getting through their daily\r\nemployment grew upon me steadily. What I intently observed in those times\r\nand reflected over much subsequently, I have had a recent experience to\r\nrefresh and enforce. In the summer of 1902 two ladies from Pennsylvania\r\ntook a house in Atlanta next to mine. They had never before been in the\r\nsouth. I found out these lonely strangers at once, and was soon seeing\r\nmuch of them. They kept no servant. The two did all the household tasks.\r\nThe younger washed the clothes. This is something which but few city\r\nsouthern ladies, except those whose ancestors were not slaveholders, have\r\never consented to do. The laundry of even the poorest families in our\r\ntowns is nearly always the care of a negro washerwoman. Although their\r\nwork was every day punctually done by my two new-found friends, and their\r\nhouse always the tidiest, like the New Jersey ladies of my boyhood at\r\nPrinceton, they were never flustered nor worried, but were always pleasant\r\nand agreeable.\r\n\r\nPlainly they lived in far more ease and comfort than the native\r\nhousekeepers. There are two classes of the latter. In one is the woman who\r\nis greatly plagued by the waste, dishonesty, and eye-service of her negro\r\ncook and housemaid, and always in craven fear that she will wake up some\r\nmorning to know that they have taken French leave. In the other class is\r\nthe woman who often must, with the help only of her children, do\r\neverything at home. What a laborious, fatiguing botch they make of it!\r\nTheir day-dream all the year round is to find that needle in a haystack, a\r\nservant who will take no more than the established holidays and always\r\ncome in time to get breakfast.\r\n\r\nI sorrow for these present housekeepers of the south. They all know by\r\nheart and often retell to their children the tales of their mothers and\r\ngrandmothers,--how, early in the morning, the affectionate and faithful\r\nnurses stole the children out of the room, without waking papa and mamma;\r\nhow the cook and the waiters, not superintended, had the best of\r\nbreakfasts ready at the right time; how at this meal there was happy\r\nreunion of the family beginning a new day, the children bathed and in\r\ntheir clean clothes, each one pretty as a picture and sweet as a pink; and\r\nhow all the affairs of the household under the magic touch of angel\r\nservants were fitly despatched without trouble or worry to mamma, until\r\nthe day ended by the nurses' bathing the little tots again, putting them\r\nto bed, and mammy's getting them to sleep by telling \"The Tar Baby\" or\r\nsome other adventure of Brer Rabbit over and over as often as sleepily\r\ncalled for, or by singing sweet lullabies. With this vision of a real\r\nfairyland in which their ancestors lived not so very long ago, how can any\r\none of these mothers of the new south contentedly make herself the only\r\nnurse, cook, and house servant of her family? For many a year yet, to do\r\nevery day the drudgery of all three will be the extreme of discomfort and\r\nsore trial to her. We must give her loving words and sympathy without\r\nceasing, and trust her to the slow but sure healing of inevitable\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThis lamentable condition of our southern woman is due, as plainly\r\nappears, to the miseducation given their ancestors by slavery. Slavery\r\nwent forty years ago; but it left the negro, and the dependence of these\r\nwomen upon her as their only servant. It is indispensable that they cut\r\nloose completely from this dependence. Their resolve should be firm and\r\nunwavering that they will learn to minister to themselves and their dear\r\nones, and teach the blessed art to their children; as their northern\r\nsisters have always done. I would have them here receptively contemplate,\r\nas a part of the new lesson which they must learn, this true and\r\nenchanting picture of a New England home:\r\n\r\n    \"There are no servants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap,\r\n    with the spectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her\r\n    daughters, as if nothing had ever been done, or were to be done,--she\r\n    and her girls, in some long-forgotten forepart of the day _did up the\r\n    work_, and for the rest of the time, probably, at all hours when you\r\n    would see them, it is _done up_. The old kitchen floor never seems\r\n    stained or spotted; the tables, the chairs, and the various cooking\r\n    utensils never seem deranged or disordered; though three and sometimes\r\n    four meals a day are got there, though the family washing and ironing\r\n    is there performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some\r\n    silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence.\"[140]\r\n\r\nOf course it is not to be demanded that the southern woman exactly\r\nreproduce the New England system of fifty years ago just described by Mrs.\r\nStowe. But she must learn to be entirely independent of servants in the\r\nera of co-operation, electric dish-washers, and other helping machines,\r\nabout to begin.\r\n\r\nLet us see how it has been with the fathers and boys. The planting of the\r\nold south required proportionally less cash outlay annually than any\r\ncommon business that I now call to mind. The owner of 750 acres of\r\nland--an ordinary plantation--worth $6,000, thirty slaves worth $18,000,\r\nand mules and live-stock worth $1,000, had usually but five considerable\r\nitems of expense: the overseer with his family was \"found\"--to use the\r\nthen current vogue--and paid not more than $150 yearly wages; a few sacks\r\nof salt to save the pork--a little to be given the live animals\r\noccasionally; a few bars of iron for the plantation blacksmith shop--the\r\nlatter being furnished with bellows, anvil, tongs, screwplate, vise, and a\r\nfew other tools, all hardly amounting to $100 investment; sometimes coarse\r\ncotton and woollen cloth for the clothes of the negroes, made by the\r\nslave-women tailors (even in my day this cloth was, on many plantations,\r\nspun and wove at home from the cotton and wool grown by the owner); and\r\nthe fifth item was a moderate bill of the family physician for attendance\r\nupon the sick slaves. The whole would seldom amount to $350; and remember\r\nthe income yielding capital was $25,000. This planter paid no wages for\r\nhis labor; he bred his slaves, and all animals serving for work, food, or\r\npleasure;--in short, the establishment was self-supporting. The good\r\nmanager sold every year more than enough of meat, grain, and other produce\r\nto pay the expense itemed a moment ago, and so the $1,200 from the sale of\r\nhis crop of thirty bales of cotton was often net income.\r\n\r\nThe natural increase of slaves which I have explained above operated in\r\nmany cases to encourage wastefulness and idleness. But even in the\r\nmajority of these cases the estates more than held their own.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate the change wrought by emancipation by having you to\r\ncontemplate a small middle Georgia farmer of to-day. If he employ but four\r\nhands to his two plows, he will, in wages, fertilizers that have come into\r\ngeneral use since the war, purchase of meat, corn, and other supplies that\r\nthe slaves used to produce, necessarily lay out annually more than did the\r\nplanter making thirty bales as we mentioned above. If this small farmer\r\nmakes twenty bales--which is far above the average--worth, if the price\r\nbe, say, eight cents, $800--more than half of it will be needed to cover\r\nhis outlay. It is to be emphasized that as a general rule this farmer and\r\nhis boys have not yet been trained to work as steadily and diligently as\r\ntheir circumstances demand of them. As the women slight in the house what\r\nthey regard as fit employment only of negroes, so the men do the same in\r\nthe farm. The whites of both sexes cling to the negro instead of making\r\ngood workers of themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the old south money grew of itself. Now constant alertness is needed to\r\nsee that every dollar laid out comes back, if not with addition, at least\r\nwithout loss. To keep from falling behind, the farmer must have a very\r\nmuch higher degree of mercantile capacity than he could ever acquire under\r\nthe old system. And he and his boys ought to supplant much of the negro\r\nlabor he now employs by their own systematic and steady work. All these\r\nnecessary lessons are very hard to learn, because to do that we must first\r\nunlearn widely different ones.\r\n\r\nThis examination shows that the men of the new south are almost as\r\ninadequate to the demands of the day as we found the women to be.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that our women and men have not improved at all in\r\ntheir respective spheres in the last forty years. I believe that when due\r\nallowance is made for the unavoidable effect upon them of the system into\r\nwhich they were all born it must be conceded that the little improvement\r\nwhich they have made is greater than what could have been reasonably\r\nexpected. But I see clearly that the habits of thought and the modes of\r\nhouse and farm economy, bred first from our contact with the negro slave\r\nand then with the negro freedman, are yet an oppressively heavy load upon\r\nour section.\r\n\r\nI have now to do with a still greater evil as part of the curse of slavery\r\nto the southern whites; which is, that it prevented the normal rise in the\r\nsection of a white labor class. If one but look steadily at developments,\r\neither now in progress or surely impending, in Germany, France, England,\r\nthe English colonies, and the United States he sees that the workers most\r\nof all are influencing the other classes to pursue the best policy in all\r\ndepartments of government. The truth is that in every stage of society\r\nthere is the leading energy of some particular class. Let me make you\r\nreflect over a few well-known examples. In their unremitted struggle with\r\nthe patricians, the plebeians of Rome gradually climbed out of their low\r\nestate into complete political, civil, and social equality with the former\r\nwho had long been the constituency of the so-called republic. Some\r\ncenturies later a tacit combination of those belonging to each division of\r\nthe middle class dried all the fountains of civil disorder and made\r\ndomestic peace sure and permanent by establishing the Roman empire. Much\r\nlater employers of the free labor which had displaced slavery made\r\nEuropean towns democratic, and set them in such strong array against the\r\nfeudal barons that the latter were at last restrained from plundering the\r\nnew industry. The American revolution and the French revolution were each\r\nmainly middle-class movements. By them the middle class cleared out of its\r\nway, as far as it could, distinctions of birth, title, rank, and all other\r\nspecial personal privileges. But, unawares, it put in the place of the old\r\nhereditary lords and monopolists, known as such by everybody, a nobility\r\nin disguise. The members of this nobility make no claim to our labor or\r\nsubstance by reason of their having had such and such fathers or having\r\nreceived such and such grants or patents to themselves as natural persons.\r\nThey pose as government agents in such functions as the transportation and\r\nmonetary, of which efficient, cheap, and impartial performance is vital to\r\nthe general welfare. Clandestinely they have had the law of the land made\r\nor interpreted and the practice of government shaped each as they want it;\r\nand sitting in their masks wherever these sovereign powers must be invoked\r\nby producer or worker, it is these usurpers and not the legitimate public\r\nauthorities who must be applied to and given, not the just cost of the\r\nservice, but the supreme extortion possible. These masked rulers toll our\r\nwages, profits, and property as insidiously and deeply as does indirect\r\ncompared with direct taxation. In fact they are government licensees,\r\nlevying upon us for their own benefit all the indirect taxation that we\r\ncan bear. Some--I may say, a large number--of middle-class property owners\r\nand producers are heart and soul in strong and strengthening resistance\r\nnow forming against the tyrants they have unwittingly set up. But the\r\ninitiative and most effective elements of this benign uprising do not come\r\nfrom the middle class. It was the workers who excited and kept at its\r\nheight the righteous indignation of the country that shamed the coal-trust\r\ninto decency. It is the workers who are the most influential of all that\r\nstrive to arm us with those plutocracy-destroying weapons, direct\r\nnomination and direct legislation; and of all who demand that the\r\nrailroads pay just taxes; of all who would lay the axe at the root of\r\npublic corruption by having government resume its powers and do every one\r\nof its duties without favor or prejudice to a single human being. It is\r\nclear that the laborers are gathering all the anti-monopoly interests and\r\nclasses of society to their banner, and that from the steady and\r\nincreasing impulsion of these laborers, in unions and political campaigns,\r\nindustrial democracy will at last come in, to open the millennium by\r\nkeeping every man, woman, and child, except the wilfully idle and\r\ncriminal, permanently supplied with necessaries and comforts.\r\n\r\nWho are the laborers that are both to spur and lead us forward in this\r\ngreat course? Why, the white laborers, whose interests and whose\r\nqualifications to share in governments are the same as those of the rest\r\nof us; who are really part and parcel of the body politic and whose sons\r\nand daughters can be married by our sons and daughters without social\r\ndegradation to themselves or degeneration of the proud Caucasian stock in\r\ntheir children. The negroes cannot do the great work we are contemplating.\r\nThey are strangers in blood. They are as yet far too low in development.\r\nIt is idle to think of making these aliens, whose highest interests are\r\nirreconcilably antagonistic to ours and our children's, allies of the\r\nwhite laborers--a point which will be treated at large in later chapters.\r\n\r\nTo bring out the situation more clearly, suppose that instead of the eight\r\nmillions of negroes now in the south we had eight millions of native white\r\nworkers and no negroes at all. Would it not be far better for us of the\r\nsection? Would it not be far better for the anti-monopoly cause in the\r\nnorth? Ought there not to be a real labor party in the south instead of\r\nwhat we now see? The so-called labor party of the south has a large\r\npercentage of leaders whose chief activity is to win positions in the\r\nunions, in agitation, in the city and State government wherein they can\r\nserve themselves by delivering the labor vote to corporate interests, or\r\ndoing the latter legislative or official favor--a sure symptom that the\r\nmovement is as yet merely incipient. In no northern State have the\r\nrailroads and allied corporations such complete command of nominative,\r\nappointive, and legislative machinery as in Georgia; and it seems to me\r\nthat Georgia is but fairly representative of all the south except South\r\nCarolina, which has advanced further in direct nomination than any other\r\none of the United States. In many places the people of the north are\r\nsuccessfully rising against the corporation oligarchs. In New York and\r\nMichigan the latter have been made to pay some of the taxes which they had\r\nalways been dodging. In a recent Boston referendum the street railroad,\r\nwhich for years had ridden roughshod over the public at will, was snowed\r\nunder, although it had the machine, all the five daily papers but one, and\r\nthe outside of that, fighting for it with might and main. Los Angeles,\r\nfollowed by three or four other towns, has just made a beginning with the\r\n_Recall_. Oregon has direct legislation. Illinois has pushed ahead with\r\nboth direct nomination and direct legislation. Cities here and there, in\r\nvery grateful contrast with the apathy prevalent in this section, have\r\nawakened to the importance of rightly guarding the common property in\r\npublic-service franchises. I could cite many other examples which show\r\nthat the anti-plutocratic tide gathers force all over the north. Why is it\r\nthat there is this blessed insurgence against corporation misrule there,\r\nand hardly a trace of it here? Simply because the north has and the south\r\nhas not the motor of insurgence--a real labor class, growing steadily in\r\nzeal and organization, and rapidly increasing in numbers.\r\n\r\nThat a southern State has no real labor class with potent influence upon\r\nthe public, puts it as far behind the most enlightened communities in\r\npolitical and governmental condition, as it was with its slaves behind\r\nthem in productive condition. Such a State lacks a most essential organ of\r\nthe highest types of democracy.[141]\r\n\r\nTo sum up: Slavery disqualified the white men and women of the south for\r\nthe domestic and business management proper to this era; and ever since\r\nemancipation the presence of a large number of negroes available for labor\r\nin house and on the farm, and preventing the coming in of any other labor,\r\nhas powerfully helped both races in their efforts naturally made to retain\r\nthe familiar ways of the old system. Thus the south has been sadly\r\nretarded in her due economical rehabilitation. In the second place, it has\r\nkept the political influence of labor at the minimum, and consequently\r\nsent her backwards in true democracy, while England, the English\r\ncolonies, and the northern States, are slowly but surely going forward.\r\n\r\nThese are the main things. Let me in briefest mention suggest some of\r\ntheir results, which, at first blush, seem to be independent.\r\n\r\nSlavery engendered among the whites a disrespect for labor, which,\r\nalthough now at last dying out, is still of hurtful influence.\r\n\r\nAs negroes were always and everywhere in number sufficient to do every\r\ntask of labor, there was but little demand for labor-saving machines and\r\nmethods--a fact which prevented the southern whites from developing the\r\ninventive faculty equally with their northern brothers. We all are\r\nbeginning to see that, except in much of agriculture and other activities\r\nin which the process is that of nature and not of art, the future of\r\nindustry belongs more and more to the constantly improving machine.\r\n\r\nThink of such things as these in the brood of evils brought forth by\r\nslavery;--agriculture primitive or superannuated in many particulars; our\r\nentire structure of investment, production, and occupation bottomed upon\r\nslaves, property in which could be, and was, totally destroyed by a stroke\r\nof the pen; immigration both from Europe and the north repelled; slowness\r\nin exploiting our water power and mines; inferior common schools, and lack\r\nof town-meeting government due to the sparseness of the population and\r\ntheir roving habits which were incident to the plantation system. I have\r\ngiven some consideration to these in the \"Old and New South,\" and I refer\r\nyou to that.[142]\r\n\r\nOf course had there never been any negro slavery in America we should have\r\nescaped the brothers' war, its spilling of blood, its waste of wealth, and\r\nthe long sickness of the section unto death which has ensued. And to-day\r\nin solid prosperity, institutions, government, and progressiveness in\r\neverything good, the section would be abreast of the other. Nay, her\r\nbetter climate, her agricultural products--especially her cotton, which\r\nshe would have learned to make with white labor--these and other resources\r\nwould, I fully believe, have by this time pushed her far into the lead. As\r\nit actually is, she is far, far behind. She has been sorely scourged, not\r\nfor any moral guilt.\r\n\r\n  \"Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.\"\r\n\r\nIt was because she did that which the wisest and best had done--the Greeks\r\nwho gave the world culture and democracy, the Jews who gave it religion,\r\nthe Romans who gave it law and civil institutions. She really did far\r\nbetter than they did. She did not enslave the free. She merely took some\r\nof the only inveterate slaves upon earth out of lawless slavery, in which\r\nthey would have otherwise remained indefinitely without recognition of the\r\ndearest human rights, and placed them in a far other slavery which was for\r\nthem an unparalleled rise in liberty and well-being; which was, as becomes\r\nmore and more probable with time, the only opportunity by which any\r\nconsiderable portion of the negro race can ever evolve upward into the\r\ncapability of enlightened self-government. In doing this she unconsciously\r\nantagonized the purposes of the iron-hearted powers guarding the American\r\nunion, and when the critical moment of that union came, they dashed her to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nIt will be many a year before the pathos of southern history can be fully\r\ntold. I must satisfy myself here by saying only that the curse of African\r\nslavery to her has been of magnitude and weight incredible, and that one\r\ncannot yet be sure when it will end.\r\n\r\nThe title of the chapter demands that I now tell you of the blessing of\r\nAfrican slavery in the United States to the negro. Of course there are\r\nmany who have been born into the unequalified condemnation of every form\r\nof slavery, which was resolutely preached for years all over the north by\r\nconscientious men and women of great ability and influence. Such will\r\nexclaim against me, and perhaps some of them will not even read the rest\r\nof the chapter. But it is my note, which becomes surer and more confident\r\nevery year, that the great body of men and women shrink from every\r\nover-positively urged dogma. I have already mentioned those who are trying\r\nto curb the evils of drink. All the while an increasing majority of them\r\nrecognize that to assert that any use of liquor, wine, or beer is a moral\r\nwrong, as do a noisy few in season and out of season, is too extreme to be\r\ntrue or even politic. The ultra democrat will zealously justify the\r\nassassination of Julius Caesar, while the wisest friends of the people\r\nbecome more firmly convinced every century that the empire which Caesar\r\nfounded was, by reason of the circumstances, the best possible government\r\nfor the Romans of that and the succeeding times;--the surest guaranty that\r\nthe main benefits of ancient civilization should be preserved for the\r\nhuman race. And as there has now and then been something of substantial\r\ngood in even absolute government, there has also been good to the slave in\r\nhis slavery. Surely it was an improvement of the captor and a bettering of\r\nthe condition of the prisoner of war, not to barbecue the latter, as was\r\nthe custom for ages, but to have him work for a master. Perhaps the\r\nfabulist AEsop had been a slave. Terence, a great Roman dramatist, surely\r\nhad been. Horace's father had been one. It may well be true that it was\r\nslavery that gave each one of these three immortals his opportunity. The\r\nmore familiar you become with ancient history the larger you estimate the\r\nnumber of those to have been who as slaves got many of the benefits of\r\nGreek and Roman civilization, which benefits they afterwards transmitted\r\nto free descendants. I need not repeat what I have already told--how the\r\nnegroes in the mass were advantaged by transfer from slavery in Africa to\r\nslavery in America. But do let me inquire, would Professor DuBois have\r\never outstripped all the white children in a New England school, graduated\r\ncreditably from two American universities, studied at the university of\r\nBerlin, acquired the degree of Master of Arts and then that of Doctor of\r\nPhilosophy, been made in sociology fellow of Harvard and assistant of the\r\nuniversity of Pennsylvania, become president of the American Negro\r\nAcademy, got the professorship of economics and history in Atlanta\r\nUniversity, and pushed forward as an author into prominent and most\r\nrespectable place; all before he was thirty-six years old--would Professor\r\nDuBois have surpassed this brilliant career, if an \"evil, Dutch trader\"\r\nhad not seized his \"grandfather's grandmother--two centuries ago\"?[143] If\r\nthe transfer just mentioned had not been made what would now be Fred\r\nDouglass, Booker Washington, Richard R. Wright, Professor DuBois, Bishop\r\nTurner, and other great negroes, their good works and glory? Would Hayti\r\nhave arranged for some of its young men to be trained in farming at\r\nTuskegee? more especially do I ask, would negroes educated at Tuskegee be\r\nnow teaching the missionaries how to christianize the Africans of\r\nTogoland? Who would now be arousing people north and south in behalf of\r\nthe race? and where could nine millions of blacks be found--or even half a\r\nmillion--as far above the African level of to-day as ours?\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that the whites and the negroes of the south ought to\r\nlearn wisdom and interchange their holidays and great annual rejoicings.\r\nThe former ought to keep the anniversary of the emancipation proclamation\r\nas the southern 4th of July, and the blacks ought to observe that day by\r\nwearing mourning and eating bitter herbs. Further, the negroes of America\r\nought to celebrate the day when the Dutch ship landed the first Africans\r\nat Jamestown as the dawn of their hopes as a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHERS ON EACH SIDE WERE TRUE PATRIOTS AND MORALLY RIGHT--BOTH THOSE\r\nWHO FOUGHT FOR THE UNION, AND THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE CONFEDERACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposition of the heading has really been demonstrated in the\r\nforegoing chapters. I feel that the demonstration should have impressive\r\nenforcement. It will surely be for the great good of our country if the\r\nbrothers of each section be truly convinced that those of the other were\r\nmorally right in the slavery struggle from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by noting the ambiguity of the word \"right.\" Something may be\r\nright in expediency, policy, or reason, and yet wrong ethically. Likewise\r\nsomething may be a mistake and wrong in policy while it is right in\r\nmorals. General Sherman was a conspicuous example of the almost universal\r\nproneness to confound right in the sense first mentioned above with it in\r\nthe other. The two are widely different--not merely in degree, but in\r\nkind. That which is right or wrong in expediency is decided by the\r\nunderstanding--by the head; that which is right or wrong ethically is\r\ndecided for every human being by his own conscience--by his heart. To try\r\nwith all my might to do a particular thing may be my highest moral duty;\r\nto try with all your might to keep me from doing it may be yours. The\r\nbrothers who set up the southern confederacy and defended it, the brothers\r\nwho warred upon it and overturned it--they were on each side sublimely\r\nconscientious; for every one--to use the high word of Lincoln--was doing\r\nthe right as God gave him to see it. No people ever waged a war with\r\ndeeper and more solemn conviction of duty than did our northern brothers.\r\nRome, rising unvanquished from every great victory of Hannibal, much as\r\nshe has been most justly lauded by foremost historians, fell behind them\r\nin supreme effort--in undaunted perseverance in spite of disaster after\r\ndisaster until the difficulty insuperable was overcome. We of the south\r\nshould be proud of this unparalleled achievement of our brothers. Most of\r\nall should we be proud of the complete self-abnegation and unwavering\r\nobedience to conscience with which they waded a sea of blood, for the\r\nwelfare of future generations rather than their own. I am glad to observe\r\nthat many who most affectionately remember the lost cause have come at\r\nlast to concede without qualification that the restoration of the union by\r\nforce of arms was morally right. But I note that as yet only a few at the\r\nnorth--men like Dr. Lyman Abbott, Mr. Charles F. Adams, and Professor\r\nWendell--have learned that the south, in all that she did in \"The Great\r\nWar,\"[144] was likewise morally right. To show that the confederates were\r\nexemplary champions of a legitimate government, I need not repeat what I\r\nhave said above when I told how southern nationalization had given them a\r\ncountry of their own as dear to them and as much mistress of their\r\nconsciences as the union was to the northern people. If there are those\r\nwho cannot bring themselves to allow the all-potent coercion of the\r\nnationalization mentioned as justification, and who still think of us as\r\ntraitors and rebels, I beg them to give due consideration to the feelings\r\nwith which the southerner now looks back upon his life in the confederate\r\narmy. I call a most convincing witness to testify. I do not know a man who\r\never followed what his conscience pronounced right more faithfully, who\r\nwas truer to the better traditions of the old south, and who was a more\r\ndevoted soldier in the brothers' war, nor do I know another who now draws\r\nfrom every class in his community more respect for real manhood and\r\nhonesty. All who know him will believe his word against an oracle or an\r\nangel. Here is what he said thirty-seven years after the close of the war:\r\n\r\n    \"That period of my life is the one with which I am the most nearly\r\n    satisfied. A persistent, steady effort to do my duty--an effort\r\n    persevered in in the midst of privation, hardship, and danger. If ever\r\n    I was unselfish, it was then. If ever I was capable of self-denial, it\r\n    was then. If ever I was able to trample on self-indulgence, it was\r\n    then. If ever I was strong to make sacrifices, even unto death, it was\r\n    in those days; and if I were called upon to say on the peril of my\r\n    soul, when it lived its highest life, when it was least faithless to\r\n    true manhood, when it was most loyal to the best part of man's nature,\r\n    I would answer, 'It was when I followed a battle-torn flag through its\r\n    shifting fortune of victory and defeat.'\r\n\r\n    My comrades, how easy it is to name the word that characterizes and\r\n    strikes the keynote of that time and should explain our pride to all\r\n    the world--self sacrifice--that spirit and that conduct which raise\r\n    poor mortals nearest to divinity. Oh, God in heaven, what sacrifices\r\n    did we not make! How our very heart strings were torn as we turned\r\n    from our home, our parents, our children!... How poor we were! How\r\n    ragged! How hungry! When I recall the light-heartedness, the courage,\r\n    the cheerfulness, the fidelity to duty which lived and flourished\r\n    under such circumstances, from the bottom of my heart I thank God that\r\n    for four long years I wore, if not brilliantly, at least faithfully\r\n    and steadfastly, in camp and bivouac, in advance and retreat, on the\r\n    march and on the battlefield, the uniform of a confederate\r\n    soldier.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThe passage just quoted most truly expresses the feelings with which the\r\nsouthern people stood by their cause and now look back upon the support\r\nwhich they gave it. In this matter their word will be taken by everybody.\r\nTheir actions before, during, and ever since the war speak louder than\r\ntheir word. There can be no doubt that in founding the Confederate States\r\nand waging the resulting war everything they did was counselled by the\r\nmost tender and enlightened conscience. Bear in mind how they clung to\r\nDavis and how they still remember him, winning the precious eulogy\r\n\r\n            \"--he that can endure\r\n  To follow with allegiance a fallen lord\r\n  Does conquer him that did his master conquer,\r\n  And earns a place i' the story.\"\r\n\r\nBear in mind how truly they keep Memorial Day. The love which the south\r\ngives Davis and her dead soldiers protests to all the earth and heaven the\r\nrighteousness of her lost cause. Calmly, serenely, confidently she awaits\r\nfuture judgment upon her love. It needs that all the north appreciate this\r\nfealty as the height of heaven-climbing virtue.\r\n\r\nThe real soldiers of each section--those who--to use a confederate\r\nsaying--were \"in the bullet department,\" and fighting every day, learned\r\ngreat regard for their foes; and when the war ended they became at once\r\nadvocates of speedy reconciliation. And the non-combatants on each side\r\nfelt far less resentment towards the actual fighters of the other than\r\nthey did towards its political leaders. It is a common error to overrate\r\nthe accomplishment of potent and ambitious men in tumultuous times. As the\r\nworld long ascribed meteorological phenomena to the mutations of the moon,\r\nconspicuous above all things else as the apparent cause, so most people\r\nnow believe that revolutions are caused by the men who appear to be\r\nleading. We have explained above that the only effective leaders--even of\r\nrevolutions--are those who are the most completely led by the people. To\r\nlead, the leader must keep on the tide and let it lead him. If he makes\r\nserious effort to balk it, he is at once stranded as a piece of drift\r\nthrown out of the current. All of us--both those north and those south of\r\nMason and Dixon's line--ought to learn this truth thoroughly. The former\r\nshould correct their false judgments as to Calhoun, Toombs, Yancey, and\r\nDavis; the latter as to Sumner, Garrison, and Phillips. It was but to be\r\nexpected that these false judgments would be cherished all through what we\r\nmay call the era of civil fury. That begins with the excitement over the\r\nadmission of California and extends to the time after the war when the\r\nproject of giving a negro constituency the balance of political power in\r\neach southern State was abandoned. But now as the brothers can look back\r\nupon those evil days with at least the beginning of dispassionate\r\ncalmness, the task of convincing the whole people of each section that the\r\nmore prominent figures of the other in the era mentioned were all true men\r\nand patriots, should be pushed forward with his whole might by every one\r\nwho loves his country. It is not demanded that we claim too much for them.\r\nTo begin illustrating: Toombs's Tremont Temple lecture on slavery is such\r\nan able and powerful defence of the south that its reputation must forever\r\nincrease. Yet as we consider it now we see that what he believed with all\r\nhis heart to be the perpetual pillar and weal of his community was in fact\r\nits woe and ruin. We see, as to Calhoun, that if he had but given the\r\nresources of southern slavery against the implacable oppugnancy of free\r\nlabor, roused for decisive combat, the sure and marvellous vision with\r\nwhich he searched the innermost nature of money, he would have had to\r\nacknowledge that the proud structure of southern society was wholly\r\nbuilded upon sands. The rains descended and the floods beat, and we saw\r\nthe great fall. Of course we must admit that had our leaders been endowed\r\nwith unerring prescience they ought to have warned us, and striven heart\r\nand soul for compensated emancipation. I need merely allude to State\r\nsovereignty, treated fully above. We of the south now see that though in\r\nadvocating it we showed that the fathers were with us, and thus got the\r\nbetter of the argument, yet that the north was right in historical fact,\r\nand right also as to the true interest and welfare of America. Thus I have\r\nindicated some important acknowledgments which we of the south must make\r\nto our brothers of the north. Now I must state some that they must make to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe root-and-branch abolitionists and many following their lead\r\ninterpreted the statement in the declaration of independence that all men\r\nare created equal and with inalienable liberty as both intentional and\r\nactual condemnation of the slavery then existing in our country. They shut\r\ntheir eyes to the significant fact that the same document published to the\r\nworld, as one of the causes justifying the solemn act therein proclaimed,\r\nthat the king had \"excited domestic insurrections amongst us\"; which means\r\nhe had instigated the slaves to rise against their masters. Many of the\r\nsigners owned slaves then and to the end of their lives afterwards.\r\nPalpably the declaration did not mean to say that the negroes in America\r\nwere unjustly held in slavery, but did mean to say that inciting them--as\r\nJohn Brown with the approval of Phillips, Garrison, and such, afterwards\r\nsought to do--to gain their liberty by insurrection was inhuman and\r\natrocious. These root-and-branch abolitionists confidently alleged that\r\nslavery in America was proscribed by the christian religion. Yet Jesus,\r\nthe founder, who definitely reprehended every particular sin, never once\r\ndenounced slavery. Paul, or some one else, whom the canon accepts as\r\nspeaking with the authority of Jesus, says: \"All who are in the position\r\nof slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest\r\nrespect, so that the name of God, and our teaching may not be maligned.\r\nThose who have christian masters should not think less of them because\r\nthey are brothers, but on the contrary they should serve them all the\r\nbetter, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to\r\nthem as their fellow-christians. Those are the things to insist upon in\r\nyour teaching. Any one who teaches otherwise, and refuses his assent to\r\nsound instruction--_the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ_--and to the\r\nteaching of religion, is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing\r\nanything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments.\"[146]\r\n\r\nThe passage last quoted--to which several others from the new testament,\r\nalmost as strong, can be added--demonstrates that christianity did not\r\ndisapprove of slavery. Further, as I have already suggested, the slavery\r\nnot rebuked by Jesus and his apostles was mainly that of kin in blood and\r\nrace, of those who had been in a measure free themselves or descendants of\r\nthe free. The slaves of the south were far remote in blood, and their\r\nnative condition so bad that American slavery was for them elevation and\r\ngreat improvement.\r\n\r\nThe new testament, the declaration of independence, and the federal\r\nconstitution--surely three very respectable authorities, in America at\r\nleast--stand together in solid phalanx. They clearly demonstrate that the\r\ncharge that southern slavery was heinously wrong in itself, and that the\r\nmasters were wicked man-stealers and kidnappers, made for a long while in\r\nevery corner of the north, was mere opprobrium and abuse. Both sections\r\nought to learn that there was nothing in negro slavery to shock the moral\r\nsense, but that on the contrary it was in its general effect of the utmost\r\nbeneficence to the slave. Both ought to learn also that the white-hot zeal\r\nwith which the institution was fought was due mainly to these things:\r\n\r\n1. Free labor had long been in an uncompromising hand-to-hand struggle\r\nwith slave labor. Years before this commenced the employing class had\r\nsubconsciously divined it was far more profitable to hire the laborer only\r\nwhen his work was needed, and then let him go until he was needed again.\r\nThe worker with the advance of democracy had become more and more hostile\r\nto a system coercing his labor and denying him all political and civil\r\nrights. The co-operation of employer and laborer had expelled slavery of\r\nwhite men from Europe. The feeling towards slavery had become one of\r\ndecided opposition.\r\n\r\n2. In America the opposition to slavery was powerfully re-enforced, first,\r\nby the new cause the latter gave in competing with free labor for the\r\nunsettled public domain, and then in its operation to nationalize the\r\nsouth into a separate federation. With this combined the growing\r\nconception among the northern people of the negro as a man who had reached\r\nthe stage of development characterizing the typical white. This huge\r\nmistake, hugged to their bosoms and championed with unflagging zeal by the\r\nablest and most influential root-and-branch abolitionists, had a\r\nprodigious propagandic effect. It identified the cause of the negro slave,\r\nwhom evolution had not yet made ready for liberty, with that of the\r\noppressed European who had been long ready for it; and consequently that\r\ncause was continuously advocated with the passion which the French\r\nrevolution had started against human inequality. The root-and-branch\r\nabolitionists at last excited a pseudo-moral paroxysm among thousands at\r\nthe north and kept it increasing for a long while.\r\n\r\nFacts which cannot now be gainsaid plainly justify me in denying that\r\nconscientious conviction was the real primary motive. The northern and\r\nsouthern churches split, all the wisest and best of the former standing\r\nagainst, all those of the latter for slavery. You must see that their\r\nmoral convictions were secondary, not primary motives; that some superior\r\npower had given to one side to regard slavery as wrong and to the other to\r\nregard it as right; that it really had given the two sides differing\r\nconsciences. If you but invoke the universal history of mankind this fact\r\nnow under consideration will cease to appear marvellous. You will find it\r\nto be the rule that the struggle for existence develops in every community\r\nan instinct which resistlessly prompts to the maintenance of its great\r\neconomic interest. This instinct is the special preserver of the family,\r\nof the neighborhood, of the country. It is not strange that that which\r\ngives sustenance and comfort to one's family, and what he sees all the\r\nbest of his neighbors using as he does, will seem unquestionably right to\r\nhim. It is not strange that, in such a serious conflict of interest as the\r\nintersectional one of dividing a vast empire between such fell\r\ncompetitors as free labor and slave labor, each side will differ\r\ndiametrically in conscience as to right and wrong. Also it is not strange\r\nthat they should lose temper, shower abuse upon their opponents, and fill\r\nthe land with mutual accusations of heinous moral offences.\r\n\r\nIt is just as far wrong to regard the controversy between anti- and\r\npro-slavery men--which was at bottom but a quarrel between north and south\r\nat first over the division of the Territories between the free labor\r\nsystem and the slave labor system, and later over the other question\r\nwhether a slave republic should divide the continent with the United\r\nStates--as a contest over a moral question, as it would be to make either\r\nthe American or the French revolution such a contest. All three--the\r\nintersectional struggle as to slavery and the two revolutions--were mainly\r\nimpelled by a desire of each side in every one to better or hold on to its\r\nmaterial resources--that is, the leading impulsion was economic. Of course\r\nthe combatants on each side claimed that they themselves were right and\r\ntheir adversaries wrong in morals. The rencounter between free labor and\r\nslave labor was very much like that now on between capitalists and labor\r\norganizations. Note how each side denounces the conduct of the other,\r\nalleging it to be against moral justice. The most superficial observer\r\ndiscerns that the real cause of difference between them is not one of\r\nconscience, but one of interest. We ought to understand that the\r\ncrimination of the root-and-branch abolitionist and the recrimination of\r\nthe fire-eater were each but stage thunder. The southern master must be\r\nwholly exonerated from the charge that in working his slave he committed\r\nmoral offence against the dearest American rights; the claim for the\r\nAfrican, who was in a far lower circle of development, of equal civil and\r\npolitical privileges with the white must be disallowed; and it be fully\r\nconceded that the southern people, leaders and all, were but doing their\r\nconscience-commanded duty throughout. Also we of the south must learn that\r\nthe root-and-branch abolitionist, even in his wildest moments--Sumner\r\nrefusing in the United States senate to show respect to Butler's gray\r\nhairs, Wendell Phillips degrading Washington below Toussaint, Garrison\r\ndenouncing the slavery-protecting constitution as a covenant with death\r\nand an agreement with hell, John Brown's raid into Virginia--was just as\r\nconscientious as Robert Lee was when he was defending the soil of his\r\nnative State. They were each irresistibly constrained by the powers\r\nworking to save the union to think his particular action right and the\r\nhighest patriotism.\r\n\r\nWhen the quarrel is over, when the broil and the feud have been fought out\r\nand the survivors have shaken hands, when the lawsuit has become a thing\r\nof the past and the litigants have renewed their old relations, no wise\r\nand good man keeps repeating the accusations of bad faith and of\r\nunrighteous conduct which he passionately hurled against his adversary\r\nduring the variance. Rather he confesses to himself, \"I wronged him when I\r\nsaid those hot words;\" and his repentance does not bring complete peace\r\nuntil he has found his brother and taken all of them back.\r\n\r\nIf it only could be, the nation ought to have a great reunion, a feast of\r\nreconcilement, where, with proper solemnities, the people of each section,\r\nwith their forefathers and leaders, should be fully and finally exculpated\r\nas to everything done for or against slavery by the people of the other\r\nsection. It is plain that both ought to forget and forgive. They ought to\r\ndo still more. They ought to compete each in utmost effort to vindicate\r\nthe favorites and loved ones of the other the more intelligently, and to\r\nadmire and praise them the more enthusiastically. This would be to bring\r\nthe millennium nearer, and give our country \"a nobleness in record upon\"\r\nall others. It only needs for this consummation to cast aside the remnant\r\nof greatly diminished prejudice, and make a brief study of a small volume\r\nof material evidence and of the ordinary principles which guide the\r\nconduct of the good citizen. Such study will show that southerner and\r\nnortherner throughout their fell encounter have each the very highest\r\nclaims to the respect and love of the entire nation.\r\n\r\nWhat a golden deed it was of President McKinley when, December 14, 1898,\r\nfully using a rare opportunity, he spake in his high place to the members\r\nof the Georgia legislature this message of reunion:\r\n\r\n    \"Sectional lines no longer mar the map of the United States. Sectional\r\n    feeling no longer holds back the love we bear each other. Fraternity\r\n    is the national anthem, sung by a chorus of forty-five States and our\r\n    Territories at home and beyond the seas. The union is once more the\r\n    common altar of our love and loyalty, our devotion and sacrifice. The\r\n    old flag again waves over us in peace with new glories, which your\r\n    sons and ours have this year added to its sacred folds. What cause we\r\n    have for rejoicing, saddened only because so many of our brave men\r\n    fell on the field or sickened and died from hardship and exposure, and\r\n    others returning bring wounds and disease from which they will long\r\n    suffer. The memory of the dead will be a precious legacy, and the\r\n    disabled will be the nation's care.\r\n\r\n    Every soldier's grave made during our unfortunate civil war is a\r\n    tribute to American valor. And while when those graves were made we\r\n    differed widely about the nature of this government, these differences\r\n    have been settled by the arbitrament of arms. The time has now come,\r\n    in the evolution of sentiment and feeling, under the providence of\r\n    God, when in the spirit of fraternity we should share with you the\r\n    care of the graves of the confederate soldiers. The cordial feeling\r\n    now happily existing between the north and south prompts this\r\n    gracious act. If it needs further justification, it is found in the\r\n    gallant loyalty to the union and the flag so conspicuously shown in\r\n    the year just passed by the sons and grandsons of these heroic dead.\"\r\n\r\nBy the favor given Fitzhugh Lee, Joe Wheeler, and other old confederates,\r\nand his earnest and successful efforts for universal amnesty to all who\r\nhad helped our cause, Mr. McKinley had already won the hearts of the\r\nsouthern people. This speech increased our love a hundred fold. We\r\nrepeated the \"soft words\" over and over, companioning them with\r\n\r\n  \"O they banish our anger forever\r\n  When they laurel the graves of our dead.\"\r\n\r\nOn each one of our three subsequent Memorial Days during his life he was\r\nthought of as tenderly as the precious dead. And since the death of\r\nJefferson Davis there has been no sorrow of the south equal to that over\r\nhis assassination. This is the age of funerals that crown with supreme\r\npopular honor the doers of high deeds for country and race. The imposing\r\nobsequies given the president, the demonstrations in his own section, and\r\nthose in foreign lands, have rarely been outdone. But he had a greater\r\nglory. It was the genuine lamentation over him that day by reconciled\r\nbrothers and sisters in every southern household. You that know history\r\nbetter, tell me when and where a whiter and sweeter flower was ever laid\r\nupon a coffin.\r\n\r\nLet all of us on each side of the old dividing line strive without ceasing\r\nto give the good work which the great peacemaker begun so well its fit\r\nconsummation.\r\n\r\nAnd replacing hate and anger with love, fiction with fact, and false\r\ndoctrine with true, let the people of the north and the people of the\r\nsouth join heads, consciences, and hearts to ascertain what is our duty\r\nboth to negro and white, and then join hands and do that duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE RACE QUESTION--GENERAL AND INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Dense fogs from various sources have settled over this subject. The\r\nroot-and-branch abolitionists have made many believe that emancipation of\r\nthe slaves was the great object of the north in the brothers' war. The\r\nauthors and defenders of the three amendments--especially of the\r\nfifteenth--have made many others believe that the inferiority of the\r\nsouthern negro is the effect of American slavery; that the cause having\r\nbeen removed by emancipation he became at once ready and well prepared for\r\nthe exercise of political privileges; and that the practical denial to him\r\nof this exercise is a heinous crime of the southern whites. Politicians\r\nwant southern negro ballots in national conventions and the northern negro\r\nvote in elections. The bounty, both public and private, founding,\r\nsustaining, and multiplying colleges, schools, and other negro educational\r\ninstitutions, finds a growing host of beneficiaries--such as site-owners,\r\nwho scheme to sell for two prices, those who want to be presidents,\r\nprincipals, professors, teachers, even janitors and floor-scrubbers,\r\nschoolbook publishers, and still others--who would keep it copiously\r\nflowing; and so they all magnify the ability of the typical negro and the\r\nbenefit to him of the institutions mentioned. Respectable and influential\r\nmagazines and newspapers, with an increasing number of negro readers,\r\nreally believe that very many more can be added by a little effort, and so\r\nthey champion what these readers favor. Persuasive speakers and writers\r\nlike Mr. Edgar Gardner Murphy, unconsciously influenced either by\r\nemployers who would always have a wage-depressing lever at command, or by\r\nthose who would have Cuffee do what they ought themselves to do, overrate\r\nthe importance of negro labor as a southern resource. And the last fog\r\nmakers whom I shall mention are the inveterate optimists--amiable beyond\r\nexpression--who will not admit that there is now any serious menace to\r\neither race in the south.\r\n\r\nThe several fogs enumerated overlay one another in an aggregate too opaque\r\nfor the uncleared eye to pierce. As examples of their obscuring effect,\r\nconsider anything said in the census as to the negro, and the articles\r\n\"Negro Education,\" \"Negro in America,\" and especially \"Hayti\" in the\r\nEncyclopedia Americana lately published. The authors of the fifteenth\r\namendment, in making voters and rulers of late negro slaves, repeated what\r\nhad been done in Hayti. It seems therefore that the Encyclopedia must tell\r\nnothing of the island but what is good. So we read in the relevant article\r\nthat it abolished slavery in 1804, being \"the first country to rid\r\nhumanity of such a sad practice;\" that there education \"is compulsory and\r\ngratuitous,\" a sixth of the revenues being devoted to it, and the most\r\npleasant things concerning religion, liberal naturalization practice,\r\nnatural and artificial products, railroads, telegraph, and telephone. One\r\nwithout other information would surely think the community greatly\r\nadvanced and blessed. Its true condition is thus told in Brockhaus by\r\nsomebody who does not swear by the fifteenth amendment: \"It may be said in\r\ngeneral that the country is sparsely populated, partly because of\r\nincessant civil wars, partly because of a high infant death rate.\"[147]\r\n\r\nThese fogs must be lifted. Great harm to each race will follow if we\r\npersist in keeping the facts concealed.\r\n\r\n2. Do not confound the feeling that you are different from Jew, European,\r\nprotestant, catholic, absolutist, socialist, anarchist, or any other\r\nwhite, with the feeling that you are different from negroes; for to do\r\nthis is to keep you from all clear thinking upon our present subject. The\r\nformer are all of our own race, and we can and do intermarry with them to\r\nthe improvement of our population. If the per cent of negroes was no\r\ngreater in the south than in the north, fusion could not be a very grave\r\nmatter; for should it become complete, our lily-white would not be\r\ndiminished by the fraction of a shade. But to absorb the eight millions of\r\nthem now in our section would make us chocolate, if not mulatto. Their\r\ncolor is the smallest racial objection. Although their schooling for two\r\ncenturies and more in American slavery has elevated them--as Mr.\r\nTillinghast proves--far above what they were in native slavery, still\r\ntheir cranial capacity, brain convolutions, and moral, intellectual, and\r\nsocial development--inherited without fault of theirs--from West African\r\nancestors, are still greatly inferior to ours. Remote generations of our\r\nforefathers were much lower than the present American negroes, as Darwin\r\nadmits in the oft quoted passage, describing his first sight of the\r\nFuegians. We should never forget that the Caucasian was once on a level\r\nwith those Fuegians. The negroes when they came to America were little\r\nbetter. And yet they have gone up so much higher, it is plain that\r\nevolution, if only permitted to work in a proper environment, will do for\r\nthem what it has done for us.\r\n\r\nBut the whites cannot consent to intermarriage. That would greatly benefit\r\nthe negroes. While some who have never had good opportunity of actual\r\nobservation confidently contend that there are no backward or lower\r\nraces, we southerners have noted all our lives that a very great majority\r\nof the negroes who climb above the level and prosper in occupation, have a\r\nlarge admixture of white blood. It would be an enormous rise for the mass\r\nif fusion were assured. But for us--why, we should disinherit our children\r\nof their share in the grand destiny of the Caucasian race if we made\r\naverage negroes their fathers or mothers.\r\n\r\nSouthern dread of amalgamation is not to be scouted as a mere bugbear.\r\nThink of the half-breeds that lined all the border between the States and\r\nthe Indians; of how the whites have mixed with native races in Mexico,\r\nCentral and South America; of white and negro intermingling in Cuba,\r\nHayti, Jamaica, in the United States, and especially in the south. Think\r\nof whites and negroes now legally married and marrying in the neighboring\r\nStates of the Union. In 1902, eight white women were living with negro\r\nhusbands in Xenia, Ohio;[148] and there were children of all these mixed\r\nmarriages except one.[149] Consider also that prominent negroes advocate\r\nthese marriages. Douglass had a white wife. He preached that the American\r\nnegro must set before himself assimilation as his true goal. Professor\r\nDuBois is really a disciple of Douglass, as appears from some of his\r\nutterances. We give in a footnote what another prominent negro has\r\nrecently said in public.[150] The moment that the negro became an\r\ninfluential factor in southern politics, a real agitation against the\r\nanti-intermarriage laws would begin. There would come a small number of\r\nnegroes, controlling votes, of so much property and respectability that\r\ntheir children would be regarded as eligible matches by some of the poorer\r\nand more destitute whites. Marriages between such, solemnized on a visit\r\nto a State permitting, would occur. And our laws last mentioned would be\r\nmore and more evaded and their repeal become gradually more probable. When\r\nthey had won political equality with the patricians, the Roman plebeians\r\nrepealed the prohibition of intermarriage which the former had stubbornly\r\nmaintained. These two orders were of the same race. Therefore\r\nintermarriage could not be the boon to the plebeians that it would now be\r\nto the southern negro, lifting him up as it would do. If he has\r\nopportunity, he will struggle for it more resolutely than the plebeians\r\ndid. A small number of negroes have already been assimilated in America,\r\nand a few more are still to be assimilated, as I shall explain later on.\r\nThis sure deliverance from the destruction which now threatens is more and\r\nmore sought after by the intelligent few. And if the vote of the negroes\r\nwas allowed to count, it would not be long until, under the example and\r\nappeal of their leaders, all of them would be making for that haven of\r\nrefuge. Mongrelism beats upon the border all around the south; it\r\nthreatens to burst forth from an exhaustless source within. We know we\r\nmust keep it out as Holland does the ocean. Subconsciously discerning that\r\nfusion would probably follow the entrance of the negro into government,\r\nthe whites have made of the race primary and other measures _de facto_\r\ndisfranchising him, dikes against the filthy waters of mongrelism which\r\nthey would not have to wash over themselves. This is not because we hate\r\nthe negro. We love and cherish him. It is not to be demanded of us that we\r\nsacrifice ourselves, our children, and our children's children for his\r\nsake. We will gladly do all that friends--nay, that near relatives--can\r\nwith justice ask of one another, to better his condition and rescue him.\r\nWe cannot give him political power at the cost of our degeneration.\r\n\r\nI would enforce the foregoing contents of this section with these\r\nprofoundly true and very forcible words of a northern man, now residing in\r\nColumbia, South Carolina:\r\n\r\n    \"A word about race hatred, race revulsion, or race antipathy. Many\r\n    people in the north believe the devil is the author of it, and some\r\n    people in the south are more devoted to it than to religion. Race\r\n    antipathy is really a race instinct, a moral anti-toxin developed by\r\n    nature in the individual whose environment involves constant and close\r\n    contact with an inferior race in large numbers. It works for the\r\n    salvation of the purity of the superior race.\"[151]\r\n\r\nProfessor DuBois says that \"legal marriage is infinitely better than\r\nsystematic concubinage and prostitution.\"[152] And some writers seem to\r\nthink it would be well to coerce miscegenators to legitimate their\r\nrelations by intermarrying. An innocent girl--a maid--undone; all good men\r\nand women are agreed that her seducer should be made to marry her.[153]\r\nBut that is only where the marriage would be tolerated by society. Thus it\r\nwould not make man and wife of parties to an incestuous liaison. No\r\nmoralist contends that one who has received a favor from a public woman is\r\nunder obligation to become her husband. The miscegenation common is that\r\nbetween white men and promiscuous black women. How idle is the attempt to\r\nput these cases on a par with that of the ruin of a virtuous woman. And\r\nProfessor DuBois could not have rightly weighed the words in which he\r\nrepresents them to be as criminal as those horrible offences which\r\nespecially provoke lynching; that is, that the negro woman who consented\r\nmost willingly to the embraces of her master was as foully wronged by him\r\nas her mistress would be by a slave who outraged her against her\r\nwill.[154] No. Intermarriage of these mixed lovers is not demanded by any\r\nprinciple of justice. But the public weal does demand that such a\r\ntremendous evil as amalgamation be kept off by the surest and most\r\ndecisive measures. It is playing with plague and curse unspeakable for us\r\nof the south to permit the existence of any condition which tends even in\r\nthe slightest degree to legalize intermarriage.[155]\r\n\r\n3. Writers still under the spell of the root-and-branch abolitionists who\r\nwere wont to exalt Toussaint, the Haytian general, above our Washington,\r\nstrain hard to conceal the real cause of the lamentable conditions now\r\nprevailing in Hayti and San Domingo. One tells us that because of the many\r\nmountains, there being no railroad system, separate communities are\r\ndefended by almost impregnable natural barriers, and as neighboring\r\npeoples are hereditary enemies, there is always war somewhere. The remedy\r\nrecommended is to build railroads in the island as the English have done\r\nin Jamaica. Another writer tells us that we must not jump to the\r\nconclusion that all the inhabitants of San Domingo are degraded negroes;\r\nthat while the population of the interior are sunk in ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, and barbarism, yet in the capital and the coast towns there\r\nare some people of apparently lily-white strain, well educated, speaking\r\ntwo or three languages, who supply the mulatto republic with generals and\r\npolitical leaders. The masses of these Dominicans are very patriotic, and\r\nwould indeed do finely if they were not divided into hostile parties by\r\nself-seeking agitators. And you may consult many others who keep back the\r\nreal explanation. There is one cardinal fact which stands forth in the\r\nhistory of Hayti as prominently as slavery does in the train of American\r\nevents which brought on the brothers' war. It is this: soon after the\r\noutbreak of the French revolution the mulattoes were accorded political\r\nprivileges, and then a little later--it was in 1794--France equalized the\r\nnegroes of her colonies just freed with the whites in political and civil\r\nrights. This made the negroes of Hayti, who were in intelligence and\r\ndevelopment somewhat below those of the south when the latter were\r\nemancipated, full-fledged self-governing republicans. The whites were but\r\nfew. What of them were not massacred at once by the blacks fled for their\r\nlives. The history of both the Haytian and the Dominican republic (the\r\nlatter achieving its independence in 1844) is the same. Their people make\r\na hell on earth of the most beautiful and fertile of islands. As slavery\r\nwas plainly the cause of the southern confederacy, the grant of political\r\npower to the mulattoes and negroes not at all qualified to use it is just\r\nas plainly the cause and sole author of chronic civil war and anarchy in\r\nHayti and San Domingo.\r\n\r\nThis enfranchisement of semi-barbarians was from the 'prentice hand of a\r\nnew republic, without any experience in free institutions. The English did\r\nfar better when they emancipated the Jamaica negro by the act of 1833.\r\nThey gave him full protection of his liberty, person, and contract and\r\nproperty rights. Five sixths of the 800,000 of its present population are\r\ncolored people or blacks. These--to quote the Encyclopedia\r\nAmericana--\"have no share in the government whatever.\" It further says:\r\n\"The Jamaica negroes are fairly good laborers when well fed; the menial\r\nwork of the island is performed by them, and they are regarded as\r\ncheerful, honest, and respectful servants.\"\r\n\r\nThis happy condition of quiet and content is not due to the fact that the\r\nrailroads prevent settlement of the negroes in separate neighboring\r\ncommunities to quarrel and fight with one another; but it is because the\r\nEnglish never allowed them to get the taste of blood as the French\r\npermitted to their brothers in Hayti; they have not been incited by\r\nunseasonable political power to license and riot.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Jamaica are evidently bettering in condition slowly. They\r\nneed only enough of Booker Washingtons to rise much faster. I beg\r\nattention to this comparison of Jamaica and Hayti, made by a well-informed\r\nnegro, a native of the former, who lived there until some nine years ago,\r\nand who has lately lived several years in Hayti:[156]\r\n\r\n    \"They [the negroes of Jamaica] aim at rising, but many make the\r\n    mistake of not rising, _in_ but _out_ of labor: the most intelligent\r\n    flock to the professions, civil service, &c. Few turn their steps to\r\n    what is for the real upbuilding of the country, agriculture, that for\r\n    which it is best adapted.\r\n\r\n    \"The people of Hayti and San Domingo are of a political turn of mind,\r\n    and sacrifice everything for politics, or are made to do so. That\r\n    island produces as fine coffee and cocoa as can be found anywhere, but\r\n    the most intelligent keep out and deprive these crops of scientific\r\n    cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Hayti and San Domingo spurred by their politics into\r\nperpetual fighting and bloodshed; the negroes of Jamaica peaceful and ripe\r\nfor industrial training, which it seems the English have resolved to give\r\nthem--if Booker Washington had to choose one of the two islands for his\r\nfuture activity, do you not know that he would decide he could do great\r\nthings in Jamaica and nothing in the other?\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth amendment emancipated the slaves instantly and not\r\ngradually, the fourteenth made them complete citizens of the United States\r\nand of the particular State wherein they reside, and the fifteenth\r\npractically conferred unlimited suffrage upon them. The Hayti, and not the\r\nJamaica, precedent was followed. The brothers that had conquered were\r\nblind from civil fury: and they had been brought by the root-and-branch\r\nabolitionists into full persuasion that the southern negroes were ready\r\nfor and entitled to these high privileges. By the amendments they\r\nconfidently tried to railroad the African slave in one instant of time up\r\nthe long steep to the topmost Caucasian who had established liberty and\r\nself-government over a continent, and made it perpetual. We pray that they\r\nbe forgiven, for they knew not what they were doing. Had the white\r\npopulation of the south been at the time as disproportionate to the black\r\nas it was in Hayti in 1794, it would also have been massacred. But the\r\nsection was full of late confederate soldiers. When the fates had decided\r\nagainst the dear cause for which they had fought for four years they\r\naccepted peace in good faith. Now their conquerors turned loose a horde of\r\nblack plunderers to despoil the little that war had left. When I read\r\nProfessor Brown's inability to say whether the work of the Ku-Klux was\r\njustifiable or not,[157] I thought of Christ's asking if it was right to\r\ndo good on the sabbath day.\r\n\r\nThe lesson to be learned here is that while it is now too late to make the\r\nthirteenth amendment what it ought to have been, and there is perhaps no\r\nneed to alter the fourteenth, yet there must be abrogation of the\r\nfifteenth as to the great mass of southern negroes. In fact this has\r\nreally come already through the white primary. Booker Washington is a\r\ngreat, a decisive authority on this question. He counsels the negroes to\r\neschew politics. This is wise. It is the solid interest of the negro\r\nmasses that they accept the inevitable; just as the south gave up slavery\r\nwhen we could hold on to it no longer.\r\n\r\n4. The southern negroes have split into what I shall roughly distinguish\r\nas an upper and a lower class. The former includes property owners and\r\nsuch as are in higher occupations, trades, and professions. I do not\r\nbelieve that the entire class contains three per cent, but I shall take it\r\nto be five per cent of the whole negroes in the section. Exact accuracy\r\nhere is not important. It needs only to be remembered that the lower class\r\noutnumbers the other many times over. They are moving in different\r\ndirections. The dominant inclination of the upper class is towards\r\nincorporation as citizens, exercising all the rights of the white. The\r\ndominant inclination of the lower class is towards segregation in their\r\nown circles. A true representative of the former would always travel in a\r\nwhite railroad car, while a true representative of the other is perfectly\r\ncontent with the shabbiest Jim Crow, if the whites be kept out of it.\r\nThousands in the south never think of any negroes but those of the lower,\r\nthousands in the north never think of any but those in the upper class.\r\nThe lower class subsists mainly upon agricultural, domestic, and day\r\nlabor. There is a rural and urban section of each one of the two. The\r\nrural section of the upper class has little promise of permanence and\r\ngrowth, but its urban section seems to have securer foothold. For a while\r\nthis urban section will probably increase and rise in condition--both\r\nslowly. This upper class is now steadily sending some of its members from\r\ncountry and town, to settle in the north. As I read the signs its destiny\r\nis ultimate dispersion over the entire country and gradual disappearance.\r\nThe lower class settles downwards steadily. The outlook for it is gloomy\r\nin the extreme.\r\n\r\n5. Somewhere about 1890--which year we may regard as approximately\r\nbeginning the manufacturing era of the South--many whites in the section\r\nhad broken with the old ways and methods and resolved to substitute their\r\nown for negro labor as far as possible. These awakened men and women\r\nmultiply. They are pushing the lower class out of all rural labor, and\r\nboth classes out of agriculture; and they are also pushing some of the\r\nupper class out of the trades and more important occupations in both town\r\nand country. Evidently the powers have decreed that the labor class of the\r\nsouth shall be white and homogeneous with that of the north. These powers\r\nwho delivered the white laborers of the west from the Chinese will also\r\ndeliver the white laborers of the south from the negroes.\r\n\r\n6. There is soon to be a New Industrial South, in which the most advanced\r\nmachinery and laborers of the very highest skill are to be chief factors.\r\nA little later there is to be a still more important New Agricultural\r\nSouth. In this, the empirical restorative methods of the Chinese, which\r\nLiebig, in his day, showed to be ahead of the world, must be far\r\nsurpassed. Economy of the enormous mass of fertile elements now washing\r\ninto the sea; adequate exploitation of the nitrogen of the air and of all\r\naccessible mineral elements needed; scientific dairy industry, stock\r\nrearing, fruit culture, and all related branches; farmers of the most\r\nefficient training, and laborers whose deft hands are the proper\r\ninstruments of the strongest brains--all these must combine to give the\r\nsouth that perfect intensive culture which she will add to her blessings\r\nof climate and soil in order to supply the fast growing demand of all the\r\nworld outside for her especial products. Further, as everything now seems\r\nto indicate, the southern yield of the more important minerals and metals\r\nwill lead that of the entire country. Further again, the bulk of\r\ntranscontinental railroad traffic must be across the south on snow-free\r\nroutes, and the upbuilding which in time will follow from this is as yet\r\nincalculable. And when the inter-ocean canal connects us with the Pacific\r\ntrade--what new impetus will this give to our development! What needs and\r\nopportunities there will then be for skilled labor, for inventive talent,\r\nfor managerial ability, for every element of a most highly organized\r\ncommunity of unwontedly many diversified prospecting interests. The demand\r\nwill be for a vast population of the very best strain and breed, knowing\r\nthe best methods of physical, moral, and self-subsisting education of\r\ntheir children, out of whom will come the best of all workers and\r\nproducers. To attempt to do the required tasks of the new south of the\r\nnear future and hold our own against the competition of the world--to try\r\nto do these with negro laborers, negro farmers, negro producers, negro\r\nemployers, would be like substituting the ox-wagon for the present\r\nrailroad freight train. Nay, it would be more like one with a wooden leg,\r\nand a millstone around his neck, offering to run against a trained racer.\r\nThe negro laborer, farmer, manufacturer, and contractor show more clearly\r\nevery day that they are hopelessly outclassed in the struggle with white\r\ncompetitors. As a body where they now are they are becoming useless and an\r\nincubus. They will soon be still more in the way, and a more serious\r\nhindrance to southern development. They keep back the immigration which is\r\nespecially called for. That is the immigration of northern and European\r\nfarmers, producers, and manufacturers of all kinds to teach us their\r\nadvanced methods, and the most skilled labor in every department to\r\nstimulate with example our native white labor to its highest\r\naccomplishment. The northern people would come south very largely if there\r\nwere no negroes here. Their desire to come increases steadily, and so does\r\nour desire to have them come. The whites of both sections naturally\r\nco-operate more and more earnestly to effect their joint wishes. The\r\ndisinclination of the United States supreme court to overturn the recent\r\nanti-negro amendments of the constitutions of southern States, and the\r\npalpably growing favor showed these amendments at the north are very\r\nsignificant signs that the south is to be made more to the liking of\r\nnorthern settlers.\r\n\r\nSince the last sentence was written that court has ruled it to be a crime,\r\npunishable severely, to hold one to the performance of a contract to pay\r\nhis debt by laboring for you.[158] The average negro has no resource but\r\ncredit on the faith of such a contract. So soon as it becomes generally\r\nknown that he cannot be lawfully held to its performance, the credit will\r\nbe denied. As has been suggested to me by an observant and far-seeing man,\r\nthe decision overturns the main pillar of the negro's subsistence. It will\r\npowerfully favor northern immigration, as well as the substitution of\r\nwhite for black labor--that is, if it is vigorously enforced.\r\n\r\n7. I believe that the two races together, in the same community as they\r\nare now in the south, are oil and water. Meditate the course and portent\r\nof these facts. Immediately upon emancipation the negroes set up their own\r\nchurches and schools; they manifested approval of the separate passenger\r\ncar for themselves, politely hinting in season that the whites ought to be\r\nkept out of it; and they influenced the planter to remove their cabins out\r\nof sight and hearing of the Big House. They showed a great\r\ndisinclination, the men to do agricultural work by the year for standing\r\nwages, the women to hire as house servants. It was some while before the\r\nwhites really recognized this drift of the negro towards segregation, when\r\nmany of them--especially the wives and mothers--gave the rein to much\r\nunreasonable resentment. Now, if you but know how to look, you will find\r\neverywhere the proofs of deepening antagonism. The black driver will not\r\nsee even a white lady--not to mention a man--on the crossing, but he will\r\nalways see a negro of either sex. The face of the white inconveniently\r\nstepping aside flushes with momentary anger. If your colored servant tells\r\nyou there is a lady at the door you may know it is a negro woman; he never\r\ncalls a \"white 'oman\" a lady. A negro woman is prone to make the most\r\nprominent white lady give the street. In Atlanta, a negro man or a white\r\nboy cannot safely go at night the former through the factory white\r\nsettlement, the latter through Summer Hill, a negro residence quarter. I\r\nhave been informed that where the mill operatives of Anderson, South\r\nCarolina, have their cottages, there is conspicuously posted, \"Nigger,\r\ndon't let the sun go down on you here.\" I hear that the same is true of\r\ncertain places in the Texas Panhandle; also that a negro settlement in the\r\nIndian territory displays a similar warning to the white man.[159] Parties\r\nof black and white children meeting on unfrequented streets of Atlanta\r\nnearly always exchange opprobrious language, often throw stones at one\r\nanother, and sometimes fight--a proof so significant that, whenever I see\r\nit, it always makes me serious. The most decided change from old times\r\nthat I note is that white society everywhere proscribes mixed sexual\r\nintercourse and the procreation of mulattoes with rapidly increasing\r\nseverity. The advocate of mixed marriages is more and more regarded as a\r\nfiend. The white woman seized by a negro man--how gladly would she change\r\nplace with the victim of the torturing savage or of the tiger that would\r\nmangle and eat her alive! This menace is everywhere, and naturally it is\r\nmagnified by excited imagination. It increases in fact. The trial of\r\nnegroes for capital offences was given the superior court of Georgia in\r\n1850. From then until the end of the brothers' war but two cases of rape\r\nof white women by negroes are in the supreme court reports;[160] and I\r\nnever heard of but two other cases occurring in that time. But there have\r\nbeen many since. It steadily becomes more frequent. Women more and more\r\ndread to be left alone. And now there is hardly a man in the Black Belt\r\nwho, when he is to be a night away from wife, daughters, mother, and\r\nsisters, without help at call, does not have uncomfortable thoughts of the\r\nsooty desecrator. The increasing effect of these multiplying outrages and\r\nthe increasing horror which they cause is proved by a fact which ought to\r\nreceive more intelligent recognition from everybody. This fact is that\r\nlynching of a negro for rape, and lately for other crimes of violence\r\nagainst whites, whether in the south or in the north, seems to be every\r\ntime marked with a greater outburst of popular fury. The public grows more\r\ndecidedly anti-negro. They give as little heed to the appeals of the\r\npapers in these matters as they do to the editorials always advocating the\r\nprojects of the machine and corporations. The mob sweeps aside the\r\nmilitary. The military will not load its rifles. If they were loaded it\r\nwould probably refuse to fire, or would fire into the air. A few exclaim\r\nagainst lawlessness, while it is plain that the great mass of the whites\r\ndo not really condemn in their hearts.\r\n\r\nLet us try to understand the real cause of these things. The plainest\r\nparallel that occurs to me is the riots and violence excited by attempts\r\nto execute the fugitive slave law. The greatest of our southern statesmen\r\nmisunderstood. What they thought to be lawlessness was in fact the\r\nstruggle of nature by which the social organism of the United States\r\nexpelled all cause of dissolution. These hostile demonstrations of the day\r\nagainst negroes are, as they seem to me, far other than acts of\r\nunenlightened and ignorant race prejudice, to which some writers ascribe\r\nthem. They indicate, I think, another struggle of nature to expel a\r\nforeign and death-breeding substance out of the American body politic;\r\nthey are each the protest of the self-preserving instincts against keeping\r\nthe negro with us to counteract our progress, to debase our politics, to\r\ncorrupt our blood, to injure us more than even successful secession could\r\nhave done. How aptly has Matthew Arnold said, \"O man, how true are thine\r\ninstincts, how overhasty thine interpretation of them!\"\r\n\r\n8. Plainly the disparity of the negro in the deadly struggle with the\r\nwhite over every resource of subsistence fast becomes greater; plainly\r\ndoes his stay in the south more and more injure both sections; plainly\r\nunder the effects of hard life, growing idleness and growing crime,\r\nincreasing ravages of disease, and the naturally engendered feeling of\r\nhelplessness, the average negro in the lower class gravitates downwards;\r\nplainly this negro ought to have, in a sphere of his own, opportunity and\r\nstimulus for self-recovery and progress. Plainly whites and negroes ought\r\nto be separated. The latter seriously clog the evolution of the desired\r\nsouthern labor class, and the southern whites completely exclude the\r\nnegroes from public life. The two are really each different communities in\r\njuxtaposition, but not united. You may think of them as plants, one of\r\nwhich has a diseased root, and the other has its top kept in the dark and\r\nout of the sun. Both these evils result unavoidably from keeping the two\r\nraces together. So let us give the negro his own State in our union. That\r\nwill allow the root of the one plant to get well, and it will give the top\r\nof the other permanently to the sun.\r\n\r\nWe are rich enough and have land enough to give the negro this State,\r\nwhich is his due from us. His especial need is to exercise political and\r\ncivil privileges, in his own community, all the way up from town meeting\r\nto congress.\r\n\r\nIf something like this is not done it is extremely probable that the great\r\nmass of the lower class of the negroes will die out. Let not this crime be\r\ncommitted by the American nation.\r\n\r\n9. We should be extremely liberal to the negro in education--in primary,\r\nin industrial, and also in the higher. Especially ought we to combine the\r\nsecond with the first, and give it the lead for both races.\r\n\r\n10. All the southern states should at once by proper constitutional and\r\nlegal provisions substitute judicial for mob lynching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE RACE QUESTION--THE SITUATION IN DETAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the two classes of southern negroes, glanced at in\r\nthe last chapter, is to be always kept in mind--at the beginning, in the\r\nmiddle, and at the end, of our discussion. Its importance commands that we\r\nsay something of it here. Consider how enormously the two differ in\r\nnumbers. Five per cent of these negroes, that is, some four hundred\r\nthousand, in the upper; ninety-five per cent, that is, seven million and\r\nfour hundred thousand, in the lower class. The latter, being nineteen\r\ntimes as large as the other, first demands attention.\r\n\r\nIn the country many of the men are croppers. A group of negroes--generally\r\nparents and children--do the labor of preparation, cultivation, and\r\ngathering, while the owner contributes the land, necessary animals, and\r\nfeed for the latter. The croppers get half the crop, and the land owner\r\nhalf. The latter retains out of their half whatever he has advanced the\r\ncroppers. The advances must be limited with firmness, otherwise they will\r\ncause loss. These croppers are the great bulk of the agricultural\r\nlaborers. So few of the men work for standing wages that they need not be\r\nnoticed. In the towns the men subsist upon day labor, the pay of which\r\nranges from 50 cents to $1.25. It hardly averages 80 cents. Some of the\r\nwomen, both in country and town, take places as house servants and nurses\r\nat weekly wages that vary from $1 to $2 with board. The growing\r\ndisinclination of the women to these places is much stronger in the\r\ncountry than in town. In country and town the women do laundry for the\r\nwhites at an average price per family of a dollar a week; and they get\r\njobs of sewing, cleaning kitchen utensils, scrubbing, etc. In the country\r\nthese women do some field labor, sometimes plowing, often hoeing. If\r\ntrained in childhood they make expert cotton-pickers. But the women\r\nagricultural workers steadily decrease in number.\r\n\r\nThe negro has inherited from a thousand generations of forefathers, bred\r\nin the humid and enervating tropical West African climate, a laziness\r\nwhich is the extreme contrary of Caucasian energy and enterprise.[161]\r\nThus we are told of him in Jamaica, \"In many cases a field negro will not\r\nwork for his employer more than four days a week. He may till his own plot\r\nof ground on one of the other days or not as the spirit moves him.\"[162]\r\nThe first Saturday in June, 1904, I saw the thriving little town of\r\nAbbeville, South Carolina, thronged with idle negroes from the surrounding\r\nplantations. A merchant, who was kept busy in his store, offered to pay\r\nseveral of them 75 cents to cut up a load of firewood--something more than\r\nthe market price. They do not work on Saturday unless compelled by\r\nsomething unusual; and so each one replied at once, without any inquiry if\r\nthe logs were large or small, seasoned or not, and thus finding whether\r\nthe job was hard or easy, that the weather was too hot. And yet these\r\nnegroes all exhibited in their clothes and hungry looks unmistakable signs\r\nof want. Those that superintend the gangs working for contractors in\r\nAtlanta and the vicinity, all--except now and then one who has managed to\r\nform a small party of picked laborers--tell me that it is very seldom that\r\na negro can be induced to work Saturday; if that does happen he will make\r\nup his lost holiday by not returning to work before Tuesday. Your cook,\r\nnurse, maid, or black servant of any kind will every now and then suddenly\r\ninconvenience you by taking an utterly unnecessary rest. When Booker\r\nWashington was starting his system of industrial training, as he tells us,\r\n\"Not a few of the fathers and mothers urged that because the race had\r\nworked for 250 years or more, it ought to have a chance to rest.\"[163]\r\n\r\nThe negro has likewise inherited lack of forecast and providence. If at\r\nthe end of the year he finds himself with a small purse from his part of\r\nthe crop, standing wages, or profits from a tenancy, he will often\r\nsquander much of it for a top buggy, a piano which none of his family can\r\nplay, or expensive furniture. Those in the gangs just mentioned always\r\nwant to fool away their money before it is made. If one has been advanced\r\n$4, and his wages amount to $5, he will hardly ever abridge his holiday by\r\nturning up to get the dollar balance when the others who have not been\r\nadvanced are paid Saturday night. He will waste his cash on watermelons\r\nand fish that an average white will not even smell. When forced down to it\r\nhe can live contentedly upon almost nothing. A very large proportion of\r\nboth sexes are happy upon a real meal every two or three days, and a sly\r\nchange of mate every two or three weeks. Toombs, who was always looking at\r\nCuffee, pronounced him \"rich in the fewness of his wants.\" Bring him out\r\nmore clearly to yourselves by comparison with an Irishman struggling up\r\nfrom starvation wages of hard daily work into comfort and ease. Reflect\r\nover the only success a cotton mill has had with black labor, which was\r\ndue to whipping the operatives for breach of duty.[164]\r\n\r\nIn Atlanta--which of course is but like other southern cities in the\r\nparticular now to be mentioned--many of the men live upon their women. It\r\nis a common saying that you cannot keep a colored cook if you do not allow\r\nher to carry the keys. There is great complaint that the colored\r\nwasherwomen help their dependents out of the clothes. The criminal class\r\nof negro men, women, and children is large and growing much faster than\r\nthat of the whites. Two very striking developments are the negro burglar\r\nand the negro footpad. There are many breakings and entries every year in\r\nAtlanta, many holdups of pedestrians, and nearly all of them are by\r\nnegroes. Now and then a negro snatches a lady's purse from her on the\r\nstreet. The prisoners sent to the Atlanta stockade during the twelve\r\nmonths beginning December 15, 1902, were\r\n\r\n            Colored.      Whites.\r\n  Men         2325          1030\r\n  Women       1168           100\r\n  Boys         471            18\r\n              ----          ----\r\n              3964          1148\r\n\r\nAccording to the twelfth census, the negro population of Atlanta was\r\n35,727, and the white 54,090. So, while there are in every thousand of the\r\nwhites 21 of these criminals, there are in every thousand of the blacks\r\n110. But the case is worse still. About an equal number of convicts\r\nescaped the stockade by paying fines. Allowance for this will much\r\nincrease the per cent of negro criminals. I wish I could get the\r\napproximate number whose fines are paid by their employers, white friends,\r\nmothers, wives, and other relatives. I have observed facts which make me\r\nconfident that it is large. The number of boys that in one year were sent\r\nto the stockade--471--is a most important fact, showing as it does that a\r\nlarge per cent of negroes become criminals in childhood. Nearly all of\r\nthese boys have been abandoned by their fathers. There are just as many\r\nabandoned girls in the city. Of course under the prevailing conditions the\r\nproportion of criminals in each generation must increase portentously.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the negroes' debasement is shown in the impurity of the\r\nwomen. This is another inheritance from their ancestors. The \"ancient\r\nAfrican chastity\" alleged by Professor DuBois,[165] if it ever existed,\r\nwas entirely prehistoric. A white who has not been bred in close contact\r\nwith the race is quite unable to understand the degree and universality of\r\nthis impurity. I will illustrate by a case which occurred in a prosperous\r\ntown of Middle Georgia not very long before I settled in Atlanta. A\r\nprominent negro preacher had been caught in adultery. The woman, who was\r\nthe mother of several children, and her husband, were both members of the\r\nsame church as the preacher, and of unctuous piety. The detection was so\r\ncomplete and certain, and it had immediately become so notorious that\r\nchurch notice was unavoidable. The problem was how to whitewash the\r\naffair. The office of a lawyer friend of mine in the town last mentioned\r\nwas waited on by a member of the church--a say-nothing sort of negro, who\r\nalways applied for leave to attend the meetings at which the preacher was\r\nbeing tried. This office boy had returned several times with the news,\r\nwhen inquired of, that nothing had been done. At last, one day he answered\r\nthat they had cleared the preacher. My friend commanded that this be\r\nexplained. The darkie said, in his laconic way, \"Well, he 'fessed de act,\r\nbut he 'scused de act.\" \"How in the world did he excuse it?\" was asked.\r\n\"He said his heart wasn't in it.\" \"Were you fools enough to believe\r\nthat?\" was ejaculated. The negro, with an air as superior as was\r\ncompatible with the great politeness of his race, replied, \"He said it was\r\nde debble dat had his body dar; but all de time his soul was at de throne,\r\npraying for God's people. In course we couldn't blame him for what de\r\ndebble done.\"\r\n\r\nThis defence, suggesting the make-believe loan of his body by the friar in\r\nthe Decameron to the angel Gabriel, which, of course, had never been heard\r\nof by the accused, convinced the church, willing to be convinced. It\r\nappeased the injured husband, willing to be appeased. It fully vindicated\r\nthe gay clergyman and the erring sister, who were in effect told to go and\r\nsin no more with such little discretion.\r\n\r\nHad this case, or another like it, occurred at that time or since in any\r\nother negro church of that region, there would have been acquittal and\r\njustification of the accused, although perhaps the good plea and the right\r\npsychological moment to make it might not have been so aptly found.[166]\r\n\r\nThe habits and customs of the race mix men and women always and\r\neverywhere; and in those opportunities each one of the young and the old,\r\nmarried and unmarried of both sexes--of even children just arrived at\r\npuberty--chases a short-lived amour with ever eager zest.[167] The blacker\r\nthe Lothario the more show of white blood he seeks in his fancies. Now\r\nand then furious desire for real white overmasters him. Surprising some\r\nunattended angel of a girl or matron, he chooses to see Rome and then die.\r\nHer avengers pour kerosene on him and burn him to a crisp. His lusty\r\nfellows think to themselves what Hermes, in the song of Demodocus, says to\r\nApollo of the mishap to Ares and golden Aphrodite--that is, that for the\r\nsame brief pleasure they would each gladly endure thrice the penalty.\r\n\r\nProfessor DuBois says that the chastity of the negro women has improved so\r\ngreatly \"that even in the back country districts not above nine per cent\r\nof the population may be classed as distinctly lewd.\"[168] Inquire of\r\nhonest witnesses who have good opportunities of observing--the farmers,\r\nsmall and large, and the storekeepers, in the country, those who do\r\ncontract work and the police in the cities--of all who have close access\r\nto negroes at all times, and especially at night; and the concurring\r\nreport will be that right correction of Professor DuBois' statement just\r\ngiven cannot stop with mere inversion of his percentages; that the fact\r\nis, no negroes in this lower class which we are now dealing with are\r\nchaste except those whose physical condition has made a virtue of\r\nnecessity.[169]\r\n\r\nIt is sadly true that men of all races are too prone to unchastity. It is\r\nchaste women that give human amelioration its main propulsion; for they\r\nmake every husband to know that the children around his fireside are his\r\nown. If I were asked in what one particular had my life-long comparison\r\nconvinced me that the two races are farthest apart, I would unhesitatingly\r\nanswer, in the character of the women of each--the average white woman,\r\nfrom her marriage on, forgetting all other men but her husband, the black\r\nwife always with a paramour, if to be had.\r\n\r\nThe tie which holds the family stanch is wanting. The men often cast aside\r\ntheir domestic burdens, and begin their lives over in a distant region\r\nwith a new woman. The wife and mother left behind does not mope. She has\r\ngenerally prearranged satisfactorily with another man.\r\n\r\nDisease is making great ravages in this lower class of negroes. I never\r\nknew of a case of consumption among the slaves, and I can recall but one\r\nserious case of pneumonia. Now these two diseases slay the negroes by\r\nhundreds. Before the war the negro was regarded as immune from yellow\r\nfever, and almost immune from dangerous malarial affections. He has lost\r\nhis charm against these also. There has been a dreadful increase of\r\ninsanity among them. The only ante-bellum case that I can recall was due\r\nto an accidental injury of the head.\r\n\r\nIt is but natural that the death rate among the negroes mounts fearfully.\r\nTheir great multiplication has far outrun their reasonable means of\r\nsubsistence. We note what a heavy burden a large family is to a man in\r\nhard times. I must believe that the thirteenth census will show a still\r\ngreater negro death-rate.\r\n\r\nWe shall sum up as to this lower class after we have described the\r\ndisplacement of black by white labor.\r\n\r\nNow we must consider the upper class. We need look only at its main\r\ndivisions, to wit, the negro farmers, and the well-to-do urban negroes.\r\n\r\nThe rose-colored statements of Professor DuBois as to the former cannot\r\nimpose upon residents of the south.[170] I shall begin with the negro farm\r\nowners of Georgia. In what he says of them in the second Bulletin\r\nmentioned in the last footnote he hardly ever looks away from the report\r\nof the comptroller-general of the State. I shall deal with relevant facts\r\nabout which the comptroller-general is not required to concern\r\nhimself--and of which the census takes but little note. Where agricultural\r\nland commands only a few dollars per acre a large part of it will get into\r\npossession of purchasers under title-bond who expect to work it and pay\r\nfor it in annual instalments out of its produce. Of course the vendor sees\r\nto it that he himself escapes taxation on this land, and so the\r\npurchasers, although they may have paid him but a trifle or nothing at\r\nall, are assessed as if they were the real owners, while the vendors are\r\nretaining the title as security. Soon after the war many a white planter,\r\nin order to get out of a failing business and procure capital for\r\nsomething else, sold his land in whole or part. He could find no purchaser\r\nbut some exceptional negro; and the latter could buy only on credit. Much\r\nof the lands so sold had to be retaken because the purchasers failed to\r\nmeet their payments. It was my observation when I left Greene county\r\ntwenty-three years ago that in that and the adjoining counties the number\r\nof negro owners of agricultural land was decreasing, and it is my\r\ninformation that such is now the case. This indicates an important fact\r\nnot shown in the reports of the comptroller-general, to wit, that a large\r\nnumber of the negroes appearing therein as owners are really not owners,\r\nand are losing their holdings.\r\n\r\nThe next fact to be mentioned is that, as I learn from residents, many\r\nfarms of which a negro had acquired the fee are heavily encumbered, and\r\noften fall to the local merchants.\r\n\r\nFurther, as Professor DuBois states, \"the land owned by negroes is usually\r\nthe less fertile, worn-out tracts.\"[171]\r\n\r\nAccording to the comptroller's report for 1903 the acres of white\r\nownership are 29,762,259, returned at a value of $121,629,094; which is\r\n$4,139 per acre. The per cent of the total value owned by the blacks is\r\n4.07. This result--that the negroes own a fraction over four per cent of\r\nthe improved lands of Georgia--must be corrected by proper deduction for\r\npurchase money debts, and also for encumbrances. It must be further\r\ncorrected by another deduction. The negroes land is considerably below the\r\naverage of the rest in quality and market value. Yet while the white\r\nreturns at $4.08 an acre, the other returns at $4.13. This higher\r\nvaluation is not because of conscientious avoidance of tax-dodging. It\r\ncomes from that optimistic exaggeration characterizing the race, which is\r\nvividly illustrated in Booker Washington's gravely stating that the love\r\nof knowledge by the average negroes of the south has become the \"marvel of\r\nmankind,\"[172] and in the extravagant assertion of Professor DuBois as to\r\ntheir chastity commented on a few pages back.\r\n\r\nThere are a few negro owners of farming lands that are prospering, but I\r\nam credibly informed that as a class they are falling behind.\r\n\r\nThe tenants--the renters, as they are commonly called--are the more\r\nprosperous negro farmers. The whites hold on to their lands more firmly\r\nthan they did some years ago, and the tenantry class both of whites and\r\nblacks is becoming larger. The whites in the Black Belt all believe that\r\nthe negroes generally belong to societies, in which they have bound\r\nthemselves not to hire to the former as house servants or for standing\r\nwages except when they cannot otherwise subsist. So most of the cotton is\r\nmade by tenants and croppers. They grade as many bad and mediocre, and a\r\nfew good. The latter work with a will, and make fair crops. They send\r\ntheir children off to expensive schools. When they die the property they\r\nhave accumulated is distributed and squandered, and a new\r\ntenant--generally, of late years, a white--succeeds.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed everywhere that some reliable white man is generally\r\nbacking or superintending a negro farmer that can get credit. The negro\r\nfarmers, in almost any large county in the Black Belt that you may select,\r\nthat are an exception can usually be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\n\r\nTheir implements and methods are primitive;[173] and they employ hardly\r\nany labor except that of their own families.[174] As soon as the negro\r\nfarmer's children have grown up they leave him; the negro laborers in his\r\nneighborhood become more idle every year, and they become also more\r\nscarce. It is not to be thought of that he employ white labor. This class\r\nwill give no help to the new agriculture, which I have glanced at in the\r\nlast chapter.\r\n\r\nTwenty-odd years ago when I left the planting section, the white\r\nlandowners all preferred negro tenants. But white tenants are now\r\npreferred. They do not send their children to school as much as the\r\nnegroes do, but keep them at work while the hoeing, which is the first\r\nmain thing to the cotton farmer, and the gathering, which is the second\r\nand last and greatest by far, are unfinished. The negroes' hoeing and\r\nother cultivation are bad; and after the crop is laid by until Christmas,\r\nduring which time comes the all-important laborious cotton-picking, they\r\nspend so much of their nights at church they are incapacitated from doing\r\ngood work. They lose much time by going to camp-meetings in the late\r\nsummer and early autumn, and riding on railroad excursion trains at every\r\nopportunity. The white tenants and their families, by careful \"chopping\r\nout\" and hoeing, get the proper \"stand\" and they pick clean; the negroes\r\nfall behind in both respects. The bettering credit of the white steadily\r\nhits the negro harder. The only tenants who are good for the rent are the\r\nclass a few of whom have cash of their own and the rest can get credit\r\nwith the local merchant for necessary supplies. Such tenants the\r\nlandowners seek after, and find every year more and more among the whites,\r\nand less and less among the blacks.\r\n\r\nEvery year a larger part of the staple crops of the south is made by\r\nwhites. The negroes have lately decreased in Kentucky. Mr. Tillinghast\r\nbrings forward, from Hoffman, weighty proofs that in the State just\r\nmentioned, which has just become the principal seat of tobacco growing,\r\nand also in the largest yielding counties of Virginia, that black labor\r\nconstantly grows less of the crop.[175] He uses Hoffman, too, to show that\r\nwhite labor is slowly expelling black from rice production.[176] The old\r\nsouth believed that rice culture was sure death to the white, Mr.\r\nTillinghast quotes, as to the greatest agricultural product of the south,\r\nthis from Professor Wilcox: \"It would probably be a conservative\r\nstatement to say that at least four-fifths of the cotton was ... in 1860\r\ngrown by negroes; at the present time [i.e. in 1899] probably not one-half\r\nis thus grown.\"[177]\r\n\r\nCompare this further: \"He [Hoffman] finds that 'with less than one-half as\r\nlarge a colored population as Mississippi,... Texas produced in 1894\r\nalmost three times the cotton crop of the former State.' Even more\r\nsignificant is the fact that with almost twice the colored population of\r\n1860, Mississippi, in 1894, produced less cotton than thirty-four years\r\nago.'\"[178]\r\n\r\nVery significant are the facts lately published by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment which show that in an area of some sixty-three per cent of the\r\nproduction, the white outpicks the negro. \"One hundred and fifty-two\r\ncounties, with a negro population amounting to seventy-five per cent of\r\nthe whole, averaged one hundred and eleven pounds per day, whereas one\r\nhundred and ninety-two counties, with a white population constituting\r\nseventy-five per cent or more of the whole, averaged one hundred and\r\nforty-eight pounds per day,\"[179] that is, the white picked one-third more\r\nthan the black. There are other statements in this bulletin of importance\r\nhere. I can give this one only:\r\n\r\n    \"In the Indian Territory and Oklahoma, where the whites represent\r\n    about eighty per cent of the population (including Indians) the\r\n    average number of pounds picked is greater than in any of the States\r\n    except Arkansas and Texas. The highest number of pounds picked in any\r\n    State is one hundred and seventy-two in Texas, the counties\r\n    represented having a white population of eighty per cent.\"[180]\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas the population of the counties mentioned was fifty-nine per\r\ncent white, the rest negro.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that the foregoing estimates do great injustice to\r\nthe whites. They assume that there is no inferiority of the negro to the\r\nwhite except the per diem quantity of cotton picked. Ponder the statement\r\nas to a county of Georgia which I now give.\r\n\r\n    \"According to the ginners' report, Madison county made sixteen\r\n    thousand bales of cotton in 1902. Its negro population is about three\r\n    thousand, its white, twelve thousand. The negroes are one-fifth and\r\n    the whites four-fifths, and out of every five bales the negroes ought\r\n    to have made at least one and the whites four. But the former do not\r\n    average as well as the others. The white who runs one plow, whose wife\r\n    and children do the hoeing and picking, probably makes ten bales. The\r\n    negro who runs one plow, whose wife and children hoe and pick, hardly\r\n    makes more than five or six bales. The greater part of the cotton\r\n    credited to negro labor is made by negroes who are superintended by\r\n    white men.\"[181]\r\n\r\nWeighing all that I have just told, I am as sure as I can be of anything\r\nin the near future, that the negro will soon be of greatly diminished\r\nimportance as laborer, cropper, renter, or farming landowner in the\r\nstaples of southern agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of property than improved lands set out in the\r\nreport of the comptroller-general, such as $3,531,471 of horses, cattle,\r\nand stock of all kinds, $810,553 of plantation and mechanical tools. Such\r\nneeds no separate consideration. These holdings do not in view of what we\r\nhave told, give the negro farmer any strong foothold.\r\n\r\nNearly all that remains of the rural upper class--the negroes in trades,\r\nprofessions, mercantile business, etc.--is so evidently dependent upon the\r\nmasses of the lower class, now gravitating away from the country that the\r\nmost of it can be incidentally disposed of at certain places later on in\r\nthe chapter and the rest be treated as negligible.\r\n\r\nThe \"city or town property\" of the negroes of Georgia, according to the\r\nreport of the comptroller-general for 1903, amounts in value to\r\n$44,668,620. From all that I can learn, while it is largely, it is\r\nconsiderably less, encumbered than the real and personal property of the\r\nnegro farmers.\r\n\r\nA large admixture of Caucasian blood marks nearly every member of the\r\nupper class both in country and town. I note that occasionally a coalblack\r\nacquires property, on which his miser grip is tighter than that of an\r\naccumulating Irishman; but such are very few. There is hardly a well-to-do\r\nnegro in work, occupation, profession, or property, who is not several\r\nshades at least removed from coalblack. Mr. Tillinghast observes \"that the\r\nporters, cooks, and waiters on a Pullman train are usually mulattoes,\r\nwhile the laborers in the gang on the roadbed are nearly all black.\"[182]\r\nIn this day when the pictures of prominent men and women are in many\r\nillustrated magazines and papers, it is to be observed that hardly one of\r\na negro shows unmixed blood. Thus a recent monthly contains pictures of\r\nJudson W. Lyons, R. H. Terrell, Kelly Miller, Archibald H. Grinke, T.\r\nThomas Fortune, Daniel Murray, and Booker Washington.[183] Of these the\r\nthird only, to my eye, seems all negro; and I cannot be confident that he\r\nis wholly without appreciable white blood. His head has the shape of a\r\nwhite man's.\r\n\r\nIt is my observation that a negro entirely pure in blood hardly ever gets\r\nout of the lower class; and that if he does he is much more unprogressive\r\nthan an average member of the upper class. Note what Bishop Holsey says of\r\nhow amalgamation with the white improves the descendants of the blacks, in\r\na passage quoted later herein.\r\n\r\nThis upper class contains only persons of exceptional blood, talent, or\r\nsome other rare fortune. The higher education, and the education which is\r\nnow best of all for the negro--industrial education--is for this little\r\ncircle only. Hampton and Tuskegee do not open to all comers. Mr.\r\nTillinghast convincingly proves that those who have got really good\r\ntraining at the two institutions just named are far above the average\r\nnegro in physical stamina, education, and other important\r\nparticulars.[184] The graduates go forth, not to benefit their brothers in\r\nthe lower class, but to win for themselves surer and higher standing in\r\nthe upper class.\r\n\r\nSome of the resources which this urban section of the upper class have\r\nenjoyed for a while they are losing, as I shall tell when I hereinafter\r\nsummarize the details of white encroachment. But other resources open to\r\nthem. Such are professions like dentists, eye, ear, and throat surgeons,\r\ndoctors, barbers, and others who must content themselves with only colored\r\npatronage; such the growing retail trade, multiplying boarding-houses,\r\nrestaurants, and saloons, finding their custom exclusively in the\r\nincreasing negro town population. The number of negroes who become\r\nteachers, lecturers, preachers, authors, etc., steadily augments. Other\r\nresources of this upper class can be pointed out, but it needs not here.\r\nAlthough nearly always when the father who has struggled up dies, his\r\nproperty, as we saw to be the case with the negro farmer, goes, and no\r\nchild succeeds to his occupation, there is perhaps generally compensation\r\nfor his loss by the accession of some other who has got up out of the\r\nlower class by an extraordinarily lucky jump. It is clear that the class\r\nis without the wholesome influence of uninterrupted inheritance, from\r\ngeneration to generation, of faculty and character progressively\r\nimproving. Take this inheritance away from the men and women of any\r\nenlightened nation and it would be to lower them very near to the level of\r\nbarbarism. It is also nearly certain that there will be no further\r\ninfusion of white blood into this class, by reason of the hostility to\r\ninter-mixture which becomes stronger--yea, intenser--every year. The\r\nprobable consequence will be the dilution of much of the white blood now\r\nin the upper class through the lower class to such an extent that it will\r\npractically disappear. But some of it, I think, will persist, perhaps\r\nincrease in degree--preserved by the aversion of many to intermarriage\r\nwith persons less white than themselves, and occasional intermarriage with\r\nwhite persons in northern States.\r\n\r\nExceptional ones of this class enjoy privileges of the higher education,\r\nafforded by schools and colleges opulently endowed by private persons,\r\nwhich education is bringing forth fruit in teachers, clergymen, and\r\nrepresentatives of the learned class. There are already some good books,\r\nas well as sermons, speeches, poems, essays, and short articles, by\r\nnegroes which have won favorable opinion in our literature; and there is\r\nevidently to be steady increase.\r\n\r\nThere is among some of this urban upper class the beginning at least of\r\nbetter things under the lead of better mothers. We must not be\r\nunreasonable in our demands that these women who carry in their veins a\r\nvery appreciable proportion of polyandrous blood shall become immaculately\r\nchaste at once. Leave them to the influence of the improving society in\r\nwhich they move; to the noble and faithful efforts of such as Mrs. Booker\r\nWashington; their persistent imitation of white mothers; the teachings of\r\nthe really christian pastors whom the negro universities are beginning to\r\nsend abroad in numbers far too few; but especially of all to devoted\r\nconjugal, maternal, and domestic duty. This last has made the pigeon\r\nmother unconquerably true to her life mate. It will do the same for the\r\nnegro woman.--Let us consider the class further for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe longer you look at it with unbefogged eyes the more plainly you see it\r\nis really a natural aristocracy hugging its special privileges more\r\njealously every year, and that cleavage in interest, affection, and\r\ndestiny between it and the other class goes on so steadily that it must\r\nafter some little while yawn in the sight of the entire nation. Here in\r\nAtlanta, as seems to be the case in all the southern cities, there are\r\nrespectable negro districts and also negro slums. The latter are the more\r\nnumerous and far more populous. The inhabitants of these several districts\r\nare almost as wide apart as are the whites in the fashionable circle and\r\nthe million of poor folk without.\r\n\r\nI must postpone my final contrast of these two classes until I have\r\ncompleted what remains to be said of the displacement of black by white\r\nlabor. For a few years after the war it was so slow moving that I was not\r\nconfidently aware of it. Now it has proceeded so far, and so much\r\naccelerated its pace, that I can indicate it with something like accuracy.\r\nIn the thirteenth chapter I noted its beginning. This was when the mother\r\nand her girls took upon themselves the daily indoor work, and the father\r\nand sons took upon themselves the outdoor work, morning, noon, and night,\r\naround the house and the horse-lot,--the word which in the south\r\ncorresponds to the barnyard of the northern farmer. Especially significant\r\nis it that a large per cent of the white matrons in the country have at\r\nlast discarded the negro laundry-woman and habitually themselves use the\r\nwashtub for their families. The impulse to supplant negro labor showed its\r\ngreatest energy where the black population had been sparse. I have heard\r\nmy friend, F. C. Foster, a resident of Morgan county, often mention that\r\nwhat were before the war the rich and poor sides of that county have\r\nbecome interchanged; where most of the large slave-owners lived was the\r\nrich, but now is the poor side; and the other, where there were but few\r\nslaves, is now the rich side.\r\n\r\nI see many proofs in every quarter that the whites of the Black Belt have\r\ncommenced to learn good lessons from their neighbors outside, and show\r\nevery year a greater self-reliance. Many more causes than I have space to\r\nset down conspire to increase this self-reliance. The small farmer must,\r\nby himself or his wife and children or white help, do such things as\r\nthese: work his brood mare; care for his blooded stock, fine poultry, and\r\nbees; handle his reaper, mower, and more expensive tools and implements;\r\ngive all necessary attention to his orchards and larger and smaller\r\nfruits,--industries which, with that of the dairy, are now pushing\r\nforward with mounting energy; for he has learned that the average negro\r\ncannot be trusted in these and many other things which can be suggested.\r\n\r\nI must not overstate the advance of white production and labor upon black\r\nin the country. In the regions of densest negro populations the whites\r\nshow a backwardness in taking to work that is discouraging. A very\r\nobservant man familiar with Jackson and Madison counties of Georgia, both\r\nof which are out of the Black Belt, and who now lives where negroes\r\noutnumber the whites, not long ago made this comparison, while answering\r\nmy inquiries: \"In Jackson and Madison the whites work. A farmer who runs\r\nbut one plow does all the plowing. He hires but one negro. In my present\r\ncounty the one-horse farmer always hires two negroes, one to plow and the\r\nother to hoe, and the only work he does is to boss them.\" But the negroes\r\nare going away from many parts, in fact from nearly all, of the Black\r\nBelt. Wherever they have become scarce, the whites go to work; and, as is\r\nnow occurring in that part of Greene county called \"The Fork,\" and in\r\nplaces in adjoining counties, the lands rise greatly in market value. In\r\nmany parts of Oglethorpe, Wilkes, Taliaferro, and Greene counties, where\r\nnegroes were doing practically all the agricultural labor when I came to\r\nAtlanta, I learn that many white boys are becoming good all-around\r\nworkers. It surprised me greatly to be told that in this region in\r\ndifferent places the white women and children, as soon as the dew is off\r\nin the morning, go to cotton picking, and they become so efficient that\r\noften no extra labor need be hired to finish that greatest task of all to\r\nthe farmer. Before the war, all of us white boys picked just enough of\r\ncotton to learn that our backs could never be made to stand picking all\r\nday. The whites now beating the negro in what we once thought he only\r\ncould do, and white women in the old slave regions doing the family\r\nlaundry,--these begin a marvellous economic revolution.\r\n\r\nThe cotton mills and other manufactories rapidly springing up in many\r\nsouthern localities are developing a class of white operatives. Mining of\r\nvarious kinds is on the increase. Stone, slate, and marble cutting,\r\ncabinet making, and other trades attract greater numbers to follow them.\r\nWhite railroad employees, printers, engravers, stenographers, typewriters,\r\nand those in numerous other gainful occupations, grow in numbers. White\r\nwomen and girls stream to work for employers every morning. In all places,\r\nif you but look long enough, you catch sight of swelling crowds of the\r\nrace who once lived almost entirely from slave labor now doing their own\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI will close what I have to say of this part of the subject by\r\nobservations of Atlanta. When I settled here, the barbers, shoe repairers,\r\nblacksmiths, band-musicians, sick-nurses, seamstresses, ostlers, and\r\ncarriage-drivers were, so far as I noted, black almost without exception.\r\nNow the first five are nearly all white, and whites steadily multiply in\r\nthe rest, although they are far from being in a majority. The only\r\nexpulsion of white by negro labor that I have noted is the substitution by\r\nthe bicycle messenger service and the telegraph of negro for white\r\nmessengers, made not long ago. These messenger services thrive by\r\nexploiting child labor. By the change mentioned they got much larger and\r\nstronger boys--often grown-up ones--for the same price which they used to\r\npay white children a year or two older than mere tots. Against the recent\r\nloss just told I have these two recent gains of the whites to tell. There\r\nhad always been only negro waiters in the restaurants. In some of them\r\nthe eaters at the lunch counters are now served by a white man standing\r\nbehind it; and what he needs, if it is not kept in store so near that he\r\ncan reach it, is brought to him, at his command, by a negro, whom you may\r\ncall his waiter. This negro also wipes off the counter. After we became\r\nused to white barbers we generally preferred them to the black ones. And I\r\nnote that a growing majority of those who frequent the counters like the\r\nwhite waiters, although I now and then hear a growler say that he would\r\nrather have a waiter that he can reprimand and speak to as he pleases.\r\nSome of the restaurants begin to advertise that their help is all white.\r\nWith the superior alertness and quickness of his race, a white behind the\r\ncounter accomplishes more than twice as much as the former black. To use a\r\ncommon saying, the white waiters keep at active work all their twelve\r\nhours as if they were fighting fire, while the negroes commanded by them\r\ntake things easy. Every one of the whites is constantly on the lookout for\r\na better place; and generally he manages somehow, after a short while, to\r\nget it. One who now serves me studies bookkeeping two hours every night,\r\nand will doubtless soon be giving satisfaction in his chosen occupation to\r\nsome business house. The negroes look out only for tips, are interested in\r\nnothing but amusements, and never get any higher. Bear in mind, they are\r\nconsiderably above the average negro in qualifications and station.\r\n\r\nThe other instance is that some co-operating Greek boys have recently\r\ncaptured a very considerable proportion of the shoe-shining. They provide\r\nmore convenient and comfortable seats and give a better shine than the\r\nnegro does, in a much shorter time, and for the same price. It looks now\r\nas if they are bound to make full conquest of the business. With my\r\nexperience it is more of a surprise to me to see clothes laundered,\r\ntables waited on, and shoes shined by the whites, than even to see cotton\r\npicked by them.\r\n\r\nBut to go on with Atlanta. Occupations requiring the management of\r\nmachinery or peculiar skill are nearly always filled by whites. The street\r\nrailroad conductors and motormen are all white. The only negroes connected\r\nwith the road that I, as a passenger, generally see is the curve-greaser,\r\nand now and then a helper on the construction car. The steam railroads\r\nwill employ a negro fireman because of his ability to stand heat, but they\r\ndo not trust him to oil and wipe. In the smaller buildings negro\r\nelevator-runners some time ago were frequent, but now it is clear that the\r\nwhites will soon have the occupation exclusively. There is, I believe,\r\nmore building, in this year of 1904, in Atlanta than ever before. The\r\npreparation of all the material is done by white labor in the\r\nplaning-mills and machine-shops, while the more unskilled work of putting\r\nit in place is done by the negro carpenter.\r\n\r\nThe lathers and plasterers are all negroes, there are more negro brick and\r\nstone masons than white, and the carpenters are nearly all negroes, there\r\nbeing but few young white ones. The painters are about equally divided.\r\nThe negro's standard of living is so much lower than that of the white,\r\nthat where there is competition he proves victor by accepting a price upon\r\nwhich the white man cannot live. But the latter does not throw up the\r\nsponge. At the point where race competition begins he induces the negroes,\r\nwhenever he can, to join his union, and soon to have one of their own.\r\nJust now (August, 1904) there are not enough of brickmasons to supply the\r\ndemand, and there is both a white and black union of that trade. But so\r\nfar there has been no success in the efforts made for a black carpenters'\r\nunion. The negroes have of late years kept such firm hold of the trade,\r\nthat it seems no young whites come into it, there being but few white\r\ncarpenters in Atlanta under forty years of age. The negroes understand\r\nthat their grip is due to their ability to work for lower pay than the\r\nwhites, and when the union is proposed they say to themselves, that means\r\nonly more places for white carpenters and less for us. But the trend to\r\nform unions seems to strengthen. There is a mixed union of tailors,\r\nseparate unions of blacksmiths' helpers, moulders' helpers, painters, and\r\nalso of brickmasons, as just mentioned. There is a black union of\r\nplasterers and no white one. It is to be remembered that the initiative to\r\nunionize the negro workman comes from the other race, the purpose being to\r\nbalk the exertions of employers to depress wages by encouraging the\r\ncheaper worker. Consider the dilemma of the negro workman invited into the\r\nunion by whites. He foresees that if he accepts, his race will after a\r\nwhile be swamped in the trade by white competition. At the same time he\r\nforesees that if he does not accept, he cannot increase his income, which\r\nin its smallness becomes more and more inadequate to sustain himself and\r\nfamily under the constant demands of the day for larger and larger\r\nexpenditure. The immediate needs of those dependent upon him will\r\ngenerally decide his course. I cannot say how long the negro carpenters of\r\nAtlanta will refuse the proposal to federate themselves in a union with\r\nthe whites; but this I can say, that all attempts of the negroes to keep\r\nthe whites out of any well-paid vocation must fail, even with the most\r\nresolute and stubbornly maintained effort. As I view it on the spot the\r\nwhite forward movement palpably strengthens and the defence weakens. Bear\r\nin mind that the whites receive constant re-enforcement from all other\r\nwhite American and European communities, and the blacks are confined to\r\ntheir own resources of supply, all the while declining.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just told as happening in Atlanta intelligent and observant\r\nnegroes detect to be but a part of the general recession before white\r\ncompetition. The National Negro Business League had its last meeting at\r\nIndianapolis. In one of the resolutions adopted, mainly because of the\r\ninfluence of Dr. Booker T. Washington, its president, occurs this\r\nallegation, \"During our discussions it has been clearly developed that the\r\nrace has been steadily losing many avenues of valuable employment.\" The\r\nresolution ascribes this to lack of proper training, and recommends that\r\nthe lack be supplied. A negro makes this acute and true comment, which I\r\nwould have attended to here, and considered again when further on I\r\ndiscuss what the industrial schools can do:\r\n\r\n    \"That the colored man has of late years been losing many avenues of\r\n    employment is quite true, but the conclusion that this is due to a\r\n    lack of training is not to be hastily accepted. Nobody believes that\r\n    our people are now less capable of work than they were when recognized\r\n    in these avenues of labor. As a matter of fact they are far better\r\n    equipped now than they were then, or Tuskegee and Hampton and the\r\n    other industrial schools that are crowded from year to year are making\r\n    a signal failure. In those days men were picked up here and there and\r\n    started in as apprentices as green as they could be. Now thousands of\r\n    them are prepared before they go out to work. The two chief reasons\r\n    our folks are not employed so universally now is, first, the fact,\r\n    that _the white south has gone to work with its own hands_, and\r\n    second, the negro refuses longer to work for nothing. _The continued\r\n    assertion by some of our leaders that a man who can labor will not be\r\n    discriminated against, is untrue. The preference is given to the white\r\n    man in almost every case, and the negro is allowed to do the work he\r\n    refuses._ It is well enough to ask our people to secure industrial\r\n    education, but it is wrong to place all our ills upon a lack of such\r\n    training or to recommend industrial education as a panacea. Though it\r\n    was quite inevitable that the league should adopt such a resolution as\r\n    an endorsement of its president's policy.\"[185]\r\n\r\nI have italicized in the quotation the statements specially pertinent\r\nhere. They are very weighty proofs supporting my proposition of fact, to\r\nwit, that there is now waging between the whites and negroes an\r\ninternecine war for every opportunity of labor above the very lowest and\r\nunskilled.\r\n\r\nI ask also that it be noted that the writer is utterly unconscious of any\r\nnegroes than those of the upper class. Not a thing that he says can be\r\napplied to the ninety-five per cent.\r\n\r\nThe death rate of the negro is coming close to, while that of the white\r\nkeeps far below, the birth rate. Rapid native increase and vigorous\r\nimmigration for the whites, nothing but slow and decreasing propagation\r\nfor the negroes; and larger and larger hosts of the former giving their\r\nchampions active sympathy and help--the event of this inter-race struggle\r\nover the trades and occupations may be delayed, but it cannot be doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not forget that the negroes now in mind belong all to what\r\nI have called the upper class. Their number is so small and its promise of\r\nincrease so slight that I should hardly have done more than allude to\r\nthem, if the subject did not emphasize so impressively as it does the\r\ninevitable expulsion of negro by white labor. Let me explain this fully.\r\nProfessor Wilcox, summarizing the pertinent information of the twelfth\r\ncensus as to ten leading occupations competed for by the two races in the\r\nsouth, states that in the year 1900 the per cent of negroes was larger in\r\nseven and smaller in nine of them than ten years before.[186] That alone\r\nshows white gain. But I want you to add to Professor Wilcox's statement\r\nsomething of which the census gives no hint, that is, the bound forward of\r\nthe negroes on one side, and the inaction of the whites on the other,\r\nduring many years beginning with emancipation in 1865. When that has been\r\ndone, the encroachment of white labor upon black effected in the\r\ncomparatively short time since its beginning appears almost prodigious. It\r\nis somewhat like the race-horse, who, falling far behind in the first\r\nstages of a long heat, at last wakes up and gains so fast that nobody will\r\nbet against him. It means that the whites are now as ruthlessly taking all\r\nopportunities of labor away from the blacks, as their fathers took his\r\nlands away from the American Indian.\r\n\r\nWe can now say our last word in contrasting the two classes. Many fail to\r\nsee clearly the difference between them. Thus Ernest Hamlin Abbott[187]\r\nand Edgar Gardner Murphy,[188] in their pleasant discussions, only here\r\nand there, and as if casually, say something which momentarily implies\r\nexistence of the lower class, and then relapse into claiming for all of\r\nthe southern negroes, if not the actual condition of the upper class, at\r\nleast hopeful possibility of soon achieving it. These two kind-hearted men\r\nrepresent a large number who firmly believe that education and the church\r\nare now rapidly elevating the negro masses, when the fact is far\r\notherwise. Many from the north see nothing but the upper class. In what he\r\nwrites of the negroes whom he knew in public life, the late Senator Hoar\r\nwas utterly unconscious of the average negro whom all of us in the south\r\nknow.[189] Dr. Lyman Abbott, a most benign example of broad and almost\r\nperfect tolerance to both sections, taking all southern hearts by his\r\nloving sympathy with and full justice to the better sentiment of our\r\nsection in every matter of importance except the appointment of negroes to\r\noffice, he never seems to have in mind any negroes but the prominent ones\r\nwho are giving their fellows industrial or the higher education, and those\r\nwho have been blessed with either. Do but consider how pathetically he\r\nlately lamented the case of the \"white negro\" lady shut out from the\r\ncircle of cultivation and kept confined in one of ignorance and lowness.\r\nThis last circle--its magnitude, its bad and desperate state--he really\r\nknows nothing about. He can no more study its deplorable and heartrending\r\nconditions than the mother can endure to have the expectoration of her\r\nchild threatened with tuberculosis examined under the microscope. Chicago\r\nhas been for some while \"farthest to the front\" in the struggle against\r\ncorporation rule. Her battles for direct nomination, direct legislation,\r\nand municipal ownership have been chronicled more accurately and\r\nintelligently in the _Public_ than I can find elsewhere. Therefore I read\r\nit with diligence; and I relish more and more Mr. Post's sound and able\r\nanti-machine and anti-plutocratic advocacy. But in everything that the\r\npaper says or quotes on the race question I am pained to note that its\r\nshortcoming is greater than its very high merit in preaching democratic\r\ndemocracy. Mr. Ernest Hamlin Abbott does now and then call the negroes a\r\nchild race, but Mr. Post repudiates all backwardness and inferiority of\r\nrace. He seems to maintain the equality of the average negro to the\r\naverage white in all essentials of good citizenship with the zeal of\r\nWendell Phillips, when the providence of the American union frenzied and\r\ndeputed him to infuriate its defenders against the disunion slave-owners.\r\nMr. Post, as appears to me, believes with all his heart in the doctrine of\r\nMrs. Stowe and Whittier, to mention no others, as to the negro. Every\r\npertinent utterance in his paper indicates that he has no thought whatever\r\nof the lower class. A most striking illustration of this is how he treats\r\nthe story of the negro Richard R. Wright.[190] When the latter was ten\r\nyears old he won great fame by the answer he made General Howard, who had\r\ninquired of the negro children at the Storrs School in Atlanta, just after\r\nthe close of the war, \"Tell me what message I shall take back from you to\r\nthe people of the north?\" His face ablaze with enthusiasm, the boy Richard\r\nsaid, \"Tell 'em we're risin'.\" Whittier went as far astray over this as we\r\nsaw that he did in his \"Laus Deo.\" In his poem celebrating he sang--\r\n\r\n  \"O black boy of Atlanta!\r\n  But half was spoken:\r\n  The slave's chain and the Master's\r\n  Alike are broken.\r\n  The one curse of the races\r\n  Held both in tether:\r\n  They are rising--all are rising,\r\n  The black and white together.\"\r\n\r\nI never read the last two lines without in mind admonishing the author,\r\n\"Praise in departing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Post published the story, he ought to have mentioned that while\r\nthe boy who sent forth the winged words did rise and has become president\r\nof the Georgia Industrial College, yet that such negroes are far more rare\r\nthan millionaires, and the main host of their people in the south were\r\nsinking at the time, and have been sinking ever since. It is not true that\r\n\"all are rising.\" The whites have recently begun to rise; five per cent\r\nonly of the negroes, most of whom are largely white, are rising, while the\r\nrest of them are doomed, if the nation does not interpose. And the colored\r\ndentist of Chicago, slighted by some of the white dentists--Mr. Post sees\r\nin him, just as he sees in Richard R. Wright, a representative of the\r\nnegro millions.\r\n\r\nThese conscientious and amiable gentlemen are wasting much effort\r\nuselessly. There is no very urgent problem as to the upper class of\r\nnegroes. It has two strings to its bow. If the lower class should perish,\r\na large part of it--perhaps the greater part--will be assimilated. Every\r\nday I detect a larger movement toward the north among our better-to-do\r\nnegroes. I hear of girls that get places as chambermaids and cooks, of\r\nboys that find places as ostlers or other domestic service; and I have\r\nheard of a few families who have gone in a body, also of some men who have\r\nleft wife and children here. They believe the north will allow their votes\r\nto be counted, will not proscribe them in society as the south does, and\r\nthey will probably get for themselves or their descendants intermarriage\r\nwith whites. The determination of these southern negroes towards the north\r\nwill probably gain in volume and energy. It is plain that those who go do\r\nmuch increase their chances of final absorption into the body of whites.\r\nThis assimilation is one of the two strings. And if the American negroes\r\nshall one day be conceded their own State, as I hope and pray for, their\r\nleaders must come from the upper class. That is the other of the two\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\nThis upper class of southern negroes has demonstrated full ability to take\r\ncare of itself. It has its schools and colleges, newspapers, magazines,\r\nand augmenting literature, its widening circle of students and readers,\r\nand its good shepherds and able leaders. It rapidly wins favor in the\r\nsouth. A few of our residents see no other negroes but those in this upper\r\nclass, a most striking instance of which is Joel Chandler Harris's\r\nsweeping assertion \"that the overwhelming majority of the negroes in all\r\nparts of the south, _especially in the agricultural regions, are leading_\r\nsober and _industrious lives_.\"[191] When one who fully understands the\r\nsituation studies the assertion just quoted he sees from the context that\r\nthe writer was led to make it because he had at the time in his eyes only\r\na few of the better negroes in the Atlanta upper class. This is powerful\r\ntestimony to their prosperity and self-maintaining faculty. Similarly the\r\nChicago _Public_ rates the four hundred inhabitants of Boley in the Creek\r\nnation as common or average negroes. According to a news dispatch\r\nmentioned in that paper the town is only a year old, has \"two churches, a\r\nschool-house, several large stores, and a $5,000 cotton gin, owned and\r\ncontrolled exclusively by negroes.\" It is without a system of law and\r\nwithout municipal government, and \"yet no serious crime or offence of any\r\nkind has been committed in the place.\" These four hundred negroes do not\r\npermit any white man to settle in the town. Commenting in conclusion upon\r\nthe news, the _Public_ says, \"If that dispatch is not a canard,\r\nAnglo-Saxon civilization has something to learn of one race which it has\r\noutraged and abused and despised.\"[192]\r\n\r\nAny such place as Boley, if a reality, is peopled only by negroes of the\r\nupper class, and, further, only by those who have been sifted out from the\r\nrest of that class by a peculiarly drastic selection. Had they not each\r\nhad remarkable good fortune, extraordinary capacity, and exceptional\r\nexperience and training, Boley would never have been heard of. I ask that\r\nthe fair-minded make two comparisons. 1. Suppose four hundred negroes--not\r\nnaturally selected, but taken in a body, just as each one comes, from the\r\nmasses of the lower class described herein--given opportunity to found a\r\ntown of their own amid what we may call Boley conditions, what would be\r\nthe result? You may be sure that what occurred in Hayti when the reins of\r\ngovernment were suddenly given to the negroes at large would in some sort\r\nbe repeated. 2. Compare Boley in all its bloom and happy condition as\r\ndescribed in the _Public_ with certain communities of select whites, which\r\nhave flourished now and then for years, without formal government; say the\r\nAmana community. If this be rightly done, social organism of select whites\r\nwill at once appear to be incomparably superior to that of select negroes.\r\n\r\nI have tried my hardest to make my readers see as clearly as one bred in\r\nthe south ought to see what a world-wide difference there is between the\r\nsmall upper class and the numerous lower class of negroes. If I have\r\nsucceeded they will agree with me that it is the better policy to leave\r\nthe upper class, for the present, just where it is. If this advice be\r\nfollowed, that class will flourish, and some day either be assimilated, or\r\nbe giving benign salvation to the lower class in the negro State.\r\nEspecially should this upper class eschew politics. Booker Washington in\r\npreaching this is the only real American prophet of the day. With all of\r\nhis zeal for his race, he is far better appreciated in the south than in\r\nthe north, and perhaps just as popular. What a lamentable arrest of its\r\nbenign development it would be to this upper class to turn it away from\r\nindustrial betterment of its condition to lead the mass of the negroes at\r\nthe polls in a struggle for rule and office! That would be something like\r\nrenewing the conditions that developed the Ku-Klux Klan.\r\n\r\nIt is the great body of the southern negroes--those in the lower class,\r\nwho have no string at all, nor even a bow--that demands the profoundest\r\nattention. I wish I could make every white man, woman, and child of\r\nAmerica see them just as they are. As I compare them with what they were\r\nin 1865 I note they have advanced somewhat in mental arithmetic, because\r\nof practice in computing small sums of money involved in their wages and\r\npurchases; that they have learned somewhat of self-providence, and very\r\nmuch endurance of want (which last is really a reversion to a trait of\r\ntheir West African ancestors); and that the per cent of illiteracy among\r\nthem has been greatly lessened. On the other hand, each generation becomes\r\nmore disinclined to work, and its vagrants multiply; each generation more\r\nprone to live by crime, more unchaste, and more quick to desert their\r\nconjugal partners and children. Especially are they far more unhealthy and\r\nprone to insanity, and their death rate rapidly rising. They have no\r\nresource but unskilled labor of the lowest and cheapest grade; white\r\ncompetition in agriculture and domestic service, machinery in other\r\nfields, such as the scrape which has superseded the dump-cart, the\r\nimproved steam-shovel and method of handling construction trains, and the\r\nsteam laundry, steadily curtailing that resource; a slothful, improvident,\r\nand wasteful disposition curtailing it still further. The resurrecting\r\nhand of the trades union cannot reach down to them. Steadily they are more\r\nuseless to every upbuilder of the coming south except the wage-depresser.\r\nMore and more they get in the way of real progress in every direction. And\r\nas their supplies of necessaries diminish they get in one another's way.\r\nNearly all of the whites who were bound to them in the domestic love of\r\nthe old south times are dead. Most naturally and unavoidably as the new\r\ngeneration discerns the growing incompatibility of their stay in the\r\nsection with its true welfare, unfriendliness comes and grows. Listless,\r\nlethargic, careless, without initiative, without opportunity and coercion\r\nto make use of it, these multitudes of inveterate have-nothings are in a\r\nbottomless gulf of want, immorality, crime, and disease. A true\r\nphilanthropist has familiarized the world with the \"submerged tenth.\" Mr.\r\nErnest Hamlin Abbott, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Joel Chandler Harris, Dr. Abbott,\r\nMr. Post, stand beside me on the strand, and fix your eyes, minds, and\r\nhearts upon the slowly drowning ninety-five per cent of the southern\r\nnegroes. Lay aside the excess of your devotion to the upper class. It does\r\nnot need it. The Chicago dentist, as the _Public_ itself reports, was\r\nreally more than indemnified for the insult given him because of his color\r\nby the sympathetic resentment of white members of his profession. Why will\r\nyou keep agitating the nation in behalf of a few thousands, who are well\r\nable to maintain themselves, and neglect millions who require, as Mr.\r\nTillinghast says, some heroic remedy for their salvation?\r\n\r\nI shall now tell you the utter inadequacy of Hampton, Tuskegee, and the\r\nlike, after which I shall consider what, in my judgment, is the only\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nThe annual output, as we may call it, of all the negro educational\r\ninstitutions in the south is a mere drop in the bucket when compared with\r\nthe enormous need. The latest reliable figures accessible to me are those\r\nof Booker Washington for 1897. They are as follows: 13,581 receiving\r\nindustrial training, 2,108 collegiate education, 2,410 classical\r\ninstruction, and 1,311 \"taking the professional course,\"[193]--the last\r\nthree aggregating 5,829. Suppose the entire 17,999 were following\r\nindustrial courses, and that every one graduated with credit; and suppose\r\nthere be added the work of the land companies providing homes and every\r\nother enterprise helping the negro in any way--suppose this output to be\r\ntrebled annually from this time on (which is far above possibility for\r\nmany years yet, to say nothing of probability), what would be its\r\naccomplishment? Why, no more than a slight shower in a few townships\r\nduring the drought a few years ago would have done in preventing injury to\r\nthe Kansas corn crop. When you attend, you understand that the great\r\nadvantages of these excellent institutions are only for a few lucky\r\nnegroes,--picked ones of the upper class,--and not for the millions whose\r\ncrying need is for opportunity to earn honest daily bread and a really\r\nbenevolent coercion to use the opportunity. The problem, what to do for\r\nthis mass, cannot be solved by philippics against such things as _de\r\nfacto_ or constitutional disfranchisement of the blacks, lynching them,\r\nshowing them disrespect in military parades, giving them Jim Crow cars,\r\nand not dividing the educational fund more liberally with them; nor would\r\nit contribute one jot or tittle towards its solution if every lady in\r\nAmerica cordially received in her drawing-room the few negroes who have\r\nmost deservedly won the respect of the nation. To solve this problem,\r\nsomething must be found which will train and elevate the average negro,\r\nwhile the exceptional one is at the industrial school or college, or\r\nstudying for a profession; something which will check the prevalent\r\nreversion away from monogamic family life, and stimulate that life to\r\ndevelop steadily; something also which will impart to this entire mass\r\npermanent and strengthening impulse to better its condition. The only\r\nthing that can do this is to separate the negro as far as may be from the\r\nwhites, give him his own State in our union, and constrain him there with\r\nvigilant kindness to subsist and govern himself in such ways as suit him.\r\nI have long thought that our negroes had far stronger claim upon the\r\nnation for land than the uncivilizable redskins on whom we have lavished\r\nso much expense in vain.\r\n\r\nRighteousness demands that we give the former full opportunity to develop\r\nnormally in self-government. Put him in a State of his own on our\r\ncontinent; provide irrepealably in the organic law that all land and\r\npublic service franchises be common property; give no political rights\r\ntherein to those of any other race than the African; compel nobody to\r\nsettle in this State, but let every black reside in whatever part of the\r\nnation that pleases him; let this community while in a Territorial\r\ncondition, and also for a reasonable time after it has been admitted as a\r\nState, be faithfully superintended by the nation in order that republican\r\ngovernment be there preserved,--do these things, and there need be no fear\r\nthat the examples of Hayti and San Domingo, which were not so\r\nsuperintended, will be repeated. Nearly all of the American Indians,\r\nbecause of rigid adherence to their old customs and ways, were crushed by\r\nCaucasian rule. But the negro, wherever he comes in contact with a\r\nsuperior, shows a pliancy, a self-adaptability to new circumstances, to\r\nwhich no parallel has ever been suggested, so far as I know. If civilized\r\nself-government will but kindly keep him a while at its labor school where\r\nhe is to learn by doing, I am profoundly convinced that he will develop\r\ninto the very best of citizens. And I am also just as profoundly convinced\r\nthat if something like what I recommend is not done at a comparatively\r\nearly day, after some while, as there are now in America a few prosperous\r\nIndians and in New Zealand a few prosperous Maoris, we will have here and\r\nthere a few prosperous negroes; but the rest of them will either be\r\nconfirmed degenerates, or have gone no one will know whither. And Booker\r\nWashington, the moral exemplar of the day, rivalling Horace's\r\n\r\n  \"Iustum et tenacem propositi virum,\"\r\n\r\nas he resists the pernicious counsels of the overwhelming majority of\r\nnegroes and keeps to the wise and right course which they passionately\r\ncondemn; who is far more able and who has accomplished infinitely more of\r\ngood than Toussaint or Douglass--he will be a great hero statesman of a\r\ngreat cause lost. The historian of the future that has something like\r\nShakspeare's genius for contrast will make his glory and that of Calhoun\r\nmagnify each other by comparison.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing as to a negro State, which is the result of years of\r\nobservation and reflection, had all been written for some time when I fell\r\nin with the address of Bishop Holsey, mentioned above. It is the\r\nproposition of the address that a part of the United States should be\r\nassigned to the negroes. I add an abstract from the synopsis of his views\r\ngiven in the address:\r\n\r\n1. Negroes and whites \"are so distinct and dissimilar in racial traits,\r\ninstincts, and character, it is impossible for them to live together on\r\nequal terms of social and political relation, or on terms of equal\r\ncitizenship.\"\r\n\r\n2. The general government only has power to settle the problem, and it\r\nought to settle it.\r\n\r\n3. Separation of the negroes and whites \"is the most practicable, logical,\r\nand equitable solution of the problem.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Segregation and separation should be gradual ... and non-compulsory,\r\nso as not to injure ... labor, capital, and commerce ... where the negro\r\nis an important factor of production and consumption.\"\r\n\r\n5. The southern negroes should petition the president and congress \"for\r\nsuitable territory ... as ... equal citizens ... and not go out of their\r\ncountry to be exposed to doubtful experiment and foreign complications.\r\nAfro-Americans should remain in their own country, in the zone of\r\ngreatness, and in the latitude of progress.\"\r\n\r\n6. The government should, in effecting segregation, maintain \"civil order,\r\npeace, progress, and prosperity.\"\r\n\r\n7. The place for the negroes may be in the western public domain, such as\r\na part of the Indian Territory, New Mexico, or elsewhere in the west.\r\n\r\n8. No white person unless married to a negro, or a resident federal\r\nofficial, to be allowed citizenship in the negro State or Territory, but\r\nall citizens of the United States to be protected therein as in the other\r\nStates.[194]\r\n\r\n9. Only those of reputable character and some degree of education, and\r\nperhaps those possessed of a year's support, to become citizens. Criminals\r\nand undesirable persons to be kept out.\r\n\r\nIt was gratification extreme to me to find a prominent negro so much in\r\naccord with my long-cherished project. I hope there is a determination of\r\nthe mass of southern negroes thitherward, as seems to be indicated by the\r\nactivity both of Bishop Holsey and also by that of Bishop Turner. With\r\nnearly all of the negro writers and speakers now in the public eye\r\nupper-class sympathies are dominant. But Holsey, demanding a State in the\r\nunion, and Turner, putting his whole soul into immigration to Liberia, are\r\nactuated by lower-class sympathies. The others just mentioned really\r\nadvocate assimilation,--and at bottom, only the assimilation of the upper\r\nclass,--but these two are of far different and higher ambition. They are\r\npatriotic, and as true to their race as that famous heathen who rejected\r\nchristianity when told that it consigned his forefathers to perdition. He\r\ndeclared he would go to hell with his people and not to heaven without\r\nthem. The others are representative of only some five per cent, these two\r\nrepresent the ninety-five per cent--the real negroes. I never took to\r\nBishop Turner's proposal, for all of the ability with which he advocates\r\nit, because I want the negroes where our nation can foster and protect\r\ntheir State, it matters not what may be the resulting pains and expense. I\r\nhighly approve the earnestness of Bishop Holsey in objecting to\r\nexpatriation by the Afro-Americans.\r\n\r\nLet our negroes have their own State. That will be the fit culmination\r\nwhich was foreshadowed in their deserting the galleries assigned them in\r\nour churches and flocking to their own churches, immediately upon\r\nemancipation, and their effecting soon afterwards the removal of their\r\ncabins from the old site. Their masses have ever since been inclining\r\ntowards a community of their own by an internal impulsion in harmony with\r\nthe external white expulsion. The impulsion and the expulsion are each, as\r\nit seems to me, manifestations of the same all-powerful cosmic force.\r\n\r\nFurther, I would say a negro State makes a precedent for the world\r\nfederation. Each race that ought not to intermarry with others can\r\nflourish under its separate autonomy. Then loving brotherhood between\r\nwhite, yellow, red, and black people will bless all the earth. Whether the\r\nproneness of opposites to fancy each other, progressively going from the\r\nsmaller to the greater differences, will ultimately compound a universal\r\ncolor, no man can now tell.\r\n\r\nOf course some reader has exclaimed, \"Your proposal is absurdly\r\nchimerical.\" Is it indeed chimerical to demand of the great republic that\r\nit do its very highest duty? Suppose an ignorant, neglected child taken\r\nhome by a rich man, taught to work, the world of industry, with all of its\r\nprizes, kept in his sight, until he begins to cherish the hope that some\r\nday he can have a happy fireside of his own; suppose further that just as\r\nhe reaches the age of discretion the adopting father sets him where he may\r\nsee the fair world plainer and long for it more than ever, but so\r\ncompletely strips him of all means and opportunity that there is nothing\r\nfor the outcast but ignoble life and uncared-for death. How you would pity\r\nthe outcast! how you would curse the false father! I cannot believe that\r\nthe nation will prove such an unnatural parent to these its helpless and\r\nlovable children. It may be that some thousands of them, nay, some\r\nmillions, may be left to perish in their dire constraint. But when the\r\npeople fully understand, their consciences will awaken, and they will give\r\nthe American negro a bright house-warming.\r\n\r\nSuppose we do not give him his State, or suppose it will be long years\r\nbefore we give it to him, what do you say we are to do for him?\r\n\r\nWe must help Booker Washington and his co-laborers to the utmost. Grant\r\nthat they can snatch only a few brands from the burning. Is it not most\r\npraiseworthy to save even one? Further, I can never abandon the hope that\r\nthe nation will yet allot the negroes their State, even if to do it land\r\nmust be condemned on a large scale. When that fair day does dawn on\r\nAmerica, out of the scholars of these worthy teachers will come many a\r\ngood shepherd for the blacks in their new land. This may now be but a\r\nglimmering of hope. All the good must join in effort to enlarge and\r\nbrighten it.\r\n\r\nWe should not begrudge the higher education to the few in the upper class\r\nwho can get it. The negroes need teachers, preachers, writers, and others\r\nof the learned occupations.\r\n\r\nWe should impartially equalize the negro population to the white in common\r\nschool privileges. Both ought to have rational industrial training. The\r\nright primary education is just beginning to show itself. It will more and\r\nmore recognize what a prominent factor the hand has been in evolution.\r\nThink of the superiority of animals with, to those without, hands. What a\r\nhigh brain the elephant has made for himself by exercising his single\r\nhand; the polar bear kills the seal by throwing a block of ice; the 'coon\r\ngoes through his master's pockets for sweetmeats; the greater intelligence\r\nof the house-cat as compared with the average dog is due to long use of\r\nthe forepaws as rudimentary hands. Think of how we note humanity dawning\r\nin the monkey ever busy with his hands. Think of the importance of his\r\nhands to beginning man. With them he could gather fruits, rub fire-sticks\r\ntogether, make war-clubs, spears, fish-hooks, bow and arrows, bar up his\r\ncave door against beasts of prey, elevate his roosting place in a tree too\r\nhigh for night prowlers, and do all other vital things up the whole ascent\r\nto civilization. The steady enlargement of man's brain has been mainly\r\nbecause of his progressive use of his hands; for whenever a new thing was\r\nto be done his brain had first to acquire faculty of telling hands how to\r\ndo it. To train the hands is the true way to develop brain power. The\r\nnegroes in American slavery had risen far above the level of West African\r\nhand ability, and at emancipation they were prepared to go higher by leaps\r\nand bounds. Had they from that time steadily on been drafted off into\r\ntheir State, gradually, as Bishop Holsey suggests, and a tithe of the\r\nmillions which have since been lavished in giving them premature literacy\r\nand smattering of learning been applied in teaching their children\r\nhandicraft faculty and the best methods of labor, the promise for them now\r\nwould be satisfactory to their dearest friends. Somebody wisely advises,\r\nNever do the second thing first. Those who took charge of the negro when\r\nhe was freed tried to make him do the hundredth or thousandth thing first.\r\nInstead of patiently schooling him in handicraft and self-support until he\r\nwas really ready to take part in his own self-government, they made the\r\nignorant and inexperienced slave of yesterday a complete citizen, and\r\nplunged him up to his neck into politics and letters. What a baleful\r\n_hysteron proteron_ was this. The looming greatness of Booker Washington\r\nis that he teaches by his actions that the seeming advance was in fact\r\nprodigious retrogression, and he strives with all his might to draw the\r\nnegro backwards to his right beginning. Let us further his good work by\r\nincorporating the utmost practicable of his industrial training in our\r\ncommon school system for both whites and blacks. America has learned\r\nimportant military lessons from the redskin; and, as I am almost sure, she\r\nacted on his suggestion when she confederated the separate colonies. Let\r\nher now show similar good sense in permitting a negro to teach her the\r\ntrue system of education for the new times.[195]\r\n\r\nNow as to lynching. It is entirely wrong to conceive of a popular outbreak\r\nagainst one who has outraged a sacred woman as lawless. It is the furthest\r\npossible from that, being prompted by the most righteous indignation. The\r\nwretch has outlawed himself. Society can no more tolerate such an insult\r\nto its peace than it can permit a tiger to go at large. It is under no\r\nobligation to him whatever. It is the people dealing with him that should\r\nconcern us. We ought to keep them from brutalizing themselves and their\r\nchildren. We must put down lynching with gentle firmness. The first thing\r\nto do is to shorten the \"law's delay\" as much as possible. After the State\r\nhas made the enabling constitutional amendment, if such be necessary, let\r\nan act provide that whenever an alleged crime likely to excite popular\r\nviolence has been committed the governor select a judge to try and finally\r\ndispose of the case, three days only, say, being allowed for motion for\r\nnew trial or taking direct bill of exceptions; both the supreme court and\r\nthe court below to proceed as fast as may be through all stages until\r\nacquittal or execution. Let the governor earnestly ask for some such\r\nmeasure, and let him also, after he gets it, impressively appeal to the\r\npeople to assist in enforcing the law. With this preparation, more than\r\nninety per cent of the whites will approve the most decided action of the\r\nmilitary protecting prisoners, if that be necessary. Just at this time\r\n(September 27, 1904) there is a very decided manifestation of\r\nanti-lynching public opinion in the south. We should strike while the iron\r\nis hot, and bring it about that the law itself make quick riddance of the\r\nravisher. It should be a spur to us that the party opposed in politics to\r\nthe great majority of southerners finds much support and help from every\r\nlynching in this section. Why should we play into its hands?\r\n\r\nThe last thing that I have to say is that the south ought to invite\r\nimmigrants only of white blood. We want no settlers from whose\r\nintermarriage mongrels would spring. All Europeans should receive\r\nwelcome--the Germans perhaps the warmest. But in my judgment those that\r\nwill most advantage us are the truckmen, growers of the smaller and larger\r\nfruits, grass, grain, and stock farmers, manufacturers, miners, builders,\r\ncontractors, business men, and skilled laborers, of the north. It looks\r\nnow as if the cotton mills of England as well as of the north would be\r\nprofited by coming to us; and it also seems probable that there will be\r\nfor many years so great a demand for our cotton that the worn-out soil of\r\nthe older parts of the lower south must be restored to more than virgin\r\nrichness by the method which Dr. Moore has patented and made a gift of to\r\nthe nation, or some other intensive culture; and that there must be\r\nconsequently great multiplication of southern mill-operatives and\r\nagricultural workers in the near future. Recall what we have said in the\r\nlast chapter as to the future promise of the section. Every day the south\r\nby disclosing some new opportunity cogently makes new invitation to\r\nimmigrants. It is the interest as well as the duty of the nation to remove\r\nthe great clog upon development of the south. That clog is the presence of\r\nsome millions of unassimilable negroes in the section. It is also the best\r\ninterest and the highest duty of the nation to segregate these negroes\r\ninto a territory of their own. As Bishop Holsey says, and what I believe\r\nwith my whole soul, \"The union of the States will never be fully and\r\nperfectly recemented with tenacious integrity until black Ham and white\r\nJapheth dwell together in separate tents.\"[196]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must add an epilogue to these chapters on the race question as I did to\r\nthat on Toombs.\r\n\r\nBrothers and sisters of the north, you should learn why there is a solid\r\nsouth. There is but one cause. It is the menace to the whites from the\r\npolitical power given the negroes by the fifteenth amendment. There is\r\nnothing in your section--in its past or its present--from which I can\r\nillustrate to you the gravity of this menace to us. In not one of your\r\nStates are there ignorant negroes in so great a number that, by combining\r\nwith the debased whites, they can make for it such a constitution and laws\r\nand set up such authorities as they please. We, your brothers and sisters\r\nof the south, have lived under the rule of this foulest of coalitions. We\r\nknow from actual experience how it plunders and preys upon honest workers,\r\nproducers, and property owners; how it licenses and fosters crime. In my\r\nown State, from the first day that a governor, elected by fiat voters and\r\nex-whites, as we called the latter, was inaugurated, until we virtually\r\nrestored the supremacy of our race by carrying the three days' election in\r\nDecember, 1870, fifty dollars would get a pardon for the greatest offence,\r\nand robberies, burglaries, horse-stealing, and the like each went free for\r\na much smaller sum. Is it forgotten that the negro speaker was voted one\r\nthousand dollars by a South Carolina legislature, ostensibly as extra\r\ncompensation for unusual services, but really of purpose to reimburse him\r\nfor a bet lost upon a horse race? Why, the foremost of our people in\r\nvirtue, wisdom, and patriotism were agreed that these sordid tyrannies\r\nshould be subverted at once and at any cost to ourselves. The emergency\r\njustified any practice, device, or stratagem at the polls by which we\r\ncould defend our homes, families, and subsistence against assassins of the\r\npublic peace, wholesale robbers of the people, and instigators and\r\nprotectors of every crime. It justified the shotgun and six-shooter in\r\npolitics just as legitimate war justifies the musket in the hands of the\r\nsoldier. It called forth most righteously the Ku-Klux. That spontaneous\r\nresistance finds a close parallel in the battles of Lexington and Bunker\r\nHill, fought before American independence was declared. But the Ku-Klux\r\nfought for something still dearer than the dear cause for which our\r\nforefathers bled in the two battles just mentioned. Had the latter failed\r\nin the war they had thus begun, their children and people would\r\nnevertheless have had such good government as England is now giving the\r\ndefeated Boers; but had the southern whites failed in their defence, their\r\nland would have for long years been befouled like Hayti, and those who had\r\nnot been slaughtered unspeakably degraded. I think that all our countrymen\r\nwho so rightfully eulogize the heroes of Lexington and Bunker Hill should\r\nalso learn to give the greater praise to the southern heroes whose\r\nindomitable spirit routed the madmen that, with all the power of the\r\nfederal government in their hands, tried their best to give the section\r\nover to negro rulers. Brothers and sisters, \"picture it, think of it,\"\r\nuntil you can fully understand that hour of our trial. All my northern\r\nacquaintances who have resided in the south for several years--they are\r\nmany--come to look at the subject just as the natives do. A candid and\r\nhonest settler from Vermont has told me how he was made to change his\r\nmind. Conversing with a southerner, he had reprehended the different ways\r\nin which the negro's ballot had been rendered nugatory. The other replied,\r\n\"Suppose that there was an incursion of Indians given suffrage into your\r\nState in such a mass as to make them seventy-five per cent of all the\r\nvoters, wouldn't you whites in some way manage either to outvote or\r\noutcount them!\" The Vermonter answered in the affirmative. We had to\r\ndeliver ourselves. We used the only means at our command.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be thought of that these negro governments be endured, even\r\nif tempered by the Ku-Klux, for government is in its nature lasting and\r\npermanent while the other was only temporary. They would have gradually\r\ngathered strength. Then there would have been rapid enrichment of a few\r\nexceptional negroes and rapid expulsion of the whites impoverished by\r\nemancipation, from all their little that was left. And then, the leading\r\nnegroes desiring nothing else so much, there would have come many white\r\nmen and women, each one willing to climb out of the depths of want by\r\nintermarriage with a prosperous negro. Who can predict what would have\r\nbeen the future of mongrelism thus beginning? We of the south are most\r\nconscientiously solid against what we know from actual trial to be the\r\nworst and most corrupting of all government; and we are still more solid\r\nagainst everything that tends to promote amalgamation. Can you blame us\r\nfor standing in serried phalanx by white domination and against the\r\nmisrule exampled in the early years of reconstruction, and for our own\r\nuncontaminated white blood and against fusion with the negro? We must be\r\nsolid in the face of these dangers, and as long as they are threatened by\r\nthe presence of millions of negroes in our midst. There is no other\r\nsolidity in the south. In all matters of the locality republicans and\r\ndemocrats count alike. When one offers to vote in the primary, if his name\r\nis on the registry list, and he appears on inspection to be white, his\r\nvote is accepted; and he generally casts that vote, not for the interest\r\nof a political party, but for that of the public. The triumphant election\r\nin November, 1904, of independents or democrats, in four northern States\r\nwhich at the same time went for Mr. Roosevelt, indicates solidity for the\r\ntrue local welfare of the people as against the behests of party. So what\r\nthe white primary has produced in the south, has commenced in the north.\r\nAnd the result in Missouri, voting for Roosevelt, republican, and Folk,\r\ndemocrat, shows that what we may call federal independentism has commenced\r\nin the south. This will spread as the people learn it does not hurt them\r\nto split their tickets while voting upon national questions, if they but\r\nmaintain their solidity while voting upon State or municipal.\r\n\r\nNow may I be allowed some decided words, most kindly and inoffensively\r\nspoken, as to appointing negroes to federal offices in the south. It is no\r\nsound argument for it that now and then some negro may have been appointed\r\nin a northern community which manifested no opposition. Consider the case\r\nof Mr. William H. Lewis, a negro lately made assistant district attorney\r\nin Boston by Mr. Roosevelt. He is a Harvard graduate, was captain of the\r\nHarvard eleven while in college, had represented Cambridge in the\r\nMassachusetts legislature, and the community was not at all averse to his\r\nappointment.[197] Therefore when it was made there was no disregard of the\r\nwishes and feelings of Boston and the regions adjoining. But when a negro\r\nis given office in the south, it is felt by all the community to be an\r\ninsult. Would President Roosevelt cram the appointment of a white down the\r\nthroats of a northern community in which all the best citizens protested\r\nagainst it? Would he not confess to himself that the wishes and feelings\r\nof these good people ought to be respected, even if he considered them\r\nfoolish and unreasonable? It seems to me that he would, and that he would\r\nfind for the place somebody else in his party acceptable to the locality.\r\nWhy should he not do the like when his southern brothers and sisters who\r\nhave such convincing reasons against the encouragement of negroes in their\r\npolitics, protest unanimously against his filling an office in their midst\r\nwith a negro? Will he snub them because a negro has more sacred right than\r\na white? Is that what he means by keeping open the door of hope and\r\nopportunity? Or will he snub them because enough of punishment has not yet\r\nbeen given them, and because the south is still a province or dependency\r\non which he is justified in quartering his partisans and pets without\r\nregard to the feelings and wishes of all the better inhabitants?\r\n\r\nBrothers and sisters of the north, I cannot believe that any one of you\r\nwho impartially considers the subject, would ever approve appointing even\r\nthe most competent and deserving negro to a southern office in the teeth\r\nof universal objection by the whites of the community.\r\n\r\nMy last word is to implore every honest one in the country to lay aside\r\nall prejudice and master the southern situation before judging. Whoever\r\ndoes this, whoever will accurately place himself in the shoes of a good\r\nsouthern citizen, will, I most firmly believe, approve the attitude of the\r\nsouth, with his whole heart and soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE OLD AND NEW SOUTH, a Centennial article for the International Review,\r\nafterwards corrected and published separately. New York: A. S. Barnes &\r\nCo. 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe approach of the Centennial Celebration is not hailed in the south with\r\nthe demonstrative joy of the north. It would be out of taste to expect\r\nthat the former should appear to triumph greatly over the life of the\r\nnation preserved at the cost of her recent overthrow. Her late antagonist\r\ncan rejoice in a vast and happy population, great material prosperity, and\r\nthe fresh fame of a world-renowned success. It is meet, while remembering\r\nshe has so lately saved the union by her stupendous armipotence, that the\r\nnorth should exult as a people never did before. The south has been made\r\nto feel the pangs of a sudden impoverishment and the incalculable\r\ndiscomfort of complete economical unsettlement; and she has not learned\r\nthe new lessons which she must learn to become self-sustaining and\r\nprogressive. But her earnest spirits, doing painfully the slow task of\r\nrepairing lost fortunes; seeking after the system proper to succeed\r\nplanting; striving to make their homes pleasant again and to give their\r\nchildren a fair hope in the land,--these intent workers, who are most of\r\nthem scarred confederate veterans, even if they will not say it loudly,\r\nhave come around to hold in steadfast faith that it is far better the Blue\r\nCross fell, and the American union stands forever unchallengeable\r\nhereafter. And they have brought with them the great mass of their people.\r\nThey cannot joy so happily as the north, but they have a warm welcome for\r\nthe Great Commemoration. For they see that the evils which followed as the\r\nscourge of defeat are soon to pass away, while the fall of slavery and\r\nthe failure of secession are to prove greater and greater blessings as\r\nyears roll on.\r\n\r\nAnd so the time has come for a southerner calmly to discuss the past,\r\npresent, and future of the south. He has no use for the methods of popular\r\nand unscientific politics, wherein everything is blamed or applauded as\r\nbeing the result of party measures. The intentions and motives of the\r\nactors, on both sides of the late strife, will give but proximate\r\nexplanations. How the two sections became, to use the fine phrase of Von\r\nHolst, economically contrasted; how the southern people and their\r\nrepresentative politicians were bred, under their circumstances, into\r\nopposition to the union; and how the northern people and their\r\nrepresentative politicians were bred, under widely different\r\ncircumstances, into love of the union; how the long clashing in politics\r\nculminated in civil war; how the south was utterly crushed and her whole\r\nindustrial system destroyed; how she slowly re-erects herself into a new\r\ncondition better than the old,--the ultimate solution of these questions\r\ncan only be found by discussing them in the light of those laws of\r\ndevelopment which give every community a policy suited to what it discerns\r\nto be its best interest. These laws are of far more importance than the\r\npolitician, who is but their creature. Leaving to others to fight over the\r\nold struggles of the political arena and bandy hard words with one\r\nanother, we will try to discuss our subject in the manner we have\r\nindicated to be appropriate.\r\n\r\nTo understand the present and future, we must first understand the past.\r\nTo understand the New south, we must first understand the Old south, the\r\ndistinguishing feature of which was negro slavery. Mr. Stephens, then\r\nVice-President of the southern confederacy, in an address to a large\r\nassembly in Savannah, in March, 1861, said of the new government: \"Its\r\nfoundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth, that\r\nthe negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery--subordination to\r\nthe superior race--is his natural and normal condition.\" There is no doubt\r\nslavery was the corner-stone of southern society; and when it was removed,\r\nfour years later, a thorough disintegration of the whole fabric was the\r\nlogical result.\r\n\r\nWhen our country was first settled, the southern regions were far more\r\nattractive in soil and climate; and their other natural\r\nresources--minerals, good harbors, navigable streams, water-power idling\r\neverywhere, to mention no more--were equal to those of the other section.\r\nThe subsequent advancement of the north has been so rapid as to excite the\r\nwonder of the world; while it is said by us of the south, jesting upon our\r\nworn-out and exhausted land, that we have done worse for the country than\r\nthe Indians before us, who stayed here many centuries and yet left the\r\nsoil as good as they found it.\r\n\r\nThe plantation system was the great barrier to southern progress. From its\r\nfirst historical appearance, among the Carthaginians, from whom the Romans\r\nseem to have derived it, this rude and wholesale method of farming has\r\nrested on slaveholding. Its workings have been similar everywhere. In\r\nItaly, under the Roman republic, absorbing the petty holdings, it drove\r\nout the small farmer; it destroyed the former respect for trades and\r\nhandicrafts, and brought them into disfavor; it prevented the development\r\nof the industrial arts; it created a non-reciprocal commerce. Centuries\r\nlater, it did the same things in our southern States.\r\n\r\nA sketch of the leading features and results of the plantation system, as\r\nit existed in America, is our proper beginning.\r\n\r\nThe driver, as the negro foreman was called, was not very common in the\r\nsouth, and was generally under the superintendence of the overseer. Could\r\nthe planters have made a good overseer of the driver, of course they would\r\nhave consulted their interest, and reproduced the ancient slave-steward of\r\nRome. Slaveholders keep their slaves under careful surveillance, but they\r\ndo not usually overlook them in person. It is not often that a master\r\nengages in an employment which brings him into daily and intimate contact\r\nwith the lowest orders, and which he instinctively feels to be degrading.\r\nThe planter could have neither his first choice, which would have been a\r\nslave overseer, nor his second choice, a superintendent from his own rank\r\nin society; and so, as the next best thing, he took as overseer a white\r\nhireling from the non-slaveholding class. The tillage of the fields was\r\nthus intrusted to the overseers, who were, for the most part, men of\r\nlittle education and business skill, and who had no interest in their\r\nemployment except to draw its wages. Thus the foremost, if not the only,\r\nsouthern industry was managed by incompetent and careless agents.\r\n\r\nThe Roman master, in the later days of the republic, having always vast\r\nmarkets open to him, shunned the expense of providing for women and\r\nchildren, and bought new slaves instead of breeding them; but the closing\r\nof the African slave-trade, and the softer hearts and manners of modern\r\ntimes, led our planters, at last, to rely on propagation as their only\r\nsource of supply. The negroes were, therefore, well cared for, and, in a\r\ngenial clime, increased rapidly. This increase, however, did not keep pace\r\nwith the increasing demand for southern products, and so the market value\r\nof the slave rose rapidly. To the Roman slaveholder, land was almost\r\neverything, and his rustic slaves nothing; to the southerner, the slaves\r\nwere almost everything, and the land nothing. There was no careful\r\ncultivation of the soil, no judicious rotation of crops, and no adequate\r\nsystem of fertilization. Southern husbandry was, for the most part, a\r\nreckless pillage of the bounty of nature. The planter became possessed\r\nwith a roving spirit, and was continually seeking \"fresh land,\" as virgin\r\nsoil was termed. In the older sections, where there was most stability,\r\nthe best farming consisted in judiciously eking out the natural fertility\r\nof the fields, and when that was exhausted, in leaving them to recuperate\r\nby years of rest. Thus a given working force required, year by year, a\r\ngreater and greater allowance of land, and the plantations became steadily\r\nlarger, the small farmer retiring, and the white population becoming\r\ncontinually less. Many of these older sections turned, from being\r\nagricultural communities, into nurseries, rearing slaves for the younger\r\nStates where virgin soil was abundant. The fertile lands of the new\r\nsettlements, by yielding bountiful crops, gave fresh impulse to the\r\nplantation system, and here the small holdings were absorbed more rapidly\r\nthan they had been in the older States. The southern slaves, regarded as\r\nproperty, were the most desirable investment open to the generality of\r\npeople that has ever been known. They were patient, tractable, and\r\nsubmissive, and never revolted in combined insurrections, as did the\r\nslaves of antiquity. Their labor was richly remunerative; their market\r\nvalue was constantly rising; they were everywhere more easily convertible\r\ninto money than the best securities; and their natural increase was so\r\nrapid that a part of it could be squandered by a shiftless owner every\r\nyear to make both ends meet, and he still be left enough of accumulation\r\nto enrich him steadily. And so the plantation, or rather the slave, system\r\nswallowed up everything else.\r\n\r\nThere were no distinct industrial classes. There were negro blacksmiths,\r\nnegro carpenters, negro shoemakers, etc., all over the land, but they were\r\nmere appendages to the plantations, and far inferior in capacity and skill\r\nto the artisan slaves of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the south was non-reciprocal. She traded raw produce for\r\nmanufactures which she should have made herself, or which she should have\r\ngot in exchange for manufactures of her own. The over-mastering energy of\r\nslave property, dissolving, as it were, all things into itself, kept her\r\nfrom that development of trades, manufactories, and industrial arts which\r\nis the solid and unprecedented progress, and far more durable wealth, of\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nThere were a few exceptions in the way of restorative agriculture, and of\r\ndiversified investments of capital in railways, manufactories, inland\r\nnavigation, and mercantile enterprises. All along the northern border\r\nthere were efforts to let go slavery, and non-slave industry was slowly\r\nemerging in a few places; but these things were as dust in the balances.\r\nThe slave system was rooted in the best portions of the land, and nearly\r\nall of the productive wealth of the south was in, or dependent upon,\r\nplanting. Implacable enemies of slavery were rapidly increasing in numbers\r\nand power, but she continued blindly sacrificing everything to rear\r\nnegroes. When actual emancipation came--that nipping May frost--the south\r\nshowed, on a gigantic scale, in her poverty and one solitary and\r\nportentously dried-up source of wealth, a parallel to Ireland, smitten\r\nwith famine by the sudden failure of her only supply of food. When the\r\ncharity of the world and the returning bounty of nature had again fed the\r\nGreen Isle, everything fell back into the old track, and she could go on\r\nsmoothly as before. But not so with the south: her wealth has fled; her\r\noccupation, the plantation system, is gone; and she must, for a\r\ngeneration, grope painfully in the dark, trying novel ways of subsisting,\r\nenduring want and many failures, before finding again the light of plenty\r\nand comfort.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the planter have changed. The management of a farm is not\r\nlike that of a plantation, and one skilled in the management of slaves is\r\nnot necessarily efficient in the directing of freedmen. Many other\r\ncountries have been impoverished by wars; but is not this instantaneous\r\nand almost complete taking away of a great people's mode of living unique\r\nin history? The most resolute secessionist would have lost heart and put\r\nup his sword, could he have seen, before the war commenced, how easily the\r\nsolitary prop of southern wealth and comfort could be overturned, to be\r\nset up no more. But in none of the ablest of the anti-secession arguments\r\nof 1860 were the consequences of defeat predicted.\r\n\r\nSome portions of our country have been built up into a high degree of\r\nprosperity by a steady influx of foreign settlers. How much has been added\r\nto the power and wealth of the northern States by the immigration from the\r\nold lands of those who, when first they come, can do no more than subsist\r\nthemselves by their own industry, almost defies computation. How the force\r\nof the preponderant population of the north pressed upon the south during\r\nthe war, and at last crushed her down! Slavery repelled the free immigrant\r\nfrom the south, and he went elsewhere with his power to enrich and defend.\r\n\r\nThe uniform and rapid advancement of civilization is mainly due to the\r\nstruggle of the poor to better their condition. These efforts result in\r\ncomplex division of labor, accumulation of wealth, and better than these,\r\nin the production of a great population engaged in diversified industries.\r\nIn such a population, improving year by year in business habits, consists\r\nthe strength of a nation. The slave had no hope of rising, and the system\r\nof which he was a part repelled free workingmen, and thus the south lost\r\nthe benign emulation and energy of a lower class. The ancient slaves were\r\nnot alone rural laborers and domestic servants, as were those of the\r\nsouth. The former, being of kindred blood with their masters and near\r\ntheir level in natural capacity, were initiated in the various industries,\r\nsome of which flourished greatly under their management. Though the slaves\r\nof old were very degraded, they were not as low and grovelling as those of\r\nour day. Enfranchisement was common; and, in a few generations afterwards,\r\nthe descendants of the freedman were indistinguishable amid the body of\r\nfree citizens. The ancient states were not, therefore, prevented by\r\nslavery from having advanced and diversified industries, nor were they\r\ndenied the impulse of a possible rising from the lower to the higher\r\nclasses. But the American slave was of the remotest race, far below his\r\nmaster in development, and the horror of receiving him into the body of\r\nfree citizens grew continually stronger. The law discouraged manumission,\r\nand frowned upon the increase of freedmen. Thus, the African slavery of\r\nthe south was the most hopeless form of servitude the civilized world has\r\never seen; and, by preventing the formation of a great class of freemen,\r\nengaged in respectable industry, it killed the very roots of social\r\nprogress. These influences of slavery, so repugnant to American ideas,\r\nwill be more vividly seen and understood in the answer to the question,\r\nWhat would have been the present condition of the south had it not been\r\nfor slavery? Undoubtedly her land would have smiled with a fertility\r\nricher than the endowment of nature; her industrial arts would, ere this\r\ntime, have branched out into multifarious activity; her own ships would\r\nhave been carrying her produce and manufactures abroad; and, as the crown\r\nof all, she would have had a teeming population of workers, whose\r\neducation in the methods of self-support would have been the assurance of\r\nunlimited future advancement. In brief, in all the elements of the\r\ngreatness of a community, the south might now have equalled, if not\r\nexcelled, the north.\r\n\r\nBut there are some other effects of slavery to be noted before the outline\r\nof the Old south can be clearly and fully drawn.\r\n\r\nAmong the planters, costly and liberal instruction was given to a few of\r\nthose who were to adorn places of leisured ease, or to fill the necessary\r\nprofessions and public positions; but, in the midst of the sparse and\r\nshifting rural population, there could not be that devotion to the\r\neducation of all, which is one of the most conspicuous glories of the\r\nnorthern States.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the sparseness of the planters and their roving habits,\r\nthere was not that subdivision of different portions of the counties into\r\nsmall self-governing wards, which Jefferson so fondly desired. He said of\r\nthe New England townships, that they had \"proved themselves the wisest\r\ninvention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of\r\nself-government, and for its preservation.\" He also said that he\r\nconsidered the continuance of republican government as absolutely hanging\r\non two hooks, to wit, \"the public education, and the subdivision into\r\nwards.\" This government of every vicinage in its home affairs by itself,\r\nas originated in New England, and is now spread far and wide throughout\r\nthe northern States, is the most beneficent achievement of American\r\ndemocracy. By this coercion of the citizen to participate in the constant\r\nadministration of public matters directly concerning his interests,\r\nself-government becomes, as it should be, the business of everybody, and\r\neverybody is compulsorily educated in the best of all learning for the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe finale of slavery remains to be told. As opposition to it increased\r\nfrom without, the south became more and more closely united. She honestly\r\nbelieved that wanton intermeddlers were attacking her dearest rights. The\r\nsteady and continually strengthening warfare against slavery, and her\r\ncontinuous and earnest defence of it, began--it is impossible to determine\r\nprecisely when--to knit her into a nationality of her own. He who\r\nunderstands what Mr. Bagehot calls \"nation-making\" will discover, in the\r\npast history of the south, if he looks attentively, many signs of this\r\ntendency, which steadily progressed unperceived on her part, and still\r\nmore so on the part of the north, until the south began to coalesce into a\r\nnation as compact as her scattered and random elements would permit. The\r\nlong advocacy and support of slavery in the political arena had fevered\r\nher whole people, and finally, under these promptings to a national life,\r\npolitics absorbed nearly all of her intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nThere is a striking parallel between this sustained effort of the south\r\nand the struggle of Ireland, when the latter, for the fifty years ending\r\nwith the advent of the present century, was arrayed against the British,\r\nin their encroachments upon her independent government. During this\r\nhalf-century, Ireland maintained that she was an independent integral part\r\nof the British Empire, just as Virginia contended that she was a sovereign\r\nin the federation of States. Ireland, like a southern State, challenged\r\nevery seeming interference, by the general government, in her local\r\naffairs; and the claims put forth, in each instance, were inexorably\r\ncontested by an adverse government, claiming supremacy and supported by\r\nsuperiority of power. Both were on the eve of revolutionary secession\r\nwithout knowing it. The results in Ireland and the south were similar:\r\nthere was but one intellectual activity, namely, politics. The memory of\r\nall Irishmen of that time not forgotten--and many of their names are\r\nfamiliar words--is nothing but resistance to English aggression. Even\r\nCurran, Ireland's great forensic advocate, made his world-wide fame in\r\ndefending Irishmen against the prosecutions of the British ministry. It\r\nwas much the same at the south in the period antecedent to the civil war.\r\nShe had neither literature nor science; but she had statesmen and\r\nadvocates, who will be remembered as long as her soldiers and generals.\r\n\r\nThe national germ had long been growing below the surface, in darkness,\r\nand at last it burst into view, and shot up into a body of amazing\r\nproportions. There was not the birth of a new nation at Montgomery in\r\n1861; only the majority of this vigorous young member of the family of\r\nnations was there proclaimed. But, for all of the eloquence of its orators\r\nand the virtue and bravery of its people, it was, as compared with its\r\nadversary, in raw and untutored nonage, and the great disaster that befell\r\nfour years afterwards was then preordained. It was her unshunnable fate\r\nthat she should be denationalized on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe late war was a conflict between implacable enemies. Each belligerent,\r\nstanding up for national life, was resistlessly coerced to fight to the\r\nlast. Neither can be blamed. The past may be taxed with lack of wisdom. It\r\nmay be that as Scotland and, more lately, Ireland have been peacefully\r\ndenationalized, a preventive, anticipating the dreadful event of war,\r\nmight years before have been devised by statesmanly forecast. The actual\r\ncombatants--the southerner fighting for the confederacy, and the northern\r\nsoldier bearing up the flag of the union--were equals in manhood and\r\nvirtue. The survivors, federal and confederate, at last see this, and\r\ntherefore they go in company to decorate alike the graves of the dead of\r\nboth armies.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all these evils--the backwardness and stationariness of the\r\nsouth; a wasteful husbandry, without other industries; the instability of\r\nher wealth; her want of a great class of freemen engaged in the different\r\narts; her barbarically simple social structure; her neglect of common\r\nschools; the absorption of all her intellectual energies in feverish and\r\nrevolutionary politics; and, finally, secession and the reddened ground of\r\na thousand battle-fields--was slavery. It is gone. The malignant cancer,\r\ninvolving, as it seemed, every vital and menacing hideous and loathsome\r\ndeath, was plucked out by the roots; and after a ten years' struggle of\r\nnature, we see the body politic slowly but surely reviving to a health and\r\nsoundness never known before.\r\n\r\nHere we find the dividing line between the Old and the New south. The\r\nformer ended, and the latter began, with the giving of freedom to the\r\nnegroes--an event which will prove in the future to have been an\r\nemancipation even more beneficial to master than to slave. Immunity from\r\nall the evils of slavery which we have catalogued will distinguish the\r\nNew south from the Old.[198]\r\n\r\nThe sudden impoverishment of the southern people, and the unlooked-for\r\nchange in their ways of living and thinking, had they occurred in the most\r\npeaceful times, and been followed with the best of government, would have\r\nproduced a profound shock and a long paralysis. But the bitterness of\r\nsubjugation, and the mistake of needlessly offensive and goading\r\ngovernment, with harsh reconstructive measures, have prolonged the\r\nlethargy. And yet the American union shows benignly in the present\r\ncondition and promised future of the section. The ten years since\r\nemancipation are instructive. Slowly has the New south been disentangling\r\nherself from the debris of the Old, and she has emerged far enough to\r\nenable us to perceive that a better era has commenced. Much has been lost,\r\nbut more has been saved. All the germs of true wealth and power and the\r\nsolid well-being of a community have survived; and solace for the past and\r\nearnest of a great future may be found in the fact that she has reached at\r\nlast, and for the first time, a position in which she can develop these\r\nelements, free from the suffocating hindrances of former days. We may now\r\nproperly inquire, What of the past does the south retain, and in what will\r\nconsist her future progress?\r\n\r\nShe retains her genial climate, her kindly soil, and her many natural\r\nresources. If the peace of the American union is assured, as everything\r\nnow graciously promises, these natural advantages will, in a few\r\ngenerations, far more than compensate for all her losses, and ultimately\r\nplace her in the very van of progress.\r\n\r\nThe best inheritance of the New from the Old south is the southern people.\r\nWe have seen how slavery checked industrial development, and how many of\r\nits other effects were hurtful. After allowing fully for all these, there\r\nwill be found a great residuum of progressive energy, of intellectual\r\nstrength, and of moral worth in the people of the southern States. They\r\nneed not fear a comparison, in these respects, with the most enlightened\r\ncommunities. Great men, like Washington, Jefferson, Calhoun, Jackson, and\r\nLee; political and military heroes, judges, lawyers, and orators, such as\r\nthe south has given birth to, in unbroken succession,--are the\r\nunmistakable signs of a great people.\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of the confederate armies have given proof that the men\r\nof the south must be classed, in all the elements of complete character,\r\nwith the best that the world has ever seen. Crime was so infrequent that a\r\nsingle morning of the term of a rural court, before the war, nearly always\r\nsufficed to dispose of every indictment; there was little want or\r\npauperism; virtue was everywhere the rule in private life, and there was\r\nseldom even the suspicion of corruption in government or the\r\nadministration of justice. The history of this people since the war shows\r\nthat they are possessed of the best Anglo-Saxon mettle. They are slowly\r\nbeginning to thrive wherever they have been left to govern themselves, in\r\nspite of the complete industrial revolution, the loss of property, and\r\nchange of occupation, of which we have written. And in many places, where\r\nreconstruction has been harshest, and negro misrule yet prevails, the\r\nwhites have developed an unlooked-for self-maintaining capacity, and have\r\ndemonstrated that even there must be the eventual predominance of\r\nintelligence and virtue, should \"natural selection\" alone work to secure\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe southern people have learned much wisdom in the last ten years. Their\r\nheavy vote in 1872 for Horace Greeley--a man to whom a foreigner would\r\nhave supposed them unappeasably hostile--if there was nothing else, would\r\nalone suffice to show that they are rapidly laying aside all hindrances to\r\nprogress. And now that slavery is gone and she has so quickly conquered\r\nthe animosities of the war, the south may be likened to a capable and\r\nenergetic young man, who, having failed, as the result of inevitable\r\nmisfortune, in a wrongly-chosen business, has been relieved of all\r\nembarrassments and has entered upon his proper calling. More may\r\nreasonably be expected of such a man than of one more prosperous who has\r\nnot had the like discipline.\r\n\r\nAs her nationalizing tendency has been destroyed by the removal of\r\nslavery, and as her future must necessarily be shaped by union influences,\r\nshe will heartily embrace the political creed of the union. The doctrine\r\nof the sovereignty of the States, which was advocated with very great\r\nability by many of the southern statesmen--notably by Calhoun, in his\r\nspeeches in congress, and in his \"Discourse on the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States,\" and with still more taking effect by Mr. Stephens in his\r\n\"Constitutional View of the War between the States,\"--has now no disciples\r\nat the south. General Logan gave expression to the prevailing creed of the\r\npresent, when he said, at a recent reunion of former confederate\r\ncompanions:\r\n\r\n    \"In considering, then, the future of the south, there is one fact\r\n    suggested at the outset which has been demonstrated to us by the logic\r\n    of events. It is, that under the operation of causes, which, although\r\n    unseen at the time, appear now to have been inevitable in their\r\n    results, a vast _social organism_ has been developed, and is now so\r\n    far advanced in its growth as a _national body politic_, and no longer\r\n    a mere aggregation of States, that _unity_ is a necessity of its\r\n    further development. In reviewing the past, we can now clearly see\r\n    that this national organism has been _gradually developed_; and, while\r\n    many seek by various theories to account for the failure of the\r\n    confederacy, the result may be regarded as the necessary consequence\r\n    of those laws of development under which this social organism--the\r\n    United States--was being evolved.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the south is pleased to observe that there are no genuine signs of too\r\nmuch centralization. On the contrary, the town system is destined to\r\nspread fast and far; and the increase of local option laws; the splitting\r\nof larger into smaller counties; the strengthening tendency to submit\r\nconstitutions and many legislative acts to voters; the greater disposition\r\noften to amend the State constitutions in the interests of progress; the\r\nvigorous growth in each State of its own body of laws; the rapid\r\nmultiplication of towns and cities, with governments peculiar to each, are\r\nsome of the many convincing proofs that local self-government is\r\nincreasing and flourishing. Of the last particular Judge Dillon says:\r\n\r\n    \"We have popularized and made use of municipal institutions to such an\r\n    extent as to constitute one of the most striking features of our\r\n    government. It owes to them, indeed, in a great degree, its\r\n    decentralized character. When the English Municipal Corporations\r\n    Reform Act of 1835, was passed, there were, in England and Wales,\r\n    excluding London, only two hundred and forty-six places exercising\r\n    municipal functions; and their aggregate population did not exceed two\r\n    millions of people. In this country, our municipal corporations are\r\n    numbered by thousands, and the inhabitants subjected to their rule, by\r\n    millions.\"\r\n\r\nReflecting southerners see, in the present condition of the southern\r\nStates, the very strongest possible guaranty that the true balance\r\nbetween national cohesion and local freedom is to be preserved. They see\r\nthat the happy equilibrium is of a character so permanent and stable as to\r\nhave survived the convulsion of civil war. The southern States are not\r\nheld as conquered provinces. On the contrary, aside from the abolition of\r\nslavery and the fundamental legislation securing to the old slaves the\r\nfull fruition of their freedom, there has been no perceptible change in\r\nthe relations of these States to the United States.\r\n\r\nSurely, to the student of history, wherein _vae victis!_ is written on\r\nevery page, this fact has wonderful significance. It recommends the\r\nAmerican form of government to the rest of the world as the incoming of\r\nthe new stage of civilization, wherein oppression and war shall become\r\nunknown. However long contending armies may devour populations and\r\nparalyze industry elsewhere, we are assured that war-sick America will\r\nfight with herself no more. This assurance repays the south a thousand\r\nfold for all that she has lost and endured.\r\n\r\nThe great economical interest of the south is her agriculture; and in this\r\nindustry, as well as among those who conduct it, a constant transition has\r\nbeen taking place during the ten years since emancipation. There is a\r\nmelancholy change in the homes of landholders from the case and comfort of\r\n_ante bellum_ days. The neat inclosures have fallen; the pleasant grounds\r\nand the flower-gardens, once so trim and flourishing, are a waste; all the\r\nold smiles and adornments are gone. Change at home is accompanied by still\r\ngreater change without. The negroes--and they constitute the great bulk of\r\nthe laboring population--tend to become a tenantry, cultivating the land,\r\nin some instances, for a part of the produce, but oftener for a fixed sum\r\nof money. Many of these realize from their labors little more than enough\r\nto pay a moderate rent. Others work for wages, either in money or in some\r\nportion of the crop made by their labor. As the negroes are scarce, and\r\ntheir labor so important, they have often, directly or indirectly, a voice\r\nin the area of land cultivated, the mode of cultivation, and the kind of\r\ncrop raised. The result, in many places, is retrogression. The face of\r\nthe country is much altered. Only a small part of the land, as compared\r\nwith that tilled before the war, is under cultivation, the remainder\r\nbecomes wild. Could the fallen confederates return they would not in many\r\nplaces recognize their old homes. Nearly every man of average business\r\nability could control his slaves, before the war, with little trouble; but\r\nit now requires far more than ordinary capacity to find and keep good\r\ntenants, to employ laborers amid the present scarcity, and to retain and\r\nmake them remunerative when employed. The freedman is a different\r\ncharacter from his former slave self, and is to be governed by different\r\nmethods; and the true art of managing him is cabalism to many who were\r\nprosperous planters before the war. Multitudes of these show great\r\ndespondency, for there have been thousands of failures among them.\r\n\r\nBut when we examine into this depression, we find that it is but the\r\nresult of the transition from the former _regime_, and not a deep-seated\r\nand fatal decay of the vitals. These are some of the symptoms of assured\r\nrecovery, noted within the last three or four years: a steady contraction\r\nof credit, and widening prevalency of the cash system; growing conviction\r\nthat the whites must depend upon their own labor more, and less on that of\r\nthe negroes; augmenting number of land-owners who decline to secure the\r\nmerchants advancing supplies to their tenants and laborers; a greater\r\nacreage devoted to food crops; general advocacy of diversified planting;\r\nspreading dissatisfaction with the laws giving large exemptions to\r\ndebtors. Southern economical affairs, in their sinking, \"touched bottom\"\r\n(to use the forcible expression now in vogue) about the end of 1874.[199]\r\nThere has been a probable increase since of the mass of distress, as the\r\nheat of a summer day increases, by accumulation, for a while after noon,\r\nthough the sun is imparting less and less. Steady amelioration will soon\r\nbe general. A new system is slowly developing, and can be plainly\r\ndiscerned among the rubbish of the old. The change from former days most\r\nnoticeable now is the multiplication, increased energy, and continually,\r\ngrowing trade of the smaller towns. This is due to the decay of planting,\r\nwhich was a wholesale system, and the coming-in of farming, which is a\r\nsmall trading system using much less concentrated capital. The large\r\nmoneyed man, for evident economical reasons, buys in commercial\r\ncentres--in cities--but the small purchaser must needs buy in the nearest\r\nmarket. Allowing for the great increase of farmers, and the control by the\r\nnegroes of their earnings, there are many thousands more of small buyers\r\nin the south than there were before the war, and towns build up to sell to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact, not so noticeable as the rapidly growing local\r\ntrade, but still more important. A class of new planters, consisting\r\nmainly of men too young to have become fixed in the methods and habits of\r\nformer days, is springing up. They are new yet; but there is, in many\r\nparts of the south, at least one who is teaching many watching idlers by\r\ndeeds and silence. They have remodelled their domestic economy,\r\naccommodating it to their smaller incomes and to the uncertainty of\r\nhousehold help. They have discarded the outside kitchen, have substituted\r\nthe cooking stove for the old voracious fireplace, and have brought the\r\nwell with a pump in it, instead of the old windlass and bucket, under the\r\nroof of the dwelling, so that the household duties may be more easily\r\ndespatched by their wives and children. And they have also remodelled\r\ntheir planting. They diversify their crops and products, raising more\r\ngrain, and introducing clover and new forage plants. Some abandon entirely\r\nthe cultivation of the old slave crops, and supply the nearest towns with\r\nfeed and provisions. These planters of the New south till less land, and\r\nstrive to improve it; they study the superiority and economy of machinery;\r\nthey provide themselves with better cotton-gins, often using steam to work\r\nthem; they have presses which require fewer hands than the old\r\npacking-screw; better plows are used; and harrows, reapers, and mowers,\r\nwhich, in many parts of the south, were seldom known before the war, are\r\nnow common. This little band keeps pace with agricultural progress, as\r\nrecorded in the journals; they seek for and find many new sources of\r\nprofit; they prepare the people for laws fostering the interest of the\r\nplanter in many particulars; they mold the opinion of their neighborhood;\r\nand their ability, skill, and wealth slowly increase. They struggle with a\r\nnew order of things, having to think for themselves at every turn, and\r\noften misstep and fall in the dark, but they pick themselves up, and find\r\nthe way again. The light of the new experience which they are kindling\r\ngrows brighter each year, and is beginning to draw some of their neighbors\r\nto travel in it.\r\n\r\nIt is not our object to give a false impression of the influence of the\r\nclass of farmers last referred to. They are but few, and their efforts are\r\nbut the beginnings of the happy coming change. Their courage, power, and\r\nnumbers are manifestly on the increase; and, as there is no other\r\nprogressive activity in agriculture, and they meet no opposition save the\r\npassive resistance of despondency and inaction, it is almost certain that\r\nthey will lay deep and sure the foundations of the needed renovation of\r\nthe south. It is their belief that, to make agriculture generally\r\nprosperous, and to school the people to habits of thrift and saving, are\r\nthe first steps, and that manufactories and trades and heterogeneous\r\nindustries will naturally follow.\r\n\r\nThey desire northern settlers, to add useful features to agricultural\r\neconomy, and diversify planting. A few have come, and they are prospering.\r\nIt seems rational to expect a steady influx of these for many years,\r\nbringing capital and methods better suited to the needs of the changed\r\ntimes, raising the value of landed property out of its impeding\r\nprostration, and strengthening the industrial force. The climate; the\r\nabundance of cheap, cleared land; the long settlement having demonstrated\r\nthe country to be healthy; the fact that plowing and other important\r\noutdoor work can be done on the farms all the winter round; the many\r\nrailways, the multiplying towns and growing cities; the variety of\r\nproducts, and easy access to market--now that slavery and the animosity of\r\nwar are gone, and the misrule of the carpetbagger has ended nearly\r\neverywhere--these, and many other advantages daily disclosing themselves,\r\nexcel most of the new States and the Territories in offering inducements\r\nto immigrants; and, in due course of time, a vast number of settlers, both\r\nAmerican and foreign, will be added to the population. There are many\r\nindications that the immigration of stock-raisers, wool-growers,\r\nmarket-gardeners, orchardists, beekeepers, in fine, small farmers of every\r\nkind, adapted to the soil and climate, will soon begin in earnest. When it\r\ndoes, the rebuilding of the south will be rapid.\r\n\r\nThe coming-in of northern capitalists, to invest in railways, mines,\r\nmanufactories, and other large moneyed enterprises--most especially to\r\ndevelop the great resources of water-power--may be expected to begin at\r\nonce, and considerably, upon the close of the centennial year. It seems\r\nnow that this is the most powerful agency that may be expected to begin\r\nimmediate work, in introducing the much-needed higher type of industrial\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the two races toward each other were, for a few years\r\nafter the war, bitterly hostile. The whites had, all their lives, seen the\r\nnegroes in slavery, and from their infancy they had heard their preachers\r\ndefend slavery, not in the abstract, as their phrase was, but in the\r\nconcrete. The \"concrete\" meant African slavery, which was justified on the\r\nground that the African was divinely intended in his nature for slavery,\r\nwhich was to him christianization and civilization, so long as he remained\r\na slave; while, the moment he was set free, he would revert to his\r\nprimitive barbarism. When these God-given slaves were suddenly cut loose\r\nfrom mastership, and the wealth of the capitalist, the portion of the\r\norphan, and the mite of the widow were swept away at once by emancipation,\r\neither directly or as a necessary consequence, there was a great shock\r\ngiven to the whites. But when, three years afterwards, a new constituency\r\nwas created, in which the slaves, just emancipated, outnumbered the\r\nwhites, in many counties, the storm of passion that burst forth can hardly\r\nbe described. The whites feared that the old relation was about to be\r\ninverted, and that they would be made slaves to the negroes. There was\r\nmany a deed of violence, and many a poor negro paid his life for a few\r\noffensive words.\r\n\r\nBut a wonderful change has taken place. When the southern States were\r\n\"reconstructed,\" as it is termed, in 1868, a negro school-keeper or\r\npreacher, if known to be a republican in politics--as he generally\r\nwas--was hardly safe anywhere beyond the limits of a city. The negro\r\nschools were often broken up by mobs, and sometimes black congregations\r\nwere attacked at night in their churches and dispersed by armed whites in\r\ndisguise. Now, the colored children troop securely to school, and the\r\ncolored churches and their congregations are sternly protected by law\r\neverywhere. Seven years ago a colored person could hardly get justice, in\r\neven the plainest case, from a jury of the other race. Now, in all of the\r\ncourts, he has the influence of white men to aid him, and rarely is an\r\nunjust verdict rendered against him. He makes better friends of the\r\nwhites. There is no need for him to legislate or hold office over them; he\r\ncannot yet do these things right for himself. He rises, however, and his\r\nimportance is felt more and more. His labor is a necessity. Learning to\r\nuse it aright, he will surely win all that he deserves. The healthful\r\nsentiment prevails everywhere, at the north as at the south, and with the\r\nlate slave also, that to force his growth is as unfortunate to him as is\r\nmisjudged parental assistance, which often keeps adult children from ever\r\nbecoming self-reliant. The colored race in the south must be educated by\r\nthe struggle for existence into self-maintenance. This training, like the\r\nmaterial recuperation of the south, will require time, with patience and\r\nhopefulness.\r\n\r\nThe negro tends resistlessly to a fixed position in his own class. He does\r\nnot wish to ride in the same railway-car with fine ladies and gentlemen,\r\nnor could you persuade him to send his children to a mixed school to be\r\nteased by white scholars. He will not be legislated out of his natural\r\ncircle, where he feels comfortable, into one where he will be ill at case.\r\nHe seeks for himself a separate home, school, church, and occupation, in\r\nall of which he can, at a distance, imitate the white, to whom he is ever\r\nlooking up. The statute books may be covered with laws having a different\r\npurpose, but they will be as powerless to check the current of separation\r\nas prescribed rates of interest are impotent to keep down usury when\r\nmoney is dear. In a domestic world, a company and circle of his own, the\r\nnegro will make a start for himself.\r\n\r\nBut the negro is grossly misunderstood. It is too generally forgotten that\r\nhe is many centuries below the white in evolution. Slavery has elevated\r\nhim far above the savagery of Africa, and introduced him to perhaps his\r\nonly chance of civilization.\r\n\r\nHis future in the south is a mystery. Many of his best friends do not\r\nbelieve that he can hold all the great advantages that he has gained in\r\nthe last ten years. The whites have been muzzled by hostile government.\r\nThey were stunned, while the negro was stimulated, by emancipation. Their\r\nnatural effort to hold on to the _ante bellum_ system has also helped the\r\nold slave. But, when small and diversified farming is fully developed, and\r\naccumulating capital brings in the higher industries, there may be a\r\ngeneral need for more efficient and skilled labor than the average negro\r\ncan supply. While he is forever safe politically against the white, he may\r\nnot be economically safe.\r\n\r\nIn noticing the leading features of the New south, we have merely hinted\r\nat her rich natural endowments. We have deemed of more importance the\r\ncharacter of her people, the new views and principles beginning to assert\r\nthemselves, the great economical changes following and to follow the\r\nabolition of slavery, and the potent effects soon to be wrought by copious\r\nimmigration. For upon these the future mainly depends.\r\n\r\nThe south is in a thorough and long transition. Her fields are to be made\r\nfertile and to smile beautifully with an infinite variety of products; her\r\nprovisional labor is to be gradually supplanted by a permanent system;\r\nindustries, trades, and manufactories are to be founded and everywhere\r\nmultiplied; she is to have local organizations which will foster more of\r\nself-government; her common schools are to be reconstituted and rendered\r\ntruly serviceable to all; and she has also her part to do in literature,\r\nscience, and art, as well as in domestic and national politics. We must\r\nnot be oversanguine in hope of her immediate progress; but we can\r\ncertainly take courage, when we find that every one who perceptibly\r\ninfluences society by precept or by example--whether he be prominent like\r\nGordon or Lamar, or only a humble planter leading the fore-row in his\r\nfields--is seeking for and finding the right path. These leaders must, in\r\nthe nature of things, have a larger following every year. In due time,\r\ntheir children and their children's children will make the south of a\r\npiece with the more prosperous portions of our country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[I intended to incorporate in the foregoing these two passages, but by\r\nsome inadvertence they were not printed in their several places:\r\n\r\nI said of Von Holst:\r\n\r\n    \"Though he does not equal Mommsen's vivid delineation of the effects\r\n    of Roman slavery, his work is in grateful contrast with most of the\r\n    anti- and pro-slavery literature of America, by reason of his freedom\r\n    from ethical declamation, and his presentation of the real evils of\r\n    slavery, in the light of social, and especially economical, laws.\"\r\n\r\nI also said of the negro:\r\n\r\n    \"His flexibility; his receptivity to civilization, so different from\r\n    the inveterate repugnance of the Indian; his satisfaction and almost\r\n    complete freedom from discontent, insuring him against any violent\r\n    change; the probably long necessity for his labor; are all great\r\n    things in his favor.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n[To decide what is the right handle to a passage not pointed to by a\r\nchapter title, and place it in an index where an average reader will\r\nexpect it, is often very hard.

Cicero asserts that there is no private property whatever\r\naccording to the law of nature; that according to that law all things are\r\ncommon property. He details some of the ways by which private\r\nappropriation is made, such as long holding, entry into vacant lands,\r\ncapture in war, acquisition by contract, etc. According to this, a\r\nprisoner of war stood on the same footing as a horse captured from the\r\nenemy. By the law of nature there could be private property in neither.\r\nBut this law of nature was really repealed by the _jus gentium_, under\r\nwhich both horse and prisoner alike became private property. If another\r\ntook either the horse or slave away from the owner, he would--to use\r\nCicero's language--violate the law of human society.

Subsequent examination and comparison have\r\ngiven me a still higher opinion of this book; which in its well-digested\r\npresentation of evidence exhaustively collected, and complete\r\ndemonstration of its main proposition, to wit, that in the opinion of the\r\ndraftsmen, also of all the advocates of the constitution, and of the\r\npeople ratifying, the States were sovereign before adoption and would so\r\nremain afterwards, is unique, and far foremost, in the literature of the\r\nsubject. Compare this strong statement of Henry Cabot Lodge, uttered in\r\n1883:\r\n\r\n\"When the constitution was adopted by the votes of States at Philadelphia,\r\nand accepted by the votes of States in popular conventions, it is safe to\r\nsay that there was not a man in the country, from Washington and Hamilton\r\non the one side, to George Clinton and George Mason on the other, who\r\nregarded the new system as anything but an experiment by the States and\r\nfrom which each and every State had the right peaceably to withdraw, a\r\nright which was very likely to be exercised.\" Daniel Webster, 176.\r\n\r\n[34] Republic of Republics, 4th ed., 23.

But his most valuable addition to the few books which have\r\ntaught true monetary doctrine is his \"Science of Money.\" While in this he\r\ndoes not state the fundamental principle of good money as clearly as\r\nCalhoun does, yet he assumes it most accurately and builds upon it\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n[53] \"Rational Money,\" published by C. F. Taylor, 1520 Chestnut Street,\r\nPhiladelphia. The author does not show the deep insight and genial\r\noriginality of Calhoun and Del Mar; but he has presented the entire\r\nsubject with a judgment so sane in accepting the true and rejecting the\r\nfalse in the belonging theory, that the book is the very best of existing\r\ncompilations.\r\n\r\n[54] To be nominated in the South Carolina primary, a candidate for\r\ngovernor or any other State place must receive a majority in the whole\r\nState, one for congress a majority in the district, one for a county place\r\na majority in the county. Where no candidate receives a majority a new\r\nprimary is held only to decide between the two who got the largest vote.\r\nThe primary first mentioned is a State primary, held on the last Tuesday\r\nof August. At this date, the crop--to use planting parlance--having been\r\nlaid by for some six weeks, the voters have had ample opportunity from\r\nreading the papers, talks with one another, and hearing speeches to inform\r\nthemselves fully. Just across the Savannah in Georgia, the State\r\ndemocratic executive committee, so called, being the faithful organ of the\r\nrailroads, has since 1898 put the primary in the early days of June, in\r\nbusiest crop-time. This precludes any real canvass. It also keeps\r\nthousands from voting; and so the always full turnout of railroad regulars\r\nand workers--which is but a relatively small portion of the body of\r\nelectors--wins a plurality. The committee allows a plurality to nominate,\r\nas of course a plurality can be had more easily than a majority. To be\r\nsure of the State senate, nominations to it are made by a convention\r\ninstead of a primary. And conventions in the congressional districts\r\nnominate candidates for the lower house.\r\n\r\nContrasting the results--in South Carolina nomination is really the voice\r\nof the people; in Georgia the people seem to get, while the railroads\r\nreally get, the governor, and, as everybody now expects, the railroads and\r\nliquor men always have at least twenty-three of the forty-four senators.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Swiss-like grip of the people of South Carolina upon\r\ntheir liberties, shaming Georgia so greatly as it does, is mainly due to\r\nthe influence of Calhoun. That influence is still benignly powerful, even\r\nwhere unrecognized.\r\n\r\nI think that if the dispensary law were so altered as to give each county\r\nthe purchase of its liquor by, say, its supervisor, nominated by this\r\nprimary, the opportunity of graft, now discrediting the administration of\r\nthe law with many, would be effectually closed. There would then be\r\neverywhere a trustworthy official, of their own election, to keep the\r\npeople advised as to proper prices and cost. It would be to lose all\r\nchance of re-election for the official to cheat the public by colluding\r\nwith the liquor sellers.\r\n\r\n[55] Life of John C.

Here is what he says:\r\n\r\n\"The plague-spot in sexual relations is easy marriage and easy separation.\r\nThis is no sudden development, nor the fruit of emancipation. It is the\r\nplain heritage from slavery. In those days Sam, with his master's consent,\r\ntook up with Mary. No ceremony was necessary, and in the busy life of the\r\ngreat plantations of the Black Belt it was usually dispensed with. If now\r\nthe master needed Sam's work in another part of the same plantation, or if\r\nhe took a notion to sell the slave, Sam's married life with Mary was\r\nusually unceremoniously broken, and then it was clearly to the master's\r\ninterest to have both of them take new mates. This widespread custom of\r\ntwo centuries has not been eradicated in thirty years.\" The Souls of Black\r\nFolk, 142.\r\n\r\nThis statement is utterly untrue, as Professor DuBois can easily find out\r\nfrom thousands of most credible witnesses. I never knew of a single such\r\nseparation. Of course, I will not say that there were none at all. But I\r\ndo say, in contradiction of his assertion, as flat as contradiction can\r\nbe, that the separations which he describes were not common. Every\r\nimpartial investigator who has formed his opinion from the actual evidence\r\nknows that the unchastity of the negro slave of America was an inheritance\r\nfrom Africa. I do not dispute the assertion often made that there were and\r\nare still chaste negro tribes of that continent. But our negroes did not\r\ncome from them. They came from the West Africans, accurately described\r\nabove in citations from Mr. Tillinghast.\r\n\r\n[94] Uncle Tom's Cabin and Key, Riverside ed., vol. i. p. lxxxix _sq._\r\n\r\n[95] Uncle Tom's Cabin and Key, Riverside ed., vol. ii. 273.\r\n\r\n[96] Georgians, 128.\r\n\r\n[97] The Life of Robert Toombs, 29-49 (New York, Cassell Pub.

Congressional Gov.\r\n58-192, and in other places.\r\n\r\n[101] What he says July 29, 1857, on death of Preston S. Brooks is a good\r\nexample of the forced and labored style of his set speeches. Stephens\r\noften said that his set speeches were failures. And unless they were made,\r\nas that on the invasion of States, that on the duty of congress to protect\r\nslavery in the Territories, and his justification of secession, January 7,\r\n1861, under the excitement of a great cause, working the same effect upon\r\nhim as the ardor of extemporaneous effort, his set speeches are below the\r\nmark. And I wish he had more carefully revised the three just mentioned,\r\nfollowing the example of Cicero, Erskine and Webster, who habitually\r\ncorrected and improved their words after they had been spoken. He does not\r\nseem to have given his good speeches--the extemporaneous ones--any\r\nsystematic correction. Of all speakers and orators I ever knew or heard\r\nof, he has used the file the least. It is my belief that he did not know\r\nhow to use it. Had he but polished just some of his best unpremeditated\r\nefforts; as for instances his first speech for the retired naval officers;\r\nhis most important utterances under various heads of internal\r\nimprovements; his humorous anti-pension harangues; and his titanic\r\nstruggle in vain with his own party to keep Harlan seated--what a find\r\nthey would be for the school speech books of the future! His lecture on\r\nslavery, delivered in Tremont Temple, Boston, January 24, 1859,--a good\r\ncopy of which is given by Stephens (The War between the States, vol. i.\r\n625-647)--is the best specimen extant, within my knowledge, of his\r\ndeliberate style. If I may make such a distinction, it was carefully\r\nrevised, but never corrected. The reader will find it, I believe, the very\r\nablest of all the many defences of slavery in the south.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davis states that during the times of excitement concerning the\r\ncompromise of 1850, \"He [Toombs] would sit with one hand full of the\r\nreporter's notes of his speeches, for correction,\" with a French play in\r\nthe other, over which he was roaring with laughter. (Memoir of Jefferson\r\nDavis, vol. i. 411.) As his speech of December 13, 1849, and the Hamilcar\r\nspeech of June next following, need very little correction, I incline to\r\nbelieve that he did at least try to revise them. Naturally leading such a\r\nnovel movement as he then was--it will be fully explained a little later\r\non--he would desire to send forth his views in only carefully considered\r\nwords, and probably he corrected the proofs of the two speeches just\r\nmentioned with something like diligence. In his pleadings, law-briefs,\r\nsketches of proposed statutes, letters, etc., of which I saw much in his\r\nlast years, he was so palpably indifferent towards improving his first\r\ndraft that one might know it came from lifelong habit.\r\n\r\n[102] Third Session, 240-244.\r\n\r\n[103] _Globe_, 35th Cong., 1st Sess., Appendix, 360 (I am thus particular\r\nin giving this reference, from a sense of justice to the memory of George\r\nW.

In other words, the negro to\r\ncome will not be the negro of the emancipation proclamation, but he will\r\nbe the Anglo-Saxonized Afro-American. It seems true, as has been said, 'No\r\nrace can look the Anglo-Saxon in the face and live.' Certainly no other\r\nrace can hold its own in his immediate presence. Being in immediate\r\ncontact and underrating the mental and moral virtues of others and\r\nexercising a sovereignty over them, his opportunities are enlarged to make\r\nother races his own in consanguinity.

Having finished my work I read two days ago, \"The Color\r\nLine. A Brief in behalf of the Unborn.\" By William Benjamin Smith, N. Y.,\r\n1905. It ably and vividly explains the transcendent importance of keeping\r\nthe blood of Caucasians in America uncontaminated with that of the\r\nAfrican, and demonstrates that to do this the color line must be rigidly\r\nmaintained between negroid as well as coal-black, on one side, and white\r\non the other. The utter impossibility of making the man of a particular\r\nrace like the man of another extremely remote one by even the most careful\r\neducation is shown with startling effect. The inability of the black to\r\nhold his own against white competition, and his gradual and sure expulsion\r\nis proved by overwhelming evidence. The book is useful as an introduction\r\nto all the literature of the subject. The only fault that I note is its\r\nexcessive warmth and combativeness--especially in the first half.

Professor DuBois is also\r\nauthor of the \"Negro Landholder of Georgia,\" Bulletin of Department of\r\nLabor, No. 35, July, 1901.\r\n\r\n[171] Bulletin 8, before cited, 75.\r\n\r\n[172] Article, \"Negro Education,\" Encyclopedia Americana.\r\n\r\n[173] Professor DuBois, Bulletin 8, cited above, 73.\r\n\r\n[174] _Id._ 77.\r\n\r\n[175] Book cited, 183-185.\r\n\r\n[176] _Id._ 184.\r\n\r\n[177] Book cited, 184.\r\n\r\n[178] _Id._ 184.\r\n\r\n[179] Bureau of Statistics--Bulletin No. 28, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[180] _Id._ 72.\r\n\r\n[181] Extract from a letter of Hon. James M. Smith to the author. He is, I\r\nbelieve, the largest planter in Georgia. His lands lie in the adjoining\r\nedges of Oglethorpe county, which is in the Black Belt, and of Madison\r\ncounty, which is outside. From his experience, and because of the great\r\naccuracy of his observation, which I have noted for nearly forty years, I\r\nregard him as better qualified than any one else who can be suggested, to\r\ngive a correct opinion on the subjects he deals with in the quotation.\r\nEspecially do I emphasize his exceptional advantages for comparing whites\r\nand negroes as farmers, tenants, croppers, and laborers for standing\r\nwages, in making cotton.\r\n\r\n[182] Book cited above, 121, 122.\r\n\r\n[183] The Voice of the Negro, September, 1904 (Atlanta, Ga.)--Consider\r\npicture of \"Board of Directors of the True Reformers' Bank, Richmond,\r\nVa.,\" in number of same magazine for November, 1904. These directors are\r\nnine in all, and there is but one who is decidedly black. Six of them look\r\nto be more than three-quarters white. The number for March, 1905, contains\r\na sketch of William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, Ph.D., stating that the\r\nProfessor's ancestry is largely white and his color a rich brown. The\r\npicture of his mother shows her hair to be straight and her complexion\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n[184] Book cited above, 213-215.\r\n\r\n[185] The Voice of the Negro, October, 1904, p. 435.\r\n\r\n[186] Department of Commerce and Labor Bureau of the Census, Bulletin 8,\r\nNegroes in the United States, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[187] I have in mind his late articles in the _Outlook_.\r\n\r\n[188] See his \"Problems of the Present South.\"\r\n\r\n[189] Autobiography of Seventy Years, vol. ii. 60-62.\r\n\r\n[190] By Anne Scribner, and copied in the _Public_ of September 17, 1904,\r\nfrom the Chicago _Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n[191] The passage with the context quoted by Dr. Booker Washington,\r\n\"Working with the Hands,\" 238.\r\n\r\n[192] Issue of October 15, 1904.\r\n\r\n[193] Encyclopedia Americana, Article \"Negro Education.\"\r\n\r\n[194] But the most drastic provisions to keep the greedy whites from\r\npreying upon the negroes as they did upon the Indians most be adopted,\r\nsuch as permitting the negro State to tax without limit whites owning\r\nproperty or doing business therein. This will prevent the result\r\nanticipated by Booker Washington.\r\n\r\n[195] The best thing upon the joint education of hand and brain known to\r\nme is \"Pagan _vs._ Christian Civilization,\" by S. H. Comings (Charles H.\r\nKerr & Co., Chicago). The title does not indicate, as it ought to do, the\r\nspecial purpose of the book to show that to give the scholar expertness\r\nwith his hands at the first and thus develop his self-supporting ability\r\nis far better than to cram his memory. What the author says in maintenance\r\nof his proposition, that our industrial schools should be operated upon a\r\nplan that will make the scholar pay as he goes, out of his own work, for\r\nhis subsistence and expense of education during the entire course,\r\ndeserves respectful and thoughtful consideration. In its brevity, and at\r\nthe same time variety and fulness, coming as it does at the beginning of a\r\nnew era, it reminds me of Sullivan's tract which some years ago started\r\nthe American agitation for direct legislation, with store of examples and\r\nexposition almost sufficient for its entire needs.\r\n\r\nThe above had been written when Booker Washington's \"Working with the\r\nHands\" came along. The well-chosen title informs accurately as to the\r\nsubject of the book. Its scope covers working with the hands from its\r\nbeginning in childhood to the close of life. As illustration of his\r\nprinciples Dr. Washington circumstantially tells of the beneficent\r\nindustrial and moral training given at Tuskegee, in all its many\r\ndepartments, to children, youth, and adults, in everything which it is\r\nimportant that a negro of either sex should know how to do. Besides its\r\nwisdom, its attention-commanding and interest-exciting style deserves high\r\ncommendation. Any reader longing for the day of real education to dawn who\r\nopens the book will go to the end, without skipping, in a delightful\r\ngallop. It is my conviction that it will be of far more advantage to the\r\nwhite industrial and technological schools than to those for which it is\r\nspecially intended by the author.\r\n\r\n[196] Book cited, 119.\r\n\r\n[197] See Collier's Weekly for November 26, 1904.\r\n\r\n[198] The English translation of the first volume of Von Holst's\r\n\"Constitutional and Political History of the United States\" has just been\r\npublished. The titles of the ninth and tenth chapters, to wit, \"The\r\nEconomic Contrast between the Free and Slave States,\" and \"Development of\r\nthe Economic Contrast between the Free and Slave States,\" are very apt and\r\nstriking, and the contents of the chapters are profoundly original and\r\ninstructive. Having ample space, the author has, among other merits, well\r\nhandled the following incidents and consequences of slavery:\r\n\r\n1. Implacable hostility of slave and non-slave labor.\r\n\r\n2. Self-protecting necessity to slavery of continuous expansion, and, to\r\ninsure this expansion, necessity that the south keep political mastery of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n3. Economic importance to south of invention of cotton-gin in 1793.\r\n\r\n4. Exclusive possession by north of wholesale trade.\r\n\r\n5. Greater immigration to north.\r\n\r\n6. Missouri Compromise, and rise therefrom of geographical parties.\r\n\r\n7. Internal improvements and tariff passing inter-geographical question.\r\n\r\n8. Economic decay of south due to slavery, and not to tariff.\r\n\r\n9. Opposition of slavery to the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief statement of the chief demerits of the two\r\nchapters:\r\n\r\n1. Misstatement that there were different circles of slaveholders;\r\noverstatement of inhumanity of masters; and unjust disparagement of\r\ncharacter of smaller slaveholders.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to note the great absorbing energy of slave property.\r\n\r\n3. Failure to note the lack of a population of free workers.\r\n\r\nBut the work, considering the short time the clouds of battle have had to\r\nclear away, recollecting, too, that the author is a foreigner, is,\r\nexcepting a little heated partisanship here and there, a most valuable\r\ncontribution to the history of our country.\r\n\r\n[199] I see now--in 1905--that the statement in the text was a great\r\nmistake; and that nadir was not reached until some fifteen or twenty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN DISPOSSESSED\r\n\r\nBy SETH K. HUMPHREY\r\n\r\nWith sixteen full-page illustrations from photographs\r\n\r\n  300 pages.    12mo.    Cloth, $1.50 net.    Postpaid, $1.64.\r\n\r\nA plain, connected, carefully prepared narrative of the actual and proved\r\ndealings of the United States government with the subdued Indian--the\r\nReservation Indian. The author's account of governmental oppression and\r\nill-faith, and of successive removals of the Indians from their homes to\r\nregions unattractive to white settlers, and of the confiscation of Indian\r\nproperty, are supported by extracts from official records. After chapters\r\ndescribing the experience of the Umatillas (with whom the government held\r\nto its treaty), the Flathead Indians of the Bitter Root, the Nez Perces,\r\nthe Poncas, and the Mission Indians, comes an important chapter on\r\n\"Dividing the Spoils,\" with a graphic and moving description of the scenes\r\nat the opening of the Cherokee Strip, drawn from the author's personal\r\nexperiences. A chapter is devoted to an exposure of the Rosebud\r\nReservation bill,--the latest example of governmental confiscation,--while\r\nthe final chapter gives an original and convincing explanation of the\r\nremarkable persistence of vicious influences in our Indian system, in the\r\nface of the equally persistent desire of the American people to grant the\r\nIndian fair play. Helen Jackson's \"A Century of Dishonor\" has received a\r\nvaluable companion work in the present book.\r\n\r\n  LITTLE, BROWN, & CO., _Publishers_\r\n  254 WASHINGTON STREET, BOSTON",
