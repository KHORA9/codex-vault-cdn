This may be met by a counter question, Will there ever be a\r\ntime in the near future when there will _not_ be another Life of\r\nLincoln? There is always a new class of students and a new enrolment of\r\ncitizens. Every year many thousands of young people pass from the\r\nGrammar to the High School grade of our public schools. Other thousands\r\nare growing up into manhood and womanhood. These are of a different\r\nconstituency from their fathers and grandfathers who remember the civil\r\nwar and were perhaps in it.\r\n\r\n\"To the younger generation,\" writes Carl Schurz, \"Abraham Lincoln has\r\nalready become a half mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic\r\ndistance, grows to more and more heroic proportions, but also loses in\r\ndistinctness of outline and figure.\" The last clause of this remark is\r\npainfully true. To the majority of people now living, his outline and\r\nfigure are dim and vague. There are to-day professors and presidents of\r\ncolleges, legislators of prominence, lawyers and judges, literary men,\r\nand successful business men, to whom Lincoln is a tradition. It cannot\r\nbe expected that a person born after the year (say) 1855, could\r\nremember Lincoln more than as a name. Such an one's ideas are made up\r\nnot from his remembrance and appreciation of events as they occurred,\r\nbut from what he has read and heard about them in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThe great mine of information concerning the facts of Lincoln's life\r\nis, and probably will always be, the History by his secretaries,\r\nNicolay and Hay. This is worthily supplemented by the splendid volumes\r\nof Miss Tarbell. There are other biographies of great value. Special\r\nmention should be made of the essay by Carl Schurz, which is classic.\r\n\r\nThe author has consulted freely all the books on the subject he could\r\nlay his hands on. In this volume there is no attempt to write a history\r\nof the times in which Lincoln lived and worked. Such historical events\r\nas have been narrated were selected solely because they illustrated\r\nsome phase of the character of Lincoln. In this biography the single\r\npurpose has been to present the living man with such distinctness of\r\noutline that the reader may have a sort of feeling of being acquainted\r\nwith him. If the reader, finishing this volume, has a vivid realization\r\nof Lincoln as a man, the author will be fully repaid.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this purpose in brief compass, much has been omitted. Some\r\nof the material omitted has probably been of a value fully equal to\r\nsome that has been inserted. This could not well be avoided. But if the\r\nreader shall here acquire interest enough in the subject to continue\r\nthe study of this great, good man, this little book will have served\r\nits purpose.\r\n\r\n  H. K.\r\n  WESTFIELD, NEW JERSEY, February, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century there is, strictly speaking,\r\nno frontier to the United States. At the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the larger part of the country was frontier. In any portion of\r\nthe country to-day, in the remotest villages and hamlets, on the\r\nenormous farms of the Dakotas or the vast ranches of California, one is\r\ncertain to find some, if not many, of the modern appliances of\r\ncivilization such as were not dreamed of one hundred years ago. Aladdin\r\nhimself could not have commanded the glowing terms to write the\r\nprospectus of the closing years of the nineteenth century. So, too, it\r\nrequires an extraordinary effort of the imagination to conceive of the\r\ncondition of things in the opening years of that century.\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of the century closed with the year 1825. At that\r\ndate Lincoln was nearly seventeen years old. The deepest impressions of\r\nlife are apt to be received very early, and it is certain that the\r\ninfluences which are felt previous to seventeen years of age have much\r\nto do with the formation of the character. If, then, we go back to the\r\nperiod named, we can tell with sufficient accuracy what were the\r\ncircumstances of Lincoln's early life. Though we cannot precisely tell\r\nwhat he had, we can confidently name many things, things which in this\r\nday we class as the necessities of life, which he had to do without,\r\nfor the simple reason that they had not then been invented or\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we must bear in mind that he lived in the woods.\r\nThe West of that day was not wild in the sense of being wicked,\r\ncriminal, ruffian. Morally, and possibly intellectually, the people of\r\nthat region would compare with the rest of the country of that day or\r\nof this day. There was little schooling and no literary training. But\r\nthe woodsman has an education of his own. The region was wild in the\r\nsense that it was almost uninhabited and untilled. The forests,\r\nextending from the mountains in the East to the prairies in the West,\r\nwere almost unbroken and were the abode of wild birds and wild beasts.\r\nBears, deer, wild-cats, raccoons, wild turkeys, wild pigeons, wild\r\nducks and similar creatures abounded on every hand.\r\n\r\nConsider now the sparseness of the population. Kentucky has an area of\r\n40,000 square miles. One year after Lincoln's birth, the total\r\npopulation, white and colored, was 406,511, or an average of ten\r\npersons--say less than two families--to the square mile. Indiana has\r\nan area of 36,350 square miles. In 1810 its total population was\r\n24,520, or an average of one person to one and one-half square miles;\r\nin 1820 it contained 147,173 inhabitants, or about four to the square\r\nmile; in 1825 the population was about 245,000, or less than seven to\r\nthe square mile.\r\n\r\nThe capital city, Indianapolis, which is to-day of surpassing beauty,\r\nwas not built nor thought of when the boy Lincoln moved into the State.\r\n\r\nIllinois, with its more than 56,000 square miles of territory, harbored\r\nin 1810 only 12,282 people; in 1820, only 55,211, or less than one to\r\nthe square mile; while in 1825 its population had grown a trifle over\r\n100,000 or less than two to the square mile.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that up to his youth, Lincoln dwelt only in the\r\nwildest of the wild woods, where the animals from the chipmunk to the\r\nbear were much more numerous, and probably more at home, than man.\r\n\r\nThere were few roads of any kind, and certainly none that could be\r\ncalled good. For the mud of Indiana and Illinois is very deep and very\r\ntenacious. There were good saddle-horses, a sufficient number of oxen,\r\nand carts that were rude and awkward. No locomotives, no bicycles, no\r\nautomobiles. The first railway in Indiana was constructed in 1847, and\r\nit was, to say the least, a very primitive affair. As to carriages,\r\nthere may have been some, but a good carriage would be only a waste on\r\nthose roads and in that forest.\r\n\r\nThe only pen was the goose-quill, and the ink was home-made. Paper was\r\nscarce, expensive, and, while of good material, poorly made. Newspapers\r\nwere unknown in that virgin forest, and books were like angels' visits,\r\nfew and far between.\r\n\r\nThere were scythes and sickles, but of a grade that would not be\r\nsalable to-day at any price. There were no self-binding harvesters, no\r\nmowing machines. There were no sewing or knitting machines, though\r\nthere were needles of both kinds. In the woods thorns were used for\r\npins.\r\n\r\nGuns were flint-locks, tinder-boxes were used until the manufacture of\r\nthe friction match. Artificial light came chiefly from the open\r\nfireplace, though the tallow dip was known and there were some\r\nhousewives who had time to make them and the disposition to use them.\r\nIllumination by means of molded candles, oil, gas, electricity, came\r\nlater. That was long before the days of the telegraph.\r\n\r\nIn that locality there were no mills for weaving cotton, linen, or\r\nwoolen fabrics. All spinning was done by means of the hand loom, and\r\nthe common fabric of the region was linsey-woolsey, made of linen and\r\nwoolen mixed, and usually not dyed.\r\n\r\nAntiseptics were unknown, and a severe surgical operation was\r\npractically certain death to the patient. Nor was there ether,\r\nchloroform, or cocaine for the relief of pain.\r\n\r\nAs to food, wild game was abundant, but the kitchen garden was not\r\ndeveloped and there were no importations. No oranges, lemons, bananas.\r\nNo canned goods. Crusts of rye bread were browned, ground, and boiled;\r\nthis was coffee. Herbs of the woods were dried and steeped; this was\r\ntea. The root of the sassafras furnished a different kind of tea, a\r\nsubstitute for the India and Ceylon teas now popular. Slippery elm bark\r\nsoaked in cold water sufficed for lemonade. The milk-house, when there\r\nwas one, was built over a spring when that was possible, and the milk\r\nvessels were kept carefully covered to keep out snakes and other\r\ncreatures that like milk.\r\n\r\nWhisky was almost universally used. Indeed, in spite of the\r\nconstitutional \"sixteen-to-one,\" it was locally used as the standard of\r\nvalue. The luxury of quinine, which came to be in general use\r\nthroughout that entire region, was of later date.\r\n\r\nThese details are few and meager. It is not easy for us, in the midst\r\nof the luxuries, comforts, and necessities of a later civilization, to\r\nrealize the conditions of western life previous to 1825. But the\r\nsituation must be understood if one is to know the life of the boy\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nImagine this boy. Begin at the top and look down him--a long look, for\r\nhe was tall and gaunt. His cap in winter was of coon-skin, with the\r\ntail of the animal hanging down behind. In summer he wore a misshapen\r\nstraw hat with no hat-band. His shirt was of linsey-woolsey, above\r\ndescribed, and was of no color whatever, unless you call it \"the color\r\nof dirt.\" His breeches were of deer-skin with the hair outside. In dry\r\nweather these were what you please, but when wet they hugged the skin\r\nwith a clammy embrace, and the victim might sigh in vain for sanitary\r\nunderwear. These breeches were held up by one suspender. The hunting\r\nshirt was likewise of deer-skin. The stockings,--there weren't any\r\nstockings. The shoes were cow-hide, though moccasins made by his mother\r\nwere substituted in dry weather. There was usually a space of several\r\ninches between the breeches and the shoes, exposing a tanned and bluish\r\nskin. For about half the year he went barefoot.\r\n\r\nThere were schools, primitive and inadequate, indeed, as we shall\r\npresently see, but \"the little red schoolhouse on the hill,\" with the\r\nstars and stripes floating proudly above it, was not of that day. There\r\nwere itinerant preachers who went from one locality to another, holding\r\n\"revival meetings.\" But church buildings were rare and, to say the\r\nleast, not of artistic design. There were no regular means of travel,\r\nand even the \"star route\" of the post-office department was slow in\r\nreaching those secluded communities.\r\n\r\nInto such circumstances and conditions Lincoln was born and grew into\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one becomes interested in a boy, one is almost certain to ask,\r\nWhose son is he? And when we study the character of a great man, it is\r\nnatural and right that we should be interested in his family. Where did\r\nhe come from? who were his parents? where did they come from? These\r\nquestions will engage our attention in this chapter.\r\n\r\nBut it is well to be on our guard at the outset against the\r\nfascinations of any theory of heredity. Every thoughtful observer knows\r\nsomething of the seductions of this subject either from experience or\r\nfrom observation. In every subject of research there is danger of\r\nclaiming too much in order to magnify the theory. This is emphatically\r\ntrue of this theory. Its devotees note the hits but not the misses. \"It\r\ntook five generations of cultured clergymen to produce an Emerson.\"\r\nUndoubtedly; but what of the sixth and seventh generations? \"Darwin's\r\ngreatness came from his father and grandfather.\" Very true; but are\r\nthere no more Darwins?\r\n\r\nIf Abraham Lincoln got his remarkable character from parents or\r\ngrandparents, from whom did he get his physical stature? His father was\r\na little above medium height, being five feet ten and one-half inches.\r\nHis mother was a little less than medium height, being five feet five\r\ninches. Their son was a giant, being no less than six feet four inches.\r\nIt is not safe to account too closely for his physical, mental, or\r\nmoral greatness by his descent. The fact is that there are too many\r\nunexplored remainders in the factors of heredity to make it possible to\r\napply the laws definitely.\r\n\r\nThe writer will therefore give a brief account of the Lincoln family\r\nsimply as a matter of interest, and not as a means of proving or\r\nexplaining any natural law.\r\n\r\nThe future president was descended from people of the middle class.\r\nThere was nothing either in his family or his surroundings to attract\r\nthe attention even of the closest observer, or to indicate any material\r\ndifference between him and scores of other boys in the same general\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nLincoln is an old English name, and in 1638 a family of the name\r\nsettled in Hingham, Mass., near Boston. Many years later we find the\r\nancestors of the president living in Berks County, Pa. It is possible\r\nthat this family came direct from England; but it is probable that they\r\ncame from Hingham. Both in Hingham and in Berks County there is a\r\nfrequent recurrence of certain scriptural names, such as Abraham,\r\nMordecai, and Thomas, which seems to be more than a coincidence.\r\n\r\nFrom Berks County certain of the family, who, by the way, were Quakers,\r\nmoved to Rockingham County, Va. In 1769 Daniel Boone, the adventurous\r\npioneer, opened up what is now the state of Kentucky, but was then a\r\npart of Virginia.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve years later, in 1781, Abraham Lincoln, great-grandfather\r\nof the president, emigrated from Virginia into Kentucky. People have\r\nasked, in a puzzled manner, why did he leave the beautiful Shenandoah\r\nvalley? One answer may be given: The Ohio valley also is beautiful.\r\nDuring the major portion of the year, from the budding of the leaves in\r\nApril until they pass away in the blaze of their autumn glory, the\r\nentire region is simply bewitching. No hills curve more gracefully, no\r\natmosphere is more soft, no watercourses are more enticing. Into this\r\nregion came the Virginian family, consisting, besides the parents, of\r\nthree sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\nA year or two later the head of the family was murdered by a skulking\r\nIndian, who proceeded to kidnap the youngest son, Thomas. The oldest\r\nson, Mordecai, quickly obtained a gun and killed the Indian, thus\r\navenging his father and rescuing his little brother.\r\n\r\nThis boy Thomas was father of the president. He has been called by some\r\nwriters shiftless and densely ignorant. But he seems to have been more\r\na creature of circumstances. There were no schools, and he,\r\nconsequently, did not go to school. There was no steady employment, and\r\nconsequently he had no steady employment. It is difficult to see how he\r\ncould have done better. He could shoot and keep the family supplied\r\nwith wild game. He did odd jobs as opportunity opened and \"just\r\ngrowed.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had force enough to learn to read and write after his marriage.\r\nHe had the roving disposition which is, and always has been, a trait of\r\npioneers. But this must be interpreted by the fact that he was\r\noptimistic rather than pessimistic. He removed to Indiana because, to\r\nhim, Indiana was the most glorious place in the whole world. He later\r\nremoved to Illinois because that was more glorious yet.\r\n\r\nHe certainly showed good taste in the selection of his wives, and what\r\nis equally to the purpose, was able to persuade them to share his\r\nhumble lot. He had an unfailing stock of good nature, was expert in\r\ntelling a humorous story, was perfectly at home in the woods, a fair\r\ncarpenter and a good farmer; and in short was as agreeable a companion\r\nas one would find in a day's journey. He would not have been at home in\r\na library, but he was at home in the forest.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 he married Nancy Hanks, a young woman from Virginia, who became\r\nthe mother of the president. Doubtless there are many women among the\r\nobscure who are as true and loyal as she was, but whose life is not\r\nbrought into publicity. Still, without either comparing or contrasting\r\nher with others, we may attest our admiration of this one as a \"woman\r\nnobly planned.\" In the midst of her household cares, which were neither\r\nfew nor light, she had the courage to undertake to teach her husband to\r\nread and write. She also gave her children a start in learning. Of her\r\nthe president, nearly half a century after her death, said to Seward,\r\nwith tears,--\"All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother--\r\nblessings on her memory.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln himself never manifested much interest in his genealogy. At\r\none time he did give out a brief statement concerning his ancestors\r\nbecause it seemed to be demanded by the exegencies of the campaign. But\r\nat another time, when questioned by Mr. J. L. Scripps, editor of the\r\nChicago _Tribune_, he answered: \"Why, Scripps, it is a great piece of\r\nfolly to attempt to make anything out of me or my early life. It can\r\nall be condensed into a single sentence, and that sentence you will\r\nfind in Gray's Elegy:\r\n\r\n  'The short and simple annals of the poor.'\r\n\r\nThat's my life, and that's all you or any one else can make out of it.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this he was neither proud nor depreciative of his people. He was\r\nsimply modest. Nor did he ever outgrow his sympathy with the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1809 was fruitful in the birth of great men in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace. In that year were born Charles Darwin, scientist, Alfred\r\nTennyson, poet, William E. Gladstone, statesman, and, not least,\r\nAbraham Lincoln, liberator.\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln was left fatherless in early boyhood, and grew up\r\nwithout any schooling or any definite work. For the most part he did\r\nodd jobs as they were offered. He called himself a carpenter. But in a\r\nday when the outfit of tools numbered only about a half dozen, and when\r\nevery man was mainly his own carpenter, this trade could not amount to\r\nmuch. Employment was unsteady and pay was small.\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln, after his marriage to Nancy Hanks, lived in\r\nElizabethtown, Ky., where the first child, Sarah, was born. Shortly\r\nafter this event he decided to combine farming with his trade of\r\ncarpentering, and so removed to a farm fourteen miles out, situated in\r\nwhat is now La Rue County, where his wife, on the twelfth day of\r\nFebruary, 1809, gave birth to the son who was named Abraham after his\r\ngrandfather. The child was born in a log cabin of a kind very common in\r\nthat day and for many years later. It was built four-square and\r\ncomprised only one room, one window, and a door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lincoln's Boyhood Home in Kentucky.]\r\n\r\nHere they lived for a little more than four years, when the father\r\nremoved to another farm about fifteen miles further to the northeast.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this removal and of the subsequent one, two or three\r\nyears later, was undoubtedly the uncertainty of land titles in Kentucky\r\nin that day. This \"roving disposition\" cannot fairly be charged to\r\nshiftlessness. In spite of the extraordinary disadvantages of Thomas\r\nLincoln's early life, he lived as well as his neighbors, though that\r\nwas humble enough, and accumulated a small amount of property in spite\r\nof the low rate of compensation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1816 Thomas determined to migrate to Indiana. He sold out\r\nhis farm, receiving for it the equivalent of $300. Of this sum, $20 was\r\nin cash and the rest was in whisky--ten barrels--which passed as a kind\r\nof currency in that day. He then loaded the bulk of his goods upon a\r\nflat boat, floating down the stream called Rolling Fork into Salt\r\nCreek, thence into the Ohio River, in fact, to the bottom of that\r\nriver. The watercourse was obstructed with stumps and snags of divers\r\nsorts, and especially with \"sawyers,\" or trees in the river which,\r\nforced by the current, make an up-and-down motion like that of a man\r\nsawing wood.\r\n\r\nThe flat boat became entangled in these obstructions and was upset, and\r\nthe cargo went to the bottom. By dint of great labor much of this was\r\nrescued and the travelers pushed on as far as Thompson's Ferry in Perry\r\nCounty, Indiana. There the cargo was left in the charge of friends, and\r\nLincoln returned for his family and the rest of his goods.\r\n\r\nDuring his father's absence, the boy Abe had his first observation of\r\nsorrow. A brother had been born in the cabin and had died in infancy.\r\nThe little grave was in the wilderness, and before leaving that country\r\nforever, the mother, leading her six-year-old boy by the hand, paid a\r\nfarewell visit to the grave. The child beheld with awe the silent grief\r\nof the mother and carried in his memory that scene to his dying day.\r\n\r\nThe father returned with glowing accounts of the new home. The family\r\nand the furniture,--to use so dignified a name for such meager\r\npossessions,--were loaded into a wagon or a cart, and they were soon on\r\nthe way to their new home.\r\n\r\nThe traveling was slow, but the weather was fine, the journey\r\nprosperous, and they arrived duly at their destination. They pushed\r\nnorthward, or back from the river, about eighteen miles into the woods\r\nand settled in Spencer County near to a hamlet named Gentryville. Here\r\nthey established their home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, of course, was to stake off the land, enter the claim,\r\nand pay the government fee at the United States Land Office at\r\nVincennes. The amount of land was one quarter section, or one hundred\r\nand sixty acres.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to erect a cabin. In this case the cabin consisted\r\nof what was called a half-faced camp. That is, the structure was\r\nentirely open on one of its four sides. This was at the lower side of\r\nthe roof, and the opening was partly concealed by the hanging of the\r\nskins of deer and other wild animals. This open face fully supplied all\r\nneed of door and window.\r\n\r\nThe structure was built four square, fourteen feet each way. Posts were\r\nset up at the corners, then the sides were made of poles placed as near\r\ntogether as possible. The interstices were filled in with chips and\r\nclay, which was called \"chinking.\" The fireplace and chimney were built\r\nat the back and outside. The chief advantage of this style of domicile\r\nis that it provides plenty of fresh air. With one side of the room\r\nentirely open, and with a huge fireplace at the other side, the\r\nsanitary problem of ventilation was solved.\r\n\r\nThere were no Brussels carpets, no Persian rugs, no hardwood floors.\r\nThe bare soil was pounded hard, and that was the floor. There were two\r\nbeds inn the two rear corners of the rooms. The corner position saved\r\nboth space and labor. Two sides of the bed were composed of parts of\r\nthe two walls. At the opposite angle a stake, with a forked top, was\r\ndriven into the ground, and from this to the walls were laid two poles\r\nat right angles. This made the frame of the bed. Then \"shakes,\" or\r\nlarge hand-made shingles, were placed crosswise. Upon these were laid\r\nthe ticks filled with feathers or corn husks, and the couch was\r\ncomplete. Not stylish, but healthful and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe produce of his farm was chiefly corn, though a little wheat was\r\nraised for a change of diet. Doubtless there were enough of the staple\r\nvegetables which grow easily in that country. Butcher shops were not\r\nneeded, owing to the abundance of wild game.\r\n\r\nThe principal portion of the life of the average boy concerns his\r\nschooling. As nearly as can be determined the aggregate of young\r\nLincoln's schooling was about one year, and this was divided between\r\nfive teachers--an average of less than three months to each--and spread\r\nout over as many years. The branches taught were \"readin', writin', and\r\ncipherin' to the rule of three.\" Any young man who happened along with\r\na fair knowledge of the three great R's--\"Readin', 'Ritin', and'\r\nRithmetic\"--was thought fit to set up a school, taking his small pay in\r\ncash and boarding around--that is, spending one day or more at a time\r\nas the guest of each of his patrons.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of special interest in any of these teachers, but\r\ntheir names are preserved simply because the fact that they did teach\r\nhim is a matter of great interest. The first teacher was Zachariah\r\nRiney, a Roman Catholic, from whose schoolroom the Protestants were\r\nexcluded, or excused, during the opening exercises. Then came Caleb\r\nHazel. These were in Kentucky, and therefore their instruction of\r\nLincoln must have come to an end by the time he was seven years old.\r\nWhen ten years old he studied under one Dorsey, when about fourteen\r\nunder Crawford, and when sixteen under Swaney.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that his mother's instruction was of more\r\nworth than all these put together. A woman who, under such limitations,\r\nhad energy enough to teach her husband to read and write, was a rare\r\ncharacter, and her influence could not be other than invaluable to the\r\nbright boy. Charles Lamb classified all literature in two divisions:\r\n\"Books that are not books, and books that are books.\" It is important\r\nthat every boy learn to read. But a far more important question is,\r\nWhat use does he make of his ability to read? Does he read \"books that\r\nare books?\" Let us now see what use Lincoln made of his knowledge of\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nIn those days books were rare and his library was small and select. It\r\nconsisted at first of three volumes: The Bible, Aesop's Fables and\r\nPilgrim's Progress. Some-time in the eighties a prominent magazine\r\npublished a series of articles written by men of eminence in the\r\nvarious walks of life, under the title of \"Books that have helped me.\"\r\nThe most noticeable fact was that each of these eminent men--men who\r\nhad read hundreds of books--specified not more than three or four\r\nbooks. Lincoln's first list was of three. They were emphatically books.\r\nDay after day he read, pondered and inwardly digested them until they\r\nwere his own. Better books he could not have found in all the\r\nuniversities of Europe, and we begin to understand where he got his\r\nmoral vision, his precision of English style, and his shrewd humor.\r\n\r\nLater he borrowed from a neighbor, Josiah Crawford, a copy of Weems'\r\nLife of Washington. In lieu of a bookcase he tucked this, one night,\r\ninto the chinking of the cabin. A rain-storm came up and soaked the\r\nbook through and through. By morning it presented a sorry appearance.\r\nThe damage was done and could not be repaired. Crestfallen the lad\r\ncarried it back to the owner and, having no money, offered to pay for\r\nthe mischief in work. Crawford agreed and named seventy-five cents (in\r\nlabor) as a fair sum.\r\n\r\n\"Does this pay for the book,\" the borrower asked, \"or only for the\r\ndamage to the book?\" Crawford reckoned that the book \"wa'n't of much\r\naccount to him nor to any one else.\" So Lincoln cheerfully did the\r\nwork--it was for three days--and owned the book.\r\n\r\nLater he had a life of Henry Clay, whom he nearly idolized. His one\r\npoet was Burns, whom he knew by heart \"from a to izzard.\" Throughout\r\nhis life he ranked Burns next to Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe hymns which he most loved must have had influence not only on his\r\nreligious spirit, but also on his literary taste. Those which are\r\nmentioned are, \"Am I a soldier of the cross?\" \"How tedious and\r\ntasteless the hours,\" \"There is a fountain filled with blood,\" and\r\n\"Alas, and did my Saviour bleed?\" Good hymns every one of them, in that\r\nday, or in any day.\r\n\r\nHaving no slate he did his \"sums\" in the sand on the ground, or on a\r\nwooden shovel which, after it was covered on both sides, he scraped\r\ndown so as to erase the work. A note-book is preserved, containing,\r\nalong with examples in arithmetic, this boyish doggerel:\r\n\r\n  Abraham Lincoln\r\n  his hand and pen\r\n  he will be good but\r\n  god knows When.\r\n\r\nThe penmanship bears a striking resemblance to that in later life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lincoln's Early Home In Indiana.]\r\n\r\nAbout a year after Thomas Lincoln's family settled in Indiana, they\r\nwere followed by some neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow and Dennis Hanks,\r\na child. To these the Lincolns surrendered their camp and built for\r\nthemselves a cabin, which was slightly more pretentious than the first.\r\nIt had an attic, and for a stairway there were pegs in the wall up\r\nwhich an active boy could readily climb. There was a stationary table,\r\nthe legs being driven into the ground, some three-legged stools, and a\r\nDutch oven.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1818 a mysterious epidemic passed over the region, working\r\nhavoc with men and cattle. It was called the \"milk-sick.\" Just what it\r\nwas physicians are unable to determine, but it was very destructive.\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were attacked. They were removed, for better\r\ncare, to the home of the Lincolns, where they shortly died. By this\r\ntime Mrs. Lincoln was down with the same scourge. There was no doctor\r\nto be had, the nearest one being thirty-five miles away. Probably it\r\nmade no difference. At all events she soon died and the future\r\npresident passed into his first sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe widowed husband was undertaker. With his own hands he \"rived\" the\r\nplanks, made the coffin, and buried Nancy Hanks, that remarkable woman.\r\nThere was no pastor, no funeral service. The grave was marked by a\r\nwooden slab, which, long years after, in 1879, was replaced by a stone\r\nsuitably inscribed.\r\n\r\nA traveling preacher known as Parson Elkin had occasionally preached in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Lincolns in Kentucky. The young boy now put to\r\nuse his knowledge of writing. He wrote a letter to the parson inviting\r\nhim to come over and preach the funeral sermon. How he contrived to get\r\nthe letter to its destination we do not know, but it was done. The\r\nkind-hearted preacher cheerfully consented, though it involved a long\r\nand hard journey. He came at his earliest convenience, which was some\r\ntime the next year.\r\n\r\nThere was no church in which to hold the service. Lincoln never saw a\r\nchurch building of any description until he was grown. But the\r\nneighbors to the number of about two hundred assembled under the trees,\r\nwhere the parson delivered the memorial sermon.\r\n\r\nLincoln was nine years old when his mother died, October 5th, 1818. Her\r\nlot was hard, her horizon was narrow, her opportunities were\r\nrestricted, her life was one of toil and poverty. All through her life\r\nand after her untimely death, many people would have said that she had\r\nhad at best but a poor chance in the world. Surely no one would have\r\npredicted that her name would come to be known and reverenced from\r\nocean to ocean. But she was faithful, brave, cheerful. She did her duty\r\nlovingly. In later years the nation joined with her son in paying honor\r\nto the memory of this noble, overworked, uncomplaining woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIN INDIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of his wife had left Thomas Lincoln with the care of three\r\nyoung children: namely, Sarah, about eleven years old, Abe, ten years\r\nold, and the foster brother, Dennis (Friend) Hanks, a year or two\r\nyounger. The father was not able to do woman's work as well as his wife\r\nhad been able to do man's work, and the condition of the home was\r\npitiable indeed. To the three motherless children and the bereaved\r\nfather it was a long and dreary winter. When spring came they had the\r\nbenefits of life in the woods and fields, and so lived through the\r\nseason until the edge of the following winter. It is not to be wondered\r\nat that the father was unwilling to repeat the loneliness of the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1819, he returned to Elizabethtown, Ky., and\r\nproposed marriage to a widow, Mrs. Sally Bush Johnston. The proposal\r\nmust have been direct, with few preliminaries or none, for the couple\r\nwere married next morning. The new wife brought him a fortune, in\r\naddition to three children of various ages, of sundry articles of\r\nhousehold furniture. Parents, children, and goods were shortly after\r\nloaded into a wagon drawn by a four-horse team, and in all the style of\r\nthis frontier four-in-hand, were driven over indescribable roads,\r\nthrough woods and fields, to their Indiana home.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Sally Bush's furniture made an important improvement\r\nin the home. What was more important, she had her husband finish the\r\nlog cabin by providing window, door, and floor. What was most important\r\nof all, she brought the sweet spirit of an almost ideal motherhood into\r\nthe home, giving to all the children alike a generous portion of\r\nmother-love.\r\n\r\nThe children now numbered six, and not only were they company for one\r\nanother, but the craving for womanly affection, which is the most\r\npersistent hunger of the heart of child or man, was beautifully met.\r\nShe did not humor them to the point of idleness, but wisely ruled with\r\nstrictness without imperiousness. She kept them from bad habits and\r\nretained their affection to the last. The influence upon the growing\r\nlad of two such women as Nancy Hanks and Sally Bush was worth more than\r\nthat of the best appointed college in all the land.\r\n\r\nThe boy grew into youth, and he grew very fast. While still in his\r\nteens he reached the full stature of his manhood, six feet and four\r\ninches. His strength was astonishing, and many stories were told of\r\nthis and subsequent periods to illustrate his physical prowess, such\r\nas: he once lifted up a hencoop weighing six hundred pounds and carried\r\nit off bodily; he could lift a full barrel of cider to his mouth and\r\ndrink from the bung-hole; he could sink an ax-halve deeper into a log\r\nthan any man in the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of his growth into youth he spent much of his time in\r\nreading, talking, and, after a fashion, making speeches. He also wrote\r\nsome. His political writings won great admiration from his neighbors.\r\nHe occasionally wrote satires which, while not refined, were very\r\nstinging. This would not be worth mentioning were it not for the fact\r\nthat it shows that from boyhood he knew the force of this formidable\r\nweapon which later he used with so much skill. The country store\r\nfurnished the frontier substitute for the club, and there the men were\r\nwont to congregate. It is needless to say that young Lincoln was the\r\nlife of the gatherings, being an expert in the telling of a humorous\r\nstory and having always a plentiful supply. His speech-making proved so\r\nattractive that his father was forced to forbid him to practise it\r\nduring working hours because the men would always leave their work to\r\nlisten to him.\r\n\r\nDuring these years he had no regular employment, but did odd jobs\r\nwherever he got a chance. At one time, for example, he worked on a\r\nferryboat for the munificent wages of thirty-seven and one half cents a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen sixteen years old, Lincoln had his first lesson in oratory. He\r\nattended court at Boonville, county seat of Warwick County and heard a\r\ncase in which one of the aristocratic Breckenridges of Kentucky was\r\nattorney for the defense. The power of his oratory was a revelation to\r\nthe lad. At its conclusion the awkward, ill-dressed, bashful but\r\nenthusiastic young Lincoln pressed forward to offer his congratulations\r\nand thanks to the eloquent lawyer, who haughtily brushed by him without\r\naccepting the proffered hand. In later years the men met again, this\r\ntime in Washington City, in the white house. The president reminded\r\nBreckenridge of the incident which the latter had no desire to recall.\r\n\r\nWhen about nineteen years old, he made his first voyage down the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi rivers. Two incidents are worth recording of this trip.\r\nThe purpose was to find, in New Orleans, a market for produce, which\r\nwas simply floated down stream on a flat-boat. There was, of course, a\r\nrow-boat for tender. The crew consisted of himself and young Gentry,\r\nson of his employer.\r\n\r\nNear Baton Rouge they had tied up for the night in accordance with the\r\ncustom of flat-boat navigation. During the night they were awakened by\r\na gang of seven ruffian negroes who had come aboard to loot the stuff.\r\nLincoln shouted \"Who's there?\" Receiving no reply he seized a handspike\r\nand knocked over the first, second, third, and fourth in turn, when the\r\nremaining three took to the woods. The two northerners pursued them a\r\nshort distance, then returned, loosed their craft and floated safely to\r\ntheir destination.\r\n\r\nIt was on this trip that Lincoln earned his first dollar, as he in\r\nafter years related to William H. Seward:\r\n\r\n\"... A steamer was going down the river. We have, you know, no wharves\r\non the western streams, and the custom was, if passengers were at any\r\nof the landings, they were to go out in a boat, the steamer stopping\r\nand taking them on board.... Two men with trunks came down to the shore\r\nin carriages, and looking at the different boats, singled out mine, and\r\nasked, 'Who owns this?' I modestly answered, 'I do.' 'Will you take us\r\nand our trunks out to the steamer?' 'Certainly.'... The trunks were put\r\nin my boat, the passengers seated themselves on them, and I sculled\r\nthem out to the steamer. They got on board, and I lifted the trunks and\r\nput them on the deck. The steamer was about to put on steam again, when\r\nI called out: 'You have forgotten to pay me.' Each of them took from\r\nhis pocket a silver half dollar and threw it on the bottom of my boat.\r\nI could scarcely believe my eyes as I picked up the money. You may\r\nthink it was a very little thing, and in these days it seems to me like\r\na trifle, but it was a most important incident in my life. I could\r\nscarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar in less than a\r\nday; that by honest work I had earned a dollar. I was a more hopeful\r\nand thoughtful boy from that time.\"\r\n\r\nThe goods were sold profitably at New Orleans and the return trip was\r\nmade by steamboat. This was about twenty years after Fulton's first\r\nvoyage from New York to Albany, which required seven days. Steamboats\r\nhad been put on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, but these crafts were\r\nof primitive construction--awkward as to shape and slow as to speed.\r\nThe frequency of boiler explosions was proverbial for many years. The\r\nlads, Gentry and Lincoln, returned home duly and the employer was well\r\nsatisfied with the results of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the epidemic \"milk sick\" reappeared in Indiana, and Thomas\r\nLincoln had a pardonable desire to get out of the country. Illinois was\r\nat that time settling up rapidly and there were glowing accounts of its\r\ndesirableness. Thomas Lincoln's decision to move on to the new land of\r\npromise was reasonable. He sold out and started with his family and\r\nhousehold goods to his new destination. The time of year was March,\r\njust when the frost is coming out of the ground so that the mud is\r\napparently bottomless. The author will not attempt to describe it, for\r\nhe has in boyhood seen it many times and knows it to be indescribable.\r\nIt was Abe's duty to drive the four yoke of oxen, a task which must\r\nhave strained even his patience.\r\n\r\nThey settled in Macon County, near Decatur. There the son faithfully\r\nworked with his father until the family was fairly settled, then\r\nstarted out in life for himself. For he had now reached the age of\r\ntwenty-one. As he had passed through the periods of childhood and\r\nyouth, and was on the threshold of manhood, it is right and fitting to\r\nreceive at this point the testimony of Sally Bush, his stepmother:\r\n\r\n\"Abe was a good boy, and I can say what scarcely one woman--a mother--\r\ncan say in a thousand: Abe never gave me a cross word or look, and\r\nnever refused, in fact or appearance, to do anything I requested him. I\r\nnever gave him a cross word in all my life.... He was a dutiful son to\r\nme always. I think he loved me truly. I had a son John who was raised\r\nwith Abe. Both were good boys; but I must say, both being now dead,\r\nthat Abe was the best boy I ever saw, or expect to see.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of praise redound to the honor of the speaker equally with\r\nthat of her illustrious stepson.\r\n\r\nLincoln came into the estate of manhood morally clean. He had formed no\r\nhabits that would cause years of struggle to overcome, he had committed\r\nno deed that would bring the blush of shame to his cheek, he was as\r\nfree from vice as from crime. He was not profane, he had never tasted\r\nliquor, he was no brawler, he never gambled, he was honest and\r\ntruthful. On the other hand, he had a genius for making friends, he was\r\nthe center of every social circle, he was a good talker and a close\r\nreasoner. Without a thought of the great responsibilities awaiting him,\r\nhe had thus far fitted himself well by his faithfulness in such duties\r\nas fell to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSECOND JOURNEY TO NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first winter in Illinois, 1830-31, was one of those epochal seasons\r\nwhich come to all communities. It is remembered by \"the oldest\r\ninhabitant\" to this day for the extraordinary amount of snow that fell.\r\nThere is little doing in such a community during any winter; but in\r\nsuch a winter as that there was practically nothing doing. Lincoln\r\nalways held himself ready to accept any opportunity for work, but there\r\nwas no opening that winter. The only thing he accomplished was what he\r\ndid every winter and every summer of his life: namely, he made many\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWhen spring opened, Denton Offutt decided to send a cargo of\r\nmerchandise down to New Orleans. Hearing that Lincoln, John Hanks, and\r\nJohn Johnston were \"likely boys,\" he employed them to take charge of\r\nthe enterprise. Their pay was to be fifty cents a day and \"found,\" and,\r\nif the enterprise proved successful, an additional sum of twenty\r\ndollars. Lincoln said that none of them had ever seen so much money at\r\none time, and they were glad to accept the offer.\r\n\r\nTwo events occurred during this trip which are of sufficient interest\r\nto bear narration.\r\n\r\nThe boat with its cargo had been set afloat in the Sangamon River at\r\nSpringfield. All went well until, at New Salem, they came to a mill dam\r\nwhere, in spite of the fact that the water was high, owing to the\r\nspring floods, the boat stuck. Lincoln rolled his trousers \"five feet\r\nmore or less\" up his long, lank legs, waded out to the boat, and got\r\nthe bow over the dam. Then, without waiting to bail the water out, he\r\nbored a hole in the bottom and let it run out. He constructed a machine\r\nwhich lifted and pushed the boat over the obstruction, and thus their\r\nvoyage was quickly resumed. Many years later, when he was a practising\r\nlawyer, he whittled out a model of his invention and had it patented.\r\nThe model may to-day be seen in the patent office at Washington. The\r\npatent brought him no fortune, but it is an interesting relic.\r\n\r\nThis incident is of itself entirely unimportant. It is narrated here\r\nsolely because it illustrates one trait of the man--his ingenuity. He\r\nhad remarkable fertility in devising ways and means of getting out of\r\nunexpected difficulties. When, in 1860, the Ship of State seemed like\r\nto run aground hopelessly, it was his determination and ingenuity that\r\naverted total wreck. As in his youth he saved the flatboat, so in his\r\nmature years he saved the nation.\r\n\r\nThe other event was that at New Orleans, where he saw with his own eyes\r\nsome of the horrors of slavery. He never could tolerate a moral wrong.\r\nAt a time when drinking was almost universal, he was a total abstainer.\r\nThough born in a slave state, he had an earnest and growing repugnance\r\nto slavery. Still, up to this time he had never seen much of its\r\nworkings. At this time he saw a slave market--the auctioning off of\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nThe details of this auction were so coarse and vile that it is\r\nimpossible to defile these pages with an accurate and faithful\r\ndescription. Lincoln saw it all. He saw a beautiful mulatto girl\r\nexhibited like a race-horse, her \"points\" dwelt on, one by one, in\r\norder, as the auctioneer said, that \"bidders might satisfy themselves\r\nwhether the article they were offering to buy was sound or not.\" One of\r\nhis companions justly said slavery ran the iron into him then and\r\nthere. His soul was stirred with a righteous indignation. Turning to\r\nthe others he exclaimed with a solemn oath: \"Boys, if ever I get a\r\nchance to hit that thing [slavery] I'll hit it hard!\"\r\n\r\nHe bided his time. One-third of a century later he had the chance to\r\nhit that thing. He redeemed his oath. He hit it hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDESULTORY EMPLOYMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the Lincoln family in Illinois, they had the few\r\ntools which would be considered almost necessary to every frontiersman:\r\nnamely, a common ax, broad-ax, hand-saw, whip-saw. The mauls and wedges\r\nwere of wood and were made by each workman for himself. To this stock\r\nof tools may also be added a small supply of nails brought from\r\nIndiana, for at that period nails were very expensive and used with the\r\nstrictest economy. By means of pegs and other devices people managed to\r\nget along without them.\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham Lincoln went to New Salem it was (like all frontier towns)\r\na promising place. It grew until it had the enormous population of\r\nabout one hundred people, housed--or log-cabined--in fifteen primitive\r\nstructures. The tributary country was not very important in a\r\ncommercial sense. To this population no less than four general stores--\r\nthat is, stores containing nearly everything that would be needed in\r\nthat community--offered their wares.\r\n\r\nThe town flourished, at least it lived, about through the period that\r\nLincoln dwelt there, after which it disappeared.\r\n\r\nLincoln was ready to take any work that would get him a living. A\r\nneighbor advised him to make use of his great strength in the work of a\r\nblacksmith. He seriously thought of learning the trade, but was,\r\nfortunately for the country, diverted from doing so.\r\n\r\nThe success of the expedition to New Orleans had won the admiration of\r\nhis employer, Denton Offutt, and he now offered Lincoln a clerkship in\r\nhis prospective store. The offer was accepted partly because it gave\r\nhim some time to read, and it was here that he came to know the two\r\ngreat poets, Burns and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nOffutt's admiration of the young clerk did him credit, but his voluble\r\nexpression of it was not judicious. He bragged that Lincoln was smart\r\nenough to be president, and that he could run faster, jump higher,\r\nthrow farther, and \"wrastle\" better than any man in the country. In the\r\nneighborhood there was a gang of rowdies, kind at heart but very rough,\r\nknown as \"the Clary's Grove boys.\" They took the boasting of Offutt as\r\na direct challenge to themselves and eagerly accepted it. So they put\r\nup a giant by the name of Jack Armstrong as their champion and arranged\r\na \"wrastling\" match. All went indifferently for a while until Lincoln\r\nseemed to be getting the better of his antagonist, when the \"boys\"\r\ncrowded in and interfered while Armstrong attempted a foul. Instantly\r\nLincoln was furious. Putting forth all his strength he lifted Jack up\r\nand shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. The crowd, in their turn,\r\nbecame angry and set out to mob him. He backed up against a wall and in\r\nhot indignation awaited the onset. Armstrong was the first to recover\r\nhis good sense. Exclaiming, \"Boys, Abe Lincoln's the best fellow that\r\never broke into the settlement,\" he held out his hand to Lincoln who\r\nreceived it with perfect good nature. From that day these boys never\r\nlost their admiration for him. He was their hero. From that day, too,\r\nhe became the permanent umpire, the general peacemaker of the region.\r\nHis good nature, his self-command, and his manifest fairness placed his\r\ndecisions beyond question. His popularity was established once for all\r\nin the entire community.\r\n\r\nThere are some, anecdotes connected with his work in the store which\r\nare worth preserving because they illustrate traits of his character.\r\nHe once sold a half pound of tea to a customer. The next morning as he\r\nwas tidying up the store he saw, by the weights which remained in the\r\nscales, that he had inadvertently given her four, instead of eight,\r\nounces. He instantly weighed out the balance and carried it to her, not\r\nwaiting for his breakfast.\r\n\r\nAt another time when he counted up his cash at night he discovered that\r\nhe had charged a customer an excess of six and a quarter cents. He\r\nclosed up the store at once and walked to the home of the customer, and\r\nreturned the money. It was such things as these, in little matters as\r\nwell as great, that gave him the nickname of \"honest Abe\" which, to his\r\nhonor be it said, clung to him through life.\r\n\r\nOne incident illustrates his chivalry. While he was waiting upon some\r\nwomen, a ruffian came into the store using vulgar language. Lincoln\r\nasked him to desist, but he became more abusive than ever. After the\r\nwomen had gone, Lincoln took him out of the store, threw him on the\r\nground, rubbed smartweed in his face and eyes until he howled for\r\nmercy, and then he gave him a lecture which did him more practical good\r\nthan a volume of Chesterfield's letters.\r\n\r\nSome time after Offutt's store had \"winked out,\" while Lincoln was\r\nlooking for employment there came a chance to buy one half interest in\r\na store, the other half being owned by an idle, dissolute fellow named\r\nBerry who ultimately drank himself into his grave. Later, another\r\nopening came in the following way: the store of one Radford had been\r\nwrecked by the horse-play of some ruffians, and the lot was bought by\r\nMr. Greene for four hundred dollars. He employed Lincoln to make an\r\ninvoice of the goods and he in turn offered Greene two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars for the bargain and the offer was accepted. But even that\r\nwas not the last investment. The fourth and only remaining store in the\r\nhamlet was owned by one Rutledge. This also was bought out by the firm\r\nof Berry & Lincoln. Thus they came to have the monopoly of the\r\nmercantile business in the hamlet of New Salem.\r\n\r\nBe it known that in all these transactions not a dollar in money\r\nchanged hands. Men bought with promissory notes and sold for the same\r\nconsideration. The mercantile venture was not successful. Berry was\r\ndrinking and loafing, and Lincoln, who did not work as faithfully for\r\nhimself as for another, was usually reading or telling stories. So when\r\na couple of strangers, Trent by name, offered to buy out the store, the\r\noffer was accepted and more promissory notes changed hands. About the\r\ntime these last notes came due, the Trent brothers disappeared between\r\ntwo days. Then Berry died.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the whole series of transactions was that Lincoln was\r\nleft with an assortment of promissory notes bearing the names of the\r\nHerndons, Radford, Greene, Rutledge, Berry, and the Trents. With one\r\nexception, which will be duly narrated, his creditors told him to pay\r\nwhen he was able. He promised to put all of his earnings, in excess of\r\nmodest living expenses, into the payment of these obligations. It was\r\nthe burden of many years and he always called it \"the national debt.\"\r\nBut he kept his word, paying both principal and the high rate of\r\ninterest until 1848, or after fifteen years, when a member of congress,\r\nhe paid the last cent. He was still \"honest Abe.\" This narrative ranks\r\nthe backwoodsman with Sir Walter Scott and Mark Twain, though no\r\ndinners were tendered to him and no glowing eulogies were published\r\nfrom ocean to ocean.\r\n\r\nHis only further experience in navigation was the piloting of a\r\nCincinnati steamboat, the _Talisman_, up the Sangamon River (during the\r\nhigh water in spring time) to show that that stream was navigable.\r\nNothing came of it however, and Springfield was never made \"the head of\r\nnavigation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of the mercantile experiences above narrated that\r\nthe Black Hawk war broke out. Black Hawk was chief of the Sac Indians,\r\nwho, with some neighboring tribes, felt themselves wronged by the\r\nwhites. Some of them accordingly put on the paint, raised the whoop,\r\nand entered the warpath in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.\r\nThe governor called for soldiers, and Lincoln volunteered with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe election of captain of the company was according to an original\r\nmethod. The two candidates were placed a short distance apart and the\r\nmen were invited to line up with one or the other according to their\r\npreference. When this had been done it was seen that Lincoln had about\r\nthree quarters of the men. This testimony to his popularity was\r\ngratifying. After he became president of the United States he declared\r\nthat no success that ever came to him gave him so much solid\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLincoln saw almost nothing of the war. His only casualty came after its\r\nclose. He had been mustered out and his horse was stolen so that he was\r\ncompelled to walk most of the way home. After the expiration of his\r\nterm of enlistment he reenlisted as a private. As he saw no fighting\r\nthe war was to him almost literally a picnic. But in 1848, when he was\r\nin congress, the friends of General Cass were trying to make political\r\ncapital out of his alleged military services. This brought from Lincoln\r\na speech which showed that he had not lost the power of satire which he\r\npossessed while a lad in Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know, Mr. Speaker, I am a military hero? In the days of the\r\nBlack Hawk war I fought, bled, and--came away. I was not at Stillman's\r\ndefeat, but I was about as near it as General Cass was to Hull's\r\nsurrender; and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards. It is\r\nquite certain I did not break my sword, for I had none to break, but I\r\nbent my musket pretty bad on one occasion. If General Cass went in\r\nadvance of me picking whortleberries, I guess I surpassed him in\r\ncharges on the wild onions. If he saw any live fighting Indians, it was\r\nmore than I did, but I had a good many bloody struggles with the\r\nmosquitoes; and although I never fainted from loss of blood, I can\r\ntruly say I was often very hungry. If ever I should conclude to doff\r\nwhatever our Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade\r\nFederalism about me, and thereupon they shall take me up as their\r\ncandidate for the Presidency, I protest that they shall not make fun of\r\nme, as they have of General Cass, by attempting to write me into a\r\nmilitary hero.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Lincoln was appointed postmaster at New Salem. To him the chief\r\nadvantage of this position was the fact that it gave him the means of\r\nreading the papers. The principal one of these was the Louisville\r\n_Journal_, an exceedingly able paper, for it was in charge of\r\nGeorge D. Prentice, one of the ablest editors this country has ever\r\nproduced. The duties of the post-office were few because the mail was\r\nlight. The occasional letters which came were usually carried around by\r\nthe postmaster in his hat. When one asked for his mail, he would\r\ngravely remove his hat and search through the package of letters.\r\n\r\nThis office was discontinued in a short time, but no agent of the\r\ngovernment came to close up the accounts. Years afterwards, when\r\nLincoln was in Springfield, the officer suddenly appeared and demanded\r\nthe balance due to the United States, the amount being seventeen\r\ndollars and a few cents. A friend who was by, knowing that Lincoln was\r\nshort of funds, in order to save him from embarrassment, offered to\r\nlend him the needful sum. \"Hold on a minute and let's see how we come\r\nout,\" said he. He went to his room and returned with an old rag\r\ncontaining money. This he counted out, being the exact sum to a cent.\r\nIt was all in small denominations of silver and copper, just as it had\r\nbeen received. In all his emergencies of need he had never touched this\r\nsmall fund which he held in trust. To him it was sacred. He was still\r\n\"honest Abe.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early thirties, when the state of Illinois was being settled\r\nwith great rapidity, the demand for surveyors was greater than the\r\nsupply. John Calhoun, surveyor for the government, was in urgent need\r\nof a deputy, and Lincoln was named as a man likely to be able to fit\r\nhimself for the duties on short notice. He was appointed. He borrowed\r\nthe necessary book and went to work in dead earnest to learn the\r\nscience. Day and night he studied until his friends, noticing the\r\nwearing effect on his health, became alarmed. But by the end of six\r\nweeks, an almost incredibly brief period of time, he was ready for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that his outfit was of the simplest description, and\r\nthere is a tradition that at first, instead of a surveyor's chain he\r\nused a long, straight, wild-grape vine. Those who understand the\r\nconditions and requirements of surveying in early days say that this is\r\nnot improbable. A more important fact is that Lincoln's surveys have\r\nnever been called in question, which is something that can be said of\r\nfew frontier surveyors. Though he learned the science in so short a\r\ntime, yet here, as always, he was thorough.\r\n\r\nIt was said in the earlier part of this chapter that to the holders of\r\nLincoln's notes who consented to await his ability to pay, there was\r\none exception. One man, when his note fell due, seized horse and\r\ninstruments, and put a temporary stop to his surveying. But a neighbor\r\nbought these in and returned them to Lincoln. He never forgot the\r\nkindness of this man, James Short by name, and thirty years later\r\nappointed him Indian agent.\r\n\r\nAt this point may be mentioned an occurrence which took place a year or\r\ntwo later. It was his first romance of love, his engagement to a\r\nbeautiful girl, Ann Rutledge, and his bereavement. Her untimely death\r\nnearly unsettled his mind. He was afflicted with melancholy to such a\r\ndegree that his friends dared not leave him alone. For years afterwards\r\nthe thought of her would shake his whole frame with emotion, and he\r\nwould sit with his face buried in his hands while the tears trickled\r\nthrough. A friend once begged him to try to forget his sorrow. \"I\r\ncannot,\" he said; \"the thought of the rain and snow on her grave fills\r\nme with indescribable grief.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, we know not how, the poem \"Oh, why should the spirit of mortal\r\nbe proud?\" was in his mind connected with Ann Rutledge. Possibly it may\r\nhave been a favorite with her. There was certainly some association,\r\nand through his whole life he was fond of it and often repeated it. Nor\r\ndid he forget her. It was late in life that he said: \"I really and\r\ntruly loved the girl and think often of her now.\" Then, after a pause,\r\n\"And I have loved the name of Rutledge to this day.\"\r\n\r\nThis bereavement took much from Lincoln. Did it give him nothing?\r\nPatience, earnestness, tenderness, sympathy--these are sometimes the\r\ngifts which are sent by the messenger Sorrow. We are justified in\r\nbelieving that this sad event was one of the means of ripening the\r\ncharacter of this great man, and that to it was due a measure of his\r\nusefulness in his mature years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nENTERING POLITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's duties at New Salem, as clerk, storekeeper, and postmaster,\r\nhad resulted in an intimate acquaintance with the people of that\r\ngeneral locality. His duties as surveyor took him into the outlying\r\ndistricts. His social instincts won for him friends wherever he was\r\nknown, while his sterling character gave him an influence unusual, both\r\nin kind and in measure, for a young man of his years. He had always\r\npossessed an interest in public, even national, questions, and his\r\nfondness for debate and speech-making increased this interest. Moreover\r\nhe had lived month by month going from one job to another, and had not\r\nyet found his permanent calling.\r\n\r\nWhen this combination of facts is recalled, it is a foregone conclusion\r\nthat he would sooner or later enter politics. This he did at the age of\r\ntwenty-three, in 1832.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of the day he announced in the spring his\r\ncandidacy. After this was done the Black Hawk war called him off the\r\nground and he did not get back until about ten days before the\r\nelection, so that he had almost no time to attend to the canvass. One\r\nincident of this campaign is preserved which is interesting, partly\r\nbecause it concerns the first known speech Lincoln ever made in his own\r\nbehalf, and chiefly because it was an exhibition of his character.\r\n\r\nHe was speaking at a place called Cappsville when two men in the\r\naudience got into a scuffle.\r\n\r\nLincoln proceeded in his speech until it became evident that his friend\r\nwas getting the worst of the scuffle, when he descended from the\r\nplatform, seized the antagonist and threw him ten or twelve feet away\r\non the ground, and then remounted the platform and took up his speech\r\nwhere he had left off without a break in the logic.\r\n\r\nThe methods of electioneering are given by Miss Tarbell in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"Wherever he saw a crowd of men he joined them, and he never failed to\r\nadapt himself to their point of view in asking for votes. If the degree\r\nof physical strength was the test for a candidate, he was ready to lift\r\na weight, or wrestle with the countryside champion; if the amount of\r\ngrain a man could cut would recommend him, he seized the cradle and\r\nshowed the swath he could cut\" (I. 109).\r\n\r\nThe ten days devoted to the canvass were not enough, and he was\r\ndefeated. The vote against him was chiefly in the outlying region where\r\nhe was little known. It must have been gratifying to him that in his\r\nown precinct, where he was so well known, he received the almost\r\nunanimous vote of all parties. Biographers differ as to the precise\r\nnumber of votes in the New Salem precinct, but by Nicolay and Hay it is\r\ngiven as 277 for, and three against. Of this election Lincoln himself\r\n(speaking in the third person) said: \"This was the only time Abraham\r\nwas ever defeated on the direct vote of the people.\"\r\n\r\nHis next political experience was a candidacy for the legislature 1834.\r\nAt this time, as before, he announced his own candidacy. But not as\r\nbefore, he at this time made a diligent canvass of the district. When\r\nthe election came off he was not only successful but he ran ahead of\r\nhis ticket. He usually did run ahead of his ticket excepting when\r\nrunning for the presidency, and then it was from the nature of the case\r\nimpossible. Though Lincoln probably did not realize it, this, his first\r\nelection, put an end forever to his drifting, desultory, frontier life.\r\nUp to this point he was always looking for a job. From this time on he\r\nwas not passing from one thing to another. In this country politics and\r\nlaw are closely allied. This two-fold pursuit, politics, for the sake\r\nof law, and law for the sake of politics, constituted Lincoln's\r\nvocation for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Illinois was Vandalia, a village said to be named after\r\nthe Vandals by innocent citizens who were pleased with the euphony of\r\nthe word hut did not know who the Vandals were. Outwardly the village\r\nwas crude and forbidding, and many of the Solons were attired in coon-\r\nskin caps and other startling apparel. The fashionable clothing, the\r\none which came to be generally adopted as men grew to be \"genteel,\" was\r\nblue jeans. Even \"store clothes,\" as they came to be called, were as\r\nyet comparatively unknown.\r\n\r\nBut one must not be misled by appearances in a frontier town. The\r\nfrontier life has a marvelous influence in developing brains. It is as\r\nhard for some people in the centers of culture to believe in the\r\npossible intelligence of the frontier, as it was in 1776 for the\r\ncultured Englishmen to believe in the intelligence of the colonial\r\npatriots. In that collection of men at Vandalia were more than a few\r\nwho afterwards came to have national influence and reputation.\r\n\r\nApart from Lincoln himself, the most prominent member of the\r\nlegislature was his lifelong antagonist, Stephen A. Douglas. Whatever\r\nmay be said of this man's political principles, there can be no\r\nquestion as to the shrewdness of his political methods. It is the\r\nopinion of the present writer that in the entire history of our\r\npolitical system no man has ever surpassed him in astuteness. Even to-\r\nday all parties are using the methods which he either devised or\r\nintroduced. The trouble with him was that he was on the wrong side. He\r\ndid not count sufficiently on the conscience of the nation.\r\n\r\nLincoln was re-elected to the legislature as often as he was willing to\r\nbe a candidate, and served continuously for eight years. One session is\r\nmuch like another, and in this eight years of legislative experience\r\nonly two prominent facts will be narrated. One was the removal of the\r\ncapital to Springfield. To Lincoln was entrusted the difficult task--\r\ndifficult, because there were almost as many applications for the honor\r\nof being the capital city as there were towns and villages in the\r\ncentral part of the state. He was entirely successful, and\r\nthenceforward he was inseparably connected with Springfield. It was his\r\nhome as long as he lived, and there his remains were buried.\r\n\r\nThe prophetic event of his legislative work was what is known as the\r\nLincoln-Stone protest. This looks to-day so harmless that it is not\r\neasy to understand the situation in 1837. The pro-slavery feeling was\r\nrunning high, an abolitionist was looked on as a monster and a menace\r\nto national law and order. It was in that year that the Reverend Elijah\r\nP. Lovejoy was murdered--martyred--at Alton, Ill. The legislature had\r\npassed pro-slavery resolutions. There were many in the legislature who\r\ndid not approve of these, but in the condition of public feeling, it\r\nwas looked on as political suicide to express opposition openly. There\r\nwas no politic reason why Lincoln should protest. His protest could do\r\nno practical good. To him it was solely a matter of conscience. Slavery\r\nwas wrong, the resolutions were wrong, and to him it became necessary\r\nto enter the protest. He succeeded in getting but one man to join him,\r\nand he did so because he was about to withdraw from politics and\r\ntherefore had nothing to lose. Here is the document as it was spread on\r\nthe journal:\r\n\r\n\"Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both\r\nbranches of the General Assembly at its present session, the\r\nundersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both\r\ninjustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation of abolition\r\ndoctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power under\r\nthe Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power,\r\nunder the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nbut that the power ought not to be exercised, unless at the request of\r\nthe people of the District.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between these opinions and those contained in the above\r\nresolutions is their reason for entering this protest.\"\r\n\r\n  (Signed)\r\n  DAN STONE,\r\n  A. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n  \"Representatives from the county of Sangamon.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Lincoln made an electioneering speech which was fortunately\r\nheard by Joshua Speed, and he has given an account of it. Be it\r\nremembered that at that time lightning rods were rare and attracted an\r\nunreasonable amount of attention. One Forquer, who was Lincoln's\r\nopponent, had recently rodded his house--and every one knew it. This\r\nman's speech consisted partly in ridiculing his opponent, his bigness,\r\nhis awkwardness, his dress, his youth. Lincoln heard him through\r\nwithout interruption and then took the stand and said:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman commenced his speech by saying that this young man would\r\nhave to be taken down, and he was sorry the task devolved upon him. I\r\nam not so young in years as I am in the tricks and trades of a\r\npolitician; but live long or die young, I would rather die now than,\r\nlike the gentleman, change my politics and simultaneous with the change\r\nreceive an office worth three thousand dollars a year, and then have to\r\nerect a lightning-rod over my house to protect a guilty conscience from\r\nan offended God.\"\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that that speech clung to its victim like a\r\nburr. Wherever he went, some one would be found to tell about the\r\nguilty conscience and the lightning-rod. The house and its lightning-\r\nrod were long a center of interest in Springfield. Visitors to the city\r\nwere taken to see the house and its lightning-rod, while the story was\r\ntold with great relish.\r\n\r\nHaving served eight terms in the legislature, Lincoln in 1842 aspired\r\nto congress. He was, however, defeated at the primary. His neighbors\r\nadded insult to injury by making him one of the delegates to the\r\nconvention and instructing him to vote for his successful rival, Baker.\r\nThis did not interrupt the friendship which united the two for many\r\nyears, lasting, indeed, until the death of Colonel Baker on the field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 he renewed his candidacy, and this time with flattering\r\nsuccess. His opponent was a traveling preacher, Peter Cartwright, who\r\nwas widely known in the state and had not a little persuasive power. In\r\nthis contest Cartwright's \"arguments\" were two: the first, that Lincoln\r\nwas an atheist, and the second that he was an aristocrat. These\r\n\"arguments\" were not convincing, and Lincoln was elected by a handsome\r\nmajority, running far ahead of his ticket. This was, at the time, the\r\nheight of his ambition, yet he wrote to Mr. Speed: \"Being elected to\r\ncongress, though I am grateful to our friends for having done it, has\r\nnot pleased me as much as I expected.\"\r\n\r\nHis one term in congress was uneventful. Twice his humor bubbled over.\r\nOnce was when he satirized the claims that Cass was a military hero, in\r\nthe speech already mentioned. The other time was his introducing the\r\nresolutions known as the \"spot resolutions.\" The president had sent to\r\ncongress an inflammatory, buncombe message, in which he insisted that\r\nthe war had been begun by Mexico, \"by invading our territory and\r\nshedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil.\" The resolutions\r\nrequested from the president the information:\r\n\r\n\"_First_. Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed,\r\nas in his messages declared, was or was not within the territory of\r\nSpain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican\r\nrevolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Second_. Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which\r\nwas wrested from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Third_. Whether the spot is or is not, etc., etc. It is the\r\nrecurrence of the word _spot_ which gave the name to the resolutions.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln had now served eight years in the legislature and one term in\r\ncongress. He had a good understanding of politics. He was never a time-\r\nserver, and he had done nothing unwise. He knew how to win votes and he\r\nknew what to do with himself when the votes were won. He held the\r\nconfidence of his constituency. His was a constantly growing\r\npopularity. He could do everything but one,--he could not dishonor his\r\nconscience. His belief that \"slavery was founded on injustice\" was the\r\nonly reason for his protest. He never hesitated to protest against\r\ninjustice. The Golden Rule had a place in practical politics. The\r\nSermon on the Mount was not an iridescent dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nENTERING THE LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn treating of this topic, it will be necessary to recall certain\r\nthings already mentioned. One characteristic which distinguished\r\nLincoln all through his life was thoroughness. When he was President a\r\nman called on him for a certain favor, and, when asked to state his\r\ncase, made a great mess of it, for he had not sufficiently prepared\r\nhimself. Then the President gave him some free advice. \"What you need\r\nis to be thorough,\" and he brought his hand down on the table with the\r\ncrash of a maul,--\"to be thorough.\" It was his own method. After a\r\nsuccessful practise of twenty years he advised a young law student:\r\n\"Work, work, work is the main thing.\" He spoke out of his own\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThere is one remarkable passage in his life which is worth repeating\r\nhere, since it gives an insight into the thoroughness of this man. The\r\nfollowing is quoted from the Rev. J. P. Gulliver, then pastor of the\r\nCongregational church in Norwich, Conn. It was a part of a conversation\r\nwhich took place shortly after the Cooper Institute speech in 1860, and\r\nwas printed in _The Independent_ for September 1, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! 'I read law,' as the phrase is; that is, I became a lawyer's\r\nclerk in Springfield, and copied tedious documents, and picked up what\r\nI could of law in the intervals of other work. But your question\r\nreminds me of a bit of education I had, which I am bound in honesty to\r\nmention.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the course of my law reading I constantly came upon the word\r\n_demonstrate_. I thought, at first, that I understood its meaning, but\r\nsoon became satisfied that I did not. I said to myself, What do I do\r\nwhen I _demonstrate_ more than when I _reason_ or _prove_? How does\r\n_demonstration_ differ from any other proof? I consulted Webster's\r\nDictionary. They told of 'certain proof,' 'proof beyond the possibility\r\nof doubt'; but I could form no idea of what sort of proof that was. I\r\nthought a great many things were proved beyond the possibility of\r\ndoubt, without recourse to any such extraordinary process of reasoning\r\nas I understood _demonstration_ to be. I consulted all the dictionaries\r\nand books of reference I could find, but with no better results. You\r\nmight as well have defined _blue_ to a blind man. At last I\r\nsaid,--Lincoln, you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand\r\nwhat _demonstrate_ means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went\r\nhome to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any\r\nproposition in the six books of Euclid at sight. I then found out what\r\n_demonstrate_ means, and went back to my law studies.\"\r\n\r\nWas there ever a more thorough student?\r\n\r\n          *          *          *          *          *\r\n\r\nHe, like every one else, had his library within the library. Though he\r\nread everything he could lay his hands on, yet there are five books to\r\nbe mentioned specifically, because from childhood they furnished his\r\nintellectual nutriment. These were the Bible, Aesop's Fables and\r\nPilgrim's Progress, Burns, and Shakespeare. These were his mental\r\nfood. They entered into the very substance of his thought and\r\nimagination. \"Fear the man of one book.\" Lincoln had five books, and\r\nso thoroughly were they his that he was truly formidable. These did\r\nnot exclude other reading and study; they made it a thousand times\r\nmore fruitful. And yet people ask, where did Lincoln get the majesty,\r\nthe classic simplicity and elegance of his Gettysburg address? The\r\nanswer is here.\r\n\r\nWhile Lincoln was postmaster, he was a diligent reader of the\r\nnewspapers, of which the chief was the Louisville _Journal_. It was\r\nedited by George D. Prentice, who was, and is, second to no other\r\neditor in the entire history of American journalism. The ability of\r\nthis man to express his thoughts with such power was a mystery to this\r\nreader. The editor's mastery of language aroused in Lincoln a burning\r\ndesire to obtain command of the English tongue. He applied for counsel\r\nto a friend, a schoolmaster by the name of Mentor Graham. Graham\r\nrecommended him to study English grammar, and told him that a copy of\r\none was owned by a man who lived six miles away. Lincoln walked to the\r\nhouse, borrowed the book--\"collared\" it, as he expressed it--and at the\r\nend of six days had mastered it with his own thoroughness.\r\n\r\nThe first law book he read was \"The Statutes of Indiana.\" This was when\r\nhe was a lad living in that state, and he read the book, not for any\r\nspecial desire to know the subject but, because he was in the habit of\r\nreading all that came into his hands.\r\n\r\nHis next book was Blackstone's \"Commentaries.\" The accidental way\r\nin which he gained possession of, and read, this book is of sufficient\r\ninterest to narrate in his own words. It was shortly after he got into\r\nthe grocery business:\r\n\r\n\"One day a man who was migrating to the West drove up in front of my\r\nstore with a wagon which contained his family and household plunder. He\r\nasked me if I would buy an old barrel for which he had no room in his\r\nwagon, and which he said contained nothing of special value. I did not\r\nwant it, but to oblige him I bought it, and paid him, I think, half a\r\ndollar for it. Without further examination I put it away in the store\r\nand forgot all about it. Some time after, in overhauling things, I came\r\nupon the barrel, and emptying it upon the floor to see what it\r\ncontained, I found at the bottom of the rubbish a complete edition of\r\nBlackstone's \"Commentaries.\" I began to read those famous works, and I\r\nhad plenty of time; for during the long summer days, when the farmers\r\nwere busy with their crops, my customers were few and far between. The\r\nmore I read, the more intensely interested I became. Never in my whole\r\nlife was my mind so thoroughly absorbed. I read until I devoured them.\"\r\n\r\nAll this may have been fatal to the prosperity of the leading store in\r\nthat hamlet of fifteen log cabins, but it led to something better than\r\nthe success of the most magnificent store in New York.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1834 that Lincoln was first elected to the legislature.\r\nDuring the canvass he was brought into the company of Major John T.\r\nStuart, whom he had met in the Black Hawk war. Stuart advised him to\r\nenter definitely on the study of the law. He decided to do this. This\r\nproved to be quite the most important thing that occurred to him that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nStuart further offered to lend him the necessary books. This offer was\r\ngladly accepted, and having no means of travel, he walked to and from\r\nSpringfield, a distance of twenty miles, to get the books and return\r\nthem. During this tramp he was able to read forty pages of the volume.\r\nThus he read, and we may venture to say mastered, Chitty, Greenleaf,\r\nand Story, in addition to Blackstone before mentioned. It was the best\r\nfoundation that could have been laid for a great lawyer.\r\n\r\nDuring this reading he was getting his bread and butter by the other\r\nemployments--store-keeping, postmaster, and surveyor. These may not\r\nhave interfered greatly with the study of the law, but the study of the\r\nlaw certainly interfered with the first of these. He read much out of\r\ndoors. He would lie on his back in the shade of some tree, with his\r\nfeet resting part way up the tree, then follow the shadow around from\r\nwest to east, grinding around with the progress of the sun. When in the\r\nhouse his attitude was to cock his feet high in a chair, thus \"sitting\r\non his shoulder blades,\" to use a common expression. When in his office\r\nhe would throw himself on the lounge with his feet high on a chair.\r\nThese attitudes, bringing his feet up to, and sometimes above, the\r\nlevel with his head, have been characteristic of American students time\r\nout of mind. He never outgrew the tendency. Even when President and\r\nsitting with his Cabinet, his feet always found some lofty perch.\r\n\r\nWhile he was not reading, he was pondering or memorizing. Thus he took\r\nlong walks, talking to himself incessantly, until some of his neighbors\r\nthought he was going crazy.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the bar in 1837. At that date there was no lawyer\r\nnearer to New Salem than those in Springfield, which was twenty miles\r\noff. Consequently he had a little amateur practise from his neighbors.\r\nHe was sometimes appealed to for the purpose of drawing up agreements\r\nand other papers. He had no office, and if he chanced to be out of\r\ndoors would call for writing-materials, a slab of wood for a desk, draw\r\nup the paper, and then resume his study.\r\n\r\nThis same year he became a partner of Stuart, in Springfield. The\r\nlatter wanted to get into politics, and it was essential that he\r\nshould, have a trustworthy partner. So the firm of Stuart and Lincoln\r\nwas established in 1837 and lived for four years. In 1841 he entered\r\ninto partnership with Logan, and this also lasted about four years. In\r\nthe year 1845 was established the firm of Lincoln and Herndon, which\r\ncontinued until the assassination of the president in 1865.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief period Lincoln himself got deeper into politics, this\r\nperiod culminating with the term in congress. In this he necessarily\r\nneglected the law more or less. But late in 1848, or early in 1849, he\r\nreturned to the law with renewed vigor and zeal, giving it his\r\nundivided attention for six years. It was the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise that called him back into the arena of politics. This will\r\nbe narrated later.\r\n\r\nHis partnership with Stuart of course necessitated his removal to\r\nSpringfield. This event, small in itself, gives such a pathetic picture\r\nof his poverty, and his cheerful endurance, that it is well worth\r\nnarrating. It is preserved by Joshua F. Speed, who became, and through\r\nlife continued, Lincoln's fast friend. The story is given in Speed's\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"He had ridden into town on a borrowed horse, with no earthly property\r\nsave a pair of saddlebags containing a few clothes. I was a merchant at\r\nSpringfield, and kept a large country store, embracing dry-goods,\r\ngroceries, hardware, books, medicines, bed-clothes, mattresses--in\r\nfact, everything that the country needed. Lincoln said he wanted to buy\r\nthe furniture for a single bed. The mattress, blankets, sheets,\r\ncoverlet, and pillow, according to the figures made by me, would cost\r\nseventeen dollars. He said that perhaps was cheap enough; but small as\r\nthe price was, he was unable to pay it. [Note that at this time he was\r\ncarrying the debts of the merchants of New Salem. THE AUTHOR.] But if I\r\nwould credit him until Christmas, and his experiment as a lawyer was a\r\nsuccess, he would pay then; saying in the saddest tone, 'If I fail in\r\nthis, I do not know that I ever can pay you.' As I looked up at him I\r\nthought then, and I think now, that I never saw a sadder face.\r\n\r\nI said to him: 'You seem to be so much pained at contracting so small a\r\ndebt, I think I can suggest a plan by which you can avoid the debt, and\r\nat the same time attain your end. I have a large room with a double bed\r\nup-stairs, which you are very welcome to share with me.'\r\n\r\n'Where is your room?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Up-stairs,' said I, pointing to a pair of winding-stairs, which led\r\nfrom the store to my room.\r\n\r\nHe took his saddle-bags on his arm, went upstairs, set them on the\r\nfloor, and came down with the most changed expression of countenance.\r\nBeaming with pleasure, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Well, Speed, I am moved!'\"\r\n\r\nThus he became established in the profession of the law and a resident\r\nof Springfield. It was not a large city, but it was a very active one,\r\nthough small, and was the capital of the state. Lincoln was there\r\nfavorably known, because he had been chiefly instrumental in getting\r\nthe capital moved to that place from Vandalia. His first law partner\r\nwas very helpful to him, and he had abundant reason all his life to be\r\nthankful also for the friendship of Joshua F. Speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON THE CIRCUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the lawyer in that part of the country, at that\r\ndate, were different from the requirements in any part of the world at\r\nthe present date. The Hon. Joseph H. Choate, in a lecture at Edinburgh,\r\nNovember 13, 1900, said: \"My professional brethren will ask me how\r\ncould this rough backwoodsman ... become a learned and accomplished\r\nlawyer? Well, he never did. He never would have earned his salt as a\r\nwriter for the 'Signet,' nor have won a place as advocate in the Court\r\nof Session, where the teachings of the profession has reached its\r\nhighest perfection, and centuries of learning and precedent are\r\ninvolved in the equipment of a lawyer.\"\r\n\r\nThe only means we have of knowing what Lincoln could do is knowing what\r\nhe did. If his biography teaches anything, it teaches that he never\r\nfailed to meet the exigencies of any occasion. The study of his life\r\nwill reveal this fact with increasing emphasis. Many a professional\r\nbrother looked on Lincoln as \"this rough backwoodsman,\" unable to\r\n\"become a learned and accomplished lawyer,\" to his own utter\r\ndiscomfiture. We are justified in saying that if he had undertaken the\r\nduties of the Scots writer to the \"Signet,\" he would have done them\r\nwell, as he did every other duty.\r\n\r\nWhen Douglas was congratulated in advance upon the ease with which he\r\nwould vanquish his opponent, he replied that he would rather meet any\r\nman in the country in that joint debate than Abraham Lincoln. At\r\nanother time he said: \"Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform\r\nwith admirable skill whatever they undertake.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's professional duties were in the Eighth Judicial Circuit,\r\nwhich then comprised fifteen counties. Some of these counties have\r\nsince been subdivided, so that the territory of that district was\r\nlarger than would be indicated by the same number of counties to-day.\r\nIt was one hundred and fifty miles long and nearly as wide. There were\r\nfew railroads, and the best county roads were extremely poor, so that\r\ntraveling was burdensome. The court and the lawyers traveled from one\r\ncounty seat to another, sometimes horseback, sometimes in buggies or\r\nwagons, and sometimes afoot. The duties of one county being concluded,\r\nthe entire company would move on to another county. Thus only a small\r\npart of his duties were transacted at Springfield.\r\n\r\nThese periodic sessions of the court were of general interest to the\r\ncommunities in which they were held. There were no theaters, no lyceums\r\nfor music or lectures, and few other assemblages of any sort, excepting\r\nthe churches and the agricultural fairs. It thus came about that the\r\ncourt was the center of a greater interest than would now be possible.\r\nIt was the rostrum of the lecturer and the arena of the debate. Nor\r\nwere comedies lacking in its multifarious proceedings. The attorney was\r\ntherefore sure of a general audience, as well as of court and jury.\r\n\r\nThis peripatetic practise threw the lawyers much into one another's\r\ncompany. There were long evenings to be spent in the country taverns,\r\nwhen sociability was above par. Lincoln's inexhaustible fund of wit and\r\nhumor, and his matchless array of stories, made him the life of the\r\ncompany. In this number there were many lawyers of real ability. The\r\njudge was David Davis, whose culture and legal ability will hardly be\r\nquestioned by any one. Judge Davis was almost ludicrously fond of\r\nLincoln. He kept him in his room evenings and was very impatient if\r\nLincoln's talk was interrupted.\r\n\r\nThere were two qualities in Lincoln's anecdotes: their resistless fun,\r\nand their appropriateness. When Lincoln came into court it was usually\r\nwith a new story, and as he would tell it in low tones the lawyers\r\nwould crowd about him to the neglect of everything else, and to the\r\ngreat annoyance of the judge. He once called out: \"Mr. Lincoln, we\r\ncan't hold two courts, one up here and one down there. Either yours or\r\nmine must adjourn.\"\r\n\r\nOnce Lincoln came into the room late, leaned over the clerk's desk and\r\nwhispered to him a little story. Thereupon the clerk threw back his\r\nhead and laughed aloud. The judge thundered out, \"Mr. Clerk, you may\r\nfine yourself five dollars for contempt of court.\" The clerk quietly\r\nreplied, \"I don't care; the story's worth it.\" After adjournment the\r\njudge asked him, \"What was that story of Lincoln's?\" When it was\r\nrepeated the judge threw back his head and laughed, and added, \"You may\r\nremit the fine.\"\r\n\r\nA stranger, hearing the fame of Lincoln's stories, attended court and\r\nafterward said, \"The stories are good, but I can't see that they help\r\nthe case any.\" An admiring neighbor replied with more zeal and justice\r\nthan elegance, \"Don't you apply that unction to your soul.\" The\r\nneighbor was right. Lincoln had not in vain spent the days and nights\r\nof his boyhood and youth with Aesop. His stories were as luminous of\r\nthe point under consideration as were the stories which explained that\r\n\"this fable teaches.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Davis wrote of him that \"he was able to claim the attention of\r\ncourt and jury when the cause was most uninteresting by the\r\n_appropriateness_ of his anecdotes.\" Those who have tried to claim\r\nJudge Davis' attention when he did not want to give it, will realize\r\nthe greatness of praise implied in this concession.\r\n\r\nTo this may be joined the remark of Leonard Swett, that \"any man who\r\ntook Lincoln for a simple-minded man would wake up with his back in the\r\nditch.\"\r\n\r\nAs Lincoln would never adopt the methods of his partner Herndon, the\r\nlatter could not quite grasp the essential greatness of the former, and\r\nhe uses some patronizing words. We may again quote Judge Davis: \"In all\r\nthe elements that constitute a great lawyer he had few equals ... He\r\nseized the strong points of a cause and presented them with clearness\r\nand great compactness.... Generalities and platitudes had no charms for\r\nhim. An unfailing vein of humor never deserted him.\" Then follows the\r\npassage already quoted.\r\n\r\nLincoln never could bring himself to charge large fees. Lamon was his\r\nlimited partner (with the office in Danville and Bloomington) for many\r\nyears. He tells one instance which will illustrate this trait. There\r\nwas a case of importance for which the fee was fixed in advance at\r\n$250, a very moderate fee under the circumstances. It so happened that\r\nthe case was not contested and the business required only a short time.\r\nThe client cheerfully paid the fee as agreed. As he went away Lincoln\r\nasked his partner how much he charged. He replied, \"$250.\" \"Lamon,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that is all wrong. Give him back at least half of it.\" Lamon\r\nprotested that it was according to agreement and the client was\r\nsatisfied. \"That may be, but _I_ am not satisfied. This is positively\r\nwrong. Go, call him back and return him half the money at least, or I\r\nwill not receive one cent of it for my share.\"\r\n\r\nOne may imagine the amazement of the client to receive back one half of\r\nthe fee. But the matter did not end here. The affair had attracted the\r\nattention of those near at hand, including the court. Judge Davis was\r\nof enormous physical size, and his voice was like a fog horn. The\r\nauthor writes this from vivid remembrance. Once in early youth he\r\nquaked in his shoes at the blast of that voice. The conclusion of the\r\nincident is given in the words of Lamon: \"The judge never could\r\nwhisper, but in this case he probably did his best. At all events, in\r\nattempting to whisper to Mr. Lincoln he trumpeted his rebuke in about\r\nthese words, and in rasping tones that could be heard all over the\r\ncourt room: 'Lincoln, I have been watching you and Lamon. You are\r\nimpoverishing this bar by your picayune charges of fees, and the\r\nlawyers have reason to complain of you. You are now almost as poor as\r\nLazarus, and if you don't make people pay you more for your services,\r\nyou will die as poor as Job's turkey.\"\r\n\r\nThe event justified the Judge's remarks. It was not unusual for\r\nLincoln's name, as attorney, to be found on one side or the other of\r\nevery case on the docket. In other words, his practise was as large as\r\nthat of any lawyer on the circuit, and he had his full proportion of\r\nimportant cases. But he never accumulated a large sum of money.\r\nProbably no other successful lawyer in that region had a smaller\r\nincome. This is a convincing commentary on his charges.\r\n\r\nThe largest fee he ever received was from the Illinois Central\r\nRailroad. The case was tried at Bloomington before the supreme court\r\nand was won for the road. Lincoln went to Chicago and presented a bill\r\nfor $2,000 at the offices of the company. \"Why,\" said the official, in\r\nreal or feigned astonishment, \"this is as much as a first-class lawyer\r\nwould have charged.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln was greatly depressed by this rebuff, and would have let the\r\nmatter drop then and there had not his neighbors heard of it. They\r\npersuaded him to raise the fee to $5,000, and six leading lawyers of\r\nthe state testified that that sum was a moderate charge. Lincoln sued\r\nthe road for the larger amount and won his case. It is a matter of\r\ninterest that at that time the vice-president of the railroad was\r\nGeorge B. McClellan.\r\n\r\nIt was Lincoln's habit always to go to the heart of a case. Quibbles\r\ndid not interest him. The non-professional public who have attended\r\njury trials will not easily forget the monotonous \"I object\" of the\r\nattorneys, usually followed by, \"I except to the ruling of the court,\"\r\nand \"The clerk will note the exception.\" Lincoln generally met the\r\nobjections by the placid remark, \"I reckon that's so.\" Thus he gave up\r\npoint after point, apparently giving away his case over and over again,\r\nuntil his associates were brought to the verge of nervous prostration.\r\nAfter giving away six points he would fasten upon the seventh, which\r\nwas the pivotal point of the case, and would handle that so as to win.\r\nThis ought to have been satisfactory, but neither Herndon nor his other\r\nassociates ever got used to it.\r\n\r\nLincoln put his conscience into his legal practise to a greater degree\r\nthan is common with lawyers. He held (with Blackstone) that law is for\r\nthe purpose of securing justice, and he would never make use of any\r\ntechnicality for the purpose of thwarting justice. When others\r\nmaneuvered, he met them by a straightforward dealing. He never did or\r\ncould take an unfair advantage. On the wrong side of a case, he was\r\nworse than useless to his client, and he knew it. He would never take\r\nsuch a case if it could be avoided. His partner Herndon tells how he\r\ngave some free and unprofessional advice to one who offered him such a\r\ncase: \"Yes, there is no reasonable doubt but that I can gain your case\r\nfor you. I can set a whole neighborhood at loggerheads; I can distress\r\na widowed mother and her six fatherless children, and thereby get for\r\nyou six hundred dollars, which rightfully belongs, it appears to me, as\r\nmuch to them as it does to you. I shall not take your case, but will\r\ngive a little advice for nothing. You seem a sprightly, energetic man.\r\nI would advise you to try your hand at making six hundred dollars in\r\nsome other way.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, after having entered on a case, he discovered that his\r\nclients had imposed on him. In his indignation he has even left the\r\ncourt room. Once when the Judge sent for him he refused to return.\r\n\"Tell the judge my hands are dirty; I came over to wash them.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important law-suit in which Lincoln was ever engaged was the\r\nMcCormick case. McCormick instituted a suit against one Manny for\r\nalleged infringement of patents. McCormick virtually claimed the\r\nmonopoly of the manufacture of harvesting machines. The suit involved a\r\nlarge sum of money besides incidental considerations. The leading\r\nattorney for the plaintiff was the Hon. Reverdy Johnson, one of the\r\nforemost, if not the foremost, at the bar in the entire country. It was\r\nthe opportunity of crossing swords with Johnson that, more than\r\nanything else, stirred Lincoln's interest. With him, for the defense,\r\nwas associated Edwin M. Stanton.\r\n\r\nThe case was to be tried at Cincinnati, and all parties were on hand.\r\nLincoln gave an extraordinary amount of care in the preparation of the\r\ncase. But some little things occurred. Through an open doorway he heard\r\nStanton make some scornful remarks of him,--ridiculing his awkward\r\nappearance and his dress, particularly, for Lincoln wore a linen\r\nduster, soiled and disfigured by perspiration. When the time came for\r\napportioning the speeches, Lincoln, although he was thoroughly prepared\r\nand by the customs of the bar it was his right to make the argument,\r\ncourteously offered the opportunity to Stanton, who promptly accepted.\r\nIt was a great disappointment to Lincoln to miss thus the opportunity\r\nof arguing with Reverdy Johnson. Neither did Stanton know what he\r\nmissed. Nor did Johnson know what a narrow escape he had.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will not be complete without making mention of Lincoln's\r\nprofessional kindness to the poor and unfortunate. Those who could find\r\nno other friends were sure to find a friend in Lincoln. He would freely\r\ngive his services to the needy. At that time the negro found it hard to\r\nget help, friendship, justice. Though Illinois was a free state, public\r\nopinion was such that any one who undertook the cause of the negro was\r\nsure to alienate friends. Lincoln was one of the few who never\r\nhesitated at the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA young man, a free negro living in the neighborhood, had been employed\r\nas cabin boy on a Mississippi river steamboat. Arriving at New Orleans,\r\nhe went ashore without a suspicion of what the law was in a slave\r\nstate. He was arrested for being on the street after dark without a\r\npass, thrown into jail, and fined. Having no money to pay the fine, he\r\nwas liable to be sold into slavery, when his mother, in her distress,\r\ncame to Lincoln for help. Lincoln sent to the governor to see if there\r\nwas no way by which this free negro could be brought home. The governor\r\nwas sorry that there was not. In a towering wrath Lincoln exclaimed:\r\n\"I'll have that negro back soon, or I'll have a twenty years'\r\nexcitement in Illinois until the governor does have a legal and\r\nconstitutional right to do something in the premises!\"\r\n\r\nHe had both. He and his partner sent to New Orleans the necessary money\r\nby which the boy was released and restored to his mother. The twenty\r\nyears' excitement came later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE AND MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringfield was largely settled by people born and educated in older\r\nand more cultured communities. From the first it developed a social\r\nlife of its own. In the years on both sides of 1840, it maintained as\r\nlarge an amount of such social activity as was possible in a new\r\nfrontier city. In this life Lincoln was an important factor. The public\r\ninterest in the man made this necessary, even apart from considerations\r\nof his own personal preferences.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that he was extremely sociable in his tastes. He was fond\r\nof being among men. Wherever men were gathered, there Lincoln went, and\r\nwherever Lincoln was, men gathered about him. In the intervals of work,\r\nat nooning or in the evening, he was always the center of an interested\r\ngroup, and his unparalleled flow of humor, wit, and good nature was the\r\nlife of the assemblage. This had always been so from childhood. It had\r\nbecome a second nature with him to entertain the crowd, while the crowd\r\ncame to look upon him as their predestined entertainer.\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln had been brought up in the open air, on the very frontier,\r\n\"far from the madding crowd.\" His social experience and his tastes were\r\nwith men, not ladies. He was not used to the luxuries of civilization,\r\n--elegant carpets, fine china, fashionable dress. Though he had great\r\ndignity and nobility of soul, he did not have that polish of manners\r\nwhich counts for so much with ladies. His ungainly physique accented\r\nthis lack. He was not, he never could be, what is known as a ladies'\r\nman. While his friendly nature responded to all sociability, he was not\r\nfond of ladies' society. He was naturally in great demand, and he\r\nattended all the social gatherings. But when there, he drifted away\r\nfrom the company of the ladies into that of the men. Nor were the men\r\nloath to gather about him.\r\n\r\nThe ladies liked him, but one of them doubtless spoke the truth, when\r\nshe declared that their grievance against him was that he monopolized\r\nthe attention of the men. This was natural to him, it had been\r\nconfirmed by years of habit, and by the time he was thirty years old it\r\nwas practically impossible for him to adopt the ways acceptable to\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nInto this society in Springfield came a pretty, bright, educated,\r\ncultured young lady--Miss Mary Todd. She was of an aristocratic family\r\nfrom Kentucky. It is said that she could trace the family genealogy\r\nback many centuries. She may have been haughty--she was said to be so--\r\nand she may have been exacting in those little matters which make up so\r\nlarge a measure of what is known as polish of manners. These would be\r\nprecisely the demands which Lincoln was unable to meet.\r\n\r\nIt was a foregone conclusion that the two would be thrown much into\r\neach other's society, and that the neighbors would connect them in\r\nthought. For Lincoln was the most popular man and Miss Todd was the\r\nmost popular young lady in Springfield. It was simply another case of\r\nthe attraction of opposites, for in everything except their popularity\r\nthey were as unlike as they could be.\r\n\r\nIt is proverbial that the course of true love never did run smooth. If\r\nthere were ripples and eddies and counter-currents in the course of\r\nthis love, it was in nowise exceptional. It is only the prominence of\r\nthe parties that has brought this into the strong light of publicity.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written that is both unwarranted and unkind. Even the\r\nmost confidential friends do not realize the limitations of their\r\nknowledge on a matter so intimate. When they say they know all about\r\nit, they are grievously mistaken. No love story (outside of novels) is\r\never told truly. In the first place, the parties themselves do not tell\r\nall. They may say they do, but there are some things which neither man\r\nnor woman ever tells. In the heart of love there is a Holy of Holies\r\ninto which the most intimate friend is not allowed to look.\r\n\r\nAnd in the second place, even the lovers do not see things alike. If\r\nboth really understood, there could be no _mis_understanding. It\r\nis, then, presumptive for even the confidants, and much more for the\r\ngeneral public, to claim to know too much of a lovers' quarrel.\r\n\r\nWe would gladly pass over this event were it not that certain salient\r\nfacts are a matter of public record. It is certain that Lincoln became\r\nengaged to Miss Todd in the year 1840. It is certain that he broke the\r\nengagement on January 1, 1841. It is certain that about that time he\r\nhad a horrible attack of melancholy. And we have seen that he never\r\noutgrew his attachment to his early love, Ann Rutledge. Whether this\r\nmelancholy was the cause of his breaking the engagement, or was caused\r\nby it, we cannot say. Whether the memory of Ann Rutledge had any\r\ninfluence in the matter, we do not know.\r\n\r\nWhatever the mental cause of this melancholy, there is no doubt that it\r\nhad also a physical cause. This was his most violent attack, but by no\r\nmeans his only one. It recurred, with greater or less severity, all\r\nthrough his life. He had been born and had grown up in a climate noted\r\nfor its malaria. Excepting for the facts that he spent much time in the\r\nopen air, had abundant exercise, and ate plain food, the laws of\r\nsanitation were not thought of. It would be strange if his system were\r\nnot full of malaria, or, what is only slightly less abominable, of the\r\nmedicines used to counteract it. In either case he would be subject to\r\ndepression. An unfortunate occurrence in a love affair, coming at the\r\ntime of an attack of melancholy, would doubtless bear abundant and\r\nbitter fruit.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the engagement was broken, not a little to the\r\nchagrin of both parties. But a kind neighbor, Mrs. Francis, whose\r\nhusband was editor of the Springfield _Journal_, interposed with her\r\nfriendly offices. She invited the two lovers to her house, and they\r\nwent, each without the knowledge that the other was to be there. Their\r\nsocial converse was thus renewed, and, in the company of a third\r\nperson, Miss Jayne, they continued to meet at frequent intervals. Among\r\nthe admirers of Miss Todd were two young men who came to be widely\r\nknown. These were Douglas and Shields. With the latter only we are\r\nconcerned now. He was a red-headed little Irishman, with a peppery\r\ntemper, the whole being set off with an inordinate vanity. He must have\r\nhad genuine ability in some directions, or else he was wonderfully\r\nlucky, for he was an officeholder of some kind or other, in different\r\nstates of the Union, nearly all his life. It is doubtful if another\r\nperson can be named who held as many different offices as he; certainly\r\nno other man has ever represented so many different states in the\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nAt this particular time, Shields was auditor of the state of Illinois.\r\nThe finances of the state were in a shocking condition. The state banks\r\nwere not a success, and the currency was nearly worthless. At the same\r\ntime, it was the only money current, and it was the money of the state.\r\nThese being the circumstances, the governor, auditor, and treasurer,\r\nissued a circular forbidding the payment of state taxes in this paper\r\ncurrency of the state. This was clearly an outrage upon the taxpayers.\r\n\r\nAgainst this Lincoln protested. Not by serious argument, but by the\r\nmerciless satire which he knew so well how to use upon occasion. Under\r\nthe pseudonym of Aunt Rebecca, he wrote a letter to the Springfield\r\n_Journal_. The letter was written in the style of Josh Billings,\r\nand purported to come from a widow residing in the \"Lost Townships.\" It\r\nwas an attempt to laugh down the unjust measure, and in pursuance of\r\nthis the writer plied Shields with ridicule. The town was convulsed\r\nwith laughter, and Shields with fury. The wrath of the little Irishman\r\nwas funnier than the letter, and the joy of the neighbors increased.\r\n\r\nMiss Todd and Miss Jayne entered into the spirit of the fun. Then they\r\nwrote a letter in which Aunt Rebecca proposed to soothe his injured\r\nfeelings by accepting Shields as her husband. This was followed by a\r\ndoggerel rhyme celebrating the event.\r\n\r\nShields' fury knew no bounds. He went to Francis, the editor of the\r\n_Journal_, and demanded the name of the author of the letters.\r\nFrancis consulted with Lincoln. The latter was unwilling to permit any\r\nodium to fall on the ladies, and sent word to Shields that he would\r\nhold himself responsible for those letters.\r\n\r\nIf Shields had not been precisely the kind of a man he was, the matter\r\nmight have been explained and settled amicably. But no, he must have\r\nblood. He sent an insulting and peremptory challenge. When Lincoln\r\nbecame convinced that a duel was necessary, he exercised his right, as\r\nthe challenged party, of choosing the weapons. He selected \"broadswords\r\nof the largest size.\" This was another triumph of humor. The midget of\r\nan Irishman was to be pitted against the giant of six feet four inches,\r\nwho possessed the strength of a Hercules, and the weapons were--\r\n\"broadswords of the largest size.\"\r\n\r\nThe bloody party repaired to Alton, and thence to an island or sand-bar\r\non the Missouri side of the river. There a reconciliation was effected,\r\nhonor was satisfied all around, and they returned home in good spirits.\r\nFor some reason Lincoln was always ashamed of this farce. Why, we do\r\nnot know. It may have been because he was drawn into a situation in\r\nwhich there was a possibility of his shedding human blood. And he who\r\nwas too tender-hearted to shoot wild game could not make light of that\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe engagement between Lincoln and Miss Todd was renewed, and they were\r\nquietly married at the home of the bride's sister, Mrs. Edwards,\r\nNovember 4th, 1842. Lincoln made a loyal, true, indulgent husband. Mrs.\r\nLincoln made a home that was hospitable, cultured, unostentatious. They\r\nlived together until the death of the husband, more than twenty-two\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nThey had four children, all boys. Only the eldest, Robert Todd Lincoln,\r\ngrew to manhood. He has had a career which is, to say the least,\r\ncreditable to the name he bears. For a few months at the close of the\r\nwar he was on the staff of General Grant. He was Secretary of War\r\nunder Garfield and retained the office through the administration of\r\nArthur. Under President Harrison, from 1889 to 1893, he was minister to\r\nEngland. He is a lawyer by profession, residing in Chicago--the city\r\nthat loved his father--and at the present writing is president of the\r\nPullman Company. In every position he has occupied he has exercised a\r\nnotably wide influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE ENCROACHMENTS OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary at this point to take a glance at the history of\r\nAmerican slavery, in order to understand Lincoln's career. In 1619, or\r\none year before the landing of the _Mayflower_ at Plymouth, a Dutch\r\nman-of-war landed a cargo of slaves at Jamestown, Virginia. For nearly\r\ntwo centuries after this the slave trade was more or less brisk. The\r\nslaves were distributed, though unevenly, over all the colonies. But as\r\ntime passed, differences appeared. In the North, the public conscience\r\nwas awake to the injustice of the institution, while in the South it\r\nwas not. There were many exceptions in both localities, but the public\r\nsentiment, the general feeling, was as stated.\r\n\r\nThere was another difference. Slave labor was more valuable in the\r\nSouth than in the North. This was due to the climate. The negro does\r\nnot take kindly to the rigors of the North, while in the South the\r\nheat, which is excessive to the white man, is precisely suited to the\r\nnegro. In the course of years, therefore, there came to be\r\ncomparatively few negroes in the North while large numbers were found\r\nin the South.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that the founders of our government looked\r\nforward to a gradual extinction of slavery. In the first draft of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson inserted some scathing\r\nremarks about the King's part in the slave traffic. But it was felt\r\nthat such remarks would come with ill grace from colonies that abetted\r\nslavery, and the passage was stricken out. It was, however, provided\r\nthat the slave trade should cease in the year 1808.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance of 1787 recognized the difference in sentiment of the two\r\nportions of the country on the subject, and was enacted as a\r\ncompromise. Like several subsequent enactments, it was supposed to set\r\nthe agitation of the subject for ever at rest. This ordinance provided\r\nthat slavery should be excluded from the northwestern territory. At\r\nthat time the Mississippi river formed the western boundary of the\r\ncountry, and the territory thus ordained to be free was that out of\r\nwhich the five states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin were subsequently formed. It was not then dreamed that the\r\nfuture acquisition of new territory, or the sudden appreciation of the\r\nvalue of the slave, would reopen the question.\r\n\r\nBut three facts changed the entire complexion of the subject. It was\r\ndiscovered that the soil and climate of the South were remarkably well\r\nadapted to the growth of cotton. Then the development of steam power\r\nand machinery in the manufacture of cotton goods created a sudden and\r\nenormous demand from Liverpool, Manchester, and other cities in England\r\nfor American cotton. There remained an obstacle to the supply of this\r\ndemand. This was the difficulty of separating the cotton fiber from the\r\nseed. A negro woman was able to clean about a pound of cotton in a day.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, Eli Whitney, a graduate of Yale college, was teaching school\r\nin Georgia, and boarding with the widow of General Greene. Certain\r\nplanters were complaining, in the hearing of Mrs. Greene, of the\r\ndifficulty of cleaning cotton, when she declared that the Yankee school\r\nteacher could solve the difficulty, that he was so ingenious that there\r\nwas almost nothing he could not do.\r\n\r\nThe matter was brought to Whitney's attention, who protested that he\r\nknew nothing of the subject,--he hardly knew a cotton seed when he saw\r\nit. Nevertheless he set to work and invented the cotton gin. By this\r\nmachine one man, turning a crank; could clean fifty pounds of cotton a\r\nday. The effect of this was to put a new face upon the cotton trade. It\r\nenabled the planters to meet the rapidly-increasing demand for raw\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nIt had an equal influence on the slavery question. Only negroes can\r\nwork successfully in the cotton fields. There was a phenomenal increase\r\nin the demand for negro labor. And this was fifteen years before the\r\ntime limit of the slave trade in 1808.\r\n\r\nThere soon came to be a decided jealousy between the slave-holding and\r\nthe non-slave-holding portion of the country which continually\r\nincreased. At the time of the Ordinance of 1787 the two parts of the\r\ncountry, were about evenly balanced. Each section kept a vigilant watch\r\nof the other section so as to avoid losing the balance of power.\r\n\r\nAs the country enlarged, this balance was preserved by the admission of\r\nfree and slave states in turn. Vermont was paired with Kentucky;\r\nTennessee with Ohio; Louisiana with Indiana; and Mississippi with\r\nIllinois. In 1836, Michigan and Arkansas were admitted on the same day.\r\non the same day. This indicates that the jealousy of the two parties\r\nwas growing more acute.\r\n\r\nThen Texas was admitted December 29, 1845, and was not balanced until\r\nthe admission of Wisconsin in 1848.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to the admission of Missouri. It came into the\r\nUnion as a slave state, but by what is known as the Missouri Compromise\r\nof 1820. By this compromise the concession of slavery to Missouri was\r\noffset by the enactment that all slavery should be forever excluded\r\nfrom the territory west of that state and north of its southern\r\nboundary: namely, the parallel of 36 degrees 30'.\r\n\r\nThe mutterings of the conflict were heard at the time of the admission\r\nof Texas in 1848. It was again \"set forever at rest\" by what was known\r\nas the Wilmot proviso. A year or two later, the discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia and the acquisition of New Mexico reopened the whole\r\nquestion. Henry Clay of Kentucky, a slaveholder but opposed to the\r\nextension of slavery, was then a member of the House. By a series of\r\ncompromises--he had a brilliant talent for compromise--he once more set\r\nthe whole question \"forever at rest.\" This rest lasted for four years.\r\nBut in 1852 Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe published \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\"\r\nan event of national importance. To a degree unprecedented, it roused\r\nthe conscience of those who were opposed to slavery and inflamed the\r\nwrath of those who favored it.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and rude awakening from this rest came in 1854 with the\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise. The overland travel to California\r\nafter the year 1848 had given to the intervening territory an\r\nimportance far in excess of its actual population. It early became\r\ndesirable to admit into the Union both Kansas and Nebraska; and the\r\nquestion arose whether slavery should be excluded according to the act\r\nof 1820. The slave-holding residents of Missouri were hostile to the\r\nexclusion of slavery. It was situated just beyond their border, and\r\nthere is no wonder that they were unable to see any good reason why\r\nthey could not settle there with their slaves. They had the sympathy of\r\nthe slave states generally.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the free states were bitterly opposed to extending\r\nthe slave power. To them it seemed that the slaveholders were planning\r\nfor a vast empire of slavery, an empire which should include not only\r\nthe southern half of the United States, but also Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica, and possibly a portion of South America. The advocates of\r\nslavery certainly presented and maintained an imperious and despotic\r\ntemper. Feeling was running high on both sides in the early fifties.\r\n\r\nA leading cyclopedia concludes a brief article on the Missouri\r\nCompromise with the parenthetical reference,--\"see DOUGLAS, STEPHEN A.\"\r\nThe implication contained in these words is fully warranted. The chief\r\nevent in the life of Douglas is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.\r\nAnd the history of the Missouri Compromise cannot be written without\r\ngiving large place to the activity of Douglas. His previous utterances\r\nhad not led observers, however watchful, to suspect this. In the\r\ncompromise of 1850 he had spoken with great emphasis: \"In taking leave\r\nof this subject, I wish to state that I have determined never to make\r\nanother speech upon the slavery question.... We claim that the\r\ncompromise is a final settlement.... Those who preach peace should not\r\nbe the first to commence and reopen an old quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the man who four years later recommenced and reopened this old\r\nquarrel of slavery. In the meantime something had occurred. In 1852 he\r\nhad been the unsuccessful candidate for the democratic nomination for\r\nPresident, and he had aspirations for the nomination in 1856, when a\r\nnomination would have been equivalent to an election. It thus seemed\r\npolitic for him to make some decided move which would secure to him the\r\nloyalty of the slave power.\r\n\r\nUpon Stephen A. Douglas rested the responsibility of the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise. He was at that time chairman of the Senate\r\ncommittee on Territories. His personal friend and political manager for\r\nIllinois, William A. Richardson, held a similar position in the House.\r\nThe control of the legislation upon this subject was then absolutely in\r\nthe hands of Senator Douglas, the man who had \"determined never to make\r\nanother speech on the slavery question.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this book to go into the details of this\r\niniquitous plot, for plot it was. But the following passage may be\r\nquoted as exhibiting the method of the bill: \"It being the true intent\r\nand meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or\r\nstate, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\r\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in\r\ntheir own way, subject only to the Constitution.\" In other words, no\r\nstate or territory could be surely safe from the intrusion of slavery.\r\n\r\nLincoln had been practising law and had been out of politics for six\r\nyears. It was this bill which called him back to politics, \"like a\r\nfire-bell in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE LION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise caused great excitement\r\nthroughout the land. The conscience of the anti-slavery portion of the\r\ncommunity was shocked, as was also that of the large numbers of people\r\nwho, though not opposed to slavery in itself, were opposed to its\r\nextension. It showed that this institution had a deadening effect upon\r\nthe moral nature of the people who cherished it. There was no\r\ncompromise so generous that it would satisfy their greed, there were no\r\npromises so solemn that they could be depended on to keep them. They\r\nwere not content with maintaining slavery in their own territory. It\r\nwas not enough that they should be allowed to take slaves into a\r\nterritory consecrated to freedom, nor that all the powers of the law\r\nwere devoted to recapturing a runaway slave and returning him to\r\nrenewed horrors. They wanted all the territories which they had\r\npromised to let alone. It was a logical, and an altogether probable\r\nconclusion that they only waited for the opportunity to invade the\r\nnorthern states and turn them from free-soil into slave territory.\r\n\r\nThe indignation over this outrage not only flamed from thousands of\r\npulpits, but newspapers and political clubs of all kinds took up the\r\nsubject on one side or the other. Every moralist became a politician,\r\nand every politician discussed the moral bearings of his tenets.\r\n\r\nIn no locality was this excitement more intense than in Illinois. There\r\nwere special reasons for this. It is a very long state, stretching\r\nnearly five hundred miles from north to south. Now, it is a general law\r\namong Americans that migration follows very nearly the parallels of\r\nlatitude from East to West. For this reason the northern portion of the\r\nstate was mostly settled by northern people whose sympathies were\r\nagainst slavery; while the southern portion of the state was mostly\r\nsettled by southern people, whose sympathies were in favor of slavery.\r\nThe state was nearly evenly divided, and the presence of these two\r\nparties kept up a continual friction and intensified the feeling on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nTo this general condition must be added the fact that Illinois was the\r\nhome of Douglas, who was personally and almost solely responsible for\r\nthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise. In that state he had risen from\r\nobscurity to be the most conspicuous man in the United States. His\r\nparty had a decided majority in the state, and over it he had absolute\r\ncontrol. He was their idol. Imperious by nature, shrewd, unscrupulous,\r\na debater of marvelous skill, a master of assemblies, a man who knew\r\nnot the meaning of the word fail--this was Douglas. But his home was in\r\nChicago, a city in which the anti-slavery sentiment predominated.\r\n\r\nWhen Douglas returned to his state, _his_ in more than one sense, it\r\nwas not as a conquering hero. He did not return direct from Washington,\r\nbut delayed, visiting various portions of the country. Possibly this\r\nwas due to the urgency of business, probably it was in order to give\r\ntime for the excitement to wear itself out. But this did not result,\r\nand his approach was the occasion of a fresh outbreak of feeling in\r\nChicago; the demonstrations of the residents of that city were not a\r\nflattering welcome home. Bells were tolled as for public mourning,\r\nflags were hung at half mast. Nothing was omitted that might emphasize\r\nthe general aversion to the man who had done that infamous deed.\r\n\r\nA public meeting was planned, at which he was to speak in defense of\r\nhis course. A large crowd, about five thousand people, gathered.\r\nDouglas was surrounded by his own friends, but the major portion of the\r\ncrowd was intensely hostile to him. When he began to speak the\r\nopposition broke out. He was interrupted by questions and comments.\r\nThese so exasperated him that he completely lost control of himself. He\r\nstormed, he shook his fist, he railed. The meeting broke up in\r\nconfusion. Then came a reaction which greatly profited him. The papers\r\npublished that he had attempted to speak and had not been allowed to do\r\nso, but had been hooted by a turbulent mob. All of which was true. By\r\nthe time he spoke again the sympathy of the public had swung to his\r\nside, and he was sure of a favorable hearing.\r\n\r\nThis second speech was on the occasion of the state fair at\r\nSpringfield. Men of all kinds and of every political complexion were\r\npresent from even the remotest localities in the state. The speech was\r\nto be an address to a large audience fairly representative of the\r\nentire state.\r\n\r\nLincoln was there. Not merely because Springfield was his home. He\r\ndoubtless would have been there anyhow. His ability as a politician,\r\nhis growing fame as a lawyer and a public speaker, his well-known\r\nantipathy to slavery, singled him out as the one man who was\r\npreeminently fitted to answer the speech of Douglas, and he was by a\r\ntacit agreement selected for this purpose.\r\n\r\nLincoln himself felt the stirring impulse. It is not uncommon for the\r\ncall of duty, or opportunity, to come once in a lifetime to the heart\r\nof a man with over-mastering power, so that his purposes and powers are\r\nroused to an unwonted and transforming degree of activity. It is the\r\nflight of the eaglet, the awakening of the lion, the transfiguration of\r\nthe human spirit. To Lincoln this call now came. He was the same man,\r\nbut he had reached another stage of development, entered a new\r\nexperience, exhibiting new powers,--or the old powers to such a degree\r\nthat they were virtually new. It is the purpose of this chapter to note\r\nthree of his speeches which attest this awakening.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was delivered at the state Fair at Springfield.\r\nDouglas had spoken October 3d, 1854. Lincoln was present, and it was\r\nmentioned by Douglas, and was by all understood, that he would reply\r\nthe following day, October 4th. Douglas was, up to that time, not only\r\nthe shrewdest politician in the country, but he was acknowledged to be\r\nthe ablest debater. He was particularly well prepared upon this\r\nsubject, for to it he had given almost his entire time for nearly a\r\nyear, and had discussed it in congress and out, and knew thoroughly the\r\ncurrent objections. The occasion was unusual, and this was to be, and\r\ndoubtless it was, his greatest effort.\r\n\r\nThe following day came Lincoln's reply. As a matter of fairness, he\r\nsaid at the outset that he did not want to present anything but the\r\ntruth. If he said anything that was not true, he would be glad to have\r\nDouglas correct him at once. Douglas, with customary shrewdness, took\r\nadvantage of this offer by making frequent interruptions, so as to\r\nbreak the effect of the logic and destroy the flow of thought. Finally\r\nLincoln's patience was exhausted, and he paused in his argument to say:\r\n\"Gentlemen, I cannot afford to spend my time in quibbles. I take the\r\nresponsibility of asserting the truth myself, relieving Judge Douglas\r\nfrom the necessity of his impertinent corrections.\" This silenced his\r\nopponent, and he spoke without further interruption to the end, his\r\nspeech being three hours and ten minutes long.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the speech was wonderful. The scene, as described next\r\nday in the Springfield _Journal_, is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n\"Lincoln quivered with feeling and emotion. The whole house was as\r\nstill as death. He attacked the bill with unusual warmth and energy,\r\nand all felt that a man of strength was its enemy, and that he meant to\r\nblast it if he could by strong and manly efforts. He was most\r\nsuccessful; and the house approved the glorious triumph of truth by\r\nloud and long-continued huzzas.... Mr. Lincoln exhibited Douglas in all\r\nthe attitudes he could be placed in a friendly debate. He exhibited\r\nthe bill in all its aspects to show its humbuggery and falsehoods, and\r\nwhen thus torn to rags, cut into slips, held up to the gaze of the vast\r\ncrowd, a kind of scorn was visible upon the face of the crowd, and upon\r\nthe lips of the most eloquent speaker.... At the conclusion of the\r\nspeech, every man felt that it was unanswerable--that no human power\r\ncould overthrow it or trample it under foot. The long and repeated\r\napplause evinced the feelings of the crowd, and gave token, too, of the\r\nuniversal assent to Lincoln's whole argument; and every mind present\r\ndid homage to the man who took captive the heart and broke like a sun\r\nover the understanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech itself, and the manner of its reception, could not other\r\nthan rouse Douglas to a tempest of wrath. It was a far more severe\r\npunishment than to be hooted from the stage, as he had been in Chicago.\r\nHe was handled as he had never been handled in his life. He took the\r\nplatform, angrily claimed that he had been abused, and started to\r\nreply. But he did not get far. He had no case. He became confused, lost\r\nhis self-control, hesitated, finally said that he would reply in the\r\nevening, and left the stage. That was the end of the incident so far as\r\nDouglas was concerned. When the evening came he had disappeared, and\r\nthere was no reply.\r\n\r\nTwelve days later, on October 16, Lincoln had promised to speak in\r\nPeoria. To that place Douglas followed, or preceded him. Douglas made\r\nhis speech in the afternoon, and Lincoln followed in the evening. It\r\nwas the same line of argument as in the other speech. Lincoln later\r\nconsented to write it out for publication. We thus have the Springfield\r\nand Peoria speech, _minus_ the glow of extemporaneous address, the\r\ninspiration of the orator. These are important factors which not even\r\nthe man himself could reproduce. But we have his own report, which is\r\ntherefore authentic. The most salient point in his speech is his reply\r\nto Douglas's plausible representation that the people of any locality\r\nwere competent to govern themselves. \"I admit,\" said Lincoln, \"that the\r\nemigrant to Kansas and Nebraska is competent to govern himself, but I\r\ndeny his right to govern any other person without that other person's\r\nconsent.\" This is the kernel of the entire question of human slavery.\r\n\r\nThe result of this speech at Peoria was less dramatic than that at\r\nSpringfield, but it was no less instructive. Douglas secured from\r\nLincoln an agreement that neither of them should again speak during\r\nthat campaign. It was quite evident that he had learned to fear his\r\nantagonist and did not wish again to risk meeting him on the rostrum.\r\nLincoln kept the agreement. Douglas did not. Before he got home in\r\nChicago, he stopped off to make another speech.\r\n\r\nThese speeches were made in 1854. It is now worth while to skip over\r\ntwo years to record another epoch-making speech, one which in spirit\r\nand temper belongs here. For it shows to what intensity Lincoln was\r\naroused on this vast and ever-encroaching subject of slavery. This was\r\nat the convention which was held in Bloomington for the purpose of\r\norganizing the Republican party. The date of the convention was May 29,\r\n1856. The center of interest was Lincoln's speech. The reporters were\r\nthere in sufficient force, and we would surely have had a verbatim\r\nreport--except for one thing. The reporters did not report. Let Joseph\r\nMedill, of the Chicago _Tribune_, tell why:\r\n\r\n\"It was my journalistic duty, though a delegate to the convention, to\r\nmake a 'long-hand' report of the speeches delivered for the Chicago\r\n_Tribune_. I did make a few paragraphs of what Lincoln said in the\r\nfirst eight or ten minutes, but I became so absorbed in his magnetic\r\noratory, that I forgot myself and ceased to take notes, and joined with\r\nthe convention in cheering and stamping and clapping to the end of his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nI well remember that after Lincoln had sat down and calm had succeeded\r\nthe tempest, I waked out of a sort of hypnotic trance, and then thought\r\nof my report for the _Tribune_. There was nothing written but an\r\nabbreviated introduction.\r\n\r\nIt was some sort of satisfaction to find that I had not been 'scooped,'\r\nas all the newspaper men present had been equally carried away by the\r\nexcitement caused by the wonderful oration, and had made no report or\r\nsketch of the speech.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Herndon, who was Lincoln's law partner, and who knew him so\r\nintimately that he might be trusted to keep his coolness during the\r\nenthusiasm of the hour, and who had the mechanical habit of taking\r\nnotes for him, because he was his partner, said: \"I attempted for about\r\nfifteen minutes, as was usual with me then, to take notes, but at the\r\nend of that time I threw pen and paper away and lived only in the\r\ninspiration of the hour.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the audience was generally, if not unanimously,\r\naffected in the same way. The hearers went home and told about this\r\nwonderful speech. Journalists wrote flaming editorials about it. The\r\nfame of it went everywhere, but there was no report of it. It therefore\r\ncame to be known as \"Lincoln's lost speech.\"\r\n\r\nPrecisely forty years afterwards one H. C. Whitney published in one of\r\nthe magazines an account of it. He says that he made notes of the\r\nspeech, went home and wrote them out. Why he withheld this report from\r\nthe public for so many years, especially in view of the general demand\r\nfor it, does not precisely appear. The report, however, is interesting.\r\n\r\nBut after the lapse of nearly half a century, it is a matter of minor\r\nimportance whether Mr. Whitney's report be accurate or not. To us the\r\nvalue of the three speeches mentioned in this chapter is found largely\r\nin the impression they produced upon the hearers. The three taken\r\ntogether show that Lincoln had waked to a new life. The lion in him was\r\nthoroughly roused, he was clothed with a tremendous power, which up to\r\nthis point had not been suspected by antagonists nor dreamed of by\r\nadmiring friends. This new and mighty power he held and wielded until\r\nhis life's end. Thenceforth he was an important factor in national\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTWO THINGS THAT LINCOLN MISSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's intimate friends have noted that he seemed to be under the\r\nimpression that he was a man of destiny. This phrase was a favorite\r\nwith Napoleon, who often used it of himself. But the two men were so\r\nwidely different in character and career, that it is with reluctance\r\nthat one joins their names even for the moment that this phrase is\r\nused. Napoleon was eager to sacrifice the whole of Europe to satisfy\r\nthe claims of his personal ambition; Lincoln was always ready to stand\r\naside and sacrifice himself for the country. The one was selfishness\r\nincarnate; the other was a noble example of a man who never hesitated\r\nto subordinate his own welfare to the general good, and whose career\r\ncame to its climax in his martyrdom. Whether the presidency was or was\r\nnot, Lincoln's destiny, it was certainly his destination. Had anything\r\noccurred to thrust him one side in this career, it would have prevented\r\nhis complete development, and would have been an irreparable calamity\r\nto his country and to the world.\r\n\r\nTwice in his life he earnestly desired certain offices and failed to\r\nget them. Had he succeeded in either case, it is not at all probable\r\nthat he would ever have become President. One therefore rejoices in the\r\nknowledge that he missed them.\r\n\r\nAfter his term in congress he was, in a measure, out of employment.\r\nPolitical life is like to destroy one's taste for the legitimate\r\npractise of the law, as well as to scatter one's clients. Lincoln was\r\nnot a candidate for reelection. Upon the election of General Taylor it\r\nwas generally understood that the democrats would be turned out of\r\noffice and their places supplied by whigs. The office of Land\r\nCommissioner was expected to go to Illinois. At the solicitation of\r\nfriends he applied for it, but so fearful was he that he might stand in\r\nthe way of others, or impede the welfare of the state, that he did not\r\nurge his application until too late. The President offered him the\r\ngovernorship of the territory of Oregon, which he declined. Had he been\r\nsuccessful in his application, it would have kept him permanently out\r\nof the study and practise of the law. It would have kept his residence\r\nin Washington so that it would not have been possible for him to hold\r\nhimself in touch with his neighbors. So far as concerned his\r\nillustrious career, it would have side-tracked him. He himself\r\nrecognized this later, and was glad that he had failed in this, his\r\nfirst and only application for a government appointment.\r\n\r\nAbout six years later he again missed an office to which he aspired.\r\nThis was in 1854, the year of the speeches at Springfield and Peoria\r\ndescribed in the last chapter. Shields, the man of the duel with broad-\r\nswords, was United States senator. His term of office was about to\r\nexpire and the legislature would elect his successor. The state of\r\nIllinois had been democratic,--both the senators, Shields and Douglas,\r\nwere democrats,--but owing to the new phases of the slavery question,\r\nthe anti-slavery men were able to carry the legislature, though by a\r\nnarrow margin.\r\n\r\nLincoln had been very useful to the party during the campaign and had\r\nbeen elected to the legislature from his own district. He wanted to be\r\nsenator. He was unquestionably the choice of nearly all the whigs. Had\r\nan election taken place then, he would undoubtedly have been elected.\r\n\r\nBut a curious obstacle intervened. There was a provision in the\r\nconstitution of Illinois which disqualified members of the legislature\r\nfrom holding the office of United States senator. Lincoln was therefore\r\nnot eligible. He could only become so by resigning his seat. There\r\nappeared to be no risk in this, for he had a safe majority of 605. It\r\nseemed as though he could name his successor. But there are many\r\nuncertainties in politics.\r\n\r\nThe campaign had been one of unusual excitement and it was followed by\r\nthat apathy which is the common sequel to all excessive activity. The\r\ndemocrats kept quiet. They put up no candidate. They fostered the\r\nimpression that they would take no part in the special election. Only\r\none democrat was casually named as a possible victim to be sacrificed\r\nto the triumph of the whigs. He was not a popular nor an able man, and\r\nwas not to be feared as a candidate for this office.\r\n\r\nBut the unusual quietness of the democrats was the most dangerous sign.\r\nThey had organized a \"still hunt.\" This was an adroit move, but it was\r\nperfectly fair. It is not difficult to guess whose shrewdness planned\r\nthis, seeing that the question was vital to the career of Douglas. The\r\ndemocratic party preserved their organization. The trusted lieutenants\r\nheld the rank and file in readiness for action. When the polls were\r\nopened on election day, the democrats were there, and the whigs were\r\nnot. At every election precinct appeared democratic workers to\r\nelectioneer for the man of their choice. Carriages were provided for\r\nthe aged, the infirm, and the indifferent who were driven to the polls\r\nso that their votes were saved to the party.\r\n\r\nThe whigs were completely taken by surprise. It was too late to talk up\r\ntheir candidate. They had no provision and no time to get the absent\r\nand indifferent to the polls. The result was disastrous to them.\r\nLincoln's \"safe\" majority was wiped out and a Douglas democrat was\r\nchosen to succeed him.\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised that this did not tend to fill the whigs with\r\nenthusiasm, nor to unite the party. From all over the state there arose\r\ngrumblings that the Sangamon contingent of the party had been so\r\nignobly outwitted. Lincoln had to bear the brunt of this discontent.\r\nThis was not unnatural nor unreasonable, for he was the party manager\r\nfor that district. When the legislature went into joint session Lincoln\r\nhad manifestly lost some of his prestige. It may be said by way of\r\npalliation that the \"still hunt\" was then new in politics. And it was\r\nthe only time that Lincoln was caught napping.\r\n\r\nEven with the loss to the whigs of this seat, the Douglas democrats\r\nwere in a minority. Lincoln had a plurality but not a majority. The\r\nbalance of power was held by five anti-Nebraska democrats, who would\r\nnot under any circumstances vote for Lincoln or any other whig. Their\r\ncandidate was Lyman Trumbull. After a long and weary deadlock, the\r\ndemocrats dropped their candidate Shields and took up the governor of\r\nthe state. The governor has presumably a strong influence with the\r\nlegislature, and this move of the partisans was a real menace to the\r\nanti-slavery men. Lincoln recognized the danger, at once withdrew his\r\ncandidacy, and persuaded all the anti-slavery men to unite on Trumbull.\r\nThis was no ordinary conciliation, for upon every subject except the\r\nNebraska question alone, Trumbull was an uncompromising democrat. The\r\nwhig votes gave him the necessary majority. The man who started in with\r\nfive votes won the prize. Lincoln not only failed to get into the\r\nsenate, but he was out of the legislature.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this defeat of Lincoln for the United States senate,\r\nthe present writer wishes first of all to disavow all superstitions and\r\nall belief in signs. But there is one fact which is worthy of mention,\r\nand for which different persons will propose different explanations. It\r\nis a fact that in all the history of the United States no person has\r\nbeen elected direct from the senate to the presidency. This is the more\r\ninteresting because the prominent senator wields a very powerful\r\ninfluence, an influence second only to that of the President himself.\r\nWhen one considers the power of a leading senator, one would suppose\r\nthat that was the natural stepping-stone to the presidency. But history\r\ndoes not support this supposition. It teaches the opposite.\r\n\r\nMany prominent senators have greatly desired to be president, but no\r\none has succeeded unless he first retired from the senate. Among the\r\nmore widely known aspirants to the presidency who have been\r\nunsuccessful, are Jackson (his first candidacy), Clay, Webster,\r\nDouglas, Morton, Seward, Sherman, and Blaine. So many failures may be a\r\nmere coincidence. On the other hand there may be a reason for them.\r\nThey seem to teach that the senate is not the best start for the\r\npresidential race, but the worst.\r\n\r\nThe history of ethics teaches that the most determined hostility\r\nagainst the best is the good, not the bad. So it may be that in the\r\npolitics of this country, the greatest obstacle to the highest position\r\nmay be the next highest.\r\n\r\nThese facts, of course, do not prove that if Lincoln had been elected\r\nsenator in 1854, or in 1858 when he was the opposing candidate to\r\nDouglas, he would therefore have failed of election to the presidency.\r\nHe may have been an exception. He may have been the only one to break\r\nthis rule in over a hundred years. But the sequel proved that he was\r\nbest where he was. He remained among his people. He moused about the\r\nstate library, enduring criticism but mastering the history of slavery.\r\nHe kept a watchful eye on the progress of events. He was always alert\r\nto seize an opportunity and proclaim in trumpet tones the voice of\r\nconscience, the demands of eternal righteousness. But he waited. His\r\nhour had not yet come. He bided his time. It was not a listless\r\nwaiting, it was intensely earnest and active. Far more than he could\r\nrealize, he was in training for the stupendous responsibilities which\r\nshould in due time fall upon him. It is fortunate for all that he did\r\nnot learn to limit his powers to the arena of the senate, which, though\r\ngreat, is limited. He kept near to the people. When his hour struck, he\r\nwas ready.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we call his two failures escapes. He did not get the\r\ngovernment land office, he did not get the senatorship. He did get the\r\npresidency, and that in the crisis of the history of the nation. What\r\nis more, when he got that he was thoroughly furnished unto every good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of history there sometimes arises a man who has a\r\nmarvelous power of attaching others to himself. He commands a measure\r\nof devotion and enthusiasm which it is impossible fully to understand.\r\nSuch a man was Henry Clay. Under the fascination of his qualities\r\nLincoln lived. From childhood to maturity Clay had been his idol, and\r\nClay's party, the whig, nearly synonymous with all that was desirable\r\nin American politics. It was therefore no easy matter for Lincoln to\r\nleave the whig party. Nothing could accomplish this but the\r\novermastering power of a noble emotion.\r\n\r\nFrom childhood Lincoln had hated slavery. The fact that Kentucky was a\r\nslave state had its influence in his father's removal to Indiana. His\r\npersonal observations upon his journeys down the Mississippi River had\r\ngiven him a keener feeling on the subject. The persistent and ever-\r\nincreasing outrages of the slave power had intensified his hatred. The\r\ntime had come when he, and such as he, felt that other party questions\r\nwere of minor importance, and that everything else should for the time\r\nbe subordinated to the supreme question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThere were certain reasons why the whig party could not accomplish the\r\ndesired end. Its history had identified it with a different class of\r\nsubjects. Though Clay himself and a majority of his party were opposed\r\nto the extension of slavery, there were still pro-slavery men in its\r\nranks in sufficient numbers to prevent any real efficiency on the\r\nslavery question.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while the democratic party was overwhelmingly pro-\r\nslavery, there were anti-slavery democrats who, from their numbers,\r\nability, and character, were not to be overlooked. The election to the\r\nsenate of Lyman Trumbull as an anti-Douglas democrat had crystalized\r\nthis wing of the party. The fiasco of Lincoln's defeat when the whigs\r\nwere in a good plurality caused much discontent in that party. If the\r\nanti-slavery men were to be united for efficiency in opposing Douglas,\r\nit must be under another organization--a new party must be formed.\r\n\r\nIn this the newspapers took the initiative. A number of papers\r\neditorially called for a convention, which was really a mass meeting,\r\nfor there were no accredited delegates, and could be none. This met in\r\nDecatur on Washington's birthday, 1856. It was a motley assembly, from\r\na political standpoint. It included whigs, democrats, free-soilers,\r\nabolitionists, and know-nothings. Said Lincoln: \"Of strange,\r\ndiscordant, even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds.\"\r\nPoliticians were conspicuously absent, for it would imperil their\r\npolitical orthodoxy to be seen there. Lincoln was the principal one who\r\nhad anything to lose. He was consulted on all measures, and gave freely\r\nof his counsel. The proceedings ended with a dinner, at which he made a\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nHe was the most prominent man in the new movement, was popular\r\nthroughout the state, and was the logical candidate for governor. He\r\nwould have been highly gratified with the candidacy. But again he put\r\npersonal desires one side that the general good might not be\r\nendangered. He therefore proposed, in his after-dinner speech, for\r\nnomination a democrat who had a record of earnest opposition to the\r\nslave power. Refusing the use of his own name, he added: \"But I can\r\nsuggest a name that will secure not only the old whig vote, but enough\r\nanti-Nebraska democrats to give us the victory. That man is Colonel\r\nWilliam H. Bissell.\" Bissell was afterwards regularly nominated and\r\ntriumphantly elected. The meeting at Decatur called for a convention to\r\nbe held at Bloomington on the 29th of May.\r\n\r\nAbout the same thing had been going on in some other free states. On\r\nthe very day of the Decatur meeting there was a notable meeting for the\r\nsame purpose in Pittsburg. This was attended by E. D. Morgan, governor\r\nof New York, Horace Greeley, O. P. Morton, Zach. Chandler, Joshua R.\r\nGiddings, and other prominent men. They issued the call for the first\r\nnational convention of the republican party to be held in Philadelphia\r\nin June.\r\n\r\nIn May the Illinois convention assembled in Bloomington, and the most\r\nconspicuous person there was Lincoln. It was there that he made the\r\namazing speech already described. It was the speech which held even the\r\nreporters in such a spell that they could not report it. It is known in\r\nhistory as the \"lost speech,\" but the fame of it endures to this day.\r\n\r\nThe democratic convention met in Cincinnati early in June and nominated\r\nJames Buchanan to succeed Franklin Pierce. Thus Douglas was for a\r\nsecond time defeated for the nomination.\r\n\r\nThe republican convention met a few days later in Philadelphia. At that\r\ntime John C. Fremont was at the height of his fame. His character was\r\nromantic, and the record of his adventures was as fascinating as a\r\nnovel by Dumas. He had earned the name of \"pathfinder\" by crossing the\r\ncontinent. Although unauthorized, he had in California raised a\r\nmilitary company which was of material assistance to the naval forces\r\nof the United States against a Mexican insurrection. He was an ardent\r\nhater of slavery. He was precisely the man, as standard-bearer, to\r\ninfuse enthusiasm into the new party and to give it a good start in its\r\ncareer. He did this and did it well. The large vote which he polled\r\naugured well for the future.\r\n\r\nAll this we may claim without denying the fact that it was fortunate\r\nfor the party and for the country that he was not elected. There was no\r\ndoubt of his sincerity or his patriotism. But he lacked self-control,\r\nwariness, patience. He was hot-headed, extreme, egotistical. He never\r\ncould have carried the burdens of the first administration of the\r\nrepublican party.\r\n\r\nWhen the election was over, it was found that Buchanan had carried\r\nevery slave state except Maryland, which went to Fillmore. Fremont had\r\ncarried every New England state and five other northern states.\r\nBuchanan received 174 electoral votes; Fremont, 114; Fillmore, 8. The\r\npopular vote was, for Buchanan, 1,838,169; for Fremont, 1,341,264; for\r\nFillmore, 874,534. That was an excellent showing for the new party. It\r\nshowed that it had come to stay, and gave a reasonable hope of victory\r\nat the next presidential election.\r\n\r\nLincoln was at the head of the electoral ticket of the state of\r\nIllinois. He usually was on the ticket. He playfully called himself one\r\nof the electors that seldom elected anybody. In Illinois the honors of\r\nthe election were evenly divided between the two parties. Buchanan\r\ncarried the state by a handsome majority, but Bissell was elected\r\ngovernor by a good majority. Lincoln had faithfully canvassed the state\r\nand made nearly fifty speeches. One paragraph from a speech made in\r\nGalena should be quoted. The slave party had raised the cry of\r\nsectionalism, and had charged that the republicans purposed to destroy\r\nthe Union. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n\"But the Union, in any event, will not be dissolved. We don't want to\r\ndissolve it, and if you attempt it we won't let you. With the purse and\r\nsword, the army, the navy, and the treasury in our hands and at our\r\ncommand, you could not do it. This government would be very weak indeed\r\nif a majority with a disciplined army and navy and a well-filled\r\ntreasury could not preserve itself, when attacked by an unarmed,\r\nundisciplined minority. All this talk about the dissolution of the\r\nUnion is humbug, nothing but folly. We do not want to dissolve the\r\nUnion; you shall not.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were prophetic of the condition of the country and of his\r\nown policy four or five years later. But he apparently did not\r\napprehend that an unscrupulous administration might steal the army and\r\nthe munitions of war, scatter the navy, and empty the treasury.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December Lincoln spoke at a republican banquet in\r\nChicago. It was after the election, after Buchanan's supercilious\r\nmessage to congress. The purpose of the speech was to forecast the\r\nfuture of the young party. The following quotations may be read with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n\"He [Buchanan, in his message to congress] says the people did it. He\r\nforgets that the 'people,' as he complacently calls only those who\r\nvoted for Buchanan, are in a minority of the whole people by about four\r\nhundred thousand votes.... All of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan,\r\ntaken together, are a majority of four hundred thousand. But in the\r\nlate contest we were divided between Fremont and Fillmore. Can we not\r\ncome together for the future? Let every one who really believes, and is\r\nresolved, that free society is not and shall not be a failure, and who\r\ncan conscientiously declare that in the past contest he has done only\r\nwhat he thought best, let every such one have charity to believe that\r\nevery other one can say as much. Let bygones be bygones; let past\r\ndifferences as nothing be; and with steady eye on the real issue, let\r\nus re-inaugurate the good old 'central ideas' of the republic. We can do\r\nit. The human heart is with us; God is with us. We shall again be able\r\nto declare, not that 'all states as states are equal,' nor yet that\r\n'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better\r\ndeclaration, including these and much more, that 'all men are created\r\nequal.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was upon the wisdom of this plan that, four years later, he held the\r\nfoes of slavery united, while the foes of freedom were divided among\r\nthemselves. It was this that carried the party to its first victory and\r\nmade him president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe admiring friends of Douglas had given him the nickname of \"the\r\nlittle giant.\" To this he was fairly entitled. Physically he was very\r\nlittle. Intellectually he was a giant. He was in 1858 perhaps the most\r\nprominent man in the United States. He was the unquestioned leader of\r\nthe dominant party. He had been so long in public life that he was\r\nfamiliar with every public question, while upon the burning question of\r\nslavery he was the leader.\r\n\r\nLincoln was a giant physically, and it soon became evident that he was\r\nno less intellectually. These two men soon were to come together in a\r\nseries of joint debates. It was manifest that this would be a battle of\r\nintellectual giants. No other such debates have ever occurred in the\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nEvents led up to this rapidly and with the certainty of fate. In 1854\r\nLincoln had been candidate for the senate to succeed Shields, but his\r\nparty had been outwitted and he was compelled to substitute Trumbull.\r\nIn 1856 he was the logical candidate for governor, but he was of\r\nopinion that the cause would be better served permanently by placing an\r\nanti-slavery democrat in nomination. This was done and Bissell was\r\nelected. Now in 1858 the senatorial term of Douglas was about to expire\r\nand a successor would be chosen. Douglas was the candidate of his own\r\nparty. The republicans turned naturally and spontaneously to Lincoln,\r\nfor it would be no light task to defeat so strong an opponent.\r\n\r\nThe republican convention met in Springfield on the 16th of June.\r\nLincoln was by acclamation nominated \"as the first and only choice\" of\r\nthe republican party for United States senator. The above time-honored\r\nphrase was used sincerely on that occasion. There was great enthusiasm,\r\nabsolute unanimity.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the following day he addressed the convention in a\r\nspeech which has become historic. His opening words were:\r\n\r\n\"If we could first know where we are and whither we are tending, we\r\ncould better judge what to do and how to do it. We are now far into the\r\nfifth year since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object and\r\nconfident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation. Under the\r\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but\r\nhas constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a\r\ncrisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against\r\nitself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure\r\npermanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be\r\ndissolved--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will\r\ncease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\r\nEither the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\r\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is\r\nin the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as\r\nwell as new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech came quickly to be known as \"the house-divided-against-\r\nitself speech.\" By that name it is still known. Concluding he said:\r\n\"Our cause, then, must be entrusted to and conducted by its own\r\nundoubted friends, those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the\r\nwork, who do care for the result.... The result is not doubtful. We\r\nshall not fail. If we stand firm we shall not fail. Wise counsels may\r\naccelerate or mistakes delay it, but sooner or later the victory is\r\nsure to come.\" This was a strong speech, delivered before an audience\r\nof men of unusual ability, delegates who represented all parts of the\r\nstate. It was in no wise a harangue. It was entirely thoughtful and\r\nstrictly logical. The effect of it was to intensify the enthusiasm, and\r\nto spread it all through the state. It was a speech that Douglas could\r\nnot ignore, though he might misrepresent it. This he did by raising the\r\ncharge of sectionalism against his adversary.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks later, on the 9th of July, Douglas made an elaborate\r\nspeech in Chicago. Lincoln was in the audience. It was unofficially\r\narranged that he should reply. He did so the following evening. A week\r\nlater a similar thing occurred in Springfield. Douglas made a speech in\r\nthe afternoon to which Lincoln replied in the evening. Shortly after\r\nthis Lincoln wrote Douglas a letter proposing a series of joint\r\ndiscussions, or challenging him to a series of joint debates. Douglas\r\nreplied in a patronizing and irritating tone, asked for a slight\r\nadvantage in his own favor, but he accepted the proposal. He did not do\r\nit in a very gracious manner, but he did it. They arranged for seven\r\ndiscussions in towns, the locations being scattered fairly over the\r\nentire territory of the state.\r\n\r\nIf Illinois had before been \"the cynosure of neighboring eyes,\" much\r\nmore was it so now. Lincoln was by no means the most prominent anti-\r\nslavery man, but he was the only man in a position to beard his rival.\r\nThe proposed debates excited not only the interest of the state and the\r\nneighboring states, but from the East and the South all minds were\r\nturned to this tournament. It was not a local discussion; it was a\r\nnational and critical question that was at issue. The interest was no\r\nless eager in New York, Washington, and Charleston than in\r\nIndianapolis, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe two men had been neighbors for many years. They were together\r\nmembers of the legislature, first in Vandalia and then in Springfield.\r\nThey had frequently met socially in Springfield. Both paid marked\r\nattentions to the same young lady. Both had served in Washington City.\r\nDouglas was for most of his life an officeholder, so that in one way or\r\nanother Lincoln would be brought into association with him. But though\r\nthey met so frequently it is not probable that, before this time,\r\neither recognized in the other his supreme antagonist. After the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise Lincoln had, as already related, discussed\r\nDouglas with great plainness of speech. This had been twice repeated in\r\nthis year. But these were, comparatively speaking, mere incidents. The\r\ngreat contest was to be in the debates.\r\n\r\nIn the outset, Douglas had the advantage of prestige. Nothing succeeds\r\nlike success. Douglas had all his life had nothing but success. He\r\ntwice had missed the nomination for presidency, but he was still the\r\nmost formidable man in the senate. He was very popular in his own\r\nstate. He was everywhere greeted by large crowds, with bands of music\r\nand other demonstrations. He always traveled in a special car and often\r\nin a special train, which was freely placed at his disposal by the\r\nIllinois Central Railway. Lincoln traveled by accommodation train,\r\nfreight train, or wagon, as best he could. As both the men were\r\neveryday speaking independently between the debates, this question of\r\ntransportation was serious. The inconveniences of travel made a great\r\ndrain upon the nervous force and the health. One day when the freight\r\ntrain bearing Lincoln was side-tracked to let his rival's special train\r\nroll by, he good-humoredly remarked that Douglas \"did not smell any\r\nroyalty in this car.\"\r\n\r\nAnother fact which gave Douglas the advantage was the friendship and\r\nsympathy of Horace Greeley and others, who had much influence with the\r\nparty of Lincoln. Douglas had broken with Buchanan's administration on\r\na question relating to Kansas. The iniquity of the powers at Washington\r\nwent so far that even Douglas rebelled. This led Greeley and others to\r\nthink that Douglas had in him the making of a good republican if he was\r\nonly treated with sufficient consideration. Accordingly, all of that\r\ninfluence was bitterly thrown in opposition to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the two men were as diverse as their bodily appearance.\r\nDouglas was a master of what the ancient Greeks would have called\r\n\"making the worse appear the better reason.\" He was able to misstate\r\nhis antagonist's position so shrewdly as to deceive the very elect. And\r\nwith equal skill he could escape from the real meaning of his own\r\nstatements. Lincoln's characterization is apt: \"Judge Douglas is\r\nplaying cuttlefish--a small species of fish that has no mode of\r\ndefending himself when pursued except by throwing out a black fluid\r\nwhich makes the water so dark the enemy cannot see it, and thus it\r\nescapes.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln's method was to hold the discussion down to the point at issue\r\nwith clear and forcible statement. He arraigned the iniquity of slavery\r\nas an offense against God. He made the phrase \"all men\" of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence include the black as well as the white.\r\nSaid he: \"There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled\r\nto all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.... In the right to eat the bread, without the leave of\r\nanybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal\r\nof Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\" He quoted\r\nJefferson's remark, \"I tremble for my country when I remember that God\r\nis just.\" Mercilessly he analyzed Douglas's speeches and exposed his\r\nsophistry.\r\n\r\nThe forensic ability of the two men is suggestively indicated by the\r\nremark of a lady who heard them speak, and afterward said: \"I can\r\nrecall only one fact of the debates, that I felt so sorry for Lincoln\r\nwhile Douglas was speaking, and then _so_ sorry for Douglas while\r\nLincoln was speaking.\"\r\n\r\nThese debates occupied seven different evenings of three hours each.\r\nThe speeches were afterwards published in book form and had a wide\r\ncirculation. These speeches, numbering twenty-one in all, filled a\r\nlarge volume. It is not the purpose of this chapter to give an outline\r\nof the debates, it is only to give a general idea of their result. But\r\nout of them came one prominent fact, which so influenced the careers of\r\nthe two men that it must be briefly recorded. This went by the name of\r\n\"the Freeport doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first debate Douglas had asked Lincoln a series of questions.\r\nThe villainy of these questions was in the innuendo. They began, \"I\r\ndesire to know whether Lincoln stands to-day, as he did in 1854, in\r\nfavor of,\" etc. Douglas then quoted from the platform of a convention\r\nwhich Lincoln had not attended, and with which he had nothing to do.\r\nLincoln denied these insinuations, and said that he had never favored\r\nthose doctrines; but the trick succeeded, and the impression was made\r\nthat Douglas had cornered him. The questions, to all intents and\r\npurposes, were a forgery. This forgery was quickly exposed by a Chicago\r\npaper, and the result was not helpful to Douglas. It was made manifest\r\nthat he was not conducting the debates in a fair and manly way.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, the fact that these questions had been asked gave\r\nLincoln, in turn, the right to ask questions of Douglas. This right he\r\nused. For the next debate, which was to be at Freeport, he prepared,\r\namong others, the following question: \"Can the people of a United\r\nStates territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of\r\nthe United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the\r\nformation of a state constitution?\" If this were answered \"No,\" it\r\nwould alienate the citizens of Illinois. If it were answered \"Yes,\" it\r\nwould alienate the democrats of the South.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Freeport he met a number of friends and took counsel of\r\nthem. When he read question number two, the one above quoted, his\r\nfriends earnestly and unanimously advised him not to put that question.\r\n\"If you do,\" said they, \"you never can be senator.\" To which Lincoln\r\nreplied: \"Gentlemen, I am killing larger game. If Douglas answers, he\r\ncan never be President, and the battle of 1860 is worth a hundred of\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that Lincoln expected to be in 1860 the nominee of\r\nthe republican party. But he did see the danger of the election of\r\nDouglas to the presidency. He was willing to surrender the senatorial\r\nelection to save the country from a Douglas administration. The\r\nsacrifice was made. The prediction proved true. Lincoln lost the\r\nsenatorship, Douglas lost the presidency.\r\n\r\nThe popular verdict, as shown in the election, was in favor of Lincoln.\r\nThe republicans polled 125,430 votes; the Douglas democrats, 121,609,\r\nand the Buchanan democrats, 5,071. But the apportionment of the\r\nlegislative districts was such that Douglas had a majority on the joint\r\nballot of the legislature. He received 54 votes to 46 for Lincoln. This\r\nsecured his reelection to the senate.\r\n\r\nThe popular verdict outside the state of Illinois was in favor of\r\nLincoln. The republican party circulated the volume containing the full\r\nreport of the speeches. It does not appear that the democrats did so.\r\nThis forces the conclusion that the intellectual and moral victory was\r\non the side of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThere is a pathetic sequel to this. The campaign had been very arduous\r\non Lincoln. Douglas had made 130 speeches in 100 days, not counting\r\nSundays. Lincoln had made probably about the same number. These were\r\nnot brief addresses from a railway car, but fully elaborated speeches.\r\nThe labors commenced early in July and continued through the heat of\r\nthe summer. With Lincoln the inadequate means of travel added to the\r\ndraft upon his strength. At the end of all came the triumphant election\r\nof his rival. Add to this the fact that the next day he received a\r\nletter from the republican committee saying that their funds would not\r\nmeet the bills, and asking for an additional contribution. The rest is\r\nbest told in Lincoln's own words:\r\n\r\n\"Yours of the 15th is just received. I wrote you the same day. As to\r\nthe pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability, but\r\nI am the poorest hand living to get others to pay. I have been on\r\nexpense so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without\r\nmoney now for even household purposes. Still, if you can put up $250\r\nfor me towards discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow it\r\nwhen you and I settle the private matter between us. This, with what I\r\nhave already paid, and with an outstanding note of mine, will exceed my\r\nsubscription of $500. This, too, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses\r\nduring the campaign, all which, being added to my loss of time and\r\nbusiness, bears pretty heavily on one no better off in world's goods\r\nthan I; but as I had the post of honor, it is not for me to be over-\r\nnice. You are feeling badly--'And this, too, shall pass away.' Never\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nGROWING AUDACITY OF THE SLAVE POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo closely is the life of Lincoln intertwined with the growth of the\r\nslave power that it will be necessary at this point to give a brief\r\nspace to the latter. It was the persistent, the ever-increasing, the\r\nimperious demands of this power that called Lincoln to his post of\r\nduty. The feeling upon the subject had reached a high degree of tension\r\nat the period we are now considering. To understand this fully, we must\r\ngo back and come once again down through the period already treated.\r\nThere are three salient points of development.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the fugitive slave law. At the adoption of the\r\nConstitution it was arranged that there should be no specific approval\r\nof slavery. For this reason the word \"slave\" does not appear in that\r\ndocument. But the idea is there, and the phrase, \"person held to\r\nservice or labor,\" fully covers the subject. Slaves were a valuable\r\nproperty. The public opinion approved of the institution. To set up one\r\npart of the territory as a refuge for escaped slaves would be an\r\ninfringement of this right of property, and would cause unceasing\r\nfriction between the various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, which happens to be the year of the invention of the cotton\r\ngin, the fugitive slave law was passed. This was for the purpose of\r\nenacting measures by which escaped slaves might be recaptured. This law\r\ncontinued in force to 1850. As the years passed, the operation of this\r\nlaw produced results not dreamed of in the outset. There came to be\r\nfree states, communities in which the very toleration of slavery was an\r\nabomination. The conscience of these communities abhorred the\r\ninstitution. Though these people were content to leave slavery\r\nunmolested in the slave states, they were angered at having the horrors\r\nof slave-hunting thrust upon them. In other words, they were unable to\r\nreside in any locality, no matter how stringent the laws were in behalf\r\nof freedom, where they were not liable to be invaded, their very homes\r\nentered, by the institution of slavery in its most cruel forms.\r\n\r\nThis aroused a bitter antagonism in the North. Societies were formed to\r\nassist fugitive slaves to escape to Canada. Men living at convenient\r\ndistances along the route were in communication with one another. The\r\nfugitives were passed secretly and with great skill along this line.\r\nThese societies were known as the Underground Railway. The\r\nappropriateness of this name is obvious. The men themselves who\r\nsecreted the fugitive slaves were said to keep stations on that\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nThis organized endeavor to assist the fugitives was met by an increased\r\nimperiousness on the part of the slave power. Slavery is imperious in\r\nits nature. It almost inevitably cultivates that disposition in those\r\nwho wield the power. So that the case was rendered more exasperating by\r\nthe passage, in 1850, of another fugitive slave law. Nothing could have\r\nbeen devised more surely adapted to inflame the moral sense of those\r\ncommunities that were, in feeling or conscience, opposed to slavery,\r\nthan this law of 1850. This was a reenactment of the law of 1793, but\r\nwith more stringent and cruel regulations. The concealment or assisting\r\nof a fugitive was highly penal. Any home might be invaded and searched.\r\nNo hearth was safe from intrusion. The negro could not testify in his\r\nown behalf. It was practically impossible to counteract the oath or\r\naffidavit of the pretended master, and a premium was practically put\r\nupon perjury. The pursuit of slaves became a regular business, and its\r\noperation was often indescribably horrible. These cruelties were\r\nemphasized chiefly in the presence of those who were known to be averse\r\nto slavery in any form, and they could not escape from the revolting\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of this was in what is known as the Dred Scott\r\ndecision. Dred Scott was a slave in Missouri. He was by his master\r\ntaken to Fort Snelling, now in the state of Minnesota, then in the\r\nterritory of Wisconsin. This was free soil, and the slave was, at least\r\nwhile there, free. With the consent of his former master he married a\r\nfree woman who had formerly been a slave. Two children were born to\r\nthem. The master returned to Missouri, bringing the negroes. He here\r\nclaimed that they, being on slave soil, were restored to the condition\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nScott sued for his freedom and won his case. It was, however, appealed\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States. The first opinion of the\r\ncourt was written by Judge Nelson. This treated of this specific case\r\nonly. Had this opinion issued as the finding of the court, it would not\r\nhave aroused general attention.\r\n\r\nBut the court was then dominated by the slave sentiment, and the\r\nopportunity of laying down general principles on the subject of slavery\r\ncould not be resisted. The decision was written by Chief Justice Taney,\r\nand reaches its climax in the declaration that the negro \"had no rights\r\nwhich the white man was bound to respect.\" Professor T. W. Dwight says\r\nthat much injustice was done to Chief Justice Taney by the erroneous\r\nstatement that he had himself affirmed that the negro \"had no rights\r\nwhich the white man was bound to respect.\" But while this may be\r\nsatisfactory to the legal mind, to the lay mind, to the average\r\ncitizen, it is a distinction without a difference, or, at best, with a\r\nvery slight difference. The Judge was giving what, in his opinion, was\r\nthe law of the land. It was his opinion, nay, it was his decision. Nor\r\nwas it the unanimous ruling of the court. Two justices dissented. The\r\nwords quoted are picturesque, and are well suited to a battle-cry. On\r\nevery side, with ominous emphasis in the North, one heard that the\r\nnegro had no rights which the white man was bound to respect. This was,\r\nuntil 1860, the last and greatest exhibition of audacity on the part of\r\nthe slave power.\r\n\r\nThere was another exhibition of the spirit of slavery which deserves\r\nspecial mention. This is the history of the settlement of Kansas. That\r\nremarkable episode, lasting from 1854 to 1861, requires a volume, not a\r\nparagraph, for its narration. It is almost impossible for the\r\nimagination of those who live in an orderly, law-abiding community, to\r\nconceive that such a condition of affairs ever existed in any portion\r\nof the United States. The story of \"bleeding Kansas\" will long remain\r\nan example of the proverb that truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise, in 1854, opened up to this free\r\nterritory the possibility of coming into the Union as a slave state. It\r\nwas to be left to the actual settlers to decide this question. This\r\nprinciple was condensed into the phrase \"squatter sovereignty.\" The\r\nonly resource left to those who wished Kansas to come in as a free\r\nstate was to settle it with an anti-slavery population.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in view, societies were formed in anti-slavery\r\ncommunities, extending as far east as the Atlantic coast, to assist\r\nemigrants. From Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, and elsewhere,\r\nemigrants poured into Kansas. But the slave party had the advantage of\r\ngeographical location. The slave state of Missouri was only just across\r\nthe river. It was able, at short notice and with little expense, to\r\npour out its population in large numbers. This it did. Many went from\r\nMissouri as actual settlers. By far the larger part went only\r\ntemporarily and for the purpose of creating a disturbance. These were\r\npopularly called \"border ruffians.\" Their excesses of ruffianism are\r\nnot easily described. They went into the territory for the purpose of\r\ndriving out all the settlers who had come in under the emigrant aid\r\nsocieties. Murder was common. At the elections, they practised\r\nintimidation and every form of election fraud then known. Every\r\nelection was contested, and both parties always claimed the victory.\r\nThe parties elected two separate legislatures, adopted two\r\nconstitutions, established two capitals. For several years, civil war\r\nand anarchy prevailed.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, either reasonable or unreasonable,--there is no\r\ndoubt whatever that the anti-slavery men had a vast majority of actual\r\nsettlers. The territorial governors were appointed by Presidents Pierce\r\nand Buchanan. These were uniformly pro-slavery and extremely partisan.\r\nBut every governor quickly came to side with the free-state men, or\r\nelse resigned to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery men, after the farce of a pretended vote, declared the\r\nLecompton constitution adopted. The governor at that time was Walker,\r\nof Mississippi, who had been appointed as a sure friend of the\r\ninterests of slavery. But even he revolted at so gross an outrage, and\r\nmade a personal visit to Washington to protest against it. It was at\r\nthis point, too, that Senator Douglas broke with the administration.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the overwhelming majority of anti-slavery settlers in the\r\nstate, Kansas was not admitted to the Union until after the\r\ninauguration of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nSo unscrupulous, imperious, grasping was the slave power. Whom the gods\r\nwish to destroy, they first make mad. The slave power had reached the\r\nreckless point of madness and was rushing to its own destruction. These\r\nthree manifestations,--the fugitive-slave law, the Dred Scott decision,\r\nand the anarchy in Kansas,--though they were revolting in the extreme\r\nand indescribably painful, hastened the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BACKWOODSMAN AT THE CENTER OF EASTERN CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's modesty made it impossible for him to be ambitious. He\r\nappreciated honors, and he desired them up to a certain point. But they\r\ndid not, in his way of looking at them, seem to belong to him. He was\r\nslow to realize that he was of more than ordinary importance to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAt the first republican convention in 1856, when Fremont was nominated\r\nfor President, 111 votes were cast for Lincoln as the nominee for vice-\r\npresident. The fact was published in the papers. When he saw the item\r\nit did not enter his head that he was the man. He said \"there was a\r\ncelebrated man of that name in Massachusetts; doubtless it was he.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1858, when he asked Douglas the fatal question at Freeport, he was\r\nsimply killing off Douglas's aspirations for the presidency. It was\r\nwith no thought of being himself the successful rival.\r\n\r\nDouglas had twice been a candidate for nomination before the democratic\r\nconvention. Had it not been for this question he would have been\r\nelected at the next following presidential election.\r\n\r\nAs late as the early part of 1860, Lincoln vaguely desired the\r\nnomination for the vice-presidency. He would have been glad to be the\r\nrunning-mate of Seward, nothing more. Even this honor he thought to be\r\nbeyond his reach, so slowly did he come to realize the growth of his\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Lincoln-Douglas debates had produced a profound\r\nsensation in the West. They were printed in large numbers and scattered\r\nbroadcast as campaign literature. Some Eastern men, also, had been\r\nalert to observe these events. William Cullen Bryant, the scholarly\r\neditor of the New York _Evening Post_, had shown keen interest in\r\nthe debates.\r\n\r\nEven after the election Lincoln did not cease the vigor of his\r\ncriticisms. It will be remembered that before the formal debate Lincoln\r\nvoluntarily went to Chicago to hear Douglas and to answer him. He\r\nfollowed him to Springfield and did the same thing. He now, after the\r\nelection of 1858, followed him to Ohio and answered his speeches in\r\nColumbus and Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, who was always watchful of the\r\ndevelopment of the anti-slavery sentiment, now invited Lincoln to\r\nlecture in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn. The invitation was accepted with\r\nthe provision that the lecture might be a political speech.\r\n\r\nJ. G. Holland, who doubtless knew whereof he wrote, declares that it\r\nwas a great misfortune that Lincoln was introduced to the country as a\r\nrail-splitter. Americans have no prejudice against humble beginnings,\r\nthey are proud of self-made men, but there is nothing in the ability to\r\nsplit rails which necessarily qualifies one for the demands of\r\nstatesmanship. Some of his ardent friends, far more zealous than\r\njudicious, had expressed so much glory over Abe the rail-splitter, that\r\nit left the impression that he was little more than a rail-splitter who\r\ncould talk volubly and tell funny stories. This naturally alienated the\r\nfinest culture east of the Alleghanies. \"It took years for the country\r\nto learn that Mr. Lincoln was not a boor. It took years for them to\r\nunlearn what an unwise and boyish introduction of a great man to the\r\npublic had taught them. It took years for them to comprehend the fact\r\nthat in Mr. Lincoln the country had the wisest, truest, gentlest,\r\nnoblest, most sagacious President who had occupied the chair of state\r\nsince Washington retired from it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he reached New York he found that there had been a change of plan,\r\nand he was to speak in Cooper Institute, New York, instead of Beecher's\r\nchurch. He took the utmost care in revising his speech, for he felt\r\nthat he was on new ground and must not do less than his best.\r\n\r\nBut though he made the most perfect intellectual preparation, the\r\nesthetic element of his personal appearance was sadly neglected. He was\r\nangular and loose-jointed,--he could not help that. He had provided\r\nhimself, or had been provided, with a brand-new suit of clothes,\r\nwhether of good material or poor we cannot say, whether well-fitting or\r\nill-fitting we do not know, though we may easily guess. But we do know\r\nthat it had been crowded into a small carpet-bag and came out a mass of\r\nwrinkles. And during the speech the collar or lappel annoyed both\r\nspeaker and audience by persisting in rising up unbidden.\r\n\r\nThese details are mentioned to show the difficulty of the task before\r\nthe orator. In the audience and on the platform were many of the most\r\nbrilliant and scholarly men of the metropolis. There were also large\r\nnumbers who had come chiefly to hear the westerner tell a lot of funny\r\nstories. The orator was introduced by Bryant.\r\n\r\nThe speech was strictly intellectual from beginning to end. Though\r\nLincoln was not known in New York, Douglas was. So he fittingly took\r\nhis start from a quotation of Douglas. The speech cannot be epitomized,\r\nbut its general drift may be divined from its opening and closing\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nThe quotation from Douglas was that which had been uttered at Columbus\r\na few months before: \"Our fathers, when they framed the government\r\nunder which we live, understood this question (the question of slavery)\r\njust as well, and even better, than we do now.\" To this proposition the\r\norator assented. That raised the inquiry, What was their understanding\r\nof the question? This was a historical question, and could be answered\r\nonly by honest and painstaking research.\r\n\r\nContinuing, the speaker said: \"Does the proper division of local from\r\nFederal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal\r\ngovernment to control as to slavery in our Federal territories? Upon\r\nthis Senator Douglas holds the affirmative and the republicans the\r\nnegative. This affirmation and denial form an issue, and this issue--\r\nthis question--is precisely what the text declares our fathers\r\nunderstood 'better than we.'\r\n\r\n\"I defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever\r\ndid, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I might almost\r\nsay prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century),\r\ndeclare that in his understanding any proper division of local from\r\nFederal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal\r\ngovernment to control as to slavery in the Federal territories. To\r\nthose who now so declare, I give, not only 'our fathers who framed the\r\ngovernment under which we live,' but with them all other living men\r\nwithin the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and\r\nthey shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\nOne paragraph is quoted for the aptness of its illustration: \"But you\r\nwill not abide the election of a republican President! In that supposed\r\nevent, you say you will destroy the Union; and then you say, the great\r\ncrime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A\r\nhighwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth,\r\n'Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a\r\nmurderer!' To be sure, what the robber demanded of me--my money--was my\r\nown, and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than\r\nmy vote is my own; and the threat of death to me to extort my money,\r\nand the threat of destruction to the Union to extort my vote, can\r\nscarcely be distinguished in principle.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech reached its climax in its closing paragraph: \"Wrong as we\r\nthink slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is,\r\nbecause that so much is due to the necessity arising from its actual\r\npresence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it,\r\nallow it to spread into the national territories, and to overrun us\r\nhere in the free states? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us\r\nstand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by\r\nnone of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so\r\nindustriously plied and belabored--contrivances such as groping for\r\nsome middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search\r\nfor a man who would be neither a living man nor a dead man; such as a\r\npolicy of 'don't care' on a question about which all true men do care;\r\nsuch as Union appeals to beseech all true Union men to yield to\r\nDisunionists; reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners,\r\nbut the righteous, to repentance; such as invocations to Washington,\r\nimploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\"Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against\r\nus, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government,\r\nnor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might,\r\nand in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we\r\nunderstand it.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech placed Lincoln in the line of the presidency. Not only was\r\nit received with unbounded enthusiasm by the mass of the people, but it\r\nwas a revelation to the more intellectual and cultivated. Lincoln\r\nafterwards told of a professor of rhetoric at Yale College who was\r\npresent. He made an abstract of the speech and the next day presented\r\nit to the class as a model of cogency and finish. This professor\r\nfollowed Lincoln to Meriden to hear him again. The _Tribune_ gave\r\nto the speech unstinted praise, declaring that \"no man ever before made\r\nsuch an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest compliment, because the most deliberate, was that of the\r\ncommittee who prepared the speech for general distribution. Their\r\npreface is sufficiently explicit:\r\n\r\n\"No one who has not actually attempted to verify its details can\r\nunderstand the patient research and historical labors which it\r\nembodies. The history of our earlier politics is scattered through\r\nnumerous journals, statutes, pamphlets, and letters; and these are\r\ndefective in completeness and accuracy of statement, and in indices and\r\ntables of contents. Neither can any one who has not traveled over this\r\nprecise ground appreciate the accuracy of every trivial detail, or the\r\nself-denying impartiality with which Mr. Lincoln has turned from the\r\ntestimony of 'the fathers' on the general question of slavery, to\r\npresent the single question which he discusses. From the first line to\r\nthe last, from his premises to his conclusion, he travels with a swift,\r\nunerring directness which no logician ever excelled, an argument\r\ncomplete and full, without the affectation of learning, and without the\r\nstiffness which usually accompanies dates and details. A single, easy,\r\nsimple sentence of plain Anglo-Saxon words, contains a chapter of\r\nhistory that, in some instances, has taken days of labor to verify, and\r\nwhich must have cost the author months of investigation to acquire.\"\r\n\r\nSurely Mr. Bryant and Mr. Beecher and the rest had every reason for\r\ngratification that they had introduced this man of humble beginnings to\r\nso brilliant a New York audience.\r\n\r\nLincoln went to Exeter, N.H., to visit his son who was in Phillips\r\nAcademy preparing for Harvard College. Both going and returning he made\r\nseveral speeches, all of which were received with more than ordinary\r\nfavor. By the time he returned home he was no longer an unknown man. He\r\nwas looked on with marked favor in all that portion of the country\r\nwhich lies north of Mason and Dixon's line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NOMINATION OF 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this chapter is the republican convention that nominated\r\nLincoln for the presidency. But for an intelligent narration of this,\r\nit is necessary to give a brief account of at least one of the three\r\nother important political conventions that were held that year. That\r\none was the regular democratic convention at Charleston. And certain\r\nother facts also must be narrated.\r\n\r\nLeaven was working in two respects. The first is that the plan of\r\nsecession and of setting up a Southern nation founded upon slavery, was\r\nnot a sudden or impromptu thought. The evidence is conclusive that the\r\nplan had been maturing for years. Recent events had shown that slavery\r\nhad reached the limit of its development so far as concerned the\r\nterritory of the United States. The plan to annex Cuba as a garden for\r\nthe culture of slavery, had failed. California had been admitted as a\r\nfree state. Slavery had been excluded from Kansas, although that\r\nterritory had for two years been denied admission to the sisterhood of\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nAs the slave power was not content with any limitation whatever, its\r\nleaders now looked for an opportunity to break up this present\r\ngovernment and start a new one. At the time (December, 1860) South\r\nCarolina passed the ordinance of secession, to be narrated later,\r\ncertain things were said which may be quoted here. These utterances\r\nexposed the spirit that animated the slave power long before Lincoln's\r\nelection, long before he was even known in politics.\r\n\r\nParker said that the movement of secession had been \"gradually\r\nculminating for _a long series of years_.\"\r\n\r\nInglis endorsed the remark and added, \"Most of us have had this matter\r\nunder consideration for the last twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nKeitt said, \"I have been engaged in this movement _ever since I\r\nentered political life_.\"\r\n\r\nRhett said, \"The secession of South Carolina was not the event of a\r\nday. It is not anything produced by Mr. Lincoln's election, or by the\r\nnon-execution of the fugitive slave law. It is a matter which has been\r\ngathering head _for thirty years_. The election of Lincoln and\r\nHamlin was the last straw on the back of the camel. But it was not the\r\nonly one. The back was nearly broken before.\r\n\r\nThe other important fact was the result of Lincoln's Freeport question.\r\nThe answer of Douglas was: \"I answer _emphatically_ ... that in my\r\nopinion the people of a territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery\r\nfrom its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution.\" This\r\nanswer satisfied the democrats of Illinois and secured his election to\r\nthe senate, as Lincoln predicted that it would. But it angered the\r\nsouthern leaders beyond all reason--as Lincoln knew it would.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the democratic convention met in Charleston, the first\r\npurpose of the southern leaders was to defeat Douglas. In their\r\njudgment he was not orthodox on slavery. He was far the strongest\r\ncandidate before the convention, but he was not strong enough to secure\r\nthe two-thirds vote which under the rules of that party were necessary\r\nto a choice. After fifty-seven ballots, and a corresponding amount of\r\ndebating, the feeling of antagonism rising, continually higher, the\r\ncrisis came. The southern delegates withdrew from the convention and\r\nappointed a convention of their own to be held in Richmond. This was\r\ndone with the full knowledge that, if it accomplished anything, it\r\nwould accomplish the defeat of the party. It was probably done for this\r\nvery purpose,--to defeat the party,--so as to give an excuse, more or\r\nless plausible, for carrying out the matured plan of secession,\r\nclaiming to be injured or alarmed at the ascendancy of the republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, at least, Lincoln had no aspirations for the\r\npresidency. But he did aspire to the United States senate. He accepted\r\nhis defeat by Douglas in 1858 as only temporary. He knew there would be\r\nanother senatorial election in four years. When asked how he felt about\r\nthis defeat, he turned it into a joke, and said that he felt \"like the\r\nboy who had stubbed his toe, too badly to laugh, and he was too big to\r\ncry.\"\r\n\r\nHe had thought of being nominated as vice-president with Seward as\r\nPresident, which would have given him, if elected, a place in the\r\nsenate. He was glad of any possible prominence in the Chicago\r\nconvention, which was still in the future. For that would help his\r\nsenatorial aspirations when the time came. But as to anything higher,\r\nhe declared, \"I must in all candor say that I do not think myself fit\r\nfor the presidency.\" And he was an honest man. With the senate still in\r\nview, he added, \"I am not in a position where it would hurt me much not\r\nto be nominated [for president] on the national ticket; but I am where\r\nit would hurt some for me not to get the Illinois delegates.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at the beginning of the year 1860, Lincoln was in no sense in the\r\nrace for the presidential nomination. About that time a list of twenty-\r\none names of possible candidates was published in New York; Lincoln's\r\nname was not on the list. A list of thirty-five was published in\r\nPhiladelphia. Lincoln's name was not on that list. After the speech at\r\nCooper Institute the Evening Post mentioned Lincoln's name along with\r\nothers. That was the only case in the East.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois his candidacy developed in February and came to ahead at\r\nthe republican state convention at Decatur. Lincoln's name had been\r\nprominent in the preceding local conventions, and the enthusiasm was\r\ngrowing. Decatur was very near to the place where Thomas Lincoln had\r\nfirst settled when he came into the state. When Abraham Lincoln came\r\ninto this convention he was greeted with an outburst of enthusiasm.\r\nAfter order had been restored, the chairman, Governor Oglesby,\r\nannounced that an old-time Macon County democrat desired to make a\r\ncontribution to the convention. The offer being accepted, a banner was\r\nborne up the hall upon two old fence rails. The whole was gaily\r\ndecorated and the inscription was:\r\n\r\n  ABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n  THE RAIL CANDIDATE\r\n  FOR PRESIDENT IN 1860.\r\n\r\n  Two rails from a lot of 3,000 made in 1830 by\r\n  Thos. Hanks and Abe Lincoln-whose\r\n  father was the first pioneer of\r\n  Macon County.\r\n\r\nThis incident was the means of enlarging the soubriquet \"Honest Abe\" to\r\n\"Honest Old Abe, the Rail-splitter.\" The enthusiasm over the rails\r\nspread far and wide. That he had split rails, and that he even had done\r\nit well, was no test of his statesmanship. But it was a reminder of his\r\nhumble origin, and it attached him to the common people, between whom\r\nand himself there had always been a warm feeling of mutual sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe democratic convention had, after the bolt of the extreme\r\nsoutherners, adjourned to Baltimore, where they duly nominated Douglas.\r\nWhat any one could have done for the purpose of restoring harmony in\r\nthe party, he did. But the breach was too wide for even that astute\r\npolitician to bridge over. Lincoln grasped the situation. It was what\r\nhe had planned two years before, and he confidently expected just this\r\nbreach. \"Douglas never can be President,\" he had said. He fully\r\nunderstood the relentless bitterness of the slave power, and he well\r\nknew that whatever Douglas might do for the northern democrats, he had\r\nlost all influence with the southern branch of that party. So Lincoln\r\ntold his \"little story\" and serenely awaited the result.\r\n\r\nThe second republican national convention met in Chicago, May 16, 1860.\r\nA temporary wooden structure, called a wigwam, had been built for the\r\npurpose. It was, for those days, a very large building, and would\r\naccommodate about ten thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe man who was, far and away, the most prominent candidate for the\r\nnomination, was William H. Seward, of New York. He had the benefit of\r\nthirty years of experience in political life. He was a man of wide\r\nlearning, fine culture, unequaled as a diplomatist; he was a patriot, a\r\nstatesman, and loyal to the principles of the republican party. He had\r\na plurality of the delegates by a wide margin, though not a majority.\r\nIt seemed a foregone conclusion that he would be nominated. Horace\r\nGreeley, who was determinedly opposed to him, gave up the contest and\r\ntelegraphed to his paper that Seward would be nominated. The\r\nopposition, he said, could not unite on any one man.\r\n\r\nThe next most prominent name was Lincoln. He had the full delegation of\r\nIllinois, who, at Decatur, had been instructed to vote for him as \"the\r\nfirst and only choice\" of the state. He had many votes, too, from the\r\nneighboring states.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two candidates before the convention, there were\r\nhalf a dozen others, all \"favorite sons\" of their own states, but who\r\nat no time developed any great strength.\r\n\r\nThe only point against Seward was his inability to carry certain\r\ndoubtful states. If the split in the democratic party had not occurred,\r\nand if the election were to be carried according to the experience of\r\n1856, it would be necessary for the republicans to carry certain states\r\nwhich they had at that time failed to carry. The most available states\r\nwere Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances, these could be carried. Seward's long public career had\r\ninevitably caused antagonisms, and these necessary states he could not\r\ncarry. The question with his opponents then was, Who is most likely to\r\ncarry these states? Lincoln's popularity in three of the four states\r\nnamed singled him out as the rival of Seward. It then became only a\r\nquestion whether the opposition to Seward could or could not unite in\r\nthe support of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAt this point there came in a political ruse which has been often used\r\nin later years. Seward's friends had taken to Chicago a small army of\r\nclaquers, numbering nearly or quite two thousand. These were\r\ndistributed through the audience and were apparently under orders to\r\nshout whenever Seward's name was mentioned. This gave the appearance of\r\nspontaneous applause and seemed to arouse great enthusiasm for the\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nLincoln's friends soon came to understand the situation and planned to\r\nbeat their rivals at their own game. They sent out into the country and\r\nsecured two men with phenomenal voices. It was said, with playful\r\nexaggeration, that these two men could shout so as to be heard across\r\nLake Michigan. They were made captains of two stentorian bands of\r\nfollowers. These were placed on opposite sides of the auditorium and\r\nwere instructed to raise the shout at a preconcerted signal and keep it\r\nup as long as desired. The plan worked.\r\n\r\nLeonard Swett describes the result: \"Caleb B. Smith of Indiana then\r\nseconded the nomination of Lincoln, and the West came to his rescue. No\r\nmortal before ever saw such a scene. The idea of us Hoosiers and\r\nSuckers being out-screamed would have been as bad to them as the loss\r\nof their man. Five thousand people at once leaped to their seats, women\r\nnot wanting in the number, and the wild yell made soft vesper\r\nbreathings of all that had preceded. No language can describe it. A\r\nthousand steam-whistles, ten acres of hotel gongs, a tribe of Comanches\r\nheaded by a choice vanguard from pandemonium, might have mingled in the\r\nscene unnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nA dramatic scene had occurred at the adoption of the platform. When the\r\nfirst resolution was read, Joshua E. Giddings, an old-time abolitionist\r\nof the extreme type, moved as an amendment to incorporate the words\r\nfrom the Declaration of Independence which announce the right of all\r\nmen to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" The hostility to\r\nthis amendment was not so much owing to an objection to the phrase, as\r\nto its being introduced upon the motion of so extreme a partisan as\r\nGiddings. The new party was made up of men of various old parties, and\r\nit was important that the moderate democrats should not be antagonized\r\nby the extreme abolitionists. The motion was lost by a decided vote,\r\nand the old man, almost broken-hearted, left the hall amid the\r\nprotestations of his associates.\r\n\r\nThere then came to his rescue a young man, about thirty-six years of\r\nage, who was then not widely known, but who since has more than once\r\ndecidedly influenced republican conventions at a critical stage of the\r\nproceedings. It was George William Curtis. When the second resolution\r\nwas under consideration he presented the amendment of Giddings in a\r\nform slightly modified. He then urged it in an impassioned speech, and\r\nby his torrent of eloquence carried the enthusiasm of the convention\r\nwith him. \"I have to ask this convention,\" he concluded, \"whether they\r\nare prepared to go upon the record before the country as voting down\r\nthe words of the Declaration of Independence.... I rise simply to ask\r\ngentlemen to think well before, upon the free prairies of the West, in\r\nthe summer of 1860, they dare to wince and quail before the assertion\r\nof the men of Philadelphia in 1776--before they dare to shrink from\r\nrepeating the words that these great men enunciated.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment was adopted in a storm of applause. Giddings, overjoyed\r\nat the result, returned to the hall. He threw his arms about Curtis\r\nand, with deep emotion, exclaimed,--\"God bless you, my boy! You have\r\nsaved the republican party. God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nThe candidates in those days were simply announced without speeches of\r\nglorification, Mr. Evarts of New York named Seward, and Mr. Judd of\r\nIllinois named Lincoln. The names of half a dozen \"favorite sons\" were\r\noffered by their states, the most important being Bates of Missouri.\r\nAfter the seconding of the nominations the convention proceeded to the\r\nballot. There were 465 votes, and 233 were necessary for a choice.\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot Seward received 173-1/2, and Lincoln, 102. The rest\r\nwere scattering. On the second ballot Seward received 184-1/2, and\r\nLincoln, 181. Seward was still ahead, but Lincoln had made by far the\r\ngreater gain. On the third ballot Seward received 180, and Lincoln 231-\r\n1/2. But this ballot was not announced. The delegates kept tally during\r\nthe progress of the vote. When it became evident that Lincoln was about\r\nelected, while the feeling of expectancy was at the highest degree of\r\ntension, an Ohio delegate mounted his chair and announced a change of\r\nfour Ohio votes from Chase to Lincoln. There was instantly a break. On\r\nevery side delegates announced a change of vote to Lincoln. The result\r\nwas evident to every one, and after a moment's pause, the crowd went\r\nmad with joy. One spectator has recorded the event:\r\n\r\n\"The scene which followed baffles all human description. After an\r\ninstant's silence, which seemed to be required to enable the assembly\r\nto take in the full force of the announcement, the wildest and\r\nmightiest yell (for it can be called by no other name) burst forth from\r\nten thousand voices which were ever heard from mortal throats. This\r\nstrange and tremendous demonstration, accompanied with leaping up and\r\ndown, tossing hats, handkerchiefs, and canes recklessly into the air,\r\nwith the waving of flags, and with every other conceivable mode of\r\nexultant and unbridled joy, continued steadily and without pause for\r\nperhaps ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It then began to rise and fall in slow and billowing bursts, and for\r\nperhaps the next five minutes, these stupendous waves of uncontrollable\r\nexcitement, now rising into the deepest and fiercest shouts, and then\r\nsinking, like the ground swell of the ocean, into hoarse and lessening\r\nmurmurs, rolled through the multitude. Every now and then it would seem\r\nas though the physical power of the assembly was exhausted, when all at\r\nonce a new hurricane would break out, more prolonged and terrific than\r\nanything before. If sheer exhaustion had not prevented, we don't know\r\nbut the applause would have continued to this hour.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Lincoln remained at Springfield, where he was in\r\ntelegraphic communication with his friends at Chicago, though not by\r\nprivate wire. At the time of his nomination he had gone from his office\r\nto that of the Sangamon _Journal_. A messenger boy came rushing up\r\nto him, carrying a telegram and exclaiming, \"You are nominated.\" The\r\nfriends who were present joyously shook his hands and uttered their\r\neager congratulations. Lincoln thanked them for their good wishes, and\r\nsaid \"There is a little woman on Eighth Street who will be glad to hear\r\nthis, and I guess I'll go up and carry her the news.\" Pocketing the\r\ntelegram he walked home.\r\n\r\nAt the wigwam, the news spread quickly. A man had been stationed on the\r\nroof as picket. He shouted, \"Hallelujah! Abe Lincoln is nominated. Fire\r\nthe cannon!\" The frenzy of joy spread to the immense throng of citizens\r\noutside the wigwam, then through the city, then through the state, then\r\nthrough the neighboring states. At Washington that night some one\r\nasked, \"Who is this man Lincoln, anyhow?\" Douglas replied, \"There won't\r\nbe a tar barrel left in Illinois' tonight.\" With unprecedented\r\nenthusiasm the republican party started on this campaign which led to\r\nits first victory in the election of Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, and\r\nHannibal Hamlin of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two things which made the campaign of 1860 paradoxical, so to\r\nspeak. One was that the nomination was equivalent to an election,\r\nunless unforeseen difficulties should arise. The other was that this\r\nelection might be used by the extreme Southern democrats as an excuse\r\nfor precipitating war. They threatened this.\r\n\r\nAfter the nomination the committee of the convention duly called on\r\nLincoln to give him the formal notification. This committee included\r\nsome names that were at that time, and still more so later, widely\r\nknown. Among them were three from Massachusetts: Ashmun, then Governor,\r\nand chairman of the Chicago convention, Bowles, editor of the\r\nSpringfield _Republican_, and Boutwell. There were also Gideon\r\nWelles, Carl Schurz, Francis P. Blair, and W. M. Evarts. The chairman\r\nof this committee notified Lincoln in a brief speech, to which he\r\nresponded with equal brevity. Even these few words impressed his\r\nhearers with a sense of dignity and manliness which they were only too\r\nglad to perceive. Said Mr. Boutwell: \"Why, sir, they told me he was a\r\nrough diamond. Nothing could have been in better taste than that\r\nspeech.\"\r\n\r\nOne who had opposed Lincoln in the convention said: \"We might have done\r\na more daring thing [than nominate him], but we certainly could not\r\nhave done a better thing.\" Carl Schurz evidently shared this feeling.\r\n\r\nJudge Kelly of Pennsylvania was a very tall man and was proud of the\r\nfact. During the brief ceremony he and Lincoln had been measuring each\r\nother with the eye. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the President-\r\nelect demanded:\r\n\r\n\"What's your height?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six feet three. What is yours, Mr. Lincoln?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six feet four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the judge, \"Pennsylvania bows to Illinois. My dear man,\r\nfor many years my heart has been aching for a President I could _look\r\nup to_, and I've found him at last in the land where we thought\r\nthere were none but _little_ giants.\"\r\n\r\nThe general feeling of the committee was that the convention had made\r\nno mistake. This feeling quickly spread throughout the entire party.\r\nSome of Seward's friends wanted him to run on an independent ticket. It\r\nis to his credit that he scouted the idea. The democrats, at least the\r\nopponents of Lincoln, were divided into three camps, The first was the\r\nregular party, headed by Douglas. The second was the bolting party of\r\nfire-eaters, who nominated Breckinridge. The third was the party that\r\nnominated Bell and Everett. This was wittily called the Kangaroo\r\nticket, because the tail was the most important part. Lincoln's popular\r\nvote at the November election was about forty per cent, of the total.\r\nIt was plain that if his supporters held together and his opponents\r\nwere divided, he could readily get a plurality. There were attempts on\r\nthe part of the opponents of Lincoln to run fusion tickets in New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania, so as to divert the electoral votes from\r\nhim; but these came to nothing more than that New Jersey diverted three\r\nof her seven electoral votes.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of the campaign was that all four candidates declared\r\nemphatically for the Union. Breckinridge, who was the candidate of the\r\nSouthern disunionists, wrote; \"The Constitution and the equality of the\r\nstates, these are symbols of everlasting union.\" Lincoln himself could\r\nhardly have used stronger language. Some people were doubtless deceived\r\nby these protestations, but not Douglas. He declared: \"I do not believe\r\nthat every Breckinridge man is a disunionist, but I do believe that\r\nevery disunionist in America is a Breckinridge man.\" During the period\r\nof nearly six months between nomination and election, Lincoln continued\r\nsimple, patient, wise. He was gratified by the nomination. He was not\r\nelated, for he was not an ambitious man. On the contrary, he felt the\r\nburden of responsibility. He was a far-seeing statesman, and no man\r\nmore distinctly realized the coming tragedy. He felt the call of duty,\r\nnot to triumph but to sacrifice. This was the cause of his seriousness\r\nand gravity of demeanor.\r\n\r\nThere was no unnecessary change in his simple manners and unpretentious\r\nmethod of living. Friends and neighbors came, and he was glad to see\r\nthem. He answered the door-bell himself and accompanied visitors to the\r\ndoor. Some of his friends, desiring to save his strength in these\r\nlittle matters, procured a negro valet, Thomas by name. But Abraham\r\ncontinued to do most of the duties that by right belonged to Thomas.\r\n\r\nSome one sent him a silk hat, that he might go to Washington with head-\r\ngear equal to the occasion. A farmer's wife knit him a pair of yarn\r\nstockings. Hundreds of such attentions, kind in intent, grotesque in\r\nappearance, he received with that kindness which is the soul of\r\ncourtesy. There was a woman at whose modest farmhouse he had once dined\r\non a bowl of bread and milk, because he had arrived after everything\r\nelse had been eaten up. She came into Springfield to renew her\r\napologies and to remind him that he had said that that repast was \"good\r\nenough for the President.\" While he commanded the respect of Bryant,\r\nSchurz, Boutwell, and such, he was at the same time the idol of the\r\nplain people, whom he always loved. He once said he thought the Lord\r\nparticularly loved plain people, for he had made so many of them.\r\n\r\nShortly after his nomination he was present at a party in Chicago. A\r\nlittle girl approached timidly. He asked, encouragingly, if he could do\r\nanything for her. She replied that she wanted his name. He looked about\r\nand said, \"But here are other little girls--they will feel badly if I\r\ngive my name only to you.\" She said there were eight of them in all.\r\n\"Then,\" said he, \"get me eight sheets of paper, and a pen and ink, and\r\nI will see what I can do for you.\" The materials were brought, and in\r\nthe crowded drawing-room he sat down, wrote a sentence and his name on\r\neach sheet of paper. Thus he made eight little girls happy.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was one of great excitement. His letter of acceptance was\r\nof the briefest description and simply announced his adherence to the\r\nplatform. For the rest, his previous utterances in the debates with\r\nDouglas, the Cooper Institute speech, and other addresses, were in\r\nprint, and he was content to stand by the record. He showed his wisdom\r\nin his refusing to be diverted, or to allow his party to be diverted,\r\nfrom the one important question of preventing the further extension of\r\nslavery. The public were not permitted to lose sight of the fact that\r\nthis was the real issue. The Chicago wigwam was copied in many cities:\r\ntemporary wooden structures were erected for republican meetings. These\r\ndid good service as rallying centers.\r\n\r\nThen the campaign biographers began to appear. It was said that by June\r\nhe had had no less than fifty-two applications to write his biography.\r\nOne such book was written by W. D. Howells, not so famous in literature\r\nthen as now. Lincoln furnished a sketch of his life, an \"autobiography\"\r\nso called. This contains only about five hundred words. Its brevity is\r\nan indication of its modesty.\r\n\r\nNor was there any lack of eulogistic music. Among the writers of\r\ncampaign songs were J. G. Whittier and E. C. Stedman.\r\n\r\nThe parading contingent of the party was represented by the \"Wide-\r\nAwakes.\" The uniform was as effective as simple. It consisted of a\r\ncadet cap and a cape, both made of oil-cloth, and a torch. The first\r\ncompany was organized in Hartford. It had escorted Lincoln from the\r\nhotel to the hall and back again when he spoke in that city in February\r\nafter his Cooper Institute speech. The idea of this uniformed company\r\nof cadets captivated the public fancy. Bands of Wide-Awakes were\r\norganized in every community in the North. At the frequent political\r\nrallies they poured in by thousands and tens of thousands, a very\r\npicturesque sight. The original band in Hartford obtained the identical\r\nmaul with which Lincoln had split those rails in 1830. It is now in the\r\ncollection of the Connecticut Historical Society, in Hartford.\r\n\r\nThough Lincoln had much to cheer him, he had also his share of\r\nannoyances. One of his discouragements was so serious, and at this day\r\nit appears so amazing, that it is given nearly in full. A careful\r\ncanvas had been made of the voters of Springfield, and the intention of\r\neach voter had been recorded. Lincoln had the book containing this\r\nrecord. He asked his friend Mr. Bateman, the State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction, to look through the book with him. They noted\r\nparticularly those who might be considered leaders of public morals:\r\nclergymen, officers, or prominent members of the churches.\r\n\r\nWhen the memorandum was tabulated, after some minutes of silence, he\r\nturned a sad face to Mr. Bateman, and said: \"Here are twenty-three\r\nministers, of different denominations, and all of them are against me\r\nbut three; and here are a great many prominent members of the churches,\r\na very large majority of whom are against me. Mr. Bateman, I am not a\r\nChristian--God knows I would be one--but I have carefully read the\r\nBible, and I do not so understand this book.\" He drew from his pocket a\r\nNew Testament. \"These men well know that I am for freedom in the\r\nterritories, freedom everywhere as far as the Constitution and laws\r\nwill permit, and that my opponents are for slavery. They know this, and\r\nyet, with this book in their hands, in the light of which human bondage\r\ncannot live a moment, they are going to vote against me. I do not\r\nunderstand it at all.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, he added with tears: \"I know there is a God, and\r\nthat He hates injustice and slavery. I see the storm coming, and I know\r\nthat His hand is in it. If He has a place and work for me--and I think\r\nHe has--I believe I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is everything. I\r\nknow I am right because I know that liberty is right, for Christ\r\nteaches it, and Christ is God. I have told them that a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand, and Christ and reason say the same; and\r\nthey will find it so. Douglas doesn't care whether slavery is voted up\r\nor voted down, but God cares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with\r\nGod's help I shall not fail. I may not see the end; but it will come\r\nand I shall be vindicated; and these men will find that they have not\r\nread their Bibles aright.\"\r\n\r\nAfter another pause: \"Doesn't it appear strange that men can ignore the\r\nmoral aspects of this contest? A revelation could not make it plainer\r\nto me that slavery or the government must be destroyed. The future\r\nwould be something awful, as I look at it, but for this rock [the\r\nTestament which he was holding] on which I stand,--especially with the\r\nknowledge of how these ministers are going to vote. It seems as if God\r\nhad borne with this thing [slavery] until the very teachers of religion\r\nhad come to defend it from the Bible, and to claim for it a divine\r\ncharacter and sanction; and now the cup of iniquity is full, and the\r\nvials of wrath will be poured out.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln did not wear his heart upon his sleeve. On the subject of\r\nreligion, he was reticent to a degree. Peter Cartwright had called him\r\nan atheist. There was a wide, if not general, impression, that he was\r\nnot a religious man. This did him great injustice. It is for this\r\nreason that his remarks to Mr. Bateman are here quoted at length. From\r\nhis early boyhood, from before the time when he was at great pains to\r\nhave a memorial sermon for his mother, he was profoundly, intensely\r\nreligious. He did no injustice to any other man, he did not do justice\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nThe election occurred on the sixth day of November. The vote was as\r\nfollows: Lincoln received 1,866,452 popular votes, and one hundred and\r\neighty electoral votes. Douglas received 1,375,157 popular votes, and\r\ntwelve electoral votes. Breckinridge received 847,953 popular votes,\r\nand seventy-two electoral votes. Bell received 590,631 popular votes,\r\nand thirty-nine electoral votes.\r\n\r\nLincoln carried all the free states, excepting that in New Jersey the\r\nelectoral vote was divided, he receiving four out of seven. In the\r\nfifteen slave states he received no electoral vote. In ten states not\r\none person had voted for him.\r\n\r\nOf the 303 electoral votes he had received 180, while the aggregate of\r\nall against him numbered 123, giving him an absolute majority of 57.\r\nThe electoral vote was duly counted in the joint session of the two\r\nhouses of congress February 13, 1861, and it was officially announced\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln, having received a majority of the votes of the\r\npresidential electors, was duly elected President of the United States\r\nfor four years, beginning March 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance is added which may be of interest to the reader. This\r\nwas published, after his death, by his personal friend, Noah Brooks. It\r\nis given in Lincoln's own words: \"It was just after my election, in\r\n1860, when the news had been coming in thick and fast all day, and\r\nthere had been a great 'Hurrah boys!' so that I was well tired out and\r\nwent home to rest, throwing myself upon a lounge in my chamber.\r\nOpposite to where I lay was a bureau with a swinging glass upon it; and\r\nlooking in that glass, I saw myself reflected nearly at full length;\r\nbut my face, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images, the tip\r\nof the nose of the one being about three inches from the tip of the\r\nother. I was a little bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and looked\r\nin the glass, but the illusion vanished. On lying down again, I saw it\r\na second time, plainer, if possible, than before; and then I noticed\r\nthat one of the faces was a little paler--say five shades--than the\r\nother. I got up, and the thing melted away, and I went off, and, in the\r\nexcitement of the hour, forgot all about it,--nearly, but not quite,\r\nfor the thing would once in a while come up, and give me a little pang\r\nas though something uncomfortable had happened. When I went home, I\r\ntold my wife about it, and a few days after I tried the experiment\r\nagain, when, sure enough, the thing came back again; but I never\r\nsucceeded in bringing the ghost back after that, though I once tried\r\nvery industriously to show it to my wife, who was worried about it\r\nsomewhat. She thought it was 'a sign' that I was to be elected to a\r\nsecond term of office, and that the paleness of one of the faces was an\r\nomen that I should not see life through the last term.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident is of no interest excepting in so far as everything about\r\nLincoln is of interest. The phenomenon is an optical illusion not\r\nuncommon. One image--the \"paler,\" or more indistinct, one--is reflected\r\nfrom the surface of the glass, while the other is reflected from the\r\nsilvered back of the glass. Though Lincoln understood that it was an\r\noptical illusion, yet the thought of it evidently weighed on him.\r\nOtherwise he would not have repeated the experiment several times, nor\r\nwould he have told of it to different persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFOUR LONG MONTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour months would not ordinarily be considered a long period of time.\r\nBut when one is compelled to see the working of a vast amount of\r\nmischief, powerless to prevent it, and knowing one's self to be the\r\nchief victim of it all, the time is long. Such was the fate of Lincoln.\r\nThe election was not the end of a life of toil and struggle, it was the\r\nbeginning of a new career of sorrow. The period of four months between\r\nthe election and inauguration could not be devoted to rest or to the\r\npleasant plans for a prosperous term of service. There developed a plan\r\nfor the disruption of the government. The excuse was Lincoln's\r\nelection. But he was for four months only a private citizen. He had no\r\npower. He could only watch the growing mischief and realize that he was\r\nthe ultimate victim. Buchanan, who was then President, had a genius for\r\ndoing the most unwise thing. He was a northern man with southern\r\nprinciples, and this may have unfitted him to see things in their true\r\nrelations. He certainly was putty in the hands of those who wished to\r\ndestroy the Union, and his vacillation precisely accomplished what they\r\nwished. Had he possessed the firmness and spirit of John A. Dix, who\r\nordered,--\"If any man attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot\r\nhim on the spot;\" had he had a modicum of the patriotism of Andrew\r\nJackson; had he had a tithe of the wisdom and manliness of Lincoln;\r\nsecession would have been nipped in the bud and vast treasures of money\r\nand irreparable waste of human blood would have been spared. Whatever\r\nthe reason may have been,--incapacity, obliquity of moral and political\r\nvision, or absolute championship of the cause of disruption,--certain\r\nit is that the southern fire-eaters could not have found a tool more\r\nperfectly suited to their purpose than James Buchanan. He was the\r\ncenter of one of the most astonishing political cabals of all history.\r\n\r\nLincoln did not pass indiscriminate condemnation upon all men of\r\nsouthern sympathies. At the time of which we are now writing, and\r\nconsistently up to the end of his life, he made a marked distinction\r\nbetween the rank and file of the Confederates on the one hand, and\r\nthose leaders who, on the other hand, had, while in the service of the\r\nUnited States government, sought to accomplish its destruction. The\r\nfirst were revolutionists; they were so regarded generally in Europe,\r\nand he believed they were sincere; he regarded them as having the\r\nspirit of revolutionists. For the second, who held office under, drew\r\npay from, and were under solemn oath to support, the government, while\r\nthey were using the vantage of their official position to violate the\r\nConstitution and disrupt that government, there is but one word, and\r\nthat a strong one,--traitors. This was Lincoln's judgment of the men.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly describe the situation. Jefferson Davis, though not\r\na member of Buchanan's cabinet, was probably the most influential of\r\nthe Southerners in Washington. He had been Secretary of War under\r\nPierce, and it was he who inaugurated the policy of stripping the North\r\nfor the purpose of strengthening the military defenses of the South.\r\nThis policy was vigorously pursued under his successor.\r\n\r\nThe only person to call a halt to the treasonable proceedings was\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott. He was residing in New York City, and on\r\nOctober 29th addressed a letter to President Buchanan containing his\r\nviews upon the situation. A day or two later he added supplementary\r\nconsiderations addressed to the Secretary of War. He set forth, with\r\nmuch clearness and force, the necessity of garrisoning the southern\r\nforts before they should be lost; His letter had its faults, but it\r\naccomplished one thing: it showed that there was one high official who\r\nwas in earnest in the discharge of his duties, and with whom it was not\r\nsafe to trifle.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan sent in his annual message to Congress December\r\n3, 1860. In his discussion of the subject of slavery, he recommended\r\nthat it be extended to the territories,--the very thing that the people\r\nhad just voted should not be done. Concerning secession, he said for\r\nsubstance that the government had the power to suppress revolt, but\r\nthat it could not use that power in reference to South Carolina, the\r\nstate then under consideration. The secessionists had apparently tied\r\nthe hands of the executive effectually.\r\n\r\nNow observe what was going on in the cabinet. Lewis Cass had been\r\nSecretary of State, but resigned in indignation over the inaction of\r\nthe President when he failed to succor the forts in Charleston Harbor.\r\nHe was succeeded by Jeremiah S. Black, who, as attorney-general, had\r\ngiven to Buchanan an opinion that the Federal government had no power\r\nto coerce a seceding state.\r\n\r\nHowell Cobb, Secretary of the Treasury, having wasted the funds and\r\ndestroyed the credit of the government, resigned and left an empty\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Floyd, Secretary of War, was not the least active. He carried\r\nout fully the plan which Jefferson Davis had begun to operate several\r\nyears before. The northern arsenals were stripped of the arms and\r\nammunition which were sent South for storage or use. The number of\r\nregular troops was small, but the few soldiers there were, he scattered\r\nin distant places, so that they should be out of reach. They were not\r\nto be available for the use of the government until the conspirators\r\nshould have time to complete their work. It was Floyd whom an emotional\r\nVirginian later eulogized. With quite as much truth as poetry he\r\ndeclared that the Secretary of War \"thwarted, objected, resisted, and\r\nforbade\" the efforts of General Scott. This same admirer of Floyd\r\nfurther declared that, if Scott's plans had been adopted and his\r\nmeasures executed, the conspiracy would have been defeated and it would\r\nhave been impossible to form the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nNot worse, perhaps, but more flagrant, was the action of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, Thompson of Mississippi. With the advice and consent\r\nof Buchanan, he left his post at Washington to visit North Carolina and\r\nhelp on the work of secession, and then returned and resumed his\r\nofficial prerogatives under the government he had sworn to sustain.\r\nThis is so grave a matter that a passage from the diary of Mr. Clingman\r\nis here inserted, quoted by Nicolay and Hay: \"About the middle of\r\nDecember (1860) I had occasion to see the Secretary of the Interior on\r\nsome official business. On my entering the room, Mr. Thompson said to\r\nme, 'Clingman, I am glad you have called, for I intended presently to\r\ngo up to the senate to see you. I have been appointed a commissioner by\r\nthe state of Mississippi to go down to North Carolina to get your state\r\nto secede.' ... I said to him, 'I did not know you had resigned.' He\r\nanswered, 'Oh, no! I have not resigned.' 'Then,' I replied, 'I suppose\r\nyou resign in the morning.' 'No,' he answered, 'I do not intend to\r\nresign, for Mr. Buchanan wished us all to hold on, and go out with him\r\non the 4th of March.' 'But,' said I, 'does Mr. Buchanan know for what\r\npurpose you are going to North Carolina?' 'Certainly,' he said, 'he\r\nknows my object.'\" In the meanwhile, Isaac Toucey, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, had been prevailed on to put the navy out of reach. The armed\r\nvessels were sent to the ends of the earth. At the critical period,\r\nonly two were available to the government. What was going on in\r\ncongress? That body was very busy doing nothing. Both senate and house\r\nraised committees for the purpose of devising means of compromise. But\r\nevery measure of concession was promptly voted down by the body that\r\nhad appointed the committees. In the senate the slave power was in full\r\ncontrol. In the house the slave power was not in majority, but they\r\nenjoyed this advantage that they were able to work together, while the\r\nconstituency of the free states were usually divided among themselves.\r\nAnd in joint session the extreme pro-slavery men were always able to\r\nprevent anything from being accomplished. This was all they wished.\r\nThey had sufficient pledges from the President that nothing would be\r\ndone before the 4th of March, and it was their belief that by that time\r\nthe new power would have so good a start that it could treat with the\r\nUnited States on equal terms. On January 7, 1861, Senator Yulee, of\r\nFlorida, wrote: \"By remaining in our places until the 4th of March, it\r\nis thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the\r\nrepublicans from effecting any legislation which will strengthen the\r\nhands of the incoming administration.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 14, thirty of the southern senators and representatives had\r\nissued a circular to their constituents. They said that the argument\r\nwas exhausted, that all hope of relief was extinguished, that the\r\nrepublicans would grant nothing satisfactory, and that the honor,\r\nsafety, and independence of the Southern people required the\r\norganization of a Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was the first to act. Six days later that state passed\r\nthe ordinance of secession.\r\n\r\nUpon this, one of the extreme traitors was forced out of the cabinet.\r\nFloyd, the mischievous Secretary of War, was displaced by Holt, a loyal\r\nman. Floyd, however, had done nearly, if not quite, all the mischief he\r\ncould have done. Stanton had already replaced Black as Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators then held a caucus. It is supposed that this caucus\r\nwas held in one of the rooms of the Capitol. At all events it was held\r\nin the city of Washington. It was composed of the extreme southern\r\ncongressmen. It decided to recommend immediate secession, the formation\r\nof the Southern Confederacy, and, not least, that the congressmen\r\nshould remain in their seats to keep the President's hands tied. The\r\ncommittee to carry out these plans consisted of Jefferson Davis,\r\nSlidell, and Mallory. By the first day of February, seven states had\r\npassed ordinances of secession.\r\n\r\nThis is about what was going on during the four months Lincoln was\r\nwaiting for the appointed time when he should enter upon his duties. It\r\nwas not unlike looking upon a house he was shortly to occupy, and\r\nseeing vandals applying the torch and ax of destruction, while he was\r\nnot permitted to go to the rescue, all the while knowing that he would\r\nbe held accountable for the preservation of the structure. So Lincoln\r\nsaw this work of destruction going on at Washington. It was plain that\r\nthe mischief ought to be, and could be, stopped. But Buchanan would not\r\nstop it, and Lincoln was, until March 4th, a private citizen and could\r\ndo nothing. The bitterest part of it was that all the burden would fall\r\non him. As soon as he should become President it would be his duty to\r\nsave the government which these men were now openly destroying.\r\n\r\nMiss Tarbell has recorded a conversation between Lincoln and his friend\r\nJudge Gillespie, which took place in Springfield early in January, in\r\nwhich the former expressed his feelings upon the situation.\r\n\"Gillespie,\" said he, \"I would willingly take out of my life a period\r\nin years equal to the two months which intervene between now and the\r\ninauguration, to take the oath of office now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because every hour adds to the difficulties I am called upon to meet\r\nand the present administration does nothing to check the tendency\r\ntowards dissolution. I, who have been called to meet this awful\r\nresponsibility, am compelled to remain here, doing nothing to avert it\r\nor lessen its force when it comes to me.... Every day adds to the\r\nsituation and makes the outlook more gloomy. Secession is being\r\nfostered rather than repressed.... I have read, upon my knees, the\r\nstory of Gethsemane, where the Son of God prayed in vain that the cup\r\nof bitterness might pass from him. I am in the garden of Gethsemane\r\nnow, and my cup of bitterness is full to overflowing\" (Tarbell, \"Life\r\nof Lincoln,\" II., 406).\r\n\r\nIt was indeed hard to keep his patience and self-control. He was\r\nimportuned for expressions of his views, for messages conciliatory to\r\nthe South, for some kind of a proclamation which might quiet the public\r\nfeeling. But he saw clearly that anything he might say at that time, no\r\nmatter how wise or conciliatory, would surely be misused as fuel to add\r\nto the flames. While therefore he talked and wrote freely to his\r\nfriends, he made no public announcement. He merely referred to his\r\nrecord. His opinions had been fully expressed in the debates with\r\nDouglas and in other speeches. There were four important points as to\r\nhis future policy. The Union should be preserved, the Constitution\r\nshould be upheld, and the fugitive slave law (being a law) should be\r\nenforced, but slavery should not be extended. These fully covered all\r\nthe necessary points of the subject, and beyond these he would not go.\r\nHe who would control others must first control himself. It is hard to\r\nimagine a more severe test than this imposed on Lincoln during this\r\nperiod of waiting. He made his preparations in silence, and not an\r\ninjudicious word escaped him. He left his home for Washington the 11th\r\nday of February, but though he made several speeches on the way, he did\r\nnot outline his policy until he read his inaugural address on the 4th\r\nof March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long period of waiting approached its end. Most of the states and\r\ncities lying between Springfield and Washington invited him officially\r\nto visit them on his way to the capital. It was decided that he should\r\naccept as many as possible of these invitations. This would involve a\r\nzigzag route and require considerable time. The invitation of\r\nMassachusetts he declined on account of the pressure of time. Maryland\r\nwas conspicuous by its omission of courtesy. Two private citizens of\r\nBaltimore invited him to dinner. That was all.\r\n\r\nThe presidential party consisted of about a dozen, all told. They were\r\nto leave Springfield February 11, and to consume about two weeks on the\r\nway. It was a dreary morning, partly drizzling, and partly snowing. A\r\nlarge crowd of neighbors had assembled at the dingy railway station to\r\nbid him good-by. The process of handshaking was interrupted by the\r\narrival of the train. After the party had entered the car, the\r\nPresident reappeared on the rear platform. He raised his hand to speak,\r\nbut did not utter a word until the solemn silence became painful. Then,\r\nwith great tenderness and seriousness, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of\r\nsadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these\r\npeople, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and\r\nhave passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been\r\nborn, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever\r\nI may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon\r\nWashington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever\r\nattended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance, I cannot fail.\r\nTrusting in Him who can go with me, and remain with you, and be\r\neverywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well.\r\nTo His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend\r\nme, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was telegraphed, with substantial accuracy all over the\r\ncountry, and was read with loving sympathy by millions of loyal\r\ncitizens. The words above given are the report as revised by Lincoln\r\nhimself, and first published in the _Century_ for December, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe party was in charge of Colonel Ward Hill Lamon, afterwards Marshal\r\nof the District of Columbia. He was a trained athlete, a Hercules in\r\nstrength, a man who knew not what fear was, and, with an enthusiasm\r\nakin to religious zeal, he was devoted to his chief soul and body. In\r\nthe words of a later Marshal, he \"worshiped every bone in his body.\"\r\n\r\nA few friends had accompanied the presidential party to Indianapolis,\r\nwhere the first stop was made. After the address of welcome by Governor\r\nMorton and the response, after the speech to the legislature, after the\r\nreception and the handshaking, they were left in quiet in the Bates\r\nHouse. These friends then took Lamon into a room, locked the door, and\r\nin the most solemn and impressive manner laid upon him the\r\nresponsibilities of guarding Lincoln's person until they should reach\r\nWashington. The scene was concluded by Dubois with a mixture of\r\nsolemnity and playfulness, who said: \"Now, Lamon, we intrust the sacred\r\nlife of Mr. Lincoln to your keeping; and if you don't protect it, never\r\nreturn to Illinois, for we will murder you on sight.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the exhortation nor the threat were in the least needed by\r\nLamon, who was thoroughly alert. But it is of interest in this, that it\r\nindicates that there was a wide-spread feeling that this journey was\r\nfraught with unusual dangers.\r\n\r\nOf course Lincoln made many brief speeches. These were closely scanned\r\nin the hope of finding some premonition of his inaugural. But not one\r\nsuch word escaped him. He complained that though he had in his day done\r\nmuch hard work, this was the hardest work he had ever done,--to keep\r\nspeaking without saying anything. It was not quite true that he did not\r\nsay anything, for the speeches were thoughtful and full of interest.\r\nBut he did not anticipate his inaugural, and to that the popular\r\ncuriosity was alive. He did not say the things that were uppermost in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nAt Indianapolis he asked pregnant questions: \"What, then, is\r\n'coercion'? What is 'invasion'?... If the United States should merely\r\nhold and retake its own forts and other property [in South Carolina\r\nthat had seceded], and collect the duties on foreign importations, or\r\neven withhold the mails from places where they were habitually\r\nviolated, would any, or all, of these things be 'invasion' or\r\n'coercion'?... Upon what principle, what rightful principle, may a\r\nstate, being no more than one-fiftieth part of the nation in soil and\r\npopulation, break up the nation, and then coerce a proportionally\r\nlarger subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What mysterious\r\nright to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country, with its\r\npeople, by merely calling it a state? Fellow-citizens, I am not\r\nasserting anything. I am merely asking questions for you to consider.\"\r\n\r\nAt Trenton, New Jersey, historic in the annals of the revolutionary\r\nwar, he spoke with simple candor of the influence upon his life of\r\nWeems' \"Life of Washington,\" one of the first books he ever read. The\r\naudience broke into cheers, loud and long, when he appealed to them to\r\nstand by him in the discharge of his patriotic duty. \"I shall\r\nendeavor,\" said he, \"to take the ground I deem most just to the North,\r\nthe East, the West, the South, and the whole country. I take it, I\r\nhope, in good temper; certainly with no malice towards any section. I\r\nshall do all that may be in my power to promote a peaceful settlement\r\nof all our difficulties. The man does not live who is more devoted to\r\npeace than I am, none who would do more to preserve it; but it may be\r\nnecessary to put the foot down firmly. And if I do my duty and do\r\nright, you will sustain me, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia he spoke in Independence Hall on Washington's Birthday,\r\nand raised a flag. \"Our friends,\" he said of it, \"had provided a\r\nmagnificent flag of our country. They had arranged it so that I was\r\ngiven the honor of raising it to the head of its staff. And when it\r\nwent up, I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my\r\nown feeble arm. When, according to the arrangement, the cord was\r\npulled, and it flaunted gloriously to the wind without an accident, in\r\nthe bright glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help hoping\r\nthat there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony at\r\nleast something of an omen of what is to come.\"\r\n\r\nOn this very day, President Buchanan, in Washington City, was\r\napologizing for permitting the American flag to be carried at the head\r\nof a procession that was marching to celebrate the birthday of George\r\nWashington!\r\n\r\nIt was at Philadelphia that matters became more exciting. At that place\r\nthey were informed of a plot to assassinate the President as he passed\r\nthrough Baltimore. This information came to them from a variety of\r\nsources entirely independent, and the various stories so nearly agreed\r\nin substance that they could not be disregarded. Most important of\r\nthese informants was Allan Pinkerton of Chicago, one of the most famous\r\ndetectives in the world. He had been personally with his assistants in\r\nBaltimore and knew the details of the plot. But Lincoln was neither\r\nsuspicious nor timid, and was therefore disinclined to pay heed to the\r\nwarnings of Pinkerton.\r\n\r\nAt about this time the son of William H. Seward met Lincoln with\r\nconfidential communications from his father. This gave other evidences\r\nof this plot, gathered by some detectives from New York City. These two\r\nsets of detectives had worked on the case; each party entirely ignorant\r\nof the other. Both got specific evidence of the plot.\r\n\r\nIt was remembered, too, that since leaving Springfield ten days before,\r\nthey had had at least two escapes. The track had been tampered with in\r\na manifest attempt to wreck the train. A hand grenade had been found in\r\none of the cars. It is not likely that this deadly machine was taken on\r\nthe train merely for fun.\r\n\r\nThe members of the party were deeply concerned about the Baltimore\r\nrevelations. But it was hard to get Lincoln to take them seriously.\r\nWith difficulty was he persuaded to follow Pinkerton's plan and enter\r\nWashington secretly. He consented to do this really out of\r\nconsideration for the judgment of others, not that he shared their\r\napprehension. On one thing, however, Lincoln was firm. He had made\r\ncertain appointments for speaking _en route_ which he would not\r\nabandon. His promise had been given and would be kept. One was the\r\nflag-raising at Philadelphia, narrated above, and the other was to\r\naddress the legislature at Harrisburg. \"Both these appointments,\" said\r\nhe, \"I will keep _if it costs me my life_.\" These words suggest\r\nthat he may have realized more of the danger than he was willing to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nThere are also intimations of the same thing which will be noticed by\r\nthe careful reader of the speeches at Philadelphia and Harrisburg. In\r\ndeclining to give a hint of the details of his proposed policy, he\r\nsaid: \"It were useless for me to speak of details of plans now; I shall\r\nspeak officially next Monday week, _if ever_. If I should not\r\nspeak then, it were useless for me to do so now.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"If this country cannot be saved without giving up that\r\nprinciple,--I was about to say that I would rather be _assassinated\r\non this spot_ than surrender it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd finally: \"I may have said something indiscreet. But I have said\r\nnothing but what I am willing to live by, and, if it be the pleasure of\r\nAlmighty God, _die by_.\"\r\n\r\nThese veiled references would pass unnoticed by the crowd, but they\r\nwould be perfectly intelligible to those who knew of the warnings that\r\nhad just been received. Lincoln was not in the habit of using such\r\nphrases, and the fact that he used them at this particular time can\r\nhardly be explained as a mere coincidence. He took in the situation,\r\nand--except for keeping the engagements already made--he submitted\r\nmeekly to Pinkerton's plans.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred at Harrisburg which made a great stir in the\r\nlittle party. This was nothing less than the loss of the manuscript of\r\nthe inaugural address. This precious document the President himself had\r\ncarried in a satchel. This satchel he had given to his son Robert to\r\nhold. When Robert was asked for it, it was missing. He \"_thought_\r\nhe had given it to a waiter--or somebody.\" This was one of the rare\r\noccasions on which Lincoln lost control of his temper, and for about\r\none minute he addressed the careless young man with great plainness of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons it was not judicious to say much about this loss.\r\nThe President applied to Lamon for help. \"Lamon,\" he whispered, \"I have\r\nlost my certificate of moral character written by myself. Bob has lost\r\nmy gripsack containing my inaugural address. I want you to help me find\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nLamon, who knew Lincoln intimately, said that he never saw him so much\r\nannoyed, nor, for the time, so angry. If the address were to be\r\npublished prematurely, it might be made the occasion of a vast amount\r\nof mischief. Then, too, it was the product of much painstaking thought\r\nand he had no duplicate copy.\r\n\r\nLincoln and Lamon instituted a search for the missing satchel and were\r\ndirected to the baggage-room of the hotel. Here they spied a satchel\r\nthat looked like the lost one. Lincoln tried the key. It fitted. With\r\ngreat joy he opened it, and he found within--one bottle of whisky, one\r\nsoiled shirt, and several paper collars. So quickly from the sublime to\r\nthe ridiculous.\r\n\r\nA little later the right satchel was found, and was not again entrusted\r\nto Robert. The President kept it in his own hands. After the nervous\r\nstrain was over, the humor of the situation grew on the President, and\r\nit reminded him of a little story.\r\n\r\nA man had saved up his earnings until they reached the sum of fifteen\r\nhundred dollars. This was deposited for safekeeping in a bank. The bank\r\nfailed and the man received as his share, ten per cent, or one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars. This he deposited in another bank. The second bank\r\nalso failed and the poor fellow again received ten per cent, or fifteen\r\ndollars. When this remnant of his fortune was paid over to him, he held\r\nit in his hand, looking at it thoughtfully. Finally he said: \"Now, I've\r\ngot you reduced to a portable shape, so I'll put you in my pocket.\"\r\nSuiting the action to the word, Lincoln took his \"certificate of moral\r\ncharacter\" from the satchel and carefully put it in the inside pocket\r\nof his vest. No further mishap came to that document.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Harrisburg to Washington was accomplished as planned,\r\nwith the assistance of certain officials of the railway and telegraph\r\ncompanies. First all the wires leading out of Harrisburg were cut, so\r\nthat, if Lincoln's departure were discovered, the news could not be\r\ncommunicated by telegraph. Then, after the reception, Lincoln, attended\r\nby Lamon, left the hotel by a side door and was driven to the railway\r\nstation. Here they found waiting a special train consisting of one\r\nbaggage car and one passenger car. The track was for the time kept\r\nentirely clear for this train. Arriving at Philadelphia they stopped\r\noutside the station, where Pinkerton met them with a closed carriage in\r\nreadiness. They were driven rapidly across the city to the Washington\r\ntrain which had been detained a few minutes for \"a sick passenger and\r\none attendant.\" They entered the rear door of the sleeping car. The\r\n\"sick passenger\" went to his berth at once and the attendant gave the\r\ntickets to the conductor who did not even see the \"sick passenger,\" and\r\nwho did not dream of what a precious life he was carrying. They arrived\r\nat six o'clock in the morning at Washington City, where they were met\r\nby Seward and Washburn and taken to Willard's Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party came on schedule time. At Baltimore there was a\r\nlarge crowd in waiting, but no disturbance. The news of the President's\r\narrival had been telegraphed over the country, and the band of\r\nassassins were for the time helpless. Their intended victim had\r\nescaped. There was no reason why they should create a disturbance.\r\n\r\nLincoln always regretted this \"secret passage.\" He later came to\r\ndiscount heavily the revelations of a professional spy. Long after, he\r\nsaid: \"I did not then, nor do I now, believe I should have been\r\nassassinated had I gone through Baltimore as first contemplated, but I\r\nthought it wise to run no risk where no risk was necessary.\"\r\n\r\nIt is positively asserted by Lamon, who knew whereof he spake, that\r\nthere was no time, from the moment of leaving Springfield to his death,\r\nwhen Lincoln was free from danger of murder. Yet he never could be\r\nprevailed on to accept precautions. What were the reasons for his\r\napparent carelessness?\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that he realized, more than he would have his\r\nfriends know, that he was surrounded by dangers. He probably realized\r\nthis more keenly than they did. They could locate specific dangers, but\r\nno man ever better understood the murderous spirit which underlay much\r\nof the hatred towards this man who had never harmed a human being. He\r\nfelt that an escape from one danger might be simply running into\r\nanother more deadly. It was like dodging bullets on the field of\r\nbattle. He, better than they, realized that the unseen dangers were\r\ngreater than those which they thought they had discovered. The only\r\nway, then, was to go straight ahead as if unmindful of all dangers.\r\n\r\nThen, too, though Lincoln could understand dangers in the abstract, his\r\nmind did not seem to be able to individualize them. He knew full well\r\nthat many persons wanted to kill him, but when it came to the point of\r\nthe murder being done by X, or Y, or Z, he did not believe it possible\r\nthat they would do such a thing.\r\n\r\nThese explanations are suggested. There may be others. But these two\r\nconflicting and paradoxical facts must be kept in mind. All through his\r\npublic life he was oppressed with the belief that he would not live to\r\nsee the end of the national crisis. On the other hand, not all the\r\nimportunities of his most devoted friends could persuade him to guard\r\nhimself. In the light of what we now know, it is wonderful that he\r\nescaped these plots for more than four years. Had he been more\r\ncautious, he might not have escaped so long. At the same time, as we\r\nshall presently see, had he heeded the last caution of his devoted\r\nfriend, he would not have been shot in 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeautiful for situation and beautiful in construction is the Washington\r\nCity of to-day. But it was not so in Lincoln's day. The proper\r\ndecoration of the city did not begin until Grant's administration. In\r\n1861 it was comparatively a small city. Its population numbered only\r\nabout 65,000. The magnificent modern residences had not been built. The\r\nhouses were few, low, not handsome, with hideous spaces of unimproved\r\nland lying between. The streets were not paved with asphalt. Some were\r\npaved with cobble stones, and some consisted of plain aboriginal mud.\r\nThe dome of the Capitol was but half finished when Lincoln saw it for\r\nthe first time, and the huge derrick which surmounted it was painfully\r\nsuggestive of the gallows. The approach was not a well-kept lawn, but a\r\nmeadow of grass, ragged and ill-cared for.\r\n\r\nWashington society was then, as always, composed of people of education\r\nand social culture, but it was not such as would kindle the enthusiasm\r\nof the patriot. From the time whereof the memory of man runneth not to\r\nthe contrary, it had been dominated by the slave power. The District of\r\nColumbia is situated in a slave state. The politics of South Carolina\r\nand Mississippi had always been aggressive, and the social leadership\r\nhad been the same. J. G. Holland estimated that not more than one in\r\nfive of the people in Washington in the winter of 1860-61 were glad to\r\nhave Lincoln come. He was not far from right. Lamon called the city \"a\r\nfocus of political intrigue and corruption.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years, specifically since 1848, the slave power had been\r\nmasterful in Washington, while its despotic temper had grown\r\ncontinually more assertive. The intellectual and moral atmosphere\r\nbecame increasingly repulsive to those who believed in freedom, and\r\nsuch people would not therefore choose that city as a place of\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nThe departments were of course filled with employees in sympathy with\r\nslavery. Pierce had been made President in 1853. The Missouri\r\nCompromise had been repealed in 1854. Buchanan came into office in\r\n1857. The crowning act of his administration was supporting the Kansas\r\ninfamy in 1859. From these indications it is easy to estimate the\r\npolitical status of Washington society when Lincoln entered the city\r\nFebruary 23, 1861. Many thousands of his friends poured in from all\r\nquarters north of Mason and Dixon's line to attend the ceremonies of\r\nthe inaugural. But these were transients, and foreign to the prevailing\r\nsentiment of the city.\r\n\r\nEvery official courtesy, however, was shown to the President-elect. The\r\noutgoing President and cabinet received him politely. He had many\r\nsupporters and some personal friends in both houses of congress. These\r\nreceived him with enthusiasm, while his opponents were not uncivil. The\r\nmembers of the Supreme Court greeted him with a measure of cordiality.\r\nBoth Douglas and Breckinridge, the defeated candidates at the late\r\nelection, called on him. The so-called Peace Conference had brought\r\ntogether many men of local influence, who seized the opportunity of\r\nmaking his acquaintance. So the few days passed busily as the time for\r\ninauguration approached.\r\n\r\nOf course anxiety and even excitement were not unknown. One instance is\r\nenough to relate here. Arrangements were about concluded for the\r\ncabinet appointments. The most important selection was for the\r\nSecretary of State. This position had been tendered to Seward months\r\nbefore and had by him been accepted. The subsequent selections had been\r\nmade in view of the fact that Seward was to fill this position. On\r\nSaturday, March 2d, while only a few hours remained before the\r\ninaugural, Seward suddenly withdrew his promised acceptance. This\r\nutterly upset the balancings on which Lincoln had so carefully worked\r\nfor the last four months, and was fitted to cause consternation.\r\nLincoln's comment was: \"I can't afford to have Seward take the first\r\ntrick.\" So he sent him an urgent personal note on the morning of March\r\n4th, requesting him to withdraw this refusal. Seward acceded to this\r\nand the matter was arranged satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the day of the inauguration was clear, mild, beautiful.\r\nThe military display gave a bright and showy appearance to the scene.\r\nGeneral Scott had used the utmost care to have the arrangements for the\r\ndefense of the President perfect. There were guards about the carriage,\r\nguards about the Capitol, a flying battery upon a commanding hill.\r\nBesides this, sharpshooters were posted on the roofs of the houses\r\nalong the route of travel, with injunctions to watch narrowly the\r\nwindows opposite and fire upon the first manifestation of disorder. One\r\ncannot resist the temptation to speculate upon the excitement that\r\nwould have developed had a mischievous boy set off a large fire-cracker\r\nat a critical moment!\r\n\r\nShortly after twelve o'clock, noon, Buchanan called to escort his\r\nsuccessor to the Capitol. The retiring President and the President-\r\nelect rode side by side through the streets. Reaching the grounds of\r\nthe Capitol they found an improvised board tunnel through which they\r\nwalked arm in arm to the building. This tunnel had been constructed to\r\nguard against assassination, of which there had recently been many\r\nthreats. They passed through the senate chamber and through the\r\nbuilding to the large platform which had been erected at the east\r\nfront. The procession was headed by the justices of the Supreme Court\r\nclothed in cap and gown.\r\n\r\nThe platform was densely packed, but in the number there were four men\r\nof especial interest. When Lincoln had first been nominated for the\r\nsenate, at Springfield, June 16, 1858, he made the speech which came to\r\nbe known as \"the house-divided-against-itself speech.\" One remarkable\r\nparagraph is here quoted:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the\r\nresult of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers,\r\ndifferent portions of which we know have been gotten out at different\r\ntimes and places and by different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger,\r\nand James, for instance--and when we see these timbers joined together,\r\nand see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the\r\ntenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and\r\nproportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective\r\nplaces, and not a piece too many or too few--not omitting even\r\nscaffolding--or, if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the\r\nframe exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring the piece in--in such a\r\ncase, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin\r\nand Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and\r\nall worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow\r\nwas struck.\"\r\n\r\nThe manifest reference here is to the co-workers for the extension of\r\nslavery: namely, Stephen A. Douglas, Franklin Pierce, Roger B. Taney,\r\nand James Buchanan. One of this number, Franklin, had fallen into\r\nwelcome oblivion; James had escorted Lincoln to the platform; Stephen\r\nstood immediately behind him, alert to show him any courtesy; and\r\nRoger, as Chief Justice, was about to administer the oath of office. It\r\nwas a rare case of poetic justice.\r\n\r\nLincoln was introduced to the vast audience by his former neighbor, E.\r\nD. Baker, at this time senator from Oregon. In one hand Lincoln had his\r\nsilk hat, and as he looked about for a place to put it, his old\r\nantagonist, Douglas, took it. To a lady he whispered: \"If I can't be\r\nPresident, I can at least hold the President's hat.\"\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address had been submitted confidentially to a few\r\ntrusted friends for criticism. The only criticisms of importance were\r\nthose of Seward. By these Lincoln was guided but not governed. A\r\nperusal of the documents will show that, while Seward's suggestions\r\nwere unquestionably good, Lincoln's finished product was far better.\r\nThis is specifically true of the closing paragraph, which has been\r\nwidely admired for its great beauty. From the remarkable address we\r\nquote only two passages. In the first he meets the charge that he would\r\ninvolve the country in war. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon\r\nme, that the laws of the Union shall be faithfully executed in all the\r\nstates. Doing this, which I deem to be only a simple duty on my part, I\r\nshall perfectly perform it, so far as is practicable, unless my\r\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisition,\r\nor in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will\r\nnot be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the\r\nUnion that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.\r\n\r\n\"In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall\r\nbe none unless it is forced upon the national authority. _The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the government, and collect the duties and\r\nimposts._ But beyond what may be necessary for these objects there\r\nwill be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the clause above italicised there was a general\r\nquestioning,--Does he mean what he says? In due time they learned that\r\nhe meant what he said, and all of it.\r\n\r\nThe address concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is\r\nthe momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you.\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You\r\nhave no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to 'preserve, protect, and defend' it.\r\n\r\n\"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds\r\nof affection. The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battle-\r\nfield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over\r\nthis broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again\r\ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe address was listened to closely throughout. Immediately upon its\r\nconclusion the speaker was sworn into office by Chief Justice Taney\r\nwhose name is connected with the famous Dred Scott decision. James\r\nBuchanan was now a private citizen and the pioneer rail-splitter was at\r\nthe head of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn all the thousands of people there assembled, there was no one who\r\nlistened more intently than Stephen A. Douglas. At the conclusion he\r\nwarmly grasped the President hand's, congratulated him upon the\r\ninaugural, and pledged him that he would stand by him and support him\r\nin upholding the Constitution and enforcing the laws. The nobler part\r\nof the nature of the \"little giant\" came to the surface. The clearness,\r\nthe gentleness, the magnanimity, the manliness expressed in this\r\ninaugural address of his old rival, won him over at last, and he\r\npledged him here his fealty. For a few months, while the storm was\r\nbrewing, Douglas was inactive, so that his influence counted on the\r\nside of the hostile party, the party to which he had always belonged.\r\nBut when war actually broke out, he hastened to stand by the President,\r\nand right nobly did he redeem his promise which he had given. Had he\r\nlived, there are few men whose influence would have been more weighty\r\nin the cause of the Union. An untimely death cut him off at the\r\nbeginning of this patriotic activity. His last public act was to\r\naddress to the legislature of Illinois a masterly plea for the support\r\nof the war for the Union. He died in Chicago on the 3d of June, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN HIS OWN PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the question been asked early in 1861, Who will be the real force\r\nof the republican administration? almost every unprejudiced observer\r\nwould have answered promptly, Seward. He was a man of unusual\r\nintellectual powers, of the best education, and of the finest culture.\r\nIn regard to the moral aspects of politics, he was on the right side.\r\nHe had a career of brilliant success extending over thirty years of\r\npractical experience. He had been governor of the Empire State, and one\r\nof the leading members of the United States senate. He was the most\r\naccomplished diplomatist of the day.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast was the President-elect. He had, in his encounters\r\nwith Douglas, shown himself a master of debate. But his actual\r\nexperience of administration was practically _nil_. He had served\r\na few years in a frontier legislature and one term in the lower house\r\nof congress. Only this and nothing more. His record as representative\r\nmay be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 comic speech on General Cass.\r\n\r\n  1 set of humorous resolutions, known as the spot resolutions.\r\n\r\n  1 bill in reference to slavery in the District of Columbia, which\r\n  bill failed to pass.\r\n\r\nThere was thus no comparison between the careers of the two men.\r\nSeward's friends, and Seward himself, assumed as a self-evident truth,\r\nthat \"where Seward sits is the head of the table.\" Lincoln did not\r\nassent to this proposition.\r\n\r\nHe considered himself President and head of the cabinet. How the matter\r\ncame out will appear later in the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a cabinet was a difficult and delicate task. It must\r\nbe remembered that Lincoln confronted a solid South, backed by a\r\ndivided North. It has already been said that in fifteen states he\r\nreceived not a single electoral vote, and in ten of these not a single\r\npopular vote. That was the solid South.\r\n\r\nThe divided condition of the North may be inferred from the following\r\nletter, written by ex-President Franklin Pierce to Jefferson Davis\r\nunder date of January 6, 1860:\r\n\r\n\"If, through the madness of Northern abolitionists, that dire calamity\r\n[the disruption of the Union] must come, the fighting will not be along\r\nMason and Dixon's line merely. It will be _within our own borders, in\r\nour own streets_, between the two classes of citizens to whom I have\r\nreferred. Those who defy law, and scout constitutional obligation,\r\nwill, if we ever reach the arbitrament of arms, find occupation enough\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain that unless Lincoln could, in a large measure, unite the\r\nvarious classes of the North, his utter failure would be a foregone\r\nconclusion. He saw this with perfect clearness. His first move was in\r\nthe selection of his cabinet. These selections were taken not only from\r\nthe various geographical divisions of the country, but also from the\r\ndivers political divisions of the party. It was not his purpose to have\r\nthe secretaries simply echoes of himself, but able and representative\r\nmen of various types of political opinion. At the outset this did not\r\nmeet the approval of his friends. Later, its wisdom was apparent. In\r\nthe more than a hundred years of cabinets in the history of the United\r\nStates there has never been an abler or a purer cabinet than this.\r\n\r\nAs guesses, more or less accurate, were made as to what the cabinet\r\nwould be, many \"leading citizens\" felt called on to labor with the\r\nPresident and show him the error of his ways. As late as March 2d there\r\nwas an outbreak against Chase. A self-appointed committee, large in\r\nnumbers and respectable in position, called on Lincoln to protest\r\nvigorously. He heard them with undivided attention. When they were\r\nthrough he replied. In voice of sorrow and disappointment, he said, in\r\nsubstance: \"I had written out my choice and selection of members for\r\nthe cabinet after most careful and deliberate consideration; and now\r\nyou are here to tell me I must break the slate and begin the thing all\r\nover again. I don't like your list as well as mine. I had hoped to have\r\nMr. Seward as Secretary of State and Mr. Chase as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. But of course I can't expect to have things just as I want\r\nthem.... This being the case, gentlemen, how would it do for us to\r\nagree to a change like this? To appoint Mr. Chase Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and offer the State department to Mr. Dayton of New Jersey?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dayton is an old whig, like Mr. Seward and myself. Besides, he is\r\nfrom New Jersey, which is next door to New York. Then Mr. Seward can go\r\nto England, where his genius will find wonderful scope in keeping\r\nEurope straight about our troubles.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"committee\" were astounded. They saw their mistake in meddling in\r\nmatters they did not understand. They were glad enough to back out of\r\nthe awkward situation. Mr. Lincoln \"took _that_ trick.\"\r\n\r\nThe names sent on March 5th were: for Secretary of State, William H.\r\nSeward, of New York; for Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, of\r\nOhio; for Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania; for\r\nSecretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, of Connecticut; for Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, Caleb B. Smith of Indiana; for Attorney-General, Edward\r\nBates, of Missouri; for Postmaster-General, Montgomery Blair, of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nAll these names were confirmed by the senate the next day, March 6th.\r\nOf the variety of the selection he said, \"I need them all. They enjoy\r\nthe confidence of their several states and sections, and they will\r\nstrengthen the administration. The times are too grave and perilous for\r\nambitious schemes and rivalries.\" To all who were associated with him\r\nin the government, he said, \"Let us forget ourselves and join hands,\r\nlike brothers, to save the republic. If we succeed, there will be glory\r\nenough for all.\" He playfully spoke of this cabinet as his happy\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe only one who withdrew early from this number, was Cameron. He was\r\naccused of various forms of corruption, especially of giving fat\r\ngovernment contracts to his friends. Whether these charges were true or\r\nnot, we cannot say. But in the following January he resigned and was\r\nsucceeded by Edwin M. Stanton, a lifelong democrat, one who had\r\naccepted office under Buchanan. Probably no person was more amazed at\r\nthis choice than Stanton himself. But he patriotically accepted the\r\ncall of duty. With unspeakable loyalty and devotion he served his chief\r\nand his country to the end.\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, Seward cheerfully assumed that he was\r\nthe government, while Lincoln's duties were to consist largely in\r\nsigning such papers as he instructed him to sign. As difficulties grew\r\nfast and thick, he wrote home, \"These cares fall chiefly on me.\" Mr.\r\nWelles wrote that confidence and mutual frankness existed among all the\r\nmembers of the cabinet, \"with the exception of Mr. Seward, who had, or\r\naffected, a mysterious knowledge which he was not prepared to impart.\"\r\nHe went so far as to meddle with the affairs of his associates. He did\r\nnot entirely approve of the cabinet meetings and served notice that he\r\nwould attend only upon special summons of the President.\r\n\r\nThis condition reached its climax on the first day of April, an\r\nappropriate date. Seward addressed on that day a document entitled,\r\n\"Some Thoughts for the President's Consideration, April 1, 1861.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Watterson said that Seward could not have spoken more explicitly\r\nand hardly more offensively if he had simply said: \"Mr. Lincoln, you\r\nare a failure as President, but turn over the direction of affairs\r\nexclusively to me, and all shall be well and all be forgiven.\" This\r\nstatement gives a fair and truthful idea of Seward's letter. It is not\r\nlikely that its amazing assurance has ever been equaled in any nation\r\nby \"thoughts\" addressed by an inferior officer to his chief. The paper\r\nitself is here omitted from lack of space, but its tenor can be guessed\r\nfrom the character of the reply, which is given in full:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION, April 1, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HON. W. H. SEWARD,\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: Since parting with you I have been considering your paper\r\ndated this day, and entitled 'Some Thoughts for the President's\r\nConsideration.' The first proposition in it is, 'First, We are at the\r\nend of a month's administration, and yet without a policy either\r\ndomestic or foreign.'\"\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of that month, in the inaugural, I said, 'The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and\r\nimposts.' This had your distinct approval at the time; and, taken in\r\nconnection with the order I immediately gave General Scott, directing\r\nhim to employ every means in his power to strengthen and hold the\r\nforts, comprises the exact domestic policy you now urge, with the\r\nsingle exception that it does not propose to abandon Fort Sumter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again, I do not perceive how the reinforcement of Fort Sumter would be\r\ndone on a slavery or party issue, while that of Fort Pickens would be\r\non a more national and patriotic one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The news received yesterday in regard to St. Domingo certainly brings\r\na new item within the range of our foreign policy; but up to that time\r\nwe have been preparing circulars and instructions to ministers and the\r\nlike, all in perfect harmony, without even a suggestion that we had no\r\nforeign policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon your closing propositions that 'whatever policy we adopt, there\r\nmust be an energetic prosecution of it,\"\r\n\r\n\"'For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct\r\nit incessantly,\"\r\n\r\n\"'Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while active\r\nin it, or\"\r\n\r\n\"'Devolve it on some member of his cabinet. Once adopted, debates on it\r\nmust end, and all agree and abide.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I remark that if this must be done, I must do it. When a general line\r\nof policy is adopted, I apprehend there is no danger of its being\r\nchanged without good reason or continuing to be a subject of\r\nunnecessary debate; still, upon points arising in its progress I wish,\r\nand suppose, I am entitled to have the advice of all the cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Your ob't serv't,\r\n   A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nThe courtesy, the convincing logic, the spirit of forbearance shown in\r\nthis letter, were characteristic of the man at the helm. It need hardly\r\nbe said that Seward never again tried the experiment of patronizing his\r\nchief. He saw a great light. He suddenly realized that these cares did\r\nnot fall chiefly on him.\r\n\r\nSo far as is known, neither gentleman ever made any reference to this\r\ncorrespondence. The result was worth while. It bound Seward to his\r\nPresident with hoops of steel. For four long, weary, trying years he\r\nserved his chief with a loyal devotion which did credit to both men.\r\nThus the hallucination that he was premier was forever dispelled. The\r\n\"Public Man\" wrote: \"There can be no doubt of it any longer. This man\r\nfrom Illinois is not in the hands of Mr. Seward.\"\r\n\r\nThere was surely no doubt of it. Lincoln was President. In the\r\ncouncils, the place where Lincoln sat was the head of the table. Seward\r\nwas his secretary. And a good secretary he was, as well as a true man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFORT SUMTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events connected with the fall of Fort Sumter were so dramatic that\r\nthat name is in memory linked with, and stands for, the opening of the\r\nwar. The fort was not a large military structure. The number of men\r\ndefending it was not great. But the events connected with it were\r\ngreat. It stood as the representative of great principles and facts.\r\nThe firing on it marked an epoch in the same sense as Caesar's crossing\r\nthe Rubicon. It is vitally connected with events that precede and\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips says that when Charles Sumner entered the senate, free\r\nspeech could hardly be said to exist there. To him, as much as to any\r\nman, was due the breaking of the chain that fettered free speech. On\r\nall important subjects he spoke his mind eloquently and in words that\r\nwere not ambiguous. In August, 1852, he made a speech--the more\r\naccurate phrase would be, he delivered an oration--under the title,\r\n\"Freedom National, Slavery Sectional.\" It may easily be guessed that\r\nthis highly incensed the slave power and the fire-eaters never outgrew\r\ntheir hatred of the Massachusetts senator.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1856, he delivered an excoriating address upon \"the Crime\r\nagainst Kansas.\" This greatly angered the southern congressmen. After\r\nthe senate had adjourned, Sumner was seated at his desk writing.\r\nPreston S. Brooks, of South Carolina, approached from the rear and with\r\na heavy cane began to beat Sumner on the head. He was not only\r\ndefenseless, but, though a powerful man in body, was to a certain\r\nextent held down by his desk, and it was only as he wrenched the desk\r\nfrom the floor that he was able to rise. The beating had been terrible\r\nand Sumner suffered from it, often with the most excruciating pains,\r\nuntil the day of his death. This ruffian attack was by a large portion\r\nof the North looked on as an exhibition of southern chivalry, so\r\ncalled, and not entirely without reason as the sequel showed. Congress\r\ncensured Brooks _by a divided vote_. He resigned but was reelected\r\nby his constituents with great enthusiasm. Thus his act was by them\r\nadopted as representative of their spirit and temper. This was his\r\n\"vindication.\"\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was the first state to secede, and since Fort Sumter\r\ncommanded Charleston Harbor, it instantly became the focus of national\r\ninterest. The Secretary of War, Floyd, had so dispersed the little army\r\nof the United States that it was impossible to command the few hundred\r\nmen necessary adequately to garrison the United States forts. As\r\nmatters in and about Charleston grew threatening, Major Anderson, who\r\nwas in command of the twin forts, Moultrie and Sumter, decided to\r\nabandon the former and do his utmost to defend the latter. The removal\r\nwas successfully accomplished in the night, and when the fact was\r\ndiscovered it was greeted by the South Carolinians with a howl of\r\nbaffled wrath. Buchanan had endeavored to send provisions. The steamer,\r\n_Star of the West_, had gone there for that purpose, but had been\r\nfired on by the South Carolinians and forced to abandon the attempt.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln took the government at Washington, it may well be believed\r\nthat he found matters in a condition decidedly chaotic. His task was\r\nmany sided, a greater task than that of Washington as he had justly\r\nsaid. First, of the fifteen slave states seven had seceded. It was his\r\npurpose to hold the remaining eight, or as many of them as possible. Of\r\nthis number, Delaware and Maryland could have been held by force.\r\nKentucky and Missouri, though slave states, remained in the Union. The\r\nUnion party in Tennessee, under the lead of Andrew Johnson, made a\r\nstrong fight against secession, but failed to prevent the ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe next task of Lincoln was to unite the North as far as possible. The\r\ndifficulty of doing this has already been set forth. On the other hand\r\nthere was in the North a sentiment that had been overlooked. It was\r\ndevotion to the flag. Benjamin F. Butler, though an ardent democrat,\r\nhad cautioned his southern brethren that while they might count on a\r\nlarge pro-slavery vote in the North, war was a different matter. The\r\nmoment you fire on the flag, he said, you unite the North; and if war\r\ncomes, slavery goes.\r\n\r\nNot the least task of the President was in dealing with foreign\r\nnations. The sympathies of these, especially England and France, were\r\nardently with the South. They would eagerly grasp at the slightest\r\nexcuse for acknowledging the Southern Confederacy as an independent\r\nnation. It was a delicate and difficult matter so to guide affairs that\r\nthe desired excuse for this could not be found.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the southerners were exceedingly exasperating. They kept\r\n\"envoys\" in Washington to treat with the government. Of course these\r\nwere not officially received. Lincoln sent them a copy of his inaugural\r\naddress as containing a sufficient answer to their questions. But they\r\nstayed on, trying to spy out the secrets of the government, trying to\r\nget some sort of a pledge of conciliation from the administration, or,\r\nwhat would equally serve the purpose, to exasperate the administration\r\ninto some unguarded word or act. Their attempts were a flat failure.\r\n\r\nLincoln held steadily to the two promises of his inaugural. First, that\r\nhe would hold the United States forts, and second, that he would not be\r\nthe aggressor. \"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and\r\nnot in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will\r\nnot assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the\r\naggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the\r\ngovernment; while I have the most solemn one to 'preserve, protect, and\r\ndefend' it.\"\r\n\r\nTo this plan he adhered. It there was to be war it must be begun by the\r\nenemies of the country, and the government would patiently bear\r\noutrages rather than do a thing which could be tortured into an\r\nappearance of 'invading the South' or being an aggressor of any sort.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Major Anderson was beleaguered in Fort Sumter. He had a\r\nhandful of men, 76 combatants and 128 all told. He had insufficient\r\nammunition and was nearly out of provisions. Lincoln at last concluded\r\nto \"send bread to Sumter,\"--surely not a hostile act. Owing to\r\ncomplications which he inherited from Buchanan's administration he had\r\ngiven to Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, a promise that he would\r\nnot attempt to relieve Sumter without first giving him notice. He now\r\nsent him notice that there would be an attempt to provision Sumter\r\npeaceably if possible, or otherwise by force.\r\n\r\nAll this while the southerners were busy perfecting their\r\nfortifications, which were now overwhelmingly better, both in number\r\nand in completeness of appointment, than the one fort held by the\r\nUnited States that rightfully controlled the entire harbor. General\r\nBeauregard was in command of the military forces. He sent to Major\r\nAnderson a summons to surrender. The latter replied that if he received\r\nfrom Washington no further direction, and if he was not succored by the\r\n15th of the month, April, he would surrender on honorable terms. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the southern general that he intercepted Major\r\nAnderson's mail before notifying him of hostilities. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Lincoln that he sent notice to Governor Pickens of\r\nthe intended provision of the fort.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, April 12th, 1861, at 3:30 P. M., General Beauregard gave\r\nnotice to Major Anderson that he would open fire on Fort Sumter in one\r\nhour. Promptly at the minute the first gun was fired and the war had\r\nbegun. Batteries from various points poured shot and shell into Sumter\r\nuntil nightfall caused a respite.\r\n\r\nThe little garrison sat up half the night after the attack, as they had\r\ndone the preceding night, and with their six needles, all they had,\r\nmade cartridges out of old blankets, old clothing, and whatever else\r\nthey could lay hands on. These one hundred and twenty-eight men made\r\nall the defense that could be made under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe next day the officer's quarters were set on fire either by an\r\nexploding shell or by hot shot. The men fought the flames gallantly,\r\nbut the wind was unfavorable. Then the water tanks were destroyed. As\r\nthe flames approached the magazine, the powder had to be removed. As\r\nthe flames approached the places where the powder was newly stored, it\r\nhad to be thrown into the sea to prevent explosion. In the mean time\r\nthe stars and stripes were floating gloriously. The flag pole had been\r\nstruck seven times on Friday. It was struck three times the next day.\r\nThe tenth shot did the work, the pole broke and the flag fell to the\r\nground at one o'clock Saturday afternoon. An officer and some men\r\nseized the flag, rigged up a jury-mast on the parapet, and soon it was\r\nflying again.\r\n\r\nBut ammunition was gone, the fire was not extinguished, and there was\r\nno hope of relief. Negotiations were opened and terms of surrender were\r\narranged by eight o'clock that evening. The next day, Sunday, April\r\n14th, the garrison saluted the flag as it was lowered, and then marched\r\nout, prisoners of war. Sumter had fallen.\r\n\r\nBeauregard was a military man, Lincoln was a statesman. The general got\r\nthe fort, the President got nearly everything else. The war was on and\r\nit had been begun by the South. The administration had not invaded or\r\nthreatened invasion, but the South had fired on the flag. Dearly they\r\npaid for this crime.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the fall of Sumter was amazing. In the South it was\r\nhailed with ecstatic delight, especially in Charleston. There was a\r\npopular demonstration at Montgomery, Ala., the provisional seat of the\r\nConfederate government. L. P. Walker, Confederate Secretary of War,\r\nmade a speech and, among other things, said that \"while no man could\r\ntell where the war would end, he would prophesy that the flag which now\r\nflaunts the breeze here, would float over the dome of the old Capitol\r\nat Washington before the end of May,\" and that \"it might eventually\r\nfloat over Fanueil Hall itself.\" The Confederate government raised a\r\nloan of eight millions of dollars and Jefferson Davis issued letters of\r\nmarque to all persons who might desire to aid the South and at the same\r\ntime enrich themselves by depredations upon the commerce of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the North was different. There was a perfect storm of\r\nindignation against the people who had presumed to fire on the flag.\r\nButler's prediction proved to be nearly correct. This did unite the\r\nNorth in defense of the flag. Butler was a conspicuous example of this\r\neffect. Though a Breckinridge democrat, he promptly offered his\r\nservices for the defense of the country, and throughout the war he had\r\nthe distinction of being hated by the South with a more cordial hatred\r\nthan any other Union general.\r\n\r\nIt was recollected throughout the North that Lincoln had been\r\nconciliatory to a fault towards the South. Conciliation had failed\r\nbecause that was not what the South wanted. They wanted war and by them\r\nwas war made. This put an end forever to all talk of concession and\r\ncompromise. Douglas was one of the many whose voice called in trumpet\r\ntones to the defense of the flag.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the fall of Sumter, Lincoln had been in office less than\r\nsix weeks. In addition to routine work, to attending to extraordinary\r\ncalls in great numbers, he had accomplished certain very important\r\nthings: He had the loyal devotion of a cabinet noted for its ability\r\nand diversity. He had the enthusiastic confidence of the doubtful minds\r\nof the North. He had made it impossible for the European monarchies to\r\nrecognize the South as a nation. So far as our country was concerned,\r\nhe might ask for anything, and he would get what he asked. These were\r\nno mean achievements. The far-seeing statesman had played for this and\r\nhad won.\r\n\r\nBeauregard got the fort, but Lincoln got the game. In his own words,\r\n\"he took _that_ trick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBURST OF PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Sumter caused an outburst of patriotism through the entire\r\nNorth such as is not witnessed many times in a century. On Sunday\r\nmorning, April 14th, it was known that terms of surrender had been\r\narranged. On that day and on many succeeding Sundays the voices from a\r\nthousand pulpits sounded with the certainty of the bugle, the call to\r\nthe defense of the flag. Editors echoed the call. Such newspapers as\r\nwere suspected of secession tendencies were compelled to hoist the\r\nAmerican flag. For the time at least, enthusiasm and patriotism ran\r\nvery high. Those who were decidedly in sympathy with the South remained\r\nquiet, and those who were of a doubtful mind were swept along with the\r\ntide of popular feeling. The flag had been fired on. That one fact\r\nunified the North.\r\n\r\nOn that same evening Senator Douglas arranged for a private interview\r\nwith President Lincoln. For two hours these men, rivals and antagonists\r\nof many years, were in confidential conversation. What passed between\r\nthem no man knows, but the result of the conference was quickly made\r\npublic. Douglas came out of the room as determined a \"war democrat\" as\r\ncould be found between the oceans. He himself prepared a telegram which\r\nwas everywhere published, declaring that he would sustain the President\r\nin defending the constitution.\r\n\r\nLincoln had prepared his call for 75,000 volunteer troops. Douglas\r\nthought the number should have been 200,000. So it should, and so\r\ndoubtless it would, had it not been for certain iniquities of\r\nBuchanan's mal-administration. There were no arms, accouterments,\r\nclothing. Floyd had well-nigh stripped the northern arsenals. Lincoln\r\ncould not begin warlike preparations on any great scale because that\r\nwas certain to precipitate the war which he so earnestly strove to\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nFurther, the 75,000 was about five times the number of soldiers then in\r\nthe army of the United States. Though the number of volunteers was\r\nsmall, their proportion to the regular army was large.\r\n\r\nThat night Lincoln's call and Douglas's endorsement were sent over the\r\nwires. Next morning the two documents were published in every daily\r\npaper north of Mason and Dixon's line.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteer soldiers was in the South greeted with a howl of\r\nderision. They knew how the arsenals had been stripped. They had also\r\nfor years been quietly buying up arms not only from the North, but also\r\nfrom various European nations. They had for many years been preparing\r\nfor just this event, and now that it came they were fully equipped.\r\nDuring the first months of the war the administration could not wisely\r\nmake public how very poorly the soldiers were armed, for this would\r\nonly discourage the defenders of the Union and cheer the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis call for troops met with prompt response. The various governors of\r\nthe northern states offered many times their quota. The first in the\r\nfield was Massachusetts. This was due to the foresight of ex-Governor\r\nBanks. He had for years kept the state militia up to a high degree of\r\nefficiency. When rallied upon this he explained that it was to defend\r\nthe country against a rebellion of the slaveholders which was sure to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteers was published on the morning of April 15th. By\r\nten o'clock the 6th Massachusetts began to rendezvous. In less than\r\nthirty-six hours the regiment was ready and off for Washington. They\r\nwere everywhere cheered with much enthusiasm. In New York they were\r\nguests of the Astor House, whose patriotic proprietor would receive no\r\ncompensation from the defenders of the flag.\r\n\r\nThe reception in Baltimore was of a very different sort. Some ruffians\r\nof that city had planned to assassinate Lincoln in February, and now\r\nthey in large numbers prepared to attack the soldiers who were\r\nhastening to the defense of the national capital. Here was the first\r\nbloodshed of the war. The casualties were four killed and thirty-six\r\nwounded. When the regiment reached Washington City, the march from the\r\nrailway station was very solemn. Behind the marching soldiers followed\r\nthe stretchers bearing the wounded. The dead had been left behind.\r\nGovernor Andrew's despatch to Mayor Brown,--\"Send them home\r\ntenderly,\"--elicited the sympathy of millions of hearts.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of Baltimore and the governor of Maryland sent a deputation\r\nto Lincoln to ask that no more troops be brought through that city. The\r\nPresident made no promise, but he said he was anxious to avoid all\r\nfriction and he would do the best he could. He added playfully that if\r\nhe granted that, they would be back next day to ask that no troops be\r\nsent around Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what occurred. The committee were back the next day\r\nprotesting against permitting any troops to cross the state of\r\nMaryland. Lincoln replied that, as they couldn't march around the\r\nstate, nor tunnel under it, nor fly over it, he guessed they would have\r\nto march across it.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that for the time being the troops should be brought to\r\nAnnapolis and transported thence to Washington by water. This was one\r\nof the many remarkable instances of forbearance on the part of the\r\ngovernment. There was a great clamor on the part of the North for\r\nvengeance upon Baltimore for its crime, and a demand for sterner\r\nmeasures in future. But the President was determined to show all the\r\nconciliation it was possible to show, both in this case and in a\r\nhundred others.\r\n\r\nThese actions bore good fruit. It secured to him the confidence of the\r\npeople to a degree that could not have been foreseen. On the 22d of\r\nJuly, 1861, Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky, offered the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved by the House of Representatives of the United States_,\r\nThat the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country\r\nby the disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms against the\r\nConstitutional Government and in arms around the capital:\r\n\r\n\"That in this national emergency, congress, banishing all feelings of\r\nmere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole\r\ncountry;\r\n\r\n\"That this war is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression,\r\nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of\r\noverthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions\r\nof those states, but to defend and maintain the _supremacy_ of the\r\nConstitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality,\r\nand rights of the several states unimpaired; and that, as soon as these\r\nobjects are accomplished, the war ought to cease.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was passed with only two dissenting votes. Lincoln's\r\npatience, forbearance, conciliation had accomplished this marvel.\r\n\r\nVery early in the war the question of slavery confronted the generals.\r\nIn the month of May, only about two months after the inauguration,\r\nGenerals Butler and McClellan confronted the subject, and their methods\r\nof dealing with it were as widely different as well could be. When\r\nButler was in charge of Fortress Monroe three negroes fled to that\r\nplace for refuge. They said that Colonel Mallory had set them to work\r\nupon the rebel fortifications. A flag of truce was sent in from the\r\nrebel lines demanding the return of the negroes. Butler replied: \"I\r\nshall retain the negroes as _contraband of war_. You were using\r\nthem upon your batteries; it is merely a question whether they shall be\r\nused for or against us.\" From that time the word _contraband_ was\r\nused in common speech to indicate an escaped slave.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 26th day of the same month that McClellan issued to the\r\nslaveholders a proclamation in which are found these words: \"Not only\r\nwill we abstain from all interference with your slaves, but we will, on\r\nthe contrary, with an iron hand crush any attempt at insurrection on\r\ntheir part.\" It is plain that McClellan's \"we\" did not include his\r\nbrother-general at Fortress Monroe. Further comment on his attitude is\r\nreserved to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe early victims of the war caused deep and profound sympathy. The\r\ncountry was not yet used to carnage. The expectancy of a people not\r\nexperienced in war was at high tension, and these deaths, which would\r\nat any time have produced a profound impression, were emphatically\r\nimpressive at that time.\r\n\r\nOne of the very first martyrs of the war was Elmer E. Ellsworth. He was\r\nyoung, handsome, impetuous. At Chicago he had organized among the\r\nfiremen a company of Zouaves with their spectacular dress and drill.\r\nThese Zouaves had been giving exhibition drills in many northern cities\r\nand aroused no little interest. One result was the formation of similar\r\ncompanies at various places. The fascinating Zouave drill became quite\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Ellsworth was employed in the office of Lincoln and Herndon in\r\nSpringfield. When the President-elect journeyed to Washington\r\nEllsworth, to whom Lincoln was deeply attached, made one of the party.\r\nAt the outbreak of hostilities he was commissioned as colonel to raise\r\na regiment in New York. On the south bank of the Potomac, directly\r\nopposite Washington, was Alexandria. The keeper of the Mansion House,\r\nin that place, had run up a secession flag on the mast at the top of\r\nthe hotel. This flag floated day after day in full sight of Lincoln and\r\nEllsworth and the others.\r\n\r\nEllsworth led an advance upon Alexandria on the evening of May 23d. The\r\nrebels escaped. The next morning as usual, the secession flag floated\r\ntauntingly from the Mansion House. Ellsworth's blood was up and he\r\nresolved to take down that flag and hoist the stars and stripes with\r\nhis own hand. Taking with him two soldiers he accomplished his purpose.\r\n\r\nReturning by a spiral stairway, he carried the rebel flag in his hand.\r\nThe proprietor of the hotel came out from a place of concealment,\r\nplaced his double-barreled shot-gun nearly against Ellsworth's body and\r\nfired. The assassin was instantly shot down by private Brownell, but\r\nEllsworth was dead. The rebel flag was dyed in the blood of his heart.\r\nUnderneath his uniform was found a gold medal with the inscription,\r\n_non solum nobus, sed pro patria_,--\"not for ourselves only but for our\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was removed to Washington City, where it lay in state in the\r\nEast room until burial. The President, amid all the cares of that busy\r\nperiod, found time to sit many hours beside the body of his friend, and\r\nat the burial he appeared as chief mourner.\r\n\r\nThis murder fired the northern imagination to a degree. The picture of\r\nEllsworth's handsome face was everywhere familiar. It is an easy guess\r\nthat hundreds, not to say thousands, of babies were named for him\r\nwithin the next few months, and to this day the name Elmer, starting\r\nfrom him, has not ceased to be a favorite.\r\n\r\nA little more than two weeks later, on the 10th of June, the first real\r\nbattle of the war was fought. This was at Big Bethel, Va., near\r\nFortress Monroe. The loss was not great as compared with later battles,\r\nbeing only eighteen killed and fifty-three wounded. But among the\r\nkilled was Major Theodore Winthrop, a young man barely thirty-three\r\nyears of age. He was the author of several successful books, and gave\r\npromise of a brilliant literary career. He was a true patriot and a\r\ngallant soldier. His death was the source of sorrow and anger to many\r\nthousands of readers of \"Cecil Dreeme.\"\r\n\r\nIt was two months later that General Lyon fell at Wilson's Creek, Mo.\r\nHe had been conspicuous for his services to the country before this\r\ntime. The battle was bitterly contested, and Lyon showed himself a\r\nveritable hero in personal courage and gallantry. After three wounds he\r\nwas still fighting on, leading personally a bayonet charge when he was\r\nshot for the fourth time, fell from his horse, and died immediately. It\r\nwas the gallant death of a brave soldier, that touches the heart and\r\nfires the imagination.\r\n\r\nThese deaths, and such as these, occurring at the beginning of the war,\r\ntaught the country the painful truth that the cost of war is deeper\r\nthan can possibly be reckoned. The dollars of money expended, and the\r\nlists of the numbers killed, wounded, and missing, do not fully express\r\nthe profound sorrow, the irreparable loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR HERE TO STAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln was a man of great sagacity. Few statesmen have had keener\r\ninsight, or more true and sane foresight. While cordially recognizing\r\nthis, it is not necessary to claim for him infallibility. He had his\r\ndisappointments.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the evacuation of Fort Sumter he issued his call for\r\n75,000 volunteers to serve for three months. We have seen that one\r\nreason why the number was so small was that this was the largest number\r\nthat could possibly be clothed, armed, and officered at short notice.\r\nSubsequent experience showed that the brief enlistment of three months\r\nwas an utterly inadequate period for so serious an insurrection. Did\r\nLincoln really think the rebellion could be put down in three months?\r\nWhy did he not save infinite trouble by calling for five-year\r\nenlistments at the beginning?\r\n\r\nFor one thing, he had at that time no legal power to call for a longer\r\nperiod of enlistment. Then he desired to continue the conciliatory\r\npolicy as long as possible, so as to avoid alienating the undecided in\r\nboth the North and the South. Had the first call been for 500,000 for\r\nthree years, it would have looked as if he intended and desired a long\r\nand bloody war, and this would have antagonized large numbers of\r\npersons. But it is probable that neither he nor the community at large\r\nsuspected the seriousness of the war. The wars in which the men then\r\nliving had had experience were very slight. In comparison with what\r\nfollowed, they were mere skirmishes. How should they foresee that they\r\nwere standing on the brink of one of the longest, the costliest, the\r\nbloodiest, and the most eventful wars of all history?\r\n\r\nVirginia was dragooned into secession. She declined to participate in\r\nthe Charleston Convention. Though a slave state, the public feeling was\r\nby a decided majority in favor of remaining in the Union. But after the\r\nfall of Sumter she was manipulated by skilful politicians, appealed to\r\nand cajoled on the side of prejudice and sectional feeling, and on\r\nApril 17th passed the ordinance of secession. It was a blunder and a\r\nmore costly blunder she could not have made. For four years her soil\r\nwas the theater of a bitterly contested war, and her beautiful valleys\r\nwere drenched with human blood.\r\n\r\nBack and forth, over and over again, fought the two armies, literally\r\nsweeping the face of the country with the besom of destruction. The\r\noldest of her soldiers of legal age were fifty-five years of age when\r\nthe war closed. The youngest were twelve years of age when the war\r\nopened. Older men and younger boys were in the war, ay, and were killed\r\non the field of battle. As the scourge of war passed over that state\r\nfrom south to north, from north to south, for four years, many an\r\nancient and proud family was simply exterminated, root and branch. Of\r\nsome of the noblest and best families, there is to-day not a trace and\r\nscarcely a memory.\r\n\r\nAll this could not have been foreseen by these Virginians, nor by the\r\npeople of the North, nor by the clear-eyed President himself. Even the\r\nmost cautious and conservative thought the war would be of brief\r\nduration. They were soon to receive a rude shock and learn that \"war\r\nis hell,\" and that _this_ war was here to stay. This revelation\r\ncame with the first great battle of the war, which was fought July 21,\r\n1861, at Bull Run, a location not more than twenty-five or thirty miles\r\nfrom Washington.\r\n\r\nCertain disabilities of our soldiers should be borne in mind. Most of\r\nthem were fresh from farm, factory, or store, and had no military\r\ntraining even in the militia. A large number were just reaching the\r\nexpiration of their term of enlistment and were homesick and eager to\r\nget out of the service. The generals were not accustomed to handling\r\nlarge bodies of men. To add to the difficulty, the officers and men\r\nwere entirely unacquainted with one another. Nevertheless most of them\r\nwere ambitious to see a little of real war before they went back to the\r\nindustries of peace. They saw far more than they desired.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed by the administration and its friends that one crushing\r\nblow would destroy the insurrection, and that this blow was to be dealt\r\nin this coming battle. The troops went to the front as to a picnic. The\r\npeople who thronged Washington, politicians, merchants, students,\r\nprofessional men, and ladies as well, had the same eagerness to see a\r\nbattle that in later days they have to witness a regatta or a game of\r\nfootball. The civilians, men and women, followed the army in large\r\nnumbers. They saw all they looked for and more.\r\n\r\nThe battle was carefully planned, and except for delay in getting\r\nstarted, it was fought out very much as planned. It is not the scope of\r\nthis book to enter into the details of this or any battle. But thus\r\nmuch may be said in a general way. The Confederates were all the day\r\nreceiving a steady stream of fresh reinforcements. The Federals, on the\r\nother hand, had been on their feet since two o'clock in the morning. By\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon, after eleven hours of activity and five\r\nhours of fighting in the heat of a July day in Virginia, these men were\r\ntired, thirsty, hungry,--worn out. Then came the disastrous panic and\r\nthe demoralization. A large portion of the army started in a race for\r\nWashington, the civilians in the lead.\r\n\r\nThe disaster was terrible, but there is nothing to gain by magnifying\r\nit. Some of the oldest and best armies in the world have been broken\r\ninto confusion quite as badly as this army of raw recruits. They did\r\nnot so far lose heart that they were not able to make a gallant stand\r\nat Centerville and successfully check the pursuit of the enemy. It was\r\nsaid that Washington was at the mercy of the Confederates, but it is\r\nmore likely that they had so felt the valor of the foe that they were\r\nunfit to pursue the retreating army. It was a hard battle on both\r\nsides. No one ever accused the Confederates of cowardice, and they\r\nsurely wanted to capture Washington City. That they did not do so is\r\nample proof that the battle was not a picnic to them. It had been\r\nboasted that one southern man could whip five northern men. This catchy\r\nphrase fell into disuse.\r\n\r\nIt was natural and politic for the Confederates to magnify their\r\nvictory. This was done without stint by Jeff Davis who was present as a\r\nspectator. He telegraphed the following:\r\n\r\n\"Night has closed upon a hard-fought field. Our forces were victorious.\r\nThe enemy was routed and fled precipitately, abandoning a large amount\r\nof arms, ammunition, knapsacks, and baggage. The ground was strewed for\r\nmiles with those killed, and the farmhouses and the ground around were\r\nfilled with wounded. Our force was fifteen thousand; that of the enemy\r\nestimated at thirty-five thousand.\"\r\n\r\nThat account is sufficiently accurate except as to figures. Jeff Davis\r\nnever could be trusted in such circumstances to give figures with any\r\napproach to accuracy. Lossing estimates that the Federal forces were\r\n13,000, and the Confederates about 27,000. This is certainly nearer the\r\ntruth than the boast of Jeff Davis. But a fact not less important than\r\nthe numbers was that the Confederate reinforcements were fresh, while\r\nthe Federal forces were nearly exhausted from marching half the night\r\nbefore the fighting began.\r\n\r\nAlthough the victorious forces were effectively checked at Centerville,\r\nthose who fled in absolute rout and uncontrollable panic were enough to\r\ngive the occasion a lasting place in history. The citizens who had gone\r\nto see the battle had not enjoyed their trip. The soldiers who had\r\nthought that this war was a sort of picnic had learned that the foe was\r\nformidable. The administration that had expected to crush the\r\ninsurrection by one decisive blow became vaguely conscious of the fact\r\nthat the war was here to stay months and years.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious trait of human nature that people are not willing to\r\naccept a defeat simply. The mind insists on explaining the particular\r\ncauses of that specific defeat. Amusing instances of this are seen in\r\nall games: foot-ball, regattas, oratorical contests. Also in elections;\r\nthe defeated have a dozen reasons to explain why the favorite candidate\r\nwas not elected as he should have been. This trait came out somewhat\r\nclamorously after the battle of Bull Run. A large number of plausible\r\nexplanations were urged on Mr. Lincoln, who finally brought the subject\r\nto a conclusion by the remark: \"I see. We whipped the enemy and then\r\nran away from him!\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the battle of Bull Run on the South was greatly to\r\nencourage them and add to their enthusiasm. The effect on the North was\r\nto deepen their determination to save the flag, to open their eyes to\r\nthe fact that the southern power was strong, and with renewed zeal and\r\ndetermination they girded themselves for the conflict. But the great\r\nburden fell on Lincoln. He was disappointed that the insurrection was\r\nnot and could not be crushed by one decisive blow. There was need of\r\nmore time, more men, more money, more blood. These thoughts and the\r\nrelative duties were to him, with his peculiar temperament, a severer\r\ntrial than they could have been to perhaps any other man living. He\r\nwould not shrink from doing his full duty, though it was so hard.\r\n\r\nIt made an old man of him. The night before he decided to send bread to\r\nSumter he slept not a wink. That was one of very many nights when he\r\ndid not sleep, and there were many mornings when he tasted no food. But\r\nweak, fasting, worn, aging as he was, he was always at his post of\r\nduty. The most casual observer could see the inroads which these mental\r\ncares made upon his giant body. It was about a year later than this\r\nthat an old neighbor and friend, Noah Brooks of Chicago, went to\r\nWashington to live, and he has vividly described the change in the\r\nappearance of the President.\r\n\r\nIn _Harper's Monthly_ for July, 1865, he writes: \"Though the\r\nintellectual man had greatly grown meantime, few persons would\r\nrecognize the hearty, blithesome, genial, and wiry Abraham Lincoln of\r\nearlier days in the sixteenth President of the United States, with his\r\nstooping figure, dull eyes, careworn face, and languid frame. The old\r\nclear laugh never came back; the even temper was sometimes disturbed;\r\nand his natural charity for all was often turned into unwonted\r\nsuspicion of the motives of men, whose selfishness caused him so much\r\nwear of mind.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the same writer said in _Scribner's Monthly_ for February, 1878:\r\n\"There was [in 1862] over his face an expression of sadness, and a\r\nfaraway look in the eyes, which were utterly unlike the Lincoln of\r\nother days.... I confess that I was so pained that I could almost have\r\nshed tears.... By and by, when I knew him better, his face was often\r\nfull of mirth and enjoyment; and even when he was pensive or gloomy,\r\nhis features were lighted up very much as a clouded alabaster vase\r\nmight be softly illuminated by a light within.\"\r\n\r\nHe still used his epigram and was still reminded of \"a little story,\"\r\nwhen he wished to point a moral or adorn a tale. But they were\r\nsuperficial indeed who thought they saw in him only, or chiefly, the\r\njester. Once when he was reproved for reading from a humorous book he\r\nsaid with passionate earnestness that the humor was his safety valve.\r\nIf it were not for the relief he would die. It was true. But he lived\r\non, not because he wanted to live, for he would rather have died. But\r\nit was God's will, and his country needed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DARKEST HOUR OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were so many dark hours in that war, and those hours were so\r\ndark, that it is difficult to specify one as the darkest hour. Perhaps\r\na dozen observers would mention a dozen different times. But Lincoln\r\nhimself spoke of the complication known as the Trent affair as the\r\ndarkest hour. From his standpoint it was surely so. It was so because\r\nhe felt the ground of public confidence slipping out from under him as\r\nat no other time. The majority of the North were with him in sentiment\r\nfor the most part. A goodly number were with him all the time,--except\r\nthis. This time, Charles Sumner, the Chairman of the Senate Committee\r\non Foreign Relations, was in agreement with him, but beyond that,\r\neverybody was against him, North and South, and all Europe as well.\r\nUpon him fell the task of turning the very turbulent current of public\r\nsentiment into the channel of duty and wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the affair were simple. Two men, Mason and Slidell, both\r\nex-senators of the United States, had started, with their secretaries\r\nand families, to England and France as emissaries of the Confederate\r\ngovernment. These countries had already recognized the Confederates as\r\nbelligerents, and the mission of these men was to secure the\r\nrecognition of the Confederate government as a nation. They succeeded\r\nin running the blockade at Charleston and put in at Havana. There they\r\nwere received with much ostentation. They took passage on the British\r\nmail steamer _Trent_ to St. Thomas, intending to take the packet thence\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wilkes, commanding a war vessel of the United States, was in\r\nthe neighborhood and learned of these proceedings and plans. He stopped\r\nthe British vessel on the high seas and by force took the two men and\r\ntheir secretaries. They were confined in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor.\r\n\r\nThis capture set the entire North ablaze with enthusiasm. Seward was in\r\nfavor of it. Stanton, who a few weeks later was appointed Secretary of\r\nWar, applauded the act. Welles, Secretary of the Navy, wrote a\r\ncongratulatory letter upon the \"great public service.\" The people of\r\nBoston tendered a banquet to the hero of the hour. When congress\r\nassembled about a month later, it gave him a vote of thanks. This wave\r\nof public enthusiasm swept the country from ocean to ocean. The\r\nsouthern sympathies of England and France had been so pronounced that\r\nthis whole country seemed to unite in hilarious triumph over this\r\ncapture, and regarded it as a slap in the face to England's pride. The\r\nfact that the complications threatened war with that nation only added\r\nfuel to the flames.\r\n\r\nThe excitement ran highest among the soldiers. Camp life had become\r\nmonotonous, no decisive victories had raised their courage and\r\nenthusiasm. They were tired. They were exasperated with England's\r\npolicy. They wanted to fight England.\r\n\r\nThe feeling upon the other side of the question ran equally high in the\r\nSouth, in England, and in France. As soon as the matter could receive\r\nofficial attention, the British minister at Washington was instructed\r\nto demand the instant release of the four men with a suitable apology.\r\nHe was to wait seven days for an answer, and if the demand was not met\r\nby that time, he was to break off diplomatic relations with the United\r\nStates. This of course meant war.\r\n\r\nSumner seems to have been the only other one who said, \"We shall have\r\nto give them up.\" Lincoln, when he heard of the capture, declared that\r\nthey would prove to be white elephants on our hands. \"We shall have to\r\ngive them up,\" he too said. But the difficulty was to lead the excited\r\nnation to see the need of this as he saw it. He declared that \"we\r\nfought Great Britain for doing just what Captain Wilkes has done. If\r\nGreat Britain protests against this act and demands their release, we\r\nmust adhere to our principles of 1812. We must give up these prisoners.\r\nBesides, one war at a time.\" He again said that it was \"the bitterest\r\npill he ever swallowed. But England's triumph will not last long. After\r\nthis war is over we shall call her to account for the damage she has\r\ndone us in our hour of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy of the government with regard to this matter was not settled\r\nin the cabinet meeting until the day after Christmas. Public enthusiasm\r\nby that time had had six weeks in which to cool down. In that time the\r\nsober second judgment had illuminated many minds, and the general\r\npublic was ready to see and hear reason. The outline of the reply of\r\nthe United States was directed by Lincoln, but he instructed Seward to\r\nchoose his own method of arguing the case. The reply was set forth in a\r\nvery able and convincing paper. It reaffirmed our adhesion to the\r\ndoctrine of 1812, said that Captain Wilkes had not done in an orderly\r\nway that which he did, promised that the prisoners would be cheerfully\r\nset at liberty, but declined to make any apology.\r\n\r\nAt this late date we are able to look somewhat behind the scenes, and\r\nwe now know that the Queen and the Prince consort were very deeply\r\nconcerned over the possibility of a war with us. They had only the\r\nkindest feelings for us, and just then they felt especially grateful\r\nfor the many courtesies which had been shown to the Prince of Wales\r\nupon his recent visit to this country. They were glad to get through\r\nwith the incident peaceably and pleasantly.\r\n\r\nSeward's reply was accepted as fully satisfactory. The English\r\nconcurred, the Americans concurred, and the danger was over. There was\r\nthen something of a revulsion of feeling. The feeling between our\r\ngovernment and that of England was more cordial than before, and the\r\nsame is true of the feeling between the two peoples. The South and\r\ntheir sympathizers were bitterly disappointed. The wise management of\r\nour President had turned one of the greatest dangers into a most\r\nvaluable success. There was never again a likelihood that England would\r\nform an alliance with the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe result was most fortunate for us and unfortunate for the southern\r\nemissaries. They were no longer heroes, they were \"gentlemen of\r\neminence,\" but not public functionaries. They were like other\r\ntravelers, nothing more. They were not received at either court. They\r\ncould only \"linger around the back doors\" of the courts where they\r\nexpected to be received in triumph, and bear as best they could the\r\nstudied neglect with which they were treated. The affair, so ominous at\r\none time, became most useful in its practical results to our cause.\r\nLord Palmerston, the British premier, got the four prisoners, but\r\nLincoln won the game.\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient place to speak of the personal griefs of the\r\nPresident. From his earliest years on, he was wonderfully affected by\r\nthe presence of death. Very few people have had this peculiar feeling\r\nof heart-break with such overwhelming power. The death of his infant\r\nbrother in Kentucky, the death of his mother in Indiana, impressed him\r\nand clouded his mind in a degree entirely unusual. We have seen that in\r\nSpringfield the death of Ann Rutledge well-nigh unseated his reason.\r\nFrom these he never recovered.\r\n\r\nThe horror of war was that it meant death, death, death! He, whose\r\nheart was tender to a fault, was literally surrounded by death. The\r\nfirst victim of the war, Colonel Ellsworth, was a personal friend, and\r\nhis murder was a personal affliction. There were others that came near\r\nto him. Colonel E. D. Baker, an old friend and neighbor of Lincoln, the\r\nman who had introduced him at his inaugural, was killed at Ball's Bluff\r\nOct. 21, 1861. Baker's personal courage made him conspicuous and marked\r\nhim out as a special target for the enemy's aim. While gallantly\r\nleading a charge, he fell, pierced almost simultaneously by four\r\nbullets. It fell upon Lincoln like the death of a brother. He was\r\nconsumed with grief.\r\n\r\nThe following February his two boys, Willie and Tad, were taken ill.\r\nLincoln's fondness for children was well known. This general love of\r\nchildren was a passion in regard to his own sons. In this sickness he\r\nnot only shared the duties of night-watching with the nurse, but at\r\nfrequent intervals he would slip away from callers, and even from\r\ncabinet meetings, to visit briefly the little sufferers. Willie died on\r\nFebruary 20th, and for several days before his death he was delirious.\r\nHis father was with him almost constantly.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few instances when he could be said to neglect\r\npublic business. For a few days before, and for a longer period after,\r\nWillie's death, he was completely dejected. Though he was a devout\r\nChristian, in spirit and temper, his ideas of personal immortality were\r\nnot at that time sufficiently clear to give him the sustaining help\r\nwhich he needed under his affliction.\r\n\r\nJ. G. Holland records a pathetic scene. This was communicated to him by\r\na lady whose name is not given. She had gone to Washington to persuade\r\nthe President to have hospitals for our soldiers located in the North.\r\nHe was skeptical of the plan and was slow to approve it. His hesitation\r\nwas the occasion of much anxiety to her. When he finally granted the\r\npetition, she thanked him with great earnestness and said she was sure\r\nhe would be happy that he had done it. He sat with his face in his\r\nhands and groaned: \"Happy? I shall never be happy again!\"\r\n\r\nBelow all his play of wit and humor, there was an undercurrent of\r\nagony. So great were his kindness, gentleness, tenderness of heart,\r\nthat he could not live in this cruel world, especially in the period\r\nwhen the times were so much out of joint, without being a man of\r\nsorrows. The present writer never saw Lincoln's face but twice, once in\r\nlife and once in death. Both times it seemed to him, and as he\r\nremembers it after the lapse of more than a third of a century, it\r\nstill seems to him, the saddest face his eyes have ever looked upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND FREMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a community like that of the United States, where free press and\r\nfree, speech prevail, where every native-born boy is a possible\r\nPresident, some undesirable results are inevitable. The successful men\r\nbecome egotistic, and it is a common, well-nigh universal, practise for\r\nall sorts and conditions of men to speak harshly of the authorities. In\r\nthe loafers on the street corners, in the illiterate that use the\r\ncountry store as their club, in the very halls of congress, are heard\r\nthe most unsparing criticisms and denunciations of the administration.\r\nThese unwarranted comments fell thick and fast on Lincoln, because he\r\nwas at the post of responsibility in a critical period, a time of\r\ngeneral unrest. Self-appointed committees of business men, politicians,\r\nclergymen, editors, and what not, were continually telling him what to\r\ndo and how to do it. Not a few of even the generals caught the\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible nor desirable to tell of Lincoln's relations with\r\nmany of the eminent men with whom he dealt. But a few will be selected\r\n--Fremont, McClellan, Greeley, and Grant--in order to explain some of\r\nthe difficulties which were continually rising up before him, and by\r\nshowing how he dealt with them to illustrate certain phases of his\r\ncharacter. This chapter will treat of Fremont.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war he was the most conspicuous military man in\r\nthe North. He had earned the gratitude of the country for distinguished\r\nservices in California, and he was deservedly popular among the\r\nrepublicans for his leadership of the party in 1856. He was at the best\r\nperiod of life, being forty-eight years of age. His abilities were\r\nmarked, and he possessed in an unusual degree the soldierly quality of\r\ninspiring enthusiasm. If he could turn all his powers into the channel\r\nof military efficiency, he would be the man of the age. He had the\r\npublic confidence, and he had such an opportunity as comes to few men.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the war he was in Paris and was at once summoned\r\nhome. He arrived in this country about the first of July and was by the\r\nPresident appointed Major-General in the regular army. On the 3d of\r\nJuly he was assigned to the Western department with headquarters at St.\r\nLouis. This department included the state of Illinois and extended as\r\nfar west as the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAt that time the condition of affairs in Missouri was distressful and\r\nextremely threatening. The state of Missouri covers a very large\r\nterritory, 69,415 square miles, and it was imperfectly provided with\r\nrailroads and other means of communication. Private bands of marauders\r\nand plunderers were numerous and did a great amount of damage among\r\nlaw-abiding citizens. There were also several insurgent armies of no\r\nmean dimensions threatening the state from the southwest. There were\r\ngood soldiers and officers there in defense of the Union, but they were\r\nuntried, insufficiently armed and accoutered, unprovided with means of\r\ntransportation, and, above all, they were in need of a commanding\r\ngeneral of sagacity, daring, and personal resources. Fremont seemed to\r\nbe just the man for the important post at that critical hour.\r\n\r\nGenerals Lyon, Hunter, and others, were sore pressed in Missouri. They\r\nneeded the presence of their commander and they needed him at once.\r\nFremont was ordered to proceed to his post immediately. This order he\r\ndid not obey. He could never brook authority, and he was not in the\r\nhabit of rendering good reasons for his acts of disobedience. Though he\r\nwas aware that the need of his presence was urgent, he dallied about\r\nWashington a long time and then proceeded west with leisure, arriving\r\nin St. Louis nearly three weeks later than he should have done. These\r\nthree weeks were under the circumstances time enough for an\r\nincalculable amount of damage, enough to make all the difference\r\nbetween success and failure. It was long enough to insure the death (on\r\nAugust 10th) of that brave soldier, General Lyon, and long enough to\r\naccount for many other disasters.\r\n\r\nOne of the most annoying things with which the subordinate generals had\r\nto contend, was that about this time the term of service of the men who\r\nhad enlisted for three months was beginning to expire. Many of these\r\nreenlisted, and many did not. It was not possible to plan an expedition\r\nof any sort when it was probable that a large portion of the command\r\nwould be out of service before it was completed. There was need of a\r\nmaster hand at organizing and inspiring loyalty.\r\n\r\nThough Fremont had so unaccountably delayed, yet when he came he was\r\nreceived with confidence and enthusiasm. Lincoln gave to him, as he did\r\nto all his generals, very nearly a _carte blanche_. His instructions\r\nwere general, and the commander was left to work out the details in\r\nhis own way. All that he required was that something should be done\r\nsuccessfully in the prosecution of the war. The country was not a\r\njudge of military plans; it was a judge of military success and\r\nfailure. They expected, and they had a right to expect, that Fremont\r\nshould do something more than keep up a dress parade. Lincoln laid on\r\nhim this responsibility in perfect confidence.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Fremont accomplished in Missouri was to quarrel with\r\nhis best friends, the Blair family. This is important chiefly as a\r\nthermometer,--it indicated his inability to hold the confidence of\r\nintelligent and influential men after he had it. About this time\r\nLincoln wrote to General Hunter a personal letter which showed well how\r\nthings were likely to go:--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir: General Fremont needs assistance which it is difficult to\r\ngive him. He is losing the confidence of men near him, whose support\r\nany man in his position must have to be successful. His cardinal\r\nmistake is that he isolates himself and allows no one to see him; and\r\nby which he does not know what is going on in the very matter he is\r\ndealing with. He needs to have by his side a man of large experience.\r\nWill you not, for me, take that place?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Louis XV. who exclaimed, \"_L'etat? C'est moi!_\" \"The state?\r\n_I'm_ the state!\" The next move of Fremont can be compared only with\r\nthat spirit of the French emperor. It was no less than a proclamation\r\nof emancipation. This was a civic act, while Fremont was an officer of\r\nmilitary, not civil, authority. The act was unauthorized, the President\r\nwas not even consulted. Even had it been a wise move, Fremont would\r\nhave been without justification because it was entirely outside of his\r\nprerogatives. Even had he been the wisest man, he was not an autocrat\r\nand could not have thus transcended his powers.\r\n\r\nBut this act was calculated to do much mischief. The duty of the hour\r\nwas to save the Union. Fremont's part in that duty was to drive the\r\nrebels out of Missouri. Missouri was a slave state. It had not seceded,\r\nand it was important that it should not do so. The same was true of\r\nKentucky and Maryland. It is easy to see, upon reading Fremont's\r\nproclamation, that it is the work not of a soldier, but of a\r\npolitician, and a bungling politician at that.\r\n\r\nWhen this came to the knowledge of the President he took prompt\r\nmeasures to counteract it in a way that would accomplish the greatest\r\ngood with the least harm. He wrote to the general:\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion,\r\nmodify that paragraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections\r\nof the act of congress entitled, 'An act to confiscate property used\r\nfor insurrectionary purposes,' approved August 6, 1861, and a copy of\r\nwhich act I herewith send you. This letter is written in a spirit of\r\ncaution, and not of censure.\"\r\n\r\nBut Fremont was willing to override both President and congress, and\r\ndeclined to make the necessary modifications. This placed him, with\r\nsuch influence as he had, in direct antagonism to the administration.\r\nThat which ought to have been done by Fremont had to be done by\r\nLincoln, upon whom was thrown the onus of whatever was objectionable in\r\nthe matter. It did give him trouble. It alienated many of the extreme\r\nabolitionists, including even his old neighbor and friend, Oscar H.\r\nBrowning. They seemed to think that Lincoln was now championing\r\nslavery. His enemies needed no alienation, but they made adroit use of\r\nthis to stir up and increase discontent.\r\n\r\nSo matters grew no better with Fremont, but much worse for three\r\nmonths. The words of Nicolay and Hay are none too strong: \"He had\r\nfrittered away his opportunity for usefulness and fame; such an\r\nopportunity, indeed, as rarely comes.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 21st, the President sent by special messenger the following\r\nletter to General Curtis at St. Louis:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR: On receipt of this, with the accompanying enclosures, you\r\nwill take safe, certain, and suitable measures to have the inclosure\r\naddressed to Major-General Fremont delivered to him with all reasonable\r\ndespatch, subject to these conditions only, that if, when General\r\nFremont shall be reached by the messenger,--yourself or any one sent by\r\nyou,--he shall then have, in personal command, fought and won a battle,\r\nor shall then be in the immediate presence of the enemy in expectation\r\nof a battle, it is not to be delivered but held for further orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe inclosure mentioned was an order relieving General Fremont and\r\nplacing Hunter temporarily in command. It is plain that the President\r\nexpected that there would be difficulties, in the way of delivering the\r\norder,--that Fremont himself might prevent its delivery. General\r\nCurtis, who undertook its delivery, evidently expected the same thing,\r\nfor he employed three different messengers who took three separate\r\nmethods of trying to reach Fremont. The one who succeeded in delivering\r\nthe order did so only because of his successful disguise, and when it\r\nwas accomplished Fremont's words and manner showed that he had expected\r\nto head off any such order. This incident reveals the peril which would\r\nhave fallen to American institutions had he been more successful in his\r\naspirations to the presidency.\r\n\r\nFremont had one more chance. He was placed in command of a corps in\r\nVirginia. There he disobeyed orders in a most atrocious manner, and by\r\nso doing permitted Jackson and his army to escape. He was superseded by\r\nPope, but declining to serve under a junior officer, resigned. And that\r\nwas the end of Fremont as a public man. The fact that he had ceased to\r\nbe a force in American life was emphasized in 1864. The extreme\r\nabolitionists nominated him as candidate for the presidency in\r\nopposition to Lincoln. But his following was so slight that he withdrew\r\nfrom the race and retired permanently to private life.\r\n\r\nYet he was a man of splendid abilities of a certain sort. Had he\r\npractised guerilla warfare, had he had absolute and irresponsible\r\ncommand of a small body of picked men with freedom to raid or do\r\nanything else he pleased, he would have been indeed formidable. The\r\nterror which the rebel guerilla General, Morgan, spread over wide\r\nterritory would easily have been surpassed by Fremont. But guerilla\r\nwarfare was not permissible on the side of the government. The aim of\r\nthe Confederates was destruction; the aim of the administration was\r\nconstruction. It is always easier and more spectacular to destroy than\r\nto construct.\r\n\r\nOne trouble with Fremont was his narrowness of view. He could not work\r\nwith others. If he wanted a thing in his particular department, it did\r\nnot concern him that it might injure the cause as a whole. Another\r\ntrouble was his conceit. He wanted to be \"the whole thing,\" President,\r\ncongress, general, and judiciary. Had Lincoln not possessed the\r\npatience of Job, he could not have borne with him even so long. The\r\nkindness of the President's letter, above quoted, is eloquent testimony\r\nto his magnanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND MCCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcClellan was a very different man from Fremont. Though he was as\r\nnearly as possible opposite in his characteristics, still it was not\r\neasier to get along with him. He was a man of brilliant talents, fine\r\nculture, and charming personality. Graduating from West Point in 1846,\r\nhe went almost immediately into the Mexican War, where he earned his\r\ncaptaincy. He later wrote a manual of arms for use in the United States\r\narmy. He visited Europe as a member of the commission of officers to\r\ngather military information.\r\n\r\nHis greatest genius was in engineering, a line in which he had no\r\nsuperior. He went to Illinois in 1857 as chief engineer of the Central\r\nRailroad, the following year he became vice-president, and the year\r\nafter that president of the St. Louis and Cincinnati Railway. At the\r\noutbreak of the war this captain was by the governor of Ohio\r\ncommissioned as major-general, and a few days later he received from\r\nLincoln the commission of major-general in the United States army.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to West Virginia with orders to drive out the rebels. This\r\nhe achieved in a brief time, and for it he received the thanks of\r\ncongress. He was, after the disaster at Bull Run, called to Washington\r\nand placed in command of that portion of the Army of the Potomac whose\r\nspecific duty was the defense of the capital. He was rapidly promoted\r\nfrom one position to another until age and infirmity compelled the\r\nretirement of that grand old warrior, Winfield Scott, whereupon he was\r\nmade general-in-chief of the United States army. All this occurred in\r\nless than four months. Four months ago, this young man of thirty-five\r\nyears was an ex-captain. To-day he is general-in-chief, not of the\r\nlargest army, but probably of the most intelligent army, the world has\r\never seen. He would be almost more than human if such a sudden turn of\r\nthe wheel of fortune did not also turn his head.\r\n\r\nIt was Lincoln's habit to let his generals do their work in their own\r\nways, only insisting that they should accomplish visible and tangible\r\nresults. This method he followed with McClellan, developing it with\r\ngreat patience under trying circumstances. On this point there is no\r\nbetter witness than McClellan himself. To his wife he wrote, \"They give\r\nme my way in everything, full swing and unbounded confidence.\" Later he\r\nexpressed contempt for the President who \"showed him too much\r\ndeference.\" He was a universal favorite, he became known as \"the young\r\nNapoleon,\" he had the confidence of the country and the loyal devotion\r\nof the army, and the unqualified support of the administration. Of him\r\ngreat things were expected, and reasonably so. In the power of\r\ninspiring confidence and enthusiasm he was second only to Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAs an organizer and drill-master he was superb. The army after Bull Run\r\nwas as demoralized as an army could be. The recruits soon began to\r\narrive from the North, every day bringing thousands of such into\r\nWashington. These required care and they must be put into shape for\r\neffective service. This difficult task he accomplished in a way that\r\nfully met the public expectation and reflected great credit upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn defense he was a terrible fighter. That is to say, when he fought at\r\nall--for he fought only in defense--he fought well. A distinguished\r\nConfederate soldier said, \"There was no Union general whom we so much\r\ndreaded as McClellan. He had, as we thought, no equal.\" And they\r\ndeclared they could always tell when McClellan was in command by the\r\nway the men fought.\r\n\r\nAn illustrious comment on this is the splendid fighting at Antietam.\r\nThat was one of the greatest battles and one of the most magnificent\r\nvictories of the war. It showed McClellan at his best.\r\n\r\nWe know what the Army of the Potomac was previous to the accession of\r\nMcClellan. Let us see what it was after his removal. \"McClellan was\r\nretired,\" says the Honorable Hugh McCulloch, \"and what happened to the\r\nArmy of the Potomac? Terrible slaughter under Burnside at\r\nFredericksburg; crushing defeat at Chancellorsville under Hooker.\" All\r\nthis shows that McClellan narrowly missed the fame of being one of the\r\ngreatest generals in history. But let us glance at another page in the\r\nledger.\r\n\r\nHis first act, when in command at Cincinnati, was to enter into an\r\nagreement with General Buckner that the state of Kentucky should be\r\ntreated as neutral territory. That agreement put that state into the\r\nposition of a foreign country, like England or China, when the very\r\npurpose of the war was to insist that the United States was one nation.\r\nThis act was a usurpation of authority, and further, it was\r\ndiametrically wrong even had he possessed the authority.\r\n\r\nHis next notable act, one which has already been mentioned, was to\r\nissue a proclamation in defense of slavery, promising to assist [the\r\nrebels] to put down any attempt at insurrection by the slaves. This was\r\nwrong. His duty was to conquer the enemy. It was no more his duty to\r\ndefend slavery than it was Fremont's to emancipate the slaves.\r\n\r\nThe next development of McClellan was the hallucination, from which he\r\nnever freed himself, that the enemy's numbers were from five to ten\r\ntimes as great as they really were. \"I am here,\" he wrote August 16,\r\n1861, \"in a terrible place; the enemy have from three to four times my\r\nforce. The President, the old general, cannot or will not see the true\r\nstate of affairs.\" At that time the \"true state of affairs\" was that\r\nthe enemy had from one-third to one-half his force. That is a fair\r\nspecimen of the exaggeration of his fears. That is, McClellan's\r\nestimate was from six to twelve times too much.\r\n\r\nAt Yorktown he faced the Confederate Magruder, who commanded 11,000 all\r\ntold. Of this number, 6,000 were spread along a line of thirteen miles\r\nof defense across the peninsula, leaving 5,000 for battle. McClellan's\r\nimagination, or fears, magnified this into an enormous army. With his\r\n58,000 effective troops he industriously prepared for defense, and when\r\nthe engineering work was accomplished thought he had done a great act\r\nin defending his army. All the while he was calling lustily for\r\nreinforcements from Washington. When Magruder was ready he retired with\r\nhis little army and McClellan's opportunity was gone.\r\n\r\nAt Antietam he won a brilliant victory, but he failed to follow it up.\r\nThere was a chance to annihilate the Confederate army and end the war.\r\nTo do that was nearly as important as it had been to win the victory.\r\nTo be sure his troops were worn, but as compared with the shattered\r\ncondition of the enemy, his army was ready for dress parade. So the\r\nenemy was allowed to cross the Potomac at leisure, reform, reorganize,\r\nand the war was needlessly prolonged. It was this neglect which, more\r\nthan any other one thing, undermined the general confidence in\r\nMcClellan.\r\n\r\nLater, at second Bull Run he left Pope to suffer. It was clearly his\r\nduty to reinforce Pope, but he only said that Pope had got himself into\r\nthe fix and he must get out as he could. He seemed to forget that there\r\nnever was a time when he was not calling for reinforcements himself.\r\nThis wanton neglect was unsoldierly, inhuman. He also forgot that this\r\nmethod of punishing Pope inflicted severe punishment on the nation.\r\n\r\nHis chronic call for reinforcements, were it not so serious, would make\r\nthe motive of a comic opera. When he was in Washington, he wanted all\r\nthe troops called in for the defense of the city. When he was in\r\nVirginia, he thought the troops which were left for the defense of the\r\ncity ought to be sent to reinforce him,--the city was safe enough! He\r\ntelegraphed to Governor Denison of Ohio to pay no attention to\r\nRosecrans' request for troops. He thought that 20,000, with what could\r\nbe raised in Kentucky and Tennessee, was enough for the Mississippi\r\nValley, while he needed 273,000. When he was insisting that Washington\r\nshould be stripped in order to furnish him with 50,000 additional men,\r\nthe President asked what had become of his more than 160,000; and in\r\nhis detailed reply he gave the item of 38,500 absent on leave. Here was\r\nnearly the number of 50,000 which he asked for, if he would only call\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\nIncidentally to all this were persistent discourtesies to the\r\nPresident. He would sit silent in the cabinet meetings pretending to\r\nhave secrets of great importance. Instead of calling on the President\r\nto report, he made it necessary for the President to call on him. At\r\nother times he would keep the President waiting while he affected to be\r\nbusy with subordinates. Once indeed he left the President waiting while\r\nhe went to bed. All this Lincoln bore with his accustomed patience. He\r\nplayfully said, when remonstrated with, that he would gladly hold\r\nMcClellan's horse if he would only win the battles. This he failed to\r\ndo. And when he was finally relieved, he had worn out the patience not\r\nonly of the President, but of his army, and of the entire country. One\r\nwriter of the day said with much bitterness, but with substantial\r\ntruth, that \"McClellan, with greater means at his command than\r\nAlexander, Caesar, Napoleon, or Wellington, has lost more men and means\r\nin his disasters than they in their victories.\"\r\n\r\nWhat were the defects of this remarkable man? In the first place, he\r\nbelieved in slavery. At this late day it is difficult to realize the\r\ndevotion which some men had for slavery as a \"divine institution,\"\r\nbefore which they could kneel down and pray, as if it was the very ark\r\nof God. McClellan was one such. And it is not improbable that he early\r\nhad more than a suspicion that slavery was the real cause of all the\r\ntrouble. This would in part account for his hesitation.\r\n\r\nThen there was a bitter personal hatred between him and Stanton. This\r\nled him to resent all suggestions and orders emanating from the War\r\nDepartment. It also made him suspicious of Stanton's associates,\r\nincluding the President.\r\n\r\nThen he seemed to lack the nerve for a pitched battle. He could do\r\neverything up to the point of action, but he could not act. This lack\r\nof nerve is a more common fact in men in all walks of life than is\r\nusually recognized. He was unconquerable in defense, he did not know\r\nthe word _aggressive_. Had he possessed some of the nerve of Sheridan,\r\nHooker, Sherman, or any one of a hundred others, he would have been one\r\nof the four great generals of history. But he could not be persuaded or\r\nforced to attack. His men might die of fever, but not in battle. So far\r\nas he was concerned, the Army of the Potomac might have been\r\nreorganizing, changing its base, and perfecting its defenses against\r\nthe enemy, to this day.\r\n\r\nA fatal defect was the endeavor to combine the military and the\r\npolitical. Few men have succeeded in this. There were Alexander,\r\nCaesar, Napoleon,--but all came to an untimely end; the first met an\r\nearly death in a foreign land, the second was assassinated, the third\r\ndied a prisoner in exile. McClellan and Fremont, with all their\r\nsplendid talents, made the fatal mistake. They forgot that for the time\r\nthey were only military men. Grant was not a politician until after his\r\nmilitary duties were ended.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the relations between Lincoln and McClellan was not\r\ngenerally known until recently made public by Lincoln's intimate friend\r\nLamon. McClellan was nominated in 1864 for President by the democrats.\r\nAs election day approached it became increasingly clear that McClellan\r\nhad no chance whatever of being elected. But Lincoln wanted something\r\nmore than, and different from, a reelection. His desires were for the\r\nwelfare of the distracted country. He wanted peace, reconstruction,\r\nprosperity. A few days before election he sent a remarkable proposition\r\nthrough a common friend, Francis P. Blair, to McClellan. Mr. Blair was\r\nin hearty sympathy with the plan.\r\n\r\nThis proposition set forth the hopelessness of McClellan's chances for\r\nthe presidency, which he knew perfectly well. It was then suggested\r\nthat McClellan withdraw from the contest and let the President be\r\nchosen by a united North, which would bring the war to a speedy close\r\nand stop the slaughter of men on both sides. The compensations for this\r\nconcession were to be: McClellan was to be promoted immediately to be\r\nGeneral of the Army, his father-in-law Marcy was to be appointed major-\r\ngeneral, and a suitable recognition of the democratic party would be\r\nmade in other appointments.\r\n\r\nAt first blush McClellan was in favor of the arrangement. It is\r\nprobable that if left to himself he would have acceded. The imagination\r\ncan hardly grasp the fame that would have come to \"little Mac,\" and the\r\nblessings that would have come to the reunited country, had this wise\r\nplan of Lincoln been accepted. But McClellan consulted with friends who\r\nadvised against it. The matter was dropped,--and that was the end of\r\nthe history of McClellan. He had thrown away his last chance of success\r\nand fame. All that followed may be written in one brief sentence: On\r\nelection day he resigned from the army and was overwhelmingly defeated\r\nat the polls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND GREELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the mischief of the world is the work of people who mean well.\r\nNot the least of the annoyances thrust on Lincoln came from people who\r\nought to have known better. The fact that such mischief-makers are\r\ncomplacent, as if they were doing what was brilliant, and useful, adds\r\nto the vexation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent citizens of the United States at the time of\r\nthe civil war was Horace Greeley. He was a man of ardent convictions,\r\nof unimpeachable honesty, and an editorial writer of the first rank. He\r\ndid a vast amount of good. He also did a vast amount of mischief which\r\nmay be considered to offset a part of the good he accomplished.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual ability made it impossible for him to be anywhere a\r\nnonentity. He was always prominent. His paper, the New York _Tribune_,\r\nwas in many respects the ablest newspaper of the day. Large numbers of\r\nintelligent republicans took the utterances of the _Tribune_ as gospel\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIt is not safe for any man to have an excess of influence. It is not\r\nsurprising that the wide influence which Greeley acquired made him\r\negotistic. He apparently came to believe that he had a mortgage on the\r\nrepublican party, and through that upon the country. His editorial\r\nbecame dictatorial. He looked upon Lincoln as a protege of his own who\r\nrequired direction. This he was willing to give,--mildly but firmly.\r\nAll this was true of many other good men and good republicans. But it\r\nwas emphatically true of Greeley.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything worse than a military man who plumes himself upon\r\nhis statesmanship, it is the civilian who affects to understand\r\nmilitary matters better than the generals, the war department, and the\r\ncommander-in-chief. This was Greeley. He placed his military policy in\r\nthe form of a war-cry,--\"On to Richmond!\"--at the head of his editorial\r\npage, and with a pen of marvelous power rung the changes on it.\r\n\r\nThis is but one sample of the man's proneness to interfere in other\r\nmatters. With all the infallibility of an editor he was ever ready to\r\ntell what the President ought to do as a sensible and patriotic man.\r\n_He_ would have saved the country by electing Douglas, by permitting\r\npeaceable secession, by persuading the French ambassador to intervene,\r\nby conference and argument with the Confederate emissaries, and by\r\nassuming personal control of the administration. At a later date he\r\nwent so far as to propose to force Lincoln's resignation. He did not\r\nseem to realize that Lincoln could be most effective if allowed to do\r\nhis work in his own way. He did not grasp the truth that he could be of\r\nthe highest value to the administration only as he helped and\r\nencouraged, and that his obstructions operated only to diminish the\r\nefficiency of the government. If Greeley had put the same degree of\r\nforce into encouraging the administration that he put into hindering\r\nits work, he would have merited the gratitude of his generation.\r\n\r\nHe was singularly lacking in the willingness to do this, or in the\r\nability to recognize its importance. Like hundreds of others he\r\npersisted in expounding the duties of the executive, but his\r\npatronizing advice was more harmful in proportion to the incisiveness\r\nof his literary ability. This impertinence of Greeley's criticism\r\nreached its climax in an open letter to Lincoln. This letter is, in\r\npart, quoted here. It shows something of the unspeakable annoyances\r\nthat were thrust upon the already overburdened President, from those\r\nwho ought to have delighted in holding up his hands, those of whom\r\nbetter things might have been expected. The reply shows the patience\r\nwith which Lincoln received these criticisms. It further shows the\r\nskill with which he could meet the famous editor on his own ground; for\r\nhe also could wield a trenchant pen.\r\n\r\nGreeley's letter is very long and it is not necessary to give it in\r\nfull. But the headings, which are given below, are quite sufficient to\r\nshow that the brilliant editor dipped his pen in gall in order that he\r\nmight add bitterness to the man whose life was already filled to the\r\nbrim with the bitter sorrows, trials, and disappointments of a\r\ndistracted nation. The letter is published on the editorial page of the\r\nNew York _Tribune_ of August 20, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"THE PRAYER OF TWENTY MILLIONS:\r\n\r\n\"To ABRAHAM LINCOLN, _President of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR: I do not intrude to tell you--for you must know already--\r\nthat a great proportion of those who triumphed in your election, and\r\nof all who desire the unqualified suppression of the Rebellion now\r\ndesolating our country, are sorely disappointed and deeply pained by\r\nthe policy you seem to be pursuing with regard to the slaves of the\r\nRebels. I write only to set succinctly and unmistakably before you\r\nwhat we require, what we think we have a right to expect, and of what\r\nwe complain.\r\n\r\n\"I. We require of you, as the first servant of the Republic, charged\r\nespecially and preeminently with this duty, that you EXECUTE THE\r\nLAWS....\"\r\n\r\n\"II. We think you are strangely and disastrously remiss in the\r\ndischarge of your official and imperative duty with regard to the\r\nemancipating provisions of the new Confiscation Act....\"\r\n\r\n\"III. We think you are unduly influenced by the counsels, the\r\nrepresentations, the menaces, of certain fossil politicians hailing\r\nfrom the Border States....\"\r\n\r\n\"IV. We think the timid counsels of such a crisis calculated to prove\r\nperilous and probably disastrous....\"\r\n\r\n\"V. We complain that the Union cause has suffered and is now suffering\r\nimmensely, from mistaken deference to Rebel Slavery. Had you, Sir, in\r\nyour Inaugural Address, unmistakably given notice that, in case the\r\nRebellion already commenced were persisted in, and your efforts to\r\npreserve the Union and enforce the laws should be resisted by armed\r\nforce, you _would recognize no loyal person as rightfully held in\r\nSlavery by a traitor_, we believe that the Rebellion would have\r\nreceived a staggering, if not fatal blow....\"\r\n\r\n\"VI. We complain that the Confiscation Act which you approved is\r\nhabitually disregarded by your Generals, and that no word of rebuke for\r\nthem from you has yet reached the public ear....\"\r\n\r\n\"VII. Let me call your attention to the recent tragedy in New Orleans,\r\nwhereof the facts are obtained entirely through Pro-Slavery\r\nchannels....\"\r\n\r\n\"VIII. On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one\r\ndisinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union Cause who\r\ndoes not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion and at the\r\nsame time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile--that\r\nthe Rebellion, if crushed out to-morrow, would be renewed within a year\r\nif Slavery were left in full vigor--that the army of officers who\r\nremain to this day devoted to Slavery can at best be but half way loyal\r\nto the Union--and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of\r\nadded and deepened peril to the Union....\"\r\n\r\n\"IX. I close as I began with the statement that what an immense\r\nmajority of the Loyal Millions of your countrymen require of you is a\r\nfrank, declared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the laws of the\r\nland, more especially of the Confiscation Act.... As one of the\r\nmillions who would gladly have avoided this struggle at any sacrifice\r\nbut that of Principle and Honor, but who now feel that the triumph of\r\nthe Union is indispensable not only to the existence of our country,\r\nbut to the well-being of mankind, I entreat you to render a hearty and\r\nunequivocal obedience to the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours,\"\r\n\r\n\"HORACE GREELEY.\"\r\n\r\n\"NEW YORK, August 19, 1862.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the eccentricities of this able editor will\r\nnot be slow to believe that, had Lincoln, previous to the writing of\r\nthat letter, done the very things he called for, Greeley would not\r\nimprobably, have been among the first to attack him with his caustic\r\ncriticism. Lincoln was not ignorant of this. But he seized this\r\nopportunity to address a far wider constituency than that represented\r\nin the subscription list of the _Tribune_. His reply was published\r\nin the Washington _Star_. He puts the matter so temperately and\r\nplainly that the most obtuse could not fail to see the reasonableness\r\nof it. As to Greeley, we do not hear from him again, and may assume\r\nthat he was silenced if not convinced. The reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 22, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"HON. HORACE GREBLEY,\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR: I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself\r\nthrough the New York _Tribune_. If there be in it any statements,\r\nor assumptions of fact, which I may know to be erroneous, I do not, now\r\nand here, controvert them. If there be in it any inferences which I may\r\nbelieve to be falsely drawn, I do not, now and here, argue against\r\nthem. If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone,\r\nI waive it in deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always\r\nsupposed to be right. As to the policy I 'seem to be pursuing,' as you\r\nsay, I have not meant to leave any one in doubt. I would save the\r\nUnion. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The\r\nsooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union\r\nwill be 'the Union as it was.' If there be those who would not save the\r\nUnion unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree\r\nwith them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they\r\ncould at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My\r\nparamount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not\r\neither to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without\r\nfreeing any slave, I would do it; if I could save it by freeing all the\r\nslaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and\r\nleaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and\r\nthe colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union:\r\nand what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to\r\nsave the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am\r\ndoing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe\r\ndoing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when\r\nshown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall\r\nappear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my\r\nview of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft expressed\r\npersonal wish that all men everywhere could be free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting fact connected with this subject is that at\r\nthis very time Lincoln had the Emancipation Proclamation in mind. But\r\nnot even the exasperating teasing that is fairly represented by\r\nGreeley's letter caused him to put forth that proclamation prematurely.\r\nIt is no slight mark of greatness that he was able under so great\r\npressure to bide his time.\r\n\r\nThis was not the last of Greeley's efforts to control the President or\r\nrun the machine. In 1864 he was earnestly opposed to his renomination\r\nbut finally submitted to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn July of that year, 1864, two prominent Confederates, Clay of\r\nAlabama, and Thompson of Mississippi, managed to use Greeley for their\r\npurposes. They communicated with him from Canada, professing to have\r\nauthority to arrange for terms of peace, and they asked for a safe-\r\nconduct to Washington. Greeley fell into the trap but Lincoln did not.\r\nThere is little doubt that their real scheme was to foment discontent\r\nand secure division throughout the North on the eve of the presidential\r\nelection. Lincoln wrote to Greeley as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If you can find any person, anywhere, professing to have authority\r\nfrom Jefferson Davis, in writing, embracing the restoration of the\r\nUnion and the abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to\r\nhim that he may come to me with you.\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of July 18, he wrote the following:\r\n\r\n\"_To whom it may concern:_\"\r\n\r\n\"Any proposition which embraces the restoration of peace, the integrity\r\nof the whole Union, and the abandonment of slavery, and which comes by\r\nand with an authority that can control the armies now at war with the\r\nUnited States, will be received and considered by the Executive\r\ngovernment of the United States, and will be met on liberal terms on\r\nsubstantial and collateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof\r\nshall have safe-conduct both ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nGreeley met these \"commissioners\" at Niagara, but it turned out that\r\nthey had no authority whatever from the Confederate government. The\r\nwhole affair was therefore a mere fiasco. But Greeley, who had been\r\ncompletely duped, was full of wrath, and persistently misrepresented,\r\nnot to say maligned, the President. According to Noah Brooks, the\r\nPresident said of the affair:\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's hardly fair to say that this won't amount to anything. It\r\nwill shut up Greeley, and satisfy the people who are clamoring for\r\npeace. That's something, anyhow.\" The President was too hopeful. It did\r\nnot accomplish quite that, for Greeley was very persistent; but it did\r\nprevent a serious division of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery was always and only hateful to the earnest\r\nand honest nature of Lincoln. He detested it with all the energy of his\r\nsoul. He would, as he said, gladly have swept it from the face of the\r\nearth. Not even the extreme abolitionists, Garrison, Wendell Phillips,\r\nWhittier, abominated slavery with more intensity than Lincoln. But he\r\ndid not show his hostility in the same way. He had a wider scope of\r\nvision than they. He had, and they had not, an appreciative historical\r\nknowledge of slavery in this country. He knew that it was tolerated by\r\nthe Constitution and laws enacted within the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, though he believed that the later expansion of slavery\r\nwas contrary to the spirit and intent of the men who framed the\r\nConstitution. And he believed that slaveholders had legal rights which\r\nshould be respected by all orderly citizens. His sympathy with the\r\nslave did not cripple his consideration for the slave-owner who had\r\ninherited his property in that form, and under a constitution and laws\r\nwhich he did not originate and for which he was not responsible.\r\n\r\nHe would destroy slavery root and branch, but he would do it in a\r\nmanner conformable to the Constitution, not in violation of it. He\r\nwould exterminate it, but he would not so do it as to impoverish law-\r\nabiding citizens whose property was in slaves. He would eliminate\r\nslavery, but not in a way to destroy the country, for that would entail\r\nmore mischief than benefit. To use a figure, he would throw Jonah\r\noverboard, but he would not upset the ship in the act.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of people have a limited scope of knowledge. Such\r\noverlooked the real benefits of our civilization, and did not realize\r\nthat wrecking the constitution would simply destroy the good that had\r\nthus far been achieved, and uproot the seeds of promise of usefulness\r\nfor the centuries to come. They wanted slavery destroyed at once,\r\nviolently, regardless of the disastrous consequences. On the other\r\nhand, Lincoln wanted it destroyed, but by a sure and rational process.\r\nHe wished--and from this he never swerved--to do also two things:\r\nfirst, to compensate the owners of the slaves, and second to provide\r\nfor the future of the slaves themselves. Of course, the extreme\r\nradicals could not realize that he was more intensely opposed to\r\nslavery than themselves.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at his record. We have already seen (in chapter V.)\r\nhow he revolted from the first view of the horrors of the institution,\r\nand the youthful vow which he there recorded will not readily be\r\nforgotten. That was in 1831 when he was twenty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nSix years later, or in 1837, when he was a youthful member of the\r\nIllinois legislature, he persuaded Stone to join him in a protest\r\nagainst slavery. There was positively nothing to be gained by this\r\nprotest, either personally or in behalf of the slave. The only possible\r\nreason for it was that he believed that slavery was wrong and could not\r\nrest until he had openly expressed that belief. \"A timely utterance\r\ngave that thought relief, And I again am strong.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was in congress, in 1846, the famous Wilmot Proviso came up.\r\nThis was to provide \"that, as an express and fundamental condition to\r\nthe acquisition of any territory from the republic of Mexico by the\r\nUnited States ... neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever\r\nexist in any part of the said territory.\" By reason of amendments, this\r\nsubject came before the house very many times, and Lincoln said\r\nafterwards that he had voted for the proviso in one form or another\r\nforty-two times.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of January, 1849, he introduced into congress a bill\r\nfor the emancipation of slavery in the District of Columbia. This was a\r\nwise and reasonable bill. It gave justice to all, and at the same time\r\ngathered all the fruits of emancipation in the best possible way. The\r\nbill did not pass, there was no hope at the time that it would pass.\r\nBut it compelled a reasonable discussion of the subject and had a\r\ncertain amount of educational influence.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that, thirteen years later, April 10, 1862, he had\r\nthe privilege of fixing his presidential signature to a bill similar to\r\nhis own. Congress had moved up to his position. When he signed the\r\nbill, he said: \"Little did I dream, in 1849, when I proposed to abolish\r\nslavery in this capital, and could scarcely get a hearing for the\r\nproposition, that it would be so soon accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of his term in congress he left political life, as\r\nhe supposed, forever. He went into the practise of the law in earnest,\r\nand was so engaged at the time of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\nwhich called him back to the arena of politics.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the war there were certain attempts at\r\nemancipation which Lincoln held in check for the reason that the time\r\nfor them had not arrived. \"There's a tide in the affairs of men.\" It is\r\nof prime importance that this tide be taken at the flood. So far as\r\nemancipation was concerned, this came in slower than the eagerness of\r\nGenerals Fremont and Hunter. But it was coming, and in the meantime\r\nLincoln was doing what he could to help matters on. The difficulty was\r\nthat if the Union was destroyed it would be the death-blow to the cause\r\nof emancipation. At the same time not a few loyal men were\r\nslaveholders. To alienate these by premature action would be\r\ndisastrous. The only wise plan of action was to wait patiently until a\r\nsufficient number of these could be depended on in the emergency of\r\nemancipation. This was what Lincoln was doing.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the year 1862 was very trying. The North had expected\r\nto march rapidly and triumphantly into Richmond. This had not been\r\naccomplished, but on the contrary disaster had followed disaster in\r\nbattle, and after many months the two armies were encamped facing each\r\nother and almost in sight of Washington, while the soldiers from the\r\nNorth were rapidly sickening and dying in the Southern camps. Small\r\nwonder if there was an impatient clamor.\r\n\r\nA serious result of this delay was the danger arising from European\r\nsources. The monarchies of Europe had no sympathy with American\r\nfreedom. They became impatient with the reports of \"no progress\" in the\r\nwar, and at this time some of them were watching for a pretext to\r\nrecognize the Southern Confederacy. This came vividly to the knowledge\r\nof Carl Schurz, minister to Spain. By permission of the President he\r\nreturned to this country--this was late in January, 1862--to lay the\r\nmatter personally before him. With the help of Schurz, Lincoln\r\nproceeded to develop the sentiment for emancipation. By his request\r\nSchurz went to New York to address a meeting of the Emancipation\r\nSociety on March 6th. It need not be said that the speaker delivered a\r\nmost able and eloquent plea upon \"Emancipation as a Peace Measure.\"\r\nLincoln also made a marked contribution to the meeting. He telegraphed\r\nto Schurz the text of his message to congress recommending emancipation\r\nin the District of Columbia,--which resulted in the law already\r\nmentioned,--and this message of Lincoln was read to the meeting. The\r\neffect of it, following the speech of Schurz, was overwhelming. It was\r\nquite enough to satisfy the most sanguine expectations. This was not a\r\ncoincidence, it was a plan. Lincoln's hand in _the whole matter_\r\nwas not seen nor suspected for many years after. It gave a marked\r\nimpetus to the sentiment of emancipation.\r\n\r\nTo the loyal slaveholders of the border states he made a proposal of\r\ncompensated emancipation. To his great disappointment they rejected\r\nthis. It was very foolish on their part, and he cautioned them that\r\nthey might find worse trouble.\r\n\r\nAll this time, while holding back the eager spirits of the\r\nabolitionists, he was preparing for his final stroke. But it was of\r\ncapital importance that this should not be premature. McClellan's\r\nfailure to take Richmond and his persistent delay, hastened the result.\r\nThe community at large became impatient beyond all bounds. There came\r\nabout a feeling that something radical must be done, and that quickly.\r\nBut it was still necessary that he should be patient. As the bravest\r\nfireman is the last to leave the burning structure, so the wise\r\nstatesman must hold himself in check until the success of so important\r\na measure is assured beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nAn event which occurred later may be narrated here because it\r\nillustrates the feeling which Lincoln always had in regard to slavery.\r\nThe item was written out by the President himself and given to the\r\nnewspapers for publication under the heading,\r\n\r\n\"THE PRESIDENT'S LAST, SHORTEST, AND BEST SPEECH.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Thursday of last week, two ladies from Tennessee came before the\r\nPresident, asking the release of their husbands, held as prisoners of\r\nwar at Johnson's Island. They were put off until Friday, when they came\r\nagain, and were again put off until Saturday. At each of the interviews\r\none of the ladies urged that her husband was a religious man. On\r\nSaturday, when the President ordered the release of the prisoners, he\r\nsaid to this lady: You say your husband is a religious man; tell him\r\nwhen you meet him that I say I am not much of a judge of religion, but\r\nthat, in my opinion, the religion that sets men to rebel and fight\r\nagainst their government because, as they think, that government does\r\nnot sufficiently help _some_ men to eat their bread in the sweat\r\nof _other_ men's faces, is not the sort of religion upon which\r\npeople can get to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nAs the dreadful summer of 1862 advanced, Lincoln noted surely that the\r\ntime was at hand when emancipation would be the master stroke. In\r\ndiscussing the possibilities of this measure he seemed to take the\r\nopposite side. This was a fixed habit with him. He drew out the\r\nthoughts of other people. He was enabled to see the subject from all\r\nsides. Even after his mind was made up to do a certain thing, he would\r\nstill argue against it. But in any other sense than this he took\r\ncounsel of no one upon the emancipation measure. The work was his work.\r\nHe presented his tentative proclamation to the cabinet on the 22d of\r\nJuly, 1862. The rest of the story is best told in Lincoln's own words:\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be midsummer, 1862. Things had gone on from bad to\r\nworse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan\r\nof operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our last\r\ncard, and must change our tactics or lose the game. I now determined\r\nupon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation\r\nwith, or knowledge of, the cabinet, I prepared the original draft of\r\nthe proclamation, and after much anxious thought called a cabinet\r\nmeeting upon the subject.... I said to the cabinet that I had resolved\r\nupon this step, and had not called them together to ask their advice,\r\nbut to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before them,\r\nsuggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the cabinet offered various suggestions, but none which\r\nLincoln had not fully anticipated. Seward approved the measure but\r\nthought the time not opportune. There had been so many reverses in the\r\nwar, that he feared the effect. \"It may be viewed,\" he said, \"as the\r\nlast measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help; the government\r\nstretching forth its hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching\r\nforth her hands to the government.\" He then suggested that the\r\nproclamation be not issued until it could be given to the country\r\nsupported by military successes. This seemed to Lincoln a wise\r\nsuggestion, and he acted on it. The document was laid away for the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt was not until September 17th that the looked-for success came. The\r\nConfederate army had crossed the Potomac with the intention of invading\r\nthe North. They were met and completely defeated in the battle of\r\nAntietam. Lincoln said of it: \"When Lee came over the river, I made a\r\nresolution that if McClellan drove him back I would send the\r\nproclamation after him. The battle of Antietam was fought Wednesday,\r\nand until Saturday I could not find out whether we had gained a victory\r\nor lost a battle. It was then too late to issue the proclamation that\r\nday; and the fact is I fixed it up a little Sunday, and Monday I let\r\nthem have it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the preliminary proclamation and was issued September 22d. The\r\nsupplementary document, the real proclamation of emancipation, was\r\nissued January 1, 1863. As the latter covers substantially the ground\r\nof the former, it is not necessary to repeat both and only the second\r\none is given.\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by\r\nthe President of the United States, containing, among other things, the\r\nfollowing, to wit:--\r\n\r\nThat on the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any\r\nstate, or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall then be\r\nin rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward\r\nand forever free, and the Executive Government of the United States,\r\nincluding the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and\r\nmaintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to\r\nrepress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for\r\ntheir actual freedom.\r\n\r\nThat the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid by\r\nproclamation, designate the states and part of states, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any state, or the people thereof,\r\nshall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the\r\nUnited States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority\r\nof the qualified voters of such state shall have participated, shall,\r\nin the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive\r\nevidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in\r\nrebellion against the United States:--\r\n\r\n_Now, therefore,_ I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United\r\nStates, by virtue of the power in me vested as commander-in-chief of\r\nthe army and navy of the United States, in time of actual armed\r\nrebellion against the authority of, and government of, the United\r\nStates, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said\r\nrebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my\r\npurpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one\r\nhundred days from the day first above mentioned, order, and designate,\r\nas the states and parts of states wherein the people thereof\r\nrespectively are this day in rebellion against the United States [here\r\nfollows the list].\r\n\r\nAnd by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order\r\nand declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated\r\nstates and parts of states, are and henceforward shall be free; and\r\nthat the executive government of the United States, including the\r\nmilitary and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the\r\nfreedom of said persons.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free, to abstain\r\nfrom all violence, unless in necessary self-defense, and I recommend to\r\nthem, that in all cases, when allowed, they labor faithfully for\r\nreasonable wages.\r\n\r\nAnd I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable\r\ncondition will be received into the armed service of the United States\r\nto garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man\r\nvessels of all sorts in said service.\r\n\r\nAnd upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,\r\nwarranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the\r\nconsiderate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty God.\r\n\r\n_In Testimony whereof,_ I have hereunto set my name and caused the\r\nseal of the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this first day of January, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nSo he fulfilled his youthful vow. He had hit that thing, and he had hit\r\nit hard! From that blow the cursed institution of slavery will not\r\nrecover in a thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nDISCOURAGEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middle period of the war was gloomy and discouraging. Though the\r\nConfederates made no substantial progress they certainly held their\r\nown. Time is an important factor in all history, and the fact that the\r\nConfederates at least gained time counted heavily against the Union.\r\nThere were no decisive victories gained by the Federal troops.\r\nAntietam, to be sure, was won, but the fruits of the victory were lost.\r\nFor many months the two armies continued facing each other, and for the\r\nmost part they were much nearer Washington than Richmond.\r\n\r\nMeantime the summer, fall, winter were passing by and there was no\r\ntangible evidence that the government would ever be able to maintain\r\nits authority. All this time the Army of the Potomac was magnificent in\r\nnumbers, equipment, intelligence. In every respect but one they were\r\ndecidedly superior to the enemy. The one thing they needed was\r\nleadership. The South had generals of the first grade. The generalship\r\nof the North had not yet fully developed.\r\n\r\nLincoln held on to McClellan as long as it was possible to do so. He\r\nnever resented the personal discourtesies. He never wearied of the\r\nfruitless task of urging him on. He never refused to let him have his\r\nown way provided he could show a reason for it. But his persistent\r\ninactivity wore out the patience of the country and finally of the army\r\nitself. With the exception of northern democrats with southern\r\nsympathies, who from the first were sure of only one thing, namely,\r\nthat the war was a failure, the clamor for the removal of McClellan was\r\nwell-nigh unanimous. To this clamor Lincoln yielded only when it became\r\nmanifestly foolish longer to resist it.\r\n\r\nA succeeding question was no less important: Who shall take his place?\r\nThere was in the East no general whose record would entitle him to this\r\nposition of honor and responsibility. In all the country there was at\r\nthat time no one whose successes were so conspicuous as to point him\r\nout as the coming man. But there were generals who had done good\r\nservice, and just at that time. Burnside was at the height of his\r\nsuccess. He was accordingly appointed. His record was good. He was an\r\nunusually handsome man, of soldierly bearing, and possessed many\r\nvaluable qualities. He was warmly welcomed by the country at large and\r\nby his own army, who thanked God and took courage.\r\n\r\nHis first battle as commander of the Army of the Potomac was fought at\r\nFredericksburg on the 15th of December and resulted in his being\r\nrepulsed with terrible slaughter. It is possible, in this as in every\r\nother battle, that had certain things been a little different,--had it\r\nbeen possible to fight the battle three weeks earlier,--he would have\r\nwon a glorious victory. But these thoughts do not bring to life the men\r\nwho were slain in battle, nor do they quiet the clamor of the country.\r\nBurnside showed a certain persistence when, in disregard of the\r\nunanimous judgment of his generals, he tried to force a march through\r\nthe heavy roads of Virginia, as sticky as glue, and give battle again.\r\nBut he got stuck in the mud and the plan was given up, the only\r\ncasualty, being the death of a large number of mules that were killed\r\ntrying to draw wagons through the bottomless mud. After this one\r\nbattle, it was plain that Burnside was not the coming general.\r\n\r\nThe next experiment was with Hooker, a valiant and able man, whose\r\nwarlike qualities are suggested by his well-earned soubriquet of\r\n\"fighting Joe Hooker.\" He had his limitations, as will presently\r\nappear. But upon appointing him to the command Lincoln wrote him a\r\npersonal letter. This letter is here reproduced because it is a perfect\r\nillustration of the kindly patience of the man who had need of so much\r\npatience:\r\n\r\n\"EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C., January 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER,\r\n\r\nGENERAL: I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\r\ncourse I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient\r\nreasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some\r\nthings in regard to which I am not satisfied with you. I believe you to\r\nbe a brave and skilful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe\r\nthat you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are\r\nright. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable, if not\r\nindispensable, quality. You are ambitious, which, within reason, does\r\ngood rather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's\r\ncommand of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and\r\nthwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to\r\nthe country, and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. I\r\nhave heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying\r\nthat both the army and the government needed a dictator. Of course it\r\nwas not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the\r\ncommand. Only those generals who gain success can be dictators. What I\r\nnow ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship.\r\nThe government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is\r\nneither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders.\r\nI much fear that the spirit you have aimed to infuse into the army, of\r\ncriticising their commander and withholding confidence from him, will\r\nnow turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down.\r\nNeither you, nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good\r\nout of an army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now, beware of\r\nrashness. Beware of rashness, but, with energy and sleepless vigilance,\r\ngo forward and give us victories.\r\n\r\n  Yours, very truly,\r\n   A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nThe first effect of this letter was to subdue the fractious spirit of\r\nthe fighter. He said, \"That is just such a letter as a father might\r\nwrite to a son. It is a beautiful letter, and although I think he was\r\nharder on me than I deserved, I will say that I love the man who wrote\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut later his conceit took possession of him. According to Noah Brooks\r\nhe said to some friends: \"I suppose you have seen this letter or a copy\r\nof it?\" They had. \"After I have been to Richmond I shall have the\r\nletter published in the newspapers. It will be amusing.\" When this was\r\ntold Lincoln he took the good-natured view of it and only said, \"Poor\r\nHooker! I am afraid he is incorrigible.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1863, that Hooker took command of the army. Three\r\nmonths later he had it in shape for the campaign, and Lincoln went down\r\nto see the review. It was indeed a magnificent army, an inspiring\r\nsight. But it was noticed by many that Lincoln's face had not the\r\njoyous radiancy of hope which it had formerly worn; it was positively\r\nhaggard. It was plain that he did not share his general's easy\r\nconfidence. He could not forget that he had more than once seen an army\r\nmagnificent before battle, and shattered after battle. He spent a week\r\nthere, talking with the generals, shaking hands with \"the boys.\" Many a\r\nprivate soldier of that day carries to this day as a sacred memory the\r\nearnest sound of the President's voice, \"God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nThen came Chancellorsville with its sickening consequences. When the\r\nnews came to Washington, the President, with streaming eyes, could only\r\nexclaim: \"My God, my God! what will the country say?\"\r\n\r\nThe next we hear of Hooker, he had not entered Richmond nor had he\r\nfound the amusement of publishing the President's fatherly letter. He\r\nwas chasing Lee in a northerly direction,--towards Philadelphia or New\r\nYork. He became angry with Halleck who refused him something and\r\nsummarily resigned. It was not, for the country, an opportune time for\r\nchanging generals, but perhaps it was as well. It certainly shows that\r\nwhile Lincoln took him as the best material at hand, while he\r\ncounseled, encouraged, and bore with him, yet his diagnosis of Hooker's\r\nfoibles was correct, and his fears, not his hopes, were realized.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by George C. Meade, \"four-eyed George,\" as he was\r\nplayfully called by his loyal soldiers, in allusion to his eyeglasses.\r\nIt was only a few days later that the great battle of Gettysburg was\r\nfought under Meade, and a brilliant victory was achieved. But here, as\r\nat Antietam, the triumph was bitterly marred by the disappointment that\r\nfollowed. The victorious army let the defeated army get away. The\r\nexcuses were about the same as at Antietam,--the troops were tired. Of\r\ncourse they were tired. But it may be assumed that the defeated army\r\nwas also tired. It surely makes one army quite as tired to suffer\r\ndefeat as it makes the other to achieve victory. It was again a golden\r\nopportunity to destroy Lee's army and end the war.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Meade had achieved enough for one man in winning Gettysburg. It\r\nwould not be strange if the three days' battle had left him with nerves\r\nunstrung. The fact remains that he did not pursue and annihilate the\r\ndefeated army. They were permitted to recross the Potomac without\r\nmolestation, to reenter what may be called their own territory, to\r\nreorganize, rest, reequip, and in due time to reappear as formidable as\r\never. It is plain that the hero of Gettysburg was not the man destined\r\nto crush the rebellion.\r\n\r\nHere were three men, Burnside, Hooker, and Meade, all good men and\r\ngallant soldiers. But not one of them was able successfully to command\r\nso large an army, or to do the thing most needed,--capture Richmond.\r\nThe future hero had not yet won the attention of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime affairs were very dark for the administration, and up\r\nto the summer of 1863 had been growing darker and darker. Some splendid\r\nmilitary success had been accomplished in the West, but the West is at\r\nbest a vague term even to this day, and it has always seemed so remote\r\nfrom the capital, especially as compared to the limited theater of war\r\nin Virginia where the Confederate army was almost within sight of the\r\ncapital, that these western victories did not have as much influence as\r\nthey should have had.\r\n\r\nAnd there were signal reverses in the West, too. Both Louisville and\r\nCincinnati were seriously threatened, and the battle of Chickamauga was\r\nanother field of slaughter, even though it was shortly redeemed by\r\nChattanooga. But the attention of the country was necessarily focussed\r\nchiefly on the limited territory that lay between Washington and\r\nRichmond. In that region nothing permanent or decisive had been\r\naccomplished in the period of more than two years, and it is small\r\nwonder that the President became haggard in appearance.\r\n\r\nHe did what he could. He had thus far held the divided North, and\r\nprevented a European alliance with the Confederates. He now used, one\r\nby one, the most extreme measures. He suspended the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, declared or authorized martial law, authorized the\r\nconfiscation of the property of those who were providing aid and\r\ncomfort for the enemy, called for troops by conscription when\r\nvolunteers ceased, and enlisted negro troops. Any person who studies\r\nthe character of Abraham Lincoln will realize that these measures, or\r\nmost of them, came from him with great reluctance. He was not a man who\r\nwould readily or lightly take up such means. They meant that the\r\ncountry was pressed, hard pressed. They were extreme measures, not\r\ncongenial to his accustomed lines of thought. They were as necessities.\r\n\r\nBut what Lincoln looked for, longed for, was the man who could use\r\nskillfully and successfully, the great Army of the Potomac. He had not\r\nyet been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nNEW HOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outlook from Washington during the first half of the year 1863 was\r\nas discouraging as could well be borne. There had been no real advance\r\nsince the beginning of the war. Young men, loyal and enthusiastic, had\r\ngone into the army by hundreds of thousands. Large numbers of these,\r\nthe flower of the northern youth, had been slain or wounded, and far\r\nlarger numbers had died of exposure in the swamps of Virginia. There\r\nwas still no progress. Washington had been defended, but there was\r\nhardly a day when the Confederates were not within menacing distance of\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nAfter the bloody disaster at Chancellorsville matters grew even worse.\r\nLee first defeated Hooker in battle and then he out-maneuvered him. He\r\ncleverly eluded him, and before Hooker was aware of what was going on,\r\nhe was on his way, with eighty thousand men, towards Philadelphia and\r\nhad nearly a week's start of the Union army. The Confederates had\r\nalways thought that if they could carry the war into the northern\r\nstates they would fight to better advantage. Jeff Davis had threatened\r\nthe torch, but it is not likely that such subordinates as General Lee\r\nshared his destructive and barbarous ambition. Still, Lee had a\r\nmagnificent army, and its presence in Pennsylvania was fitted to\r\ninspire terror. It was also fitted to rouse the martial spirit of the\r\nnorthern soldiers, as afterwards appeared.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the situation was known, Hooker started in hot pursuit.\r\nAfter he had crossed the Potomac going north, he made certain requests\r\nof the War Department which were refused, and he, angry at the refusal,\r\npromptly sent in his resignation. Whether his requests were reasonable\r\nis one question; whether it was patriotic in him to resign on the eve\r\nof what was certain to be a great and decisive battle is another\r\nquestion. But his resignation was accepted and Meade was appointed to\r\nthe command. He accepted the responsibility with a modest and soldierly\r\nspirit and quit himself like a man. It is one of the rare cases in all\r\nhistory in which an army has on the eve of battle made a change of\r\ngenerals without disaster. That is surely highly to the credit of\r\nGeneral Meade. Lee's objective point was not known. He might capture\r\nHarrisburg or Philadelphia, or both. He would probably desire to cut\r\noff all communication with Washington. The only thing to do was to\r\novertake him and force a battle. He himself realized this and was fully\r\ndecided not to give battle but fight only on the defensive. Curiously\r\nenough, Meade also decided not to attack, but to fight on the\r\ndefensive. Nevertheless, \"the best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang\r\naft agley.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was Gettysburg, and the battle was not fought in accordance\r\nwith the plan of either commander. Uncontrollable events forced the\r\nbattle then and there. This battle-field was some distance to the\r\nnorth, that is to say, in advance of Pipe Creek, the location selected\r\nby Meade. But a conflict between a considerable force on each side\r\nopened the famous battle on July 1st. A retreat, or withdrawal, to Pipe\r\nCreek would have been disastrous. The first clash was between Heth's\r\ndivision on the Confederate side, and Buford and Reynolds on the Union\r\nside. Rarely have soldiers been more eager for the fray than were those\r\nof the Union army at this time, especially the sons of Pennsylvania.\r\n\"Up and at 'em\" was the universal feeling. It was hardly possible to\r\nhold them back. The generals felt that it was not wise to hold them\r\nback. Thus, as one division after another, on both sides, came up to\r\nthe help of their comrades, Gettysburg was accepted as the battle-\r\nfield. It was selected by neither commander, it was thrust upon them by\r\nthe fortunes of war, it was selected by the God of battles.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first victim on the Union side was that talented and brave\r\nsoldier, the general in command, Reynolds. His place was later in the\r\nday,--that is, about four o'clock in the afternoon,--filled, and well\r\nfilled, by General Hancock.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this volume does not permit the description of this great\r\nbattle, and only some of the results may be given. The evening of July\r\n1st closed in with the Union army holding out, but with the advantages,\r\nsuch as they were, on the Confederate side. The second day the fight\r\nwas fiercely renewed and closed with no special advantage on either\r\nside. On the third day it was still undecided until in the afternoon\r\nwhen the climax came in Pickett's famous charge. This was the very\r\nflower of the Confederate army, and the hazard of the charge was taken\r\nby General Lee against the earnest advice of Longstreet. They were\r\nrepulsed and routed, and that decided the battle. Lee's army was turned\r\nback, the attempted invasion was a failure, and it became manifest that\r\neven Lee could not fight to advantage on northern soil.\r\n\r\nGettysburg was the greatest battle ever fought on the western\r\nhemisphere, and it will easily rank as one of the great battles of\r\neither hemisphere. The number of troops was about 80,000 on each side.\r\nIn the beginning the Confederates decidedly outnumbered the Federals,\r\nbecause the latter were more scattered and it took time to bring them\r\nup. In the latter part, the numbers were more nearly evenly divided,\r\nthough nearly one-fourth of Meade's men were not in the battle at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of killed, wounded, and missing, was on the Confederate\r\nside over 31,000; on the Union side, about 23,000. The Confederates\r\nlost seventeen generals, and the Federals twenty. When we consider this\r\nloss of generals, bearing in mind that on the Union side they were\r\nmostly those on whom Meade would naturally lean, it is hardly to be\r\nwondered at that he so far lost his nerve as to be unwilling to pursue\r\nthe retreating enemy or hazard another battle. He could not realize\r\nthat the enemy had suffered much more than he had, and that, despite\r\nhis losses, he was in a condition to destroy that army. Not all that\r\nLincoln could say availed to persuade him to renew the attack upon the\r\nretreating foe. When Lee reached the Potomac he found the river so\r\nswollen as to be impassable. He could only wait for the waters to\r\nsubside or for time to improvise a pontoon bridge.\r\n\r\nWhen, after waiting for ten days, Meade was aroused to make the attack,\r\nhe was just one day too late. Lee had got his army safely into\r\nVirginia, and the war was not over. Lincoln could only say, \"Providence\r\nhas twice [the other reference is to Antietam] delivered the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia into our hands, and with such opportunities lost we\r\nought scarcely to hope for a third chance.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln wrote a letter to Meade. He also wrote him a second letter--or\r\nwas it the first?--which he did not send. We quote from this because it\r\nreally expressed the President's mind, and because the fact that he did\r\nnot send it only shows how reluctant he was to wound another's feelings\r\neven when deserved.\r\n\r\n\"Again, my dear general, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude\r\nof the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within your easy\r\ngrasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other\r\nlate successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged\r\nindefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can\r\nyou possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very\r\nfew more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be\r\nunreasonable to expect, and I do not expect, that you can now effect\r\nmuch. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably\r\nbecause of it. I beg you will not consider this a prosecution or\r\npersecution of yourself. As you had learned that I was dissatisfied, I\r\nthought it best to kindly tell you why.\"\r\n\r\nWhile not overlooking Meade's omission, as this letter shows, he\r\nappreciated the full value of the victory that checked Lee's advance,\r\nand thanked the general heartily for that.\r\n\r\nOn the same afternoon of July 3d, almost at the very minute that\r\nPickett was making his charge, there was in progress, a thousand miles\r\nto the west, an event of almost equal importance. Just outside the\r\nfortifications of Vicksburg, under an oak tree, General Grant had met\r\nthe Confederate General, Pemberton, to negotiate terms of surrender.\r\nThe siege of Vicksburg was a great triumph, and its capitulation was of\r\nscarcely less importance than the victory at Gettysburg. Vicksburg\r\ncommanded the Mississippi River and was supposed to be impregnable.\r\nSurely few cities were situated more favorably to resist either attack\r\nor siege. But Admiral Porter got his gunboats below the city, running\r\nthe batteries in the night, and Grant's investment was complete. The\r\nConfederate cause was hopeless, their men nearly starved.\r\n\r\nGrant's _plan_ was to make a final attack (if necessary) on the 6th or\r\n7th day of July; but some time previous to this he had predicted that\r\nthe garrison would surrender on the fourth. General Pemberton tried his\r\nutmost to avoid this very thing. When it became apparent that he could\r\nnot hold out much longer, he opened negotiations on the morning of July\r\n3d for the specific purpose of forestalling the possibility of\r\nsurrender on the next day, Independence Day. In his report to the\r\nConfederate government he claims to have chosen the 4th of July for\r\nsurrender, because he thought that he could secure better terms on that\r\nday. But his pompous word has little weight, and all the evidence\r\npoints the other way. When on the morning of the 3d of July he opened\r\nnegotiations, he could not possibly have foreseen that it would take\r\ntwenty-four hours to arrange the terms.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, on the 4th of July that Grant occupied Vicksburg. The\r\naccount by Nicolay and Hay ends with the following beautiful\r\nreflection: \"It is not the least of the glories gained by the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee in this wonderful campaign that not a single cheer went\r\nup from the Union ranks, not a single word [was spoken] that could\r\noffend their beaten foes.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing, was about\r\n9,000. The Confederate loss was nearly 50,000. To be sure many of the\r\nparoled were compelled to reenlist according to the policy of the\r\nConfederate government. But even so their parole was a good thing for\r\nthe cause of the Union. They were so thoroughly disaffected that their\r\nrelease did, for the time, more harm than good to the southern cause.\r\nThen it left Grant's army free.\r\n\r\nThe sequel to this victory came ten months later in Sherman's march to\r\nthe sea: not less thrilling in its conception and dramatic in its\r\nexecution than any battle or siege. Much fighting, skilful generalship,\r\nlong patience were required before this crowning act could be done, but\r\nit came in due time and was one of the finishing blows to the\r\nConfederacy, and it came as a logical result of the colossal victory at\r\nVicksburg.\r\n\r\nThere were some eddies and counter currents to the main drift of\r\naffairs. About the time that Lee and his beaten army were making good\r\ntheir escape, terrific riots broke out in New York City in resisting\r\nthe draft. As is usual in mob rule the very worst elements of human or\r\ndevilish depravity came to the top and were most in evidence. For\r\nseveral days there was indeed a reign of terror. The fury of the mob\r\nwas directed particularly against the negroes. They were murdered.\r\nTheir orphan asylum was burnt. But the government quickly suppressed\r\nthe riot with a firm hand. The feeling was general throughout the\r\ncountry that we were now on the way to a successful issue of the war.\r\nThe end was almost in sight. Gettysburg and Vicksburg, July 3 and 4,\r\n1863, had inspired new hopes never to be quenched.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of July the President issued a thanksgiving\r\nproclamation, designating August 6th as the day. Later in the year he\r\nissued another thanksgiving proclamation, designating the last Thursday\r\nin November. Previous to that time, certain states, and not a few\r\nindividuals, were in the habit of observing a thanksgiving day in\r\nNovember. Indeed the custom, in a desultory way, dates back to Plymouth\r\nColony. But these irregular and uncertain observances never took on the\r\nsemblance of a national holiday. _That_ dates from the proclamation\r\nissued October 3d, 1863. From that day to this, every President has\r\nevery year followed that example.\r\n\r\nLincoln was invited to attend a public meeting appointed for August\r\n26th at his own city of Springfield, the object of which was to concert\r\nmeasures for the maintenance of the Union. The pressure of public\r\nduties did not permit him to leave Washington, but he wrote a\r\ncharacteristic letter, a part of which refers to some of the events\r\ntouched on in this chapter. A few sentences of this letter are here\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea. Thanks to the\r\ngreat Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to them. Three hundred miles tip\r\nthey met New England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way\r\nright and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors than one, also\r\nlent a helping hand. On the spot, their part of the history was jotted\r\ndown in black and white. The job was a great national one, and let none\r\nbe slighted who bore an honorable part in it. And while those who have\r\ncleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\r\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at\r\nAntietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less note.\r\nNor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins\r\nthey have been present, not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and\r\nthe rapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the\r\nground was a little damp, they have been and made their tracks. Thanks\r\nto all. For the great republic--for the principle it lives by and keeps\r\nalive--for man's vast future--thanks to all.\r\n\r\n\"Peace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon\r\nand come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future\r\ntime. It will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no\r\nsuccessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they who take\r\nsuch appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there\r\nwill be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue and\r\nclenched teeth and steady eye and well-poised bayonet they have helped\r\nmankind on to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some\r\nwhite ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful\r\nspeech they have striven to hinder it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain that after July 4, 1863, the final result was no longer\r\ndoubtful. So Lincoln felt it. There were indeed some who continued to\r\ncry that the war was a failure, but in such cases the wish was only\r\nfather to the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great army of R. E. Lee operated, through the whole period of the\r\nfour years of the war, almost within sight of Washington City. It is\r\nnot in the least strange that eastern men, many of whom had hardly\r\ncrossed the Alleghanies, should think that the operations in Virginia\r\nwere about all the war there was, and that the fighting in the West was\r\nof subordinate importance. Lincoln could not fall into this error. Not\r\nonly had he a singularly broad vision, but he was himself a western\r\nman. He fully appreciated the magnitude of the operations in that vast\r\nterritory lying between the Alleghanies on the east and the western\r\nboundary of Missouri on the west. He also clearly understood the\r\nimportance of keeping open the Mississippi River throughout its entire\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAt the very time the Army of the Potomac was apparently doing nothing,\r\n--winning no victories, destroying no armies, making no permanent\r\nadvances,--there was a man in the West who was building up for himself\r\na remarkable reputation. He was all the while winning victories,\r\ndestroying armies, making advances. He was always active, he was always\r\nsuccessful. The instant one thing was accomplished he turned his\r\nenergies to a new task. This was Grant.\r\n\r\nHe was a graduate of West Point, had seen service in the Mexican War,\r\nand ultimately rose to the grade of captain. At the outbreak of the war\r\nhe was in business with his father in Galena, Illinois. When the\r\nPresident called for the 75,000 men, Grant proceeded at once to make\r\nhimself useful by drilling volunteer troops. He was by the governor of\r\nIllinois commissioned as colonel, and was soon promoted. His first\r\nservice was in Missouri. When stationed at Cairo he seized Paducah on\r\nhis own responsibility. This stroke possibly saved Kentucky for the\r\nUnion, for the legislature, which had up to that time been wavering,\r\ndeclared at once in favor of the Union.\r\n\r\nHe was then ordered to break up a Confederate force at Belmont, a few\r\nmiles below Cairo. He started at once on his expedition, and though the\r\nenemy was largely reinforced before his arrival, he was entirely\r\nsuccessful and returned with victory, not excuses.\r\n\r\nThen came Forts Henry and Donaldson. The latter attracted unusual\r\nattention because it was the most important Union victory up to that\r\ntime, and because of his epigrammatic reply to the offer of surrender.\r\nWhen asked what terms he would allow, his reply was, \"Unconditional\r\nsurrender.\" As these initials happened to fit the initials of his name,\r\nhe was for a long time called \"Unconditional Surrender Grant.\" So he\r\npassed promptly from one task to another, from one victory to another.\r\nAnd Lincoln kept watch of him. He began to think that Grant was the man\r\nfor the army.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Lincoln, while he gave general directions to his\r\nsoldiers, and freely offered suggestions, left them to work out the\r\nmilitary details in their own way. This is so well illustrated in his\r\nletter to Grant that, for this reason, as well as for the intrinsic\r\ninterest of the letter, it is here given in full:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GENERAL:--I do not remember that you and I ever met\r\npersonally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the\r\nalmost inestimable service you have done the country. I wish to say a\r\nword further. When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I\r\nthought you should do what you finally did--march the troops across the\r\nneck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I\r\nnever had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I,\r\nthat the Yazoo Pass expedition and the like could succeed. When you got\r\nbelow and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you\r\nshould go down the river and join General Banks; and when you turned\r\nnorthward, east of the Big Black, I thought it was a mistake. I now\r\nwish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right and I was\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nThere was surely no call for this confession, no reason for the letter,\r\nexcept the bigness of the heart of the writer. Like the letter to\r\nHooker, it was just such a letter as a father might write a son. It was\r\nthe production of a high grade of manliness.\r\n\r\nProminence always brings envy, fault-finding, hostility. From this\r\nGrant did not escape. The more brilliant and uniform his successes, the\r\nmore clamorous a certain class of people became. The more strictly he\r\nattended to his soldierly duties, the more busily certain people tried\r\nto interfere,--to tell him how to do, or how not to do. In their self-\r\nappointed censorship they even besieged the President and made life a\r\nburden to him. With wit and unfailing good nature, he turned their\r\ncriticisms. When they argued that Grant could not possibly be a good\r\nsoldier, he replied, \"I like him; he fights.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they charged him with drunkenness, Lincoln jocularly proposed that\r\nthey ascertain the brand of the whisky he drank and buy up a large\r\namount of the same sort to send to his other generals, so that they\r\nmight win victories like him!\r\n\r\nGrant's important victories in the West came in rapid and brilliant\r\nsuccession. Forts Henry and Donaldson were captured in February, 1862.\r\nThe battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing, was fought in April of the\r\nsame year. Vicksburg surrendered July 4th, 1863. And the battle of\r\nChattanooga took place in November of that year.\r\n\r\nGrant was always sparing of words and his reports were puzzling to the\r\nadministration. He always reported, and that promptly. But his reports\r\nwere of the briefest description and in such marked contrast to those\r\nof all other officers known to the government, that they were a mystery\r\nto those familiar with certain others. Lincoln said that Grant could do\r\nanything except write a report. He concluded to send a trusty messenger\r\nto see what manner of man this victorious general was. Charles A. Dana,\r\nAssistant-Secretary of War, was chosen for this purpose. His\r\ninvestigation was satisfactory, fully so. Lincoln's confidence in, and\r\nhopes for, this rising warrior were fully justified.\r\n\r\nIt was after the capitulation of Vicksburg that Grant grasped the fact\r\nthat he was the man destined to end the war. After the battle of\r\nChattanooga public opinion generally pointed to him as the general who\r\nwas to lead our armies to ultimate victory. In February, 1864, congress\r\npassed an act creating the office of Lieutenant General. The President\r\napproved that act on Washington's birthday, and nominated Grant for\r\nthat office. The senate confirmed this nomination on March 2d, and\r\nGrant was ordered to report at Washington.\r\n\r\nWith his usual promptness he started at once for Washington, arriving\r\nthere the 8th of March. The laconic conversation which took place\r\nbetween the President and the general has been reported about as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To take Richmond. Can you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you furnish me troops enough.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening there was a levee at the White House which he attended.\r\nThe crowd were very eager to see him, and he was persuaded to mount a\r\nsofa, which he did blushing, so that they might have a glimpse of him,\r\nbut he could not be prevailed on to make a speech. On parting that\r\nevening with the President, he said, \"This is the warmest campaign I\r\nhave witnessed during the war.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening Lincoln informed him that he would on the next day\r\nformally present his commission with a brief speech--four sentences in\r\nall. He suggested that Grant reply in a speech suitable to be given out\r\nto the country in the hope of reviving confidence and courage. The\r\nformality of the presentation occurred the next day, but the general\r\ndisappointed the President as to the speech. He accepted the commission\r\nwith remarks of soldier-like brevity.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting here to say of General Meade that as he had accepted his\r\npromotion to the command of the Army of the Potomac with dignified\r\nhumility, so he accepted his being superseded with loyal obedience. In\r\nboth cases he was a model of a patriot and a soldier.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he received his commission Grant visited his future army--\r\nthe Army of the Potomac. Upon his return Mrs. Lincoln planned to give a\r\ndinner in his honor. But this was not to his taste. He said, \"Mrs.\r\nLincoln must excuse me. I must be in Tennessee at a given time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" replied the President, \"we can't excuse you. Mrs. Lincoln's\r\ndinner without you would be Hamlet with Hamlet left out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate the honor Mrs. Lincoln would do me,\" he said, \"but time\r\nis very important now--and really--Mr. Lincoln--I have had enough of\r\nthis show business.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was disappointed in losing the guest for dinner, but he was\r\ndelighted with the spirit of his new general.\r\n\r\nGrant made his trip to the West. How he appreciated the value of time\r\nis shown by the fact that he had his final conference with his\r\nsuccessor, General Sherman, who was also his warm friend, on the\r\nrailway train _en route_ to Cincinnati. He had asked Sherman to\r\naccompany him so far for the purpose of saving time.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th General Grant assumed command of the armies of the United\r\nStates with headquarters in the field. He was evidently in earnest. As\r\nLincoln had cordially offered help and encouragement to all the other\r\ngenerals, so he did to Grant. The difference between one general and\r\nanother was not in Lincoln's offer of help, or refusal to give it, but\r\nthere was a difference in the way in which his offers were received.\r\nThe following correspondence tells the story of the way he held himself\r\nalert to render assistance:\r\n\r\n\"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nLIEUT.-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nNot expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens, I wish\r\nto express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done\r\nup to this time, so far as I understand it. The particulars of your\r\nplan I neither know nor seek to know. You are vigilant and self-\r\nreliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any constraints\r\nor restraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any great disaster\r\nor capture of our men in great numbers shall be avoided, I know these\r\npoints will be less likely to escape your attention than they would be\r\nmine. If there is anything wanting which is within my power to give, do\r\nnot fail to let me know it. And now, with a brave army and a just\r\ncause, may God sustain you.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n   A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Headquarters Armies of the United States,\r\n   Culpepper Court-House, May 1, 1864.\"\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n\"Your very kind letter of yesterday is just received. The confidence\r\nyou express for the future and satisfaction with the past in my\r\nmilitary administration is acknowledged with pride. It will be my\r\nearnest endeavor that you and the country shall not be disappointed.\r\nFrom my first entrance into the volunteer service of the country to the\r\npresent day, I have never had cause of complaint--have never expressed\r\nor implied a complaint against the Administration, or the Secretary of\r\nWar, for throwing any embarrassment in the way of my vigorously\r\nprosecuting what appeared to me my duty. Indeed since the promotion\r\nwhich placed me in command of all the armies, and in view of the great\r\nresponsibility and importance of success, I have been astonished at the\r\nreadiness with which everything asked for has been yielded, without\r\neven an explanation being asked. Should my success be less than I\r\ndesire and expect, the least I can say is, the fault is not with you.\r\n\r\n  Very truly, your obedient servant,\r\n   U. S. Grant, _Lieut-General_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is just here a subject on which there is a curious difference of\r\nopinion between Grant and John Hay. Grant says that, on his last visit\r\nto Washington before taking the field, the President had become\r\nacquainted with the fact that a general movement had been ordered all\r\nalong the line, and _seemed_ (italics ours) to think it a new\r\nfeature in war. He explained this plan to the President who was greatly\r\ninterested and said, \"Oh, yes! I see that. As we say out West, if a man\r\ncan't skin, he must hold a leg while somebody else does.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, at the same time, documentary evidence that Lincoln had been\r\ncontinually urging this precise plan on all his generals. Mr. Hay\r\ntherefore distrusts the accuracy of General Grant's memory. To the\r\npresent writer, there is no mystery in the matter. The full truth is\r\nlarge enough to include the statement of Grant as well as that of\r\nNicolay and Hay. Mr. Hay is certainly right in claiming that Lincoln\r\nfrom the first desired such a concerted movement all along the line;\r\nfor, even though not all could fight at the same time, those not\r\nfighting could help otherwise. This was the force of the western\r\nproverb, \"Those not skinning can hold a leg,\" which he quoted to all\r\nhis generals from Buell to Grant.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore Grant explained precisely this plan to Lincoln, the\r\nlatter refrained from the natural utterance,--\"That is exactly what I\r\nhave been trying to get our generals to do all these years.\" In\r\ncourtesy to Grant he did not claim to have originated the plan, hut\r\nsimply preserved a polite silence. He followed eagerly as the general\r\nreiterated his own ideas, and the exclamation, \"Oh, yes! I see that,\"\r\nwould mean more to Lincoln than Grant could possibly have guessed. He\r\ndid see it, he had seen it a long time.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Lincoln had, for the sake of comprehending\r\nthe significance of one word, mastered Euclid after he became a lawyer.\r\nThere is here another evidence of the same thoroughness and force of\r\nwill. During the months when the Union armies were accomplishing\r\nnothing, he procured the necessary books and set himself, in the midst\r\nof all his administrative cares, to the task of learning the science of\r\nwar. That he achieved more than ordinary success will now surprise no\r\none who is familiar with his character. His military sagacity is\r\nattested by so high an authority as General Sherman. Other generals\r\nhave expressed their surprise and gratification at his knowledge and\r\npenetration in military affairs. But never at any time did he lord it\r\nover his generals. He did make suggestions. He did ask McClellan why\r\none plan was better than another. He did ask some awkward questions of\r\nMeade. But it was his uniform policy to give his generals all possible\r\nhelp, looking only for results, and leaving details unreservedly in\r\ntheir hands. This is the testimony of McClellan and Grant, and the\r\ntestimony of the two generals, so widely different in character and\r\nmethod, should be and is conclusive. Grant says that Lincoln expressly\r\nassured him that he preferred not to know his purposes,--he desired\r\nonly to learn what means he needed to carry them out, and promised to\r\nfurnish these to the full extent of his power.\r\n\r\nSide by side these two men labored, each in his own department, until\r\nthe war was ended and their work was done. Though so different, they\r\nwere actuated by the same spirit. Not even the southern generals\r\nthemselves had deeper sympathy with, or greater tenderness for, the\r\nmass of the Confederate soldiers. It was the same magnanimity in\r\nLincoln and Grant that sent the conquered army, after their final\r\ndefeat, back to the industries of peace that they might be able to\r\nprovide against their sore needs.\r\n\r\nWhen that madman assassinated the President, the conspiracy included\r\nalso the murder of the general. This failed only by reason of Grant's\r\nunexpected absence from Washington City on the night of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nLITERARY CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of the President of the United States include the writing of\r\nstate papers that are considerable both in number and in volume. Many\r\nof the Presidents, from Washington down, have been men of great\r\nability, and almost all of them have had sufficient academic training\r\nor intellectual environments in their early years. These state papers\r\nhave frequently been such as to compare favorably with those of the\r\nablest statesmen of Europe. With every new election of President the\r\npeople wait in expectancy for the inaugural address and the messages to\r\ncongress. These are naturally measured by the standard of what has\r\npreceded--not of all that has preceded, for the inferior ones are\r\nforgotten, but of the best. This is no light test for any man.\r\n\r\nLincoln's schooling was so slight as to be almost _nil_. He did not\r\ngrow up in a literary atmosphere. But in the matter of his official\r\nutterances he must be compared with the ablest geniuses and most\r\ncultured scholars that have preceded him, and not merely with his early\r\nassociates. He is to be measured with Washington, the Adamses,\r\nJefferson, and not with the denizens of Gentryville or New Salem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best study of his keenness of literary criticism will be\r\nfound in his correction of Seward's letter of instruction to Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, minister to England, under date of May 21, 1861. Seward\r\nwas a brilliant scholar, a polished writer, a trained diplomatist. If\r\nany person were able to compose a satisfactory letter for the critical\r\nconditions of that period, he was the one American most likely to do\r\nit. He drafted the letter and submitted it to Lincoln for suggestions\r\nand corrections. The original manuscript with Lincoln's\r\ninterlineations, is still preserved, and facsimiles, or copies, are\r\ngiven in various larger volumes of Lincoln's biography. This document\r\nis very instructive. In every case Lincoln's suggestion is a marked\r\nimprovement on the original. It shows that he had the better command of\r\nprecise English. Lowell himself could not have improved his criticisms.\r\nIt shows, too, that he had a firmer grasp of the subject. Had Seward's\r\npaper gone without these corrections, it is almost certain that\r\ndiplomatic relations with England would have been broken off. In\r\nliterary matters Lincoln was plainly the master and Seward was the\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nThe power which Lincoln possessed of fitting language to thought is\r\nmarked. It made him the matchless story-teller, and gave sublimity to\r\nhis graver addresses. His thoroughness and accuracy were a source of\r\nwonder and delight to scholars. He had a masterful grasp of great\r\nsubjects. He was able to look at events from all sides, so as to\r\nappreciate how they would appear to different grades of intelligence,\r\ndifferent classes of people, different sections of the country. More\r\nthan once this many-sidedness of his mind saved the country from ruin.\r\nWit and humor are usually joined with their opposite, pathos, and it is\r\ntherefore not surprising that, being eminent in one, he should possess\r\nall three characteristics. In his conversation his humor predominated,\r\nin his public speeches pure reasoning often rose to pathos.\r\n\r\nIf the author were to select a few of his speeches or papers fitted to\r\ngive the best example of his literary qualities, and at the same time\r\npresent an evidence of the progress of his doctrine along political\r\nlines, he would name the following: The House-divided-against-itself\r\nspeech, delivered at Springfield June 16, 1858. The underlying thought\r\nof this was that the battle between freedom and slavery was sure to be\r\na fight to the finish.\r\n\r\nNext is the Cooper Institute speech, Feb. 12, 1860. The argument in\r\nthis is that, in the thought and intent of the founders of our\r\ngovernment, the Union was permanent and paramount, while slavery was\r\ntemporary and secondary.\r\n\r\nNext was his inaugural, March 4, 1861. This warned the country against\r\nsectional war. It declared temperately but firmly, that he would\r\nperform the duties which his oath of office required of him, but he\r\nwould _not_ begin a war: if war came the aggressors must be those\r\nof the other side.\r\n\r\nThe next was the Emancipation Proclamation, September 22, 1862, and\r\nJanuary 1, 1863. This was not a general and complete emancipation of\r\nall slaves, it was primarily a military device, a war measure, freeing\r\nthe slaves of those who were in actual and armed rebellion at the time.\r\nIt was intended to weaken the belligerent powers of the rebels, and a\r\nnotice of the plan was furnished more than three months in advance,\r\ngiving ample time to all who wished to do so, to submit to the laws of\r\ntheir country and save that portion of their property that was invested\r\nin slaves.\r\n\r\nThen came the second inaugural, March 4, 1865. There was in this little\r\nto discuss, for he had no new policy to proclaim, he was simply to\r\ncontinue the policy of the past four years, of which the country had\r\nshown its approval by reelecting him. The end of the war was almost in\r\nsight, it would soon he finished. But in this address there breathes an\r\nintangible spirit which gives it marvelous grandeur. Isaiah was a\r\nprophet who was also a statesman. Lincoln--we say it with reverence--\r\nwas a statesman who was also a prophet. He had foresight. He had\r\n_in_sight. He saw the hand of God shaping events, he saw the spirit of\r\nGod in events. Such is his spiritual elevation of thought, such his\r\ntenderness of yearning, that there is no one but Isaiah to whom we may\r\nfittingly compare him, in the manly piety of his closing paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of\r\nwar may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until\r\nall the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of\r\nunrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with\r\nthe lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\r\nthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of\r\nthe Lord are true and righteous altogether. With malice toward none,\r\nwith charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to\r\nsee the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in; to bind up\r\nthe nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have home the battle,\r\nand for his widow, and his orphan; to do all which may achieve and\r\ncherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of these five speeches, or papers, will give the salient\r\npoints of his political philosophy, and incidentally of his\r\nintellectual development. These are not enough to show the man Lincoln,\r\nbut they do give a true idea of the great statesman. They show a\r\nsymmetrical and wonderful growth. Great as was the House-divided-\r\nagainst-itself speech, there is yet a wide difference between that and\r\nthe second inaugural: and the seven years intervening accomplished this\r\ngrowth of mind and of spirit only because they were years of great\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nOutside of this list is the address at the dedication of Gettysburg\r\ncemetery, November 19, 1863. This was not intended for an oration.\r\nEdward Everett was the orator of the occasion. Lincoln's part was to\r\npronounce the formal words of dedication. It was a busy time--all times\r\nwere busy with him, but this was unusually busy--and he wrote it on a\r\nsheet of foolscap paper in such odd moments as he could command. In\r\nform it is prose, but in effect it is a poem. Many of its sentences are\r\nrhythmical. The occasion lifted him into a higher realm of thought. The\r\nhearers were impressed by his unusual gravity and solemnity of manner\r\nquite as much, perhaps, as by the words themselves. They were awed,\r\nmany were moved to tears. The speech is given in full:\r\n\r\nGETTYSBURG ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a\r\ngreat civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so\r\nconceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great\r\nbattle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that\r\nfield as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that\r\nthat nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we\r\nshould do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot\r\nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and\r\ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power\r\nto add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what\r\nwe say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us,\r\nthe living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which\r\nthey who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for\r\nus to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,--that\r\nfrom these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for\r\nwhich they gave the last full measure of devotion,--that we here highly\r\nresolve that these dead shall not have died in vain,--that this nation,\r\nunder God, shall have a new birth of freedom,--and that government of\r\nthe people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this speech was not immediate. Colonel Lamon was on the\r\nplatform when it was delivered and he says very decidedly that Everett,\r\nSeward, himself, and Lincoln were all of opinion that the speech was a\r\nfailure. He adds: \"I state it as a fact, and without fear of\r\ncontradiction, that this famous Gettysburg speech was not regarded by\r\nthe audience to whom it was addressed, or by the press or people of the\r\nUnited States, as a production of extraordinary merit, nor was it\r\ncommented on as such until after the death of the author.\"\r\n\r\nA search through the files of the leading New York dailies for several\r\ndays immediately following the date of the speech, seems to confirm\r\nLamon's remark--all except the last clause above quoted. These papers\r\ngive editorial praise to the oration of Everett, they comment favorably\r\non a speech by Beecher (who had just returned from England), but they\r\nmake no mention of Lincoln's speech. It is true that a day or two later\r\nEverett wrote him a letter of congratulation upon his success. But this\r\nmay have been merely generous courtesy,--as much as to say, \"Don't feel\r\nbadly over it, it was a much better speech than you think!\" Or, on the\r\nother hand, it may have been the result of his sober second thought,\r\nthe speech had time to soak in.\r\n\r\nBut the silence of the great daily papers confirms Lamon up to a\r\ncertain point. At the very first the speech was not appreciated. But\r\nafter a few days the public awoke to the fact that Lincoln's \"few\r\nremarks\" were immeasurably superior to Everett's brilliant and learned\r\noration. The author distinctly remembers that it was compared to the\r\noration of Pericles in memory of the Athenian dead; that it was\r\ncurrently said that there had been no memorial oration from that date\r\nto Lincoln's speech of equal power. This comparison with Pericles is\r\ncertainly high praise, but is it not true? The two orations are very\r\ndifferent: Lincoln's was less than three hundred words long, that of\r\nPericles near three thousand. Pericles gloried in war, Lincoln mourned\r\nover the necessity of war and yearned after peace. But both orators\r\nalike appreciated the glory of sacrifice for one's country. And it is\r\nsafe to predict that this Gettysburg address, brief, hastily prepared,\r\nunderestimated by its author, will last as long as the republic shall\r\nlast, as long as English speech shall endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nSECOND ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Lincoln's life-long habit to keep himself close to the plain\r\npeople. He loved them. He declared that the Lord must love them or he\r\nwould not have made so many of them. Out of them he came, to them he\r\nbelonged. In youth he was the perennial peacemaker and umpire of\r\ndisputes in his rural neighborhood. When he was President the same\r\npeople instinctively turned to him for help. The servants called him\r\nOld Abe,--from them a term of affection, not of indignity. The soldiers\r\ncalled him Father Abraham. He was glad to receive renowned politicians\r\nand prominent business men at the White House; he was more glad to see\r\nthe plain people. When a farmer neighbor addressed him as \"Mister\r\nPresident,\" he said, \"Call me Lincoln.\" The friendship of these people\r\nrested him.\r\n\r\nThen, too, he had a profound realization of their importance to the\r\nnational prosperity. It was their instincts that constituted the\r\nnational conscience. It was their votes that had elected him. It was\r\ntheir muskets that had defended the capital. It was on their loyalty\r\nthat he counted for the ultimate triumph of the Union cause. As his\r\nadministrative policy progressed it was his concern not to outstrip\r\nthem so far as to lose their support. In other words, he was to lead\r\nthem, not run away from them. His confidence in them was on the whole\r\nwell founded, though there were times when the ground seemed to be\r\nslipping out from under him.\r\n\r\nThe middle portion of 1864 was one such period of discouragement. The\r\nmaterial for volunteer soldiers was about exhausted, and it was\r\nbecoming more and more necessary to depend upon the draft, and that\r\nmeasure caused much friction. The war had been long, costly, sorrowful.\r\nGrant was before Petersburg, Farragut at Mobile, and Sherman at\r\nAtlanta. The two first had no promise of immediate success, and as to\r\nthe third it was a question whether he was not caught in his own trap.\r\nThis prolongation of the war had a bad effect on the northern public.\r\n\r\nLincoln, shrewdly and fairly, analyzed the factions of loyal people as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"We are in civil war. In such cases there always is a main question;\r\nbut in this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and\r\nslavery. It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at\r\nleast four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying\r\nnothing of those who are against it. Thus--\r\n\r\nThose who are for the Union with, but not without, slavery;\r\n\r\nThose for it without, but not with;\r\n\r\nThose for it with or without, but prefer it with; and\r\n\r\nThose for it with or without, but prefer it without.\r\n\r\nAmong these again is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but\r\nnot for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for\r\ngradual, extinction of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nOne man who was in the political schemes of that day says that in\r\nWashington there were only three prominent politicians who were not\r\nseriously discontented with and opposed to Lincoln. The three named\r\nwere Conkling, Sumner, and Wilson. Though there was undoubtedly a\r\nlarger number who remained loyal to their chief, yet the discontent was\r\ngeneral. The President himself felt this. Nicolay and Hay have\r\npublished a note which impressively tells the sorrowful story:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Executive Mansion,\r\n  Washington, August 28, 1864.\r\n\r\nThis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that\r\nthis administration will not be reelected. Then it will be my duty to\r\nso cooperate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the\r\nelection and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on\r\nsuch ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\r\n\r\n  A. Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the year this discontent had broken out in a disagreeable and\r\ndangerous form. The malcontents were casting about to find a candidate\r\nwho would defeat Lincoln. They first tried General Rosecrans, and from\r\nhim they got an answer of no uncertain sound. \"My place,\" he declared,\r\n\"is here. The country gave me my education, and so has a right to my\r\nmilitary services.\"\r\n\r\nTheir next attempt was Grant, with whom they fared no better. Then they\r\ntried Vice-President Hamlin who was certainly dissatisfied with the\r\nslowness with which Lincoln moved in the direction of abolition. But\r\nHamlin would not be a candidate against his chief.\r\n\r\nThen the Secretary of the Treasury, Chase, entered the race as a rival\r\nof Lincoln. When this became known, the President was urged by his\r\nfriends to dismiss from the cabinet this secretary who was so far out\r\nof sympathy with the administration he was serving. He refused to do\r\nthis so long as Chase did his official duties well, and when Chase\r\noffered to resign he told him there was no need of it. But the citizens\r\nof Ohio, of which state Chase had in 1860 been the \"favorite son,\" did\r\nnot take the same view of the matter. Both legislature and mass\r\nmeetings demanded his resignation so emphatically that he could not\r\nrefuse. He did resign and was for a short time in private life. In\r\nDecember, 1864, Lincoln, in the full knowledge of the fact that during\r\nthe summer Chase had done his utmost to injure him, nominated him as\r\nchief justice, and from him received his oath of office at his second\r\ninaugural.\r\n\r\nThe search for a rival for Lincoln was more successful when Fremont was\r\nsolicited. He was nominated by a convention of extreme abolitionists\r\nthat met in the city of Cleveland. But it soon became apparent that his\r\nfollowing was insignificant, and he withdrew his name.\r\n\r\nThe regular republican convention was held in Baltimore, June 8, 1864.\r\nLincoln's name was presented, as in 1860, by the state of Illinois. On\r\nthe first ballot he received every vote except those from the state of\r\nMissouri. When this was done, the Missouri delegates changed their\r\nvotes and he was nominated unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn reply to congratulations, he said, \"I do not allow myself to suppose\r\nthat either the convention or the League have concluded to decide that\r\nI am either the greatest or best man in America, but rather that they\r\nhave concluded that it is not best to swap horses while crossing the\r\nriver, and have further concluded that I am not so poor a horse that\r\nthey might not make a botch of it trying to swap.\"\r\n\r\nThat homely figure of \"swapping horses while crossing the river\" caught\r\nthe attention of the country. It is doubtful if ever a campaign speech,\r\nor any series of campaign speeches, was so effective in winning and\r\nholding votes as that one phrase.\r\n\r\nBut, as has already been said, the prospects during the summer,--for\r\nthere was a period of five months from the nomination to the election,\r\n--were anything but cheering. At this crisis there developed a means of\r\nvigorous support which had not previously been estimated at its full\r\nvalue. In every loyal state there was a \"war governor.\" Upon these men\r\nthe burdens of the war had rested so heavily that they understood, as\r\nthey would not otherwise have understood, the superlative weight of\r\ncares that pressed on the President, and they saw more clearly than\r\nthey otherwise could have seen, the danger in swapping horses while\r\ncrossing the river. These war governors rallied with unanimity and with\r\ngreat earnestness to the support of the President. Other willing\r\nhelpers were used. The plain people, as well as the leading patriots,\r\nrallied to the support of the President.\r\n\r\nThe democrats nominated McClellan on the general theory that the war\r\nwas a failure. As election day approached, the increased vigor with\r\nwhich the war was prosecuted made it look less like a failure, even\r\nthough success was not in sight. The result of the election was what in\r\nlater days would be called a landslide. There were two hundred and\r\nthirty-three electors. Of this number two hundred and twelve were for\r\nLincoln. The loyal North was back of him. He might now confidently gird\r\nhimself for finishing the work.\r\n\r\nSuch was his kindliness of spirit that he was not unduly elated by\r\nsuccess, and never, either in trial or achievement, did he become\r\nvindictive or revengeful. After the election he was serenaded, and in\r\nacknowledgment he made a little speech. Among other things he said,\r\n\"Now that the election is over, may not all, having a common interest,\r\nreunite in a common effort to save our common country? For my own part,\r\nI have striven, and will strive, to place no obstacle in the way. So\r\nlong as I have been here _I have not willingly planted a thorn in any\r\nman's bosom_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the year 1864 wore towards its close, military events manifestly\r\napproached a climax. In 1861 the two armies were comparatively green.\r\nFor obvious reasons the advantage was on the side of the South. The\r\nSouth had so long been in substantial control at Washington that they\r\nhad the majority of the generals, they had nearly all the arms and\r\nammunition, and, since they had planned the coming conflict, their\r\nmilitia were in the main in better condition. But matters were\r\ndifferent after three years. The armies on both sides were now composed\r\nof veterans, the generals had been tried and their value was known. Not\r\nleast of all, Washington, while by no means free from spies, was not so\r\ncompletely overrun with them as at the first. At the beginning the\r\ndepartments were simply full of spies, and every movement of the\r\ngovernment was promptly reported to the authorities at Richmond. Three\r\nand a half years had sufficed to weed out most of these.\r\n\r\nIn that period a splendid navy had been constructed. The Mississippi\r\nRiver was open from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Every southern\r\nport was more or less successfully blockaded, and the power of the\r\ngovernment in this was every month growing stronger.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the available population of the North had\r\nincreased. The figures which Lincoln gave prove this. The loyal states\r\nof the North gave in 1860 a sum total of 3,870,222 votes. The same\r\nstates in 1864 gave a total of 3,982,011. That gave an excess of voters\r\nto the number of 111,789. To this should be added the number of all the\r\nsoldiers in the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\nDelaware, Indiana, Illinois, and California, who by the laws of those\r\nstates could not vote away from their homes, and which number could not\r\nhave been less than 90,000. Then there were two new states, Kansas and\r\nNevada, that had cast 33,762 votes. This leaves an increase for the\r\nNorth of 234,551 votes. It is plain that the North was not becoming\r\nexhausted of men.\r\n\r\nNor had the manufactures of the North decreased. The manufacture of\r\narms and all the munitions of war was continually improving, and other\r\nindustrial interests were flourishing. There was indeed much poverty\r\nand great suffering. The financial problem was one of the most serious\r\nof all, but in all these the South was suffering more than the North.\r\nOn the southern side matters were growing desperate. The factor of time\r\nnow counted against them, for, except in military discipline, they were\r\nnot improving with the passing years. There was little hope of foreign\r\nintervention, there was not much hope of a counter uprising in the\r\nNorth. It is now generally accepted as a certainty that, if the\r\nConfederate government had published the truth concerning the progress\r\nof the war, especially of such battles as Chattanooga, the southern\r\npeople would have recognized the hopelessness of their cause and the\r\nwickedness of additional slaughter, and the war would have terminated\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth volume of the History by Nicolay and Hay there is a\r\nsuccession of chapters of which the headings alone tell the glad story\r\nof progress. These headings are: \"Arkansas Free,\" \"Louisiana Free,\"\r\n\"Tennessee Free,\" \"Maryland Free,\" and \"Missouri Free.\"\r\n\r\nIn August Admiral Farragut had captured Mobile. General Grant with his\r\nveterans was face to face with General Lee and his veterans in\r\nVirginia. General Sherman with his splendid army had in the early fall\r\nstruck through the territory of the Southern Confederacy and on\r\nChristmas day had captured Savannah. The following letter from the\r\nPresident again shows his friendliness towards his generals:\r\n\r\n   \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n  WASHINGTON, December 26, 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL SHERMAN:\r\n\r\nMany, many thanks for your Christmas gift, the capture of Savannah.\r\n\r\nWhen you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic, I was anxious, if\r\nnot fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and\r\nremembering that 'nothing risked, nothing gained,' I did not interfere.\r\nNow, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I\r\nbelieve none of us went further than to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nAnd taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be\r\ntaken, it is indeed a great success. Not only does it afford the\r\nobvious and immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world\r\nthat your army could be divided, putting the stronger part to an\r\nimportant new service, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old\r\nopposing force of the whole,--Hood's army,--it brings those who sat in\r\ndarkness to see a great light. But what next?\r\n\r\nI suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nPlease make my grateful acknowledgment to your whole army--officers and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n   A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal thing now to be done was the destruction of the\r\nConfederate army or armies in Virginia. That and that only could end\r\nthe war. The sooner it should be done the better. Grant's spirit cannot\r\nin a hundred pages be better expressed than in his own epigram,--\"I\r\npropose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" It did\r\ntake all summer and all winter too, for the Confederates as well as the\r\nFederals had grown to be good fighters, and they were no cowards. They,\r\ntoo, were now acting on the defensive and were able to take advantage\r\nof swamp, hill, and river. This was an important factor. Grant had\r\nindeed captured two armies and destroyed one, but this was different.\r\n\r\nIt needed not an experienced eye or a military training to see that\r\nthis could only be done at a costly sacrifice of life. But let it be\r\nremembered that the three years of no progress had also been at a\r\ncostly sacrifice of life. The deadly malaria of Virginia swamps was\r\nquite as dangerous as a bullet or bayonet. Thousands upon thousands of\r\nsoldiers were taken to hospital cursing in their wrath: \"If I could\r\nonly have been shot on the field of battle, there would have been some\r\nglory in it. But to die of drinking the swamp water--this is awful!\"\r\nThe sacrifice of life under Grant was appalling, but it was not greater\r\nthan the other sort of sacrifice had been. What is more, it\r\naccomplished its purpose. Inch by inch he fought his way through many\r\nbloody months to the evacuation of Richmond and the surrender of Lee's\r\narmy at Appomattox, April 9, 1865. Then the war was over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grant's Campaign around Richmond.]\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of the President were not limited to his own friends or\r\nhis own army. The author is permitted to narrate the following\r\nincident--doubtless there were many others like it--which is given by\r\nan eye-witness, the Reverend Lysander Dickerman, D.D., of New York\r\nCity:\r\n\r\nIt was at Hatcher's Run on the last Sunday before the close of the war.\r\nA detachment of Confederate prisoners, possibly two thousand in all,\r\nhad just been brought in. They were in rags, starved, sick, and\r\naltogether as wretched a sight as one would be willing to see in a\r\nlifetime. A train of cars was standing on the siding. The President\r\ncame out of a car and stood on the platform. As he gazed at the\r\npitiable sufferers, he said not a word, but his breast heaved with\r\nemotion, his frame quivered. The tears streamed down his cheeks and he\r\nraised his arm (\"I don't suppose,\" commented the Doctor, \"he had a\r\nhandkerchief\") and with his sleeve wiped away the tears. Then he\r\nsilently turned, reentered the car which but for him was empty, sat\r\ndown on the further side, buried his face in his hands, and wept. That\r\nis the picture of the man Lincoln. Little did the Southerners suspect,\r\nas they in turn cursed and maligned that great and tender man, what a\r\nnoble friend they really had in him.\r\n\r\nAs the end came in sight an awkward question arose, What shall we do\r\nwith Jeff Davis--if we catch him? This reminded the President of a\r\nlittle story. \"I told Grant,\" he said, \"the story of an Irishman who\r\nhad taken Father Matthew's pledge. Soon thereafter, becoming very\r\nthirsty, he slipped into a saloon and applied for a lemonade, and\r\nwhilst it was being mixed he whispered to the bartender, 'Av ye could\r\ndrap a bit o' brandy in it, all unbeknown to myself, I'd make no fuss\r\nabout it.' My notion was that if Grant could let Jeff Davis escape all\r\nunbeknown to himself, he was to let him go. I didn't want him.\"\r\nSubsequent events proved the sterling wisdom of this suggestion, for\r\nthe country had no use for Jeff Davis when he was caught.\r\n\r\nLate in March, 1865, the President decided to take a short vacation,\r\nsaid to be the first he had had since entering the White House in 1861.\r\nWith a few friends he went to City Point on the James River, where\r\nGrant had his headquarters. General Sherman came up for a conference.\r\nThe two generals were confident that the end of the war was near, but\r\nthey were also certain that there must be at least one more great\r\nbattle. \"Avoid this if possible,\" said the President. \"No more\r\nbloodshed, no more bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second day of April both Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated.\r\nThe President was determined to see Richmond and started under the care\r\nof Admiral Porter. The river was tortuous and all knew that the channel\r\nwas full of obstructions so that they had the sensation of being in\r\nsuspense as to the danger of torpedoes and other devices. Admiral\r\nFarragut who was in Richmond came down the river on the same day, April\r\n4th, to meet the presidential party. An accident happened to his boat\r\nand it swung across the channel and there stuck fast, completely\r\nobstructing the channel, and rendering progress in either direction\r\nimpossible. The members of the presidential party were impatient and\r\ndecided to proceed as best they could. They were transferred to the\r\nAdmiral's barge and towed up the river to their destination.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of that triumphal entry into Richmond was entirely moral,\r\nnot in the least spectacular. There were no triumphal arches, no\r\nmartial music, no applauding multitudes, no vast cohorts with flying\r\nbanners and glittering arms. Only a few American citizens, in plain\r\nclothes, on foot, escorted by ten marines. The central figure was that\r\nof a man remarkably tall, homely, ill-dressed, but with a countenance\r\nradiating joy and good-will. It was only thirty-six hours since\r\nJefferson Davis had fled, having set fire to the city, and the fire was\r\nstill burning. There was no magnificent civic welcome to the modest\r\nparty, but there was a spectacle more significant. It was the large\r\nnumber of negroes, crowding, kneeling, praying, shouting \"Bress de\r\nLawd!\" Their emancipator, their Moses, their Messiah, had come in\r\nperson. To them it was the beginning of the millennium. A few poor\r\nwhites added their welcome, such as it was, and that was all. But all\r\nknew that \"Babylon had fallen,\" and they realized the import of that\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nJohnston did not surrender to Sherman until April 26th, but Lee had\r\nsurrendered on the 9th, and it was conceded that it was a matter of but\r\na few days when the rest also would surrender. On Good Friday, April\r\n14th,--a day glorious in its beginning, tragic at its close,--the\r\nnewspapers throughout the North published an order of the Secretary of\r\nWar stopping the draft and the purchase of arms and munitions of war.\r\nThe government had decreed that at twelve o'clock noon of that day the\r\nstars and stripes should be raised above Fort Sumter. The chaplain was\r\nthe Reverend Matthias Harris who had officiated at the raising of the\r\nflag over that fort in 1860. The reading of the psalter was conducted\r\nby the Reverend Dr. Storrs of Brooklyn. The orator of the occasion was\r\nthe eloquent Henry Ward Beecher. And the flag was raised by Major (now\r\nGeneral) Anderson, whose staunch loyalty and heroic defense has linked\r\nhis name inseparably with Sumter.\r\n\r\nThe war was over and Lincoln at once turned his attention to the duties\r\nof reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWard H. Lamon asserts that there was no day, from the morning Lincoln\r\nleft Springfield to the night of his assassination, when his life was\r\nnot in serious peril. If we make generous allowance for the fears which\r\nhad their root in Lamon's devoted love for his chief, and for that\r\nnatural desire to magnify his office--for his special charge was to\r\nguard the President from bodily harm--which would incline him to\r\nestimate trifles seriously, we are still compelled to believe that the\r\nlife was in frequent, if not continual, danger. There are, and always\r\nhave been, men whose ambition is in the direction of a startling crime.\r\nThere were not less than three known attempts on the life of Lincoln\r\nbetween Springfield and Washington. There may have been others that are\r\nnot known. If any one was in a position to know of real and probable\r\nplots against the President's life, it was Lamon. It was he, too, who\r\nshowed the greatest concern upon the subject, though he was personally\r\na man of unlimited courage.\r\n\r\nAn event occurred early in 1862, which we here transcribe, not merely\r\nbecause of its intrinsic interest, but especially because it hints of\r\ndangers not known to the public. Lincoln was at this time residing at\r\nthe Soldier's Home and was accustomed to riding alone to and from this\r\nplace. His friends could not prevail on him to accept an escort, though\r\nthey were in daily fear of kidnapping or murder. Lamon narrates the\r\noccurrence substantially (in the President's words) as follows: One day\r\nhe rode up to the White House steps, where the Colonel met him, and\r\nwith his face full of fun, he said, \"I have something to tell you.\" The\r\ntwo entered the office, where the President locked the door and\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\"You know I have always told you I thought you an _idiot_ that ought to\r\nbe put in a strait jacket for your apprehensions of my personal danger\r\nfrom assassination. You also know that the way we skulked into this\r\ncity in the first place has been a source of shame and regret to me,\r\nfor it did look so cowardly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't now propose to make you my father-confessor and\r\nacknowledge a change of heart, yet I am free to admit that just now I\r\ndon't know what to think: I am staggered. Understand me, I do not want\r\nto oppose my pride of opinion against light and reason, but I am in\r\nsuch a state of 'betweenity' in my conclusions, that I can't say that\r\nthe judgment of _this court_ is prepared to proclaim a decision upon\r\nthe facts presented.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Last night about eleven o'clock, I went to the Soldiers' Home alone,\r\nriding _Old Abe_, as you call him; and when I arrived at the foot of\r\nthe hill on the road leading to the entrance to the Home grounds, I was\r\njogging along at a slow gait, immersed in deep thought, when suddenly I\r\nwas aroused--I may say the arousement lifted me out of my saddle as\r\nwell as out of my wits--by the report of a rifle, and seemingly the\r\ngunner was not fifty yards from where my contemplations ended and my\r\naccelerated transit began. My erratic namesake, with little warning,\r\ngave proof of decided dissatisfaction at the racket, and with one\r\nreckless bound he unceremoniously separated me from my eight-dollar\r\nplug hat, with which I parted company without any assent, express or\r\nimplied, upon my part. At a break-neck speed we soon arrived in a haven\r\nof safety. Meanwhile I was left in doubt whether death was more\r\ndesirable from being thrown from a runaway Federal horse, or as the\r\ntragic result of a rifle-ball fired by a disloyal bushwhacker in the\r\nmiddle of the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you there is no time on record equal to that made by the two\r\nOld Abes on that occasion. The historic ride of John Gilpin, and Henry\r\nWilson's memorable display of bareback equestrianship on the stray army\r\nmule from the scenes of the battle of Bull Run, a year ago, are nothing\r\nin comparison to mine, either in point of time made or in ludicrous\r\npageantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"No good can result at this time from giving [this occurrence]\r\npublicity. It does seem to me that I am in more danger from the\r\naugmentation of an imaginary peril than from a judicious silence, be\r\nthe danger ever so great; and, moreover, I do not want it understood\r\nthat I share your apprehensions. I never have.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one takes into account the number of Lincoln's bitter enemies, and\r\nthe desperate character of some of them, the wonder is that he was not\r\nshot sooner. There were multitudes of ruffians in Washington City and\r\nelsewhere, who had murder in their hearts and plenty of deadly weapons\r\nwithin reach. Yet Lincoln lived on for four years, and was reluctant to\r\naccept even a nominal body guard. The striking parallel between him and\r\nWilliam the Silent will at once occur to the reader. He, like Lincoln,\r\nwould take no precaution. He exposed himself freely, and there were\r\nplots almost innumerable against his life before he was slain. Such\r\npersons seem to have invisible defenders.\r\n\r\nLincoln was not a fatalist, but he did believe that he would live to\r\ncomplete his specific work and that he would not live beyond that.\r\nPerhaps he was wise in this. Had he surrounded himself with pomp and\r\ndefense after the manner of Fremont he could not have done his work at\r\nall, for his special calling required that he should keep near to the\r\npeople, and not isolate himself. Moreover, it is a question whether an\r\nelaborate show of defense would not have invited a correspondingly\r\nelaborate ingenuity in attack. His very trustfulness must have disarmed\r\nsome. The wonder is not that he was slain at last, but that under the\r\ncircumstances he was not slain earlier.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written, and perhaps justly, of Lincoln's presentiments.\r\nIt is not exceptional, it is common in all rural communities to\r\nmultiply and magnify signs. The commonest occurrences are invested with\r\nan occult meaning. Seeing the new moon over the right shoulder or over\r\nthe left shoulder, the howling of a dog at night, the chance assemblage\r\nof thirteen persons, the spilling of salt,--these and a thousand other\r\nthings are taken to be signs of something. The habit of attending to\r\nthese things probably originates in mere amusements. It takes the\r\nplace, or furnishes the material, of small talk. But years of attention\r\nto these things, especially in the susceptible period of childhood and\r\nyouth, are almost certain to have a lasting effect. A person gets into\r\nthe habit of noting them, of looking for them, and the influence\r\nbecomes ingrained in his very nature so that it is next to impossible\r\nto shake it off. This condition is a feature of all rural communities,\r\nnot only in the West, but in New England: in fact, in Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, and Australia.\r\n\r\nLincoln shared the impressibility of the community in which he grew up;\r\nno more, no less. Like all the rest, indeed, like all of mankind, he\r\ncounted the hits, not the misses. Being unusually outspoken, he often\r\ntold of impressions which another would not have mentioned. The very\r\ntelling of them magnified their importance. He had been having\r\npremonitions all his life, and it would be strange if he did not have\r\nsome just before his death. He did, and these are the ones that are\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all, he was in excellent spirits on Good Friday, April 14,\r\n1865. The burdens and sorrows of bloodshed had made an old man of him.\r\nBut the war was at an end, the stars and stripes were floating over\r\nSumter, the Union was saved, and slavery was doomed. There came back\r\ninto his eyes the light that had long been absent. Those who were about\r\nhim said the elasticity of his movements and joyousness of his manner\r\nwere marked. \"His mood all day was singularly happy and tender.\"\r\n\r\nThe events of the day were simple. It was the day of the regular\r\nmeeting of the cabinet. Grant, who had arrived in Washington that\r\nmorning, attended this meeting. It was the President's idea that the\r\nleaders of the Confederacy should be allowed to escape,--much as he had\r\nalready jocularly advised Grant to let Jeff Davis escape \"all unbeknown\r\nto himself.\" He spoke plainly on the subject. \"No one need expect me to\r\ntake any part in hanging or killing these men, even the worst of them.\r\nEnough lives have been sacrificed.\" After the discussion of various\r\nmatters, when the cabinet adjourned until the following Tuesday, the\r\nlast words he ever uttered to them were that \"they must now begin to\r\nact in the interests of peace.\"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he went for a drive with Mrs. Lincoln. The\r\nconversation embraced plans of living--in Chicago? or California?--\r\nafter the expiration of his term of office. This fact shows that his\r\npresentments did not make so real an impression on him as many people\r\nhave believed.\r\n\r\nThree days before this his devoted servant Colonel Lamon--we might\r\nalmost call him his faithful watch-dog, so loving, loyal, and watchful\r\nwas he--had gone on an errand for him to Richmond. Lamon, who was loath\r\nto start, tried to secure from him a promise in advance of divulging\r\nwhat it was to be. Lincoln, after much urging, said he thought he would\r\nventure to make the promise. It was that he would promise not to go out\r\nafter night in Lamon's absence, and _particularly to the theater_\r\n(italics Lamon's). The President first joked about it, but being\r\npersistently entreated said at last: \"Well, I promise to do the best I\r\ncan towards it.\"\r\n\r\nBut for the evening of the day under consideration, Mrs. Lincoln had\r\ngot up a theater party--her husband was always fond of the diversion\r\nof the theater. The party was to include General and Mrs. Grant. But\r\nthe general's plans required him to go that evening to Philadelphia,\r\nand so Major Rathbone and Miss Harris were substituted. This party\r\noccupied the upper proscenium box on the right of the stage.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock, J. Wilkes Booth, a young actor twenty-six years of\r\nage, and very handsome, glided along the corridor towards that box.\r\nBeing himself an actor and well known by the employees of the theater,\r\nhe was suffered to proceed without hindrance. Passing through the\r\ncorridor door he fastened it shut by means of a bar that fitted into a\r\nniche previously prepared, and making an effectual barricade. A hole\r\nhad been bored through the door leading into the box so that he could\r\nsurvey the inmates without attracting their attention. With revolver in\r\none hand and dagger in the other he noiselessly entered the box and\r\nstood directly behind the President who was enjoying the humor of the\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\n\"The awful tragedy in the box makes everything else seem pale and\r\nunreal. Here were five human beings in a narrow space--the greatest man\r\nof his time, in the glory of the most stupendous success in our\r\nhistory, the idolized chief of a nation already mighty, with\r\nillimitable vistas of grandeur to come; his beloved wife, proud and\r\nhappy; a pair of betrothed lovers, with all the promise of felicity\r\nthat youth, social position, and wealth could give them; and this young\r\nactor, handsome as Endymion upon Latmos, the pet of his little world.\r\nThe glitter of fame, happiness, and ease was upon the entire group, but\r\nin an instant everything was to be changed with the blinding swiftness\r\nof enchantment. Quick death was to come on the central figure of that\r\ncompany--the central figure, we believe, of the great and good men of\r\nthe century. Over all the rest the blackest fates hovered menacingly--\r\nfates from which a mother might pray that kindly death would save her\r\nchildren in their infancy. One was to wander with the stain of murder\r\non his soul, with the curses of a world upon his name, with a price set\r\nupon his head, in frightful physical pain, till he died a dog's death\r\nin a burning barn; the stricken wife was to pass the rest of her days\r\nin melancholy and madness; of those two young lovers, one was to slay\r\nthe other, and then end his life a raving maniac\" (Nicolay and Hay, X.\r\n295).\r\n\r\nThe revolver was thrust near to the back of the head of the\r\nunsuspecting victim--that kind man who had \"never willingly planted a\r\nthorn in any man's bosom,\" who could not bear to witness suffering even\r\nin an animal. The report of the pistol was somewhat muffled and was\r\nunnoticed by the majority of the audience. The ball penetrated the\r\nPresident's brain, and without word or sound his head dropped upon his\r\nbreast. Major Rathbone took in the situation and sprang at the murderer\r\nwho slashed him savagely with the dagger, tore himself free, and leaped\r\nover the balustrade upon the stage. It was not a high leap for an\r\nathletic young man, but his spur caught in a flag with which the box\r\nwas draped, so that he did not strike quite squarely on his feet. The\r\nresult was that he broke his leg or ankle. But gathering himself up, he\r\nflourished his dagger, declaiming the motto of Virginia, _Sic semper\r\nTyrannis_ (Thus ever to tyrants), and before the audience could realize\r\nwhat was done, he disappeared. He ran out of the rear of the theater\r\nwhere a fleet horse was in waiting. He mounted and rode for his life.\r\nFor eleven days he was in hiding, with the curse of Cain upon him,\r\nsuffering all the while excruciating agonies from his broken leg, which\r\ncould be but imperfectly cared for. He was finally corralled in a barn,\r\nthe barn was set on fire, and while thus at bay he was shot down.\r\n\r\nAid came at once to the President, but the surgeons saw at a glance\r\nthat the wound was mortal. They carried him out into the open air. When\r\nthey reached the street the question arose, Where shall we take him? On\r\nthe opposite side of the street was an unpretentious hotel. A man,\r\nstanding on the front steps, saw the commotion and asked what it meant.\r\nOn being told, he said, \"Take him to my room.\" It was thus that the\r\ngreatest man of the age died in a small room of a common hotel. But\r\nthis was not unfitting; he was of the plain people, he always loved\r\nthem, and among them he closed his earthly record. He lingered\r\nunconscious through the night, and at twenty minutes after seven\r\no'clock, on the morning of April 15th, he died.\r\n\r\nThe band of assassins of which Booth was the head, planned to murder\r\nalso other officials. Grant escaped, having suddenly left the city. The\r\nonly other person who was actually attacked was Seward. Though the\r\nassassin was a giant in stature and in strength, though he fought like\r\na madman, and though Seward was at the time in bed with his right arm\r\nand jaw fractured, he having been thrown from a horse, yet strangely\r\nenough he was not killed. The assassin inflicted many and terrible\r\nwounds, especially upon Frederick Seward, his son, who did not regain\r\nconsciousness for weeks; but no one in that house was killed.\r\n\r\nSurely never did the telegraph hear heavier news than when it flashed\r\nthe message, \"Lincoln has been assassinated.\" More than one ex-\r\nConfederate stoutly declared that \"when Lincoln was murdered the South\r\nlost its best friend.\" And thousands of others replied, that was the\r\ntruth! At the dedication of his monument in 1874 General Grant gave\r\nutterance again to this thought: \"In his death the nation lost its\r\ngreatest hero; in his death the South lost its most just friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nA NATION'S SORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outburst of sorrow and indignation over the foul murder of the\r\nPresident was so great as to lead people to assume that Lincoln was at\r\nall times and universally a favorite. Those who know better have\r\nsometimes thought it discreet to preserve silence. But the greatness of\r\nhis work cannot be appreciated at its full value unless one bears in\r\nmind that he had not the full measure of sympathy and a reasonable help\r\nfrom those on whom he had a right to depend. During the four years that\r\nhe was in Washington he was indeed surrounded by a band of devoted\r\nfollowers. But these people were few in numbers. Those who sympathized\r\nwith Fremont, or McClellan, or Greeley, plus those who were against\r\nLincoln on general principles, constituted a large majority of the\r\npeople who ought to have sustained him. All of these factions, or\r\ncoteries, however much they differed among themselves, agreed in\r\nhampering Lincoln. For one person Lincoln was too radical, for another\r\ntoo conservative, but both joined hands to annoy him.\r\n\r\nMuch of this annoyance was thoughtless. The critics were conscientious,\r\nthey sincerely believed that their plans were the best. They failed to\r\ngrasp the fact that the end desired might possibly be better reached by\r\nother methods than their own. But on the other hand much of this\r\nannoyance was malicious.\r\n\r\nWhen the shock of the murder came, there was a great revulsion of\r\nfeeling. The thoughtless were made thoughtful, the malicious were\r\nbrought to their senses. Neither class had realized into what\r\ndiabolical hands they were playing by their opposition to the\r\nadministration. It was the greatness of the sorrow of the people--the\r\nplain people whom he had always loved and who always loved him--that\r\nsobered the contentions. Even this was not fully accomplished at once.\r\nThere is documentary evidence to show that the extreme radicals,\r\nrepresented by such men as George W. Julian, of Indiana, considered\r\nthat the death of Lincoln removed an obstruction to the proper\r\ngoverning of the country. Julian's words (in part) are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I spent most of the afternoon [April 15, 1864, the day of Lincoln's\r\ndeath] in a political caucus held for the purpose of considering the\r\nnecessity for a new Cabinet and a line of policy less conciliating than\r\nthat of Mr. Lincoln; and while everybody was shocked at his murder, the\r\nfeeling was nearly universal that the accession of Johnson to the\r\npresidency would prove a godsend to the country.... On the following\r\nday, in pursuance of a previous engagement, the Committee on the\r\nConduct of the War met the President at his quarters at the Treasury\r\nDepartment. He received us with decided cordiality, and Mr. Wade said\r\nto him: 'Johnson, we have faith in you. There will be no trouble now in\r\nrunning the government.'... While we were rejoiced that the leading\r\nconservatives of the country were not in Washington, we felt that the\r\npresence and influence of the committee, of which Johnson had been a\r\nmember, would aid the Administration in getting on the right track....\r\nThe general feeling was ... that he would act on the advice of General\r\nButler by inaugurating a policy of his own, instead of administering on\r\nthe political estate of his predecessor.\" (Julian, \"Political\r\nRecollections,\" p. 255, ff.).\r\n\r\nThe names of the patriots who attended this caucus on the day of\r\nLincoln's death, are not given. It is not necessary to know them. It is\r\nnot probable that there were many exhibitions of this spirit after the\r\ndeath of the President. This one, which is here recorded in the words\r\nof the confession of one of the chief actors, is an exception. But\r\n_before_ the death of Lincoln, this spirit of fault-finding,\r\nobstruction, hostility, was not uncommon and was painfully aggressive.\r\n_After_ his death there was a revulsion of feeling. Many who had failed\r\nto give the cheer, sympathy, and encouragement which they might have\r\ngiven in life, shed bitter and unavailing tears over his death.\r\n\r\nOn the other, the Confederate, side, it is significant that during the\r\nten days the murderer was in hiding, no southern sympathizer whom he\r\nmet wished to arrest him or have him arrested, although a large reward\r\nhad been offered for his apprehension. As to the head of the\r\nConfederacy, Jeff Davis, there is no reasonable doubt that he approved\r\nthe act and motive of Booth, whether he had given him a definite\r\ncommission or not. Davis tried to defend himself by saying that he had\r\ngreater objection to Johnson than to Lincoln. But since the conspiracy\r\nincluded the murder of both Lincoln and Johnson, as well as others,\r\nthis defense is very lame. It was certainly more than a coincidence\r\nthat Booth--a poor man who had plenty of ready money--and Jacob\r\nThompson, the Confederate agent in Canada, had dealings with the same\r\nbank in Montreal. Davis himself said, \"For an enemy so relentless, in\r\nthe war for our subjugation, I could not be expected to mourn.\"\r\n\r\nTo put it in the mildest form, neither Jeff Davis in the South, nor the\r\nextreme radicals in the North, were sorry that Lincoln was out of the\r\nway. Extremes had met in the feeling of relief that the late President\r\nwas now out of the way. This brings to mind a statement in an ancient\r\nbook which records that \"Herod and Pilate became friends with each\r\nother that very day; for before they were at enmity between\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening there had been general rejoicing throughout the loyal\r\nNorth. On Saturday morning there rose to heaven a great cry of\r\ndistress,--such a cry as has hardly been paralleled since the\r\ndestruction of the first-born in Egypt. For the telegraph--invented\r\nsince Lincoln had come into manhood--had carried the heavy news to\r\nevery city and commercial center in the North. The shock plunged the\r\nwhole community, in the twinkling of an eye, from the heights of\r\nexultation into the abyss of grief.\r\n\r\nThere was no business transacted that day. The whole nation was given\r\nup to grief. Offices, stores, exchanges were deserted. Men gathered in\r\nknots and conversed in low tones. By twelve o'clock noon there was\r\nscarcely a public building, store, or residence in any northern city\r\nthat was not draped in mourning. The poor also procured bits of black\r\ncrepe, or some substitute for it, and tied them to their door-knobs.\r\nThe plain people were orphaned. \"Father Abraham\" was dead.\r\n\r\nHere and there some southern sympathizer ventured to express\r\nexultation,--a very rash thing to do. Forbearance had ceased to be a\r\nvirtue, and in nearly every such case the crowd organized a lynching\r\nbee in the fraction of a minute, and the offender was thankful to\r\nescape alive.\r\n\r\nThough this wave of sorrow swept over the land from ocean to ocean, it\r\nwas necessarily more manifest in Washington than elsewhere. There the\r\ncrime had been committed. There the President's figure was a familiar\r\nsight and his voice was a familiar sound. There the tragedy was nearer\r\nat hand and more vivid. In the middle of the morning a squad of\r\nsoldiers bore the lifeless body to the White House. It lay there in\r\nstate until the day of the funeral, Wednesday. It is safe to say that\r\non the intervening Sunday there was hardly a pulpit in the North, from\r\nwhich, by sermon and prayer, were not expressed the love of the chief.\r\nOn Wednesday, the day of the funeral in Washington, all the churches in\r\nthe land were invited to join in solemnizing the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe funeral service was held in the East room of the White House,\r\nconducted by the President's pastor Dr. Gurley, and his eloquent\r\nfriend, Bishop Simpson of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nprostrated by the shock, was unable to be present, and little Tad would\r\nnot come. Only Robert, a recent graduate of Harvard and at the time a\r\nmember of Grant's staff, was there to represent the family.\r\n\r\nAfter the service, which was brief and simple, the body was borne with\r\nsuitable pomp and magnificence, the procession fittingly headed by\r\nnegro troops, to the Capitol, where it was placed in the rotunda until\r\nthe evening of the next day. There, as at the White House, innumerable\r\ncrowds passed to look upon that grave, sad, kindly face. The negroes\r\ncame in great numbers, sobbing out their grief over the death of their\r\nEmancipator. The soldiers, too, who remembered so well his oft repeated\r\n\"God bless you, boys!\" were not ashamed of their grief. There were also\r\nneighbors, friends, and the general public.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the cortege should return to Springfield over as\r\nnearly as possible the same route as that taken by the President in\r\n1861,--Baltimore, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, New York, Albany,\r\nCleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, and Chicago. In the party there were\r\nthree of those who had escorted him to Washington,--David Davis, W. H.\r\nLamon, and General Hunter.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock on Friday, April 21st, the funeral train left\r\nWashington. It is hardly too much to say that it was a funeral\r\nprocession two thousand miles in length. All along the route people\r\nturned out, not daunted by darkness and rain--for it rained much of the\r\ntime--and stood with streaming eyes to watch the train go by. At the\r\nlarger cities named, the procession paused and the body lay for some\r\nhours in state while the people came in crowds so great that it seemed\r\nas if the whole community had turned out. At Columbus and Indianapolis\r\nthose in charge said that it seemed as if the entire population of the\r\nstate came to do him honor. The present writer has never witnessed\r\nanother sight so imposing.\r\n\r\nNaturally the ceremonies were most elaborate in New York City. But at\r\nChicago the grief was most unrestrained and touching. He was there\r\namong his neighbors and friends. It was the state of Illinois that had\r\ngiven him to the nation and the world. They had the claim of fellow-\r\ncitizenship, he was one of them. As a citizen of the state of which\r\nChicago was the leading city, he had passed all his public life. The\r\nneighboring states sent thousands of citizens, for he was a western man\r\nlike themselves, and for the forty-eight hours that he lay in state a\r\ncontinuous stream of all sorts and conditions of men passed by\r\nsorrowing.\r\n\r\nIn all these cities not a few mottoes were displayed. Most of these\r\nwere from his own writings, such as, \"With malice toward none, with\r\ncharity for all;\" and, \"We here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain.\" Two others are firmly fixed in the mind of the\r\nwriter which are here given as a sample of all. The first is from the\r\nBible: \"He being dead yet speaketh.\" The second is from Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n  \"His life was gentle, and the elements\r\n  So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up\r\n  And say to all the world, This was a man!\"\r\n\r\nHis final resting-place was Springfield. Here, and in all the\r\nneighboring country, he was known to every one. He had always a kind\r\nword for every one, and now all this came back in memory. His goodness\r\nhad not been forgotten. Those whom he had befriended had delighted to\r\ntell of it. They therefore came to do honor not merely to the great\r\nstatesman, but to the beloved friend, the warm-hearted neighbor. Many\r\ncould remember his grave face as he stood on the platform of the car\r\nthat rainy morning in February, 1861, and said, \"I now leave, not\r\nknowing when or whether ever I shall return.\" Between the two days,\r\nwhat a large and noble life had been lived.\r\n\r\nThe city had made elaborate preparations for the final services. The\r\nfuneral in Springfield was on May 4th. The order of service included a\r\ndirge, a prayer, the reading of his second inaugural address, and an\r\noration. The latter was by Bishop Simpson and was worthy of the noble\r\nand eloquent orator. It was a beautiful day, the rain which had been\r\nfalling during the long journey was over, and May sunshine filled earth\r\nand sky. Near the close of the day the body of the President, together\r\nwith that of his little son Willie, which also had been brought from\r\nWashington, was laid in a vault in Oak Ridge cemetery.\r\n\r\nA movement was at once set on foot to erect a suitable monument. For\r\nthis purpose a few large sums of money were subscribed, but most of it\r\ncame in small sums from the plain people. The negro troops contributed\r\n$8,000. The sum of $180,000 in all was raised and a noble structure was\r\nerected. It was dedicated in 1874. The orator of the day was his old-\r\ntime friend, Governor, afterwards General, Oglesby. Warm words of\r\nappreciation were added by Generals Grant and Sherman. The former, who\r\nserved under him as general and for two terms succeeded him in office,\r\namong other things said, \"To know him personally was to love and\r\nrespect him for his great qualities of heart and head, and for his\r\npatience and patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tomb of Abraham Lincoln at Springfield, Illinois.]\r\n\r\nLincoln was never a resident of Chicago, but he was always a favorite\r\nin that city, even though it was the home of his great rival, Judge\r\nDouglas. It was there he was nominated in 1860, and the city always\r\nfelt as if it had a personal claim on him. It has done itself honor by\r\nthe construction of Lincoln Park. The chief ornament is a bronze statue\r\nof heroic size, by the sculptor St. Gaudens. The statue represents\r\nLincoln in the attitude of speaking, and the legend, which is lettered\r\nat the base, is the sublime paragraph that concludes the second\r\ninaugural. The beauty of the park--lawn, flowers, shrubbery, trees--\r\nand the majesty of the statue, constitute a noble memorial of the man\r\nwhose name they perpetuate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE MEASURE OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n           \"God's plan\r\n  And measure of a stalwart man.\"--_Lowell_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's physical characteristics have been sufficiently described,--\r\nhis unmanageable height and his giant strength. His mental traits have\r\nbeen treated in chapter xxxv. We now consider his moral qualities, that\r\nis to say his character.\r\n\r\nConspicuous was his honesty. The sobriquet \"Honest Abe Lincoln,\" which\r\nhis neighbors fastened on him in his youth was never lost, shaken off,\r\nor outgrown. This was something more than the exactness of commercial\r\nhonesty which forbade him to touch a penny of the funds that remained\r\nover from the extinct post-office of New Salem, though the government\r\nwas for years negligent in the matter of settling up. In youth he\r\nalways insisted on fairness in sports so that he came to be the\r\nstanding umpire of the neighborhood. It came out also in his practise\r\nof the law, when he would not lend his influence to further scoundrel\r\nschemes, nor would he consent to take an unfair advantage of an\r\nopponent. But the glory of his honesty appeared in his administration.\r\nIt is a wonderful fact that there has never been any suspicion, even\r\namong his enemies, that he used the high powers of his office for gain,\r\nor for the furtherance of his political ambition. When contracts, to\r\nthe amount of many millions of dollars, were being constantly given out\r\nfor a period of four years, there was never a thought that a dishonest\r\ndollar would find its way, either directly or indirectly, into the\r\nhands of the President, or with his consent into the hands of his\r\nfriends. When he was a candidate for reelection he was fully aware that\r\nsome officials of high station were using their prerogatives for the\r\npurpose of injuring him. It was in his power to dismiss these in\r\ndisgrace,--and they deserved it. This he refused to do. So long as\r\nthey did well their official duties, he overlooked their injustice to\r\nhim. No President has surpassed him in the cleanness of his record, and\r\nonly Washington has equaled him.\r\n\r\nHis tenderness of heart over-rode almost everything. In childhood he\r\nwould not permit boys to put live coals on the back of a turtle. In\r\nyouth he stayed out all night with a drunkard to prevent his freezing\r\nto death, a fate which his folly had invited. In young manhood with the\r\nutmost gentleness he restored to their nest some birdlings that had\r\nbeen beaten out by the storm. When a lawyer on the circuit, be\r\ndismounted from his horse and rescued a pig that was stuck in the mud.\r\nThis spoiled a suit of clothes, because he had to lift the pig in his\r\narms. His explanation was that he could not bear to think of that\r\nanimal in suffering, and so he did it simply for his own peace of mind.\r\n\r\nBut when he became President, his tenderness of heart was as beautiful\r\nas the glow of the sunset. To him the boys in blue were as sons. On him\r\nas on no one else the burden of the nation's troubles rested. It may\r\nwith reverence be said that he \"bore our sorrows, he carried our\r\ngrief.\" Not only was this true in general, but in specific cases his\r\nactions showed it. When the soldiers were under sentence from court-\r\nmartial--many of them mere boys--the sentence came to Lincoln for\r\napproval. If he could find any excuse whatever for pardon he would\r\ngrant it. His tendency to pardon, his leaning towards the side of\r\nmercy, became proverbial and greatly annoyed some of the generals who\r\nfeared military discipline would be destroyed. But he would not turn a\r\ndeaf ear to the plea of mercy, and he could not see in it any permanent\r\ndanger to the republic. One or two examples will stand fairly for a\r\nlarge number. When a boy was sentenced to death for desertion, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, and not touch a\r\nhair of the wily agitator who induces him to desert? I think that in\r\nsuch a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy, is not only\r\nconstitutional, but withal a great mercy.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the war he pardoned a boy who was sentenced to be shot for\r\nsleeping at his post as sentinel. By way of explanation the President\r\nsaid: \"I could not think of going into eternity with the blood of that\r\npoor young man on my skirts. It is not to be wondered at that a boy,\r\nraised on a farm, probably in the habit of going to bed at dark,\r\nshould, when required to watch, fall asleep; and I cannot consent to\r\nshoot him for such an act.\" The sequel is romantic. The dead body of\r\nthis boy was found among the slain on the field of the battle of\r\nFredericksburg. Next his heart was a photograph of the President on\r\nwhich he had written \"God bless President Abraham Lincoln!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st day of November, 1864, he wrote to Mrs. Bixby, of Boston,\r\nMass., the following letter which needs no comment or explanation:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MADAM: I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a\r\nstatement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, that you are the\r\nmother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I\r\nfeel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should\r\nattempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I\r\ncannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found\r\nin the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our\r\nHeavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave\r\nyou only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn\r\npride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the\r\naltar of freedom.\r\n\r\n  Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,\r\n  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nA different side of his character is shown in the following incident. A\r\nslave-trader had been condemned, in Newburyport, Mass., to a fine of\r\none thousand dollars and imprisonment for five years. He served out his\r\nterm of imprisonment, but he could not pay his fine, because he had no\r\nmoney and no way of getting any. Consequently he was still held for the\r\nfine which he was unable to pay. Some people of influence interested\r\nthemselves in the case, and a congressman from eastern Massachusetts,\r\nwho stood very near to the President, laid the facts before him with\r\nthe request for a pardon. He was indeed much moved by the appeal, but\r\nhe gave his decision in substantially the following words: \"My friend,\r\nthis appeal is very touching to my feelings, and no one knows my\r\nweakness better than you. I am, if possible to be, too easily moved by\r\nappeals for mercy; and I must say that if this man had been guilty of\r\nthe foulest murder that the arm of man could perpetrate, I might\r\nforgive him on such an appeal. But the man who could go to Africa, and\r\nrob her of her children, and then sell them into interminable bondage,\r\nwith no other motive than that which is furnished by dollars and cents,\r\nis so much worse than the most depraved murderer that he can never\r\nreceive pardon at my hand. No, sir; he may stay in jail forever before\r\nhe shall have liberty by any act of mine.\"\r\n\r\nIt was his magnanimity that constructed his cabinet. Hardly another man\r\nin the world would have failed to dismiss summarily both Seward and\r\nChase. But, thanks to his magnanimous forbearance, Seward became not\r\nonly useful to the country, but devotedly loyal to his chief. After\r\nChase's voluntary retirement Lincoln appointed him Chief Justice. To\r\nhis credit be it said that he adorned the judiciary, but he never did\r\nappreciate the man who saved him from oblivion, not to say disgrace. Up\r\nto the year 1862, his only personal knowledge of Stanton was such as to\r\nrouse only memories of indignation, but when he believed that Stanton\r\nwould make a good Secretary of War he did not hesitate to appoint him.\r\nIt is safe to say that this appointment gave Stanton the greatest\r\nsurprise of his life.\r\n\r\nHe was always ready to set aside his preference, or to do the expedient\r\nthing when no moral principle was involved. When such a principle was\r\ninvolved he was ready to stand alone against the world. He was no\r\ncoward. In early youth he championed the cause of temperance in a\r\ncommunity where the use of liquors was almost universal. In the\r\nIllinois legislature and in congress he expressed his repugnance to the\r\nwhole institution of slavery, though this expression could do him no\r\npossible good, while it might do him harm. When, he was a lawyer, he\r\nwas almost the only lawyer of ability who did not dread the odium sure\r\nto attach to those who befriended negroes.\r\n\r\nWhen in the White House, he stood out almost alone against the clamors\r\nof his constituents and directed the release of Mason and Slidell.\r\n\r\nPersonally he was a clean man. The masculine vices were abhorrent to\r\nhim. He was not profane. He was not vulgar. He was as far removed from\r\nsuspicion as Caesar could have demanded of his wife. He was not given\r\nto drink. When a young man he could not be tricked into swallowing\r\nwhisky. At the close of the war, a barrel of whisky was sent him from\r\nsome cellar in Richmond, as a souvenir of the fall of the city, but he\r\ndeclined to receive it. Wine was served at the table of the White House\r\nin deference to foreign guests who did not know, and could not be\r\ntaught, how to dine without it. As a matter of courtesy he went through\r\nthe form of touching the glass to his lips, but he never drank. How\r\nwidely his life was separated from many of his associates! The\r\natmosphere of the White House has been sweeter and purer ever since he\r\noccupied it, and this is largely due to the influence of his\r\nincorruptible purity.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of religion, he did not wear his heart on his sleeve, and\r\nsome of his friends have refused to believe that he was religious. It\r\nis true that he was not a church member, but there were special reasons\r\nfor this. The church with which he was naturally affiliated was the\r\nPresbyterian. The most eloquent preacher of that denomination was the\r\nReverend Dr. Palmer of New Orleans, who was an aggressive champion of\r\nslavery as a divine institution. His teachings were feebly echoed in\r\nthousands of other pulpits. Now Lincoln abhorred slavery. He\r\nincorporated human freedom into his religion. The one point on which he\r\ninsisted all his life was that \"slavery is wrong!\" It may therefore be\r\nseen that the church did not give him a cordial invitation. If this\r\nneeds any proof, that proof is found in the fact that the pastors in\r\nSpringfield voted almost unanimously against him. Even Peter Cartwright\r\nhad denounced him as an atheist.\r\n\r\nThe marvel is that this did not embitter him against the church. But\r\nall his life long he kept up such bonds of sympathy with the church as\r\nwere possible. He bore with the faults of the church and of ministers\r\nwith that patience which made his whole character so remarkably\r\ngenuine. He was a constant attendant at the services, he was favorable\r\nto all the legitimate work of the church, and he was exceptionally kind\r\nto ministers, though they were often a sore trial to him.\r\n\r\nIn childhood he would not rest until a clergyman had traveled many\r\nmiles through the forests to preach a memorial discourse over the grave\r\nof his mother. When his father was ill he wrote a letter of religious\r\nconsolation intended for him: \"Tell him to remember to call upon and\r\nconfide in our great and good and merciful Maker, who will not turn\r\naway from him in any extremity. He notes the fall of a sparrow, and\r\nnumbers the hairs of our heads, and He will not forget the dying man\r\nwho puts his trust in Him.\"\r\n\r\nHugh McCulloch, in a personal letter to the author, January 28, 1889,\r\nwrote: \"He was, as far as I could judge, a pure man, and 'in spirit and\r\ntemper' a Christian.\" His pastor, Dr. Gurley, regarded him as a\r\nChristian. Other clergymen who were acquainted with him did so.\r\n\r\nJ. G. Holland has preserved the following incident:\r\n\r\nColonel Loomis, who was commandant of Fort Columbus, Governor's Island,\r\nin New York Harbor, reached the age at which by law he should be put on\r\nthe retired list. He was a very religious man, and his influence was so\r\nmarked that the chaplain and some others, determined to appeal to the\r\nPresident to have him continued at the post. The Reverend Dr. Duryea of\r\nBrooklyn was sent to Washington to prefer the request. \"What does the\r\nclergyman know of military matters?\" inquired the President. \"Nothing,\"\r\nwas the reply. \"It is desired to retain Colonel Loomis solely for the\r\nsake of his Christian influence. He sustains religious exercises at the\r\nfort, leads a prayer-meeting, and teaches a Bible class in the Sunday\r\nSchool.\" \"That is the highest possible recommendation,\" replied the\r\nPresident. He approved the request, and the Christian officer was\r\nretained there until imperative military duty called him elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe religious strain that runs through his papers and addresses cannot\r\nbe overlooked. But there are two that deserve special mention. The\r\nfirst is the \"Sunday Order,\" which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the\r\nsacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference\r\nto the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the\r\nDivine will, demand that Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced\r\nto the measure of strict necessity. The discipline and character of the\r\nnational forces should not suffer, nor the cause they defend be\r\nimperiled, by the profanation of the day or the name of the Most High.\"\r\n\r\nThe other is his thanksgiving proclamation. He it was who nationalized\r\nthis festival which had previously been local and irregular. His\r\nsuccessors in office have done well to follow his example in the\r\nmatter. Every November, when the entire population turns from daily\r\ntoil to an hour of thanksgiving, they should not forget that they are\r\nthereby acting on his recommendation, and in doing this they are\r\nstrengthening the best possible monument to the grand, good man whom\r\nthe Most High mercifully gave to this country in the time of her direst\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"He was a _man_; take him for all in all\r\n  I shall not look upon his like again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the career of Lincoln throughout. It is fitting\r\nthat this book should conclude with a record of what some observant men\r\nhave said about him. Accordingly this, the last, chapter is willingly\r\ngiven up to these testimonies. Of course such a list could easily be\r\nextended indefinitely, but the quotations here given are deemed\r\nsufficient for their purpose.\r\n\r\nH. W. Beecher:\r\n\r\nWho shall recount our martyr's sufferings for this people? Since the\r\nNovember of 1860 his horizon has been black with storms. By day and by\r\nnight, he trod a way of danger and darkness. On his shoulders rested a\r\ngovernment dearer to him than his own life. At its integrity millions\r\nof men were striking home. Upon this government foreign eyes lowered.\r\nIt stood like a lone island in a sea full of storms; and every tide and\r\nwave seemed eager to devour it. Upon thousands of hearts great sorrows\r\nand anxieties have rested, but not on one such, and in such measure, as\r\nupon that simple, truthful, noble soul, our faithful and sainted\r\nLincoln. Never rising to the enthusiasm of more impassioned natures in\r\nhours of hope, and never sinking with the mercurial in hours of defeat\r\nto the depths of despondency, he held on with immovable patience and\r\nfortitude, putting caution against hope, that it might not be\r\npremature, and hope against caution, that it might not yield to dread\r\nand danger. He wrestled ceaselessly through four black and dreadful\r\npurgatorial years, wherein God was cleansing the sin of his people as\r\nby fire....\r\n\r\nThen the wail of a nation proclaimed that he had gone from among us.\r\nNot thine the sorrow, but ours, sainted soul! Thou hast indeed entered\r\nthe promised land, while we are yet on the march. To us remains the\r\nrocking of the deep, the storm upon the land, days of duty and nights\r\nof watching; but thou art sphered high above all darkness and fear,\r\nbeyond all sorrow and weariness. Rest, O weary heart! Rejoice\r\nexceedingly, thou that hast enough suffered! Thou hast beheld Him who\r\ninvisibly led thee in this great wilderness. Thou standest among the\r\nelect. Around thee are the royal men that have ennobled human life in\r\nevery age. Kingly art thou, with glory on thy brow as a diadem. And joy\r\nis upon thee forevermore. Over all this land, over all this little\r\ncloud of years, that now from thine infinite horizon moves back as a\r\nspeck, thou art lifted up as high as the star is above the clouds that\r\nhide us, but never reach it. In the goodly company of Mount Zion thou\r\nshalt find that rest which thou hast sorrowing sought in vain; and thy\r\nname, an everlasting name in heaven, shall flourish in fragrance and\r\nbeauty as long as men shall last upon the earth, or hearts remain, to\r\nrevere truth, fidelity, and goodness.\r\n\r\n... Four years ago, O Illinois, we took from your midst an untried man,\r\nand from among the people. We return him to you a mighty conqueror. Not\r\nthine any more but the Nation's; not ours, but the world's. Give him\r\nplace, O ye prairies! In the midst of this great continent his dust\r\nshall rest, a sacred treasure to myriads who shall pilgrim to that\r\nshrine to kindle anew their zeal and patriotism. Ye winds that move\r\nover the mighty places of the West, chant his requiem! Ye people,\r\nbehold a martyr whose blood, as so many articulate words, pleads for\r\nfor fidelity, for law, for liberty!\r\n\r\nNoah Brooks:\r\n\r\nHe became the type, flower, and representative of all that is worthily\r\nAmerican; in him the commonest of human traits were blended with an\r\nall-embracing charity and the highest human wisdom; with single\r\ndevotion to the right he lived unselfishly, void of selfish personal\r\nambition, and, dying tragically, left a name to be remembered with love\r\nand honor as one of the best and greatest of mankind.\r\n\r\nW. C. Bryant:\r\n\r\n  Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,\r\n    Gentle and merciful and just!\r\n   Who, in the fear of God, didst bear\r\n    The sword of power, a nation's trust!\r\n\r\n  In sorrow by thy bier we stand,\r\n    Amid the awe that hushes all,\r\n   And speak the anguish of a land\r\n    That shook with horror at thy fall.\r\n\r\n  Thy task is done; the bond are free:\r\n    We bear thee to an honored grave,\r\n   Whose proudest monument shall be\r\n    The broken fetters of the slave.\r\n\r\n  Pure was thy life; its bloody close\r\n    Hath placed thee with the sons of light,\r\n   Among the noble host of those\r\n    Who perished in the cause of Right.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Choate:\r\n\r\nA rare and striking illustration of the sound mind in the sound body.\r\nHe rose to every occasion. He led public opinion. He knew the heart and\r\nconscience of the people. Not only was there this steady growth of\r\nintellect, but the infinite delicacy of his nature and capacity for\r\nrefinement developed also, as exhibited in the purity and perfection of\r\nhis language and style of speech.\r\n\r\nR. W. Emerson:\r\n\r\nHe had a face and manner which disarmed suspicion, which inspired\r\nconfidence, which confirmed good will. He was a man without vices. He\r\nhad a strong sense of duty.... He had what the farmers call a long\r\nhead.... He was a great worker; he had a prodigious faculty of\r\nperformance; worked easily.... He had a vast good nature which made him\r\naccessible to all.... Fair-minded ... affable ... this wise man.\r\n\r\nWhat an occasion was the whirlwind of the war! Here was the place for\r\nno holiday magistrate, no fair-weather sailor; the new pilot was hurled\r\nto the helm in a tornado. In four years,--four years of battle-days,--\r\nhis endurance, his fertility of resources, his magnanimity, were sorely\r\ntried and never found wanting. There, by his courage, his justice, his\r\neven temper, his fertile counsel, his humanity, he stood a heroic\r\nfigure in the center of a heroic epoch. He is the true history of the\r\nAmerican people in his time. Step by step he walked before them; slow\r\nwith their slowness, quickening his march by theirs, the true\r\nrepresentative of this continent; an entirely public man; father of his\r\ncountry, the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart, the\r\nthought of their minds articulated by his tongue.\r\n\r\nJ. G. Holland:\r\n\r\nConscience, and not expediency, not temporary advantage, not popular\r\napplause, not the love of power, was the ruling and guiding motive of\r\nhis life. He was patient with his enemies, and equally patient with\r\nequally unreasonable friends. No hasty act of his administration can be\r\ntraced to his impatience. He had a tender, brotherly regard for every\r\nhuman being; and the thought of oppression was torment to him.... A\r\nstatesman without a statesman's craftiness, a politician without a\r\npolitician's meannesses, a great man without a great man's vices, a\r\nphilanthropist without a philanthropist's impracticable dreams, a\r\nChristian without pretensions, a ruler without the pride of place and\r\npower, an ambitious man without selfishness, and a successful man\r\nwithout vanity.\r\n\r\nO. W. Holmes:\r\n\r\n  Our hearts lie buried in the dust\r\n   With him so true and tender,\r\n  The patriot's stay, the people's trust,\r\n   The shield of the offender.\r\n\r\nJ. R. Lowell:\r\n\r\nOn the day of his death, this simple Western attorney, who, according\r\nto one party was a vulgar joker, and whom the _doctrinaires_ among\r\nhis own supporters accused of wanting every element of statesmanship,\r\nwas the most absolute ruler in Christendom, and this solely by the hold\r\nhis good-humored sagacity had laid on the hearts and understandings of\r\nhis countrymen. Nor was this all, for it appeared that he had drawn the\r\ngreat majority not only of his fellow-citizens, but of mankind also, to\r\nhis side. So strong and so persuasive is honest manliness without a\r\nsingle quality of romance or unreal sentiment to help it! A civilian\r\nduring times of the most captivating military achievement, awkward,\r\nwith no skill in the lower technicalities of manners, he left behind a\r\nfame beyond that of any conqueror, the memory of a grace higher than\r\nthat of outward person, and of a gentlemanliness deeper than mere\r\nbreeding. Never before that startled April morning did such multitudes\r\nof men shed tears for the death of one whom they had never seen, as if\r\nwith him a friendly presence had been taken away from their lives,\r\nleaving them colder and darker. Never was funeral panegyric so eloquent\r\nas the silent look of sympathy which strangers exchanged when they met\r\non that day. Their common manhood had lost a kinsman.\r\n\r\n  Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.\r\n   How beautiful to see\r\n  Once more a shepherd of mankind indeed,\r\n  Who loved his charge, but never loved to lead;\r\n  One whose meek flock the people joyed to be,\r\n   Not lured by any Cheat of birth,\r\n   But by his clear-grained human worth,\r\n  And brave old wisdom of sincerity!\r\n\r\n          *          *          *          *          *\r\n\r\n  Great Captains, with their guns and drums,\r\n  Disturb our judgment for the hour,\r\n    But at last silence comes;\r\n  These all are gone, and, standing like a tower,\r\n  Our children shall behold his fame,\r\n    The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man,\r\n  Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame,\r\n  New birth of our new soil, the first American.\r\n\r\nClara Morris:\r\n\r\nGod's anointed--the great, the blameless Lincoln.... The homely,\r\ntender-hearted \"Father Abraham\"--rare combination of courage, justice,\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\nH. J. Raymond:\r\n\r\nBut there was a native grace, the out-growth of kindness of heart,\r\nwhich never failed to shine through all his words and acts. His heart\r\nwas as tender as a woman's,--as accessible to grief and gladness as a\r\nchild's,--yet strong as Hercules to bear the anxieties and\r\nresponsibilities of the awful burden that rested on it. Little\r\nincidents of the war,--instances of patient suffering in devotion to\r\nduty,--tales of distress from the lips of women, never failed to touch\r\nthe innermost chords of his nature, and to awaken that sweet sympathy\r\nwhich carries with it, to those who suffer, all the comfort the human\r\nheart can crave. Those who have heard him, as many have, relate such\r\ntouching episodes of the war, cannot recall without emotion the\r\nquivering lip, the face gnarled and writhed to stifle the rising sob,\r\nand the patient, loving eyes swimming in tears, which mirrored the\r\ntender pity of his gentle and loving nature. He seemed a stranger to\r\nthe harsher and stormier passions of man. Easily grieved, he seemed\r\nincapable of hate.... It is first among the marvels of a marvelous\r\ntime, that to such a character, so womanly in all its traits, should\r\nhave been committed, absolutely and with almost despotic power, the\r\nguidance of a great nation through a bloody and terrible civil war....\r\n\r\nCarl Schurz:\r\n\r\nAs the state of society in which Abraham Lincoln grew up passes away,\r\nthe world will read with increasing wonder of the man who, not only of\r\nthe humblest origin, but remaining the simplest and most unpretending\r\nof citizens, was raised to a position of power unprecedented in our\r\nhistory; who was the gentlest and most peace-loving of mortals, unable\r\nto see any creature suffer without a pang in his own breast, and\r\nsuddenly found himself called to conduct the greatest and bloodiest of\r\nour wars; who wielded the power of government when stern resolution and\r\nrelentless force were the order of the day, and then won and ruled the\r\npopular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his nature; who was\r\na cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit, and led the\r\nmost sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time; who, preserving\r\nhis homely speech and rustic manner, even in the most conspicuous\r\nposition of that period, drew upon himself the scoffs of polite\r\nsociety, and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of\r\nwonderful beauty and grandeur; who, in his heart the best friend of the\r\ndefeated South, was murdered because a crazy fanatic took him for its\r\nmost cruel enemy; who, while in power, was beyond measure lampooned and\r\nmaligned by sectional passion and an excited party spirit, and around\r\nwhose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him--which they have since\r\nnever ceased to do--as one of the greatest of Americans and the best of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nHenry Watterson:\r\n\r\nHe went on and on, and never backward, until his time was come, when\r\nhis genius, fully developed, rose to the great exigencies intrusted to\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nWhere did he get his style? Ask Shakespeare and Burns where they got\r\ntheir style. Where did he get his grasp upon affairs and his knowledge\r\nof men? Ask the Lord God, who created miracles in Luther and\r\nBonaparte!... Where did Shakespeare get his genius? Where did Mozart\r\nget his music? Whose hand smote the lyre of the Scottish plowman, and\r\nstayed the life of the German priest? God, God, and God alone; and as\r\nsurely as these were raised up by God, inspired by God, was Abraham\r\nLincoln; and a thousand years hence, no drama, no tragedy, no epic\r\npoem, will be filled with greater wonder, or be followed by mankind\r\nwith deeper feeling, than that which tells the story of his life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Life of Abraham Lincoln, by Henry Ketcham",
