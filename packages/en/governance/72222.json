Our history is sometimes\r\n     charged with a lack of picturesqueness because it does not deal\r\n     with the belted knight and the moated grange. But to one who\r\n     considers the moral import of events, it is hard to see how\r\n     anything can be more picturesque than the spectacle of these two\r\n     giant antagonists contending for political measures which were so\r\n     profoundly to affect the lives of millions of human beings yet\r\n     unborn.\r\n\r\n                                                             JOHN FISKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the author’s purpose, in developing the stirring story of the\r\nPlutarchian struggle of Jefferson and Hamilton, to show that without\r\nbelted knights the period was picturesque and dramatic. The\r\nextraordinary men who gave and took lusty blows did not, as some would\r\nhave us think, confine themselves to calm academic discussions of\r\nelemental principles. The dignified steel engravings of the\r\nparticipants, with which we are familiar, give no impression of the\r\ndisheveled figures seen by their contemporaries on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThis battle-field was rich in movement and color. There was tragedy and\r\npathos, much of comedy, something of the grotesque. Here we shall meet\r\nmarching mobs, witness duels and fist-fights, turbulent mass meetings,\r\npublic dinners in groves and taverns, hangings in effigy, and champions\r\nof democracy in the galleries of theaters, pelting the aristocrats in\r\nthe pits, and coercing the orchestras into playing ‘La Marseillaise.’ It\r\nwas in the midst of such scenes as these that Jefferson and Hamilton\r\nfought the battle of the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of these two giants surpasses in importance any other waged\r\nin America because it related to elemental differences that reach back\r\ninto the ages, and will continue to divide mankind far into the future.\r\nThe surrender at Yorktown ended one phase of the Revolution, but it was\r\nnot complete until, after twelve years of nationhood, it was\r\ndefinitively determined that this should be not only a republic, but a\r\ndemocratic republic. That was the real issue between Jefferson and\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\nThe passions of the period still persist, and much of myth has been\r\nbuilt up by idolaters and enemies about both leaders. It has seemed\r\npossible to the author to tell the story of their struggle with complete\r\njustice to both. The part each played in the creation of the Nation was\r\nessential. It has been the purpose to depict these two men and their\r\nassociates as they really were in the heat of controversy, neither\r\nsparing their weaknesses nor exaggerating their virtues; to paint them\r\nas men of flesh and blood with passions, prejudices, and human\r\nlimitations; to show them at close quarters wielding their weapons, and\r\nsometimes, in the heat of the fight, stooping to conquer; and to uncover\r\ntheir motives as they are clearly disclosed in the correspondence of\r\nthemselves and friends. This has necessitated the demolishment of some\r\nfashionable myths, when myths have obstructed the view to truth.\r\n\r\nThe facts as here set forth throw a vivid light on the causes of the\r\ncollapse of the Federalist Party, which, in the average of its\r\nleadership, was, perhaps, the most brilliant, and certainly the most\r\nattractive, in American history. Men of wonderful charm they were, but\r\nthey were singularly lacking in an understanding of the spirit of their\r\ntimes and country. They fell, as we shall find, because they neither had\r\nnor sought contact with the average man, and sternly set themselves\r\nagainst the overwhelming current of democracy.\r\n\r\nEven so, we shall find an explanation of their distrust of popular\r\ngovernment in the illiteracy of the times, the exaggerated notions of\r\nfreedom that prevailed, and the levity with which so many looked on\r\nfinancial obligations. It is easier to understand the Hamiltonian\r\ndistrust of democracy than to comprehend the faith of Jefferson--a faith\r\nof tremendous significance in history. Quite as remarkable as his faith\r\nwas the ability of Jefferson to mobilize, organize, and discipline the\r\ngreat individualistic mass of the towns, the remote farms along the\r\nSavannah, the almost unbroken wilds of the Western wilderness. With a\r\nfew notable exceptions, he was forced to rely for assistance on\r\nlieutenants pathetically inferior to the group of brilliant men who sat\r\non the Federalist board of strategy. He won because he was a host within\r\nhimself, capable of coping single-handed against the combined geniuses\r\nof the opposition in the field of practical politics.\r\n\r\nA liberal use has been made of the newspapers of the period; not only of\r\nthe descriptions of actual events, but of the false rumors and stories\r\nthat entered into the creation of the prejudices that always play their\r\npart in the affairs of men. In determining why a given result was forced\r\nby public opinion, it is no more necessary to know what the truth was\r\nthan to know what the people who formed that opinion thought the truth\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nAlong with the struggles in Congress, the bickerings in streets,\r\ncoffee-houses, and taverns, the actions of mobs and mass meetings, it\r\nhas been thought important to show the part ‘society’ played in the\r\ndrama--for it was a significant part. This was inevitable in a clear-cut\r\nfight between democracy and aristocracy. The elegant home of Mrs.\r\nBingham was scarcely less identified with the Federalists than was that\r\nof Lady Holland with the English Whigs, or that of Madame Holland with\r\nthe party of the Gironde. The pettings which the Otises and Harpers\r\nthere received after the battles in the House were very real rewards to\r\nmen of their temperament. The part played by men and women of fashion in\r\nthe politics of the time will appear in the ostracism of Democrats from\r\ntheir charmed circle, when even Jefferson, snubbed, was driven for\r\nsolace to the solitude of the library of the Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\nThroughout the struggle we shall find the forces well\r\ndefined--aristocracy against democracy, and sometimes we shall see it\r\nillustrated with theatrical exaggeration, as when the Philadelphia\r\naristocrats of the army that marched against the Whiskey Boys, on\r\nprancing horses and in broadcloth uniforms, paraded their ragged,\r\nweather-beaten prisoners of the frontier through the fashionable streets\r\nfor the delectation of the ladies at the windows.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to treat of this period without giving to John Adams a\r\nplace apart. He was in some respects a tragic figure, and, though\r\nludicrously vain and often all but clownish in small things, we shall\r\nhave occasion to admire and respect his independence and courageous\r\nsubordination of his personal fortunes to the service of humanity and\r\ncountry in making the peace with France. If at times the mere recitation\r\nof his personal weaknesses seems like ill-natured ridicule, it should be\r\nborne in mind that this is necessary to the explanation of why a\r\nstatesman and patriot, so able and deserving, was so unfortunate in his\r\npublic career.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the author is not to make out a case for or against\r\ndemocracy, but to show how it came to the Republic, sometimes blundering\r\nand making a fool of itself on the way; to re-create, if possible, an\r\nheroic, picturesque, and lusty age; to make the men of the steel\r\nengravings flesh and blood; to stage the drama of a day when real giants\r\ntrod the boards.\r\n\r\n                                                       CLAUDE G.

Wandering about the\r\nnarrow, crooked streets he encountered few colleagues. That was the\r\nbeginning of his cynicism.\r\n\r\nA week after the date set for the opening of Congress but six Senators\r\nhad appeared, and a circular letter was sent to the others urging their\r\nimmediate attendance. Two weeks more and neither House nor Senate could\r\nmuster a quorum.[1] Ames could see little improvement on the ‘languor of\r\nthe old Confederation,’ but expected an organization of the House within\r\na day or two. A Virginian, lingering in Philadelphia with a slight\r\nindisposition, was expected momentarily and the Representatives from New\r\nJersey were on the way. But there was nothing definite on which to base\r\nsuch fair hopes of the Senate.[2] The next day Madison wrote Washington\r\nin a similar vein.[3] This seeming indolence or indifference was the\r\nsubject of pessimistic conversations among the members in town as they\r\nmeandered about the streets. Revenue was being lost--‘a thousand pounds\r\na day’; credit was going; the spirit of the new experiment was sinking.\r\n‘The people will forget the new government before it is born,’ wrote\r\nAmes. ‘The resurrection of the infant will come before its birth.’[4]\r\nAlready petty jealousies and ambitions were manifesting themselves, with\r\nmuch intriguing for the honor of being messengers to notify the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of their election.[5] The little city was\r\noverrun with job-hunters. Even before the gavel fell on the first\r\nsession, there were discussions of removing the capital elsewhere\r\nbecause of ‘the unreasonable expense of living,’ in New York.\r\n\r\nIt was not until April 2d, almost a month late, that a quorum was formed\r\nin the two houses. The following day George Washington was elected\r\nPresident, John Adams Vice-President, and messengers started for Mount\r\nVernon and Braintree. Confronted by the most momentous governmental task\r\nin history, the men on whom fell the burden of creating a new nation had\r\nconsulted their personal convenience about starting. It was not a\r\npromising beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIf the lawmakers had been derelict, the people of New York had not. They\r\nat least appreciated the possibilities of a capital. The task of\r\ndesigning Federal Hall in which Congress was to meet had been entrusted\r\nto L’Enfant--who was to win undying fame by planning the city of\r\nWashington--and he had done his work well--some thought too well. Ames\r\nwas rather delighted over the fact that it had cost ‘20,000 pounds York\r\nmoney,’ but Ames was a lover of luxury, and the more democratic Wingate,\r\nwhile conceding that the city had ‘exerted itself mightily,’ was afraid\r\nit had done so ‘excessively.’[6] In truth there was dignity and beauty\r\nin the stately arches and the Doric columns, in the lofty vestibule\r\npaved with marble and lighted from an ornate dome, in the design and\r\ndecorations of the chambers, with their graceful pilasters and their\r\ncrimson draperies. There was richness enough to disturb the republican\r\nsouls of members from the rural districts and the small towns.[7] Among\r\nthe members who sat down amidst these surroundings were a number who\r\nwere nationally known and brilliant, but the majority were comparatively\r\nobscure and mediocre. Looking over his colleagues, the enthusiastic and\r\nimpressionable Ames found himself ‘less awed and terrified’ than he had\r\nexpected; for while it was ‘quite a republican assembly’ because ‘it\r\nlooks like one,’ he could see few ‘shining geniuses.’[8] To the more\r\nexperienced Madison, the outlook was not so pleasing. ‘I see on the list\r\nof Representatives a very scanty proportion who will share in the\r\ndrudgery of business,’ he wrote.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAfter a triumphant journey, constantly interrupted by ovations and\r\naddresses, by the thunder of artillery, the clatter of cavalry, and the\r\nringing of bells, John Adams reached the city, took his seat beneath the\r\ncanopy of crimson velvet in the Senate and began his reign. The ceremony\r\nand adulation of his progress from Braintree had gone to his head.\r\nAlmost immediately he began to mimic the manners and parrot the language\r\nof the Old World court circles, until even the aristocratic Ames was\r\nmoved to regret his ‘long absence’ from the country because of which he\r\nhad ‘not so clear an idea of the temper of the people as others who have\r\nnot half his knowledge in other matters.’[10]\r\n\r\nWith the approach of Washington, the Senate, partly under the\r\ninspiration of Adams, began to grapple soberly with the problem of form\r\nand titles. Even before the arrival of Adams, when every one was ‘busy\r\nin collecting flowers and sweets ... to amuse and delight the President\r\n... on his arrival,’ the prosaic Roger Sherman had ‘set his head to work\r\nto devise some style of address more novel and dignified than\r\n“Excellency.”’ There was an ominous growl from the skeptics who doubted\r\nthe propriety, and some ribald laughter from the wits. A caricature had\r\neven appeared under the caption ‘The Entry,’ representing the President\r\non an ass, and in the arms of his man Billy Humphreys, who was shouting\r\nhosannas and birthday odes, while the Devil looked on with the comment:\r\n\r\n    ‘The glorious time has come to pass\r\n     When David shall conduct an ass.’[11]\r\n\r\nIt was to require more heroic treatment than this, however, to cool the\r\nsenatorial ardor for high-sounding names. Even before Adams had been\r\nelected, he had participated in serious discussions in Boston as to\r\nwhether the President should be called ‘Majesty,’ or ‘Excellency,’ or\r\nnothing at all. Of course the Senators and Representatives should be\r\ngiven the honest English title of ‘Most Honorable’ for Major Russell in\r\nthe ‘Centinel’ had been doing that all along. But the time for decision\r\nhad come. The President was approaching. It had been decided that on his\r\narrival at the Senate Chamber for his inauguration, he was to be met at\r\nthe door by Adams, conducted to a chair, and informed that both houses\r\nwere ready to attend him when he took the oath. But how should he be\r\naddressed? Should it be as ‘Mr. Washington,’ ‘Mr. President,’ ‘Sir,’\r\n‘May it please your Excellency,’ or what? Adams took his troubles to the\r\nSenate. Should it be as ‘Excellency,’ as in the army? Adams was free to\r\nadmit that he preferred it to ‘Mr. President,’ which ‘would put him on a\r\nlevel with the Governor of Bermuda.’\r\n\r\nThere were Senators who instantly caught the importance of the point.\r\nOne proposed the appointment of a committee to determine.[12] But these\r\ntroubles came, not singly, but in battalions. What was Mr. Adams to do\r\nwhen Washington was in the Chamber? He did not know whether the framers\r\nof the Constitution ‘had in view the two Kings of Sparta or the two\r\nConsuls of Rome when they formed it,’ He could not tell whether the\r\narchitect of the building, in making his chair wide enough for two, had\r\nthe Constitution before him. He was Vice-President--but he was also\r\nPresident of the Senate. ‘When the President comes into the Senate, what\r\nshall I be?’ he asked plaintively. ‘I cannot be President then. I wish\r\ngentlemen to think what I shall be.’\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn moment. Adams, with an air of distress, sank into his\r\nchair. The silence was depressing. The leveler from the frontier of\r\nPennsylvania, Maclay, found ‘the profane muscles of his face in tune for\r\nlaughter,’ but controlled himself. Ellsworth, a practical man, was seen\r\nfeverishly turning the pages of the fundamental law. At length he rose\r\nto announce the result of his research. It was clear enough that\r\nwherever the Senate was, ‘there, sir, you must be at the head of them.’\r\nBut--‘here he looked aghast as if some tremendous gulf yawned before\r\nhim’--but ‘further, sir, I shall not pretend to say.’[13]\r\n\r\nThus the great day arrived to find the Senate caught unawares by a new\r\ncrisis. Adams had just risen to explain that Washington would probably\r\naddress the Congress, and to ask instructions as to ‘how I shall\r\nbehave.’ It was a congenial subject for discussion. Lee of Virginia rose\r\nto explain the ways of the Lords and the Commons. Izard of South\r\nCarolina, who had been educated abroad and wished it understood, told\r\nhow often he had been in the Houses of Parliament. Lee had observed\r\nthat, while the Lords sat, the Commons stood. True, admitted Izard, but\r\nthere were no seats for the Commons. Adams here interrupted to tell the\r\nSenate how often he too had been in Parliament. Old Carroll of\r\nCarrollton, who lived like a lord, but did not think like one,\r\ngrumblingly suggested that it did not matter what the English did.\r\n\r\nAnd just then--consternation! The Clerk of the House was at the door!\r\nHow should he be received? The discussion was feverishly resumed. Lee,\r\ngetting his cue from the Commons again, was sure that he should be met\r\nat the door by the Sergeant-at-Arms with his mace on his shoulder.\r\nConfusion worse confounded--the Speaker and members of the House were\r\nnow at the door! Members left their seats in their embarrassment, the\r\ndoors were opened, the House filed in. Some one had blundered![14]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with increased animation, the debate over the title for the\r\nPresident was resumed. Of course there should be titles, said Lee.\r\nVenice, Genoa, Greece, Rome--all had them. Ellsworth began to find\r\nvirtue in kings; Izard was impressed with the antiquity of kingly\r\ngovernment. Old Carroll, grumbling--or laughing--as usual, did not care\r\nfor kings. But the President’s title--what should it be? Ellsworth\r\nthought ‘President’ common. Adams eagerly added that there were\r\n‘presidents of fire companies and cricket clubs.’\r\n‘Excellency?’--suggested by Izard. ‘Highness?’--proposed by Lee.\r\n‘Elective Highness?’[15]\r\n\r\nAt length it was settled--‘His Highness the President of the United\r\nStates and Protector of the Rights of the Same.’ Adams was disgusted.\r\n‘What will the common people of foreign countries; what will the\r\nsoldiers and sailors say to “George Washington, President of the United\r\nStates”? They will despise him to all eternity.’[16]\r\n\r\nThe rabid republicans began to laugh. Speaker Muhlenberg dubbed Maclay,\r\n‘Your Highness of the Senate.’ Maclay himself, usually sardonic, grew\r\nfacetious in debate, and thought the title satisfactory if the President\r\nwas really high ‘and gloriously greased with a great horn of oil’ to\r\nmake him conspicuous. Even Robert Morris complained that the Congress\r\nwas also ‘Protector of the Rights of the People.’[17] But alas, it was a\r\ncase of love’s labor lost, for when the ponderous title reached the\r\nHouse, James Madison quietly announced that the Constitution had given\r\nthe head of the State a title--‘President of the United States’; and so\r\nit has been from that day to this.\r\n\r\nThe more thoughtful had witnessed the tempest in a teapot with some\r\nmisgivings. Madison thought the success of the Senate plan would have\r\n‘given a deep wound to our infant Government’;[18] and Ames thought it\r\n‘a very foolish thing to risk much to secure’ and wished ‘that Mr. Adams\r\nhad been less disguised.’[19] But they who continued for twelve years to\r\nrefer to ‘the court’ were not content. A correspondent of Fenno’s\r\n‘Gazette,’ the ‘court journal,’ continued to plead for ‘titles of\r\ndistinction’ and to pray piously that Congress would ‘not leave the\r\nimportant subject to chance, to whim, caprice, or accident.’[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these acrimonious discussions of the flubdubbery of\r\nceremonials, and with Adams proposing that the Sergeant-at-Arms be\r\ncalled ‘Usher of the Black Rod,’[21] Washington reached New York. A\r\nblack mass of humanity awaited him in the rain at the water-front,\r\npeered down upon him from roofs and windows. The roaring of cannon and\r\nthe pealing of bells apprized the crowd that the ornate barge the city\r\nhad provided to ‘waft His Excellency across the bay’[22] had been\r\nsighted. The thirteen pilots in white uniforms who manned the barge were\r\nconspicuous as it moved on to the accompaniment of cheers to the Wall\r\nStreet wharf. As it swept alongside the landing, bands on the banks\r\njoined in the noisy welcome of the cannon and the bells. When\r\nWashington, in a plain suit of blue and buff, rose to descend ‘the\r\nstairs covered with crimson trapping, the shouts of the populace drowned\r\nthe combined noises of the mechanical devices.’[23]\r\n\r\nDeclining the use of carriages, he proceeded with his party and the\r\ncommittee on foot down Wall Street to Pearl, then Queen, and up the\r\nfull length of that then fashionable thoroughfare, which boasted a\r\nsidewalk that would accommodate three walking abreast, to the house\r\nprepared for him on Cherry Street. The crowd followed, men, women, and\r\nchildren, masters and men. There at the house they left him; and a few\r\nmoments later he returned down Pearl Street to the home of Governor\r\nGeorge Clinton to dine. That night the houses of the city were\r\nilluminated. The monarch had entered his capital. To the masses he was\r\nthe maker of a nation; to the world of fashion he was the creator of a\r\ncourt.[24]\r\n\r\nThe day of inauguration found the city fluttering with flags, colorful\r\nwith decorations, Wall Street fairly screaming with the spirit of\r\nfestivity. Wreaths and flowers hung from windows. A reverential throng\r\npacking Wall, Broad, and Nassau Streets watched the great man enter the\r\nHall; and a few minutes later he appeared upon the balcony of the Senate\r\nChamber--a gallant figure in deep brown, ‘with medal buttons, an eagle\r\non them, white stockings, a bag and sword’[25]--to take the oath.\r\n\r\nThe keen eyes of Alexander Hamilton surveyed the scene from his home\r\nacross the street.\r\n\r\nThence back to the Senate Chamber where the inaugural address, in\r\ntrembling hands, was read with difficulty because of the shaking paper.\r\nThe erratic but loyal Maclay was pained to find that his hero was not\r\n‘first in everything.’[26] Thence back to the house on Cherry Street.\r\n\r\nNever had the little city been so picturesquely and brilliantly\r\nilluminated as on that night of general rejoicing. Transparent paintings\r\nshone all over the town--that at the bottom of Broadway ‘the finest ever\r\nseen in America.’[27] It was a beautiful evening, ‘and no accident cast\r\nthe smallest cloud upon the retrospect.’[28]\r\n\r\nA few evenings later, an inaugural ball was given by the Assembly in\r\ntheir rooms on Broadway above Wall Street. The President ‘was pleased to\r\nhonor the company with his presence,’[29] and ‘every pleasure seemed to\r\nbe heightened’ as a result.[30] There, too, was ‘His Excellency the\r\nVice-President,’ and members of Congress with their families, officers\r\nof the army, the Ministers of France and Spain. ‘Joy, satisfaction and\r\nvivacity was expressed on every countenance.’[31] Each lady, passing the\r\nticket-taker, was presented with a fan made in Paris, with an ivory\r\nframe containing a medallion portrait of Washington in profile. ‘A\r\nnumerous and brilliant collection of ladies’ it was, according to the\r\nimpressionable reporter, all dressed ‘with a consummate taste and\r\nelegance.’[32]\r\n\r\nSociety awoke that night to the fact that a nation had been created and\r\na capital established on the Hudson, and it fairly titillated at the\r\nprospect of the gayety of a ‘court.’\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nNow let us take a turn around the city and familiarize ourselves with\r\nthe setting of the drama. It will not take long, for the little city of\r\nthirty-five thousand was compactly built. Broadway, the most promising\r\nand pretentious of the thoroughfares, was paved only to Vesey\r\nStreet--beyond that, mud. The houses, most of them modest, were\r\nsurrounded by gardens. From the west side of Broadway to the west side\r\nof Greenwich, the town was well built up from Bowling Green to Reade.\r\nBeyond that, only the hospital and a few widely scattered houses. On the\r\neast side, building extended as far north as Broome. Were we on a\r\nshopping expedition we should seek Nassau and William, the heart of the\r\nretail district, passing on the former many attractive homes including\r\nthat of Aaron Burr. Were we bent on a promenade, to meet the ladies and\r\nthe dandies, we should betake ourselves to Wall, where, notwithstanding\r\nthe auctioneers, the shoemakers, the grocers, the tailors, the\r\nconfectioners, the peruke-makers, we should pass handsome homes. Perhaps\r\nwe should jostle the statesmen emerging from the boarding-houses along\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThese narrow, crooked streets we should find more tolerable by day than\r\nby night. The street lamps were at wide intervals and frequently\r\nunlighted. If we escaped a highwayman in the night, we should be lucky\r\nto escape the mud of the poorly paved sidewalks, and if we did not\r\nbruise our shins by collision with the town pumps, we should be\r\nfortunate not to stumble over a pig. Off somewhere in the darkness we\r\nshould probably hear the curses of some unfortunate wanderer fallen over\r\nan obstruction, the grunting of hogs rooting in the gutters, the\r\nbarking of innumerable dogs.[33] The long line of negroes bearing\r\nburdens toward the river might pique our curiosity did we not know that\r\nthey were the sewage carriers of the city doing their nightly routine\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nEven by day we should find traveling not without its risks, for many of\r\nthe streets were torn up for improvements.[34] Thus ‘the Hon. Mr.\r\nHuger,’ thrown from his sedan chair and painfully bruised, lays claim to\r\nimmortality in the pages of Maclay[35] and in the yellowing sheets of\r\nFenno’s journal.[36] Faring forth in search of the political\r\ncelebrities, we should not have far to go, for most were herded in\r\nboarding-houses. Hamilton lived comfortably at Broad and Wall Streets,\r\nBurr around the corner on Nassau. Jefferson was soon realizing his dream\r\nof comfort on Broadway after living in a little house in Maiden Lane.\r\nRandolph, the Attorney-General, had found a modest place in the country\r\nfor two hundred and fifty dollars with ‘an excellent pump of fresh\r\nwater.’[37] Knox was living beyond his means on Broadway, and Adams was\r\nat Richmond Hill. But most of the lawgivers found boarding-houses more\r\ncongenial to their purses. Thus, within a few steps on Great Dock Street\r\nwe should find Robert Morris, Caleb Strong, Pierce Butler, Fisher Ames,\r\nand Theodore Sedgwick; in Maiden Lane, James Madison; on Smith Street,\r\nCharles Carroll, and on Water Street, Oliver Ellsworth.\r\n\r\nTurning from the celebrities to the lowly and the base, we could visit\r\nthe slave market which was then active, for there were more than two\r\nthousand negroes in bondage in the city. While the orators at Federal\r\nHall were speaking reverently of liberty, the hammer of the auctioneer\r\nwas knocking down negro girls to the highest bidder, and the local\r\npapers were running ‘rewards’ for the capture of runaway slaves.[38]\r\nWere we in the mood to walk to the end of the pavement on Broadway, we\r\ncould regale ourselves, in the grove where the City Hall now stands,\r\nwith a view of the gallows enshrined in a Chinese pagoda where the\r\nexecutioners competed successfully at times with the debaters in\r\nattracting the curious. There, too, stood the whipping-post.[39] In the\r\nmidst of so much that was grim, little wonder that the statesmen\r\nresented the frequent ringing of funeral bells. ‘The gentlemen from the\r\ncountry complain exceedingly of this noisy, unmeaning and absurd\r\ncustom,’ wrote ‘A Citizen’ to his favorite paper. ‘This is the moment to\r\nabolish it, and give an evidence of a disposition to please them.’[40]\r\nBut it is not of record that the ‘gentlemen from the country’ were\r\npermitted to interfere with the privileges of the dead.\r\n\r\nWere we to turn from these grim specters to amusement, we could get a\r\nconveyance at one of the city’s six livery stables to carry us into the\r\ncountry to the Florida tea-gardens on the North River; thence to Perry’s\r\non the present site of Union Square, or to Williamson’s, near the\r\npresent site of Greenwich and Harrison.[41] But were our mood of darker\r\nhue, we could find no dearth of entertainment at the taverns. When\r\nCongress quarreled and struggled at Federal Hall, and Washington dwelt\r\non Cherry Street, one hundred and thirty-one taverns were licensed in\r\nthe city to which flocked all manner of men. There, with liquor or ale,\r\nwe could enjoy a cock-fight and pick the winner, or gather about the\r\ntable and gamble at cards. Laborers, loafers, sailors, criminals\r\ninfested these dives, and if we preferred cleaner company, we might get\r\nan invitation to the Black Friars, the one social club in the city.[42]\r\nOr, if more intellectual entertainment were desired, it could be found\r\nin the wooden building painted red on John Street, a stone’s-throw from\r\nSaint Paul’s Church where Washington had his pew, where the Old American\r\nCompany regaled the people of the pit, the boxes, and galleries with the\r\nplays of Shakespeare, Sheridan, Goldsmith, Garrick, and some of\r\nindifferent merit.[43] Here ‘The Father,’ by William Dunlap, the\r\nhistorian of the American theater, had its first presentation--a notable\r\nevent, since Washington, a spectator, was seen to laugh at the\r\ncomedy.[44] Indeed, his health permitting, the President was frequently\r\nseen in his box which bore the arms of the United States, and the press\r\nwas not amiss in keeping the public informed when the great man went to\r\nthe play.[45] He had been in the house on Cherry Street but a few days,\r\nwhen, disregarding the frowns of the purists, he went to see the\r\n‘School for Scandal.’ Two days before, the ‘Daily Advertiser’ had gayly\r\nhinted of the prospective visit. ‘It is whispered that “The School for\r\nScandal” and “The Poor Soldier” will be acted on Monday night for the\r\nentertainment of the President,’ it said. And then it added, by way of\r\ngentle admonition to the players: ‘Mrs. Henry ought on this occasion to\r\ncondescend to give passion and tenderness to Maria.... Mrs. Henry ought\r\nto act Norah and improve the delightful farce by the melody of her\r\nvoice. Mrs. Henry ought to take no offense at the suggestion.’[46] We\r\nmay be sure it was a festive occasion, for Fenno’s ‘court journal’ said\r\nthat ‘there was a most crowded house and the ladies, who were numerous,\r\nmade a most brilliant appearance.’[47] One sour Senator in the\r\npresidential party did not take kindly to the play. ‘I think it an\r\nindecent representation before ladies of character and virtue,’ he\r\nwrote--and there were ladies in the party![48] The President, however,\r\nwas pleased to go again quite soon to see ‘The Clandestine Marriage,’\r\nagain subjecting ‘ladies of character and virtue’ to temptation, for\r\nMrs. Morris and Mrs. Knox were with his party when ‘Mrs. Henry and Mrs.\r\nMorris played with their usual naïveté and uncommon animation’ due to\r\n‘the countenance of such illustrious auditors.’[49]\r\n\r\nOther forms of entertainment, all too few, were not neglected by the\r\ncelebrities. ‘The President and his Lady and family and several other\r\npersons of distinction were pleased to honor Mr. Bowen’s wax-works\r\nexhibit with their company at 74 Water Street’--looms among the\r\nannouncements of the ‘court journal.’[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNor were the entertainments dependent wholly upon the residents and\r\ngovernmental dignitaries. The little city was bravely simulating the\r\nairs of a real capital. The social climbers, hearing of the ‘court’\r\nflocked to town from the four corners with their wives and\r\ndaughters.[51] The cost of living mounted alarmingly, and the rental of\r\nsuitable houses was prohibitive to many. Oliver Wolcott, hesitating\r\nabout accepting a place paying fifteen hundred dollars a year, had been\r\nassured by Ellsworth that a house could be had for two hundred dollars,\r\nwood for four dollars a cord, hay for eight dollars a ton, but that\r\nmarketing was twenty-five per cent higher than at Hartford.[52] But soon\r\nafter his arrival, the discouraged official was writing his father that\r\n‘the expense of living here will be greater than I had imagined.’[53]\r\nThe leading tavern, on the west side of Broadway, near Cedar, was a\r\nmodest establishment with immodest prices.[54] And to make matters\r\nworse, ‘society’ had set a giddy pace.\r\n\r\nWe are especially interested in this society because Jefferson, on his\r\narrival, was shocked at its unrepublican tone. The inner or select\r\ncircle did not number more than three hundred.[55] A French traveler was\r\nimpressed with its tendency to luxury, its love of grandeur, and\r\nostentatious display. ‘English luxury,’ ‘English fashions,’ the women in\r\n‘the most brilliant silks, gauzes, hats, and borrowed hair,’ the men,\r\nmore modest as to dress, but taking ‘their revenge in the luxury of the\r\ntable’ and in smoking cigars from the Spanish islands.[56] The Loyalist\r\nfamilies were forward in asserting their social prerogatives in the\r\nshadow of the Republican ‘Court.’ Did they not have money and the\r\nprestige of having wined and dined and danced with the officers of His\r\nMajesty in the days of the occupation? None more conspicuous than the\r\nHenry Whites with a fine house on Wall Street, with one son in His\r\nMajesty’s army, another a rear admiral in His Majesty’s navy. About the\r\nMisses White--‘so gay and fashionable, so charming in conversation, with\r\nsuch elegant figures’--the young blades gathered like moths about the\r\nflame. Giddy were the parties there, the men Beau Brummels in the\r\nextreme of fashion, and out of the few fugitive pictures we catch a\r\nglimpse of Mrs. Verplanck dancing a minuet ‘in hoop and petticoats,’ and\r\na young beau catching cold from ‘riding home in a sedan chair with one\r\nof the glasses broken,’ after partaking too freely of hot port wine.[57]\r\n\r\nBalls and teas there were aplenty, but ‘society’ preferred to dine and\r\ntalk. Hamilton in his home on Wall Street gave frequent dinners\r\ninsinuating when not boldly proclaiming his doubts of the people. Van\r\nBreckel, the Dutch Minister, entertained lavishly, making his\r\ndining-room the resort of the little foreign circle--and every one tried\r\nto keep up the pace.\r\n\r\nIt was the pace that killed--financially. The Henry Knoxes then began\r\ntheir journey toward bankruptcy, living elaborately on Broadway,\r\nmaintaining horses and grooms, five servants, and giving two dinners a\r\nmonth. Almost a ninth of his salary went for wine alone. What with his\r\nown hair-dressing, and that of the expansive Lucy, who wore her hair,\r\nafter the extreme fashion, ‘at least a foot high, much in the form of a\r\nchurn bottom upward,’ the family account with Anthony Latour,\r\nhair-dresser, was no small matter,[58] and his annual deficit was a\r\nthird of his salary.\r\n\r\nNor was the Secretary of War unique. The social life was a hectic swirl\r\nof calls, teas, entertainments. ‘When shall I get spirit to pay all the\r\nsocial debts I owe?’ wrote one lady of quiet tastes.[59] It was\r\nharvest-time for the dressmakers, the jewelers, the hair-dressers. The\r\nball given in compliment to Washington by the French Minister called for\r\nspecial costumes, for there were ‘two sets of Cotillion Dancers in\r\ncomplete uniforms; one set in that of France and the other in Buff and\r\nBlue,’ while the ladies were ‘dressed in white with Ribbands, Bouquets\r\nand Garlands of Flowers answering to the uniforms of the Gentlemen.’[60]\r\nAnd so with other functions equally gay.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the ‘court’ had come to town, and if there was no Majesty\r\non Cherry Street, it was not because the ‘court set’ did not pretend it\r\nso. The illusion of vanity was fostered by the snobbery of Fenno of the\r\n‘court journal.’ When Madame Washington arrived, ‘conducted over the bay\r\nin the President’s barge rowed by thirteen eminent pilots in handsome\r\nwhite dress,’ the editor enumerated the ladies who had ‘paid their\r\ndevoirs to the amiable consort of our beloved President.’ There were\r\n‘the Lady of His Excellency the Governor, Lady Sterling, Lady Mary\r\nWatts, Lady Kitty Duer, La Marchioness de Brehan, the ladies of the Most\r\nHonorable Mr. Langdon, and the Most Honorable Mr. Dalton ... and a\r\ngreat many other respectable characters.’[61] This was too much for ‘A\r\nRepublican’ who worked off his fury in a scornful letter to the\r\nopposition paper referring to the ‘tawdry phraseology,’ to the ‘titular\r\nfolly of Europe’s courts,’ and suggesting that we ‘leave to the sons and\r\ndaughters of corrupted Europe their levees, Drawing Rooms, Routs, Drums,\r\nand Tornedos.’[62] It was to require more than this, however, to jar the\r\nhigh-flying Fenno from the clouds, and his readers were soon informed\r\nthat ‘His Excellency the Vice-President, His Excellency the Governor of\r\nthe State, and many other personalities of the greatest distinction will\r\nbe present at the theater this evening.’ It was not for nothing that the\r\npedagogue pensman from Boston had launched his paper with the hope ‘that\r\nthe wealthy part of the community will become patrons of this\r\npublication.’[63] The ‘inconveniency of being fashionable’ was impressed\r\nupon one Senator on finding a colleague, who, having ‘set up a coach,’\r\nand, embarrassed in his plans by the irregular adjournments, was wont to\r\nsit alone in the Chamber ‘in a state of ennui’ as much as ‘two or three\r\nhours’ waiting for his carriage ‘to take him three or four hundred\r\nyards.’[64]\r\n\r\nBut while there was much of this ridiculous affectation, society was not\r\nwithout its charms; for Mrs. Hamilton had her days for receiving, and\r\nher drawing-room was brilliant, and all the more interesting because her\r\nvivacious sister, Mrs. Church, just back from London, bringing with her\r\n‘a late abominable fashion of Ladies, like Washwomen with their sleeves\r\nabove their elbows,’ was there to assist.[65] And all the men were not\r\non stilts, for it is on record that the congressional delegation from\r\nPennsylvania would occasionally break through the ‘court circle’ to dine\r\nfrom three to nine, and indulge in ‘a scene of beastial badness’ with\r\nRobert Morris proving himself ‘certainly the greatest blackguard in that\r\nway.’[66] There was the usual small gossip to bring the soarers to\r\nearth. The cream served at the table of Mrs. Washington was not the\r\nbest. Mrs. Morris had been compelled to ‘rid herself of a morsel’ of\r\nspoiled food there, but ‘Mrs. Washington ate a whole heap of it.’[67]\r\nMrs. Knox amused the Mother Grundys because so fat, and her blundering\r\nmisuse of words caused much tittering behind fans and much whispering\r\namong her friends.\r\n\r\nBut it was on the Wall Street promenade that the gossips depended for\r\ntheir choicest morsels. The Wall Street of that day was just beginning\r\nto displace Pearl as the abode of fashion. True, there were a few\r\nbusiness houses, a tavern, a fashionable caterer, a jeweler, but from\r\nBroadway to Pearl there was a row of substantial residences in which\r\ndwelt people of importance. It was there in the promenade that the\r\npolitical celebrities were encountered, but more appealing to the\r\ngentlemen of pleasure were the fine ladies who passed in their\r\nfinery--gay silks and satins--walking or taking the air luxuriously in\r\ntheir sedan chairs. The cronies of Dan McCormick, the unsnared and\r\nlordly entertainer, who gazed out of the windows of his House of Gossip\r\nat Number 39, and from his front steps surveyed the parade with the eyes\r\nof connoisseurs, must have been trying to the modesty of the timid--but\r\nperhaps none such passed that way. If they laughed over the latest\r\nblunders of Mrs. Knox as she hove into sight like a huge ship in full\r\nsail, and made merry over the sister of the French Consul as she was\r\nborne luxuriously along in her sedan chair, we may be sure that they\r\nwere appreciative of the pretty. And these crowded the narrow street for\r\nthe promenade, quite as much bent on amusement and flirtation as the men\r\nabout town on the steps of the House of Gossip.\r\n\r\nFor it was an age of gallantry, the men quite as vain as the women dared\r\nbe, and there, in addition to political celebrities, paraded the local\r\nblades of society in their white buzz wigs, their three-cornered hats,\r\nand silver shoe buckles. Here the elegant Hamilton in banter with a\r\nblushing belle, there the courtly Burr bowing over the hand of a\r\ncoquette unafraid of the fire, and yonder Dr. John Bard, who prescribed\r\npills for the fashionable, pounding the pavement with his heavy cane as\r\nhe walked along smiling a bit sardonically upon his patients. And,\r\nswinging along like a symphony, a dandy in a scarlet coat with\r\nmother-of-pearl buttons, a white silk waistcoat embroidered with colored\r\nflowers, black satin breeches, white silk stockings, and a cocked hat,\r\nan Irish miniature painter out for an airing and to give the ladies a\r\ntreat. Here--on Wall Street--was Vanity Fair.[68]\r\n\r\nAlbeit the Vice-President had not then become the social head of the\r\nNation, society liked nothing better than an invitation to Richmond\r\nHill, the home of Adams, a mile and a half from the city. Even Abigail\r\nwas delighted, for her home reminded her ‘of the valley of Honiton in\r\nDevonshire,’ with its avenue of forest trees, its shrubbery, its green\r\nfields, its pastures full of cattle, and the Hudson ‘white flecked with\r\nsails.’[69] Here at the dinner-table statesmen and their wives and the\r\nsocial leaders contrived to talk like ladies and gentlemen of the court,\r\nand Jefferson thought in a language foreign to a republic. But good talk\r\nit was, and good dinners, we may be sure, even though the French Consul\r\ndid take his cook to Richmond Hill with the explanation that he had had\r\nexperience with New York dinners.[70] There was enough elegance at\r\nRichmond Hill to encourage the Adams coachman to put on airs that\r\noffended the groundlings as he drove through the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBut it was about the ‘court’ on Cherry Street that the interest of\r\nsociety centered. It was a plain brick mansion with five windows looking\r\nout on Cherry Street and as many on Franklin Square. The furniture was\r\nplain, and Madame Washington had sent by sea from Mount Vernon numerous\r\narticles of luxury and taste--pictures, vases, ornaments presented by\r\nEuropean admirers. Here the first President in the first days of the\r\nRepublic received visitors, gave dinners and receptions, consulted with\r\nhis Cabinet. The following year he moved to a more commodious house on\r\nBroadway below Trinity Church.\r\n\r\nThe great man had entered upon his physical decline when he assumed the\r\nPresidency, and many found him changed--‘pale, almost cadaverous,’ his\r\ndeportment ‘invariably grave,’ his sobriety barely stopping short of\r\nsadness. Even at Mrs. Washington’s drawing-rooms, when beautiful girls\r\nswarmed about him, his face never softened to a smile.[71] It is more\r\nthan probable that he was not a little bored by the artificial\r\nrestraints imposed upon him by his advisers on etiquette who had\r\naristocratic notions of the dignity of his position. Both Hamilton and\r\nAdams were responsible for planning his isolation from the people. Did\r\ncitizens seek a meeting? This was a matter for the chamberlain or\r\ngentleman-in-waiting. Should he give public entertainments? Not at\r\nall--only small dinners. Could he make calls? Very guardedly, and with\r\n‘few attendants,’ but formal visits should be reserved for the rare\r\noccasions when ‘an Emperor of Germany or some other sovereign should\r\ntravel in the country.’[72] Thus it came to pass that he found himself\r\nwith a ‘court chamberlain’ in the flamboyant Colonel Humphreys, who\r\nreveled in ceremony, and on one occasion moved Parson Weems’s perfect\r\nman to profanity.[73] When the erstwhile host of Fraunces Tavern was\r\nselected as the presiding deity of the kitchen, he appeared in the\r\npapers as ‘Steward of the Household.’[74] He too tried the great man’s\r\npatience and outraged his sense of economy by serving a shad early in\r\nthe season that had cost two dollars, and the royal fish was devoured by\r\nthe ‘Steward of the Household’ in the kitchen.[75]\r\n\r\nBut on state occasions the highfaluting notions of his advisers\r\nprevailed, and he rode forth in regal magnificence in the finest coach\r\never seen in America, a marvelous thing in shape and color, decorated\r\nwith cupids and festooned with flowers. Thus he lumbered through the\r\nstreets drawn by four horses except when driving to Federal Hall, when\r\nsix were necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd so they who dreamed of royal pomp were pleased with the progress\r\nmade, and at the dinner tables wagging tongues dwelt ecstatically on the\r\nadvantages of monarchical government, and Fenno’s ‘court journal’ began\r\nthe publication of ‘The Discourses of Davila,’ by the Vice-President.\r\nThus, when Jefferson arrived the following spring to meet society at the\r\ndinner tables, he was filled with ‘wonder and mortification’ to find\r\nthat ‘politics was the chief topic, and a preference for kingly over\r\nrepublican government ... evidently the favorite sentiment.’[76]\r\n\r\nBut we may be sure that no such sentiments were heard at the President’s\r\ndinners, which appear to have been dull, formal, and silent enough. No\r\nfault could be found with the food, drink, or service. Even the\r\ngout-pestered Maclay found one of these dinners ‘the best of the kind I\r\nwas ever at,’[77] and the more easily pleased Iredell was immensely\r\ndelighted with the wine.[78] But such silence, such solemnity! ‘The most\r\nsolemn dinner ever I sat at,’ wrote Maclay. ‘Not a health drank, scarce\r\na word said until the cloth was taken away.’ Then Washington filled his\r\nglass and solemnly drank to the health of each of his guests by name.\r\nThen ‘everybody imitated him, and such a buzz of “health, sir,” and\r\n“health, madame,” and “Thank you, sir,” and “Thank you, Madame,” never\r\nhad I heard before.’ Then another prolonged silence--and the ladies\r\nretired--and the dinner was over.[79] Months later, Maclay dined at the\r\nPresident’s again. ‘The President seemed to bear in his countenance a\r\nsettled aspect of melancholy,’ he wrote. ‘No cheering ray of convivial\r\nsunshine broke through the cloudy gloom of settled seriousness.’ The\r\ngreat man was evidently bored--much company forced upon him that he\r\nwould gladly have shunned. Cold, serious to melancholy, silent, he sat\r\nand ‘played on the table with a knife and fork like a drum stick.’ So it\r\nwas at the previous dinner when, retaining his fork as the cover was\r\nremoved, he ‘played with the fork, striking on the edge of the table\r\nwith it.’[80]\r\n\r\nHere we may leave him playing on the table with his fork, and turn to\r\nthe proceedings at Federal Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMadison soon verified his fear that few members of Congress could be\r\nrelied upon for constructive work. Then, as ever after, this fell to the\r\nindustrious few, of whom Madison himself was by odds the most dependable\r\nand wise. Petty ceremonies and formalities continued to disturb the\r\nserenity of some. When a member took exception to the reference in the\r\nminutes to a Presidential message as a ‘most gracious speech,’ as\r\nimitative of the parliamentary references to addresses from the throne,\r\nAdams was all but shocked to suffocation. As for himself he preferred ‘a\r\ndignified and respectable government,’ but the point was pressed and the\r\noffensive words erased.[81] Receiving a letter addressed to him as ‘His\r\nExcellency,’ Adams took the sense of the Senate on the propriety of\r\nopening it. Robert Morris dryly remarked that their Majesty, the people,\r\ncould write as they wished, and that crisis passed.[82] When a Bishop\r\nwas mentioned in the minutes as ‘Right Reverend,’ and Maclay snorted his\r\ndisapproval, Adams, in righteous wrath, informed him that ‘the\r\ngovernment will never be properly administered until titles are adopted\r\nin the fullest manner.’[83]\r\n\r\nBut all the while James Madison, constructive, profound, was seeking to\r\ndrag his colleagues of the divine afflatus from the clouds to the\r\nworking of the untilled field. Money was needed--more even than\r\ntitles--and precious time was being squandered. In an earnest appeal, he\r\nbegged for the postponement of the consideration of a permanent fiscal\r\nsystem in the hope of persuading the suppliants for tariff aid to wait\r\nawhile. But it was of no avail. Privilege entered the halls of Congress\r\nin the very beginning. When, at length, a measure was framed, the\r\nmerchants of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston made common cause to\r\nhold it back. They had ordered heavily in anticipation of such a law and\r\nwere determined to prevent its enactment until their goods arrived. The\r\nwhole thing smacked of scandal. The merchants had already added the\r\namount of the duties to the price of the goods on their shelves,\r\nincreasing their profits while depriving the Government of the\r\nnecessities of life. With the Government starving for revenue, the\r\nmercantile interest, with the aid of members, held it off until July\r\n4th, and then it was passed with the proviso that it should be\r\ninoperative until August 1st. Many, says a noted historian, thought this\r\n‘the first instance of a series in which the action of government turned\r\nin favor of the moneyed class.’[84]\r\n\r\nThe creation of the executive departments next called forth acrimonious\r\ndiscussions. Should the finances be in the hands of a man or a\r\ncommission? Where could be found a single man capable of such a task?\r\nThe Republic would be endangered were one man to have command of three\r\nor four millions. Then, too, the Cabinet was liable to be looked upon by\r\nthe President as of more consequence than the Senate. A system of\r\nfavoritism would be established, and oligarchy confirmed, the liberties\r\nof the people destroyed.[85] And the power of removal--who should\r\npossess that? Some wanted to lodge the power in the President, others in\r\nthe Senate. Madison favored the former.[86] But others could not see it\r\nthat way. What! exclaimed one statesman, give the power to the\r\nPresident? Why, ‘ministers would obtrude upon us to govern and direct\r\nthe measures of the legislature and support the influence of their\r\nmaster.’ A new Walpole would arise.[87] ‘Good God,’ cried another,\r\n‘authorize in a free republic ... by your first act, the exertion of a\r\ndangerous royal prerogative in your Chief Magistrate!’[88] The result\r\nwas the striking out of the authorization of the President to remove on\r\nthe ground that it was implied in the Constitution. Madison took this\r\nview, and it was to rise against him in his later battles with Hamilton\r\nover the implied powers.\r\n\r\nThis jealousy between the executive and legislative departments soon\r\nfound some justification in the action of Washington himself. It was\r\nlate in the summer of the first year that he appeared in the Senate with\r\nGeneral Knox to get ‘advice and consent’ to some propositions respecting\r\na treaty with the Southern Indians. With cold dignity he took his place\r\nbeside Adams, with Knox near at hand. The latter passed him a paper\r\nwhich he, in turn, gave to Adams, who began to read. The windows were up\r\nand the purport was all but lost in the rumble of carriages on Wall\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n‘Do you advise and consent?’ asked Adams.\r\n\r\nA Senator suggested that in a matter of importance new to the Senate, it\r\nwas the duty of Senators first to inform themselves. Storm-clouds\r\nappeared on the presidential countenance. Some one moved postponement of\r\naction on the first article, then the second--and third. Finally, the\r\nmotion was made that the whole be referred to a senatorial committee.\r\n\r\nUp Washington ‘started in a violent fret.’ The motion defeated the\r\npurpose of his coming. He had brought along the Secretary of War who\r\nknew all that it was necessary for the Senate to know. The reference to\r\nthe committee would mean delay and time was pressing. Then, making a\r\nvirtue of necessity, he agreed to the postponement, and withdrew ‘with\r\nsullen dignity.’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot be mistaken,’ wrote a Senator that evening in his\r\nboarding-house, ‘the President wishes to tread on the necks of the\r\nSenate. Commitment will bring the matter to discussion, at least in the\r\ncommittee, where he is not present. He wishes us to see with the eyes\r\nand hear with the ears of his Secretary only. The Secretary to advance\r\nthe premises, the President to draw the conclusions, and to bear down\r\nour deliberations with his personal authority and presence.... This will\r\nnot do with Americans.’[89]\r\n\r\nThis fear, accentuated by the incident referred to, was to grow into a\r\nconviction a little later, when a more domineering and masterful figure\r\nthan Washington or Knox appeared upon the scene. By many his advent had\r\nbeen eagerly awaited. To the leaders his identity was known, for the\r\ngenius of Alexander Hamilton as a financier had been established, and\r\nhis ambition was surmised.[90] His aspirations were supported by the\r\nmercantile interests generally, and the political forces they\r\ncontrolled. Even they who were to become his political enemies were\r\nfavorable to his selection--preferring him to John Jay, who was\r\nconsidered. There is something of irony in the letter written to\r\nJefferson by Madison to the effect that Hamilton was ‘best qualified for\r\nthat species of business, and on that account would be preferred by\r\nthose who know him personally.’[91]\r\n\r\nTo most he promised to be a successful administrator of finance, and\r\nonly the few among his intimates foresaw his rapid rise to the brilliant\r\nleadership of a powerful party. Certainly there could have been but few\r\nto take alarm on reading in the ‘Daily Advertiser’ on September 12,\r\n1789, the simple announcement of one of the most momentous events in the\r\npolitical history of the country:\r\n\r\n     The President of the United States has been pleased to make the\r\n     following nominations of Officers for the Department of the\r\n     Treasury:\r\n\r\n     Alexander Hamilton, Esq. of this city, Secretary.\r\n\r\n     Nicholas Everleigh, Esq. of South Carolina, Comptroller.\r\n\r\n     And the Senate of the United States having taken the said\r\n     nominations into consideration were pleased to advise and consent\r\n     to the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHAMILTON: A PORTRAIT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe genius for whom the Nation had been waiting, who walked briskly and\r\nwith a martial air[92] into the Treasury, and sat down at the almost\r\neffeminate mahogany desk with the women’s faces carved upon the legs, to\r\nbring order out of chaos, looked the leader. Not that he was of\r\ncommanding stature, for he was but five feet seven in height, with a\r\nfigure of almost boyish slimness. It was rather in his soldierly\r\nerectness and the dignity of his bearing that he impressed. If his\r\ncarriage suggested the camp, the meticulous care of his dress hinted of\r\nthe court, for he was something of an elegant in his attire. We have one\r\nstriking picture of him in a blue coat with bright buttons, the skirts\r\nunusually long, with a white waistcoat, black silk small-clothes, white\r\nsilk stockings;[93] another in fine lace ruffles.[94] It is quite\r\nimpossible to think of him as unfit for an instant summons to a court\r\nlevee or a ladies’ drawing-room, albeit Wolcott, who saw him first in\r\nhis office, thought him ‘a very amiable plain man.’[95] It was an age of\r\nfrills and fancies among the men of the aristocracy and his very\r\nconservatism would have dissuaded him from the slightest departure from\r\nthe conventions.\r\n\r\nIt was his head and features that denoted the commander. His\r\nwell-shaped, massive, and symmetrical head, with its reddish fair hair\r\nturned back from his forehead, powdered and collected in a queue behind,\r\nwas not so likely to attract attention as his pronounced features. These\r\nwere unique in that rarest of all combinations of beauty and strength.\r\nHe was handsome enough to be attractive to women, with his fair\r\ncomplexion and almost rosy cheeks, his well-moulded lips, and dark,\r\nalmost violet, deep-set eyes that could smile as sweetly and seductively\r\nas any gallant’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Hamilton_]\r\n\r\nAnd yet these lips could be firm and stern, and the soft, mirthful eyes\r\ncould freeze and flash. If women were to observe the softer nature, the\r\npoliticians were to note the man of relentless will disclosed in the\r\nfirm, strong jaw. Graceful and debonair, elegant and courtly, seductive\r\nand ingratiating, playful or impassioned, he could have fitted into the\r\npicture at the Versailles of Louis XV, or at the dinner table at Holland\r\nHouse. No one born in the atmosphere of courts could have looked the\r\npart more perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, such was his origin that the envious Adams could sneer at him\r\nas ‘the bastard brat of a Scotch pedlar,’[96] and it was not without\r\nreason that Gouverneur Morris, meditating his funeral oration, and his\r\n‘illegitimate birth,’ contrived a mode ‘to pass over this\r\nhandsomely.’[97] Even the sympathetic researches of Mrs. Atherton have\r\nfailed to lift the mystery of his origin and family. All we know is that\r\nhe was born of an irregular relation, without the intervention of the\r\nclergy,[98] between an unprosperous Scotch merchant of the West Indies\r\nand a brilliant and beautiful daughter of the French Huguenots. Even his\r\nparentage by the man named Hamilton was doubted, on circumstantial\r\nevidence, by so ardent a friend as Pickering, who thought he had found\r\nthe father in a physician.[99] Whoever the father--and the Pickering\r\nPapers are not convincing--there is no doubt that Hamilton inherited his\r\ngenius from his brilliant, passionate, high-strung mother.\r\n\r\nNor does the mystery end with his birth. Pickering was half persuaded\r\nthat the mother lived into the manhood of her son, but the church\r\nrecords at Saint Kitts bear out the claims of the family that she died\r\nin 1768. It is not easy to account for the rather morbid relations later\r\nbetween Hamilton and his father and brother. Both appear to have been a\r\nworthless sort. For years Hamilton was ignorant of his father’s\r\nwhereabouts, which does not appear to have bothered him much.[100] Later\r\nthere was some correspondence looking to a possible reunion in America,\r\nout of which nothing came.[101] At intervals money passed from the great\r\nman in America to the indigent old man in the West Indies,[102] but at\r\nno time does it appear that Hamilton had any thought of visiting his\r\nfather in the isle of his childhood. It was a long cry from the squalid\r\nlife in the West Indies to Mrs. Bingham’s drawing-room, and the genius\r\nturned his back upon the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so inexplicable in this amazing man as the precocity of\r\nhis genius. There is a suggestion of it in the younger Pitt, but he had\r\nsat from infancy at the feet of Chatham. To the easy-going natives of\r\nhis natal isle this passionate, fiery-tempered, supersensitive boy,\r\ndreaming of power, must have seemed an exotic. As a mere child he\r\nappeared to sense that his field of conquest lay across the sea. He was\r\nplanning a career while his companions were absorbed in childish games.\r\nHis early range of knowledge and reading was remarkable. In his passion\r\nfor literature he was unconsciously moulding one of the weapons for his\r\nsuccessful assault on fame; through the pages of Plutarch he was lifting\r\nhimself above the drab slothful surroundings to the companionship of the\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nSometimes fate was serving his destiny when he felt himself a captive\r\nbeating against his cage. Thus, in the counting-room at Santa Cruz he\r\nwas mastering business methods and absorbing the commercial spirit on\r\nwhich he was later to predicate his philosophy of government.[103] The\r\nbusiness letters he wrote were preparations for the framing of his\r\n‘Report on the Public Credit.’ Even then it was a peculiarity of his\r\ngenius that he could write on business matters without clipping the\r\nwings of his fancy. He seemed born with a mastery of words, a rare gift\r\nof expression. When a hurricane swept the islands the description he\r\nwrote for a paper became the talk of the West Indies. Only a little\r\nwhile before he was rebelling against the ‘groveling ambition of a\r\nclerk,’ and passionately writing that he ‘would willingly risk his life\r\nbut not his character to elevate his station.’ These were the aspirings\r\nof a boy not yet thirteen. ‘I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was\r\na war.’ Here we have a vivid light upon his character.[104]\r\n\r\nThe description of the hurricane made his fortune. Dreaming of rising by\r\nthe sword, it was his pen that rallied friends who raised the money to\r\nsend him to America for an education. Through all his days he was to\r\naspire to glory through the sword, little knowing that he was winning\r\nimmortality with his pen.\r\n\r\nThe Little Corsican touching the soil of France, the little West Indian\r\nlanding in America--there is a striking analogy: both dreaming of\r\nmartial glory in the land of strangers; both obsessed with a morbid\r\nambition sustained by the rarest powers of application.\r\n\r\nThe records of the years preceding the Revolution are but vague, though\r\nwe get glimpses of the genius forging his weapons in the boy at the\r\ngrammar school at Elizabethtown poring over books till midnight, to rise\r\nat dawn to continue his studies in the quiet of a near-by cemetery;\r\npracticing prose composition; writing an elegy on the death of a lady;\r\ncomposing the prologue and the epilogue of a play,[105] and, at Kings\r\nCollege (Columbia), amazing his companions by the energy of his mind,\r\nand puzzling pedestrians by talking to himself as he walked for hours\r\neach day under the great trees of Batteau (Dey) Street.[106] Here, too,\r\nan occasional display of the eloquence of maturity, enriched by the glow\r\nof genius, set him apart.\r\n\r\nThen came the Revolution. ‘I wish there was a war!’ cried the boy of\r\nthirteen. And war came to find the lad of nineteen as eager to seize its\r\nopportunities as was the Corsican youth when ordered to clear the\r\nstreets of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe war was to prove his genius, not as a soldier, but as a writer and\r\nconstructive thinker on governmental matters. He was a natural\r\njournalist and pamphleteer--one of the fathers of the American\r\neditorial. His perspicacity, penetration, powers of condensation, and\r\nclarity of expression were those of a premier editorial writer. These\r\nsame qualities made him a pamphleteer without a peer. That he would have\r\nshone with equal luster in the reportorial room of a modern paper is\r\nshown in his description of the hurricane, and in his letter to Laurens\r\npicturing vividly the closing hours of Major André.[107] From the moment\r\nhe created a sensation, with ‘A Farmer Refuted,’ in his eighteenth year,\r\nuntil, in the closing months of his life, he was meeting Coleman\r\nsurreptitiously in the night to dictate vigorous editorials for the New\r\nYork ‘Evening Post’ he had established,[108] he recognized his power. No\r\nman ever complained more bitterly of the attacks of the press; none ever\r\nused the press more liberally and relentlessly to attack.\r\n\r\nIn ‘A Farmer Refuted,’ the maturity of the thought, the severity of the\r\nreasoning, the vigor of the onslaught, the familiarity with history and\r\ngovernmental processes displayed, denoted the hand of one seasoned in\r\ncontroversy. The sprightliness, wit, humor, sarcasm, suggested more than\r\ntalent. The evident joy in the combat, with the air of assurance, was\r\nthat of the fighter unafraid. These are the qualities that were to run\r\nthrough all of Hamilton’s literary work. Nowhere in the literature of\r\ninvective is there anything more vitriolic than the attack on a war\r\nspeculator and profiteer, under the signature of ‘Publius.’[109] This\r\ntendency to bitter invective will appear, as we proceed, in Hamilton’s\r\nattacks on Jefferson and Adams.\r\n\r\nBut usually he appealed to reason, and then he was at his best. Thus, in\r\n‘The Continentalist,’ urging a more perfect union and a more potent\r\ngovernment, and in his letter to James Duer,[110] we are impressed with\r\nthe writer’s intimate knowledge of conditions, his constructive\r\ninstinct, his vision.[111] And thus, especially do these appear in ‘The\r\nFederalist’--one of the most brilliant contributions to the literature\r\nof political science in the world’s history. It will be impossible to\r\ncomprehend the genius of Hamilton, his domination of his party, and his\r\npower, despite his unpopularity with the masses, without a foreknowledge\r\nof his force with the pen. It was his scepter and his sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHis power as an orator was unsurpassed in any assembly that called it\r\nforth, but with very few exceptions he did not appear before the\r\nmultitude. He swayed the leaders and won them to his leadership. There\r\nwas little of fancy in his speeches, scarcely any appeal to the\r\nemotions, but he spoke with enthusiasm and an intensity of conviction.\r\nForce, clearness, fire--‘logic on fire’--and a rapid fusillade of\r\nimpressively directed facts--with these he usually swept all before\r\nhim. The comparatively few speeches which have come down to us fail to\r\nexplain his power. The stories of audiences moved to tears are scarcely\r\nin keeping with the absence of the slightest attempts at pathos or\r\nappeals to the emotions. Kent, who heard him in court, recalled, long\r\nafter Hamilton was dead, ‘the clear, elegant and fluent style, and\r\ncommanding manner.’[112] Physically, he was far from imposing, but it is\r\neasy to imagine the virility of his manner, the flash of his conqueror’s\r\neye. In the New York Convention called to pass on the Constitution, it\r\nwas the force and persuasiveness of his arguments that converted a\r\nhostile majority. Later Congress was to refuse him permission to present\r\npersonally his reports on the ground that he might unduly sway its\r\njudgment; and Jefferson was to resent his interminable and passionate\r\n‘harangues’ in the Cabinet room. But these exhibitions of his eloquence\r\nadvanced his political career by impressing the leaders with the\r\nbrilliancy of his intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt is significant that, while he was not vain of his power as a writer\r\nand orator, he lived and died firmly convinced of his genius as a\r\nsoldier. In the earliest of his letters we have his longing for a war.\r\nHis son and biographer was impressed with the fact that, ‘while arms\r\nseemed to be his predominant passion, the world was at peace.’[113] He\r\nnever faced the prospect of a war without seeing an opportunity for\r\ndistinction. At a time when he abhorred the French Revolution, and all\r\nassociated with it, he wrote of Napoleon as ‘that unequalled conqueror,\r\nfrom whom it is painful to detract.’[114]\r\n\r\nWas he a military genius? We have nothing on which to base a judgment.\r\nIn the Revolution we see him attracting the attention of Washington by\r\nhis military alertness on the heights of Harlem. At Monmouth we see his\r\nhorse shot under him as he dashes into the fray with a recklessness that\r\nlooked to the commander like a courting of death. Throughout his\r\nservices in the military household of Washington, where he became all\r\nbut indispensable in a secretarial capacity and in diplomacy, he chafed\r\nunder the conviction that his place was in a position of command. One of\r\nhis friends declared that ‘the pen of our army was held by Hamilton;\r\nand for dignity of manner, pith of matter, and elegance of style,\r\nGeneral Washington’s letters are unrivaled in military annals,’ but the\r\nyouthful Hamilton felt that he should have been the army’s sword.[115]\r\nThe vision of the renown of the military conqueror was ever before him.\r\nThe war was an opportunity for glory, and he was missing it. ‘I\r\nexplained to you candidly my feelings in respect to military\r\nreputation,’ he wrote Washington when seeking a separate command, ‘and\r\nhow much it was my object to act a conspicuous part in some enterprise\r\nthat might perhaps raise my character as a soldier above\r\nmediocrity.’[116] At Yorktown he took desperate chances in an effort for\r\nrenown.[117] We shall find him leaving the Treasury to command soldiers\r\nsent to put down the western insurrection, with no possible occasion for\r\nit beyond his preference for the saddle and the sword. And when war with\r\nFrance loomed large, we shall find him resorting to importunity and\r\nintrigue to get the command over the protest of the President.\r\n\r\nWas Hamilton a Napoleon? He thought himself of the race of military\r\nmasters. He had the courage, the coolness under fire, and the audacity,\r\nbut nothing that he did disclosed more genius than was shown by Aaron\r\nBurr. Had the chance come, he might have justified his own high\r\npretensions as a military genius--but it did not come. He died with his\r\nboyhood ambition to command great armies unrealized--and undimmed.[118]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHis association of a strong military establishment with a strong and\r\nstable government was due in large measure to his temperament. He was\r\nessentially an aristocrat. From the moment of his arrival in America, he\r\ncultivated only the élite. His most partisan biographer has painted his\r\nportrait in a sentence--‘His sympathies were always aristocratic, and he\r\nwas born with a reverence for tradition.’[119] There is nothing more\r\ncontradictory in his career than the lowliness of his origin and his\r\ninherent passion for the lofty. This charity student moved in mansions\r\nas to the manor born. He had lived on terms of comparative intimacy with\r\nthe aristocratic Washington of the camp, with Lafayette who brought\r\nsomething of the flavor of Old World aristocracy, and he married into\r\none of the proudest of the manorial families, but his love of grandeur\r\nwas inherent. He luxuriated in elegant society and fine houses, loved\r\nfine laces as an adornment, and, without having ever seen the interior\r\nof a gallery, at least affected a partiality for the fine arts,\r\ncollecting such prints as his purse permitted, painting some himself,\r\nand advising Mrs. Washington in the purchase of paintings.[120]\r\n\r\nHis ideal of government was the rule of ‘gentlemen’--the domination of\r\naristocrats; on the theory that these, with a certain prestige to\r\nmaintain, were more jealous of their honor and above the vulgar\r\nstrivings for mere place.[121] Thus it was impossible for him to\r\nconceive of a strong and capable government over which the aristocracy\r\ndid not have sway.[122] Long before the Constitutional Convention we\r\nfind him writing Morris on financial matters, setting forth the\r\nimportance of creating an alliance between government and men of\r\nwealth.[123] One of his most enthusiastic panegyrists has illustrated\r\nhis ideal: ‘The nearest approach to it is the popular conception of the\r\nempire of Japan--a mass of intelligent humanity, reckless of their\r\nlives, yet filled with the joy of life, eager for distinction, hungry\r\nfor success, alert, practical, and merry; but at the same time\r\nsubordinate, humbly and piously subordinate, to a pure\r\nabstraction.’[124] But this abstraction had to be aristocracy--never\r\ndemocracy; for he believed that democracy could only lead to\r\nanarchy.[125] Temperamentally hostile to democracy in the beginning,\r\nmaintaining that attitude to the end, he never appreciated and always\r\ndespised public opinion, and in 1794 he frankly confessed to Washington\r\nthat he ‘long since learned to hold public opinion of no value.’[126]\r\nThis distrust of the people, contempt for democracy, and reliance on\r\nstrong government supported by wealth, and, if need be, sustained by\r\nstanding armies, were carried by him into the Constitutional Convention\r\nand there proclaimed with all the tremendous force of his personality.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nUnless we divest ourselves of the Hamiltonian myths in reference to the\r\nConstitution, an intelligent comprehension of his political character\r\nwill be impossible. We must rid ourselves of the fallacious notion that\r\nhe was satisfied with the Constitution or believed it adequate. No one\r\ncontributed more mightily to making the Constitutional Convention\r\npossible. In the preliminary convention at Annapolis, no one did more to\r\ncrystallize sentiment for it, and it was his persuasive pen that wrote\r\nthe history-making address there determined upon. About his dining-table\r\nin New York he did yeoman service in coaxing skeptical and reluctant\r\nmembers of Congress to call a convention. There, under a simulation of\r\ngayety, his eloquence and wit and banter made converts of the most\r\nstubborn--a service of immeasurable value.[127]\r\n\r\nBut in the Convention itself he played no such part as is popularly\r\nascribed to him. After the presentation of his own plan in the early\r\nstages, he played an inconspicuous part, and much of the time he was not\r\nonly absent from the Convention, but out of the State. This was not\r\nbecause of indifference to the event, but to a realization that he could\r\naccomplish nothing for his plan.[128]\r\n\r\nThis plan was a direct contradiction of that which was adopted. There is\r\nnothing conjectural about that fact--the records are indisputable. We\r\nhave the plan, the brilliant five-hour oration in its behalf, the brief\r\nfrom which he spoke. These have come down to us, not from his enemies,\r\nbut from his partial biographers, his son the editor of his ‘Works,’ and\r\nthe report of Madison on the authenticity of which he himself passed.\r\nThis plan provided for the election of a President for life; for\r\nSenators for life or during good behavior, and by electors with a\r\nproperty qualification; and for the crushing of the sovereignty of\r\nStates through the appointment by the President of Governors with a life\r\ntenure and the power to veto any act of the State legislatures, though\r\npassed unanimously. Not only was the President enabled under this plan\r\nto negative any law enacted, but he had the discretionary power to\r\nenforce or ignore any law existing.[129] Though his President, serving\r\nfor life, was not called a king, he was to be armed with more arbitrary\r\npower than was possessed by the King of England. His English eulogist\r\ndoes not overstate when he says that ‘what he had in mind was the\r\nBritish Constitution as George III had tried hard to make it,’ and\r\nfailed because the English people would not tolerate it.[130] This\r\ninterpretation of Hamilton’s purpose is reënforced by another of his\r\nmost brilliant disciples who asserts that ‘Hamilton’s governor\r\n[President] would have been not dissimilar to Louis XIV and could have\r\nsaid with him, “L’état c’est moi.” ... Thinly veiled, his plan[131]\r\ncontemplated an elective king with greater powers than those of George\r\nIII, an imitation House of Lords, and a popular House of Commons with a\r\nlimited tenure.’[132] Even so this plan confessedly fell far short of\r\nhis conception of an ideal government. In the brief for his speech[133]\r\nwe are left in no doubt as to his partiality for a monarchy, in which\r\nthe aristocracy should have a special power. ‘The monarch ... ought to\r\nbe hereditary, and to have so much power that it would not be his\r\ninterest to risk much to acquire more.’ As for the aristocracy, ‘they\r\nshould be so circumstanced that they can have no interest in a\r\nchange.’[134] We should be ‘rescued from the democracy.’[135] As to the\r\nrepublican form of government--‘Republics are liable to corruption and\r\nintrigue,’[136] and, since ‘a republican government does not admit of a\r\nvigorous execution, it is therefore bad.’[137]\r\n\r\nLater, in one of his few discussions, he said that ‘those who mean to\r\nform a solid republican government ought to proceed to the confines of\r\nanother government.’[138] His republic, and in his great speech he had\r\nconceded that no other form would be accepted by the people, ‘was to be\r\nan aristocratic as distinguished from a democratic republic, and the\r\npower of the separate States was to be effectually crippled.’[139] In\r\none of his brief Convention talks he said of the States that ‘as States\r\nhe thought they should be abolished.’[140] Even after the Constitution\r\nhad been adopted, he believed that one of the objects of administration\r\nshould be ‘to acquire for the federal government more consistency than\r\nthe Constitution seems to promise for so great a country,’ to the end\r\nthat it ‘may triumph altogether over the state governments and reduce\r\nthem to an utter subordination, dividing the large States into simpler\r\ndistricts.’[141] Such were the ideas urged by Hamilton in the forceful\r\nfive-hour speech which Gouverneur Morris thought the most brilliant\r\nintellectual exhibition he had ever witnessed. After this exhaustive\r\nexposition, he took but little part. Toward the close he explained his\r\ncomparative silence: ‘He had been restrained from entering into the\r\ndiscussions by his dislike of the scheme of government in general.’[142]\r\nThis distaste did not diminish as the Convention closed its labors, and\r\nhe accepted the Constitution in the end ‘as better than nothing.’[143]\r\nHis motive for joining in recommending it to the people is conclusively\r\nshown in his last Convention utterance: ‘No man’s ideas are more remote\r\nfrom the plan than my own are known to be; but is it possible to\r\ndeliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side, and the chance of\r\ngood to be expected from the plan on the other?’[144]\r\n\r\nNor did he ever lose faith in his own plan, or gain confidence in the\r\nConstitution which was adopted.[145] Just before retiring from the\r\nCabinet he avowed himself a monarchist who had ‘no objections to a trial\r\nbeing made of this thing of a republic.’[146] Two years before his death\r\nhe wrote bitterly to Morris of his support of a Constitution in which he\r\nhad never had faith ‘from the beginning,’ in which he described it as ‘a\r\nfrail and worthless fabric.’[147] And the night of his death, when his\r\nbosom friend and confidant was meditating the funeral oration he was to\r\ndeliver on the steps of Trinity Church, he wrote in his diary, ‘He was\r\nin principle opposed to republican and attached to monarchical\r\ngovernment, but then his opinions were generally known and have been\r\nlong and loudly proclaimed. His share in the forming of our Constitution\r\nmust be mentioned, and his unfavorable opinion cannot therefore be\r\nconcealed.’[148]\r\n\r\nIf, however, he was a tremendous factor in making any Constitutional\r\nConvention possible, he was to be even more essential in securing the\r\nratification of the document he disliked--and it is here that he rises\r\nto the pinnacle of patriotic statesmanship, and earns the eternal\r\ngratitude of the Republic. When on that summer day, on a packet floating\r\nlazily down the Hudson, he subordinated his personal preferences to the\r\npublic good, and sat down to the writing of the first number of ‘The\r\nFederalist,’ he reached the very acme of his greatness. Had he done\r\nnothing else, his fame would have been as eternal as the Nation he\r\nhelped to make. Thus does he take his rightful place among the greatest\r\nnation-builders of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe qualities of strength and weakness accounting for the successes and\r\nfailures of his political leadership are easily found in an analysis of\r\nhis character. As is true of most genius, his was three fourths hard\r\nwork. From his earliest boyhood he had learned the value of system.\r\nNothing was permitted to disturb the programme by which he regulated his\r\ndays and nights. We may surmise that he was his own most relentless\r\ntaskmaster from the rules he wrote for the guidance of his favorite son.\r\nThis almost monastic schedule denotes the system by which he governed\r\nhis own life.[149] He never completed his education, and the exactions\r\nof politics and his profession never made him a stranger to his library.\r\nHere, surrounded by his family, he ministered to an insatiable mind.\r\nNever tiring of the classics, he kept pace with the printing-press, and\r\nMrs. Church rummaged about the book-stalls of London to supply him with\r\nall the new worth-while publications. Thus the ‘Wealth of Nations’ was\r\nin his hands as soon after its appearance as a boat could cross the\r\nsea.[150] His manner of study was intensive, absorbing, and he fairly\r\nlashed his mind and memory to their allotted tasks. Walking the floor\r\nwhile reading and studying, it was a comment of his friends that with\r\nequal exertion he could have walked from one end of the country to the\r\nother.[151]\r\n\r\nQuite as remarkable as the intensity of his application was his abnormal\r\ncapacity for sustained exertion. He thought nothing of sitting over a\r\npaper ‘until the dawn dimmed his candles.’[152] Talleyrand’s comment on\r\nfinding lights in his office in the early morning is famous. It was not\r\nunusual for him to ponder a problem long and earnestly until he had\r\nthought it through, then to retire to sleep regardless of the hour of\r\nthe night, and after a while to arise, refresh himself with a cup of\r\nstrong coffee, seat himself at his table, and work on with great\r\nrapidity for six, seven, or eight hours without rest. The resulting\r\nproduct of his pen was so perfect, we are assured, such was his felicity\r\nof expression, that it seldom required revision.[153]\r\n\r\nThis tenacity was one of the factors in his leadership. He was never a\r\nfair-weather fighter. Opposition only whetted his appetite for battle.\r\nNor was he easily discouraged. Explaining to a friend who wished to\r\ncarry the news to New York of the situation in the Poughkeepsie\r\nConvention, that the members stood two to one against the ratification\r\nof the Constitution, he concluded with grim emphasis: ‘Tell them the\r\nConvention shall never rise until the Constitution is adopted.’[154]\r\n\r\nAlong with this tenacity, he had an illimitable moral courage which made\r\nit easy for him to fight for a cause without counting the cost. The real\r\nHamilton is seen in his defense of the persecuted Tories at the close of\r\nthe Revolution; in his fighting his way through a mob eager for the\r\nblood of the Tory president of Columbia College to hold it at bay with\r\nhis indignant eloquence; in his letter to Jay against the destruction of\r\nthe notorious Rivington Press by a mob.[155] This reverence for law and\r\nthe constituted authority was the mainspring of his political character,\r\nand he always had the moral courage to stand for both when cowardice\r\nwould have recommended compromise.\r\n\r\nTo these qualities must be added another which gave character to his\r\nleadership--he was personally honest. Called to a station where he might\r\neasily have enriched himself, as did many of his friends, he retired to\r\nprivate life poorer than when he entered the public service. Small\r\nwonder that Talleyrand was astounded at such disinterestedness and\r\nrestraint. There was no affectation in his letter lamenting his\r\ninability to succor some immigrants from France. ‘I wish I was a Crœsus;\r\nI might then afford solid consolation to these children of adversity,\r\nand how delightful it would be to do so. But now, sympathy, kind words,\r\nand occasionally a dinner are all that I can contribute.’ And at the\r\ntime he wrote great fortunes had been built on the financial system he\r\nhad created. So impeccable was he in this regard that his great\r\npolitical protagonist, writing an estimate of his character in the calm\r\nof his closet, recorded him as ‘disinterested, honest and honorable in\r\nall private transactions.’[156] Profound as a thinker, exhaustive as a\r\nstudent, moving in eloquence, powerful with the pen, logical in his\r\nreasoning, constructive in his methods, tenacious in the advancement of\r\nhis plans, possessed of the courage of his convictions, personally\r\nhonest in public and private action, he possessed qualities of\r\nleadership that drew high-minded men about, and to, him. But he\r\nunhappily had the weakness of his strength that was to operate\r\ndisastrously upon his political fortunes. It is impossible to understand\r\nhis ultimate failure as a leader without a reference to his\r\ntemperamental deficiencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAs a party leader he was singularly lacking in tact, offensively\r\nopinionated,[157] impatient and often insulting to well-meaning\r\nmediocrity, and dictatorial. He did not consult--he directed. He did not\r\nconciliate--he commanded. In the Cabinet he was to offend Jefferson\r\nearly because Hamilton ‘could not rid himself of the idea that he was\r\nreally the prime minister.’[158] It was not diplomatic to order Adams\r\nback to his post of duty in Philadelphia in the manner of one addressing\r\na subordinate. Nor was it considerate to write to McHenry, who adored\r\nhim, and was doing the best his limited ability would permit: ‘Pray take\r\na resolution adequate to the emergency and rescue the credit of your\r\ndepartment.’[159] These outbursts of impatience and this intolerance of\r\nweakness were forgiven by the strong, but treasured against him by\r\nsmaller and more envious minds, and the time was to come when, with his\r\nfield marshals loyal, he was to have few colonels and captains, and\r\npractically no privates. He was a failure in the management of men, and\r\nonly his superior genius made it possible for him to dominate so long.\r\n\r\nThere was much of egotism and some vanity behind this dictatorial\r\ndisposition. This was inherent and incurable. The lowliness of his\r\norigin, the phenomenal rapidity of his rise, the homage properly paid\r\nhim for the brilliancy of his youthful efforts with voice, pen, and\r\nsword, all tended to convince him of his superiority. No one knew or\r\nlamented his egotism more than men who loved him. Morris went weeping\r\nfrom his death-bed to write his intimate opinion in his diary that he\r\nwas ‘vain and opinionated.’[160] Cabot, who clung to him like a lover,\r\nwrote him frankly: ‘I am bound to tell you that you are accused by\r\nrespectable men of egotism.’[161] A descendant and biographer concedes\r\nhis vanity, taking issue with Hamilton’s son who had foolishly, but\r\nnaturally, denied it in his biography.[162] His self-sufficiency is\r\nevident in his letter to Laurens: ‘It is my desire to preserve myself\r\nfree from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent\r\nof the caprices of others.’[163] But were we without these confessions\r\nfrom his friends, we should find them in his letters. What more amazing\r\nand amusing than his letter to Schuyler explaining with gusto and some\r\nswagger his quarrel with Washington.[164] Even at the age of\r\ntwenty-three and while serving in a secretarial capacity to one of the\r\nforemost figures of all time, he was placing himself on an equality at\r\nleast with Washington and writing glibly of ‘what we owed to each\r\nother.’ This spirit of self-exaltation was to drive many of the minor\r\nleaders of his party from him, and to lead him, in the end, to the\r\nsupreme folly of his pamphlet attack on Adams which was hopelessly to\r\ncripple, if not completely destroy, his influence.\r\n\r\nEven more serious than his flamboyant egotism was his queer lack of\r\njudgment in the handling of men. It was an irreparable blunder to force\r\nthe election of his father-in-law to the Senate from New York over\r\nChancellor Livingston who had superior claims. It was a temporary\r\ntriumph that drove one of the most powerful families in the State into\r\nthe ranks of his enemies.[165] Only the most execrable taste can pardon\r\nthe undignified writing of anonymous attacks on a colleague of the\r\nCabinet.[166] His blunder in the case of the Schuyler election could be\r\nexcused by his lack of political experience, but his most sympathetic\r\nbiographer admits that ‘middle age instead of ripening his judgment,\r\nwarped it.’[167] His was a nature of eternal youth, and in many respects\r\nthe indiscretions of boyish exuberance cursed him to the end.\r\n\r\nIf these personal weaknesses were to weaken him with the leaders of the\r\nsecond rank, his unpopularity with the rank and file was to come from\r\nhis lack of sympathy for, and understanding of, the American spirit. No\r\none realized it more than he. In justice it must be said that he\r\nhonestly tried to suppress his doubts of America; but in moments of\r\ndepression he burst forth with expressions that bear the marks of long\r\nincubation. ‘Am I a fool--a romantic Quixote--or is there a\r\nconstitutional defect in the American mind?’ he wrote King. ‘Were it not\r\nfor yourself and a few others I would adopt the reveries of De Paux, as\r\nsubstantial truths, and could say with him that there is something in\r\nour climate which belittles every animal, human or brute.’[168] And\r\ntoward the close of his life he wrote Morris: ‘Every day proves to me\r\nmore and more that this American world was not made for me. You, friend\r\nMorris, are a native of this country, but by genius an exotic. You\r\nmistake if you fancy that you are more of a favorite than myself, or\r\nthat you are in any sort upon a theatre suited to you.’[169] This touch\r\nof the exotic, of which he himself was painfully conscious, was not lost\r\nupon his political enemies. ‘Thus ignorant of the character of this\r\nnation, of Pennsylvania, and of his own city and State of New York, was\r\nAlexander Hamilton,’ wrote Adams.[170] But it was left for another to\r\n‘discover the real secret of his confusion as to the American\r\ncharacter--he had never known the spirit, or had the training, of the\r\nNew England town meeting.[171] A marvelous genius, he thought in terms\r\nof world politics at a time when America was creating a new spirit and\r\nsystem of her own. It was not to weaken his work as the creator of\r\ncredit, but it was to dim his vision as an American leader.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIf he possessed traits that made him thoroughly hated by some, he had\r\nother qualities that bound his friends to him with bonds of steel. He\r\ncommanded affection because he was himself affectionate. His letters to\r\nhis wife were uniformly tender and playful. He was idolized by his\r\nchildren. His comrades in the army loved him because he not only shared\r\ntheir hardships, but at times helped them to necessities out of his own\r\nall but empty pockets. He was sensitive to the sufferings of many\r\nrefugees in Philadelphia and New York, and he would often direct his\r\nwife to send money and delicacies to the women and children.[172] We\r\nhave many instances of his generosity, like his attempt to spare Andre\r\nthe humiliation of the scaffold, and his letter to Knox protesting\r\nagainst the execution of British officers in retaliation for the murder\r\nof an American.[173] Among the young French officers he was idolized\r\nbecause of his merry disposition and the cleverness and brilliancy of\r\nhis conversation. While prone to hold aloof from the mass, he was a\r\n‘good fellow’ among those whom he considered his social equals. In\r\nsocial assemblies of both sexes he fairly sparkled with boyish\r\nenthusiasm.[174] In stag affairs, where he was immensely popular, we may\r\nbe sure that he was nothing of a prude. It is not of record that he\r\noften drank to excess, but like most men of his time he loved his wine,\r\nand we have it on the best authority that he sometimes took a wee bit\r\ntoo much.[175] On these convivial occasions he could always be prevailed\r\nupon to sing his one and only song:\r\n\r\n    ‘We’re going to war, and when we die\r\n     We’ll want a man of God near by,\r\n     So bring your Bible and follow the drum.’\r\n\r\nHis one serious weakness was an inordinate fondness for women which was\r\nto involve him in the one serious scandal of his career. It was McHenry\r\nwho wrote to Pickering, another friend: ‘Far be it from me to attempt to\r\npalliate his pleasures, the indulgence in which Mr. Hamilton himself\r\npublicly lamented.’[176] It was Otis who wrote of his ‘liquorish\r\nflirtation’ with a married woman at a fashionable dinner party.[177] It\r\nwas Lodge who, in touching on his overpowering passions, refers to his\r\n‘relations, which had an unenviable notoriety.’[178] It is Oliver who\r\nsays that ‘his private shortcomings cannot be denied,’[179] and that\r\n‘in private life Hamilton was not always vigilant.’[180] It is the\r\nhistorian of ‘The Republican Court’ who records that ‘it is true that\r\nHamilton was something of a roué.’[181] And it was reserved for a\r\ndescendant to remind us of the story of the alleged relations with the\r\ncelebrated Madame Jumel, who, in old age, made an unsuccessful attempt\r\nto live with Aaron Burr,[182] and of the gossip, which he discredits,\r\nthat his relations with his sprightly sister-in-law, Mrs. Church, were\r\nmore tender than they should have been.[183] This same descendant,\r\nwriting with professional authority, explains these moral delinquencies\r\non the theory that, like other men of genius and great intelligence, he\r\nwas prone to ‘impulsively plunge into the underworld in obedience to\r\nsome strange promptings of their lower nature.’[184]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, such are the strange inconsistencies of the\r\ntemperamental--nothing could have been more beautiful than his home\r\nlife. His endearing traits are evident in the passionate devotion of all\r\nwho knew the Hamilton of the hearth. If the ties that bound Angelica\r\nChurch to him were not more tender than they should have been, her\r\nletters indicate something akin to love.[185] His wife, who must have\r\nsuffered tortures over the confessions of the Reynolds pamphlet, clung\r\nto him with a faith born perhaps of an understanding of how much he must\r\nhave resisted. If he sometimes broke his vows, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the shrine of his heart was at his hearth.\r\n\r\n‘Colonel Beckwith tells me that our dear Hamilton writes too much and\r\ntakes no exercise, and grows fat,’ wrote Angelica Church to Mrs.\r\nHamilton from London. ‘I hate both the word and the thing, and I desire\r\nyou to take care of his health, and his good looks.’[186] Here we have\r\nthe suggestion of another frailty which makes all the more notable the\r\nintensity of his sustained efforts and the magnitude of his\r\nachievements--the delicacy of his health. The first, and possibly the\r\nlast, medical service rendered by McHenry on becoming a member of\r\nWashington’s military family was to prescribe for Hamilton and make\r\nsuggestions as to his diet. Early in the war he who was never robust\r\ncontracted a malarial infection from which he suffered every summer\r\nthroughout his life.[187] His correspondence is sprinkled throughout\r\nwith references to his health.[188] While in no sense an invalid, the\r\nmagnitude and multiplicity of his labors despite a chronic physical\r\ndisability measure the power of mind over matter and indicate something\r\nof his unyielding will.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIn view of the sincere or simulated interest in religion shown by\r\nHamilton where political interests were involved, it would be\r\ninteresting to know just what he thought and felt. The records here are\r\nslight. During his youth he passed through the period of religious\r\nexaltation not uncommon in the average life. Not only was he attentive\r\nto public worship, but he prayed fervently and with eloquence in the\r\nseclusion of his room.[189] About this time he wrote a hymn, ‘A Soul\r\nEntering into Bliss,’ which is said to have had some literary\r\nmerit.[190] We hear no more concerning his religious fervor for many\r\nyears until he pretended, if he did not feel, an intense indignation\r\nagainst the revolutionary reaction aimed at the church establishment in\r\nFrance. He was shocked that ‘equal pains have been taken to deprave the\r\nmorals as to extinguish the religion of the country.’[191]\r\n\r\nA few years more, and, with the fall of his party, he outlined to Bayard\r\na ‘Plan of Conduct’ for Federalists with a view to its rehabilitation,\r\nand proposed an association to be denominated ‘The Christian\r\nConstitutional Society,’ having for its objects ‘the support of the\r\nChristian Religion’ and ‘the support of the Constitution.’[192] This\r\nhints strongly of the Old World idea of the union of Church and State.\r\nIn Connecticut the clergy had been the shock troops of Federalism, and\r\nit is quite possible that the political advantage of an alliance between\r\nthe Church and his party appealed to Hamilton.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he was a member of no church. One of his descendants\r\nassures us that ‘he was a man of earnest, simple faith, quite\r\nunemotional in this respect, so far as display was concerned, but his\r\nbelief was very strong.’[193] Strong as it was, it never led him to the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nLeaving his idol’s death-bed, Oliver Wolcott wrote his wife that\r\n‘Colonel H. in late years expressed his conviction of the truths of the\r\nChristian Religion, and his desire to receive the Sacrament--but no one\r\nof the clergy who have yet been consulted will administer it.’[194] At\r\nlength, life ebbing away, a bishop consented after being earnestly\r\nsolicited the second time. Thus in his dying hour, Hamilton declared:\r\n‘It has for some time past been the wish of my heart, and it was my\r\nintention to take an early opportunity of uniting myself to the church.’\r\nThe natural deduction from the meager information we have is that his\r\nintensive political and professional activities and consuming ambitions\r\ngave him little time to meditate on religion. He certainly never gave it\r\nthe consideration of his greatest political opponent whom his party\r\nattacked as an enemy of Christianity. But he used the Church, whenever\r\npossible, to advance his political views--and with effect.\r\n\r\nQuite as problematical as his religious feeling was his attitude toward\r\nWashington. It was the policy of the Federalists to capitalize\r\npolitically the popularity of the man of Mount Vernon, and they\r\nsucceeded, as we shall find, to a marked degree. Even so, some of\r\nHamilton’s most partial biographers[195] have commented on the absence\r\nof any deep affection between the two, and Dr. Hamilton is not\r\nconvincing with his observation that his ancestor signed his letters to\r\nWashington, ‘Very affectionately.’[196] As a matter of fact none of his\r\nletters to Washington denote real affection. This would be more\r\nimpressive, however, but for the singular absence of the note of\r\naffection in all his political correspondence. But in one of his letters\r\nwe find the very opposite of either affection or admiration. This was\r\nhis letter to General Schuyler on the occasion of Hamilton’s withdrawal\r\nfrom Washington’s military family, and it does not speak well for the\r\nreliability of his son’s biography that he deliberately mutilated the\r\nletter. It was in this that he wrote that he had found his chief\r\n‘neither remarkable for delicacy or good temper’ and complained of his\r\n‘self love.’ Here we have the confession that ‘for three years past I\r\nhave felt no friendship for him and have professed none.’[197]\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Lear, the secretary, when Washington died he probably\r\ncame perilously near to summing up his attitude in a sentence: ‘I have\r\nbeen much indebted to the kindness of the General, and he was an Aegis\r\nvery essential to me.’ And then, the significant postscript: ‘In whose\r\nhands are his papers gone? Our very confidential situation will not\r\npermit this to be a point of indifference to me.’[198]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch a man was Hamilton, a Colossus, brilliant, fascinating, daring, and\r\naudacious--a constructive statesman of the highest order, a genius of\r\nthe first rank, with all the strength and the weaknesses of genius. Such\r\nthe man who sat down at the mahogany desk to write the documents that\r\nwere to give credit to a nation and a programme to a party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHAMILTON IN THE SADDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere was quite enough in the picture of the handsome, penniless\r\nHamilton, at the age of thirty-two, striding upon the national scene\r\nwith the air of a conqueror to undertake the solution of the problem on\r\nwhich the existence of the young Republic depended, to appeal to the\r\npopular imagination. The mystery and romance of his history, the dash in\r\nhis manner, the shimmer of his genius, interested all and fascinated\r\nmany of his contemporaries. The audacious gayety with which he faced his\r\ntask imparted a feeling of confidence to those who did not know, as many\r\ndid, just what was in his mind. He set to work with an enthusiasm that\r\nsmacked of inspiration, for it was a task to his taste.\r\n\r\nWith the startling effect of a magician at his tricks he created the\r\nmachinery of his complicated department, selected his assistants with\r\ndiscrimination, trained them with meticulous care in their duties,\r\noutlined his plans for revenue immediately required, and sat down with\r\njoy to the preparation of his ‘Report on the Public Credit,’ which was\r\nto proclaim the public faith and establish the Nation’s credit.\r\n\r\nThe mere presence of this youthful figure at the mahogany desk commanded\r\nconfidence. Here was a man who was primarily interested in the rights of\r\nproperty, who believed in the sanctity of contracts and had the courage\r\nof his convictions. Even as he was writing his ‘Report,’ he loomed large\r\nas the man of the hour. His close associates foresaw the nature of his\r\nrecommendations. The mercantile and financial interests plumed\r\nthemselves upon a triumph. Within a month after his appointment a\r\ncontemporary rhymester put in verse the counting-room conception of the\r\nman:\r\n\r\n    ’...young Hamilton’s unshaken soul\r\n     The wayward hosts of anarchy control--\r\n     And while the Senate with his accents rung\r\n     A full conviction followed from his tongue.’[199]\r\n\r\nHis plans, given in confidence to some, were soon whispered among the\r\npoliticians and the merchants of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, and\r\nthe market price of public securities in the cities rose fifty per cent\r\ntwo months before Congress convened.\r\n\r\nIt was not until in early January that the ‘Report’ was read in House\r\nand Senate. His wish to present it personally was denied, not by his\r\npolitical enemies as his partial biographers contend, but by the\r\nsupporters of his plan.[200] In the galleries of the House eager\r\nspeculators were closely packed. They overflowed and filled the lobbies.\r\nSome were drawn by mere curiosity, some were the original creditors who\r\nhad waited long for their reward, but the greater number were\r\nspeculators, who, in anticipation of such a recommendation, had bought\r\nfreely of the skeptical holders at ridiculously low prices. Not a few of\r\nthese poured forth into Wall Street at the conclusion with the\r\nexhilarating knowledge that a fortune was within their grasp.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the ‘Report’ was heard in secret and in ‘awful silence,’\r\nfor the elder statesmen met behind doors closed and locked. Most of\r\nthese listened with approval, but the rheumatic Maclay, who had been\r\npuzzled for some time with ‘the extraordinary rise in public\r\nsecurities,’ wrote that night in his journal that Hamilton ‘recommends\r\nindiscriminate funding, and, in the style of the British Minister, has\r\nsent down his bill.’ There were some complaints that ‘a committee of\r\nspeculators in certificates could not have formed it more to their\r\nadvantage.’ In truth, ‘it occasioned many serious faces,’ and Maclay\r\nhimself was ‘struck of a heap.’[201] But the prevalent note was one of\r\njubilation. In New York, enthusiasm in the coffee-houses; in Boston,\r\n‘great applause’;[202] in other commercial cities, Philadelphia,\r\nCharleston, Baltimore, approbation, with reprobation for\r\nobjections.[203]\r\n\r\nAll men of honor sympathized with the purpose of discharging the debt.\r\nThe repudiationists were among the ignorant and the vicious. Few at the\r\nmoment found fault with the funding system, though some would have\r\npreferred a speedy liquidation through the sale of the public lands.\r\nThen--suddenly--a low murmur of protest, followed by acrimonious\r\nattacks. Thousands of the original creditors had been ‘swindled’ out of\r\ntheir certificates for a song--were these, who rendered Revolutionary\r\nservices, to be taxed to ensure exorbitant profits to the speculators?\r\nWhy should the Federal Government assume the debts contracted by the\r\nseparate States--debts unevenly distributed? And what was the purpose of\r\nthe proposal that the Government should be prohibited from paying more\r\nthan two per cent of the principal a year? The indignation of the\r\ninsurgents, at first a glimmer, became a flame. The greater part of the\r\ncertificates were in the hands of the prosperous who had taken advantage\r\nof the necessities of the original holders--Revolutionary soldiers,\r\nsmall farmers, hard-pressed country merchants. The funding system would\r\ntax all the people to pay to the rich a hundred cents on the dollar for\r\nevidence of debts that had cost them fifteen and twenty. With the people\r\ntaxed to pay the interest--it was proposed to perpetuate the debt. Thus,\r\nfor generations, perhaps, as many reasoned, the Government would operate\r\nfor the enrichment of the few already rich, and the masses would pay the\r\npiper.\r\n\r\nHad Hamilton been disposed to frankness, he would have smiled his\r\nacknowledgment of the charge. One of his biographers has conceded that\r\nthrough this system he hoped to ‘array property on the side of the\r\nGovernment,’ by giving it a financial interest in the Government, and\r\n‘to assure to the property of the country a powerful influence upon the\r\nGovernment.’[204] Having ‘been unable to introduce a class influence\r\ninto the Constitution by limiting the suffrage ... with a property\r\nqualification,’ he hoped through his financial system to accomplish his\r\npurpose in another way.[205]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing diabolical in the plan--coming from one who looked\r\nupon the masses as lawless and unfit for self-government. His obsession\r\nwas a strong, stable government--and to sustain it he required the\r\ninterested devotion of the propertied class. The astonishing thing is\r\nthat the comparatively crude Maclay from the wilds of Pennsylvania and\r\nthe leather-lunged James Jackson from sparsely settled Georgia should\r\nhave caught the full significance of it all before it dawned on\r\nJefferson and Madison. The latter thought the ‘Report’ ‘well digested\r\nand illustrated,’ and ‘supported by very able reasoning,’ but after a\r\nwhile he, too, was depressed with the injustice to the original\r\ncreditors who ‘were most instrumental in saving their country,’ and\r\nconcluded there was something ‘radically wrong in suffering those who\r\nrendered a bona fide consideration to lose seven eighths of their dues,\r\nand those who had no particular merit toward their country to gain seven\r\nor eight times as much as they advanced.’[206]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, speculation was manifesting itself with incredible audacity\r\nand mendacity. The greater part of the securities in the hands of\r\noriginal creditors were in the hands of soldiers, farmers, and merchants\r\nin the remote interior. To most of these, they had come to mean so much\r\nworthless paper. No telegraph could flash the news into the back country\r\nof Georgia and North Carolina that Congress was about to legislate to\r\npar the promises to pay. Weeks or months would pass before the\r\nproceedings in New York could be known and comprehended by holders of\r\nthe paper living in the woods of the Carolinas or on the banks of the\r\nSavannah. Poor, and mostly ignorant, they had no correspondents in the\r\ncoffee-houses to write them of the activities at Federal Hall; and even\r\nif they had, it required weeks for a letter to reach them.\r\n\r\nBut members of Congress knew what to expect--for they were the actors in\r\nthe drama; and their friends, the capitalists and merchants of the\r\ncities, knew--for they had been informed. The unscrupulous and\r\nadventurous soldiers of fortune on the scene comprehended the\r\nopportunity at a glance. The day after the ‘Report’ was read, the city\r\nbuzzed with the gossip of the speculators. One Senator, making calls in\r\nthe congressional circle, found it almost the sole topic of\r\nconversation. He heard that Robert Morris of the Senate, who had been\r\nconsulted by Hamilton, ‘must be deep in it, for his partner ... had one\r\ncontract for $40,000 worth.’ It was whispered that ‘General Heister had\r\nbrought over a sum of money for Mr. Morris for this business.’ Senator\r\nLangdon, it was noted, was living with a Mr. Hazard ‘who is an old and\r\nintimate friend of Mr. Morris,’ and he admitted that he had followed\r\nbuying certificates for some time past.’ ‘Ah,’ said the visiting\r\nSenator, ‘so you are one of the happy few who have been let in on the\r\nsecret’--and Mr. Hazard seemed abashed. It was understood that\r\nRepresentative Fitzsimons of Philadelphia was likewise concerned in the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFour days after the ‘Report’ was read, ‘expresses with very large sums\r\nof money on their way to North Carolina for purposes of speculation in\r\ncertificates’ splashed and bumped over the wretched winter roads, the\r\ndrivers lashing the straining horses. Two fast-sailing vessels,\r\nchartered by a member of Congress who had been an officer in the war,\r\nwere ploughing the waters southward on a similar mission--and this\r\nscandalous proceeding was to be mentioned frequently in the subsequent\r\ndebates. ‘I really fear,’ wrote Maclay, ‘the members of Congress are\r\ndeeper in this business than any others.’[207] Whether they were deeper\r\nor not, they were deep enough, and numerous enough to hold the balance\r\nof power in the body that legislated the certificates to par. These\r\nranged from Robert Morris, the chief legislative agent of Hamilton in\r\nthe Senate, to Fisher Ames, who was his most eloquent defender in the\r\nHouse.[208] In later years Jefferson was to record in justice to Ames\r\nthat his speculative activities had been greatly exaggerated and that he\r\nhad acted as an agent in the enterprises of his Boston friends, Gore and\r\nMason.[209]\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly did this money-madness take possession of the minds of men\r\nthat even the puritanic John Quincy Adams was to write his father,\r\nwithout a homily, that by September of 1790, Christopher Gore, the\r\nrichest lawyer in Massachusetts, and one of the strongest Bay State\r\nmembers of Hamilton’s machine, had ‘made an independent fortune in\r\nspeculation in the public funds’; and that other leaders of the bar[210]\r\nhad ‘successfully engaged in speculation’ by playing at ‘that hazardous\r\ngame with moneys deposited in their hands’ by clients at a distance.\r\nThey took the chance of becoming ‘masters of sums to an equal amount\r\nbefore they have been called upon for payment.’[211] Maclay thought\r\n‘there is no room to doubt but that a connection is spread over the\r\nwhole continent on this villainous business.’[212] Everywhere men with\r\ncapital--and a hint--were feverishly pushing their advantage by preying\r\non the ignorance of the poor. Thus, paper held for years by the private\r\nsoldiers was coaxed from them for five, and even as low as two,\r\nshillings on the pound by speculators, including leading members of\r\nCongress, who knew that provision for the redemption of the paper had\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nIn all this, Hamilton had no part and no responsibility beyond having\r\nmade indiscreet disclosures of which his friends availed themselves, and\r\nthrough buying and selling through his agents in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia for his brother-in-law.[213] Just how he viewed the\r\nscandalous proceedings in the earlier stages we do not know. They were\r\nnot without defense from his supporters. The obsequious John Fenno took\r\nnotice of the gossip with a defense of speculation in the ‘Gazette.’\r\nWere not moneyed men ‘the props of the infant credit of the United\r\nStates?’[214] The dark insinuations of the gossips, the criticism of the\r\n‘rabble,’ we may be sure caused Hamilton no concern. Surveying the field\r\nat the beginning of the battle, he must have been content. He saw the\r\nfinanciers, the commercial interests of the large centers, including the\r\nspeculators, enlisted under his banner. The influential Society of the\r\nCincinnati, composed of Revolutionary officers, men of means who had\r\nbeen able to hold on to their paper, gave dignity to his cause. With its\r\ncompact organization in every State, and its system of correspondence,\r\nit was an engine of tremendous power. The social and intellectual\r\ncircles were flying his flag. He looked upon his work and called it\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the first discussion in the House, it was apparent that speculation\r\nwas to play a conspicuous part in the debates. The speculators packed\r\nthe galleries, overflowed into the lobby, causing the complacent\r\nTheodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts, himself a speculator, to insist\r\nthat the ‘ardent expectations of the people on this subject want no\r\nother demonstration than the numerous body of citizens assembled within\r\nthese walls.’ The effect was different on the pugnacious Jackson of\r\nGeorgia. ‘Since this Report has been read,’ he shouted, with a\r\ncontemptuous glance at the eager gallery, ‘the spirit of speculation ...\r\nhas arisen and been cherished by people who had access to information\r\nthe Report contained, that would have made a Hastings blush to have been\r\nconnected with, though long inured to preying on the vitals of his\r\nfellow man. Three vessels, sir, have sailed within a fortnight from this\r\nport freighted for speculation.’[215]\r\n\r\nThe unctuous Sedgwick was melting suavity. Speculation within reasonable\r\nbounds was not bad, but action should be taken with all possible speed\r\nto stop it; and the troublesome Jackson returned to the attack--this\r\ntime on New York City. He wished to God Congress had met in the woods\r\nand out of the neighborhood of a populous town. The gallant veterans,\r\ndriven by economic necessity to the wilderness, were being robbed by\r\nthese speculators of the pittance a grateful country had bestowed. Since\r\nthe assumption of State debts was proposed, why not postpone action\r\nuntil the various legislatures could express the sentiment of the\r\nStates? ‘Then these men may send out other vessels to countermand their\r\nformer orders; and perhaps we may yet save the distant inhabitants from\r\nbeing plundered by these harpies.’[216]\r\n\r\nThis line of attack had not been anticipated, and Hamilton was not the\r\nman to take anything for granted. His well-groomed figure was seen\r\nmoving nervously about the lobbies of Federal Hall, within a few days\r\nafter the commencement of the debate. One of his enemies observed that\r\nhe ‘spent most of his time running from place to place among the\r\nmembers.’[217] In the evenings he gathered his more influential\r\nsupporters about him at his home. At his table he brought his most\r\nseductive charms to bear upon the doubting. Time was all-important and\r\nindefinite delay might be fatal.\r\n\r\nWith the thunder of Jackson’s ugly charges reverberating through the\r\nstreets, taverns, coffee-houses, Hamilton was ‘moving heaven and earth\r\nfor his funding system.’ The commercial interests and the members of\r\nthe Cincinnati hastened to join the lobby, which began to seek out the\r\nwavering or the doubtful in their lodging-houses. A fashionable minister\r\nfound his way to the quarters of Speaker Muhlenberg and Senator Maclay\r\nto extol the policies of the dynamic young Secretary, and ‘argued as if\r\nhe had been in the pulpit.’ Time, too, for a redoubling of effort, for\r\nthere were rumors that Madison, the strongest man in the House, had been\r\nunpleasantly impressed with the fast-sailing vessels and the expresses\r\njolting over the roads southward. A bitter attack had appeared in one of\r\nthe papers which gossip ascribed to the popular George Clinton.[218]\r\n\r\nIn the House--still harping were the foes on speculation, when with a\r\nbenevolent expression Sedgwick rose with saccharine urbanity to regret\r\nthe vice of speculation, and declare himself ‘totally disinterested,’\r\nalbeit he was financially concerned. It was only his distress over\r\nspeculation that admonished him to speedy action to minimize the evil.\r\nIt was really unfortunate that so much heat had been engendered. After\r\nall, were not ‘a great and respectable body of our citizens creditors of\r\nthe United States?’ It would be tragic were these animosities to create\r\n‘factions among the people.’\r\n\r\n‘A danger there?’ bellowed Jackson, the incorrigible infant terrible.\r\n‘Do not gentlemen think there is some danger on the other side? Will\r\nthere not be grounds for uneasiness when the soldier and the meritorious\r\ncitizen are called upon to pay the speculator more than ten times the\r\namount they ever received from him for their securities?’[219]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fight was spreading from Federal Hall to the newspapers\r\nwhere congressional courtesy imposed no restrictions on the temper.\r\nSinister stories were finding their way into print. ‘Several officials\r\nin conjunction with Robert Morris and wealthy contractors “were” at the\r\nbottom of this new arrangement.’ If it succeeded, Robert Morris would\r\nbenefit $18,000,000, Jeremiah Wadsworth would profit $9,000,000 and\r\nGovernor George Clinton would make $5,000,000.[220]\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions, with the speculators packing the\r\ngalleries, with the lobbyists, legitimate and illegitimate, buzzing\r\nthrough the corridors, with the most amazing rumors floating about the\r\nstreets, that James Madison, who had remained silent heretofore, rose in\r\na crowded House to fire the first fun in the Jeffersonian war on the\r\nfinancial policies of Alexander Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHere was a man at whom the Federalist leaders dare not sneer. A\r\nstranger, looking down from the gallery, would have been at a loss to\r\nunderstand the deference with which members hung upon his words. His\r\npersonal appearance was disappointing. The short little man dressed in\r\nsober black, with a bald head, and a little protuberant in front, whose\r\nlower limbs were slight and weak,[221] was surely not meant to ride on\r\nthe whirlwind and direct the storm. The impression of physical weakness\r\nhe conveyed did belie the fact. In the mild blue eyes there was much to\r\nsuggest the meditative philosopher, nothing to hint of the fighter. His\r\nvoice was so weak that even in the cozy little chamber he could scarcely\r\nbe heard.[222] He spoke in low tones, without gesture or excitement,\r\nalmost like a man communing with himself in the seclusion of his closet.\r\nAnd yet he commanded a hearing vouchsafed to few. It was the triumph of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHere, too, was a man with a background second to none in the infant\r\nRepublic. An ailing body had obsessed him in youth with the premonition\r\nof an early death, and, feeling the futility of entering on any pursuit,\r\nhe had sought consolation in his books. He not only consumed, he\r\nassimilated. He not only read, he thought. Thus he became something more\r\nthan a learned man--he developed into a political philosopher ‘worthy to\r\nrank with Montesquieu and Locke.’[223] At the time he rose to propose an\r\namendment to Hamilton’s plan there was not a man in America who was his\r\npeer in the knowledge of constitutional law or history. Nor was there a\r\nman, either, whose support Hamilton more eagerly coveted. Even the\r\njealous Ames conceded him to be ‘our first man,’ consoling himself for\r\nthe concession with the comment that ‘I think him too much of a book\r\npolitician and too timid in his politics,’ and that ‘he speaks decently\r\nas to manner and no more.’[224]\r\n\r\nBut the ill-natured jealousy of the more ornamental Ames failed to take\r\naccount, as most of his colleagues did, of the important practical use\r\nto which he had put his knowledge of the battles he had fought and the\r\nvictories he had won. No one in either branch of Congress or at the head\r\nof any of the departments had approached his services in the framing of\r\nthe Constitution. It was his genius that conceived the Virginia plan\r\nwhich became the basis of the agreement. At many critical junctures his\r\nspeeches had dissipated the gathering darkness with their light. His\r\npen, unknown to many at the time, had recorded the story of the\r\nConvention. His contributions to ‘The Federalist’ had been quite as\r\nimportant, if not so numerous, as those of Hamilton; and the fight he\r\nwaged in the Virginia Convention for ratification was quite as Titanic\r\nand conclusive as that of Hamilton in New York, but with this\r\ndifference--Hamilton was confronted by Melancthon Smith, while Madison\r\nhad to cross swords with Patrick Henry, with the powerful George Mason\r\nand the accomplished Pendleton.\r\n\r\nHe was not an orator of frills and fancies, magnetic and dramatic,\r\nappealing to the passions and emotions, but he was formidable in debate.\r\nIn the speeches of none of his contemporaries is found such erudition,\r\nmore driving logic, such tact and moderation of statement, or greater\r\nnobility of sentiment, fairness, justice. If they are a bit heavy in\r\ntheir sobriety, the occasion called for something remote from theatrical\r\nfrivolity. His grace was in his reasoning, not his rhetoric--and yet his\r\nstyle would have given him a foremost place at Saint Stephen’s.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that such a man should not have been a favorite\r\nwith the crowd. There was a diffidence in his manner, a formality and\r\nprecision in his method, a quiet dignity in his bearing that discouraged\r\nfamiliarity. He was too absorbed in his work to fit in with the social\r\nfestivity of his time. Only at his own table and among his intimates did\r\nhe appear in the rôle of ‘an incessant humorist’ and ‘keep the table in\r\nroars of laughter over his stories and his whimsical way of telling\r\nthem.’[225] Even his letters read like state papers. But there were a\r\nfew, greater than Ames, who appreciated him. These were the three most\r\nimportant personages of his time--Washington, Hamilton, and Jefferson.\r\n\r\nWashington consulted him and made use of his pen. Hamilton cultivated\r\nhim. Jefferson loved him as a son. His relations with the latter were no\r\nless than beautiful. Through many years they constantly interchanged\r\nvisits, corresponded regularly, and traveled together whenever possible.\r\nA strikingly incongruous pair they must have seemed as they plodded\r\nalong country roads together, or rode to and from Philadelphia together\r\nin Jefferson’s carriage--the tall, thin, loose-jointed, and powerful\r\nmaster of Monticello, and the short, frail, bald-headed Madison. But the\r\nincongruity was in their physical appearance only, for they had much in\r\ncommon--a common sweetness of disposition, a common code of political\r\nprinciples and morals, a common liberality of views, and a common\r\npassion for knowledge. The older man paid tribute to his protégé’s\r\nqualities long after both had passed from active public life: his\r\n‘habits of self-possession which placed at ready command the rich\r\nresources of his luminous and discriminating mind’; his language\r\n‘soothing always the feelings of his adversaries by civilities and\r\nsoftness of expression’; his ‘pure and spotless virtue which no calumny\r\nhas ever attempted to sully’--all qualities that made him a congenial\r\ncompanion for the philosopher who shared them in a large degree.[226]\r\nObserving Jefferson’s happiness at the inauguration of his successor, a\r\nlady who knew them both intimately wrote what all who knew them felt: ‘I\r\ndo believe father never loved a son more than he loves Mr.\r\nMadison.’[227] But when Madison rose that cold February day to make his\r\nfirst attack on Hamilton’s programme, he acted on his own volition and\r\nwithout consultation with the man who was to be his chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe character of Madison’s speech in favor of discrimination between the\r\noriginal holders and the purchasers of securities was not so open to\r\nattack as that of the impulsive and loose-thinking Jackson. He began in\r\na manner to conciliate his hearers, matching Hamilton in his insistence\r\non the sanctity of the debt and the necessity for its discharge. The\r\nquestion is--to whom is the money due? There could be no doubt in the\r\ncase of the original holders who had not alienated their securities. The\r\nonly rival pretensions were those of the original holders who had\r\nassigned and the present holders of the assignments.\r\n\r\n‘The former may appeal to justice,’ he said, ‘because the value of the\r\nmoney, the service or the property advanced by them has never been\r\nreally paid to them. They may appeal to good faith, because the value\r\nstipulated and expected is not satisfied by the steps taken by the\r\nGovernment. The certificates put in the hands of the creditors, on\r\nclosing their settlements with the public, were of less value than was\r\nacknowledged to be due; they may be considered as having been forced on\r\nthe receivers. They cannot therefore be adjudged an extinguishment of\r\nthe debt. They may appeal to the motives for establishing public credit,\r\nfor which justice and faith form the natural foundation. They may appeal\r\nto humanity for the sufferings of the military part of the creditors who\r\nnever can be forgotten while sympathy is an American virtue.’\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the purchaser also had a claim, he proposed a plan\r\ndesigned, as he thought, to do justice to both--to pay the original\r\nholder in full, and, where there had been an assignment, the assignee to\r\nreceive the highest market value and the original holder whatever\r\nremained over.[228] The plan spread consternation. At the Knoxes’ dinner\r\ntable that night, where members of Congress and diplomats were gathered,\r\nit was almost the sole topic of conversation. In the coffee-houses,\r\nwhere the speculators gathered about their mugs, Madison was denounced\r\nas a dreamer and an enemy of public faith. The more cautious regretted\r\nthe insurmountable difficulties of the scheme. This was felt by Madison\r\nas the one legitimate argument in opposition, and writing Jefferson\r\nthree days later he made the admission with the suggestion that ‘they\r\nmight be removed by one half the exertions that will be used to collect\r\nand color them.’[229] It was not until four days later that the\r\nHamiltonian leaders attacked the plan with their heavy artillery. One\r\nby one they rushed to the assault. ‘It is not pretended,’ cried\r\nSedgwick, ‘that any fraud or imposition has been practiced’--which is\r\nprecisely what was charged. If the original holders lost, it was their\r\nown fault. It was too bad. He really sympathized with their misfortunes.\r\nBut business was business. There was ‘no fraud on the part of the\r\nholder,’ echoed Laurance of New York--who knew that the town was humming\r\nwith the charge. At any rate, ‘the general opinion of men of property is\r\nin favor of it.’ No public bodies like Chambers of Commerce were against\r\nthe Hamilton plan. As for ‘the people’--newspapers and pamphlets could\r\nnot be taken as expressive of public opinion. William Smith of\r\nCharleston had heard few advocates of discrimination ‘in society.’ As\r\nfor the newspapers, they appeared on both sides. And why so much\r\nsympathy with the original holders?\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Ames, whose friend Gore was getting rich on\r\nspeculation, to take a stouter stand. Why should not ‘the seller who\r\nsold for a trifle be taxed to pay the purchaser?’ he asked. ‘He\r\ncertainly ought to fare as other citizens do. If he has property, then\r\nthe plea of necessity is destroyed; if he has none, then his taxes will\r\nbe a mere trifle.’ And public opinion against it? Then ‘all the more\r\nduty on Government to protect right when it may happen to be unpopular;\r\nthat is what Government is framed to do.’ Away with maudlin\r\nsentiment--it was not the function of the State to ‘rob on the highway\r\nto exercise charity.’[230]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the commercial organizations of the larger towns were summoned\r\nto the field against discrimination, and they responded--even in\r\nRichmond. ‘It is the natural language of the towns,’ wrote Madison, ‘and\r\ndecides nothing.’[231] As the debate proceeded, Wall Street swarmed with\r\nthe curious who could not get into the House where the speculators\r\npacked the galleries, and lined up deep behind the railing in the rear\r\nof the chamber. Petitions began to pour in. Passions rose. ‘I do not\r\nbelieve the crowd in the gallery consists of original holders,’ shouted\r\none speaker with a contemptuous glance at the covetous group bending\r\nover the railing.[232] Soldiers! ‘Poor soldiers!’ sneered Wadsworth--he\r\nwho had sent the two fast-sailing vessels to the South--‘I am tired of\r\nhearing about the poor soldiers. Perhaps soldiers were never better paid\r\nin any part of the country.’[233]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Madison returned to the attack in a speech unusually\r\nspirited for him. Only when he had parted with his self-respect ‘could\r\nhe admit that America ought to erect the monuments of her gratitude, not\r\nto those who saved her liberties, but to those who had enriched\r\nthemselves on her funds.’ It was his last effort. He had spent himself\r\nto the utmost. A spectator entering the House late in the day found him\r\n‘rather jaded.’[234] He had incurred the hate of the Hamiltonians\r\nwithout having consolidated all the opposition in favor of his plan.\r\n\r\nThree days later--it was Sunday--that extreme democrat Senator Maclay,\r\nwho was indifferent to Madison’s plan because opposed to funding\r\naltogether, sat down in his boarding-house and framed a plan of his own\r\nlooking to the extinguishment of the debt through the sale of public\r\nlands. Having satisfied himself, he went forth in search of Thomas\r\nScott, his colleague. But ‘shame to tell it--he a man in years and\r\nburdened with complaints--had lodged out and was not home yet.’ Pity\r\nthat ‘a good head should be led astray by the inordinate lust of its\r\nconcomitant parts.’ At length the old ‘roué’ was found, and he urged\r\nthat it be submitted to Madison at once.\r\n\r\nThe next day found Maclay indignantly chafing at Madison’s lodging-house\r\nbecause it was ‘a long time’ before he appeared. As the radical from\r\nPennsylvania read his plan, it seemed to him that Madison ‘attended to\r\nno one word, being so much absorbed in his own ideas.’ Maclay handed him\r\nthe paper, and Madison handed it back without glancing at it. Alas,\r\nthought the radical, ‘his pride seems of the kind that repels all\r\ncommunications.’[235] It was not an easy task to organize the forces of\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe next day Madison’s plan was voted down. It was found long afterward\r\nthat of the sixty-four members of the House, twenty-nine were\r\nsecurity-holders.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, had been accomplished--the public interest had been\r\nawakened. The tongue of criticism had been loosened. The man in the\r\nstreet began to hold forth. It was all beyond him--as problems of\r\nfinance were beyond Madison himself; but he could understand that a\r\npolicy had been adopted that would be advantageous to the rich,\r\nprofitable to the speculator, and mean loss to the common soldier. In\r\nthe commercial centers of the cities Madison became anathema. Young\r\nAdams reported to his father that in Boston ‘Mr. Madison’s reputation\r\nhas suffered from his conduct,’ albeit so respectable a character as\r\nJudge Dana had adopted Madison’s views.[236] The immediate reaction\r\nthrough letters to the papers was so bitter that Fenno was moved to a\r\nhomily under the caption, ‘Honor Your Rulers,’ in which he pointed to\r\nsuch outrageous derelictions as expressions of doubt concerning the\r\npropriety of the proceedings of Congress.[237] These expressions had\r\ngone far beyond a mere questioning of the wisdom of Congress. ‘A War\r\nWorn Soldier’ thought it ‘happy there is a Madison who fearless of the\r\nblood suckers will step forward and boldly vindicate the rights of the\r\nwidows and orphans, the original creditors and the war worn\r\nsoldier.’[238] Another ‘Real Soldier’ described ‘the poor emaciated\r\nsoldier, hungry and naked, in many instances now wandering from one\r\nextreme part of the country to another.... But thank God there lives a\r\nMadison to propose justice....’[239] An uglier and more pointed note was\r\nstruck by ‘A Farmer’ in Pennsylvania. ‘Would it not be a good\r\nregulation,’ he wrote, ‘to oblige every member of Congress ... to lay\r\nhis hand on his heart and to declare that he is no speculator; and that\r\nhe did not come forward to claim for himself the price of the blood or\r\nthe limb or the life of the poor soldier?’[240] Another wrote to\r\n‘gentlemen who by superior wealth have monopolized the public\r\nsecurities’ that if honor and public faith called for the maintenance of\r\nthe paper at par then, there was more occasion for it ‘when they were in\r\nthe hands of those poor people to whom they were justly due, who had\r\nimplicitly pinned their faith on your sheaves.’[241] ‘An Old Soldier’\r\nrecalled Washington’s pledge to see justice done the common soldier.\r\n‘Ample means are said to be now about to be provided, not for their\r\nrelief, but to enable eight or nine hundred per cent gain on the\r\npurchase money of the speculator.’[242] ‘Ah well,’ wrote ‘A Citizen’ of\r\nBoston, ‘Madison, Jackson and others in favor of discrimination in\r\nfunding the public debt have probably immortalized their memories.’[243]\r\n\r\nTheir letters probably reflect the talk among the workers on the\r\nwharves, the pioneers on the fringe of the forests, the gossips of the\r\ntaverns. Rightly or wrongly, a spirit of resentment had been aroused--a\r\nfeeling in the breast of many that their interests were being\r\nsubordinated by the Government. This sentiment was to grow and to\r\nincrease the trouble of Hamilton in the next step toward the adoption of\r\nhis funding system.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWith the easy victory, however, the Hamiltonians entered with gayety\r\nupon the next step--the Assumption of the State debts--determined to\r\nrush it through. On the very night of the day discrimination was\r\ndefeated, the Pennsylvania delegation, on the suggestion of Robert\r\nMorris, met at the lodgings of Representative Fitzsimons of Philadelphia\r\nto ‘consider’ the matter of Assumption. One glance convinced the\r\nkeen-eyed Maclay that the meeting was for ratification, not for\r\nconsideration purposes. ‘By God,’ swore Morris, ‘it must be done!’\r\nGeorge Clymer, another of the Hamilton Reliables, bubbled with\r\nenthusiasm over the advantage that would accrue to Pennsylvania. Maclay\r\nwas embarrassed by the almost affectionate comradery of some of his\r\ncolleagues. Why should the delegation not hold weekly social sessions\r\nand work in harmony? Fitzsimons’s lodgings would be the very place to\r\nmeet. Yes, agreed Morris, and they could have wine and oysters.[244]\r\n\r\nA few days later Muhlenberg, returning to Maclay’s lodgings from a levee\r\nat the presidential mansion, declared with intense emphasis that the\r\nState debts must be assumed--which impressed the suspicious Senator as\r\n‘the language of the Court.’[245]\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be so simple as all that. Assumption, argued many,\r\nwould but extend the scope of the operations of the hated speculators.\r\nIt was another move to mortgage the Government to the capitalists. The\r\ngreater part of the speculating gentry were in the North; they would\r\nsoon accumulate all the State certificates of the South into their own\r\nhands and one section would be paying taxes to increase the fortunes of\r\na favored class in another.\r\n\r\nThere was another reason for the revolt of the Southerners--which,\r\nreversed, would have operated quite as powerfully on the Northerners.\r\nThe States with the largest unpaid debts were in the North,\r\nMassachusetts with the greatest debt of all. Virginia, which led the\r\nopposition, had liquidated most of her debt. There is nothing\r\ninexplicable in the objections of the Virginians, who had paid their\r\ndebt, to being taxed to help pay the debt of Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nThis was appreciated by many in the North, and a citizen of Stockbridge,\r\nMassachusetts, writing for a New York paper, thought it unfair. If the\r\n‘leveling system’ was vicious as applied to men, it was quite as bad\r\nwhen applied to States. Then, too, ‘the public creditors, the most\r\nopulent part, of the community, would, by this means, be detached from\r\nthe interest of the State Governments and united to that of the general\r\nGovernment.’ This aimed at the annihilation of the State Governments and\r\nthe perpetuation of the debt.[246] Thus an attack began on the general\r\npolicy of funding, taking an ugly form, appealing to class prejudices.\r\n‘A number of drones are brought into society and the industrious bee is\r\nforced to furnish them with all the honey of its search.’[247]\r\n\r\nBut this opposition from the unimportant meant nothing to Hamilton. In\r\nthose days, and for many days to come, it was only necessary to know\r\nwhat Oliver Wolcott[248] said or wrote to know what his master thought.\r\nWriting his father about this time, Wolcott gives us sketchily the\r\noperations of Hamilton’s mind. This matter of assumption was connected\r\nwith ‘the engine of government.’ Since ‘the influence of the clergy, the\r\nnobility and the army’ was impossible, ‘some active principle of the\r\nhuman mind can be interested in the support of the Government.’ It would\r\nnever do to have ‘civil establishments,’ but there was an influential\r\nclass in existence--the moneyed class. They could and should be bound\r\nby interest to the general Government. What more ‘active principle’ of\r\nthe human mind than the desire for wealth? And if the capitalists looked\r\nto the Federal rather than to the State Governments for their money,\r\nwhat better ‘engine of government’ than that? ‘For these reasons,’ wrote\r\nWolcott, ‘I think the State debts should be assumed.’ True, it would\r\nmake the debt of the United States ‘inconvenient,’ the taxes would be\r\n‘burdensome,’ and ‘will appear to be just only to those who believe that\r\nthe good attained is more important than the evil which is\r\nsuffered.’[249]\r\n\r\nIt was fear of the effect of these ‘burdensome taxes’ on the popularity\r\nof the Federal Government that led some men, including Madison, into\r\nopposition.[250] Some of the Hamiltonians were alarmed, fearing that\r\n‘such bold politics are unfitted to ... the infant resources’ of the\r\nyoung Republic.[251] Every enemy of Assumption was not hostile to the\r\ncentral Government, but all who were jealous of the sovereignty of the\r\nStates were in opposition. Rufus King, the brilliant and virile\r\nHamiltonian leader in the Senate, was convinced that in New York ‘the\r\nanti-federalists think that the advantages to be derived to the State\r\nfrom the retention of that debt are so great and important that they\r\nstand ready to accede to any terms which the creditors may\r\npropose.’[252] About the same time the unreconciled Patrick Henry was\r\nwriting James Monroe that ‘it seems to be a consistent part of a system\r\nI have ever dreaded,’ and that the ‘subserviency of Southern to Northern\r\ninterests are written in Capitals on its very front.’[253]\r\n\r\nSuch was the atmosphere in which the second battle began.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the debate one champion of Assumption[254] let the cat\r\nout of the bag with the statement that ‘if the general Government has\r\nthe payment of all the debts, it must of course have all the revenue,\r\nand if it possesses the whole revenue, it is equal, in other words, to\r\nthe whole power.’ ‘Yes,’ cried the irrepressible Jackson in stentorian\r\ntones, ‘if it lulls the Shays of the North it will rouse the Sullivans\r\nof the South’--and the fight was on.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately Assumption became confused with the whole system of\r\nfunding, and a week after Madison had made his argument against the\r\nformer, he was compelled to return to a defense of the latter, not as\r\nsomething he desired, but as a necessity imposed by unescapable\r\nconditions. Madison was too much of a statesman to be a demagogue.\r\n\r\nVery soon, Maclay, watching the proceedings in the House with ferret\r\neyes, thought he observed ‘the rendezvousing of the crew of the Hamilton\r\ngalley.’ He found that ‘all hands are piped to quarters.’ The plan to\r\nforce a vote on March 8th was abandoned toward evening, and that night\r\nhe heard it was to await the arrival of Representative Vining of\r\nDelaware, and to give Hamilton time ‘to prepare him properly.’[255]\r\n\r\nThere was some mystery about Vining, and wild rumors were afloat that\r\nsome one had said that he would give the new arrival a thousand guineas\r\nfor his vote. ‘A thousand guineas,’ snorted Maclay, with a twinge in his\r\ngouty knee, ‘they could get him for a tenth that sum.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there was feverish activity among Hamilton’s supporters in\r\nCongress and out. Government officials left their desks to become\r\nlobbyists. The clergy turned politicians and solicited. The speculators\r\nwere active. The members of the Cincinnati were mobilized and marched.\r\nTwo Congressmen, one lame, the other sick, were carried to the House to\r\nmeet a possible emergency. Another, planning to leave town, was ordered\r\nto his post.[256] The friends of Assumption were becoming uneasy.\r\nLetters in opposition were pouring in from men like Doctors Rush and\r\nLogan of Philadelphia and were being peddled about by Maclay to members\r\nof the Pennsylvania delegation. Alas, that he should have found ‘a woman\r\nin the room’ with old man Scott again.[257]\r\n\r\nThese activities so wrought upon the nerves of Robert Morris that he\r\nsought a new avenue of approach to his erratic colleague. Would Maclay\r\njoin Morris in some land speculations? The former was suspicious, but\r\ninterested.[258] For several days Morris talked land--the play\r\ncontinuing for eleven days. The debate was becoming bitter. The able,\r\nbitter-tongued Ædanus Burke of South Carolina made a ferocious attack on\r\nHamilton, and the lobbies, coffee-houses, streets, buzzed with talk of a\r\nduel.[259]\r\n\r\nThe distress among Hamilton’s friends increased. In the Senate, shut off\r\nfrom the curious eyes of the public, feelings could be manifested with\r\nsome abandon. Ellsworth and Izard ‘walked all the morning back and\r\nforward.’ Strong of Massachusetts and Paterson of New Jersey ‘seemed\r\nmoved but not so much agitated.’ King ‘looked like a boy who had been\r\nwhipped.’ And the hair on Schuyler, a heavy speculator and father-in-law\r\nof Hamilton, ‘stood on end as if the Indians had fired at him.’[260]\r\n\r\nBut courage was revived, and there was unwonted activity. Most of\r\nWashington’s household joined the lobby--Humphreys, Jackson, and Nelson,\r\nhis secretaries--and were particularly attentive to Vining. This was the\r\nresult of a caucus of Hamilton’s supporters the night before when the\r\ndecision was reached to risk a vote.\r\n\r\nThree days later, the chance was taken, and Hamilton lost by two votes.\r\nThe scene was dramatic. Sedgwick made an ominous speech and, on being\r\ncalled to order, took his hat and left. ‘A funeral oration,’ sneered\r\nMaclay. When he returned he seemed to have been weeping. Even the eyes\r\nof the self-contained Fitzsimons ‘were brimming full’ as he went about\r\n‘reddened like scarlet.’ Clymer, ‘always pale,’ was ‘deadly white,’ his\r\nlips quivering. But ‘happy impudence sat on Laurance’s brow.’ Wadsworth,\r\nwho was financially interested, ‘hid his grief under the rim of a round\r\nhat,’ and Boudinot,[261] another speculator, left his distress naked to\r\nhis enemies--‘his wrinkles rose in ridges and the angles of his mouth\r\nwere depressed and assumed a curve resembling a horse shoe.’[262]\r\n\r\nThe speculators poured out of the galleries and into the coffee-houses\r\nand taverns to relieve their feelings with oaths over a mug. The air was\r\nelectric--and cause enough. Many speculators or their agents had been\r\nscouring the back country of the Carolinas and Georgia for months buying\r\nup State securities on the assumption that they would be funded. They\r\nhad bet on a sure thing--and lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nFor a moment the friends of Assumption appeared to lose interest in the\r\nnew Government. Some acted as though the experiment launched by the\r\nConstitution had failed and was not worth a ceremonious burial. The\r\ninterest of Congress lagged, and in the Senate, where the Assumptionists\r\nwere strongest, business was practically abandoned. In less than an hour\r\nafter it was called to order, Rufus King would move an adjournment.[263]\r\nIt was a gloomy and cold April--the distant hills and even the\r\nhouse-tops covered with snow.[264] ‘The Eastern members talk a strange\r\nlanguage,’ wrote Madison to Monroe. ‘They avow, some of them at least, a\r\ndetermination to oppose all provisions for the public debt which does\r\nnot include this, and intimate danger to the Union from a failure to\r\nassume.’[265] Senator Johnson of North Carolina found ‘the gentlemen who\r\nare in favor of assumption ... very sore and impatient under their\r\ndefeat.’[266] Not a few of the Federalists began to speak and write\r\npessimistically of the doubtful value of the Government. From his\r\nlibrary at Beverly, George Cabot could see the danger of ‘division,\r\nanarchy and wretchedness,’[267] and if the States seized the opportunity\r\nto ‘provide honestly for their creditors ... the general government\r\nwould be ruined irrevocably.’ But the thing that pained Cabot most was\r\nthe attitude of Madison. Had he changed his principles?[268]\r\n\r\nIn the Hamiltonian press the comments were funereal. Fenno’s paper\r\nteemed with indignant protests and savage attacks on the State\r\n‘demagogues’ who were ‘hankering after popularity at home.’[269]\r\n‘Americanus,’ paying tribute to Hamilton and his funding plan, found it\r\n‘wantonly destroyed’ and ‘in broken pieces at the several shrines of\r\nambition, avarice and vanity.’[270]\r\n\r\nYet all the scribes were not similarly depressed. A writer in the ‘New\r\nYork Journal,’ describing the birth and death of Assumption, worked the\r\nadvocates of the measure into a frenzy. He pictured it as ‘the bastard\r\nof Eastern speculators who have lost their puritanic manners’--the\r\n‘brat’ having been brought into the world ‘by the dexterous application\r\nof the forceps.’ Thus it was injured by the ‘violence of the delivery,’\r\nbut ‘Dr. Slop’ had hoped to save it by having it bathed ‘in Yankee rum.’\r\n‘The unfortunate child was presented to the baptismal font by Granny\r\nFitzsimmons; and Mr. Sedgwick, who is gifted with canting talents,\r\nofficiated as priest, baptized the infant, and his name stands on the\r\nparish books as Al--ex--der Assumption.’ But alas, ‘the child of promise\r\nwho would have redeemed the Eastern States from poverty and despair is\r\nnow no more.’[271]\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was not despairing--he had just begun to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that an event of tremendous import\r\noccurred. On Sunday a stage-coach lumbered up to the tavern on Broadway,\r\nand a tall, travel-worn man emerged and entered the hostelry. Momentous\r\nas was the meaning of his arrival, it claimed but scant notice in the\r\npapers of the city.\r\n\r\n     ‘On Sunday last, arrived in this city, Thomas Jefferson, Esq.,\r\n     Secretary of State for the United States of America.’[272]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the press or the correspondence of the time to\r\nindicate the slightest appreciation of the significance of this\r\naccession to governmental circles. No doubt Madison was among the first\r\nto greet him, but of this we have no evidence. For two weeks Jefferson\r\nhad been upon the road from Richmond, resting a day at Alexandria where\r\nan eighteen-inch snow caused him to send his carriage on by water and\r\ntake the public stage. The roads were wretched and there was little\r\nopportunity for restful sleep. Occasionally the long-legged traveler\r\nleft the stage to mount his horse for exercise. Thus he rode to the\r\nfield of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAs Hamilton surveyed the wreckage of the field, he saw an opportunity.\r\nThere was another bitter battle pending over the selection of the site\r\nof the permanent capital. Might he not bargain a bit and trade enough\r\nvotes for Assumption? The site of the capital was a matter of\r\nindifference to him. No sentimental ties bound him to any State or\r\ncommunity. No dust sacred to him rested anywhere in American soil. He\r\nwas ready to go with any group that could contribute enough votes to\r\nmake Assumption sure. Philadelphia--New York--the\r\nSusquehanna--Baltimore--the Potomac--a mere bagatelle to him. In the\r\nfact that it was more than that to others he saw his chance. Could the\r\nVirginians or the Marylanders who had opposed Assumption pay him in\r\nvotes for a capital at Georgetown, or even Baltimore? Could Robert\r\nMorris whip the stubborn Pennsylvanians into line for a capital in\r\nPhiladelphia or on the Susquehanna? True, Washington favored Georgetown,\r\nbut that meant nothing to Hamilton if Georgetown could not bring\r\nAssumption. It is a myth of history that he was tenderly considerate of\r\nthe wishes of his chief: the facts to sustain it do not appear. Far more\r\nimportant to him was the fact that Madison and Carroll favored\r\nGeorgetown. They had votes.\r\n\r\nThe intense bitterness over the struggle called for infinite diplomacy\r\nand sagacity in negotiation. The papers of the country were filled with\r\nill-natured letters on the fight which was no more in evidence in\r\nCongress than in the bar-rooms of the competing cities. Ames, like\r\nHamilton, cared little about the site if he could but get Assumption,\r\nand was disgusted with the ‘despicable grogshop contest, whether the\r\ntaverns in New York or Philadelphia shall get the custom of Congress.’\r\nSedgwick had become a ‘perfect slave to the business,’ and ‘Goodhue\r\nfrowned all day long and swears as much as a good Christian\r\ncan....’[273]\r\n\r\nBy early June the bargaining stage had been reached. One day Tench Coxe,\r\nof the Treasury, and Jackson, one of Washington’s secretaries, called at\r\nthe lodgings of Fitzsimons and Clymer with the bald proposition to trade\r\nthe permanent residence to Philadelphia for enough Pennsylvania votes to\r\npass Assumption. Taking this as a hint from Hamilton, Robert Morris\r\nwrote him that early the next morning he should be taking a walk on the\r\nBattery, and if any propositions were open he would be very glad to have\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury join him in his constitutional. Thus,\r\nlong before many of the statesmen had enjoyed their coffee, Hamilton and\r\nMorris paced up and down at the deserted Battery. With Walpolean\r\ndirectness, Hamilton went to the point. He needed one vote in the Senate\r\nand five in the House. If Morris could assure him these, he could give\r\nassurance, in return, that the permanent residence would be given to\r\nGermantown or the Falls of the Delaware. Morris promised to consult his\r\ncolleagues--but how about the temporary residence for Philadelphia?\r\nAfter thinking it over, Hamilton sent word that he would not think of\r\nbargaining on the temporary residence.[274] For several days these\r\nnegotiations continued. The Pennsylvanians moved with a deliberation\r\nthat tried Hamilton’s patience. A few days later he threatened his\r\nPhiladelphia friends with the possibility of the New-Englanders going to\r\nBaltimore or the Potomac.[275]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hamilton had been thinking seriously of Jefferson. They met\r\nas strangers, knowing one another well by reputation. Their feelings\r\nwere friendly. There were innumerable reasons why they should ultimately\r\nfly at each other’s throats, but that was in the future. One June day\r\nthey met at the presidential mansion on Broadway, and, leaving at the\r\nsame time, Hamilton saw his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere was a picture for an artist to paint--Hamilton and Jefferson, arm\r\nin arm, walking along Broadway discussing the possibilities of a\r\nbargain. With all the persuasiveness of his eloquence, Hamilton dwelt on\r\nthe very real danger of disunion if Assumption failed. With subtle\r\ndiplomacy he seemed to throw himself trustfully on Jefferson’s mercy. A\r\ngreat struggle for independence--a promising young nation--and was all\r\nto be lost? The South wanted the capital, the North wanted\r\nAssumption--could there not be a common meeting-ground? Jefferson would\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nA dinner at Jefferson’s table in the house on Broadway. Men from the\r\nSouth about the board. The topic--the pending bargain. A little later,\r\nHamilton was informed that an agreement could be reached. The word was\r\npassed along the line. Even Madison satisfied himself that, since\r\nAssumption could not be prevented, the bargain might as well be\r\nmade--but if there had been no bargain there would have been no\r\nAssumption. A few nights later the Pennsylvania delegation entertained\r\nboth Hamilton and Jefferson at dinner. The latter impressed one guest\r\nwith his ‘dignity of presence and gravity,’ Hamilton with his ‘boyish\r\ngiddy manner.’ Whatever may have been the cause of the gravity of\r\nJefferson, there was reason for the giddiness of Hamilton--he had\r\nwon![276]\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe attempt of Jefferson in later life to explain his part in the\r\nbargain over Assumption, with the assertion that he had been deceived by\r\nHamilton, is in the nature of an alibi created after the crime. He was\r\nnot a simple-minded rustic, and his correspondence previous to the\r\nbargain shows that he had given serious consideration to Assumption. He\r\nhad been in daily contact with Madison who had led the fight against it.\r\nA meticulously careful student of the press, he unquestionably was\r\nfamiliar with every objection to Assumption and funding which he\r\nafterward offered. He had undoubtedly read Madison’s argument which had\r\nbeen published a month after he reached New York. As late as June 20th,\r\nhe was writing Monroe that, unless the quarrel over Assumption and the\r\nresidence was settled, ‘there will be no funding bill agreed to, our\r\ncredit will burst and vanish, and the States separate, to take care,\r\nevery one of itself.’ Much as he would prefer that the States pay their\r\nown debts, he could see ‘the necessity of yielding to the cries of the\r\ncreditors ... for the sake of the Union, and to save it from the\r\ngreatest of all calamities, the total extinction of our credit in\r\nEurope.’[277] Here was justification enough for his action without\r\nresorting to the fanciful story of his deception by Hamilton. ‘The\r\nquestion of assuming the State debts has created greater animosities\r\nthan I ever yet saw,’ he wrote Dr. Gilmer a week after his letter to\r\nMonroe.[278] Thus he knew precisely how the lines were drawn. Perhaps he\r\ndid not appreciate at the moment the political advantage of appearing on\r\nthe side of the opposition,--but he was not deceived. Nor was Madison\r\nimposed upon. He accepted the bargain because ‘the crisis demands the\r\nspirit of accommodation,’ albeit he wished it ‘considered as an\r\nunavoidable evil and possibly not the worse side of the dilemma.’[279]\r\n\r\nWith many, however, the triumph of Assumption meant placing Hamilton and\r\nhis followers in an impregnable position; this, too, was the idea of the\r\nHamiltonians and great was their rejoicing. When the measure passed the\r\nSenate, members of the lower House were packed behind the iron railing,\r\nthe smiling faces of Ames and Sedgwick conspicuous among them. To the\r\nextremists in the opposition it seemed the end. ‘I do not see that I can\r\ndo any good here and I think I had better go home,’ wrote Maclay.\r\n‘Everything, even to the naming of a committee is prearranged by\r\nHamilton and his group of speculators.’[280] And the Hamiltonians, who\r\nhad raged over the satirical article on the birth of Assumption, made\r\nmerry over a verse in Fenno’s journal:\r\n\r\n    ‘The wit who bastardized thy name\r\n     And croaked a funeral dirge\r\n     Knew not how spotless was thy fame\r\n     How soon thou would’st emerge.’[281]\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned, Hamilton, rejoicing in his triumphs, turned\r\ngayly to the next step in his programme, with more powerful influences\r\nbehind him than he had ever had before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPREMONITIONS OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHamilton was at the high tide of his popularity and power when Congress\r\nnext convened in Philadelphia. His funding system had established the\r\nNation’s credit, and the genius and daring of the brilliant young man of\r\nthirty-three were on every tongue. The ‘Maryland Journal’ claimed\r\n‘respectable authority’ for the assertion that in Quebec he was\r\n‘supposed equal to the celebrated Mr. Pitt, and superior to the Prime\r\nMinister of any other court in Europe.’[282] Among the merchants and\r\npeople of wealth and property he was acclaimed the savior of the State.\r\nEverywhere he was the idol of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the saddle, he was riding hard. Although his was the second\r\nposition in the Cabinet, he thought of himself as the Prime Minister.\r\nWashington was a constitutional monarch. The other members of the\r\nPresident’s official family were his subordinates. His policies were the\r\npolicies of the Government, and to question them was hostility to the\r\nState. In the Cabinet meetings his manner was masterful to a degree.\r\nConsidering himself Prime Minister, he felt no delicacy about\r\ninterfering in the departments of his colleagues. Even Knox, who adored\r\nhim, resented his determination to make all the purchases for the\r\nDepartment of War. When the War Secretary resisted, Hamilton had a\r\ncompliant Congress pass a law giving him that privilege--an absurdity\r\nthat continued as long as he was in the Cabinet.[283] The soft-spoken,\r\nmild, and courteous Jefferson, who preferred the ways of conciliation\r\nand persuasion, observed the dictatorial airs of his masterful young\r\nassociate with a surprise that hardened to distaste.\r\n\r\nBut the feeling awakened among the masses by the failure to discriminate\r\nin the matter of the securities, and by Assumption, was increasing in\r\nintensity. The common soldier had not profited by these policies. The\r\nfarmer and the mechanic could see no benefit to themselves, but among\r\nspeculators, some of them members of Congress, they observed evidence of\r\nnew-found wealth. These were building finer houses, riding in coaches\r\nwhere they had previously walked, and there was an ominous rumbling and\r\ngrumbling beneath the surface, to which the Hamiltonians were oblivious\r\nor indifferent. After all, this was merely the whining of the\r\nne’er-do-wells of the taverns and the illiterates of the farms.\r\n\r\nThe work was only begun, and there could be no turning back now. The\r\nassumption of the State debts called for the tapping of new sources of\r\nrevenue. This would increase the burdens of the people, but what would\r\nthey have? They could not eat their cake and have it too--could not have\r\na strong government without paying the price. Utterly unmindful of the\r\ncomplaining of the people of no importance, Hamilton turned resolutely\r\nto his task and prepared his excise tax for the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn raising money to meet the obligations of Assumption, it was the\r\npurpose of Hamilton to resort to direct taxation as little as possible,\r\nand to make luxuries bear the burden. This directed his attention to the\r\ndomestic manufacture of spirits--luxury to some, but a very real\r\nnecessity to others. This was particularly true in the States where\r\ndistilleries were plentiful. That it would call forth a protest from\r\nsome quarters, he had no doubt, and he rejoiced in the certainty of\r\ncombat. Strong man that he was, he went forth in shining armor to\r\nestablish the right of the Government to an internal revenue. He knew\r\nthat excise taxes were obnoxious, albeit necessary, and he sought the\r\nchance to vindicate the right of the Government to do the necessary,\r\nunpopular thing.\r\n\r\nInstantly the challenge was accepted in Pennsylvania where whiskey\r\nstills abounded in the Alleghanies. Some of the State’s representatives\r\nin Congress were instantly on their toes, denouncing the plan as\r\narbitrary and despotic. In the Legislature, Albert Gallatin, a\r\nremarkable young man, soon to prove himself the only member of the\r\nopposition capable of coping with Hamilton in the field of finance,\r\nframed a reply, denouncing the plan as ‘subversive of the rights,\r\nliberty and peace of the people.’ In the midst of excitement--for the\r\nLegislature sat in Philadelphia--the reply was debated and adopted by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nBut the opposition was comparatively weak. Jefferson and Madison were\r\nhostile to the principle, but there had been a bargain on Assumption to\r\nwhich they were parties. They could not deceive themselves as to the\r\nnecessity. If Jefferson raised a finger to prevent the passage of the\r\nbill, he covered his tracks. Even Giles, soon to become the most\r\nvehement leader of the Jeffersonian party, at first looked upon it with\r\nsome favor. Madison could see no escape.\r\n\r\nAmong the masses throughout the country, however, the obscure orators\r\nwere busy in the bar-rooms, on the streets, and at the crossroads. The\r\ncharacter of the discussion among the people is indicated in imaginary\r\nconversations by a writer in a Baltimore paper. A friend of the excise\r\nfares forth into the streets and meets its enemies. ‘An outrage!’ cried\r\none. ‘Had we not gone to war with England on a tax?’ ‘Ah,’ but, says the\r\ndefender, ‘then we were taxed by another country and without\r\nrepresentation, while here we tax ourselves through our chosen\r\nrepresentatives.’ ‘Yes,’ but, says Rumor, ‘under the excise act men can\r\nbreak into the people’s houses.’ ‘Wrong,’ says the defender; ‘the law\r\nprovides no such arbitrary power.’ ‘But,’ persists the enemy, ‘we shall\r\nbe eaten up by excise officers.’ ‘Silly,’ says the defender;\r\n‘numerically these officials will be unimportant.’ Then the defender\r\nencounters one candid enemy of the measure. ‘I hate the excise,’ he\r\ncries, ‘because it strengthens the Government by providing effectually\r\nfor its necessities; and the Government which lays it because it is a\r\nGovernment of vigor.’ Whereupon the defender praises him as an honest\r\nman.[284]\r\n\r\nThe moment the Excise Bill was presented in the House, the ever alert\r\nJackson was ready with a motion to strike out the essential part of the\r\nfirst clause. ‘The mode of taxation was odious, unequal, unpopular, and\r\noppressive, more particularly in the Southern States,’ where under the\r\nhot Southern skies spirituous liquors were more than salutary--they were\r\nnecessary. Why deprive the masses of ‘the only luxury they enjoy’? Why\r\nimpose upon the American people an excise that had been odious in\r\nEngland from the days of Cromwell, and which had been reprobated by\r\nBlackstone?\r\n\r\nYes, added an indignant Virginian,[285] ‘it will convulse the\r\nGovernment; it will let loose a swarm of harpies, who, under the\r\ndomination of revenue officers, will range through the country, prying\r\ninto every man’s house and affairs, and like a Macedonian phalanx bear\r\ndown all before them.’ The mercantile interests were paying their duties\r\nwith promptitude? He was tired of these encomiums. ‘The increase in the\r\nrevenue has served to enhance the value of the public securities, of\r\nwhich it is well known they hold a very considerable portion.’[286]\r\n\r\nOn the second day, Madison went on record as opposed to the principle\r\nand in favor of the measure. The only question to be considered was the\r\nnecessity for the revenue--and that was indisputable. He personally\r\nwould prefer direct taxes, but the majority of the people were against\r\nthem. Of all forms of the excise, that on ardent spirits impressed him\r\nas the least objectionable.\r\n\r\nBut, demanded Jackson, disappointed at Madison’s failure to join in the\r\nassault, why not other taxes--taxes on salaries, pensions, lawyers?\r\nBecause, answered Laurance, the Assumption calls for revenue, and this\r\nis the best way to raise it. True, added another,[287] and he had ‘not\r\nfound a single person against it’--and this in Philadelphia where the\r\nLegislature was sitting! What! exclaimed Timothy Blood worth of North\r\nCarolina, why ‘people to the southward universally condemn the tax.’\r\nYes, indeed, contributed another, especially in North Carolina, ‘where\r\nthe consumption of ardent spirits is ten times greater than in\r\nConnecticut.’\r\n\r\nUp rose Sedgwick in conciliatory mood. He was not impressed with ‘the\r\nconsiderations of morality,’ and could not think that the tax ‘would be\r\nattended with any sensible inconvenience.’ There certainly was no\r\nthought of using military force in its collection. And then it was that\r\nGiles, who, next to Madison, was the most fervent and able of the\r\nJeffersonians, astonished many by giving his hearty approval to the tax\r\nas necessary ‘to the honor, peace and security’ of the country.[288]\r\n\r\nThus for days the debate continued with its reiterations, until a new\r\nnote was struck with a proposed amendment, aimed at Hamilton whose\r\naudacious methods and successive successes were causing grave concern in\r\nsome quarters, to prohibit revenue agents from interfering in elections.\r\nThese officers in their work, said Samuel Livermore, ‘will acquire such\r\na knowledge of persons and characters as will give them great advantage\r\nand enable them to influence elections to a great degree.’ ‘Impolitic in\r\nrespect to law, repugnant to the Constitution, and degrading to human\r\nnature,’ protested Ames. It would prevent self-respecting men from\r\ntaking the places, added Sedgwick. When the vote was taken, the\r\namendment was defeated with both Madison and Giles voting against it.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the House took up the duration of the tax that the\r\ngreat battle began, and under the leadership of Giles, who had hitherto\r\ngiven it his support.[289] But Madison was not impressed, and in the\r\nvote on placing a limitation on the operation of the bill he was found\r\nwith the Hamiltonians--and there he stood on the final vote.\r\n\r\nEven in the Senate the attempt to defeat the measure was continued, and\r\nwhile Hamilton was strongest in that body, the energetic young Secretary\r\ntook nothing for granted. It was not enough that the committee\r\nconsidering the bill had been packed with his supporters; he took\r\npersonal charge. For several days he walked briskly into the room and\r\ntook his place at the table, after which the doors were closed and\r\nlocked. The worried Maclay, who was preparing the case against the\r\nmeasure on behalf of the distillers, sensed a conspiracy. When Adams\r\nhastened an adjournment of the Senate while the committee was sitting,\r\nthe victim of the gout put him down as ‘deep in the cabals of the\r\nSecretary.’[290] Preparing a list of distillers who would be affected,\r\non which to base an argument, Maclay knocked at the committee room. The\r\ndoor opened and the eager eye of the Senator caught a glimpse of\r\nHamilton at the table before Robert Morris closed it, as he stepped\r\noutside. With his suspicions confirmed, the gruff old Democrat left his\r\npapers with his colleague and turned away. ‘I suppose no further use was\r\nmade of it,’ he commented.[291] When the bill passed four days later,\r\nhe thought ‘war and bloodshed ... the most likely consequence’; and\r\nconcluded that ‘Congress may go home’ since ‘Mr. Hamilton is\r\nall-powerful and fails in nothing he attempts.’[292]\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion had been reached by Jefferson before. Just after the\r\npassage of the bill, he was writing a friend of his fears of the effect\r\nof the policies of the Treasury upon the people. Even though they were\r\nright, ‘more attention should be paid to the general opinion.’ The\r\nexcise had passed--the Bank Bill would pass. Perhaps the only corrective\r\nfor ‘what is corrupt in our present form of government’ would be an\r\nincrease in the membership of the House ‘so as to grant a more\r\nagricultural representation which may put that interest above that of\r\nthe stock jobbers.’[293]\r\n\r\nJefferson had reached the end of his patience, and was preparing to\r\nchallenge the pretensions, policies, and power of his ardent and\r\ndictatorial young colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that a national bank should be a feature of Hamilton’s\r\nfinancial system. Long before a national government loomed large as a\r\nprobability, he had conceived the plan, and with the temerity of\r\nyouthful audacity had solemnly outlined it in letters to Robert\r\nMorris.[294] With the opportunity before him, he moved with confident\r\nstrides to his purpose, and the day after his recommendation of an\r\nexcise reached Congress, his ‘Report on the Bank’ was read. His rare\r\nfamiliarity with the principles of finance, the history of banking, and\r\nthe banking experiences of nations made his ‘Report’ a persuasive\r\ndocument.[295] Its adoption was as inevitable as its submission. He was\r\non the very peak of his power. Commerce and wealth in all the cities\r\nwere saluting him, for his policies were in their interest, and the\r\nprofessional and intellectual class had been won by the dazzling success\r\nof his daring undertakings. In House and Senate he numbered among the\r\nregisters of his will the greater part of the strong and the brilliant.\r\nSomehow, too, the impression was prevalent that he was the favorite\r\ninstrument through which Washington wrought his plans. If the small\r\nfarmers and the mechanics seemed acquiescent, it only meant that they\r\nwere inarticulate--but inarticulate they were as this dashing figure\r\nmoved on from triumph to triumph with a shouting multitude of merchants,\r\nlawyers, politicians, and speculators in his wake.\r\n\r\nThus, when the Bank Bill reached the Senate, Maclay expressed the\r\ngeneral feeling in the comment that ‘it is totally in vain to oppose\r\nthis bill.’[296] Ten days later, he was all the more convinced at a\r\ndinner where he met Morris and sat between two ‘merchants of\r\nconsiderable note,’ and observed, on mentioning the Bank, that they were\r\n‘magnetically drawn to the contemplation of the moneyed interest.’[297]\r\n\r\nIf the bill passed the Senate without a conflict, it was not to get\r\nthrough the House without a skirmish which was to mark, as some\r\nhistorians think, the definite commencement of party warfare.\r\n\r\nThe House debate was brief but sharp, though pitched upon a higher plane\r\nthan some preceding discussions. There was some questioning of the\r\nnecessity of a bank; some criticism of the monopolistic features of the\r\nbank proposed; but Madison, who spoke at the beginning, furnished the\r\ndominant theme in his challenge to the constitutionality of such an\r\ninstitution. There was certainly no specific authorization of\r\ncongressional power in the Constitution. This was conceded by Hamilton,\r\nwho boldly evoked the doctrine of implied powers. It required no\r\nabnormal perspicacity to foresee the unlimited possibilities of these.\r\nHere was something read into the Constitution that would, rightly or\r\nwrongly, have made its ratification impossible had it provided a\r\nspecific grant of such power. Hamilton and many of his lieutenants had\r\nbeen frankly dissatisfied with the powers that had been conceded by the\r\npeople; and here was an opening for the acquisition of power that the\r\npeople would have refused. This to-day--what to-morrow?\r\n\r\nWhen Madison rose to oppose the Bank, we may be sure that it was after\r\nmany intimate conversations with Jefferson. He spoke in low tones and\r\nwith his customary dignity and precision and without abuse, and his\r\nargument was not susceptible to an easy assault. After all, ‘the Father\r\nof the Constitution’ knew something about his child.\r\n\r\n‘The doctrine of implication is always a tender one,’ he said. ‘The\r\ndanger of it has been felt by other governments. The delicacy was felt\r\nin the adoption of our own; the danger may also be felt if we do not\r\nkeep close to our chartered authorities.... If implications thus remote\r\nand thus multiplied may be linked together, a chain may be formed that\r\nwill reach every object of legislation, every object within the whole\r\ncompass of political economy.’ More than that--‘It takes from our\r\nconstituents the opportunity of deliberating on the untried measure,\r\nalthough their hands are also to be tied by the same terms.’ More\r\nstill--‘it involves a monopoly which affects the equal rights of every\r\ncitizen.’[298]\r\n\r\nOn the next day Fisher Ames made his defense of the doctrine of implied\r\npowers. The argument of Madison had impressed him as ‘a great speech,’\r\nbut steeped in ‘casuistry and sophistry.’ He thought Madison had wasted\r\nhis time, however, in reading the debates on constitutional powers in\r\nthe various State ratifying conventions--not at all to the purpose. ‘No\r\nman would pretend to give Congress the power,’ he wrote, ‘against a fair\r\nconstruction of the Constitution.’[299]\r\n\r\nBut the clever Ames had no intention of making such a frank admission on\r\nthe floor. He was a practical man and he defended the Hamiltonian\r\ndoctrine with eloquence and vigor.[300] With these two speeches, the\r\ndebate might as well have closed, but it continued long enough to permit\r\nthe Hamiltonian Old Guard to say their pieces. Giles argued and Jackson\r\nraved in opposition, and the measure passed with a margin of nineteen\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that nineteen of the twenty votes in opposition were\r\nthose of Southern members, the only Northerner in the list being\r\nJonathan Grout of Massachusetts, a Democrat, who did not return to the\r\nnext Congress. Like preceding Hamiltonian measures, this meant the\r\nconcentration of the financial resources of the country in the\r\ncommercial North to the disadvantage of the agricultural South. But this\r\nwas not the only reason. With the Southerners, among whom banks were a\r\nrarity, and the Westerners, to whom they were as meaningless as the\r\ncanals on Mars, the advantage of such an institution was not felt. In\r\nboth sections anything that hinted of monopoly was abhorrent. Thus, in\r\naddition to the constitutional difference, there was an economic\r\nconflict that was sectional in its nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut the battle was not yet won. The conflict was transferred to the\r\nCabinet, for Washington was not at all convinced that there was no\r\nconstitutional prohibition. Not only did he withhold his signature till\r\nthe last minute, but there are reasons to believe that he had a veto in\r\nmind almost to the end. For Madison, with whose part in the framing of\r\nthe Constitution he was familiar, he had a profound respect. Having\r\ndiscussed the bill with Jefferson informally, Washington requested\r\nwritten opinions from both Jefferson and Randolph, the Attorney-General.\r\nBoth were in complete accord with the conclusions of Madison. The\r\nopinion of Jefferson, expressed with all his force of reasoning, was a\r\npowerful challenge to the doctrine of implied powers.[301]\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time that Washington summoned Madison to the Morris\r\nhouse, which served as the Executive Mansion in Philadelphia, to invite\r\na fuller expression of his views. The great man listened in silence, and\r\nMadison thought with sympathy, while the little giant of the\r\nConstitutional Convention, out of the wealth of his learning and\r\nexperience, poured forth his reasons for opposition. Not once, but\r\nseveral times, the little figure of Madison must have been seen entering\r\nthe Morris house in those days of suppressed excitement, for there were\r\nnumerous conferences. As the ten-day period followed for the affixing of\r\nthe presidential signature was drawing to an end, and Washington\r\nrequested his friend to reduce his objections to writing, Madison\r\nassumed that it was a veto message he was asked to frame. Nor was it a\r\nfar-fetched assumption, for on more than one occasion the President had\r\nmade use of Madison’s pen.[302]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Hamiltonians, at first puzzled, became alarmed. From the\r\ntemper of their talk in Philadelphia, Madison was convinced that in the\r\nevent of a veto they were ready for open opposition to Washington,\r\nbacked by the wealth and influence of the powerful.[303] Ugly, silly\r\nstories, reflecting upon the great personage on whom the Hamiltonians\r\nfound it profitable to claim a monopoly, were set afloat. Fisher Ames\r\ngave currency in Boston to the theory that Washington was influenced by\r\nthe fear that the establishment of a financial capital in Philadelphia\r\nwould prevent the removal of the political capital to the banks of the\r\nstream that washed the boundary of Mount Vernon.[304] If some discretion\r\nwas used in Philadelphia, where the grumbling was confined to the\r\nfashionable drawing-rooms, no such circumspection was observed in New\r\nYork, where the meanest motives were ascribed to the President, and\r\namong the speculators and Tory sympathizers open threats were made.\r\nMadison heard, while there a little later, that ‘the licentiousness of\r\n[these] tongues exceeded anything that was conceived.’[305] This\r\nstruggle marked a definitive break in the relations of Hamilton and\r\nJefferson. The dictatorial disposition of the former would brook no\r\nopposition, and he was temperamentally incapable of a differentiation\r\nbetween political opposition and personal hostility. The fact that\r\nJefferson, in response to a command from Washington, had written an\r\nopinion against the Bank could bear only one interpretation--‘asperity\r\nand ill humor toward me.’[306] The fact that Washington accepted\r\nHamilton’s view, did not, however, shake Jefferson’s faith in the\r\nPresident, and in defeat nothing so ill-tempered escaped him as flowed\r\nin a stream from the Federalists when threatened with defeat. Within a\r\nmonth after Hamilton had won his fight, Jefferson, in commenting to a\r\nfriend on what he conceived to be a dangerous trend, wrote that ‘it is\r\nfortunate that our first executive magistrate is purely and zealously\r\nrepublican’--the highest praise he could bestow.[307]\r\n\r\nThe press was not verbose in its comments on the bill, albeit Freneau\r\nfought it in the ‘Federal Gazette.’[308] The ‘Pennsylvania Gazette’ was\r\nungraceful in defeat. Denouncing the Bank as ‘a proposition made to the\r\nmoneyed interest,’ it commented on its ‘preparations to subscribe,’ and\r\nfound ‘the terms ... so advantageous that no equal object of speculation\r\nis perhaps presented in any quarter of the globe.’[309] Fenno offered\r\nhis best in a verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘The States as one agree that this is right\r\n     Let pigmy politicians rave and write.’[310]\r\n\r\nThus the First Congress closed its labors with no little rhapsodizing in\r\nthe press over the results. A New York paper offered an epitaph of\r\nglorification,[311] which a Boston paper condensed into the simple\r\ncomment that it had ‘established public confidence and credit,\r\nreconciled the jarring interests of discontented States, and cemented\r\nthe people in the bonds of harmony, peace and love.’[312]\r\n\r\nOne man, at least, had cause for jubilation. In two years Hamilton had\r\nrisen to a position of commanding power, proved his genius in\r\nconstructive statesmanship, accomplished everything he had set out to\r\ndo, made himself the idol of the wealthy and the powerful, the\r\nrecognized leader of the influential commercial class, the acknowledged\r\nhead of a brilliant and militant party. His friends were comparing him\r\nto Pitt, then in the heyday of his power--and he was only on the\r\nthreshold. So great was the enthusiasm in commercial circles that he\r\nmade a special trip to New York to accept the homage of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce at a reception, to linger a week among his worshipers, and to\r\nreturn to Philadelphia reinvigorated by the wine of idolatry pressed to\r\nhis lips.[313] At that moment he was on the top of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jefferson and Madison drove out of Philadelphia together on\r\none of those journeys of recreation during which politicians so often\r\nplan the strategy of war. Historians have found more in this journey\r\nthan is to be discovered in the record. The trip through New England\r\nprobably had no other object than that of pleasure and enlightenment.\r\nThe relations of these two men were beautiful and went far beyond a mere\r\ncongeniality in political opinions. There was a marked similarity in\r\ntheir characters. Both scholarly in their tastes, the books that\r\ninterested one were certain to appeal to the other. Here were two men\r\nwhose spirits were in accord. It is easy to think of them as sitting the\r\ncandle out in converse about the winter fire, or as sitting far into the\r\nnight in silence, each finding pleasure in the mere presence of the\r\nother. Such a relationship had grown up through the years. They thought\r\nalike, found similar enjoyment in agricultural pursuits, and in the many\r\nlittle things of common life.\r\n\r\n‘What say you,’ wrote Jefferson just before the beginning of the\r\nmuch-discussed journey, ‘to taking a wade into the country at noon? It\r\nwill be pleasant above head at least, and the party will finish by\r\ndining here. Information that Colonel Beckwith[314] is coming to be an\r\nintimate with you, and I presume not a desirable one, encourages me to\r\nmake a proposition which I did not venture as long as you had your\r\nagreeable congressional society about you; that is to come and take a\r\nbed and plate with me.... To me it will be a relief from the solitude of\r\nwhich I have too much; and it will lessen your repugnance to be assured\r\nthat it will not increase my expenses an atom.... The approaching season\r\nwill render this situation more agreeable than Fifth Street, and even in\r\nthe winter you will not find it disagreeable.’[315] It required no\r\nassiduous and cunning cultivation by Jefferson to wean Madison away from\r\nHamilton. The relations of the first two far antedated those of the\r\nlast. Madison had agreed with Hamilton on the necessity for a more\r\npermanent and substantial union. They had fought together for the\r\nratification of the Constitution, but such were their temperamental\r\ndifferences that the breach which quickly appeared was inevitable when\r\nit came to the determination of the policies of that union. While\r\nJefferson was still in Paris, Madison, without consulting his friend,\r\nwas foreshadowing the policy of the future Jeffersonian party in his\r\nfight for discrimination against England in the revenue measure of the\r\nfirst congressional session. He proposed discrimination between the\r\noriginal creditors and the speculators before he had the opportunity to\r\ndiscuss the subject with Jefferson. If there was an accord with the\r\nlatter, it was due less to the influence of one upon the other than to\r\nthe similarity of their thinking. The little man with the mild, almost\r\nshy expression, who rode out of Philadelphia with Jefferson that spring\r\nof 1791, was much too big to have been led around by the nose by any of\r\nhis contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAs early as the spring of 1791, the names of the two were associated in\r\nthe minds of many as the prospective leaders of a party that would\r\nchallenge the purposes of the Federalists. Answering a series of\r\narticles in the ‘Maryland Journal,’ some one advised the author of how\r\nto make his opinions worth while. ‘Keep always before your eyes the\r\nsteps by which Jefferson and Madison have gradually ascended to their\r\npresent preëminence of fame. Like them you must devote your whole\r\nleisure to the most useful reading. Like them you must dive into the\r\ndepths of philosophy and government.’[316] Thus they were already\r\nassociated in the public mind, and there was some whispering among the\r\nFederalist leaders when they set forth in their carriage.\r\n\r\nBumping and splashing over the rough tree-lined roads those spring days,\r\nthey unquestionably discussed the political situation, but these\r\ndiscussions were only the continuation of others that had been\r\nproceeding throughout the previous fall and winter. If politics was the\r\nobject of the journey, they were both remarkably successful in covering\r\ntheir tracks. There is nothing in the letter Jefferson wrote his\r\ndaughter Mary to indicate anything more than a pleasure jaunt.[317] In a\r\nletter to his other daughter, Martha, we hear much of fishing for\r\nspeckled trout, salmon, and bass, of the strawberries in bloom, of\r\nvegetation and agricultural conditions--but nothing of politics.[318] To\r\nhis son-in-law he wrote descriptions of historic places, of botanical\r\nobjects and scenery, and of running foul of the blue law in Vermont\r\nprohibiting traveling on Sunday.[319] The one reference to the journey\r\nin the correspondence of Madison merely says that ‘it was a very\r\nagreeable one, and carried us through an interesting country, new to us\r\nboth.’[320] In none of these letters do we find a single reference to\r\npolitics or politicians.\r\n\r\nSomething is made of the call of the travelers on Burr and Livingston\r\nwhen in New York, and on Governor Clinton at Albany; but their conduct\r\nwould have been suspicious only if they had failed to observe the\r\nordinary amenities of social life in calling upon the leading public\r\ncharacters in the towns through which they passed. Still we may safely\r\nsurmise that they found time while waiting for the fish to bite to\r\nexchange views on the necessity of organizing an opposition to the\r\nFederalists. It is even possible that out of these conversations on\r\ncountry roads actually sprang the Democratic Party, but there is no\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOn his return to Philadelphia, Jefferson found himself the center of a\r\nremarkable newspaper controversy. Fascinated by the beauty of Marie\r\nAntoinette, Edmund Burke of England had written his bitter attack, not\r\nonly on the excesses of the French Revolution, but upon its democratic\r\nprinciples as well. It was the fashion in those days to conceal a hate\r\nof democracy under the cloak of a simulated horror over the crimes of\r\nthe Terrorists. Thomas Paine had replied to Burke with his brilliant and\r\neloquent defense of democracy, ‘The Rights of Man.’ In American circles\r\nwhere democracy was anathema, and even republicanism was discussed with\r\ncynicism, the Burke pamphlet was received with enthusiasm. It was not\r\nuntil some time later that ‘The Rights of Man’ reached New York, albeit\r\nits nature was known and there had been a keen curiosity to see it.\r\nEarly in May, Madison had promised Jefferson to secure a copy as soon as\r\npossible. He understood that the pamphlet had been suppressed in\r\nEngland, and that Paine had found it convenient to retire to Paris.\r\n‘This,’ he wrote, ‘may account for his not sending copies to friends in\r\nthis country.’[321] At length a single copy arrived and was loaned by\r\nits owner to Madison, who passed it on to Jefferson. He read it with\r\nenthusiasm. Here was a spirited defense of democracy, and of the fight\r\nthe French were waging for their liberties; here an excoriation of the\r\nprattle in high social and governmental circles of the advantage, if not\r\nnecessity, for titles of nobility. Here was not only an answer to Burke,\r\nbut to John Adams, whose ‘Discourses of Davilla’ had been running for\r\nweeks in Fenno’s paper, and had been copied extensively in other\r\njournals with a similar slant. Jefferson was immensely pleased.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished with it, the owner had called upon Madison for\r\nits return, as arrangements had been made for its publication by a\r\nPhiladelphia printer. It was agreed that Jefferson should send it\r\ndirectly to the print shop, and in the transmission he wrote a brief\r\nexplanation of the delay, and added: ‘I am extremely pleased to find it\r\nwill be reprinted here, and that something is at length to be publicly\r\nsaid against the political heresies which have sprung up among us. I\r\nhave no doubt our citizens will rally a second time round the standard\r\nof “Common Sense.”’\r\n\r\nTo this note he attached so little importance that he kept no copy. With\r\nastonishment he found that the printer had used his note as the preface,\r\nwith his name and official title as Secretary of State. The general\r\nconviction that the word ‘heresies’ was meant to apply to the Adams\r\npapers sufficiently indicates the popular interpretation of their trend.\r\nThe storm broke.\r\n\r\nMajor Beckwith, the British Agent, hastened to express his pained\r\nsurprise to Washington’s Secretary at the recommendation by the\r\nSecretary of State of a pamphlet which had been suppressed in England.\r\nThe secretary was sufficiently impressed by the scandalized tone of the\r\naristocratic society of Philadelphia, which was usually lionizing some\r\ndegenerate members of the European nobility, to write his chief in\r\ndetail. When Randolph dined with Mrs. Washington, Lear retailed it to\r\nhim, and the suggestion was made that Jefferson should know. Thus there\r\nwas something more than a tempest in a teapot. Everywhere men were\r\npartisans of the pamphlets of Burke or Paine, the aristocrats on one\r\nside, the democrats on the other, the stoutest of the republicans\r\neverywhere delighted with ‘The Rights of Man.’ This was true in even the\r\nsmall towns and the villages of far places. One traveler passing through\r\nReading was surprised to find the two pamphlets the ‘general topic of\r\nconversation,’ and he was assured of the delight that awaited him in the\r\nreading of Paine’s.[322] All too long had the Americans been drugged\r\nwith Fenno’s deification of the upper classes--with John Adams’s\r\n‘Discourses’ on the necessity of ‘distinctions’--and here was old\r\n‘Common Sense’ back again in the old form slashing the aristocrats fore\r\nand aft. The press responded to the popular demand, and everywhere ‘The\r\nRights of Man’ was being published serially to be eagerly read by the\r\nthousands who had not seen the pamphlet. But it was not all one-sided.\r\nIf the ‘Painites’ wrote furiously in some papers, the ‘Burkites’ were\r\nprolific in Fenno’s and a few others. In the fashionable drawing-rooms a\r\npoll would have shown a decided preference for the defender of\r\naristocracy who had wept so eloquently over the woes of a frivolous\r\nQueen. Nowhere was Burke so popular and Paine so loathed as in the home\r\nof Adams, the Vice-President. ‘What do you think of Paine’s pamphlet?’\r\nasked Dr. Rush, to whom society was cooling because of his democratic\r\ntendencies. The second official of the Republic hesitated as if for\r\ndramatic effect, and then, solemnly laying his hand upon his heart, he\r\nanswered, ‘I detest that book and its tendency from the bottom of my\r\nheart.’ Indeed, most of the Federalists were frankly with Burke.\r\n‘Although Mr. Burke may have carried his veneration for old\r\nestablishments too far, and may not have made sufficient allowance for\r\nthe imperfections of human nature in the conflict of the French\r\nRevolution,’ wrote Davie to Judge Iredell, ‘yet I think his letter\r\ncontains a sufficient amount of intelligence to have rescued him from\r\nthe undistinguishing abuse of Paine.’[323]\r\n\r\nWith most of the Federalist leaders in sympathy with Burke, few ventured\r\nto attack Paine in the open. Not so with Adams who was spluttering mad\r\nover the Jefferson ‘preface.’ He was positive that the publication of\r\nPaine’s pamphlet in this country had been instigated by his former\r\ncolleague at Paris.[324] To him the pamphlet of Paine, the ‘preface’ of\r\nJefferson, the acclaim for both on the part of the people was but a\r\ndevilish conspiracy of Jefferson’s to pull him down. ‘More of\r\nJefferson’s subterranean tricks.’ And with this conviction, John Quincy\r\nAdams, the son, then in Boston, took up a trenchant pen to write the\r\narticles of ‘Publicola’ for the ‘Centinel,’ sneering at the Jeffersonian\r\nnote to the printer, assailing Paine and democracy, and stoutly\r\ndefending the governmental forms of England. So well did he discharge\r\nhis filial duty that his articles were published in pamphlet form in\r\nEngland by the friends of Burke, and many of the Federalist papers\r\nreproduced them as they appeared.\r\n\r\nThen the newspaper battle began in earnest. Many indignant democrats\r\nrushed to the attack of ‘Publicola’ with all the greater zest because of\r\nthe belief that ‘Publicola’ was none other than ‘Davilla’ himself.\r\n‘America will not attend to this antiquated sophistry,’ wrote one,\r\n‘whether decorated by the gaudy ornaments of a Burke, the curious\r\npatch-work of a Parr to which all antiquity must have contributed its\r\nprettiest rags and tatters, or the homely ungraceful garb which has\r\nbeen furnished her by Mr. John Adams.’[325] Another suggested that\r\n‘Publicola’ would soon cease to write since ‘the time for the new\r\nelection is approaching,’ although the ‘Discourses’ might be continued\r\nwithout danger since ‘dullness, like the essence of opium, sets every\r\nreader to sleep before he has passed the third sentence.’[326] As for\r\n‘Publicola,’ his letters were ‘being brought forward to persuade the\r\npeople that an hereditary nobility, and, of consequence, high salaries,\r\npomp and parade are essential to the prosperity of the country.’[327] In\r\nBoston, where the letters were appearing, ‘Agricola’ and ‘Brutus’ began\r\nspirited replies in the rival paper.[328] Other writers, with less grace\r\nand force, joined in the fray. Who are to constitute our nobility,\r\ndemanded ‘Republican,’ our moneyed men--the speculators? If so ‘Dukes,\r\nLords and Earls will swarm like insects gendered by the sun,’ and the\r\nworn-out soldier who had been tricked out of his paper would have the\r\nsatisfaction of ‘bowing most submissively to their lordships while\r\nseated in their carriages.’[329]\r\n\r\nBut Adams was not without his defenders. ‘An American’ declared that all\r\nthe abuse was ‘designed as a political ladder by which to climb.’\r\nMiserable creatures! ‘Ages after the tide of time has swept their names\r\ninto oblivion, the immortal deeds of Adams will shine on the brightest\r\npages of history.’[330] ‘The Ploughman’ indignantly resented the\r\ninsinuation that Adams had written the ‘Publicola’ letters. In truth,\r\n‘his friends consider Dr. Adams as being calumniated’ by having such\r\nsentiments ascribed to him.[331] To all the ‘hornets’ that were buzzing\r\nabout Adams, Fenno felt he could be indifferent, for they had no stings.\r\nThey were merely nonentities trying to give consequence to their\r\nscribblings by appearing to be answering the Vice-President.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jefferson was keenly enjoying the turmoil. We wish it were\r\npossible to trace it all to his contrivance, for nothing could have\r\nserved his purpose better. To have foreseen that the writing of a few\r\nsimple lines would have awakened the militant republicanism of the\r\ncountry and have aroused the democratic impulses of the inert mass would\r\nhave been complimentary to his political genius. But this is not the\r\nonly instance where a clever politician with the reputation of a\r\nmagician has stumbled forward. There is no doubt that Jefferson was\r\nastonished and embarrassed on learning that the printer had made an\r\nunauthorized use of his personal note. He admitted to Washington that he\r\nhad Adams’s writings in mind, but that nothing was more remote from his\r\nthoughts than of becoming ‘a contributor before the public.’ However, he\r\nwas not impressed with the reflections on his taste. ‘Their real fear,’\r\nhe added, ‘is that this popular and republican pamphlet ... is likely\r\n... to wipe out all the unconstitutional doctrines which their\r\nbellwether, Davilla, has been preaching for a twelve-month.’[332] This\r\nexplanation was enough for Knox, who wrote accordingly to Adams,[333]\r\nbut not enough for Jefferson who sent a frank explanation to Adams with\r\nan expression of regret. In generous mood, the latter accepted the\r\nexplanation with the protestation that their old friendship was ‘still\r\ndear to my heart,’ and that ‘there is no office I would not resign\r\nrather than give a just occasion for one friend to desert me.’[334]\r\n\r\nMadison, to whom Jefferson had sent a similar explanation, had assumed\r\nthat there had been a mistake or an imposition, but he could see no\r\nreason for indignation on the part of Adams or his friends. ‘Surely,’ he\r\nwrote, ‘if it be innocent and decent for one servant of the public to\r\nwrite against its government, it cannot be very criminal or indecent in\r\nanother to patronize a written defence of the principles on which that\r\nGovernment is founded.’[335]\r\n\r\nHowever much Jefferson may have regretted the unauthorized use of his\r\nletter, he rejoiced in its effect. He wrote Paine that the controversy\r\nhad awakened the people, shown the ‘monocrats’ that the silence of the\r\nmasses concerning the teachings of ‘Davilla’ did not mean that they had\r\nbeen converted ‘to the doctrine of king, lords and commons,’ and that\r\nthey were ‘confirmed in their good old faith.’[336] The incident had\r\nestablished Jefferson in the public mind as the outstanding leader of\r\ndemocracy, had set the public tongue to wagging on politics again. More\r\nwas involved in the pamphlets of Burke and Paine than differences over\r\nthe French Revolution. The keynote of Burke’s was aristocracy and\r\nprivilege; that of Paine’s was democracy and equal rights. The former\r\nwas the gospel of the American Federalists; the latter the covenant of\r\nthe American Democracy. Studying the reactions with his characteristic\r\nkeenness, Jefferson was convinced that the time was ripe to mobilize for\r\nthe inevitable struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n‘What do you think of this scrippomony?’ Jefferson wrote to Edward\r\nRutledge in the late summer. ‘Ships are lying idle at the wharfs,\r\nbuildings are stopped, capital withdrawn from commerce, manufactures,\r\narts and agriculture to be employed in gambling, and the tide of public\r\nprosperity ... is arrested in its course.... I imagine that we shall\r\nhear that all the cash has quitted the extremities of the nation and\r\naccumulated here.’[337] As he wrote, Jefferson had before him the report\r\nof the craze which had just reached him in a letter from Madison in New\r\nYork. ‘Stock and scrip the sole domestic subjects of conversation ...\r\nspeculations ... carried on with money borrowed at from two and a half\r\nper cent a month to one per cent a week.’[338]\r\n\r\nMen grown reckless with the frenzy of the intoxication were resorting to\r\nfraud to rob the Government, many taking out administration papers for\r\ndeceased soldiers who had left no heirs. ‘By this knavery,’ wrote\r\nMadison at an earlier period, ‘a prodigious sum will be unsaved by the\r\npublic, and reward the worst of its citizens.’ And suppose one of the\r\nclerks of the account offices is not proof against the temptation?[339]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the summer (July 10th) Bank stock had risen as much in\r\nthe market in New York as in Philadelphia with the feeling that there\r\nwas a certainty of gain. A scramble had set in ‘for so much public\r\nplunder.’ The meticulously scrupulous Madison, with his lofty notions of\r\nofficial propriety, was shocked to find ‘the members of the Legislature\r\nwho were most active in pushing this job openly grasping the\r\nemoluments.’ Schuyler, the father-in-law of Hamilton, was to be the head\r\nof the directors of the Bank ‘if the weight of the New York subscribers\r\ncan effect it.’ Stock-jobbing monopolized all conversation. The\r\ncoffee-houses buzzed with the gamblers.[340]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, from the high-placed to the ordinary scamp, men maddened, by\r\nthe money-itch, were resorting to ordinary crime to get possession of\r\npublic paper. In some places clever counterfeiters were driving through\r\nthe country under the pretext of examining securities with the idea of\r\npurchase and cleverly exchanging the worthless for the real.[341] In the\r\nSouth and in the remote parts of Maine, swindlers were scouring the\r\nwoods for State notes, lying to the uninformed and ignorant about their\r\nvalue, and getting them for a song. ‘What must be the feelings of the\r\nwidow and orphan,’ wrote a correspondent of a Philadelphia paper, ‘when\r\nthey find themselves thus defrauded of a great part of their little all,\r\nand that, not unlikely, the earnings of their late husbands and fathers,\r\nwho died in the service of their country, by these pests of society who\r\nought to be despised?’[342] But greed knew no shame. An appalling\r\npicture: members of Congress feathering their nest through their\r\nlegislative acts, counterfeiters robbing the unwary, common crooks\r\nstealing from the Government by posing as the administrators of the\r\ndead, and distinguished members of the Boston Bar, like Otis and Gore,\r\nspeculating with their clients’ money without their knowledge or\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nSo sinister was the situation that notes of warning began to appear in\r\nthe newspapers. The ‘Pennsylvania Gazette’ found that speculators had\r\n‘turned raving mad, and others so agitated that they appear on the\r\nborders of insanity.’[343] Fenno tried vainly to restore sobriety to the\r\ndrunk--for Hamilton himself was shocked and not a little concerned.[344]\r\nBetter be careful about parting with Bank scrip, warned the ‘New York\r\nDaily Advertiser.’ Efforts were being made to buy up all the scrip in\r\nthe city ‘and for this purpose a powerful combination was formed ... on\r\nSaturday night to reduce the price.’[345] Beware of another South Sea\r\nBubble, warned ‘Centinel’ in the same paper. ‘The National Bank stock\r\nhas risen so high, so enormously above its real value, that no two\r\ntransactions in the annals of history can be found to equal\r\nit....’[346]\r\n\r\nFrom Boston came similar stories of the madness. All the while the New\r\nYork papers were publishing day-by-day quotations on the scrip.[347] By\r\nAugust 15th the mania was at its height. ‘It has risen like a rocket,’\r\nwrote an amused scribbler. ‘Like a rocket it will burst with a crack and\r\ndown drops the rocket stick. What goes up must come down--so take care\r\nof your pate, brother Jonathan.’[348] The craze was becoming ridiculous.\r\nThe sane and the honest looked upon it as a spectacle. Above the angry\r\ncries in the market-place rang the laughter of the observers who kept\r\ntheir heads. Some put their scoffing into verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘What magic this among the people,\r\n     That swells a Maypole to a steeple?’[349]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bubble showed signs of bursting. A New York bank stopped\r\ndiscounting for some of the speculators. Messengers hurried forth with\r\nthe ominous news, horses’ hoofs hammering the Jersey roads to\r\nPhiladelphia, where there was consternation and a falling-off in\r\nbuying.[350] Pay-day had not yet come, but it was on the way, and men\r\nbegan to regain their senses.\r\n\r\nThen came the emergence of the political phase. ‘Does history afford an\r\ninstance,’ asked one observer, ‘where inequality in property, without\r\nany adequate consideration, ever before so suddenly took place in the\r\nworld? or the basis of the power and influence of an Aristocracy was\r\ncreated?’[351] A Boston paper commented significantly on the ease with\r\nwhich the mere opening and closing of the galleries of Congress could\r\nserve the purposes of speculation. ‘How easily might this be done should\r\nany member of Congress be inclined to speculate.’[352]\r\n\r\nThus the talk of a ‘corrupt squadron’ in the First Congress was not the\r\ninvention of Jefferson--it was the talk of the highways and the byways,\r\nthe coffee-houses and the taverns, and we find it recurring in the\r\ncorrespondence of the public men of the period. Everywhere sudden\r\nfortunes sprang up as if by magic. There was a rumbling and grumbling in\r\nthe offing. With the people thinking more seriously of Madison’s fight\r\nfor discrimination, he began to loom along with Jefferson as a\r\nprospective leader against the ‘system.’ With the discovery that the law\r\nhad been violated in the subscription of more than thirty shares, it was\r\nhoped that it would ‘draw the attention of Madison ... immediately on\r\nthe meeting of Congress’ and that ‘the whole proceedings ... be declared\r\nnugatory.’[353]\r\n\r\nThen came the election of Bank directors in the fall, and indignation\r\nflamed when the prizes went to leaders in the Congress that had created\r\nthe Bank--to Rufus King, Samuel Johnson of North Carolina, William Smith\r\nof South Carolina, Jeremiah Wadsworth of the ‘fast sailing vessels,’\r\nJohn Laurance of New York, William Bingham of Philadelphia, Charles\r\nCarroll of Carrollton, George Cabot, Fisher Ames, and Thomas Willing,\r\nthe partner of Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress had speculated heavily and profitably on their\r\nknowledge of their own intent in legislation; they were owners of bank\r\nscrip of the Bank they created, and their leaders were on the board of\r\ndirectors. There was talk among the people of a ‘corrupt squadron,’ and\r\nJefferson did not invent the term; he found it in the street and used\r\nit. Though Hamilton, scrupulously honest, was not involved in\r\nproceedings that were vicious, if not corrupt, many of his lieutenants\r\nwere, and that, for the purposes of politics, made an issue.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was in the saddle, booted and spurred, and riding hard\r\ntoward the realization of his conception of government, followed by an\r\narmy that fairly glittered with the brilliancy of many of his field\r\nmarshals, and which was imposing in the financial, social, and cultural\r\nsuperiority of the rank and file; an army that could count on the\r\ngreater part of the press to publish its orders of the day, and on the\r\nbeneficiaries of its policies to fill its campaign coffers. And it was\r\nat this juncture that Jefferson began the mobilization of an army that\r\nwould seem uncouth and ragged by comparison. The cleavage was distinct;\r\nthe ten-year war was on.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to the story of the struggle, it is important to know\r\nmore of the character and methods of the man who dared challenge\r\nHamilton’s powerful array and something of the social atmosphere in\r\nPhiladelphia where the great battles were fought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON: A PORTRAIT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the personal appearance of Thomas Jefferson there was little to\r\ndenote the powerful, dominating leader and strict disciplinarian that he\r\nwas. Unlike Hamilton, he did not look the commander so much as the\r\nrather shy philosopher. The gruff Maclay, on seeing him for the first\r\ntime, was disappointed with his slender frame, the looseness of his\r\nfigure, and the ‘air of stiffness in his manner,’ while pleased with the\r\nsunniness of his face.[354] He was of imposing height, being more than\r\nsix feet, and slender without being thin.[355] All contemporaries who\r\nhave left descriptions refer to the long, loosely jointed limbs, and\r\nnone of them convey an impression of grace. His hair, much redder than\r\nthat of Hamilton, was combed loosely over the forehead and at the side,\r\nand tied behind. His complexion was light, his eyes blue and usually\r\nmild in expression, his forehead broad and high. Beneath the eyes, his\r\nface was rather broad, the cheek-bones high, the chin noticeably long,\r\nand the mouth of generous size. The casual glance discovered more of\r\nbenevolence than force, more of subtlety than pugnacity. Nor, in that\r\nday of lace and frills, was there anything in his garb to proclaim him\r\nof the élite. His enemies then, and ever since, have made too much of\r\nhis loose carpet slippers and worn clothes, and the only thing they\r\nprove is that he may have had the Lincolnian indifference to style. Long\r\nbefore he made his ‘pose’ in the President’s house for the benefit of\r\nthe groundlings, we find a critic who was to be numbered among his\r\nfollowers complaining because his clothes were too small for his\r\nbody.[356] The truth, no doubt, is that he dressed conventionally,\r\nbecause men must, and was careless of his attire.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that when she first met him, Mrs. Bayard Smith, who had\r\nbeen unduly impressed with the Federalist references to the ‘coarseness\r\nand vulgarity of his manners,’ was astonished at the contradiction of\r\nthe caricature by the man. ‘So meek and mild, yet dignified in his\r\nmanners, with a voice so soft and low, with a countenance so benign and\r\nintelligent’ she found him.[357] In truth there was enough dignity in\r\nhis manner to discourage the stranger on a first approach, as Tom Moore\r\nfound to his disgust. Even Mrs. Smith thought his ‘dignified and\r\nreserved air’ chill at first;[358] and a French admirer who made a\r\nsentimental journey to Monticello thought him somewhat cold and\r\nreserved.’[359] ‘The cold first look he always cast upon a\r\nstranger’[360] appears too often in the observations of his\r\ncontemporaries to have been imaginary.\r\n\r\nAs some have found fault with his dress, others have criticized a\r\nslovenly way of sitting--‘in a lounging manner, on one hip commonly,\r\nwith one of his shoulders elevated much above the other’;[361] while\r\nanother--a woman too--was charmed at the ‘free and easy manner’ in which\r\nhe accepted a proffered chair.[362] The natural deduction from the\r\ncontradictions is that he seated himself as comfortably as possible with\r\nlittle regard to the picture in the pose. There is a manifest absurdity\r\nin the idea that the man who moved familiarly in the most cultured\r\ncircles of the most polished capital in Europe could have been either\r\nimpossible in dress or boorish in manner.\r\n\r\nBut there is one unpleasant criticism of his manner that cannot be so\r\neasily put aside--a shiftiness in his glance which bears out the charge\r\nof his enemies that he was lacking in frankness. The most democratic\r\nmember of the first Senate, meeting him for the first time, was\r\ndisappointed to find that ‘he had a rambling vacant look, and nothing of\r\nthat firm collected deportment which I expected would dignify the\r\npresence of a Secretary or Minister.’[363] Another found that ‘when\r\nspeaking he did not look at his auditor, but cast his eyes toward the\r\nceiling or anywhere but at the eye of his auditor.’[364] This weakness\r\nwas possibly overemphasized, for he was notoriously shy.\r\n\r\nAside from this, there is abundant evidence that there was an ineffable\r\ncharm in his manner. One who objected to his ‘shifty glance’ was\r\nfavorably impressed with ‘the simplicity and sobriety’ of his\r\ndeportment, and found that while ‘he was quiet and unobtrusive ... a\r\nstranger would perceive that he was in the presence of one who was not a\r\ncommon man.’[365] He was free of the affectations of pedantry, courteous\r\nand kindly, modest and tolerant. Thus he appeared to excellent advantage\r\nin conversation, and, with one exception, all who knew him and have left\r\ntheir impressions found him an entertaining and illuminating talker.\r\nMaclay, who was certainly not the most competent of judges, thought his\r\nconversation ‘loose and rambling,’ and yet admitted that ‘he scattered\r\ninformation wherever he went, and some even brilliant sentiments\r\nsparkled from him.’[366] It is probable that the gout-racked radical\r\nconfused conversation with set speeches, and quite as possible that on\r\nthis particular occasion, when Jefferson was meeting with a curious\r\nsenatorial committee, he was not inclined to tell all he knew.\r\n\r\nCertainly the polished nobleman, familiar with the most intellectual\r\ncircles of Paris, who found his ‘conversation of the most agreeable\r\nkind,’ and that he possessed ‘a stock of information not inferior to\r\nthat of any other man,’ and ‘in Europe ... would hold a distinguished\r\nrank among men of letters,’ was quite as competent a judge as the\r\nSenator from the wilderness of Pennsylvania.[367] Among men his manner\r\nof conversation was calm and deliberate, without the Johnsonian\r\n_ex-cathedra_ touch, and yet he ‘spoke like one who considered himself\r\nas entitled to deference.’[368] Among friends, and particularly women,\r\nhe appears to have been deferential and captivating in his tactful\r\nkindness. Then when, ‘with a manner and voice almost femininely soft and\r\ngentle,’ he ‘entered into conversation on the commonplace topics of the\r\nday,’ at least one woman found that ‘there was something in his manner,\r\nhis countenance and voice that at once unlocked [her] heart.’[369]\r\n\r\nSuch was the Jefferson seen superficially by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThose who prefer to think of Jefferson as an aristocrat, born to the\r\npurple, who departed from the paths of his fathers, refer only to the\r\nmaternal ancestry. The American founder of this branch of the family\r\nliked to think of himself as the descendant of gentlemen of title and of\r\nthe half-brother of Queen Mary. Jefferson preferred to dismiss this\r\nclaim on the aristocracy with the statement that his mother’s family\r\ntraced ‘their pedigree far back in England and Scotland, to which let\r\nevery one ascribe the faith and merit he chooses.’ From the Randolphs he\r\nprobably inherited his love of beauty, his fondness for luxury, but they\r\nfailed utterly to transmit to him any aristocratic notions of\r\ngovernment. There was a reason--his father was a middle-class farmer,\r\nand it was from him and his early environment that he received his\r\nearliest and most lasting political impressions.\r\n\r\nThis father was no ordinary man. Physically a giant, he was big in mind\r\nand strong in character. By the light of the log fire in the evenings,\r\nhe was wont to read Shakespeare, Swift, and Addison to his family. An\r\nardent Whig with advanced democratic ideas, he as a magistrate\r\nmanifested sympathy for the plain people.[370] His thousand acres at\r\nShadwell were in the wilderness and on the frontier, and his son was as\r\nmuch a Westerner in his boyhood as is the boy of Idaho to-day, for the\r\nWest is a relative term.\r\n\r\nThis Western boy at the most impressionable age was sent to school in\r\nLouisa County, which was then the hot-bed of radical democracy and\r\nPresbyterian dissent. The natives about him were in buckskin breeches\r\nand Indian moccasins, and, with no coat over their rough hunting shirts,\r\nthey covered their heads with coon-skin caps. It was a long cry from the\r\npolished circles of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to this typical\r\nWestern scene; if one was the East, the other was the West. The small\r\nproprietor farmers lived in crude cabins, and theirs was the hard lot of\r\nthe pioneer. Thus Jefferson’s training was that of the Westerner.[371]\r\n\r\nThe boy was father to the man. When he entered college at Williamsburg,\r\nhe found himself in the headquarters of the aristocracy, for there, at\r\nthe capital, the lords of the land had their winter homes where lavish\r\nhospitality was displayed. Into this society Jefferson was thrown, and\r\nhe moved therein as to the manor born--at heart a Western man with\r\nEastern polish.[372] It was not for nothing that there was Randolph\r\nblood in his veins.\r\n\r\nEven as he moved among the hard-drinking, fox-hunting imitators of the\r\nEnglish squires, his sympathies were enlisted in the growing democratic\r\nmovement of the small farmers among the upper rivers, the\r\ntobacco-growers, the hunters and trappers of the Alleghany slopes. The\r\nwestern counties, then the western frontier, had been populated by the\r\nScotch-Irish and Germans--earnest, hard-working, hard-thinking men, who\r\nwrestled with nature as with their consciences, built churches in the\r\nwoods, and school-houses in the clearing. These men were democrats, and\r\ntheir cause became the cause of Jefferson even while he was in college.\r\nVolumes have been written to explain Jefferson, but it was reserved for\r\nProfessor William E. Dodd to do it in a paragraph:\r\n\r\n     It is not difficult ... to see how the great principle of\r\n     Jefferson’s life--absolute faith in democracy--came to him. He was\r\n     the product of the first West in American history; he grew up with\r\n     men who ruled their country well, who fought the Indians\r\n     valiantly.... Jefferson loved his backwoods neighbors, and he, in\r\n     turn, was loved by them.[373]\r\n\r\nIf in college he was confirming his faith in democracy, born of his\r\nschooling in the land of the small farmers, he was burnishing his\r\nweapons for the fight. It is significant that he disliked Blackstone and\r\nliked Coke because he found the former a teacher of Toryism and the\r\nlatter a reflector of the philosophy of the Whigs. His training in the\r\nlaw was thorough, for he studied under George Wythe, with whom both\r\nMarshall and Clay received their legal schooling. The friendship of\r\nProfessor Small encouraged his natural spirit of toleration and\r\ninvestigation; and at the ‘palace’ of Francis Fauquier, the gay and\r\nbrilliant royal governor--‘a gentleman of the school of Louis XV\r\ntranslated into England by Charles II, and into English by Lord\r\nChesterfield’[374] he formed his literary tastes and learned the virtues\r\nof literary style. Thus assiduous in his studies, reasonably circumspect\r\nin his morals, and profiting immeasurably by contact with superior\r\nminds, he was receiving an intensive preparation for his future labors.\r\nIn the seclusion of his room he communed with Coke and Milton,\r\nHarrington and Locke, and the time was to come when his most notable\r\nliterary production was to disclose, in word and phrase, the influence\r\nof the latter. Locke, not Rousseau, was the well from which he drew;\r\nand there is no sillier assertion in history than that his democracy was\r\nborn of association with the men of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLong before there were levelers in France, Jefferson was a leveler in\r\nVirginia; and because he was a leveler in Virginia, the reactionaries\r\nwho resented his reforms were afterward to charge his democracy to the\r\ninfluence of the levelers of Paris. His democracy was inherent, in part\r\ninherited from a pioneer father. His dislike of the aristocratic system\r\namounted to a prejudice, and he could not bear the novels of Scott\r\nbecause of his detestation of the institutions of medieval times.[375]\r\nHaving written the Declaration of Independence in the house of a\r\nbricklayer, he declined a reëlection to Congress to enter the House of\r\nBurgesses in Virginia to revamp the institutions of the State along\r\ndemocratic lines. When he finished his work there, he had made himself\r\none of the foremost democrats of all times--and the French Revolution\r\nwas still in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia system had been made for caste society; the landed\r\naristocracy were as much a caste as that in England--minus the titles.\r\nThey had the same love of land, the same obsession that the alienation\r\nof any part of their possessions was treason to the family. Through the\r\nsystem of entail, the lands and slaves of the aristocracy could be\r\npassed on down through the generations, proof against the extravagance\r\nand inefficiency of the owners and the attacks of creditors. The law of\r\nprimogeniture was designed to serve the same general end of preventing\r\nthe disruption of the great estates. With a fine audacity, Jefferson\r\nsallied forth quite gayly to attack them both. Even Henry thought this\r\nwas radicalism gone mad. Pendleton was more hurt than outraged. The\r\naristocratic members of his mother’s family looked upon him as a\r\nmatricide. Undaunted by the hate engendered, he put his hand to the\r\nplough and kept it there until he had ploughed the field and prepared it\r\nfor a democratic harvest. His friend Pendleton begged a compromise on\r\nprimogeniture giving the eldest son a double share of the land. ‘Yes,’\r\nreplied the leveler, ‘when he can eat twice the allowance of food and\r\ndo double the allowance of work.’ It was his purpose to eradicate ‘every\r\nfibre of ancient or future aristocracy.’[376] The outraged landed\r\naristocracy never forgave him. He was the first American to invite the\r\nhate of a class, and from the beginning he turned his back on the\r\naristocracy and made his appeal to the middle-class yeomanry.[377] All\r\nthis was behind him when he went to Paris before the Revolution there\r\nbegan. There the tall, slender American in the elegant house on the\r\nGrande Route des Champs Elysées, with its extensive gardens and court,\r\nwas an impressive figure. ‘You replace Doctor Franklin, I hear,’ said\r\nVergennes, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. ‘I succeed him,’ Jefferson\r\nreplied; ‘nobody could replace him.’ There could have been no more\r\ningratiating reply, for his predecessor had been greatly admired and\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nNo one could have found the conversation of the salons and dinner tables\r\nmore congenial. His manners were those of a man of the world, and he\r\nshared the French fondness for speculative talk, and the French knack of\r\nspicing gravity with frivolity. Even his table tastes were similar. He\r\nate sparingly and preferred the light wines. Both his natural\r\nhospitality and his respect for the dignity of his position spread the\r\nreputation of his lavish table; and while he gave no great parties, gay\r\nand frequent dinners were the rule. Lafayette ran in and out constantly;\r\nmembers of the diplomatic set found Jefferson’s house an agreeable\r\nmeeting-place; the young French officers who had served in America liked\r\nhis company, and De la Tude, the wit, who had served thirty-five years\r\nin prison for writing an epigram on Pompadour, enlivened many an evening\r\nwith his reminiscences. American tourists were captivated by his\r\ncivilities, introductions to celebrities, itineraries for profitable\r\ntrips. Like Franklin before him, he charmed the beautiful women of the\r\ncourt with his wit and humor, and the eloquence of his conversation. He\r\nloved the promenades and shops, and was constantly alert for something\r\nunusual to send his friends at home--rare books for Madison, Monroe, and\r\nWythe, a portable table for Madison, an artistic lamp for Lee. And yet\r\nhe was far from an elegant idler, and his days were laboriously passed;\r\nmornings at his office, afternoons given to country walks, evenings to\r\nsociety, art, music. He found time for elaborate and illuminating\r\nreports that are models in diplomatic literature and which exacted\r\ntribute from even John Marshall. Feeling frequently the need of absolute\r\nseclusion for his work, he had rooms in the Carthusian Monastery on\r\nMount Calvary where silence was enjoined outside the rooms, but where he\r\nhad the privileges of the garden.\r\n\r\n‘I am much pleased with the people of this country,’ he wrote a lady.\r\n‘The roughness of the human mind is so thoroughly rubbed off with them,\r\nthat it seems one might glide through a whole life without a\r\njostle.’[378] And in another letter, the same impression: ‘Here it seems\r\na man might pass a life without encountering a single rudeness.’[379]\r\nBut if he loved the society of Paris, he was not, like Morris, seduced\r\ninto an acceptance of its system. His passion for democracy did not\r\npermit him to judge the happiness of a nation by the luxuries of the\r\ncourt and aristocracy. He struck out into the country to judge for\r\nhimself of the condition of the peasants, looked into the pots on the\r\nfire to see what they ate, felt their beds to see if they were\r\ncomfortable. He inquired into the wages and the working conditions of\r\nthe artisans of the cities--and his conclusions were unavoidable, of\r\ncourse. ‘It is a fact,’ he wrote, ‘in spite of the mildness of their\r\ngovernors, the people are ground to powder by their form of government.\r\nOf twenty million people supposed to be in France, I am of opinion there\r\nare nineteen million more wretched, more accursed in every circumstance\r\nof human existence than the most conspicuously wretched individual in\r\nthe whole United States.’[380] And to another: ‘I find the general fate\r\nof humanity here most deplorable. The truth of Voltaire’s observation\r\noffers itself perpetually, that every man here is either the hammer or\r\nthe anvil.’[381] He was shocked by a system that dedicated the sons of\r\npeasants as cannon fodder in remote wars precipitated by the whims of a\r\nprostitute; that winked at the debauchery of their wives and daughters;\r\nthat gave men to the Bastile for the expression of a criticism; that\r\ncrushed the people with intolerable taxation to sustain the luxury of a\r\nfew; that forced the poor to live on food not fit for a stray dog in a\r\ncity slums, and which awed the masses into submission to such conditions\r\nby the bayonets of the soldiery. This was the France of which he\r\nthought in the day when his sympathy with the Revolution was to damn him\r\nwith the Federalists’ taunt of ‘Jacobin’ and ‘anarchist.’\r\n\r\nSuch being his observations and views, he rejoiced in the popular\r\nawakening in the dawning days of the Revolution. Witnessing the meeting\r\nof the Assembly of the Notables, a fascinated spectator of the razing of\r\nthe Bastile, listening, deeply moved, to the audacious eloquence of\r\nMirabeau, he wrote, with the joy of the reformer, to Washington that\r\n‘the French nation has been awakened by our Revolution.’ It was in those\r\ndays that Gouverneur Morris, the friend of Hamilton, was accustomed to\r\ndrop in on Jefferson for a chat on the situation, and their friendly\r\ndisagreements were soon to appear in a party division in America. ‘He\r\nand I differ,’ wrote Morris in his diary, ‘in our system of politics. He\r\nwith all the leaders of liberty here is desirous of annihilating\r\ndistinctions of order.’[382] And yet he was not hostile to the King or\r\nthe monarchy. He hoped for reforms, freely granted. Louis he found\r\n‘irascible, rude, very limited in his understanding,’ with ‘no\r\nmistress,’ but governed too much by the Queen--‘devoted to pleasure and\r\nexpense, and not remarkable for any other vices or virtues.’[383] As the\r\nstorm-clouds lowered and the easy-going monarch remained inert, he\r\nbecame less tolerant. ‘The King, long in the habit of drowning his cares\r\nin wine, plunges deeper and deeper. The Queen cries but sins on. The\r\nCount d’Artois is detested.’[384] And a month later: ‘The King goes for\r\nnothing. He hunts one half the day, is drunk the other, and signs\r\nwhatever he is bid.’[385]\r\n\r\nAs the future Terrorists ascended from the cellars and descended from\r\nthe garrets, and occasional riots gave premonitory signs of the bloody\r\ndays ahead, he reported to Jay that the rioting was the work of the\r\n‘abandoned banditti of Paris,’ and had no ‘professed connection with the\r\ngreat national reformation going on.’[386]\r\n\r\nAll this time he was being constantly consulted by Lafayette and the\r\nmoderate leaders who were to become the members of the attractive but\r\nunfortunate party of the Gironde. They even met at his dinner table to\r\nmake plans, without notifying him of their intent, and his voluntary\r\nexplanation to the Minister was received with the expression of a hope\r\nthat he might be able to assist in an accommodation of differences. He\r\ndid, in fact, propose a plan, which, had it been accepted, might have\r\nsaved the monarchy. It was his suggestion that Louis step forward with a\r\ncharter in his hands, granting liberty of the person, of conscience, of\r\nthe press, a trial by jury, an annual legislature with the power of\r\ntaxation, and with a ministry responsible to the people.[387] These\r\nassociations and these views are conclusive as to the absurdity that he\r\nwas permeated with the theories of Jacobinism and brought them back to\r\nthe United States. He was the same kind of Jacobin as Lafayette. His\r\ninterest was the interest in democracy and popular rights that he had\r\ntaken with him when he sailed for Europe. Mirabeau was still laboring to\r\nsave the monarchy with reforms when Jefferson returned to America on\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nJefferson was a humanitarian ahead of his time. His humanity spoke above\r\nthe passions of the Revolution in his letter to Patrick Henry against\r\nthe mistreatment of the German prisoners. ‘Is an enemy so execrable,’ he\r\nwrote, ‘that though in captivity his wishes and comforts are to be\r\ndisregarded and even crossed? I think not. It is for the benefit of\r\nmankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible.’[388] These\r\ncaptives, interned near Monticello, came to love the master on the hill\r\nfor his efforts to lighten the burdens of their captivity.[389] A little\r\nlater, in the Virginia Legislature, we find him opposing the death\r\npenalty except for treason and murder, and the policy of working\r\nconvicts on the highways and canals. ‘Exhibited as a public spectacle,’\r\nhe wrote, ‘with shaved heads and mean clothing, working on the highroads\r\nproduced in the criminals such a prostration of self-respect, as,\r\ninstead of reforming, plunged them into the most desperate and hardened\r\ndepravity.’[390] It was novel then to hear men speaking of reform\r\ninstead of punishment.\r\n\r\nThat this humanitarian impulse was not confined to people at a distance\r\nis shown in his relations to his own servants, both the employees and\r\nthe slaves. A woman of fashion commented on ‘the most perfect servants\r\nat the White House’ during his eight years there and the significant\r\ncircumstance that ‘none left.’[391] But we must turn to his relations\r\nwith his slaves to find him at his best. One picture will suffice. It is\r\non the occasion of his return to Monticello from his French mission. At\r\nthe foot of the hill all the slaves in their gaudiest attire are\r\nassembled to greet him. The carriage appears down the road. The slaves,\r\nlaughing, shouting, rush forward to welcome him, unhitch the horses to\r\ndraw the carriage up the steep hill, some pulling, some pushing, and\r\nothers huddled in a dark mass close around the vehicle. Some kiss his\r\nhands, others his feet, and it is long after he reaches the house before\r\nhe is permitted to enter. This was long before the day when\r\ncorrespondents with cameras pursued public men and demonstrations were\r\nstaged.[392] Here was a master who loved his slaves.\r\n\r\nNor can there be any possible doubt as to his hostility to slavery. One\r\nof the features of his Virginia reforms was abolition. While he failed,\r\nhe never doubted that ultimately the chains would fall. ‘Nothing is more\r\ncertainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be\r\nfree’ he wrote in his ‘Autobiography.’[393] A little later, referring to\r\nhis strictures on slavery in his ‘Notes on Virginia,’ he expressed a\r\ndesire to get them to the young men in the colleges. ‘It is to them I\r\nlook, to the rising generation, and not to the one now in power, for\r\nthese great reformations.’[394] Declining membership in a society for\r\nabolition in France on the ground that his official status would make\r\nimproper a demonstration against an institution his own people were\r\nretaining, he said that ‘it is decent of me to avoid too public a\r\ndemonstration of my wishes to see it [slavery] abolished.’[395] Without\r\nany of this evidence, his hostility to slavery would be irrefutably\r\nestablished by the Ordinance of the Northwest Territory, in the\r\nhandwriting of Jefferson in the archives of the Nation, prohibiting\r\nslavery in any of the States that might be carved therefrom after the\r\nyear 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSuch is the persistency of falsehood that Jefferson has come down to us\r\nvaguely as an atheist and an enemy of the Christian religion. Since this\r\ncharge is to play a part in the political story we are about to tell, it\r\ncalls for some attention. He was brought up in the Church of England,\r\nand his earliest recollection was of saying the Lord’s Prayer when his\r\ndinner was delayed.[396] He planned at least one church and contributed\r\nto the erection of others, gave freely to Bible Societies, and liberally\r\nto the support of the clergy. He attended church with normal regularity,\r\ntaking his prayer book to the services and joining in the responses and\r\nprayers of the congregation. No human being ever heard him utter a word\r\nof profanity. During the period of his social ostracism by the\r\nintolerant partisans of Philadelphia, he passed many evenings with Dr.\r\nRush in conversation on religion.[397] ‘I am a Christian,’ he once said,\r\n‘in the only sense in which Jesus wished any one to be--sincerely\r\nattached to his doctrines in preference to all others.’ On one occasion\r\nwhen a man of distinction expressed his disbelief in the truths of the\r\nBible, he said, ‘Then, sir, you have studied it to little purpose.’[398]\r\nWhile the New England pulpits were ringing with denunciations of this\r\n‘infidel’ and old ladies, unable to detect the false witness of the\r\npartisan clergy, were solemnly hiding their Bibles to prevent their\r\nconfiscation by the ‘atheist’ in the President’s House, he was spending\r\nhis nights in the codification of the ‘Morals of Jesus,’ and through the\r\nremainder of his life he was to read from this every night before\r\nretiring.[399] In his last days he spent much time reading the Greek\r\ndramatists and the Bible, dwelling in conversation on the superiority of\r\nthe moral system of Christ over all others. In his dying hour, after\r\ntaking leave of his family, he was heard to murmur, ‘Lord, now lettest\r\nThy servant depart in peace.’[400]\r\n\r\nThe reason for the myth created against him is not far to seek. Just as\r\nthe landed aristocracy of Virginia pursued him with increasing venom\r\nbecause of his land reforms, the clergy hated him for forcing the\r\nseparation of Church and State. When he made the fight for this reform,\r\nit was a crime not to baptize a child into the Episcopal Church; a crime\r\nto bring a Quaker into the colony; and, according to the law, a heretic\r\ncould be burned. If the latter law was not observed, that compelling all\r\nto pay tithes regardless of their religious affiliations and opinions\r\nwas rigidly enforced. This outraged Jefferson’s love of liberty. The\r\nPresbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, who were making inroads on the\r\nmembership of the Established Church, were prosecuted, and their\r\nministers were declared disturbers of the peace and thrown into jail\r\nlike common felons. Patrick Henry and his followers fought Jefferson’s\r\nplan for a disestablishment--but he won.[401] The ‘atheist’ law, which\r\nwas never forgiven by the ministers of Virginia and Connecticut, was\r\nsimple and brief:\r\n\r\n     No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious\r\n     worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced,\r\n     restrained, molested or burdened in his mind or goods, nor shall\r\n     otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief;\r\n     but all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain,\r\n     their opinions in matters of religion, and the same shall in no\r\n     wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\r\n\r\nHere we have the secret of the animus of the clergy of the time--but\r\nthere were other reasons. In his ‘Notes on Virginia’ he did not please\r\nthe orthodox, and Dr. Mason, a fashionable political minister of New\r\nYork City, exposed him in the pulpit, holding him up to scorn as a\r\n‘profane philosopher’ and an ‘infidel.’ Discussing the theory that the\r\nmarine shells found on the high mountains were proof of the universal\r\ndeluge, Jefferson had rejected it. ‘Aha,’ cried Mason, ‘he derides the\r\nMosaic account’; he ‘sneers at the Scriptures’ and with ‘malignant\r\nsarcasm.’ When Jefferson, referring to the tillers of the soil, wrote\r\nthat they were ‘the chosen people of God if ever He had a chosen\r\npeople,’ and referred to Christ as ‘good if ever man was,’ the minister\r\ncharged him with ‘profane babbling.’[402]\r\n\r\nHis view of creation is set forth in a letter discussing a work by\r\nWhitehurst. He believed that a Supreme Being created the earth and its\r\ninhabitants; that if He created both, He could have created both at\r\nonce, or created the earth and waited ages for it to get form itself\r\nbefore He created man; but he believed that it was created in a state of\r\nfluidity and not in its present solid form. This was his infidelity. He\r\nprobably did not believe that Jonah was swallowed by the whale--and that\r\nwas enough to damn him. But if he was not a Christian, the pulpits are\r\nteeming with atheists to-day.[403]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Hamilton had no faith in the Constitution, but did\r\nyeoman service for its ratification; we have the charge that Jefferson\r\nwas hostile to both; and the truth is that he was hostile to neither and\r\nfavorable to both. The evidence is overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWhen the new form of government was under consideration, he proposed ‘to\r\nmake the States one in everything connected with foreign nations, and\r\nseveral as to everything purely domestic,’ and to separate the\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches.[404] He was bitterly\r\nhostile to any plan based on the monarchical idea, and advised its\r\nfriends ‘to read the fable of the frogs who solicited Jupiter for a\r\nKing.’[405] When the Convention met, he wrote Adams that it was ‘really\r\nan assembly of demigods,’ but regretted that they began their\r\ndeliberations ‘by so abominable a precedent as that of tying up the\r\ntongues of the members.’[406] His first impressions of the completed\r\ndocument were unfavorable. In a letter to Adams he complained of the\r\nreëligibility of the President.[407] To another correspondent he\r\ncomplained that the proposed system would merge the States into one\r\nwithout protecting the people with a bill of rights.[408]\r\n\r\nWriting to Madison, he went more into detail, balancing the good against\r\nthe bad. He liked the separation of the departments, endorsed the\r\nlodging of the power of initiating money bills with the representatives\r\nof the people, and was ‘captivated with the compromise of the opposite\r\nclaims of the great and little States’; but he insisted that a bill of\r\nrights ‘is what the people are entitled to against every government on\r\nearth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse\r\nor rest in inference.’ Professing himself ‘no friend to a very energetic\r\ngovernment’ as ‘always oppressive,’ he added that should the people\r\napprove the Constitution in all its parts he should ‘concur in it\r\ncheerfully in hopes that they will amend it whenever they think it works\r\nwrong.’[409]\r\n\r\nLittle more than a month later he had become an ardent friend of\r\nratification. ‘I wish with all my soul,’ he wrote, ‘that the nine first\r\nConventions may accept the Constitution, because this may secure to us\r\nthe good it contains, which I think great and important. But I equally\r\nwish that the four latest Conventions, whichever they may be, may refuse\r\nto accede to it till a declaration of rights is annexed.’[410]\r\n\r\nWhen the Massachusetts Convention accepted with ‘perpetual instructions\r\nto her Delegates to endeavor to secure reforms,’ he was delighted,[411]\r\nand the same day he wrote another correspondent of his pleasure at the\r\nprogress made toward ratification. ‘Indeed I have presumed that it would\r\ngain on the public mind as I confess it has on my own.’[412] When South\r\nCarolina acted, he wrote E. Rutledge his congratulations. ‘Our\r\ngovernment wanted bracing,’ he said. ‘Still we must take care not to run\r\nfrom one extreme to another; not to brace too high.’[413] When the\r\nrequisite nine States had ratified, he wrote Madison in a spirit of\r\nrejoicing. ‘It is a good canvas on which some strokes only want\r\nretouching. What these are I think are sufficiently manifested by the\r\ngeneral voice from North to South which calls for a bill of\r\nrights.’[414]\r\n\r\nAfter the ratification, he wrote Madison in praise of ‘The Federalist,’\r\ndescribing it as ‘the best commentary on government ever written,’ and\r\nadmitting that it had ‘rectified’ him on many points.[415] In the same\r\nvein he wrote to Washington, expressing the hope that a bill of rights\r\nwould be speedily added.[416] In the spring of 1789 he wrote another\r\nthat the Constitution was ‘unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented\r\nto men.’[417] And after the Bill of Rights had been added, he wrote to\r\nLafayette that ‘the opposition to the Constitution has almost totally\r\ndisappeared’ and that ‘the amendments proposed by Congress have brought\r\nover almost all’ of the objectors.[418]\r\n\r\nYears afterward, when he wrote his ‘Autobiography,’ he reviewed his\r\nreactions on the document: ‘I received a copy early in November,’ he\r\nwrote, ‘and read and contemplated its provisions, with great\r\nsatisfaction.... The absence of express declarations, ensuring freedom\r\nof religious worship, freedom of the press, freedom of the person under\r\nthe uninterrupted protection of the Habeas Corpus & trial by jury in\r\ncivil as well as in criminal cases excited my jealousy; and the\r\nreëligibility of the President for life I quite disapproved. I expressed\r\nfreely in letters to my friends, and most particularly to Mr. Madison\r\nand General Washington, my approbations and objections.’[419] His\r\nrecollections were true to the facts as conclusively shown in the\r\ncorrespondence to which reference has been made.\r\n\r\nHe was no more opposed to the Constitution and its ratification than he\r\nwas an atheist.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThis brings us to Jefferson the creator and leader of a party, and his\r\nmethods of management. Here he was without a peer in the mastery of men.\r\nHe intuitively knew men, and when bent upon it could usually bend them\r\nto his will. He was a psychologist and could easily probe the minds and\r\nhearts of those he met. In his understanding of mass psychology, he had\r\nno equal. When a measure was passed or a policy adopted in Philadelphia,\r\nhe knew the reactions in the woods of Georgia without waiting for\r\nletters and papers. This rare insight into the mass mind made him a\r\nbrilliantly successful propagandist. In every community he had his\r\ncorrespondents with whom he communicated with reasonable regularity,\r\ndoing more in this way to mould and direct the policies of his party\r\nthan could have been done in any other way. Seldom has there lived a\r\nmore tireless and voluminous letter-writer. With all the powerful\r\nelements arrayed against him, he appreciated the importance of the press\r\nas did few others. ‘I desired you in my last to send me the newspapers,\r\nnotwithstanding the expense,’ he wrote a friend from Paris.[420]\r\nBelieving that the people, in possession of the facts, would reach\r\nreasonable conclusions, he considered newspapers a necessary engine of\r\ndemocracy. ‘If left to me,’ he once wrote, ‘to decide whether we should\r\nhave a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a\r\ngovernment, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the\r\nlatter.’[421] There is not a scintilla of evidence to confute his stout\r\ncontention that he never wrote for the papers anonymously, but the\r\nevidence piles mountain high to prove that he constantly inspired the\r\ntone of the party press.\r\n\r\nIn his personal contacts he was captivating--a master of diplomacy and\r\ntact, born of his intuitive knowledge of men. Perhaps no better\r\nillustration of his cleverness in analyzing men can be found than in his\r\nletter to Madison on De Moustier, a newly appointed French Minister to\r\nthe United States. ‘De M. is remarkably communicative. With adroitness\r\nhe may be pumped of anything. His openness is from character, not\r\naffectation. An intimacy with him may, on this account, be politically\r\nvaluable.’[422]\r\n\r\nIn his leadership we find more of leading than of driving. He had a\r\ngenius for gently and imperceptibly insinuating his own views into the\r\nminds of others and leaving them with the impression that they had\r\nconceived the ideas and convinced Jefferson. To Madison this was a\r\nsource of keen delight.[423] Jefferson was the original ‘Easy Boss.’ His\r\ntact was proverbial. He never sought to overshadow or overawe. Inferior\r\nmen were not embarrassed or depressed in his presence. He was amazingly\r\nthoughtful and considerate. In a company he instinctively went to the\r\nassistance of the neglected. Thus at a dinner party, a guest, long\r\nabsent from the country, and unknown to the diners, was left out of the\r\nconversation and ignored. In a momentary silence, Jefferson turned to\r\nhim. ‘To you, Mr. C., we are indebted for this benefit--’ he said, ‘no\r\none deserves more the gratitude of his country.’ The other guests were\r\nall attention. ‘Yes, sir, the upland rice which you sent from Algiers,\r\nand which thus far succeeds, will, when generally adopted by the\r\nplanters, prove an inestimable blessing to our Southern States.’ After\r\nthat the neglected guest became the lion of the dinner.[424]\r\nThoughtfulness in small things--this entered not a little into\r\nJefferson’s hold on his followers.\r\n\r\nIt was at the dinner table that he planned many of his battles. He did\r\nnot care for the stormy and contentious atmosphere of a caucus. He was\r\nnot an orator. In the Continental Congress he was disgusted by the ‘rage\r\nfor debate.’[425] Later he was to find his lot in the Cabinet\r\nintolerable because he and Hamilton were constantly pitted against each\r\nother ‘like cocks in a pit.’ He was not afraid of a fight, but the\r\nfutility of angry controversy repelled him. It was this which made him a\r\ndelightful dinner host--all controversial subjects that might offend\r\nwere taboo. If his position were warmly controverted, he changed the\r\nsubject tactfully. It was never the opposition that interested him, but\r\nthe reason for it; and with rare subtlety he would seek to obliterate\r\nthe prejudice, if it were prejudice, or to remove the misunderstanding\r\nif it were ignorance of facts. Thus he won many victories through a\r\nseeming retreat.[426]\r\n\r\nUnescapable quarrels and separations were minor tragedies to him. He\r\nlong sought to get along with Hamilton. He advised his daughters to be\r\ntolerant of disagreeable people and acted on his own advice. Fiske has\r\nexplained him in a sentence: ‘He was in no wise lacking in moral\r\ncourage, but his sympathies were so broad and tender that he could not\r\nbreathe freely in an atmosphere of strife.’[427] Thus considerate of his\r\nfoes, he never hurt the sensibilities of his friends through offensive\r\nmethods. He liked to gather his lieutenants about him at the table and\r\n‘talk it out’--each man free to give his views. Here he ironed out\r\ndifferences, dominating by the superiority of his intellect and\r\nfascinating personality while appearing singularly free from domination.\r\n\r\nIn his power of self-control Jefferson had another advantage over his\r\nleading political opponents. There was something uncanny in his capacity\r\nto simulate ignorance of the hate that often encompassed him. To the\r\nmost virulent of his foes he was the pink of courtesy. He mastered\r\nothers by mastering himself. And because he was master of himself, he\r\nhad another advantage--he kept his judgment clear as to the capacity and\r\ncharacter of his opponents. One may search in vain through the letters\r\nof Hamilton for expressions other than those of contemptuous\r\nbelittlement of his political foes. Jefferson never made that mistake.\r\nHe conceded Hamilton’s ability and admired it. Visitors at Monticello,\r\nmanifesting surprise at finding busts by Ceracchi of Hamilton and\r\nJefferson, facing each other across the hall, elicited the smiling\r\ncomment--‘opposite in death as in life.’ There never would have been a\r\nbust of Jefferson at ‘The Grange.’ Through the long years of\r\nestrangement with Adams, Jefferson kept the way clear for the\r\nrestoration of their old relations. Writing Madison of Adams’s faults,\r\nhe emphasized his virtues and lovable qualities. When the bitter battles\r\nof their administrations were in the past and a mutual friend wrote that\r\nthe old man at Quincy had said, ‘I always loved Jefferson and always\r\nshall,’ he said, ‘That is enough for me,’ and set to work to revive the\r\nold friendship. Thus the time came when in reply to Jefferson’s\r\ncongratulations on the election of John Quincy Adams in 1824, Adams\r\nwrote: ‘I call him our John because when you were at the Cul de Sac at\r\nParis, he appeared to me to be almost as much your boy as mine.’[428]\r\nThis capacity for keeping his judgment clear of the benumbing fumes of\r\nprejudice concerning the qualities of his enemies was one of the strong\r\npoints of his leadership.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that in practical politics Jefferson was a ‘Miss\r\nNancy’ or a ‘Sister Sue.’ This first consummate practical politician of\r\nthe Republic did not consider it practical to underestimate the foe, nor\r\nto dissipate his energy and cloud his judgment by mere prejudices and\r\nhates. He was not an idealist in his methods, and this has given his\r\nenemies a peg on which to hang the charge that he was dishonest. He was\r\nan opportunist, to be sure; he never refused the half loaf he could get\r\nbecause of the whole loaf he could not have. He trimmed his sails at\r\ntimes to save his craft--and this was wisdom. He compromised at the call\r\nof necessity. He was hard-headed and looked clear-eyed at the realities\r\nabout him. He was cunning, for without cunning he could not have\r\novercome a foe so powerfully entrenched. He was as elusive as a shadow,\r\nand this has been called cowardice--but it was difficult to trap him in\r\nconsequence. His antipathy to the frontal attack has often been referred\r\nto with contempt, but, leading a large but unorganized army against one\r\nof tremendous power, he preferred the methods of Washington in the\r\nfield--which was to avoid the frontal attack with his ragged\r\nContinentals against the trained and disciplined army. Because of these\r\nconditions he was given to mining. When apparently quiescent, he was\r\nprobably sowing discord among his foes--his part concealed. This was\r\nhateful to the Federalists--just as the tactics of Frederick were\r\nhateful to the exasperated superior forces against him.\r\n\r\nJefferson was the most resourceful politician of his time. For every\r\nproblem he had a solution. He teemed with ideas. These were his shock\r\ntroops. If he seemed motionless, it was because by a nod or look he had\r\nput his forces on the march. Like the wiser of the modern bosses, he\r\nknew the virtue of silence. When in doubt, he said nothing. When certain\r\nof his course, he said nothing--to his foes. It was impossible to smoke\r\nhim out when he preferred to stay in. In the midst of abuse he was\r\nserene. And he was a stickler for party regularity.[429] He appreciated\r\nthe possibilities of organization and discipline. When money was needed\r\nfor party purposes, his friends would receive a note: ‘I have put you\r\ndown for so much.’ When the party paper languished, he circulated\r\nsubscription lists among his neighbors, and instructed his friends to\r\nimitate his example. He was never too big for the small essential\r\nthings, and he was a master of detail--very rarely true of men of large\r\nviews. His energy was dynamic and he was tireless. He never rested on\r\nhis arms or went into winter quarters. His fight was endless. The real\r\nsecret of his triumph, however, is found in the reason given by one of\r\nhis biographers: ‘He enjoyed a political vision penetrating deeper down\r\ninto the inevitable movement of popular government, and farther forward\r\ninto the future of free institutions than was possessed by any other man\r\nin public life in his day.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nNo American of his time had such versatility or such diversified\r\ninterests. He was asked to frame the Declaration of Independence because\r\nof his reputation as a writer. Adams has told the story: ‘He brought\r\nwith him a reputation for literary science and a happy talent for\r\ncomposition. Writings of his were handed about[430] remarkable for their\r\npeculiar felicity of expression.’ It was the ‘Summary View’ which\r\nelicited the admiration of Edmund Burke. A more ambitious effort, his\r\n‘Notes on Virginia’ were written during the fatal illness of his wife,\r\nand while he was confined to the house two or three weeks by a riding\r\naccident.[431] It was a valuable contribution to the natural, social,\r\neconomic, and political history of the State, with a number of eloquent\r\npassages and fascinating pages.\r\n\r\nHe had an artistic temperament, loved music, and at the beginning of his\r\ncareer we find him busy planning his garden at Monticello, and\r\npracticing three hours a day on his loved violin, under the instructions\r\nof an Italian musician. His hospitality to the Hessian prisoners is\r\npartly explained by a mutual love of music. Returning from an absence to\r\nfind ‘Shadwell,’ his early home, in ashes, he inquired anxiously about\r\nhis books. ‘Oh, my young master,’ exclaimed the distressed slave, ‘they\r\nwere all burnt, but we saved your fiddle.’[432]\r\n\r\nLoving art in all its forms, he was fond of the company of artists. It\r\nwas he who arranged in Paris for Houdon to go to America to make the\r\nstatue of Washington.[433] He entertained Trumbull in the French\r\ncapital, accompanying him to Versailles to see the King’s art\r\ncollection, and urged him to remain in Paris and study.[434] He was\r\ndelighted with architectural beauty and lingered about the masterpieces.\r\nFrom Nesmes, he wrote enthusiastically to a woman friend: ‘Here I am,\r\nMadame, gazing whole hours at the Maison Quarree, like a lover at his\r\nmistress. This is the second time I have been in love since I left\r\nParis. The first was with a Diana at the Chateau de Laye-Epinaye in\r\nBeaujolais, a delicious morsel of sculpture, by M. A. Soldtz. This you\r\nwill say was in rule, to fall in love with a female beauty; but with a\r\nhouse. No, Madame, it is not without a precedent in my own history.\r\nWhile in Paris I was violently smitten with the Hotel de Salm.’[435]\r\nWhen the Capitol at Richmond was in contemplation, he urged the\r\nconstruction of the most beautiful edifice possible as a model to be\r\nemulated in other buildings; drew some plans himself; examined those of\r\nHallet, was captivated with those of Thornton, and urged their\r\nacceptance. ‘Simple, noble, beautiful,’ he wrote home.[436]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, so many-sided was this man, that he was a utilitarian and\r\nscientist as well as artist. In Europe he was thought a philosopher, and\r\nHumboldt came to America to pass many hours under his roof. A perusal of\r\nhis letters discloses the intensity and range of his interests. He was\r\nentranced with clocks, and we find him writing David Rittenhouse\r\nreminding him of ‘a kind promise of making me an accurate clock,’[437]\r\nand later to Madison of a watch he had made for himself and inquiring if\r\nhis friend wished one.[438] He summoned a Swiss clock-maker to\r\nMonticello who died on the mountain and is buried in the enclosure with\r\nhis patron. He put the noted Buffon to rout in Paris on points in\r\nnatural history.[439] Admiring the red men, he spent years collecting\r\ntheir vocabularies.[440] When in Paris he heard that an Arabic\r\ntranslation of Livy had been found in Sicily, and importuned the\r\n_chargés des affaires_ of Naples to make inquiries, and was much excited\r\nto hear that such a translation had been found ‘and will restore to us\r\nseventeen of the lost books.’[441] In the midst of the political\r\ndiversions and social distractions of Paris he found time to write at\r\nlength on the ‘latest discoveries in astrology.’[442] As early as the\r\nsummer of 1785, when Pilatre de Rozière made his fatal attempt to cross\r\nthe English Channel in a balloon, we find him eagerly discussing the\r\npossibilities of the aeronautical science.[443] A newly invented lamp\r\npleased him and he sent one to a friend from Paris.[444] The use of\r\nsteam in the operation of grist mills interested him and he found time\r\nto witness the test.[445] Even the absorbing drama of the French\r\nRevolution in its early stages did not lessen his interest in Paine’s\r\niron bridge, and he attended its exhibition,[446] and finding the\r\ninventor hesitating between ‘the catenary and portions of a circle,’ he\r\nsent to Italy for a scientific work by the Abbe Mascheroni.[447]\r\nFascinated by inventions, he was, himself, the inventor of a plough.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nInterested as he was in art and inventions, his heart was with the\r\ncountry life and the farmer’s lot. He was never happier than when, in\r\nthe early morning, mounted on one of his beloved horses, he rode over\r\nhis broad acres at Monticello, observing with a perennial zest the\r\nbudding of the trees in spring, the unfolding of the flowers, the\r\nripening of the harvest. Wherever he was, throughout his life, he longed\r\nfor the house he had made on the hill, the broad fields, the family\r\ncircle and the servitors and slaves. There he was lord of the domain. If\r\nhe employed Italian gardeners, they conformed to his ideas. If he had a\r\nsupervisor, it was he himself who determined what should be planted and\r\nwhere--where the orchards should be, what trees should be set and their\r\nlocation; and even the vines and shrubs, the nuts and seeds, the roots\r\nand bulbs claimed his personal attention. Even his hogs were named, and\r\nwhen one was to be killed, he designated it by name.[448] There, too, he\r\nlived in an atmosphere of affection. There he had taken his bride, a\r\nwoman of exquisite beauty, grace, and loveliness; there his children had\r\nbeen born, and there, all too soon, their mother died. He was\r\npassionately devoted to her and there was no successor. To the daughters\r\nwho were left he became both a father and a mother, resulting in an\r\nintimacy seldom found between father and daughters. In Paris he would\r\nnot permit even his trusted servant to do their shopping, reserving that\r\nduty for himself. Always patient, never harsh, and ever sympathetic, he\r\nwas the ideal parent.[449]\r\n\r\nThough he did not remarry, he was fond of the society of women and they\r\nof his. The few letters to women that have been preserved are\r\nmasterpieces of their kind, sprightly, playful, sometimes beautiful. His\r\nrelations with the women of the Adams family are shown in a note to John\r\nAdams’s married daughter, written from Paris: ‘Mr. Jefferson has the\r\nhonor to present his compliments to Mrs. Smith and to send her the two\r\npair of corsets she desired. He wishes they may be suitable, as Mrs.\r\nSmith omitted to send her measure. Times are altered since Mademoiselle\r\nde Samson had the honor of knowing her; should they be too small,\r\nhowever, she will be so good as to lay them by a while. There are ebbs\r\nas well as flows in this world. When the Mountain refused to go to\r\nMahomet, he went to the Mountain.’[450] In Paris he formed a few\r\ncherished friendships with women, notably with Mrs. Cosway, Italian wife\r\nof an English painter, a woman of charm, beauty, and intellect, with\r\nwhom he corresponded. One of his letters, the dialogue between the Head\r\nand the Heart on her departure for England, is unique and\r\nsparkling.[451] He appreciated the exquisite Mrs. Bingham whom he met in\r\nParis, and his chiding letters to her after her return to America must\r\nhave pleased that artificial lady immensely.[452] He was a friend of the\r\nComtesse De Tesse whose mind he admired,[453] and of Madame De Corney\r\nwhose beauty attracted him. ‘The Bois de Boulogne invited you earnestly\r\nto retire to its umbrage from the heats of the sad season,’ he wrote her\r\ngallantly. ‘I was through it to-day as I am every day. Every tree\r\ncharged me with this invitation.’[454]\r\n\r\nSuch was Thomas Jefferson who took upon himself the organization of the\r\nforces of democracy, when its enemies were in the saddle, booted and\r\nspurred, and with a well-disciplined and powerful army at their back.\r\nNone but an extraordinary character could have dared hope for victory,\r\nand he was that, and more. Democrat and aristocrat, and sometimes\r\nautocrat; philosopher and politician; sentimentalist and utilitarian;\r\nartist, naturalist, and scientist; thinker, dreamer, and doer; inventor\r\nand scholar; writer and statesman, he enthralled his followers and\r\nfascinated while infuriating his foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n‘If New York wanted any revenge for the removal,’ wrote Mrs. Adams to\r\nher daughter soon after reaching Philadelphia, ‘the citizens might be\r\nglutted if they could come here, where every article has been almost\r\ndoubled in price, and where it is not possible for Congress and the\r\nappendages to be half as well accommodated for a long time.’[455]\r\nReconciliation for the removal was not complete several months later\r\nwhen Oliver Wolcott wrote his father complaining that ‘the manners of\r\nthe people are more reserved than in New York.’[456] Even so he had\r\n‘seen nothing to tempt [him] to idolatry,’ after having seen ‘many of\r\ntheir principal men,’ and he had no apprehensions of ‘self-humiliating\r\nsensations’ after a closer acquaintance.[457] It was not with\r\nunrestrained enthusiasm that the officials took up their residence in\r\nthe greater city, with its population of more than 60,000. ‘The\r\nPhiladelphians,’ according to the indignant comment of Jeremiah Smith,\r\n‘are from the highest to the lowest, from the parson in his black gown\r\nto the fille de joie or girl of pleasure, a set of beggars. You cannot\r\nturn around without paying a dollar.’[458]\r\n\r\nTo the visitor entering by coach on Front Street and rumbling up to the\r\nCity Tavern the prospect did not seem so black as to those who received\r\ntheir first impressions from the water-front. These beheld ‘nothing ...\r\nbut confused heaps of wooden store houses, crowded upon each\r\nother’--and, behind the wharves, Water Street, narrow, shut in by the\r\nold bank of the river, dirty, filthy, stinking.[459] Could he have\r\nlooked down upon the city from some convenient hill, he would have found\r\nsomething to revive his drooping spirits in the compactness of the town\r\nand the substantial character of the houses. The principal streets of\r\nthe period were Front, Second, Third, and Fourth, and beyond Sixth\r\nthere were scarcely any habitations. No one thought of building on Arch\r\nor Chestnut Streets west of Tenth, where the land was thickly dotted\r\nwith frogponds.[460] Practically all of business and fashion was to be\r\nfound east of Fourth Street, and the visitor or official sojourner could\r\ncongratulate himself on the ease with which he could get about from\r\nplace to place. An English tourist, observing that with the exception of\r\nBroad and High Streets the thoroughfares were not more than fifty feet\r\nin width, found them suggestive of ‘many of the smaller streets of\r\nLondon except that the foot pavement on either side is of brick instead\r\nof stone.’[461]\r\n\r\nIf the filth of the odorous water-front, the narrowness of the streets,\r\nand the frogponds on the outskirts, so audible in the night, were\r\ndepressing, the houses, attractive, and in many instances\r\narchitecturally pretentious, hinted of comfort and solidity if not of\r\nopulence. The fact that almost all were constructed of brick was not\r\nlost upon the travelers.[462] In the more congested districts these\r\nhouses had a shop on the first floor.\r\n\r\nThe streets, with their red-brick foot pavements and rows of trees,\r\nmaking them fragrant after summer rains, and drearily murmurous in the\r\nwinter winds, were paved with pebbles in the middle,[463] with a gutter\r\nmade of brick or wood, and lined with strong posts to protect the area\r\nof the pedestrians.[464] The trees, mostly buttonwood, willow, and\r\nLombardy poplars, had been brought over from Europe some years before by\r\nWilliam Hamilton.[465] At frequent intervals town pumps offered\r\nrefreshment to the thirsty, or, in the night, an accommodating\r\nhanging-post for the inebriate staggering home from one of the popular\r\ntaverns.[466] Not without its charm was a walk through the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia in the days when Hamilton and Jefferson were exchanging\r\nshots, with the poplars and willows to shut off the sun, the pumps to\r\nminister to the comfort, and with most of the houses offering to the\r\nview a garden filled with old-fashioned flowers--lilacs, roses, pinks,\r\nand tulips, morning-glories and snowballs with gourd vines climbing over\r\nthe porches. In the case of the more imposing mansions there were more\r\nelaborate gardens with rare flowers and shrubbery, but in many of these\r\nwealth claimed its privilege and shut off the view from the common folk\r\nwho could only catch the fragrance.[467]\r\n\r\nThe visitor on public business bent found all the governmental centers\r\nclose together. If interested in the debates at Congress Hall, erected\r\nfor the purpose at Sixth and Chestnut Streets next to the State House,\r\nthe smallest child could direct him. If a person of no special\r\nimportance, he could find his way into the commodious gallery of the\r\nHouse, and, looking down upon the chamber, a hundred by sixty feet, with\r\nits three semi-circular rows of seats facing the Speaker’s rostrum--‘a\r\nkind of pulpit near the center’[468]--could find Ames busy at his\r\ncircular writing-desk, Madison on his feet or Sedgwick in conference\r\nwith a lobbyist. If fortunate he might be admitted to the space on the\r\nfloor beneath the gallery. But it was not so easy to penetrate to the\r\nmore sacred precincts of the Senate on the floor above where the\r\nself-constituted guardians of the covenant and the rights of property\r\nheld themselves aloof from the gaze of the vulgar. Perhaps, if he really\r\nprized the privilege, he might look down from some point of vantage on\r\nthe State House Garden where the statesmen were wont to take the air and\r\ncompose their thoughts.\r\n\r\nDid he have business with Jefferson? It was only a little way to the\r\nthree-story brick residence at High and Eighth Streets which had been\r\ntaken over for the purposes of the State Department. With Hamilton? It\r\nwas but a few steps to the old Pemberton mansion near Chestnut and\r\nThird, with its well-cultivated garden in the rear where the\r\nindefatigable human dynamo worked far into the night.[469] With the\r\nPresident? It was but a short distance from Jefferson’s office to the\r\nMorris house.\r\n\r\nAt the time Washington moved in, the Morris house was one of the most\r\ndistinguished in the city, a dignified and impressive brick mansion,\r\nwith two large lamps in front, and with ample gardens to proclaim it the\r\nabode of a personage of consequence. It was under its roof that\r\nWashington had lived as the guest of Morris while presiding over the\r\nConstitutional Convention. It was not without difficulties and\r\nannoyances that the house was taken over. The banker was lustily praised\r\nby his friends for his sacrifice in abandoning his home, but it appears\r\nto have been a sacrifice similar to that of managing the finances of the\r\nRevolution. One writer questioned whether ‘giving up a house of moderate\r\ndimensions for 700 pounds a year can be deemed a great sacrifice ...\r\nwhen ... the President was accommodated in this city [New York] with a\r\nmuch more elegant house at 400 pounds per annum.’[470] Even Washington,\r\nwho was Morris’s intimate friend, was distressed at the difficulty in\r\npersuading him to fix the rental, and wrote Lear that he could not\r\nunderstand the Senator. He would be willing to pay as much as he paid in\r\nNew York, and even more if there was not clear extortion. The owner\r\nfinally fixed the rental at three thousand dollars a year.[471] Thus\r\nWashington moved in, and there the Presidents lived until the capital\r\nwas moved to Washington.\r\n\r\nThere, if properly presented, the visitor might call to receive the\r\nrather cold, stately bow of Washington or even drink a cup of tea with\r\nMrs. Washington. In the case of a levee, he was sure to be welcome. But\r\nif his social status did not suffice to justify the crossing of the\r\nthreshold, he might, if he were patient, see the great man as he drove\r\nforth in his ornately decorated coach; or, better still, see him emerge\r\non foot with his secretaries, Lear and Jackson, one on either side, with\r\ncocked hats on their heads, the aides a little in the rear. If he had\r\nthe temerity to follow at a respectable distance, he would have been\r\nsurprised, perhaps, to find that the President did not converse with his\r\nsecretaries while on his walks.[472]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt was not joy unconfined to be interned in any of the hotels or taverns\r\nof Philadelphia at any time while it was the capital. In the journals of\r\ntourists who sojourned there we encounter no enthusiastic encomiums,\r\neven for O’Eller’s, which owes something of its glamour in perspective\r\nto the fact that the Assembly dances were held in its ballroom. It was\r\ninfinitely better, at any rate, than the Sign of the Sorrel Horse on\r\nSecond Street, which comes down to us as a ‘bad one.’[473] The City\r\nTavern, scene of numerous political demonstrations, concededly one of\r\nthe best, would have been better rid of vermin that infested the\r\nbeds.[474] The London Tavern, which had its days as the ‘principal\r\nhotel,’ was ‘deficient in comfort’ even at its best,[475] and the Indian\r\nQueen distinguished itself as the scene of a doleful robbery when some\r\nof Ames’s colleagues lost their linen, and thirty thousand dollars in\r\nsecurities, and he escaped only because his name on his trunk assured\r\nthe ‘partial rogues’ that ‘nothing was to be got by taking it\r\naway.’[476] In 1794, the Golden Lion or the Yellow Cat at Eighth and\r\nFilbert Streets was a favorite because of its well-drawn beer and\r\nporter; and the visitor, pushing through the smoke-laden air to drink\r\nmalt liquor from a pewter mug, would, likely as not, find Governor\r\nMifflin or General Knox of the Cabinet enjoying their mugs along with\r\nthe mechanics and clerks.[477] But it was not necessary to sleep in the\r\nbeds of the Yellow Cat to quaff its liquors, and after a brief\r\nexperience with the taverns the tourist would be likely to follow the\r\nexample of Thomas Twining and seek more comfortable and sanitary\r\nquarters in some of the numerous rooming-houses that catered\r\nparticularly to members of Congress. The choicest of these resented the\r\nidea that they were other than the private houses of gentlemen\r\naccommodating political personages--this particularly true in the case\r\nof Francis, the Frenchman, at whose house on Fourth Street,\r\nVice-President Adams had a room.[478] In these private rooming and\r\nboarding-houses, in which the majority of the celebrities lived, an\r\nabundant table, clean agreeable rooms, and the congenial companionship\r\nof colleagues made an appeal. At Francis’s the head of the table was\r\nreserved for Adams, and all the ceremonial forms were scrupulously\r\nobserved, although he frequently had his meals served in his rooms. It\r\nwas not until he had escaped from the Indian Queen and found lodgings\r\n‘at the house of Mrs. Sage’ that Ames began ‘to feel settled and at\r\nhome.’[479] This hiving had its comedies, sometimes its scandals, and\r\noccasionally its romances, as on the day Senator Aaron Burr took James\r\nMadison to call upon the winsome daughter of his landlady, and history\r\nwas made in the candlelit parlor of the boarding-house.\r\n\r\nQuiet and home-like, at least, these boarding-houses of our early\r\nstatesmen, and if they had no bars, they were in close proximity to\r\nmany that were of good repute. The members of the Legislature sometimes\r\nwere known to discuss important measures at Geisse’s Tavern over the\r\nmugs,[480] were wont, on adjournment, to linger at Mr. O’Eller’s for his\r\nincomparable punch,[481] and to celebrate the ending of a session with\r\nan evening of conviviality at ‘Mr. Burns tavern on Tenth Street.’[482]\r\nGentlemen riding along the banks of the Schuylkill could seldom resist\r\nthe impulse to dismount at the tavern of Metz--for these drinking-houses\r\nwere kindly placed among a people intolerant of puritanism.[483]\r\n\r\nGoing forth into the streets to mingle with the common people was a\r\nrevelation to the polished tourist from the old lands. Here they found\r\nnothing of the humility of the lowly to which they were accustomed. The\r\nmechanics and common laborers took the theory of equality seriously. One\r\ntraveler found ‘the lower sort of people’ lacking in good manners[484]\r\nand observed that a well-dressed stranger, asking a polite question, was\r\nalmost certain of an impudent answer.[485] These were the men who were\r\nto man the societies fashioned after those of the Parisian radicals, to\r\nrally passionately to the support of the French Revolution, and to\r\nsupply Jefferson with his shock troops--and sometimes shocking\r\ntroops--in his fight for the democratization of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThese, too, in their desperate striving for equality were moved to\r\nimitations of the spendthrift practices of the rich. Even the servants\r\nand the negroes gave elaborate balls which Liancourt found ‘destitute of\r\nthe charming simplicity of the fêtes of our peasants.’[486] The women\r\nappeared in dresses beyond their means; the laborer and his lady rode in\r\ncoaches to the dance, where an elaborate supper was served, with liquid\r\nrefreshments. Sundays found the public-houses of the environs packed\r\nwith the men of the factories and shop, borne thither, with their\r\nfamilies, in chairs. There was much drinking and spending with gambling\r\non the fights arranged for their delectation.[487] At Harrowgate\r\nGardens, two miles out on the New York road, and Gray’s Gardens on the\r\nSchuylkill, they flocked to drink tea or liquor, to dance, promenade, or\r\nflirt, and on summer nights the young men of all stations were lured to\r\nthem by the promise of romance. Even the grave and reverend statesmen\r\ncould not, in all cases, resist the call. Gay and wicked some must have\r\nthought the scene--with the painted women of the town a bit brazen in\r\ntheir fishing for men. ‘We have Eves in plenty, of all nations, tongues\r\nand colors,’ wrote Oliver Wolcott to his wife from Gray’s Gardens where\r\nhe had taken refuge from the yellow fever, ‘but do not be jealous--I\r\nhave not seen one yet whom I have thought pretty’--leaving her to\r\nimagine the possibilities should one such appear.[488] And yet,\r\npleasure-loving as the population was, the nights were reasonably quiet.\r\nAbout the time the city assumed the dignity of a capital, there was\r\nlittle to disturb the tranquillity of the night after ten o’clock beyond\r\nthe voice of the watchman, or the footsteps of some night-hawk wending\r\nhis way by the light of the street-lamps ‘placed like those in\r\nLondon.’[489] But five years later, a visitor who recalled that in 1794\r\nit was unusual to meet any one at night, or to hear any noises after\r\neleven o’clock, found that the nocturnal annoyances continued far later\r\ninto the night.[490]\r\n\r\nIt was by day, however, that the city made its best impression. The\r\nluxury-loving people, the wealth and extravagance of the social leaders\r\ninsisting upon London and Parisian styles, the commercial traditions of\r\nthe community gave to its shopping district an elegance found nowhere\r\nelse in America. The houses of the importers and wholesalers, some\r\nmaintaining their own ships, were found, for the most part, on Front and\r\nWater Streets. When in the spring and autumn the ships came in, and the\r\ngreat boxes of English dry-goods were stretched along the pavement of\r\nFront between Arch and Walnut Streets to be opened, it was a thrilling\r\nevent to the Philadelphians. Fluttering about them were the retail\r\nmerchants--for most of these in the days of the city’s political\r\npreëminence were women--exclaiming ecstatically over the contents. Soon\r\nthe goods were transferred to the shops, which even a Frenchman found\r\n‘remarkable for their neatness’[491]--due, no doubt, to the sex of the\r\nproprietors. What more fascinating than to stand before the great show\r\nwindows--something new--at Mrs. Whiteside’s fancy dress-goods shop, with\r\nexquisite cloths and dresses hung full length and festooned to best\r\nadvantage after the manner of Bond Street, London. Did it add anything\r\nto the appeal to know that the proprietress had come from London? Alas,\r\nno doubt. Thither the ladies from the mansions drove in their carriages\r\nto make their purchases, and thence, perhaps, for something more, to the\r\nSouth Second Street store of the smiling Mrs. Holland, and then on,\r\nperchance, to Mrs. Jane Taylor’s at the Sign of the Golden Lamb.[492]\r\nAnd then, having ministered to the materialistic yearnings of vanity, as\r\nlike as not milady directs the coachman to stop at Bell’s British Book\r\nShop on Third Street, near Pearl, lest the lord and master, in placing\r\nhis order with his London agent, overlooked something she would not\r\nmiss.\r\n\r\nAn easy, patrician life for some of these Philadelphians, but not for\r\nall. The workman receiving a dollar a day and board, and with the\r\nsmallest houses on the outskirts renting for three hundred dollars a\r\nyear, found it far from a frolic to make both ends meet. The\r\nmiddle-class employees of the stores and industries, paying from eight\r\nto twelve dollars a week for board, without wine, candles, or fire,\r\ncould have found little to interest them in Mrs. Whiteside’s show\r\nwindows, for, while the clerks were courteous and the merchant polite,\r\nthe cost of her goods was far in excess of that on Bond Street.[493] But\r\nit is not with these of the more humble order that we are concerned just\r\nnow. It is quite possible that the curious Jefferson, who had a habit of\r\nprying into the living conditions of ‘people of no importance,’ may have\r\nwondered how these lived, but the social environment of the majority of\r\nthe statesmen was far removed from the common people. It is with the\r\nworld of fashion that we are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNo society in America could have been less in harmony with the spirit of\r\ndemocracy, for nowhere was class consciousness and caste pride more\r\npronounced. ‘Those who constitute the fashionable world are at best a\r\nmere oligarchy, composed of a few natives and as many foreigners,’ wrote\r\nOtis to his wife.[494] ‘I might have believed myself in an English\r\ntown,’ said Viscount de Chateaubriand.[495] An Englishman noted that\r\n‘amongst the upper circles ... pride, haughtiness, and ostentation are\r\nconspicuous; and it seems that nothing could make them happier than that\r\nan order of nobility should be established, by which they might be\r\nexalted above their fellow citizens, as much as they are in their own\r\nconceit.’[496] A French nobleman could not escape the observation that\r\n‘the English influence prevails in the first circles and prevails with\r\ngreat intolerance.[497] And Otis, who liked the tone himself, was much\r\nimpressed with the discovery that ‘the women after presentations to the\r\ncourt of George III or Louis XVI transplanted into Philadelphia society\r\nthe manners of the English aristocracy and the fashions of Paris.’[498]\r\nDuring the days of the British occupation, the cream of society had\r\nreveled with the British officers, and many of these had resumed their\r\nplaces in the society of the republican capital without abandoning their\r\nformer views. This English tone was to be felt by Jefferson a little\r\nlater when his sympathy with the French Revolution was to enter into his\r\npolicies. From the beginning these pro-English aristocrats were to draw\r\npolitical lines in social intercourse, and in time Otis was to record\r\nthat ‘Democratic gentlemen and their families, no matter how high their\r\nsocial qualifications, were rigidly ostracised by the best\r\nsociety.’[499] Along with this went a rather vulgar deification of the\r\ndollar, and, strangely enough, a lack of polite hospitality to the\r\nstranger. ‘What is justly called society,’ wrote Liancourt whose ideas\r\nhad been fashioned at Versailles, ‘does not exist in this city. The\r\nvanity of wealth is common enough.’ The picture he paints is not a\r\npretty one. It shows a flamboyant rich man flauntingly displaying ‘his\r\nsplendid furniture, his fine English glass, and exquisite china,’ to the\r\nstranger invited to come to ‘one ceremonious dinner,’ and then\r\ndismissing him for another who had not ‘seen the magnificence of the\r\nhouse, nor tasted the old Madeira.’ This, we are told, was the routine\r\nfor all who came from Europe--‘philosophers, priests, literati, princes,\r\ndentists, wits and idiots.’ But alas, ‘the next day the lionized\r\nstranger is not known in the street except he be wealthy.’[500] However\r\nmuch they may have fallen short in manners, they yielded nothing to\r\nVersailles in dress. This ‘elegance of dress’ astonished Chateaubriand,\r\nand Liancourt was amazed at ‘the profusion and luxury’ in ‘the dresses\r\nof their wives and daughters.’ At balls, ‘the variety and richness of\r\nthe dresses did not suffer in comparison with Europe.’ The brilliant\r\nnote was assiduously sought in costumes, and there was much copying of\r\nthe subjects of Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds. One foreigner\r\nnoting the ‘immense expense on their toilet and head dress’ thought it\r\n‘too affected to be pleasing.’[501] But by common consent these grand\r\ndames and belles were beautiful, with their sparkling eyes, graceful\r\nforms, and the brilliancy of their complexions.\r\n\r\nIf this aristocracy was neglectful of the stranger who had no golden key\r\nto its interest, it was not because of a dearth of entertaining. Here\r\nthere was a hectic activity--dinners, dances, breakfasts, teas, parties\r\nenough to satisfy the most insatiate passion for such excitement.\r\nThroughout the season the great houses were ablaze with light, and if,\r\nas Mrs. Adams complained, there was much the same company in all, it was\r\ncongenial company, and the intimacy of the contact allowed a familiarity\r\nthat sometimes verged on the _risqué_. In less than a month after her\r\narrival, Mrs. Adams was appalled at ‘the invitations to tea and cards in\r\nthe European style,’[502] and was complaining that she ‘should spend a\r\nvery dissipated winter if [she] were to accept one half the invitations,\r\nparticularly to the touts or teas and cards with even Saturday night ...\r\nnot excepted.’[503] A little later Aaron Burr was being swamped with\r\n‘many attentions and civilities--many invitations to dine, etc.’[504] If\r\nBurr declined, as he wrote his wife, the handsome young Otis, who loved\r\nthe company of women, was not so coy. ‘I have dined once with Cuttling\r\nat Mrs. Grattan’s,’ he wrote home, ‘once at Yznardi’s [Spaniard who\r\nspent much time in Philadelphia] in great stile; and yesterday in the\r\ncountry with Jonathan Williams [nephew of Franklin]. I am engaged for\r\nnext Christmas with Mrs. Powell, but with nobody for the Christmas after\r\nnext.’[505]\r\n\r\nAt these functions--heavy drinking--flirting--_risqué_ talk. Even a\r\nGerman was shocked to find that at public dinners each person would\r\noften consume six bottles of Madeira.[506] Only Burr was hard to\r\nsatisfy. ‘I despair of getting genuine Trent wine in this city,’ he\r\nwrote Theodosia. ‘There never was a bottle of real unadulterated Trent\r\nimported here for sale. Mr. Jefferson, who had some for his own use, has\r\nleft town.’[507] But if there was no Trent, Madeira flowed in streams,\r\nbeer and ale, punch and whiskey and champagne could be had for the\r\nasking, and there was asking enough, even at parties and dinners. Even\r\nHamilton, who drank with moderation, sometimes became ‘liquorish’ at the\r\ntable, and on one occasion made rather free with another man’s wife to\r\nthe husband’s indignation until mollified with the assurance of his\r\nspouse that she ‘did not like him at all.’ Even so, thought the irate\r\nhusband, Hamilton ‘appears very trifling in his conversation with\r\nladies.’[508] And ‘trifling’ indeed must have been much of the talk.\r\n\r\nThus it was at a dinner at Clymer’s, a leading member of the House.\r\nPresent, Otis, the Binghams, the Willings--the top cream of the\r\naristocracy. Aha, cried the vivacious sister of Mrs. Bingham, referring\r\nto the host’s newly acquired stomacher, and mentioning the touching case\r\nof the Duke of York, recently married to the Duchess of Württemberg who\r\nwas compelled to cut a semi-circle out of his table to give access to\r\nhis plate. Mrs. Bingham coyly expressed sympathy for the Duchess.\r\n(Bursts of laughter and applause.) But Clymer, not to be outdone, turned\r\nto his married sister with the comment that he would ‘soon be able to\r\nretort this excellent jest on her.’ (Renewed laughter and more\r\napplause.) It was an hilarious occasion, the applause ‘would have done\r\ncredit to a national convention’ and ‘Miss Abby and Miss Ann did not\r\ndisguise their delight nor their bosoms.’[509] On now to a dinner at\r\nHarrison’s, who married a sister of Mrs. Bingham, where one of the\r\nguests, ‘after rallying Sophia ... upon her unfruitfulness,’ led to a\r\n‘natural but not very flattering transition’ which ‘introduced Mrs.\r\nChamplin and her want of prolific qualities as a seasoning for the\r\nCanvas Backs.’[510] But let us hurry on to a third dinner, with\r\nHamilton, his vivacious sisters-in-law, Mrs. Church and Miss Schuyler. A\r\nlively company! Mrs. Church, ‘the mirror of affectation,’ who is ‘more\r\namusing than offensive’ because so affable and free from ceremony; and,\r\nstill more lively, Miss Schuyler ‘a young wild flirt from Albany, full\r\nof glee and apparently desirous of matrimony.’ Mrs. Church drops her\r\nshoe bow, Miss Schuyler picks it up and fastens it in Hamilton’s\r\nbutton-hole with the remark, ‘I have made you a knight.’ ‘But what\r\norder?’ asks Mrs. Church, ‘he can’t be a knight of the garter in this\r\ncountry.’ ‘True, sister, but he would be if you would let him.’\r\n\r\nWine, women and song--such the spirit in some of the great houses in\r\nmoments of _abandon_. But it would be unfair to leave the impression\r\nthese incidents would convey. There were brilliant men of vast\r\nachievement, and women of extraordinary charm and cleverness moving\r\nbehind these curtained windows. Let us meet them in the mansion of Mrs.\r\nBingham--the uncrowned queen of the Federalist group--the woman without\r\na peer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNone of the three capitals of the country have produced another social\r\nleader of the cleverness, audacity, and regality of Mrs. William\r\nBingham. During the eight years of the domination of the Federalists, of\r\nwhom her husband was one of the leaders, there was no public character\r\nof the first order who did not come under the influence of her\r\nfascination. By birth, environment, nature, and training she was fitted\r\nto play a conspicuous part in the social life of any capital in the\r\nworld. The daughter of Willing, the partner of Robert Morris, she was\r\nthe favored of fortune. Some years before her birth, her father,\r\ninspired by sentimental motives, built the mansion on Third Street in\r\nwhich she was born, and patterned it after the ancestral home in\r\nBristol, England. There, surrounded by all the advantages of wealth, her\r\nbeauty unfolded through a happy childhood. The pomp and pride of great\r\npossessions did not imbue her with a passion for republics or democracy.\r\nShe was destined to play a part in a rather flamboyant aristocracy, and\r\nwas as carefully perfected in the arts and graces of her sex as any\r\nprincess destined to a throne. In the midst of the Revolution, in her\r\nsixteenth year, she married William Bingham who combined the advantages\r\nof wealth, social position, and a capacity for political leadership.\r\n\r\nShe was only twenty, when, accompanied by her husband, she went abroad\r\nto captivate court circles with her vivacity, charm, and beauty. At\r\nVersailles, the gallants, accustomed to the ways and wiles of the most\r\naccomplished women of fashion, were entranced. At The Hague, where she\r\nlingered awhile, the members of the diplomatic corps fluttered about the\r\nteasing charmer like moths about the flame. In the court circles of\r\nEngland she suffered nothing in comparison with the best it could offer,\r\nand the generous Abigail Adams, thrilling to the triumph of the young\r\nAmerican, found her brilliancy enough to dim the ineffectual fires of\r\nGeorgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Five years of familiarity with the\r\nleaders in the world of European fashion and politics prepared her to\r\npreside with stunning success over the most famous political\r\ndrawing-room of the American capital.\r\n\r\nIt was after their return from Europe that Mrs. Bingham moved into the\r\nimposing mansion on Third Street built on the ample grounds of her\r\nchildhood home. All the arts of the architect, landscape gardener, and\r\ninterior decorator had been drawn upon to make a fit setting for the\r\nmistress. The garden, with its flowers and rare shrubbery, its lemon,\r\norange, and citron trees, its aloes and exotics, was shut off from the\r\nview of the curious, only mighty oaks and the Lombardy poplars visible\r\nabove the wall--‘a magnificent house and gardens in the best English\r\nstyle.’[511] The furnishings were in keeping with the promise of the\r\nexterior. ‘The chairs in the drawing-room were from Seddon’s in London\r\nof the newest taste, the back in the form of a lyre, with festoons, of\r\nyellow and crimson silk,’ according to the description of an English\r\ntourist. ‘The curtains of the room a festoon of the same. The carpet,\r\none of Moore’s most expensive patterns. The room papered in the French\r\ntaste, after the style of the Vatican in Rome.’[512] The halls, hung\r\nwith pictures selected with fine discrimination in Italy, gave a promise\r\nnot disappointed in the elegance of the drawing-rooms, the library, the\r\nballroom, card-rooms, and observatory.[513] To some this extravagant\r\ndisplay of luxury was depressing, and Brissot de Warville, who was to\r\nreturn to Paris to die on the guillotine as a leader of the ill-fated\r\nparty of the Gironde, held the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. WILLIAM BINGHAM]\r\n\r\nmistress of the mansion responsible for the aristocratic spirit of the\r\ntown. It was a pity, he thought, that a man so sensible and amiable as\r\nBingham should have permitted a vain wife to lead him to ‘a pomp which\r\nought forever have been a stranger to Philadelphia.’ And all this\r\ndisplay ‘to draw around him the gaudy prigs and parasites of Europe,’\r\nand lead ‘to the reproach of his fellow citizens and the ridicule of\r\nstrangers.’[514] But if the French republican was shocked, even so\r\nrobust a democrat as Maclay was so little offended that he was able to\r\nwrite after dining at the mansion that ‘there is a propriety, a\r\nneatness, a cleanliness that adds to the splendor of his costly\r\nfurniture and elegant apartments.’[515]\r\n\r\nAnd ‘the dazzling Mrs. Bingham,’ as the conservative Abigail described\r\nher,[516] what of her? The elegance and beauty which has come down to us\r\non canvas prepares us for the glowing descriptions of contemporaries.\r\nHers was the type of patrician beauty that shimmered. She was above the\r\nmedium height and well-formed, and in her carriage there was\r\nsprightliness, dignity, elegance, and distinction. Sparkling with wit,\r\nbubbling with vivacity, she had the knack of convincing the most\r\nhopeless yokel introduced into her drawing-room by the exigencies of\r\npolitics that she found his personality peculiarly appealing. Daring at\r\nthe card-table, graceful in the dance, witty in conversation even though\r\nsometimes too adept with the naughty devices of a Congreve dialogue,\r\ninordinately fond of all the dissipations prescribed by fashion, tactful\r\nin the selection and placing of her guests at table, she richly earned\r\nthe scepter she waved so authoritatively over society.[517] What though\r\nshe did sometimes stain her pretty lips with wicked oaths, she swore as\r\ndaintily as the Duchess of Devonshire, and if she did seem to relish\r\nanecdotes a bit too spicy for a puritanic atmosphere, she craved not the\r\nprivilege of breathing such air.[518]\r\n\r\nHers the consuming ambition to be the great lady and to introduce into\r\nAmerican society the ideas and ideals of Paris and London. Did Jefferson\r\ngently chide her for her admiration of French women? Well--was she not\r\njustified? Did they not ‘possess the happy art of making us pleased with\r\nourselves?’ In their conversation could they not ‘please both the fop\r\nand the philosopher?’ And despite their seeming frivolity, did not these\r\n‘women of France interfere with the politics of the country, and often\r\ngive a decided turn to the fate of empires?’ In this letter to the man\r\nshe admired and liked, while loathing his politics, we have the nearest\r\ninsight into the soul of the woman.[519]\r\n\r\nBut these graver ambitions were not revealed to many who observed her\r\nmode of life, her constant round of dissipations, her putting aside the\r\nresponsibilities of a mother, leaving her daughters to their French\r\ngovernesses until the tragic elopement of Marie with a dissipated\r\nnobleman, and the apprehension of the pair after their marriage at the\r\nhome of a milliner in the early morning. Hers were not the prim notions\r\nof the average American of her time. It was Otis, not she, who was\r\nshocked to find Marie so thinly dressed in mid-winter that he was\r\n‘regaled at the sight of her whole legs for five minutes together,’ and\r\nwondered ‘to what height the fashion would be carried.’[520] Swearing,\r\nrelating risqué stories, indulging in dissipations night after night,\r\nshaming her motherhood by her affected indifference or neglect, the fact\r\nremains that the breath of scandal never touched her until the final\r\nscene when in her early thirties they bore her on a stretcher from the\r\nhome of her triumphs in the vain hope of prolonging her life in the soft\r\nair of the Bermudas.\r\n\r\nAnd so to her dinners, dances, parties, the clever men of the Federalist\r\nParty flocked, with only a sprinkling of Jeffersonians, for, though\r\nJefferson himself could always count on a gracious reception from the\r\nhostess, he was not comfortable among the other guests. Always the best\r\nwas to be had there--and the newest. Did she not introduce the foreign\r\ncustom of having servants announce the arriving guests, to the\r\ndiscomfiture of Monroe?\r\n\r\n‘Senator Monroe,’ called the flunky.\r\n\r\n‘Coming,’ cried the Senator.\r\n\r\n‘Senator Monroe’--echoed a flunky down the hall.\r\n\r\n‘Coming as soon as I can get my greatcoat off,’ promised the Senator.\r\n\r\nBut we may be sure that no expression of amusement on the face of the\r\nbeaming Mrs. Bingham added to his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n‘A very pretty dinner, Madame,’ said the intolerable Judge Chase, after\r\nlooking over the proffered repast, ‘but there is not a thing on your\r\ntable that I can eat.’\r\n\r\nAn expression of surprise or resentment on the hostess’s face? Not at\r\nall. What would the Judge relish? Roast beef? Very well--and a servant\r\nreceived his orders and soon hurried back with beef and potatoes to be\r\ngluttonously devoured and washed down with a couple of bottles of stout\r\nale instead of French wines.\r\n\r\n‘There, Madame,’ said the Judge, made comfortable, ‘I have made a\r\nsensible and excellent dinner, but no thanks to your French cook.’\r\n\r\nAnd he never knew from the lady’s pleased expression that she thought\r\nhim an insufferable bore.\r\n\r\nSuch the woman whose home was to be to the Hamiltonians what Madame\r\nRoland’s was to the Girondists, and Lady Holland’s to the English Whigs.\r\nNow let us peep into the drawing-room and observe the men and women who\r\nbowed to her social scepter.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn deference to Mrs. Bingham we shall permit the servant to announce\r\nthese visitors as they arrive.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. and Mrs. Robert Morris.’\r\n\r\nNo doubt about their importance, for he was as intimate with Washington\r\nas she with Mrs. Washington, and such was her intimacy that she was\r\nfrequently referred to as ‘the second lady in the land.’ It was she who\r\naccompanied Mrs. Washington from Philadelphia to New York after the\r\ninauguration, and during the spring and autumn the two might frequently\r\nbe seen under the trees at ‘The Hills,’ the Morris farm near the city,\r\nenjoying the view of the river and such pastoral pictures as were\r\noffered by the imported sheep and cattle grazing on the rolling hills.\r\nOf Mrs. Morris it was said that ‘so impressive is her air and demeanor\r\nthat those who saw her once seldom forgot her.’[521] She had dignity,\r\ntact, and elegance, and, like Mrs. Washington, no respect for ‘the\r\nfilthy democrats.’ She was a thorough aristocrat. Her husband, banker,\r\nmerchant, Senator, was of imposing height, his merry blue eyes, clear\r\ncomplexion, and strong features denoting something of his significance;\r\nand he had the social graces that captivate and hold. His wealth alone\r\nwould have made him a commanding figure in the society of the time and\r\nplace. Some generations were to settle on his grave before he was to\r\nappear as the martyr who had sacrificed a fortune to liberty, for there\r\nwas a different understanding in his day.[522] A natural aristocrat,\r\nultra-conservative because of his business connections and great\r\npossessions, if he was tolerant of the experiment in republicanism, he\r\ntook no pains to conceal his contempt of democracy--in Senate or\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Walter Stewart.’\r\n\r\nAnother of the intimate circle of the Washingtons who dwelt in a fine\r\nhouse next door to the Morrises, she was one of the most brilliant and\r\nfascinating women with whom Mrs. Bingham liked to surround herself. A\r\nlong way she had traveled from her girlhood home as the daughter of\r\nBlair McClenachan, the ardent democrat who was to help burn Jay’s\r\nTreaty, welcome Genêt, and to follow Jefferson, for she was the wife of\r\nthe rich General Stewart, and had been seduced by the glitter of the\r\naristocracy. Like Mrs. Bingham, she had had her fling with the nobility\r\nin London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome, and had returned to open her house\r\nfor some of the most elaborate entertaining of her time. In striking\r\nbeauty, conversational charm, and a caressing manner, she rivaled Mrs.\r\nBingham at her best. About her dinner table the leaders of the\r\nFederalist Party were frequently found.[523]\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Samuel Powell.’\r\n\r\nAn interesting lady, ‘who looks turned fifty,’[524] enters to be greeted\r\nby the hostess as ‘Aunt.’ A courteous, kindly woman, almost motherly in\r\nher manner, she talks with the fluency and ease to be expected of the\r\nmistress of the famous house on ‘Society Hill.’[525] No one of Mrs.\r\nBingham’s guests who has not promenaded on summer evenings in the Powell\r\ngardens, the walks lined with statuary.[526]\r\n\r\n‘General and Mrs. Knox.’\r\n\r\nAn impressive figure, the Secretary of War, his height carrying the two\r\nhundred and eighty pounds not ungracefully, his regular Grecian nose,\r\nflorid complexion, bright, penetrating eyes giving an attractive cast to\r\nhis countenance. They who know him best suspect that he enjoys too well\r\nthe pleasures of the table, but love him for a kindliness that temper\r\ncannot sour, a sincerity and generosity that know no bounds, a gayety\r\nthat his dignity cannot suppress--a fine sentimental figure with a\r\nRevolutionary background. What though he had been a bookseller before he\r\neloped with a lady of quality, he was too keenly appreciative of the\r\nadvantages of aristocracy to have much patience with the queer notions\r\nof Tom Jefferson, whom he liked. He rubbed his shins when Hamilton\r\nstumbled over a chair.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Knox--she must have been a dashing belle in her romantic youth,\r\nfor despite her enormous weight, she was still handsome with her black\r\neyes and blooming cheeks.[527] Passing her girlhood in the Loyalist\r\natmosphere of an aristocratic home, she had never become reconciled to\r\nthe impertinence of the people, and even during the war her adoring\r\nHenry had been moved to warn her against sneering openly at the manners\r\nand speech of the people of Connecticut. ‘The want of refinement which\r\nyou seem to speak of is, or will be, the salvation of America,’ he\r\nwrote.[528] But hers was the more masterful nature and his democracy was\r\nto capitulate to her aristocracy in the end.[529] But--whither goes the\r\nlady from the drawing-room so quickly? Ah--of course, it is to the\r\ncard-room, for was it not the gossip that ‘the follies of a gambling\r\nwife are passed on to the debits of her husband?’[530] In the morning,\r\nno doubt, she will run in on Mrs. Washington at the Morris house, for\r\nthey are very close.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Hamilton.’\r\n\r\nWhat a romantic picture he makes in the finery that sets him off so\r\nwell--brilliant eyes sparkling, eloquent lips smiling, a courtly figure\r\nbending over the hostess’s hand. Only a moment for the lightest kind of\r\nbanter with the ladies, and he is off to the Pemberton mansion to work\r\nfar into the night. Mrs. Hamilton will linger a little longer, an\r\nappealing type of woman, her delicate face set off by ‘fine eyes which\r\nare very dark’ and ‘hold the life and energy of the restrained\r\ncountenance.’[531] Hamilton had found her in the Schuyler homestead at\r\nAlbany, ‘a brunette with the most good-natured, dark lovely eyes,’[532]\r\ngentle, retiring, but in the home circle full of gayety and courage.\r\nWeeks and months sometimes found her missing from the social circle, for\r\nwith her, in those days, life was just one baby after another.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Wolcott, and Miss Wolcott.’\r\n\r\nA pleasing personality was that of the handsome protégé of Hamilton,\r\nbreathing the spirit of jollity, given to badinage, capable, too, of\r\nserious conversation on books and plays. He loses himself in the lively\r\nthrong, but his infectious laughter is as revealing of his presence as\r\nthe bell of Bossy in the woods. But we are more interested in his\r\ncompanions. Mrs. Wolcott was all loveliness and sweetness, grace and\r\ndignity, and such was the appeal of her conversation that one statesman\r\nthought her ‘a divine woman’; another, ‘the magnificent Mrs. Wolcott’;\r\nand the brusque Senator Tracy of her State, on being assured by a\r\ncondescending diplomat that she would shine at any court, snorted that\r\nshe even shone at Litchfield.[533] Even so the eyes of the younger men\r\nare upon Mary Ann Wolcott, sister of the Federalist leader, a pearl of\r\nher sex, combining an extraordinary physical beauty with opulent charms,\r\nand a conversational brilliance unsurpassed by any woman of the social\r\ncircle. Very soon she would marry the clever, cynical Chauncey Goodrich\r\nand take her place in official society in her own right. The Wolcotts,\r\nwe may be sure, read Paine’s ‘Rights of Man’ with amazement and disgust.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Sedgwick.’\r\n\r\nA magnificent type of physical manhood, the face of one accustomed to\r\ncommand and sneer down opposition; a woman of elegance and refinement,\r\ntypical of the best New England could offer in a matron.\r\n\r\n‘Pierce Butler.’\r\n\r\nA handsome widower this man, maintaining an elegant establishment in\r\nPhiladelphia, who affected to be a democrat, and carefully selected his\r\nassociates from among the aristocracy, a South Carolinian with a certain\r\nreverence for wealth.\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. William Jackson.’\r\n\r\nAn equally charming but less beautiful sister of the hostess, now wife\r\nof one of Washington’s secretaries, a favorite at the Morris mansion,\r\nand with no time for thinking on the grievances of the yokels and\r\nmechanics--an American prototype of the merry ladies of Versailles\r\nbefore the storm broke.\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign faces we miss the tall figure of Talleyrand whose\r\nPhiladelphia immoralities shocked the French Minister, and whose affairs\r\nwith a lady of color[534] excluded him from the Bingham drawing-room.\r\nBut there is Viscount de Noailles who had proposed the abolition of\r\nfeudal rights in the early days of the French Revolution; and Count\r\nTilley, the dissipated roué planning an elopement with his hostess’s\r\ndaughter with the connivance of her French governess; and Brissot de\r\nWarville, enlightened political idealist of France soon to fall beneath\r\nthe knife of Robespierre. There, too, the Duc de La\r\nRochefoucauld-Liancourt who was redolent of courts, and the Baring\r\nbrothers of London, bankers, soon to marry the Bingham girls.\r\n\r\nA veritable Vanity Fair, many clever, some brilliant, most skeptical of\r\nrepublics, idolatrous of money and distinctions, and few capable of\r\ndiscriminating between anarchy and democracy. Such was the social\r\natmosphere of the capital when the fight to determine whether this\r\nshould be a democratic or aristocratic republic was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWe have an English-drawn picture of an evening at the British Legation\r\nwith many American guests gathered about the blazing fire. The Consul is\r\n‘descanting on various subjects, public and private, as well as public\r\nand private characters, sometimes with unbecoming levity, sometimes with\r\nsarcasm even more unbecoming.’ An English guest was afraid that such\r\ntalk ‘could hardly fail to be offensive to ... many of the guests and to\r\nthe good taste of all.’ But could this English gentleman have listened\r\nin on the conversations at Mrs. Bingham’s, Mrs. Morris’s, or Mrs.\r\nStewart’s, he might have concluded that these reflections on certain\r\npublic characters were altogether pleasing to the principal figures in\r\nthe society of the capital.[535] And could he have returned a little\r\nlater to find society chuckling over the display in the windows of a\r\nnewspaper office of the pictures of George III, Lord North, and General\r\nHowe, he might have decided that there was a pronouncedly pro-English\r\nparty in America. Had he driven about the environs, among the hills, and\r\nalong the banks of the rivers, he would have seen country houses of the\r\naristocracy--Lansdowne, the seat of the Binghams; Bush Hill, where the\r\nAdamses lived at first; Woodford, and other country places to suggest\r\nsimilar seats in his own land. And had he been meandering in the\r\nneighborhood of Horsehead’s or Chew’s Landing, seven or nine miles out,\r\nhe might have been startled at the familiar English picture of gentlemen\r\nin bright coats, the pack in full cry after the fox.[536] And having\r\nmade these observations he could have found some extenuation in the\r\nconversation in the British Minister’s house.\r\n\r\nThe snobbery of class consciousness entered into even the Dancing\r\nAssembly which held forth at frequent intervals at O’Eller’s, in a\r\nballroom sixty feet square, with a handsome music gallery at one end,\r\nand the walls papered after the French style.[537] The suppers at these\r\ndances were mostly liquid,[538] and, since it is on record that on hot\r\nsummer days ladies and gentlemen could count on a cool iced punch with\r\npineapple juice to heighten the color, it may be assumed that the\r\nAssembly suppers were a success.[539] The fact that the young ladies\r\nsometimes took two pair of slippers, lest they dance one out, hints of\r\nall-night revels.[540] And the expulsion from membership of a young\r\nwoman who had dared marry a jeweler tells its own tale.[541] At the\r\ntheater, which was usually crowded,[542] the aristocrats and democrats\r\nmet without mingling, for the different prices put every one in his or\r\nher place, and if wine and porter were sold between acts to the people\r\nin the pit ‘precisely as if they were in a tavern,’[543] the aristocracy\r\npaid eight dollars for a box,[544] and an attaché, in full dress of\r\nblack, hair powdered and adjusted in the formal fashion, and bearing\r\nsilver candlesticks and wax candles, would meet Washington at the\r\nentrance and conduct him with much gravity to the presidential box,\r\nfestooned with red drapery, and bearing the United States coat of\r\narms.[545] ‘The managers have been very polite to me and my family,’\r\nwrote Mrs. Adams. ‘The actors came and informed us that a box is\r\nprepared for us. The Vice-President thanked them for their civility, and\r\ntold them he would attend whenever the President did.’[546] On these\r\noccasions, when the highest dignitaries of the State attended, a\r\nstranger, dropped from the clouds, would have scarcely thought himself\r\nin a republic. At the theater he would have found a military guard, with\r\nan armed soldier at each stage door, with four or five others in the\r\ngallery, and these assisted by the high constables of the city and\r\npolice officers.[547] There was no danger threatening but the occasion\r\noffered the opportunity for pompous display so tempting to the society\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nAt first the statesmen had to content themselves with the old Southwark\r\nTheater, which was dreary enough architecturally, lighted with oil lamps\r\nwithout glasses, and with frequent pillars obstructing the view.[548]\r\nBut the best plays were presented, by good if not brilliant players, and\r\nthe aristocracy flirted and frolicked indifferent to the resentful\r\nglances of the poorer classes in less favored seats. It reached the\r\nclimax of its career just as the new theater was about to open with the\r\nthen celebrated tragic actress, Mrs. Melmoth--and soon afterward, the\r\nnew Chestnut Street Theater opened its doors and raised its curtain. The\r\nopening was an event--the public entranced. Two or three rows of boxes,\r\na gallery with Corinthian columns highly gilded and with a crimson\r\nribbon from capital to base. Above the boxes, crimson drapery--panels of\r\nrose color--seats for two thousand. ‘As large as Covent Garden,’ wrote\r\nWansey, ‘and to judge by the dress and appearance of the company around\r\nme, and the actors and scenery, I should have thought I had still been\r\nin England.’[549] And such a company! There was Fennell, noted in Paris\r\nfor his extravagance, socially ambitious, and handsome, too, with his\r\nsix feet of stature, and ever-ready blush, about whom flocked the\r\nliterary youth of the town. Ladies--the finest trembled to his howls of\r\ntragedy and simpered to his comedy. There, too, was Harwood, who had\r\nmarried the granddaughter of Ben Franklin--a perfect gentleman; and\r\nMrs. Oldmixon, the spouse of Sir John, the ‘beau of Bath,’ who divided\r\nhonors in his day with Nash and Brummel; and Mrs. Whitlock, whom her\r\nadmirers insisted did not shine merely by the reflected glory of her\r\nsister, Mrs. Siddons.\r\n\r\nQuite as appealing to both aristocrat and democrat was the Circus at\r\nTwelfth and Market Streets, established in 1792 by John Ricketts whose\r\ncredentials to society were in his erstwhile connection with the\r\nBlackfriars Bridge Circus of London. Washington and Martha occasionally\r\nwitnessed the performances, quite soberly we may be sure, and the ‘court\r\nparty’ thus got its cue if any were needed. The proprietor riding two\r\nhorses at full gallop, Signor Spinacuta dancing daringly on a tight\r\nrope, a clown tickling the risibilities of the crowd and mingling Mrs.\r\nBingham’s laughter with that of Mrs. Jones, her washwoman, women on\r\nhorseback doing stunts, and a trained horse that could leap over other\r\nhorses without balking--such were the merry nights under the dripping\r\ncandles.[550]\r\n\r\nThen there was Bowen’s Wax Works and museum of curiosities and paintings\r\nand the museum of Mr. Peale--and under the same roof with the latter the\r\nreading-room of the Philosophical Society, where Jefferson was to find a\r\nsanctuary in the days when he was to be anathema in the fashionable\r\ndrawing-rooms.\r\n\r\nFrivolity, extravagance, exaggerated imitation of Old-World\r\ndissipations, could scarcely have been suited to Jefferson’s taste; but\r\nwhen he wished for society of another sort he could always run in on\r\nRittenhouse to discuss science, or on Dr. Rush who mixed politics with\r\npowders, or, better still, he could drive out to ‘Stenton,’ the\r\nbeautiful country house of Dr. James Logan and his cultured wife,\r\napproached by its glorious avenue of hemlocks. There he could sit under\r\nthe trees on the lawn or walk in the old-fashioned gardens or browse in\r\nthe fine library. There before the huge fireplace in the lofty\r\nwainscoted rooms he could sit with the Doctor and discuss the\r\naristocratic tendencies of the times--and this he frequently did.\r\nDespite his democracy, Jefferson lived like an aristocrat. He had found\r\na place in the country near the city where the house was ‘entirely\r\nembosomed in high plane trees with good grass below,’ and there, on warm\r\nsummer days, he was wont to ‘breakfast, dine, write, read, and\r\nentertain company’ under the trees. Even in its luxury, his was the home\r\nof the philosopher. It was under these plane trees that he worked out\r\nmuch of the strategy of his political battles.[551] Such was the social\r\nbackground for the struggle of Hamilton and Jefferson--with little in it\r\nto strengthen or encourage the latter in his fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON MOBILIZES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson assumed the task of organizing the opposition to the\r\npolicies of the Federalists all the forces most susceptible to\r\norganization and intelligent direction were arrayed upon the other side.\r\nThe commercial interests, constituting Hamilton’s shock troops, had\r\ntheir organizations in all the larger towns and in a crisis could be\r\nspeedily mobilized in the smaller. The various Chambers of Commerce were\r\nFederalist clubs that could be summoned to action on a day’s notice. The\r\nfinancial interests, always in close formation when not sleeping on\r\ntheir arms, could be ordered to the front overnight. The live-wire\r\nspeculators whose fortunes had sprung up magically were on their toes to\r\ndo battle for the system that had enriched them, and eager to do the\r\nbidding of the magician who had waved the wand. The greater part of the\r\nintellectuals, lawyers, doctors, professors, preachers, were\r\nenthusiastic champions of Hamiltonian policies--and because of their\r\nprestige these were powerful factors in the moulding of opinion. And,\r\nmost serious of all, from Jefferson’s point of view, the major portion\r\nof the press was either militantly Hamiltonian or indifferently\r\ndemocratic. In the drawing-rooms were heard the sentiments of the\r\nChambers of Commerce--in glorification of materialism.\r\n\r\nThe rich, the powerful, and their retainers among the men of the\r\nprofessions, were bound to the Federalist by a common interest in\r\nproperty and a common fear of the masses. Since the policies of Hamilton\r\nwere frankly in the interests of the commercial classes, their\r\nsupporters were found largely in cities and towns of the commercial\r\nNorth--within easy reach. A word from the chief to his leaders in the\r\ncapital--Ames and Cabot of Massachusetts; King, Schuyler, and Lawrence\r\nof New York; Wolcott and Ellsworth of Connecticut; Morris, Bingham, and\r\nFitzsimmons of Pennsylvania; Dayton of New Jersey; McHenry of Maryland;\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHER AMES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT GOODLOE HARPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE CABOT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOUVERNEUR MORRIS]\r\n\r\nSmith and Harper of South Carolina--a word from these to the commercial\r\nleaders in their States, and from these a word to those under\r\nobligations to them--the small merchants operating on credit--and the\r\ncoffee-houses buzzed, the Chambers of Commerce acted, editors plied\r\ntheir pens, preachers thundered from pulpits, and even at the social\r\nfunctions they danced and flirted in the war paint of the party.\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson surveyed the field, he observed that his great antagonist’s\r\norganization was but a consolidation of organizations previously\r\nexistent--and these imposing in their representation of wealth,\r\nintellect, and social prestige. Hamilton could snap his fingers, and the\r\nmerchants came; could lift his hand, and the officers of the Cincinnati\r\nwere in the saddle; could wave his wand, and Fenno, Russell, and other\r\npotent editors would instantly do his bidding, and the preachers of New\r\nEngland scarcely waited for the sign to pass the devil by to damn\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nBut Jefferson had his eye on other forces, numerically stronger, if less\r\nimposing. The farmers, comprising ninety per cent of the Nation, were\r\nresentful of policies that pampered the merchant and left them out in\r\nthe cold. The private soldiers of the Revolution, less respected then\r\nthan when Webster made his Bunker Hill address, were embittered because\r\ntheir securities had gone for a song while speculators had waxed wealthy\r\non the sacrifice. The more robust republicans were shocked at the\r\naristocratic affectations of their rulers and the tone of the Federalist\r\npress. The excise law was hated in the remote sections, and unpopular\r\nwith the masses everywhere. The doctrine of implied powers had alarmed\r\nthe friends of State sovereignty. There was an undercurrent of feeling,\r\nwhich Jefferson, with ear marvelously keen for rumblings, caught, that\r\nlaws were passed for the few at the expense of the many. And it was\r\nbeing bruited abroad that in high quarters there was a disposition to\r\ncultivate England to the neglect of France. Everywhere through the South\r\nand West there was a bitter resentment of government by and for the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIncluding all, and more important than any single one, there was a\r\nfervent spirit of democracy running through the land, while the\r\nFederalist leaders were openly denouncing the democrats. ‘Looking simply\r\nat the field of American history,’ says Professor Anson D. Morse, ‘it\r\nwould be just to enumerate among the causes of the Democratic Party all\r\ninfluences which from the beginning of the colonial period carried\r\nforward at a really marvelous rate the democratization of the American\r\ncharacter.’[552] The country was really democratic before there was a\r\nparty of democracy. Jefferson knew it; Hamilton never suspected it, or,\r\nsuspecting, determined to override the sentiment. Therein lies the\r\noriginal cause of the ultimate triumph of Jefferson, and the evidence\r\nthat the Federalist Party was foredoomed to ultimate failure.\r\n\r\nBut how to reach, galvanize, vitalize, organize this great widely\r\nscattered mass of unimportant, inarticulate individuals--that was the\r\nproblem that confronted Jefferson. Ninety-five per cent of the people\r\nlived in the country or in villages. Communication was difficult. There\r\nwere for them no Chambers of Commerce, no coffee-houses, no Faneuil\r\nHalls. Thousands had no idea what was going on outside the boundaries of\r\ntheir isolated farms and villages. If the masses in the cities were in\r\nsympathy with democracy--and they were--comparatively few of these were\r\npermitted to vote. Under the John Jay Constitution of New York, as late\r\nas 1790, only 1303 of the 13,330 male residents of voting age in New\r\nYork City were allowed to vote with the property qualification\r\ndeliberately designed for their disfranchisement.[553] In Vermont alone,\r\nof the New England States, no property qualification attached to the\r\nsuffrage, albeit in New Hampshire any male paying tax, however small,\r\nwas qualified. In Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut great\r\nnumbers were excluded by their poverty. Thus, in the beginning, the\r\nthousands of hewers of wood and drawers of water in the towns and cities\r\nof the North were lost to all practical purposes. But all of the common\r\nfolk were not disfranchised, and they who had the vote were splendid\r\nmaterial for a militant organization. They had a genius for practical\r\npolitics when under the orders of a drill master, and were not too\r\nfastidious for the grime and sweat of the polling-places. One of these\r\nwas worth a dozen dandies from Mrs. Bingham’s circle on election\r\nday.[554] There was abundant material for a party--if it could be\r\nassembled and coordinated.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson’s mild eye surveyed the field, he found in almost every\r\nState local parties, some long in existence, fighting for popular rights\r\nas they understood them; but their fights had been waged on local\r\nissues. The party he was to create was to fight in precisely the same\r\ncause--on the national field. Here, then, was something already at hand.\r\nWhy not consolidate these local parties into one great national\r\norganization, and broaden the issue to include the problems of both\r\nState and Nation? The local leaders? Why not make them field marshals in\r\ncommand of the Massachusetts division, the North Carolina division,\r\nPennsylvania and Maryland divisions?\r\n\r\nThe philosopher-politician took up his pen, for he had learned in the\r\norganization of the Revolution what could be done through\r\ncorrespondence. Out under the plane trees he was to sit at his table\r\nwriting--to Sam Adams, to Rutledge, to John Taylor, to Willie Jones.\r\nUnder his roof and at his table conferences with Madison, Monroe, Giles,\r\nBloodworth, became commonplace. ‘Oh, I should note that Mr. Jefferson,\r\nwith more than Parisian politeness, waited on me at my chamber this\r\nmorning,’ wrote Maclay. ‘He talked politics, mostly the French\r\ndifference and the whale fishery.’[555] A very cautious approach, we may\r\nbe sure, for the master politician and psychologist thoroughly\r\nunderstood the little vanities, prejudices, and weaknesses of that\r\nsingularly suspicious democrat. Quite different would have been a\r\nconversation with Gallatin or Monroe. Taking an inventory of prospective\r\nlieutenants in the States, and comparing the material with that against\r\nhim, he could not but have realized his disadvantage. Brilliant men are\r\nprone to flutter about the rich and powerful, and nothing succeeds like\r\nsuccess with the strong. No chance for him to ride to war surrounded by\r\nsuch scintillating company as that which encircled Hamilton--but here\r\nand there was a man who shimmered in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, home of Ames, Cabot, and Sedgwick, Jefferson could\r\ncount on two men who surpassed any of this famous group in service in\r\nthe making of the Republic, but, strange as it may seem in perspective,\r\nold Sam Adams and John Hancock were not in good standing with the staid\r\nbusiness men of Boston. Their republicanism was too robust, their\r\ndevotion to the principles of the Declaration too uncompromising for the\r\nmaterialists, who appeared, for the most part, on the battle-field after\r\nthe fight was won, to claim the fruits of the victory. Sam Adams had\r\nlost his race for Congress to Fisher Ames who had dallied with his books\r\nwhen the ragged Continentals were struggling in the field. When the\r\nclever politicians of the Essex Junto exchanged letters, these erstwhile\r\nRevolutionary heroes of the dark days were seldom mentioned with\r\nrespect; but they had their following in the streets and among those who\r\nhad shared in the perils they had faced. Upon these two Jefferson could\r\nrely.\r\n\r\nBut there were others, more active and militant in the Boston of those\r\ndays in the building of the party of democracy. Foremost in the fight,\r\nand most annoying to the ruling oligarchy, was the brilliant Dr. Charles\r\nJarvis, who was a powerful orator[556] whose social status, on a par\r\nwith that of Otis, raised him above the condescension or contempt of the\r\nmoneyed aristocracy, and whose ability was beyond the reach of\r\ndisparagement.[557] Through many years of leadership in the legislature\r\nhe ‘had made the rights of man his pole star.’[558] No one did so much\r\nto organize and vitalize the masses, for he could pass from the\r\nlegislative hall to the public platform without any diminution of power.\r\nAs in the former he could match the best in argument, on the latter no\r\none knew better how to direct the storm. ‘Jarvis’s electioneering\r\ninfluence in this town is very great,’ wrote John Quincy Adams to his\r\nfather.[559]\r\n\r\nAs a file leader, organizer, agitator, he had powerful support in the\r\nrobust, rough-hewn rope-maker, Ben Austin, who wrestled under the rules\r\nof catch-as-catch-can, mingled with the element that Ames and Cabot\r\nconsidered vulgar, and under the signature of ‘Honestus’ dealt telling\r\nblows in letters that the mechanic could understand. ‘Rabid essays,’\r\nthey were--judged by the standard of the élite.[560] Sam Adams, John\r\nHancock, Austin, and Jarvis--these were the Jeffersonian leaders in the\r\nOld Bay State. Less aggressive, but often valuable, was James Sullivan,\r\norator, leader of the Bar, letter-writer and pamphleteer, whose vigorous\r\nmind, powers of application, and indomitable courage were to render\r\nyeoman service.\r\n\r\nIn the other New England States the democrats were less fortunate. In\r\nConnecticut, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of preachers,\r\nprofessors, and reactionary politicians, the prospects were dark enough,\r\nbut even there the Jeffersonians found a leader capable of coping with\r\nthe best of the opposition in the hard-hitting, resourceful Abraham\r\nBishop, who was a veritable scandal and stench to the gentlemen of the\r\ncloth and of the counting-room. Nowhere in America was such an amazing\r\ncombination of Church and State. Election days were celebrated with\r\nreligious services, and the sermons were party harangues, described by\r\nthe irreverent Bishop as consisting of ‘a little of governor, a little\r\nof Congress, much of politics, and a very little of religion--a strange\r\ncompote, like a carrot pie, having so little ingredients that the cook\r\nmust christen it.’[561] The ruling Council of the State was so organized\r\nthat the system was an impregnable stronghold beyond the reach of the\r\npeople. Nowhere on American soil anything so un-American or\r\nunrepublican. It did its work behind doors closed and barred. The\r\nCongregational clergy were the Cossacks of Connecticut Federalism,\r\nlaying the lash of their furious denunciation on the backs of critics.\r\nIt required more than a majority to rule under this system, and more\r\nthan ordinary courage to challenge its pretensions.[562] The good Doctor\r\nDwight of Yale was busy damning democrats to perdition. A little later\r\nGideon Granger and Ephraim Kirby were to take their place beside Bishop,\r\nand with the aid of the ‘American Mercury’ of Hartford and the ‘New\r\nLondon Bee’ to give blow for blow. But the fighting was against\r\ndesperate odds, the Federalists strongly entrenched on a steep hill, the\r\nascent to which could be raked with canister.\r\n\r\n‘The masses are disfranchised,’ cried Bishop. ‘Yes, poor porpoises,’\r\nsneered Noah Webster the Federalist who was soon to become editor of a\r\nNew York paper launched by Hamilton.[563] But Bishop and his little\r\ncoterie were fighters, and Jefferson took them to his heart.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire, Jefferson had to bide his time. Among the members of\r\nthe Senate no one had a better record of unselfish Revolutionary service\r\nthan John Langdon. Practical, hard-headed, unimaginative, a lover of\r\nmoney, he had accumulated some wealth in mercantile pursuits. Fond of\r\ncompany, pleasing and unaffected in his manner, impressive in\r\nappearance, his senatorial toga became him well.[564] When Hamilton’s\r\nfinancial plans were pending, he gave them his support, and, alas,\r\nprofited not a little, but from the beginning the keen-eyed Jefferson\r\ndiscerned the traits that were ultimately to separate him from the\r\nHamiltonians. Within two years Langdon had assumed the leadership of the\r\nJeffersonians in New Hampshire, but as late as 1798, according to the\r\nrecollection of a famous Jacksonian, ‘with the exception of Langdon and\r\na few sterling patriots there could not be said to be in this State a\r\nparty favorable to the principles of Thomas Jefferson.’[565]\r\n\r\nIn Vermont the situation was somewhat similar, albeit the opportunities\r\nthere were greater in the absence of a property qualification for the\r\nvote. There, too, was Matthew Lyon, of whom we shall hear much, whose\r\nfanatical devotion to democracy was a heritage from a father who had\r\npaid the penalty of his patriotism on the gallows in Ireland; whose\r\nhatred of aristocracy was but a reaction to the memory of his days of\r\npoverty. Possessing a genius for business, and succeeding, he was\r\nirresistibly drawn to politics, where his Celtic humor, his energy,\r\nimpetuosity, and sincerity surrounded him with friends. His radicalism\r\nbecame a flaming torch that lighted up the granite hills. Not for\r\nnothing was he born in the land of the Donnybrook Fair, for he loved a\r\nfight or a frolic, and he was to have much of both. Enlisting in the\r\nJeffersonian fight in the beginning, he was to fight unceasingly, take\r\nblows, and know the degradation of a cell. There was a degree of felony\r\nin democracy in the New England of the last days of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island, Jefferson sought vainly for an effective leader, though\r\nthe field was fertile because of the lingering hostility to\r\ncentralization and the poverty and debts of the people.\r\n\r\nLeaving New England, the leader found much to interest him in New York.\r\nThere was that sturdy, indomitable champion of State rights, and\r\ninveterate enemy of aristocracy, George Clinton, an uncompromising\r\nrepublican of Cromwellian audacity and decision, with an unequaled hold\r\non the confidence and affections of the people. There, too, were the\r\nLivingstons, mortally offended by the political stupidity of Hamilton in\r\ndefeating the brilliant Chancellor’s aspirations for the Senate. Had\r\nthis numerous and powerful family a conference one night to discuss the\r\naffront and to emerge a unit in opposition?[566] Whatever the cause, the\r\neffect was clear--the Livingston clan was only too eager to join the\r\ninsurgents, and this was not lost on the astute politician of\r\nMonticello. Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, convincing orator, erudite\r\nlawyer, profound statesman, fascinating personality, possessing the\r\nglamour of wealth and tradition so important to a Jeffersonian leader in\r\nNew York with its commercial princes and barons of the soil--here was a\r\nman to be cultivated with all the finesse of which Jefferson was\r\ncapable. The master of Monticello could speak the language of the master\r\nof the New York manor house.\r\n\r\nAnd Burr? Just what Jefferson expected of Burr is a mystery unsolvable.\r\nHe appreciated his brilliancy and professional prestige, but were the\r\npenetrating eyes blind to the weaknesses of character? Just a little\r\nwhile before Burr had joined with Hamilton against Clinton, and\r\nFederalist votes had sent him to the Senate. There, to be sure, he had\r\narrayed himself on the popular side, but could he be relied upon? He had\r\nplayed a lone hand, holding aloof from the Clintonians and the\r\nLivingstons, and dining often at the table of Hamilton; but that he was\r\nsingled out for assiduous cultivation we may be sure. No one was closer\r\nto Jefferson than Dr. Rush when, in the early fall of 1792, the latter\r\nwrote a wheedling note to Burr. ‘Your friends everywhere,’ wrote the\r\nDoctor, ‘look to you to take an active part in removing the monarchical\r\nrubbish of our government. It is time to speak out or we are\r\nundone.’[567] Previous to this, Jefferson had been most courteous in\r\npermitting the charming Senator from New York to examine papers in the\r\narchives of the State Department until Washington interposed.[568]\r\n\r\nClinton, Livingston, and Burr--a triumvirate that caught Jefferson’s\r\nfancy; but he was interested in opportunities in New York having no\r\ndirect connection with any of the three. The less imaginative Maclay had\r\nseen in a parade of the Sons of Tammany only ‘a grotesque scene,’ with\r\nthe members ‘in Indian dresses,’ and while he had addressed them at a\r\ndinner he had concluded that ‘there is some kind of a scheme’ which was\r\n‘not well digested as yet.’[569] Jefferson made it his business to learn\r\nmore. He found that the strange organization was an answer, in part, to\r\nthe Cincinnati which stood, in the popular mind, for aristocracy; that\r\nit was rabidly republican and wholly democratic; that it sympathized\r\nwith the revolutionists in France, and resented the property\r\ndisqualifications of our own Revolutionary soldiers for the suffrage,\r\nwhile the wealthy, notoriously friendly to England when these soldiers\r\nfought, were being accorded political recognition and place. Here was a\r\nsociety after his own heart, here a method to make the masses felt--a\r\ncombination and coördination of their efforts. All over the land the\r\nhundreds of thousands of inarticulate, unimportant, ineffective,\r\ncommonplace friends of democracy, and in one city these had been given a\r\nvoice, an arm, a rostrum. It was not ‘grotesque’ to Jefferson. He did\r\nnot join these imitation red men in their wigwam, nor drink of their\r\nale, but John Pintard the chief became his friend and idolater, and with\r\nhim the great man talked. The non-partisan society grew more and more\r\ndemocratic, soon intensely partisan, and at Tammany dinners the welkin\r\nrang to the toast to ‘Thomas Jefferson.’ New York became a cock-pit from\r\nthe start.\r\n\r\nBut when the Jeffersonian board of strategy turned to New Jersey, the\r\nproblem was more difficult. No outstanding leader, strong in the faith,\r\nstood ready to mount and ride. There, true, the Janus-faced Jonathan\r\nDayton was ready to flirt with any force that might serve his personal\r\nends. He was a speculator--and worse. Supporting and profiting from the\r\nHamilton policies, he smiled on the Jeffersonians significantly.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania there was the nucleus of a party and virile men to lead\r\nit--men like Mifflin, who, despite his drunkenness, was popular and a\r\npower; like Maclay, who had the force that intense conviction brings in\r\nspite of temperamental handicaps; men like Alexander J. Dallas,\r\naggressive, daring, able; men utterly unfit for\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBERT GALLATIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD LIVINGSTON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BRANCH GILES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES MADISON]\r\n\r\nthe rough-and-tumble combats of practical politics whose characters and\r\nabilities made them potent in the fight--like Rush the physician,\r\nRittenhouse the scientist, Logan the philosopher, and, looming above the\r\ntops of the Western forests, a young giant and genius, Albert Gallatin.\r\n\r\nIn Delaware, nothing; in Maryland, John Francis Mercer, fighter and\r\nintriguer, sapper and miner, agitator and organizer, with whom democracy\r\nwas a religion, Hamilton a devil, and Jefferson a saint. In Virginia, a\r\nsparkling galaxy, Madison, Monroe, the accomplished Pendleton, the\r\nresourceful Giles, the extraordinary John Taylor of Caroline.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina, Jefferson found a leader cut from his own pattern, an\r\naristocratic democrat, a radical rich man, a consummate politician who\r\nmade the history that lesser men wrote without mentioning his name,\r\nWillie Jones of Halifax. His broad acres, his wealth, his high social\r\nstanding were the objects of his pride, and he lived in luxury and wore\r\nfine linen while the trusted leader of the masses, mingling familiarly\r\nwith the most uncouth back-woodsman, inviting, however, only the select\r\nto partake of the hospitality of his home. There was more than a touch\r\nof the Virginia aristocrat of the time in his habits--he raced, gambled,\r\nhunted like a gentleman. Like Jefferson he was a master of the art of\r\ninsinuation, a political and social reformer. He loved liberty, hated\r\nintolerance, and prevented the ratification of the Constitution in the\r\nfirst State Convention because of the absence of a Bill of Rights. There\r\nhe exerted a subtle influence that was not conspicuous on the floor. If\r\nhe was neither orator nor debater, he was a strategist, disciplinarian,\r\ndiplomat, who fought with velvet gloves--with iron within. A\r\ncharacteristic portrait would show him puffing at his pipe in the midst\r\nof his farmer followers, suggesting, insinuating, interspersing his\r\npolitical conversation with discussions of the crops, farming\r\nimplements, hunting dogs, horses. An Anthony in arousing the passions by\r\nsubtle hints, he was an Iago in awakening suspicions.[570] Here was the\r\nman with the stuff that Jefferson required, generous and lovable in\r\nsocial relations, in politics relentless, hard as iron. He was the\r\nJefferson of North Carolina--‘a man ... the object of more hatred and\r\nmore adoration than has ever since lived’ in that State.[571] Nor did he\r\nstand alone without assistants, for there was Nathaniel Macon, honest,\r\nintense, man of the soil who loved his few acres, his dogs and horses,\r\nand his class; and there was Timothy Bloodworth whose fierce adherence\r\nto democracy and fanatical hatred of privilege may have been a poignant\r\nreflection of his poverty. Jones, the aristocratic lord of many acres;\r\nMacon the representative of the small farmer; Bloodworth the artisan,\r\nsmithy at the forge, watchmaker, wheelwright, as well as preacher,\r\ndoctor, and cultivator of the soil: his radicalism was born in suffering\r\nand in suffering he had grown.[572]\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, Jefferson had equal cause for satisfaction. There were small\r\nfarms, poor industrious men, ardent republicans, with the frontiersmen’s\r\nnatural democracy and the debtors’ suspicions of concentrated wealth\r\nallied with governmental power. And there to lead them was James\r\nJackson, idol of the people, a boisterous, impassioned orator whose\r\neloquence often gave more heat than light. Historians have been prone to\r\nsneer at him, but this man who came as a child from Devonshire in\r\nEngland to take his place three years later in the army of Washington,\r\nand to receive the keys of Savannah from the British ten years after his\r\narrival, was something more than an upstart. He who refused the\r\ngovernorship of his State when twenty-one, and six years after leaving\r\nhis English home, to take his chances in the field, was scarcely an\r\nobject for jest. He was a power as a leader and was to strike Titan\r\nblows in the cause that Jefferson nationally led.[573]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, dominated by rich commercial Charleston, Jefferson\r\nlong looked in vain for a leader for his cause. A friend of the\r\nPinckneys and the Rutledges, they held aloof or joined their fortunes\r\nwith Hamilton. Only toward the close did Charles Pinckney, the most\r\neloquent, resourceful, and magnetic of his family, part company with his\r\ncousins to lunge and lash with gusty joy for the man of Monticello.\r\n\r\nSuch were the leaders on whom Jefferson was dependent in welding the\r\npopular parties in the various States into a strong national army\r\nmarching in step, with a common policy and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHad Jefferson been even richer than Hamilton in brilliant leaders, he\r\nwould not have made the latter’s fatal blunder of assuming them to be\r\nenough. He was too much the practical politician to be impressed with a\r\nbrilliant staff of officers--without privates. He set out to arouse the\r\nmasses, mobilize, drill, and lead them. Above all, it was his intention\r\nto lead. Within a year, Ames was to observe with desperation and disgust\r\nthe divisions among the Federalists and to comment that ‘Virginia moves\r\nin a solid column ... the discipline of the [Jefferson] party is as\r\nsevere as the Prussian’ and ‘deserters are not spared.’[574]\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was to get the men to discipline. A vast number of\r\nthe masses had no conception of their political power and were\r\nindifferent to the vote. Thousands over the country were disfranchised\r\nby property qualifications, and one of the prime purposes of the new\r\nparty would be to break these down. The immediate problem was to awaken\r\nthe interest of those who, having the vote, did not appreciate the\r\nprivilege. With many of these, this was due to the lack of political\r\nconsciousness; with others, to the feeling that it was useless for the\r\nunimportant to attempt to influence governmental action. To the latter\r\nit would be necessary to prove the possibilities of the concerted action\r\nof large numbers of uninfluential men--and there was the Society of\r\nTammany pointing the way. No squeamishness in the mobilization\r\neither--the possession of the vote was enough. Soon, very soon, strange,\r\ndisturbing things would be seen even in New England--cabinetmakers,\r\nshoemakers, mechanics perking up on politics, with evidence of\r\norganization here and there. Federalist leaders would soon be\r\ncomplaining that organization was conspiracy against the ‘government.’\r\nIn New Hampshire they would be calling those uniting for political\r\naction ‘insurgents.’ The insolence of the Jeffersonians appealing to the\r\npeople for support would be frowned upon as degrading. ‘Of course,’ said\r\na Massachusetts paper, ‘there can be but two parties in a country--the\r\nfriends of order and its foes.’[575]\r\n\r\nAnd such people! The very riff-raff that one would never invite into\r\none’s parlor--‘desperate, embarrassed, unprincipled, disorderly,\r\nambitious, disaffected, morose men.’[576] Were not these the\r\npropertyless who wasted their earnings in a grogshop?[577] And who were\r\nthese petty agitators? Who but ‘Jacobins’ holding forth ‘in the\r\nbar-rooms of Rhode Island and Vermont and trying to stir up\r\nopposition.’[578] Wretched offal after all--but what a pity that\r\nJefferson should countenance, least of all cultivate, such people. ‘Mr.\r\nJefferson appears to have shown rather too much of a disposition to\r\ncultivate vulgar prejudices,’ wrote Wolcott, and ‘accordingly he will\r\nbecome popular in the ale-houses.’[579]\r\n\r\nMiserable ‘Jacobins!’ Disreputable clowns of the bar-rooms! And such\r\nunthinkable methods! Here--there--everywhere, when a few men could be\r\ngathered together, some one appeared to deliver free lectures on\r\npractical politics. And such subjects! ‘Discipline’; ‘How to Make Men\r\nFollow their File Leaders.’[580]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn arousing and consolidating the widely scattered democrats, Jefferson\r\ninstantly appreciated the importance of a national newspaper to the end\r\nthat the farmer in Georgia, the planter in Virginia, the frontiersman in\r\nwestern Pennsylvania, the mechanic in Boston, the shopmen of Rhode\r\nIsland, and the reds of Tammany sipping their ale in the New York\r\ntavern, might all talk the same language at the same time. True, the\r\nJeffersonians were not without able editorial support. There was Thomas\r\nGreenleaf pounding away vigorously in the ‘New York Journal’; Thomas\r\nAdams hammering merrily in the Boston ‘Independent Chronicle’; and in\r\nPhiladelphia, Benjamin Franklin Bache was making a mild show of\r\nopposition in his ‘Pennsylvania Daily Advertiser.’ But these were\r\nindependent supporters, not ‘organs,’ and it was an ‘organ’ that was\r\nneeded--something to meet the Hamilton organ which was becoming\r\nincreasingly offensive to the democrats.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the sincerity of the simulated shock of the Federalists\r\nwhen the Secretary of State encouraged the establishment of a paper to\r\nsupport his principles, it is well to bear in mind that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury had done precisely the same thing two years before.\r\nThen, as always, politicians were shocked at the turpitude of their\r\nopponents. Just how John Fenno came to establish the ‘Gazette of the\r\nUnited States’ is an impenetrable mystery. He was in his thirty-eighth\r\nyear when he appeared at the home of Rufus King, perhaps the ablest of\r\nHamilton’s supporters, with a letter of introduction from Christopher\r\nGore, a member of the inner council of Boston Federalism who afterward\r\nwaxed wealthy on speculation in the funds. The record is meager as to\r\nFenno’s previous career beyond the revelation that he was born in Boston\r\nand taught for several years in the Old South Writing School. In the\r\nletter to King, we have the assurance of Gore that Fenno’s ‘literary\r\naccomplishments are very handsome’; that Gore had known him long and\r\ncould testify that ‘his honor and fidelity are unquestionable’; and,\r\nstrangely enough, that ‘his talents as the editor of a public paper are\r\nunrivaled in this commonwealth.’ As John Russell was then editing the\r\n‘Columbian Centinel,’ the tribute would seem strained but for the\r\nintimation that the strength and sparkle of that able journal was due to\r\nFenno’s contributions; and since the ‘Centinel’ suffered no apparent\r\nloss on his leaving Boston, even this theory seems absurd.\r\n\r\nIf his origin is a mystery, the purpose of his call on King was made\r\nclear enough in the letter of introduction. The ‘unrivaled’ editor\r\nsought encouragement for the establishment of a newspaper through\r\narrangements for ‘obtaining the patronage of Congress’ in the printing\r\nof its journals and official papers. If something of the sort could be\r\narranged, Gore was positive that Fenno would prove ‘capable of\r\nperforming essential service in the cause of Federalism and good\r\ngovernment.’[581]\r\n\r\nThe conversation was evidently agreeable, assurances of some sort were\r\nmanifestly given, and within a few weeks the ‘Gazette of the United\r\nStates’ was making its appearance. That Hamilton, who was intimately\r\nidentified with King, was consulted, we may he sure; and within four\r\nyears the relations between Fenno and Hamilton were so confidential that\r\nthe former felt no hesitancy in appealing in a letter to the latter for\r\na loan of two thousand dollars. Months before, the editor had submitted\r\na schedule of his debts and credits to the head of the Treasury. The\r\ntwo had talked over the financial difficulties of the paper. The appeal\r\nfor the loan was not lightly brushed aside. Hamilton wrote to King of\r\nthe troubles of ‘poor Fenno,’ and proposed that if King would raise a\r\nthousand dollars in New York, he would himself undertake to raise a\r\nsimilar amount in Philadelphia. It is to be assumed that the money was\r\nraised, for the paper continued to appear. It is significant that in his\r\nletter to Hamilton, the editor wrote as one who had rendered faithful\r\nservice and was entitled to consideration.[582]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Fenno had liked to think of himself as the editor of\r\n‘the court journal.’ Possessing considerable merit, it is impossible to\r\nturn its yellowing pages even now without being oppressed with a sense\r\nof sycophancy and snobbery. There was a fawning on wealth and kow-towing\r\nto power in most of the leading articles. The tone was pronouncedly\r\npro-English and all Hamiltonian. Democracy was anathema. The critics of\r\nthe policies of the leader of the Federalists were inciters to disorder.\r\nAll the influence of the Federalist leaders was exerted to throw all\r\npossible governmental patronage into his office.\r\n\r\nHamilton had his paper before Jefferson got his own.[583] It was to meet\r\nthese conditions that James Madison and Governor Henry Lee conceived the\r\nnotion of persuading Philip Freneau, ‘the poet of the Revolution,’ to\r\nestablish a newspaper in Philadelphia. This fiery petrel of democracy\r\nwas eking out a mere existence on a New York newspaper when Madison, who\r\nhad been his roommate at Princeton, made the proposal. This was due in\r\npart to personal affection and the feeling that the poet’s sufferings\r\nand losses in the Revolution entitled him to some consideration, but in\r\nlarge measure to the purity of his republicanism and his zeal for the\r\npopular cause. ‘I entertained hopes,’ wrote Madison later, ‘that a free\r\npaper, meant for general circulation, and edited by a man of genius of\r\nrepublican principles and a friend of the Constitution, would be some\r\nantidote to the doctrines and discourses circulated in favor of Monarchy\r\nand Aristocracy.’[584] With the view to giving some slight protection to\r\na precarious enterprise, Madison sought a clerkship for his college\r\nfriend in one of the governmental departments. Nor was it to Jefferson\r\nthat he first applied.[585] The outcome, however, was the offer of a\r\nclerkship of foreign languages in the State Department at a salary of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars a year. He accepted, went to Philadelphia,\r\nand established the ‘Federal’ or ‘National Gazette.’\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the new party were plainly pleased with the prospect.\r\nJefferson himself did not scruple to solicit subscribers among his\r\nVirginia neighbors. Henry Lee, who was to desert to the enemy later,\r\nsent in subscriptions through Madison, in a letter rejoicing because the\r\npaper ‘is rising fast into reputation,’ and lamenting because of the\r\nprecariousness of its arrival.[586] ‘His paper in the opinion here,’\r\nwrote Madison acknowledging Lee’s letter, ‘justifies the expectations of\r\nhis friends, and merits the diffusive circulation they have endeavored\r\nto procure it.’[587]\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphians awoke with a start to find that an entirely new note\r\nhad been struck in political journalism. Within a few weeks, the\r\n‘Federal Gazette’ was being extensively copied in the papers over the\r\ncountry. Bache in his ‘Advertiser’ caught something of Freneau’s fire\r\nand audacity, and began to take a firmer, bolder tone. Fenno found\r\nhimself forced to defend himself and his friends in almost every issue.\r\nMen and even women scanned its columns eagerly and with emotions\r\ndetermined by their political prepossessions. Within a few months the\r\npoet-editor was being hotly debated by the two leading papers of Boston.\r\n‘As all the friends of civil liberty wish at all times to be acquainted\r\nwith every question which appears to regard the public weal,’ said the\r\n‘Independent Chronicle,’ ‘a great number of gentlemen in this and\r\nneighboring towns have subscribed for the Federal Gazette published by\r\nMr. Philip Freneau at Philadelphia; and it is hoped that Freneau’s\r\nGazette, which is said to be printed under the eye of that established\r\npatriot, Thomas Jefferson, will be generally taken in the New England\r\nStates.’[588] What! wrote a correspondent in the ‘Centinel,’ is this an\r\navowal that Jefferson is the real editor? A paper hostile to religion\r\nand government! ‘Surely T. Adams ought to be well founded in his\r\naffections before he brings forward Mr. Jefferson as the patron of such\r\na Gazette.’[589]\r\n\r\nWithin a short time Freneau had aroused the savage rage of the\r\nFederalist leaders and the zealous loyalty of the democrats everywhere.\r\nHere was a man who was not awed by power, and, brushing aside mild\r\ncriticism and vapory innuendoes, struck hard and mentioned names. Soon\r\nthe Jeffersonian farmers in Georgia were talking what he was writing,\r\nand Jeffersonian editors generally were following his lead. In the\r\nbar-rooms of Rhode Island men of no consequence were reading the paper\r\naloud over their mugs, and David Rittenhouse in the library of the\r\nPhilosophical Society was chuckling over its vicious thrusts. Just then\r\n‘friends of the Constitution’ among the Federalists began to regret a\r\ncertain provision in the Bill of Rights and to begin the slow incubation\r\nof the Sedition Law. That incomparable political preacher, Timothy\r\nDwight, began to denounce papers as the ‘vice’ of the people in the new\r\nsettlements, and another pious gentleman of the cloth thundered from the\r\npulpit: ‘Many of you in spite of all the advice and friendly warnings of\r\nyour religious and political fathers have taken and continue to take and\r\nread Jacobin papers, full of all manner of mischief and subtlety of the\r\nDevil.’[590] The hand-to-hand fighting of Hamilton and Jefferson was\r\nforced by the lusty blows of Freneau, who deserves to be something more\r\nthan a name in the Plutarchian struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPhilip Freneau had richly earned the right to hold and express opinions\r\nconcerning the destiny of his country. Many years before the Revolution,\r\nhis Huguenot ancestors had come over from France, and for years his was\r\na well-known name in the best circles of New York City where he was\r\nborn. His childhood had been passed on the thousand-acre estate of his\r\nfather near the battle-field of Monmouth, in a fine old mansion\r\nfashioned after the colonial style, with a great hall running through\r\nit, and large porticoes commanding a view of a beautiful country. The\r\nhouse was served by many domestic slaves. Near by rose Beacon Hill,\r\nthickly timbered, and from the peak could be seen the lower bay and the\r\nblue waters of the Atlantic. There his early childhood was passed under\r\nthe tender care and training of a mother of rare intelligence. From her\r\nhe caught a love of poetry, and of the things of which poetry is made.\r\nThe spirit of his liberty-loving ancestors was strong within him. He had\r\nall the impulsiveness, the fighting courage of the Gael. When not at his\r\nstudies, he wandered alone into the woods and upon the hill where he\r\ncould brood dreamily upon the mystery of the sea. On the site where the\r\nbattle of Monmouth was to be fought, he began the study of Greek and\r\nLatin in his tenth year. Even as a child he had a hot passionate hatred\r\nof oppression, an unfathomable contempt for hypocrisy, and an ardent\r\nlove of beauty. All this he put into childish verse.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered Princeton (Nassau Hall), great events were beginning to\r\nunfold. The patriots of Massachusetts, protesting against an English\r\nlaw, had been declared rebels, the leading offenders had been ordered\r\nacross the sea for trial, the troops of General Gates had marched into\r\nBoston. The college was a hot-bed of sedition. That superb patriot, John\r\nWitherspoon, was president, and among the students who gathered in the\r\nevening in the room that Freneau shared with Madison, were ‘Light Horse’\r\nHarry Lee, Aaron Burr, William Bradford, destined to close an\r\nexceptionally promising career as a member of Washington’s Cabinet, and\r\nBrockholst Livingston.\r\n\r\nNothing that Freneau ever said or did in after-life that was not\r\nforeshadowed at Princeton can be found. His tongue was sharp, and his\r\npen dripped the vitriol of satire. He wrote much verse, and long before\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, he had a hatred of kings. Even thus\r\nearly in his ‘Pyramid of Kings,’ he made profession of his democracy.\r\n\r\n    ‘Millions of slaves beneath their labors fainted,\r\n     Who were here doomed to toil incessantly,\r\n     And years elapsed while groaning myriads strove\r\n     To raise this mighty tomb--and but to hide\r\n     The worthless bones of an Egyptian king.’\r\n\r\nUnder the encouragement of Witherspoon, all the patriotic fire within\r\nhim burst into flame.\r\n\r\nLong before Washington, Adams, or Franklin were dreaming of a republic\r\nand absolute independence, this was his dream. During the time he was\r\nsupposed to be poring over Coke and Blackstone, he was feverishly plying\r\nhis pen writing political articles for the press. He was a rebel by\r\nnature. He wrote deliberately to arouse a burning hatred of tyranny and\r\na militant love of liberty. He sang the songs of hate, and read and\r\nstudied the Roman and French satirists to perfect himself in the art he\r\nwas to use so effectively later. When the war began he threw himself\r\ninto the struggle. A pathetic little figure, this--a mere wisp of a boy\r\ncharging on ahead to smash the connection with England, only to find\r\nthat the other patriots had no such thought. They were fighting for\r\nrights within the empire, not for independence. Even then he was too\r\nradical for his times or the comfort of his associates. They were\r\nthinking of rights, and he of liberty--and in sheer disgust he sailed\r\naway to Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThere was the illusion of liberty on the sea and there was beauty and\r\npoetry, and there was opportunity, too, to prepare himself for the part\r\nhe was to play a little later. It was always his joy to be prepared. On\r\nthat voyage he perfected himself in the science of navigation. In the\r\nlanguorous air of Santa Cruz he luxuriated in the beauties of nature at\r\nits richest, and sought to transcribe to paper all he saw and felt. He\r\nhad an irresistible impulse for creation--a poet’s passion for\r\nexpression.[591] But even here he was a rebel born to protest. Slavery\r\nat its worst was all about him--and he hit it hard in his descriptions.\r\n\r\nIt was while a guest of the Governor of Bermuda, writing love sonnets to\r\nthe fair daughter of his host, that the news came of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. This was the sort of rebellion Freneau could understand,\r\nand he hurried home to find that a battle had been fought at his very\r\ndoor, and that the cushions of the Tennant church he had attended had\r\nbeen stained with blood. Instantly he took out letters of marque and\r\nreprisal from the Continental Congress, and put to sea to battle with\r\nthe British ships. Plunging patriotically with all his means he had a\r\nship built for his own use, named it the _Aurora_, and sought the enemy.\r\nIn a battle his ship was struck, and it was as a prisoner on the deck of\r\nan enemy vessel that he saw his ship, his fortune, sink beneath the\r\nwaves. The rest was torture and a living death. The Scorpion on which he\r\nwas confined was a miserable old hulk converted into a prison ship,\r\nreeking with foul smells and rank disease, and into this he was packed\r\nwhere the accommodations were not fit for swine. One by one he saw his\r\nfellows perish from disease and neglect, listened in the night to their\r\nshrieks of pain and dying groans. When verging on death, he was\r\ntransferred to the _Hunter_ which some sardonic soul had dubbed a\r\n‘Hospital Prison Ship.’ Its horrors have come down to us in his own\r\npoems with its bitter execration of the Hessian doctor.\r\n\r\n    ‘Here uncontrolled he exercised his trade,\r\n     And grew experienced by the deaths he made;\r\n     By frequent blows we from his cane endured\r\n     He killed at least as many as he cured.’\r\n\r\nAt length he was exchanged. Leaving the vessel with a raging fever, with\r\npains in his joints that made walking a torture, he turned toward home,\r\ngoing through the woods ‘for fear of terrifying the neighbors with [his]\r\nghastly looks.’[592] This was the background against which he was to\r\nview Washington’s policy of neutrality in the war between France and\r\nEngland. He hated England from that hour to his death.\r\n\r\nBroken in health almost beyond hope of redemption, his ship sunk, his\r\nmoney gone, the war still on, he turned to his other weapon and took up\r\nthe pen. ‘The Prison Ship’ helped to fire the patriots shivering about\r\nthe cold camps. The poem of contemptuous imprecation, in imitation of\r\nHorace, on the treason of Arnold, fanned their wrath. That on the\r\nvictory of Paul Jones heartened the downcast. Poem followed poem, copied\r\nthroughout the country, many published on strips of paper and\r\ndistributed through the army. Some were posted in conspicuous places\r\nwhere they could be committed to memory. Paine wrote ‘The Crisis’ in\r\nprose, Freneau wrote of the crisis in verse; both were a tonic for the\r\nwavering. Even Washington did not then speak of him as ‘that rascal\r\nFreneau’ and that characterization even from Washington cannot rob him\r\nof the glory of having been ‘the Poet of the Revolution’ who gave his\r\nhealth, his entire fortune, almost his life, and all his heart to the\r\ncause of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe close of the war found him in New York barely existing on crumbs\r\nfrom the table of an editor. His was a familiar figure in the\r\nMerchants’ Coffee-House at Wall and Water Streets where leading men\r\ncongregated. The problem then was to get the necessities of life, and\r\nliterary work was not then included among the means. This was the\r\ncondition in which Madison found him. He knew the story of his poet\r\nfriend, and thus it came about that the plan was made for the ‘Federal\r\nGazette.’ He was ideally fitted for the task. It called for one who\r\ncould write in the language of the people, could wield a scorpion lash,\r\nwhose heart was in the cause--and no greater master of invective was in\r\nview, no keener satirist. He required no tutoring, and he would accept\r\nno orders. He was a rebel still, a radical, a crusader for democracy,\r\nwho looked with amusement on ‘aristocracy,’ with hatred on monarchy. He\r\nwas an original thinker, a breaker of idols, an iconoclastic genius. He\r\nhad the wit, the keenness, the quickness, the felicity of his French\r\nblood, the stern firmness of the Huguenot mind. He was a gusty warrior\r\nwith a lusty blade and he kept it shining in the sun.\r\n\r\nSoon Philadelphia found him a familiar figure in its streets--a rather\r\nlittle man with slightly stooped shoulders, thin yet muscular, who\r\nwalked briskly like one who knew where he was going. In his office at\r\nhis work he was more imposing, for there one could note the high\r\nintellectual brow, the dark gray deep-set eyes that sometimes blazed\r\nunder the slightly drooping lids. Usually pensive in repose, his face\r\nlighted with animation when he talked. His manners were courteous and\r\nrefined and women found him interesting and gallant. Nor was this\r\ndemocrat a Marat in dress--he wore the small-clothes, the long hose, the\r\nbuckled shoes, and cocked hat, long after others had accepted less\r\npicturesque fashions. He had no vanity, no ambition for place or power,\r\nand no fear of either. He wore no man’s collar and he was no man’s man.\r\nHe was a law unto himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GAGE OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere was little in the reception of Hamilton’s famous ‘Report on\r\nManufactures’ during the congressional session of 1791-92 to foreshadow\r\nthe part it was to play in American politics. Bristling with facts and\r\nfigures laboriously assembled, the plea for protection and bounties for\r\nmanufacturers was plausibly presented. Foreseeing the hostility of the\r\nfarmers, the most persuasive arguments were reserved for them. The\r\ndiversification of industry would increase the demand for the products\r\nof the farm; the elimination of foreign competition would decrease the\r\ncost of manufactured goods; and the certainty of immigration would\r\nprevent any labor shortage with agriculturists. Better still, the\r\nfactories would afford the farmers an opportunity to put their wives and\r\nchildren to work in the mills.[593] Four sevenths of the employees of\r\nthe cotton mills of England were women and children, and many of the\r\nlatter of ‘tender age.’[594] In the making of nails and spikes young\r\nboys were able to do the work.[595] As to the constitutional objection,\r\nthat was disposed of by the doctrine of implied powers.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, including Freneau’s, ran the report in full, but nothing\r\ncame of it for the moment. No one was shocked at the idea of working\r\nwomen and children of tender age. After a while a writer in Freneau’s\r\npaper warned that a new field was being opened ‘for favoritism,\r\ninfluence and monopoly.’[596] Madison wrote to Pendleton that ‘if\r\nCongress can do whatever in their discretion can be done with money ...\r\nthe Government is no longer a limited one.’[597] But this ‘Report’\r\nresulted in less controversy than any that had preceded. There was no\r\nstorm--just a bare stirring of the leaves.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was not content to allude to brighter worlds--he led the\r\nway. Long before, he had been impressed with the industrial\r\npossibilities of beautiful Passaic Falls in New Jersey, midway between\r\nNew York and Newark at the very door of the market. Just how long he was\r\nin interesting moneyed men in his ambitious plans for a great national\r\nmanufactory there, we do not know. But even before the publication of\r\nhis ‘Report,’ he had personally appeared with others interested before\r\nthe New Jersey Legislature to ‘elucidate anything that may appear\r\nobtuse’ in the request for a charter.[598] It was only a little trip\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Trenton. Then, one summer day, a group of men\r\nappeared at the Falls to purchase land and select the precise sites for\r\nthe various mills, and the small but masterful figure of Hamilton was\r\nthe center of the group. All sorts of things would be manufactured,\r\ncotton mills predominating, and it would become--this city of\r\nPaterson--the industrial capital of the Republic. Major l’Enfant was\r\nsummoned to the task of making this industrial beehive beautiful, and he\r\nresponded.[599] Soon there were grumblings among the farmers, outraged\r\nbecause the charter that Hamilton’s influence had secured gave the\r\ncompany the right to dig canals on any man’s land. The other\r\nmanufacturers were indignant because the new factory was to be free from\r\ntaxation for ten years, and its employees were to be excused from\r\nmilitary services except in cases of dire necessity. ‘A Manufacturer’\r\nwrote a vehement protest, mentioning Hamilton by name, and denouncing\r\nthe act of the legislature as vicious beyond comparison.[600] Soon the\r\nPhiladelphia papers were advertising that the five letters ‘To the\r\nYeomanry,’ in pamphlet form, complaining of the privileged nature of the\r\ncorporation and of the part played by Hamilton, could be had at the\r\nvarious stores of the city.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was not concerned with the grumblings of the groundlings,\r\nfor he was at high tide. In New York men had subscribed for a portrait\r\nof him by Trumbull, and the subscription lists ‘were still open in the\r\ncoffee-house.’[601] He had become the idol of the most powerful class. A\r\nlittle later, Trumbull’s work completed, ‘the best that ever came from\r\nhis pencil,’ it was placed temporarily in the old city hall in New\r\nYork.[602] The obscure boy from the West Indies had become an\r\ninstitution in the city of his adoption. Even so Hamilton was ever\r\nvigilant. He had not liked the Freneau project from the start, and he\r\nwas watching it like a hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen the poet-journalist took an office on High Street and began the\r\npublication of his paper, there was little to justify grave\r\napprehensions. In his first issues the editor had pledged himself to the\r\nsupport ‘of the great principles on which the American Revolution was\r\nfounded,’ and while this smacked of the jabberings of Sam Adams,\r\nHancock, and Jefferson, it was probably only a gesture. The tone of the\r\nearly editions was temperate, almost academic. The ordinary reader must\r\nhave thought it harmless enough, but Hamilton, who used the press\r\neffectively himself, examined the articles more critically. There were\r\nphrases creeping in, innocently, perhaps, that Fenno would have scorned.\r\nThe idea that ‘public opinion sets the bounds to every government, and\r\nis the real sovereign of every free one,’[603] would never have soiled\r\nthe pages of the ‘Gazette of the United States.’ The little essays on\r\npolitics and government were sprinkled all too freely with these\r\ndisturbing suggestions. Only an essay on ‘Nobility’--but why make it the\r\nvehicle for the thought that ‘the downfall of nobility in France has\r\noperated like an early frost toward killing the germ of it in\r\nAmerica.’[604] With Fenno chiding the critics of officials, what more\r\nunfortunate than Freneau’s assertion that ‘perpetual jealousy of the\r\ngovernment’ is alone effectual ‘against the machinations of ambition,’\r\nand his warning that ‘where that jealousy does not exist in a reasonable\r\ndegree the saddle is soon prepared for the back of the people.’[605] A\r\ndefense of parties coupled with a denunciation of privilege,[606] stiff\r\ncriticism of ministerial inefficiency apropos of the St. Clair\r\nexpedition; forceful protests against the excise law;[607] and then an\r\narticle by ‘Brutus’ on the funding system which could not be\r\nignored--these were bad enough. That system, said ‘Brutus,’ had given\r\nundue weight to the Treasury Department ‘by throwing the enormous sum of\r\nfifty million dollars into the hands of the wealthy,’ thus attaching\r\nthem to all the Treasury measures ‘by motives of private interest.’\r\nHaving combined the great moneyed interest, it had been made formidable\r\nby the Bank monopoly. Out of it all had come the ‘unlimited excise laws\r\nand imposts’ that ‘anticipated the best resources of the country and\r\nswallowed them all up in future payments.’ Because the certificates had\r\nfallen to the wealthy, ‘the industrious mechanic, the laborious farmer\r\nand poorer classes generally are made tributary to the latest\r\ngeneration.’[608] Rights of property? Yes--but there is property in\r\nrights.[609] Be loyal to the Union? Yes, but who are the enemies of the\r\nUnion? ‘Not those who favoring measures which, pampering the spirit of\r\nspeculation, disgust the best friends of the Union.’ ‘Not those who\r\npromote unnecessary accumulations of the debts of the Union.’ Not those\r\n‘who study by arbitrary interpretations and insidious precedents to\r\npervert the limited government of the Union into a government of\r\nunlimited discretion.’[610]\r\n\r\nWith Freneau hitting his stride, the Federalists began to lose their\r\npatience. Soon the ‘United States Chronicle’ of Providence learned that\r\nthe ‘very extraordinary productions’ were probably ‘the work of some\r\nforeigners who wish to reduce the funds in order to purchase.’[611] The\r\n‘Centinel’ of Boston warned that Freneau’s paper was ‘supported by a\r\njunto for electioneering purposes’ and was filled with ‘the most absurd\r\nmisrepresentations of facts, or falsehoods highly injurious to the\r\nprevailing character and principles of our government and people.’[612]\r\n\r\nBut it took the articles of ‘Sidney’ to force the fighting. These were\r\nopen attacks on Hamilton and his principles and were written with a\r\npunch. He assailed the House for abdicating its power to originate money\r\nbills to the Secretary of the Treasury. To delegate that duty was to lie\r\ndown on a job. And such ‘reports’! Arguments! Pleas! Sophistries! Thence\r\nto the major attack. ‘If we admit that the Secretary is a fallible\r\nmortal, and, however great his capacity may be, that he is liable to\r\nmistakes or to be imposed upon, or, in range of hypothesis, if we\r\nsuppose these possible cases, that his political principles do not\r\ncorrespond with the genius of the government, or with public opinion;\r\nor that he embraces the interests of one class in preference to the\r\ninterests of the other classes,--I say admitting any or all of these\r\ncircumstances to be possible, then the ministerial mode of influencing\r\nthe deliberations of Congress practiced since the change of the\r\ngovernment, is more dangerous than even that which is pursued but loudly\r\ncomplained of in Britain.’[613] These attacks by Sidney continued with\r\npainful regularity, and Freneau’s paper became a scandal in the\r\nbest-regulated families in Philadelphia. Others joined in the fray. ‘A\r\nCitizen’ from a remote section, who had visited the capital to ‘know\r\nmore of men and measures,’ speedily convinced himself that many members\r\nof government ‘were ... partners with brokers and stock jobbers, and\r\nthat the banking schemes have been too powerfully and effectually\r\naddressed to their avarice.’[614] ‘Centinel’ warned that ‘the fate of\r\nthe excise law will determine whether the powers of government ... are\r\nheld by an aristocratic junto or by the people.’[615] With the pack in\r\nhot pursuit of his idol, Fenno rushed to the defense with a denunciation\r\nof the ‘mad dogs’ and ‘enemies of the government.’ ‘Ah,’ replied\r\nFreneau, welcoming the fight, ‘I will tell a short story that will put\r\nthe matter in a proper light. A pack of rogues once took possession of a\r\nchurch ... held in high veneration by the inhabitants of the surrounding\r\ndistrict. From the sanctuary they sallied out every night, robbed ...\r\nall the neighbors, and when pursued took shelter within the hallowed\r\nwalls. If any one attempted to molest them there, they deterred him from\r\nthe enterprise by crying, “Sacrilege,” and swearing they would denounce\r\nhim to the inquisition as a heretic and an enemy of the Holy Mother\r\nChurch.’[616] And Freneau persevered in his perversity. Right joyously\r\nhe returned to the scandal of speculation. ‘It is worthy of notice that\r\nno direct denial has ever appeared of the ... multiplied assertions that\r\nmembers of the general government have carried on jobs and speculations\r\nin their own measures even while those measures were depending.’[617]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAn interesting picture was presented the day after the appearance of\r\nthis attack: Emerging from the doorway of the Morris house was a\r\ndistinguished party. Washington himself, sober and stately, with his\r\nmatronly spouse; Hamilton, alert and suave, with little Betty; and a\r\ntall, loose-jointed man of pleasing aspect whom spectators instantly\r\nrecognized as Jefferson. Entering carriages they drove away to visit Mr.\r\nPearce’s cotton manufactory. No one knew better than Washington that a\r\ncrisis had been reached in the relations of his ministers. But a few\r\ndays before he had sat pondering over a letter from Jefferson. It dealt\r\nwith the reason for the growing distrust in government, the fiscal\r\npolicy of Hamilton, the disposition to pile up debt, the corruption in\r\nCongress--and it announced a determination to retire from the\r\nCabinet.[618] Washington, greatly distressed, had earnestly importuned\r\nhim to remain. He had agreed to stay on awhile, but the quarreling was\r\nbecoming intolerable.\r\n\r\nAt the factory the little party entered, pausing to examine the\r\nmachinery and comment upon it, Hamilton the irreproachable gentleman,\r\ncourteous, amusing, pleasant, Jefferson observing all the amenities of\r\nthe occasion. It was their last social meeting in small company. But if\r\nWashington, who had invited them, hoped thus to persuade them to drop\r\ntheir quarrel, he was foredoomed to disappointment. The cause of their\r\ndisagreement was elemental and eternal. They returned to the Morris\r\nhouse after a pleasant diversion--and the fight went on.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn early June, Fenno and Freneau were lashing each other with much\r\nshouting. But the editor of the Hamilton paper played constantly into\r\nthe hands of his opponent. He lamented the appearance of a ‘faction,’\r\nmeaning party, because factions mean convulsions under a republican\r\ngovernment. It would not be so serious if there were a king, because ‘a\r\nking at the head of a nation to whom all men of property cling with the\r\nconsciousness that all property will be set afloat with the government,\r\nis able to crush the first rising against the laws.’[619] There must\r\nhave been high glee among the cronies of Freneau in the office on High\r\nStreet when they read it. ‘King,’ ‘men of property’--Freneau could not\r\nhave dictated the comment for his purpose better. ‘Your paper is\r\nsupported by a party,’ charged Fenno. Yes, agreed Freneau, if ‘by a\r\nparty he means a very respectable number of anti-aristocratic, and\r\nanti-monarchical people of the United States.’[620] But, not to be\r\ndiverted, the poet-editor returned persistently to his indictment.\r\n‘Pernicious doctrines have been maintained’--‘Members of Congress deeply\r\nconcerned in speculating and jobbing in their own measures ... have\r\ncombined with brokers and others to gull and trick their uninformed\r\nconstituents out of their certificates.’[621]\r\n\r\n‘The names--give us the names,’ demanded Fenno. ‘That reminds us,’ said\r\nFreneau, ‘of the impudence of a noted prostitute of London, who, having\r\na difference with a young man, was by him reproached for her profligacy,\r\nand called by the plain name of her profession.... “I’ll make you prove\r\nit or pay for it,” said she. Accordingly, she sued the young man for\r\ndefamation of character, and although half the town knew her character,\r\nyet nobody could prove her incontinency without owning himself an\r\naccomplice, and the defendant was lost for want of evidence and obliged\r\nto pay heavy damages. Thus it is when any man talks of\r\nspeculators--“prove the fact, sir”--as if, indeed, the men who hired out\r\nthe pilot boats and the brokers who negotiated the securities would come\r\nforward to expose their employers and themselves.’[622]\r\n\r\nThus with charge on charge, with sarcasm and satire, especially the\r\nlatter, Freneau constantly increased the intensity of his assaults.\r\nThese slashing and insidious attacks did not reach the citizens of\r\nPhiladelphia only--they were copied far and wide. The paper itself went\r\ninto every State. Men were discussing and quoting it on the streets, in\r\nthe coffee-houses of New York, on the stage-coaches jolting between the\r\nscarcely broken forests of remote places, about the fireplace in the\r\ncabin in the woods. No one had followed it with greater rage than\r\nAlexander Hamilton. One day Fenno’s ‘Gazette’ contained a short letter\r\nbearing the signature ‘T. L.,’ which started the tongues to wagging all\r\nthe way from O’Eller’s grogshop to Mrs. Bingham’s drawing-room.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Fenno: The editor of the National Gazette receives a salary\r\n     from the Government. QUERE--Whether this salary is paid him for\r\n     translations, or for publications, the design of which is to vilify\r\n     those to whom the voice of the people has committed the\r\n     administration of our public affairs--to oppose the measures of\r\n     government, and by false insinuations to disturb the public peace?\r\n\r\n     In common life it is thought ungrateful to bite the hand that puts\r\n     bread in its mouth; but if a man is hired to do it, the case is\r\n     different.\r\n\r\nFreneau’s paper had become dangerous, Fenno was unable to meet its\r\nonslaughts, and thus, anonymously, Hamilton took up his pen.[623]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Hamilton first shocked his friends with the\r\ndisclosure of his temperamental weakness that was to destroy his\r\nleadership. Persuaded that Freneau’s journal was established for the\r\nprimary purpose of wrecking him, he saw red, lost his customary poise\r\nand self-control, and, throwing discretion to the winds along with his\r\ndignity as a minister of State, he entered the lists as an anonymous\r\nletter-writer. We search in vain through the correspondence of his\r\nfriends for evidence of approval.\r\n\r\nThe attack was met by Freneau with a certain dignity. Reproducing the\r\n‘T. L.’ letter he wrote:\r\n\r\n     The above is beneath reply. It might be queried, however, whether a\r\n     man who receives a small stipend for services rendered as French\r\n     translator to the Department of State, and as editor of a free\r\n     newspaper admits into his publication impartial strictures on the\r\n     proceedings of government, is not more likely to act an honest and\r\n     disinterested part toward the public, than a vile sycophant, who\r\n     obtaining emoluments from government, far more lucrative than the\r\n     salary alluded to, finds his interest in attempting to poison the\r\n     minds of the people by propaganda and by disseminating principles\r\n     and sentiments utterly subversive of the true republican interests\r\n     of the country, and by flattering and recommending every and any\r\n     measures of government however pernicious and destructive its\r\n     tendency might be to the great body of the people. The world is\r\n     left to decide the motive of each.[624]\r\n\r\nThis controversy of mere journalists did not interest Hamilton. He was\r\nout gunning for bigger game. Thoroughly convinced that Jefferson was\r\nresponsible for much of the contents of Freneau’s paper, he hoped to\r\ndraw his colleague into an open newspaper fight and, if possible, drive\r\nhim from the Cabinet. The relations of the two Titans had been growing\r\nmore and more hostile. They disputed across the table in the council\r\nroom, and at rare times seemed at the point of blows. Hamilton knew\r\nJefferson’s opinions of his policies--and similar opinions were\r\nappearing in the paper edited by a clerk in his rival’s office. Nor were\r\nthey slovenly, superficial articles. They were the work of close\r\nobservers and clever controversialists. Not only was he ignorant of the\r\nfact that many of these were the work of Madison, that Brackenridge\r\nwrote some, George Tucker, editor of the American edition of Blackstone,\r\nsome,[625] but he ridiculously underestimated the capacity of Freneau.\r\nThese articles were strong, stinging, effective, and therefore Jefferson\r\nwrote or dictated them. He would drag Jefferson into the arena and have\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nThus, in his letter of August 4, he contemptuously dismissed the editor\r\nas ‘the faithful and devoted servant of the head of a party,’ and\r\nlaunched his personal bitter attack on Jefferson. If he wished to attack\r\n‘the Government,’ why didn’t Jefferson resign?[626] ‘Can he reconcile it\r\nto his own personal dignity, and the principles of probity, to hold an\r\noffice under it, and employ the means of official influence in that\r\nopposition?’ Besides, he was an enemy of the Constitution. He had been\r\nopposed to it and had written his objections ‘to some of his friends in\r\nVirginia.’[627] Four days later, Freneau denied in an affidavit\r\npublished in Fenno’s paper that Jefferson had any connection with the\r\n‘National Gazette’ or had written or dictated a line. The same day, in\r\nhis own paper, he raised the curtain on Hamilton’s _nom de plume_, with\r\na comment that ‘all is not right with certain lofty-minded persons who\r\nfondly imagined their ambitious career was to proceed without check or\r\ninterruption to the summit of their wishes.’ To which he added that\r\n‘the devil rageth when his time is short.’[628] In his letter of August\r\n11th, Hamilton dismissed the denial unimpressively. At this moment he\r\nthought himself hot on the trail. Elias Boudinot, he recalled, had once\r\ntold him of the part Madison had played. If he could get an affidavit\r\nfrom Boudinot! Acting on an impulse, he wrote him that ‘a friend’ was\r\nwriting the attacks on Jefferson. He had mentioned the Boudinot\r\nconversation to that ‘friend’ who was anxious to have an affidavit. ‘It\r\nis of real importance that it should be done,’ he wrote. ‘It will\r\nconfound and put down a man who is continually machinating against the\r\npublic happiness.’[629] But Boudinot does not appear to have had any\r\nstomach for the mess, albeit he, like every one else, must have known\r\nthat the ‘friend’ was Hamilton himself. No affidavit was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWhile he was waiting vainly for the affidavit, an anonymous writer in\r\nFreneau’s paper, referring to Hamilton’s assaults, made a\r\ncounter-charge. What about ‘the immaculate Mr. Fenno’? Did he not have\r\nthe printing of the Senate, ‘the emoluments of which office are\r\nconsiderable?’ Did he not ‘enjoy exclusively the printing of the\r\nTreasury department where it seems he has rendered himself a particular\r\nfavorite?’ Was he not already ‘making his approaches to another office\r\non Chestnut Street [the Bank],’ and in a fair way to secure ‘if not\r\nalready in possession of the business appertaining thereto?’[630]\r\n\r\nOn August 18th, Hamilton appeared again to sneer at Freneau’s\r\nannouncement that he would pay no attention to the charges until the\r\nauthor came forward to make them in the open. ‘It was easily anticipated\r\nthat he might have good reasons for not discovering himself, at least at\r\nthe call of Mr. Freneau, and it was necessary for him to find shelter.’\r\n\r\nFreneau’s affidavit! scoffed a writer in Hamilton’s organ. He had no\r\nfaith in it. The editor had certainly not sworn upon the Bible. Had he\r\ntaken the oath on Jefferson’s ‘Notes on Virginia’?[631]\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was already discovered. No one there was in public life\r\nfrom Washington down who did not know the author. The amazing spectacle\r\nwas the talk of the taverns and the dinner tables, and was beginning to\r\nassume the proportions of a scandal. Washington was shocked and\r\naggrieved. He would stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOn August 26th he tried his art of conciliation, appealing to both\r\nHamilton and Jefferson, albeit, as he knew, the latter had not written a\r\nline. Both replied in September, Hamilton admitting the authorship of\r\nthe articles, and declared his inability ‘to recede now.’ He had been\r\nforced to write. He had been ‘the object of uniform opposition from Mr.\r\nJefferson’; ‘the object of unkind whispers and insinuations from the\r\nsame quarter’; and he had evidence that the ‘National Gazette’ had been\r\ninstituted by Jefferson ‘to render me and all the objects connected with\r\nmy administration odious.’ He had been most patient. In truth, he had\r\n‘prevented a very severe and systematic attack upon Mr. Jefferson by an\r\nassociation of two or three individuals, in consequence of the\r\npersecution he brought upon the Vice-President by his indiscreet and\r\nlight letter to the printer, transmitting Paine’s pamphlet.’[632]\r\n\r\nJefferson replied that in private conversation he had ‘utterly\r\ndisapproved’ of Hamilton’s system, which ‘flowed from principles adverse\r\nto liberty and calculated to undermine and demolish the Republic by\r\ncreating an influence of his department over members of the\r\nlegislature.’ He had seen this influence ‘actually produced’ by ‘the\r\nestablishment of the great outlines of his project by the votes of the\r\nvery persons who, having swallowed his bait, were laying themselves out\r\nto profit by his plans.’ Then, too, Hamilton had constantly interfered\r\nwith his department, particularly in relation to England and\r\nFrance.[633] As to Freneau, he hoped he ‘would give free place to pieces\r\nwritten against the aristocratic and monarchical principles.’ He and\r\nFenno, he said, ‘are rivals for the public favor. The one courts them by\r\nflattery, the other by censure, and I believe it will be admitted that\r\nthe one has been as servile as the other has been severe.’ Then, turning\r\nagain to Hamilton: ‘But is not the dignity and even decency of\r\ngovernment committed when one of its principal Ministers enlists himself\r\nas an anonymous writer or paragraphist for either the one or the other\r\nof them?’ As for criticism of governmental measures, ‘no government\r\nought to be without censors; and where the press is free no one ever\r\nwill. If virtuous, it need not fear the free operation of attack and\r\ndefense. Nature has given to man no other means of sifting out the\r\ntruth, either in religion, law, or politics. I think it is as honorable\r\nto government neither to know nor notice its sycophants, as it would be\r\nundignified and criminal to pamper the former and persecute the\r\nlatter.’[634]\r\n\r\nThus ended Washington’s attempt to intervene. Hamilton had refused to\r\ndiscontinue his attacks, and, within two days after replying to\r\nWashington’s appeal, he was again appearing in the ‘Gazette of the\r\nUnited States.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEven while Hamilton and Jefferson were writing their letters, the fight\r\nwas proceeding merrily, if bloodlessly, in the papers. ‘Aristides,’ none\r\nother than Madison, had gone to the defense of his leader in an article\r\nin Fenno’s paper on Jefferson’s attitude toward the Constitution. No one\r\nwas so well qualified to know, unless it was Washington himself. He had\r\nsat in the Convention, a leading figure, and listened to Hamilton’s\r\nspeeches and proposals, and had been in correspondence with Jefferson.\r\nIt was not this defense that made Fenno restive. It was a pointed\r\nattack. ‘It is said, Mr. Fenno, that a certain head of a department is\r\nthe real author or instigator of these unprovoked and unmanly attacks on\r\nMr. Jefferson--and that the time of that gentleman’s departure from the\r\ncity on a visit to his home was considered as best suited to answer the\r\ndesign it was intended to effect.’ ‘Unmanly attack’ and an insinuation\r\nof cowardice! Fenno took the precaution to add a note warning that no\r\nfurther letters would be printed containing ‘personal strictures’ unless\r\nthe name of the author was furnished ‘in case of emergency.’ Coffee and\r\npistols--was it coming to that?[635] Freneau had no such concern, for on\r\nthe same day a writer in his paper referred to the ‘base passions that\r\ntorment’ Hamilton, and called upon the author of the anonymous articles\r\nto ‘explain the public character who on an occasion well known to him,\r\ncould so far divest himself of gratitude and revolt from the spirit of\r\nhis station as to erect his little crest against the magnanimous chief\r\nwho is at the head of our civic establishment, and has on many free\r\noccasions since spoken with levity and depreciation of some of the\r\ngreatest qualities of that renowned character; and now gives himself out\r\nas if he were his most cordial friend and admirer, and most worthy of\r\npublic confidence on that account.’[636]\r\n\r\nTwo days after refusing Washington’s request for a cessation, Hamilton\r\nreturned to the attack in answer to the charge of the ‘National Gazette’\r\nthat he had not liked the Constitution, and had pronounced the British\r\nmonarchy the most perfect government. All this he stoutly denied. The\r\nrecords and debates of the Constitutional Convention were then under\r\nsecrecy, and members who had heard his speeches were under the ban of\r\nsilence. He felt safe. This is the most amazing letter of the series.\r\n\r\nAnd so the dismal affair dragged on. Another letter appeared reiterating\r\na connection between Jefferson and Freneau; another charging that\r\nJefferson was opposed to the Constitution and against paying the public\r\ndebt; still another complaining of Jefferson’s interference with the\r\nTreasury Department. Then another on Jefferson and the Constitution, and\r\nfinally, two months after Washington’s appeal, demanding that Jefferson,\r\nwho remained in the Cabinet on the earnest solicitation of Washington,\r\nwithdraw. ‘Let him not cling to the honor or emolument of an office,\r\nwhichever it may be that attracts him, and content himself with\r\ndefending the injured rights of the people by obscure or indirect\r\nmeans.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jefferson had refused to be drawn into the controversy\r\npersonally. The situation had become painful--the Philadelphia\r\ndrawing-rooms lifting their brows at him. His official associations were\r\nunpleasant, but he never touched pen to a paper intended for\r\npublication. Only in his personal letters did he pour forth his\r\nbitterness against his colleague. ‘The indecency of newspaper squabbling\r\nbetween two public Ministers,’ he wrote Edmund Randolph, ‘has drawn\r\nsomething like an injunction from another quarter. Every fact alleged\r\n... as to myself is false.... But for the present lying and scribbling\r\nmust be free to those who are mean enough to deal in them and in the\r\ndark.’[637] He had hoped for an early retirement, and the attacks had\r\nindefinitely postponed the realization of his desire. ‘These\r\nrepresentations have for some weeks past shaken a determination which I\r\nhad thought the whole world could not have shaken,’ he wrote\r\nMartha.[638] Meanwhile, the small-fry partisans were busy in all the\r\npapers. The effect, on the whole, had been favorable to Jefferson,\r\nmaking him the idol of the democrats everywhere. ‘It gives us great\r\npleasure,’ said a Boston paper, ‘to find that the patriotic Jefferson\r\nhas become the object of censure, as it will have a happy tendency to\r\nopen the eyes of the people to the strides of certain men who are\r\nwilling to turn every staunch Republican out of office who has\r\ndiscerning to ken the arbitrary measures, and is honestly sufficient to\r\nreveal them.’[639] To the ‘Independent Chronicle’ the ‘slander and\r\ndetraction’ of men like Jefferson seemed ‘a convincing proof of the\r\nbadness of the cause behind it.’[640] The onslaught had in no wise\r\nweakened Jefferson’s faith in the effectiveness of the ‘National\r\nGazette.’ The smoke had not lifted from the field when he was rejoicing\r\nbecause it was ‘getting into Massachusetts under the patronage of\r\nHancock and Sam Adams.’[641] Even Freneau found the democrats rallying\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n     It is a Fact [wrote a correspondent] that immense wealth has been\r\n     accumulated into a few hands, and that public measures have favored\r\n     that accumulation.\r\n\r\n     It is a Fact that money appropriated to the sinking of the debt has\r\n     been laid out, not so as most to sink the debt, but so as to succor\r\n     gamblers in the funds.\r\n\r\n     It is a Fact that a Bank law has given a bounty of from four to\r\n     five million dollars to men in great part of the same description.\r\n\r\n     It is a Fact that a share of this bounty went immediately into the\r\n     pockets of the very men most active and forward in granting it.\r\n\r\n     These, Mr. Freneau, are facts--...severe, stubborn, notorious\r\n     facts.[642]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThus Hamilton’s remarkable attack had only whetted the appetite of the\r\nJeffersonians for battle--and a national campaign was in progress. The\r\nunanimous reëlection of Washington was universally demanded, but why\r\nshould the ‘aristocratic’ and ‘monarchical’ author of ‘The Discourses of\r\nDavilla’ be chosen again? At any rate, efforts could be made to change\r\nthe political complexion of Congress.\r\n\r\nThere were mistakes, blunders, tragedies, that could be used to affect\r\npublic opinion. What more shocking than the humiliating collapse of the\r\nGeneral St. Clair expedition against the Indians in the western country?\r\nGayly enough had the unfortunate commander set forth with twenty-three\r\nhundred regular troops and a host of militiamen. There had been a\r\nscarcity of provisions and inadequate preparations. Hundreds of\r\nsoldiers, consumed with fever, shaken with chills, had vainly called for\r\nmedicine. Many died, hundreds deserted in disgust, and finally but\r\nfourteen hundred worn and weary, sick and hungry men remained to face\r\nthe enemy. It was easy enough to blame St. Clair, and, as he passed\r\nthrough the villages en route to the capital, the people flocked about\r\nto hiss and jeer.\r\n\r\nBut why the lack of proper preparations? Why the insufficiency of the\r\ncommissary? Even the officials in Philadelphia were prone to find\r\nextenuations for the failure of St. Clair. A correspondent of the Boston\r\n‘Centinel,’ dining with some of the first official characters where the\r\ntragic collapse of the expedition had been discussed, found ‘not one\r\nexpression dropped to his prejudice.’[643] The Jeffersonians were aiming\r\nhigher than St. Clair. There was Knox, Secretary of War--what had he to\r\nsay in defense of the honesty of the army contractor, to the negligence\r\nof the quartermaster? The House investigating committee bore heavily on\r\nthese two in its report--but who was responsible for the cupidity of the\r\none and the inefficiency of the other? Soon the Jeffersonian press was\r\nattacking Knox with distressing regularity, picturing him as the\r\n‘Philadelphia Nabob.’[644] Was he not squandering public money on\r\n‘splendor’ and ‘extravagance’? Soon the more irresponsible of the\r\ngossip-mongers were whispering that he had profited financially.\r\n‘Infamous!’ screamed the Federalist press. ‘The public monies have never\r\nbeen in the hands of Mr. Knox.’[645] ‘But who made arrangements with\r\nthe dishonest contractor?’ replied the Jeffersonians. ‘Who selected the\r\nquartermaster who let the soldiers starve?’\r\n\r\nAll through the summer and autumn this was the talk in the taverns and\r\ncoffee-houses, but with the bursting of the bubble of speculation a far\r\nmore effective weapon of assault was at hand. To this inevitable outcome\r\nof the gambling mania Jefferson had looked forward with the utmost\r\nconfidence. He had seen money ‘leaving the remoter parts of the Union\r\nand flowing to [Philadelphia] to purchase paper’; had seen the value of\r\nproperty falling in places left bare of money--as much as twenty-five\r\nper cent in a year in Virginia. Extravagance, madness everywhere.[646]\r\nAs a result in the remoter sections the hatred of the speculator had\r\nreached the stage of hysteria. ‘Clouds, when you rain, bleach him to the\r\nskin,’ prayed a Georgia paper. ‘When you hail, precipitate your heaviest\r\nglobes of ice on his ill-omened pate. Thunders, when you break, break\r\nnear him, shatter an oak or rend a rock full in his view. Lightning,\r\nwhen you burst, shoot your electric streams close to his eyelids.\r\nConscience, haunt him like a ghost.... Ye winds, chill him; ye Frost,\r\npinch him, freeze him. Robbers meet him, strip him, scourge him, rack\r\nhim. He starved the fatherless and made naked the child without a\r\nmother.’[647] Even the Worcester correspondent of the orthodox Boston\r\n‘Centinel’ complained that ‘as soon as one bubble bursts another is\r\nblown up’ and ‘we are in the way of becoming the greatest sharpers in\r\nthe universe’--all ‘assuredly anti-republican.’[648] When a town meeting\r\nwas advertised for Stockbridge, a village wit penciled on the poster the\r\npurpose of the conference: ‘To see if the town will move to New York and\r\nenter into the business of speculation.’[649] While publishing these\r\nletters and stories the Federalist organ in Boston did it with the\r\nsneer: ‘They who are in--Grin. They who are out--Pout. They who have\r\npaper--Caper. They who have none--Groan.’[650]\r\n\r\nThen in April, with the failure of Colonel Duer in New York the crash\r\ncame. Many went to ruin in the wreckage, and New York became a madhouse,\r\nwith business paralyzed, and Duer taking to flight. He had been among\r\nthe most favored of the beneficiaries of Hamilton’s policies, rising\r\nfrom opulence overnight, and he was among the first to fall from their\r\nabuse.[651] The brutality and cowardice of the speculators intensified\r\nthe general contempt for the tribe. ‘Instead of exerting themselves to\r\npreserve some kind of moral character,’ wrote a New York correspondent\r\nof the ‘Maryland Journal,’ ‘they are endeavoring to lower themselves\r\nstill more by descending to the mean level of fish women and common\r\nstreet boxers.’[652]\r\n\r\nAll this was viewed by Hamilton with indignation and concern. He had\r\nsought in every way to discourage the frenzy of speculation, and had\r\nused his office to protect the public wherever possible. But it began\r\nwith the funding system--and with thousands that was enough. Instantly\r\nthe Jeffersonian press was hot on the trail. ‘Business has not been\r\nbenefited by Hamilton’s Bank,’ declared the ‘Independent Chronicle,’\r\n‘for a merchant can scarcely venture to offer his note for $100, while a\r\nspeculator can obtain thousands for no other purpose than to embarrass\r\ncommerce.’ Look around and see who have obtained wealth. ‘Speculators,\r\nin general, are the men.’ Thus, ‘the industrious merchant is forced to\r\nadvance to the government thousands, while the gambling speculator is\r\nreceiving his quarterly payments.’[653] A Maryland correspondent of\r\nLouden’s New York ‘Register’ ‘could not help thinking Mr. Madison’s\r\ndiscriminating propositions would have prevented in great measure the\r\nexorbitant rage of speculation.’[654] Meanwhile, Fenno was denouncing\r\nthe critics as ‘anarchists’ and enemies of the Government, which only\r\nintensified their rage. ‘Our objection is not to paying off the debt,’\r\nprotested an indignant critic, ‘but to ... the excise, failure to\r\ndiscriminate, the play to speculation’; and if all who shared these\r\nviews could be assembled it ‘would make the greatest army that ever was\r\non one occasion collected in the United States.’[655] In the Boston\r\n‘Centinel,’ John Russell was taking a lighter tone. ‘The suffering\r\nyeomanry burdened with taxes? Why not simply eliminate all State and\r\nNational debts and forget them?’[656] The storm? What of it? ‘The Six\r\nPer Cents, a first rate, belonging to the fleet commanded by Admiral\r\nHamilton, notwithstanding several hard COUNTRY gales, and a strong lee\r\ncurrent setting out of the Hudson and Delaware is still working to\r\nwindward and bids fair to gain her destined port.’[657]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWith such attacks and counter attacks in the papers, the campaign of\r\n1792 was fought, with the bitter gubernatorial battle between John Jay\r\nand George Clinton in New York setting the pace in the spring. The\r\nFederalists had set their hearts on the crushing of Clinton, and but for\r\nthe frown of Hamilton, Burr might have joined them in the attempt.[658]\r\nThe campaign was spectacular, and class feeling and prejudice played a\r\npart. Jay was an aristocrat by birth and temperament, and this gave the\r\nClintonians their cue. Up, Plebs, and at ’em! An aristocrat against a\r\ndemocrat, the rich against the poor. Had not Jay said that ‘those who\r\nown the country ought to govern it’? Had not Jay’s Constitution\r\ndisfranchised thousands on the score of their poverty? Were not the\r\nspeculators, the stock-jobbers, the bankers, the gamblers, swindlers,\r\nand the forces of privilege supporting Jay?[659] The result was the\r\nelection of Clinton, on a technicality,[660] and instantly there was an\r\nuproar, broken bones and bloody noses, coffee-house quarrels and blows,\r\nwild talk of a revolutionary convention and the seating of Jay with\r\nbayonets, and serious bloodshed was prevented only through the efforts\r\nof Hamilton, Jay, and King. Never had party feeling run so high, and\r\nseveral duels were fought in the course of a week.[661] The defeated or\r\ncheated candidate was accorded the acclamations due a conqueror on his\r\njourney from his judicial circuit to New York where he was given a\r\ntestimonial dinner.[662] The democrats were none the less jubilant\r\nbecause of the questionable nature of their triumph, and at a dinner in\r\nhonor of Clinton, the Tammany braves rose to the toast, ‘Thomas\r\nJefferson,’ and gave their war-whoop.[663]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness in New York spread to various parts of the country where\r\nthe Jeffersonians were fighting brilliantly, with clever strategy, to\r\ngain seats in the Congress. Some of the Federalists, who were to prove\r\nthemselves generally inferior except in a smashing charge, and incapable\r\nof maintaining their morale in a siege or in reverses, were even then\r\ngrowing pessimistic. ‘Perhaps you are not informed,’ wrote George Cabot\r\nto Theophilus Parsons, ‘that in Pennsylvania and New York the opponents\r\nare well combined and are incessantly active, while the friends discover\r\na want of union and a want of energy.’[664] And Parsons, in melancholy\r\nmood, was convinced that the Government had ‘seen its best days.’[665]\r\nWoe to the politician who enters the reminiscent stage when confronted\r\nby a virile opponent looking to the future. There was little in the New\r\nEngland of 1792 to depress the Federalists. Only a little evidence that\r\namong the working-men in Boston ‘heresies’ were making their way; only\r\nreports that ‘itinerant Jacobins’ were haranguing the curious in the\r\nbar-rooms of Rhode Island and Vermont; only the strange spectacle of\r\n‘drill masters’ meeting with people of no property or importance to\r\norganize them to battle for democratic principles.[666] Only this, and a\r\nstrange doctrine creeping into Vermont papers. In choosing members of\r\nCongress who should be selected? asked a ‘Land Holder’ of that State.\r\n‘What class of people should they represent? Who are the great body of\r\nthe people? Are they Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants, Tradesmen? No--they\r\nare respectable Yeomanry. The Yeomanry therefore ought to be\r\nrepresented.’[667] In Maryland a ferocious fight was waged under the\r\neyes of both Hamilton and Jefferson, for both were interested in the\r\nfate of Mercer who had slashed right lustily at the policies of\r\nHamilton, making no secret of his belief that they were bottomed on\r\ncorruption. He had vitalized the democrats of Maryland, extending his\r\ninterest into districts other than his own, and arranging for candidates\r\nto oppose the sitting Federalists in the House. McHenry, who kept\r\nHamilton informed of the progress of the fight, hoped to array the\r\nGerman Catholics against the obnoxious Mercer through the intervention\r\nof Bishop Carroll, whom he thought more influential than the better\r\nknown Charles Carroll of Carrollton.[668] A man was employed by the\r\nenergetic McHenry to circulate bills against Mercer, who fought back,\r\nand gave blow for blow. He was charged with having said that Hamilton\r\nhad tried to bribe him in the Assumption fight;[669] that he was\r\npersonally interested in the contract for supplying the western army,\r\nand privately engaged in the purchase of securities. This, Mercer was to\r\ndisavow, and Hamilton’s friends were to show that the conversation\r\nbetween the Marylander and the Secretary had been in the presence of\r\ncompany and in jest.[670] Even so we may assume that Mercer had painted\r\nthe incident black. He let it be understood that Washington wished his\r\nreelection, and the celerity with which the President issued a denial\r\nwas probably due to the importunity of Hamilton who did not scruple to\r\nuse him without stint to further the cause of his party.[671]\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina the Jeffersonians, under the crafty leadership of\r\npicturesque Willie Jones, contested every inch of the ground, determined\r\nto retire all the Hamiltonians from Congress, and before the impetuosity\r\nof their charge the Federalists were forced to fight defensively and\r\nunder a cloud.[672]\r\n\r\nIn the new State of Kentucky the Jeffersonians were thoroughly organized\r\nunder the leadership of John Brown, a Virginian, educated at Princeton\r\nand at Jefferson’s alma mater, who had fought through the War of\r\nIndependence. ‘Brown can have what he wants,’ Madison wrote his leader\r\nin midsummer,[673] and he took the toga. In Virginia the Democrats were\r\nstrongly in the ascendancy. The influence of Jefferson had been\r\nstrengthened by the acquisition of Madison, and Hamilton, in the course\r\nof the campaign, wrote his famous letter to Colonel Edward Carrington\r\nattacking both in an effort to satisfy the Virginia Federalists of the\r\njustice of his own position, but it was blowing against a tornado.[674]\r\nAn amazing campaign document--this letter.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1792, if the Jeffersonians had not yet perfected their\r\norganization, they had forced sporadic fighting, and the result of the\r\ncongressional elections was greatly to strengthen them in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIt was clear quite early that the Jeffersonians would not permit Adams’s\r\nreëlection to go unchallenged. The press had teemed with controversial\r\narticles on his books for more than a year. As early as March his\r\nfriends took up the cudgels in his defense. ‘Homo’ in the Boston\r\n‘Centinel’ warned that ‘a detestable cordon of desperadoes’ were trying\r\nto destroy public confidence in Adams by vilification.[675] Within three\r\nmonths, Hamilton convinced himself that the opposition, in dead earnest,\r\nhad concentrated on Clinton, and hastened to warn Adams, who was\r\nenjoying the placidity of his farm at Quincy.[676] It is interesting to\r\nobserve that this plan to displace Adams was interpreted by Hamilton as\r\n‘a serious design to subvert the government.’ If the candidacy of\r\nClinton was annoying to Hamilton, the warning he received in September\r\nof the possible candidacy of Aaron Burr was maddening, and he fell\r\nfeverishly to the task of denouncing the ambitions of this ‘embryo\r\nCæsar’ in letters to his friends.[677] Clinton ‘has been invariably the\r\nenemy of national principles,’ he wrote General C. C. Pinckney in\r\nordering a mobilization for defense in South Carolina, and as for Burr,\r\nhe was a man of ‘no principles other than to mount, at all events, to\r\nthe full honors of the state, and to as much more as circumstances will\r\npermit.’ Was Jefferson behind the conspiracy against Adams--Jefferson,\r\nthat man of ‘sublimated and paradoxical imagination, entertaining and\r\npropagating opinions inconsistent with dignified and orderly\r\ngovernment?’[678] To John Steele in North Carolina he wrote in the\r\nmanner of a commander, to inform him ‘that Mr. Adams is the man who will\r\nbe supported by the Northern and Middle States.’ Of course, he had ‘his\r\nfaults and foibles,’ and some of his opinions were quite wrong, but he\r\nwas honest, and loved order and stable government.[679] Meanwhile,\r\npainful complications were threatened in Maryland where a number of\r\nnotables[680] joined in a public letter rallying Marylanders to the\r\nsupport of Charles Carroll of Carrollton.[681] This gave James McHenry,\r\nan idolater of Hamilton, and still tortured by a persistent, and, as\r\nyet, ungratified itch for office, his opportunity. He assumed the\r\nresponsibility for whipping the rebels back into line. These signers of\r\nthe Carroll letter had been imposed upon. The fight against Adams was a\r\nfight against the Constitution--in keeping with the plan of the enemies\r\nof government to drive able men from office. Had not Hamilton ‘whose\r\nattachment to the Constitution is unquestionable’ been assailed with\r\nvirulence? Yes, from ‘the master workman in his craft down to the\r\nmeanest of his laborers,’ all were engaged in the dirty work. Thus the\r\nsubmission of Carroll’s claims at so late an hour wore ‘a very doubtful\r\nand invidious aspect.’ Was it done ‘to get ten votes against Adams or to\r\npromote Carroll’s election?’ Was any one so foolish as to think that the\r\nDemocrats in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia would desert\r\nClinton?[682] This letter, signed by ‘A Consistent Federalist,’ was\r\ncopied by all the Federalist papers of the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adams, lingering lovingly on his home acres, showed no\r\ninclination to return to Philadelphia, and it was reported that he might\r\nnot appear to preside over the Senate until late in the session. This\r\nwas an appalling lack of tact. Hamilton, assuming the rights of the\r\nleader, did not hesitate. ‘I learn with pain that you may not be here\r\nuntil late in the session,’ he wrote the loiterer behind the firing\r\nlines. ‘I fear this will give some handle to your enemies to\r\nmisrepresent.... Permit me then to say it best suits the firmness and\r\nelevation of your character to meet all events, whether auspicious or\r\notherwise, on the ground where station and duty call you.’[683]\r\n\r\nBy November the press was hotly engaged in the controversy, but poor\r\nFenno was to have trouble with his correspondents who were to convert\r\nhis dignified journal into a cock-pit. Adams was both pelted and salved\r\non the same page. His writings proved him a monarchist at heart, wrote\r\n‘Mutius.’[684] His writings would be appreciated more a century hence,\r\nsaid a defender in the same issue. Had he not already been vindicated on\r\none point in the appearance of the ‘gorgon head of party’? Freneau\r\ncleverly replied by quoting a laudatory article from an English paper\r\npaying tribute to the governmental notions of ‘the learned Mr.\r\nAdams.’[685] Yes, wrote ‘Cornucopia’ in the ‘Maryland Journal,’ ‘it will\r\nrequire the whole strength of the federalists to keep poor John Adams\r\nfrom being thrust out of the fold.’[686]\r\n\r\nAnd ‘poor John Adams’ was not entirely happy in his defenders. Why not\r\nreëlect him, demanded ‘Philanthropos’ in a glowing tribute, for was he\r\nnot ‘a man of innocent manners and excellent moral character?’[687] ‘Why\r\nnot?’ echoed a scribe in Albany. He was ‘a reputed aristocrat, at the\r\nsame time an honest man, the noblest work of God.’[688] From ‘Otsego’\r\ncame a more robust blow at Adams’s enemies as ‘the jacktails of\r\nmobocracy’ seeking the defeat of ‘the virtuous Adams’ because he was\r\nagainst ‘anarchy and disorder.’[689] Wrong, wrote ‘Portius’ the next\r\nday, advocating Clinton. ‘Untinctured by aristocracy, and a firm\r\nrepublican, the patriots of America look to him.’[690] ‘Titles, titles,’\r\nsneered ‘Condorcet.’ ‘This rattle which so peculiarly delights certain\r\ncharacters.... He never appears but in the full blaze of office, as if\r\nevery place he went was a Senate, and every circle which he invited\r\nneeded a Vice President.’[691] Thus, throughout the fall and early\r\nwinter the lashing and slashing went on, but when the time came Adams\r\nwas reëlected, albeit the result was a bitter humiliation to the proud,\r\nsensitive spirit of the victor. Where Washington had been unanimously\r\nreëlected, Adams had a margin of but twenty-seven votes. New York,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, and Georgia had moved _en masse_ into the\r\nClinton camp, and Kentucky had cast her vote for Jefferson. Five States\r\nhad gone over to the Jeffersonians, and the Federalists had been unable\r\nto get a unanimous vote in Pennsylvania. But if Adams was hurt, Hamilton\r\ncould bear his pains, for the brilliant, dashing chief of the party\r\npreferred that the uncongenial man from Braintree should not become too\r\nperky.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first year of actual party struggle--Hamilton a bit\r\nsoiled by his descent to anonymous letter-writing, Jefferson greatly\r\nstrengthened by his silence under assault; the Hamiltonians triumphant,\r\nbut not exultant over the reëlection of Adams, the Jeffersonians, having\r\ntasted blood, and tested their weapons, more than ever eager for combat\r\nand rejoicing in their congressional gains.\r\n\r\nHamilton had tried to drive Jefferson from the Cabinet, and failed. It\r\nwas now the latter’s turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHAMILTON’S BLACK WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1792-93 was notable in many ways. Not within the memory of\r\nthe oldest inhabitant of Philadelphia had one so mild been known. As\r\nlate as February there had been no interruption in the navigation of the\r\nDelaware, and the papers, making much of the catching of shad, were\r\npredicting that ‘a considerable school may soon be expected.’ In this,\r\nhowever, the sons of Ike Walton were to be disappointed, for a snowstorm\r\nand a northwester soon put an end to fishing.[692] Even so, the weather\r\ncontinued, for the most part, mild beyond the usual. Never had society\r\nadorned itself with more frills and furbelows, danced more feverishly,\r\nor pursued its pleasures with greater zest. The elegant new Chestnut\r\nStreet Theater threw open its doors for the entertainment the mimic\r\nworld can give, and the aristocracy, along with the plebeians, flocked\r\nto the play, despite the pouting of the uppish Mrs. Bingham who had been\r\nrefused a box on her own terms. Even the venomous bitterness of the\r\npoliticians failed to dim the lights of the great houses, albeit the\r\nfollowers of Jefferson were more and more given to understand that they\r\nwere not wanted among the elect. The events, moving rapidly in France,\r\nwere making a distinct cleavage here among the aristocrats and\r\ndemocrats. The members of the old French nobility, who had left their\r\ncountry for their country’s good, were giving the tone to the most\r\nfashionable dinner tables. Out in the streets the ‘people of no\r\nparticular importance’ were vulgarly vociferous over the trials and\r\ntribulations of the King and Burke’s beautiful Queen--and the\r\nJeffersonians were taking their tone from the howlings of this ‘mob.’\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the moment Congress convened that a tremendous party\r\nstruggle was impending. The incidents of the preceding summer had left\r\ntheir scars. The Jeffersonians were embittered against Hamilton because\r\nof his anonymous attacks, and nothing could have done more to unsheathe\r\ntheir swords. The truce was over. Washington had permitted Hamilton to\r\ncontinue his attacks by disregarding his request; they would not now\r\npermit even Washington to interpose to save Hamilton from their\r\nassaults. The elections had given them a confidence they had not had\r\nbefore. The next Congress would not be so subservient to ‘the first lord\r\nof the Treasury.’[693] The supercilious assumption of superiority on the\r\npart of the Federalist leaders would henceforth be resented. The war\r\nwould begin in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe line the attack would take was shown early when Fitzsimons, one of\r\nHamilton’s henchmen in the House, offered a resolution calling for the\r\nredemption of so much of the public debt as the Nation had a right to\r\nredeem, and asking Hamilton ‘to report a plan for the purpose.’ This was\r\nin accordance with the custom which had grown up. From the moment he had\r\ntaken office, Hamilton had considered the members of the House,\r\nconstitutionally charged with the duty of framing money bills, as his\r\nautomatons. He would determine upon the plans himself, prepare the\r\nbills, and call upon the House to pass them without too much discussion.\r\nHe would manage the finances himself and he would not be plagued by\r\nfoolish questions. For many months the committees to which his measures\r\nhad been referred had been of his own choosing. They were his followers,\r\nand, not a few of them, beneficiaries of his policies.\r\n\r\nThe Fitzsimons Resolution was instantly challenged by the Jeffersonians\r\nas a rather high-handed proposal under a republican form of government,\r\nand Madison rose to suggest that the House should know the exact state\r\nof the finances before measures were taken for the reduction of the\r\ndebt. After all, it was with the House, not with the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, that money bills should originate. At any rate, the House\r\ncould not act intelligently without having the facts in its possession.\r\nAll too long had it been patient without definite reports.[694]\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the masses over the by-products of the funding system had\r\nby this time become deep-seated. Men who had voted to create the Bank\r\nhad been made members of the board of directors. The ne’er-do-wells of\r\nyesterday were riding in coaches and building pretentious houses.\r\nHamilton was urging bounties or protective duties for manufacturers one\r\nday and running over to the Falls of Passaic on the next to assist the\r\ndirectors of a corporation, that was to profit by his recommendations,\r\nin selecting the sites for the factories. Not a few honestly believed\r\nthat he was personally profiting through governmental measures. Almost\r\nfrom the beginning, Senator Maclay had been suspicious of his integrity.\r\nThis utterly false impression grew out of the positive knowledge that\r\nsome of Hamilton’s closest political associates were speculating in the\r\nsecurities. ‘Hamilton at the head of the speculators, with all the\r\ncourtiers, are on one side,’ Maclay wrote in his diary.[695] Only a\r\nmonth before at Mount Vernon, where Washington had begged Jefferson to\r\nreconsider his determination to resign, the latter had charged the head\r\nof the Treasury with creating ‘a regular system for forming a corps of\r\ninterested persons who should be steadily at the orders of the\r\nTreasury.’[696] In 1790, William Duer retired from Hamilton’s office to\r\nbecome the king of the money-chasers, and, going down to ruin in the\r\nfinancial crash of the preceding summer, was sending out dire threats of\r\nstartling revelations from the debtors’ prison. Many honest men were\r\nquite ready to believe that these threats were aimed at Hamilton.[697]\r\nIt was under these conditions that a miserable creature by the name of\r\nJames Reynolds, in prison for a crime against the Treasury, sought to\r\nblackmail his way out. He had papers in his possession to prove some\r\nfinancial transactions with Alexander Hamilton. An obscure person of a\r\nlow order of mentality, he hinted at his use as a dummy in business in\r\nwhich a member of the Cabinet did not care to appear. These facts\r\nreached some members of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn December 15th, two sober-faced members of the House and one Senator\r\nfiled into Hamilton’s office in the Pemberton mansion. The Secretary\r\nknew them all and knew two of them as enemies. Frederick Muhlenberg had\r\nserved as a Speaker in the first House and was to resume that post in\r\nthe third. A strong character, the recognized leader of the Germans, the\r\nforemost American Lutheran minister of his time, he had played a\r\nconspicuous part in the Revolution and in the constructive work that\r\nfollowed. Abraham Venable was a Representative from Virginia. The\r\nSenator was James Monroe whose fanatical devotion to Jeffersonian ideals\r\nand ideas had long since made him the object of Hamilton’s contempt.\r\n\r\nAs they took seats facing the masterful little man at the desk, they had\r\nthe manner of judges confronting a victim. None of them were finished in\r\nthe art of tactful speech. Bluntly they blurted forth their\r\nmission--they had evidence of a mysterious connection between the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and James Reynolds. What had Mr. Hamilton to\r\nsay to that? Even under the least provocative circumstances, Hamilton\r\nwas quick-tempered, and here was something to arouse the lion in him.\r\nFor a moment he raged in his resentment. The visitors, a little moved,\r\nperhaps, stood their ground. They had papers and the right to an\r\nexplanation. His fury having consumed itself, Hamilton realized that\r\nthere was something to explain, and he was ready. Would they meet him at\r\nhis house that night? They would. The three men rose, bowed, departed.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Hamilton home that winter night, they found Oliver\r\nWolcott, the protégé of the host, there before them. In the presence of\r\nthese enemies it was wise to have one friend as a witness. The visitors\r\nwere received with the courtly courtesy of which Hamilton was capable,\r\nand after they had found chairs about the table, he produced some papers\r\nof his own, spreading them out by the candlelight, before him. Then,\r\nquite calmly, and with an occasional touch of humor, he made a\r\nremarkable confession.\r\n\r\nIt was the old story of a great man’s weakness. One summer day in 1791 a\r\nMrs. Reynolds had appeared at his home with a pathetic story of her\r\ndesertion by her husband and a plea for funds to enable her to return to\r\nher family in New York. Strangely enough, no description of this\r\nadventuress has come down to us, but it is a reasonable presumption that\r\nshe was comely. The family of Hamilton was in the house. The master was\r\nmoved. Naturally he would accommodate her, but at the moment he had no\r\nmoney with him. He would take her address and send or bring it in the\r\nevening. That night the gods looking down from Olympus might have seen\r\none of their favorite earth-children furtively making his way through\r\nthe dimly lighted streets, away from the fashionable quarter into the\r\nsection of cheap boarding-houses. The woman received him in her room. It\r\nwas the old story of Cæsar and Cleopatra, albeit this was a Cleopatra of\r\nthe more vulgar sort. ‘After that,’ said Hamilton, ‘I had frequent\r\nmeetings with her at my own house, Mrs. Hamilton and her children being\r\nabsent on a visit to her father.’[698] The comedy hurried on. At length\r\nhe thought to bring it to a termination, and it was then that Mrs.\r\nReynolds proved herself a mistress of her art. She was passionately in\r\nlove. A separation would break her heart. Here, surely, was a violent\r\nattachment--perhaps it would be better to break off gradually. The lover\r\nwas not lacking in the finer sensibilities, and then, too, his vanity\r\nwas pleased.[699] With the continuance of the _amour_, Mrs. Reynolds,\r\nsimulating a consuming passion, began to flood her _innamorato_ with\r\ntender epistles.[700] The climax was on the wing. One day an hysterical\r\nnote announcing the husband’s discovery of her infidelity, and warning\r\nthat, if no answer was forthcoming to the letter the Secretary would\r\nreceive from the irate husband, Mrs. Hamilton would be informed. Would\r\nit not be wise to see him? Hamilton thought so and summoned Reynolds to\r\nhis office. The cunning rascal had his story ready: the wife discovered\r\nwriting a mysterious letter--a black messenger traced to the Hamilton\r\nhouse--the accused wife on her knees confessing all.[701] After\r\nnegotiations the heartbroken husband decided that a thousand dollars\r\nwould salve his wounded honor. ‘And I will leave the town ... and leave\r\nher to Yourself to do for her as you think proper,’ he added.[702]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these painful revelations, Muhlenberg and Venable\r\ndeclared themselves satisfied, but Hamilton insisted on telling the\r\nstory to the end. Then followed the most amazing part of the tale. The\r\nhusband invited his wife’s lover to resume the _amour_. Hamilton was\r\ncoy. Mrs. Reynolds added her plea in illiterate, pleading letters. The\r\nvanity of Hamilton was likewise persuasive, and the comedy was resumed.\r\nWhen he sought to escape notice by going by the back way, Reynolds was\r\nindignant. ‘Am I a person of such a Bad carector [character] that you\r\nwould not wish to be seen Coming to my house in the front way?’ he\r\nwrote.[703] This should have put Hamilton on his guard, but he fell into\r\nthe trap. A witness had been provided in another blackmailer, Clingman,\r\nwho had been a clerk in Hamilton’s office, and was an unspeakable\r\nscoundrel. Then more money was demanded. Mrs. Reynolds was again\r\nalarmed. Her husband was often morose and beat her. At times he\r\nthreatened to murder Hamilton. Loans were made. This, then, was the\r\nnature of the mysterious financial relations with Reynolds.\r\n\r\nWhen the party rose to leave, Muhlenberg and Venable were\r\napologetic--but not so James Monroe. He bowed stiffly, the sternness of\r\nhis features unrelaxed, as the three passed out into the winter night.\r\nHamilton had vindicated his official honor at a painful sacrifice. It\r\nwas understood that the confession should be sacredly confidential, but\r\nin a sense he had lost. As he sat with Wolcott before the fire after his\r\ntormentors had departed, he realized that his enemies were out to wreck\r\nhis official reputation. He may have had a premonition of the storm that\r\nwas about to break.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNine days after the scene enacted by candlelight in Hamilton’s library,\r\nthe bill authorizing the President to negotiate a loan of two million\r\ndollars to be applied to the reimbursement of a loan made of the Bank\r\ncame up for consideration in the House. William B. Giles, who was now\r\ndividing the leadership of the Jeffersonians with Madison, was instantly\r\non his feet with a request for postponement. Perhaps some method could\r\nbe found without recourse to a new loan. It might be better to pay the\r\nloan by selling the stock the Nation owned in the Bank. The watchful\r\nSedgwick was shocked at the suggestion. Dumping so much stock upon the\r\nmarket would reduce the price and not enough money would be realized to\r\nmeet the country’s obligation to the Bank. It was a mild premonitory\r\nskirmish.[704]\r\n\r\nChristmas Day brought an armistice, but the next day the discussion was\r\nresumed, with Madison taking a leading part. Why was so much more to be\r\nborrowed than was demanded by the Bank? To his personal knowledge a\r\nlarge sum was lying idle and unappropriated in the Treasury. If this\r\nbalance was appropriated by the President, he wanted to know it. A\r\ndelicate subject to discuss, suggested Sedgwick. Not at all, thought\r\nMadison. It was time for some ‘candid explanation.’ Was the\r\nappropriation lying dormant in the Treasury, borrowed to meet the\r\nobligations to France, being demanded by the country to which it was\r\ndue? The important question concerned the diverting of money\r\nappropriated to that specific purpose to the payment of Bank\r\ninstallments. Could gentlemen justify themselves to their constituents\r\nfor such conduct? The debt to France was one of gratitude and justice,\r\nand he wished the money could be sent thither on the wings of the wind.\r\nTrue, the debt in whole was not yet due, but in the critical condition\r\nof our benefactor, it would no doubt be particularly acceptable and he\r\nwas opposed to the diversion of any part of it.[705] Why two millions\r\nfor the Bank? demanded Giles. True, two hundred thousand dollars would\r\nbe due the Bank on January 1st, but why two millions? No one had offered\r\nan explanation of how the money lying dormant was disposed of, or how it\r\nwas intended to dispose of it. No member rose to explain, and the bill\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\nDuring the next month the lobbies, boarding-houses, taverns, buzzed with\r\ndiscussions of the finances of the country. After all, even the members\r\nof the House, presumed to be familiar with the fiscal affairs of the\r\nNation, knew scarcely anything. They had appropriated blindly. There was\r\nsomething uncanny in the silence. Would the raising of the curtain\r\ndisclose skeletons in the closet of the Treasury? At any rate, the House\r\nhad a right to the facts and figures. Throughout the month Madison and\r\nGiles were frequently at the table or about the blazing fire at\r\nJefferson’s. Here the campaign was planned. The fight should be forced\r\ninto the open on the floor of the House. Jefferson could not\r\nparticipate, for manifest reasons, but he could direct. Madison could\r\nassist in the preparation of the resolutions and in the debate. Giles,\r\nwho was a masterful debater, fearless and slashing in attack, could\r\nsponsor the resolutions and lead in the assault. Because of the part he\r\nthen played, it has been the fashion to dismiss him flippantly with a\r\nshrug and a sneer--but this is absurd. Giles of Virginia was unsurpassed\r\nby any American debater of his time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGiles was a veritable D’Artagnan of debate, a gusty, lusty Gascon\r\ntransplanted to the tobacco-fields of Virginia, eager always for a fight\r\nor a frolic, and lightning-swift with his blade. A blustering fellow,\r\ntrue, quick to assert his rights and repel assault, he carried himself\r\nwith a swagger that did not endear him to the Federalists, who rather\r\nplumed themselves on having a monopoly on that particular vice or\r\nvirtue. But sneers at his ability are absurd. He who won the admiration\r\nof Patrick Henry,[706] commanded the confidence and respect of\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe, received the discriminating praise of\r\nRandolph of Roanoke,[707] and the reluctant tribute of Justice\r\nStory,[708] cannot be sneered from a respectable place in history by a\r\nwretchedly unfair caricature by a partisan English biographer of one of\r\nhis enemies.[709]\r\n\r\nThe young Virginian who appeared in Philadelphia in the winter of\r\n1790-91 was not prepossessing in appearance. Of average height, the\r\nfullness of his person conveyed the impression of a squat figure. His\r\nface, large, round, but colorless, bore none of the indications of\r\ngenius, albeit there was something of virility in his brown eyes that\r\nharmonized with the robustness of his physique. One who knew him has\r\nrecorded that he was of fair complexion,[710] but another who heard him\r\nfrequently in debate commented on his dark color, and, since his hair\r\nand eyes were those of a brunette, we may accept the latter as more\r\nprobable than the former.[711] All agree that he was careless in his\r\ndress, after the then prevailing Virginia manner,[712] although we have\r\nthe record of one dramatic appearance in the Virginia Legislature, at\r\nthe height of his renown, ‘elegantly dressed in blue and buff’ and with\r\nthe Gascon touch of being ‘booted and spurred, with a riding-whip in his\r\nhand.’[713] If there was nothing imposing or picturesque in his\r\nappearance, his manners were such as to make him stand out\r\nconspicuously among his fellows. These were such as to impress the none\r\ntoo finished Maclay that ‘the frothy manners of Virginia were ever\r\nuppermost.’ It is easy enough to reconstruct the scene at Washington’s\r\ntable where Maclay met our Gascon, with Giles, the good liver, dwelling\r\nunctuously on Virginia canvasback ducks, Virginia hams, Virginia\r\nchickens, and the old Madeira, which was a little more mellow when\r\ndrained from a Virginia glass in a joyous Virginia dining-room. Proud of\r\nVirginia was this provincial from the tobacco country, and proud as\r\nD’Artagnan himself of his physical prowess, for didn’t he take more\r\nmanual exercise than any man in New England? No place like the Old\r\nDominion where the living was ‘fast and fine,’ where from noon to night\r\nthe people drank wine or cherry bounce like gentlemen. Thus he thundered\r\nalong, to the amazement of Maclay, who observed that ‘he practiced on\r\nhis principle every time the bottle passed.’[714] The picture is no\r\ndoubt true, for Giles was racy of his native soil. The Amelia County of\r\nhis early days was of the frontier, with all that that implies of the\r\nprimitive vices and virtues. The sparsely settled country, with its\r\nmiserable roads, lived very much to itself, and strangers who ventured\r\namong its inhabitants were treated coldly. The living was truly ‘fast\r\nand fine’ and rather loose, for the men were careless, indifferent to\r\ndress, heavy drinkers, inveterate smokers, their conversations\r\npicturesque with profanity; and they were fighters, too. Dumas’s three\r\nimmortals would have found it to their liking, and had they encountered\r\nyoung Giles at some crossroads tavern they would have taken him to their\r\nhearts. The spirit of independence flamed on every hearth, and the\r\nreligious dissenters found it a happy hunting-ground.[715] It was in\r\nthis atmosphere that Giles grew up. Like most of the Jeffersonian\r\nleaders, he was a frontiersman.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to Princeton to complete his education, we get again the\r\nD’Artagnan touch. He set forth like a Virginia gentleman with his negro\r\nslave to serve him, no doubt kicking, cursing, and loving him all the\r\nway. Then followed a law course at William and Mary--and then a law\r\noffice was opened in the little tobacco town of Petersburg. We are\r\ninterested in this period of his career only in that it throws light on\r\nhis character and capacity. He favored the ratification of the\r\nConstitution, and, as a fascinated spectator of the debates in the\r\nVirginia Convention, formed a deep admiration for Madison. In the\r\nevenings he argued for ratification at the tavern, no doubt in the\r\ntaproom. Hearing him one night, George Mason, a leader of the\r\nopposition, made the comment that ‘he has as much sense as one half of\r\nus, though he is on the wrong side.’[716] He was not, then, an\r\nanti-Federalist on the Constitution.\r\n\r\nImmediately on entering Congress at twenty-eight, he commanded\r\nattention, for he had a genius for congressional life. He became at once\r\na giant in debate. When John Randolph, more cynic than flatterer,\r\npronounced Giles the Charles James Fox of the House, he referred to the\r\nimpression made by the Virginian in action. Fox was a student; Giles was\r\nnot. Fox was capable of sustained research; Giles was not. Fox was a\r\nlover and reader of books, and Giles cared nothing for them. He bore a\r\ncloser resemblance to Mirabeau or Danton in his methods, absorbing his\r\nknowledge from others in conversation. In the tavern, on the highway, at\r\nthe dinner table, he was a tireless talker, and by provoking his friends\r\ninto discussion he tested, corrected, and formed his impressions of\r\nevents and measures. His mind absorbed like a sponge, his memory was\r\nretentive. The idea that Jefferson or Madison outlined his speeches for\r\nhim is ludicrous. He merely assimilated what they said--and then gave it\r\nout more forcefully than either could in debate.[717]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reconcile the slurring references of some historians\r\nto his manner in debate with the speeches that speak for themselves on\r\nthe musty pages of the ‘Annals of Congress.’ Here was a man speaking\r\ndirectly to a purpose. No critic need kill off his Roman consuls, for\r\nthere were none. No craving here for a reputation for erudition. No mere\r\nrhetorical flourishes to confuse the sense. No theatrical appeals to the\r\nemotions. No verbosity at all--but ‘a clear, nervous expression, a\r\nwell-digested and powerful condensation of language,’ which could make\r\nan impression on the scholarly Story. That great jurist, an unfriendly\r\nwitness, could not hear him without admiration. ‘He holds his subject\r\nalways before him,’ he wrote, ‘and surveys it with untiring eyes; he\r\npoints his objects with calculated force and sustains his positions with\r\npenetrating and wary argument. He certainly possesses great strength of\r\nmind.’[718]\r\n\r\nHaving prepared himself to meet all comers, he thus dashed to the\r\ncombat. Having assimilated all that he had absorbed, his native\r\nresourcefulness and ready command of good plain English did the rest. He\r\nspoke with the forceful fluency which was the best possible substitute\r\nfor eloquence. A powerful voice, a virile manner, compelled attention\r\nand respect. Did an enemy attack him as he rushed along? He either\r\ncrushed him with brutal strength, or cleverly ducked the blow--and was\r\non his way again. Instinctively he knew when to strike and when to\r\ndodge. When on the floor, he dominated the scene. This was the man, so\r\nmuch belittled, whom Benton wrote down in cold deliberation as ‘the most\r\naccomplished debater which his country has ever seen.’ This the man\r\nselected in the conferences of Jefferson and Madison to lead the attack\r\non the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDuring this period of waiting, with the gossips busy in the taverns and\r\nthe streets, Freneau was zealously seeking to create the right\r\natmosphere for the attack. With the Hamiltonians ascribing all\r\nprosperity to the policies of their chief, Freneau and other editorial\r\nenemies were making much of the protest of ‘Patriot,’ who had been\r\nruined through the abuse of these fiscal policies.\r\n\r\n     The tale is true [it ran]. I loved my country. In 1775, my only son\r\n     fought on Bunker Hill.... His mother sent the chair down to carry\r\n     him home. She wiped the blood from his face and dressed the wound\r\n     in his breast. He died. My neighbor, Smallacre ... said it was the\r\n     proper reward for rebellion, but that a halter would have been more\r\n     proper. I persevered in the cause of freedom. Congress wanted\r\n     money--I called in my debts and sold all my land excepting forty\r\n     acres. In ... 1778 I had 12,000 in paper. I loaned the whole, and\r\n     when they were consolidated at forty for one I had a loan office\r\n     certificate for $300. In 1784 the General Court issued a large tax.\r\n     As I could obtain neither the interest or principal of my loan\r\n     office note I was obliged to sell it. My neighbor, Smallacre,\r\n     saved his property from the waste of a cause to which he was\r\n     heartily opposed, and he appeared to buy my note at Three Shillings\r\n     for Twenty. By this means I paid my State tax of Nine pounds, ten\r\n     shillings and had four pounds left for town and parish taxes. As my\r\n     son was dead I was content to be poor.... My old chair and horse\r\n     remained.... My neighbor, Smallacre, has now become rich by\r\n     purchase of public securities from people distressed as I was. He\r\n     tells me that our Hancocks and our Sam Adams and those kind of men\r\n     know how to pull down a government, but do not know how to build\r\n     one.[719]\r\n\r\nProsperity? Yes, but for whom? demanded the enemies of Hamilton, poking\r\nthe ‘Patriot’s’ protest under the nose of his defenders. With the\r\nHamiltonians crediting their idol with all the good things that had\r\noccurred, Freneau was moved to mirthful verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘Whales on our shores have run aground,\r\n     Sturgeons are in our rivers found--\r\n     Nay--ships have on the Delaware sailed,\r\n     A sight most new.\r\n     Wheat has been sown--\r\n     Harvests have grown--\r\n     On coaches now, gay coats of arms are borne\r\n     By some who hardly had a cent before--\r\n     Silk gowns, instead of homespun, now are seen,\r\n     Instead of native straw, the Leghorn hat,\r\n     And, Sir, ’tis true\r\n     (Twixt me and you)\r\n     That some have grown prodigious fat,\r\n     And some prodigious lean.’[720]\r\n\r\nThis press crusade against Hamilton was carried on along with much\r\nlaudation of Jefferson, inspired by the report of his decision to retire\r\nfrom the Cabinet. ‘Mirabeau’ heard with distress that ‘the leader of\r\ndemocracy’ wished to ‘seek the peaceful shades’ to ‘solace himself with\r\nhis favorite philosophy.’ True, the sea had been made tempestuous for\r\nhim, but ‘the crew are his friends, and notwithstanding the endeavors of\r\nthe officers to raise a mutiny to supercede him ... his honest labor and\r\nfirmness has frustrated their wicked intentions and he rides\r\ntriumphant.’ But with his retirement ‘monarchy and aristocracy would\r\ninundate the country.’[721] Right, agreed ‘Gracchus,’ ‘for though he\r\nhas been in office near four years he has never assumed the insolence of\r\nit. His department has been that of a Republican and in no one action or\r\nexpression has he manifested a superiority over his fellow\r\ncitizens.’[722]\r\n\r\nHamilton and his followers had frankly sought to drive Jefferson from\r\nthe Cabinet and failed; the plan was now complete for driving Hamilton\r\nhimself into private life.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOn January 23d, the result of the deliberations of Jefferson, Madison,\r\nand Giles appeared when the latter rose in the House to present a set of\r\nresolutions calling upon the President to submit complete reports on the\r\nfiscal operations of the Government. To these the House was clearly\r\nentitled. Nor was there anything violent or outrageous in Giles’s speech\r\nin which he explained them. The House had been legislating for four\r\nyears ‘without competent official knowledge of the state of the Treasury\r\nor revenue.’ They had ‘engaged in the most important fiscal\r\narrangements,’ and had ‘authorized a loan of the Bank ... for more than\r\n$500,000 when probably a greater sum of public money was deposited in\r\nthe Bank.’ They were now on the point of authorizing a further loan of\r\n$2,000,000 in the dark--and they were entitled to light. ‘I conceive\r\nthat it is now time for this information to be laid before the\r\nHouse.’[723] No one rose to object and the resolutions were adopted.\r\n\r\nTo Hamilton, who looked upon Congress as a meddlesome body, they\r\nappeared as something more than a bore. They were an imposition and an\r\ninsult. He was entrusted with the financial arrangements, and all he\r\nasked was to be let alone. But he realized that such a lofty tone could\r\nnot be publicly assumed. Suppressing his indignation, he set to work\r\nwith meticulous care to prepare the fullest possible reports before the\r\nexpiration of the congressional session. His enemies thought to burden\r\nhim with a task that could not be performed in so short a time. Their\r\nstrategy was to let the resolutions with their implications seep in on\r\nthe minds of the people throughout the ensuing summer; his cue was to\r\nthwart them in that purpose, to achieve the impossible, to meet the\r\nresolutions during the session, and win a triumph.\r\n\r\nNot for him, that winter, the gala nights at the new Chestnut Street\r\nTheater, nor the dinners at the Binghams’, nor the dances at the\r\nStewarts’, nor the felicities of the hearth with Eliza at his side. His\r\nplace was at the Pemberton mansion, day and night, until the work was\r\ndone. Oliver Wolcott and the clerks were doomed to the same drudgery.\r\nFar into the night the lights gleamed in the windows of the old house,\r\nand dark and deserted were the streets when the workers made their way\r\nto their various homes after dreary hours of poring over figures,\r\nassembling facts, and writing explanations.\r\n\r\nWithin twelve days, the first report, with elaborate tables containing\r\nthe most minute details of transactions, was sent to the House. Two days\r\nlater, the second report was done and in. A week more and the third was\r\nsent. Another six days, and the last was finished. The intense\r\napplication, the late hours, the nervous strain, told perceptibly on\r\nHamilton, who was never robust. The color left his cheeks when they were\r\nnot flushed with excitement. His nights were all but sleepless. His\r\nwaning strength was sustained by the driving force of his powerful mind.\r\nWhen it was over, even Wolcott found that his routine business had\r\nfallen behind and that he would ‘be busy for some time to bring it up.’\r\nTo his father he apologized for failure to answer letters. There was no\r\ntime for letters. ‘The winter ... has required every exertion which I\r\ncould make.’[724]\r\n\r\nAs these voluminous reports poured in upon the House in rapid\r\nsuccession, the Jeffersonians were amazed and the Hamiltonians beside\r\nthemselves with joy. A startling intellectual feat, to be sure. ‘I can\r\nrecall nothing from the British Minister in all the conflicts of party\r\nequal to it,’ wrote one admirer. ‘Even Neckar’s boasted account of the\r\nfinances of France ... is inferior, although that was the result of long\r\nstudy and elaborate preparation, and Hamilton’s the work of a moment.\r\nPoor fellow, if he has slept much these last three weeks I congratulate\r\nhim upon it.’[725] Wonderful reports, agreed the ‘Centinel’ of Boston.\r\n‘The manly unequivocable sentiments--the fair and accurate statements,\r\nand the judicious arrangements ... must fix his character as a Patriot,\r\na statesman, and an able and honest financier.’[726] Yes, added another,\r\n‘he will come forth pure gold.’[727]\r\n\r\nBut his enemies were not so much delighted. They read and studied the\r\nreports, complaining that the wizard of the speculators was up to his\r\nold tricks. A maze of words, interminable sophistries, columns of\r\nconfusing figures, arguments instead of facts, and special pleading--no\r\none could understand these reports--such the verdict of the rank and\r\nfile. To which the Hamiltonians responded with a sneering verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘The Secretary makes reports\r\n     When’er the House commands him;\r\n     But for their lives, some members say,\r\n     They cannot understand him.\r\n     In such a puzzling case as this\r\n     What can a mortal do?\r\n     ‘Tis hard for ONE to find REPORTS\r\n     And understanding too.’[728]\r\n\r\nBut the leaders among the Jeffersonians were studying the reports and\r\nfinding a few things that they could understand. Evidence of corruption\r\nthey did not find, but they found technical violations of the law, an\r\nindifference on Hamilton’s part to the clear intent of Congress in\r\nmaking appropriations--quite enough, as they thought, on which to\r\ncontinue the attack. Again Giles and Madison sat with Jefferson in his\r\nhome going over the reports, and framing the second set of resolutions\r\nwith which it was hoped to drive their enemy from the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThree days before the end of the session, Giles presented his famous\r\nresolutions in condemnation of Hamilton’s official conduct, based on the\r\ndisclosures in his reports. It does not matter who originally wrote\r\nthem. A scholarly historian[729] has produced proof of the part played\r\nby Jefferson. In the very nature of things he must have had a part.\r\nMadison unquestionably made suggestions and possibly revamped the copy\r\nproduced by Jefferson. Giles presented them, and they embodied the\r\nconclusions of the three outstanding leaders of the opposition.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions, intemperately denounced from the day of their\r\nappearance, set forth some novel theories, in view of the manner in\r\nwhich the Treasury had been administered, but, read in the light of the\r\npresent regulations in the matter of appropriations, they are scarcely\r\nremarkable and not in the least vicious. They set forth that ‘laws\r\nmaking specific appropriations of money should be strictly observed by\r\nthe administrator of the finances’; that a violation of this rule was\r\ntantamount to a violation of the Constitution; and charged that Hamilton\r\nhad violated the law passed August 4, 1790, making appropriations of\r\ncertain moneys authorized to be borrowed in the following particulars,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\nFirst, by applying a certain amount of the principal borrowed to the\r\npayment of interest falling due upon that principal, which was not\r\nauthorized by that or any other law.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by drawing part of the same moneys into the United States\r\nwithout the instruction of the President.\r\n\r\nThey charged him with deviating from the President’s instructions, with\r\nneglecting an ‘essential duty’ in failing to give Congress official\r\ninformation of his proceedings in the transactions of the foreign loans.\r\nMore to the point, politically, was the charge that he ‘did not consult\r\nthe public interest in negotiating a loan with the Bank of the United\r\nStates, and drawing therefrom $400,000 at five per cent per annum, when\r\na greater sum of public money was deposited in various banks at the\r\nrespective periods of making the respective drafts.’ In conclusion, it\r\nwas provided that a copy of the resolutions should be transmitted to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe main thing proved by the investigation was something that required\r\nno proof--that Hamilton had been managing the finances in the spirit of\r\nan autocrat, a little contemptuous of the rights of Congress, a little\r\nindifferent to the specific terms of the appropriations. These he had\r\nnot hesitated to juggle to suit his own purposes. In so doing he had\r\nbeen guilty of technical violations of the law, but he had committed no\r\ncrime. His hands were clean. Yet money intended for France had not been\r\npaid, and money not intended for the Bank had gone into its vaults. This\r\nwas enough. Suspicion did the rest.\r\n\r\nThe most censurable feature of the attack was the introduction of the\r\nresolutions on the eve of adjournment. Jefferson, Madison, and Giles had\r\nno idea that they would or could be disposed of before Congress should\r\nautomatically expire. Copies had gone to the papers of the four corners\r\nto be read by the people, and it is probable that it was the intent that\r\nthey should have the summer and autumn to make their impression on the\r\npublic mind. It was manifestly an unfair advantage. But the Hamiltonians\r\nhad no thought of permitting any such delay. They were in a majority in\r\nthe House. In the Pemberton house, by candlelight, the Treasury clan was\r\nsummoned to a council of war, and they went forth to force the fighting\r\nto a speedy finish.\r\n\r\nThe reports had settled nothing with Hamilton’s enemies. ‘When\r\nCatullus[730] invited America to look through the windows of his breast\r\nand judge of the purity of his political motives, he did not invite in\r\nvain,’ exulted ‘Decius’ in the ‘National Gazette.’[731] Willing to meet\r\nhis accusers? sneered ‘Franklin.’ ‘Pardon me, sir, if I am one of those\r\nunbelievers, who, placing no confidence in any of your professions, do\r\nverily think that you neither wish, desire nor dare to meet full and\r\nfair inquiry. Have you asked it, sir?’[732] These jeers and exultant\r\ncries were intolerable. The vindication of the House must come speedily.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of February there was a preliminary skirmish, and on\r\nMarch 1st, the contending armies were marshaled for a decisive struggle.\r\nSedgwick and the faithful Smith of South Carolina led off for Hamilton,\r\nand Giles followed for the Resolutions. Fitzsimons of Philadelphia and\r\nLaurance of New York City, both representatives of the commercial\r\ninterests, attacked, and Mercer of Maryland replied. Boudinot defended\r\nHamilton, and Madison rose to make the premier argument in condemnation\r\nof the policies of the Treasury; and Ames, the most brilliant of the\r\nHamiltonian orators, who had been held in reserve for Madison, replied.\r\nThus the day wore on, darkness fell, and the candles had long been\r\nlighted before the House adjourned for dinner. Seven o’clock found the\r\ngalleries packed, Senators upon the floor, favored spectators in the\r\nrear of the Chamber packed in close. The leading drawing-rooms were dark\r\nthat night, for their mistresses looked down upon the drama of the black\r\neyes and bloody noses. The struggle continued far into the night.\r\n\r\nHere let us pause to catch the drift of the speeches. The supporters of\r\nHamilton made the most of the failure to find any evidence of\r\ncriminality. ‘They present nothing that involves self-interest or\r\npecuniary considerations.... Instead of anything being detected that\r\nwould disgrace Pandemonium, nothing ... which would sully the purest\r\nangel in Heaven.’ Thus spoke Smith. No longer ‘the foul stain of\r\npeculation,’ but ‘the milder coloring of an illegal exercise of\r\ndiscretion and a want of politeness in the Secretary of the Treasury,’\r\nsaid Barnwell.[733] What if a critical examination had revealed a\r\ndeviation from the letter of the law, exclaimed Laurance. Was that an\r\nexcuse for sounding ‘the alarm from St. Croix to St. Mary’s?’ No\r\ncorruption! cried Mercer, who had been forced to deny campaign charges\r\nhe had made. ‘I still entertain the opinion that there is corruption.’\r\nThe House was in turmoil, and the Marylander was sharply called to\r\norder. On he plunged, recklessly fighting his way against calls to\r\norder.\r\n\r\nNo charge of corruption stained the lips of Madison, who moved on solid\r\nground. There had been a technical violation of the law, and he proved\r\nit. There had been a disregard of the instructions of the President, and\r\nhe showed it. He went thus far, no farther, and he hammered home the\r\nfacts. ‘I will not deny,’ he said, ‘that there may be emergencies in the\r\ncourse of human affairs of so extraordinary and pressing a nature as to\r\nabsolve the Executive from an inflexible conformity to the injunctions\r\nof the law. It is, nevertheless, as essential to remember ... that in\r\nall such cases the necessity should be palpable; that the Executive\r\nsanction should flow from the supreme source; and that the first\r\nopportunity should be seized for communicating to the Legislature the\r\nmeasures pursued, with the reasons of the necessity for them. This early\r\ncommunication is equally enforced by both prudence and duty. It is the\r\nbest evidence of the motives for assuming the extraordinary power; it is\r\na respect manifestly due to the Legislative authority.’ On this ground\r\nhe stood, and there stood Giles.\r\n\r\nThe charges were dismissed by Ames, _ex-cathedra_-wise, with a shrug.\r\nWhat if there had been a juggling of the funds? ‘It is impossible,’ he\r\nsaid unblushingly, ‘to keep different funds, differently appropriated,\r\nso inviolably separated as that one may not be used for the object of\r\nthe other.’ Nothing criminal had been proved.[734]\r\n\r\nOne by one the resolutions were taken up and overwhelmingly voted\r\ndown--voted down even where Hamilton had admitted the charge and\r\njustified his acts. Before the last vote was reached, many of the\r\nmembers, worn by the excitement, the confinement, and fatigue, and\r\nconfident of the result, deserted their posts and wandered forth into\r\nthe winter night.[735]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHamilton had sought, through his anonymous letters, to drive Jefferson\r\nfrom the Cabinet--and failed. Jefferson had tried, through this\r\ninvestigation, to drive Hamilton from public life--and failed. The\r\nstruggle must go on. Each had caused the other some distress, each drawn\r\na little blood, but neither had inflicted a serious wound.\r\n\r\nWith the adjournment of Congress, the skirmishing was taken up all over\r\nthe country through the press. The Boston Federalists opened fire upon\r\nthe ‘Boston Argus.’ It had published the resolutions, but not the\r\nHamilton reports. The resolutions had been carried on the same mail that\r\nconveyed the vote of vindication, and the defeat of Giles had not been\r\nmentioned. Infamous![736] ‘Marat’ proposed satirical resolutions\r\ndeclaring ‘highly reprehensible’ every official ‘who by integrity,\r\ntalents, and important services ... conciliates the esteem and\r\naffections of the people.’[737] Hamilton had come out pure gold, wrote a\r\nPhiladelphian to a citizen of Rhode Island. ‘The more it is rubbed, the\r\nmore it will shine.’[738] A writer in the ‘Connecticut Gazette’ was\r\nmoved to a frenzy of indignation. ‘Dutch Republicans murdered De Witt\r\nand ate his heart. Republicans banished Aristides, the first, and\r\ncondemned Socrates to Hemlock. And yet we have confined the punishment\r\nof eminent services and ability to attempts to degrade them from office\r\nby innuendoes, electioneering slanders, and newspaper detraction. This\r\nhowever may be the prelude to eating and banishing.’[739] A traveler in\r\nthe Southern States wrote of the effect of the investigation in\r\nVirginia. It had ‘opened the eyes of many who have hitherto been under\r\nthe explicit direction of a certain would-be umpire of the United\r\nStates.’[740] He found that prejudice had been created against Hamilton\r\non the ground that he ‘had not done as much as he ought to assist\r\ncertain needy men to their claims for services,’ but he was pleased to\r\nfind that ‘the unjust prejudice against the industrious patriot is\r\ndecreasing daily.’[741]\r\n\r\nEverything possible was done to make Hamilton’s vindication a veritable\r\ntriumph. When the Providence Society of New York met at Haut’s Tavern\r\nfor a dinner, the toast, ‘The Secretary of the Treasury--may his\r\ndistinguished talents and integrity command universal respect,’ was\r\nreceived with shouts and the clicking of glasses.\r\n\r\nBut the Jeffersonians were unimpressed. ‘After all,’ they said, Hamilton\r\n‘acknowledges the freedom taken with appropriations and strives to work\r\nout an apology, rather than a justification.’[742] A week later, the\r\n‘National Gazette’ presented an analysis of the vote of which the\r\nJeffersonians were to make much. Vindication, indeed!--and by whom?\r\nThree were directors of Hamilton’s National Bank. Fifteen or twenty were\r\nreputed to be stockholders in the same institution. ‘Can these men be\r\nadmitted as judges--men who in fact are parties to the cause?’[743] All\r\nover the land the Jeffersonians were making it uncomfortable for many\r\nmembers who had voted to vindicate, and the Kentuckians soon had\r\nChristopher Greenup begging for a suspension of judgment until he could\r\nexplain.[744] ‘Vindicated!’ cried the Hamiltonians. ‘Yes, and by whom?’\r\nanswered the Jeffersonians. ‘By Bank directors, by Bank stockholders who\r\nprofited, by congressional speculators in the funds.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThus the Jeffersonians sought to explain their defeat and even turn it\r\nto account. The master mind among them expressed no surprise at the\r\nresult. He drew up a list of the members who had voted the vindication,\r\nindicating which owned Bank stock and which speculated in the funds.\r\nWhen Jefferson journeyed back to renew his strength and courage on his\r\nbeloved hill, others of his party followed. A little later there was a\r\nmovement of the leaders to the country home of John Taylor of Caroline\r\nat Port Royal, Virginia, where the conferences were continued. Thither\r\nwent Giles, Senator Hawkins of North Carolina, and Nathaniel Macon. The\r\nmaster of Port Royal was a remarkable character, an ardent Republican,\r\nan earnest champion of the agricultural interests, a robust, original\r\nthinker with something of the political philosopher, an able writer, a\r\ndignified though reluctant Senator. His mind ran much in the same groove\r\nwith Jefferson’s and Madison’s, both of whom were anxious to enlist him\r\nmore actively in their fight.\r\n\r\nJust what occurred at the conferences that summer is not known. A few\r\nmonths later, however, the probable fruit of the discussions appeared in\r\nPhiladelphia in the publication of a startling pamphlet, ‘An Examination\r\nof the Late Proceedings of Congress Respecting the Official Conduct of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury.’ Here in an analysis of the vote the\r\ncharge that interested parties had furnished the majority was not only\r\nmade, but names were given. Of the thirty-five supporters of Hamilton,\r\ntwenty-one were set down as stockholders or dealers in the funds, and\r\nthree as Bank directors. Referring to the fervent declaration of Smith\r\nof Charleston that Hamilton was as free from taint ‘as the purest angel\r\nin Heaven,’ the author of the pamphlet commented that ‘it is well known\r\nthat [Smith] holds between three and four hundred shares in the Bank of\r\nthe United States, and has obtained discounts, ad libitum.’ As for\r\nHamilton’s reports, they contained vindications of his conduct ‘in\r\ncertain particulars relative to which no charge had been brought\r\nforward.’ His explanation of the shuffling of appropriations was\r\nunimpressive. A deficiency in the appropriation? ‘In such event it\r\nbecomes his duty to state the fact simply and correctly to the\r\nLegislature, that they might, in turn, furnish fresh and additional\r\nfunds.’ Hamilton had done nothing of the sort. He had treated the House\r\nwith contempt and violated the law.\r\n\r\nHere was clearly the answer of the Jeffersonians to the vote of the\r\nHouse. It found its way to every city, town, and hamlet, to the cabin in\r\nthe Kentucky clearing, to the mansion of the master of many slaves on\r\nthe river James, to the pioneers about Fort Pitt on the far frontier.\r\nJohn Taylor of Caroline had struck his blow.[745]\r\n\r\nThus the congressional battle merely served to accentuate the\r\ndifferences of the parties. It marked, in great measure, the close of\r\nthe purely fiscal phase of the struggle. Neither Jefferson nor Madison\r\nwas qualified to cross swords with Hamilton in the field of finance.\r\nGiles was hopelessly inadequate. A little later, a Jeffersonian leader\r\nwas to join them whose genius as a financier would be as far above all\r\nthe Federalists, save Hamilton alone, as Hamilton was superior to Giles,\r\nbut he was still waiting in the wings for Fate to give the cue for his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nEven as Taylor wrote, a new issue had appeared, made to order for the\r\npurposes of Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nÇA IRA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nUp to this time Jefferson had been fighting under a disadvantage. In the\r\nfield of finance he was unable to cope on equal terms with his great\r\nprotagonist. The mass of the people were not consciously concerned with\r\nthe Hamiltonian policies, few comparatively had been swindled by the\r\nspeculators, and, while they resented their neighbors’ sudden\r\nacquisition of wealth, it was not easy to capitalize their discontent.\r\n\r\nThen the French Revolution entered a more dramatic stage, captivating\r\nthe imagination of the multitude. As the real significance of the\r\nstruggle began to take form, with the crowned heads of the Old World\r\nmarching in serried ranks under the leadership of Brunswick on the\r\nFrench frontier, the excitement was electric; and when they were turned\r\nback by the gallant resistance of the Revolutionists the floodgates of\r\nenthusiasm broke. One prolonged, triumphant shout went up from the\r\nmasses. The ‘people of no particular importance’ somehow felt that the\r\nvictory was theirs. They had been a little indifferent, these men of the\r\nshops, taverns, wharves, and the frontier, over the disputed financial\r\nand economic policies of their country, but they could understand the\r\nmeaning of ‘liberty, equality, fraternity.’ It meant democracy. Thus the\r\nnews of the French victories shook the bells in the New York steeples,\r\nTammany celebrated with song, shout, and speech in her wigwam, and the\r\nbung was knocked out of the barrel of illiterate oratory in the beer\r\nsaloons. These ‘people of no importance’ had been inarticulate, and they\r\nwere moved to eloquence. They had found a cause they believed their\r\ncause--the cause of the people against privilege.[746] The enthusiasm\r\nswept over the country, and the scenes of riotous joy at Mr. Grant’s\r\nfountain tavern in Baltimore[747] were imitated at Plymouth, Princeton,\r\nFredericksburg, Norfolk, Savannah, Charleston, Boston, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn Boston there was a salute of cannon at the castle, and a picturesque\r\nprocession moved, fluttering French and American flags, bearing a\r\nroasted ox of a thousand weight for the barbecue and a hogshead of punch\r\nto wash it down, while girls and women waved from the windows, boys\r\nshouted from the roofs, and the frenzied throng roared approval to the\r\neloquence of Charles Jarvis, the Jeffersonian leader, and to the\r\nRevolutionary poem by ‘Citizen’ Joseph Croswell.[748] The cheers of\r\nBoston were echoed back from Charleston, where the artillery boomed in\r\nthe day, mingling its thunder with the bells of Saint Michael’s. Only\r\n‘the pen of a Burke could describe the scene on State Street’ packed\r\nwith exultant humanity, with men looking down from the chimney-tops,\r\nwhile ‘bevies of amiable and beautiful women’ blessed the marchers with\r\ntheir smiles from the balconies of the houses.[749] On to Saint Philip’s\r\ntramped the crowd for religious exercises, for these men were not\r\nanarchists or criminals, but decent citizens, moved to the depths by the\r\ndefeat of the persecutors of France.[750]\r\n\r\nAnd observing the unprecedented enthusiasm from his quiet corner, Thomas\r\nJefferson rejoiced. At length the masses were politically awake, and the\r\nenemies of democracy had their answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe issues precipitated by the French Revolution had everything to do\r\nwith American politics--inevitably so. There were sentimental reasons\r\nfor the popular enthusiasm for the nation that had served America with\r\nmen and money; and there were economic reasons for the opposition in the\r\nfact that the great merchants operated on English credit. But the\r\npolitical significance of the divisions soon to appear have been\r\npersistently written down, where they should be written up.\r\n\r\nWith some exceptions the Hamiltonian leaders were hostile to the\r\npurposes of the French Revolution from the beginning. Here was a rising\r\nof the people with a claim to power, and the keynote of Federalist\r\npolicies was distrust of the people; here was defiance of ‘authority,’\r\nand they were sticklers for constituted authority; here was a\r\nchallenging of privilege, and they honestly believed in privilege; here\r\nwas democracy, and they hated it. They were against it, just as Burke\r\nwas against it, because it was an iconoclastic movement, a trampling on\r\ntradition. The death of the King, the slaughtering by the guillotine,\r\nthe stupidity and infamy of Genêt, the intemperance of the American\r\n‘Jacobin clubs,’ the defiance of Washington’s proclamation--on these\r\nthey were to seize to neutralize or destroy the popularity of the\r\nRevolution, but it was the proclaimed principles of the Revolution that\r\nthey hated.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, where the Hamiltonians were dominant, this was evident\r\nfrom the beginning. As early as December, 1790, when the resolutions of\r\ncondolence adopted by the National Assembly on the death of Franklin\r\nwere submitted to the Senate, Adams, in reading the letter from the\r\nPresident of that body which accompanied them, referred sarcastically to\r\nthe writer’s titles, apropos of the action of the Assembly in abolishing\r\ntitles of nobility.[751] A few weeks later Oliver Ellsworth and Rufus\r\nKing, the ablest Federalists in the Senate, openly denounced the French,\r\nand ridiculed their claims upon American gratitude, and when Maclay made\r\nindignant protest, Ellsworth, taking snuff, pretended not to hear, Adams\r\ntalked audibly with Otis the secretary, and other Senators gathered in\r\ngroups to talk aloud. As early as February, 1791, the Hamiltonians in\r\nthe Senate were in no mood to listen to a defense of France.[752] Even\r\nthe concession of a constitution by Louis XVI was resented by the\r\nsenatorial fathers of the Federalist persuasion. The more democratic\r\nHouse adopted a reply praising ‘the wisdom and magnanimity’ shown in its\r\nformation and acceptance, but when it reached the Senate, George Cabot\r\nobjected to the word ‘magnanimity,’ Ellsworth supported him, the\r\nFederalists voted accordingly, and it was stricken out. ‘Too many\r\nFrenchmen, like too many Americans, panting for equality of persons and\r\nproperty,’ grumbled Adams as early as April, 1790.[753] ‘We differed in\r\nopinion on the French Revolution,’ wrote Adams in retrospect to\r\nJefferson many years later.[754] Adams and Hamilton, King and Ellsworth,\r\nCabot and Ames, Jay and Bingham, looked with mingled cynicism and alarm\r\nupon the Revolution from the moment it began to take on a popular\r\ncharacter and to aim at the destruction of privilege.\r\n\r\nJefferson was just as ardent in its support. He knew the miserable state\r\nto which the feudalistic institutions of the Bourbons had reduced the\r\nmasses of the people. He had seen justice bought and sold in France on\r\nthe auction block, the operations of the hideous game laws that threw\r\nopen the peasants’ fields to the trampling of the horses of the\r\naristocracy, the bestial poverty of the poor, the insulting of their\r\nwives and the debauching of their daughters, with justice open-eyed and\r\nleering. He knew the wantonness of Versailles, the drunkenness of the\r\nKing, the profligacy of the Queen, and he had no illusions as to the\r\ndignity of the law or the righteousness of the authority in France. He\r\nhad sat at the table with some of the noblest minds in that country\r\nplanning the regeneration of a society that was rotten to the core.\r\n\r\nBut, more important to him, he was persuaded that the fate of the\r\nAmerican experiment was bound up with the success of the French\r\nRevolution. From this opinion he was never to deviate one hair’s\r\nbreadth.[755] In January, 1792, he had instructed the American Minister\r\nin Paris that, if circumstances forced an expression as to the French\r\nGovernment, it should be ‘in conformity with the sentiments of the great\r\nmass of our countrymen, who, having first in modern times taken the\r\nground of government founded on the will of the people, cannot but be\r\ndelighted at seeing so distinguished ... a nation arrive on the same\r\nground and plant their standard by our side.’[756] A little later he\r\nreminded the American Minister in London that ‘we certainly cannot deny\r\nto other nations that principle whereon our government is founded, that\r\nevery nation has a right to govern itself internally under what forms it\r\npleases, and to change these forms at its own will.’[757]\r\n\r\nThus, Jefferson was in sympathy with the purposes of the French\r\nRevolution, and the Hamiltonians were hostile. To Jefferson it meant\r\nrepublicanism, democracy, the end of privilege--and he wished it well;\r\nto the Hamiltonians it meant democracy--and they wished it ill. When the\r\ndespots of Europe combined to crush it and force a degenerate king and\r\ncourt on the bowed backs of the people, Jefferson’s heart was with the\r\nuntrained boys rushing to the defense of the frontiers; the heart of the\r\nHamiltonians was with the combination of the kings. And because the\r\nmasses of the American people were in sympathy with the French,\r\nJefferson rode on the crest of the wave in the closing days of 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the execution of the King, the political enemies of the Revolution,\r\nsimulating shock, ventured into the open. Fenno eagerly seized upon the\r\nmore graphic stories of the execution in the London papers and published\r\nthem in full, and soon he was printing sympathetic poems on the\r\nevent.[758] But the friends of the Revolution were not easily moved to\r\ncompassion, and one of the theaters in Philadelphia revived the play\r\n‘Cato’ to the noisy acclaim of frenzied partisans. The actors appeared\r\nbefore the curtain to sing ‘La Marseillaise,’ and the audience rose to\r\njoin lustily in the chorus. Night after night this was repeated. The\r\nPittsburgh ‘Gazette’ published a brutal pæan under the caption, ‘Louis\r\nCapet has lost his Caput,’ and this was copied throughout the\r\ncountry.[759] But these more savage bursts of glee did not meet with\r\ngeneral approval, for when the news of Louis’s fate reached Providence\r\nthe people ‘fell into an immediate state of dejection, and in the\r\nevening all the bells of the churches tolled.’[760] Many put on\r\nmourning, and ‘Cordelia’ announced her purpose to wear, in mourning for\r\nthe martyred King, a black rose near the left breast, and ‘entreated her\r\ndearly beloved sisters ... to follow her example.’[761] For a time the\r\nreaction was so pronounced as to threaten the popularity of the\r\nRevolution, and it seemed that half the Nation had turned monarchists\r\novernight.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats were infuriated to find that the reaction was not confined\r\nto the fashionable houses, but extended to the people in the streets.\r\nEven from New Bedford came the protest that ‘the advocates of monarchy’\r\nand ‘crocodile humanity defenders’ were insisting that ‘the succors from\r\nFrance ... proceeded wholly from Louis,’ and that he had really wished\r\nFrenchmen to be free.[762] A citizen of Charleston was disgusted to see\r\nhow ‘the death of one man’ could ‘so affect the generality of the\r\npeople’ of his city. ‘They burst forth in the most vehement invectives\r\n... against the whole French nation--forgetting the thousands that said\r\nking had directly or indirectly been the cause of their death.’[763] An\r\n‘Old Soldier’ in Philadelphia was shocked to find that ‘beer houses,\r\ntaverns and places of public resort are filled with panegyrics upon the\r\nmeasures of the British administration, and our good allies, the French,\r\nare branded with every felonious epithet.’[764] And why all this fuss?\r\nHad not letters been received from one who had witnessed the execution\r\nwith the assurance that ‘everything was conducted with the greatest\r\ndecency,’ and had not the writer, traveling over France ‘found the\r\npeople quiet and generally approving of the public measures?’[765] Thus\r\nthe debate raged in drinking-places, on the streets, in the highways, in\r\nthe counting--and drawing-rooms--the enemies of the principles of the\r\nRevolution perking up and taking heart and seeming in the ascendant for\r\na few days.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what of the leaders?\r\n\r\nThe Federalists were delighted with the reaction. Jefferson observed\r\nthat the ladies of Philadelphia ‘of the first circle are open-mouthed\r\nagainst the murder of a sovereign, and generally speak those sentiments\r\nwhich their more cautious husbands smother.’ Tennant, the French\r\nMinister, at length ‘openly hoisted the flag of monarchy by going into\r\ndeep mourning for his prince,’ and discontinued his visits to Jefferson,\r\nwho interpreted it as ‘a necessary accompaniment to this pious duty.’\r\nMore significant to the keen-eyed politician was the observation that ‘a\r\nconnection between him and Hamilton seems to be springing up.’[766]\r\nWithout indecent manifestations of pleasure over the King’s death,\r\nJefferson found some satisfaction with the tendency to render ‘monarchs\r\namenable to punishment like any other criminal.’[767] Madison was quite\r\nas unresponsive to pity. ‘If he was a traitor he ought to be punished\r\nlike any other man,’ he wrote Jefferson.[768] If these clever\r\npoliticians were not impressed with the cries of commiseration, it was\r\ndue to their appraisement of the noise. It was the first plausible and\r\nsafe opportunity for the enemies of French democracy to denounce the\r\nmovement they despised, and they made the most of it. Even so, for a few\r\ndays the Hamiltonians were riding the crest of the wave.\r\n\r\nThen another sea change.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGeorge III had joined the Coalition of the Kings, and the familiar\r\nredcoats were marching with the rest to crush the Revolution, and\r\ndemocracy. Here was something the masses could understand--monarchy\r\nagainst republicanism, autocracy and aristocracy against democracy,\r\nkings against people. The plain man of ‘no particular importance’ looked\r\nabout to see the effect. Yes, the old Tories who had hobnobbed with the\r\nBritish officers while the ragged Continentals walked barefoot through\r\nthe snows of Valley Forge were partisans of England--against France. The\r\nduty of the patriot was clear--France against England. The cry was\r\nspontaneous with the masses, and rent the heavens. Even then we owed a\r\ndebt to Lafayette. Poor imbecile Louis was forgotten, the guillotine\r\nfaded from the view. ‘Ça Ira!’ Even the children of Philadelphia had\r\nlearned enough French to sing ‘La Marseillaise,’ and they sang it right\r\nlustily even before the windows of the Binghams. Did we not have a\r\ntreaty with France that we had been glad to sign? Was not our own\r\nexistence involved in the European struggle now? The Republic of France\r\ncrushed by the allied monarchs to-day--our turn to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAnd the partisans of England--who were they? The old American Tories,\r\nthe rich merchants operating on English capital, the crooked speculators\r\nfawning on the money-lenders of Europe, the aristocrats kow-towing to\r\nthe roués of a degenerate nobility in the homes of the moneyed\r\naristocracy, the politicians who excluded the poor man from the polls.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the English declaration of war was magical. Again the old\r\n‘rabble’ that precipitated the American Revolution poured into the\r\nstreets, swarmed into the saloons, formed into processions and marched.\r\nAnd why not? England was still our enemy, impressing our seamen,\r\nretaining our western posts in defiance of the treaty, playing havoc\r\nwith our commerce. Were the pioneers on the fringe of the western\r\nforests in daily danger of the tomahawk? England was responsible--so\r\nmost of the argument ran. Now was the time to stand up and be\r\ncounted--for the two republics or the Coalition of the Kings. Thus the\r\nreasoning, and it caught on and flashed and flamed like a conflagration\r\nsweeping the sun-parched grass of the plains.\r\n\r\nTo Hamilton this new burst of frenzied friendship for the French was\r\nalarming. Washington was at Mount Vernon. His immediate presence in\r\nPhiladelphia was imperatively needed. He and he alone could stem the\r\nrising tide. It was setting in heavily against the English. On April\r\n8th, Hamilton sat at his desk writing his chief a confirmation of the\r\nwar between England and France with the sly comment that ‘the whole\r\ncurrent of commercial intelligence ... indicates thus far an\r\nunexceptionable conduct on the part of the English Government toward the\r\nvessels of the United States.’ This, he added, ‘is received here with\r\nvery great satisfaction as favorable to the continuance of peace ...\r\nwhich may be said to be both universal and ardent.’\r\n\r\nAs his pen traveled over the paper the ‘rabble’ was shouting for war in\r\nthe streets, and Jefferson was expressing the hope that the English\r\ninterference with our vessels would ‘not force us into war.’ If he could\r\nonly have looked over his rival’s shoulder as he wrote!\r\n\r\nWashington hastened back to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHe immediately gathered his Cabinet about him for a momentous decision.\r\nGenêt, young, dashing, audacious, had arrived in Charleston and would\r\nsoon present his credentials as the Minister of the French Republic. He\r\nmight even refer to the treaty in which we had pledged ourselves to\r\nguarantee the French possessions in the West Indies, and to throw open\r\nthe ports of America to the prizes of the privateers of our ally while\r\nclosing them to her enemies. It was a treaty we had been delighted to\r\nget, and now it rose to plague us--but there it was. Worse still, the\r\npeople in the streets understood the nature of the pledge.\r\n\r\nIt was not Hamilton’s way to concede to Jefferson a primacy where\r\nforeign relations were involved, and he had not been inactive while\r\nawaiting the return of Washington. Jay and King had been consulted\r\nparticularly as to the receiving of Genêt. Neither could find any\r\npretext for refusing to receive him; both thought he should be received\r\nwith qualifications. Uppermost in the minds of all three was the\r\ntreaty--the necessity of evading its obligations.[769] Having decided on\r\nthe policy of Jefferson’s department, Hamilton took no chances, and\r\nprepared the list of questions to be submitted to the Cabinet, which\r\nWashington copied in his own handwriting, but Jefferson was not deceived\r\nas to the authorship.[770] There were no illusions on Jefferson’s part\r\nas to his position that April day in the room in the Morris house. There\r\nwas Hamilton, eager, not a little domineering, who had prepared\r\nWashington’s questions on which the Secretary of State had not been\r\nconsulted; and Knox, big, pudgy, a bit flamboyant, complacent, and proud\r\nof his utter subserviency to Hamilton; and Randolph, with a legalistic\r\nmind capable of refining away any position he might take.\r\n\r\nShould Genêt be received?\r\n\r\nYes, said Hamilton, with qualifications. Yes, said Jefferson,\r\nunqualifiedly. Yes, with qualifications, said Knox, dutifully echoing\r\nHamilton, and, says Jefferson, ‘acknowledging at the same time, like the\r\nfool he is, that he knew nothing about it.’[771] Randolph agreed with\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nLet him be received, said Hamilton, with the distinct understanding that\r\nwe must reserve for future consideration the binding force of the\r\ntreaties. There was no proof that Louis had been guilty, and evidence\r\nthat the republicans in France had actually premeditated a plan to get\r\nrid of monarchical power.[772] There was no proof that the execution was\r\nan act of national justice, and all the courts in Europe held a\r\ndifferent view.[773] In truth, ‘almost all Europe ... seems likely to be\r\narmed ... with the intention of restoring ... the royalty in the\r\nsuccessor of the deceased monarch.’[774] If our treaty obligations\r\nproved disadvantageous, we should have the right to renounce them.[775]\r\nRespect the right of a nation to change its form of government? Yes.\r\nReceive its ambassador? Yes. But to throw our weight into the scale for\r\nthe new republic might be lacking ‘in national delicacy and\r\ndecorum.’[776] As to our obligations under the treaty, there were none,\r\nfor France was waging an offensive war. The coalition of the monarchs to\r\ncrush the republic forced the war? Perhaps--but France made the first\r\nformal declaration of hostilities.[777]\r\n\r\nJefferson approached the question from a diametrically opposite point of\r\nview. ‘The reception of the Minister at all,’ he said, ‘is an\r\nacknowledgment of the legitimacy of their government; and if the\r\nqualifications meditated are to deny that legitimacy, it will be a\r\ncurious compound which is to deny and admit the same thing.’ The\r\nabrogation of the treaties? ‘I consider the people who constitute a\r\nsociety as the source of all authority in that nation,’ he said: ‘as\r\nfree to transact their common concerns by any agents they think proper;\r\nto change these agents individually, or the organization of them in form\r\nor function whenever they please; that all the acts done by these agents\r\nunder the authority of the nation, are obligatory to them and inure to\r\ntheir use, and can in no wise be annulled or affected by any change in\r\nthe form of government.... Consequently the treaties between the United\r\nStates and France were not treaties between the United States and Louis\r\nCapet, but between the two nations of America and France; and the\r\nnations remaining in existence, though both of them have since changed\r\ntheir forms of government, the treaties are not annulled by these\r\nchanges.’[778] All the Cabinet agreed to a proclamation forbidding\r\nAmericans from participating in the war, to the unqualified reception of\r\nGenêt while holding the treaties in abeyance, and to the issuing of a\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of the proclamation, the storm broke.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThis had seemed inevitable to Jefferson from the beginning.[779]\r\nMadison, then in Virginia, wrote that the proclamation ‘wounds the\r\nnational honor by seeming to disregard the stipulated duties to France,’\r\nand ‘wounds the popular feeling by a seeming indifference to the cause\r\nof liberty.’[780]\r\n\r\nThe party issue was made. The Hamiltonians were sympathetic toward\r\nmonarchical France, hostile to revolutionary France, friendly to\r\nEngland; the Jeffersonians were friendly to revolutionary France,\r\nhostile to the Bourbons, and unfriendly to the policy of Pitt in\r\nEngland. The heart of the Hamiltonians beat in tune to the martial steps\r\nof the Coalition of the Kings marching on the French frontier; that of\r\nthe Jeffersonians was with the French peasants hurrying to defend their\r\nsoil and revolution. And the overwhelming sentiment of the Nation was\r\nwith Jefferson.\r\n\r\nInstantly the Democratic masses saw in the coming of Genêt the\r\nopportunity for the manifestation of their feelings. There was much in\r\nthe personality, appearance, and background of this ardent diplomat of\r\nthe Gironde to explain the fervent enthusiasm with which he was\r\nreceived. Washington had been warned in advance by Morris, the Minister\r\nto France, that he was an ‘upstart’--not a bad estimate, as it turned\r\nout, but the President had abundant proof that all the French\r\nrepublicans were upstarts.[781] He was not an upstart, however, in that\r\nhe did not belong in the great world of high politics and society. For\r\nalmost half a century his father had been in the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, and his celebrated sister, Madame Campan, had been one of the\r\nladies of Marie Antoinette, of whom he had been a prime favorite. A\r\nfamiliar figure among the fashionable young dandies of Versailles, he\r\nhad served for a while as the secretary of one of the brothers of the\r\nmonarch. An extraordinarily brilliant youth, he had translated the\r\n‘History of Eric XIV’ at the age of twelve, with historical notes of his\r\nown. Entering the diplomatic service, with the blessings of the Queen,\r\nhe had served as attaché at the courts of Berlin, Vienna, London, and\r\nSt. Petersburg. He spoke several languages with the fluency of a native.\r\nA romantic figure, this young man, handsome, elegant in manner, eloquent\r\nand entertaining in conversation, gracious, friendly, impulsive, with\r\nthe virtues to neutralize the vices of his years.\r\n\r\nIf the reception he received in the aristocratic city of Charleston was\r\nenough to turn his head, it was nothing to the continuous ovation\r\naccorded him as he proceeded slowly on his month’s journey to\r\nPhiladelphia. Farmers flocked to the rough roads to cheer him and offer\r\nhim produce at a loss. In every town he was a conquering hero, and\r\neverywhere he was greeted with the strains of ‘Ça Ira’ and orators paid\r\ntribute to France and the principles of its Revolution. The ringing of\r\nbells, the shouting of the multitude wearing liberty caps and waving\r\nFrench flags--such the sights and sounds that greeted him everywhere.\r\nNor was this charming young diplomat pleasing to the Democratic rabble\r\nalone. At Baltimore, Justice Iredell of the Supreme Court was impressed\r\nwith his ‘fine open countenance, and pleasing unaffected manner.’[782]\r\nFederalist Iredell failed to find the ‘upstart’ who was so conspicuous\r\nto Federalist Morris.\r\n\r\nAs the reports of the continuous ovation dribbled into Philadelphia,\r\nHamilton and the Federalists were alarmed and disgusted, Jefferson\r\ndelighted. Here was proof that the people were sound in their\r\nrepublicanism. Better still, here were the masses making themselves felt\r\nin public affairs for the first time. Even better, they were casting\r\naside the spirit of humility, and standing erect with their sovereignty\r\nunder their hats. While Genêt was proceeding to the capital, Jefferson\r\nwas writing joyously to Monroe of the ‘old spirit of ‘76 rekindling the\r\nnewspapers from Boston to Charleston’ and forcing ‘the monocrat papers\r\n... to publish the most furious philippics against England.’[783] And\r\nMadison was quite as pleased. He had hoped for a reception that would\r\nmake ‘the cant of the cities’ and the ‘cold caution of the Government’\r\nless offensive.[784]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Genêt approached, the Democrats in Philadelphia,\r\nsuspecting that the Government hoped ‘to prevent a joyful reception,’\r\nwere determined to disappoint that hope. ‘An Old Soldier,’ in a stirring\r\nreminder of French services in the American Revolution, declared that\r\n‘if after such recollections you will hesitate to welcome their\r\nambassador, I will mourn over the departed virtue of my country.’[785]\r\n\r\nThe appeal was not made in vain. Freneau and Bache in their papers were\r\narousing the emotions of the people. The former was publishing Grey’s\r\nspeech in Parliament against going to war with France. ‘A shining\r\ncharacter,’ thought the editor.[786] He was also informing his readers\r\nthat the news of our neutrality ‘gave much satisfaction to the English\r\nnation.’[787] Meanwhile, the ‘rabble,’ embracing such characters as\r\nRittenhouse, Dr. Hutchinson, and A. J. Dallas, was making preparations.\r\nThe Minister would be met at Gray’s Ferry, and every one who possibly\r\ncould should go. The cannon on _L’Ambascade_ would roar the\r\nannouncements of the hero’s approach early enough to permit all who\r\nwished to reach the Ferry in time.[788]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that a strange rumor was floating about the streets,\r\ntaverns, and beer-houses of the city. Count de Noailles had arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia at nine o’clock on the night of May 3d, commissioned as\r\nMinister by the former Princes at Coblentz, and at a very late hour at\r\nnight had been received by Washington at the Morris house where the two\r\n‘were in private conversation until near morning.’ The Count had\r\narrived--every one knew it. What sort of treachery was this? So this was\r\nthe reason the Government was trying to discourage the reception to\r\nGenêt.[789] The people would see to that.\r\n\r\nThus, Genêt was met at Gray’s Ferry by an immense throng with thunderous\r\ncheers--cheers that accompanied him all the way to the City Tavern. The\r\nstreets packed, throbbing with joy. Looking out over the excited\r\nmultitude, Genêt ‘was quite overcome with the affectionate joy that\r\nappeared on every face,’ according to a lady of Philadelphia who shared\r\nit. ‘It is true,’ she said, ‘that a few disaffected persons did try to\r\ncheck the ardor of the people, but they had the mortification to find\r\nall their efforts blasted and were obliged themselves to join the\r\ngeneral torrent and affect a cordiality ... contrary to the feelings of\r\ntheir hearts.’ A truly inspiring spectacle. ‘It would be impossible, my\r\ndear, to give you any idea of the scene.’[790] Then followed the formal\r\nwelcome. Resolutions were prepared at the home of Charles Biddle, were\r\nadopted enthusiastically at an immense meeting in the State House\r\nyard--then on in a body to the City Tavern, Biddle leading the way and\r\nsetting a merry pace. Ever and anon he received a frantic plea from Dr.\r\nHutchinson, ‘fat enough to act the character of Falstaff without\r\nstuffing,’ to slow up, and with sardonic humor Biddle hurried on. The\r\ncorpulent doctor reached the hotel in a state of complete exhaustion.\r\nBut it was worth it. ‘Ça Ira!’ Long live the French Republic and\r\ndamnation to its foes![791] Then the dinner at O’Eller’s, the finest the\r\ncity had ever seen, at four dollars a plate, with Genêt thrilling the\r\ndiners by singing the French fighting song, the audience roaring ‘Ça\r\nIra,’ liberty caps passing around, toasts fervent and fiery. ‘What\r\nhugging and rugging!’ grumbled a Philadelphian a quarter of a century\r\nlater. ‘What addressing and caressing! What mountebanking and chanting\r\nwith liberty caps and the other wretched trumpery of sans-culotte\r\nfoolery!’[792] When Genêt called on Jefferson, he was cordially\r\nreceived, but there was a drop in temperature when he presented his\r\ncredentials to Washington, whose sober and restrained manner seemed cold\r\nto the Frenchman after the reception from the people. Worse still, he\r\nfound portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in the room. Enough,\r\nquite enough, had been done to turn the head of a stronger character\r\nthan he. But the Philadelphia lady was right--many who hated the\r\nRevolution simulated enthusiasm, and one day Knox, Bingham, and other\r\nleading Federalists might have been seen going aboard _L’Ambascade_ with\r\nGenêt to partake of a fraternal dinner.[793]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThus the popular protest against neutrality between England and France\r\nrose in a crescendo to a scream. Be patient with England? scoffed a\r\nBoston writer. What, with the western posts still held, the Indian wars,\r\nthe impressment of American sailors on the sea?[794] The country’s\r\ngrievances against the English were mobilized and marched to the\r\naccompaniment of hisses. A resident of Pittsburgh wrote an open letter\r\nto Washington against neutrality. ‘I doubt much whether it is the\r\ndisposition of the United States to preserve the condition you enjoin.\r\nIt may be the disposition of those who draw from funds but from no one\r\nelse.’[795] Thus encouraged, ‘Veritas’ grasped his pen. ‘I am aware,\r\nsir, that some court satellites may have deceived you’--not difficult to\r\nimpose on a ruler ‘particularly if so much buoyed up by official\r\nimportance as to think it beneath his dignity to mix occasionally with\r\nthe people.’[796] Freneau, who began to print a series of satirical\r\npoems attacking Washington, sardonically sent two copies of each issue\r\nto his desk. The great man fumed, fretted, occasionally burst into rage.\r\n‘Civic’ launched his thunderbolts against ‘incendiaries ... who have\r\nlately outraged decency ... by insulting Washington,’[797] and Fenno\r\nrushed to the defense with stupid denunciations of all critics as\r\nanarchists and traitors. The men in the streets jeered their\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nThus, the summer of 1793 was one of utter madness. Mechanics were\r\nreading the speeches of Mirabeau; clerks were poring over the reports of\r\nrevolutionary chiefs; college students were finding Paine preferable to\r\nVirgil; and even the women were reading, with flushed cheeks, Barlow’s\r\n‘Conspiracy of Kings.’ Others too illiterate to read were stalking the\r\nnarrow streets like conquerors, jostling the important men of the\r\ncommunity with intent, and sneering at the great. Men were equal. The\r\npeople’s day had dawned. Down the streets swaggered the mob looking for\r\nlingering relics of royalty to tear or order down. A medallion enclosing\r\na bas-relief of George III with his crown, on the eastern front of\r\nChrist’s Church, caught its eye. Down with it! The church officials did\r\nnot hesitate, but tore it down. On swept the mob in search of other\r\nworlds to conquer. Occasionally the lower element, drinking itself\r\ndrunk, staggered out of the beer-houses to shout imprecations on a\r\ngovernment that would not war on England.\r\n\r\nNot wholly without provocation, these outbursts. Fenno’s fulsome\r\nsnobbery was disgusting to people of sense, and the English sailors in\r\nPhiladelphia did not help. When four of these jolly tars attacked and\r\nall but murdered a lone French sailor without a rebuke from the city\r\nofficials, Bache’s paper warned that the friends of the French would\r\n‘take signal vengeance on such infamous banditti.’ When, in New York,\r\nthe aristocrats of the ‘new and elegant coffee-house’ and the exclusive\r\nBelvedere Club were ‘swallowing potent draughts to the annihilation of\r\nliberty,’ notice was served that unless suppressed ‘a band of Mohawks,\r\nOneidas, and Senecas will take upon themselves that necessary duty’--for\r\nTammany was the very heart of the French movement in New York.[798] ‘Ça\r\nIra!’ The people were the masters, and even in the theaters they went to\r\ndictate to managers and actors. When Hodkinson, a favorite actor,\r\nappeared, as his rôle required, in the uniform of a British officer, he\r\nwas hissed. ‘Take it off!’ shouted the crowd; but when the quick-witted\r\nactor smilingly explained that he represented a bully, the jeers were\r\nturned to cheers.[799] On then with the play. The orchestras played ‘La\r\nMarseillaise,’ the galleries sang ‘Ça Ira,’ the managers shunted\r\nShakespeare and Sheridan aside for ‘Tyranny Suppressed,’ ‘Louis XVI,’\r\nand ‘The Demolition of the Bastile.’ In Boston, where the Federalists\r\nwere firm, the Boston Theater continued to cater to their tastes, but\r\neven there the Haymarket drew the greater crowds with drama for the\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nEverywhere liberty caps were worn and liberty poles were raised, and men\r\nand women became ‘Citizen’ and ‘Citizeness,’ while the Federalists\r\nroared their glee to keep up courage, making merry in their letters and\r\nthrough their papers at the expense of the ‘citness’:\r\n\r\n    ‘No citness to my name, I’ll have, says Kate,\r\n     Though Boston lads so much about it prate;\r\n     I’ve asked its meaning, and our Tom, the clown,\r\n     Says darn it ‘t means “woman of the town.”[800]\r\n\r\nFrom Hartford the witty Chauncey Goodrich wrote Wolcott that ‘our\r\ncitizenesses quite execrate their new name,’ and that while ‘they will\r\nhave no objection to being called biped in common with men, if it can\r\nclearly be shown that term denotes nothing above the foot or ankle, but\r\nas it comes so near they are suspicious of mischief.’[801] What a world!\r\nWhat a world ‘agog to be all equal to French barbers.’[802]\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, these Federalists ceased to grin, when Democratic Clubs,\r\nsuggestive of those of Paris, appeared like magic everywhere, differing\r\naccording to the community and character of their leadership. It was not\r\nriff-raff in Philadelphia where David Rittenhouse was president, but it\r\nwas sinister enough with its bold assertion that free men should ‘regard\r\nwith attention and discuss without fear the conduct of public\r\nservants.’[803] That at Norfolk summoned patriots to a courageous\r\nexpression of their sentiments in answer to ‘the tyrants of the world’\r\nunited ‘to crush the infant spirit of freedom’ in France.[804] Strangely\r\nenough, they were nowhere so extreme as in Charleston where the ‘Saint\r\nCecilia Society’ scorned the membership of plebeians or men in trade;\r\nand where Robert Goodloe Harper, fresh from the country and poor, rose\r\nrapidly to fame as the vice-president of the Jacobin Club, wearing a\r\n‘red rouge with great grace and dignity.’[805] And nowhere did they mean\r\nso much to the Jeffersonians as in New England where they were giving\r\npolitical importance to the masses. Even the Germans of Philadelphia\r\norganized to serve liberty and equality in their native tongue.[806]\r\n\r\nThe shrieks of protest from the Federalists against these clubs is\r\ninexplicable to the twentieth century. Like innumerable clubs for public\r\npurposes to-day, they were composed of the wise and foolish, the vicious\r\nand virtuous, but their purpose was to discuss and disseminate\r\ninformation on public affairs. Some then, as now, passed asinine\r\nresolutions, but that which alarmed the Hamiltonians was that they\r\ncreated power for the masses. Had not Fenno preached and preached that\r\nthe masses were to be ruled and satisfied? The merchants should have\r\ntheir Chambers of Commerce; the financiers and even speculators could\r\norganize to influence public action--but what right had the ‘man of no\r\nparticular importance’ to interfere?\r\n\r\nIn brief, these clubs were vicious because democratic. These ‘demoniacal\r\nsocieties,’ as Wolcott preferred to call them, were ‘nurseries of\r\nsedition’ because ‘they are formed for the avowed purpose of a general\r\ninfluence and control upon measures of government.’[807] It was\r\n‘sedition’ in those days for people of no special significance to hold\r\nviews in opposition to the policies of their rulers. It was the kind of\r\nsedition that Jefferson liked. From his home on the river he watched\r\ntheir organizations multiply and grow with a fond, hopeful interest.\r\nThey were his Citizens’ Training Camps where the army he was to lead to\r\nvictory was being trained for political war.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, how fared neutrality on the part of England and France? On\r\nthe part of Genêt, badly enough. Week by week some outrage was\r\ncommitted; and, worse still, the young fanatic was persuading himself of\r\nthe propriety of his actions. The cheers in the streets convinced him\r\nthat he could defy the President and appeal with safety to the people.\r\nHe could hear the comparatively few extremists because they shouted\r\nloudest. Day by day he was becoming more intolerable. Devoted to the\r\ncause of revolutionary France, Jefferson sought to curb the impetuosity\r\nof its Minister in the interest of the cause, but toward the latter part\r\nof June he was plainly worried.[808]\r\n\r\nThe British were as arrogant and impudent. Outrages on American ships\r\nand the impressment of American seamen were almost daily occurrences,\r\nand protests to the Government in London brought no response.[809]\r\n‘Ships stopped, insulted, searched; cargoes confiscated; seamen seized,\r\nimpressed, and thrown into jails; until Thomas Pinckney, the American\r\nMinister in London, was overwhelmed with his correspondence with Newgate\r\nJail--for the poor wretches there were begging him for succor he could\r\nnot give. He was met with a courteous smile and contemptuous\r\nindifference.’[810]\r\n\r\nIn American waters British as well as French were arming and equipping,\r\nand into American ports sailed English vessels with prizes taken in\r\ndirect violation of the treaty with France. Then came the Orders in\r\nCouncil of June 8th ordering British ships to capture and take to\r\nBritish ports all vessels with foodstuffs destined for France.\r\n\r\nOn the day before this Order went into effect, a goodly company of\r\nEnglish sympathizers met at Richardet’s Tavern in Philadelphia to\r\ncelebrate the birthday of George III. An elegant dinner, unmarred by the\r\npresence of any part of the ‘rabble,’ with a guest list reading like a\r\npage from a Social Register. Enthusiasm bubbled, and ‘Ça Ira’ was not\r\nsung. The orchestra played ‘God Save the King.’ That monarch was\r\ntoasted, and they toasted the Queen, and Hammond the British Minister,\r\nand Phineas Bond, the British Consul. They toasted Washington once and\r\n‘Neutrality’ twice. And they brought a perfect evening to a close with\r\nanother toast: ‘The Red Coats and Wooden Walls of Old England.’[811]\r\nFenno in the Federalist organ published a sympathetic account which was\r\nread with varying emotions from Mrs. Bingham’s library to the beer\r\nsaloon on Front Street. Even the soberest began to wonder if neutrality\r\nwas one-sided. Nowhere was neutrality appealing to the masses as just,\r\nwise, or fair.\r\n\r\nOne June morning, Washington drove out of Philadelphia in a phaëton and\r\npair for a fortnight’s visit home,[812] and six days later the first of\r\na brilliant and powerful series of articles by ‘Pacificus’ began to run\r\nin Fenno’s paper. By the light of the candles, Hamilton was rushing into\r\nthe breach with a pen that was mightier than a sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nNo one doubted the identity of ‘Pacificus.’ None but the man in the\r\nPemberton house was capable of such brilliancy, audacity, and dash in\r\ncontroversy. His purpose was twofold--to justify the Proclamation of\r\nNeutrality, and convince the people that they had greatly exaggerated\r\nthe services of France in the Revolution. In the first paper he defended\r\nthe constitutional right of the President to issue the Proclamation\r\nwithout a consultation with Congress. In the second he released the\r\ncountry from all treaty obligations on the ground that France was waging\r\nan offensive war. In the third he appealed to fear with the assertion\r\nthat if we sought to serve our ally we should be forced to wage war on\r\nthe sea against the combined fleets of the coalition. In the fifth he\r\ntreated the claims of France on American gratitude as trivial and\r\nabsurd.[813] In the sixth he paid a tribute to the stupid Louis,\r\nattacking the French people for executing their king. In the last he\r\nurged the timeliness and necessity of the Proclamation. Brilliant\r\nletters, mingling truth and sophistry, but readable--and they were read\r\nwith mingled emotions. Society was enchanted, the ‘mob’ roared, and even\r\nJefferson, who never made the Hamiltonian mistake of underestimating a\r\nfoe, was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen ‘Pacificus’ was appearing, Jefferson was summering under his plane\r\ntrees near Philadelphia, Madison was sweltering in his Virginia home,\r\nwishing nothing better than a release from political duties. As\r\nJefferson sat under the trees with Fenno’s paper before him, he\r\ninstantly appreciated the necessity of a reply, and he ordered Madison\r\nto the task. Nothing could have been more distasteful to the mild little\r\nman suffering ‘a distressing lassitude from the excessive and continued\r\nheat of the season,’ and with avowed reluctance he undertook the\r\ntask.[814] But in August, Madison’s replies were running in all the\r\npapers--forceful, spirited, rapid in reasoning, making telling points\r\nwith citations from Hamilton’s articles in ‘The Federalist.’[815] He\r\ndenied the power of the President to declare a treaty no longer\r\noperative. Proof? The best--Hamilton’s Number 75 of ‘The Federalist.’\r\nChallenge the right of a nation to abolish an old government and\r\nestablish a new? Why, it ‘is the only lawful tenure by which the United\r\nStates hold their existence as a nation.’\r\n\r\nBut the two sets of letters merely served to keep the discussion going.\r\nThe papers were doing their part. ‘This discussion must cease,’ wrote\r\nFenno. ‘The Government has said we must be neutral and the people have\r\nno right to question its wisdom.’ Freneau sniffed and snorted forth\r\nsatirical articles on the infallibility of rulers.[816] No writer\r\npresuming to castigate the democrats was spared. ‘Justice’ was pouring\r\nforth indignant eloquence against them. Ah, sneered Freneau--\r\n\r\n    ‘Because some pumpkin shells and lobster claws\r\n     Thrown o’er his garden wall by Braintree’s Duke,[817]\r\n     Have chanced to fall within your greedy jaws--\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Because some treasury luncheons you have gnawed\r\n     Like rats that play upon the public store ...’[818]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness intensified with the heat of the summer. A satirical\r\nletter ascribed to a Tory in Philadelphia to one in London rejoicing\r\nover the turn American affairs had taken, went the rounds of the\r\nDemocratic press. Washington was not spared. He ‘is well surrounded,\r\nwell advised.’ Hamilton moved the correspondent to rapture--‘that great\r\nprop of our cause, that intrepid enemy of liberty.’ Just read the third\r\nof the ‘Pacificus’ letters ‘and judge ... if there is anything criminal\r\nwhich honest Pacificus has not undertaken to defend.’[819]\r\n\r\n‘A blessed situation truly,’ exclaimed ‘Consistent Federalist,’\r\nreferring to the recent Orders in Council. ‘Camillus and Pacificus come\r\nforward and vindicate the lenity of Britain; continue to blast the\r\nFrench, and vent their spleen on the only nation that seems disposed to\r\nbefriend us.’[820] ‘Go on, then, Pacificus,’ wrote ‘Ironicus,’ ‘traduce\r\nthe French nation and the combined powers of Europe will thank you for\r\nyour assiduity.’[821] Soon the Democrats were grinning over the\r\nsatirical announcement of the forthcoming book ‘collected from the\r\nimmortal work of Pacificus’ on how to destroy free government by\r\n‘aristocracy and despotism.’[822]\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton could afford to disregard the attacks--he had Genêt working\r\non his side. Never had conditions seemed so promising to the\r\nlight-headed and hot-headed young diplomat than on July 4th, when he had\r\nlicked his chops over the opportunity to decline an invitation to dine\r\nwith the Cincinnati on the ground that he would not sit down at the same\r\ntable with the Viscount de Noailles.[823] There were other celebrations\r\nin Philadelphia more to his taste.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that the brig _Little Sarah_, a French prize, was\r\nbeing rapidly converted into a privateer with the view to sending it to\r\nsea regardless of neutrality. Governor Mifflin sent his secretary, A. J.\r\nDallas, scurrying through the midnight streets to Genêt’s residence to\r\norder him to keep the vessel in port. The young fire-eater raved and\r\nranted, and said strange things about appealing over the head of the\r\nPresident to the people. Jefferson, hearing of the incident, hurried in\r\non Sunday from the country, listened to Genêt’s cocky talk, attempted to\r\nreason with him without success, but left with the feeling that the ship\r\nwould not be sent to sea before Washington’s return from Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet met on Monday at the State House. Hamilton and Knox proposed\r\nestablishing a battery on Mud Island and firing on the vessel if it\r\nsought to reach the sea. Hamilton vehemently denounced the French.\r\nJefferson, having in mind his representations to England, was not at all\r\nsure that the violations of neutrality were on one side. He stoutly\r\nprotested against any measure that might lead to war without a\r\nconsultation with Washington.\r\n\r\nThree days later the _Little Sarah_ was still in Philadelphia and\r\nWashington returned. Hamilton and Knox were instantly on his neck.\r\nJefferson, ill with fever, had prepared all the papers in the case for\r\nthe President’s use, marked them for ‘instant attention,’ left them on\r\nhis desk, and retired to his home. Glancing at the papers, Washington\r\nsent a peremptory summons to Jefferson’s office. Learning then of his\r\nabsence, a note was sent to the sick man’s home sizzling with\r\nindignation over Genêt’s threat, and requiring Jefferson’s opinion on\r\nprocedure ‘even before to-morrow morning, for the vessel may be gone.’\r\nJefferson kept his temper--unless it is betrayed in the brevity and cold\r\ndignity of the reply: ‘T. J. is himself of opinion that whatever is\r\naboard of her of arms, ammunition, or men, contrary to the rules\r\nheretofore laid down by the President, ought to be withdrawn.’\r\n\r\nIt was after this that the _Little Sarah_ put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe lunatic caperings of Genêt had been maddening to Jefferson, who\r\ninstantly sensed the inevitable reaction against his party, and the ease\r\nwith which the sophisticated reasoning of the Federalists could confuse,\r\nin the public mind, the cause of the French Revolution with the\r\ninsolence of its Minister. Wherever his influence could be successfully\r\nexerted, he divorced his followers from the addle-brained diplomat who\r\nhad become raving mad. To Madison he complained of the continued\r\nadherence of Freneau and Greenleaf to Genêt.[824] Dr. Hutchinson had\r\ninformed him that ‘Genêt has totally overturned the republican interest\r\nin Philadelphia.’ Referring to the threat to appeal to the people over\r\nWashington’s head, he added: ‘I can assure you it is a fact.’[825]\r\n\r\nJustifications for the fears of the leader under the plane trees were\r\nsoon reaching him from Madison in Virginia, who had a plan afoot for the\r\ncomplete divorcing of Genêt from the Jeffersonian Party and from the\r\ncause of the French Republic. He prepared resolutions and arranged for\r\ntheir adoption in various county meetings in Virginia. One copy was sent\r\nto Edmund Pendleton of Caroline; Monroe was sent with another copy to\r\nStaunton. Still another went to Charlottesville.[826] The first of the\r\ncounty meetings to adopt the Madison Resolutions was at Caroline with\r\nPendleton in the chair, and they were hurried to the newspapers\r\nthroughout the country. They declared devotion to the Constitution, to\r\nthe cause of peace, and to Washington, were warmly appreciative of the\r\ndebt of gratitude to France, sympathetic toward her struggle for\r\nliberty, and denunciatory of the attempt to alienate the two republics\r\nand to drive the United States in the direction of monarchy and\r\nEngland.[827] They were sent to Washington, whose reply must have been\r\ngalling to the English party with its laudation of France and the\r\nrepublican principle of government.[828] The Jeffersonian press gave the\r\nreply the widest possible publicity.\r\n\r\nThus, through July, August, and September the two parties contended over\r\nthe threat of Genêt, each playing for advantage. Comparatively few\r\nextremists offered any excuse for the ruined Minister, who was despised\r\nby Jefferson and Madison for compromising their party and the cause of\r\nFrance. ‘His conduct has been that of a madman,’ wrote Madison to\r\nMonroe.[829] Even the Democratic Clubs followed the line laid down in\r\nMadison’s Caroline Resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nSuch was the inflammatory state of parties when on August 1st,\r\nJefferson, Hamilton, Knox, and Randolph arrived at the Morris house to\r\ndiscuss with Washington the disposition to be made of Genêt.\r\n\r\nKnox was not given to finesse when his passions were involved. ‘Send him\r\nout of the country,’ and without ceremony, he said. Publish all the\r\ncorrespondence in an appeal to the people before Genêt could carry out\r\nhis threat, urged Hamilton. For forty-five minutes he spoke\r\nimpassionedly, attacking Genêt, denouncing the Democratic Societies,\r\nassailing France. Jefferson, sitting in silence, thought it was an\r\nexcellent ‘jury speech.’\r\n\r\nRandolph spoke in opposition to radical measures, and the meeting\r\nadjourned until the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe next day Hamilton again took the floor and spoke again for three\r\nquarters of an hour with unrestrained bitterness. As he sat down,\r\nJefferson rose. He was not alarmed over the Democratic Clubs. They would\r\ndie if left alone and would grow on proscription and persecution.\r\nPublish the facts and decisions of the President on the whole foreign\r\ncontroversy? Those decisions had been reached with divisions in the\r\nCabinet--was it desired to proclaim that condition to the country? Was\r\nit desirable to injure our friend France with a stab, in the face of her\r\nenemies, the allied kings of Europe?\r\n\r\nIt was here that Knox broke in with references to Freneau’s attacks on\r\nWashington. He had calculated the effect. The President flew into a\r\nrage, and the meeting adjourned because of the turmoil and\r\nexcitement.[830] Determined to manage his own department, Jefferson\r\nthereupon sat down to the preparation of a letter to the American\r\nMinister in Paris, setting forth with scrupulous fairness and severity\r\nthe antics of Genêt, and asking his recall. The sting to France was\r\nremoved with an eloquent protestation of friendship. Hamilton at no time\r\ndrew so damning and effective an indictment of Genêt, but all this was\r\nlost upon him because of the note of friendliness to France.[831]\r\n\r\nTwelve days after the first meeting, the Cabinet again sat about the\r\ncouncil table in the Morris house listening to the Jefferson draft. It\r\nwas so unassailable that it was unanimously accepted--with one\r\nexception. Jefferson had referred to a possible conflict between the two\r\nrepublics as ‘liberty warring on itself.’ Hamilton moved to strike out\r\nthese words, Knox parroting his master’s suggestion. Washington favored\r\ntheir retention, expressing the conviction that France, despite her\r\nblunders, was fighting for liberty; but Randolph voted with Hamilton and\r\nKnox against Washington and Jefferson, and the words were stricken\r\nout.[832]\r\n\r\nIn due time Genêt was recalled. That episode was over. Jefferson had won\r\nhis fight to prevent a rupture with France--but it had cost him dearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nAs early as May, Jefferson had been able to put his finger on the French\r\nand English parties in this country. With the English, the fashionable\r\ncircles, the merchants trading on English capital, the supporters of the\r\nTreasury, the old Tory families; with the French, the small merchants,\r\nthe tradesmen, mechanics, farmers, ‘and every other possible description\r\nof our citizens.’[833] There was no doubt in his mind as to the position\r\nof the social circles of Philadelphia--he was made to feel it. The men\r\nwere courteous in his presence, and he still dined occasionally with the\r\nBinghams and Robert Morris, though the ladies were but chillingly\r\npolite. The friend of the ‘filthy democrats,’ as Mrs. Washington is said\r\nto have called them, was, to them, beyond the pale. Mr. Hammond, the\r\nEnglish Minister, was such a charming man! A few of the French noblemen,\r\nonce numbered among the dissolute loafers of Versailles, were to be\r\nfound frequently drinking Bingham’s wine, paying courtly compliments to\r\nthe women, and making love to the daughters of the house a bit\r\nclandestinely, as Mrs. Bingham was to find to her dismay a little later.\r\nNot a few of the social leaders had been ‘presented’ at court in both\r\nFrance and England, and they never recovered. Others looked forward to a\r\npossible presentation as the consummation of a life’s ambition. Kings\r\nwere adorable creatures, after all, and queens were as ‘sweet queens’ as\r\nFanny Burney found hers, and the nobility was so elegant! As for the\r\n‘people’--were they not as the rabble who had cut off the head of the\r\nlovable Louis? And Jefferson was the enemy of kings, the idol of the\r\nrabble--and what was worse, their defender. The men thought his\r\nprinciples askew, but the women knew that his heart was black.\r\n\r\nThus it was fortunate that during the exciting summer of 1793, Jefferson\r\ncould retire to the solitude of his murmuring plane trees and let\r\nsociety buzz. Even the Philadelphia streets were cold to him. Party\r\nfeeling was running amuck. Old acquaintances pretended not to see each\r\nother as they passed. It was true everywhere. Even Noah Webster was\r\ncomplaining bitterly of this party narrowness in New York. ‘Examine the\r\ndetached clubs at the Coffee-House,’ he wrote, ‘there you will see\r\npersons of the same family associated. Go into the private families at\r\ndinner and on evening visits, there you will find none but people of the\r\nsame party.’[834]\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson remained in town after leaving his office, he spent more\r\nand more time in the library of the Philosophical Society, at the home\r\nof Dr. Rush talking books more than politics, or he went to the welcome\r\nshade of ‘Stenton,’ where he was always sure of a cordial greeting from\r\nDr. Logan and that incomparable Quakeress who was his wife. To Madison\r\nhe opened his heart in the lament that he found ‘even the rare hours of\r\nrelaxation sacrificed to the society of persons ... of whose hatreds I\r\nam conscious even in those moments of conviviality when the heart wishes\r\nmost to open itself to the effusions of friendship and confidence, cut\r\noff from my family and friends ... in short giving everything I love in\r\nexchange for everything I hate.’[835] The attacks on Washington, which\r\nsociety ascribed to the influence of Jefferson, made his position all\r\nthe more unpleasant. Articles signed ‘Democrat’, or ‘Veritas’ foully\r\nassailing the President appeared in Federalists papers. The worst of\r\nthese, Jefferson thought, were written by his enemies for the purpose of\r\nembittering decent men against his party. It was even whispered about\r\nthat he was the author of the ‘Veritas’ letters, for Genêt, in an\r\nattempt to impress his Government with his own power, hinted that\r\nJefferson had written them. The latter talked it over with Tobias Lear,\r\nthe President’s secretary, and made an investigation of his own,\r\nconcluding that the author was William Irvine, a clerk in the\r\nComptroller’s office. ‘I have long suspected this detestible game was\r\nplaying by the fiscal party to place the President on their side,’\r\nJefferson wrote.[836] It was manifestly absurd, but society preferred to\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant as was the attitude of the fashionable circles, it was not so\r\noffensive to Jefferson as the constant quarreling and intriguing in\r\nofficial circles. He complained that he and Hamilton were always against\r\neach other like cocks in a pit. He was never fond of futile disputation.\r\nHis own views were fixed, as were those of his opponent. He was too much\r\nthe philosopher to enjoy argumentation that accomplished nothing. Long\r\nbefore that summer he had wanted to retire, and, as we have seen, had\r\nonly been dissuaded by the importunities of Washington, but he was now\r\nintolerably tired of it all. Acknowledging a letter from a friend in\r\nParis, he had written, in reference to the ‘oppressive scenes of\r\nbusiness,’ that ‘never was mortal more tired of these than I am.’[837]\r\nThree months earlier, he had promised his daughter Martha that the next\r\nyear they would ‘sow [their] cabbages together.’\r\n\r\nBy July the situation was becoming unendurable. It was about this time,\r\nwhen he was writing his notes to Hammond, the British Minister, who was\r\nan intimate friend of Hamilton’s, that Oliver Wolcott, the mere shadow\r\nof his chief, was bitterly complaining of Jefferson’s ‘duplicity of\r\ncharacter’ in treating Hammond harshly.[838] These were the notes to\r\nwhich John Marshall gave the highest praise in his ‘Life of Washington,’\r\nbut the observation of Wolcott reflected the tone of society.\r\n\r\nOn July 31st, the philosopher-politician seated under his plane trees\r\nmight have read an attack upon himself in Fenno’s paper charging him\r\nwith crimes against his country committed in such a way as ‘to keep him\r\nout of reach of the law.’[839] That very day he sat down at his desk to\r\nwrite his resignation. Six days later, Washington drove out to\r\nJefferson’s country place, and out on the lawn sought again to dissuade\r\nhis Secretary of State from his purpose. But he had had enough. With\r\nsome bitterness, he told the President that ‘the laws of society oblige\r\nme always to move exactly in the circle which I know to bear me peculiar\r\nhatred ... and thus surrounded, my words are caught up, multiplied,\r\nmisconstrued, and even fabricated and spread abroad to my injury.’[840]\r\nConvinced that Jefferson was unshakable, Washington discussed, with\r\nhim, a possible successor. He favored Madison, but feared he would not\r\naccept, and then asked Jefferson’s opinion of Jay and Smith, both rabid\r\nHamiltonians. Jefferson asked him if he had ever thought of Chancellor\r\nLivingston. He had--but Hamilton was from New York. What did Jefferson\r\nknow about Wolcott? ‘I have heard him characterized as a very cunning\r\nman,’ was the dry reply. It was finally agreed that Jefferson should\r\nremain on until January.[841]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nAugust was a dreadful month in Philadelphia, a dry, deadening heat\r\nmaking the days and nights unbearable. Any one walking near Water Street\r\nwas sickened by the fetid smells from the stinking wharves. Politically\r\nconditions were as depressing. The bitter party struggle went on. Even\r\nthe heat and smells could not give it pause. Bache’s paper published a\r\nletter describing Viscount de Noailles as ‘a man who was employed by the\r\nlate King of France to bribe the members of the Convention ... and\r\nafterwards ran off with the money’; and the next day the nobleman,\r\nswords and pistols in his eyes, appeared to demand that the editor\r\npublish a denial and furnish the name of the author of the article.\r\nThinking discretion the better part of valor, Bache gave ‘Mr. Pascal,\r\nthe Secretary of Genêt,’ as the author and society expected a French\r\nduel--to be disappointed.[842] Genêt was hurrying off to New York to\r\naccept an ovation and the Hamiltonians began to lose faith in\r\nWashington, because he sat ‘with folded arms’ and let the Government ‘be\r\ncarried on by town meetings.’ The Federalists were concluding that town\r\nmeetings were a vicious influence. Meetings of Chambers of Commerce were\r\ndifferent.[843] But it was reserved for Boston to give the Federalists\r\ntheir greatest shock when at the masthead of the French frigate _La\r\nConcorde_, appeared the names of eleven staid men of the city placarded\r\nas ‘aristocrats,’ and unfriendly to the French Republic. The charge was\r\ntrue, but here was something that smacked of the Terror in Paris. With\r\nthe town seething with righteous wrath, a committee boarded the vessel\r\nand demanded the removal of the placard. The officers expressed surprise\r\nthat it was there, apologized, removed it. But the opportunity was too\r\ngood to be lost. ‘I wish to know what is to be their [the eleven\r\ncitizens’] punishment, and who is to execute it,’ wrote ‘A Free\r\nAmerican’ in the ‘Centinel.’ ‘Are they to suffer by the lamp post or by\r\nthe guillotine here, or are they to be sent in irons to Paris to suffer\r\nthere?’[844] Viewing the scene, as became a Cabot, from the\r\nvantage-point of aristocratic aloofness, George Cabot was alarmed. He\r\nwrote King of his ‘amazement’ at ‘the rapid growth of Jacobin feeling.’\r\nWhy had not the truth concerning France been told the people? Had she\r\nnot ‘obstructed our commercial views?’[845] Had Cabot unbent to the\r\nreading of the ‘Independent Chronicle’ of his city he might have\r\nunderstood the cause of the ‘growth of Jacobin feeling.’ It fairly\r\nteemed with the French and their Revolution. ‘In case of distress whence\r\nis our succor to arise?’ it demanded. ‘Is there one among the combined\r\npowers contending against France on whose cordiality we could\r\ndepend?’[846] Ask the soldier of our Revolution who helped win American\r\nindependence. ‘Who were the men who marched in columns to the capture of\r\nCornwallis--or whose navy thundered the music of that defeat?’[847]\r\n\r\nThen, with September, the reaper of Death stalked through the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIt began with the filth and sickening smells of Water Street and spread\r\nlike the deadly gas of modern battle-fields over the city. The poor of\r\nthe congested quarters near the water-front fell like flies in winter.\r\nSoon it spread to the best residential sections. The evident inability\r\nof the physicians to cope with the disease increased the terror.\r\nWashington was ordered out of the city and hastened to Mount Vernon, and\r\nKnox took to precipitate flight.[848] Soon all the great houses were\r\nclosed, and every one who could afford it abandoned his business and\r\nfled from the stricken city. Soon half the houses were abandoned, and\r\nthey who remained locked their doors, closed the windows, and lived in\r\ncomplete isolation as far as possible.[849]\r\n\r\nDay and night the death-carts rumbled through the town and a covered\r\nwagon was kept busy conveying the sick to Bush Hill Hospital in the\r\ncountry--a dismal wagon with a bed, drawn by a weary horse.[850] With\r\nhalf the stores closed, the upward bound in the cost of provisions\r\nintensified the distress of the poor.[851] The streets were as those of\r\na dead city, no one caring to brush against the black robe of the grim\r\nreaper that was taking such an appalling harvest. One observer looking\r\ndown the street one day could not see a single soul.[852] Terror seized\r\nupon every one. Lifelong friends evaded one another like guilty\r\ncreatures. Even the families of the stricken fled, leaving the suffering\r\nto die in barbarous neglect.[853] One man determined to remain in the\r\ncity, but passing twelve corpses in the streets, he summoned a carriage\r\nand fled in horror.[854] Only the negroes seemed immune, and ‘much to\r\ntheir honor, they ... zealously contributed all in their power.’[855]\r\nAnd to accentuate the horror, the rumble of the death-cart, the cries of\r\nthe dying, the groans of the abandoned, were mingled with the bold\r\nfootsteps of the robbers making their way from one deserted mansion to\r\nanother.’[856] Panic everywhere. A toothache, and the victim was on the\r\nverge of collapse from fright--it was the fever.[857] Timothy Pickering\r\nhad a twinge, and off he hastened to the doctor to be bled, put on a\r\nstarvation diet, and sent on long horseback rides into the country ‘for\r\npure air.’ Many died literally from fear, and the horror of the scenes\r\nand sounds.[858]\r\n\r\nWhen the death toll mounted from scores to hundreds, from hundreds to\r\nthousands, the neighboring villages and towns met to devise plans for\r\nkeeping the Philadelphians away, and one of these threatened to receive\r\nthem ‘at the point of the bayonet.’[859] The hospitals were packed--two\r\nhundred Irishmen in the Naval Hospital alone.[860] Meanwhile the\r\nphysicians were fighting courageously, desperately, but blindly and\r\nfutilely. Fisher Ames, who had a malicious humor, was amused at their\r\nplight and methods. ‘All vouch success--none have it,’ he wrote, ‘and\r\nlike Sangrado’s patients they die for want of bleeding and warm water\r\nenough.’ One doctor treated the disease as a plague--‘his patients\r\ndied’; he adopted Rush’s methods--‘they died.’ He hit upon a combination\r\nof the methods--‘all died.’[861] Bache filled his columns with cures and\r\nsuggestions, but the death-rate increased frightfully. It was impossible\r\nto keep a record. On October 20th, Wolcott wrote Washington that ‘more\r\nthan four thousand persons have died,’ and the next day Pickering wrote\r\nhim that ‘about three thousand have died.’[862] As many as 517 were\r\nburied in the Potter’s Field between August 19th and October 1st.[863]\r\n\r\nThe streets deserted, houses closed, death-like silence but for the\r\nrattle of burial wagons and the groans of the stricken, the tread of\r\nrobbers in the night--the horrors deepened. No one understood the reason\r\nwhy--no one but Alexander Graydon, who thought it a grim visitation of\r\nGod to purge the foul hearts of the Philadelphians because of their\r\nenthusiasm for French democracy. One of the democrats had fallen early,\r\nwhen Dr. Hutchinson paid his profession the honor of dying in the\r\nharness. One day he met a friend in the street and urged him to take his\r\nfamily and leave. Was the Doctor going? No, he felt it his duty to stay\r\nand serve the sick. Was he not afraid? Well, he thought he would\r\nprobably fall a victim, and bade the friend farewell. A few days later\r\nhe was dead--the greatest hero of the scourge.[864]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jefferson, living in the country, thought it his duty to go\r\nto the city every day, and did. And then Graydon’s God made a blunder\r\nthat must have made the angels weep--he struck Hamilton down with the\r\nblow that must have been intended for the Jacobin Jefferson.\r\n\r\nLiving two miles out in the country, Hamilton was stricken violently.\r\nHaving given thought to the disease, he had conceived that cold water\r\nwould be effective. He summoned Dr. Stevens and many attendants--‘the\r\nmethod being expensive’--and through cold water and bark he was\r\ncured.[865] ‘Colonel Hamilton is ill of the fever but is recovering,’\r\nJefferson wrote Robert Morris who had taken to flight.[866] By the time\r\nthe country knew of Hamilton’s peril he had recovered, and, with his\r\nfamily, had hastened to the Schuylers at Albany.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of winter the disease receded--died out.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nEven so, there was no disposition on the part of Congress to meet in the\r\ngloomy city, and November found the Government established temporarily\r\nin Germantown. The statesmen had to accommodate themselves to wretched\r\nquarters. Jefferson ‘got a bed in the corner of a public room in a\r\ntavern,’[867] but it mattered little to him, for his time was short. As\r\nlate as December 22d, Washington made a final effort to persuade him to\r\nremain. ‘I hope it will be the last set at me to continue,’ Jefferson\r\nwrote Martha.[868]\r\n\r\nThe publication of his correspondence with both Genêt and Hammond had\r\nraised him in the esteem of his worst enemies. No one then or since has\r\npretended to the discovery of undue partiality in the treatment of the\r\noffenses of the two nations. In the field of foreign relations the\r\npapers of Jefferson during this period were as distinguished as those of\r\nHamilton in the sphere of finance.\r\n\r\nBut he was to submit to Congress a final Report on Commerce which was to\r\ncut short his popularity with his enemies. ‘The letting loose of the\r\nAlgerines on us, which was contrived by England, has produced a peculiar\r\nirritation,’ he wrote his daughter. ‘I think Congress will indemnify\r\nthemselves by high duties on all articles of British importation.’[869]\r\nHere he was referring to his Report.\r\n\r\nIn this notable document, which his party instantly adopted as a chart\r\nby which to steer, he laid down some broad general propositions which\r\ncalled for retaliation on England. If a nation placed high duties on our\r\nproducts, we should place high duties on its products, even to excluding\r\narticles that came into competition with our own. Where a nation\r\nprohibited American merchants or agents from residing in parts of its\r\ndomain, we could retaliate with propriety. If it refused to receive in\r\nour vessels any products but our own, we could adopt a similar\r\nregulation as to theirs. If it declined to consider any vessel as ours\r\nnot built in our territory, the rule could work both ways. All this was\r\naccompanied with a report on our relative commercial intercourse with\r\nboth England and France. The purpose was in harmony with the policy for\r\nwhich Madison had fought from the beginning.[870]\r\n\r\nLeaving this as a legacy to his party, Jefferson prepared for his return\r\nto his beloved Monticello. The executive branch of the Government was to\r\nbe turned over to the enemy, for no Jeffersonian considered Randolph,\r\nwho succeeded Jefferson, as a party man. Better a complete separation\r\nand open opposition than a further pretense at an unworkable coalition\r\nof the two parties. And home was calling imperatively. His private\r\naffairs were in need of attention. His ten thousand acres had been\r\nneglected. His hundred and fifty-four slaves had not been properly\r\ndirected. And there, on his serene hilltop, were his daughters, his\r\ngrandchildren, his friends the books, the trees, the view over the\r\nvalley at sunrise.\r\n\r\nBidding farewell to his friends and making ceremonious calls upon his\r\nfoes, he set forth in his carriage for the southward on January 5th. He\r\nwas going home. Soon the house he had planned on the hill would be in\r\nview, soon the negroes would be running down the hill road to meet the\r\ncarriage, to touch his clothes, to kiss his hands. Soon he would be\r\nsitting at his own fireside--in rooms sacred to the memory of the woman\r\nfor whom the house was built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHECTIC DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nScarcely had Jefferson reached his quiet hilltop when Madison submitted\r\nthe resolutions based upon his chief’s Commercial Report, and the\r\nEnglish party was instantly in arms. These resolutions were more\r\npolitical than commercial and were clearly aimed at England in\r\nretaliation for her refusal to enter into a commercial treaty. The\r\nresentment against the English policy had been increasing rapidly, even\r\nJohn Quincy Adams finding the French ruling powers more favorable to the\r\nWestern Republic than was the Ministry of Pitt.[871] Only in the\r\ncommercial centers was there a disposition to suffer long and be kind\r\nfor business reasons. The Chambers of Commerce were on their toes\r\nhissing; the Democratic Societies shouldered arms and marched to the\r\ntune ‘Ça Ira.’ The galleries of the House filled.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists met the Madison attack with a counter-charge from\r\nWilliam Smith of Charleston, in an elaborate recitation prepared for his\r\ndelivery by Hamilton. The Carolinian entered the fray with the breezy\r\nconfidence born of the knowledge that a master mind was behind his\r\nutterances. No one was deceived. ‘Every tittle of it is Hamilton’s\r\nexcept the introduction,’ Jefferson wrote Madison.[872] The strategy of\r\nthe Smith-Hamilton speech was to divert attention from the political to\r\nthe commercial phase, by showing that our business relations with\r\nEngland were more valuable than those with France. The next day Madison\r\nboldly proclaimed the political purpose of the resolutions.[873]\r\nThereafter, with spectators packing the galleries, and almost\r\nsuffocating the legislators by crowding onto the floor of the chamber,\r\nthe forensic gladiators fought with more ferocity than finesse. Ames\r\nsowed trouble for himself with the amazing declaration that ‘there is an\r\namicable disposition on the part of Great Britain.’[874]\r\n\r\nThe English are ‘as angry at us as we are at them,’ said Dexter, warning\r\nof war. ‘Ridiculous!’ exclaimed Madison. ‘What would Britain gain by\r\nwar? Would it employ her starving manufacturers’ or ‘give employment to\r\nthe vessels that formerly imported luxuries to America?’[875] But why\r\nthese strange accusations against England? asked Ames. What are the\r\nspecific facts? Facts? thundered Giles. She has ‘subjected our vessels\r\n... to seizure and search’; she ‘prevents our vessels from conveying to\r\nour friends and allies goods not contraband’; she is responsible for\r\n‘letting loose the pirates of the Barbary States upon our\r\ncommerce.’[876] Tracy, Hamiltonian, could see no advantage we had\r\nreceived from the French treaty. At any rate, added Boudinot, we should\r\n‘not over-value the friendship of France.’[877] What, roared Giles, ‘if\r\na prophet in 1778 had foretold that in 1794 that question would have\r\nbeen triumphantly put in an American Congress ... would not the prophecy\r\nhave been deemed an imputation on the American character?’\r\n\r\nBut--blandly from Ames--what are our grievances against England? ‘Is it\r\nnecessary,’ shouted Nicholas, Jeffersonian, ‘to tell the gentleman of\r\nthe hostilities of the savages on the frontier, of the murder of our\r\ncitizens, and the plunder of our settlements?’[878] ‘Only a set of\r\nresolutions on paper,’ sneered Dayton. Is that our only or best weapon?\r\nYes, answered Madison, ‘we can make use of none against Great Britain\r\nmore effectual than commercial weapons.’[879]\r\n\r\nThus day by day the debate dragged on. ‘What recent injuries?’ inquired\r\nSamuel Smith of Maryland, merchant. ‘The recent proclamation respecting\r\nthe stoppage of vessels of neutral nations, with all such excepted but\r\nthe United States,’ hotly answered Madison. ‘Better accept excuses than\r\nfight battles,’ warned Ames. Instantly Giles, whose passions slept with\r\none eye open, was on his feet protesting against the idea ‘that the mere\r\nexercise of our rights as an independent government is equivalent to a\r\ndeclaration of war.’\r\n\r\nThus the bitterness intensified, with personalities entering the\r\ndiscussions. One day the venerable Abraham Clark of New Jersey, signer\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, sat open-mouthed while Smith of\r\nCharleston reiterated his views, and then, trembling with age and\r\ninfirmities, declared that ‘if a stranger were to come into this House\r\nhe would think that Britain has an agent here.’ Cries of ‘Order!’\r\n‘Order!’ Smith replied with a sneer at the old man’s garrulity and\r\nyears. With passions at white heat, the debate was postponed until the\r\nfirst Monday in March.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, out of doors the fight was being waged with spirit. In\r\nBoston, the ‘Centinel,’ organ of the Federalists, was making scurrilous\r\nattacks on Madison. He had been the counselor and abettor of Genêt--a\r\ncorrupt tool of France since the embassy of Gerard.[880] He was the\r\nagent of France,[881] the tool of anarchists,[882] and he could have\r\nlearned nothing about commerce in Virginia ‘where no other commerce is\r\ntransacted than buying and selling of negroes.’[883]\r\n\r\nTo these attacks the Jeffersonians responded with a call for a town\r\nmeeting to act on the Madison Resolutions. Before a great crowd at the\r\nOld South Church a dramatic forensic scene was staged, the eloquent\r\nJarvis leading for the Resolutions, the brilliant young Harrison Gray\r\nOtis for the opposition, until darkness forced an adjournment till the\r\nmorrow when it was renewed until afternoon, when the question was\r\nindefinitely postponed. Otis had won the only victory possible in\r\nsuccessfully filibustering against a vote.[884] At Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire, a mass meeting at the State House endorsed the\r\nResolutions,[885] and to the astonishment of Madison a meeting was held\r\nin New York City at the instance of the Jeffersonians.[886] In\r\nPhiladelphia, with Hamilton looking on from the wings, the merchants met\r\nto denounce the Resolutions, but after a demonstration in their favor\r\nthe attempt to get a vote upon them was abandoned.[887]\r\n\r\nBut it was in Charleston that the rage of the populace over the\r\npro-English utterances of Smith and Ames assumed the most virulent form.\r\nMen cursed them in the streets, denounced them in resolutions, burned\r\nthem both in effigy. Bache, then the leading Jeffersonian editor,\r\ndeprecated the burning. ‘Sorry I am to see these English fashions\r\nadopted by free-born Americans.’[888] The cynical Ames’s sense of humor\r\nleft him unscorched by the flames. ‘I am willing to have it believed,’\r\nhe wrote, ‘that as I come out of the fire undiminished in weight, I am\r\npure gold.’[889] But it was more serious to Smith, for it was his\r\nconstituents who consigned him to the fire. The publication and\r\ncirculation of the speech he had not written had deepened the\r\nresentment. How much hotter might have been the flames had the mob\r\nforeseen the printing of an English edition with the boastful prefatory\r\nstatement that it had driven the author of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence from office![890] Indeed, the fortunes of the fight had\r\nturned, and the Hamiltonians, lately jubilant over Jefferson’s\r\nembarrassment with Genêt, had troubles of their own. Wolcott was\r\ncomplaining that Hammond, the British Minister, was ‘weak, vain and\r\nimpudent,’[891] and even Ames was alarmed because he ‘rails against the\r\nconduct of our Government, not ore rotundo, but with a gabble that his\r\nfeelings render doubly unintelligible.’[892] By their speeches against\r\nMadison’s Resolutions, the Federalists had inextricably entangled\r\nthemselves with British policies, and it was the chatter of the streets\r\nand the gossip of the press.\r\n\r\n    ‘From the speechification of Sedgwick and Ames\r\n     Some might think that they both had drank deep of the Thames,\r\n     For “our dear Mother Country,” the former stands forth\r\n     In strains that were worthy a pupil of North.’[893]\r\n\r\nIt was in this state of public opinion, and with Ames wailing that\r\nEngland was ‘driving us to the wall,’ that the news from the West Indies\r\naroused the people to a white heat of fury and put them on the march.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an Order in Council, the British had seized more than\r\na hundred vessels and held them for condemnation. So appalling were the\r\npossibilities that even Bache made the announcement in terms of\r\nmeasured moderation.[894] Ames no longer mentioned the ‘amicable\r\ndisposition’ of the British, or inquired with a childlike innocence what\r\nEngland had done to offend the Americans. With war seemingly inevitable,\r\nthe Hamiltonians were driven to the simulation of a warlike mood. The\r\nspirit of ‘76 burst into flames.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions the debate on the Madison Resolutions was resumed.\r\nWhen the sneer of Ames and Parker that they bore ‘the French stamp’ was\r\nloudly hissed by enraged visitors in the galleries, the Federalists took\r\nto cover.[895] Extreme provocative measures were introduced and pressed.\r\nThe demand for the sequestration of British debts led to vitriolic\r\nexchanges. ‘That king of sea robbers!’ That ‘Leviathan which aims at\r\nswallowing up all that floats upon the ocean!’ Boudinot, Hamiltonian,\r\npleaded for ‘calmness.’[896] Dexter denounced the proposal as the\r\ncounsel of dishonor. ‘English tool!’ roared the raging streets.\r\n\r\nThen came the Non-Intercourse Act, with the Federalists, off their high\r\nhorse, literally begging for ‘calm deliberation.’ Even Sedgwick was in\r\nan importunate mood; but the measure was pushed with all the more\r\ndetermination and passed with most of the Hamiltonians against it.[897]\r\nEven when Fitzsimons fell into line, he was trounced by the press with\r\nthe open charge that he had held out until his own brig ‘had departed to\r\nour good English friends at Kingston ... with a cargo of flour.’[898]\r\nClearly the Hamiltonians had to conciliate the public in some way, and\r\nSedgwick came forward with a plan for an army; and Madison denounced it\r\nas ‘the old trick of turning every contingency into a resource for\r\naccumulating force in the government.’[899]\r\n\r\nOut in the streets the people were on a rampage. Phineas Bond, the\r\nBritish Consul in Philadelphia, reported to Grenville that the Americans\r\neven resented the Orders in Council.[900] Worse still, he and Hammond\r\nthe Minister could not even walk the streets without being subjected to\r\n‘menaces from knots of street politicians.’ The consul in Baltimore had\r\nbeen forced by threats of violence to take refuge in the capital.[901]\r\n\r\nThe democrats followed up every advantage. Where was the spirit of ‘76?\r\n‘Shall a paper system hold you in bondage?’[902] England would not dare,\r\ndeclared the Democratic Society of Philadelphia, but for the declaration\r\nof neutrality, interpreted as evidence of American cowardice.[903] And\r\nperhaps Smith of Charleston had given the English a wrong impression.\r\nHad he published his speech against the Madison Resolutions to show\r\nAmericans he ‘despises their opinion’ or ‘to prove to Great Britain that\r\nhe has been a faithful friend?’[904]\r\n\r\nUnder such encouragement some French sailors in American ports became\r\ncheeky and chesty. In a Charleston theater one of these having insulted\r\na woman and been roughly handled, hastened to his ship with the story of\r\nan assault by English sympathizers. His fellows sallied forth to avenge\r\nthe insult, making accessions to their ranks on the way by spreading the\r\nfictitious story of the incident. Armed with cutlasses, they descended\r\non the theater as the people were pouring out, in an indiscriminate\r\nattack which included the wrecking of some carriages and the wounding of\r\na few horses. The alarm bells were rung, and citizens rushed to the\r\nbattle.[905]\r\n\r\nEverywhere people were steeling themselves for war. In New York a mass\r\nmeeting, held at the Coffee-House[906] was belittled by Noah Webster,\r\nthe Hamiltonian editor. Both he and Fenno were clamoring for\r\nnegotiations. ‘Why, to be sure, we must negotiate,’ sneered Bache.\r\n’...The honor, the interest, the welfare of the United States are locked up\r\nin the funding system.’[907] Everywhere citizens were helping with\r\nfortifications. In New York the students of Columbia (King’s) formally\r\ntendered their services,[908] the house carpenters gave their\r\nlabor,[909] and other trades followed. The country boiled with\r\nexcitement. The Nation was rushing into war. Hamilton and his associates\r\nput their heads together to devise a method to prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe rage of the people could be held in check only by a definite action\r\nlooking to the righting of wrongs, and since the last thing the\r\ncommercial interests wanted was war, the only thing left was\r\nnegotiation. Even though this finally failed, it might postpone the\r\nfatal day. The Federalists, in control, instinctively turned in the\r\ncrisis to Hamilton as the safest man to negotiate. He above all was\r\ninterested in preserving peace with England at all costs. His whole\r\npolitical system rested on the supremacy of the commercial element. He\r\nwas the father of the national credit and it would collapse without the\r\nrevenue from the imposts, the greater part of which came from English\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning no other name was considered in the Federalist\r\nconclaves for ambassador. ‘Who but Hamilton would perfectly satisfy all\r\nour wishes?’ wrote Ames.[910] A correspondent of Rufus King was writing\r\nabout the same time that Hamilton’s selection would give general\r\nsatisfaction because he had ‘the full confidence of the merchants and\r\nthe people at large’;[911] and King was replying that he wished Hamilton\r\n‘may speedily go,’ since ‘then there would be some hope of our remaining\r\nat peace.’[912]\r\n\r\nIn truth, Hamilton’s relations with England’s representatives in America\r\nhad been intimate. In the days of the agency of Colonel Beckwith, before\r\na Minister was accredited, an intimacy had been established with\r\nHamilton so close that Professor Bemis concludes that never afterward\r\nwas Jefferson ‘able to conduct his office with thorough\r\nindependence.’[913] That intimacy continued until the arrival of the\r\nMinister, and in the meanwhile Hamilton figured in the Agent’s\r\nconfidential reports as ‘No. 7.’[914]\r\n\r\nThe Minister, with more assiduity than ability, was George Hammond, a\r\nyoung man of twenty-seven, who immediately established similar relations\r\nwith the Secretary of the Treasury. Soon we find him reporting to Lord\r\nGrenville that he preferred to make most of his communications privately\r\nto Hamilton and to have no relations with Jefferson that were not\r\nabsolutely necessary.[915] It is fair to say that in every crisis he\r\nfound the opportunity to confer with the Secretary of the Treasury.[916]\r\nAll this was known, in a general way, to the commercial element when it\r\nwas urging Hamilton’s appointment as ambassador, and suspected by the\r\npeople at large. Thus, when the rumor of his prospective selection\r\nspread, there was a roar of protest. ‘The object of a special embassy\r\nmight as well be answered by commissioning Lord Grenville or Mr. Pitt,’\r\nwrote Bache.[917] In the meantime, Senator James Monroe had formally\r\nprotested to Washington against the appointment. The opposition was due\r\nto the reason set down in the memorandum of Hamilton’s warm friend,\r\nRufus King: ‘Colonel Hamilton did not possess the general confidence of\r\nthe country.’[918]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how hard it was for the Federalists to abandon\r\ntheir chief. Thrill enough there is, in the thought of Hamilton and Pitt\r\nseated across the table in one of the dingy little rooms in Downing\r\nStreet--so similar in precocity, brilliancy, and genius.\r\n\r\nOne evening four men sat in the candle-lit room of Rufus King in\r\nPhiladelphia. There was Oliver Ellsworth, a powerful figure before the\r\nSenate and Bar; George Cabot, in some respects a saner leader than\r\nHamilton; Caleb Strong, whose strength was in common sense and\r\ntoleration; and King, who was a monumental figure. It was agreed to make\r\nan effort for Hamilton, and Ellsworth was designated to call at the\r\nMorris mansion for the purpose. Washington did not commit himself.\r\nWhereupon Robert Morris was sent to reënforce the plea, but on learning\r\nthat not only Hamilton and Jefferson were being considered, but Jay as\r\nwell, he sensed the situation and veered to Jay. The result was that Jay\r\nwas summoned and offered the post. He took it under consideration. The\r\nnext day Jay was overrun with visitors. Hamilton urged his acceptance,\r\nhaving in the meanwhile written Washington withdrawing his own name from\r\nthe list of aspirants.[919] King, Strong, Cabot, and Ellsworth followed,\r\ndemanding Jay’s acceptance as a duty. While Jay was deliberating, his\r\nparty was thrown into a panic with the rumor that Madison was a\r\npossibility, and that Monroe had encouraged a hope in Pierce Butler\r\nwith a promise of the support of the Jeffersonians. Jay accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNo one but Hamilton could have been more obnoxious to the Jeffersonians\r\nthan John Jay. He was now verging on fifty, with a notable career behind\r\nhim on which to base an opinion of his bias. In appearance he was\r\namiable but unimpressive, with nothing in his manner to indicate his\r\nintellectual power.[920] Mrs. Adams’s daughter was impressed with the\r\n‘benevolence stamped in every feature.’[921] Of commanding stature, he\r\nwas slender, albeit well formed. He wore his hair down a little over his\r\nforehead, tied behind, and moderately powdered. Coal-black, penetrating\r\neyes increased his pallor, for he was never robust. Kindly, gracious,\r\ncourtly in social intercourse, he was sternly uncompromising where his\r\nintegrity was involved. Politically, he was an aristocrat, with contempt\r\nfor democracy, and an incurable distrust of the people. This, with his\r\npredominant devotion to the commercial interests, fixed his status among\r\nthe Federalists. Upon the principles of the French Revolution he looked\r\nwith abhorrence. ‘That portion of the people,’ he once wrote a friend,\r\n‘who individually mean well never was, nor until the millennium will be,\r\nconsiderable.’ Others thought the masses too ignorant to act well, but\r\nit was reserved for Jay to say that they did not even mean well.\r\n\r\nFew Americans then living were better qualified by experience for a\r\ndiplomatic mission. At Madrid he had shown rare tact, infinite patience,\r\nand dignity in defeat, and he had helped negotiate the treaty of peace.\r\nIt was unfortunate that he had, for a while, been Secretary of Foreign\r\nAffairs, for he had then made a secret report to Congress holding\r\nEngland justified in clinging to the western posts.[922] That secret was\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn writing Jefferson of the appointment, Madison gave no indication of a\r\nprobable opposition to Jay’s confirmation. ‘The appointment of Hamilton\r\nwas likely to produce such a sensation,’ he wrote, ‘that to his great\r\nmortification he was laid aside and Jay named in his place.’[923] But\r\nbehind closed doors the Senate engaged in a bitter battle over the\r\nconfirmation. The opposition made much of the impropriety of naming a\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court, submitting in a resolution ‘that to permit\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court to hold at the same time other offices\r\nemanating from and holden at the pleasure of the President is\r\ndestructive of their independence, and that tending to expose them to\r\nthe influence of the Executive is ... impolitic.’ According to Bache,\r\nthe majority of the Senate subscribed to this reasoning and the scruples\r\nof enough for confirmation were overcome only by the assurances that\r\nJay’s ‘delicacy and sense of propriety would certainly induce him to\r\nresign his office.’ Eight persisted in opposition on the supposition\r\nthat ‘more was to be feared from Mr. Jay’s avarice than was to be hoped\r\nfrom his delicacy or sense of propriety.’[924] By the suspicious Adams,\r\nwho witnessed the struggle from the chair, the opposition was ascribed\r\nto the fear that a successful negotiation would interfere with plans for\r\nthe elevation of Jefferson to the Presidency. On the surface, Jay’s\r\nindifference to the navigation of the Mississippi, his mythical\r\nmonarchical principles, his attachment to England and aversion to\r\nFrance, appeared explanatory of the hostility.[925]\r\n\r\nThe confirmation shifted the attack from the Senate to the streets. The\r\nJeffersonians resented it as a purely partisan appointment, but the\r\nopposition ‘out of doors’ went deeper. Could no one be found outside the\r\nlittle coterie of office-holders? Was it the intent ‘that certain\r\ncharacters should have a monopoly of power?’[926] The Democratic Society\r\nof Philadelphia bore down heavily on Jay’s justification for the holding\r\nof the posts.[927] A frontiersman from western Pennsylvania denounced\r\nthe appointment as evidence of indifference to the interest of the\r\nwestern country.[928] After Jay’s report on the posts would it not be\r\nanswer enough for Lord Grenville to quote Jay’s own opinion ‘on file in\r\nthe Secretary’s office’?[929] The Democratic Society of Washington,\r\nPennsylvania, thought that ‘no man but Washington ... would have dared\r\n... to have insulted the majesty of the people by such departure from\r\nany principle of republican equality.’[930]\r\n\r\nDisregarding the clamor of the ‘rabble,’ Jay had made preparations for\r\nan immediate departure, and without tendering his resignation as Chief\r\nJustice. The instructions he carried had been prepared almost\r\nexclusively by Hamilton.[931] So intimately was the economic policy of\r\nthe Federalists connected with the relations to England that these\r\ninstructions had been determined upon at a secret conference of\r\nFederalist leaders dominated by their chief.[932] Thus, provided with\r\ninstructions from a party conference, Jay set sail on May 12th from New\r\nYork. A thousand people assembled at Trinity Church to escort him to the\r\nship and give three cheers as he went aboard. A salute was fired as he\r\npassed the fort. But, wrote Greenleaf, ‘the militia had refused parading\r\nto honor the departure of our extraordinary Minister.’[933]\r\n\r\nIf the Federalists were pleased, the Jeffersonians were complacent and\r\nMadison wrote that Jay’s appointment ‘is the most powerful blow ever\r\nsuffered by the popularity of the President.’[934] But the Federalists\r\nregained confidence after several months of unpopularity and\r\ndepression--and it was now the Jeffersonians’ time to suffer again--for\r\nthe Whiskey Boys were up in western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Whiskey Boys of the ‘insurrection of 1794’ have been pictured as a\r\nvicious, anarchistic, unpatriotic, despicable lot--and they were nothing\r\nof the sort. These men were doing more for America than the speculators\r\nof Boston and New York, for they were hard-working conquerors of the\r\nwilderness, felling the forests, draining the swamps, redeeming the land\r\nfor the cultivation of man. Fortunately for America, they were a tough\r\nset. These rough men in coarse raiment and coonskin, with muskets on\r\ntheir shoulders, were not arrayed for a pose. They fought their way\r\nagainst savage forces, subduing Nature while warding off the blows of\r\nthe tomahawk. Their lot was hard. No luxuries in the log cabins where\r\nthey fought, wrought, suffered in the Homeric work of extending an\r\nempire and making it safe for the soft creatures of the counting-rooms\r\nand drawing-rooms who would ultimately follow. Newspapers they seldom\r\nsaw, books scarcely at all, and most were illiterate. It was a long cry\r\nfrom these powerful figures with muscular arms and dauntless hearts to\r\nthe perfumed dandies simpering silly compliments into the ears of the\r\nladies at Mrs. Bingham’s.\r\n\r\nWithin a radius of a hundred miles, there were but seventy thousand\r\nsouls. Pittsburgh was a crude little village of twelve thousand people.\r\nHere they lived, shut off from the eastern country by the mountains, for\r\nthe few passes and winding roads through the dense woods were too rough\r\nfor vehicles. The little trade they carried on with the East was through\r\nthe use of pack-horses. From the South they were shut off by savage\r\ntribes of red men. Here they were, left to shift for themselves by their\r\nGovernment, which manifested little interest in their welfare, but did\r\nnot forget the taxes. Because there was no market for their grain, they\r\nwere forced to convert it into alcohol, which was largely their medium\r\nof barter. Money was seldom seen, and the excise tax laid on their\r\nalcohol was payable only in money. No people in America received so\r\nlittle benefit from the Government, and none were hit so hard by the\r\nExcise Law. Perhaps these pioneers who thought themselves abused were\r\nignorant, but there was an intellectual giant among them who knew they\r\nwere abused. This was Albert Gallatin.\r\n\r\nA mingling of comedy and pathos is the story of the insurrection. The\r\nmasses were victims of a few demagogues,[935] but alas, these demagogues\r\nwere working with a real grievance. Public meetings had not served to\r\nmoderate the passions. Wise advisers, like Gallatin, were unable to\r\ncontrol, and the extremists followed the more flamboyant and less\r\nscrupulous. The law was resisted, officials intimidated, prisoners\r\nreleased from custody by mobs, and farmers who informed revenue men of\r\nthe location of stills read their mistake by the light of their burning\r\nbarns. When Washington sought to suppress the insurrection through\r\nnegotiations, it was too late, and the troops he summoned marched.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that politics should play a part. The Excise Law was\r\nHamilton’s child, born to meet the obligations of the Assumption.\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians had opposed its passage, and Jefferson thought it ‘an\r\ninfernal law.’[936] Then, too, it was felt that Hamilton welcomed the\r\nopportunity to test the Federal power. There had been too much\r\nskepticism on that point, and he longed for a decisive contest with the\r\n‘mob.’ Bache had complained that Hamilton’s report to Washington on\r\nconditions in the trouble zone read ‘like a lawyer’s summing up to a\r\njury.’[937] The Federalist papers traced the trouble to the\r\nJeffersonians because they had opposed the enactment of the Excise Law,\r\ndenounced the Democratic Societies for inciting the people to\r\ninsurrection, and satisfied the moron-minded that a demand for a law’s\r\nrepeal is the same as urging its violation. These were the days when the\r\nhigh-flying Federalists, under the shadow of Washington on horseback,\r\nwere meditating the Sedition Law. Yes, and the Alien Law as well, for\r\nthey were pointing to the ‘foreigners’ as the ringleaders in the ‘plot\r\nto overthrow the Government.’ The Irish, now numerous in Pennsylvania,\r\nwere mostly Jeffersonians. That was enough. Fenno warned of ‘the refuse\r\nof Europe that will swarm to our shores’ if laws were not rigidly\r\nenforced.[938] Wolcott wrote his father that the insurrection was ‘a\r\nspecimen of what we are to expect from European immigrants’ and that\r\n‘Pennsylvania need not be envied her Irishmen.’[939] ‘Down with the\r\nDemocrats!’ ‘Down with the critics of public men and measures!’ ‘Down\r\nwith the foreign devils!’ On these themes the Federalists harped through\r\nthe summer and autumn. Their persistence was so persuasive that\r\nMuhlenberg, the Speaker, narrowly escaped defeat for renomination\r\nbecause he had voted against the Excise Law.[940] The Hamiltonians made\r\nthe most of the situation.\r\n\r\nBefore this fusillade the Jeffersonians and Democratic Societies handled\r\nthemselves well. Never had these societies done more than denounce the\r\nexcise and demand its repeal, and under the fierce fire they made their\r\nposition plain. One after another they gave public expression to their\r\nviews. The Excise Law was reprehensible, but as long as it remained a\r\nlaw it should be obeyed.[941] The Democratic press took a similar\r\nstand. ‘The question is not whether the excise is a proper or improper\r\nmode of collecting revenue,’ wrote Bache. ‘It is constitutional ... and\r\nit becomes the duty of every citizen to give his aid, if called upon, to\r\nenforce its execution. If the opposers should triumph ... the axe is\r\nlaid to the root of all national government.’[942] Greenleaf in the ‘New\r\nYork Journal’ was quite as direct: ‘The excise, however obnoxious, is\r\nthe law of the Union; constitutional measures only therefore ought to be\r\nadopted.’[943] Jeers of derision from the Federalists greeted these\r\nresolutions and editorials. The insurrection, they contended, ‘is the\r\nnatural result of these Democratic clubs.’ Honest men among their\r\nmembers had been deceived and the rioting in the West would open their\r\neyes. ‘Down with the Democratic Clubs!’ ‘Down with the critics of\r\ngovernmental measures!’[944] This aroused the wrath of the\r\nJeffersonians, who now took the offensive. Bache summoned the\r\nJeffersonians to join in the suppression of the insurrection to ‘give\r\nthe lie to the bawlers against the Democratic Societies.’[945] The\r\nresponse was instantaneous. Members of these societies and enemies of\r\nthe excise rushed to the colors. The Irish Democrats of Philadelphia in\r\nan advertisement urged the Irish to ‘stand to their arms,’ and they\r\nformed a volunteer company.[946] The Federalists found themselves in a\r\nbrisk competition for places in the army. With the Philadelphia\r\naristocrats eager to follow Hamilton, and with the Democrats demanding\r\nplaces, the city’s quota was soon doubled. ‘Let those who derive the\r\nmost benefit from the revenue laws be the foremost to march,’ wrote\r\nBache gleefully. ‘Let the stockholders, bank directors, speculators and\r\nrevenue officers arrange themselves immediately under the banner of the\r\nTreasury, and try their prowess in arms as they have in\r\ncalculation.’[947] But the jubilant Bache was soon to sing another\r\ntune.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOn the last day of September, three spirited horses stood in front of\r\nthe President’s house on Market Street. Three men emerged from the house\r\nand mounted, Washington in the center, Danbridge, a secretary, on one\r\nside, and on the other--Alexander Hamilton. They turned their horses\r\ntoward the camp at Carlisle. So Hamilton was going to enforce his law\r\nwith the sword. Well did the Democrats know the spirit in which he rode\r\nto his task. Under the signature of ‘Tully,’ he had not been able to\r\nconceal his identity in a series of articles in the summer designed to\r\nprepare the country for forceful measures. These had bristled with\r\npartisan invective. The Excise Law was defended and its opponents were\r\ncharged with playing ‘with passions and prejudices.’ And it was not\r\nwithout passion and prejudice that he himself rode forth that September\r\nmorning.[948] It was at this time that Bache began to sing another tune.\r\nIn response to what constitutional duty was the head of the Treasury\r\nusurping the functions of the Secretary of War? he asked. ‘Pray, where\r\nis the Secretary of War? Is he superintending the operations of the\r\nTreasury department?’[949] He knew at the time that Knox was on a\r\nmission of private business in Maine, for more than two months before he\r\nhad sternly taken him to task for his absence in a crisis.[950] But\r\nWashington was going--why Hamilton? It was whispered about that he had\r\nintruded without an invitation, and some felt ‘that his conduct is a\r\nfirst step in a deep laid scheme.’[951] Madison was convinced that\r\nHamilton planned to use the insurrection as a pretext for the creation\r\nof a standing army,[952] long before the dynamic young leader rode forth\r\nwith Washington to join the army. A cry of rage went up from the\r\nDemocrats everywhere.\r\n‘Malignant--malevolent--uncandid--spiteful--envious--pitiful--mean,’\r\nresponded Fenno--and so throughout the summer and autumn the epithets\r\nwere hurled, the war in the East more venomous than that on the western\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hamilton rode on, close to Washington’s ears, contemptuous\r\nof the attacks. Never had he had less respect for democracy. ‘It is long\r\nsince I have learned to hold popular opinion of no value,’ he wrote\r\nWashington after the President had returned to Philadelphia, leaving him\r\nin actual command.[953] ‘Without rigor everywhere,’ he wrote King at the\r\nsame time, ‘our tranquillity will be of very short duration.’[954] It\r\nwas the tone of Federalist society in Philadelphia that led Bond, the\r\nBritish Consul, in a letter to Grenville, to comment that ‘the\r\nestablishment of a national force to strengthen the hands of the\r\nexecutive party can alone secure the existing form of government.’[955]\r\nAs the brilliant young leader rode along the wood-lined roads, aflame\r\nwith the colors of the fall, his plans for the capitalization of the\r\ninsurrection for his party were made. The Executive should have more\r\npower, with an army of some pretensions to enforce the laws. The\r\nDemocratic Societies that had awakened the political arrogance of the\r\nmasses should be crushed. Attacks on governmental measures should be\r\nassociated with disloyalty to the State. Perhaps on this trip Albert\r\nGallatin, the one financial genius among the Jeffersonians, could be\r\nruined--even indicted.[956] But the insurrection faded at the army’s\r\napproach. Nowhere was opposition offered. Everywhere the soldiers met\r\nwith cordial receptions, albeit the liberty poles literally lined their\r\nway. Only an occasional frontiersman in his cups made a weak show of\r\nhostility by hurrahing for the Whiskey Boys.[957] The ringleaders and\r\nmany who should have been unmolested were arrested and sent to jail in\r\nPhiladelphia under military guard. They who fell to General White were\r\nbrutally treated, confined in damp cellars, tied back to back, kept in\r\nconfinement from Thursday until Sunday morning with scarcely anything to\r\neat or drink. Most of them were misguided youths who were redeeming an\r\nempire, and not a few had fought in the war for independence. Most of\r\nthese were acquitted on trial. But when they reached the ferry at\r\nSchuylkill, they were forced to decorate their hats with a paper bearing\r\nthe inscription, ‘Insurgent.’ Thus denounced, they were subjected to the\r\nhumiliation of a march down Market Street, like slaves at the chariot of\r\na Roman conqueror, for the amusement of fashionable ladies at the\r\nwindows.[958]\r\n\r\nA pitiful spectacle--that march--and more significant than many\r\nrealized. The soldiers were of the first Philadelphia families in\r\nwealth, gorgeous in their blue uniforms made of the finest broadcloth,\r\nall mounted on magnificent bay horses so nearly uniform in size and\r\ncolor that ‘any two of them would make a fine span of coach horses.’ A\r\nproud show they made with their superb trappings, their silver-mounted\r\nstirrups and martingales, their drawn swords glistening in the sun.\r\nPatrician conquerors, these. And their captives, mounted on nondescript\r\nplough and pack horses--old men who had fought for American\r\nindependence, young men, all bronzed by the weather, some pale and sick,\r\nsome sad, others flushed with fury that they should be used to make a\r\nshow for the rich Philadelphians who looked upon them with complacent\r\nsmiles. It was the East and the frontier--it was Aristocracy with drawn\r\nsword and Democracy with the insulting paper in its hat. The\r\ninsurrection was over--a tempest in a teapot. A small army of\r\ntwenty-five hundred was left in the western country like an army of\r\noccupation. Two men were found guilty of treason and pardoned by\r\nWashington. The law was vindicated--now for the crushing of the\r\nDemocratic Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nForemost among the reasons for the virulence of the Hamiltonians toward\r\nthese societies was that they were interfering with the Federalist plans\r\nfor the political suppression of the ‘mob.’ Many ‘men of no particular\r\nimportance’ were, by combining, making themselves a force to be reckoned\r\nwith at the polls. Meeting regularly throughout the year, they were\r\nteaching the mechanic, the clerk, the small farmer, to think in terms of\r\npolitics. Worse still, they were manifesting an uncomfortable\r\ndisposition to pry into the proceedings of their representatives in\r\nCongress. No one saw this more clearly than Jefferson, who, in his\r\nretirement, was observing their growing power with complete approval.\r\nThroughout the summer of 1794, politicians were constantly driving up\r\nthe hill to Monticello. It was determined to force the fight in that\r\nyear’s elections. Candidates were brought out in most of the districts,\r\nand wherever there was a Democratic Society, the fight was a hard one\r\nfor the Federalists. For the first time they faced an organization,\r\ndisciplined, practical, aflame with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThis was especially true in Massachusetts where a herculean effort was\r\nmade to defeat Fisher Ames with Dr. Jarvis in the Boston district. The\r\nTitan of the Federalists in debate was kept on the defensive, with\r\ncharges that he had speculated in the funds and was in English pay. The\r\nmen in the streets made merry with Ames’s solemn assurance that England\r\nwas ‘amicably disposed.’ He was an ‘aristocrat’ and had ‘no faith in\r\nrepublican institutions’--a close guess. His friends mobilized for his\r\ndefense. What if he had speculated?--so had Jarvis.[959] Alarmed at the\r\nrising sentiment for Jarvis, the friends of Ames resorted to modern\r\nmethods of propaganda, with business men signing an appeal published as\r\nan advertisement.[960] This, described by the ‘Independent Chronicle’ as\r\n‘a new practice,’ was turned upon the Federalists. ‘How many of the poor\r\nseamen or Captains are there among the signers who have lost their all?\r\nNot one--are they of no account in the estimate?’[961] Election day\r\nfound at the polling-place ‘the greatest collection of people ever at a\r\nBoston election.’ The polls opened at eleven and closed at one. The hall\r\nwas so crowded ‘it was difficult to receive the votes with any degree of\r\norder.’ Half an hour before the polls closed, it was discovered that\r\nmany non-residents and non-taxpayers were in the room, and thereafter\r\nthese were challenged by the Jeffersonians. The Democrats afterwards\r\ncharged that Ames had been the beneficiary of ‘voters consisting of\r\nforeigners from on board vessels at the wharf, and persons from other\r\ntowns.’[962] Ames carried Boston by a majority large enough to overcome\r\nhis notable losses outside the city. Madison wrote Jefferson that Ames\r\nowed his victory to ‘the vote of negroes and British sailors smuggled in\r\nunder the loose mode of holding elections’ in Massachusetts. Even so, he\r\nfound a ray of sunshine in the close calls of Sedgwick and Good.[963]\r\n\r\nIn New York City the Federalists moved heaven and earth to defeat Edward\r\nLivingston with the cry that ‘Livingston is an aristocrat, his opponent\r\na plebeian’; but this appeal to the masses fell flat with the exposé of\r\nthe questionable patriotism of this ‘plebeian.’ Tammany, the Democratic\r\nSociety, and Jeffersonians generally fought energetically for their\r\nyoung orator, and the exhortation to ‘let Edward Livingston, the poor\r\nman’s friend, and the uniform asserter of the Rights of Man return to\r\nCongress,’ was not made in vain.[964] The severity of this blow to the\r\nFederalists was acknowledged in Ames’s admission that ‘the election of\r\nEdward Livingston almost gives me the hypo.’[965] In North Carolina a\r\nspectacular fight was made to crush the Federalists under the leadership\r\nof Timothy Bloodworth, directed by the cunning Willie Jones, who\r\ncontinued to make history with his whittling knife and pipe, and, with\r\nthe resulting Waterloo, the Hamiltonians began to entrench themselves in\r\nFederal jobs.[966] There the country-squire type rose on the shoulders\r\nof the people under leaders who ‘could not have obtained entrance to\r\nLady Washington’s parlors, but who knew the difference between the\r\ndemands of popular institutions and special interests.’[967]\r\n\r\nEven in Philadelphia the Jeffersonians won a sensational victory by\r\ndefeating Fitzsimons, one of Hamilton’s lieutenants, with John Swanwick,\r\nwho had led the fight in the merchants’ meeting for the Madison\r\nResolutions. In Charleston, William Smith narrowly escaped defeat\r\nthrough the intervention, according to Madison, ‘of British merchants\r\n... and their debtors in the country.’[968] All in all, Madison felt\r\nthat great progress had been made. It was the first real challenge the\r\nFederalists had met, and they had not enjoyed the experience. Surveying\r\nthe field in search of the cause, they pointed accusing fingers at the\r\nDemocratic Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the mass attack on these societies, let us pause\r\nfor a hasty review of other happenings of that eventful summer and\r\nautumn. Madison was in a tender mood. A little before he had fallen\r\nunder the spell of a merry widow whose glance was coquettish and whose\r\ntongue was nimble. The early autumn found him married to Dolly Todd; the\r\nearly winter, cozily ensconced in the house the Monroes had occupied\r\nbefore they went to France.[969]\r\n\r\nIn the house on the hilltop, Jefferson was living a quiet life. He was\r\nlittle more than fifty, his hair touched with gray, his form erect, his\r\nstep elastic, his strength undiminished. With his daughters about him,\r\nall was gayety about the blazing hearth in winter and on the lawn in\r\nsummer. The supervision of the plantation was to his taste. There were\r\nfences to be repaired, trees to be planted. He was interested in the\r\ngrowth of potatoes. He rode about ordering the uprooting of weeds here\r\nand bushes there. His correspondence was light. In acknowledging a book\r\nfrom John Adams, he wrote that his retirement had ‘been postponed four\r\nyears too long,’ and that his present happiness left him nothing to\r\nregret. That fall Washington had sought again to entice him back into\r\nthe Cabinet, but he had been untempted. Though happy in his retirement,\r\nhe was the old war-horse, sniffing the battle from afar.[970]\r\n\r\nAnd things were happening over the land. Dr. Joseph Priestley, the\r\nEnglish liberal, driven from England by persecution, had been given an\r\nuproarious greeting in New York and had replied to addresses from\r\nTammany and Democratic Societies with severe strictures on the\r\nrepressive measures of Pitt; and an exotic creature, who had been living\r\nobscurely in Philadelphia as a teacher, startled the country with a\r\npamphlet reply in a vein of sarcasm and satire worthy of the masters of\r\nthe art. England was glorified, France crucified, Democratic Societies\r\nexcoriated, the Irish in America damned--and the Hamiltonians rejoiced.\r\nMany were shocked. Since William Cobbett was to work under the\r\nencouragement of Hamilton,[971] we shall become better acquainted with\r\nhim by and by.\r\n\r\nOtherwise life was moving along in Philadelphia much the same as usual.\r\nSociety was still in the saddle. Blanchard, who was thrilling the\r\npeople with balloon ascensions, was postponing one of his ascents\r\n‘because of the marriage of a person of distinction.’[972] The French\r\nmadness was unabated, and on July 11th a French victory was theatrically\r\ncelebrated. ‘La Carmagnole’ was danced in the streets. Public officials\r\nmarched with the populace to the French Minister’s house where orations\r\nwere heard and ‘La Marseillaise’ was sung. At Richardet’s five hundred\r\nsat down to a noisy feast, after which they danced around a liberty\r\ntree, set off fireworks, and burned a British flag.[973] Even Rickett’s\r\nCircus was so fashionable that Fenno hoped he would begin his\r\nperformances an hour earlier to permit citizens to enjoy the dare-devil\r\nfeats before repairing to the House of Representatives to hear the\r\ndebates.[974] Bache, educated abroad, was a lover of the play and\r\ninterested in seeing democratic features introduced--say, an occasional\r\n‘simple air’ interspersed with the classics for the delectation of the\r\n‘gallery gods who pay their money like other folks.’[975] But the time\r\nwas to come when even Bache was to make sad grimaces at democratic\r\nmanners in the theater. This was when the ‘gallery gods’ hit upon a\r\nnovel mode of entertainment, of selecting some inoffensive ‘aristocrat’\r\nin the pit and demanding that he doff his hat to the gallery. Naturally\r\nignored, ‘a hundred stentorian voices would call out for his\r\npunishment.’ Thereupon the gods would pelt the unfortunate victim with\r\napples and pears, sticks, and even stones, and assail him ‘with\r\nscurrillity and abuse.’ Throughout the evening the persecution would\r\ncontinue. Spitting, and emptying beer-bottles upon him increased his\r\nmisery. It was bad enough, thought Bache, to spit upon the men\r\n‘aristocrats,’ without spattering the delicate dresses of the\r\naristocratic ladies with beer. One night most of the orchestra was\r\ndriven out of the house. ‘It is time to stop this growing evil,’ wrote\r\nBache, ‘which has been on the increase ever since the opening of the\r\nhouse.’[976] The Federalists were delighted at his embarrassment. Here\r\nwas the rabid editor’s ‘democracy.’ These people in the galleries were\r\nhis ‘sovereign people.’ And all this was due to the leveling influence\r\nof the Democratic Societies. They must go!\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWhen, in his Message to Congress, Washington made his amazing attack on\r\nthe Democratic Societies, the influence of Hamilton and the Federalist\r\nleaders, who had received not a few scars in the recent elections, was\r\nevident. Here was a proclamation that the masses of the people in\r\nprivate life had no right to organize for political purposes. That the\r\nHamiltonians had no interest in the mass of the people was generally\r\nunderstood.[977] They were impressed with petitions from the Cincinnati,\r\nor Chambers of Commerce, but frankly contemptuous of those signed by\r\nmere citizens ‘of no particular importance.’ When these people organized\r\ninto Democratic Societies, things were going too far. If this continued,\r\nthe ordinary mechanic might get the impression that he counted in\r\ngovernmental affairs. There was too much of this democratic virus in the\r\nbody politic.\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians were momentarily stunned by Washington’s denunciation,\r\nbut quickly rallied. Madison, calm, composed, courteous, but grimly\r\ndetermined, sat on the House committee to frame the Reply to the\r\nPresident’s Address, and he planned to ignore that feature of the\r\nMessage. He was not deceived as to its purpose or inspiration. ‘It was\r\nobvious that a most dangerous game was playing against the Republicans,’\r\nhe wrote Jefferson. ‘The insurrection was ... deservedly odious. The\r\nDemocratic Societies were presented as in league with it. The Republican\r\npart of Congress was to be drawn into an ostensible patronage of those\r\nsocieties, and into an ostensible opposition to the President.’ The\r\nsponsorship of a purely partisan attack by Washington pained Madison,\r\nbut it did not intimidate him. He considered it an assault on the\r\ncitadel of liberty, and it was, in truth, the forerunner of the infamous\r\nSedition Law.[978] In a letter to Monroe, he described the attack as the\r\n‘greatest error in his [Washington’s] political career.’[979] That it\r\nwas ‘an attack on the essential and constitutional right of the\r\ncitizen,’ he had no doubt.[980] Jefferson characterized it as ‘one of\r\nthe extraordinary acts of boldness of which we have seen so many from\r\nthe faction of monocrats’--an attack ‘on the freedom of discussion, the\r\nfreedom of writing, printing and publishing.’ And what of the\r\nCincinnati, ‘self-constituted,’[981] whose members met behind closed\r\ndoors, maintained a system of secret correspondence, while ‘carving out\r\nfor itself hereditary distinctions?’[982]\r\n\r\nEven so, the Jeffersonians would have taken no notice of the attack had\r\nnot the Federalists forced the issue by proposing an amendment to the\r\nReply commendatory of the assault on the societies. That Hamilton was\r\nthe inspiration of this move there can be no doubt. When the debate\r\nbegan, we find him hurrying around to Fitzsimmons’s house with ‘proof’\r\nof the connection between the societies and the insurrection; and,\r\nfinding the mover of the amendment absent, leaving a memorandum. The\r\nHamiltonian proof was that the Mingo-Creek Society was ‘sometimes called\r\nthe Democratic Society’; that some of the insurrectionists were on its\r\nmembership rolls; that one of its members had led one of the attacks and\r\nanother a second. Quite enough, he thought, to damn all the societies in\r\nAmerica, albeit almost all had denounced the insurrection, and many of\r\ntheir members had marched under arms against the rebels.[983] This was\r\nthe reasoning of all the extreme Federalists.\r\n\r\nInto the debate both parties dragged their heavy artillery. Madison,\r\nGiles, and Nicholas on one side, Ames, Sedgwick, Smith, and Tracy on the\r\nother. ‘Stand by the President!’--from the Hamiltonians. ‘Stand by the\r\nConstitution!’--from the Jeffersonians. ‘Plunge these societies into\r\ncontempt--sink them into abhorrence and detestation,’ shouted Sedgwick,\r\nstill smarting from the pummelling they had given him.[984] ‘The people\r\nhave a right to speak and to think,’ protested Venable of Delaware. ‘The\r\nfact that the President thinks them guilty is enough,’ thought Murray of\r\nMaryland. ‘I refuse to surrender my opinions to the President where a\r\nmatter of fact is involved,’ retorted Nicholas. ‘No,’ thundered Giles,\r\n‘the fiat of no person in America should ever be taken for truth.’\r\n‘Infamous creatures!’ snorted Smith of Charleston who had felt their\r\nblows. Nonsense, exclaimed Christie of Maryland, the members in\r\nBaltimore ‘were not the fair weather patriots of the present day, but\r\nthe patriots of Seventy-five.’ Yes, added Carnes of Georgia, citing the\r\ncase where one of these societies ‘turned out as volunteers against the\r\nrioters,’ and expressing the hope that the time ‘will never come when\r\nthe people of America shall not have leave to assemble and speak their\r\nmind.’\r\n\r\nGiles and Madison closed against the amendment in powerful\r\nconstitutional arguments on the rights of citizens to have opinions on\r\nmen and measures or to express them by voice or pen, individually or\r\ncollectively; and Ames closed for it, making much of the burning of Jay\r\nin effigy by the society at Lexington, and picturing the people on\r\ntip-toes on all the post-roads to learn whether Washington or the\r\nsocieties had triumphed in the House.[985] Dexter foreshadowed the\r\nSedition Law, toward which the Federalists were feeling their way, with\r\nthe declaration that the Constitution did not give the people ‘the\r\nprecious right of vilifying their own Government and laws.’ Madison\r\nwarned of the tendency, the vote was taken, and in the end the Reply of\r\nthe House went to the President without a reference to his attack on the\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nBut in the press the fight went on throughout the year. ‘Are men’s\r\nprinciples among the subjects of public concern which you are to\r\ndiscuss?’ asked the incredulous Noah Webster of the ‘American Minerva.’\r\n‘If so, your society bears a resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition,\r\ndestitute only of its power.’[986] One of Fenno’s scribes was moved to\r\nhilarity at the absurdity of the defense that the societies had\r\nuniformly denounced the insurrection. Had they not at the same time\r\ndenounced the excise law and asked for its repeal?[987] Republican\r\nsocieties checks and balances? sneered the ‘Centinel.’ ‘So are lanthorn\r\nposts and guillotines.’ The same journal neatly condensed the entire\r\nFederalist line of attack in a satirical ‘book of the generations and\r\ndownfall of Jacobinism,’ from the hour ‘Brissot begat the Jacobin club\r\nof Paris.’ Genêt--Democratic Societies of America--the Pittsburgh\r\nrebellion--the armament of fifteen thousand men--an expense of two\r\nmillion dollars--ran the argument.[988] Thus it was reduced to a matter\r\nof dollars and cents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the societies, recovering from the shock of the attack, stood\r\nto their guns, and issued statements setting forth in moderate tone\r\nprinciples, then jeered, which no one would care to challenge publicly\r\nin America to-day. The German Republican Club of Philadelphia\r\nconcentrated the defense in a few words: ‘Are we the abettors of\r\ninsurgents for supposing that Government can do wrong, and for\r\ndisapproving the excise? Then is the freedom of opinion at an end.’[989]\r\n\r\nBut the shadow of Washington fell darkly on the clubs and their power as\r\norganizations rapidly diminished. Many who refused to antagonize\r\nWashington openly were deeply resentful, and from that hour the popular\r\nimpression grew that he had aligned himself as a partisan of the\r\nFederalists. From that hour, too, the high-flying Federalists began to\r\nmove with greater confidence and celerity toward the Sedition Law. The\r\nerstwhile members of the societies fell back into the body of\r\ncitizenship, but more keenly and intelligently interested in politics\r\nthan ever before, and more than ever determined to make their influence\r\nfelt. They were not to forget what they had learned of tactics,\r\norganization, and propaganda, and very soon the Jeffersonian Party would\r\nbe the beneficiary of the Washington assault.\r\n\r\nIf this congressional session foreshadowed the Sedition Law, it also\r\nforeshadowed the Alien Law in a Naturalization Act reflecting the\r\nFederalist distrust of the immigrant. The Catholics were attacked in the\r\ndebate, and Madison indignantly replied that ‘there is nothing in their\r\nreligion inconsistent with the purest republicanism.’[990] When the\r\nJeffersonians created a diversion by offering an amendment that no\r\ntitled foreigner could be admitted to citizenship until he had renounced\r\nhis title, the Federalists stupidly fell into the trap and were\r\ninstantly on their toes with indignant protests. Instead of accepting\r\nthe amendment as a joke, they were soon pleading that titles were not so\r\nbad, and it did not matter if titled gentlemen voted and held office.\r\n‘You may force a man to renounce his title,’ said Smith of Charleston,\r\n‘but you cannot prevent his neighbor from calling both him and his wife\r\nby the title.’ Great must have been the merriment in the taverns at the\r\nspectacle of the Federalist leaders fighting with desperation and\r\nindignation against the proposal to prevent Lords, Dukes, Barons, and\r\nViscounts from becoming American citizens without leaving their titles\r\noutside the door. What matter if Sedgwick did explain that the\r\nacceptance of the amendment would be a justification of the charge that\r\nthere was a monarchical party in the country?--the better psychologists\r\namong the Jeffersonians knew that with the man in the street nothing\r\ncould have been more conclusive on that point than the unification of\r\nthe Hamiltonians in opposition to the amendment.[991] They had been\r\nmaneuvered into standing up and being counted against the renunciation\r\nof titles--and the ‘mob’ shouted with joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MARCHING MOBS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the short session of Congress, feeling ran high.\r\nThe Jeffersonians made a second foolish attempt to trace some act of\r\nofficial turpitude to Hamilton, and signally failed. The latter was now\r\nready to go. His great work had been achieved with the establishment of\r\npublic credit. His official honor had been vindicated. Never had he\r\nstood so high in the esteem of the commercial interests, the only class\r\nwhose good opinion he coveted. He was the leader of the leaders of his\r\nparty. With the rank and file he had never been popular, though always\r\nadmired, but he sought no popularity with the multitude for whom he had\r\na certain contempt. After years in the public service, he found himself\r\nin poverty, confronted with obligations to an increasing family. Early\r\nin December he wrote of his plans to Angelica Church: ‘You say I am a\r\npolitician, and good for nothing. What will you say when you learn that\r\nafter January next I shall cease to be a politician at all? Such is the\r\nfact. I have formally and definitely announced my intention to resign\r\nand have ordered a house to be taken for me in New York.’[992] A little\r\nearlier he had hoped to take a vacation in Europe. He was ‘heartily\r\ntired’ of office. Only the opportunity to quit ‘with honor and without\r\ndecisive prejudice to public affairs’ held him at all. Now political\r\nconditions seemed favorable for an early retirement for the elections\r\npromised ‘to prove favorable to the good cause.’[993]\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson retired, Fenno announced the event in two lines, but he\r\nheralded the resignation of Hamilton in a glowing eulogy, double-spaced,\r\nof the man who had made ‘two blades of grass to grow where none grew\r\nbefore.’[994] This was too much for Bache. ‘America will long regret\r\nthat his work lives after him,’ he wrote. And why the fawning rhapsody?\r\nHad Washington done nothing?--nor Congress?--nor the natural advantages\r\nof the country?--nor the Constitution? ‘No, the Secretary was the life,\r\nthe soul, the mind of our political body; the spirit has flown--then we\r\nare a lifeless mass, dust, ashes, clay.’[995]\r\n\r\nBut the sneer of Bache and the contemptuous fling of Madison, because it\r\nwas ‘pompously announced in the newspapers that poverty drives him back\r\nto the Bar for a livelihood,’[996] could not rob the daring innovator of\r\nhis triumphs. The Lancaster Troop of Horse, dining, toasted him,--‘May\r\nhis domestic felicity be equal to his public services.’[997] The day the\r\nstory of this toast was printed, a hundred and fifty of the leading\r\nmerchants, capitalists, and social leaders of Philadelphia sat down to a\r\nfarewell dinner in his honor. Judges of the Supreme Court and\r\ngovernmental functionaries were in attendance. When the project was\r\nsuggested, merchants ‘crowded to the subscription paper,’ and many were\r\nexcluded for lack of space. Toasts were mingled with convivial songs,\r\nand wine, we may be sure, flowed like water. After Hamilton had toasted\r\nthe Philadelphia merchants, he withdrew, and he himself was toasted.\r\n‘May he enjoy in private life that happiness to which his public\r\nservices have so justly entitled him’--and the rafters rang.[998] Two\r\nnights later, the fashionable Dancing Assembly, celebrating Washington’s\r\nbirthday with a dance and dinner, took note of Hamilton’s departure with\r\na toast.[999] When he reached New York, he found another dinner awaiting\r\nhim, when more than two hundred people in his honor sat down at\r\nTontine’s Coffee-House ‘at the expense of the merchants of the city.’\r\nThere among the guests were the Chancellor, the Judges, the Speaker of\r\nthe Assembly, the Recorder of the City, the President of Columbia. More\r\nconvivial songs and stories, more wine and cheers and laughter, and\r\nagain Hamilton toasted the merchants--of New York. And again he retired\r\nto permit the toastmaster to propose ‘Alexander Hamilton’ with nine\r\ncheers. Reporting the affair honestly enough, the ‘New York Journal’\r\ncould not omit the observation that ‘few of our best citizens and\r\ngenuine Republicans were present.’ The editor had never questioned\r\nHamilton’s ‘financial abilities,’ but he doubted ‘the propriety of his\r\npolitical principles.’ However, ‘in the language of the play bills it\r\nwas a great dinner, Mr. Hodgkinson,[1000] one of the managers of the\r\nfarce being present.’[1001]\r\n\r\nHaving been thus wined and dined, toasted and roasted, Hamilton retired\r\nwith his family to the Schuyler mansion in Albany for relaxation and\r\nrest. Perhaps he could not afford the coveted trip to Europe--it did not\r\nmaterialize. In April, Justice Iredell wrote his wife that Hamilton had\r\n‘already received more than a year’s salary in retainer fees’ and that a\r\n‘number of mechanics here [New York] have declared that they will build\r\nhim a house at their own expense’--a promise unredeemed.[1002] Hamilton\r\nhad hoped to open his New York office in May, but autumn found his\r\nfamily lingering under the hospitable roof of the Schuylers.[1003]\r\n\r\nSuch, however, was his insatiable craving for power that he was unable\r\nto forget, even for a month, the familiar field of battle. Enraged by a\r\ntriumph of his political foes on a measure in the House, he wrote\r\nfuriously to King that ‘to see the character of the country and the\r\nGovernment sported with ... puts my heart to the torture.’[1004] Events\r\nwere not moving with the felicity of old under the successor of his own\r\nchoosing, and he turned spitefully upon some of his most faithful\r\nfollowers. ‘So,’ he wrote King, ‘it seems that under the present\r\nadministration of the department, Hillhouse and Goodhue are to be\r\nministers in the House ... and Ellsworth and Strong in the Senate. Fine\r\nwork we shall have. But I swear the nation shall not be dishonored with\r\nimpunity.’[1005] Clearly he had determined to keep his hand on the\r\ndriving wheel from afar. The Cabinet was composed largely of his\r\nfollowers, only Randolph remaining to plague him, and his days were\r\nshort and full of trouble. The Federalists in Congress could be directed\r\nby correspondence--and should be; Washington not only could, but would\r\nbe kept constantly advised. Hamilton retired from office in January,\r\n1795, but he was not to retire from power until Adams, repeatedly\r\nbetrayed, should drive the Hamiltonian stool-pigeons from his Cabinet\r\nsome years later. Meanwhile, a party crisis was approaching that would\r\nrequire all Hamilton’s genius to save his party from destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe speak of the ‘Jay Treaty’; the Jeffersonians called it the ‘Grenville\r\nTreaty’; as a matter of fact it was more nearly the Hamilton treaty, and\r\nit was certainly a Federalist Party treaty.[1006] Jay had arrived in\r\nLondon, to be so graciously received and so lavishly entertained that he\r\nhad cautiously refrained from mentioning this unusual cordiality in\r\nofficial reports. Thomas Pinckney, the regular Minister, who had stoutly\r\nfought for American rights, was shunted aside. ‘If I should say that I\r\nhad no unpleasant feelings on the occasion I should be insincere,’ he\r\nwrote his brother.[1007] But he accepted the situation with good grace.\r\n\r\nIn time, after receiving attentions from the King not previously\r\naccorded America’s diplomats at the court, Jay sat down with Lord\r\nGrenville to the negotiation of a treaty. The latter, a favorite of\r\nPitt’s, comparatively young, but rising rapidly because of an abnormal\r\ncapacity for hard work rather than brilliancy, was in no sense the\r\nintellectual superior of Jay. In the first days of the negotiations, the\r\nprospects were bright enough for the Federalist emissary. England had\r\npreviously faced and accepted the necessity for the abandonment of the\r\nwestern posts, and she was not, at the moment, in position vigorously\r\nand persistently to protest the other outstanding American claims. The\r\nconditions on the Continent were far from satisfactory, with the\r\ncoalition apparently verging toward disruption. England was not seeking\r\nanother open enemy, and she could not afford the loss of the American\r\ntrade. But there was another danger threatening that was causing\r\nGrenville no little distress--and this is where Jay held the high card\r\nin the gamble.\r\n\r\nThe neutral nations of Europe had grown tired of the arrogant sea policy\r\nof the English, and steps were taken for the unification of neutrals in\r\ndefense of neutral rights. Sweden and Denmark had ratified an Armed\r\nNeutrality Convention on March 27, 1794, agreeing to join their fleets\r\nfor the protection of their peoples. Pinckney had been approached by the\r\nSwedish Minister in London with an invitation to the American Government\r\nto join. He had received the invitation with frank enthusiasm, and\r\nthought his country would agree.[1008] This was all known to Grenville,\r\nwho was painfully impressed with the possibilities. He had put his spies\r\nto the task of opening diplomatic mail and keeping him informed of\r\ndevelopments. Instructions had been sent to Hammond, the Minister at\r\nPhiladelphia, to exert all his ingenuity to prevent the United States\r\nfrom joining the Scandinavian combination.[1009] The day that Grenville\r\nsat down with Jay, the former had been informed by Count Finckenstein,\r\nthe Prussian Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the position of America\r\nwas doubtful, and that Jefferson had left the Cabinet to go to Denmark\r\nto assist in the organization and consolidation of the neutrals.[1010]\r\nIt was Grenville’s cue to procrastinate on the treaty until he could\r\nascertain to a certainty just what the United States contemplated in\r\nreference to the Armed Neutrality. Impatient over the delay, Jay\r\nsubmitted a complete draft of a treaty on September 20, 1794, which was,\r\nin many respects, an admirable document. When the treaty which was\r\nfinally signed was submitted with the other papers to the American\r\nGovernment, the draft of September 20th was conspicuously absent--for\r\nthe actual treaty was an almost complete surrender of the claims of the\r\nfirst draft, and its publication would have had a disastrous effect on\r\nJay’s reputation and on his party.\r\n\r\nTen days before Jay submitted his draft, Grenville was in possession of\r\na curious report from Hammond. The latter had been informed by Hamilton,\r\n‘with every demonstration of sincerity,’ that under no circumstances\r\nwould America join the Armed Neutrality. This, Hammond understood, was\r\nsecret information on Cabinet action.[1011] Thus, through the amazing\r\nindiscretion of Hamilton, Jay was deprived of his high card at the\r\ncritical moment of the negotiations. Hamilton was standing behind Jay,\r\nto be sure, but he was holding a mirror, however unconsciously, which\r\nreflected the American negotiator’s cards to the enlightenment of the\r\nsuave and smiling Grenville. From that moment Grenville stiffened his\r\nopposition to Jay’s demands, and thenceforth the latter was in a\r\ncontinuous retreat.[1012]\r\n\r\nThe result was a sweeping victory for England and the most humiliating\r\ntreaty to which an American has ever put his signature.[1013] It\r\nprovided for the abandonment of the western posts after June 1, 1796,\r\nbut there was to be no remuneration for stolen negro slaves and no\r\nprovision for ending the impressment of American seamen. The principle\r\nthat ‘free ships make free goods’ was surrendered and the contraband\r\nlist was extended. British claimants could appeal to the Mixed Debts\r\nCommission without first exhausting their resources in American courts,\r\nwhile the American claimants had to exhaust the resources of the British\r\ncourts before appealing to the Commission. The Mississippi was to be\r\nopened to British trade; and the West Indian trade, which Jay was\r\nspecifically instructed to secure, was granted to American ships of\r\nseventy tons burden only, and then on condition that the West Indian\r\ntrade should be wholly free to British vessels and that American vessels\r\nshould not carry molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton to any ports\r\nin the world except their own. The East Indian trade was opened to\r\nAmericans provided no further restrictions should be laid on British\r\ncommerce. And Jay agreed to provisions--despite specific instructions to\r\nenter into no obligations incompatible with our treaty obligations to\r\nFrance--which amounted to an alliance with England against America’s\r\nally in the Revolution.[1014]\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a rather disreputable performance which even Hamilton\r\nadmitted to Talleyrand, in a social moment, to be an ‘execrable one’ on\r\nthe part of ‘an old woman.’[1015] By a queer coincidence, Jefferson\r\ndescribed the treaty with the same adjective, as ‘an execrable thing,’\r\nin a letter to Edward Rutledge.[1016]\r\n\r\nHowever, Hamilton, familiar with the treaty long before it reached the\r\nSenate, was willing to accept the ‘execrable thing’ provided the twelfth\r\narticle, forbidding American vessels from carrying cotton, among other\r\narticles, to the ports of Europe, should be suspended. He wrote William\r\nBradford, the Attorney-General, in May, of his distress over this\r\narticle,[1017] and Rufus King about the middle of June.[1018] But he was\r\nsternly set on ratification, against a renewal of negotiations, and that\r\nwas enough to determine the course of the Senate. There was no other\r\nway. It was a Federalist negotiation. The negotiator had been chosen in\r\na Federalist caucus. The instructions had been determined upon in a\r\nFederalist conclave. They were practically written by the great\r\nFederalist leader, and the purpose served was in line with Federalist\r\neconomics.[1019]\r\n\r\nThus, when the Senate met in extraordinary session, its work was cut out\r\nfor it. For eighteen days the Senators debated in secret. The American\r\npeople knew that the treaty was under consideration, but they did not\r\nhave the most remote idea what it was all about. For eight days the\r\ndiscussion was general; then the Federalists, acting under Hamilton’s\r\ninspiration, submitted a form of ratification conditioned on the\r\nsuspension of that portion of Article XII which enumerated the articles\r\nAmerican ships could not carry to Europe. Meanwhile, the commercial\r\ninterests in New York were becoming apprehensive over the delay.\r\nHamilton was bombarded with anxious inquiries on the report that the\r\ntreaty had been rejected, and was able to deny it, writing at the same\r\ntime to Rufus King of the ‘disquietude.’[1020] Two days after Hamilton\r\nwrote King, Senator Aaron Burr moved to postpone ratification and to\r\ninstitute new negotiations, but this, with other hostile motions, was\r\nvoted down. At length the Federalist programme was pushed through,\r\nSenator Gunn of Georgia voting to ratify. Ten Senators remained in\r\nopposition. And then the Senate, with a keen appreciation of the\r\nhumiliating nature of the treaty, solemnly voted to ‘not countenance the\r\npublication’ of the document.[1021] Such a high-handed proceeding,\r\npredicated upon the theory that the people had no right to know to what\r\nthey had been bound, made an unpleasant impression even on Hamilton,\r\nwho wrote Wolcott that it was ‘giving much scope to misrepresentation\r\nand misapprehension.’[1022]\r\n\r\nBut there was one Senator who refused to be bound in a conspiracy to\r\nconceal from the people the people’s business. Stevens Thomson Mason of\r\nVirginia had crowded into his thirty-five years as much patriotic\r\nservice as any of his colleagues. Although but sixteen when the\r\nDeclaration of Independence was signed, he had served as a volunteer\r\naide on the staff of Washington at Yorktown, and had been made a\r\nbrigadier-general in the militia of Virginia. In the few years that\r\nremained to him, he was to earn an appreciation that partisan historians\r\nhave denied him by his militant challenge to the Sedition Law. Ardent\r\nand courageous, he felt that the people had a right to know the contents\r\nof the treaty, and, while the Federalist Senators were congratulating\r\nthemselves on having bound the Senate to secrecy, Bache’s paper came out\r\nwith the full text of the treaty. Mason had deliberately, openly,\r\ndefiantly taken a copy to the office of the ‘Aurora.’\r\n\r\nThen something like a cyclone swept the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe injunction of secrecy and Bache’s sharp comments upon it had\r\nprepared the public for something startling. ‘A secrecy in relation to a\r\nlaw which shall rival the darkness of a conclave of a seraglio.’[1023]\r\n‘Secrecy is the order of the day in our government--charming expedient\r\nto keep the people in ignorance.’[1024] ‘What are we to infer from this\r\nsecrecy’ but that ‘the treaty will be unacceptable to the people?’[1025]\r\n‘This imp of darkness,’ he had written, referring to the treaty.[1026]\r\nWhen Mason’s copy reached Bache’s paper, it was eagerly seized upon by\r\nthe people, and copied in all the papers of the country. The people all\r\nbut rose _en masse_.\r\n\r\nJuly 3d found the Philadelphia streets littered with a handbill urging\r\nan attack on a British vessel at Goldbury’s wharf. That night the\r\nstreets leading to the wharf were packed with people, most of them from\r\nthe section of the laborers, with a sprinkling of the curious. The\r\nGovernor had ordered out some soldiers who prepared to meet the\r\nemergency with stern methods. Until eleven o’clock the crowd stood in\r\nsullen silence waiting for something to happen, for some one to lead the\r\nassault. Darkly outlined in the night loomed the British ship, in front\r\nthe silent soldiers, behind them the angry crowd. Slowly this dwindled,\r\nand before midnight the danger was over, but the sight of the ship had\r\nnot worked a conciliatory spirit in the people.[1027] It aroused the mob\r\nspirit for action on the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThroughout that day--an ominous quiet. Out in the suburb of Kensington,\r\nthe ship carpenters were planning a demonstration. This was postponed\r\ntill night because the troops were out in honor of the Nation’s natal\r\nday. Eleven o’clock found five hundred men, mostly workmen, moving from\r\nthe suburb on the city. By the lights they carried could be seen an\r\neffigy of Jay. This, according to rumors that flew over the town, was to\r\nbe burned before Washington’s house on Market Street. Then a feverish\r\nsummoning of the light-horse, little Paul Reveres hurrying from door to\r\ndoor summoning soldiers to the saddle. Long before the marching mob\r\nreached the heart of the city, the cavalry was drawn up on Market Street\r\nwaiting. On moved the mob in uncanny silence. Most of the people were\r\nasleep, and only the bobbing lights of the marchers indicated that\r\nsomething was stirring. No attempt was made to reach Washington’s house.\r\nThrough other streets tramped the mob in orderly procession, then back\r\nto Kensington where Jay was burned in effigy. Just for a moment a pause\r\nin the jubilation, when Captain Morrell and some of his men dashed into\r\nthe glare of the lights to disperse the mob and to be pelted with stones\r\nand forced to precipitate flight. Only that, and an advertisement in the\r\npapers the next day announcing the finding of ‘an elegant horseman’s\r\nsword’ which could be recovered by ‘producing his muddy regimentals.’\r\nLittle damage had been done. Some one had hurled a stone through the\r\nwindow at Bingham’s house, but that was all, aside from the bruises of\r\nCaptain Morrell, who had fought neither too wisely nor too well.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the curious strolled toward Kensington, where they\r\nfound the ashes, and a board stuck in the ground bearing the words:\r\n‘Morrell’s Defeat--Jay Burned July 4, 1795.’ There, unmolested, it\r\nstood for days. ‘I think an attempt to take it down without considerable\r\nforce would be attended by serious consequences,’ wrote a Philadelphian\r\nto a friend in New York.[1028] The story of the burning spread rapidly\r\nover the country, carrying its inevitable suggestion.[1029] While the\r\nship carpenters were nursing their plans at Kensington, the Philadelphia\r\nCounty Brigade was celebrating the Fourth with a dinner in the woods\r\nalong Frankfort Creek, where the French Treaty was toasted, and those\r\nseeking to supersede it were denounced as traitors. The ten Senators who\r\nvoted against ratification were praised for having ‘refused to sign the\r\ndeath warrant of American liberty,’ Mason was eulogized, and the woods\r\nreverberated with shouts and laughter over the toast: ‘A Perpetual\r\nHarvest to America--but clipped wings, lame legs, the pip and an empty\r\ncrop to all Jays.’[1030] Three weeks later a throng assembled in the\r\nState House yard to take formal action, with men of the first\r\ndistinction in the community on the platform. A memorial of denunciation\r\nwas read, adopted without debate, and the treaty was thrown\r\ncontemptuously to the crowd, which pounced upon it, stuck it on the end\r\nof a pole, and marched to the French Minister’s house where a ceremony\r\nwas performed, albeit Adet denied himself to the mob; thence on to the\r\nBritish Minister’s house where the treaty was burned while the mob\r\ncheered lustily; then on to the British Consul’s and Bingham’s for a\r\nhostile demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe Federalist leaders observed these demonstrations with misgivings,\r\nwhistling the while to keep up courage. Somewhere on the outskirts stood\r\nOliver Wolcott, who instantly wrote Washington at Mount Vernon that the\r\ncrowd was composed mostly of ‘the ignorant and violent part of the\r\ncommunity.’ Nothing shocked him more than the introduction to the mob of\r\nHamilton Rowan, the Irish patriot, and the swinging of hats in token of\r\nwelcome. Judge M’Kean swung his, Wolcott supposed, ‘because he expected\r\nthe honor soon of having the fellow to hang for some roguery in this\r\ncountry.’[1031] Even more shocking to Wolcott was the invitation of the\r\ncolorful Blair McClenachan, as he threw the treaty to the crowd, to\r\n‘kick it to hell.’[1032] Pickering assured Washington that there ‘were\r\nnot probably two hundred whom Chief Justice M’Kean would deem qualified\r\nto sit on a jury.’[1033]\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be so easy to belittle the protest or to confine it to\r\nPhiladelphia. It spread--like an epidemic. In New York City, the home of\r\nJay, the feeling was virulent. The Fourth of July celebrations disclosed\r\nthe sharp divisions between the commercial interests and the body of the\r\npeople. With the merchants dining at the Tontine with Jay, the Democrats\r\nat Hunter’s with the French Consul were shouting approval of the toast:\r\n‘May the cage constructed to coop up the American eagle prove a trap for\r\nnone but Jays and King-birds.’[1034] The ‘Argus’ published a scathing\r\nopen letter to ‘Sir John Jay.’[1035] With the advertisement of a town\r\nmeeting, Hamilton and King sought to organize the opposition of the\r\nmerchants at a meeting at the Tontine when it was decided to contest the\r\nissue at the mass meeting. An address, protesting against the method of\r\nthe proposed meeting, written by Hamilton, was given to the papers, and\r\ncirculated in handbills. The stroke of twelve found from five to seven\r\nthousand people assembled, and the plans of the Hamiltonians were\r\ninstantly surmised. There, on the stoop on Broad Street stood Hamilton\r\nhimself, with King and a few others grouped about him. At the stroke of\r\nthe clock, Hamilton, without waiting for the organization of the\r\nmeeting, began to speak impassionedly. ‘Let us have a chairman!’ cried\r\nthe crowd. A chairman was chosen and took his station on the balcony of\r\nFederal Hall. Instantly Peter Livingston began to speak. Hamilton\r\ninterrupted. Cries of ‘Order! Order!’ from the people. ‘Who shall speak\r\nfirst?’ asked the chairman. ‘Livingston,’ shouted the greater part of\r\nthe crowd. But when he sought to comply, he could not raise his voice\r\nabove the confusion, though he managed to reach the swaying mass with\r\nthe suggestion that all favoring the treaty go to the left, and those\r\nopposed to the right. A goodly portion of the crowd passed to the right\r\nto Trinity Church, and Hamilton, assuming that only friends of the\r\ntreaty remained, began to speak. Hissing--hooting--coughing--his voice\r\nwas drowned. The orator paused, consulted his supporters, and a\r\nresolution prepared by King was passed to the chairman to read. A\r\nmomentary lull, and then, finding it commendatory of the treaty, an\r\nangry roar--‘We’ll hear no more of that, tear it up.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a stone struck Hamilton, without injuring him severely. With\r\na derisive smile, he called on ‘all friends of order’ to follow him, and\r\nthe Hamiltonians deserted the field. That afternoon at Bowling Green a\r\ncheering crowd could have been seen burning the treaty, while in the\r\nFields another crowd was screaming its delight as Jay’s effigy went up\r\nin smoke.\r\n\r\nThe next day the meeting reconvened and unanimously adopted resolutions\r\nagainst the treaty, and the Hamiltonians called a meeting of the\r\nmerchants to protest against the action. This meeting of the merchants\r\nis more impressive in books than it was in reality. The ‘Minerva’\r\nannounced that the treaty had been endorsed by a practically unanimous\r\nvote; while the ‘Argus,’ more specific, reported that among the seventy\r\npresent, ten had opposed the treaty, and that these ten ‘own more\r\ntonnage than the other sixty put together.’[1036] The minority of ten\r\npublicly denounced the majority as ‘either inimical to this country in\r\nthe late war, or have immigrated to this country since that period.’\r\nHaving made the charge, they entered into details. Of the sixty\r\nmerchants favoring the treaty, only eighteen had been outside the\r\nBritish lines in the Revolution, eight had actually joined the British,\r\nsix came to the country from England during the war and located in\r\nsections held by the British army, and ten entered the country after the\r\nwar.[1037] At any rate, there were seven thousand people in the mass\r\nmeeting and but seventy in the meeting of the merchants.\r\n\r\nThe ferocity of the protest had a depressing effect on Hamilton, who\r\ncould imagine nothing less than ‘Jacobins meditating serious mischief’\r\nto ‘certain individuals.’ Instinctively he thought of mobs, and\r\nmeditated on soldiers to put them down. He was afraid the New York\r\nmilitia was sympathetic toward the mob. Time would be required for the\r\nFederalists to ‘organize a competent armed substitute.’ He had thought\r\nof the ‘military now in the forts,’ but understood they were ‘under\r\nmarching orders.’ Would not Wolcott confer confidentially with the\r\nSecretary of War and ‘engage him to suspend the march?’[1038] The\r\nmajority were against the treaty--time to summon the soldiers. Nor was\r\nHamilton alone in this thought of force. Ames could see no other way and\r\nwas ready to ‘join the issue tendered.’ The moment was favorable for the\r\nGovernment to show its strength. Then action--‘Washington at the head,\r\nPittsburg at its feet, pockets full of money, prosperity shining like\r\nthe sun on its path.’[1039] Within two weeks Hamilton, in the Assembly\r\nRoom on William Street was denouncing the rabble, declaring the\r\nsituation meant a foreign or civil war, and expressing his preference\r\nfor the latter. Meanwhile he was proposing a house-to-house canvass\r\nthrough the wards for the treaty.[1040]\r\n\r\nIf Hamilton was alarmed in New York, and Pickering chagrined in\r\nPhiladelphia, the Federalist leaders in Massachusetts were stunned by\r\nthe intensity of the feeling of the mob. A protest meeting was held at\r\nFaneuil Hall, with the venerable Samuel Adams participating with spirit.\r\nWithout a dissenting vote resolutions were passed denouncing the treaty\r\nand praising Senator Mason for ‘his patriotism in publishing.’[1041] The\r\naristocratic leaders of the Federalists in Boston knew the futility of\r\nchallenging the throng. Declining the issue, they busied themselves with\r\nthe merchants and wrote explanatory letters to their friends. ‘Men of\r\nreputation would not attend the meeting,’ Stephen Higginson, the\r\nmerchant-politician, wrote Pickering, ‘being opposed to the town’s\r\ntaking up the subject. They were left wholly to themselves; no attempt\r\nwas made to counteract them, though nine merchants out of ten reprobated\r\nthe procedure.’ The people, to be sure, were excited, for had not Bache\r\nbeen to Boston ‘with a large collection of lies of riots in Philadelphia\r\nand New York to create a flame here.’[1042] Cabot, more truthful, was\r\nlamenting about the same time that ‘some of our most respectable men\r\nhave on this occasion joined the Jacobins and very many of them\r\nacquiesced in their proceedings.’[1043] Ames could not restrain his\r\ndisgust because many of the rich had participated. Even so, these\r\nclever, tireless Massachusetts leaders were not inactive. After all,\r\nwhat were the farmers, artisans, and lawyers compared with the\r\nmerchants? One merchant was more influential with them than a thousand\r\ntillers of the soil. Thus, they summoned the Chambers of Commerce to\r\naction, and resolutions were passed endorsing the treaty. ‘The\r\nproceedings are to be transmitted to the President,’ wrote the\r\ncomplacent Cabot to Wolcott.[1044]\r\n\r\nBut that did not end the treaty fight in Boston, for throughout the\r\nsummer the indignation of the people simmered and occasionally boiled\r\nover. The ‘rabble’ had to have its fling. On the walls enclosing the\r\nhome of Robert Treat Paine were chalked the words: ‘Damn John Jay! Damn\r\nevery one who won’t damn John Jay! Damn every one who won’t put lights\r\nin his windows and sit up all night damning John Jay!’[1045] Then, early\r\nin September, a great crowd marched through the crooked, narrow streets\r\nwith a figure representing Jay; and the next day it reappeared with\r\nanother effigy of Jay with a watermelon head, and marched noisily\r\nthrough the principal streets to the home of Samuel Adams who appeared\r\nand smiled approvingly upon the scene. A few days later, Jay was burned\r\nin effigy at Oliver’s Wharf, and the home of the editor of the ‘Federal\r\nOrrery’ was attacked with bricks and stones.[1046] The non-participants\r\nobserved that the Federalist leaders were more outraged at the burning\r\nof the effigy than over the action of a British man-of-war that sailed\r\ninto the harbor and helped itself to anything it wanted.[1047]\r\n\r\nFisher Ames ascribed the mob spirit to ‘a few young men who have lost\r\nproperty by British captures.’ Just a few, he said--mostly boys with\r\nfifes and drums. ‘The anti-treaty men were ashamed of the\r\nbusiness.’[1048] The Boston Federalists preferred to fight the mob with\r\nmerchants’ resolutions and their barbed wit. ‘The reason given by the\r\nJacobins for not reading the treaty,’ wrote Russell in the ‘Centinel,’\r\n‘is that no person ought to read what he knows to be bad.’[1049]\r\nMeanwhile, the leaders were busy as swarming bees all over\r\nMassachusetts, drumming up the merchants, soliciting resolutions,\r\nexerting influence to prevent town meetings. ‘At Salem the respectable\r\npeople are all acquiescent; and many of them approve but think it\r\ninadvisable to act,’ wrote Cabot to Wolcott. ‘At Newburyport, the\r\nprincipal merchants are also well satisfied; and some steps have been\r\ntaken to bring them to express their opinions.’[1050] With the merchants\r\nacquiescent, and the principal merchants satisfied, need any one worry\r\nover the marching multitudes?\r\n\r\nBut alas, in commercial Charleston, home of the Pinckneys and William\r\nSmith--there, too, the marching mobs, and mingling with them some of the\r\nrich and aristocratic. Here was the most bitter disappointment of all.\r\nIt began in the Senate when the patrician South Carolina Senator Pierce\r\nButler, cousin of the Duke of Ormond, refused to vote for ratification.\r\nNothing of the rabble about him or his charming wife. When the treaty\r\nreached Charleston, the flags of the city were lowered to half-mast. The\r\ntreaty was burned ‘amidst shouts of abhorrence’--nor was there anything\r\nclandestine about the burning. It was duly advertised in advance. ‘This\r\nevening at 8 o’clock,’ read the notice, ‘will be burned by the public\r\nexecutioner near the old Market in Broad street, the treaty proposed to\r\nbe established between Great Britain and America to show the disapproval\r\nof the citizens of Charleston. Also an effigy of Jay will be burned.’\r\nTaking cognizance of rumors of possible interference, the ‘satellites of\r\nanarchy,’ were promised ‘tar and feathers.’ These took the hint and both\r\nthe treaty and Jay crackled in the flames.\r\n\r\nThen followed a formal meeting of protest in the Exchange--a great\r\ncrowd--many veterans of the Revolution--an adjournment to Saint\r\nMichael’s Church to accommodate the throng. Then rose a figure familiar\r\nto the generation of the Revolution, and then Chief Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, John Rutledge. An able man was\r\nRutledge, with a luminous career. Speaking with vigorous eloquence,\r\nanalyzing the treaty as he proceeded, he denounced it as a betrayal of\r\nAmerican interests and an insult to American manhood.[1051] At a\r\nsubsequent meeting condemnatory resolutions were adopted, Butler was\r\nlauded, and Senator Read, who had voted to ratify, was denounced as\r\n‘unworthy of any further public trust.’[1052] In the midst of this\r\nmeeting there was a stir of anticipation when the popular orator Charles\r\nPinckney, just arrived from his country place and covered with dust,\r\nstrode into the room and claimed recognition. His was one of the\r\nfiercest excoriations of the year, and a few days later this speech,\r\nrevised, appeared in the ‘City Gazette,’ to be copied by all the papers\r\ninimical to the treaty in the country. A master of the philippic, he\r\npoured oil upon the flames.[1053] In parish after parish, meetings were\r\ncalled and the treaty denounced. The Federalists were appalled at the\r\naction of Rutledge, and he who had been numbered among ‘the wise and the\r\ngood’ became a symbol of unspeakable depravity over night. It was\r\nsuddenly discovered that he whom Washington had deliberately chosen for\r\nChief Justice was ‘insane.’[1054] In the ‘Centinel’ of Boston appeared\r\nan open letter to him declaring him unfit to sit upon the Bench--because\r\nof his hostility to the document of Jay.[1055] The private\r\ncorrespondence of the Federalist leaders bristled with abuse, and plans\r\nwere immediately made to reject his nomination in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina the opposition was even more bitter, partly because of\r\nthe absurd surrender in Article XII, and partly because of the provision\r\nwhich threw the property rights of Americans into jeopardy.[1056] This\r\none provision was said to affect half the lands in the State, and there\r\nwas wild talk of resisting it by force.[1057] Even Senator Johnson,\r\nFederalist, was shocked and disgusted. ‘A hasty performance’ at best,\r\nand one which greatly lowered his opinion of Jay’s ability.[1058]\r\nWilliam R. Davie, however, was outraged at the opposition and thought\r\nthe treatment of Jay measured ‘the baseness of human nature.’[1059]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the people were infuriated. They, too, were affected by\r\nArticle IX, and on the day the treaty was signed, Grenville presented\r\nJay with papers which began the long litigation over the Fairfax estate;\r\nand more than any other State she was a sufferer from the loss of\r\nnegroes carried away by the British troops. In 1791, Cornwallis had\r\ntaken thirty thousand slaves, of whom all but three thousand had died\r\nof smallpox and fever. When a mass meeting was convened at Richmond, the\r\nFederalist leaders had another shock when the celebrated Chancellor\r\nWythe, a powerful figure at the American Bar, took the chair--‘a\r\ncircumstance,’ wrote Madison to Jefferson, ‘which will not be without\r\nits weight, especially as he presided at the former meeting in favor of\r\nthe Proclamation.’[1060] Here the treaty was denounced as ‘insulting to\r\nthe dignity, injurious to the interests, dangerous to the security, and\r\nrepugnant to the Constitution, of the United States.’[1061] Patrick\r\nHenry thought it ‘a very bad one indeed.’[1062] And so thought the\r\nVirginians generally. At Petersburg a tribute was paid Senator Mason and\r\nJay was burned in effigy.[1063]\r\n\r\nStill another blow fell to the Federalists when Senator John Langdon of\r\nNew Hampshire, who had supported Hamilton’s financial policies, deserted\r\non the treaty. The merchants of Portsmouth--a sacred class with the\r\nHamiltonians--shared in the general protest. A mass meeting was called\r\nat the State House. ‘Your only hope is in the President,’ ran the\r\nhandbills. ‘Assemble, then, to a man; shut up your shops; repair to the\r\nState House; remonstrate.’[1064] And never had Portsmouth seen so great\r\na throng. The treaty was denounced, Langdon approved, Mason praised for\r\ngiving out the document ‘unduly withheld by the Senate from the people.’\r\nWhen Langdon returned, he was given a public dinner at the Assembly Room\r\nwith practically every merchant and tradesman gathered about the board.\r\nStinging toasts, patriotic songs, a stirring speech from Langdon--who at\r\nthis time aligned himself with the Jeffersonians and became their leader\r\nin New Hampshire.[1065]\r\n\r\nEven so, the Federalists held the line fairly well in New England. In\r\nVermont, where the treaty was the sole topic of conversation, there were\r\nno public meetings. The Democratic Societies of the State had fallen\r\nunder the frown of Washington, and rough-and-ready Matthew Lyon had not\r\nassumed the leadership. As late as September, ‘Vermont Farmer,’\r\ncomplaining of non-action, urged that meetings be called in every town\r\nand county--but nothing was done.[1066] In Connecticut, where the\r\npreachers, professors, and politicians had the people cowed, there was\r\nscarcely a whimper. ‘I have heard little said by our people about the\r\ntreaty,’ wrote Governor Wolcott to his son. ‘Our people are calm and\r\nhard at work.’[1067] In New Jersey a mass meeting was held at Trenton in\r\nthe State House and the treaty denounced--with numerous township\r\nmeetings following in its wake.[1068] The sentiment generally was\r\nhostile. Another meeting at Newport, Rhode Island, and another sweeping\r\ndenunciation.[1069] In Delaware the opposition was overwhelming, even\r\nthe Cincinnati at its Fourth of July dinner at Newcastle drinking\r\nheartily to the toast: ‘John Jay, may he enjoy all the benefits of\r\npurgatory,’[1070] while the diners at a more popular dinner drank, ‘His\r\nExcellency, John Jay ... may he and his treason be forever politically\r\ndamned.’[1071] In August the people of Wilmington crowded the Upper\r\nMarket House in protest, with men like Cæsar Rodney and John Dickinson\r\nparticipating.[1072]\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, where the popular sense had been betrayed by the\r\nratification vote of Senator Gunn, the bitterness was sizzling. One day\r\nthe people gathered about a poster in the Market at Savannah inviting\r\nthem to meet the next day at the Court-House and join in the burning of\r\nJohn Jay in effigy. Most of the town responded. There they found the\r\neffigies of Jay and Gunn on a cart. Forming in procession, with the cart\r\nin front, they paraded through the numerous streets, along the Bay and\r\nback to the Court-House, and thence to the South Common where the\r\ngallows stood. Halters were put about the necks of Jay and the offending\r\nSenator, solemnly the accusation of treason was read to them, and they\r\nwere given to the flames.[1073]\r\n\r\nIn Maryland the Federalists whistled hard to sustain their courage, and\r\nmade a brave effort to close their eyes to the situation. Representative\r\nMurray wrote encouragingly to Wolcott that among the men gathered for\r\nthe General Court ‘nine tenths ... from all the counties approved the\r\ntreaty.’[1074] In Baltimore the merchants rallied and sought to\r\nintimidate Sam Smith, their Representative, by the circulation of a\r\npaper of instructions. He hastened home to suppress it, and failing,\r\nhad a set of counter-instructions started. But there was no magic in\r\npretense, and soon Murray, himself intimidated, was writing of his\r\ndecision to retire with the admission that on the Eastern Shore there\r\n‘had been more agitation than I had imagined.’[1075]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThese marching mobs, mass meetings, resolutions and petitions, and\r\nburning effigies give no conception of the popular ferment. Never had\r\nthe people been more agitated or outraged. Whenever two men met, whether\r\nbankers or bakers, the treaty was the topic of their talk. In taverns,\r\nwhere travelers were promiscuously packed like sardines in a box, the\r\nquarreling made night hideous and sleep impossible. In the bar-rooms,\r\nmen, in their cups, disputed and fought. The stage-coaches were a forum,\r\nthe crossroads store a battle-ground. An English tourist, finding\r\nhimself in a wayside tavern, was driven to distraction by the noise of\r\ncombat. The farmers were against the treaty, the lawyers for it, and\r\nthey debated with passion, with more heat than light. Assigned to a room\r\nwith five or six beds, the forlorn foreigner was forced to listen to the\r\ncontinuance of the struggle until at length ‘sleep closed their eyes and\r\nhappily their mouths at the same time.’[1076] The Duc de la Liancourt,\r\njourneying through upper New York, was swept into the maelstrom of\r\ncontroversy and had to record his own opinions in his ‘Travels.’[1077]\r\nWhen the messenger from the Boston mass meeting reached New York,\r\nhurrying to Philadelphia, Greenleaf stopped his press to print the story\r\nof the incident.[1078] Soon the anti-treaty press was publishing\r\nstatistics on public sentiment--the mass meetings against the select\r\ngatherings of the merchants. Fifteen thousand people had met and\r\ndenounced the treaty, and seven hundred had approved it, according to\r\nthe ‘Independent Chronicle.’[1079]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Washington was causing the Federalists some uneasiness. As\r\nlate as July 31st, he had written Pickering evincing a desire to know\r\npublic sentiment. Had the Jacobins captured Washington? Wolcott was\r\npainfully depressed lest America lose the respect of England. What\r\nwould she think with their ‘Minister’s house insulted by a mob, their\r\nflag dragged through the streets as in Charleston ... a driveler and a\r\nfool appointed Chief Justice’ by Washington?[1080] Only the day before,\r\nWashington was writing of his alarm lest France resent a treaty she had\r\nsome right to resent.[1081] Clearly Washington required some attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe President held the treaty seven weeks before signing, and this put\r\nthe Federalist leaders to the torture. Among themselves they made no\r\nconcealment of their chagrin and indignation. Cabot, writing to King,\r\nconfessed that the President’s hesitation ‘renews my anxiety for the\r\nwelfare of the country.’ He would suggest to the Boston merchants that\r\nthey make ‘a manly declaration of their sentiments’ to Washington. He\r\nhad ‘too much respect for the character of the President to believe that\r\nhe can be deterred from his duty by the clamor or menaces of these city\r\nmobs,’ but he realized that something should be done to counteract their\r\ninfluence.[1082] If Cabot kept a rein on his patience, it was not true\r\nof all. In a great house known as ‘Elmwood’ at Windsor, Connecticut,\r\nsurrounded by elm trees and filled with books and religion, a stern and\r\nforceful master was literally walking the floor, and tossing restlessly\r\non a sleepless bed, for Oliver Ellsworth was doubting Washington’s\r\nfirmness and courage. In bitterness he was writing that ‘if the\r\nPresident decides right or wrong or does not decide soon his good\r\nfortune will forsake him.’[1083] In commercial circles in New York many\r\nwere already turning upon the man they made a virtue of pretending to\r\nworship. About the middle of July, Washington and his family left\r\nPhiladelphia for Mount Vernon, he in a two-horse phaëton for one, his\r\nfamily in a coach with four horses and two servants, another servant\r\nleading a saddle horse--and without giving the slightest intimation of\r\nhis intention.[1084]\r\n\r\nThen came the scandal involving Randolph and the French Minister Faucet.\r\nThere was infinite joy in the Federalist camp. Pickering and Randolph\r\nhastened a summons to Washington to return. There was a dramatic scene,\r\nin which Washington is described as winking at Pickering, and setting a\r\ntrap for his Secretary of State, who was the sole member of his original\r\nCabinet chosen by the President to please himself. Randolph was\r\ndismissed--and Washington signed the treaty. The merits of the treaty\r\nwere in no wise affected by anything Randolph may have done, and it is\r\nfair to assume that there was no connection between the disgracing of\r\nthe Secretary and the signing.[1085] The strategy of the Federalist now\r\noutlined itself, and Washington became the treaty and the treaty became\r\nWashington, and to oppose the treaty was to insult Washington. The\r\npopular President was literally pushed to the front line in the fight.\r\nPickering was writing Jay suggesting that Washington be persuaded to\r\nissue ‘a solemn public declaration ... of the principles of his\r\nAdministration,’ appealing to the record of his life ‘for the purity and\r\npatriotism of his conduct’;[1086] and Jay was replying that while ‘in\r\nmany respects useful,’ he doubted the wisdom.[1087] Christopher Gore was\r\nwriting King inquiring if it were not ‘possible for Col. Hamilton and\r\nyourself to induce the President to adopt some measures that would\r\ndecidedly express his sentiments in favor of the treaty.’ He was\r\npositive that ‘in New England the word of the President would save the\r\nGovernment.’[1088]\r\n\r\nThis plan of using the prestige of Washington for a party measure was\r\nnot made for this particular occasion. Pickering and Gore wrote on the\r\nsame day,[1089] one from Philadelphia, and the other from Boston. It had\r\nlong been a favorite feature in the party strategy. Ellsworth regained\r\nhis composure and wrote Wolcott that ‘the current I believe is turning\r\nin Massachusetts, though you may perhaps hear of some obscure town\r\nmeetings.’[1090] Senator James Ross, writing to Pickering from\r\nPittsburgh, thought that after all it was well that Washington had taken\r\nhis time. ‘His sanction after hearing all the objections will quiet the\r\nminds of the thoughtful.’[1091]\r\n\r\nAll that was required to make Washington the issue in the treaty fight\r\nwas a stupid attack upon him from the Democratic press, and that was\r\ninstantly forthcoming. When Fenno’s paper announced that the treaty had\r\nbeen signed, Bache wrote that since ‘no information has been filed for a\r\nlibel on the Executive ... it may be fairly presumed, the character of\r\nthe President for patriotism and republicanism notwithstanding, that the\r\nassertion is well founded.’[1092] And when a great crowd attended the\r\nnext presidential levee, Bache capped the climax of asininity with the\r\ncomment that ‘it was certainly necessary to let the public know that the\r\njust resentment of an injured and insulted people had not reached the\r\npurview of Saint Washington.’[1093] These bitter expressions convinced\r\nthe Federalists that the fight was not yet over. The public had too\r\nbitterly and generally resented the treaty to be so quickly won.\r\nInstinctively the friends of the treaty thought of Hamilton and the\r\nprowess of his pen. ‘Mr. Hamilton might do great good,’ wrote Murray of\r\nMaryland to Wolcott, ‘by giving the public his luminous pen.’[1094] Even\r\nas Murray wrote, Hamilton sat in his office writing ‘Camillus’ for Noah\r\nWebster’s paper. His health was failing at the time, but King and Jay\r\nhad promised to assist. For weeks and months the papers appeared,\r\nthirty-eight in all, in the most effective argumentative style, covering\r\nevery possible phase. ‘It is to pass for Hamilton’s,’ wrote John Adams\r\nto his wife, ‘but all three consulted together upon most.’[1095] Two\r\nmonths after the series began, the enemies of the treaty were\r\ncirculating the story that Hamilton and Webster had quarreled because of\r\nthe latter’s decision to limit the number of papers. ‘More than a\r\nhundred columns have already been run, to the exclusion of news, and the\r\npeople are tired, no doubt,’ suggested an editor.[1096]\r\n\r\nUnhappily, while Hamilton wrote, England was up to her old tricks upon\r\nthe sea again. Scarcely had the treaty been ratified, when Pickering was\r\nofficially protesting against an outrage on the United States by the\r\nBritish ship of the line _Africa_, and by the British Vice-Consul in\r\nRhode Island,[1097] and was writing complainingly to John Quincy Adams\r\nin London that ‘if Britain studied to keep up the irritation in the\r\nminds of Americans ... some of her naval commanders appear perfectly\r\nqualified for the object.’[1098] The enemies of the treaty made the\r\nmost of these affronts. ‘A Loyalist of ‘75’ was urging Hamilton to\r\n‘discontinue his laborious work of defending the treaty’ to give some\r\nattention to the justification of Captain Home of the _Africa_, and to\r\nthe defense of the other sea captain who stole a peep ‘at Mr. Monroe’s\r\ndespatches.’ ‘Camillus’ could resume on the treaty after quieting ‘the\r\nminds of the swinish multitude’ on these later outrages.[1099] Thus\r\nHamilton’s efforts were being constantly neutralized in effect by the\r\nconduct of the English, and the ‘swinish multitude’ chortled not a\r\nlittle over the doggerel:\r\n\r\n    ‘Sure George the Third will find employ\r\n     For one so wise and wary,\r\n     He’ll call “Camillus” home with joy,\r\n     And make him Secretary.’[1100]\r\n\r\nIn truth, even as he wrote, Hamilton was raging not a little over these\r\nstupid insults to America, and was writing Wolcott proposing that the\r\nexchange of ratifications be refused until the order to seize our\r\nvessels with provisions be rescinded.[1101]\r\n\r\nFar away on his hilltop, Jefferson was observing Hamilton’s literary\r\nefforts with real concern, if the rank and file of his party were not.\r\n‘Hamilton is really a colossus to the anti-republican party,’ he wrote\r\nMadison, apropos of the defense of the treaty. ‘Without numbers, he is a\r\nhost within himself. They have got themselves into a defile where they\r\ncan be finished; but too much security on the republican part will give\r\ntime to his talent ... to extricate them.... When he comes forward there\r\nis no one but yourself who can meet him. For God’s sake take up your pen\r\nand give a fundamental reply to Curtius and Camillus.’[1102] But neither\r\n‘for God’s sake,’ nor for Jefferson’s, did Madison comply. He was\r\nenjoying his vacation with Dolly. Even so, the Federalists were still in\r\nthe woods on the treaty--and there was yet a memorable fight ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA OF ‘96\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nExuberant over their success in capitalizing Washington’s consent to the\r\ntreaty, the Federalists returned to Philadelphia in an ugly mood. With\r\ncelerity and _éclat_, the Senate threw down the gauntlet with the\r\nrejection of the nomination of John Rutledge because of his hostility to\r\nthe treaty. The motive was unescapable. He was an able jurist, an\r\nerudite lawyer, a pure patriot with a superb record of high public\r\nservices--but he had denounced the Federalist treaty. That was enough.\r\nThe leaders were delighted with their action, Senator Johnson thinking\r\nit would have been unfortunate to have permitted Rutledge to remain upon\r\nthe Bench ‘after what had appeared.’ Of course, the opposition would\r\n‘endeavor to impress it upon the minds of the people that the majority\r\nwere influenced by improper motives,’ but that was unavoidable.[1103]\r\nJefferson viewed the incident from his hilltop with the vision of a\r\nprophet. ‘A bold thing,’ he thought, ‘because they cannot pretend any\r\nobjection to him but his disapprobation of the treaty.’ It meant that\r\nthe Federalists ‘would receive none but Tories hereafter into any\r\ndepartment of the government,’ and it would not be surprising were\r\nMonroe recalled from Paris because ‘of his being of the partisans of\r\nFrance.’ Monticello was remote, but its master could see a long\r\nway.[1104]\r\n\r\nThe Senate still seemed safe to the Federalists on their return, but\r\nthere were grave misgivings as to the House. Young Livingston had caused\r\ntrouble enough and he was back to give more than Ames ‘the hypo,’ but\r\nmore ominous was the appearance there for the first time of Albert\r\nGallatin. He had been thrown out of the Senate as speedily as possible,\r\nbut not before he had given proof of his financial genius. There, the\r\nJeffersonians had been weak in leadership. It was characteristic of the\r\ninner circle of the Federalists to hate any opponent they could not\r\ndespise--and they dare not despise this young man from Geneva. Even in\r\nprivate life he had been denounced and damned in the spirit of the\r\npothouse, and Hamilton had ardently hoped for his indictment in\r\nconnection with the Whiskey Insurrection. When his election had seemed\r\nprobable, an effort had actually been made to disfranchise his district\r\nas a region of sedition--but here was Gallatin. A duel between\r\nGallatin’s father-in-law, Admiral Nicholson, and Hamilton had been\r\nnarrowly averted in the autumn; but Gallatin, rising serenely above his\r\ndetractors, had refused to be ruffled, and had advised his wife not to\r\nexpress her sentiments on the treatment accorded him too hotly lest it\r\n‘lead to consequences you would forever regret.’[1105] Since these two\r\nbrilliant, bitterly hated, and violently abused men, Livingston and\r\nGallatin, were to play conspicuous parts in the drama of the House, it\r\nis worth while to pause for a more intimate impression of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n‘Edward Livingston now lives here in the style of a nabob,’ wrote\r\nWolcott during this session.[1106] It was a style to which he had been\r\naccustomed from birth, for he was of the baronial aristocracy of New\r\nYork. He was but thirty-two at the time, tall, handsome, dashing and\r\ndaring, witty and eloquent, and with a luminous background of wealth,\r\nculture, tradition, and personal achievement. Even the most inveterate\r\nsnob among his political opponents must have envied him his advantages.\r\nBorn in the mansion of the Livingstons at ‘Clermont,’ on the Hudson, he\r\nhad passed his winters in the town house in New York, which swarmed with\r\nslave servants. From boyhood, his society had been eagerly sought. With\r\nhis fleeing mother he had witnessed from a hilltop his loved home given\r\nto the flames by British soldiers; and to his dying day he carried a\r\npoignant memory of the parting of his sister with her hero husband,\r\nRichard Montgomery, when he set forth for his final fight. Lafayette had\r\nbeen so captivated by the charming youth while visiting his home that he\r\nhad vainly importuned his mother for permission to take him to France;\r\nand when the young man attended the Marquis a way on the Boston road, so\r\nromantic was the attachment that the latter had urged the youth to make\r\nthe journey, nevertheless, with the promise to conciliate the family.\r\nHis was a unique charm, a fascinating personality.\r\n\r\nGraduating from Princeton, in the class with Giles, he had his choice\r\nbetween a life of laborious accomplishment and one of leisurely\r\nelegance. Society, the gayest, giddiest, most entrancing, held forth its\r\narms to him. His mother’s drawing-room was always crowded with brilliant\r\nand beautiful women and clever men, attracted partly by the exquisite\r\ncharms of the widow of Montgomery. He had an income, a town and country\r\nhouse, slaves to do his bidding, and he turned from the enticing\r\nprospect to bury himself in the assiduous study of the law. Now and then\r\nhe laid his books aside to flirt with Theodosia Burr, to dance with the\r\npretty belles, to play for stakes with women at the gambling-table\r\ninseparable from the more fashionable houses--but only as a diversion.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he begun the practice of his profession when he took a\r\ncommanding position. Hard work, a noble ambition, and native talent made\r\nhim a success. But he could not have been a Livingston and indifferent\r\nto politics. Very early his capacity and popularity swept him into the\r\nfight. Strangely enough, he immediately became the idol of the masses.\r\nThis aristocrat was a democrat who was able to move in the crowd with a\r\ndistinction that commanded respect while compelling affection. Perhaps\r\nthe artisans, the clerks, the lowly were flattered by his smile and\r\ncondescension, perhaps captivated by his fighting mettle--whatever the\r\ncause, they loved him, gathered about and sustained him. The Tammany of\r\nhis time marshaled its forces for him, and all the wit and wiles of\r\nHamilton could not harm him. But the Federalists hated him. What moral\r\nright had a man of wealth and intellectual distinction and social\r\nprestige to affiliate with the ‘mob’? They hated him as deserters are\r\nhated--he was an American Égalité to Mrs. Bingham’s drawing-room, and\r\nWolcott hated him less because he ‘lived like a nabob’ than because he\r\nfought like the devil.[1107]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nQuite a different type was Albert Gallatin--and yet both were born\r\naristocrats. From the beginning of the republic at Geneva in the\r\nsixteenth century, his family had been second to none in prestige and\r\npower. The governmental system was aristocratic; his people were\r\nuncompromising aristocrats, and five Gallatins had been, at one time or\r\nanother, head of the State. Into this reactionary atmosphere he was\r\nborn, and in it he passed his youth. At the home of his grandmother, a\r\ndomineering but clever old autocrat, who believed in the divine right of\r\nthe aristocracy to rule, he often met Voltaire. Strange couple, that old\r\nwoman worshiping tradition, and that cynical old philosopher sneering it\r\naway. And yet in his family Gallatin was an exotic. Instinctively he\r\ndespised the system his people thought sacred. Rousseau may have\r\ninfluenced him, but he was probably born with democracy in his blood.\r\nWhen his grandmother arranged to get him a commission in the mercenary\r\narmy of her friend the Landgrave of Hess, and he scornfully refused on\r\nthe ground that he would ‘never serve a tyrant,’ the old woman boxed his\r\nears--but without jarring his principles.[1108] He was a grave\r\ndisappointment in the family circle. It is a notable coincidence that\r\nlike Hamilton he was remarkably precocious. He graduated from the\r\nAcademy of Geneva in his seventeenth year, first in his class in\r\nmathematics, natural philosophy, and Latin translation. There, too, he\r\nhad studied history under Müller, the eminent historian, and in the\r\nfacts and philosophy of world history he was to have no equal in\r\nAmerican public life. Nothing contributed more to his desertion of his\r\ncountry than his hatred of its petty aristocracy, its autocratic rule.\r\n\r\nHe was a dreamer in his youth. Was it Rousseau who planted in him a\r\ndislike of cities and a passion for the wilderness? Secretly he left\r\nGeneva and came to America, landing in Boston. He carried a letter of\r\nintroduction from Benjamin Franklin to his son-in-law, the father of the\r\neditor of ‘The Aurora’ at Philadelphia. A few dreary months in Boston, a\r\nhappier winter in a cabin in the wilderness of northern Maine, a year at\r\nHarvard as a teacher of French, a short time in Philadelphia in a\r\nboarding-house with Pelatiah Webster, the political philosopher, and\r\nthe lure of land speculation led him to Virginia. There, in Richmond,\r\nsome of his happiest days were passed. Society was courteous, kindly,\r\nand there he came in contact with great minds. John Marshall invited him\r\ninto his office with the prediction that he would distinguish himself at\r\nthe Bar, and Patrick Henry advised him to go West, with the observation\r\nthat he was intended for statesmanship. At this time he was a youth of\r\ntwenty-one with a pronounced foreign accent. Washington met him, and,\r\nimpressed with his keenness, offered to make him his land agent--an\r\nhonor happily declined. Then into the wilderness of Pennsylvania; a\r\nhouse on a hilltop which he called ‘Friendship Hill’; a domestic\r\ntragedy--the death of his young wife; and soon the Whiskey Boys, keen of\r\nvision as Marshall, Henry, or Washington, literally swept him into\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nHe was primarily a democrat and an opponent of strong government.\r\nFascinated by the work of the Constitutional Convention, he thought the\r\nExecutive had been given too much power. But he was opposed to tinkering\r\nwith constitutions once adopted.[1109] As a member of the convention to\r\nrevise the Constitution of Pennsylvania, he worked as earnestly as had\r\nMadison in the greater convention, fighting with moderation, but\r\npersistence for a popular government, for the freedom of the press, and\r\npopular suffrage. It is significant that when the subject of courts was\r\nreached he sought the advice of John Marshall--and received it.[1110]\r\nHis views on the French Revolution were those of Jefferson. He\r\nrecognized the many excesses, the greed of demagogues for power, and he\r\ndid not expect ‘a very good government within a short time,’ but he knew\r\n‘their cause to be that of mankind against tyranny’ and that ‘no foreign\r\nnation has the right to dictate a government to them.’[1111] One glance\r\nat Genêt revealed to him the naked man--‘totally unfit for the place he\r\nfills,’ his abilities ‘slender.’[1112] Yet, like Jefferson, despite the\r\nmassacres in Paris and the Genêt excesses in Philadelphia, he clung to\r\nFrance because, ‘if France is annihilated, as seems to be the desire of\r\nthe combined powers, sad indeed will the consequences be for\r\nAmerica.’[1113] If he opposed the Excise Law, as was his right, he had\r\na reason, and it was sane.[1114] The charge the Federalists were to\r\nmake, that he had incited the hard-pressed pioneers to violations of the\r\nlaw, was maliciously false. Throughout that insurrection, his part was\r\nhard, and he met it with sanity and courage.\r\n\r\nThis was the background of this remarkable man when, at the age of\r\nthirty-five, he stepped forward with the confidence of a veteran to\r\nassume the intellectual leadership of the Jeffersonians in the House. A\r\nshy man in social relations, he was utterly fearless in debate. There\r\nwas no mind in that body so well stocked with facts, and none with a\r\nbroader vision or deeper penetration. There was no one more masterful in\r\nlogic, more clear, downright, incisive in statement, and none more\r\nimpervious to abuse. His was the dignity of a superior mentality. If his\r\nforeign accent was still pronounced, and members, priding themselves on\r\ntheir refinement and taste, sneered openly, he remained the perfect\r\ngentleman, indifferent to such jeers. In the midst of excitement, he was\r\ncalm. When others were demoralized, he kept his head. No greater figure\r\never stood upon the floor of an American Congress than when Albert\r\nGallatin appeared, to force notable reforms in the fiscal system, and to\r\nchallenge the Federalists to an intellectual combat that would call\r\nforth their extreme exertions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and brilliant debates in American history,\r\nsurpassing that on the Foote Resolutions, was precipitated early in\r\nMarch when Edward Livingston threw a bomb into the complacent camp of\r\nthe Federalists with resolutions calling upon the President to lay\r\nbefore the House the instructions and papers pertaining to the Jay\r\nTreaty. There was some maneuvering in the beginning to feel out the\r\nposition of the enemy, and then the members settled down to a month of\r\nmemorable debating. On the whole, the discussion was pitched upon a high\r\nplane, for the question was one of constitutional interpretation.\r\nThroughout, there was scarcely a touch of personalities, albeit Tracy,\r\ndescribed by his admirers as the ‘Burke of Connecticut,’ and by his\r\nenemies as the ‘Burke of Connecticut without his intelligence,’ could\r\nnot restrain a stupid sneer at the accent of Gallatin who led for the\r\nenemies of the treaty. A Pennsylvania member denounced Tracy’s vulgar\r\nconduct as ‘intolerable,’ and there were many cries of ‘order.’ With the\r\nbrazen effrontery of his school, Tracy asked Speaker Dayton to decide,\r\nand that rather disreputable speculator, if not peculator, held it in\r\norder to insult Gallatin with impunity.[1115] But this incident was\r\nhappily unique.\r\n\r\nThe Livingston Resolutions were based upon the theory that the House was\r\na party to the treaty in that it would be asked to make appropriations\r\nto carry it into effect, and that the facts were necessary to the\r\ndetermination of its course. This was in perfect accord with the\r\nposition of Jefferson.[1116] The Federalists contended that the\r\nPresident and Senate alone were officially concerned, and that the House\r\nwas obligated to carry out any financial arrangements entered into in a\r\ntreaty. Did not the Constitution specifically say that the treaty-making\r\npower was lodged in the President and the Senate? Conceded, replied the\r\nopposition, but the Constitution also said that money bills must\r\noriginate in the House, and in making appropriations for any purpose the\r\npopular branch of Congress is constitutionally bound to use its own\r\ndiscretion. Both sides could, and did, appeal to the Constitution. There\r\nwas nothing merely factious or obstructive in the fight of the\r\nopposition, and it is impossible to peruse the seven hundred and nine\r\npages of the debates without a realization of the complete sincerity of\r\nthe participants. Into the debate dashed all the leaders of the first\r\norder. The galleries were packed. The discussion was the sole\r\nconversational topic in streets and coffee-houses. The newspapers\r\nprinted the leading speeches in full. Even the Federal courts injected\r\nthemselves into the controversy, and one jurist introduced a\r\ndenunciation of the enemies of the treaty into his charge to the grand\r\njury.[1117] Fenno stupidly stumbled into the blunder of proving the\r\nopponents of the treaty a ‘Robespierre faction’ by quoting the London\r\n‘Morning Chronicle,’[1118] and Cobbett, the Englishman and Federalist\r\npamphleteer, selected this particular time to outrage the Philadelphia\r\n‘rabble’ by filling his windows with pictures of kings, queens,\r\nprinces, dukes, Pitt, Grenville, and George III. With studied insolence,\r\nhe added some portraits of American Revolutionary heroes, and ‘found out\r\nfit companions for them.’ Thus he ‘coupled Franklin with Marat’ and\r\n‘M’Kean and Ankerstrom.’[1119]\r\n\r\nThe burden of the debate was borne by Gallatin, Madison, Livingston, and\r\nGiles for the Resolutions, and by Sedgwick and Griswold against them.\r\nLivingston spoke with spirited eloquence and with that power of\r\nreasoning which was afterward to compel his recognition as one of the\r\nforemost political thinkers of his time.[1120] Giles sustained his\r\nreputation as a fluent, forceful, slashing debater. Madison spoke with\r\nmoderation; but the honors of primacy fell to Gallatin. He was a\r\nrevelation, and the Federalists were beside themselves with rage. Tall,\r\nand above medium size, his fine face aglow with intelligence, his black\r\neyes burning with earnestness, his profile resembling in its sharp\r\noutlines that of a Frenchman, his accent foreign, his delivery slow and\r\na little embarrassed, he spoke with a clarity and force that made the\r\nFederalists wince. Livingston was more showy, Giles more boisterous,\r\nMadison more academic. This new man was another Madison with greater\r\npunch.[1121] He did not wander a moment from his argument--the\r\nconstitutional rights of the House in the case of treaties involving\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\n‘The House has a right to ask for papers,’ he said, ‘because their\r\ncoöperation and sanction is necessary to carry the Treaty into full\r\neffect, to render it a binding instrument, and to make it, properly\r\nspeaking, a law of the land; because they have a full discretion to\r\neither give or refuse that coöperation; because they must be guided in\r\nthe exercise of that discretion by the merits and expediency of the\r\nTreaty itself, and therefore they have a right to ask for every\r\ninformation which can assist them in deciding that question.’ Whence led\r\nthe argument of the foes of the Resolutions? ‘The Constitution says that\r\nno money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of\r\nappropriations made by law. But treaties, whatever provisions they may\r\ncontain, are law; appropriations may therefore be made by treaties. Then\r\nthe shortest way to carry this treaty into effect would have been to\r\nadd another article appropriating the money.’ Turning to the power of\r\nthe House of Commons in the case of treaties involving an appropriation,\r\nhe found an analogy to the constitutional power of the President and the\r\nSenate, in the power of the King to make treaties. But no one in England\r\nchallenged the right of the Commons to appropriate or not in putting the\r\nprovisions of a treaty into effect--and the speaker cited instances\r\nwhere the Commons had rejected treaties by refusing appropriations. ‘Are\r\nwe in a worse situation than Great Britain?’ he asked. ‘Is the House of\r\nRepresentatives ... the immediate representatives of the American people\r\nranked below the British House of Commons? Shall the Legislative power\r\nbe swallowed up by the Treaty-making power as contended for here, though\r\nnever claimed even in Great Britain?’ The issue raised by the opposition\r\nto the Resolutions was clear, and their rejection would be ‘tantamount\r\nto saying that the House abandons their share in legislation, and\r\nconsents that the whole power shall be centered in the other branches.’\r\n\r\nSuch, in general, was the tenor of the argument for the Resolutions;\r\nwhile the Federalists insisted that the House possessed no power to\r\nrefuse any appropriation called for by a treaty--and thus the discussion\r\nwent round and round like a wagon wheel in motion. Sedgwick, in\r\njustifying the Senate’s power, made a blunder on which the supporters of\r\nthe Resolutions seized and with which they played throughout the\r\ndiscussion. The Senators were safer than the Representatives, he\r\nthought, because the former were not chosen by ‘an ignorant herd, who\r\ncould be cajoled, flattered, and deceived.’\r\n\r\nAt length the vote was taken, and the Resolutions adopted by 61 to 38.\r\nGallatin and Livingston, chosen by the House, personally presented the\r\ncall for the papers to Washington, who promised an answer after\r\nconsideration. An answer, sneered Bache, which sounds like that which\r\nthe King of France used to give to his subjects.[1122]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen Livingston introduced his Resolutions, Hamilton, in New York, was\r\nmomentarily at sea. His first impression was that they were ‘of\r\ndoubtful propriety.’[1123] Within a few days, after discussions with\r\n‘those who think,’ he was persuaded that the papers should be\r\nrefused--possibly on the ground that no purpose could be served unless\r\nimpeachment proceedings against Washington were in contemplation.[1124]\r\nHere we have, in a flash, the political strategy outlined--to convince\r\nthe people that the Jeffersonians were planning the expulsion of\r\nWashington from office. Again the Federalist war-cry--‘Stand by the\r\nPresident!’ But a week later, Hamilton wrote King that the papers should\r\nbe refused on the ground that the House had nothing to do with treaties,\r\nand that they were laws of the land to which the House had to\r\nconform.[1125] Learning of the adoption of the Resolutions, Hamilton\r\nwrote Washington to refuse compliance and to await suggestions that\r\nwould be sent the next day.[1126] Two days later, he was mortified at\r\nhis inability to send the promised papers, but he was at work upon them.\r\nMeanwhile, the papers should not be sent because the instructions to Jay\r\nwould ‘do no credit to the Administration.’ Some would disappoint and\r\ninflame the people.[1127] Two days after this, Washington sent his reply\r\nto the House, following Hamilton’s instructions and using some of his\r\nphraseology, even to the convenient suggestion of an impeachment.[1128]\r\nThe House, with equal firmness and with a dignified moderation,\r\nresponded with resolutions reaffirming its right--and the issue was\r\nmade.[1129] Almost immediately the introduction of a resolution\r\nproviding the appropriation threw the House into another month’s battle,\r\non the treaty itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nUp to this time the congressional struggle had caused little excitement\r\namong the people. Now the idea that the Union itself was at stake was\r\nassiduously put out by the Federalist leaders. The Senate practically\r\nceased to function. When Senator Tazewell called attention to the\r\naccumulation of business and urged action, King bluntly told him it was\r\npurposely held back, and that if the House failed to appropriate for the\r\ntreaty, the Senate would consider all legislation at an end, and he\r\nwould assume the Union dissolved. The next day Cabot expressed something\r\nof the same sentiment. In important commercial circles there was much\r\nloose talk of the dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe action of Washington, on the other hand, had aroused resentment and\r\ndisgust. Jefferson, with his usual prescience, had foreseen it while\r\nhoping against it. ‘I wish that his honesty and his political errors may\r\nnot furnish a second occasion to exclaim, “curse on his virtues, they\r\nhave undone his country,”’ he had written of Washington to Madison three\r\ndays before the refusal was sent to Congress.[1130] Madison thought the\r\ntone and temper of the presidential letter ‘improper and indelicate,’\r\nand suggested that Jefferson compare it with ‘one of Callimus’ last\r\nnumbers ... and the latter part of Murray’s speech.’[1131] It was\r\nreserved to Bache, as usual, to strike the harsh note. ‘Thus though his\r\ndecision could not be influenced by the voice of the people, he could\r\nsuffer it to be moulded by the opinion of an ex-Secretary,’ he wrote.\r\n‘Thus ... though he has apparently discharged the nurse, he is still in\r\nleading strings.’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the attacks on the Treaty were spreading consternation in all\r\ncommercial quarters and infuriating the Federalist leaders. ‘A most\r\nimportant crisis ensues,’ wrote Hamilton to King a week after the debate\r\nopened; and he outlined a plan of action in the event the appropriations\r\nwere refused. The President should send a solemn protest to the House\r\nand a copy to the Senate. That body should pass a resolution strongly\r\ncommending the protest and advising the President to proceed with the\r\nexecution of the Treaty. Then the merchants should meet in all the\r\ncities, adopt resolutions commendatory of the position of the President\r\nand Senate, and invite their fellow citizens to coöperate with them.\r\nPetitions should be circulated throughout the country. The Senate should\r\nrefuse to adjourn until the terms of the members of the House had\r\nexpired. Washington should send a confidential apology to England. ‘The\r\nglory of the President, the safety of the Constitution depend upon it.\r\nNothing will be wanting here.’[1132]\r\n\r\nHamilton immediately set his machinery in motion, and thus, while the\r\ndebate was at high tide in the House, the political leaders were busy\r\nwith the country. King had written of the alarm of the merchants in\r\nPhiladelphia. ‘Our merchants here are not less alarmed and will do all\r\nthey can,’ Hamilton replied. Arrangements had been made for the\r\ninsurance people to meet that day; the merchants and traders would meet\r\nthe next. A petition would be put in circulation.[1133] Two days later,\r\nhe wrote jubilantly of the action of the merchants. ‘Unexampled\r\nunanimity,’ he said. And more--‘persons to-day are going through the\r\ndifferent wards’--presumably with petitions.[1134] That very day he was\r\nwriting Wolcott that ‘the British Ministry are as great fools or as\r\ngreat rascals as our Jacobins, else our commerce would not continue to\r\nbe distressed as it is, with their cruisers.’[1135]\r\n\r\nThe very day that Hamilton was writing of the distress of the New York\r\nmerchants, Madison was writing to Jefferson of the plans of the\r\nDemocrats. While a merchants’ petition had been circulated in\r\nPhiladelphia, he promised that ‘an adverse petition will be signed by\r\nthree or four times’ as many people. In New York and Boston similar\r\npetitions would be put out. In Baltimore little could be expected, for\r\nthere, while originally against the treaty, they had been won over ‘by\r\nthe hope of indemnification for past losses.’[1136] Five days later, he\r\nreported progress. The Philadelphia petition against the treaty greatly\r\noutnumbered that for it, and petitions were being circulated in Delaware\r\nand New Jersey. The insurance companies in Philadelphia and New York\r\nwere seeking to intimidate the people by stopping business. The banks\r\nhad been active peddlers of petitions in the cities where there was\r\n‘scarce a trader or merchant but what depends on discounts.’ A hateful\r\npicture, thought Madison. ‘Bank Directors soliciting subscriptions are\r\nlike highwaymen with a pistol demanding the purse.’[1137]\r\n\r\nBoston found the Federalists triumphant in a town meeting dominated by\r\nthe eloquence of Otis, who played upon the horrors of war, and thus gave\r\nAmes and the other party leaders their cue. It was on this occasion that\r\nthe orator, who had studied French under Gallatin at Harvard, and been\r\ntreated kindly, referred to the latter sneeringly as a nobody who had\r\ncome to America without a second shirt on his back. Later, to the\r\ndisgust of his Federalist co-workers, he had the decency to apologize to\r\nGallatin.[1138] Everywhere the latter was being deluged with\r\nbillingsgate. There was not contempt here--there was hate. Noah Webster,\r\nin the ‘Minerva,’ was sneering at his foreign birth, while taking his\r\ncue from Hamilton, born in the West Indies; attacking his position on\r\nthe excise with falsehoods and innuendoes; charging him with being an\r\nagent of France. Adams, of the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ replied with a\r\nparody, substituting Hamilton for Gallatin and England for France and\r\nmaking as good sense.[1139] Wolcott was writing his father that it was\r\n‘neither unreasonable nor uncandid to believe that Mr. Gallatin is\r\ndirected by foreign politics and influence.’[1140] Nothing could have\r\npained the sensitive Wolcott more than the feeling that he was being\r\nuncandid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the fight in the House went on--Gallatin in the forefront.\r\nThe Federalists were thoroughly frightened over the prospect, resorting\r\nto every device to gain votes. Dreadful pictures of war if the treaty\r\nfailed, appeals to ‘stand by Washington,’ and intimidation--these were\r\nfavorite devices. ‘I am told,’ wrote Wolcott, with evident pleasure,\r\n‘that if Findlay and Gallatin don’t ultimately vote for their\r\n[treaties’] execution, their lives will be scarcely spared.’[1141] But\r\nfrightened and afraid of a vote, they decided ‘to risk the consequences\r\nof a delay, and prolong the debates in expectation of an impulse from\r\nsome of the districts on their representatives.’[1142] However, a vote\r\ncould not be indefinitely delayed. Public business was at a standstill.\r\nEverything possible had been done. The bankers had been sent out with\r\npetitions to their creditors. The insurance companies had stopped\r\nbusiness. The merchants had passed resolutions. Petitions had been\r\ncirculated. Washington’s glory had been pictured as in jeopardy. And the\r\nhorrors of war had been described. The time had come to close the\r\ndebate. The greatest orator in the country was their spokesman, and he\r\nhad been held back for the last appeal. The time had come for Fisher\r\nAmes to make the closing plea.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFisher Ames was not only the premier orator of his party; he was one of\r\nits most brilliant and captivating personalities. He had a genius for\r\nfriendship and was good company. Nature had blessed him with her richest\r\nintellectual gifts. His precocity equaled that of Hamilton or\r\nGallatin--he was a prodigy. At six he was studying Latin, at twelve he\r\nhad entered Harvard, and there he was conspicuous because of his\r\nscintillation. His powers of application were equal to his natural\r\nability, but he found time for relaxation when his animation, wit, and\r\ncharm, combined with modesty, endeared him to his fellows and won the\r\naffection of his instructors. Even at Harvard he was ardently\r\ncultivating the art of oratory, and the style then formed, while\r\nstrengthened by age and experience, never greatly changed. Cicero was\r\nhis model through life. During his preparation for the Bar, his appetite\r\nfor good literature was not neglected, and he delved deeply into ancient\r\nhistory and mythology, natural and civil history, and he pored over the\r\nnovelists and lived with the poets--Shakespeare, Milton, Virgil. These\r\nwere fruitful years and the Federalists were to get the harvest. At the\r\nBar he instantly took rank as a pleader, but he found time to write\r\narticles on the political affairs of the time. In the convention called\r\nto ratify the Constitution, he disclosed the political prepossessions\r\nthat were to govern his career. While not hostile to a republican\r\nexperiment, he was skeptical of republics, fearing the domination of\r\npopular factions. These factions he considered the rabble. Democracy, he\r\ndespised. He was an aristocrat by instinct and this guided his political\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nHe would have distinguished himself in literature had he devoted himself\r\nto it. He wrote, as he spoke, out of a full mind, and his first draft of\r\nan article required no polishing or revision. This made him an amazingly\r\nbrilliant extemporaneous orator. Although the slow processes of logical\r\nargumentation were not beyond him, he depended more on illustration. His\r\nmind fairly teemed with images. The poets had endowed him with their\r\ngift. There was something Shakespearean in the fertility of his fancy,\r\nand he delighted his hearers or readers with his rapidly changing\r\npictures. These came spontaneously, and, leaving an indelible\r\nimpression on his audience, they were lost to him with their utterance.\r\nHe scattered gems as though they were grains of the sea, and he the\r\nowner of the sands of the shore. Remarkably enough, this did not lead\r\nhim to rhetorical flamboyance or over-elaboration. He was a master of\r\nthe short sentence, and he possessed rare powers of condensation.\r\n\r\nIn social relations he was lovable, but he carefully selected his\r\nintimates, having no stomach for the commonplace person. His companions\r\nwere of the élite. Among them he was simplicity itself, and generosity\r\nand kindness, but no man had a more brutal wit or sarcasm for a foe.\r\nAbove middle height and well proportioned, he held himself erect. There\r\nwas little in his features to distinguish him, for they were not\r\nstrongly marked. His forehead was neither noticeably high nor broad; his\r\nblue eyes were mild and without a suggestion of the fire of domination;\r\nhis mouth was well formed, but not strong; but his voice was melody\r\nitself. One who often heard him found that ‘the silvery tones of his\r\nvoice fell upon the ear like strains of sweetest music’ and that ‘you\r\ncould not choose but hear.’[1143] There was more than a touch of\r\naristocratic cynicism in his nature, and his favorite weapon in attack\r\nwas sarcasm, but he was ordinarily considerate of the feelings of a foe\r\nin combat. No other member of the House could approach him in the\r\neloquence of persuasion.[1144]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHappily married to a beautiful woman, Ames had built himself an elegant\r\nhome at Dedham where he lived and was to die, but in the fall of 1796 he\r\nhad little expectation of lingering long to enjoy it. Nothing had\r\nenraged him more than the popular agitation against the Jay Treaty, and\r\nin the midst of the fight he suffered a physical collapse. In September,\r\nhe was unable to ride thirty miles without resting for a day.[1145] He\r\nhad consulted various ‘oracles’ and found that he was bilious, nervous,\r\ncursed with a disease of the liver, and he had been ‘forbidden and\r\nenjoined to take almost everything’--meat--cider--a trotting horse--and\r\nto refrain from excess of every kind.[1146] In October, with the\r\ncongressional battle approaching, he had a relapse--‘extreme weakness,\r\nwant of appetite, want of rest.’ Faint hope then of reaching\r\nPhiladelphia at the first of the session, ‘if ever.’ Still, the cool\r\nweather might restore him. Philadelphia, perhaps, by December.[1147] But\r\nDecember found him at Dedham, with King writing him of the desperate\r\nprospects in the House and urging his presence,[1148] and in January\r\nAmes was writing Jeremiah Smith of his resolve to go on to Philadelphia.\r\n‘Should this snow last, I am half resolved to jingle my bells as far as\r\nSpringfield.’ At any rate, on the morrow he would go to ‘my loyal town\r\nof Boston in my covered sleigh by way of experimenting of my\r\nstrength.’[1149]\r\n\r\nFebruary found him on the way. At New Haven where he lodged, the snow\r\ngrew thin, and ‘there was great wear and tear of horse flesh.’ At\r\nStamford it was gone and he took a coachee. At Mamaroneck, twenty-five\r\nmiles from New York, he slept, and awoke to find the snow ‘pelting the\r\nwindows.’ Back with the coach, and a wait for the sleigh. Even so, he\r\nwrote, ‘to-morrow I expect to hear the bells ring and the light horse\r\nblow their trumpets’ on reaching New York. ‘If Governor Jay won’t do\r\nthat for me, let him get his treaty defended by Calumus, and such\r\nunder-strappers.’ Two days in New York--three more--and Philadelphia.\r\n‘Do not let me go down to the pit of the Indian Queen,’ he had written a\r\ncolleague. ‘It is Hades and Tartarus, and Periphlegethon, Cocytus, and\r\nStyx where it would be a pity to bring all the piety and learning that\r\nhe must have who knows the aforesaid infernal names. Please leave word\r\nat the said Queen, or if need be at any other Queens where I may unpack\r\nmy weary household gods.’[1150] The day before this letter was written,\r\nBache’s paper said that the ‘ratification is not to arrive until Mr.\r\nAmes has recovered,’ because ‘the subaltern officers of the corps not\r\nbeing supposed sufficiently skilled in tactics to be entrusted with the\r\nprincipal command.’[1151] Six days later, he announced Ames’s arrival in\r\nNew York.[1152] Thus, like a warrior borne to battle on a stretcher,\r\nAmes entered the capital.\r\n\r\nAll through March he sat in silence listening to the debate on\r\nLivingston’s Resolutions, groaning under his physical disability. ‘I am\r\nnot a sentry, not in the ranks, not on the staff,’ he wrote in disgust.\r\n‘I am thrown into the wagon as part of the baggage.’[1153] With the\r\ndebate on the treaty itself about to begin, he wrote that he was ‘not\r\nfit for debate on the treaty and not able to attend through a whole\r\nsitting.’[1154] Thus he watched the swaying fortunes of the fight, sick\r\nand feeble, but expected to save the day in a pinch. When he rose that\r\nApril day to make the final effort for his party, there was drama in the\r\ngeneral appreciation of his condition. That Ames enjoyed it, we have no\r\ndoubt. It was so much like Chatham carried into the House of Peers\r\nwrapped in his flannels.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAmes was a consummate actor that spring day. Not without art did he\r\nbegin with a reference to his frailty. Here was a man ready to die for a\r\ncause. Impassionedly he pleaded against passion. The treaty, he said,\r\nhad ‘raised our character as a nation.’ Its rejection would be a\r\n‘violation of public faith.’ It had ‘more critics than readers,’ and\r\n‘the movements of passion are quicker than those of understanding.’\r\nLightly he touched upon the constitutional question, and then hastened\r\nto his purpose--to discuss the consequences of rejection, to play on\r\nfear. With this he expected to win his fight--with this he won. Reject\r\nthe treaty and leave the posts in the hands of the British and invite\r\nwar?\r\n\r\n‘On this theme,’ he said in his most thrilling tones, ‘my emotions are\r\nunutterable. If I could find words for them ... I would swell my voice\r\nto such a note of remonstrance, it would reach every log house beyond\r\nthe mountains. I would say to the inhabitants, wake from your false\r\nsecurity, your cruel dangers, your more cruel apprehensions are soon to\r\nbe renewed; the wounds yet unhealed, are to be torn open again; in the\r\nday time your path through the woods will be ambushed, the darkness of\r\nmidnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. You are a\r\nfather--the blood of your son shall fatten your corn field. You are a\r\nmother--the war whoop shall waken the sleep of the cradle.... By\r\nrejecting the posts we light the savage fires, we bind the victims. This\r\nday we undertake to render account to the widows and orphans whom our\r\ndecision will make; to the wretches who will be roasted at the stake; to\r\nour country; and I do not deem it too serious to say, to our conscience\r\nand God. The voice of humanity issues from the shade of the wilderness;\r\nit exclaims that while one hand is held up to reject this treaty, the\r\nother grasps a tomahawk. It summons our imagination to the scenes that\r\nwill open.... I can fancy that I listen to the yells of savage vengeance\r\nand the shrieks of torture; already they seem to sigh on the western\r\nwind; already they mingle with every echo from the mountains.’\r\n\r\nHow the frontiersmen in the gallery must have stared at this solicitude\r\nfor them from a Federalist of New England!\r\n\r\nThen, in closing, a perfect piece of art. ‘I have perhaps as little\r\npersonal interest in the event as any one here. There is, I believe, no\r\nmember who will not believe his chance to be a witness to the\r\nconsequences greater than mine. If, however, the vote should pass to\r\nreject, and a spirit should rise as it will, with the public disorder to\r\nmake confusion worse confounded, even I, slender and almost broken as my\r\nhold upon life is, may outlive the governments and Constitution of my\r\ncountry.’ He sank into his seat. ‘My God,’ exclaimed a Federal Judge,\r\n‘did you ever hear anything like it?’ Crusty old John Adams wiped his\r\neyes. Accept, said Ames, or England will turn the savages upon you;\r\naccept, or your Constitution will be overthrown; accept, or the Republic\r\nwill be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists were jubilant--as was Ames, none the worse for the\r\nspeech. Soon Christopher Gore was writing him from London that he knew\r\nhis speech was ‘in the hands of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas and Lord\r\nGrenville.’[1155] The Jeffersonians were alarmed. Madison was bitter\r\nbecause of the summons to ‘follow Washington wherever he leads.’[1156]\r\nSoon he was to find that ‘the name of the President and the alarm of\r\nwar’ had done mischief.[1157] When the roll was called, several enemies\r\nof the treaty had been frightened from the firing line. Patton of New\r\nJersey had a convenient illness. Varnum was unavoidably absent. Freeman\r\nof New Hampshire had obtained leave of absence, and a newly elected\r\nDemocrat from Maryland discreetly withheld his credentials until after\r\nthe fight was over. By a majority of three the House decided to\r\nappropriate. Even so, it was the most expensive victory the Federalists\r\nhad won, for the majority in the country was on the other side. Out of\r\nthe struggle had emerged a new great leader to serve the Jeffersonians,\r\nAlbert Gallatin. Jefferson had been so delighted with his speech that he\r\nwrote Madison that it deserved a place in ‘The Federalist.’[1158] During\r\nthe remainder of the session, he was to cause much mental distress with\r\nhis fiscal reform plans and his attacks on the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nJefferson had followed the fight on the treaty from his mountain, making\r\nno personal effort to influence the result. It had not been so easy as\r\nhe had hoped to forget politics in the cultivation of his peas, and when\r\nCongress met he had subscribed for Bache’s paper.[1159] He divided the\r\nfriends of the treaty into two classes; the honest who were afraid of\r\nEngland, and the dishonest who had pecuniary motives. At no time did he\r\nquestion the honesty of Washington. In his letters to Madison he poured\r\nforth his innermost thoughts, but beyond this his correspondence had not\r\nbeen extensive.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to set down as a pose his pretended indifference to\r\nthe Presidency in 1796, but there is evidence enough that he was deeply\r\nconcerned over his health. He had begun, as he thought, ‘to feel the\r\neffects of age,’ and was convinced that his health had ‘suddenly broken\r\ndown.’[1160] In a letter to Washington touching on political topics, he\r\nwrote that he would ‘put aside this disgusting dish of old fragments and\r\ntalk ... of peas and clover.’[1161] In July, with the Federalist press,\r\nin expectation of his candidacy, intemperately denouncing his letter to\r\nMazzei, he was writing a friend his estimate of the height of the Blue\r\nRidge Mountains, explaining his plan for a moulding-board, and\r\nexpressing his indignation because of the silly attacks on the memory of\r\nFranklin.[1162]\r\n\r\nFenno and Webster were working themselves into a frenzy over the letter\r\nto Philip Mazzei, the Italian, in which Jefferson had frankly discussed\r\nAmerican politics. It contained nothing that Jefferson had not\r\nrepeatedly said to Washington’s face. ‘An Anglican\r\naristocratical-monarchical party’--this the theme. But he had hinted\r\nthat Washington had been captured by the aristocrats and\r\nmonarchists--and here was treason. Webster said so with all his\r\nvocabulary, and there was some ridiculous talk of impeaching the author\r\nof the letter after his election to the Vice-Presidency, but throughout\r\nit all Jefferson made no public comment, no denial, no explanation. He\r\nwas ever the consummate politician.[1163] The announced decision of\r\nWashington to retire made Jefferson’s candidacy a certainty, whether he\r\nwilled it or not. Three years before, the Democrats had decided. All\r\nthrough the summer and autumn that was the understanding.\r\n\r\nTo the Hamiltonians the retirement of Washington was peculiarly\r\ndistressing. On most controversial subjects he had ultimately adopted\r\ntheir view. More than one of their unpopular measures had been saved\r\nwith their war-cry, ‘Stand with Washington.’ With Washington eliminated,\r\nit was vitally important to Hamilton and his leaders to find a successor\r\nwho would be more or less subservient. Hamilton himself was out of the\r\nquestion for the reason that Hamilton had given--he did not have the\r\nconfidence of the people. Jay, who would have been the second choice,\r\nwould have been a red rag to the ‘rabble’ in 1796. Few of the other\r\nleaders, with all their brilliancy and personal charm, could have made a\r\npopular appeal; and Adams was thoroughly distrusted and disliked by the\r\nHamiltonians because of his independence.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Hamilton and King, consulting, conceived the\r\nidea of persuading Patrick Henry to be a candidate. Just what appealed\r\nto them has never been satisfactorily explained, for Henry had been\r\namong the most bitter and brilliant enemies of the ratification of the\r\nConstitution. With the acquisition of wealth, great changes had occurred\r\nin the old patriot’s manner of thinking, and he had come to lean\r\nstrongly toward the Federalists.[1164] Fear of Jefferson and a desire to\r\nbreak the solidarity of Virginia’s vote may have been a determining\r\nmotive. That an effort was being made to find a candidate who would\r\nappeal to the South and West appears in King’s letter to\r\nHamilton.[1165] Whatever the motive, the decision to offer Henry the\r\nsupport of the Hamiltonians was reached, and John Marshall was asked to\r\napproach him.\r\n\r\nThe old orator was living quietly and happily at ‘Red Hill,’ his home in\r\nthe country, where he liked nothing better than to drag his chair out\r\nunder the trees, tilt it against one of the trunks, and, with a can of\r\ncool spring water beside him, look out lazily across the green valley.\r\nThere, with his family and friends about him, he asked nothing better\r\nthan to be let alone.[1166] Motives of discretion and the limitations of\r\na letter dissuaded the chosen emissary from writing to ‘Red Hill,’ but\r\nHenry Lee, who knew Henry more intimately, was asked to write him an\r\nintimation of what was in the air. No answer was forthcoming. Very soon,\r\nhowever, the old patriot would be in Richmond and Marshall would then\r\nsound him, and, discovering an indisposition to embark on the\r\nenterprise, would ‘stop where prudence may direct.’[1167] Thus Henry was\r\ncautiously approached, without being given any intimation of the source\r\nof the suggestion, and was found ‘unwilling to embark in the\r\nbusiness.’[1168] Thus ended the flirtation with Patrick Henry, with the\r\nfriendly conspirators hidden behind the fan.\r\n\r\nAnticipating a declination, Hamilton and King had canvassed the\r\navailability of Thomas Pinckney, the American Minister in London. ‘It is\r\nan idea of which I am fond in various lights,’ wrote Hamilton to King.\r\n‘I rather wish to be rid of Patrick Henry that we may be at full liberty\r\nto take up Pinckney.’[1169] This was due to the feeling that ‘to his\r\nformer stock of popularity he will now add the good will of those who\r\nhave been peculiarly gratified with the Spanish treaty’--which he had\r\nnegotiated.[1170] Thus the inner circle of the Hamiltonians settled the\r\nmatter for themselves without reference to the rank and file of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThomas Pinckney was one of the finest gentlemen of his time. Tall,\r\nslender, erect, with handsome features and a princely bearing, he was a\r\nsuperb figure of a man. His manners were those of the natural\r\naristocrat; he was courteous, dignified, and charming. A perfect\r\nself-control was reflected in the repose of his features and the tone of\r\nhis voice. Though of ardent temper, he kept a tight rein upon it, and he\r\nbecame a master of persuasion and conciliation. A man of artistic\r\ntemperament, with a touch of architectural genius, he planned his own\r\nhouses, all imposing, and his town house in Charleston was the first to\r\nhave self-supporting stairs four stories high. His library was one of\r\nthe most extensive in the country. While lacking luster, there was a\r\ncharm in his personality and a solidity in his character that appealed\r\nto men of conservative disposition. Born of wealthy parents, he had been\r\neducated in England, at Westminster, Oxford, and the Temple, and he had\r\nattended the fencing and riding school of Angelo in London. He had been\r\ntrained as one destined to command. Through his English experiences he\r\npassed without yielding one jot of his robust Americanism, and he fought\r\nin the Revolution and was once left wounded on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nAs Governor of South Carolina, he had served with distinction; as\r\nMinister to England, he had stubbornly maintained positions that Jay was\r\nto yield; and as Minister to Spain he had electrified the country with a\r\nsignal triumph. Matching wits with the celebrated Godoy, he had secured\r\na treaty establishing our southern limits from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, making the river our western boundary, and throwing it open\r\nto our navigation with an outlet to the Gulf and the privileges of the\r\nport of New Orleans. It was this achievement, hailed with enthusiasm in\r\nsections where the Federalists were weak, that led to his selection by\r\nHamilton and King.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1796 was one of scurrility, albeit both Jefferson and\r\nAdams, favored by the rank and file of the Federalist Party, comported\r\nthemselves becomingly. The party press teemed with silly attacks and\r\npersonalities. Adams was a monarchist, an aristocrat, a panter after\r\ntitles, an enemy of the masses, the defender of the red-coated assassins\r\nof the Boston massacre; and Jefferson was a French tool, a friend of\r\nanarchy, the inciter of the Whiskey Insurrection, a foe to public\r\ncredit, an atheist, an enemy of the Constitution,[1171] an incompetent\r\nin office, and a plagiarist who had stolen his essay on weights and\r\nmeasures from a pamphlet with which Noah Webster was familiar.[1172]\r\nWorse still: Adet, the French Minister, ‘better supplied with money than\r\nFaucet,’ was distributing it liberally in an effort to elect Jefferson,\r\nand had sent agents into the western country in his behalf. Had not\r\nGallatin been seen ‘in frequent conferences with Adet?’[1173] A grave\r\ndisappointment, this Adet who had such a ‘handsome wife’ and had seemed\r\n‘mild tempered, well educated and no Jacobin.’[1174] Then came Adet’s\r\nletter to Pickering reviewing the complaints of France against the\r\nAmerican Government, and mentioning Jefferson pleasantly in connection\r\nwith his official acts--and the Federalists had an issue. France was\r\ntrying to dictate a President to America. Her Minister was\r\nelectioneering. Fenno and Noah Webster were hysterical, Hamilton was\r\npleased, Pickering, the new Secretary of State, was frothing so\r\nfuriously as to disgust the Federalist leader in New York.[1175] Madison\r\nwas disgusted too,[1176] and the notorious Judge Chase was demanding the\r\njailing of editors who had dared publish the Adet letter which had been\r\ngiven to the press.[1177] What though Bache did point out that the\r\nletter was written on instructions from Paris given before the\r\nannouncement of Washington’s retirement--it was a campaign screed![1178]\r\nSoon it was the paramount issue, and the ‘Aurora,’ accepting it, was\r\nurging Fenno to spare some of his indignation for ‘the scourging of an\r\nAmerican at a British gangway as Captain Jessup was scourged,’ and the\r\nshooting of a brother of a member of Congress trying to escape from a\r\nBritish press gang.[1179] Meanwhile, strange things were happening\r\nbehind the screen in Federalist circles.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nHamilton was planning a repetition of the scheme he engineered in 1789,\r\nto bring Adams in second, with Pinckney first. He had never cared for\r\nthe downright Puritan of Quincy, and the latter had never forgiven him\r\nthe reduction of the Adams vote far below that of Washington in the\r\nfirst election. During the first Administration, Adams’s vote was\r\nindispensable to Hamilton’s policies on several occasions, and it had\r\nnever failed. Thus there was no opposition to his reëlection. But the\r\nPresidency--that was different. It was evident that Adams was not a man\r\nto be led around by the nose by any man or clique, and Hamilton had\r\nnever been a god of his idolatry. Thus, during the summer and autumn of\r\n‘96, Hamilton was busy with a subterranean plan to substitute Pinckney\r\nfor Adams in the Presidency by arranging for Federalist electors,\r\nscattered over the country, to vote to a man for Pinckney, while\r\nthrowing a few Adams votes away on other men. As the high man was\r\nelected President and the second Vice-President, he expected to carry\r\nhis point by management.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, however, that all his followers were in on the\r\nsecret. His ever-faithful servitor, Oliver Wolcott’s father, either knew\r\nnothing of it or disapproved, for he feared that the juggling would\r\nresult in the election of Jefferson, to the Vice-Presidency at\r\nleast.[1180] In the event of his election to the Presidency, Wolcott\r\nhoped ‘the northern States would separate from the southern.’[1181] As\r\nfate would have it, the suspicious Adams anticipated some such attempt\r\nto trick him, and his friends decided quietly to offset any possible\r\nAdams losses by dropping a few Pinckney votes to a third party. The\r\nresult was a Jeffersonian sweep in the West and South, with the\r\nexception of Maryland, where Adams had a majority of three. Of the\r\nthirty-nine New England votes, Pinckney received but twenty-two, while\r\nall went to Adams. Such was the result of Hamilton’s strategy. Adams was\r\nelected with 71 votes, and Jefferson, with three votes less, had eight\r\nmore than Pinckney.\r\n\r\nThus the hated leader of the Democrats became Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThen, too late, the Hamiltonians realized their mistake. Wolcott groaned\r\nthat Jefferson in the Vice-Presidency ‘would be more dangerous than as\r\nPresident.’[1182] His very willingness to accept the position was\r\n‘sufficient proof of some defect of character.’ Chauncey Goodrich was in\r\naccord. ‘We must expect him to be the nucleus of a faction,’ he wrote,\r\n‘and if it will give him some greater advantage for mischief, it draws\r\nhim from his covert.’[1183] Ames dreaded his election as ‘a formidable\r\nevil.’[1184] Hamilton buried his chagrin in a cynicism. ‘Our Jacobins\r\nsay they are pleased that the Lion and Lamb are to lie down together,’\r\nhe wrote King. ‘Mr. Adams’s personal friends talk a little the same\r\nway.... Skeptics like me quietly look forward to the event, willing to\r\nhope but not prepared to believe. If Mr. Adams has vanity ’tis plain a\r\nplot has been laid to take hold of it.’[1185] These hints at the\r\npossible seduction of Adams were not without some justification.\r\n\r\nMadison had urged Jefferson to accept the Vice-Presidency on the ground\r\nthat ‘your neighborhood to Adams may have a valuable effect on his\r\ncounsels.... It is certain that his censures of our paper system, and\r\nthe intrigues at New York for setting Pinckney above him have fixed an\r\nenmity with the British faction.’[1186] Before receiving this letter,\r\nthe incomparable strategist at Monticello had written Madison that in\r\nthe event of a tie he should ‘solicit on my behalf that Mr. Adams may be\r\npreferred.’[1187] Could he, by any chance, have expected this admonition\r\nto reach Adams in any way? A few days later, we find him writing\r\ndirectly to Adams expressing regret that they had been put in opposition\r\nto one another. It seemed, he said, that Adams had been chosen. Of\r\ncourse he might be ‘cheated’ by ‘a trick worthy of the subtilty of your\r\narch-friend of New York who has been able to make of your real friends\r\ntools to defeat their and your best wishes.’ Personally, he asked no\r\nhappier lot than to be left ‘with the society of neighbors, friends, and\r\nfellow-laborers of the earth’ rather than with ‘spies and\r\nsycophants.’[1188] Four days later, we find him writing Madison of his\r\nwillingness to serve under Adams. ‘He is perhaps the only sure barrier\r\nagainst Hamilton’s getting in.’[1189] Other letters probably phrased for\r\nAdams’s eye went out from Monticello, referring to their ‘ancient\r\nfriendship.’ But he wanted no place in the counsels of the\r\nAdministration--and that was significant enough.[1190]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Jefferson letter to Adams, sent to Madison to be\r\ndelivered or withheld according to his judgment, was put aside. There\r\nwas a ‘general air’ in the letter indicative of the difficulty under\r\nwhich it was written. Adams might resent the reference to Hamilton.\r\nAgain he might interpret Jefferson’s expressed preference for the simple\r\nlife as a reflection on his own ambition. ‘You know the temper of Mr.\r\nAdams better than I do,’ wrote Madison, ‘but I have always conceived it\r\nto be a very ticklish one.’ The Jeffersonian press had begun to speak in\r\nkindly tones of Adams to the disgust of the Federalists.\r\n\r\nThen, one bitter cold day, the family carriage appeared at the door of\r\nMonticello, and the master carefully supervised the packing of the bones\r\nof a mastodon which he had recently acquired and wished to present to\r\nthe Philadelphia Philosophical Society, of which he had been elected\r\npresident. Thus he reached the capital on March 2d, to be received,\r\nagainst his expressed wishes, with gun-fire and a procession flying a\r\nflag inscribed: ‘Jefferson, Friend of the People.’ He went at once to\r\nFrancis Tavern to pay his respects to Adams.\r\n\r\nThus the new Administration began, Bache sending a brutal parting shot\r\nat the old--an insult to Washington.[1191] But the star of Hamilton had\r\nnot set, for Adams had foolishly retained the Washington Cabinet,\r\nhand-picked by his ‘arch-friend of New York,’ and the congressional\r\nleaders were still under the magic spell of the old Federalist chief.\r\nThat was the cloud on the horizon, small that day, but destined to grow\r\nbigger and blacker until the storm broke, leaving much wreckage behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nAN INCONGRUOUS PORTRAIT GALLERY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that in the days of the Adams Administration it was not the\r\nfashion to paint group portraits of the President and his Cabinet. Had\r\nit been the custom, a purely commercial artist might have left us a\r\nconventional picture of no special interest; but had the task fallen to\r\na great artist of intuitive penetration, capable of seizing upon the\r\nsalient characteristics and the soul of his subjects, the result would\r\nhave been a fascinating study in incongruities and clashing spirits. The\r\nsuspicion on the round, smug face of Adams; the domineering arrogance on\r\nthe cold Puritan countenance of Pickering; the suave and smiling\r\ntreachery in the eyes of Wolcott; and the effeminate softness and\r\nweakness in the physiognomy of McHenry would have delighted a gallery\r\nthrough the generations.\r\n\r\nAli Baba among his Forty Thieves is no more deserving of sympathy than\r\nJohn Adams shut up within the seclusion of his Cabinet room with his\r\nofficial family of secret enemies. No other President has ever been so\r\nenvironed with a secret hostility; none other so shamelessly betrayed by\r\ntreachery. The men on whose advice he was to rely were not even of his\r\nown choosing. He inherited them--that was his misfortune; but he meekly\r\naccepted them--and that was his weakness. Where Washington had begun\r\nwith at least two advisers of transcendent ability, he was to undertake\r\nhis task with the assistance of an official family that exceeded\r\nmediocrity only in the field of treachery and mendacity. Not only were\r\nthey to disregard his wishes--they were to conspire against him. Not\r\nonly were they to ignore his leadership--they were to take orders from a\r\nprivate citizen who was his political rival and personal foe. Years\r\nlater, the relative of one was solemnly to justify their disloyalty with\r\nthe remarkable statement that, having been appointed by his predecessor,\r\n‘they owed him nothing’; and to defend their retention of place despite\r\ntheir indisposition to serve him honestly with the astounding assertion\r\nthat ‘the interest of their party and the wishes of their friends\r\nprevented them.’[1192]\r\n\r\nWe are interested in the personalities of these men primarily because it\r\nwas not only not ‘in the interest of their party’ for them to remain,\r\nbut ultimately destructive. The taxes, the standing army, the Alien and\r\nSedition Laws would have weakened, and might have destroyed, Federalism;\r\nthe party treachery within the Cabinet would have wrought its ruin\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nJohn Adams was a very great man and a pure patriot, with many fatal\r\ntemperamental weaknesses. Like Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom he strongly\r\nsuggests, he would have thrived in an atmosphere of admiration. Had he\r\nbeen surrounded by incense-throwers and idolatrous disciples applauding\r\nhis every utterance, forgiving his bursts of temper and smiling at the\r\npinching of their ears and the kicking of their shins, with a worshiping\r\nBoswell jotting down his conversations, he would have been supremely\r\nhappy and probably at his best. Like the genius who spread his tail\r\nfeathers so proudly at Streatham, he was vain, domineering, ponderous,\r\nat times tempestuous in his bursts of passion, disdainful of finesse,\r\ngiven to intemperate expressions, learned, prejudiced, often\r\nselfish--and a little fat. But he had played a noble part in the\r\nRevolutionary struggle, a dignified rôle in the diplomacy of the Old\r\nWorld, and he was entitled to something better than he received.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing thrilling in the appearance of Adams to captivate the\r\ncrowd. Below the medium height and rather full, he looked the stolidity\r\nof the English country gentleman[1193] and invited the sobriquet of the\r\nsharp-tongued Izard of ‘His Rotundity.’[1194] His fat round face would\r\nhave been less offensively smug had it not been so cold,[1195] and his\r\ndignity more impressive had it been less aggressive. The top of his head\r\nwas bald as a billiard ball, and, while he carefully powdered the\r\nremnant of his hair, nothing could have made this solid gentleman of the\r\nQuincy farm the glass of fashion. Unlike many of the public figures of\r\nthe time, he affected no foppery, and, while he dressed with\r\nconventional propriety, his garb was so little a part of himself that\r\nmost of the chroniclers of his time ignore it. We know that he appeared\r\none day for dinner at Mrs. Francis’s boarding-house in a drab-colored\r\ncoat[1196] and at his inauguration in ‘a full suit of pearl-colored\r\nbroadcloth.’[1197] Even the saturnine Maclay, who poked fun at all his\r\npeculiarities of appearance, could find nothing objectionable but the\r\nsword he affected when he first presided over the Senate.[1198]\r\n\r\nOf his manner in company we must reach a conclusion from a composite of\r\ncontradictions. Thanks to the Adams spirit of self-criticism, we have a\r\nconfession of the manners of his youth when he was prone to make a\r\ndisplay of his intellectual wares, and to prove his parts with sneering\r\nsarcasms about his elders.[1199] Years later, an English tourist was\r\nimpressed with his ‘somewhat cold and reserved manner’ and with ‘the\r\nmodesty of his demeanor.’[1200] In neither picture do we have an\r\nattractive personality, and are safe in assuming that it was not\r\npleasing, without drawing on the honest prejudices of Maclay. On the\r\nfirst attempt of the latter to establish social relations, he found\r\nAdams ‘not well furnished with small talk,’ and he was particularly\r\nstruck with his ‘very silly kind of laugh.’[1201] This interested the\r\nsour democrat from the Pennsylvania frontier, and, critically observing\r\nhis manner of presiding over the Senate, he complained that ‘instead of\r\nthat sedate easy air I would have him possess, he will look on one side,\r\nthen on the other, then down on the knees of his breeches, then dimple\r\nhis visage with the most silly kind of half smile.’[1202] This smile was\r\nevidently aggravating to the Senator’s gout, for we hear of it again at\r\na dinner at Washington’s where he was clearly angered when he caught the\r\ngreat man ‘ever and anon mantling his visage with the most unmeaning\r\nsimper that ever mantled the face of folly.’[1203] ‘Bonny Johnny Adams,’\r\nsnorts the Senator, more than once.[1204] Thus, painfully\r\nself-conscious, and without capacity for the appealing levity of banter,\r\nhe was temperamentally incapable of that personal approach that makes\r\nfor the intimacy of friendship. In the parlance of the day, he was a\r\n‘poor mixer,’ and this had the same effect on political fortunes then as\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThis alone would have made men indifferent, but he had a vanity that\r\ndrove them away. If we are to believe the common comment of friend and\r\nfoe, he was inordinately vain. With that strange, penetrating insight\r\ninto his own character, he appreciated this weakness in his youth, and\r\nno doubt sought to uproot a vice that was in the very fiber of his\r\nbeing. In the musings of his diary we have the frank admission: ‘Good\r\ntreatment makes me think I am admired, beloved, and my own vanity will\r\nbe indulged in me; so I dismiss my guard and grow weak, silly, vain,\r\nconceited, ostentatious.’[1205] On another page he promises himself\r\n‘never to show my own importance or superiority.’[1206] But the weakness\r\nincreased with age. ‘I always considered Mr. Adams a man of great\r\nvanity,’ wrote the father of one of his Cabinet to his son two weeks\r\nafter the inauguration.[1207] This quality was so predominant that both\r\nfriend and foe sought to turn it to advantage. Hamilton, in his\r\nill-advised attack, was able to refer to ‘the unfortunate foibles of\r\nvanity without bounds,’ without fear of contradiction.[1208] After his\r\nelection to the Vice-Presidency, this vanity became ‘ridiculous.’[1209]\r\nStrangely enough, there is some evidence that this very weakness was\r\nresponsible in part for his election to that post. Referring to the part\r\nplayed in the event by Dr. Rush and himself, Maclay wrote that ‘we knew\r\nhis vanity and hoped by laying hold of it to render him useful among the\r\nNew England members in our schemes of bringing Congress to\r\nPennsylvania.’[1210] But stranger still--and this is something to be\r\nkept in mind throughout--it was reserved for his greatest political\r\nopponent to predict to one of his lieutenants that, while Adams was\r\n‘vain’ and ‘irritable,’ ‘he is so amiable that I pronounce you will love\r\nhim.’[1211] The general effect, however, was far different from love. It\r\nunquestionably played into the hands of his enemies and neutralized the\r\neffect of both his ability and militant patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBecause of his inordinate vanity, he was susceptible to flattery, and\r\nthey who knew him best approached him accordingly. We have an\r\nillustration of it at the time of the decision to dismiss Genêt. There\r\nwas some question as to the attitude of Adams, and, knowing of his\r\nsecret jealousy of Washington, George Cabot, to whom was assigned the\r\ntask of guiding him favorably, called upon him one morning at an early\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Adams, this French Minister’s conduct seems to me to be the most\r\nobjectionable,’ ventured Cabot casually.\r\n\r\n‘Objectionable? It is audacious, sir,’ stormed Adams.\r\n\r\n‘I think if you were President you would not permit him to perform his\r\noffice very long,’ said the cunning Cabot.\r\n\r\n‘Not an hour, sir. I would dismiss him immediately.’\r\n\r\n‘I wish you would allow me to say to the President that such are your\r\nviews,’ said Cabot.\r\n\r\n‘Certainly, sir; I will say so to the President myself when I see\r\nhim.’[1212]\r\n\r\nThus the danger of Adams’s opposition was cleverly removed by conveying\r\nthe impression that the suggestion of a dismissal had come from him. So\r\nthoroughly were his enemies imbued with the idea that he could be led by\r\nsubtle flattery that the apologists for the traitors in his Cabinet,\r\ntaking note of his later harmonious relations with Marshall, explained\r\nthat these were due to the genius of the latter in insinuating his own\r\nideas into Adams’s head. However that may be, there was one thing that\r\nflattery could not do--it could not coax him from a principle or from\r\nthe performance of a patriotic duty. When the royal Attorney-General of\r\nMassachusetts undertook to flatter him into the service of the King in\r\nthe fight against the people eight years before the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, he failed utterly.\r\n\r\nThe violence of his temper made him difficult even to his friends, and\r\nhe had but few. He had a genius for embroilment, and dwelt perpetually\r\non a battle-field, sometimes real, often imaginary, but always genuine\r\nto him. Liancourt, calling upon him at Quincy and finding his\r\nconversation ‘extremely agreeable,’ noted, however, that it was ‘tinged\r\nwith a sort of sarcasm.’[1213] Madison, we have seen, referred to his\r\n‘ticklish’ temper.[1214] If a political opponent could give a moderate\r\ndescription of his weakness, and a Frenchman one so mild, the members of\r\nhis Cabinet felt no compulsion for restraint. Franklin had done him a\r\ngrave disservice in a brief but altogether friendly characterization\r\ncarrying the suggestion that he sometimes appeared mad. This was a hint\r\non which his enemies were to play as long as he lived. They took\r\nFranklin literally and called Adams ‘crazy.’ ‘What but insanity’ could\r\nhave led him to this or that? asks the biographer of Wolcott.[1215] ‘No\r\nsane mind could have imagined such a thought,’ he says again.[1216] ‘A\r\nweak and intemperate mind,’ writes one of his Cabinet to another.[1217]\r\nEven Jefferson, who was more considerate of him than others, thought his\r\nFrench war message ‘crazy.’ But it was reserved for McHenry to sum up\r\nhis enemies’ case against him. ‘Whether he is spiteful, playful, witty,\r\nkind, cold, drunk, sober, angry, easy, stiff, jealous, cautious,\r\nconfident, close, open, it is almost always in the wrong place or to the\r\nwrong person.’[1218] All of which means that he was super-sensitive,\r\nirritable, the victim of an ungovernable temper which drove him into\r\nspluttering rages on ridiculously slight provocations. Men shrank from\r\nconferences with him on subjects involving a difference of opinion. Then\r\nhe could be as insulting as Dr. Johnson without the advantage of having\r\nobsequious idolaters on whom to vent his rage. What a joy it would have\r\nbeen to have pitted these two men against each other on the question of\r\ncolonial rights! What a picture Boswell could have made of the\r\nencounter!\r\n\r\nAdams was difficult in conference, too, because of his suspicious\r\ndisposition. He could never quite persuade himself of the sincerity of\r\nhis conferee, and he carried a chip upon his shoulder. This suspicion of\r\nhis fellows had been a curse of his youth; it followed him to the grave.\r\nHe felt himself surrounded by envy, hatred, malice, and was inclined to\r\nsuspect that a good-natured smile was in derision. In youth he fancied\r\nthat his neighbors were anxious to retard his progress. He was miserable\r\nin London, where his reception, while cool, was not half so bad as he\r\nimagined. The British Minister in Paris could not disabuse him of the\r\nnotion that in London he would be looked upon ‘with evil eyes.’[1219]\r\nHis worst fears were realized in ‘the awkward timidity in general’ and\r\nthe ‘conscious guilt’ and shame in the countenances of the people.[1220]\r\nThis feeling that he was in the midst of enemies made him more than\r\never tenacious of his rights. He knew the privileges and civilities to\r\nwhich his position entitled him, and keenly felt his failure to receive\r\nthem. It was something he was never to forgive. The begrudging or\r\nwithholding of a right was always, to him, an affront instantly to be\r\nmet with a stormy challenge. ‘I am not of Cæsar’s mind,’ he wrote, soon\r\nafter becoming Vice-President. ‘The second place in Rome is high enough\r\nfor me, although I have a spirit that will not give up its right or\r\nrelinquish its place.’[1221] This sense of his deserts, because of\r\nability and services, goes far to explain his relations with Washington\r\nand Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is abundant that he resented the fame and popularity of\r\nWashington. Like Pickering, he did not share the enthusiasm over the\r\ngreat man’s military genius. During the war he had sometimes found fault\r\nwith his military tactics.[1222] Later, when he became the second\r\nofficial of the Republic, he secretly resented the distance that\r\nseparated him from the chief. He had played the patriot’s rôle long\r\nbefore Washington had shown a marked interest in the quarrel of the\r\ncolonies; had been one of the makers of the Revolution; had served with\r\ndistinction in diplomacy; and, unlike Washington, had studied politics\r\nand statecraft all his life. Why should he, with such a record, be so\r\ncompletely overshadowed, and why relegated to the end that upstarts like\r\nHamilton--‘the bastard brat of a Scotch pedlar’--might be pushed to the\r\nfront? This, the reasoning of his jealousy which was to destroy his\r\nperspective and lead him into trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThis was due in some measure to the distance between reality and the\r\ndream world in which he lived. As he grew older, he became more and more\r\nimpressed with the pomp of power. The son of a Yankee shoemaker was\r\ncovetous of the ribbons of distinction. The masses receded to a\r\nrespectful distance. In the forefront were the gods, and he among them;\r\nand among these he claimed a right to the front rank. Ceremony became\r\nimportant. Titles were safeguards of organized society. An order of\r\nnobility sprang up in his imagination. ‘You and I,’ he wrote Sam Adams,\r\n‘have seen four noble families rise up in Boston--the Crafts, Gores,\r\nDawes, and Austins. These are really a nobility in our town, as the\r\nHowards, Somersets, Berties in England.’ His feet lost contact with the\r\nearth--he soared. ‘Let us do justice to the people and to the nobles;\r\nfor nobles there are, as I have proved, in Boston as well as in\r\nMadrid.’[1223] Many things, he thought, can make for nobility--even\r\nmatrimony. ‘Would Washington have been Commander of the Revolutionary\r\narmy or President ... if he had not married the rich widow of Mr.\r\nCustis? Would Jefferson have been President ... if he had not married\r\nthe daughter of Mr. Wales?’ Thus he challenged John Taylor of\r\nCaroline.[1224]\r\n\r\nInfatuated with such views, he was naturally in harmony with his party\r\nin its contempt for democracy.[1225] ‘If our government does well I\r\nshall be more surprised than I ever was in my life,’ he said one day,\r\nstanding by the stove in the Senate Chamber before the gavel had fallen.\r\nCarroll ventured the opinion that it was strong enough. ‘If it is, I\r\nknow not whence it is to arise,’ Adams replied. ‘It cannot have energy.\r\nIt has neither rewards nor punishments.’[1226] This distrust of\r\ndemocracy was ingrained. We find it outcropping in his early life, as\r\ntoward the end. When he was summoned to go over the reply of the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature to the pretensions of Hutchinson, the royal\r\nGovernor, in 1773, he found ‘the draught of a report[1227] was full of\r\nvery popular talk and of those democratical principles that have done so\r\nmuch mischief to this country.’[1228] Even Paine’s ‘Common Sense,’ which\r\nwas tonic to the Revolution, was spoiled for him because ‘his plan was\r\nso democratical.’[1229] Haunting the bookstalls in London he thought\r\n‘the newspapers, the magazines, the reviews, the daily pamphlets were\r\nall in the hands of hirelings,’ and was convinced that the men who\r\n‘preached about ... liberty, equality, fraternity, and the rights of\r\nman’ could be hired ‘for a guinea a day.’[1230] It was after this that\r\nhe wrote the ‘Discourses of Davilla’--an onslaught on democracy. And\r\nfourteen years after his retirement he wrote from his library at Quincy\r\nto John Taylor: ‘Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes,\r\nexhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy that did not\r\ncommit suicide.’[1231] This distrust and distaste for the masses\r\nweakened him as much with the people as his temperamental defects with\r\nhis party associates. I have dwelt on these weaknesses because they\r\nexplain the tragedy of his failure. There were other qualities that\r\nentitled him to a happier fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nChief among these were the fervor and the disinterestedness of his love\r\nof country. Had he died the day after the signing of the Declaration, he\r\nwould have been assured a permanent place in history. No man played a\r\nmore heroic part in the fight for independence. The struggling young\r\nlawyer who refused a position under the Crown that he might not be\r\nembarrassed in supporting his countrymen in their inevitable\r\nstruggle;[1232] who, awakened by the sinister drum-beats of the red\r\ncoats every morning, ‘solemnly determined at all events to adhere to\r\n[his] principles in favor of [his] country’;[1233] who defended Hancock\r\nin the courts on the charge of smuggling with stubborn tenacity until\r\nthe case ‘was suspended at last only by the battle of Lexington’;[1234]\r\nwho, when the crisis came, prepared to immolate himself and family upon\r\nthe altar of liberty;[1235] and who had the audacity to base an argument\r\nagainst the Stamp Act on the principles of the Revolution itself, and,\r\nstanding four square against more petitions to the King, won the lasting\r\ngratitude and admiration of Jefferson when, as ‘the Colossus of the\r\nDebate,’[1236] he bore the brunt of the battle for the Declaration--that\r\nman could well hold his head high in the presence of Washington himself.\r\n‘Politics,’ he wrote Warren, ‘are an ordeal path among red-hot plough\r\nshares. Who then would be a politician for the pleasure of running about\r\nbarefooted among them. Yet some one must.’[1237] And again: ‘At such\r\ntimes as this there are many dangerous things to be done which nobody\r\nelse will do, and therefore I cannot help attempting them.’[1238] Nor\r\nwas he blind to his fate in the event of the failure of his cause. ‘I go\r\nmourning in my heart all day long,’ he wrote his wife in dark days,\r\n‘though I say nothing. I am melancholy for the public and anxious for my\r\nfamily.... For God’s sake make your children hardy, active and\r\nindustrious.’[1239] This intense Americanism did not moderate with\r\ntime. As a politician he was all too often open to censure; as a patriot\r\nhe was above reproach. Jefferson never doubted his absorption in his\r\ncountry; and Hamilton, temperamentally unable to get along with him,\r\nwrote him down as ‘honest, firm, faithful, and independent--a sincere\r\nlover of his country.’[1240] Because he had more enemies than friends,\r\nand more detractors than admirers, one might conclude from the opinions\r\nof his contemporaries that he had but mediocre ability. There is no\r\nquestion as to the fallibility of his judgment where his prejudices were\r\nenlisted and the characters of men were involved. Again we find\r\nJefferson more friendly than the Federalists. ‘A bad calculator of the\r\nforce and probable effect of the motives which govern men,’ he wrote;\r\nand then added, ‘This is all the ill that can possibly be said of him;\r\nhe is profound in his views and accurate in his judgment except where\r\nknowledge of the world is necessary to form a judgment.’[1241] Hamilton\r\nthought him ‘a man of an imagination sublimated and eccentric,’ and was\r\nnot impressed with his intellectual endowments.[1242] The father of\r\nWolcott thought him ‘of a very moderate share of prudence, and of far\r\nless real abilities than he believes he possesses.’[1243] And McHenry,\r\nhaving been expelled from the Cabinet for his disloyalty, declared ‘the\r\nmind of Mr. Adams like the last glimmerings of a lamp, feeble, wavering\r\nand unsteady, with occasionally a strong flash of light, his genius\r\nlittle, and that too insufficient to irradiate his judgment.’[1244] The\r\nAdams who emerges from these opinions is a man of ability often reduced\r\nto impotency by the lack of judgment. This is, no doubt, the whole truth\r\nabout his intellect. The sneers from men who could not forgive him for\r\nthe wrong they had done him, and from others who could not control him,\r\ncannot stand in the light of what he did, and said, and wrote.\r\n\r\nAs a writer, he suffers in comparison with Hamilton and Madison, and his\r\nmore ambitious productions, like the ‘Discourses of Davilla,’ while\r\nshowing much erudition and some ingenuity, are heavy and pompous. But in\r\nthe earlier days when he was writing shorter papers for the press, he\r\ndid better. Whether he could write or not, he loved to do it. The author\r\nof the earlier period was more interesting and attractive than that of\r\nlater times.\r\n\r\nHowever much the critics may quarrel over his capacity to write, the\r\nevidence is conclusive as to his ability to speak. As an orator he was\r\nthe Patrick Henry of New England. His argument against the Writs of\r\nAssistance in 1761 fired the heart of Otis and swept him into the ranks\r\nof the active patriots. Jefferson bears testimony to the power of his\r\neloquence in the fight for the Declaration. Given a cause that appealed\r\nto his heart and imagination, he never failed to find himself by losing\r\nhimself in the fervor of the fight.\r\n\r\nNor can there be any question of his courage. It required temerity to\r\nstep forth from the patriots’ ranks to face the representative of the\r\nCrown with the most audacious denials of his pretensions; courage, too,\r\nto lead the fight against further attempts at conciliation with the\r\nKing. But the most courageous act of his career was his defense in court\r\nof Captain Preston, the British officer charged with murder in the\r\nBoston massacre. Not only physical courage was here demanded, for he\r\ninvited personal attack, but moral courage at its highest. He was\r\ndependent for clientage on the Boston public and the victims of the\r\nmassacre were Bostonians. He was an American, and he was standing\r\nbetween a hated redcoat and an American revenge. He gambled with his\r\ncareer, for he armed his enemies with ammunition, and he was charged\r\nwith selling his country for an enormous fee. The fact that he received\r\nbut eighteen guineas would have been the answer, but he maintained a\r\ndignified silence. There is nothing finer or more courageous in the\r\nrecords of a public man.[1245] This courage was to stand him in good\r\nstead when he defied his party for his country in the French\r\nnegotiations, and played for the verdict of history.\r\n\r\nThis courage could only have sprung from the consciousness of an honest\r\nintent--and his honesty, personal or political, has never been\r\nquestioned. Sedgwick recommended him to Hamilton for the Vice-Presidency\r\nas ‘a man of unconquerable intrepidity and of incorruptible integrity,’\r\nand Hamilton was to find to his chagrin that the compliment was not\r\ngiven in a Pickwickian sense.[1246] And yet he was not a Puritan of the\r\nintolerant sort. In early life he was given to the reading of sermons\r\nand at one time confessed to an inclination to the ministry--but it did\r\nnot last long. In early manhood, we find him moralizing in his diary\r\nagainst card-playing, but not on moral grounds. ‘It gratifies none of\r\nthe senses ...; it can entertain the mind only by hushing its\r\nclamors.’[1247] Even the scurrility of his times spared him the charge\r\nof immorality. ‘No virgin or matron ever had cause to blush at sight of\r\nme,’ he wrote in his ‘Autobiography.’[1248] And while Franklin and\r\nMorris appear to have taken advantage of the moral laxity of Paris, we\r\nare quite sure that Adams, packed in tight among fashionable ladies\r\nwatching the Queen eat soup, never gave a flirtatious glance, and are\r\nmore than half persuaded that his declination to join Madame du Barry in\r\nher garden was due to her none too spotless reputation. But if he was\r\nnot given to women or to song, it appears that he consumed his full\r\nshare of wine. We have his own story of the fashionable dinners in the\r\nPhiladelphia of the Continental Congress, when he would sit at the table\r\nfrom three until nine ‘drinking Madeira, claret and burgundy.’[1249] We\r\nget a glimpse of him in a New York Club before the Revolution with\r\n‘punch, wine, pipes and tobacco.’[1250] And on another occasion he\r\nrecords with boastful pride that he ‘drank Madeira at a great rate and\r\nfound no inconvenience in it.’[1251] Even so, we may be sure that he\r\nseldom drank to excess.\r\n\r\nSuch the man who sat facing the Cabinet he did not choose--stubborn,\r\nsuspicious, vain, jealous, courageous, honest, irascible, tempestuous,\r\npatriotic, and rising above its members in ability and public service as\r\na mountain above the pebbles at its base.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNo student of physiognomy, familiar with the character of Adams, could\r\nhave glanced at the stern, cold Puritan face of Timothy Pickering, his\r\nSecretary of State, without a premonition of certain estrangement. The\r\nlong, thin, super-serious features were as uncongenial and unresponsive\r\nas though carved from granite. The thin, silvery locks and the\r\nspectacles combined to create an unpleasant impression of asceticism;\r\nand the cold eyes that peered through the glasses spoke of the narrow,\r\nuncompromising mind of a follower of Cromwell. There, too, he could\r\nread the insatiable ambition, the audacious courage, the relentless will\r\nof the Roman conqueror. Seldom did that face soften with a smile; for he\r\nhad no sense of humor. His portrait, by Stuart, as a frontispiece to a\r\nvolume of old New England blue laws would have symbolized the spirit of\r\nthe book. No Indian stoic ever presented a countenance less revealing in\r\nrepose, or more stone-like in composure. The resemblance to the\r\nRoundhead fanatic was accentuated in the extreme simplicity, the\r\nQuaker-like plainness of his garb.\r\n\r\nHere was clearly a man to whom joyous frivolity was indecent\r\ndissipation; with whom the scrutiny of suspicion was a duty; and to whom\r\nduties were the sum total of life. But beneath the repellently cold,\r\nmetallic exterior there were volcanic fires of passion, and when he\r\nemerged from the deadly calm of composure it was to storm. It was not in\r\nhis nature to confer, but to lay down the law. So lacking was he in a\r\nsense of humor that he honestly persuaded himself that he always stood\r\nat Armageddon and battled for the Lord. Even when he was moved to\r\ntreachery by an ambition wholly incongruous to his capacity, he really\r\nfelt that he was detached from all personal considerations and was\r\nfighting for the abstract principle of right.[1252] Never once in his\r\nlong life, even when he was a cheap conspirator planning the destruction\r\nof the Union, did he think himself in the wrong. Never once in his\r\nvoluminous correspondence does he hint at a possible mistake. He was, in\r\nhis political views and his personal relations, impeccably pure--and he\r\nadmitted it. Not only did he admit it--he impassionedly proclaimed it,\r\nand this alone made him an impossible adviser for John Adams. He was the\r\nsmug, self-righteous type that would remake the world in its own image.\r\nThey who disagreed with him were hounds of the devil to be thrown\r\nwithout pity into the uttermost darkness. And he was sincere in it all.\r\nHe was fond of hymns and psalms, in church devout, at prayer most\r\nfervent, and he read the Bible habitually without discovering the\r\npassage about the throwing of stones.[1253]\r\n\r\nThis temperament made him difficult in even ordinary conversation. He\r\nhad an excellent command of language, but he preferred the harsher\r\nwords. There was no twilight zone for him. Things were white or black.\r\nHe was violent in his opinions and violent in the gesticulation with\r\nwhich he tried to force them on his hearers. So little could he see\r\nhimself as others saw him that, when he once exclaimed, ‘I abhor\r\ngesticulation,’ with a powerful sweep of his muscular arms, he could not\r\nunderstand the smile of his auditor.[1254] But for this intemperance,\r\nall too much like that of Adams to make harmony possible, he would have\r\nbeen a great conversationalist. He used words with accuracy, was\r\ninteresting in narrative, and had read widely and wisely; but too\r\nfrequently to converse with Pickering was to quarrel. This unhappy\r\nquality, along with his poverty, explains why he did not figure in the\r\nsocial life of the Federalist capital. His tactlessness and bluntness,\r\nwhich he confused with honesty, were intolerable. In a letter to a\r\nfriend who had given an acquaintance a note of introduction, he wrote\r\nthat he should ‘not put myself to the expense nor my family to the\r\ntrouble of a splendid exhibition at table.’[1255] It must have caused\r\nsome mirth in the home of the elegant Binghams to read his reply to an\r\ninvitation to dinner: ‘Mrs. Pickering and I are constrained to forego\r\nmany pleasures of society, because we cannot persuade ourselves to enter\r\non a career of expenses, which, being far beyond our income, would lead\r\nto ruin. For this reason, Mrs. Pickering chooses to dine abroad only at\r\nMrs. Washington’s, as a consequence of my official station; and this as\r\nseldom as decency will permit.... But Mrs. Pickering is aware that as a\r\npublic man I cannot seclude myself ... and therefore often urges, on my\r\npart singly, an intercourse which is useful as well as agreeable. I\r\nshall, then, with pleasure, dine with you occasionally, but without\r\npromising to reciprocate all your civilities.’[1256]\r\n\r\nHere we have one of several traits that make him stand out among the\r\nother Federalist leaders as an exotic. He was poor, but not so poor as\r\nthe letter indicates; nor was he so completely shut off from society,\r\ndespite his frugality. If he gave no fashionable entertainments, his was\r\na home of hospitality, and he who promised no reciprocation for the\r\nentertainments of the Binghams was able to entertain at his board a\r\nfuture King of France.[1257] But, unfashionable, and plain as a Yankee\r\nhuckster, he found the ways of fashion irksome and offensive. Writing\r\nhis wife disgustedly of the enormous head-dresses of the Philadelphia\r\nladies, he added: ‘But you know, my dear, I have old-fashioned notions.\r\nNeither powder nor pomatum have touched my head these twelve months, not\r\neven to cover my baldness.’[1258] And the ‘extravagance of the\r\nprevailing fashions,’ suggested by the introduction of ‘the odious\r\nfashion of hoops’ convinced him that many families would be\r\nruined.[1259] Verily such a creature would have been grotesquely out of\r\nplace among his fellow Federalists in the gay drawing-rooms of Mrs.\r\nBingham.\r\n\r\nHe differed from them, too, theoretically at least, on a more vital\r\npoint. They were thorough aristocrats; he was instinctively a\r\ndemocrat--though he seemed to prefer it as an ideal rather than as a\r\nreality. Lodge recognizes this difference and explains that ‘he had all\r\nthe pride of the Puritan who gloried in belonging to the chosen people\r\nof God.’[1260] We can well believe the assertion of his son and\r\nbiographer that he liked the common people because among them he\r\nbelonged. Then, too, he inherited a respect for them from his father who\r\nardently espoused the cause of equal rights for all men, and was prone\r\nto apologize for the weaknesses of the poor, and to criticize people of\r\nwealth and power.[1261] With this inheritance he was to enter the field\r\nof controversy at twenty-five in a newspaper battle with the Tories of\r\nSalem with a letter which might have been written by Jefferson. ‘For\r\nwhom was government instituted?’ he wrote. ‘Was it solely for the\r\naggrandizement of the few, who, by some fortunate accident, have been\r\nbred in a manner which the world calls genteel? or to protect the lives,\r\nliberty and property of the body of the people? Is government supported\r\nby the better sort? On the contrary, has not every attack on the laws\r\nand constitution proceeded from that class? The very phrase, “friends of\r\ngovernment” is invidious and carries with it an impudent insinuation\r\nthat the whole body of the people, the pretended friends of government\r\nexcepted, are enemies to government; the suggestion of which is as\r\nridiculous as it is false.’[1262]\r\n\r\nThe tall, gaunt figure in plain garb, seated in company with the\r\nfashionable Hamilton or Morris, was not more incongruous than the mind,\r\ncapable even in youth of such heretical and ‘demagogic’ thoughts.\r\nStranger still, this liking for the common herd never wholly left him.\r\nThus his experiment in pioneering in the western wilderness--where\r\ndemocracy thrived best. A wholly admirable figure, this Pickering of the\r\nfrontier, applying brain and brawn to the conquering of the woods,\r\norganizing civil government, battling at the peril of his life for law\r\nand order, kidnaped and carted away. His own story of this adventure is\r\nas thrilling as a dime novel.[1263] Even then his faith in the people\r\nwas not destroyed.\r\n\r\nThus Pickering finally entered public life--a ‘friend of the people,’\r\nfarmer, frontiersman, unsuccessful merchant. About him there was no\r\nglamour of success. He had been a failure. At Harvard he had made a fair\r\nrecord, and his meager career as a lawyer was unsuccessful. He had\r\nfailed as a farmer, failed as a pioneer, failed as a Philadelphia\r\nmerchant because unfit for commercial life. He had played a spinet and a\r\nviolin and given lessons in sacred music at Salem and Marblehead, but\r\nthat could scarcely be deemed success;[1264] and in the army, where he\r\nwas capable as a trainer of raw recruits, his courage, energy, and\r\npromptness might have taken him far but for the handicap of\r\nshort-sightedness and glasses.[1265] Thus, when he entered the public\r\nservice at forty-six his career had been one of failure, and he was to\r\nget this new chance through importunate applications to a man he little\r\nrespected--for he had a poor opinion of the ability of Washington. Here\r\nagain he differed from other Federalists holding a similar opinion; he\r\ndid not simulate admiration.[1266] The naming of a child after\r\nWashington called for his sarcasm.[1267] He was disgusted during the war\r\nwhen a rustic was heard to say, ‘I suppose he [Washington] is the\r\ngreatest man in the world.’[1268] He criticized Washington as\r\nover-cautious[1269] and refused to hail him as a hero because he thought\r\nhim lacking in ‘eminent military talents.’[1270] He thought the army\r\nsuffered through his procrastinated decisions.[1271] Serving on the\r\ncommittee at the close of the struggle to formulate the answer of the\r\nofficers to the ‘Farewell Orders to the Armies of the United States,’ he\r\nreferred sarcastically to the word ‘Orders,’ and wrote his wife:\r\n‘Though it is rather modest, or in other words does not abound in\r\npanegyric, I think it (the reply) will be graciously received.’[1272] To\r\nanother he boasted that the reply was marked ‘as the Italians do some\r\nstrains of music--moderato.’[1273]\r\n\r\nBut land poor, and a failure, he was quite willing to serve under the\r\nman he did not appreciate. From the organization of the government, he\r\nwas an office-seeker, looking, not for a career, but for a job. There\r\nwas no demand for his services--he urged them. His brother-in-law, a\r\nmember of Congress, became his broker. He applied to Hamilton for an\r\nassistant secretaryship of the Treasury, to find it promised.[1274] In\r\nAugust his broker wrote him of a prospective vacancy in the\r\npostmaster-generalship and suggested that he see Washington at\r\nonce.[1275] A month later, Pickering made application,[1276] but his\r\ninterview with the President only resulted in a temporary position as a\r\nnegotiator with the Indian tribes. In May, 1791, he asked Washington for\r\nthe Comptrollership of the Treasury, to be refused,[1277] and it was not\r\nuntil August, after more than a year of persistent wire-pulling, that he\r\nwas recognized with the then comparatively unimportant post of\r\nPostmaster-General, which was not at that time a Cabinet position.\r\n\r\nThus he came into close contact with Hamilton, entered into his plans,\r\nmade himself useful, and slowly ascended, finally reaching the State\r\nDepartment with some misgivings, and only after many others had declined\r\nthe place. He owed everything to Hamilton, nothing to Adams, and, as he\r\nsat in sphinx-like silence at the Cabinet table, it was to Hamilton, not\r\nto Adams, that he looked as chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe same was true of Oliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury, albeit\r\nthese two men were, in most respects, the antitheses of each other.\r\nThere was nothing of saturnity and brooding silence in Wolcott--he\r\nsmiled. Both wore masks--one that of a stoic, the other that of a\r\nsmiling epicurean. They resembled in a common capacity for uncommon\r\ntreachery. In this, they both excelled. Both were professional feeders\r\nat the public crib and passionate panters after office.\r\n\r\nThe handsome Wolcott had infinitely more finesse in the art of\r\ndouble-dealing. He had read his Machiavelli to better advantage. If he\r\nwas to conspire with the enemies of the chief, he was to present an\r\never-smiling face to Adams in the conference room. He was too exquisite\r\na conspirator to seem one. He had early learned the advantage of smiling\r\nthrough; and leaving Adams, with his face wreathed in friendly smiles,\r\nhe could sit down to the writing of a letter to Hamilton with the same\r\nsmile still on his face. Life was altogether lovely and interesting to\r\nthis happy warrior who delivered his sword thrusts through curtains.\r\n\r\nThe son of an idol of Connecticut Federalists who was repeatedly elected\r\nto the governorship, Wolcott passed his boyhood in and near Litchfield,\r\nministering to a frail constitution by tending cattle and working on the\r\nfarm. He did not permit the war to interfere with his career at Yale,\r\nfelt no sentimental call to Valley Forge, and found that the rattle of\r\nmusketry need not interfere with his preparations for the Bar. Almost\r\nimmediately on the conclusion of these preparations, he found a job as a\r\nclerk in the office of the Committee of Pay Table, and such was his\r\nindustry and methodical efficiency that he rose in that line of the\r\ncivil service to be Comptroller of Public Accounts before the formation\r\nof the National Government.\r\n\r\nThis opened a new and fairer vista for an efficient bureaucrat, and the\r\nmoment the department of the Treasury was established he was ‘induced by\r\nhis friends’ to offer himself for a position.[1278] Even then,\r\nprofessional office-seekers merely yielded to the importunities of\r\nadmirers. The congressional delegation for Connecticut pressed hard for\r\nan appointment, and he was offered the post of Auditor of the Treasury\r\nat fifteen hundred dollars a year. We can scarcely conceive that he\r\nhesitated, though it is of record that his sponsors urged him to accept,\r\nand that Hamilton expressed the hope that he would not refuse. He had\r\nhoped for the Comptrollership--but that might follow. The fact that\r\nHamilton had favored him for the better place was promising.[1279]\r\nMeanwhile, on the salary, he could ‘live cheap and snug as you\r\nplease.’[1280] Thus he went upon the Federal payroll. Thus he came under\r\nthe observation and supervision of the genius at the head of the\r\nTreasury,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nthen the most powerful dispenser of patronage. Thus he was able to\r\npractice his ingratiating arts on one worth while. In little more than a\r\nyear he was made Comptroller on the recommendation of Hamilton, and when\r\nthat statesman retired to private life, it was he who lifted the\r\nfaithful servitor into the Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. There\r\nAdams found him; there, unhappily for him, he let him remain.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to leave the impression that Wolcott was without\r\nmerit. He was not brilliant, but he possessed an infinite capacity for\r\ntaking pains. Even in college, where he failed to sparkle, he was a hard\r\nstudent with ‘the strong reasoning faculties of the Wolcott family’ a\r\nlittle neutralized by ‘some eccentricities in reasoning.’[1281] In the\r\nTreasury, in subordinate positions, he had shown good judgment, much\r\npractical sense, a comprehensive acquaintance with business and business\r\nneeds, exceptional power of sustained application, no imagination, and a\r\ndog-like devotion to Hamilton. The latter found this combination of\r\nvirtues had not only made his conduct good, ‘but distinguished.’ More,\r\nhe had ‘all the requisites which can be desired,’ and these were\r\n‘moderation with firmness; liberality with exactness, indefatigable\r\nindustry with an accurate and sound discernment, a thorough knowledge of\r\nbusiness, and a remarkable spirit of order and arrangement.’[1282] In\r\nbrief, he was the perfect bureaucrat, the indispensable man Friday. If\r\nhe brought no political strength to the Administration, he could, with\r\ndependability, do the drudgery and register the will of others who\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nIf he was not a friend of the people, nor the electorate of him, he was\r\nthe courtier and friend of the powerful, and thus his was one of the\r\nfirst careers created by the social lobby. If he did not cultivate the\r\nvoters, he selected his friends with fine discrimination with the view\r\nof his own advancement. At Yale he cultivated Noah Webster and Uriah\r\nTracy, a potent writer and a powerful politician; he early profited by\r\nthe popularity and prestige of his father, and through his father’s and\r\nhis family’s influential friends; and socially, he made himself the\r\n‘bonny boy’ of the Hamiltonian circle, and smiled and joked himself into\r\nthe affections of the Bingham set. A beautiful and brilliant sister\r\nbrought him the championship of the clever Chauncey Goodrich and his\r\nassociates. A charming wife threw wide all the doors of the capital.\r\nWhile he was earning the grateful appreciation of Hamilton and the Essex\r\nJunto, this attractive wife was winning and deserving the tender\r\naffection of Mrs. Washington, with whom she was on terms of intimacy,\r\nand she was corresponding regularly with Nellie Custis.[1283] When\r\nWashington left public life, his wife gave the wife of Wolcott a lock of\r\nthe General’s hair and one of her own. The social lobby looked after its\r\nown--and Wolcott was its very own.\r\n\r\nFor this cultivation of the social lobby, he was well adapted, for he\r\nhad a genius for society, with his cheerful disposition, his playful\r\nmanner, his conversation, which, while sometimes sober, was usually gay.\r\nThe ‘small talk’ that Adams lacked, Wolcott had in full measure running\r\nover. A master of the art of banter, no one with entrée to Mrs.\r\nBingham’s could tell a joke better or more noisily enjoy one. His laugh\r\nwas hearty, frequent, and infectious. Living in a world of statistics,\r\nhe at least affected a love of literature, was fond of quoting poetry,\r\nand interested in the personalities of distinguished writers. His\r\nconversation after office hours could be light and graceful. Gracious,\r\nsmiling, ingratiating, this bureaucrat--one of the first--created and\r\nsustained by the social lobby as one of its first exhibits. He differed\r\nfrom Pickering as day from night, but like his sphinx-like colleague of\r\nSalem, he owed everything to Hamilton, nothing to Adams; and as he sat,\r\nsuave and smiling, at the Cabinet table, it was to Hamilton, not to\r\nAdams, that he looked as chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIf Pickering was a conspirator against Adams and did not care who knew\r\nit, and Wolcott a conspirator trying to conceal it, James McHenry, the\r\nSecretary of War, was a conspirator and scarcely knew it. The simplicity\r\nof this Irish immigrant is most disarming. Left alone, he would have\r\nbeen harmless. His was only another instance of loving, not wisely, and\r\ntoo well. Born in comfortable circumstances in Ireland, the impairment\r\nof his health through intensive application to his studies in an\r\nacademy in Dublin brought him to America on a recuperative voyage. So\r\nfavorably was he impressed that his family soon followed and his father\r\nopened a general store in Baltimore. A year later, we find him in an\r\nacademy in Newark, Delaware, and then in Philadelphia studying medicine\r\nunder the celebrated Dr. Rush. But he took as little to his profession\r\nas to the prosaic duties of the counting-room, and, thanks to inherited\r\nproperty, lived through the greater portion of his life as a gentleman\r\nof leisure. In nothing that he ever undertook did he attain distinction.\r\nThe practice of his profession was limited to a brief period as surgeon\r\nin the army; his career in commerce was almost as much curtailed; and he\r\nemployed his leisure as a dilettante in politics and literature.\r\n\r\nHad McHenry remained in Ireland, it is easy to imagine him as a young\r\nblade about Dublin, affecting the fashions, a bit dandified in dress,\r\nover-fond of society, given to verse. A searcher of souls might have\r\ndiscovered in him an ambition--to write poetry. Even in his academy days\r\nat Newark he was an inveterate verse-maker, and he thought enough of his\r\neffusions to send them to the papers. It was a weakness he never\r\novercame, and at his death they found a great portfolio full of rhymes.\r\nIt is possible--and it is this pathetic touch that makes one almost love\r\nhim--that he hoped for a posthumous volume as a memorial and\r\nmonument.[1284] Some of these lyrics are clever, light and graceful,\r\nreminders of the sort that even Curran liked to make for the amusement\r\nof his friends--thoroughly Irish. He could never have become a poet, but\r\nthere is evidence in his letters that had he turned his attention to the\r\nhumorous essay, he might have produced things worth while. These\r\nepistles are charming in their playfulness, sprightly, witty, glowing\r\nwith humor. No one among the public men of the period could have made\r\nposterity so much their debtor with letters on men, women, and\r\nevents--not even Morris, Ames, or Goodrich. He was really made for an\r\nobserver, rather than participant, in the harsh conflicts of life--more\r\nof a Horace than a Robert Walpole, more of a Boswell than a Johnson.\r\nDinners, dances, routs, these, and the writing of light verses, were\r\nenough to make him happy.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was not effeminate. If he did not play his part in the\r\naffairs of men with brilliancy or even efficiency, he did with courage\r\nand to the best of his ability. We have few references to his services\r\nas surgeon in the army. It was when he became one of Washington’s\r\nsecretaries that he fell completely under the fascination of Hamilton.\r\nEven before his resignation from the army, he had entered politics as a\r\nmember of the State Senate in Maryland, a rather important body\r\nconsisting then of but fifteen members. Here he was the representative\r\nof the commercial class. In the Constitutional Convention he was\r\nobscure, and strangely enough his views were the very opposite of\r\nHamilton’s. Speaking seldom, his voice was raised in warning against too\r\nmuch centralization.[1285] He was even favorable to a mere amendment to\r\nthe Articles of Confederation,[1286] and his chief interest was in the\r\nprovisions for the regulation of commerce.[1287] When the work was over,\r\nhe signed with avowed reluctance, and solely on the ground--which was\r\ncharacteristic--that he distrusted his own judgment, that amendments\r\nmight be made, and he was willing to take a chance.[1288] In the bitter\r\nfight over ratification in the Maryland Convention, he took but little\r\npart.\r\n\r\nEven so, the confidence and friendship of Washington and Hamilton were\r\nnot weakened. To him they looked from the beginning for advice on\r\nMaryland patronage, and Washington found it convenient to use him as an\r\nagent in matters of this sort.[1289] Hamilton thus employed him\r\nfrequently.[1290] Taking seriously his rôle as the Federalist boss and\r\ndistributer of the loaves and fishes, he resented the disregarding of\r\none of his recommendations, and even the long explanatory letter of\r\nHamilton failed to smooth his ruffled feathers.[1291] More than two\r\nyears were to elapse before his woman-like affection for his idol gained\r\nthe ascendancy over his resentment. ‘I have not ceased to love you nor\r\nfor a moment felt an abatement of my friendship,’ he wrote impulsively\r\nafter the long silence.[1292]\r\n\r\nLike Pickering and Wolcott, McHenry was persistent in his hints for\r\nplace. Six years before the Constitution went into effect, we find him\r\nsoliciting the influence of Washington to get him a diplomatic post in\r\nEurope, and the great man tried and failed.[1293] Among the first\r\nletters Hamilton received on entering the Cabinet was one from McHenry.\r\n‘I am not wholly lost to ambition,’ he wrote, ‘and would have no\r\nobjection to a situation where I might indulge and improve at the same\r\ntime my literary propensities, with, perhaps, some advantage to the\r\npublic. Would you, therefore, be good enough to feel ... whether the\r\nPresident has thought of me, or would, in such a case, nominate me. I\r\nwish you would do this for me as a thing springing entirely from\r\nyourself.’[1294] Nothing came of it, and the faithful party hack\r\ncontinued to run the errands of the Administration in Maryland. Three\r\nyears later, he took his courage in both hands and wrote directly to\r\nWashington asking to be sent to Paris and Vienna to attempt to secure\r\nthe release of Lafayette. He wanted a change of air. It would be no use,\r\nthe President replied.[1295] It was not until near the close of\r\nWashington’s eight years in office--and only then because many others\r\nhad declined--that he was finally summoned to Philadelphia to become\r\nSecretary of War. Would he have felt so much elated had he read\r\nHamilton’s comment on his capacity? ‘McHenry, you know,’ wrote the\r\nleader. ‘He would give no strength to the Administration but he would\r\nnot disgrace the office. His views are good.’[1296] But happily he did\r\nnot know, and jubilantly he gave up all private enterprises as\r\nincompatible with public office--for in such matters he was meticulously\r\nproper--and, mounting his horse, he rode to Philadelphia. He carried the\r\nconviction with him that he owed his honor to the earnest persistency of\r\nhis idol. To the extent indicated, this was true. The great genius of\r\nFederalism, now planning to continue his domination of the Government\r\nfrom his law office in New York, had reasons to believe that whoever\r\nmight be President, McHenry would be his own faithful servitor. When\r\nHamilton had married Betty Schuyler, his friend had journeyed to Albany\r\nwith some verses for the event. Was it with an indulgent smile that the\r\nbridegroom acknowledged the poem? ‘You know I often told you you wrote\r\nprose well, but had no genius for poetry. I retract.’[1297] Six years\r\nbefore the first inauguration of Washington, this ardent friend had\r\nwritten Hamilton: ‘Were you ten years older and twenty thousand pounds\r\nricher, there is no doubt but that you might obtain the suffrages of\r\nCongress for the highest office in their gift.’[1298] Verily it was not\r\nwithout an eye to the future that Hamilton found a place for such an\r\nidolater and political valet in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThere is something a bit wistful and pathetic about McHenry that\r\npersuades forgiveness for even his treachery to Adams. His were the sins\r\nof a lover, and love covers a multitude of sins. Nature intended him for\r\na snug harbor, and fate pushed him out upon tempestuous seas. His own\r\nbest epitaph has been written by himself: ‘I have built houses. I have\r\ncultivated fields. I have planned gardens. I have planted trees. I have\r\nwritten little essays. I have made poetry once a year to please my wife;\r\nat times got children, and at all times thought myself happy.’[1299]\r\nLike Pickering and Wolcott, he owed everything to Hamilton--nothing to\r\nAdams; and as he faced Adams in the Cabinet room, it was to\r\nHamilton--not to Adams--that he looked as chief.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the Cabinet, the Attorney-General, was a political\r\ncipher. Knowing what we now know of the characters and factional\r\naffiliations of the President and his advisers, it will not be difficult\r\nto follow the serpentine trail of the next four years, nor to understand\r\none of the forces that worked with Jefferson for the utter destruction\r\nof the Federalist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCOMEDY AND HEROICS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nScarcely had Adams entered upon his office when he found himself\r\nconfronted with the possibility of a war with France. Some time before,\r\nGouverneur Morris, the American Genêt in Paris, had been recalled, none\r\ntoo soon, and James Monroe had been sent to smooth the ruffled feathers\r\nof the French. Because he had followed his instructions too\r\nenthusiastically and failed to understand that ‘a diplomat is a person\r\nsent abroad to lie for his country,’ he had been recalled in disgrace,\r\nas Jefferson had foreseen, and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a Charleston\r\nFederalist, had been sent as Minister. Not only had the French\r\nGovernment refused to receive him, but he had been ordered from the soil\r\nof France. All this seems wicked perversity on the part of France\r\nwithout a hasty glance at the antecedents of the story.\r\n\r\nPrimarily nothing could have been more unfortunate than the appointment\r\nof Morris. No more charming or clever diplomat than this bosom friend of\r\nHamilton has served America abroad. Born to the purple, he was an\r\naristocrat by nature, with a blatantly cynical and contemptuous\r\nconception of the masses of mankind. His was the shimmer due to\r\ngenerations of polishing. As a young man in the society of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, he was enormously popular because he was handsome,\r\ndashing, witty, eloquent, a bit _risqué_ and in consequence of his\r\nfashionable and gilded background. In the Constitutional Convention no\r\none spoke with greater fluency or frequency--or with less effect. He\r\nsought the establishment of an aristocratic state, and made no secret of\r\nhis hostility to democracy. To an even greater degree than Hamilton he\r\nforeshadowed the extreme policies of the Federalist Party. He was, in\r\ntruth, its personification, able, brilliant, rich; socially delightful,\r\ncynical, aristocratic, masterful, and disdainful of the frontier.[1300]\r\nLike Hamilton, he failed in the Convention, but his was the hand that\r\nfashioned the phrasing of the fundamental law.\r\n\r\nThere was more than a hint of the fashionable _roué_ in this handsome\r\nfellow when he went to Paris. Women and their pursuit was ever an\r\nengrossing game with him. Even his graduation essay was on ‘Wit and\r\nBeauty,’ and for his Master’s Degree he wrote on ‘Love.’ He was the sort\r\nof beau that Congreve would have cherished, elegant in dress and manner,\r\ngiven to levity and light banter, eagerly sought. The loss of a leg\r\nthrough an accident in 1780 did not sour him nor diminish his appeal to\r\nwomen. On ‘a rough oak stick with a knob at the end,’[1301] he hobbled\r\non to his triumphs.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man sent to succeed Jefferson, the philosopher of\r\ndemocracy, at the moment the Revolution was breaking on the\r\nboulevards--a bitter, outspoken partisan of the old régime, a sarcastic\r\nenemy of the Revolution, a champion of privilege less compromising than\r\nthe nobility itself. While Genêt was intriguing against the Government\r\nin America, Morris was intriguing against the Government in France. But\r\nhis love flowers were still thrown over the garden wall of politics.\r\nJefferson had been shocked at his reactionary opinions in Paris. Madame\r\nLafayette had chided him on being an aristocrat.[1302] Quite early he\r\nbegan his affair with Madame de Flahaut, the novelist, a pretty, winsome\r\nwoman who effectively used her marriage to an old man as a lure for\r\nlovers, and his diary teems with references to the frail beauty. There\r\nwere evenings at her home, sneering at liberty and democracy; teas in\r\nher salon; drives and dinners, when he was entranced by the ‘spirituel\r\nand delicate repartee’ of his friend.[1303] Then walks in the Gardens of\r\nthe Tuileries and about the Champs Élysées, afternoons at Madame’s house\r\nreading ‘La Pucelle,’ while she rode about Paris in the well-known\r\ncarriage of the American Minister,[1304] and finally, when danger came,\r\nhe took her into his house. The Minister aimed high, and even the\r\nDuchess of Orleans was not above his amorous expectations, thinking her\r\nbeautiful enough ‘to punish the duke for his irregularities,’ and we\r\nfind him writing poems to her, and buying her a Newfoundland dog in\r\nLondon.[1305] No young blade ever found Paris more seductive.\r\n\r\nOn swept the Revolution, on came the Terror, with Morris openly and\r\ndefiantly sneering at the former and its principles. The coldness of the\r\ncrowds in the streets when the Queen rode by enraged him.[1306] In the\r\nterrible August days of 1792 he drove the reactionary Madame de Flahaut\r\nthrough the Bois de Boulogne,[1307] and when the nation imprisoned the\r\nKing he was soon neck-deep in intrigues to effect his rescue.[1308]\r\nMessages were exchanged with Louis, plans perfected, and only the King’s\r\ncourage failed. Later Louis made him the custodian of 750,000 livres to\r\nbe used in bribing those who stood in the way of his escape. America’s\r\nMinister was paymaster of the King seeking to join the allied monarchs\r\nin the crushing of the Revolution.[1309] Much of this was known in\r\nParis, and much of it known and approved by Federalist leaders in\r\nAmerica, Ames objecting to the publication of certain papers because\r\nthey would disclose Morris’s intolerable activities.[1310]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMonroe was the antithesis of Morris. Where Morris was brilliant, Monroe\r\nwas dull; where Morris was bubbling with a sense of humor, Monroe had\r\nnone at all; where Morris was a lover of dinners and dances, Monroe was\r\nindifferent; where Morris was a Cavalier, Monroe was a Puritan in his\r\nrelations with women; where Morris was an aristocrat, Monroe was a\r\ndemocrat; Morris was a monarchist at heart, Monroe, a robust republican;\r\nMorris an enemy of the French Revolution, Monroe, a friend. But if\r\nMonroe was not scintillating, he was sincere, and if not brilliant, he\r\nwas industrious.[1311] Soon he was as popular in Paris as Morris had\r\nbeen unpopular--so popular that Jay thought it not beneath his dignity\r\nas an American Minister to England to exchange belittling letters with\r\nGrenville about him. He had ironed out old differences when the Jay\r\nTreaty compromised his position.\r\n\r\nNo diplomat ever worked under more disheartening handicaps, for the\r\nFederalists in Philadelphia hated him, and months went by without a line\r\nof instructions or news from the State Department. Meanwhile,\r\nWashington was being poisoned against him by Federalist politicians who\r\nhad his ear, and in the spring of 1796 Madison wrote Monroe that his\r\nenemies had ‘been base enough to throw into circulation insinuations\r\nthat you have launched into all the depths of speculation’ and\r\n‘purchased the magnificent estate of the late Prince of Condé.’[1312]\r\nPickering and Wolcott were planning his recall that spring and writing\r\nHamilton about it.[1313] The latter was easily persuaded.[1314] Some one\r\nelse should be sent--some one not so friendly to the French. That the\r\nleaders of the English party were not averse to giving offense to France\r\nis shown in the astounding suggestion that William Smith, spouter of\r\npro-English speeches, written by Hamilton, that had been printed and\r\ncirculated in England, should be sent.[1315] It required no blundering\r\nby Monroe to pave the way for his recall--the politicians were sparing\r\nhim that trouble.\r\n\r\nHe had officially informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs that Jay was\r\nnot to negotiate a commercial treaty, and would sign none that was in\r\nconflict with the Franco-American Treaty--because those were his\r\ninstructions. When, with rumors to the contrary flying over Paris, on\r\nthe completion of the treaty, he had, on the strength of a solemn and\r\nutterly false assurance from Jay, reiterated that there was no conflict.\r\nWhen the document reached Paris, the French were bitterly resentful and\r\nMonroe was discredited and crippled. Even so, he probably prevented a\r\ndeclaration of war by representing that such a course would throw\r\nAmerica into the arms of England--and this was charged against him by\r\nthose Federalist leaders who sought war. Then he was recalled; and at\r\nthe farewell audience an offensive speech by the French official, which\r\nMonroe unpardonably failed to resent, gave his enemies more ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the refusal to receive Pinckney, the crisis came. To the war hawks\r\nit was a golden hour--war and no negotiations. Pickering and Wolcott\r\nfumed over the suggestion of an extraordinary mission. Hamilton, the\r\nsanest and most prescient of them all, realizing the importance of a\r\nunited country in case of war, proposed sending an embassy of three,\r\nincluding one Jeffersonian of distinction. For almost five months a\r\nspirited debate of the leaders continued. In January, Hamilton had\r\nwritten Washington urging an extraordinary mission, including Madison,\r\nto conciliate the French, with Pinckney, who was not distasteful to\r\nthem, and George Cabot, to moderate the Gallicism of the other two, to\r\nsupply commercial information, and to represent the friends of the\r\nAdministration.[1316] Two months later, in a similar recommendation to\r\nMcHenry, he proposed Jefferson instead of Madison, and Jay in the place\r\nof Cabot. Then he would have a day of fasting and prayer for the opening\r\nof Congress, an embargo, an increase in the revenue, the use of convoys,\r\nand qualified letters of marque for merchantmen to arm and defend\r\nthemselves.[1317] The same day he wrote the same suggestion for\r\nPickering.[1318]\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Hamilton began to run foul of the\r\npro-English war craze of Pickering, who questioned the plan because the\r\nDemocrats favored it. All the more reason for it, replied Hamilton.\r\nUnhappily, there was a prevalent feeling that the Administration wanted\r\nwar and this should be counteracted.[1319] To Wolcott, he wrote in the\r\nsame strain the next day.[1320] Even the usually pliant Wolcott was in\r\nrebellious mood and replied with an attack on Madison as a frequenter of\r\nM. Adet’s parties, whom that Minister wished sent, and who would wreck\r\nthe negotiations, and ‘throw the disgrace of failure on the friends of\r\nthe Government.’[1321] Clearly it was time for Hamilton to assume his\r\nimperial manner, and he did, in a sharp rebuke to his protégé against\r\n‘passions that prevent the pliancy to circumstances which is sometimes\r\nindispensable.’ Then ‘what risk can attend sending Madison, if combined,\r\nas I propose, with Pinckney and Cabot,’ he added.[1322] Realizing now\r\nthe importance of bringing up his congressional reserves, he wrote to\r\nWilliam Smith by the same mail.[1323]\r\n\r\nThe insurgency against the plans of the Federalist chief was now in full\r\nblast. Tracy was writing Wolcott--‘No man will be sent on this business\r\nbut a decided Federalist.’[1324] Jeremiah Smith having informed Cabot of\r\nthe dispute, the latter wrote Wolcott that he could see no possibility\r\nof finding new messengers ‘with the expectation that they will not be\r\nkicked.’[1325] The same day--less circumspect outside Administration\r\ncircles--he wrote Jeremiah Smith that a new embassy ‘would be\r\ndisgraceful.’[1326] Ames had been won over by Hamilton, but the day\r\nafter the extra session began, Cabot wrote Wolcott that his mind was\r\n‘still as unsatisfied as at first.’[1327] Four days before the session\r\nopened, Hamilton was bringing pressure to bear on Pickering, declaring\r\nthe mission ‘indispensable to silence the Jacobin criticism and promote\r\nunion among ourselves.’ But by this time he had changed the personnel of\r\nhis mission--Rufus King, rabidly pro-English, should be sent with\r\nPinckney and Jefferson.[1328] Meanwhile, McHenry was receiving letters\r\nfrom Maryland Federalists urging war,[1329] but Hamilton’s masterful\r\nmethods had won the Cabinet, and when Adams took the opinions of the\r\nMinisters he received replies that had been dictated, and, in the case\r\nof McHenry, written in large part, by the Federalist chief.[1330]\r\n\r\nAll the while Adams had been receiving volunteered advice, though it\r\ndoes not appear that Hamilton thought it worth while to communicate with\r\nhim direct. He had received a letter from Knox urging Jefferson because\r\nof the compliment that would be implied in his rank. This touched Adams\r\nwhere he was ticklish. ‘The circumstance of rank is too much,’ he\r\nreplied. ‘What would have been thought in Europe if the King of France\r\nhad sent Monsieur, his eldest brother, as an envoy? What of the King of\r\nEngland if he had sent the Prince of Wales? Mr. Jefferson is in a sense\r\nin the same situation. He is the first prince of the country, and the\r\nheir apparent to the sovereign authority.’[1331] Ah, ‘Bonny Johnny,’\r\nlucky that this letter did not fall into the hands of Bache with its\r\nreferences to the ‘prince’ and the ‘heir apparent’!\r\n\r\nHowever, in a discussion of the mission with Jefferson, the President\r\nhad suggested Madison. The wary Democratic chief received the suggestion\r\nwith caution, for the experience of Monroe offered little inducement to\r\na Democrat to subject his reputation to the mercies of the man-eating\r\nPickering. Certainly the suggestion received no encouragement. The\r\nPresident and his most dangerous opponent had a friendly chat and parted\r\nfriends--not soon to meet in conference again. The sage of Monticello\r\nhad never been more courteous or courtly, the man from Braintree never\r\ncalmer nor more kindly, but the hour had passed for a coalition.\r\nJefferson was out for scalps, not olive branches.[1332]\r\n\r\nThus the time came when Adams had to take the bit in his mouth in the\r\nnaming of the envoys. One day Fisher Ames had a long talk with him in\r\nurging Cabot, as a compliment to the Northern States, and the next day\r\nthe envoys were named--with Cabot out. He was eliminated because Adams\r\nknew that Talleyrand was familiar with Cabot’s bitter hostility to\r\nFrance, and the President refused thus to ‘gratify the passions of a\r\nparty.’[1333] That was ominous enough; but when he disregarded the\r\nalmost unanimous protest of the Hamiltonians and named Elbridge Gerry\r\nalong with Pinckney and Marshall, the gage of battle was thrown down.\r\nFrom that hour, the high-flying Federalists knew that John Adams would\r\nbe no man’s man and no man’s parrot. Thus early, the small cloud on the\r\nhorizon widened and darkened.\r\n\r\nThe proud old patriot of Braintree had been given a shock on the opening\r\nday of the extra session when Senator Tracy spread a lengthy letter\r\nbefore him on the table in the _ex-cathedra_ manner of one disclosing\r\nthe tablets of Moses. The squat little President read it with rising\r\nwrath. It was a letter from Hamilton, setting forth in detail ‘a whole\r\nsystem of instructions for the conduct of the President, the Senate and\r\nthe House of Representatives.’ He read it through and returned it to\r\nTracy. ‘I really thought the man was in a delirium,’ Adams wrote\r\nafterwards.[1334] And the cloud on the horizon grew more ominous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe opening of the session found the New England Federalists in high\r\nglee over the prospects. The correspondence of their leaders discloses\r\ntheir grim determination to have war with France; and if they had\r\nfailed in their efforts to prevent a renewal of negotiations, they could\r\nuse the extra session for the spreading of war propaganda. Upon this\r\ntask they entered with unprecedented arrogance and intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe Message of Adams was dignified and calm, reviewing the situation,\r\nannouncing the plans for a new attempt at negotiations, and urging the\r\nadoption of defensive measures in the meantime. The first fight came in\r\nthe framing of the Reply to the Address in the House--and two young\r\nbrilliant new members forged to the front to assume the aggressive\r\nleadership of the war party. The persuasive, polished eloquence of Ames\r\ncould not be heard, for he was nursing himself in his fine new house at\r\nDedham; nor, on the other side, could the lucid, convincing logic of\r\nMadison appear, for he was in retirement in Virginia. Sedgwick had been\r\nsent to the Senate, Fitzsimons had been defeated, Murray of Maryland was\r\non his way to The Hague as Minister. On the Democratic side, Gallatin,\r\nGiles, and Nicholas of Virginia were to bear the brunt of the battle,\r\nand the two new men were to lead the Federalists with an audacity seldom\r\nequaled and never surpassed. These two young blades, Harrison Gray Otis\r\nof Boston and Robert Goodloe Harper of South Carolina, were in their\r\nthirty-second year. The former was strikingly handsome, tall and well\r\nproportioned, with coal-black hair, eyes blue and sparkling with\r\nvivacity, nose thin and patrician, complexion rosy--his presence in any\r\nassembly would have been felt had he remained silent, and he was seldom\r\nsilent. In dress fastidious, in manners affable, in repartee stinging,\r\nin the telling of a story a master of the art: a devotee to pleasure,\r\ndinners, dances, and women carried for him an irresistible appeal. His\r\neloquence was of a high order. A thorough aristocrat, he prided himself\r\non having no illusions as to liberty and democracy, and he made no\r\nsecret of his contempt for the masses. The rising of the French against\r\nthe ineffable cruelties of the nobility and monarchy merely meant to him\r\nan attack of beasts upon the homes and rights of gentlemen. Speedily he\r\nbecame an idol of his party, and he enjoyed the bitter conflicts of the\r\nHouse as keenly as the dinners where he was the life of the party.\r\n\r\nRobert Goodloe Harper had much in common with Otis. Like him, Harper was\r\na social lion and a dandy in dress. Of medium height, and with an\r\nuncommonly full chest which accentuated his pomposity, he had a handsome\r\nhead and features, creating withal an impression of physical force and\r\nintellectual power. In eloquence he made up in force what he lacked in\r\nornament. He had all of Giles’s bumptiousness without his consistency,\r\nand no member of the House approached him in insolence. Coming upon the\r\nscene when the conditions seemed ripe for bowling over the Democrats\r\nwith abuse and intimidation, he fitted into the picture perfectly. Thus\r\nhe became the outstanding orator against the French. True, four years\r\nbefore, in Charleston, he had paid court to the Jacobins with an\r\nassiduity that should have made him blush in later life--but did not.\r\nAppealing for membership in an extreme Jacobin society, he had worn the\r\nparaphernalia, spouted his harangues on the rights of man, paid his\r\ntribute to the Revolution, become the vice-president of the\r\norganization--and all he lacked to make him a Camille Desmoulins was a\r\ntable on the boulevards and a guillotine.[1335] Now a convert to ‘law\r\nand order,’ he outstripped the most rabid enemies of the French. From\r\n‘dining almost every day’ in 1793 at the table of the French Consul in\r\nCharleston, he passed without embarrassment four years later to the\r\ntable of Liston, the British Minister.[1336] The rabid democrat had\r\nbecome a rabid aristocrat, and the society of the capital took him to\r\nits heart. In social intercourse, he was entertaining, amiable, and\r\npleasing.[1337] Fond of the epicurean feast, expansive in the glow of\r\nwomen’s smiles, he became a social favorite, and his enemies broadly\r\nhinted that he was a master in the gentle art of intrigue.\r\n\r\nBrilliant, charming men, these two young orators of the war party, and\r\nit is easy to imagine the homage of the fashionable ladies when, after\r\ntheir most virulent attacks on the Democrats, they found themselves\r\nsurrounded in Mrs. Bingham’s drawing-room.\r\n\r\nEven before Congress met, the premonitions of the coming Terror were in\r\nthe air. With the impatient Giles, this was intolerable, and he soon\r\nretired to fight elsewhere; but Gallatin determined to ignore insults,\r\ndisregard abuse, and to fight for moderate measures to keep the door\r\nopen for negotiations. He was of the rare few who can keep their heads\r\nin the midst of riots and remain calm in a tempest. For a while he could\r\ncount on Giles for rough blows at the enemy, on Livingston for eloquence\r\nand courage; he would have to rely upon himself for wisdom and the\r\nstrategy of statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Message received, the war party in the House set itself with zest to\r\nthe framing of a bellicose Reply calculated to compromise the chances\r\nfor a peaceful accommodation of differences. Nicholas of Virginia,\r\nrepresenting the Jeffersonians, proposed a substitute, couched in more\r\nconciliatory language, promising a review of the alleged grievances of\r\nthe French--and this let loose the dogs of war. In presenting his\r\namendment, Nicholas deprecated the Reply as framed because extreme,\r\ndenunciatory, and provocative and not calculated to assist the embassy\r\nthe President was sending. In negotiations it would necessarily follow\r\nthat there would be an examination of the charges made against America\r\nby the French.[1338] It irritated Smith of Charleston that the Virginian\r\nshould be ‘so wonderfully afraid of using language to irritate France,’\r\nalbeit he had protested against language that would irritate England\r\nwhen Jay was sailing on his mission.[1339] Otis was weary of references\r\nto England’s offenses against American commerce. ‘The English were\r\nstimulated to annoy our commerce through apprehension that we were\r\nunited against them, and the French by a belief that we are divided in\r\ntheir favor.’[1340]\r\n\r\nLivingston followed with a brilliant five-hour address, pointing out the\r\nflagrant violation of Article XVII of the treaty with France. We had\r\nmade that treaty upon the basis that free bottoms make free goods, and\r\nin the Jay Treaty we had abandoned that ground in the interest of\r\nEngland. Of what was it that the French complained? What but the\r\nadoption of the British Order in Council which we had not resented? Even\r\nso, she was not justified in her course. That she would recede in\r\nnegotiations he had no doubt, provided we used ‘language toward her\r\nsuitable to that liberality which befits a wise and prudent nation.’ He\r\nhad no apology to offer for his devotion to the cause of France. ‘I\r\ncould read by the light of the flames that consumed my paternal mansion,\r\nby the joy that sparkled in every eye,’ he said, ‘how great were the\r\nconsequences of her union with America.’[1341] Giles followed, a little\r\nmore severe on the Federalist discriminations for England against\r\nFrance; and Gallatin closed in a sober, dignified, dispassionate\r\nanalysis of the phrasing of the amendment to show that it was firm\r\nwithout being offensive.[1342]\r\n\r\nThen Harper, with an elaborate speech laboriously wrought in seclusion,\r\nentered the debate. The French were intemperately denounced, the\r\nDemocrats lashed, and Monroe treated with contempt. It was a war speech,\r\nprepared as war propaganda, the first of his war speeches to be\r\npublished and widely circulated throughout the country, and printed and\r\nacclaimed in England. Like Smith and Ames before him, he was to have his\r\ntriumph in Downing Street. The profits of one of his war productions,\r\nwhich had a ‘prodigious sale’ in England, were given to a benevolent\r\nsociety in that country.[1343] The Democrats were infuriated by Harper’s\r\nattack, and the ‘Aurora’ truly said that he had ‘unseasonably unmasked\r\nthe intentions of his party.’[1344] When, about this time, Liston, the\r\nBritish Minister, was seen to tap the orator unceremoniously upon the\r\nshoulder while seated at his desk--for Liston was then a familiar figure\r\nupon the floor--and to whisper to him, Bache saw red. ‘If the French\r\nMinister had acted thus familiarly with Mr. Giles or Mr. Livingston, we\r\nshould have heard something about French influence.’[1345] Pooh! sneered\r\nFenno in the ‘Gazette,’ Liston was merely reminding Harper of a dinner\r\nengagement for that night. ‘Having heard it whispered,’ he added, ‘that\r\nMr. Harper has received an invitation to dinner from another British\r\nAgent, the Consul General, we think ourselves bound to mention\r\nit.’[1346] Nothing could better illustrate the confident arrogance of\r\nthe Federalist leaders at this time.\r\n\r\n‘I am not for war,’ said Smith of Charleston. ‘I do not believe that the\r\ngentleman wishes for peace,’ retorted Gallatin, who had written four\r\ndays before that ‘Wolcott, Pickering, William Smith, Fisher Ames, and\r\nperhaps a few more are disposed to go to war’ and ‘to carry their party\r\nany length they please.’[1347] Thus the debate continued until Jonathan\r\nDayton, the Speaker, proposed a substitute amendment that received the\r\nsupport of the Democrats. Seizing upon a passage in Adams’s Message,\r\nthis commended the President’s decision to seek further negotiations and\r\ncherished ‘the hope that a mutual spirit of conciliation and a\r\ndisposition on the part of the United States to place France on grounds\r\nas favorable as other countries in their relations and connection with\r\nus, will produce an accommodation compatible with the engagements,\r\nrights, duties, and honor of the United States.’[1348] With the\r\nDemocrats joining the more moderate Federalists under Dayton, the\r\ncontest was speedily ended to the disgust of the war party. The\r\nbatteries of scurrility were turned upon the Speaker. ‘A double-faced\r\nweather-cock,’ screamed ‘Porcupine’ the Englishman. ‘His duplicity has\r\nbeen too bare-faced for decency. He is, indeed, but a shallow,\r\nsuperficial fellow--a bawler to the galleries, and unfit to play the\r\ncunning part he has undertaken.’[1349]\r\n\r\nThen, after the heroics, the comedy. Matthew Lyon, a Vermont Democrat\r\nand a new member, shocked the formalists with a characterization of the\r\npractice of marching in stately procession to the President to present\r\nthe Reply as ‘a boyish piece of business.’ The time had come to end the\r\nsilliness. ‘Blood will tell,’ sneered a colleague, referring to Lyon’s\r\nhumble origin. ‘I cannot say,’ replied Lyon, ‘that I am descended from\r\nthe bastards of Oliver Cromwell, or his courtiers, or from the Puritans\r\nwho punish their horses for breaking the Sabbath, or from those who\r\npersecuted the Quakers and burned the witches.’[1350] Some chortled,\r\nothers snorted with rage. Vulgar Irish immigrant! But their wounded\r\nculture was soon soothed by a salvo from ‘Porcupine.’ How society must\r\nhave screamed its delight in reading that Lyon as a child ‘had been\r\ncaught in a bog, and when a whelp transported to America’; how he had\r\nbecome so ‘domesticated’ that Governor Crittenden’s daughter (his wife)\r\n‘would stroke him and play with him as a monkey’; how ‘his gestures bear\r\na remarkable affinity to the bear’ because of ‘his having been in the\r\nhabit of associating with that species of wild beast in the\r\nmountains.’[1351] The majority of the House, lacking Lyon’s sense of\r\nhumor, continued for a while their pompous strut through Market Street\r\nto read solemnly the meaningless Reply that had consumed weeks of futile\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\nThen Congress proceeded to measures of defense, prohibiting the\r\nexportation of arms and ammunition, providing for the strengthening of\r\nthe coast fortifications, creating a naval armament, authorizing a\r\ndetachment of militia, and adjourned. But the atmosphere had been one of\r\nintense party bitterness which had ostracized the Democrats, from\r\nJefferson down, from the ‘society’ of the ‘best people.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMounted, booted, and spurred, and swinging their sabers, the Federalists\r\nstarted out to ride roughshod over their opponents. It was their\r\nstrategy to attach a stigma to Democrats, and treat them as political\r\noutlaws and social outcasts. No one was to be spared--Jefferson least of\r\nall. A year before he had written the confidential letter to his friend\r\nPhilip Mazzei, stating his oft-repeated views on the anti-republican\r\ntrend in Federalist circles, and saying that men who had been ‘Samsons\r\nin the field and Solomons in the council ... had had their heads shorn\r\nby the harlot England.’[1352] Sent to an Italian paper, it was\r\ntranslated from Italian into French for a Parisian journal, as we have\r\nseen, and thence translated again into English for political purposes in\r\nAmerica. The translators had unintentionally taken liberties with the\r\ntext and in the final translation it was quite different from the\r\noriginal. At last, it seemed, the cautious Jefferson had delivered\r\nhimself into the hands of his enemies, for had he not attacked\r\nWashington? At Alexandria, en route to Philadelphia, Jefferson first\r\nlearned of the renewed attack in Fenno’s paper. Reaching the capital, he\r\nfound the vials of wrath let loose upon his head. A politician of less\r\nself-possession or finesse would have offered some explanation or\r\ndefense. None of the courtesies of warfare were to be shown him--he was\r\nto be mobbed, his character assailed, his reputation blackened, his\r\npersonal honor besmirched, and he was to be rejected socially as unfit\r\nto associate with the Harpers, Sedgwicks, and Wolcotts. An open letter\r\ngreeted him in Fenno’s paper on his arrival. ‘For the honor of the\r\nAmerican name,’ it read, ‘I would wish the letter to be a forgery,\r\nalthough I must confess that your silence ... leaves but little\r\nprobability of its not having proceeded from you.’[1353] Jefferson\r\nignored it. ‘You are the author of the abominable letter to Mazzei,’ ran\r\na second open letter. ‘Your silence is complete evidence of your\r\nguilt.’[1354] ‘Slanderer of Washington!’ ‘Assassin!’ ‘Liar!’--and\r\nJefferson was silent.\r\n\r\nKnowing the curative powers of time and patience, it was not until in\r\nAugust that he consulted Madison and Monroe as to his course. ‘Reply,’\r\nurged the impulsive Monroe, ‘honest men will be encouraged by your\r\nowning and justifying the letter.’ Madison advised against it as more\r\napt to give a ‘gratification and triumph’ to his foes.[1355] ‘Character\r\nassassin!’ ‘Libeler of Washington!’ ‘Atheist!’ ‘Anarchist!’\r\n‘Liar!’--these characterizations buzzed through the streets and in the\r\ndrawing-rooms--and Jefferson was silent.\r\n\r\nThen an attack from a new angle. In his ‘Notes on Virginia,’ published\r\nyears before, in paying tribute to the red men and the eloquence of\r\nLogan, an Indian chief, he had referred to a Colonel Cresap as ‘a man\r\ninfamous for the many murders he had committed on these much injured\r\npeople.’ When the mass attack on Jefferson was at its height, a long\r\nopen letter to him appeared in ‘Porcupine’s Gazette’ from the brilliant,\r\nerratic, and usually intoxicated Luther Martin, known as ‘the Federalist\r\nbull-dog,’ demanding Jefferson’s authority in the name of ‘two amiable\r\ndaughters who are directly descended from that man whose character your\r\npen ... had endeavored to stigmatize with indelible infamy.’ This had\r\nbeen preceded by no personal note and was manifestly a part of the\r\npolitical plot to wreck him--and he was silent.[1356] Time and again\r\nMartin returned to the attack in long open letters, to be ignored\r\nutterly as though he were as inconsequential as a ragpicker instead of\r\nbeing the leader of the Maryland Bar.[1357] ‘The mean and cowardly\r\nconduct of Mr. Jefferson,’ growled ‘Porcupine.’[1358]\r\n\r\nAn open season now for shooting at the Democratic leader, all the\r\nsnipers were busy with their guns. At Harvard College, on Washington’s\r\nBirthday, there was a toast to Jefferson: ‘May he exercise his elegant\r\nliterary talents for the benefit of the world in some retreat, secure\r\nfrom the troubles and danger of political life’--and the Federalist\r\npapers gloated over it.[1359] Bache was seen entering Jefferson’s rooms,\r\nand a Gallic conspiracy loomed before the affrighted vision of Fenno.\r\n‘The brat may gasp,’ he promised, ‘but it will surely die in the infamy\r\nof its parents.’[1360] Jefferson a man of the people? snorted\r\n‘Porcupine.’ ‘So is the swindling bankrupt Charles Fox who is\r\ncontinually vilifying his own government and stands ready to sell his\r\ncountry to France.’[1361] Nothing angered ‘Porcupine’ more than\r\nJefferson’s suggestion in his ‘Notes on Virginia’ that British freedom\r\nhad crossed the Atlantic. Freedom would live in England, he growled,\r\nwhen Jefferson’s ‘head will be rotting cheek by jowl with that of some\r\ntoil-killed negro slave,’ and when nothing would be remembered of\r\nJefferson ‘save thy cruel, unprovoked, and viperous slander of the\r\nfamily of Cresap.’[1362] And Jefferson was silent.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was a city of but seventy-five thousand people. The papers\r\nwere generally read, or their contents were at any rate the talk of the\r\ntown. They formed the topic for ladies at their teas. Their husbands\r\nwere sulphurous in their attacks at the breakfast table. And Jefferson\r\nbecame, in the fashionable circles, a moral monster unfit to drink\r\nwhiskey with a _roué_ of the morally bankrupt French nobility at the\r\ntable of the Binghams. He was ostracized. It was at this time that he\r\nwrote Edward Rutledge that ‘men who have been intimate all their lives\r\ncross the street to avoid meeting, and turn their heads another way lest\r\nthey be obliged to touch their hats.’[1363] To his daughter Martha, he\r\nwrote of his disgust with the ‘jealousies, the hatreds and the\r\nmalignant passions,’[1364] and of the ‘politics and party hatreds [that]\r\nseem like salamanders to consider fire as their element.’[1365]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions he dropped out of the social life of the capital.\r\nIn the evenings he consulted with his political associates; during the\r\nday he presented a calm, unruffled complacency to his enemies in the\r\nSenate over whom he presided with scrupulous impartiality. Driven from\r\nsociety, he found consolation in the little rooms of the Philosophical\r\nSociety, among the relics of his friends Rittenhouse and Franklin.\r\n\r\nWith such abuse visited on Jefferson, it is easy to imagine the fate of\r\nhis less important friends. Sam Adams was the laughing-stock of the silk\r\nstockings. Franklin was considered as base as Jefferson. ‘Some person\r\nleft at my house this morning a copy of Old Franklin’s works, or rather\r\nplagiarisms,’ wrote ‘Porcupine.’ ‘I look upon everything which this\r\nunclean old fellow had a hand in to be contaminated and\r\ncontaminating,’[1366] and the time was to come when a Federalist mob\r\nraging through the streets of Philadelphia would throw rocks through\r\nBache’s windows and besmear Franklin’s statue with mud. Tom Paine,\r\nalways a fair mark, was written down in print as a libertine.\r\n‘Porcupine’s Gazette,’ which was the favorite journal in the cultured\r\nhomes of the pure at heart, had a story that Paine had been ‘caught on\r\nhis knees at a lady’s feet by her husband,’ and had explained that he\r\nwas ‘only measuring your lady for stays,’ at which the delighted husband\r\n‘kissed and thanked him for his politeness.’[1367] Because John\r\nSwanwick, a popular young Philadelphia merchant, had cast his lot with\r\nthe Democrats, blocked the plans at the meeting of the merchants on the\r\nJay Treaty, and defeated Fitzsimons for Congress, he was venomously\r\nassailed. When he toasted ‘The Rights of Women’ at a Democratic banquet,\r\n‘Porcupine’ sneered that he did well ‘to turn out a volunteer,’ for ‘no\r\nlady will ever give a bounty for his services.’[1368] That he was a\r\nconscienceless rascal may be inferred from ‘Porcupine’s’ suggestion that\r\nhis ‘consummate wisdom and patriotism’ had been shown, when, in the\r\nlegislature, he had ‘sought to procure a law preventing imprisonment\r\nfor debt.’[1369] Fatally ill at the time, ‘Porcupine’ followed him with\r\nindecent sneers to his grave.[1370]\r\n\r\nNor were even the Democratic women spared, and the Federalists’ favorite\r\njournal sneered repeatedly at the wife of Justice M’Kean. ‘Why is Mrs.\r\nM’Kean like a taylor? Because she trims her good man’s jacket.’[1371] ‘I\r\nhave no objections to their toasting Judge M’Kean’--at a banquet--‘but\r\nthe unmannerly brutes might have added his lady.’[1372] Even the Judge’s\r\nfamously beautiful daughter was not spared, and during her courtship by\r\nthe Spanish Minister, Don Carlos de Yrujo, the fashionable circles were\r\nsnickering behind their fans over ‘Porcupine’s’ comment that ‘what were\r\nhis motives in commencing the suit we shall leave our readers to\r\ndivine.’[1373] Giles was ‘Farmer Giles,’ who descended ‘from the lowest\r\ngrade of gentleman’--‘a gambler at heart’--devotee of the race-track,\r\nand ‘the infamous faro table.’[1374] Monroe was infamous, and even\r\ngentle, cultured old Dr. Logan, ’neath whose magnificent trees at\r\n‘Stenton’ Mrs. Washington had passed delightful afternoons, became a\r\ncross between a clown and a rascal. No Democrat was spared.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, overwhelmed, were comparatively tame, but the publication\r\nof Hamilton’s pamphlet on his relations with Mrs. Reynolds, necessitated\r\nas he foolishly thought by the book of the notorious Callender, made him\r\nan easy mark for the Democratic scandal-mongers. In July he had appeared\r\nin Philadelphia to secure affidavits from Monroe and Muhlenberg--‘an\r\nattestation,’ as Bache phrased it, ‘of his having cuckolded James\r\nReynolds.’ It was understood that ‘his man Oliver [Wolcott] had made out\r\nan affidavit as long as your arm,’ but that others were desired ‘to\r\npatch up the threads and fragments of his character.’ Soon, said Bache,\r\n‘our ex-Secretary expects to be brought to bed of his pamphlet\r\ncontaining love-sick epistles.’[1375] When it was printed three months\r\nlater, Bache published a letter from New York to the effect that it had\r\nappeared in the morning ‘and at six o’clock in the evening the town\r\nrings with it.’ But ‘the women cry out against it as if its publication\r\nwas high treason against the rights of women.’[1376]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for the ostracism of Democrats, however, to blur the\r\nsocial brilliancy of the season. Pinckney found his evenings crowded\r\n‘with plays, public and private,’ and his dinner invitations\r\n‘abundant.’[1377] Subscription dances, brilliant dinners every night,\r\nelaborate entertainments, a giddy whirl. The diplomats were particularly\r\nlavish, none so much so as Liston, the British Minister, at whose table\r\nOtis, Harper, Sedgwick, Wolcott were frequent guests, and he was on\r\nterms of such familiarity with the President that they sometimes\r\nstrolled together in the streets. But everywhere in the fashionable\r\nhouses the Jeffersonians were excluded, if not by lack of invitation, by\r\nthe offensive coldness of their reception. The play-houses were packed,\r\nalbeit the entertainment was sometimes so vulgar and obscene that\r\nfathers indignantly left with their daughters.[1378] Everywhere politics\r\nwas on a rampage, and even at the dinner table of President Adams the\r\npassions seethed. ‘By God, I would rather see this world annihilated,’\r\nshouted Blair McClanachan, ‘than see this country united with Great\r\nBritain.’[1379] ‘I dine next Tuesday at Court,’ wrote Gallatin to his\r\nwife, ‘Courtland dining there the other day heard Her Majesty, as she\r\nwas asking the names of different members of Congress of Hindman, being\r\ntold of some of the aristocratic party, say, “Ah, that is one of OUR\r\npeople.” So that she is Mrs. President, not of the United States, but of\r\na faction.’[1380]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThis rabid spirit was not a little inspired by the press, which, in\r\nturn, was encouraged by the politicians. A new Knight of Scurrility had\r\nentered the lists, encouraged by Hamilton, armed with a pen that flowed\r\npoison. He had previously distinguished himself by his brilliant and\r\nabusive pamphlets attacking Priestley, the Democratic Societies, and the\r\nIrish, and by his exhibition in his shop window of pictures of George\r\nIII and Lord North, with Franklin and Sam Adams coupled with fools or\r\nknaves. His unlimited capacity for abuse, his insane fury against the\r\nFrench Revolution, his unfathomable contempt for democracy, his devotion\r\nto England, fitted in with the spirit of society, and William Cobbett\r\nlaunched his ‘Porcupine’s Gazette’ under the most distinguished\r\npatronage. In his first issue, in an open letter to Bache, he had\r\ndescribed the ‘Aurora’ as a ‘vehicle of lies and sedition.’ This was his\r\nkeynote. Soon the Federalists were reading ‘Porcupine’ as a Bible, and\r\nthe editors were making journalism a matter of blackguardism, of black\r\neyes and bloody noses. In blood and breeding, Cobbett was inferior to\r\nFreneau, Bache, or Duane, but he was a more consummate master of satire\r\nthan any of them. He could string chaste words into a scorpion lash that\r\nSwift would have envied, or stoop to an obscenity and vulgarity that\r\nwould have delighted Kit Marlowe in his cups. None but a genius could\r\nhave risen from his original low estate, with so little education. But a\r\nlittle while before a corporal in the British army, and still a citizen\r\nof England, his English biographer makes the point that the happiest\r\ndays of his life were those when he edited the Federalists’ favorite\r\njournal because ‘he was fighting for his country.’[1381] Nothing pleased\r\nhim more than to lash and lambaste the old heroes of the American\r\nRevolution, Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, and Sam Adams, and he could not\r\nonly do it with impunity, but to the applause of society. Fenno sought\r\nto keep pace, in his weak way, and Bache tried to match him in abuse.\r\nThe fur flew. There were physical assaults and rumors of assaults. The\r\ntime was approaching when Bache would have to barricade himself with a\r\nfew armed friends in his office to protect his life and property from\r\nthe destruction of a Federalist mob; when he would be set upon by\r\nruffians and beaten, and when he would exchange blows with Fenno in the\r\nstreet. ‘The white-livered, black-hearted thing Bache, that public pest\r\nand bane of decency,’ wrote ‘Porcupine,’ and the ladies of Mrs.\r\nBingham’s circle agreed that Mr. Cobbett was tremendously clever.[1382]\r\n\r\nIt was a feverish summer, fall, and winter. Public dinners were the\r\nfashion, bristling with fighting toasts. Through these the Jeffersonians\r\nsought to keep up the courage of their party. Always toasts to the\r\nFrench Republic, and always toasts to the Irish patriots--‘May the\r\nIrish harp be speedily torn from the British willow and made to vibrate\r\nto a revolutionary tune.’ References to Jay’s Treaty were followed by\r\nthe playing of ‘The Dead March.’ Franklin, Jefferson, Monroe--these were\r\ninvariably honored.[1383] The Federalists penetrated the Jeffersonian\r\nstronghold of Philadelphia with a banquet at the Cameron Tavern,\r\nSouthwark, with warlike toasts, and with Harper as the hero,[1384] and a\r\nfew days later the ‘young men’ of this district met to pass ringing\r\nresolutions endorsing the ‘wisdom and integrity’ of the Administration.\r\nOne courageous soul moved to strike out the word ‘wisdom,’ and the crowd\r\nstruck him out instead; whereupon a few gathered about and cheered for\r\nJefferson.[1385]\r\n\r\nBut the most notable banquet was in honor of Monroe in Philadelphia.\r\nReaching the city, the former Minister to France left the boat with Mrs.\r\nMonroe, to be summarily ordered back by the health officers until he had\r\n‘undergone the usual formalities of examination.’ Short shrift for\r\nDemocrats was the order of the day, and the returning Minister of his\r\nGovernment to another nation returned with his wife to remain on board\r\nuntil ‘examined.’ Such was the morbid madness of the Federalists of this\r\nperiod that it was considered a triumph for the Administration to hold\r\nthe former Minister and his wife with the immigrants. ‘Porcupine’ roared\r\nwith glee in his best barrack-room manner.[1386] When finally released,\r\nMonroe went into conference immediately with Jefferson, Gallatin, and\r\nBurr, and for two hours the leaders listened to a detailed story of his\r\nmission. Gallatin, who had refrained up to this time from expressing an\r\nopinion on Monroe’s conduct, was convinced, from his conversation,\r\n‘manner, and everything,’ that he was ‘possessed of integrity superior\r\nto all attacks of malignity,’ and had conducted himself ‘with\r\nirreproachable honor and the most dignified sense of duty.’ When the\r\nconference was over, Gallatin, at least, felt that the ‘Administration\r\nhave acted with a degree of meanness only exceeded by their\r\nfolly.’[1387]\r\n\r\nThis became the view of the Jeffersonians generally. A dinner was given\r\nat O’Eller’s Hotel, with General Horatio Gates in the chair. There was\r\nJefferson, and there, too, were Burr, Livingston, Gallatin, Tazewell,\r\nJudge M’Kean, the Governor, and fifty members of Congress. With\r\nenthusiasm they drank to the freedom of Ireland, and on the invitation\r\nof Gates they lifted their glasses with cheers to ‘Charles James Fox and\r\nthe Patriots of England’--a frequently recurring Jeffersonian toast of\r\nthe times. Livingston proposed--‘Monroe, the virtuous citizen, who, to\r\nkeep the peace of the country, refuses to do justice to himself.’ Monroe\r\nresponded in a brief speech, unexceptionable in every way, but Gallatin\r\npredicted, in a letter to his wife, that ‘Porcupine & Co. will roundly\r\nabuse us.’[1388] And Gallatin was right, for that was ‘Porcupine’s’\r\nbusiness. ‘At some tavern in the city,’ ran the ‘Porcupine’ account, ‘a\r\nmost ludicrous farce called “The Welcome of Citizen Monroe” was\r\nperformed. The principal characters were the Virginia Philosopher, Mrs.\r\nM’Kean’s husband, and Monsieur Citizen Tazewell of the ancient dominion\r\ncommonly called the Land of Debts.’[1389] Livingston was wrong, however,\r\nin his notion that Monroe would remain silent. Urged on by the\r\nJeffersonians, he prepared a defense which was given a nation-wide\r\ncirculation through the exertions of his fellow partisans.[1390]\r\nJefferson was satisfied, the Federalists enraged. ‘A wicked\r\nmisrepresentation of the facts,’ though ‘many applaud it,’ wrote\r\nWolcott.[1391]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the envoys were lost in the mists of the sea, and nothing had\r\nreached the public regarding their reception. In November, the\r\natmosphere charged with the electricity of war, Adams returned to the\r\ncapital from his seat at Braintree, to be escorted with military pomp\r\ninto the city. The war propagandists were good psychologists sometimes.\r\nWhen Governor Mifflin, Democrat, ordered out the militia to parade in\r\nthe President’s honor, ‘Porcupine’ graciously declared it ‘the first\r\ndecent act he had ever been guilty of.’[1392] On the night of his\r\narrival there was a dinner at O’Eller’s in honor of ‘His Serene Highness\r\nof Braintree,’ as Bache put it, and so noisy was the demonstration that\r\n‘some ignorant people imagined a boxing match was on the carpet.’[1393]\r\nThis was the spirit of the hour when Congress met in November--the\r\nbitterness among the members fully as intense as among the loungers in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not to be without its touch of comedy. Before the crisis\r\ncame, two incidents had set the country roaring. Matthew Lyon, the\r\nVermont Democrat, was a constant provocation to the Federalists.\r\nHot-tempered, ardent, uncouth in his manners, but thoroughly honest at\r\nheart, he had outraged the clubby spirit of the Federalists. During the\r\nRevolution he had been shamefully cashiered for an act deserving of a\r\nmedal, but almost immediately he had been vindicated. The vindication\r\nwas thoroughly understood in Philadelphia, but it suited the purpose of\r\nhis political foes to ignore the facts for the benefit of the slander.\r\n\r\nThe House was sitting, but in a state of confusion--every one including\r\nthe Speaker talking--Lyon holding forth in conversation on the ease with\r\nwhich Connecticut could be converted to Democracy through a Democratic\r\npaper in that State. Roger Griswold, a Federalist leader, made a\r\nslurring reference to Lyon’s ‘wooden sword.’ The latter, hearing it,\r\npreferred to ignore the insult. Whereupon Griswold, following him and\r\nplucking at his coat, repeated the slander. At this Lyon made an\r\nunpardonable blunder--instead of slapping Griswold’s face, he spat in\r\nit. Instantly the Federalists were in ferment. The ‘little beast’ was\r\nunfit to associate with gentlemen, anyway, and should be expelled. There\r\nwas an investigation, with denunciatory speeches as indecent as the act\r\ndenounced. The purpose was clear--to get rid of Lyon’s vote. The\r\nJeffersonians thereupon rallied to his support. Neither condoning the\r\nact nor asking that it go unpunished, Gallatin opposed the expulsion\r\nresolution on the ground that Congress was not a fashionable club and\r\nhad no right to deprive a district of its representation on the basis of\r\nmanners. A two-thirds vote was necessary to expel, and this was lacking.\r\nIt was a party vote.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Lyon was seated at his desk buried in papers,\r\noblivious to his surroundings, and Griswold, armed with a hickory stick,\r\napproached from the rear and began striking him on the head. Several\r\nblows were struck before the victim of the assault\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRISWOLD-LYON FIGHT IN THE HOUSE]\r\n\r\ncould extricate himself from his desk. Then, grasping some coal tongs,\r\nhe advanced on Griswold, who, finding his enemy also armed, gallantly\r\nretreated, striking wildly. They clinched, rolled on the floor, and\r\ncolleagues intervened. Here was another insult to the dignity of the\r\nHouse, but the Federalists were delighted with it. Since nothing could\r\nbe done to Lyon without doing as much to Griswold, the matter was\r\ndropped. The scribes fell upon the morsel with a zest, the first\r\npolitical caricature in American history resulted, the public shrugged\r\nits shoulders and laughed, Jefferson thought the whole affair ‘dirty\r\nbusiness,’[1394] but Gallatin, quite as much of a gentleman as Otis,\r\nthought that ‘nobody can blame Lyon for resenting the insult,’ since\r\nthere was ‘a notable lack of delicacy in the conversation of most\r\nConnecticut gentlemen.’[1395] Fenno called Lyon a ‘filthy beast.’\r\n‘Porcupine,’ who had rather urged that some one spit in the face of\r\nBache, gloated over Griswold’s assault,[1396] dubbed those who voted\r\nagainst expulsion ‘Knights of the Wooden Sword,’[1397] and virtuously\r\nresolved ‘to make the whole business as notorious as the courage of\r\nAlexander or the cruelty of Nero.’[1398] Speaker Dayton, whom he had\r\nrecently denounced as a ‘double-faced weather-cock,’ having voted for\r\nexpulsion, became an ornament over whom ‘New Jersey has indeed new\r\nreason to boast.’[1399] The real significance of the incident was that\r\nthe war party had fared forth, chesty and cocky, to intimidate the\r\nJeffersonians and had met a check--but they were to have another chance\r\nat Lyon.[1400]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHYSTERICS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Congress in the early winter of 1797 found the war party\r\nin fine fettle and the Jeffersonians fighting desperately for peace.\r\nEarly in the session, Adams called for the advice of his Cabinet on the\r\npolicy to be pursued in the event of the failure of the envoys. The\r\nthree Hamiltonian members had conferred and McHenry was instructed to\r\nwrite Hamilton for instructions. ‘I am sure I cannot do justice to the\r\nsubject as you can,’ wrote the Secretary of War to the President’s enemy\r\nin New York. Agreeing, no doubt, with the sentiment, the power behind\r\nthe Cabinet speedily complied, and the response to the President of his\r\nadvisers was the recommendations of Hamilton copied into the handwriting\r\nof McHenry.[1401] These did not contemplate a declaration of war, but a\r\nresort to warlike measures. Merchant vessels should be armed, twenty\r\nsloops of the line built, an immediate army of sixteen thousand men\r\nrecruited with provision for twenty thousand more, the French treaty\r\nabrogated, a loan authorized, and the tax system put upon a war basis.\r\nAn alliance with England? Not improper, perhaps, but inexpedient; though\r\nRufus King in London should make overtures to the British for a loan,\r\nthe aid of convoys, perhaps the transfer of ten ships of the line, and,\r\nin the event of a definite rupture with France, he should be authorized\r\nto work out a plan of coöperation with England.[1402]\r\n\r\nAll this while the debates in Congress were increasing in bitterness.\r\nMonroe was accused and defended, democrats denounced and damned,\r\naristocrats and monocrats assailed. Orators were mobilized and paraded\r\nin war-paint spluttering their most vituperative phrases, and the most\r\ninsignificant pack-horse of the war party attacked Jefferson’s letter to\r\nMazzei as ‘a disgraceful performance.’[1403] The chest of the flamboyant\r\nHarper was never so protuberant as in those days when he strutted\r\nthrough the Dictionary hurling the most offensive words in the language\r\nat the Jeffersonians, rattling his sword, waving his pistol, and\r\noffering to meet gentlemen outside the House. All revolutions he thought\r\nthe work of fools and knaves, philosophers, Jacobins, and\r\n_sans-culottes_. The Jeffersonians were conspiring to prostrate popular\r\nliberty and establish tyranny by curtailing the power of the Executive\r\nand increasing the power of the House. It was all very simple. The\r\nPresident crushed, the Senate next destroyed, three or four audacious\r\ndemagogues would dominate the House until the strongest cut the throats\r\nof the others and seized the scepter. The Federalists were\r\ndelighted--what a wonderful man was Harper![1404] Day by day the\r\nviolence increased. Harper snapped at Giles, who snapped back, and when\r\nOtis made a nasty attack on the Virginian and the latter dared him to\r\nrepeat it ‘out of doors,’ there were loud cries of ‘order.’ Only\r\nGallatin remained cool, in possession of his senses. He contented\r\nhimself with the assertion that only on information that had not been\r\ngiven could war measures be excused.[1405]\r\n\r\nThe superheat of the House cooled the passions of the people and\r\nremonstrances against the arming of merchant ships poured in. Even from\r\nNew England they came, maddening to Cabot and Ames, reassuring to\r\nJefferson, who made the most of them in his correspondence.[1406] When\r\nthe town meeting at Cambridge joined the remonstrators, the Boston\r\n‘Centinel’ fumed over ‘the indecent abuse of the merchants,’ and the\r\n‘forestalling knavery’ of the town.[1407] Then, to revive the failing\r\nspirits of the war party, Adams came to the rescue with a Message\r\nannouncing the failure of the envoys and recommending warlike measures.\r\nHow the little patriot would have winced had he known that in adopting\r\nthe recommendations of McHenry he was accepting the dictations of\r\nAlexander Hamilton! Jefferson wrote Madison that it was ‘an insane\r\nmessage,’ and the Jeffersonians, no longer doubting that war was the\r\npurpose, arranged to force a show-down.[1408] Thus appeared the Sprigg\r\nResolutions providing for purely defensive measures for the coast and\r\nthe interior, and declaring that ‘under existing conditions it is not\r\nexpedient for the United States to resort to war against the French\r\nRepublic.’[1409]\r\n\r\nMomentarily taken unaware, the Federalists were stunned. Harper\r\nblundered into the admission that he could see no objections, but Otis,\r\nwith keener insight, proposed to substitute the word ‘declare’ for\r\n‘resort to’ war--and the cat was out of the bag. The Jeffersonians\r\nfeared, not so much a declaration of war as warlike measures that would\r\nforce a state of war, and to forestall that was the purpose of the\r\nResolutions. Thus the debate proceeded, more bitter and personal, with\r\nGiles and Harper resembling the wenches of the fishmarket without their\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Federalist leaders were familiar with the X Y Z papers of\r\nwhich the Democrats were kept in ignorance. Hamilton, private citizen of\r\nNew York, knew their contents; Jefferson, Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, did not. This was the trump card of the war party, and no one\r\nsaw it so quickly as Hamilton, who immediately began to work secretly,\r\nthrough his agents in the Cabinet, for their publication. ‘Nothing\r\ncertainly can be more proper,’ he wrote Pickering. ‘Confidence will\r\notherwise be wanting.’[1410] In utter ignorance of their contents, the\r\nJeffersonians began to demand their production. Only a few days before,\r\nthe Jeffersonian organ in Boston was charging that Adams withheld the\r\npapers because they ‘contain an account of some resentful expressions of\r\nthe French respecting our Cabinet, and Mr. Adams does not expect any\r\ncredit by publishing them.’[1411] Thus, when the motion was made that\r\nthe papers be produced, Gallatin, Giles, Livingston, and Nicholas\r\nsupported it, and the next day they were sent with the request that they\r\nbe considered in confidence until the effect of their publication could\r\nbe discussed.\r\n\r\nThe galleries were cleared--the doors locked and guarded--and for three\r\ndays and into the fourth the secret discussion continued. Then the doors\r\nwere opened and the crowd in the galleries heard a brief discussion of\r\nthe number of copies to be printed for circulation. ‘One thousand, two\r\nhundred,’ said Bayard of Delaware. ‘Three thousand,’ urged Harper.\r\n‘Seven thousand,’ sneered the hot-headed Matthew Lyon, ‘for the papers\r\nare so trifling and unimportant that no printer would risk the printing\r\nof them in a pamphlet.’ Otis incredulously inquired if he had rightly\r\nunderstood the Vermont fire-eater. Lyon unblushingly repeated his\r\nstrange assertion. The suggestion of Bayard was adopted, and, when the\r\nmembers filed out of the little room in which they deliberated that day,\r\nHarper and the war hawks could already hear the thunder of the guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThus did the shadows close in on the Jeffersonians. The blow was\r\nstaggering. On the appearance of the damaging documents, most of the\r\nDemocratic papers were silent, while printing them in full. One made a\r\nbrave show of satisfaction by criticizing Adams for withholding them so\r\nlong, and suggesting that perhaps ‘the most important papers’ had been\r\nwithheld.[1412] Even the buoyancy of Jefferson suffered a momentary\r\ncollapse. Writing Madison the day the papers were read, he did not have\r\nthe heart to indicate the nature of their contents.[1413] The next day\r\nhe had recovered sufficiently to write that his first impressions were\r\n‘very disagreeable and confused,’ and that this would be the first\r\nimpression of the public. A more mature consideration, he thought, would\r\ndisclose no new ground for war, but war psychology and fear of false\r\nimputations might drive the people to the war hawks.[1414] Madison,\r\nequally astonished, thought Talleyrand’s conduct ‘incredible,’ not\r\nbecause of its ‘depravity, which, however heinous, is not without\r\nexample,’ but because of its ‘unparalleled stupidity.’[1415] Monroe, who\r\nhad spent the night with Madison in Virginia, thought the incident\r\n‘evidently a swindling experiment,’ which was clear enough on its\r\nface.[1416] The public, in the meantime, was reading one of the most\r\ngrotesque stories of political infamy and personal cupidity on record.\r\nThe envoys had been treated with contempt, refused an audience, insulted\r\nby unofficial blackmailers sent by the unscrupulous Talleyrand to demand\r\na loan for France and, more particularly, a bribe for himself. The\r\nenvoys had conducted themselves with becoming dignity and spirit.\r\n‘Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,’ was a clarion call\r\nto battle. The pride of the people was touched, and overnight the\r\npolitical complexion of the country had been changed. A wave of\r\nhysterical patriotism swept over the Nation, and the war hawks set to\r\nwork to turn it into frenzy. It was now or never.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFor once John Adams was on top of the world. He who had so longed for\r\npopularity had found it. Everywhere, in cities, on Southern plantations,\r\nunder the primeval forests of the frontiers, men were wildly waving\r\nflags and saluting the President. Addresses pledging life and fortune\r\npoured in to be prominently printed in the papers, and nowhere more than\r\nin the Jeffersonian States.[1417] Most were the spontaneous expressions\r\nof an excited people, some were unquestionably engineered by the\r\npoliticians.[1418] But on the surface the country was aflame. Down the\r\nPhiladelphia streets one day swung twelve hundred young men, keeping\r\nstep to martial music, the streets lined with the cheering populace,\r\nand, as ‘Porcupine’ observed, with ‘every female in the city whose face\r\nis worth looking at’ gladdening ‘the way with her smiles.’[1419] At\r\nAdams’s house the little man, who had always wanted to be a warrior,\r\nappeared on the steps to greet them, wearing a cockade, in full military\r\nregalia, his sword dangling at his side. Intoxicated by the adulation,\r\nhe plunged impetuously into a denunciation of France and its\r\nRevolution.[1420] Madison thought his language ‘the most abominable and\r\ndegrading that could fall from the lips of a first magistrate of an\r\nindependent people, and particularly from a Revolutionary\r\npatriot.’[1421] Aroused by the philippic of the President, the young men\r\nspent the day marching the streets, and in the evening wined and dined\r\nuntil ten o’clock, when they sallied forth to exercise their patriotism\r\nin deeds of violence. The Terror had begun. Reeling and shouting, they\r\nbore down upon the home of Bache. With only women and children in the\r\nhouse, they fell in right gallant fashion on the doors and windows and\r\nwere making headway when the neighbors interfered and sent the drunken\r\nyoungsters upon their way.[1422] But with the war hawks, the attack on\r\nthe home of Bache was not least among the virtues of the mob, and the\r\nFederalist press was unstinted in its praise.\r\n\r\nThen, on May 9th, came the day of fasting and prayer, set by Adams in\r\nhappy ignorance that when he yielded to the importunities of Pickering\r\nfor a proclamation, he was again acting under the direction of the hated\r\nHamilton.[1423] The President had worked himself into a morbid state of\r\nmind. Some mysterious wag had sent him a warning that the city would be\r\nburned that night. The Jeffersonians smiled and shrugged their\r\nshoulders, and one editor suggested that, since the conflagration was\r\npromised for the fast day, ‘the incendiaries meant political or\r\necclesiastical fire.’[1424] But Adams, taking it seriously, saw\r\nconspirators all about, incendiaries, assassins. Determined to die\r\nresisting at his post, he had his servants carry arms and ammunition\r\ninto the house by the back way to withstand a siege.\r\n\r\nThe day was quiet enough, with business suspended and the churches\r\nfilled. Preachers pounced upon the Democrats and infidels with demoniac\r\nfury. But in the evening the Terror came--and even as an old man Adams\r\ncould recall it only with a shudder. The Administration papers of the\r\ntime, eager to paint the picture black, could find nothing serious to\r\nreport, however. A few butcher boys, none the wiser for drink, exercised\r\ntheir lungs in the State House yard until the soldiers swept down upon\r\nthem, arresting a few who were dismissed on the morrow, and frightening\r\nthe others home.[1425] But that was not the only mob that roved the\r\nstreets that night. The patriots had their inning, too, smashing the\r\nwindows of Bache’s house and smearing the statue of that filthy\r\nDemocrat, Benjamin Franklin, with mud from the gutters. The war\r\npropagandists fairly fluttered with activity. Hopkinson’s new song,\r\n‘Hail Columbia,’ was wildly cheered at the theaters, much to the disgust\r\nof the Democrats, who resented the complimentary reference to\r\nAdams,[1426] and, when the author was soon given a Government position,\r\nit was suggested that Hopkinson had certainly ‘written his song to the\r\nright tune.’[1427] When Fox the actor sang the song at the theater in\r\nBaltimore, it was observed that ‘some Jacobins left the room.’[1428]\r\nEven this hysteria did not satisfy the war hawks who stood in the wings\r\nbeating tom-toms and crying, ‘War! War! War!’ Hamilton was urging\r\nWashington ‘under some pretext of health’ to tour Virginia and North\r\nCarolina to give occasion for dinners and warlike addresses. From his\r\nretreat at Dedham, Fisher Ames was writing nervously to Pickering that\r\n‘we must make haste to wage war or we shall be lost.’[1429] Hopkinson,\r\nthe song-writer, observing the serenity of New York, was wishing that he\r\nwere a despot that he might ‘order the whole city to undergo the Turkish\r\nceremony of the bastinado’ and ‘rouse the lazy drones with a\r\nwhip.’[1430] In far-off Lisbon, William Smith was nauseated with ‘the\r\nold womanish whining about our reluctance to war.’[1431]\r\n\r\nThen John Marshall returned and the tired voices of the shouters found a\r\ntonic. Out to Kensington they went to meet him, sour-visaged Pickering\r\nin a carriage looking stern and warlike despite his spectacles, three\r\ncompanies of cavalry on prancing steeds, citizens and Congressmen in\r\nconveyances or on horseback. Long before the town was reached, ‘the\r\nstreets and windows, even the housetops in many instances, were crowded\r\nwith people.’[1432] The bells in the steeple of Christ Church began to\r\npeal, and peal they did far into the night. The reverberations of cannon\r\nmingled with the huzzas of the populace as the procession moved slowly\r\non through as many streets as possible to the City Tavern. ‘All this was\r\nto secure him to their views that he might say nothing that would oppose\r\nthe game they were playing,’ Jefferson wrote Madison.[1433] The next\r\nmorning the war party thronged the tavern, a dinner was given, and there\r\nwas much satisfaction when Jefferson, who had called, was unable to see\r\nthe hero.[1434] Livingston, who had accompanied Marshall from New York,\r\nhad been assured that France had no thought of war, but soon stories\r\nwere afloat through the city, as emanating from the envoy, of a\r\ncontradictory nature.[1435]\r\n\r\nAgain the prancing of cavalry in the streets when Marshall departed for\r\nVirginia--a series of ovations all the way.[1436] Then Pinckney\r\nreturned--and more pageants. Soldiers and citizens vied at Princeton and\r\nTrenton, and a dinner was given and the French damned.[1437] All the\r\ntime the country was being overwhelmed with propaganda such as it had\r\nnever known before. Hamilton was writing his bitter invectives against\r\nthe French,[1438] in which France was ‘a den of pillage and slaughter’\r\nand Frenchmen ‘foul birds of prey.’ These letters, running in Fenno’s\r\npaper, alarmed Jefferson, who wrote to prod Madison from the lethargy of\r\nretirement. ‘Sir, take up your pen against this champion. You know the\r\ningenuity of his talents, and there is not a person but yourself who can\r\nfoil him. For heaven’s sake, then, take up your pen and do not desert\r\nthe public cause entirely.’[1439] But even more damaging than the pen of\r\nHamilton was that of William Cobbett, ‘Peter Porcupine.’ As a\r\nmanufacturer of horrors he makes the wildest propagandists of the World\r\nWar pale like a candle held against the sun. Childishly happy was the\r\n‘Porcupine’ of those days when he could fight, on American soil, ‘for\r\nhis country’ and his King. Thus ‘the sans-culottes’ had ‘taken vessels\r\noff the bar at Charleston’ and the French had landed and were plundering\r\nfarmhouses.[1440] Thus a French invasion plot was discovered.\r\n‘Porcupine’ had the particulars. The negro slaves were to be armed and\r\nused as allies against the whites. ‘What a pretty figure Nicholas and\r\nGiles will cut,’ wrote the jubilant Peter, ‘when Citizen Pompey and\r\nCitizen Cæsar shall have tied their hands behind them.... Could its\r\nmiseries be confined to these, I would say, God hasten it.’[1441] ‘Gaunt\r\nGallatin’ working hard all night? Useless, useless--‘war, frightful war\r\nthere will be in spite of all his teeth and his nails too.’[1442] And\r\nthen again, the invasion. Rumor had it that the French were buying three\r\nthousand stand of arms for the West Indies. ‘That these arms were\r\nbought for Virginia and Georgia is much more likely,’ commented\r\n‘Porcupine.’ ‘Take care, take care, you sleepy southern fools. Your\r\nnegroes will probably be your masters this day twelve month.’[1443]\r\n‘Extra!’ ‘Extra!’ ‘Startling News from Virginia’--‘these villians have\r\nactually begun to tamper with our negroes.’ An ‘ill-looking fellow on\r\nhorseback’ had been seen talking with some slaves. It was understood he\r\nhad come from Philadelphia, and the ruffian was a refugee from English\r\njustice in Ireland.[1444] And then, another lurid article on ‘Horrors of\r\na French Invasion,’ with bloodcurdling pictures of the outraging of\r\nAmerican wives and daughters.[1445]\r\n\r\nThe French invasion at hand--slaves armed--masters murdered in their\r\nbeds--churches burned--women outraged--girls kidnaped--horrors piled on\r\nhorrors, and all because of democracy. Little wonder that the\r\napprehensive Adams, who temperamentally sniffed treachery in every\r\nbreeze, all but trembled as he turned the pages of his ‘Porcupine’ that\r\nyear. In Boston the presses were kept busy turning out Harper’s war\r\nspeech,[1446] and Cabot was spurring Harper on to greater efforts.\r\nThere, too, the rabid war speech of a Harvard professor made on Fast Day\r\nin Brattle Street was being published as a pamphlet,[1447] and the\r\nclergy were urging the hate of French democracy as a Christian duty, and\r\nconverting their pulpits into pedestals of Mars. Dr. Tappan of Boston\r\nwas making political harangues that Federalist politicians were\r\npraising,[1448] and Father Thayer was clamoring for slaughter in pious\r\naccents.[1449] Sometimes Democratic members of congregations who sought\r\nChrist instead of Cæsar in the temples indignantly left, and on one\r\noccasion an audacious and irreverent Jeffersonian paused on his way out\r\nto exclaim in Latin, ‘Why so much anger in the heart of a divine?’[1450]\r\nNor were some of the war propagandists on the Bench to be outdone by\r\nthose in the pulpit. Judge Rush was thundering vituperative phrases at\r\nthe French in a charge to a jury.[1451] Chief Justice Dana of\r\nMassachusetts phrased one of his charges like a participant in a\r\ncongressional party scrimmage.[1452] Much earlier, Chief Justice\r\nEllsworth of the United States Supreme Court made a grand jury charge\r\nthe occasion for an amazing attack on the Jeffersonian Party.[1453] As\r\nearly as May, Jefferson was utterly disheartened by the ‘war spirit\r\nworked up in the town.’[1454] By June he was writing Kosciusko that he\r\nthought war ‘almost inevitable.’[1455] In August he felt that ‘there is\r\nno event however atrocious which may not be expected,’ and was promising\r\nto meet the Maratists ‘in such a way as shall not be derogatory either\r\nto the public liberty or my own personal honor.’[1456]\r\n\r\nThe country was rushing toward the Terror, with the war party rattling\r\nsabers and threatening their opponents with violence. ‘Porcupine’ was\r\npredicting gleefully that ‘when the occasion requires, the Yankees will\r\nshow themselves as ready at stringing up insurgents as in stringing\r\nonions.’[1457] It was an open season for physical assaults on\r\nJeffersonian editors and Bache was being attacked in his office,[1458]\r\nand another assailant who had sought to murder him found his\r\nfifty-dollar fine paid by the politicians when he proffered the money,\r\nand Adams sent him on a mission to Europe.[1459] The Federalists, for\r\nthe moment, were cocks of the walk, and even Hamilton was rushing into\r\nprint with a letter that would have endeared him to the Three\r\nMusketeers. A nondescript had referred in the press to his ambition and\r\nhis affair with Mrs. Reynolds. Ludicrously interpreting it as a threat\r\nof assassination because of a reference to Cæsar, Hamilton lost his head\r\nand published a signed statement promising that the ‘assassin’ would\r\n‘not find me unprepared to repel attack.’[1460] This childish boast\r\nplayed into the hands of the obscure assailant, who replied: ‘Armed with\r\na cane (whether with a sword therein I cannot say) you walk about,\r\nprepared, you say, to defy attack. By this you fall beneath resentment\r\nand excite my pity.’[1461] A few days later he was writing of ‘the\r\ndeclaration made in company’ by ‘a Mr. Patterson, a clerk to Alexander\r\nHamilton,’ that the writer would be murdered, and offering five hundred\r\ndollars reward for the apprehension of the prospective assassin.[1462]\r\nWild days, wild days!\r\n\r\nThis was the temper in which Congress resumed its deliberations after\r\nthe publication of the X Y Z papers. Jefferson advised his followers to\r\nseek an adjournment to permit the members to consult the people, and had\r\nthis procedure been adopted the Federalists might have escaped the\r\npitfalls to which they were reeling.[1463] The Democrats in the streets\r\nwere cowed and only the most audacious met threats with bravado or\r\ncourage. The braves of Tammany at a public dinner drank to the toast:\r\n‘May the old Tories and all who wish to engage the United States in a\r\nwar with any nation, realize the felicity they anticipate by being\r\nplaced in the front of the first battle.’[1464] The Boston ‘Chronicle’\r\nwas publishing letters from ‘Benedict Arnold’ offering his services in\r\nthe war for England, and rejoicing ‘to hear that so many of my\r\ncountrymen have shaken off their delusion, as I predicted they would\r\nonly eighteen years ago.’[1465] Day after day it published Josiah\r\nQuincy’s speech, made in 1774, against standing armies. Soon it was\r\ncalling attention to profiteering of war patriots in Boston who had a\r\nmonopoly on Raven’s Duck which would be wanted for tents.[1466]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut the Democratic leaders required all their courage to stand up before\r\nthe fusillade--Jefferson most of all. With the Philadelphia streets\r\nfilled with swaggering young men in uniforms, many nights he heard ‘The\r\nRogue’s March’ played beneath his windows. Bitter, threatening letters\r\nburdened his mail. Spies crept to his dinner table to pick up the stray\r\nthreads of casual conversation that could be given a sinister twist, and\r\nhe was forced to deny himself to all but his most intimate\r\nfriends.[1467] When forced to appear in company, he simulated an\r\nabstracted silence, ignored personal affronts, and talked calmly when at\r\nall. ‘All the passions are boiling over,’ he wrote in May, ‘and he who\r\nwould keep himself cool and clear of the contagion is so far below the\r\npoint of ordinary conversation that he finds himself isolated in every\r\nsociety.’[1468] Convinced that even his correspondence was tampered\r\nwith, he no longer dared write freely in letters entrusted to the\r\nmails.[1469] Spies dogged his footsteps and kept guard at his\r\ndoor.[1470] When on a visit to Virginia he accepted an entertainment on\r\nSunday, the floodgates were opened upon him, and his enemies boasted\r\nthat ‘this fact has been trumpeted from one end of the country to the\r\nother as irrefutable proof of his contempt for the Christian religion,\r\nand his devotion to the new religion of France.’[1471] Sad that Rufus\r\nKing and Christopher Gore had continued their English tour on Sunday,\r\nand too bad that the Federalists persisted in holding their political\r\ncaucuses in Boston on Sunday evenings, retorted the ‘Independent\r\nChronicle.’[1472]\r\n\r\nNo dinner of the war party was complete without an insulting toast on\r\nJefferson. ‘Jefferson--May he deserve better of his country than he has\r\nhitherto done.’[1473] ‘The Vice-President--May his heart be purged of\r\nGallicism in the pure fire of Federalism or be lost in the\r\nfurnace’--with groans.[1474] ‘John Adams--May he like Samson slay\r\nthousands of Frenchmen with the jaw bone of Jefferson.’[1475] And in the\r\nmidst of the mobbing, the self-contained philosopher kept his mouth shut\r\nand his feet upon the ground. With ‘The Rogue’s March’ ringing in his\r\nears he was able to write a long letter on the value of crop\r\nrotation;[1476] another on a plough he had invented;[1477] and in the\r\nmidst of the Sedition Bill debate, learning that an acquaintance was\r\ngoing west of the Mississippi where wild horses roved the plains, he\r\nsent the suggestion that this was ‘the last opportunity to study them in\r\na state of nature,’ and requesting him to prepare a report for the\r\nPhilosophical Society.[1478] Many days found him alone in the library of\r\nthis Society, and once, during that hectic summer, he stole away from\r\nthe turmoil and hate to the beautiful country home of the Logans where\r\nhe could forget the bitterness of the battle browsing in its great\r\nlibrary or lounging beneath its majestic trees.[1479]\r\n\r\nEverywhere the Democrats were fair game for persecution. Matthew Lyon\r\nfound a band playing ‘The Rogue’s March’ in front of his tavern at\r\nTrenton and New Brunswick where crowds shouted imprecations.[1480] In\r\nNew York, only the appearance of fighting Irish friends prevented the\r\nwar hawks from serenading Edward Livingston’s home with the offensive\r\nMarch.[1481] In Boston the ‘patriots’ expelled Thomas Adams, editor of\r\nthe ‘Chronicle,’ from the Fire Society of which he had been a faithful\r\nmember for fourteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn this atmosphere, the Federalist machinery in Congress was set in\r\nmotion at high speed on war measures. Provisions were made for the\r\nstrengthening of the coast defenses, a navy was created, an army\r\nprovided, taxes levied, and through all this the Jeffersonians, under\r\nthe calm, courageous leadership of Albert Gallatin, merely sought to\r\nexercise a moderating influence. If war was to come, provision had to be\r\nmade. But that was not enough for the radicals among the\r\nFederalists--the conditions were ripe for the crushing of domestic foes\r\nas well as foreign enemies. Here was the opportunity to destroy the\r\nparty of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe first manifestation of this intent came with the introduction of the\r\nAlien Bill in the Senate--aimed at the Irish more than at the French, if\r\nwe may judge from the correspondence of the Hamiltonian leaders and the\r\ntone of the Federalist press. Both fairly bristled with hatred of the\r\nIrish immigrant who was beginning to make himself felt in American\r\npolitics. This, in part a by-product of the Federalist partiality for\r\nEngland, was, in large measure, an expression of the Federalist\r\nabhorrence of insurrections against constituted authority everywhere.\r\nFrom the Ireland of that day, seething with rebellion, incoming vessels\r\nwere bringing Irish refugees, most of whom were members of the\r\nrevolutionary United Irishmen. Instinct and observation took them in a\r\nbody into the Jeffersonian Party, of which they became the shock troops\r\nin many parts of the country. It was only at Jeffersonian dinners that\r\nglasses were drained to the Liberal leaders in England, Fox and\r\nSheridan, and to the success of the Irish Rebellion; and only in\r\nJeffersonian papers that sympathy was expressed. It was during this\r\ntime that Irish patriots were being hurried to the gallows, and John\r\nPhilpot Curran was making his incomparable orations, now classics, in\r\ntheir defense. His burning phrases were being punctuated by the rattle\r\nof the soldiers’ musketry intended to awe him into silence. The patriot\r\npress was being crushed in Dublin. Castlereagh was busy with his dirty\r\nmoney buying members of the Irish Parliament where money would buy them,\r\nand finding renegades ready to cut their country’s throat for a title, a\r\nplace, or a ribbon to pin on their coats. Of these latter the most\r\nloathsome was Lord Clare, whose infamy has been embalmed in the\r\neloquence of Curran.\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance that the Jeffersonian dinners in those\r\ndays were toasting John Philpot Curran, and that his speeches were\r\nprinted by the column in the Jeffersonian press,[1482] while Cobbett was\r\ngiving three full pages to Lord Clare’s excoriation of his\r\ncountrymen.[1483] A month before the Alien Bill reached the House,\r\nCobbett was devoting a full page to a weird story involving the Irish in\r\nAmerica in a conspiracy with the French for the destruction of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.[1484] ‘That restless, rebellious tribe,\r\nthe emigrated United Irishman,’ snorted ‘Porcupine,’ the English\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nAll this was on the surface, but it did not reveal half the story. With\r\nthe Irish patriots, crushed by the soldiers of Cornwallis, seeking an\r\nasylum in America, Rufus King, the Federalist Minister in London, was\r\nwriting Hamilton rejoicing over the suppression of the Irish Rebellion,\r\nand expressing the hope that ‘our Government ... will have the power and\r\ninclination to exclude these disaffected characters, who will be\r\nsuffered to seek an asylum among us.’[1485] It was King’s aggressive\r\nprotest to the British Government that delayed for four years the\r\nrelease of the Irish prisoners who had planned an extensive settlement\r\nin America. Ten years later, the most brilliant of these, Thomas Addis\r\nEmmet, who was to become one of the ornaments of the New York Bar and to\r\nsleep at length by the roaring traffic of Broadway in Saint Paul’s\r\nchurchyard, wrote King in bitter rebuke: ‘I should have brought along\r\nwith me a brother [Robert Emmet] whose name perhaps will you even not\r\nread without emotions of sympathy and respect.’[1486] The Ministry had\r\nbeen favorable to the release and migration until King’s hot\r\nremonstrance against admitting such desperadoes as Thomas Addis Emmet!\r\nThis Federalist hate of the Irish reeked in the sneers of its press,\r\nexposed itself in the ‘wild Irish’ speech of Otis, in the official\r\nactions of King, in the correspondence of the leaders, in the\r\ndescription by Gibbs[1487] of the victims of Cornwallis’s bayonets and\r\nCastlereagh’s bribes as ‘fugitives from the justice of Great Britain.’\r\n\r\nMany thought, when the Alien Bill was introduced, that it was aimed at\r\nGallatin, and it was boasted in the coffee-houses of New York that it\r\nwould soon be easy to ‘ship him off.’[1488] Terrorized by the threat of\r\nthe measure, many harmless Frenchmen, including Volney, hastily\r\nchartered a ship and sailed away,[1489] but when a little later some\r\nemigrant French royalists came knocking at the door they were\r\nadmitted.[1490] Jefferson thought the bill ‘detestable,’[1491] and\r\nMadison, ‘a monster that will disgrace its parents.’[1492] Even Hamilton\r\nwas shocked at the bill introduced in the Senate, and he hastened a\r\nletter to Pickering urging moderation. ‘Let us not be cruel or violent,’\r\nhe wrote.[1493]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Sedition Bill was to crush the opposition press and\r\nsilence criticism of the ruling powers. Among the extreme and dominant\r\nFederalists criticism had long been confused with sedition, and Fenno\r\nhad long described attacks on Administration measures as treason.\r\nScurrility in the press was all too common, but the worst of the\r\nJeffersonian organs could be matched by the Federalists; and no one in\r\n1798 imagined that a Sedition Law would ever be evoked against\r\n‘Porcupine’ or Russell. The Hamiltonians were moving with such celerity\r\ntoward repression that a Congressman’s circularization of his\r\nconstituents with comments on policies and measures was being denounced\r\nas seditious, and Judge Iredell, a narrow partisan, had actually called\r\nthe attention of the Richmond Grand Jury to a letter from Representative\r\nCabell. ‘Porcupine’ had published this letter with abusive comments as\r\nthough it were a treasonable correspondence with an alien enemy.[1494]\r\nThe next day he published with enthusiastic praise a letter that Otis\r\nthe Federalist had written to a constituent in Boston.[1495]\r\n\r\nThe moment these measures were introduced, every one knew that Gallatin\r\nwas in danger because of his Genevese accent, but that ‘Porcupine,’ the\r\nEnglish subject, had no fears. Men like Hamilton Rowan, Dr. James\r\nPriestley, and Volney could be sent away, but the putrid offal of the\r\ndefunct court of Versailles could continue to count upon a dinner at the\r\nBinghams’. Cabell was subject to indictment for an action that was\r\ncommendable in Otis, and the merest child knew that the Sedition Law\r\nwould be applied to Jeffersonian papers alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBad as was the Alien Law, it did not approach the viciousness of the\r\nSedition Act; and the Sedition Bill as passed was mild compared with the\r\none the Federalist leaders in the Senate originally framed. Albeit\r\nAmerica and France were not at war, the bill declared the French people\r\nenemies of the American people, and that any one giving the former aid\r\nand comfort should be punishable with death. A strict enforcement of\r\nsuch an act would have sent Jefferson to the gallows. Under the Fourth\r\nArticle any one questioning the constitutionality or justice of an\r\nAdministration measure could be sent to herd with felons. It would have\r\nsealed the lips of members of Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen this monstrous measure reached Hamilton, he was dumbfounded at the\r\ntemerity and brutality of his followers. Grasping his pen, he hurriedly\r\nsent a note of warning to Wolcott. There were provisions that were\r\n‘highly exceptionable’ that would ‘endanger civil war.’ He hoped that\r\n‘the thing will not be hurried through.’ Why ‘establish a tyranny?’ Was\r\nnot ‘energy a very different thing from violence?’[1496] Reeling drunk\r\nwith intolerance, even Hamilton’s warning only coaxed a slight\r\nconcession to liberty, and it was a thoroughly vicious and tyrannical\r\nmeasure that was debated in the House. These debates were conducted\r\nunder conditions of disorder that would have disgraced a discussion of\r\nbrigands wrangling over a division of spoils in a wayside cave.\r\nGallatin, Livingston, and Nicholas were forced to talk against coughs,\r\nlaughter, conversation, and the scraping of the feet of the apostles of\r\n‘law and order.’ No personal insult too foul, no nincompoop too\r\ninsignificant to sneer in the face of Gallatin. Despite these\r\nterrorizing tactics, the Jeffersonians stood firm and made their record.\r\nEven the customary courtesy of Gallatin deserted him, however, and when\r\nthe sneering Harper darkly hinted at traitors in the House, he retorted\r\nsharply that he knew ‘nothing in the character of [Harper], either\r\npublic or private, to entitle him to the ground he so boldly assumes.’\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the debate on the Alien Bill, Edward Livingston\r\nclosed for the opposition; and in discussing the constitutional phase,\r\nhe anticipated the doctrine of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions,\r\nindicating probable conferences with the tall, silent man who was\r\npresiding over the Senate. ‘If we are ready to violate the\r\nConstitution,’ he said, ‘will the people submit to our unauthorized\r\nacts? Sir, they ought not to submit; they would deserve the chains that\r\nthese measures are forging for them.’ The effect of such a measure? ‘The\r\ncountry will swarm with informers, spies, delators, and all the odious\r\nreptile tribe that breed in the sunshine of despotic power.... The hours\r\nof the most unsuspected confidence, the intimacies of friendship, or the\r\nrecesses of domestic retirement, afford no security. The companion whom\r\nyou must trust, the friend in whom you must confide, the domestic who\r\nwaits in your chamber, are all tempted to betray your imprudent or\r\nunguarded follies; to misrepresent your words; to convey them, distorted\r\nby calumny, to the secret tribunal where jealousy presides--where fear\r\nofficiates as accuser, and suspicion is the only evidence that is\r\nheard.... Do not let us be told that we are to excite a fervor against a\r\nforeign aggression to establish a tyranny at home; that like the arch\r\ntraitor we cry “Hail Columbia”[1497] at the moment we are betraying her\r\nto destruction; that we sing, “Happy Land,” when we are plunging it in\r\nruin and disgrace; and that we are absurd enough to call ourselves free\r\nand enlightened while we advocate principles that would have disgraced\r\nthe age of Gothic barbarity.’[1498]\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken and the Alien Bill passed, 46 to 40.\r\n\r\nLivingston was to hear a few days later when the debate on the Sedition\r\nBill was reached that he had been guilty of sedition in his speech on\r\nthe Alien Bill. Not least among the grotesque features of the crazy\r\ntimes was the prominence, amounting to leadership, attained by John\r\nAllen of Connecticut--a tall, hectic, sour-visaged fanatic. It was\r\nreserved for him to indict the Jeffersonians generally for sedition. Had\r\nnot Livingston been guilty of sedition when he proposed that Gerry be\r\nauthorized to renew negotiations? Was not the ‘Aurora’s’ explanation of\r\nthe effect of the Alien Law upon the Irish treason? Were not members of\r\nCongress who dared write their views to their constituents traitors?\r\nFrom a want-wit like this fanatic such views were more ludicrous than\r\ndepressing, but Harper rose to give his full assent to the buffoonery of\r\nAllen. ‘What!’ exclaimed Nicholas, ‘is it proposed to prevent members\r\nfrom speaking what they please or prohibit them from reaching the people\r\nwith their views?’ And Harper, disclaiming any desire to curtail the\r\nfreedom of speech upon the floor, bravely admitted a desire to prevent\r\nthe speeches from reaching the people ‘out of doors.’ This astounding\r\ndoctrine brought Gallatin to his feet with a scornful denunciation of\r\nAllen’s criticism of Cabell’s letter. It ‘contained more information and\r\nmore sense than the gentleman from Connecticut has displayed or can\r\ndisplay.’ Taking up every assertion in Cabell’s letter and making it his\r\nown, he challenged a denial of its truth. Then, referring to the attack\r\non Livingston’s speech, Gallatin gave his full sanction to the New York\r\nstatesman’s doctrine of resistance to unconstitutional measures. ‘I\r\nbelieve that doctrine is absolutely correct and neither seditious nor\r\ntreasonable.’\r\n\r\nOn the last day Livingston spoke with his usual spirit and eloquence,\r\nand Harper closed for the bill with an anti-climactic charge, apropos of\r\nnothing, that the Jeffersonian plan of government was in the interest of\r\n‘men of immoderate ambition, great family connections, hereditary\r\nwealth, and extensive influence’ like Livingston. ‘Great patrician\r\nfamilies’ would walk over the heads ‘of we plebeian people.’ This\r\ntouching appeal for the plebeians could hardly have been meant for\r\nPhiladelphia where at that time ‘the great patricians’ were lavishly\r\nwining and dining the Harpers, and rigidly excluding the Livingstons\r\nand Gallatins from their tables. Thus the Federalists closed their case\r\nand the bill passed, 44 to 41.[1499]\r\n\r\nThe press was peculiarly silent through the debates. Russell in the\r\nBoston ‘Centinel’ observed that ‘Benedict Arnold complained bitterly of\r\nthe treason bill,’[1500] and his rival, Thomas Adams of the ‘Chronicle,’\r\nannounced the passage with the comment that ‘we are now abridged the\r\nfreedom of the press.’[1501] Soon the ‘Commercial Advertiser’ of New\r\nYork would be dubbing all men traitors who criticized the Sedition Law,\r\nand Jefferson would be inviting Hamilton Rowan to the sanctuary of\r\nMonticello with the assurance that the Habeas Corpus Act was still\r\noperative in Virginia.[1502] Almost immediately the Reign of Terror\r\nbroke upon the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIn the midst of political terrors the yellow fever stalked again into\r\nthe haunts of men, striking in New York, in Boston, with special\r\nvirulence in Philadelphia. By the first of October, fourteen hundred had\r\ndied in New York City. Hamilton remained in town until persuaded by his\r\nfamily to go to the country, but he continued to visit the city daily to\r\nconfer with his political friends.[1503] In Philadelphia those who could\r\nafford it took to flight. Soon thousands were encamped in tents on the\r\ncommon on the outskirts and by October not more than seven thousand\r\npeople remained in the stricken city. An English traveler, entering in\r\nSeptember, found the theaters, taverns, drinking-houses, gambling-dens,\r\nand dance-halls closed, hospital carts moving slowly through abandoned\r\nstreets, the casket-makers alone busy. Sitting one night on the steps of\r\na house in Arch Street, where most houses were deserted, he could hear\r\nnothing but the groans of the dying, the lamentations of the living, the\r\nhammers of the coffin-makers, the dismal howling of deserted dogs.[1504]\r\nEven the physicians took to their heels, but Dr. Rush, the head of his\r\nprofession, remained to battle with the disease.[1505] The health office\r\nwas kept open day and night.[1506]\r\n\r\nBut even in the midst of death the politicians fought with scarcely\r\ndiminished ferocity. ‘Porcupine’ and Fenno were stooping to the ghastly\r\nbusiness of maligning the methods of Dr. Rush in treating the disease.\r\nStanding heroically to his duty where others had fled, he was forced,\r\nday by day, to read the most scurrilous attacks upon him. The animus was\r\ndue to the fact that Rush was a Jeffersonian; and even from Lisbon,\r\nWilliam Smith contributed his slur in a letter to Wolcott manifesting\r\nsympathy with the attacks because he had ‘always considered the Doctor a\r\nwrong-headed politician.’[1507] Bache and Fenno clawed on, amidst the\r\ndying and the dead, until one September day the fever entered the Fenno\r\nhouse and struck down both the editor and his wife. When she died, the\r\n‘Gazette’ was suspended, and the next day John Fenno ceased his attacks\r\non Dr. Rush, for Death had intervened.[1508] ‘Alas poor John Fenno,’\r\nwrote Ames, ‘a worthy man, a true Federalist, always firm in his\r\nprinciples, mild in maintaining them, and bitter against foes. No\r\nprinter was ever so correct in his politics.’[1509] A few days later,\r\nBenjamin Franklin Bache of the ‘Aurora’ fought no more. The Boston\r\n‘Chronicle’ announced his death in a black-bordered editorial lamenting\r\n‘the loss of a man of inflexible virtue, unappalled by power or\r\npersecution, and who, in dying, knew no anxieties but what was excited\r\nby his apprehensions for his country and for his young family.’[1510]\r\nThe Jeffersonian press published long articles and poems of tribute. In\r\nNew York the Democrats lost the services of Greenleaf of the ‘Argus,’\r\nanother victim of the plague.\r\n\r\nJohn Ward Fenno took up the work of his father, and the widows of Bache\r\nand Greenleaf sought to continue the ‘Aurora’ and the ‘Argus,’ the\r\nformer calling to her assistance one of the ablest controversial\r\njournalists of his time, William Duane. No Jeffersonian papers made an\r\nunfeeling reference to the death of Fenno; the passing of Bache was\r\ngloated over in ghoulish fashion by the Federalist press, and soon\r\n‘Porcupine’ and young Fenno were making merry over ‘the widows Bache and\r\nGreenleaf.’ It was part of the Reign of Terror--and the fight went on.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt went on because there was a congressional election pending and both\r\nparties were putting forth their utmost effort. The Federalists were\r\nhoping that under the influence of war hysteria the Jeffersonians could\r\nbe annihilated; the Jeffersonians were fighting desperately to hold the\r\nline. The most sensational feature of the campaign was the emergence as\r\nan avowed party man of Washington, whose aristocratic viewpoint made\r\ndemocracy offensive. He went the full length, finding nothing\r\nobjectionable in the Alien and Sedition Laws. When, on his persuasion,\r\nPatrick Henry entered the campaign as a candidate for the Assembly, he\r\ntoo defended these wretched measures with the silly and insincere\r\nstatement that they were ‘too deep’ for him and were the emanations of a\r\n‘wise body.’[1511]\r\n\r\nBut more important than the emergence of Washington was the\r\ncongressional candidacy of John Marshall, who entered the fight on\r\nWashington’s insistence. The Hamiltonian Federalists were delighted with\r\nhis candidacy until the publication of his letter opposing the Alien and\r\nSedition Laws, when they turned upon him with bitter scorn. ‘His\r\ncharacter is done for,’ wrote Ames.[1512] Noah Webster commented that\r\n‘he speaks the language of true Americanism except on the Alien and\r\nSedition Laws.’[1513] ‘Porcupine’ added an editor’s note to the letter\r\nin his paper: ‘The publication of these questions and answers will do\r\nneither good nor harm. I insert them as a sort of record of Mr.\r\nMarshall’s character. If I were a voter, however, I would sooner vote\r\nfor Gallatin than for Marshall.’[1514] The New England Federalists were\r\nwrathy among themselves over Marshall’s apostasy. ‘Mr. Marshall,’ wrote\r\nCabot to Pickering, ‘has given us great uneasiness here by his\r\nanswers.... Mr. Marshall, I know, has much to learn on the subject of a\r\npractical system of free government for the United States.... I believe,\r\nhowever, that he will eventually prove a great acquisition.’[1515] It\r\nwas at this juncture that Cabot proved his superior political\r\nperspicacity by taking up his pen in defense of Marshall for the Boston\r\n‘Centinel.’[1516] The struggle in Virginia was bitter. The\r\nJeffersonians, long prepared for Washington’s action, were undismayed,\r\nand they fought with increased vim. The result was that, while Marshall\r\nwon by 108 majority, the Jeffersonians elected all but eight of the\r\nRepresentatives, carried the Legislature, and elected a United States\r\nSenator.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists were chagrined with the general result. Cabot was\r\ndisappointed with Massachusetts[1517] and Maryland.[1518] A Senator had\r\nbeen lost in North Carolina, and from South Carolina the Jeffersonians\r\nhad sent to the Senate their most resourceful leader, Charles Pinckney.\r\nTheodore Sedgwick, surveying the field, and writing his observations to\r\nKing in London, could find no improvement in the Senate and but a slight\r\n‘amelioration’ in the House. The Jeffersonians had won six out of ten\r\nseats in New York, gained two in New Jersey, and eight out of thirteen\r\nin Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBut Giles was gone--retiring in disgust to the Legislature of Virginia.\r\nThe election was over--and the Reign of Terror was beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIt began in the summer of 1798 and extended through the autumn of 1800.\r\nThe growing sentiment for democracy and the increasing popularity of\r\nJefferson were maddening to the Federalists, who fared forth to destroy\r\nboth with a club. The Alien and Sedition Laws were to be used for the\r\npurpose. Democrats, from the highest to the most lowly, were to be\r\nproscribed and treated with contempt. The New England clergy, for the\r\nmost part, entered heartily into the plan. The colleges joined. So\r\nopenly partisan became the institutions of learning that the\r\nJeffersonian press opened their batteries upon the ‘arbitrary spirit\r\nwhich has been exposed in the eastern seminaries.’[1519] With much\r\nceremony Doctors’ Degrees were being bestowed upon Federalist\r\npoliticians, and Pickering and Wolcott were made Doctors of Law. ‘Except\r\nTimothy’s vulgar diplomacy who ever heard of the qualifications in him?’\r\nasked the irreverent Duane, and while ‘Oliver has dabbled in politics\r\nand glittered in prose’ ‘he would never have been discovered by the\r\nsavants had he not been in the Cabinet of a New England\r\nPresident.’[1520] Other Federalist politicians were thus given the\r\ndisguise of scholarship, but Jefferson, President of the Philosophical\r\nSociety, and friend of Franklin and Rittenhouse, received no degrees.\r\n\r\nVery early, gangs of self-proclaimed patriots sallied forth into the\r\ncountry to tear down the liberty poles erected by the Democrats, armed\r\nwith pistols and swords, and clattering over the country roads like\r\nCossacks on a rampage. One of these gangs under the leadership of a\r\nPhilip Strubling, operating in Berks County, Pennsylvania, had a\r\ntriumphant career, except where armed men showed fight, when the gallant\r\nband found discretion the better part of valor.[1521] This sort of\r\noutrage was being committed all over the country. Plans were made to\r\nwreck the printing plant of Duane until it was found that his friends\r\nhad armed for defense, and the editor warned the conspirators that an\r\nattempt at violence ‘would carry public vengeance to their\r\nfiresides.’[1522]\r\n\r\nWhen thwarted in their plans against the leaders, the terrorists turned\r\nupon the weak and lowly, demanding the discharge of Jeffersonian\r\nartisans employed in the manufacture of war material. Out with them! ‘It\r\nis a notorious fact,’ complained Fenno, ‘that a number of artisans ...\r\nare of politics destructive of the Constitution.’[1523] Everywhere, in\r\nthe pulpits of political preachers, from the Bench of Federal Judges,\r\nthrough the press and on the streets, men were beating upon the tom-toms\r\narousing the apprehensions of the people; and when, one night, some\r\npirates, sentenced to execution, escaped from the Philadelphia jail, the\r\nclatter of the mounted soldiers in pursuit was enough to fill the\r\nstreets with affrighted people. The Germans of Northampton were marching\r\non the city with pitchforks. The soldiers were out after Duane,\r\nwhispered others, and armed Democrats rushed to the rescue. At length\r\nthe fever subsided and order was restored. ‘Nothing more serious than\r\nthe disturbance of love-making,’ said the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _MAD TOM in A RAGE_\r\n\r\nA CONTEMPORARY CARTOON TYPICAL OF THE FEDERALIST ATTACKS ON JEFFERSON]\r\n\r\n‘Aurora.’[1524] These were minor incidents--the background for the real\r\nterror to come. Judges were terrorizing the people with wild charges to\r\ngrand juries.[1525] The Right Reverend Bishop White of Philadelphia was\r\npreaching piously and patriotically from the text: ‘Let every soul be\r\nsubject to the higher powers. For there is no purpose but of God. The\r\npowers that be are ordained of God. Whoso therefore resisteth the power,\r\nresisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist shall receive to\r\nthemselves damnation.’[1526] The Administration organ in New York was\r\nlaying down the dictum: ‘When a man is heard to inveigh against the\r\nSedition Law, set him down as one who would submit to no restraint which\r\nis calculated for the peace of society. He deserves to be\r\nsuspected.’[1527] And Timothy Pickering was nervously peering through\r\nhis spectacles over Jeffersonian papers seeking some phrase on which a\r\nprosecution for sedition could be brought, and prodding the district\r\nattorneys to action. ‘Heads, more heads!’ screamed Marat from his tub.\r\n‘Heads, more heads!’ echoed Pickering from his office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF TERROR\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the first notable victim of the Terror was\r\nMatthew Lyon whom we have seen insulted at various points when homeward\r\nbound from Philadelphia. Bitter though he was, he had sound sense and\r\nrealized his danger. When the Rutland ‘Herald’ refused to publish his\r\naddress to his constituents, he launched his own paper, ‘The Scourge of\r\nAristocracy,’ with a defiant challenge: ‘When every aristocratic\r\nhireling from the English Porcupine ... to the dirty hedge-hogs and\r\ngroveling animals of his race in this and neighboring States are\r\nvomiting forth columns of lies, malicious abuse and deception, the\r\nScourge will be devoted to politics.’ How Pickering must have stared\r\nthrough his spectacles at that defiance! But patience! If speeches and\r\npapers offered no case, there still were letters, and one was found.\r\nHere surely was ‘sedition.’ Had Lyon not referred to Adams’s ‘continual\r\ngrasp for power,’ to his ‘unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish\r\nadulation, and selfish avarice’? Had he not charged that the President\r\nhad turned men out of office for party reasons, and that ‘the sacred\r\nname of religion’ was ‘employed as a state engine to make mankind hate\r\nand persecute one another’? Had he not printed a letter from Barlow, the\r\npoet, referring to ‘the bullying speech of your President and the stupid\r\nanswer of your Senate’? It was enough. True, the letter had been\r\npublished before the Sedition Law was passed, but this was the Reign of\r\nTerror. The trial before Judge Peters was a farce, and the culprit was\r\nfound guilty. ‘Matthew Lyon,’ said Peters in fixing the sentence, ‘as a\r\nmember of the Federal Legislature you must be well acquainted with the\r\nmischiefs which flow from the unlicensed abuse of Government’--and Lyon\r\nwas sentenced to four months in jail and to pay a fine of a thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThen the Terror began to work in earnest. There was a fairly respectable\r\njail at Rutland where the trial was held, but not for Lyon. There was\r\nsomething worse at Vergennes, forty miles away, a loathsome pen in a\r\nmiserable little town of sixty houses, and thither he was ordered.\r\nRefusing his request to return to his house for some papers, he was\r\nordered to mount a horse, and with two troopers with pistols, riding\r\nbehind, the forty-mile journey through the wilderness was made. At\r\nVergennes they pushed him into a cell, sixteen by twelve, ordinarily\r\nused for common felons of the lowest order. In one corner was a toilet\r\nemitting a sickening stench. A half-moon door opened on the corridor,\r\nthrough which his coarse food was passed. Through a window with heavy\r\niron bars he got some light. There was no stove and the cold of autumn\r\nnights came in through the window. When it became dangerously chilly,\r\nthe prisoner put on his overcoat and paced the cell. He was refused pen\r\nand paper until the indignation of the public forced a concession. A\r\nvisitor peering through the half-moon of the door a little later would\r\nhave seen a table strewn with paper, Volney’s ‘Ruins,’ some Messages of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Vermont hills were aflame with fury. The Green Mountain\r\nBoys, the Minute Men, the soldiers who, with Lyon, had followed Ethan\r\nAllen, were talking of tearing the jail down. Then, from the filthy,\r\nfoul-smelling hole, into which the Federalists had thrown a member of\r\nCongress, came letters from the ‘convict,’ brave, cheerful letters,\r\nexhorting these men to observe the law. One day, however, Lyon was\r\nforced to plead through the iron bars of his window for the furious mob\r\nwithout to seek redress legally at the polls. Thus popular resentment\r\nincreased with the growth of the prisoner’s popularity. Thousands of the\r\nyeomanry of Vermont signed a petition for a pardon and sent it to Adams,\r\nwho refused to receive it. Aha, ‘the despicable, cringing, fawning\r\npuppy!’ exulted Fenno.[1528] The indignation of the yeomanry of Vermont\r\nnow blazed high. The Administration was amazed, almost appalled. When\r\nthis ‘convict’ in a hideous cell was nominated for Congress, there were\r\nnot jails enough in Vermont for the talkers of ‘sedition.’ He was\r\nelected overwhelmingly with 4576 votes to 2444 for his nearest\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\nAgain the terrorists consulted on plans to thwart the public will. His\r\nterm was about to expire, but where would this pauper get a thousand\r\ndollars? True, the farmers, the comrades of the Revolution, were going\r\ninto their pockets to get the money--but a thousand dollars! Still there\r\nwas a chance. The Marshal summoned Federalist lawyers to go over Lyon’s\r\nletters and find more sedition on which he could be arrested on emerging\r\nfrom the jail. His triumphant election was more than the terrorists\r\ncould bear. ‘Must our national councils be again disgraced by that vile\r\nbeast?’ asked their New York organ.[1529] Meanwhile, the problem of the\r\nfine was being solved. The eyes of the Nation were on that dirty little\r\ncell at Vergennes. Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, John Taylor of\r\nCaroline, Senator Mason of Virginia--he who had given the Jay Treaty to\r\nthe ‘Aurora’--and Apollis Austen, a wealthy Vermont Democrat, were\r\nsolving the problem of the fine. On the day of Lyon’s delivery, the\r\nVirginia Senator rode into the village, his saddle-bags bulging with a\r\nthousand and more in gold. There he met Austen with a strong-box\r\ncontaining more than a thousand in silver. Mason paid the money.\r\n\r\nBefore the jail had assembled a vast multitude. Out of the door rushed\r\nLyon. ‘I am on my way to Philadelphia!’--to Congress, he shouted. A roar\r\nwent up, a procession with a flag in front was formed, and the ‘convict’\r\nwas on his way triumphantly. The school children at Tinmouth paraded in\r\nhis honor, and a youthful orator greeted him with a welcome to ‘our\r\nbrave Representative who has been suffering for us under an unjust\r\nsentence, and the tyranny of a detested understrapper of despotism.’ The\r\nwoods reverberated with shouts. Then on moved the procession. At\r\nBennington, another ovation, more speeches. Seated in a sleigh, his wife\r\nbeside him, Lyon was escorted by the throng. At times the procession was\r\ntwelve miles long. Through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the\r\novations were repeated. He had gone home to the tune of ‘The Rogue’s\r\nMarch’; he returned by the same route to the tune of ‘Yankee\r\nDoodle.’[1530]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe terrorists ground their teeth and sought revenge--with nothing too\r\npetty. The Reverend John C. Ogden dared to be a Democrat and to carry\r\nthe petition for Lyon to Philadelphia. Thenceforth he was a marked man.\r\nHe was in debt--and a debt would serve. Returning from Philadelphia, he\r\nwas arrested at Litchfield, Connecticut, and thrown into jail. ‘It is\r\npresumed,’ sneered Major Russell of the Boston ‘Centinel,’ ‘that Lyon\r\nwhen he goes from his jail to Congress will at least sneak into\r\nLitchfield to pay a visit to his envoy and take a petition from him to\r\nthe Vice-President [Jefferson].’[1531] But jail was too good for such a\r\nrascal. On his release a crowd of soldiers followed him out of\r\nLitchfield, calling him ‘a damn Democrat,’ abusing, insulting,\r\ncollaring, shaking him. It was their purpose to take him back to\r\nLitchfield and scourge him in public. Whirling him around, the gallant\r\nsoldiers started back. Meanwhile, the report had spread that the heroic\r\nremnant of the army had set forth on a mobbing expedition, and a party\r\nof Democrats and civilians mounted horses and rushed to the rescue. The\r\ncourage of the soldiers, so splendid in the presence of one man, oozed\r\nout on the approach of the rescuers, and Ogden was released.[1532]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut Ogden was not the only victim of the terrorists, among the friends\r\nof Lyon. Anthony Haswell, born in England, a man of education, who had\r\nseen service in the army of Washington and had narrowly escaped death at\r\nMonmouth, was editor of the ‘Vermont Gazette.’ A gentleman of amiability\r\nand integrity, his popularity was great in Vermont--but he was a\r\nJeffersonian. One day the sleuths of the Terror, scanning the pages of\r\nDemocratic papers, found an appeal in Haswell’s ‘Gazette’ for funds to\r\npay the fine of Lyon. It referred to the ‘loathsome prison,’ to the\r\nmarshal as ‘a hard-hearted savage, who has, to the disgrace of\r\nFederalism, been elevated to a station where he can satiate his\r\nbarbarity on the misery of his victims.’ It was a faithful portrait. But\r\nin concluding, the article charged that the Administration had declared\r\nworthy of the confidence of the Government the Tories ‘who had shared in\r\nthe desolation of our homes and the abuse of our wives and daughters.’\r\n\r\nThus, one night there was a hammering on the door of Haswell’s house,\r\nand he was confronted by petty officials and notified to prepare for a\r\njourney to Rutland in the early morning. In feeble health, and\r\nunaccustomed to riding, he was forced to mount a horse for the\r\nsixty-mile ride to the capital. Through a cold October rain the sick man\r\njolted along in misery through the day, and it was near midnight when\r\nthe town was reached. With his clothing soaked, he begged permission to\r\nspend the night at a hotel where he could dry it. This was curtly\r\nrefused. At midnight they pushed the sick man in wet clothing into a\r\ncell. Responsible men of Rutland begged permission to go security to the\r\nend that the editor might spend the night in decent quarters--it was\r\ndenied. The next morning he was hurried to trial at Windsor before Judge\r\nPaterson who, on the Bench, continued to be a New Jersey politician. The\r\ndefense introduced evidence to prove the charge of brutality against the\r\nmarshal, and asked the Court for permission to summon McHenry and\r\nGeneral Drake of Virginia to prove that on one occasion the\r\nAdministration had acknowledged the policy of occasionally appointing\r\nTories to office. The Court refused permission; and having refused,\r\nPaterson declared in the charge that ‘no attempt had been made at\r\njustification’ of the reference to Tories. The jury was probably packed.\r\nThe verdict was promptly rendered--guilty of sedition. And Haswell was\r\nsent to jail for two months. On the day of the expiration of his\r\nsentence, a great throng assembled at the prison to testify to their\r\nregard for Haswell and their contempt for the Sedition Law and its\r\nsponsors. When the editor appeared at the door, the band played while\r\nthe crowd sang:\r\n\r\n    ‘Yankee Doodle, keep it up,\r\n     Yankee Doodle dandy.’\r\n\r\nIt was all too evident that, despite the Sedition Law, there were\r\n‘Yankee Doodles’ to ‘keep it up’ too numerous for the jails.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the law in Massachusetts offered comedy, tragedy, and\r\nfarce--with at least one hero among the victims. There was something of\r\npathos even in the farce. An illiterate and irresponsible soldier of the\r\nRevolution, David Brown, was wandering about the country reading and\r\ndistributing some foolish compositions of his own that were\r\nincomprehensible in their incoherency. It was possible to detect some\r\ndissatisfaction with the Administration, however. His was the grievance\r\nof many others of the ragged Continentals of the ranks. He was a\r\nDemocrat. Fisher Ames, who was not a soldier, though old enough to have\r\nbeen one, was outraged and alarmed over the foolish fellow’s activities,\r\nand pretended to believe that he was one of the Jeffersonian ‘runners\r\nsent everywhere to blow the trumpet of sedition.’ He wrote Gore, who had\r\ngrown rich buying up the paper of the private soldiers, of this\r\n‘vagabond ragged fellow, who lurked about in Dedham telling everybody\r\nthe sins and enormities of the government.’ Ames understood that he\r\n‘knew of my speculating connection with you;[1533] and how I had made my\r\nimmense wealth.’[1534] Finally he participated in the erection of a\r\nliberty pole at Dedham bearing among its inscriptions the sinister\r\nwords, ‘No Stamp Tax, No Sedition.’ The authorities pounced upon him as\r\nlegitimate prey.\r\n\r\nThe next scene was laid in the courtroom in Boston. On the Bench sat the\r\nfat, red-faced Chase, like an avenging angel who looked too often on the\r\nwine when it was red. It was solemnly proved that Brown had writings of\r\nhis own hostile to the Administration policies; that he had paid to have\r\nthe inscription painted for the pole at Dedham; and that in the presence\r\nof forty or fifty dangerous farmers he had been seen holding the ladder\r\nwhile another ascended to nail the board on. There was no defense. Chase\r\nglowered on the miserable illiterate, and, reminding him that he was at\r\nthe mercy of the Court, demanded the names of the miscreants who had\r\nsubscribed to his writings. Brown refused to betray the imaginary men\r\nhigher up, and Chase fined him four hundred dollars and sent him to jail\r\nfor a year and a half. Working entirely on his own initiative, the\r\nunhappy wretch was buried in a cell and all but forgotten. The\r\nFederalist papers recorded his conviction with gusto, albeit with sorrow\r\nthat such things could be. After sixteen months, he sent a pitiful\r\npetition to Adams asking for a pardon, but it was refused. In February,\r\n1801, he sent a second petition, which was ignored. After spending two\r\nyears in a cell, he was pardoned by Jefferson.[1535] This trial was a\r\nfarce.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFollowed then the comedy. Among the desperate characters who had\r\nassisted in the pole-raising at Dedham was Richard Fairbanks. A\r\nthoroughly decent citizen, he was arrested and dragged tremblingly into\r\ncourt. Most of the victims of the Sedition Law were unrepentant and\r\ndefiant, but Fairbanks was full of remorse. There may have been a bit of\r\ncunning in his confession of past wickedness and his profession of\r\nconversion. At any rate, the scene in court was not so threatening.\r\nTrue, the stern-faced Chase looked down from the Bench, but there in the\r\nroom, ready to plead for mercy, was Fisher Ames. The charge was read,\r\nconfessed, and up rose Ames. Not, however, as a paid attorney did he\r\nappear, but there was something to be said in extenuation for Fairbanks.\r\nHe realized ‘how heinous an offense it was.’ He had promised to be a\r\ngood citizen in the future. ‘His character has not been blemished in\r\nprivate life,’ the orator said, ‘and I do not know that he is less a man\r\nof integrity and benevolence than others. He is a man of rather warm and\r\nirritable temperament, too credulous, too sudden in his impressions.’ He\r\nhad been seduced by the ‘inflammatory sophistry’ of the illiterate\r\nBrown. ‘Besides,’ continued Ames, in his most virtuous tones, ‘men in\r\noffice have not been wanting to second Brown and to aggravate the bad\r\nopinion of the government and the laws.... The men who had Mr.\r\nFairbanks’ confidence and abused it are more blameable than he. A\r\nnewspaper has also chiefly circulated there which has a pestilent\r\ninfluence.’ Thus he had bad advice. ‘Although Mr. Fairbanks was\r\ninfluenced like the rest and was criminal in the affair of the sedition\r\npole he had no concern in the contrivance. He ... has freely confessed\r\nhis fault and promised to be in future a good citizen.’ Having attacked\r\nthe Jeffersonians in Congress and out, and denounced ‘The Aurora’ or\r\n‘Independent Chronicle,’ and implied that Fairbanks would vote and talk\r\nright in the future, Ames sat down; and just as solemnly Chase,\r\ncommenting that ‘one object of punishment, reformation, has been\r\naccomplished,’ fined him five dollars and sent him to jail for six\r\nhours. Whereupon we may imagine Chase and Ames felicitating themselves\r\non having scared the Democratic and Jeffersonian devils out of one\r\nsinner.\r\n\r\nThis was comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe tragedy in Massachusetts was reserved for a more important\r\nperson--the editor of the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ Thomas Adams, who was\r\nprinting one of the most powerful Jeffersonian papers in the country. He\r\nhad published an attack on the denunciation of the Virginia Resolutions\r\nby the Massachusetts Legislature.[1536] The Essex Junto had been seeking\r\na chance at the throat of the editor. His paper had been keenly searched\r\nfor some excuse for action under the Sedition Law. In the autumn of 1798\r\nhe had been arrested and the effect had been provoking. In announcing\r\nhis arrest, Adams had promised his readers a full report of the trial,\r\nand pledged himself to ‘always support the rights of the people and the\r\nliberty of the press, agreeable to the sacred charter of the\r\nConstitution.’[1537] When, four days later, he reported the postponement\r\nof his trial, he was able to ‘thank our new subscribers whose patriotism\r\nhas led them to support the freedom of the press since the late\r\npersecution.’[1538]\r\n\r\nThe political persecution of Adams had in no wise intimidated him. Every\r\nissue of his paper was a clarion call to the faithful. If anything, he\r\nraised his banner a little higher. The public, looking upon his arrest\r\nas tyrannical and outrageous, rallied around him as never before. Eleven\r\ndays after his arrest, he reported an ‘unprecedented increase in\r\ncirculation,’ and pledged himself to carry on the fight. Not without\r\npoint did he quote, ‘A free press will maintain the majesty of the\r\npeople,’ for, as he explained, ‘this was originally written by John\r\nAdams, President of the United States, for Edes and Gill’s Boston\r\nGazette when British Excises, Stamp Acts, Land Taxes, and Arbitrary\r\nPower threatened this country with poverty and destruction.’[1539]\r\nCourageous though he was, the persecution drained the editor’s weakened\r\nvitality, and he was confined to his bed in a country house near Boston\r\nwhen the attack on the Massachusetts Legislature was published. Though\r\ntoo ill to be dragged into court, he was not too ill to announce the\r\nsecond phase of the persecution in the language of defiance.\r\nDouble-spacing the announcement to make it stand out like a challenge,\r\nhe said: ‘The Chronicle is destined to persecution.... It will stand or\r\nfall with the liberties of America, and nothing shall silence its\r\nclarion but the extinction of every principle which leads to the\r\nachievement of our independence.’[1540] Because the editor could not be\r\ndragged from a sick bed, Abijah Adams, the bookkeeper, was arrested on\r\nthe ground that he had sold the papers and therefore published the\r\n‘libel.’\r\n\r\nChief Justice Dana presided at the trial--as intolerant, politically,\r\nbut not as stupid and coarse as Chase. The prosecution based its action\r\non the common law of England, which the defense declared inconsistent\r\nwith the Constitution of Massachusetts, and hostile to the spirit of the\r\nAmerican Government. Dana rose to the occasion, not only attacking\r\nAdams’s lawyers from the Bench, but assailing them through the\r\npress.[1541] The result was inevitable. A verdict of guilt was promptly\r\nreached, and Dana made the most of his opportunity in sentencing the\r\ncriminal. The defendant’s lawyers were denounced for ‘propagating\r\nprinciples’ as ‘dangerous as those of the article on which the\r\nindictment was based.’ Since the editor would not give up the name of\r\nthe author of the offensive article, Adams would have to suffer, and he\r\nwas sentenced to jail for thirty days, ordered to pay costs, and to give\r\nbond for good behavior for a year. So shocking was the spirit of Dana in\r\npassing sentence that he was challenged in the ‘Chronicle’ to publish\r\nhis speech.[1542] Adams editorially denounced the application of the\r\ncommon law of England as ‘inconsistent with republican principles\r\ncontemplated and avowed in our Constitution, and inapplicable to the\r\nspirit and nature of our institutions,’[1543] and promised ‘a regular\r\nsupply of the papers.’ ‘The Editor is on a bed of languishment, and the\r\nbookkeeper in prison, yet the cause of liberty will be supported amid\r\nthese distressing circumstances.’\r\n\r\nThe ‘convict’ was hurried off to jail, and into a damp, unhealthy cell\r\nwhere his feeble constitution threatened to succumb, until an indignant\r\nprotest from without forced the jailer to transfer him to a better. The\r\nfriends who flocked to see him were forced to convey their consolations\r\nthrough double-grated doors. Day by day the paper went to press, its\r\nspirit not one whit diminished. With the editor sinking under disease\r\nand the anticipated wreckage of his property, and the bookkeeper sick in\r\njail and distressed over the condition of his wife and children, the\r\nfight was waged with undiminished vigor.[1544] One day old Samuel Adams,\r\nhis Revolutionary spirit ablaze, flaunted his respect for the editor and\r\nhis contempt for the persecutors, by stalking to the jail and expressing\r\nhis admiration through the bars.[1545] That day Adams’s prison doors\r\nwere opened and he passed out to freedom; and the next day the readers\r\nof the ‘Chronicle’ knew that ‘Abijah Adams was discharged from his\r\nimprisonment after partaking of an adequate portion of his “birth-right”\r\nby a confinement of thirty days under the operation of the common law of\r\nEngland.’[1546] Within three weeks, Thomas Adams, one of the bravest\r\nchampions of democracy and the freedom of the press, was dead--his end\r\nhastened by the persecution to which he had been subjected. Like\r\nBenjamin Franklin Bache, he sank into his grave with an indictment under\r\nthe Sedition Law hanging over him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWhen Bache thus escaped the vengeance of his enemies, they turned to his\r\nsuccessor, William Duane, who soon proved himself a more vigorous\r\ncontroversialist than his predecessor. A remarkable character was Duane,\r\nentitled to a monument for his fight for the freedom of the press. Born\r\nin America of Irish parentage, he was taken to Ireland on the death of\r\nhis father, and there he grew to manhood. His career previous to his\r\nreturn to America was colorful and courageous. For a time he had been a\r\nreporter for the London ‘Times’ in the press gallery of the House of\r\nCommons, before establishing a newspaper in India which he edited with\r\nsuch signal ability that the East India Company found it advisable to\r\nresort to force and fraud to destroy his property and send him out of\r\nthe country. At length in sheer disgust he returned to America, and soon\r\nbecame the editor of ‘The Aurora.’[1547]\r\n\r\nOne Friday night before the Monday on which the question of the repeal\r\nof the Alien Law was to be considered in Congress, a number of citizens,\r\nincluding some foreign-born, met in Philadelphia to arrange for a\r\nmemorial to Congress. On Sunday morning, Duane and three others,\r\nincluding Dr. James Reynolds, appeared during services in the churchyard\r\nof Saint Mary’s Catholic Church with the memorial and a few placards\r\nrequesting natives of Ireland in the congregation to remain in the yard\r\nafter the services to sign the petition. Some of these placards were\r\nplaced on the church and on the gates leading into the yard. Some\r\nbelated worshipers of the Federalist persuasion tore these down, and,\r\nentering the church, warned the priest that seditious men were in the\r\nyard planning a riot. The four men in the yard conducted themselves with\r\nperfect decorum. When the congregation was dismissed, Duane and his\r\nparty had the memorial spread upon a tombstone. A few approached and\r\nsigned. Almost immediately, however, the terrorists among the members of\r\nthe church closed in upon the group, centering their attacks mostly upon\r\nReynolds, who was knocked down and kicked. Struggling to his feet,\r\nReynolds drew a revolver and prepared to defend himself, at which moment\r\nofficers reached the scene and the four men were hurried off to jail on\r\nthe charge of creating a seditious riot.\r\n\r\nBefore a great crowd at the State House, the trial was held, with\r\nHopkinson, the author of the war song, as special prosecutor, and the\r\nmen in the dock brilliantly defended by A. J. Dallas. The testimony\r\nshowed that there had been no disturbance until the mob charged upon the\r\nmen with the memorial; that the memorial itself was unexceptionable in\r\nevery way; that Reynolds had been warned a week before of a conspiracy\r\nto murder him and had armed himself on advice of a member of Congress;\r\nthat none of the others carried a weapon of any sort; and it was shown\r\nby the testimony of a priest that it was then the custom in Ireland to\r\npost notices in churchyards, and for members of the church to transact\r\nsuch public business in the yards after services. Members of the\r\ncongregation testified that they had wanted to sign; the priest that\r\nthe posting of the notice was not considered disrespectful to the\r\nchurch. In a brilliant speech of sarcasm and invective, Dallas riddled\r\nthe prosecution, calling attention to attempts to intimidate lawyers\r\nfrom appearing for the defense, charging the prosecution with being\r\ninspired by partisan hate, and denouncing the Alien Law. Hopkinson\r\nreplied lamely, attacking immigrants and Democrats. The jury retired,\r\nand in thirty minutes returned with a verdict of acquittal. The State\r\nHouse rang with cheers. The case, however, had not been tried in a\r\nFederal Court.[1548]\r\n\r\nThat, however, was only the beginning of the attempt to wreck and ruin\r\nthe leading Jeffersonian editor. John Adams and Pickering had been\r\nplanning to reach him by hook or crook. The latter wrote Adams that\r\nDuane, though born in America, had gone to Ireland before the\r\nRevolution; that in India he ‘had been charged with some crime’; and\r\nthat he had come to America ‘to stir up sedition.’ More--he was\r\n‘doubtless a United Irishman,’ and in case of a French invasion the\r\nmilitary company he had formed would join the invaders. The picture was\r\nas Adams would have had it painted. ‘The matchless effrontery of Duane,’\r\nhe wrote, ‘merits the execution of the Alien Law. I am very willing to\r\ntry its strength on him.’ This trial was never made, but two months\r\nlater the Federal Courts began to move against him. At Norristown,\r\nPennsylvania, with Bushrod Washington and Richard Peters on the Bench,\r\nan indictment was brought against him for sedition.[1549] The case was\r\ncontinued until June, 1800--and Duane went full steam ahead with his\r\nattacks on the Federalist Party. The trial was again postponed, and in\r\nOctober, 1800, he was indicted again--this time for having published a\r\nSenate Bill of a peculiarly vicious if not criminal character which its\r\nsponsors for sufficient reasons wished kept from the public. But it was\r\nof no avail. He would not cringe or crawl or compromise or be silenced.\r\nThe cases against him were dismissed when Jefferson became President.\r\nMany historians have belittled him; he fought brilliantly for\r\nfundamental constitutional rights when men high in office, who are\r\npraised, were conspiring to strike them down.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOne day the Sedition snoopers fell upon an article by Dr. Thomas Cooper,\r\nan Englishman by birth, a scientist and physician by profession, a man\r\nof learning and culture, and a Jeffersonian. It referred to the early\r\ndays of Adams’s Administration when ‘he was hardly in the infancy of\r\npolitical mistake.’ It charged Adams with saddling the people with a\r\npermanent navy; with having borrowed money at eight per cent; referred\r\nto his ‘unnecessary violence of official expression which might justly\r\nhave provoked war’; to his interference with the processes of a Federal\r\nCourt in the case of Robbins. And that was all. Adams had made mistakes,\r\nhad established a permanent navy, had borrowed money at eight per cent;\r\nand many thought at the time that he had unduly interposed in the\r\nRobbins case. But this was sedition in 1800.\r\n\r\nHustled into the Federal Court at Philadelphia, Cooper found the\r\nred-faced Chase glowering upon him from the Bench--the same Chase who\r\nhad been charged by Hamilton with speculating in flour during the\r\nRevolution. There was no denial of the authorship of the article. The\r\nevidence in, Chase charged the jury in his most violent partisan manner.\r\nThere are only two ways to destroy a republic, he said: one the\r\nintroduction of luxury, the other the licentiousness of the press. ‘The\r\nlatter is more slow but more sure.’ Taking up the Cooper article, he\r\nanalyzed it in the spirit of a prosecutor. Here, thundered the Judge, we\r\nhave the opinion that Adams has good intentions but doubtful capacity.\r\nBorrowed money ‘at eight per cent in time of peace?’ What--call these\r\ntimes of peace? ‘I cannot suppress my feeling at this gross attack upon\r\nthe President. Can this be true? Can you believe it? Are we now in time\r\nof peace? Is there no war?’[1550] The jury promptly returned a verdict\r\nof guilty. The next day Cooper appeared for sentence. Asked by Chase to\r\nexplain his financial condition as that might affect the sentence, he\r\nreplied that he was in moderate circumstances, dependent on his\r\npractice, which would be destroyed by imprisonment. ‘Be it so,’ he\r\ncontinued. ‘I have been accustomed to make sacrifices to opinion, and I\r\ncan make this. As to circumstances in extenuation, not being conscious\r\nthat I have set down aught in malice, I have nothing to extenuate.’\r\nChase became suspiciously unctuous and oily. If Cooper had to pay his\r\nown fine, that would be one thing; if his party had arranged to pay the\r\nfine, that would be another. ‘The insinuations of the Court are ill\r\nfounded,’ Cooper replied with indignation, ‘and if you, sir, from\r\nmisapprehension or misrepresentation, have been tempted to make them,\r\nyour mistake should be corrected.’ Judge Peters, who had been squirming\r\nthrough these amazing partisan comments of Chase, here impatiently\r\nintervened with the comment that the Court had nothing to do with\r\nparties. Whereupon Cooper was fined a thousand dollars and ordered to\r\njail for six months.[1551]\r\n\r\nDuane instantly announced an early publication in pamphlet form of the\r\ntrial in full. ‘Republicans may rest completely assured,’ he wrote,\r\n‘that they will have every reason to be satisfied with the effect of\r\nthis most singular trial on the mind of the public.’[1552] The pamphlet\r\nappeared, and, as Duane had foreseen, the public was aroused. A man of\r\ndecent character and high professional standing was languishing in a\r\njail in the capital of the country for having told the truth and\r\nexpressed an opinion on a constitutional question. There were rumblings\r\nand grumblings in the streets, and some uneasiness in Administration\r\ncircles. The hint went forth that an appeal for a pardon might receive\r\nconsideration, and one was put in circulation, when out from the\r\n‘convict’s’ cell came a letter of protest. He wanted and would have no\r\npetition for pardon. He believed with Adams that repentance should\r\nprecede pardon[1553] and he had no feeling of repentance. ‘Nor will I be\r\nthe voluntary cat’s-paw of electioneering clemency,’ Cooper continued.\r\n‘I know that late events have greatly changed the outward and visible\r\nsigns of the politics of the party, and good temper and moderation is\r\nthe order of the day with the Federalists now, as it has always been\r\nwith their political opponents. But all sudden conversions are\r\nsuspicious, and I hope that Republicans will be upon their guard against\r\nthe insidious or interested designs of those who may wish to profit by\r\nthe too common credulity of honest intention.’[1554]\r\n\r\nThe petition was dropped. Cooper remained happily in his cell. His\r\nincarceration was making votes for Jefferson. When, on the expiration of\r\nhis sentence, Cooper stepped into the daylight, he found a deputation of\r\nhis friends awaiting him at the door. He was escorted to a fashionable\r\nhotel where a public dinner had been arranged to honor him and express\r\ncontempt for the Sedition Law. Two long tables were set, with Dr. James\r\nLogan presiding over one, Thomas Leiper over the other. That night, as\r\nthe wine flowed, the men who would not be silenced drank to Cooper--to\r\nJefferson--to a Democratic victory.[1555]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nHaving distinguished himself as an American Lord Clare in the case of\r\nCooper, Chase proceeded southward, boasting along the way that he ‘would\r\nteach the lawyers in Virginia the difference between liberty and\r\nlicentiousness of the press.’ He was going to try James Thomas Callender\r\nfor sedition on an indictment based on his pamphlet, ‘The Prospect\r\nBefore Us.’ This unsavory creature was hated quite as much for the\r\ntruths he told as for the lies he circulated, and there was nothing in\r\nthe section of his pamphlet on which he was indicted to shock any one\r\nto-day. It was an attack on Adams in connection with the French war\r\nhysteria, the navy, the army, the Robbins case. The only phrase that\r\nstartles one to-day is the reference to the hands of Adams ‘reeking with\r\nthe blood of the poor friendless Connecticut sailor.’[1556] The scenes\r\nin the little Richmond courtroom were scandalous to excess. It was\r\nunderstood that Chase had instructed the marshal ‘not to put any of\r\nthose creatures called Democrats on the jury,’ and his boasts concerning\r\nVirginia lawyers had preceded him. The most brazen tyranny presided in\r\nthe case of Callender, and the lawlessness of the Judge was more\r\nthreatening than the licentiousness of the culprit. It was a political\r\ninquisition, not a trial. The courtroom was thronged. The case was the\r\nsole topic of conversation in the streets and taverns. The Democrats had\r\nno misapprehensions of the nature of the trial, and three\r\nextraordinarily able lawyers were there for the defense--John Hay, who\r\nwas afterwards to prosecute Burr, Nicholas, and William Wirt, already\r\nwell advanced toward that professional eminence which he so long\r\nenjoyed. There was a dignity and courage in the aspect of these three\r\nmen that Chase could only interpret as a challenge. He had made his\r\nboasts. He would teach these Virginia lawyers--and there was nothing\r\napologetic or fawning in the manner of Hay, Nicholas, or Wirt. The fact\r\nthat neither was there anything of insolence made matters worse. Feeling\r\nhimself on the defensive, Chase sought to conceal his embarrassment in\r\nthe brutality of his conduct.\r\n\r\nThe shameful story of that travesty of a trial has been often told, and\r\nit played a part in the impeachment proceedings against Chase a little\r\nlater. He stormed, fumed, spluttered, and injected Federalist stump\r\nspeeches into the ludicrous proceedings. He refused the defense\r\npermission to ask a prospective juror if he had formed and expressed an\r\nopinion on the Callender pamphlet. ‘The question is improper and you\r\nshall not ask it,’ he thundered. When John Taylor of Caroline was put on\r\nthe witness stand, Chase nervously demanded what the defense intended to\r\nprove by the witness. He was told. ‘Put the question in writing and\r\nsubmit it to me,’ he demanded. But why, asked Nicholas, when nothing of\r\nthe sort is required in questioning witnesses for the prosecution? ‘It’s\r\nthe proper procedure,’ fumed the Court. Keeping a firm rein on both his\r\ntemper and his contempt for the Court, Nicholas submitted three\r\nquestions in writing. One glance, and Chase ruled them out. The Virginia\r\nlawyers showed their amazement. Even Chase could see it. ‘My country has\r\nmade me a Judge,’ he shouted, ‘and you must be governed now by my\r\nopinion.’\r\n\r\nWilliam Wirt rose to submit an argument on the admissibility of the\r\nevidence. He began with observations on the embarrassments of the\r\ndefense because Callender had been ‘presented, indicted, arrested, and\r\ntried during this term and had not been able to procure testimony\r\nessential to a proper defense.’ He even hinted at the precipitancy of\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\n‘You must not reflect on the Court,’ shouted Chase.\r\n\r\n‘I am prevented from explaining to you [the jury] the causes which have\r\nconspired to weaken our defense, and it is no doubt right that I should\r\nbe prevented, as the Court has so decided.’\r\n\r\nChase saw at once that he was not going to care much for this ‘young\r\nman,’ as he contemptuously called him repeatedly. Wirt proceeded to an\r\nattack on the constitutionality of the Sedition Law.\r\n\r\n‘Take your seat, sir,’ stormed the livid-faced Chase. ‘Ever since I came\r\ninto Virginia I have understood that sort of thing would be urged, and I\r\nhave deliberated on it.’ Whereupon he produced a long manuscript and\r\nprepared to read. ‘Hear my words,’ he admonished, glaring around the\r\ncourtroom. ‘I wish the world to know them--my opinion is the result of\r\nmature reflection.’\r\n\r\nWirt undertook to argue the point--Chase gesticulated, stormed,\r\ninsulted--and William Wirt folded his papers, and resuming his seat\r\ndeclined to continue. Hay took up the argument, to be met constantly\r\nwith barking interruptions, until he, too, in sheer disgust, folded his\r\npapers and sat down.\r\n\r\n‘Please to proceed,’ urged Chase, wondering perhaps if he had gone too\r\nfar with these Virginia lawyers, ‘and be assured that you will not be\r\ninterrupted by me, say what you will.’ Hay refused to continue the\r\nfarce.\r\n\r\nThus, throughout, the mobbing of Callender and his attorneys went on.\r\nThe result was conviction and a jail sentence.[1557]\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a serio-comedy in New York State which was working\r\neffectively for the Democrats. In the early spring of 1800, John\r\nArmstrong, author of the ‘Newburgh Letters,’ and until this time an\r\nardent Federalist, outraged by the brazen attempt to suppress free\r\nspeech and the freedom of the press, prepared a powerful and\r\nvituperative petition for the repeal of the Sedition Law and sent it\r\ninto several counties to be circulated for signatures. In Otsego, then a\r\nnew and undeveloped part of the State, it was entrusted to Jedekiah\r\nPeck, an eccentric character known to every man, woman, and child in the\r\ncounty. Poor to poverty, he had combined the work of an itinerant\r\nsurveyor with that of a preacher, and was popular as both. Wandering\r\nthrough the country surveying land by day, night found him in some\r\nsettler’s home preaching and praying, and, in the intervals between, he\r\ntalked politics. He had baptized the infant, preached the funeral\r\nsermons for the dead, married the young, prayed for and with the old.\r\nHis sincerity was apparent, his innate kindliness manifest. Many smiled\r\nat the diminutive old man, but most men and all children loved him.\r\nBurr, who had a genius for using the right man in the right place, took\r\nhim up and had him sent to the Legislature as a Federalist.[1558]\r\n\r\nRight joyously the little old man started on his rounds with the\r\npetition. When his activity was made known to Judge William Cooper,\r\nfather of the novelist, and temperamentally as unfit for the Bench as a\r\nlarge number of the Judges of the time, he boiled with rage. Instantly\r\nhe wrote the District Attorney of Peck’s heinous sedition. Immediately a\r\ngrand jury was empaneled in the city of New York. A bench warrant for\r\nPeck’s arrest was issued. At midnight he was dragged from his bed,\r\nplaced in manacles like a dangerous criminal, and the two-hundred-mile\r\nmarch to New York began. The roads were bad, progress was slow, the news\r\nspread, and in every village and at every crossroads crowds poured forth\r\nto look upon the pitiful spectacle and to sympathize with the victim.\r\nJefferson could not have planned a more effective campaign tour. The\r\nplain people of the countryside knew Peck--and they turned away with a\r\nsense of personal outrage. For five days the march continued--it was a\r\ntriumphant march for democracy.\r\n\r\nThus the uneducated, itinerant preacher and surveyor of Otsego County\r\nmade his contribution to the election of Jefferson, marching in manacles\r\nto illustrate the Federalist conception of liberty.[1559]\r\n\r\nMerrily the Terror sped along.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe New London ‘Bee,’ under the editorship of Charles Holt, a\r\nJeffersonian, had greatly annoyed the Federalists of the surrounding\r\nStates, and a remedy was now at hand. Had it not attacked the French\r\nwar--and therefore tried to prevent enlistments? Here was sedition. The\r\neditor was arrested, his own brother summoned as a witness against him.\r\nThere was more than one War of the Roses in those days. The paper on\r\nwhich he was indicted was furnished by two Federalist editors, one of\r\nwhom had two brothers on the jury that brought in the indictment. The\r\nforeman of the grand jury was an Amos Bull who had been a British\r\ncommissary in New York during the Revolution.[1560] Bushrod Washington\r\npresided at the trial. The defense undertook to show the Sedition Law\r\nunconstitutional and the charges of the ‘Bee’ true. The friends of Holt\r\n‘had collected from Dan to Beersheba to hear the trial and afford aid\r\nand comfort to their brother.’ When he was quickly convicted and\r\nsentenced to jail for three months and to pay a fine of two hundred\r\ndollars, a Federalist paper smugly commented upon the ‘mildness of the\r\npunishment’ and ‘the humanity of the Judges.’[1561] Like the other\r\nvictims of the Terror, Holt took his punishment standing up, with\r\nshoulders thrown back. A few days before his trial he wrote boldly of\r\nthe things he had refrained from saying--‘the insults and threats\r\noffered to peaceable inhabitants and helpless women in the neighborhood,\r\nand the alarm and disturbance excited by firing in the streets and under\r\nthe windows at all hours of the night.’[1562]\r\n\r\nDuring the two years of the Terror the press was sprinkled with brief\r\nreports on arrests, mostly of Democratic editors. One at Mount Pleasant,\r\nNew York, was arrested ‘in the name of the President for reprinting a\r\nparagraph from the New Windsor Gazette supposed to be a libel against\r\nthe President,’ and he was forced to give bond for four thousand\r\ndollars.[1563] By November, 1798, it was announced that twenty-one\r\n‘printers’ had ‘fallen victims to the ... Sedition Law.’[1564] In\r\nenumerating the arrests that month, the ‘Chronicle’ commented that no\r\nFederalist editor was included ‘because they vilify none but Jefferson,\r\nLivingston, and Gallatin.’[1565] Everywhere men were being intimidated\r\ninto silence. Sometimes there was a touch of comedy to the Terror. One\r\npoor wight was dragged into court because of a comment, when a salute\r\nwas fired in honor of Adams, that it was a pity the ball did not find\r\nlodgment ‘in the seat of his pants.’\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, there was no serious attempt to make use of the Alien\r\nLaw. We have seen that about the time of its passage many Frenchmen\r\nchartered a boat to escape its operations, and America thus rid herself\r\nof the peril of Volney. General Victor Collot, an officer in the army of\r\nRochambeau, escaped deportation by leaving voluntarily. The only appeal\r\nto the Alien Law was by indirection in the case of John D. Burk, editor\r\nof the ‘Time Piece,’ a democratic paper in New York City. He had left\r\nhis native Ireland to escape the terror there under Pitt, and finally\r\nran foul of the law here by charging that a letter of Gerry to Adams,\r\nwhich the latter had sent to Congress, had been tampered with. The\r\nterrorists were not slow to act. When the offensive article stared at\r\nPickering through his spectacles, he wrote the District Attorney: ‘If\r\nBurk is an alien no man is a fitter object for the operation of the\r\nAlien Law. Even if Burk should prove to be an alien it may be expedient\r\nto punish him for his libels before he is sent away.’ He had already\r\nbeen arrested for sedition, however, and the prosecution was finally\r\ndropped on condition that he would leave the country. Instead of\r\nleaving, he went into hiding, only emerging from his obscurity with the\r\ninauguration of Jefferson.[1566]\r\n\r\nMany of the terrorists were infuriated by the failure to use the Alien\r\nLaw for wholesale deportations. ‘Why in God’s name is the Alien Law not\r\nenforced?’ wrote the intolerant Tracy to McHenry.[1567] Everywhere the\r\nSedition Law was keeping men ‘on the run.’ E. S. Thomas, learning that\r\nThomas Adams, of the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ had been arrested for the\r\npublication of an article by the former, fled to South Carolina just in\r\ntime.[1568] In the capital at Philadelphia, the Jeffersonians, fearing\r\nan attack, met in secret and made plans for defense. Moreau De Saint\r\nMerys, a scholarly Frenchman who kept a bookstore, was given keys to two\r\nhouses where he could take refuge should his own be attacked. He was\r\nquite incapable of anything that would have made him amenable to the\r\nlaw, and President Adams had not only lounged in his bookstore\r\nfrequently, but the two had exchanged copies of their books. Hearing\r\nthat Adams had written him down among the proscribed, Moreau appealed to\r\nSenator Langdon for the reason. ‘No reason,’ grunted Langdon, ‘beyond\r\nthe fact that you are French.’ Finally, thanks to the courtesy of\r\nListon, the British Minister, Moreau secured a passport and left the\r\nland of liberty with his books, maps, and papers.[1569]\r\n\r\nDrunk with hate and a sense of power, the terrorists were running amuck.\r\nAt a banquet at Hartford in July, 1799, they thrilled to the toast: ‘The\r\nAlien and Sedition Laws: Like the Sword of Eden may they point\r\neverywhere to guard our country against intrigue from without and\r\nfaction from within.’[1570] And every Democrat knew that ‘faction’ was\r\nthe Federalist name for party, and ‘party’ meant the Jeffersonians.\r\nArmed with the sword, the Federalists no longer bandied idle words. When\r\nGeorge Nicholas of Kentucky challenged Robert Goodhue Harper to a debate\r\nthrough the press on the Sedition Law, the latter was merely amused.\r\n‘The old proverb says, let them laugh who win; and for the converse of\r\nthe maxim the consolation of railing ought to be allowed to those who\r\nlose,’ jeered Harper.[1571] Why argue? The courts were busy silencing\r\nand jailing the Jeffersonians, suppressing free speech, striking down\r\nthe liberty of the press.\r\n\r\nWith the Democrats partly intimidated in the Eastern States, the honor\r\nof leading the fight against these laws was reserved for Virginia and\r\nthe frontier States of Kentucky and Tennessee. Here mass meetings were\r\nheld throughout the autumn of 1798. In Woodford County, Kentucky, it was\r\ndeclared ‘the primary duty of every good citizen to guard as a faithful\r\nsentinel his constitutional rights and to repel all violations of them\r\nfrom whatever quarter offered.’[1572] Four hundred gathered in Goochland\r\nCounty, Virginia, and, with only thirty opposed, denounced the laws and\r\ncalled upon the next Assembly to protest to Congress.[1573] At\r\nCharlottesville, at the foot of Monticello, the people of Albemarle\r\nCounty, Virginia, met to adopt resolutions of denunciation, and at\r\nLexington, Kentucky, they added their protest.[1574]\r\nRichmond--Knoxville--followed. These resolutions were dignified and\r\nforceful protests, sponsored by men of the first ability in the\r\ncommunities acting. But in the House of Representatives at\r\nPhiladelphia, when Jeffersonians spoke in favor of the repeal of the\r\nobnoxious measures, their voices were drowned by loud conversation,\r\ncoughs, laughter, the scraping of the feet of the Federalists.\r\n‘Livingston, however, attempted to speak,’ wrote Jefferson, ‘but after a\r\nfew sentences the Speaker called him to order.... It was impossible to\r\nproceed.’[1575] From 1798 until 1801, liberty was mobbed in America with\r\nthe zealous support of the Federal Courts, to the applause of the\r\nchurch--and out of these conditions came the Virginia and Kentucky\r\nResolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nOn the adjournment of Congress in 1798, Jefferson returned to his\r\nVirginia home profoundly impressed with the significance of the\r\nobnoxious laws. He had supposed that the freedom of speech and the\r\nliberty of the press had been guaranteed by the Constitution. That the\r\nfundamental law was outraged by these measures he had no doubt. It was\r\nhis firm conviction that they had been enacted ‘as an experiment on the\r\nAmerican mind to see how far it will bear an avowed violation of the\r\nConstitution,’ and that if it succeeded ‘we shall immediately see\r\nattempted another act of Congress declaring that the President shall\r\ncontinue in office for life.’[1576] He was not alone in this belief.\r\n\r\nOne day in the late summer a memorable conference was held at\r\nMonticello. There, in the center of the group, was Jefferson. There,\r\ntoo, was W. C. Nicholas, one of the foremost Jeffersonians of Virginia,\r\nand John Breckenridge of Kentucky, who had returned on a visit to his\r\nnative State. It does not appear that Madison participated in this\r\nconference, although he was in complete accord with its purpose. There\r\nthe plan was perfected to launch a movement of protest against the Alien\r\nand Sedition Laws through the Legislatures of the various States in\r\nresolutions pronouncing them violative of the Constitution and void.\r\nWhile Jefferson, recalling the occasion a quarter of a century later,\r\nthought that he had been pressed to frame such resolutions, it is\r\nunlikely that the plan did not originate in his own mind. He had an\r\nuncanny faculty for calling forth suggestions from others to meet his\r\nviews. On one point his memory was clear--there was to be the utmost\r\nsecrecy as to the part he played. That he did prepare a draft is\r\nthoroughly established; that the draft finally submitted to the Kentucky\r\nLegislature, while based on the Jeffersonian draft, was the work of John\r\nBreckenridge has been convincingly maintained.[1577]\r\n\r\nThis dashing young leader of the Kentucky Democracy had been a marked\r\nfigure from his earliest youth. More than six feet in height, spare and\r\nmuscular in build, with the strength and grace of carriage born of his\r\nwilderness training, he looked the leader of men. His hair, a rich\r\nchestnut tending to auburn, disclosed something of his ardent\r\ntemperament and was not unlike that of his idolized chief. His brown\r\neyes could be stern or tender. His address was easy and dignified, and\r\nhis manner not without that touch of gravity which creates confidence in\r\nthe follower. There was much of tenderness and everything of generosity\r\nin his nature to explain the love which enveloped him wherever he went.\r\n\r\nBorn of Scotch-Irish stock in Virginia thirty-eight years before, his\r\nhad been an extraordinary career. Scarcely was he out of college when,\r\nwithout any effort on his part, he was elected to the Virginia House of\r\nDelegates at the age of nineteen. When the House refused him his seat\r\nbecause of his age, his loyal constituents elected him again. Again\r\nrefused his seat, he was elected for the third time, and seated. During\r\nthe next five years he distinguished himself by his industry and ability\r\nno less than by the charm of his personality. It was about this time\r\nthat the young man ascended the hill to Monticello to sit at the feet of\r\nthe god of his idolatry. Jefferson was impressed by ‘the large scope of\r\nhis mind,’ his great store of information, and ‘the moral direction’ of\r\nhis ideas.[1578] There had to be something extraordinary in the man to\r\nwhom Gallatin looked a little later as the man best qualified to\r\ncontinue the work of Jefferson, Madison, and himself.[1579]\r\n\r\nAt the bar Breckenridge distinguished himself by his erudition, his\r\nindustry, and the fluency and force of his arguments, which were notably\r\nfree from the floridity then so popular in the South. Elected to\r\nCongress when thirty-three, he had abandoned his seat to remove to\r\nLexington, Kentucky, where he acquired a large plantation and settled\r\ndown to the practice of his profession. Almost immediately he was deeply\r\nengaged in politics. He was made President of the Democratic Society of\r\nKentucky and became one of the most engaging of the Democratic leaders\r\nof the pioneer State. Returning to Kentucky with the Jefferson draft, he\r\nmade some changes, and on November 8th presented the Resolutions to the\r\nLegislature. The debate was brief, and on the 10th they were adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Resolutions, written by James Madison after conferences\r\nwith Jefferson, were introduced in the Legislature of that State by the\r\ncelebrated John Taylor of Caroline. These, too, were speedily adopted\r\nafter a brilliant debate in which their sponsor and Giles crossed swords\r\nwith the eloquent George Keith Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of these Resolutions was to concentrate attention on\r\nthe Alien and Sedition Laws. They were to be sent to the Legislatures of\r\nall the States where they would be thoroughly discussed. Jefferson was\r\ntoo wise to have expected a favorable response from Legislatures\r\ndominated by the Federalists. But there would be debate, agitation,\r\nnewspaper controversy--the hated laws would have the searchlight turned\r\nfull upon them. Historians have been interested in these Resolutions\r\nbecause they set forth in the most impressive manner the compact theory\r\nof the Union on which the nullificationists and secessionists were to\r\nseize much later as justification for their course. We are interested\r\nhere in the contemporary view and the political aspect. The reader of\r\nto-day is apt to overlook the fact that they were primarily intended as\r\na protest against interference with the freedom of speech and the\r\nliberty of the press, and only ‘incidentally they gave expression to a\r\ntheory concerning the nature of the federal union.’[1580] That this was\r\nthe general contemporary interpretation is shown in the actions of the\r\nother Legislatures. Thus Maryland, Federalist, rejected the Resolutions\r\nas ‘highly improper’ because ‘a recommendation to repeal the Alien and\r\nSedition Laws would be unwise and impolitic.’[1581] Thus Delaware,\r\nFederalist, dismissed them as a ‘very unjustifiable interference with\r\nthe general government.’ Thus New Hampshire, Federalist, declared the\r\nobnoxious laws ‘constitutional and ... highly expedient.’ The\r\nFederalists of Rhode Island pronounced them ‘within the powers delegated\r\nto Congress and promotive of the welfare of the United States.’\r\n\r\nOnly in Massachusetts did the Federalists make a comprehensive and\r\nargumentative reply to the effect that the constitutionality of measures\r\ncould only be passed upon by the Supreme Court. The Alien and Sedition\r\nLaws were defended as in no wise interfering with the liberty of the\r\npress. And here, strangely enough, Democrats were found to support the\r\nResolutions in speeches of no mean merit. In John Bacon of Berkshire the\r\nJeffersonians had their sole representative in the State Senate.\r\nFormerly a minister of the Old South Church, and a speaker of some\r\nability, he delivered a carefully prepared speech assailing the\r\nconstitutionality of the oppressive laws, and gave it to the\r\npress.[1582] Dr. Aaron Hill of Cambridge, a Jeffersonian in the House,\r\nacted similarly in that body--and on both Hill and Bacon the floodgates\r\nof falsehood and abuse were opened. In an open letter to Bacon in the\r\n‘Centinel,’ he was charged with having been a Tory, with having\r\nquarreled with the congregation at the Old South, with having owned, as\r\nslaves, a married couple, and with having sold the husband into a\r\ndistant State.[1583] When Bacon proved the charges shamelessly false,\r\nthe ‘Centinel’ took no notice.[1584] Dr. Hill fared quite as badly when\r\nstudents from Harvard exercised their learning by smashing the windows\r\nand casements of his home.[1585] And it was at this juncture that Thomas\r\nAdams, of the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ was indicted and Abijah Adams was\r\nthrown into a cell for criticizing the action of the Legislature.[1586]\r\n\r\nEverywhere the Federalist papers made the Resolutions the occasion for a\r\njustification of the Alien and Sedition Laws; everywhere the\r\nJeffersonians, usually refraining from a discussion of the theory of\r\nthe Federal Union advanced, made them the pretext for a denunciation of\r\nthe laws. And significantly enough, it was reserved for the favorite\r\nFederalist organ of ‘Porcupine’ to preach and all but urge secession.\r\nReplying to a correspondent who had denied the right of secession,\r\n‘Porcupine’ said: ‘Does he imagine that the industrious and orderly\r\npeople of New England will ever suffer themselves to be governed by an\r\nimpious philosopher or a gambling profligate imposed upon them by\r\nVirginia influence? If he does, he knows very little of New England. The\r\nNew Englanders know well that they are the rock of the Union. They know\r\ntheir own value; they feel their strength, and they will have their full\r\nshare of influence in the federal government, or they will not be\r\ngoverned by it. It is clear that their influence must decrease; because\r\n... the Middle and Southern States are increasing in inhabitants five\r\ntimes as fast as New England is. If Pennsylvania joins her influence to\r\nthat of New England the balance will be kept up; but the moment she\r\ndecidedly throws it into the scale with Virginia the balance is gone,\r\nNew England loses her influence in the national Government, and she\r\nestablishes a Government of her own.’[1587] This reflects the spirit of\r\nthe times when the two parties faced each other for the decisive battle\r\nof 1800. The Alien and Sedition Laws and the Terror were issues; the\r\nKentucky and Virginia Resolutions played scarcely any part at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nADAMS PULLS DOWN THE PILLARS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Federalist leaders, having, as they thought, cowed and\r\ncrushed the Democrats, were engaged in an internecine strife for\r\ncontrol. There was to be war--at all hazards a war. It was to be a\r\nFederalist war, with Jeffersonians rigidly excluded from all places of\r\ncommand. But more than that, it had to be a war personally conducted by\r\nAlexander Hamilton--with no unseemly interference from John Adams. This\r\nwas the grim determination of the radical Federalists everywhere, even\r\nthe Essex Junto, in the President’s own State, sharing it with the three\r\nleading members of the Adams Cabinet. Thus, when Adams one day casually\r\nasked Pickering who should be made Commander-in-Chief of the army, and\r\nthe spectacled Puritan unhesitatingly answered, ‘Colonel Hamilton,’\r\nthere was an ominous silence. When, on another occasion, the same\r\nquestion elicited the identical answer, with a similar silence, even\r\nPickering must have sensed the situation. But when, after a third\r\nquestion had brought the same answer, and Adams, a little annoyed, had\r\nrejected the suggestion with the sharp observation, ‘It is not his turn\r\nby a great deal,’ Pickering might have dropped his plans without\r\ndisgrace.[1588] But nothing was more remote from his intentions. It was\r\nat this time that the conspirators, including the three members of the\r\nCabinet, put their heads together to devise ways and means of forcing\r\nthe appointment of their idol. The chief command would naturally be\r\noffered to Washington, who would accept the position in an honorary\r\nsense, but old age and infirmities would make his activities and\r\nauthority but perfunctory. The important thing was to secure the second\r\nposition for Hamilton--and even there was a rub. Adams was prejudiced.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, Adams ordered McHenry to Mount Vernon to proffer the\r\nchief command to Washington, with a request for advice in the formation\r\nof the officers’ list. The names of several eligibles for the leading\r\nposts, enumerated by Adams, might be mentioned. Hamilton was among them,\r\nbut he was fourth on the list. That day McHenry hastened to Pickering,\r\nand the conspiracy against the President in his own household began to\r\nunfold. It was agreed that Pickering should send a personal letter on\r\nahead urging Hamilton for second place, McHenry should reënforce\r\nPickering’s plea in person, Hamilton should be instantly notified and a\r\nletter from him should be delivered to Washington along with the\r\ncommission from Adams. Thus, when the smug-faced little War Secretary,\r\nmore familiar with the pen of the rhymester than with the sword of the\r\nsoldier, bade his chief adieu and set out upon his mission, he was the\r\nmessenger of his chief’s dearest enemy, prepared to exhaust his\r\ningenuity in thwarting the plans of the man of whom he was a subordinate\r\nand on whose mission he went forth.\r\n\r\nAs early as June, Washington had planned to make Hamilton\r\nInspector-General, but without placing him ahead of Pinckney or Knox,\r\nboth of whom outranked him in the old army.[1589] Just what treachery\r\nMcHenry practiced as he sat on the veranda at Mount Vernon those July\r\ndays will never be positively known. That he pleaded the cause of\r\nHamilton against the wishes of his chief there can be no doubt. That it\r\nwas he who suggested that Washington should make his own acceptance\r\nconditional on having absolute power in the selection of his\r\nsubordinates is more than probable. At any rate, when he returned to\r\nPhiladelphia he carried in Washington’s handwriting the names of the\r\nthree Major-Generals--Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in the order given.\r\nIn this order Adams, who assumed that their relative positions would be\r\ndetermined by himself, sent them to the Senate and they were confirmed.\r\n\r\nSoon the Federalist camp was in fermentation as to whether Knox, favored\r\nby the President, or Hamilton, preferred by the party bosses, should be\r\nsecond in command. Pinckney, who accepted slights with the same contrite\r\nspirit with which his brother had stepped aside for Jay in London,\r\nagreed to serve under the Federalist leader, but Knox, not so humble,\r\nrefused, and the crisis came. Personally fond of Knox, the quarrel was\r\nembarrassing to Washington, but it had never been the habit of the\r\nHamiltonians to spare him where their wishes were involved. Soon\r\nHamilton was bombarding Mount Vernon with letters strikingly lacking in\r\nthe spirit of humility. His claims were superior to those of Knox or\r\nPinckney, and the Federalists preferred him to the former.[1590] ‘If I\r\nam to be degraded beneath my just claims in public opinion, ought I\r\nacquiesce?’ he wrote the sympathetic Pickering.[1591] To McHenry he\r\nwrote that he would not surrender the first place to which he ‘had been\r\ncalled by the voice of the country’;[1592] to Washington that the\r\nFederalists of New England favored him over Knox.[1593]\r\n\r\nAll the while the three leading members of the Cabinet were concocting\r\nplans for the humiliation of Adams, taking their orders from Hamilton,\r\nwho, from his law office in New York, was directing the fight of the\r\nPresident’s trusted advisers against their chief. One day the angels\r\nlooked down and smiled through tears on the spectacle of McHenry writing\r\na letter to Knox fixing his status, from a model in the handwriting of\r\nAlexander Hamilton.[1594] As Adams stubbornly held his ground, one by\r\none all the Hamiltonians of consequence were drawn into the conspiracy\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nOne evening the secretarial conspirators sat about a table phrasing a\r\npersuasive note to Adams which Wolcott, the most consummate deceiver of\r\nthe three, should sign and send as his personal view. ‘Public opinion’\r\nfavored Hamilton, Washington preferred him, and ‘Knox [has] no popular\r\ncharacter even in Massachusetts.’[1595] Having dispatched this cunning\r\nletter, Wolcott immediately wrote his real chief in New York that\r\n‘measures have been taken to bring all right,’ and requesting Hamilton\r\nneither to do nor to say anything ‘until you hear from me.’[1596]\r\nAnother little caucus of conspirators in Boston: present, Cabot, Ames,\r\nand Higginson; purpose, the framing of a letter to Adams that Cabot\r\nshould sign, assuring the President of a ‘remarkable uniformity of\r\nsentiment’ in New England for Hamilton over Knox.[1597] Having sent this\r\nletter, Cabot wrote confidentially to Pickering suggesting that General\r\nWadsworth, who was ‘accustomed to tell [Knox] his faults,’ should be\r\nenlisted in the cause.[1598] Meanwhile Pickering, more sinister, if less\r\ndeceptive than the others, was seeking to intimidate his chief by having\r\nHamiltonian Senators declare that the officers had been confirmed with\r\nthe understanding that Hamilton stood at the head.[1599]\r\n\r\nAll this time, Iago-like letters were going forth from members of the\r\nCabinet to Washington conveying the impression that Adams was\r\ncontemptuously indifferent to the great man’s wishes. The effect was all\r\nthat could have been desired. In a surprisingly offensive note,\r\nWashington wrote peremptorily to the President demanding to know ‘at\r\nonce and precisely’ what was to be expected.[1600] Such a letter from a\r\nless popular idol would have elicited an answer sharp and decisive; but,\r\ntaking discretion for the wiser course, Adams swallowed his pride and\r\nwrote a conciliatory note, not neglecting, however, to remind the man\r\nwho had presided over the Constitutional Convention that under the\r\nConstitution the President, and no one else, ‘has the authority to\r\ndetermine the rank of the officers.’[1601] Thus the issue was closed,\r\nwith Hamilton triumphant, but with Adams awaiting only an opportunity\r\nfor revenge. The tiny cloud that had appeared in the beginning of the\r\nAdministration was now dark and large and threatening.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHaving won with Hamilton, the Federalist leaders now turned to another\r\npart of their programme--the rigid exclusion of Jeffersonians from\r\ncommissions in the army. This was to be a Federalist war, nothing less.\r\nEven Washington, who had, by this time, become a partisan Federalist,\r\nwas in sympathy with the view that the friends of Jefferson, Madison,\r\nHancock, and Sam Adams should be proscribed. This appears in his\r\nconsultations with John Marshall as to the personnel of the army,[1602]\r\nand in a letter to McHenry referring to the ‘erroneous political\r\nopinions’ of an applicant.[1603] This enlistment of Washington in the\r\nproscriptive policies of the Federalists is directly traceable to the\r\nIagos who were writing him all the while. Hamilton was solemnly assuring\r\nhim that the Democrats were ‘determined to go every length with France’\r\nand to ‘form with her a perpetual offensive and defensive alliance and\r\nto give her a monopoly of our trade.’[1604]\r\n\r\nThus one day Adams sat in conference with Washington on the organization\r\nof the army. Knowing Aaron Burr as a brave and able officer anxious to\r\nfight, he wished to recognize the Democrats by giving him a commission.\r\nWashington, much under the influence of Hamilton, conceded Burr’s\r\ncapacity, but opposed his appointment because he was a master of\r\nintrigue. Through the mind of Adams, hampered in his plans at every\r\nturn, flashed the vivid memory of how his predecessor had forced him to\r\nhumiliate his own friends in the appointment of Hamilton--‘the most\r\nrestless, impatient, artful, indefatigable, and unprincipled intriguer\r\nin the United States.’ But--as he afterward wrote--he was ‘not permitted\r\nto nominate Burr.’[1605] Here again the traitors in the Cabinet had\r\nplayed their part.[1606]\r\n\r\nBut the war was not to be national, but Federalist. ‘Every one of them\r\n[Democrats] ought to be rejected, and only men of fair property employed\r\nin the higher and more confidential grades,’ wrote a Federalist\r\nRepresentative to Wolcott.[1607] When Adams’s son-in-law applied for a\r\ncommission his application was held until he sent a certificate that he\r\nhad not interfered in a gubernatorial election in New York.[1608] So\r\nzealously did the minor politicians enter into this policy of\r\nproscription that some of the wiser leaders began to take alarm. Even a\r\nfriend of McHenry at Baltimore was moved to protest. ‘They seemed to\r\nimagine that nothing was left to be done but to exterminate every one\r\nwho had been on the Democratic side’ he complained.[1609] Even Hamilton\r\nfinally thought fit to call for a moderation of the programme. ‘It does\r\nnot seem advisable,’ he wrote McHenry, ‘to exclude all hope and to give\r\nto appointments too absolute a party feature.’[1610] But there was no\r\nrelenting in party circles, and no one had done more to arouse this\r\nfanatical spirit than Hamilton himself.\r\n\r\nThe climax of stupidity was reached in the case of Frederick A.\r\nMuhlenberg, former Speaker of the House, a leader and oracle among the\r\nGermans of Pennsylvania, but no blind follower of Federalism. In a\r\nspirit of pure patriotism he had personally offered the service of his\r\nsword to Adams, whose wish to accept it was again thwarted by\r\nWashington, acting under the inspiration of the Federalist leaders.\r\nWhereupon Muhlenberg marched with the Germans as a body into the\r\nJeffersonian camp and enlisted for another war.[1611]\r\n\r\nUnder this proscriptive program the Jeffersonians remained mute but for\r\na few sarcastic comments in their press. ‘General Washington must have\r\nsome very keen reflection,’ said the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ ‘in taking\r\ncommand of the army of the present day, in seeing so many new friends\r\nwho were his old enemies during the Revolution.’[1612] When it was\r\nreported that Robert Goodhue Harper had been made Commissioner-General,\r\nit chortled, ‘What lawyer would not plead for such a fee?’[1613] And it\r\nhad reflected on Adams’s ‘pretence’ for piety in connection with his\r\nappointment of Hamilton, ‘who published a book to prove that he was an\r\nadulterer.’[1614]\r\n\r\nBitter as were the reflections of Adams on reading such observations, it\r\ncould have mattered little to Hamilton. Everything he had started out to\r\nget he got. He wanted a war with France--and got it. He wanted the\r\ncommand directly under Washington as he had wanted nothing else in his\r\nlife--and got it, by striding to his sword over the humiliated pride of\r\nthe President. He wanted an army of fifty thousand men, and, if he fell\r\nshort in this, he nevertheless had an army. He was on the crest of the\r\nwave, the most powerful man in America, and he was happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFeeling that supreme fortune was within his grasp, Hamilton threw all\r\nhis enthusiasm and vitality into the task of perfecting the army and\r\norganizing the Nation for war. ‘The law has abandoned him, or rather he\r\nhas forsaken it,’ wrote a friend to King.[1615] Preparing the plan for\r\nthe fortification of New York Harbor, he personally superintended its\r\nexecution. He had worked out to the minutest detail the organization of\r\nthe army and all he lacked was men and a declaration of war. But alas,\r\nhe was confronted on every hand by disheartening difficulties. The\r\nrecruiting fell pathetically short of anticipations, the War Department\r\nunder the Secretary of his own choosing was pitifully inefficient, and,\r\nwhile the army was woefully below the provisions of Congress, even the\r\nfragment was not adequately clothed or provisioned, and there was a\r\ndeficiency of tents. In a rage, Hamilton wrote angrily to McHenry: ‘Why,\r\ndear friend, why do you suffer the business of providing to go on as it\r\ndoes? Every moment proves the insufficiency of the existing plan and the\r\nnecessity of auxiliaries. I have no doubt that at Baltimore, New York,\r\nProvidence, and Boston additional supplies of clothing may promptly be\r\nprocured and prepared by your agents, and it ought to be done, though it\r\nmay enhance the expense. ‘Tis terrible ... that there should be wants\r\neverywhere. So of tents. Calls for them are repeated from Massachusetts\r\nwhere better and cheaper than anywhere else they can certainly be\r\nprovided.’[1616]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the hysteria for getting at the throat of the French\r\ndemocracy was over almost as soon as it began, and the masses commenced\r\nto reflect on the cost, as the war measures grew apace. Jefferson,\r\nnoting the increasing boldness of opposition in Pennsylvania, where\r\npetitions were signed by four thousand people protesting against the\r\nAlien and Sedition Laws, standing armies, and extraordinary war powers\r\nfor the President, and observing similar unrest in New Jersey and New\r\nYork, and ‘even in New Hampshire,’ was fearful of insurrection. ‘Nothing\r\ncould be so fatal,’ he wrote. ‘Anything like force would check the\r\nprogress of public opinion.’[1617]\r\n\r\nWhen Wolcott tried to float a loan, he found the moneyed men cold to the\r\nregular legal rate of interest, for their patriotic passion had suffered\r\na chill when it came to cash. After all, business was business, and why\r\nshould the Federalist men of money fail to get in on the profits? It was\r\nnot hard to persuade Wolcott, who had a sentimental weakness for the\r\nfinanciers, and he could see nothing unreasonable in a demand for eight\r\nper cent. The rates for stocks were good, commercial prospects were\r\nalluring, and after all, eight per cent would be but ‘moderate terms.’\r\nAdams, sore from the unmerciful pummeling from his party, was outraged\r\nat such a rate,[1618] but Wolcott persisted--it was the only way. War\r\nwas war as business was business. Finally, in sheer disgust, Adams\r\ncapitulated to necessity with the exclamation: ‘This damned army will be\r\nthe ruin of this country; if it must be so, it must; I cannot help it.\r\nIssue your proposals as you please.’[1619] When Hamilton had urged that\r\nall the resources of revenue be seized upon, Adams thought him mad, but\r\nit soon became evident that something of the sort would be\r\nnecessary.[1620]\r\n\r\nAha, said the ‘Independent Chronicle,’ ‘“millions for defence but not\r\none cent for tribute.” This has been the language of those who are in\r\nfavor of war. The patriotism of such persons is every day becoming more\r\nand more evident. A loan of five million has been attempted, but instead\r\nof the old legal rate of six per cent these modern patriots have\r\nrequired the moderate premium of Eight. At this rate we shall soon\r\nverify the first part of the motto, viz., “millions for defence,” but\r\nwhether the latter is not violated by the extra interest is left to the\r\ndecision of those who are to bear the burdens.’[1621] And they who were\r\nto pay the piper gave an acquiescent nod.\r\n\r\nThe taxes which the war party had levied with such patriotic abandon\r\naroused bitter resentment. Among the Germans of Pennsylvania, the taxes\r\non houses, lands, and windows were considered the beginning of a system\r\nwhich would extend to everything. The immediate outcome was an\r\ninsurrection led by John Fries, an ignorant son of a German farmer, and\r\nthe marching of the troops and the easy dissipation of the incipient\r\nrebellion against the assessors.[1622]\r\n\r\nAbout that time Hamilton arrived in Philadelphia. ‘For what purpose?’\r\ninquired ‘The Aurora.’ ‘Can it be to foment another insurrection and\r\nthereby to increase the energies of the Government? What distinguished\r\ncitizen is there in the counties of Northampton and Bucks that he wishes\r\nto glut his vengeance upon? Does he wish that Easton may be burned to\r\nafford him a pretext for military execution?’[1623] If there were no\r\nexecutions, the people had a touch of military rule. A troop of horse\r\nfrom Lancaster committed outrages on citizens at Reading, and Jacob\r\nSchneider, a local editor, commented with severity upon their actions.\r\nOn their return through Reading these troops went to the editor’s\r\noffice, tore his clothing from his back, dragged him to the Market\r\nHouse, and were preparing to give him twenty-five lashes when troops\r\nfrom Philadelphia interfered.[1624] The brutality of the soldiers\r\nshocked the country. The prisoners taken on the expedition were treated\r\nwith the same unnecessary cruelty which marked the treatment of the\r\nrebels in the Whiskey Insurrection. Ignorant or besotted with partisan\r\npassion, under a lax discipline, and contemptuous of the civil\r\ngovernment, many soldiers strutting about in uniforms, insulting and\r\nattacking citizens, convinced the majority of the people that the\r\nJeffersonians were right in their observations upon the evils of\r\nstanding armies.\r\n\r\nNo one had denounced these excesses with greater vehemence than William\r\nDuane, editor of ‘The Aurora.’ One day some petty officers in uniforms,\r\nswords and pistols on their persons, said by Duane to have numbered\r\nthirty and by his enemies to have been fifteen, entered his office. With\r\ndrawn pistols the compositors and pressmen were driven into a corner and\r\nkept at bay by a part of the assailants. Some grasped and held Duane’s\r\nhands while others beat him over the head with the butt end of a pistol.\r\nThen with ten gallant soldiers participating in the assault on the one\r\nman, he was brutally dragged downstairs into Franklin Court, where the\r\nassault was repeated. He was knocked down and kicked. The editor’s\r\nrequest to be permitted to fight any one of them was ignored, and had\r\nnot his sixteen-year-old son thrown himself across his father’s body,\r\nand a number of Democrats arrived to give battle, he would have been\r\nmurdered in cold blood. That night armed Democrats went to the ‘Aurora’\r\noffice prepared to give shot for shot if an attempt should be made to\r\ndestroy the plant.[1625] ‘Porcupine’ chortled, and young Fenno declared\r\nthat ‘the punishment of this caitiff is of no more consequence than\r\nthat of any other vagabond.’ Besides, did not every one know that ‘the\r\ninfernal Aurora and the United Irishman who conducts it’ were ‘expressly\r\nchargeable with the Northampton Insurrection?’[1626]\r\n\r\nWith such encouragement from the organs of the Administration, these\r\noutrages by soldiers soon became commonplace wherever they were\r\nassembled, with uniformed ruffians swaggering down the streets pushing\r\ncivilians into the gutters, taking liberties with women, picking\r\nquarrels while drunk, and slashing and lunging with dirk and\r\nsword.[1627] This bullying spirit affected the petty officers and\r\nreached a climax when civil officials, armed with a warrant for a thief\r\nwho had escaped to the soldiers near Philadelphia, were literally kicked\r\nout of the camp, their warrant cursed and trampled.[1628] With the tide\r\nrising rapidly against both the war and the army, the recruiting lagged.\r\nAdams in later years recalled that the army was as unpopular ‘as if it\r\nhad been a ferocious wild beast let loose upon the nation to devour\r\nit.’[1629] With the recruiting officers putting forth their utmost\r\nefforts, ‘with all the influence of Hamilton, reënforced by the magical\r\nname of Washington,’ they were unable to ‘raise one half of their ...\r\nlittle army.’[1630] Duane wrote that before the law creating the army\r\npassed ‘there were 15,000 applications for commissions--since the\r\npassing of the law there have been only 3000 soldiers.’[1631] There is\r\nmore than a touch of irony in the fact that while the Administration\r\npapers were vilifying the Irish, ‘three fifths of the men enlisted were\r\nIrish immigrants.’[1632]\r\n\r\nBut there was another reason for the failure in recruiting--the people\r\nsoon concluded that some one had cried ‘wolf’ when there was no wolf. No\r\none, including Hamilton, believed that France had the most remote notion\r\nof warring on the United States. The impression grew that the army was\r\nintended for purposes other than the protection of the country from a\r\nforeign foe. Meanwhile, the taxes were bearing hard, the national debt\r\nwas mounting and the passion for peace returned. Right gallantly the war\r\nparty sought to reawaken the fine frenzy of the hysterical days of the\r\nX Y Z papers. The preachers were as distressed over the possibility of\r\npeace as the politicians, and a convention of ministers in Boston issued\r\na war cry. ‘You will see by these things that the clergy are not asleep\r\nthis way,’ wrote a Massachusetts man to Wolcott. ‘They ought everywhere\r\nto be awake.’[1633] From the New York ‘Commercial Advertiser’ came a\r\npathetic attempt to sweep back the rising tide for peace: ‘The necessity\r\nin times like the present in cherishing the war spirit ... is\r\nevident.’[1634] Apropos of the report that the French were ready to make\r\nevery concession to our interest and pride, the ‘Centinel’ in Boston\r\nsent forth the warning, ‘The trying time is now approaching’;[1635] but\r\nthe rabble, as the masses were called, could see nothing distressing in\r\nwinning a war without the loss of a drop of blood. Fenno’s ‘Gazette,’\r\ncommenting on the business stagnation, promised that ‘a war with France\r\nwould within two months revivify every department of society, commerce\r\nwould be invigorated, the funds would rise, and every employment of life\r\nwould receive new vigor.’[1636] This sordid note he was soon to strike\r\nagain.[1637] But it was all unavailing. The enlistments dwindled to\r\nnothing, common soldiers were actually cheering the Democratic Governor\r\nin the streets of Philadelphia, no one feared an invasion, and, as\r\nWolcott confided to Fisher Ames, ‘no one has thought it prudent to say\r\nthat the army is kept to suppress or prevent rebellions.’[1638] To make\r\nmatters all the worse, desertions multiplied until the harassed McHenry\r\nwas writing Hamilton urging executions. The little rhymester was far\r\nbeyond his depths, scolded by Washington, kicked like a flunky by\r\nHamilton in one or two letters a day. But the idea of shooting a\r\ndeserter was a bit too high-toned for Hamilton. ‘There must be some\r\ncaution,’ he wrote, ‘not to render our military system odious by giving\r\nit the appearance of being sanguinary.’[1639] Adams was prepared for\r\nextreme measures, but it was decided to leave the decision with Hamilton\r\nand McHenry--which meant with Hamilton. ‘If the virtuous General\r\nHamilton is determined upon shooting every soldier who deserts,’ said\r\n‘The Aurora,’ ‘Billy Wilcox’s court martial will be kept at pretty\r\nconstant duty. In a Daily Advertiser of last week no less than ten of\r\nthese strayed gentlemen are advertised for apprehension at $10 a\r\nhead.’[1640]\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton was too wise to shoot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe war cry was sinking to a hoarse whisper when Dr. James Logan, who\r\nhad entertained the Washingtons, and who was a follower of Jefferson,\r\nquietly slipped out of Philadelphia one day and sailed for France--and\r\nthe war hawks were in a frenzy. When Logan, at his own expense and\r\nwholly on his own volition, went to Paris, it was to determine the state\r\nof the public mind there for himself. He was a leading citizen, his\r\nfamily familiar to society, his home one of the most cultured in the\r\ncommunity, and, aside from being a friend of the French democracy, he\r\nwas a Quaker and an enemy of war. He felt that the country had been\r\ndeceived by war propaganda, and he determined to find out for himself.\r\n\r\nThe war wing of the Federalist Party knew that an investigation in Paris\r\nwas the one thing they could not afford. No one knew better that war was\r\nunnecessary and that the French were ready if not eager to recede.\r\nHarrison Gray Otis knew it best of all because his fellow Federalist of\r\nBoston and classmate, Richard Codman, was writing him from Paris of the\r\nFrench disposition for peace and conciliation. But this was being\r\ncarefully concealed from the American people. Thus, when Logan sailed it\r\nwas clearly the cue for the war party to hint darkly of weird\r\nconspiracies with the French and a factional embassy from the Democrats.\r\nSoon Harper, who had a supersensitive nose for conspiracies and treason,\r\nwas hinting mysteriously on the floor of the House of a traitorous\r\ncorrespondence between the French Directory and the Jeffersonian Party.\r\nThe truth is that, when Logan foolishly made a mystery of his departure\r\nand almost surreptitiously stole out of Philadelphia, he carried letters\r\nfrom Jefferson and Governor McKean. Four or five days before his\r\ndeparture he had informed Jefferson of his purpose and asked for letters\r\nof introduction and a certification of his citizenship. It was not a\r\nsecret that Jefferson was opposed to a preventable war, but no\r\ninstructions were given the Doctor, no communication was sent by\r\nJefferson, and there was no conspiracy at all.[1641] Thus, on his own\r\nvolition Logan went to Paris, talked with Otis’s Federalist friend\r\nCodman and other Americans, conversed with leading Frenchmen, dined with\r\nMerlin, met Talleyrand, and ascertained, as he had expected, that peace\r\ncould be preserved with honor. A simple, honest man, with none of the\r\ncrooked mental twists of the professional politician, he returned with\r\nthe confident expectation that the President and his advisers would be\r\nglad to get the benefit of his observations. He reached Philadelphia to\r\nfind himself the object of immeasurable abuse.\r\n\r\nNot doubting that Pickering would be glad to have his impressions, Logan\r\nwent first to him. This was, in truth, a ludicrous performance, and a\r\nFederalist paper was moved to mirth because he had ‘actually unfolded\r\nhis budget to Pickering’ and ‘needless to say’ returned ‘with a bug in\r\nhis ear.’[1642] Going on to Trenton, the temporary seat of government,\r\nhe saw Washington, to be received with more than his customary coldness.\r\nHe had a message from Lafayette to Washington. ‘Aye,’ said the General.\r\nAnd one from Kosciusko. ‘Aye,’ said Washington. Whereupon Logan\r\ncourteously proffered him the use of his home, which the Washingtons had\r\noften found agreeable, while in Philadelphia, to have his offer curtly\r\ndeclined. Even Pinckney haughtily refused the use of Logan’s carriage\r\nwhen the General was seeking a conveyance to the capital. ‘This fellow\r\nLogan had the unparalleled effrontery to offer the General a seat in his\r\ncarriage,’ sneered a war paper.[1643] Some historians insist that Adams\r\ntreated him contemptuously, and this seems probable in the light of the\r\nlatter’s letter to Pickering,[1644] albeit Gibbs records that Adams was\r\nmuch impressed with Logan’s story and with his sincerity and\r\ncandor.[1645] The letter was written to Pickering, however, before the\r\ninterview was granted.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met, Logan found himself the subject of a bitter debate\r\nbrought on by the introduction of the so-called ‘Logan Law’ prohibiting\r\nunofficial meddling in international affairs. Harper had followed his\r\ncue and found his conspiracy. Logan had actually presented a paper to\r\nthe Directory as from one having authority. The story was all too thin,\r\nthe facts too badly twisted, and the Jeffersonians under the leadership\r\nof Gallatin showed their teeth. The climax came when Harper read the\r\npaper which Logan was presumed to have presented. Then, through frank\r\nletters in ‘The Aurora,’ Logan brought out the truth to the discomfiture\r\nof the war hawks. In view of the scurvy treatment he has received, his\r\nown statement is one of value. He had been met at Hamburg by Lafayette,\r\nwho had furnished him with the means to proceed to Paris. There he found\r\nnegotiations at an end. Knowing no law, ‘moral or political,’ that\r\nprevented him from serving his country, he had sought interviews with\r\nleading characters and found France anxious for peace. Whereupon he had\r\nsuggested the lifting of the embargo on American shipping detained in\r\nFrench ports and the release of American sailors held prisoners. He had\r\nnot gone to Paris ‘at the direction or on the request or on the advice\r\nof any person whatever.’ He went for his own pleasure, on his own views,\r\nand at his own expense.[1646] Not only had the memorial Harper had read\r\nto the house not been presented by him, it had not been written by him,\r\nbut by a good Federalist who was an intimate friend and correspondent of\r\nHarrison Gray Otis, and he had refused the request to present it on the\r\nground of its ‘having too much the appearance of an official act.’[1647]\r\nThe absolute veracity of this story was known to Otis, who was intimate\r\nwith Harper, for he had a letter from Codman in verification, and to the\r\neffect that Logan had told Talleyrand that in the event of war all\r\nparties in America would rally around the Government ‘and oppose all its\r\nenemies.’[1648]\r\n\r\nThus there was a conspiracy, a peculiarly ugly conspiracy, of the war\r\nhawks to ruin an honest, patriotic, if Quixotic man because of his\r\ninterference with their plans to manufacture a needless and therefore a\r\ncriminal war.\r\n\r\nBut there was a special reason for the war party’s rage over Logan.\r\nAbout this time Elbridge Gerry, one of the three envoys, who had stayed\r\nover in Paris on the invitation of Talleyrand, had returned with a\r\nsimilar story. The Federalists had been outraged by his failure to leave\r\nwith his colleagues, and on his return to his home in Cambridge he\r\nfound himself socially ostracized. Adams, who was his friend, had\r\nseverely condemned him for continuing his conferences in Paris.[1649] So\r\nbitter was the feeling against him, that the war party did not scruple\r\nto terrorize his family in his absence. His wife received anonymous\r\nletters charging that a woman was responsible for his lingering in\r\nParis. With only women and children in his house, their nights were made\r\nhideous with yells and bonfires under their windows; and one morning\r\nMrs. Gerry looked out of the window on a miniature guillotine smeared\r\nwith blood. On his return, Gerry had gone to Philadelphia and left his\r\ndispatches, which Pickering had published with his intemperate comments.\r\nThe Federalists were well pleased with Pickering’s excoriation.\r\n\r\nAnd Jefferson? So different was his conception of public opinion that he\r\nwas delighted. Seizing upon the Gerry correspondence as a complete\r\nanswer to the X Y Z papers, he wrote Edmund Pendleton that it was too\r\nvoluminous for the masses, and urging him to prepare ‘a capitulation ...\r\nstating everything ... short, simple, and leveled to every capacity ...\r\nso concise, as, omitting nothing material, may yet be printed in\r\nhandbills, of which we could print and disperse ten or twelve thousand\r\ncopies under letter covers, through all the United States by the members\r\nof Congress when they return home.’[1650]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gerry had hastened to Quincy, and in the rambling frame house\r\nof the President was going over the situation with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe restoration of peace with France would mean the end of the army\r\ncreated with so much expense and trouble. So determined were the\r\nHamiltonians on war that they were ready to wreck the Federalist Party\r\non the issue. Many explanations have been offered. Wolcott had hinted in\r\nhis letter to Ames that an army was wanted for domestic use.[1651] That\r\nwas the common charge of the Democrats. That there was another and more\r\nportentous reason we may be sure, albeit the public, and even John\r\nAdams, was ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nAt that time a queer little Latin-American soldier of fortune, Francesco\r\nde Miranda, was living in London, playing about Downing Street, and\r\nconferring with Rufus King, the American Minister, who, next to Morris,\r\nwas the ablest of Hamilton’s lieutenants. There was a possibility that\r\nat any time England might be forced to war on Spain should that country\r\nenter into the struggle on the side of France. The United States was\r\nthen engaged in a quarrel with Spain. It was the idea of Miranda to\r\nenlist England and the United States in a grand revolutionary scheme in\r\nSouth America. He had discussed it with the British Ministers and with\r\nKing, who was in correspondence with Hamilton. It involved an alliance\r\nbetween the English-speaking countries. This had been hinted at, as we\r\nhave seen, long before, by Hamilton in a letter to Pickering, who was in\r\nfavor of entering into such an alliance without delay. It was the plan\r\nof Miranda for England to furnish the ships, not exceeding twenty, men\r\nand money; the United States to supply no less than seven thousand\r\nsoldiers, two thousand of these being cavalry. The lure of Florida and\r\nCuba was held out to the United States.[1652] Here was a grand scheme of\r\nconquest that appealed irresistibly to Hamilton’s ambition for military\r\nglory.[1653] Entirely unknown to Adams or Washington, Hamilton had been\r\nin correspondence with the soldier of fortune, and in communication with\r\nhim through King who was managing the London end of the affair. He made\r\nit plain to King that in the event of a successful issue he would want\r\nthe United States to be the principal agency. ‘The command in this case\r\nwould very naturally fall upon me, and I hope I should disappoint no\r\nfavorable anticipations,’ he wrote. He thought the country not quite\r\nripe for the enterprise, but ‘we ripen fast, and it may, I think, be\r\nrapidly brought to maturity if an efficient negotiation for the purpose\r\nis at once set on foot.’[1654] To Miranda he was writing that he would\r\nnot embark in the affair ‘unless patronized by the Government of this\r\ncountry.’ An army of twelve thousand men was being raised. ‘General\r\nWashington has resumed his station at the head of our armies, I am\r\nsecond in command.’[1655] In the autumn of 1798, he was writing Senator\r\nGunn on the importance of heavy cannon for fortifications and mortars\r\nin the case of a siege. ‘If we engage in war our game will be to attack\r\nwhere we can. France is not to be considered as separated from her ally.\r\nTempting objects will be within our grasp.’[1656] In January, 1799,\r\nHamilton was writing Otis in the same strain. ‘If universal empire is\r\nstill to be the pursuit of France, what can tend to defeat that purpose\r\nbetter than to detach South America from Spain.... The Executive ought\r\nto be put in a situation to embrace favorable conjunctures for effecting\r\nthat separation.’[1657] With all this Pickering was familiar and in\r\nsympathy, but Adams was in total ignorance. In time the subject was\r\ncautiously broached to him, to be rejected with the curt notation that\r\nwe were not at war with Spain. But the record is too clear to leave the\r\nSouth American project out of consideration in seeking the reason for\r\nthe intense desire for war--and a large army. Through all this period,\r\nHamilton had visions of himself on horseback, at the head of troops in\r\nSouth America, with England as an ally.[1658]\r\n\r\nNever had Hamilton felt himself so near the top of the world. When\r\nCongress met in the fall of 1798, he had a plan ready for a complete\r\nchange in the formation of the Nation. This provided for eighty United\r\nStates District Courts;[1659] the division of old States into new ones\r\nfor any territory having as many as 100,000 people on the request of any\r\nconsiderable number--which would or could have made seven States out of\r\nVirginia; and for the extension and more rigid enforcement of the\r\nSedition Law.\r\n\r\nIt was on this state of affairs that Adams, perplexed, harassed, worried\r\nby the serious illness of Abigail, aching under the humiliations visited\r\nupon him by the bosses of his party, meditated during the summer and\r\nearly fall of 1798. And he thought seriously, too, on what Gerry had\r\ntold him of the temper of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThis had almost persuaded him that a new mission to France was feasible,\r\nwhen a letter from Murray at The Hague, indicating uneasiness in Paris\r\nlest the United States be forced into an alliance with England,\r\nconvinced him. Thus, about the middle of October, in a letter to\r\nPickering, he submitted two questions for the consideration of the\r\nCabinet. ‘Should there be a declaration of war?’ ‘Could proposals for\r\nfurther negotiations be made with safety, and should a new envoy be\r\nnamed, prepared to sail on assurances that he would be received?’\r\n\r\nThat letter fell like a bomb in the camp of the war conspirators. How\r\nPickering must have scowled, and McHenry grumbled, and Wolcott shrugged\r\nhis shoulders with a cynical grin when they sat down to meditate on its\r\nmeaning. That more important personages were informed we may be sure. To\r\nthat note, however, the Cabinet did not deign to reply. Had not Adams\r\ndeclared that he would never send another envoy unless solemnly assured\r\nthat he would be received? No such assurance had come. Then why discuss\r\nit--even on the request of the President? However, a Message would have\r\nto be sent to Congress, and with Adams in a conciliatory frame of mind\r\nit was imperative that something definite await him on his arrival. Thus\r\nthe conspirators sat down to the framing of a Message that would defeat\r\nthe very purpose the letter had indicated. Hamilton and Pinckney were\r\nsummoned to the conference. The result was a paragraph putting it\r\nsquarely up to France to take the initiative in the matter of a renewal\r\nof negotiations. Wolcott, who, better than any of the others, could hide\r\nhis treachery behind an ingratiating urbanity, was put forward as the\r\nauthor. Reaching the capital, Adams summoned his Cabinet to go over the\r\nMessage. All went well until the fateful paragraph was reached, and\r\ninstantly the keen eye of the suspicious old man caught its full\r\nsignificance. That, he would not accept, and an open struggle began.\r\nWith earnestness and even heat the obnoxious paragraph was urged upon\r\nhim, but Adams planted his feet and stood. He would rewrite that\r\nparagraph to conform to his personal view of the proprieties.[1660]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet conspirators retired with the realization that there were\r\ndark days ahead. Adams in his substitute held forth the olive branch to\r\nthe extent of declaring that no new envoy would be sent unless\r\nassurances were forthcoming that he would be properly received.\r\nWashington, Hamilton, and Pinckney, in uniforms, sat in the chamber\r\nwhen the Message was read. Two of these, at least, had grave\r\nforebodings. Then it was that the conspirators determined to override\r\nAdams by meeting his plan for negotiations with an immediate declaration\r\nof war. A caucus of the Federalists was called. The most brilliant and\r\nfiery orators were primed for the occasion. The proposal was made and\r\nsupported with eloquence. The vote was taken, and by a small majority\r\nAdams triumphed over his foes. This was the most significant incident\r\nyet--it meant that Hamilton had lost control of the party\r\ncouncils.[1661] With that knowledge, Pickering made no further attempt\r\nto conceal his bitter hostility to his chief. Ordered to prepare a\r\ntreaty that would be acceptable, he ignored the request. Asked to\r\nmoderate his report on the Gerry dispatches, he refused. Among his\r\nassociates he was bitterly resentful, and all this was carried to the\r\nPresident, who cunningly simulated ignorance of what was happening.\r\nThen, at length, came the desired assurances from Talleyrand, that an\r\nenvoy would be ‘received as the representative of a great, free,\r\npowerful, and independent nation.’ That was enough. Adams was ready for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThus, without further warning to the Cabinet, a messenger from the\r\nPresident appeared in the Senate on February 18th with the nomination of\r\nMurray as Minister to France. The Federalists were paralyzed. Jefferson,\r\nequally amazed, managed to conceal his pleasure over the evident\r\ndiscomfiture of his foes.[1662] Almost a week later he still suspected\r\nthat the nomination had been sent ‘hoping the Federalists ... would\r\naccept the responsibility of rejecting it.’[1663] But the Federalist\r\nSenators had no such suspicion. Their faces betrayed their indignation.\r\nThat night they met in caucus with their war paint on, and the decision\r\nwas reached to defeat the confirmation. They still had the whip hand. If\r\nAdams would modify in some way--At any rate, he should remain in no\r\ndoubt as to their opinion of his action. A committee, consisting of\r\nBingham, Read, Sedgwick, Ross, and Stockton, was named to wait upon him,\r\nand a note was sent requesting an audience. The reply left them in no\r\ndoubt as to the fighting mood of the man they sought to intimidate. He\r\nwould be very glad to receive them ‘as gentlemen, at his house, at\r\nseven in the evening.’ At the appointed hour they were ushered into the\r\naudience room. No one was there. Then the door opened, and Adams, the\r\npicture of dignity on short legs, entered.\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen, I am glad to see you as friends and Senators; but as a\r\ncommittee interfering, as I think you are, with my executive duties, I\r\ncannot consent to receive you, and I protest against all such\r\ninterference. I have a duty to execute, and so have you. I know and\r\nshall do mine, and I want neither your opinion nor aid in its\r\nexecution.’\r\n\r\nAt which he politely asked them to be seated.\r\n\r\nNot a little nonplussed by his masterful manner, Bingham apologetically\r\nexplained that there was no thought of interference, but merely a\r\ndisposition to reconcile differences of opinion.\r\n\r\n‘Well, then, gentlemen,’ snapped Adams, ‘if you are determined to\r\ninterfere in diplomatic matters, reject Mr. Murray. You have the power\r\nto do this, and you may do it; but it will be upon your own\r\nresponsibility.’\r\n\r\nAs mildly as possible it was suggested that Adams’s action, so soon\r\nafter the insult, would be interpreted as a humiliation.\r\n\r\n‘I know more of diplomatic forms than all of you,’ Adams hotly replied\r\nwith perfect truth. ‘It was in France that we received the insult, and\r\nin France I am determined that we shall receive the reparation.’\r\n\r\nForced to compromise, a commission was then suggested.\r\n\r\n‘Who would you have me send?’ Adams demanded, an ugly expression on his\r\nface. ‘Shall I send Theophilus Parsons, or some of your other Essex\r\nrulers? No, I will send none of them.’\r\n\r\nAt this the committee showed its teeth with the threat to defeat the\r\nconfirmation. Adams, infuriated by the threat, replied that there was a\r\nparty determined to rule him, but that they would fail.[1664]\r\n\r\nThat night when the caucus met again, it was decided to reject the\r\nnomination. Meanwhile, the effect outside the Senate was quite as\r\nsensational. Duane announced the nomination the day after it reached the\r\nSenate, in large type. The next day ‘Porcupine’ fired a broadside.\r\n\r\n‘For the last two days,’ he said, ‘there has been a most atrocious\r\nfalsehood in circulation ... that the President ... has intimated by a\r\nmessenger to the Senate that he has resolved on sending another\r\nplenipotentiary to treat with the French Republic. Every one must\r\nperceive the falsehood on the front of this; yet have audacious wretches\r\ndared to promulgate it without hesitation and they have even named the\r\nplenipotentiary, Mr. Murray.... I will not expatiate upon the\r\nconsequences of such a step ... because I cannot suppose the step within\r\nthe compass of possibility; but I must observe that had he taken such a\r\nstep it would have been instantaneously followed by the loss of every\r\nfriend worth preserving.’[1665] Encouraged by the applause of the\r\nFederalists, he recurred to it the next day with a denunciation of ‘a\r\nmere fabrication intended to alienate the President’s friends ... at\r\nthis momentous crisis and sink his character in the eyes of all Europe\r\nand America.’[1666] But two days later, the ferocious ‘Porcupine’ had\r\nchanged his tune and was singing low, with the absurd protestation that\r\nhe had ‘never published a word with regard to the President that could\r\npossibly be construed into disrespect.’[1667] He had discovered he was\r\namenable to the Alien Law he had so stoutly defended!\r\n\r\nAdams had asserted himself and was happy, and when Pickering was writing\r\nWashington that his successor was ‘suffering the torments of the\r\ndamned,’ Adams was writing cheerfully to his wife that he could hardly\r\nbe chosen President a second time, and would be glad of the relief.\r\n‘To-night I must go to the ball; where I suppose I shall get cold and\r\nhave to eat gruel for breakfast for a week afterwards.’[1668] The\r\ndetermined little patriot was now on the top of the world, and now it\r\nwas his enemies that were guessing. The senatorial committee had been an\r\nidea of Hamilton’s, to whom Sedgwick had hastened the news of the\r\nnomination. The committee had failed. Even the suggestion of two more\r\nenvoys had been scorned. Something might still be done through\r\nconciliation. Ellsworth, the Chief Justice, had Adams’s confidence and\r\nhe was sent to try his powers of persuasion, and succeeded. Thus, the\r\nnominations of Murray, Ellsworth, and Patrick Henry were sent to the\r\nSenate, and confirmed without even a whimper from ‘Porcupine.’ But\r\nbeneath the surface, the passions were seething. Sedgwick wrote King\r\nthat he had not ‘conversed with an individual ... who did not\r\nunequivocably reprobate the measure.’[1669] Tracy, who had wanted to arm\r\nthe women and children against the French, wrote McHenry that while he\r\nhad sacrificed much ‘to root out Democracy,’ he thought it ‘to be lost\r\nand worse.’[1670] Cabot assured King that ‘surprise, indignation, grief,\r\nand disgust followed each other in quick succession in the breasts of\r\nthe true friends of the country,’[1671] and informed Pickering that he\r\nhad written ‘a piece’ about it for the Boston papers, but that ‘the\r\nBoston press had been fixed by the President’s friends and it had not\r\nappeared.’[1672] To King, he ascribed Adams’s action to jealousy of\r\nHamilton and Washington.[1673] Pickering wrote Cabot that ‘the\r\nPresident’s character can never be retrieved.’[1674] Stephen Higginson,\r\nthe merchant prince of the Essex Junto, found the world dark indeed. Why\r\nhad not war been declared in the summer of 1798? Even the powers given\r\nAdams by the Alien and Sedition Laws had not been used![1675] Jonathan\r\nMason was furious because ‘from being respectable in Europe, from having\r\nconvinced Great Britain and from having associated with all the friends\r\nof Order, Property, and Society ... we must again become soothers and\r\nsuppliants for peace from a gang of pitiful robbers.’[1676] Ames wrote\r\nthat the new embassy ‘disgusts most men here’ because they thought\r\n‘peace with France ... an evil.’[1677] Even at Adams’s table the\r\njeremiads of the Federalists were heard, and the dinners were somber\r\naffairs. Bayard of Delaware was loud in his lamentations.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Bayard, I am surprised to hear you express yourself in this\r\nmanner,’ said Adams. ‘Would you prefer a war with France to a war with\r\nEngland in the present state of the world; would you wish for an\r\nalliance with Great Britain and a war with France? If you would, your\r\nopinions are totally different from mine.’\r\n\r\n‘Great Britain is very powerful,’ Bayard replied mournfully. ‘Her navy\r\nis very terrible.’[1678]\r\n\r\nWhen at the end of the session, Adams set forth for his seat at\r\nBraintree, Harper expressed the hope that his horses might run away and\r\nbreak his neck.[1679] Only John Jay, among the outstanding Federalists,\r\ncould see no objections to the mission, but he was always bothered by\r\nscruples.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate that Adams’s love for Braintree caused him to desert\r\nthe capital in this crisis. The policy of the conspirators was to wear\r\nout their chief’s purpose through procrastination, and, in the\r\nmeanwhile, to bring all possible pressure to bear to restore his secret\r\nenemies to his good graces. He had made the sailing of the envoys\r\nconditional on a direct assurance from France as to the reception they\r\nwould receive. Under the most favorable conditions this meant months of\r\ndelay, and the treacherous policy of Pickering made it worse. On March\r\n6th Adams instructed his Secretary of State to inform Murray of the\r\nconditions, but it was not until in May that the latter heard from\r\nPickering. Talleyrand was immediately informed, and within a week Murray\r\nwas in possession of the required official assurances, but it was the\r\nlast day of July before they reached Philadelphia. Disappointing to the\r\nconspirators though these were, a careful study of the Talleyrand note\r\ndisclosed a touch of annoyance over the delay. The insolence of the man!\r\nAnother insult! The conspirators determined if possible to make this the\r\noccasion for further delay. If Adams could only be persuaded to insist\r\nupon an explanation of the impatient paragraph, more time would be\r\ngained, and Pickering strongly recommended this in his note transmitting\r\nthe Talleyrand letter to the President. But Adams was too wary now to be\r\neasily caught. Replying dryly that he could overlook the language for\r\nthe deed, he instructed Pickering that, while preparations for war\r\nproceeded, the commission should be hurried to Ellsworth and Governor\r\nDavie--for the latter had been named in the place of Henry, who had\r\ndeclined--with instructions to prepare for embarkation at any moment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with Pickering taking six weeks in the preparations of the\r\ninstructions, efforts were being made to coax Adams into his enemies’\r\ncamp. One day Cabot suavely presented himself at the house at Braintree\r\non a purely social neighborly visit. He went at the instance of the\r\nHamiltonians to wheedle the old man back into their clutches. That the\r\nablest politician of the Essex Junto was affectionately friendly, we may\r\nbe sure, but his courtesy was matched by that of Adams and Mrs. Adams,\r\nand he stayed for dinner. But Abigail never left the room. The President\r\noccasionally went out, Abigail never. Though she was gracious to a\r\ndegree. Thus the door of opportunity was closed and locked and Abigail\r\nhad the key. Cabot found that ‘every heart was locked and every tongue\r\nwas silenced upon all topics that bore affinity to those which I wished\r\nto touch.’[1680] Hamilton was in intimate touch with the leading members\r\nof the Adams Cabinet all the while--far more so than Adams; but the\r\nPresident knew of the movements of his dearest enemy through the\r\nJeffersonian press. The latter part of April found Hamilton in\r\nPhiladelphia with Gouverneur Morris, in close communion with Pickering,\r\nWolcott, and McHenry. Duane flippantly announced that they had ‘kept the\r\nfast in Philadelphia,’ and that ‘a pair more pious, more chaste, more\r\nmoral perhaps never mortified the flesh and the spirit since the days of\r\nDavid and the fair Shunammite.’[1681] At Braintree Adams was keeping his\r\nown counsels, enjoying the serenity of domesticity, with occasional\r\nexcursions into Boston to attend church or the theater, always\r\naccompanied by the Marshal of the district. When the Boston Troop went\r\nto Braintree to accompany him, with military pomp, to the Harvard\r\nCommencement, he was enormously pleased.[1682] But he was on the alert.\r\nAbout the time Pickering’s belated instructions reached him with a\r\nletter from the Cabinet suggesting the suspension of the mission for a\r\ntime, he read a cautiously worded note from Stoddert, his Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, hinting at the importance of his presence in Trenton, whither\r\nthe Government had temporarily gone because of the prevalence of yellow\r\nfever again in Philadelphia. Adams was able to read between the lines.\r\n\r\nThe silent treatment to which the conspirators were being subjected\r\nannoyed them beyond endurance. They were by no means certain it was a\r\nhoax when they read in ‘The Aurora’ on August 15th that ‘the Executive\r\nof the United States has ordered the frigate “John Adams” to be\r\nprepared to carry our envoys without delay to Europe,’ and the\r\n‘Centinel’ in Boston was not able to deny it for several days.[1683] In\r\nSeptember, Pickering was urging Cabot to persuade Ellsworth to dissuade\r\nAdams from sending the mission. ‘There is nothing in politics he\r\ndespises more than this mission,’ he wrote.[1684] Ellsworth did as he\r\nwas bid--with a difference. He asked that early notice be given him of\r\nthe plans because of ‘unusual demands upon his time on the official\r\ncircuit.’[1685] The real attitude of Ellsworth is not at all plain, for\r\nit was being whispered about that he hoped to reach the Presidency\r\nthrough the success of the mission.[1686]\r\n\r\nThen came another pretext for delay. There had come another shift in\r\nFrench politics, with some indications of the restoration of the\r\nJacobins to power, and Talleyrand had resigned. Did this not call for\r\nfurther postponement? Adams replied in the affirmative, fixing the\r\nlatter part of October as the limit, and promising to be in Trenton by\r\nthe middle of that month. Rejoicing in this delay, Pickering began to\r\nmeditate on the possible intervention of the Senate. With this in view\r\nhe wrote Cabot for advice. The reply was wholly unsatisfactory. ‘If the\r\nSenate should be admitted to possess a right to determine a priori what\r\nforeign connections should be sought or shunned, I should fear that they\r\nwould soon exhibit the humiliating spectacle of cap and hats which so\r\nlong and so naturally appeared in Sweden,’ said Cabot.[1687] Adams had\r\nthe power, and he was silent. The conspirators began to mobilize for a\r\ndesperate attempt at Trenton.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOn October 6th, Adams drove down the road from Braintree on his way to\r\nTrenton with such secrecy that he was halfway there before Cabot knew he\r\nhad gone.[1688] The conspirators were there before him, Pinckney on the\r\nground, Hamilton at Newark within easy call. Ellsworth had been summoned\r\nfrom Hartford. Governor Davie, having received a flattering address from\r\nhis fellow citizens at Raleigh, was on the road, ‘a troop of horse and\r\na cavalcade of citizens escorting him four miles on his way.’[1689]\r\n\r\nAdams reached Trenton on Thursday, and on Friday night there was ‘a\r\nhandsome display of fireworks’ in his honor, ‘in which Mr. Guimpe, the\r\nartist, exhibited much skill and ingenuity.’ The initials of Adams and\r\nWashington ‘displayed in colored fires was received with shouts of\r\napplause.’ On Saturday, Ellsworth arrived. Hamilton appeared upon the\r\nscene. Just at that juncture the conspirators were much elated with the\r\nnews of the successes of the British army under the Duke of York in\r\nHolland, and the triumphant march of the Russians under Suwarrow in\r\nSwitzerland. Might not the next report bring the news of the restoration\r\nof the Bourbons in France, and the end to the hideous nightmare of\r\ndemocracy? Here was a new club, and the conspirators laid eager hands\r\nupon it. Hamilton called to urge the point.\r\n\r\n‘Why, Sir, by Christmas Louis XVIII will be seated upon his throne,’ he\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n‘By whom?’ demanded Adams.\r\n\r\n‘By the coalition,’ Hamilton replied.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, then,’ said Adams, ‘farewell to the independence of Europe.’[1690]\r\n\r\nWhen the President entertained the two envoys at dinner, he was amazed\r\nto find Ellsworth echoing the views of Hamilton.\r\n\r\n‘Is it possible, Mr. Chief Justice,’ demanded Adams, ‘that you can\r\nseriously believe that the Bourbons are, or will soon be restored to the\r\nthrone of France?’\r\n\r\n‘Why,’ said Ellsworth, smiling sheepishly, ‘it looks a good deal so.’\r\n\r\n‘I should not be afraid to stake my life upon it that they will not be\r\nrestored for seven years, if they ever are,’ was Adams’s retort.[1691]\r\n\r\nThe coincidence in the views of the two men was not lost on Adams, who\r\nasked a member of his Cabinet if ‘Ellsworth and Hamilton had come all\r\nthe way from Windsor and New York to persuade me to countermand the\r\nmission.’[1692] That was an ominous comment. The resulting excitement\r\namong his advisers did not escape the watchful eye of Adams, who wrote\r\nAbigail that it left him ‘calmly cold.’\r\n\r\nOn the night of October 15th Adams, calm, cold, thrice-armed, sat about\r\nthe table with his Cabinet, no longer deceived by any of them save\r\nWolcott. The purpose was the consideration of the instructions that had\r\nbeen prepared. Some changes were made. Adams asked advice on certain\r\npoints. At eleven o’clock the instructions were unanimously approved.\r\nThe Cabinet lingered, but Adams brought up no new subject. Out into the\r\ndark Trenton streets trooped the conspirators, almost hopeful. They were\r\nstill at breakfast the next morning when orders were received from Adams\r\nthat the instructions should be put in shape, a frigate be placed in\r\nreadiness to receive the envoys who should sail not later than the first\r\nof the month.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy had failed and John Adams was actually President.\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians were jubilant. Duane wrote that Adams had ‘crossed the\r\nRubicon,’ but that the rumor that Pickering and Wolcott had resigned was\r\ngroundless. ‘They will never sacrifice their places to squeamish\r\nfeelings.’[1693] Hamilton had sought to deter the President, but to his\r\nhonor ‘he resisted every seducement and repelled every\r\ninsinuation.’[1694] The Hamiltonians were either furious or depressed.\r\nThe Southern Federalists under Marshall approved, as did Jay, and the\r\n‘Centinel’ commended the act, but the men who had made and maintained\r\nthe prestige of the Federalist Party were in murderous mood. The mission\r\nwould succeed--they knew it. There would be no war, and the army would\r\nhave to go. With that would go the instrument for keeping down\r\ninsurrections in America or for waging a war of conquest in South\r\nAmerica. With one masterful effort, Adams had pulled down the pillars of\r\nthe party temple and he could not escape in its fall. But it was the\r\nproudest and most masterful moment in his life, and he was content. Long\r\nafter the _débâcle_ he was to write that he asked no better epitaph than\r\nthe sentence that he had taken upon himself the responsibility of the\r\npeace with France.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the Federalists were a house divided against itself,\r\nand the cloud burst and the rain descended and beat upon it, and the\r\ndays were dark. Dreary, indeed, that winter of 1799. ‘Porcupine’ was\r\ndriven from Philadelphia, and young Fenno, disgusted, gave up his paper\r\nwith a farewell address so contemptuous of democracy and American\r\ninstitutions that the wiser leaders trembled at his temerity. M’Kean,\r\nthe Democrat, had been swept into the gubernatorial office. Washington\r\nhad died, and could no longer be used to advance the party interest.\r\nEven the dashing Harper, clever in political fight or social frolic, had\r\ndespaired of the future in politics, resigned his seat, and made\r\narrangements to move to Baltimore as the son-in-law of Carroll of\r\nCarrollton.[1695] Duane was firing relentlessly at the scandals and\r\nfinding flesh, and there was no ‘Porcupine’ to return the fire. The\r\nbrilliant and audacious Charles Pinckney had appeared in the Senate to\r\ngive a militant leadership to the Jeffersonians that the Federalists\r\ncould not match. Into the House had come a giant, in John Marshall, to\r\ngive to a later-day Federalism a sanity that came too late, but he was\r\nwith Adams, not Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe shadows even fell on the brilliant Federalist society. Hamilton was\r\nthere that winter, to be sure, ‘to keep the watch,’ as Duane put it, and\r\nthrough an unhappy coincidence ‘The Aurora’ was able to add that ‘Mrs.\r\nReynolds, the sentimental heroine,’ was back in town. But something like\r\ntragedy had fallen on the Holland House of Federalism, and weeping was\r\nheard in the rooms once given to gayety and laughter. One night Marie\r\nBingham, not sixteen, slipped out of the home of her father, with Count\r\nde Tilly, age forty-five, a dissolute scion of the French aristocracy\r\nwith an eye to the Bingham fortune, and was married at two o’clock in\r\nthe morning. The couple were found in the home of a French milliner in\r\nthe early morning, and physicians worked over the brilliant Mrs.\r\nBingham, who was in hysterics. Money soon dissolved the union, but the\r\nlights were never quite so bright thereafter in the princely mansion of\r\nthe cleverest hostess in Philadelphia. The rain fell even upon the House\r\nof Bingham.[1696]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n‘THE GRAPES OF WRATH’\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen Congress convened in the winter of 1799, the Federalists thoroughly\r\nappreciated the desperation of their situation. The tide of public\r\nopinion was rising against them rapidly because of their measures, and\r\nthey were divided against themselves. As the sun of the once brilliant\r\nparty went down, there was one colossal figure of brilliant promise\r\nsilhouetted against the darkening sky, but John Marshall, now a member\r\nof the House, was not in good odor with the Hamiltonians because of his\r\nopposition to the Alien and Sedition Laws. The irrepressible clash of\r\ncontending policies and ambitions had been foreshadowed in the\r\ndifficulties Marshall had encountered in framing a Reply to Adams’s\r\nAddress that could command the united support of the party, and he had\r\nsucceeded measurably by giving the Reply a meaningless phrasing. For a\r\nmoment it seemed that Marshall might regain the confidence of his fellow\r\npartisans when, in a speech of brilliancy and force, he had demolished\r\nthe flimsy case of the Democrats against the President in the matter of\r\nJonathan Robbins. With his characteristic readiness to concede the full\r\nstrength of an enemy, Jefferson had written Madison that in the debate\r\non Robbins ‘J. Marshall [distinguished himself] greatly.’[1697] But the\r\nFederalist cheers for their new leader were speedily turned to groans\r\nand hisses--and thereon hangs a tale of political infamy scarcely\r\napproached in audacity in American history.\r\n\r\nAlmost two years before, when the French war hysteria was at its height\r\nand the Federalists were cocks of the walk, the inner circle of the\r\nparty in the Senate met one night about the table in the Bingham\r\ndining-room with the more moderate senatorial members. To assure party\r\nsolidarity on all important party measures, it was proposed to bind all\r\nby the votes of the majority in a party caucus. The extremists had a\r\nslight majority over the moderate element. Thus, for a season, the\r\nGovernment was, to all practical purposes, in the hands of a Senate\r\noligarchy composed of a minority of the Senators. From the summer of\r\n1799, the extremists entertained no illusions as to their popularity\r\nwith the country. The election of Jefferson seemed imminent--provided a\r\nway could not be found to cheat him of his victory. From that moment on\r\nuntil the hour of his final triumph by the vote of the House in 1801,\r\nthere was not a moment when the Federalist leaders were not ready to\r\nadopt any method, however disreputable and desperate, to accomplish\r\ntheir purpose. In this spirit they conceived the wicked scheme to rob\r\nJefferson of his victory through an amazing measure prescribing the mode\r\nof deciding disputed elections for President and Vice-President. Senator\r\nRoss of Pennsylvania agreed to sponsor the bill.\r\n\r\nBriefly and baldly, this provided that on the opening and reading of the\r\ncertificates of the electoral votes in the presence of Congress, the\r\npapers should be turned over to a grand committee consisting of six\r\nmembers of each branch of Congress, with the Chief Justice as presiding\r\nofficer. The members of the House and Senate committees should be\r\nelected by ballot. These, with the Chief Justice, were to go into secret\r\nsession behind locked doors. They were to have the power to send for\r\npersons and papers, to pass on the qualifications of electors, and the\r\nmanner in which they had cast their votes; to investigate charges that\r\nbribery, intimidation, persuasion, or force had been employed; and\r\nfinally, to decide which votes should be counted and which cast out.\r\nThis decision was to be final. In other words, it was a criminal scheme\r\nand an unconstitutional plot to steal the election. It had the support\r\nof the great majority of the best minds in the Federalist Party.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the sinister nature of this monstrous measure, it was\r\nproposed to withhold it carefully from the public until the consummation\r\nof the crime. Happily there were members of Congress who did not\r\nconsider themselves bound in honor to protect dishonor from the light,\r\nand almost immediately three copies of the bill found their way to the\r\noffice of Duane. Two of these were personally delivered with permission\r\nto print and disclose the donors; one was mailed under cover.[1698] The\r\nbill was immediately printed in full in ‘The Aurora’ with appropriate\r\ncomments, and the conspirators were dragged into the light. ‘The new\r\nelectoral council or college may be very fitly compared with the secret\r\nCouncil of Ten at Venice of old,’ wrote the editor.[1699] Out of this\r\nexposure grew the proceedings culminating in the prosecution for\r\nsedition against Duane.\r\n\r\nWith the Federalists in control of both branches of Congress, it did not\r\nappear at first to matter much. The leaders of the party had never\r\ngreatly concerned themselves with public opinion. They mustered their\r\nmen in the Senate for a vote, leaving a discussion of the measure to the\r\nopposition. Behind the sorry smoke screen of the Duane prosecution they\r\nmarched unblushingly to their purpose. The final protest was made by\r\nCharles Pinckney, the brilliant new leader of the Democrats in the\r\nSenate, in a powerful constitutional argument that no one cared to\r\nmeet.[1700] ‘Equal in eloquence and strength of reasoning to anything\r\never heard within the walls of Congress,’ said ‘The Aurora.’[1701] He\r\nsat down. No one rose to reply. The question was taken on the passage of\r\nthe bill and it passed by a strict party vote of 16 to 12.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the publicity given the rather brazen plan to steal the\r\nelection was having its reactions on the people, and Federalist members\r\nof the House began to protest. There was no one in a more rebellious\r\nmood than Marshall, who thought the situation too serious to permit him\r\nto leave for home on the birth of his fifth child.[1702] With a more\r\nfar-reaching vision and a greater respect for public opinion than the\r\nveteran leaders of his party, he made his objections audible. On the\r\nfloor of the House, on the street, at the boarding-house, he talked\r\nboldly and incessantly against the measure. The Federalists were amazed,\r\ndisgusted. Some of the leaders who appreciated his ability observed his\r\ninsubordination with sorrow. They had doubted his ‘political judgment,’\r\nbut had counted on swaying him to their views because of his\r\ncompanionable temperament. They took note of his ‘very affectionate\r\ndisposition,’ his attachment to pleasures, his conviviality, his seeming\r\n‘indolence,’ and they cultivated him on the side of his weaknesses. But\r\nthey found him a difficult psychological problem. He had a timidity due\r\nto his tendency to ‘feel the public pulse,’ was disposed to ‘erotic\r\nrefinement,’ and, worse still, to ‘express great respect for the\r\nsovereign people.’ With all this he possessed a persuasive power that\r\nworked with fatal effect on ‘more feeble minds,’ and he was exerting\r\nthis power among the members with disastrous results.\r\n\r\nTheodore Sedgwick, ponderous and pompous, and in politics insinuating,\r\nwas apparently delegated to coax Marshall into the conspiracy. A number\r\nof heart-to-heart talks with the rebel followed. The Virginian doubted\r\nthe constitutional ‘power of the legislature to delegate such authority\r\nto a Committee.’ After a long talk he ‘confessed himself ... to be\r\nconvinced,’ but shifted, according to Sedgwick, to the ground that the\r\npeople had authorized the members to decide, each for himself, in the\r\ncase of election disputes. In its nature this power was ‘too delicate to\r\nbe delegated.’ To Sedgwick this was ‘so attenuated and unsubstantial’ as\r\nto be beyond his comprehension, and Marshall was persuaded to abandon\r\nthis ground too. But ‘in the meantime he had dwelt so much in\r\nconversation on these subjects that he had dissipated our majority,’\r\nSedgwick wrote King.[1703]\r\n\r\nWhen the discussions opened in the House, Marshall questioned the\r\npropriety of the Senate naming the chairman of the committee and of\r\nmaking the decision final, and offered an amendment.[1704] This was\r\nfollowed by other amendments and ultimately by the revamping of the\r\nwhole measure. The Senate refused to accept the amendments, and thus the\r\nmeasure died between the two houses. Duane was jubilant. Here was\r\nevidence of the value of a free press. The ‘odious bill was introduced\r\nfor party purposes,’ and a party in the Senate ‘sought to overwhelm by\r\nterror and oppression the men who dared to publish the bill, which even\r\nafter numerous amendments was found too abominable to be countenanced by\r\nthe House of Representatives.’[1705] The Federalists were downcast and\r\nindignant. Senator Tracy, who had no political scruples, declared that\r\n‘Marshall has spoiled all the fair hopes founded on Mr. Ross’s\r\nbill.’[1706] Thus Marshall saved the country from revolution and\r\nJefferson from defeat regardless of the vote--as Hamilton was to save\r\nhim later.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe campaign was now on, but from this time we shall hear little of the\r\nactivities of Jefferson. His work was done. Back to his beloved hilltop\r\nhe hurried on the adjournment of Congress, and there he remained,\r\napparently less concerned with politics than with potatoes. But he had\r\nalready created the machinery, trained the mechanicians, supplied the\r\nmunitions of victory, found means for financing the enterprise--and he\r\nleft the work with his lieutenants.\r\n\r\nIn the leadership of his party Jefferson had no rival, and he was the\r\nidol of his followers, ‘the people’s friend.’ The persecution he had met\r\nhad but endeared him more to his supporters. He was their Messiah. On\r\nNew Year’s Eve in 1799, a company of Democrats spent the evening in\r\nconversation and songs until the new year came. Then, headed by a\r\nregimental band, they marched through the dark streets of Philadelphia,\r\npast the homes of the rich and fashionable blazing with light, to pay\r\ntheir respects to Jefferson at his lodgings. On the way, they\r\nencountered another large group, who, unknown to the first, had\r\nconceived the same plan for declaring their allegiance. The two crowds\r\nfraternized and marched on together. With cheers and shouts they\r\nsummoned their leader to the door. When the tall, familiar figure\r\nappeared, the welkin rang, the band played, and a song, written for the\r\noccasion, was sung.[1707] The incident is significant of the common\r\nrecognition of Jefferson’s leadership.\r\n\r\nDuring the two preceding years the consummate political genius of\r\nJefferson had been planning the programme for the struggle of 1800. The\r\ncongressional strategy of his party had been his work, and night after\r\nnight he had gathered his lieutenants about him at the dinner table of\r\nthe Indian Queen and given his orders for the morrow. If the party\r\nplatform had not then been conceived, he had his programme, which met\r\nthe purpose. Writing Madison in January, 1799, he proposed that all\r\npossible emphasis be put upon the Alien and Sedition Laws, the direct\r\ntax, the army and navy, ‘the usurious loan to set these follies on\r\nfoot,’ and on the picture of ‘recruiting officers lounging at every\r\ncourt-house and decoying the laborer from his plough.’[1708] About the\r\nsame time he was expanding this programme in a letter to Gerry: The\r\nconstitutional rights of the States should be asserted. The right of\r\nCongress to ‘its constitutional share in the division of power’ should\r\nbe maintained. The Government should be ‘rigorously frugal’ and all\r\npossible savings should be applied to the discharge of the public debt.\r\nThe multiplication of offices should be stopped. A standing army in time\r\nof peace should be attacked. Free commerce should be maintained with all\r\nnations, and there should be ‘political connections with none.’ The\r\nliberty of speech and the freedom of the press should be\r\npreserved.[1709]\r\n\r\nThat same month he was writing Edmund Pendleton in the same vein--the\r\n‘direct tax,’ the ‘army and navy in time of peace,’ the ‘usurious\r\ninterest,’ the ‘recruiting officers at every court-house to decoy the\r\nlaborer from his plough.’[1710] In these letters we have the first\r\nJeffersonian platform--and on these points, from that time on, the\r\nDemocrats harped constantly in Congress, in pamphlets and through the\r\npress. Not least, nor least effective, among the methods of propaganda\r\nwere the congressional letters with which the Jeffersonian members\r\nflooded their constituents, setting forth in vigorous fashion all the\r\ncounts in the indictment. As these letters fell upon the country like a\r\nsnowstorm, the Federalists were infuriated. They summoned their Federal\r\nJudges to denounce them in charges to grand juries, and Iredell\r\nfoolishly responded. In Congress they hinted darkly that these records\r\nof public affairs sent by public servants to the public they served were\r\nseditious. Many years afterward Adams recalled them with rage--these\r\nletters that ‘swelled, raged, foamed in all the fury of a tempest at sea\r\nagainst me,’ a flood so enormous that ‘a collection of those letters\r\nwould make many volumes.’ Adams never forgave his party for finding no\r\nmeans for their suppression.[1711]\r\n\r\nThese letters were part of the Jeffersonian plan to reach the people and\r\nset the tongues to wagging. Everywhere Jefferson was encouraging his\r\nfollowers to establish newspapers. Soon Noah Webster’s paper was\r\ncomplaining that the irrepressible Matthew Lyon ‘in the course of one\r\nyear has established no less than four ... presses.’[1712] Was money\r\nneeded for the publication of pamphlets or the distribution of\r\nnewspapers? Jefferson made out a subscription list, put his friends down\r\nfor a contribution, and informed them of his action without apology.\r\nThus, to Monroe: An important measure is under contemplation which ‘will\r\nrequire a considerable sum of money.’ He had therefore put Monroe down\r\nfor from fifty to a hundred dollars.[1713] Thus, to Madison: ‘Every man\r\nmust lay his pen and his purse under contribution.’[1714] Were articles\r\nrequired? He sent instructions to his friends to write. Thus, to\r\nPendleton, asking him to prepare a pamphlet on the Gerry\r\ncorrespondence,[1715] and to Madison asking him to ‘set aside a portion\r\nof every post day to write what may be proper for the public.’[1716]\r\nWere pamphlets printed and ready for distribution? Then a letter from\r\nJefferson to men of the standing of Monroe ordering them to place them\r\nin the hands of ‘the most influential characters among our countrymen\r\nwho are only misled.’[1717]\r\n\r\nIn every State he had men of political sagacity through whom he could\r\nwork while maintaining the semblance of aloofness. In Massachusetts,\r\nGerry; in New Hampshire, Langdon; in Connecticut, Bishop and Granger; in\r\nNew York, Livingston and Burr; in Pennsylvania, Gallatin, M’Kean, and\r\nthe Muhlenbergs; in Maryland, Mercer and General Sam Smith; in Virginia,\r\nMadison, Monroe, Giles, and Pendleton; in Kentucky, John Breckenridge\r\nand George Nicholson; in North Carolina, Macon, Jones, and Joseph Gales,\r\nthe clever and daring editor of the Raleigh ‘Register’ who put the\r\nFederalists to the torture with the best paper in the State, which was\r\nsent free to prospective converts;[1718] and in Tennessee, Senator\r\nWilliam Cocke, an old Amelia County Virginian, and William C. C.\r\nClaiborne. In South Carolina, where the Hamiltonians were strong in the\r\nsupport of the Pinckney brothers, and through the commercial interests\r\nof Charleston, he was fortunate in having Charles Pinckney, more\r\nbrilliant, daring, picturesque, and magnetic than his cousins, and Peter\r\nFreneau, brother of the poet, and editor of the ‘Charleston City News.’\r\nNowhere did the Jeffersonians make better progress against stubborn\r\nresistance than in the Palmetto State. Thence Hamilton had long drawn\r\nfor talent, but his party was being gradually undermined. William Smith,\r\nwho recited speeches Hamilton had written, had retired to escape defeat\r\nto a berth in Lisbon; and Harper, noting the premonitions of a storm,\r\nhad announced his retirement from Congress to seek consolation in the\r\nglamour of the Carroll wealth and in the charms of a Carroll daughter in\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was largely wrought through the management of a few\r\nJeffersonians who met night after night in Freneau’s office on George\r\nStreet to plan the fight. Either of two participants in these\r\nconferences was a host within himself. There was Freneau--huge in frame,\r\nand, aside from height, bearing a striking resemblance to Charles James\r\nFox in voice, conversation, and manners, with a literary style which a\r\ncontemporary found to combine ‘the beauty and smoothness of Addison and\r\nthe strength and simplicity of Cobbett.’ And there was Charles Pinckney,\r\nhandsome, imposing, a favorite of fortune, dominating in leadership,\r\neloquent and forceful in debate, conspicuous in the Constitutional\r\nConvention in his twenties and Governor of his State at thirty-one.\r\nThere about the table, and over their cups we may be sure, they set\r\ntheir traps, and planned their propaganda. Freneau would take up his pen\r\nand literally dash off a powerful article with a facility and felicity\r\nthat called for no revision or correction; and Pinckney would write an\r\narticle to be signed ‘A Republican,’ or appear unexpectedly at a public\r\nmeeting to sweep the audience with him by the fire and force of his\r\neloquence.[1719] These men sallied forth to battle with a gallant gayety\r\nsuggested by their own facetious description of their conferences as\r\n‘The Rye House Plot.’\r\n\r\nThus everywhere Jefferson had men on whom he could depend, and his\r\norders given, his work done, he could spend the summer and autumn of\r\n1800 with his potatoes. There we must leave him and look elsewhere for\r\nthe drama of the fighting. Only twice during the campaign did he wander\r\nfarther from Monticello than Charlottesville. Mounted on his horse, he\r\nrode daily over his plantation. Every evening he made his customary\r\nnotations in his farm account book. When Marie’s pianoforte arrived, he\r\nmight have been seen tuning it himself while the battle raged on many\r\nfronts. He wrote his daughter the details of a neighborhood murder, and\r\nof the prospects of the harvest, but nothing of politics. His work was\r\ndone. He had ploughed and sowed and tended--but the work in the\r\nharvest-field was for others. In the early summer a strange tale\r\ntraveled throughout the country, recorded in all the papers, that he had\r\ndied suddenly. The papers printed it cautiously, however, and there was\r\nno political motive in its circulation. At length it was explained. One\r\nof his slaves named ‘Thomas Jefferson’ had died at Monticello. Jefferson\r\nwas never more alive than that summer on his hilltop.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThat a tidal wave toward Democracy had set in was shown in the early\r\nspring in the elections in New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\r\nBy common consent New York was put down as the pivotal State and both\r\nparties planned to put forth their utmost efforts there. Jefferson,\r\nstill in Philadelphia, was keeping in intimate touch with the situation\r\nthrough his correspondents in the State, and placing reliance on the\r\nsagacity of Aaron Burr. As early as January, he was writing Monroe with\r\nthe utmost confidence of the result ‘on the strength of [his]\r\nadvices.’[1720] In March he was assuring Madison, on the representations\r\nof Burr and Livingston, that the State was safe if the city of New York\r\ncould be carried.[1721] The Federalists, he found seriously alarmed.\r\n‘Their speeches in private, as well as their public and private demeanor\r\ntoward me, indicate it strongly.’[1722] Hamilton himself had seemed so\r\ndepressed that Henry Lee had written rallying him on his pessimism and\r\nurging him to ‘be more like yourself and resist to victory all your\r\nfoes.’[1723] He had replied with a touch of petulance that he was not\r\ndespondent and stood ‘on ground which, sooner or later, will assure me a\r\ntriumph over all my enemies.’[1724] But he was then facing the most\r\ndesperate fighting of his career, with Burr leading the opposition with\r\na smiling gayety that was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing fashion of picturing Hamilton as a saintly soul sent to\r\nhis death by a deep-dyed villain of the type once popular in the\r\nmelodrama, cannot conceal the amazing resemblance of these two men.\r\nThere were probably no other two men in the America of their day who\r\nwere so much alike. Physically both were small, compactly built, of\r\nmilitant carriage, with penetrating eyes of different colors, and of\r\npersuasive voices. Both were dandies in their dress, the glass of\r\nfashion and the mould of form, courtly, Chesterfieldian, and dashing.\r\nBoth had demonstrated their courage and military sagacity on the field\r\nof battle--Hamilton in the assault at Yorktown, Burr in carrying his\r\nbeloved Montgomery from the battle-field on his back, wading knee-deep\r\nin snow, and amidst a rain of bullets. Burr, no less than Hamilton, had\r\nserved in the military household of Washington, and both alike had\r\nresented their leader’s rather imperious manner. At the New York Bar\r\nboth had risen to eminence, and some hesitated to give the superiority\r\nto either. Here their methods were different--Hamilton relying on\r\nerudition where Burr depended on finesse, the former exhaustive in\r\nargument, the latter concise. Both were effective orators in different\r\nways. Hamilton was declamatory, Burr conversational. Socially they had\r\nmany points of similarity, and in a social sense they were not averse to\r\none another’s company at dinner. In conversation one was scarcely more\r\nscintillating than the other, and both were fond of badinage, and adept\r\nin compliments to the ladies. Both were gallants, attractive to, and\r\nattracted by, women of wit and beauty. Neither was above the intrigues\r\nof love, with ideas of morality that would have been appreciated in the\r\nLondon of the Restoration. If Burr kept his diary, which seems so\r\nshocking to some, Hamilton had his pamphlet on his affair with Mrs.\r\nReynolds--but Burr did not publish his diary. Neither should be judged\r\ntoo harshly, for it was a day of rather loose morals, and the press made\r\nfree with the gossip concerning Harper and Sedgwick. Both were\r\ninordinately ambitious for command, impatient under restraint, and wont\r\nto dream of leading triumphant armies. The ambition of neither was\r\ncircumscribed by the boundaries of the country. If Burr wished to lead\r\nan army of conquest into Mexico, Hamilton longed to lead the same sort\r\nof an army into South America.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Burr were natural enemies because too much alike in\r\ntemperament and ambition. Their hopes clashed. Both were deeply in love\r\nwith their wives, notwithstanding their transgressions. There is\r\nsomething touching in Burr’s letters to his sick wife, his anxiety, his\r\nconsultations with physicians, his instructions to Theodosia. He was\r\nidolized by wife and daughter because they, in turn, were idolized by\r\nhim. Unlike Hamilton, he was even tender with his servants. It is quite\r\nimpossible to conceive of Hamilton writing friendly letters to his men\r\nand women domestics and slaves. To understand Burr’s fascination for\r\nmany, one thing must be borne in mind--he was loved because he was\r\nlovable in his personal contacts.\r\n\r\nThese two men faced each other for a finish fight in the spring of\r\n1800.[1725]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the early spring the surface indications were not favorable for a\r\nJeffersonian victory in the election that was to determine the political\r\ncomplexion of the Legislature that would select the presidential\r\nelectors. The Federalists were seemingly entrenched. Behind them,\r\nvictories. Hamilton was openly active, Burr watchful like a cat. One of\r\nthe latter’s closest lieutenants wrote Gallatin of the situation\r\ndeveloping in March. ‘The Federalists have had a meeting and determined\r\non their Senators; they have also appointed a committee to nominate\r\nsuitable characters for the Assembly.... Mr. Hamilton is very busy, more\r\nso than usual, and no exertions will be wanting on his part. Fortunately\r\nMr. Hamilton will have at this election a most powerful opponent in\r\nColonel Burr. This gentleman is exceedingly active; it is his opinion\r\nthat the Republicans had better not publish a ticket or call a meeting\r\nuntil the Federalists have completed theirs. Mr. Burr is arranging\r\nmatters in such a way as to bring into operation all the Republican\r\ninterests.’[1726]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Hamilton was twofold--to elect the Federalist electors,\r\nand to elect only such electors as he could control against Adams. With\r\nthis in view he called a secret caucus composed of his most pliant\r\nfollowers. Preferring tools to men of independence and capacity, the\r\ncaucus selected men of no popularity and little weight. Burr, who had an\r\nincomparable system of espionage in this campaign, was instantly put in\r\npossession of the ticket. The brilliant black eyes of the little\r\npolitician hastily and gravely scanned the list. Then, folding it and\r\nplacing it in his pocket, he murmured, ‘Now I have him hollow!’[1727]\r\nMeanwhile, Burr had been busily engaged in the creation of a powerful,\r\ncompact organization. Like most brilliant men of ingratiating manners,\r\nhe had drawn about him a formidable array of the young men of the city\r\nprepared to execute any orders he might give. This was his purely\r\npersonal following. He found the backbone of his organization in\r\nTammany.\r\n\r\nThe potentialities of that organization, composed, for the most part, of\r\nmen in the ordinary walks of life, the poor, the unimportant, he had\r\ninstantly sensed. They were democrats by instinct. Their Wigwam, a\r\none-story frame building, was so unprepossessing that the Federalists\r\ndubbed it ‘The Pig Pen’--but that did not bother Burr. These men had\r\nvotes, and influence among others of their kind who had votes. They met\r\nnight after night to smoke their pipes and drink their ale, to tell\r\nstories and talk politics. It is not of record that Burr ever entered\r\nthe Wigwam, but he was the Tammany boss notwithstanding, operating\r\nthrough his friends who were the ostensible leaders. It was he, seated\r\nin his law office, who moulded the policies. His suggestions whipped it\r\ninto shape as a fighting political organization.[1728] For weeks his\r\nhome had been crowded night after night with the most daring,\r\nadventurous, and ardent members of his party. Most of them were young,\r\nfit, and eager for any enterprise. Because there had been factions in\r\nthe party, he laid down the law on these occasions that personalities\r\nshould not be discussed or mentioned. These were to be submerged for the\r\ncampaign. Local considerations were to be ignored. Discipline was to be\r\nmaintained. Compromises necessary to solidarity were to be effected. The\r\nall-important thing was to amalgamate every section of the party and\r\nappeal to the people through a ticket notably superior to that of the\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nWith the audacity of genius he determined that General Horatio Gates\r\nshould be a candidate for the Assembly. More daring still, that the\r\nvenerable George Clinton, many times Governor, should stand, and that\r\nBrockholst Livingston, eminent as patriot and lawyer, should run. Samuel\r\nOsgood, a former member of Congress, and Washington’s\r\nPostmaster-General, was slated. It was easy to put them down--the\r\nproblem was to persuade them to accept. Here Burr’s genius for\r\nleadership counted heavily. Time and again he labored without avail on\r\nClinton, Gates, and Livingston. At length Livingston agreed to stand\r\nprovided both Clinton and Gates would run. Straightway, Burr rushed to\r\nGates. It was a hard struggle. Burr pleaded, cajoled, flattered,\r\nappealed to party pride. Finally Gates agreed to run if Clinton would\r\nmake the race. And there Burr almost met his Waterloo. The rugged old\r\nwar-horse was prejudiced against Jefferson. He had ambitions for the\r\nPresidency himself, and they had been passed over. Burr left the matter\r\nopen, smiled, flattered, bowed, departed. Then, out from his office\r\ncommittees began to make their way to Clinton with importunities to\r\nstand. The personal friends of the stubborn old man were sent to\r\npersuade him. He was adamant. A scene at Burr’s home at Richmond Hill:\r\nPresent, the nominating committee and Clinton. A mass movement on\r\nClinton--he would not budge. Then Burr’s master-stroke. A community had\r\na right to draft a man in a crisis--the crisis was at hand. Without his\r\nconsent they would nominate him. The rebellious veteran, flattered,\r\nagreed not to repudiate the nomination. The victory was Burr’s--and\r\nJefferson’s.\r\n\r\nA little later, the press announced that a meeting of the Democrats had\r\nbeen held at the home of J. Adams, Jr., at 68 William Street, where the\r\nAssembly ticket had been put up. Spirited resolutions were adopted. The\r\nenthusiasm of the Jeffersonians reached fever heat. Hamilton and the\r\nFederalists were paralyzed with amazement. The impossible had happened.\r\nAgainst Hamilton’s mediocre tools--this ticket, composed of commanding\r\nfigures of national repute![1729] Immediately the frantic fears of the\r\nFederalists were manifest in the efforts of ‘Portius’ in the ‘Commercial\r\nAdvertiser’ to frighten the party into action. Jefferson had become a\r\npossibility--the author of the Mazzei letter! Clinton and Gates\r\ncandidates for the Assembly! Old men laden with honors who had retired,\r\nin harness again! Clearly no office lured them--it must be the magnitude\r\nof the issue. And who were Clinton, Gates, and Osgood? Enemies of the\r\nConstitution! To your tents, O Federalists![1730] A few days later the\r\nmerchants met at the Tontine Coffee-House to endorse the Hamiltonian\r\nticket because ‘the election is peculiarly important to the mercantile\r\ninterests.’[1731] In the ‘Pig Pen’ the Tammanyites read of the action of\r\nthe merchants, clicked their glasses, and rejoiced. Hamilton, now\r\nthoroughly alarmed, redoubled his efforts. The Federalist press began to\r\nteem with hysterical attacks on Jefferson, Madison, and Clinton--men who\r\nwere planning the destruction of the Government.[1732]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Burr, calm, confident, suave, silent, was giving New York\r\nCity its first example of practical politics. Money was needed--he\r\nformed a finance committee to collect funds. Solicitors went forth to\r\nwealthy members of the party to demand certain amounts--determined upon\r\nby Burr. It was a master psychologist who scanned the subscription\r\nlists. One parsimonious rich man was down for one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n‘Strike his name off,’ said Burr. ‘You will not get the money and ...\r\nhis exertions will cease and you will not see him at the polls.’\r\n\r\nAnother name--that of a lazy man liberal with donations. ‘Double the\r\namount and tell him no labor will be expected of him.’\r\n\r\nWith infinite care Burr card-indexed every voter in the city, his\r\npolitical history, his present disposition, his temperament, his habits,\r\nhis state of health, the exertions probably necessary to get him to the\r\npolls. The people had to be aroused--Burr organized precinct and ward\r\nmeetings, sent speakers, addressed them himself. And while Burr was\r\nworking, the lowliest too were working on the lowliest. One evening ‘a\r\nlarge corpulent person with something of the appearance of Sir John\r\nFalstaff’ was seen in the lobby of a theater ‘haranguing an old black\r\nman who sells peanuts and apples to come forward and vote the Republican\r\nticket.’\r\n\r\n‘You pay heavy taxes this year.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Massa, me pay ten dollars.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, if you vote the Republican ticket you will have little or no\r\ntaxes to pay next year; for if we Republicans succeed, the standing army\r\nwill be disbanded, which cost us almost a million of money last year.’\r\n\r\nThe peanut vendor promised to appear at the polls ‘with six more\r\nfree-born sons of the African race.’[1733] Whereupon the campaigner had\r\na tale to tell to the boys at the Wigwam that night.\r\n\r\nThe polls opened on April 29th and closed at sunset on May 2d. Days of\r\nintense ceaseless activity. Hamilton and Burr took the field. From one\r\npolling-place to another they rushed to harangue the voters. When they\r\nmet, they treated each other with courtly courtesy. Handbills were put\r\nout, flooding the city during the voting. In the midst of the fight\r\nMatthew L. Davis found time at midnight to send a hasty report to\r\nGallatin in Philadelphia. ‘This day he [Burr] has remained at the polls\r\nof the Seventh ward ten hours without intermission. Pardon this hasty\r\nscrawl. I have not ate for fifteen hours.’[1734] The result was a\r\nsweeping triumph for the Democrats. When the news reached the Senate at\r\nPhiladelphia, the Federalists were so depressed and the Democrats so\r\njubilant that the transaction of business was impossible, and it\r\nadjourned.[1735]\r\n\r\nHamilton was stunned, and ready for trickery to retrieve the lost\r\nbattle. The next night he was presiding over a secret meeting of\r\nFederalists where it was agreed to ask Governor Jay to call an extra\r\nsession of the Legislature to deprive that body of the power to choose\r\nelectors. Hamilton approached Jay in a letter. ‘In times like these,’ he\r\nwrote, ‘it will not do to be over-scrupulous.’ There should be no\r\nobjections to ‘taking of legal and constitutional steps to prevent an\r\natheist in religion and a fanatic in politics from getting possession of\r\nthe helm of state.’[1736] Jay read the letter with astonishment, made a\r\nnotation that it was a plan to serve a party purpose, and buried it in\r\nthe archives. It was the blackest blot on Hamilton’s record.\r\n\r\nThat victory elected Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIt destroyed Hamilton--and it made Burr Vice-President.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the polls closed when Burr’s friends, giving him the whole\r\ncredit, as he deserved, began to urge on the leaders in Philadelphia his\r\nselection for the Vice-Presidency. Davis wrote Gallatin that the\r\nDemocrats of New York were bent on Burr.[1737] Admiral James Nicholas,\r\nthe father-in-law of Gallatin, wrote that the triumph was a miraculous\r\n‘intervention of Supreme Power and our friend Burr, the agent.’ It was\r\nhis ‘generalship, perseverance, industry, and execution’ that did it,\r\nand he deserved ‘anything and everything of his country.’ He had won ‘at\r\nthe risk of his life.’[1738] On May 12th Gallatin wrote his wife: ‘We\r\nhad last night a very large meeting of Republicans, in which it was\r\nunanimously agreed to support Burr for Vice-President.’\r\n\r\nThat was a bitter month for the Federalists. In the gubernatorial\r\ncontests in New Hampshire and Massachusetts the Democrats had polled an\r\nastonishing vote. Painfully labored were the efforts of the Federalist\r\npress to explain these remarkable accessions. The ‘Centinel’ in Boston\r\nhad previously sounded a note of warning under the caption, ‘Americans,\r\nWhy Sleep Ye?’ The Democrats, it said, were ‘organized, officered,\r\naccoutered, provided, and regularly paid.’ They were ‘systematized in\r\nall points.’ In Pennsylvania a Jeffersonian Governor had thrown\r\nFederalist office-holders ‘headlong from their posts.’ In New Hampshire\r\nthe Democrats were fighting ‘under cover of an ambuscade.’ In all States\r\nnew Jeffersonian presses were established, ‘from Portsmouth in New\r\nHampshire to Savannah in Georgia,’ through which ‘the orders of Generals\r\nof the faction are transmitted with professional punctuality; which\r\npresses serve as a sounding board to the notes that issue through that\r\ngreat speaking trumpet of the Devil, the Philadelphia Aurora.’ Did not\r\nDuane get the enormous salary of eight hundred dollars a year? ‘Why\r\nSleep Ye?’\r\n\r\nDismayed, disgruntled with Adams, but afraid to reject him openly, the\r\nFederalist caucus convened in Philadelphia and selected Charles\r\nCotesworth Pinckney as his running mate with the idea of electing him to\r\nthe Presidency through treachery to Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen Adams learned of the Federalist defeat in New York, he momentarily\r\nwent to pieces. His suspicious mind instantly saw in his humiliation the\r\nhand of Hamilton and his supporters. He had long been cognizant of the\r\ntreachery about him, in his official household. On the morning of May\r\n5th, McHenry received a note from the house on Market Street: ‘The\r\nPresident requests Mr. McHenry’s company for one minute.’ As the\r\npoet-politician walked up Market Street in response that spring morning,\r\nhe could not have conceived of any other issue than a brief discussion\r\nof some departmental matter. Only a few weeks before he had, with\r\nAdams’s knowledge, arranged for a house at Georgetown, and for the\r\nremoval of his family thither.[1739] As he had surmised, the subject\r\nwhich had summoned him to the conference was a minor matter relating to\r\nthe appointment of a purveyor. This was satisfactorily disposed of. Was\r\nthere something smug or offensive in the manner of Hamilton’s messenger\r\nthat suddenly enraged the old man, smarting under the sting of the\r\ndefeat in New York? Suddenly he began to talk of McHenry’s derelictions,\r\nhis anger rising, his color mounting, his voice ringing with unrepressed\r\nrage. McHenry thought him ‘mad.’ Washington, said Adams, had saddled him\r\nwith three Secretaries, Pickering, Wolcott, and McHenry. The latter had\r\nrefused to give a commission to the only elector in North Carolina who\r\nhad voted for Adams. He had influenced Washington to insist on giving\r\nHamilton the preference over Knox--which was true. In a report to\r\nCongress, McHenry had eulogized Washington and sought to praise\r\nHamilton--the President’s enemy. He had urged the suspension of the\r\nmission to France. The old man was spluttering with fury, and his\r\ndisloyal Secretary was dumb with amazement. It was time for him to\r\nresign. McHenry beat a hasty retreat, returned to his office, prepared\r\nhis resignation, which in decency should have been voluntarily submitted\r\nlong before, and sent it in the next morning.[1740]\r\n\r\nHaving set himself to the task of ridding his household of his enemies,\r\nAdams bethought himself of Pickering. Five days after the stormy scene\r\nwith McHenry, the austere Secretary of State received a note from the\r\nPresident inviting a resignation. This was on Saturday. On Monday\r\nmorning, Pickering went to his office as usual, having been long\r\naccustomed to ignoring or thwarting the wishes of his chief, and sent a\r\nletter dealing, strangely enough, with his pecuniary embarrassments, and\r\nrefusing to resign.[1741] The letter had not been sent an hour before an\r\nanswer was in his hands. It was curt and comprehensive. ‘Divers causes\r\nand considerations essential to the administration of the government, in\r\nmy judgment requiring a change in the department of state, you are\r\nhereby discharged from any further service as Secretary of State.’[1742]\r\n\r\nHamilton, enraged at the dismissal of his servitors, hastened an\r\nastonishing letter of instructions to Pickering. He should ‘take copies\r\nand extracts of all such documents as will enable you to explain both\r\nJefferson and Adams.’ No doubt Pickering was ‘aware of a very curious\r\njournal of the latter when he was in Europe--a tissue of weakness and\r\nvanity.’ The time was coming when ‘men of real integrity and energy must\r\nwrite against all empirics.’[1743] To McHenry he wrote that ‘a new and\r\nmore dangerous era has commenced’; that ‘Revolution and a new order of\r\nthings are avowed in this quarter’; and, with something of Adams’s\r\nhysteria, that ‘property, liberty, and even life are at stake.’[1744]\r\n\r\nThe news that Adams had rid himself of his betrayers, and found in John\r\nMarshall and Samuel Dexter as successors men incapable of treachery,\r\nmade a profound impression. To Duane of ‘The Aurora’ it was a\r\nvindication. Two months before he had divided the Cabinet into\r\nHamiltonians and Adamsites, with Pickering and McHenry bearing the brand\r\nof Hamilton.[1745] Announcing the dismissals under the caption, ‘The\r\nHydra Dying,’ he described Pickering as ‘an uncommon instance of the\r\nmischiefs that may be done in a country by small and contemptible\r\ntalents and a narrow mind when set on fire by malignity.’[1746] The\r\nFederalist papers were hard put to sugar-coat the pill. The ‘Centinel’\r\ncautiously said that ‘the best men here have variant opinions on the\r\nmeasure’ of Pickering’s dismissal.[1747] Three days later, it rushed to\r\nthe defense of the humiliated representative of the Essex Junto with the\r\ncomment that the best eulogy on his official conduct was ‘the chuckling\r\nof the Jacobins over his removal’ and the assurance that he carried into\r\nretirement ‘the regrets of all good men.’[1748] The Essex Junto made no\r\nattempt to conceal their disgust. Cabot, Ames, Gore, and Pickering were\r\nsoon sending their versions to Rufus King in London. ‘You are so well\r\nacquainted with the sort of sensibility for which our chief is\r\nremarkable, that you will be less surprised than most men,’ wrote\r\nCabot.[1749] Gore wrote that the dismissal ‘produces general\r\ndiscontent.’[1750] The delicate moral sensibilities of all these\r\npoliticians were much hurt because Adams had fallen into the habit of\r\nswearing and using ‘billingsgate.’[1751] He was even speaking with\r\nbitterness of the Essex Junto and the British faction, quite in the\r\nmanner of Jefferson. It was even ‘understood’ among the Hamiltonians\r\nthat the dismissals were the price of the alliance which had been formed\r\nbetween Jefferson and Adams.[1752]\r\n\r\nBut Adams knew what he was about. He knew that a plan had been made to\r\ntrick him out of his reëlection. The scheme was bald, bold, stupid. All\r\nthe Federalist electors in the North would be urged to vote for Adams\r\nand Pinckney; in the South enough would be asked to vote for Pinckney,\r\nand not Adams, to bring the Hamiltonian Carolinian in ahead. Hamilton\r\nwas writing frankly to his friends in this vein, ready to ‘pursue\r\nPinckney as my single object’;[1753] while Gore was writing King that\r\n‘the intention of the Federalists is to run General Pinckney and Mr.\r\nAdams as President and Vice-President.’[1754] When, in July, Adams\r\nappeared in Boston at a dinner and toasted Sam Adams and John Hancock,\r\nthe much-abused Jeffersonians, as ‘the proscribed patriots,’ the\r\nHamiltonians groaned their disgust and the Democrats shouted with glee.\r\n‘This was well understood by the Jacobins whom it will not gain,’ wrote\r\nAmes.[1755] ‘The Aurora’ observed that ‘he did not give the great orb\r\n[Franklin] around which he moved as a satellite.’[1756] The rupture was\r\nnow complete. When Adams was permitted to leave Philadelphia without a\r\ndemonstration the latter part of May, ‘The Aurora’ was unseemly in its\r\nmirth. ‘Did the Blues parade? No? What--not parade to salute him “whom\r\nthe people delight to honor”--“the rock on which the storm beats”--the\r\n“chief who now commands”? Did not the officers of the standing army or\r\nthe marines parade? The new army officers are not fond of the President;\r\nhe has dismissed Timothy.’[1757]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the most consummate of the betrayers, Wolcott, unsuspected\r\nstill, remained within the fort to signal to Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt was common knowledge early in the spring that Hamilton would exert\r\nhis ingenuity to defeat Adams by hook or crook. ‘The Aurora’ declared,\r\nMarch 12th, that ‘the party with Alexander Hamilton at their head have\r\ndetermined to defeat Adams in the approaching elections.’ The watchful\r\neye of the suspicious Adams, who felt the treachery, unquestionably read\r\nthe article and heard the gossip. When, after the death of Washington,\r\nthe Cincinnati met in New York to select Hamilton as the head of the\r\norder, Adams was informed that his enemy had electioneered against him\r\namong the members. He heard particularly of the action of ‘the learned\r\nand pious Doctors Dwight and Babcock, who ... were attending as two\r\nreverend knights of the order, with their blue ribbons and bright eagles\r\nat their sable button-holes,’ in saying repeatedly in the room where the\r\nsociety met, ‘We must sacrifice Adams,’ ‘We must sacrifice Adams.’\r\n\r\nThus, when in June, Hamilton, under the pretext of disbanding the army\r\nin person, fared forth in his carriage on a tour of the New England\r\nStates, no one doubted the political character of his mission. His\r\npurpose was to prevail upon the leaders to give unanimous support to\r\nPinckney and to drop a few Adams votes, or, that impossible, to give\r\nPinckney the same support as Adams. The records of this dramatic journey\r\nare meager enough. It is known that in New Hampshire he talked with\r\nGovernor Gilman, who was the popular leader, and ‘took pains’ to impress\r\nupon him ‘the errors and the defects of Mr. Adams and of the danger that\r\ncandidate cannot prevail by mere Federal strength.’ He urged support of\r\nPinckney on the ground that in the South he would get some anti-Federal\r\nvotes.[1758] In Rhode Island he evidently encountered a spirited\r\nprotest from Governor Fenner. The Governor expressed the hope that all\r\nthe electors would be Federalists, but clearly gave no encouragement to\r\nthe Pinckney candidacy, according to Hamilton’s own version of the\r\nconference.[1759] There were other versions, however, indicative of a\r\nstormy interview. The ‘Albany Register’ advised Hamilton, in giving the\r\nstory of his tour to the ‘Anglo-Federal party which wishes to make\r\nCharles C. Pinckney President,’ to ‘forget his interview with the\r\nGovernor of Rhode Island.’[1760] ‘The Aurora’ followed in a few days\r\nwith a more circumstantial story. Hamilton had ‘warmly pressed Governor\r\nFenner to support Pinckney’ and ‘the old Governor’s eyes were opened and\r\nhe literally drove the gallant Alexander out of the door.’[1761] 3\r\n\r\nBut in Massachusetts, albeit the home of Adams, Hamilton could count\r\nupon a cordial reception for his views, since it was also the home of\r\nthe Essex Junto. This was composed of the Big-Wigs of the party in that\r\nState, all ardently devoted to Hamilton, sharing in his hate of\r\ndemocracy and doubt of the Republic. For years these men had met at one\r\nanother’s homes and directed the politics of Massachusetts. They were\r\nmen of intellect and social prestige, intimately allied with commerce\r\nand the law. There was George Cabot, the greatest and wisest of them\r\nall, and one of the few men who dared tell Hamilton his faults. He was a\r\nman of fine appearance, tall, well-moulded, elegant in his manners,\r\naristocratic in his bearing, earnest but never vehement in conversation;\r\na man of wealth, and a merchant.[1762] There was Fisher Ames, brilliant,\r\nvivacious, smiling, cynical, eloquent, exclusive in his social tastes,\r\nand wealthy. There was Theophilus Parsons, learned in the law,\r\ncontemptuous of public opinion and democracy, reactionary beyond most of\r\nhis conservative contemporaries, more concerned with property than with\r\nhuman rights. Tall, slender, cold in his manner, colder in his\r\nreasoning, he stood out among the other members of the Junto because of\r\nhis slovenliness in dress. Among his friends, at the dinner table, he\r\nwas a brilliant conversationalist, for he liked nothing better than to\r\neat and drink, talk and laugh, unless it was to smoke, chew tobacco, and\r\nuse snuff.[1763] He was the personification of the political\r\nintolerance of his class. There, too, was Stephen Higginson, one of the\r\nwealthiest and most cultured merchants of his day, a handsome figure of\r\na man who took infinite pains with his toilet and always carried a\r\ngold-headed cane. Given to writing for the press, he made ferocious\r\nattacks on John Hancock under the _nom-de-plume_ of ‘Laco,’ and the\r\ntruckmen on State Street whom he passed on his way to business taught a\r\nparrot to cry, ‘Hurrah for Hancock; damn Laco.’ So intolerant and\r\nbigoted was his household that a child, hearing a visitor suggest that a\r\nDemocrat might be honest, was shocked.[1764] There also was John Lowell,\r\nable lawyer, cultured, ultra-conservative, disdainful of democracy; and\r\nthere was Christopher Gore, who amassed a fortune in speculation, and\r\nheld a brilliant position at the Bar. A striking figure he was, when he\r\nappeared at the unconventional meetings of the group, tall, stout, with\r\nblack eyes and florid complexion, his hair tied behind and dressed with\r\npowder, courtly in his manners, eloquent in speech, utterly intolerant\r\nin his Federalism, and completely devoted to Hamilton’s policies.[1765]\r\nThese and their satellites were Hamilton’s Boston friends; more, they\r\nwere the backbone of his personal organization, his shock troops. Thus,\r\nwhen he crossed into Massachusetts on his tour, he was going to his own\r\nwith the knowledge that they would receive him gladly--and they did.\r\n\r\nReaching Boston on Saturday evening, he conferred with his friends, and\r\non Sunday ‘attended divine services at the Rev. Mr. Kirkland’s.’ On\r\nMonday a dinner was given in his honor, where, the party paper insisted,\r\n‘the company was the most respectable ever assembled in the town on a\r\nsimilar occasion.’ General Lincoln presided. Higginson and Major Russell\r\nof the ‘Centinel’ were vice-presidents. Governor Strong, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the Speaker of the House, Chief Justice Dana, Ames,\r\nCabot, several members of Congress, and members of ‘the Reverend Clergy’\r\nsat about the boards. ‘The tables were loaded with every dainty the\r\nseason affords and every luxury which could be procured.’[1766] It\r\nappears that some Adamsites or Jeffersonians declined to do homage, for\r\nwe find the ‘Centinel’ commenting that ‘had a certain citizen known that\r\nGeneral Hamilton resembled his demi-god, Bonaparte, instead of refusing\r\na ticket to the dinner he would have solicited the honor of kissing--his\r\nhand.’[1767] The Hamiltonians were clearly delighted with the occasion;\r\nHamilton himself expanded and talked with freedom in the friendly\r\natmosphere. He talked for Pinckney and against Adams; and in an\r\nespecially expansive moment, dwelling on the sinister presumption of\r\ndemocracy, said that within four years ‘he would either lose his head or\r\nbe the leader of a triumphant army.’ The dinner over, the conference\r\nconcluded, he made an inspection of Fort Independence on Castle Island,\r\nand was on his way, accompanied ‘as far as Lynn by a cavalcade of\r\ncitizens.’[1768] Everything had been carried off with becoming _éclat_,\r\nfor had he not stayed at ‘the elegant boarding house of Mrs.\r\nCarter?’[1769] Unhappily the carriage in which he rode with the\r\n‘cavalcade’ broke down in the middle of the street,[1770] to the delight\r\nof the Jacobins, but his composure gave his followers much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHad not the Adamsites implied that he had received the cold shoulder\r\nelsewhere in Massachusetts we might never have known his activities\r\nbeyond Lynn. He was ‘everywhere welcomed with unequivocable marks of\r\nrespect, cordiality, and friendship.’ He dined in Salem with Mr.\r\nPickman, ‘drank tea at Ipswich,’ arrived at Davenport’s late in the\r\nevening, departed early in the morning for Portsmouth, and reached\r\nNewburyport on Sunday. That is the reason there was no demonstration\r\nthere. But there in the evening he stayed with Parsons ‘in company with\r\nsome of the most respectable gentlemen of the town.’[1771]\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton and the Junto were not soon to hear the last of that tour.\r\nThe Democrats harped incessantly on the promise to lose his head or be\r\nthe leader of a triumphant army. ‘We have often heard of a French\r\ngasconade,’ said ‘The Aurora,’ ‘but we have now to place alongside of it\r\na Creole gasconade in America. Alexander Hamilton leading an army to\r\neffect a Revolution! Why, the very idea is as pregnant with laughter as\r\nif we were to be told of Sir John Falstaff’s military\r\nachievements.’[1772] ‘Manlius’ rushed to the attack, ostensibly in\r\nbehalf of Adams, in the ‘Chronicle.’ Why this trip to ‘disband the\r\narmy’? Had Hamilton ever been in the camp before? Had he appeared ‘to\r\nplant the seed of distrust in the bosom of the troops? against Adams?’\r\nAnd what a painful effect upon the great men of Boston! ‘Your personal\r\nappearance threw poor Cabot into the shade. Even what had been deemed\r\neloquence in the smiling Ames was soon reduced to commentary; and so\r\npetrifying was your power that our District Judge has scarcely since\r\ndared to report an assertion from his Magnus Apollo of Brookline, either\r\non politics or banking.’ And lose his head or lead a triumphant army if\r\nPinckney were not elected? ‘Your vanity was more gross than even your\r\nignorance of the characters of the people of the eastern States.’[1773]\r\nTwo months later, the echoes were still heard. The Reverend Mr.\r\nKirkland, flattered by Hamilton’s cultivation and ingratiation, and\r\nyoung, not content with indiscreetly repeating Hamilton’s observations\r\nmade in company, rushed into the papers with an attack on Adams and a\r\nglorification of Hamilton. What a disgrace to the clergy, wrote ‘No\r\nPolitician,’ for this flattered youth ‘to vindicate the character of a\r\nconfessed adulterer, and artfully to sap the well-earned reputation of\r\nPresident Adams.’[1774] Even King heard from a Bostonian that Hamilton\r\n‘in his mode of handling [political themes] did not appear to be the\r\ngreat General which his great talents designate him.’[1775] But Hamilton\r\nmade his observations and reached his conclusions--that the leaders of\r\nthe first order were in a mood to repudiate Adams, but that those of the\r\nsecond order, more numerous, were almost solidly for him. He merely\r\nchanged his tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nHAMILTON’S RAMPAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFinding that persuasion had failed to shake the fidelity of the\r\nsecond-class leaders, Hamilton bethought himself of coercion. The moment\r\nhe returned to New York, he wrote Charles Carroll of Carrollton\r\nproposing to ‘oppose their fears to their prejudices,’ by having the\r\nMiddle States declare that they would not support Adams at all. Thus\r\nthey might be ‘driven to support Pinckney.’ Both New Jersey and\r\nConnecticut, he thought, might agree to the plan, since in both places\r\nAdams’s popularity was on the wane. In any event, it was not ‘advisable\r\nthat Maryland should be too deeply pledged to the support of Mr.\r\nAdams.’[1776] The effect on Carroll was all that could have been\r\ndesired. Two months later, an emissary of McHenry’s, sent to interview\r\nthe venerable patriot, found that he considered Adams ‘totally unfit for\r\nthe office of President, and would support ... the election of General\r\nPinckney.’[1777] Throughout the summer the leaders in the inner circle\r\nof the Hamiltonian conspirators were busy with their pens. Richard\r\nStockton urged on Wolcott the wisdom of making a secret fight. ‘Prudent\r\nsilence ... get in our tickets of electors ... they will be men who will\r\ndo right in the vote ... and Mr. Pinckney will be the man of their\r\nchoice.’[1778]\r\n\r\nNo one was deeper in the business than Wolcott, who, holding on to his\r\nposition, and presenting a suave, unblushing front to his chief, was\r\nwriting feverishly to the leaders of the conspiracy. While Hamilton was\r\nreceiving the homage of his New England idolaters in June, Wolcott was\r\nwriting Cabot that ‘if General Pinckney is not elected all good men will\r\nhave cause to regret the inactivity of the Federal party.’[1779] In July\r\nhe was writing McHenry that if ‘you will but do your part, we shall\r\nprobably secure Mr. Pinckney’s election,’[1780] and to Chauncey Goodrich\r\nthat good men thought Mr. ‘Adams ought not to be supported.’[1781] He\r\nwas receiving letters from Benjamin Goodhue, presumably Adams’s friend,\r\nconcerning ‘Mr. Adams’ insufferable madness and vanity,’[1782] and from\r\nMcHenry that ‘Mr. Harper is now clearly of opinion that General Pinckney\r\nought to be preferred.’[1783] In August he was assuring Ames that ‘Adams\r\nought not to be supported,’[1784] and in September ‘The Aurora’ was\r\ncharging that during that month he had declared in Washington ‘that Mr.\r\nAdams did not deserve a vote for President.’[1785] Clasping Adams’s hand\r\nwith one of his, this consummate master of intrigue was using the other\r\nto wig-wag messages to Hamilton from the window of the fortress.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton found much to disconcert him. Albeit Cabot rather boasted\r\nthat in July he had not yet paid a visit of courtesy to Braintree, and\r\nprobably would not,[1786] he was writing Hamilton that to discard Adams\r\nat that juncture would mean defeat in Massachusetts.[1787] He was\r\nopposed, however, only to an open rupture. Noah Webster, having made a\r\nNew England tour of his own, and lingered a moment under the trees at\r\nBraintree, went over to Adams bag and baggage.[1788] All but two of the\r\nFederalist papers were supporting Adams with spirit. To prod him more,\r\nthe Jeffersonian press was pouncing upon Hamilton ferociously. ‘Dictator\r\nof the aristocratical party!’ ‘Father of the funding system!’ Working\r\ndesperately for Pinckney, ‘continually flying through the continent\r\nrousing his partisans by the presence of their chief, prescribing and\r\nregulating every plan,’ was Hamilton, charged a Jeffersonian editor.\r\nAuthor of ‘a little book’ in which he ‘endeavors to give an elegant and\r\npleasant history of his adulteries,’ he added.[1789] Hamilton began to\r\nmeditate a sensational stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Jeffersonians, united, enthusiastic, thoroughly\r\norganized, confident, were waging war along the whole line. The\r\nmechanics who could vote, the small farmers, the liberals and Democrats,\r\nthe private soldiers of the Revolution who felt they had been tricked,\r\nthe small merchants, the Germans because of taxes and the proscription\r\nof Muhlenberg, the Irish because the Federalists abused them and passed\r\nthe Alien Law, were almost a unit behind their chief. All the cost of\r\nthe army and navy, and the frequent outrages of soldiers with nothing to\r\ndo, brought support. In North Carolina, Gales, in ‘The Register,’ was\r\nusing the camp near Raleigh as a veritable recruiting point for\r\nDemocrats. The eight per cent loan of that day and the Excise Law of the\r\nday before were bringing great accessions to the ranks. The growing\r\nindebtedness of the Nation, and Wolcott’s admission that another eight\r\nper cent loan would be necessary, was making converts. The scandals in\r\nadministration were creating havoc in Administration circles and driving\r\nWolcott to distraction. The scandal of Jonathan Dayton, Federalist\r\nleader of New Jersey, broke, and the hailstones beat upon the head of\r\nWolcott, who was the victim of his credulity alone. While Speaker,\r\nDayton had made written application at the end of the session of 1798\r\nfor thirty-three thousand dollars as compensation for the House. That\r\namount was not needed. Wolcott’s plea that he did not know he had given\r\nDayton more than necessary was greeted with jeers. His assertion that he\r\nhad the right to expect the unexpended balance to be immediately\r\nrefunded only met derisive laughter. Not until the winter of 1799 was\r\nthe discovery made that Dayton had retained more than eighteen thousand\r\ndollars since July, 1798. Wolcott, discovering this fraud, summoned\r\nDayton, wrote him a sharp letter, and recovered the money--but not the\r\ninterest.[1790] Meanwhile, Duane, in ‘The Aurora,’ was devoting pages to\r\naffidavits concerning Dayton’s notorious land frauds.[1791] Defalcations\r\nwere numerous, due, according to the apologists of the Administration,\r\nto ‘the difficulty of procuring men of standing and character ... to\r\nexecute their duties.’[1792]\r\n\r\nThen, to darken the picture for the Federalists, stories were afloat\r\ncorroborative of the Jeffersonian charge that they favored aristocracy\r\nand monarchy. Again Adams appeared as the champion of kingly government.\r\nSenator John Langdon, a reputable man, personally vouched in a signed\r\nletter to the truth of the charge that, in the presence of himself and\r\nJohn Taylor of Caroline, Adams had said that ‘he expected to see the day\r\nwhen Mr. Taylor and his friend, Mr. Giles, would be convinced that the\r\npeople of America would not be happy without an hereditary chief and\r\nSenate--or at least for life.’[1793] This was greatly strengthened from\r\nFederalist sources. ‘The observations of the President when he went\r\nthrough town [New Haven] last, made more Democrats than any other thing\r\nbeside,’ wrote Timothy Phelps to Wolcott. ‘He told Dr. Dana he did not\r\nbelieve the United States could exist as a nation unless the Executive\r\nwas hereditary.’[1794]\r\n\r\nThe lesser lights among the Federalists were likewise contributing to\r\nthe Jeffersonian cause. Noah Webster was being vigorously assailed in\r\nthe ‘American Mercury’ for saying that reading and observation had\r\nconvinced him that republicanism was impossible unless the poorer\r\nclasses were excluded from the vote.[1795] But the climax came with the\r\npublication of the stupid pamphlet of John Ward Fenno, who, with his\r\nfather, had been editor of the Federalist organ for years. In ‘Desultory\r\nReflections on the New Political Aspect of Public Affairs,’ he clearly\r\nreflected the views of Hamilton, to whom he referred as having been\r\npitched ‘down the Tarpeian rock of oblivion, not for subsequent\r\napostacy, but for the very deed of greatness itself.’ It was a slashing\r\nassault on Adams for making peace with France. Glorious prospects had\r\nbeen opening ‘the doors of the temple of Janus,’ but Adams had acted in\r\na ‘puerile’ fashion. The masses were denounced as ‘the stupid populace,\r\ntoo abject in ignorance to think rightly, and too depraved to draw\r\nhonest deductions.’ The patriotic Federalists were, by Adams’s action,\r\n‘by one sudden stroke in one short hour, beaten off their ground,\r\noverwhelmed with confusion, and left abandoned to all the ridicule and\r\nall the rage of their antagonists ... and nauseating nonsense, meanness,\r\nabject servility, and the effeminacy of Sybaris now reign with a\r\npomposity undisturbed even by any casual exertions of genius or common\r\nsense.’ Pickering had been dismissed because he ‘approached too near to\r\nholding a divided empire with [Adams] in the hearts of the people.’ The\r\ntime had come to ‘repudiate the author of our evils.’\r\n\r\nMore: the form of government should be changed. ‘The continent [should\r\nbe] divided into ten, fifteen, or twenty counties, to be governed by a\r\nLieutenant or Prefect appointed by the Executive; certain subaltern\r\nappointments should be in his gift. These Prefects would constitute as\r\nproper an upper House for one branch of the Legislature as could be\r\ndevised.’ The franchise should be ‘cut off from all paupers, vagabonds,\r\nand outlaws’--the poor, the democrats--and ‘placed in those hands to\r\nwhich it belongs, the proprietors of the country.’[1796] This from the\r\nman who had edited the Hamilton Federalist organ in Philadelphia. Copies\r\nwere carried about in the pockets of the Jeffersonians and worn out by\r\nreadings in the taverns.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, Federalist leaders, writers, and papers began to hint at\r\nsecession in the event of Jefferson’s election. It had become a habit.\r\nThere had been talk of secession among them if the State debts were not\r\nassumed: talk again if the Jay Treaty was not ratified. Wolcott’s father\r\nhad written his son, long before, of its desirability if Jefferson\r\nshould be elected. Four years previously the ‘Hartford Courant,’ the\r\nstrongest Federalist paper in New England, began to publish letters by\r\n‘Pelham,’ paving the way for the secession of the North. The South was\r\nbitterly assailed. There were more interesting objects than the Union,\r\nthought ‘Pelham.’ The time had come to secede. A year later, ‘Gustavus’\r\nbegan writing in the same paper on the same theme. Jefferson was\r\ndenounced as an atheist and traitor.[1797] In 1800, ‘Burleigh’ took up\r\nhis pen to advocate secession in the event of Jefferson’s election. In\r\nthis case the author was known--it was the fanatic John Allen, who, as a\r\nmember of Congress, had charged Livingston with sedition because of his\r\nattack in the House on the Alien Law. In his initial letter he urged all\r\nFederalist papers to copy, and some did. The election of Jefferson would\r\ndestroy the Constitution, result in anarchy, expel Federalists from\r\noffice, wreck the financial system, and lead to Revolution, for ‘there\r\nis scarcely a possibility that we shall escape a civil war.’ This would\r\nbe bad, but ‘less, far less, than anarchy or slavery.’ Secession would\r\nbe almost certain. Where would the boundary be? At the Potomac?--the\r\nDelaware?--the Hudson? New England might have trouble if New York and\r\nPennsylvania were included in the Northern Confederacy. ‘They are large,\r\nwealthy, powerful. They have many men of intrigue and talent among them,\r\ndesperate in their fortunes, ambitious and unprincipled.’ It would be\r\nhard to get them to join a peaceful body and keep them quiet.\r\n\r\nThese were the leading political articles in the leading Federalist\r\npaper in the most uncompromising Federalist State through the campaign\r\nof 1800.[1798] In the ‘American Mercury,’ ‘Rodolphus’ replied with a\r\nstinging rebuke. ‘He tells us,’ wrote ‘Rodolphus,’ ‘that if Mr.\r\nJefferson is elected our towns will be pillaged, our inhabitants\r\nrendered miserable and our soil dyed in blood; that we shall have a\r\nJacobin government, that the Constitution ... will fall a sacrifice, and\r\nfinally if the man of his choice is not elected, the Federal Union must\r\nbe destroyed and that the Northern States must form a separate\r\nGovernment. The writer is a Federalist indeed.’[1799]\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonians made the most of ‘Burleigh’s’ secession articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNowhere were the Jeffersonian activities more annoying to the\r\nFederalists than in New England where Federalism thought itself\r\npermanently entrenched. It had reached its peak in 1798 during the war\r\nhysteria, and the next two years were marked by a notable decline. The\r\nactivities of the defiant Democrats were intensified. Denunciations of\r\nthe ‘aristocracy’ that governed, of the political meddling of the\r\nclergy, brought the fight personally home to the leaders. In Vermont,\r\nwhere Lyon had been persecuted and his followers aroused, the stamp tax\r\nand the extravagance in government made a deep impression on the small\r\nfarmers. It was a scandal in the best regulated households that ‘Matthew\r\nLyon and his cubs’ were prowling about the highways.[1800] In\r\nMassachusetts, where Gerry had made a remarkable race for Governor in\r\nthe spring, the fight was being made in every quarter, and Ames was\r\nwailing that ‘on the whole the rabies canina of Jacobinism has\r\ngradually passed of late years from the cities, where it was confined to\r\nthe docks and the mob, to the country.’[1801] In New Hampshire, the\r\nJeffersonians had made an astonishing showing in the gubernatorial\r\ncontest in the spring, carrying a number of the towns, including Concord\r\nand Portsmouth. There, under the leadership of John Langdon, they had\r\ncapitalized the refusal of the Federalist Legislature to grant a charter\r\nto a bank which proposed to loan money in small sums, and place credit\r\nwithin the reach of the farmers and the poor.[1802] Their defeat,\r\nnotwithstanding their heavy vote, encouraged them to persevere in their\r\nattacks on corporations and the ‘privileged few.’\r\n\r\nBut it was in Connecticut that the Jeffersonians gave the Federalists\r\ntheir greatest shock by the audacity of their attacks. There the\r\nDemocrats, though few, made up in zeal and ability for what they lacked\r\nin numbers. In the home of Pierrepont Edwards, a Federal Judge and a\r\nforemost citizen, they perfected their plans for the campaign. Aaron\r\nBurr spent some time in the State assisting in the creation of a\r\nmilitant organization. A Federalist complained in a letter to Wolcott\r\nthat ‘the Democrats spent all their time and talents for eight weeks\r\nendeavoring to persuade the ignorant part of the community that the\r\nAdministration was endeavoring to establish a monarchy; and even good\r\nMr. Edwards told them he had held an important office under government,\r\nbut that he had found them so vile and corrupt, he was determined to\r\nresign the office.’[1803] Nothing could have been more distressing to\r\nthe aristocratic and clerical oligarchy which had long lorded it over\r\nthe people. The ‘Courant’ piously prayed that Connecticut would not\r\n‘exhibit the distressing spectacle of two parties rending the State with\r\ntheir reproaches and whetting their swords for civic combat,’ and held\r\nup ‘the awful condition in Pennsylvania and Virginia’ as a\r\nwarning.[1804] The ‘New York Commercial Advertiser,’ founded by a son of\r\nConnecticut, was disheartened at the effrontery of the Democrats.\r\n‘Jacobinism in Connecticut,’ it said, ‘has heretofore been confined to\r\nback streets and dark recesses; but in consequence of the successes in\r\nother States it begins to creep forth and show its hideous front in good\r\ncompany.’[1805] In September the ‘American Mercury’ of Hartford was\r\nboasting through ‘Gracchus’ that ‘in many towns where there was not a\r\nman who a few months ago avowed the cause of republicanism, the friends\r\nof liberty and the Constitution have now a majority,’ although ‘in most\r\ntowns there was a fight.’[1806]\r\n\r\nTo Abraham Bishop, the fighting leader of the Jeffersonians, was left\r\nthe congenial task of whipping the Federalists to a frenzy. A graduate\r\nof Yale, of which Dwight, popularly known as ‘the Pope of Federalism,’\r\nand a man of scholarly attainments, was President, he was invited to\r\ndeliver the Phi Beta Kappa oration at the commencement. It was assumed\r\nthat he would speak on some literary or scientific subject, but nothing\r\nwas more remote from his intentions. Very carefully, and with malice\r\naforethought, he prepared a scathing arraignment of Federalist\r\nprinciples and policies. At the last moment the clergy discovered the\r\nnature of the discourse and recommended its rejection. One indignant\r\npartisan wrote Wolcott that ‘the Society discovered the cheat before it\r\nwas delivered and destroyed its effect so far as was within their\r\npower.’[1807] The ‘Courant’ explained that when the invitation was\r\nextended, the members of the fraternity were ‘ignorant of his\r\nsentiments,’ and of the fact that ‘he had been once desired by a\r\ncommittee of the society to resign the presidency because of profanity.’\r\nThe moment it was found that the wicked man had written ‘a seditious and\r\ninflammatory libel on the religion and government of the country,’ it\r\nwas decided to dispense with the oration.[1808] But the seditious and\r\nirreligious Bishop had no notion of being robbed of an audience. The\r\n‘Courant’ reported that ‘with an impudence and effrontery known only to\r\nweak or wicked men,’ Bishop ‘proceeded at seven o’clock to palm off on\r\nthe public the production.’[1809] More than fifteen hundred men, women,\r\nand children, including some members of the clergy, heard him,[1810] but\r\nthe ‘Courant,’ looking over the assemblage, solemnly declared it as ‘a\r\nsingular fact that every open reviler of religion was there and highly\r\ngratified,’ but that the young ladies of New Haven ‘refused to grace an\r\naudience thus collected and consisting of such characters.’[1811]\r\n\r\nNo more slashing attack was heard during the campaign. The audience was\r\nsympathetic, jubilant. The orator in fine fettle, the subject to his\r\ntaste. He attacked the extravagance in government, sneered at the\r\nceremonious launching of war vessels, ridiculed the military pretensions\r\nof Hamilton. The army had not fought, but had ‘stood their ground\r\nbravely in their cantonments.’ The funding system had ‘ruined thousands,\r\nbut ... has also led up to an aristocracy more numerous than the\r\nfarmers-general in France, more powerful than all others because it\r\ncombined the men of wealth.’\r\n\r\nBut it was for the political preachers of Connecticut that Bishop\r\nreserved his heaviest fire. ‘How much, think you, has religion been\r\nbenefited by sermons intended to show that Satan and Cain were\r\nJacobins?’ Then a contemptuous fling at ‘Pope’ Dwight--‘Would Paul of\r\nTarsus have preached to an anxious, listening audience on the propriety\r\nof sending envoys?’ After all, ‘the Captain of Salvation is not so weak\r\nas to require an army and navy and a majority in Congress to support His\r\ncause.’ Then, falling into satire: ‘Let no one imagine that I would\r\nrepresent the clergy as acting out of their sphere ... for is it not\r\nsaid unto them, “Go ye into all the world and preach politics to every\r\ncreature. When men oppose ye, call them enemies of God and trample them\r\nunder your feet.” ... When the people are assembled, say to them that\r\nthe Lord reigneth on the earth in the midst of men of power and wealth;\r\nthat he delighteth in the proud, even in those who are lofty; that he\r\nwill exalt the vain, and lay in the dust they who are humble in his\r\nsight; that the great are gods; but that the little men are like the\r\nchaff which he driveth before the wind; that in the day of his power he\r\nwill shine mightily on those who are in power, and that he will make the\r\npeople under them like the hay and the stubble and the sweepings of the\r\nthreshing floor.’\r\n\r\nImmediately the speech was published in pamphlet form and sent broadcast\r\nover the country. Editions were printed in numerous towns and\r\nStates.[1812] Within a week an answer had been published in a pamphlet,\r\n‘A Rod for a Fool’s Back,’[1813] but it failed to affect the popularity\r\nof Bishop’s ‘Oration on the Extent and Power of Political Delusions,’\r\nand two months later, when he was at Lancaster during a session of the\r\nLegislature, he repeated the speech on invitation of Governor\r\nM’Kean.[1814] It was a palpable hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAnd it was a hit, primarily because it was an assault on the part the\r\nclergy was playing in the campaign. All over New England, and in New\r\nYork and Philadelphia, ministers were preaching politics with an\r\nintemperance of denunciation and a recklessness of truth that seems\r\nincredible to-day. The game of the politicians to picture Jefferson as\r\nan atheist, a scoffer at religion who despised the Church and laughed at\r\nthe Bible, was entrusted to the Ministerial Corps, which did the best it\r\ncould. It was a line of slander that had followed Jefferson from the\r\nmoment he forced religious liberty and toleration into the laws of\r\nVirginia. The only campaign canard of which Jefferson took cognizance\r\nwas set afloat by the Reverend Cotton Smith, who proclaimed that the man\r\nof Monticello had accumulated his property by robbing a widow and\r\nfatherless children of their estate while acting as their executor. ‘If\r\nMr. Smith thinks that the precepts of the Gospel are intended for those\r\nwho preach them as well as for others,’ wrote Jefferson, ‘he will some\r\nday feel the duties of repentance and acknowledgment in such forms as to\r\ncorrect the wrong he has done. All this is left to his own\r\nconscience.’[1815] But if Jefferson was content to leave to their\r\nconsciences clergymen bearing false witness, his followers were not.\r\nWhen the Reverend Dr. Abercrombie of Philadelphia gravely warned his\r\ncongregation against voting for an atheist, Duane made a biting reply.\r\n‘He is the man who opposed reading the Declaration of Independence on\r\n4th of July last,’ he wrote. ‘Need we wonder at his hatred of Mr.\r\nJefferson?’[1816] When the clergyman, stung by the attack, made a weak\r\nreply, Duane asked: ‘During the prevalence of yellow fever ... in 1798\r\non a day in the house of Mr. Richard Potter in Germantown did you not\r\nprovoke an argument in which you supported monarchical doctrines and\r\nassert that the country would never be happy until it had a king?’[1817]\r\nTo another minister, fortunately ‘the late Rev. Dr. J. B. Smith of\r\nVirginia,’ was ascribed one of the most amazing stories of the campaign,\r\nthat Jefferson on passing a dilapidated church had sneeringly said that\r\n‘it was good enough for Him Who was born in a manger.’[1818]\r\n\r\nWhen the Reverend John M. Mason published a political pamphlet under the\r\ncover of religion,[1819] accusing Jefferson of being a Deist, and the\r\nReverend Dr. Lynn of New York, actively electioneering for Pinckney\r\nagainst both Adams and Jefferson at the instance of Hamilton, printed\r\nanother,[1820] a Democratic pamphlet appeared declaring that ‘Jefferson\r\nis as good a Christian as Adams,’ and charging that ‘Pope’ Dwight, ten\r\nyears before, had published a poem, ‘The Triumph of Infidelity,’ in\r\nwhich he named Pinckney as a Deist. In this pamphlet[1821] Dr. Lynn was\r\nhandled as roughly as the Philadelphia pulpit politician. Had he not\r\ncalled on a Democrat while electioneering for Pinckney and been forced\r\nto admit that Jefferson was a good man? Had he not, when pressed, been\r\nforced to concede that Pinckney was a Deist? Had not the wife of the\r\nDemocrat indignantly taken the clergyman to task for his ‘partiality to\r\na self-confessed adulterer?’\r\n\r\nIf the Jeffersonians were attacking the political preachers with\r\nmeat-axe and artillery, they were not without provocation enough. In\r\nConnecticut, these ministers were the backbone of the Federalist Party\r\nmachine, with Dwight as their leader, than whom none more offensively\r\nintolerant ever breathed curses on a foe. In Massachusetts, when the\r\nReverend Ebenezer Bradford espoused the cause of democracy, he was\r\nferociously abused by his fellow ministers and the Federalist papers,\r\nostracized in the name of Christ by his fellow clergymen, and refused a\r\npulpit in Essex County. It was not a time when ministers in some\r\nsections were making much of the action of Christ in seeking his\r\ndisciples among workers and fishermen.[1822] The feeling of many of\r\nthese was expressed by the Reverend David Osgood when, speaking of the\r\nmasses, he said that ‘they may know enough for the places and stations\r\nto which Providence has assigned them; may be good and worthy members\r\nof the community, provided they would be content to move in their own\r\nsphere and not meddle with things too high for them.’[1823]\r\n\r\nIn one pamphlet the case against Jefferson’s religion was set forth in\r\ndetail--he questioned the story of the Deluge; did not believe the Bible\r\nin its entirety was inspired; and was opposed to teaching the Bible in\r\nthe public schools. ‘No one, I believe,’ wrote this distressed\r\nChristian, ‘has openly and publicly asserted that Jefferson is a\r\nChristian.’[1824] Soon a pamphlet in defense was in circulation. ‘Read,\r\nye fanatics, bigots, hypocrites ... and you base calumniators whose\r\nefforts to traduce are the involuntary tribute of envy to a character\r\nmore pure than your own--read and learn and practice the religion of\r\nJefferson as displayed in the sublime truth and inspired language of his\r\never memorable “act establishing religious liberty.” Read his views on\r\nslavery in his “Notes on Virginia”--“I tremble for my country when I\r\nreflect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.”’[1825]\r\nThe ‘Chronicle’ was amused to observe ‘the characters who are professed\r\nchampions of religious zeal.’ Who were they? ‘What shall we say of a\r\nfaction that has at its head a confessed and professed adulterer?... In\r\nconnection with this Saint we have a group of zealots, consisting of\r\ngamblers, bankrupts, Saturday evening carousers, or, to comprise the\r\nwhole in one general appellation, a British Essex Junto intermixed with\r\na few clerical hypocrites who have formed an alliance, offensive and\r\ndefensive, to calumniate Mr. Jefferson.’[1826] The ‘American Mercury’\r\ndwelt on contributions made by Jefferson to the Church and to needy\r\nclergymen. ‘Thus while Mr. Jefferson is ... practicing the blessed\r\nreligion of Jesus Christ by acts of charity and benevolence ... these\r\npolitical parsons are abusing that holy religion and profaning the\r\ntemple of God by fulminating lies and slander against Mr.\r\nJefferson.’[1827]\r\n\r\nThus through the summer and autumn and into the winter the political\r\npreachers continued their assaults, and the Jeffersonians replied\r\nwithout undue reverence for the cloth. Everywhere the Federalist leaders\r\nwere assuming a pious pose, even Sedgwick and Ames and Otis were\r\nbecoming religious, and the Democrats greeted their pose with ribald\r\nmirth. Into an amusing imaginary diary of Jonathan Dayton of the soiled\r\nreputation, Duane was writing the notation: ‘Went to church--must go to\r\nchurch--Federalists must be pious--‘twill do a great deal of\r\ngood.’[1828] When an appeal was made to Catholics to vote against\r\nJefferson, Duane dryly commented: ‘We presume the ... reason to be that\r\nit was owing to Mr. Jefferson that the Catholic priest was saved from\r\nbeing hanged for going into ... Virginia ... and that to his toleration\r\nlaw it was owing that the Catholic can now build churches and adore God\r\nwithout incurring penalties of fine and imprisonment.’[1829]\r\n\r\nThus religion in virulent form fought with politics in the campaign of\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut this sort of fighting and sniping was not working to the\r\ndisadvantage of Adams--and that was of some concern to Hamilton, who had\r\nconcluded that he would be happier under the presidency of Jefferson\r\nthan under a continuation of Adams. Scurrility there was in abundance,\r\nbut Adams suffered little. Occasional references were made to his\r\nvanity, his love of pomp, his partiality to titles, and to his writings\r\nas evidence of monarchical tendencies, but these were mild enough. With\r\nthe political preachers and editors abusing Jefferson, and with the\r\nDemocrats attacking Hamilton, it was time for some one to assault\r\nAdams--and Hamilton delegated himself to the task. During the summer,\r\nAdams, smarting under the discovery of the treachery of his party\r\nassociates, had been freely talking in unguarded conversation of an\r\n‘English party,’ and naming Hamilton and his friends. This furnished the\r\npretext.\r\n\r\nOn the first of August, Hamilton wrote a note to Adams asking a\r\nverification or denial of the report that he had said there was a\r\nBritish faction with Hamilton at the head. This was sent to Cabot for\r\ntransmission to Braintree. The cunning leader of the Essex Junto, in\r\nacknowledging the receipt of the letter, suggested that perhaps the\r\nelection of Jefferson would be necessary for the reunification of the\r\nFederalist Party. Were Pinckney chosen, he would encounter the venomous\r\nhostility of the Adamsites. How would it do for the Federalists to throw\r\ntheir support to Burr? Many Federalists favored such action.[1830] Adams\r\nignored the letter from Hamilton, as the latter unquestionably supposed\r\nhe would. Two days after its transmission and before it could have\r\npossibly reached the President, Hamilton wrote Wolcott of his\r\n‘impatience’ at the latter’s delay in sending the ‘statement of facts\r\nwhich you promised me.’ The trusted member of Adams’s official family\r\nhad promised his chief’s most bitter foe the ammunition for attack. It\r\nwas plain, said Hamilton, working on Wolcott’s fears, that unless\r\nsomething were done the Adams faction ‘will completely run us down in\r\npublic opinion.’ Had not Wolcott’s name been bandied about with\r\nHamilton’s as a member of the British party?[1831]\r\n\r\nLater in the month he wrote McHenry, then nursing his wrath in\r\nretirement, of his plan to publish a pamphlet defending himself and\r\nfriends and attacking Adams. He was prepared to put his name to it, but\r\nthis he could not do without ‘its being conclusively inferred that as to\r\nevery material fact I must have derived my information from members of\r\nthe Administration.’ To both McHenry and Wolcott he sent a copy of the\r\nletter.[1832] At the moment he wrote, he was having difficulty with some\r\nof his advisers. Cabot and Ames had discussed the wisdom of Hamilton’s\r\nputting his name to the pamphlet, and both agreed it would be\r\nindiscreet. It should be remembered that Adams might be reëlected.\r\nHamilton’s sponsorship of the pamphlet would give it force with men who\r\nneeded no conversion, while with his enemies ‘it would be converted into\r\nnew proof that you are a dangerous man.’[1833] A month later, Hamilton\r\nwas still in doubt about affixing his name, but evidently anxious for\r\nencouragement to do so. Thus he wrote Wolcott that ‘anonymous\r\npublications cannot affect anything,’ but that ‘some of the most\r\ndelicate of the facts stated I hold from the three ministers, yourself\r\nparticularly, and I do not count myself at liberty to take the step\r\nwithout your permission.’[1834] On October 1st, Hamilton sent a second\r\nletter to Adams, through Cabot, who, ten days later, wrote that it had\r\nbeen transmitted,[1835] but no reply was made. Nothing could have suited\r\nHamilton better. Thus the pamphlet was written and sent to the editor of\r\nthe New York ‘Gazette’ to print. It bore the name of Hamilton. It was to\r\nbe guarded from general publicity and sent only to leading Federalists\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\nAnd right here the uncanny cleverness of Burr again intervened. The\r\nsuave little black-eyed master of espionage had known Hamilton’s slate\r\nfor the Assembly within an hour after the caucus had adjourned; when\r\nHamilton’s caucus decided to ask Jay to call an extra session of the\r\nLegislature to defeat the effect of the election, the fact was heralded\r\nin the papers the next day; and now Burr was to see a copy of the\r\nprinted pamphlet before the eye of its author had seen it. Just how he\r\ngot possession of the copy will never be known. His intimate political\r\nassociate and authorized biographer merely says that he learned it was\r\nin the press and ‘arrangements were accordingly made for a copy as soon\r\nas the printing of it was complete.’[1836] Parton has a more colorful\r\nstory. Burr was an early riser, and, walking in the street near\r\nHamilton’s house one morning, he met a boy carrying a covered basket. He\r\nalways spoke to children.\r\n\r\n‘What have you there, my lad?’\r\n\r\n‘Pamphlets for General Hamilton.’\r\n\r\nWhereupon he requested and received a copy, immediately summoned Davis\r\nand two others to his house, where extracts were copied and hastened\r\nwith the utmost speed to ‘The Aurora’ and the New London ‘Bee.’[1837]\r\nThere is still another version of the general circulation that neither\r\nbiographer mentions--that of the editor of the New York ‘Gazette,’ who\r\nwas forced to an explanation in self-defense. The general circulation\r\nwas ‘contrary to the expectation ... that it would be restricted to\r\nparticular quarters. The editor of the Gazette thinks it his duty to\r\nexonerate Mr. Hamilton by making it known that the thing has happened in\r\ndirect opposition to his views. He had given the most precise\r\ninstructions that the circulation might be deferred; but the Editor,\r\nhaving been informed that by a breach of confidence or indiscretion\r\nsomewhere it was likely that extracts might appear in some newspapers,\r\ncommunicated the intelligence to Mr. Hamilton, who ... being about to\r\ndepart for Albany left a letter with a friend directing him that if such\r\na thing should happen, then to permit the letter to be thrown into\r\ncirculation.’[1838] This explanation did not appear, however, until\r\nHamilton found that the tremendous sensation the pamphlet created was\r\nnot reacting entirely in his favor. And for a sensation there was cause\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAn amazing production this, for the middle of the campaign. Adams did\r\n‘not possess the talents adapted to the administration of government.’\r\nThere were ‘great and intrinsic defects in his character which unfit\r\nhim.’ Even during the Revolution, Hamilton had entertained doubts as to\r\n‘the solidity of his understanding.’ When Adams had conducted Madame de\r\nVergennes, wife of the Foreign Minister in Paris, to dinner, and been\r\nrewarded with her comment that he was ‘the Washington of negotiation,’\r\nhe had interpreted it as an illustration of ‘a pretty knack of paying\r\ncompliments,’ when he might have said that it disclosed ‘a dexterous\r\nknack of disguising sarcasms.’ His vanity was so great that it was ‘more\r\nthan a harmless foible.’ True, Hamilton had sought to elect Thomas\r\nPinckney in 1796, but this was due to the ‘disgusting egotism, the\r\ndistempered jealousy, and the ungovernable indiscretion of Mr. Adams’s\r\ntemper, joined to some doubts of the correctness of his maxims of\r\nadministration.’ Adams’s letter to Tench Coxe, charging the Pinckneys\r\nwith being English toadies, was silly; his conduct in preventing the\r\nFrench war was infamous. This latter had come out of the vice of not\r\nconsulting his constitutional advisers--meaning Wolcott, Pickering, and\r\nMcHenry. He had thus fallen into the hands of ‘miserable intriguers’\r\nwith whom ‘his self-love was more at ease.’ With gay disregard of the\r\ntruth, Hamilton denied that there was any conspiracy to interfere with\r\nAdams’s plans at Trenton.\r\n\r\nMore amazing still, Adams was denounced for the dismissal of two\r\ntraitors in his Cabinet, and this, despite the fact that another, who\r\nremained, had furnished the writer with much of the material for the\r\npamphlet. There was no cause for the dismissals--none at all. It was\r\nonly Adams’s ‘paroxysms of rage, which deprived him of self-command and\r\nproduced very outrageous behavior.’ Pickering had been driven out\r\nbecause he was ‘justly tenacious of his own dignity and independence.’\r\nThe Adams interview with McHenry called for both ‘pain and laughter’--an\r\nincredible performance. Then followed more abuse because Adams had not\r\ngiven Fries and others to the scaffold. Then--a pitiful touch--for not\r\nappointing Hamilton commander-in-chief to succeed Washington. Here the\r\nauthor entered into more personal grievances. Having pictured Adams as\r\nan ingrate, a liar, and a fool unfit for high administrative office, the\r\nauthor concluded with the statement that because ‘the body of\r\nFederalists, for want of sufficient knowledge of facts, are not\r\nconvinced of the expediency of relinquishing him,’ Hamilton would ‘not\r\nadvise the withholding from him of a single vote.’[1839]\r\n\r\nIt was the most astounding political performance in American\r\nhistory--and the Nation rocked with mingled imprecations and laughter.\r\nEven Cabot was a little shocked. ‘All agree,’ he wrote Hamilton, ‘that\r\nthe execution is masterly, but I am bound to tell you that you are\r\naccused by respectable men of egotism; and some very worthy and sensible\r\nmen say you have exhibited the same vanity in your book which you charge\r\nas a dangerous quality and great weakness in Mr. Adams.’[1840]\r\n\r\nMajor Russell, of the ‘Centinel’ in Boston, was painfully embarrassed,\r\nand flopped about like a fish on the burning sands. In one issue he\r\nsupported Adams, and denounced the author of an attack on Hamilton’s\r\naction as ‘as well qualified for the task as a Billingsgate oyster is to\r\ncontemplate the principles of the Newtonian philosophy.’[1841] In\r\nanother issue he regretted Hamilton’s ‘ill-timed epistle,’ and denounced\r\n‘an imported renegado of the name of Cooper’ who had written Hamilton a\r\n‘saucy production’ to the effect that if he would admit the authorship\r\nof the pamphlet he would ask for his indictment under the Sedition\r\nLaw.[1842] This is evidence enough that Russell had parted with his\r\nsense of humor, else he would have appreciated the shot. The Hartford\r\n‘Courant’ contented itself by merely reprinting, without comment, the\r\nJeffersonian New London ‘Bee’s’ excoriation of Hamilton.[1843] The New\r\nYork ‘Commercial Advertiser’ was silent, but gave space to the\r\nadvertisement of a pamphlet entitled ‘A Letter to General Hamilton,\r\noccasioned by His Letter to President Adams--by a Federalist.’[1844]\r\n\r\nThe Jeffersonian papers made the most of the opportunity. The ‘American\r\nMercury’ of Hartford, announcing the arrival of the pamphlet, explained\r\nthat, ‘since General Hamilton has secured a copyright to his masterly\r\nproduction,’ only extracts could be given. It was evidently written in\r\nthe interest of Pinckney, who, having been ‘educated at the University\r\nof Oxford’ in England, ‘was naturally’ supported by the British\r\nfaction.[1845] ‘I am sorry, sir,’ wrote the author of an open letter to\r\nHamilton in the ‘Independent Chronicle’ of Boston, ‘that you have been\r\npersecuted in the manner you mention, ... but does it show a man of\r\nfortitude and independence to be continually groaning, like some feeble\r\nold woman under her troubles?... Egotism is the mark of a weak and vain\r\nmind. Here, General, you descend from your usual greatness to the level\r\nwith female vanity.’[1846]\r\n\r\nDuane, of ‘The Aurora,’ fell upon it with the zest of a kitten lapping\r\ncream: ‘John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and the Pinckneys are now fairly\r\nbefore the public,’ he wrote, ‘not in the partial drawings of their\r\npolitical rivals, the Republicans. Their claims and pretensions to\r\npublic confidence are exhibited by themselves.’[1847] The Portsmouth\r\n‘Ledger’ struck the same note: ‘If President Adams is what General\r\nHamilton and the Essex Junto represent him, and if Charles Cotesworth\r\nPinckney is what President Adams in his letter to Tench Coxe has\r\nrepresented him, viz., a British partisan--can any one hesitate to say\r\nthat Mr. Jefferson is the most suitable of the three for\r\nPresident?’[1848]\r\n\r\nBut the most telling reply appeared in a pamphlet ascribed to James\r\nCheetham, the New York editor.[1849] Of course Hamilton was a\r\nmonarchist, it said. It had been ‘a thousand times reiterated from New\r\nHampshire to Georgia.’ The Madame de Vergennes incident? ‘Your\r\nreferences to a certain private journal of Mr. Adams was surpassingly\r\nbrutal and low. They demonstrate the imbecility of your cause and point\r\nout the base malignity of your heart.’ The Adams letter to Tench Coxe?\r\n‘Evidently written in some jocular moment.’ The cause of Hamilton’s\r\nhostility? ‘Envy, ambition, and the loaves and fishes.’ The French\r\npeace? ‘If your intrusive advice had been received, what would have been\r\nthe condition of your country? Embroiled in an unprofitable war,\r\ncommerce would have been at a stand, and the cause of liberty on the\r\ndecline. A standing army would have gluttonized on the substance of\r\nsociety.’ Adams? True, the ‘Duke of Braintree’ had ‘very slender\r\npretensions to consistency of character,’ and the Nation’s hope was in\r\nJefferson, ‘who has walked with dignity in every public and private\r\ncalling,’ whose mind ‘is illumined with science and whose heart is\r\nreplete with good’; who ‘has stood firm and unshaken amidst the venality\r\nof courts and the temptations of power.’\r\n\r\nUnder such lashings Hamilton writhed and was eager to make reply. ‘The\r\npress teems with replies,’ he wrote Pickering, ‘and I may finally think\r\nit expedient to publish a second time. In this case I shall reënforce my\r\ncharges with new anecdotes. My friends will, no doubt, be disposed to\r\naid me. You probably possess some that are unknown to me. Pray let me\r\nhave them without delay.’[1850] But his friends had no such disposition.\r\nThey had had enough. Ames wrote him scornfully of his critics, who were\r\nunworthy of notice. ‘It is therefore the opinion of your friends that\r\nthe facts stated must be left to operate on the public mind; and that\r\nthe rage of those whom they wound will give them currency.’[1851]\r\n\r\nThe Federalist Party had been split in two with a battle-axe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIts leaders realized the hopelessness of their prospects. Many did not\r\ncare. McHenry, smarting in Maryland, wrote Wolcott that the lack of\r\ncourage and initiative on the part of the leaders, and their failure to\r\nfight Adams in the open, meant defeat. What did they do? ‘They write\r\nprivate letters,’ said the scornful poet-politician. ‘To whom? To each\r\nother, but they do nothing to give direction to the public mind. They\r\nobserve even in their conversation a discreet circumspection generally,\r\nill calculated to diffuse information.... They meditate in private....\r\nIf the party recovers its pristine character ... shall I ascribe it to\r\nsuch cunning, paltry, indecisive, back-door conduct?’[1852] And for once\r\nin his life McHenry was wise and right. Unable to meet the issues, the\r\nFederalist Big-Wigs still hoped to win through sharp practice. They got\r\ntheir cue from the Jeffersonians, who, finding from the election of the\r\nyear before that the selection of electors by districts would result in\r\nthe loss of one or two in Virginia, changed the law and provided for\r\ntheir election by the Legislature. This was enough for the Federalists\r\nin Massachusetts, where district elections would have given Jefferson at\r\nleast two votes. Otis and others wrote the Speaker of the House and the\r\nPresident of the Senate to change the law and have the Legislature\r\nchoose. The change was made. Estopped from complaining by their own\r\naction in Virginia, the Jeffersonians denounced the change in\r\nMassachusetts as a trick of the Essex Junto to rob Adams and elect\r\nPinckney,[1853] and much bitterness was aroused. In Maryland the\r\ndistrict system was favorable to the Jeffersonians and the Federalists\r\nthere were importuned from without to have the Governor call an\r\nextraordinary session of the Legislature to give that body the\r\npower.[1854] Owing to the almost equal strength of the parties in that\r\nState, however, the leaders were afraid to act, and a series of letters\r\nappeared, first in the Baltimore ‘Gazette,’ and later in pamphlet form,\r\nciting the action of the Democrats in Virginia and the retaliation in\r\nMassachusetts. ‘Should the State of Maryland suffer itself to be bullied\r\nout of its rights ... by the clamors of the partisans in Virginia?’\r\ndemanded the author.[1855] ‘The Aurora’ charged that James Carroll had\r\nsaid at Annapolis that the Governor should call the General Assembly\r\ntogether to deprive the people of the right to vote for electors.[1856]\r\nBut when it came to the test the courage of the Marylanders failed and\r\nno change was made.\r\n\r\nOnly in Pennsylvania did the Jeffersonians have a real grievance. The\r\nmost sanguine of the Federalists could find no silver lining to the\r\ncloud here. Fitzsimmons complained that in Philadelphia, ‘a city of\r\n60,000 inhabitants, not a man is to be found who is fit for the station\r\nwho will accept the nomination for Congress.’[1857] The envenomed Uriah\r\nTracy, after traveling through the State, thought the outlook hopeless.\r\nM’Kean had ‘brought forward every scoundrel who can read and write into\r\noffice.’ The Democrats, ‘with the joy and ferocity of the damned,’ were\r\nenjoying ‘the mortification of the few remaining honest men.’ Tracy had\r\nseen ‘very many Irishmen’ throughout the State--‘the most God-provoking\r\nDemocrats this side of hell.’ Then ‘the Germans are both stupid,\r\nignorant and ugly, and are to the Irish what the negroes of the South\r\nare to their drivers.’ The Democrats were ‘establishing presses and\r\nnewspapers in almost every town and county in the country and the\r\nFederal presses are failing for want of support.’[1858] Under these\r\nconditions the Federalists conceived the idea of depriving Pennsylvania\r\nof any voice at all in the election--an idea not unreasonable, since no\r\nprovision had been made as to the method of choosing electors. In July,\r\nSenator Bingham had written Wolcott that there was little probability\r\nthat the State would have ‘any agency in the election,’ but in any event\r\nits vote would be ‘equalized from the preponderance which the parties\r\nreciprocally possess in the two branches of the Legislature.’[1859]\r\n\r\nIn November, Governor M’Kean called an extraordinary session. In the\r\nSenate the Federalists had a small majority; in the House the Democrats\r\nhad the advantage; on joint ballot the Democrats outnumbered their\r\nopponents. The Democrats urged a joint ballot; the Federalists laughed\r\nthe proposal to scorn. Excitement rose to fever heat. Charges were made\r\nthat Liston, the British Minister, was using money to affect the\r\nresult.[1860] The State, at the moment, was Jeffersonian, and the\r\nlegislators were deluged with petitions for a joint ballot, but\r\npetitions from the people had never impressed the Hamiltonians. These\r\nstood firm--holding the power of veto. At length they made a concession\r\nto the end that the State might not be deprived of any voice. The Senate\r\ncould select seven electors, the House eight. The Democrats writhed and\r\nraved without avail. The Federalists were relentless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY TRIUMPHANT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe final contest was staged in the new capital at Washington. It was as\r\nthough destiny had arranged a new setting for the new drama on which the\r\ncurtain was now rising. In the glamorous days of Federalist supremacy,\r\nPhiladelphia, with its wealth, its fashion, and princely houses,\r\nharmonized with the spirit of government. The aristocratic party thrived\r\nin an atmosphere of luxury. Consistency called for a stage setting of\r\nmore simplicity, in a wilderness suggesting the frontier, when the\r\ncurtain rose on the triumph of democracy.\r\n\r\nWhen that charming philosopher of cynicism, Gouverneur Morris, just\r\nelected to the Senate, reached the new capital in the clearing, after\r\ndays of bumping and hardships on the woodsy road through Maryland, he\r\nlooked about him with a smile and chuckled. Writing the Princesse de la\r\nTour et Taxis, he poked gentle fun at the new seat of government. ‘We\r\nonly need here houses, cellars, kitchens, scholarly men, amiable women,\r\nand a few other such trifles to possess a perfect city,’ he said, ‘for\r\nwe can walk over it as we would in the fields and woods, and, on account\r\nof a strong frost, the air is quite pure. I enjoy it all the more\r\nbecause my room fills with smoke as soon as the door is closed.... I\r\nhasten to assure you that building stone is plentiful, that excellent\r\nbricks are baked here, that we are not wanting in sites for magnificent\r\nmansions ...; in a word, that this is the best city in the world to live\r\nin--in the future.’[1861]\r\n\r\nTen days before Morris wrote, Mrs. Adams had reached the capital in the\r\nwilds looking older and graver, and without a ceremonious reception, due\r\nto jealousies among the socially ambitious over the choice of a master\r\nof ceremonies.[1862] After the well-traveled roads to Philadelphia, the\r\njourney to Washington had been quite enough to add to both her age and\r\ngravity. On the way from Baltimore her party had been lost in the\r\nwoods, wandering aimlessly about for two hours until rescued by a\r\nwandering negro. ‘Woods are all you see from Baltimore until you reach\r\nthis city, which is only so in name,’ she wrote her daughter. ‘Here and\r\nthere, a small cot, without a glass window, interspersed amongst the\r\nforest through which you travel miles without seeing a human being.’ Nor\r\nwas the grandeur of the President’s house entirely to her liking. From\r\nher windows she could see on the Potomac the ‘vessels as they pass and\r\nrepass.’ But a rapid survey of the large mansion with its numerous\r\ndraughty rooms, convinced her that it would require thirty servants ‘to\r\nattend and keep the apartment in order, and perform the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the house and stables.’ Not a single apartment finished.\r\n‘The great unfinished audience [East] room I have made a drying room of\r\nto hang up the clothes in,’ she wrote glumly. But--added the tactful\r\nAbigail--‘when asked how I like it, say that I write you the situation is\r\nbeautiful, which is true.’[1863] A few days later she wrote of the\r\nimpatience of the ladies for a drawing-room, but ‘I have no looking\r\nglasses but dwarfs for this house, nor a twentieth part lamps enough to\r\nlight it.’[1864] Had the disgusted Abigail fared forth for a peep into\r\nthe living arrangements of others, she might have thought herself more\r\nfortunate. But surveying the city from her point of vantage she would\r\nhave found little to tempt to a tour of inspection.\r\n\r\nEven then, it was a ‘city of magnificent distances,’ the houses\r\nseparated by miles of mud roads, not entirely free from stumps. Travel\r\nby night was precarious. Blackness impenetrable, except when the moon\r\nwas at its full, settled down over the homes and the frog ponds. Morris,\r\nhaving made an evening call, was forced to remain all night, for the\r\nroad was ‘not merely deep but dangerous to drive in the dark.’[1865]\r\nJames A. Bayard and a party of Federalist leaders, venturing forth on a\r\nreturn to their lodgings from the home of a friend two miles from town,\r\nwere caught in a storm, and the coachman losing his way, they drove\r\nabout the waste lands throughout the night, threatened every moment by\r\nthe ruts and ravines.[1866]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, stretching from the President’s house to the\r\nCapitol, bordered by miasmic swamps, did not at this time boast a single\r\nbuilding; nor would it have been possible to have lived along this\r\ncauseway ‘without devoting its wretched tenant to perpetual\r\nfevers.’[1867] From the steps of the Capitol one could count seven or\r\neight boarding-houses, one tailor’s shop, one shoemaker’s, one printing\r\nestablishment, the home of a washwoman, a grocery shop, a stationery\r\nstore, a dry-goods house, and an oyster market. And this was all. Three\r\nquarters of a mile away on the Eastern Branch stood five or six houses\r\nand an empty warehouse. At the wharf, not a single ship. From the\r\nPresident’s house to Georgetown living conditions were better because of\r\nimmunity from swamps, but the wretched roads made it all but prohibitive\r\nas a place of residence for members of Congress. Six or seven of the\r\nmore fastidious braved the distance and found comfortable quarters; two\r\nor three found lodgings near the President’s house; but the remainder\r\ncrowded into the boarding-houses on Capitol Hill. In the best of these,\r\nby sharing a room one could have attendance, wood, candles, food, and an\r\nabundance of liquor for fifteen dollars a week. However, the fare was\r\nunsatisfactory, the beef not good, and vegetables hard to get.[1868]\r\nSuch was the hair-trigger delicacy of the political situation that this\r\npacking of the politicians might easily have led to altercations and\r\nbloodshed had they not seen fit to herd together according to their\r\npolitical views. There was some gambling, some drinking, but Gallatin\r\nobserved that for the most part the members ‘drank politics’ instead of\r\nliquor.[1869]\r\n\r\nHow the dandies of the Federalist circle must have missed the royal\r\nhospitality at Mrs. Bingham’s! Pathetic efforts were put forth to create\r\nsomething that might pass for society, but so limited were the resources\r\nthat the lone church at the bottom of Capitol Hill, which had previously\r\nserved as a tobacco house, was found alluring, and women donned their\r\nfinery for worship.[1870] The Thomas Laws, who had one of the few\r\npretentious houses, organized a ‘dancing assembly’ to which many\r\nsubscribed.[1871] Mrs. Law, related to both Lord Baltimore and Mrs.\r\nWashington, who aspired to the scepter of Mrs. Bingham, was a worldly\r\nwoman, over-fond of admiration and company, and finally there was a\r\ndivorce. But at this time she drew the gayer element to her by her merry\r\nhospitality. ‘Lay down your hat, we have a fine roast turkey and you\r\nmust stay and eat it,’ she would say to a caller, and soon others would\r\ncasually appear, and an informal party would result.[1872] Callers in\r\nthe old houses in Georgetown where Southern hospitality held sway, found\r\n‘bread, butter, ham, and cakes set before them,’ and on leaving they\r\nwould likely as not carry away cake and apples in their pockets, a\r\nbottle of milk in their hands.[1873] Great was the amusement of the\r\nfashionable men and women, who had been so elegantly served at the\r\nBinghams’ by the French chef, on finding themselves jolting over the\r\ndirt roads to their lodgings with their pockets crammed with cake.\r\n\r\nThis was the Washington into which Jefferson was carried in a\r\nstage-coach for the decisive struggle of his career. Wishing to pay his\r\nrespects to Adams, for whom he felt more respect than did the\r\nHamiltonian wing of the President’s own party, he wondered if the\r\ninordinate vanity of his defeated rival would interpret the call as an\r\nattempt to humiliate him. He determined to take the chance. Entering the\r\nPresident’s house, he found Adams alone--the old man in those difficult\r\ndays was all but isolated. One glance was enough to justify the caller’s\r\nfears. In great agitation, and neglecting first to offer his visitor a\r\nchair, Adams burst forth: ‘You have turned me out; you have turned me\r\nout.’\r\n\r\nWith the gentleness of an elder soothing a hurt child, Jefferson\r\nreplied, drawing on his familiarity with the workings of the minds and\r\nhearts of men, ‘I have not turned you out, Mr. Adams; and I am glad to\r\navail myself of this occasion to show that I have not and to explain my\r\nviews. In consequence of a division of opinion existing among our\r\nfellow-citizens, as to the proper constitution of our political\r\ninstitutions, and of the wisdom and propriety of certain measures ...\r\nthat portion of our citizens that approved and advocated one class of\r\nthese opinions and measures selected you as their candidate ... and\r\ntheir opponents selected me. If you and myself had been inexistent, or\r\nfor any cause had not been selected, other persons would have been\r\nselected in our places; and thus the contest would have been carried on,\r\nand with the same result, except that the party which supported you\r\nwould have been defeated by a greater majority, as it was known that,\r\nbut for you, your party would have carried their unpopular measures much\r\nfurther than they did.’ Suffering as he was under the treachery of the\r\nHamiltonians, this softened the unhappy President’s mood. Jefferson was\r\noffered a chair. The two men, who had been intimate in Revolutionary\r\ndays and in Paris, engaged in a friendly discussion of the topics of the\r\nday, and parted with mutual expressions of respect.\r\n\r\nJefferson returned to Conrad’s boarding-house, where he had taken a\r\nsuite of rooms. It was a commodious house, standing on a hill, the\r\nprecipitate sides of which were covered with grass and shrubs in a\r\nnatural state. The windows of Jefferson’s rooms commanded a beautiful\r\nview of the surrounding country--the level plain between the hill and\r\nthe Potomac through which the tree-lined Taber wound its course; and the\r\nman of Monticello could look down from his windows on the tulip-poplar\r\ntrees, the magnolia, the azalea, the wild rose, the hawthorn.\r\nCharacteristically enough, he had gone to Conrad’s because of the charms\r\nof the scenery. There the man of the hour lived like the other lodgers,\r\nwith the exception of having a drawing-room for the reception of\r\nvisitors; eating at the common table with the others, at the foot of the\r\ntable nearest the door and most remote from the fire. When Mrs. John\r\nBrown, wife of the Kentucky Senator, insisted that he sit at the head of\r\nthe table, as the oldest man if not as the Vice-President, he waved the\r\nsuggestion aside with a smile of deprecation, and there, in the coldest\r\npart of the room, he continued until he moved into the President’s\r\nhouse. But for Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Theodorus Bailey, wife of a\r\nJeffersonian Congressman from New York, the mess table would have\r\nresembled ‘a refectory of monks.’[1874] Living under the same roof\r\nduring the hectic weeks that followed were Gallatin who shared his room\r\nwith Varnum, a Democrat from Massachusetts, Senator John Langdon,\r\nGeneral Sam Smith of Maryland, Senator Abraham Baldwin of Georgia,\r\nSenator Wilson Carey Nicholas of Virginia, his brother, the Virginia\r\nRepresentative, and the Browns and Baileys. In the impending crisis\r\nJefferson could scarcely have surrounded himself with a better board of\r\nstrategy. There we will leave him for a while to take up the threads of\r\nthe Federalist conspiracy to prevent his election and thwart the public\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhile Jefferson was calmly observing the development of the conspiracy,\r\nand Gouverneur Morris was reflecting on the absurdity of the human\r\ncomedy, Alexander Hamilton sat in his office in New York writing\r\nfeverishly to the leaders of his party. If he wrote in bitterness it was\r\nbecause he was fighting for the last vestige of his prestige as a\r\nleader. It had been ominous enough when he lost control of the party\r\ncaucus and the leaders of the second class deserted him for Adams, but\r\nnow, to his horror, he found the leaders of the first class scheming for\r\nthe election of Burr, his pet aversion, to the Presidency. This was too\r\nmuch. Through the latter part of December, the indignant sparks flew\r\nfrom his fast-flying pen as he sought desperately to dissuade the\r\nconspirators who had been his faithful servitors. On the 16th he wrote\r\nWolcott of his hope that ‘New England at least will not so far lose its\r\nhead as to fall into this snare.’ Jefferson was infinitely preferable,\r\nbecause ‘not so dangerous a man’ and because he had ‘pretensions to\r\ncharacter.’ But Burr was a ‘bankrupt beyond redemption except by the\r\nplunder of his country.’ He was ‘the Catiline of America.’ Would Wolcott\r\ncommunicate these views to Marshall and Sedgwick and reply\r\nspeedily?[1875] The next day Hamilton and his erstwhile idolater, Otis,\r\nwere both busy with their pens. The former, in an evident fever of\r\nanxiety, was writing again to Wolcott. It was incredible that\r\nFederalists should be considering Burr. Within the last three weeks at\r\nhis own table he had toasted the French Republic, the commissioners on\r\nboth sides who had negotiated the peace, Bonaparte and Lafayette. Could\r\nanything have been more monstrous? ‘Alas, when will men consult their\r\nreasons rather than their passions?’ he asked. Elect Burr merely to\r\nmortify the Democrats by the defeat of Jefferson? ‘This disposition\r\nreminds me of the conduct of the Dutch moneyed man, who, from hatred of\r\nthe old aristocracy, favored the admission of the French into Holland to\r\noverturn everything. Adieu to the Federal Troy if they once introduce\r\nthis Grecian horse into their citadel.’[1876]\r\n\r\nWhile Hamilton was writing thus to Wolcott, Otis, in Boston, was writing\r\nto Hamilton. ‘It is palpable,’ he wrote, ‘that to elect Burr is to cover\r\nthe opposition with chagrin and to sow among them the seeds of morbid\r\ndivision.’ But how open communication with Burr? ‘We in Massachusetts do\r\nnot know the man. You do. Please advise us.’[1877] Hearing a few days\r\nlater that Sedgwick was deep in the plot, Hamilton wrote him with almost\r\nhysterical earnestness. ‘For heaven’s sake, let not the Federalist party\r\nbe responsible for the elevation of this man [Burr].’[1878] Two days\r\nmore, and Hamilton was writing in New York; Harper, who had been his\r\nidolater, was similarly engaged in Baltimore. The former was writing\r\nMorris, seeking an understanding with Jefferson; Harper was writing\r\nAaron Burr, proffering an alliance. ‘Jefferson or Burr? The former\r\nwithout all doubt,’ wrote Hamilton. ‘Let our situation be improved to\r\nobtain from Jefferson assurances on certain points--the maintenance of\r\nthe present system, especially on the cardinal articles of public\r\ncredit--a navy, neutrality. Make any discreet use you think fit with\r\nthis letter.’[1879] Alas, the flimsiness of political friendship! At\r\nthat very hour Harper was writing Burr that the contest would be settled\r\nin the House. ‘The language of the Democrats is that you will yield your\r\npretensions to their favorite.... I advise you to take no step whatever\r\nby which the choice of the House ... can be impeded or embarrassed. Keep\r\nthe game perfectly in your own hands, but do not answer this letter, or\r\nany other that may be written to you by a Federal man, nor write to any\r\nof that party.’[1880]\r\n\r\nNo importunities from Hamilton were necessary in the case of Morris, who\r\nhad taken the high ground ‘that since it was evidently the intention of\r\nour fellow citizens to make Mr. Jefferson their President, it seems\r\nproper to fulfill that intention.’[1881] Such was his response to\r\nHamilton, who responded gratefully to the loyalty of one follower. ‘If\r\nthere is a man in the world I ought to hate,’ he wrote, ‘it is\r\nJefferson. With Burr I have always been personally well. But the public\r\ngood must be paramount to every private consideration.’[1882] The next\r\nday Hamilton was bearing down hard on James A. Bayard, a Federalist\r\nRepresentative from Delaware, with an excoriation of Burr as liable to\r\noverturn the government to extend his power. Was it possible that\r\nFederalists were thinking of arrangements with a man of Burr’s\r\ncharacter? ‘No engagement that may be made with him can be depended\r\nupon. While making it, he will laugh in his sleeve at the credulity of\r\nthose with whom he makes it; and the first moment it suits his views to\r\nbreak it he will do so.’[1883] At the same time he was appealing to John\r\nRutledge of South Carolina to assist in crushing the Federalists’\r\nconspiracy as ‘a service to your country.’[1884] That month, too,\r\nSenator Ross of Pennsylvania heard from New York. ‘Mr. Burr is the last\r\nman in the United States to be supported by the Federalists,’ he read.\r\nWhy not seek an understanding with Jefferson?[1885]\r\n\r\nBut as December faded from the calendar, the colossal genius of\r\nFederalism found himself in a position of pitiful impotency and\r\nisolation. Morris and Jay shared his views, but even the New York\r\nfriends of his youth, like Troup, were unresponsive, and most of the\r\nleaders, who had once responded gladly to his nod, were ignoring his\r\nfrantic efforts and proceeding with their plans. On the day he was\r\nwriting Bayard, two men knocked at the lodgings of Morris, and Robert\r\nGoodhue Harper and Senator Henry Latimer of Delaware appeared to\r\nelectioneer the delightful cynic whose cynicism held so much of wisdom.\r\nThe voluble Harper was the spokesman. Burr, he said, was his ‘intimate\r\nfriend.’ It was advisable, he thought, to elect Burr ‘without asking or\r\nexpecting any assurances respecting his future administration.’ There\r\nwas enough in Burr’s temper and disposition to give ample security ‘for\r\na conduct hostile to the democratic spirit.’ Morris listened patiently,\r\nand dryly suggested the wisdom of the House suspending its determination\r\n‘until they can have more light as to the merit and probable conduct of\r\nthe candidates.’[1886] Unable to see with the majority of his party,\r\nMorris, who had touched life at so many points and in so many places,\r\ndid not share in Hamilton’s rage. ‘Indeed, my dear friend,’ he wrote\r\nRobert Livingston about this time, ‘this farce of life contains nothing\r\nwhich should put us out of humor.’[1887] With Harper making a personal\r\ncanvass for Burr, Judge Samuel Sewall, of the Essex Junto, was urging\r\nOtis to stand for ‘a steady and decided vote of the Federal party for\r\nMr. Burr,’ because it might at any rate prevent an election--a\r\nconsummation ‘most desirable.’[1888]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Burr, pretending preoccupation with the approaching nuptials\r\nof his brilliant Theodosia, was suavely simulating, if he did not feel,\r\na distaste for the plan of his ‘intimate friend’ Harper. When the\r\nmovement in his behalf was first launched, he wrote General Sam Smith\r\nthat he would ‘disclaim all competition’ with Jefferson, that the\r\nFederalists ‘could entertain no wish for such an exchange,’ and that his\r\nfriends would dishonor his views and insult his feelings ‘by a suspicion\r\nthat I would submit to be instrumental in counteracting the wishes and\r\nexpectations of the United States.’ But eight days later, Harper had\r\nwritten him an encouraging letter on the prospects and he appears to\r\nhave followed the admonition not to reply. After that--silence.\r\n\r\nAt Conrad’s boarding-house the calmest man at the long table in the\r\ndining-room was Jefferson. He knew the plans of the opposition to\r\nprevent an election or to elect Burr, and noted the gloom among his\r\nfriends and the exultation of his enemies. He was quite calm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nJanuary found Hamilton still feverishly busy at his writing-desk. His\r\nworst fears had, by this time, been confirmed. His bosom friends had\r\nsmiled incredulously upon his protests against Burr. The conspiracy was\r\nspreading ominously. His voice had lost its potency, his sword its\r\nshimmer. Grimly he fought against fate. McHenry had been impressed with\r\nthe propaganda for Burr. A number of the Federalist leaders had escaped\r\nfrom the frog ponds of the capital to enjoy Christmas festivities in\r\nBaltimore, and from these he heard but one opinion--Burr should be\r\nsupported. Burr’s letter to Smith? These worldly Federalists laughed\r\nderisively. He would not resent being elected by Federalist votes. Even\r\nMcHenry thought that with Burr elected ‘we may flatter ourselves that he\r\nwill not suffer the executive power to be frittered away.’ Still, he had\r\nmisgivings. ‘Can we promise ourselves that he will not continue to seek\r\nand depend upon his own party for support?’[1889] It was with these\r\ndoubts in his mind that McHenry opened a letter from Hamilton, whom he\r\nworshiped. Here he found Burr denounced as ‘a profligate,’ as a\r\n‘voluptuary,’ as ‘an extortionist’ in his profession, as insolvent and\r\ndangerous.[1890] A word from Hamilton was enough, and McHenry joined his\r\nleader in combating the Federalist plans in Maryland--and not without\r\neffect. But with Senator William Hindman, who had been a supporter of\r\nHamilton in the House, nothing could be done. He was aggressively for\r\nBurr.[1891] In early January, Pickering, still pitying himself, was not\r\nshocked at the idea of Burr’s election. The suggestion that ‘the\r\nfederalist interest will not be so systematically opposed under Mr. Burr\r\nas under Jefferson’ impressed him. Then ‘in case of war with any\r\nEuropean power there can be no doubt which of the two would conduct it\r\nwith most ability and energy.’[1892]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bayard had sent a non-committal reply to Hamilton. He had\r\nfound ‘a strong inclination of the majority’ of the Federalists to\r\nsupport Burr with the disposition growing. He ought, therefore, to have\r\nstrong grounds for separating himself from the others. While their\r\naction could not bind him, it would be a painful wrench to leave them.\r\nStill, ‘the magnitude of the subject forbids the sacrifice of strong\r\nconviction.’ As the pen of Bayard traveled over the page, the\r\nconspirators were moving about him, for he wrote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.[1893] In truth, all Hamilton’s advices were disturbing.\r\nFormer Senator Gunn of Georgia, in sympathy with him, was afraid ‘some\r\nof our friends have committed themselves by writing improperly to\r\nBurr.’[1894] Even John Rutledge, while disgusted at the idea of either\r\nJefferson or Burr in the Presidency, found his party associates\r\nconvinced that ‘Burr will be the least mischief,’ and that his election\r\nwould be prodigiously afflicting to the Virginia faction and must\r\ndisjoint the party.[1895]’\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine Hamilton laying down the letter of Rutledge with a\r\nfrown, to open one which had arrived from Sedgwick in the same mail, to\r\nget a greater shock. It was a vigorous plea for Burr. The author found\r\nit ‘very evident that the Jacobins dislike Mr. Burr as President’ and\r\nthat ‘he hates them for the preference given to his rival.’ He had\r\n‘expressed displeasure over the publication of his letter to General\r\nSmith.’ Would not ‘this jealousy and distrust and dislike ... every day\r\nmore and more increase and more and more widen the breach between them?’\r\nWould not the election of Burr by the Federalists cause ‘incurable’\r\nwounds? Then again, ‘to what evils should we expose ourselves by the\r\nchoice of Burr, which we should escape by the election of Jefferson?’\r\nTrue, given an opportunity, Burr would be more likely to become a\r\n‘usurper’--but what of that?[1896]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, in the middle of the month, the Federalists met to\r\ndetermine on their course. The caucus was not entirely harmonious, but\r\nthe Burr sentiment was overwhelming. Shocked and inwardly enraged at the\r\ndisaffection of his friends, Hamilton now redoubled his efforts, and in\r\na ‘very, very confidential’ letter to Bayard dissected the character of\r\nBurr, demolished the arguments of his Federalist supporters, and\r\npronounced Jefferson far superior in real ability. To this he gave a\r\npersonal touch--something he had hitherto held back. ‘It is past all\r\ndoubt,’ he said, ‘that he has blamed me for not having improved the\r\nsituation I once was in to change the government; that when answered\r\nthat this could not have been done without guilt, he replied, “Les\r\ngrandes âmes se soucient peu des petits moraux”; and when told that the\r\nthing was never practical from the genius and situation of the country,\r\nhe answered, “That depends on the estimate we form of the human\r\npassions, and of the means of influencing them.” Does this prove that\r\nMr. Burr would consider a scheme of usurpation as visionary?’[1897] Four\r\ndays after sending this letter to Bayard, Hamilton was writing Morris of\r\nthe inability of the conspirators to get assurances from Burr, who\r\ncomplained that it would injure him with his friends. ‘Depend upon it,’\r\nhe warned, ‘men never played a more foolish game than will do the\r\nFederalists if they support Burr.’[1898] But Hamilton was striving\r\nagainst the basest, lowest instincts of his party. One of his Boston\r\nfollowers was writing King at this very time that he favored Burr\r\nbecause ‘his opposition heretofore’ had ‘arisen from ambitious motives,’\r\nand because he was ‘not as honest in his politics as Jefferson.’[1899]\r\nNo one was a stouter contender against Hamilton’s decent patriotic\r\nimpulses than Sedgwick, who was moved by the motives just\r\nindicated.[1900] No one knew it better than Hamilton, but he persisted.\r\n‘I never was so much mistaken,’ he wrote Sedgwick, ‘as I shall be if our\r\nfriends in the event of their success do not rue the preference they\r\nwill give to that Catiline.’[1901] Fighting desperately, Hamilton looked\r\nclear-eyed upon the repudiation of his leadership of the party into\r\nwhich he had breathed the breath of life and given the dignity of power\r\nby the prestige of his genius. Among his friends he made no secret of\r\nhis depression, admitting to them that his ‘influence with the federal\r\nparty was wholly gone’ and that he ‘could no longer be useful.’[1902]\r\nHad he created a Frankenstein to destroy not only himself but his\r\npolicies and country? he wondered.\r\n\r\nAll through that month there was only serenity at Conrad’s\r\nboarding-house in Washington. Thoroughly informed of every move made by\r\nthe enemy, Jefferson discussed the situation in the evenings with\r\nGallatin, the Nicholases, and General Smith. Such was his imperturbable\r\ntemperament that in the midst of the intense excitement he was able to\r\nwrite to one friend of a meteorological diary from Quebec, and to\r\nanother on a similar one from Natchez.[1903] His cause was in the\r\nkeeping of Gallatin, who was quietly checking up on all members of the\r\nHouse, closing his own ranks, preparing for every possible contingency,\r\nand concluding that ‘the intention of the desperate leaders must be\r\nabsolute usurpation and the overthrow of our Constitution.’[1904] Thus\r\nJanuary passed, and February came with its fateful possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAs the time for the contest approached, the village capital overflowed\r\nwith visitors of stern visage. The boarding-houses packed with members\r\nof Congress, these onlookers found lodgment in Georgetown and in\r\nAlexandria. Notwithstanding the bitterness of the fight there was no\r\ntrouble--due to stern repression. A little spark would have caused an\r\nexplosion. The American people had determined on Jefferson, and it was\r\nno longer a secret that forces were at work to defeat the public will.\r\nSome of the Federalist papers deprecated the attempt to elect Burr with\r\nFederalist votes. The New York ‘Commercial Advertiser’ made vigorous\r\nprotest in denunciation of the conspirators. ‘They are now taking the\r\nground which the Democrats have occupied and descending to the baseness\r\nof supporting their cause by railing, abuse and scurrility. Nothing can\r\nbe less politic or honorable. It is the duty of good citizens to\r\nacquiesce in the election and be tranquil. It is proper that Mr.\r\nJefferson should be made Chief Magistrate.’[1905] The same note was\r\nstruck by the New York ‘Gazette.’ ‘Many advocate the support of Mr.\r\nBurr,’ it said. ‘In matters of such importance it is idle to suffer our\r\npassions to get the better of our reason; and in statesmanship it would\r\nbe particularly culpable from such puerile motives to risk the welfare\r\nof the nation.... Bad as both these men [Jefferson and Burr] are, there\r\nis no comparison between them.’[1906] But the organ of the Essex Junto\r\nwas openly advocating Burr’s election. The ‘Centinel’ of Boston teemed\r\nwith Burr propaganda. ‘The people of New England have yet faith to\r\nbelieve that a good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, nor vice versa,’\r\nit said. ‘They think the stock from which Mr. Jefferson has sprung to be\r\nbad because his works are known to be so; and ... that whatever Mr. Burr\r\nmay be reported to be he will eventually turn out good; as he is the\r\ngrandson of the dignified Edwards, the great American luminary of\r\nDivinity, and a son of President Burr who was also a burning and shining\r\nlight in the churches.’[1907] At times it fell into verse:\r\n\r\n    ‘Stop ere your civic feasts begin;\r\n     Wait till the votes are all come in;\r\n     Perchance amidst this mighty stir\r\n     Your monarch may be Colonel Burr.’[1908]\r\n\r\nA correspondent from Washington was quoted approvingly on the plan to\r\nsupport Burr--‘the expediency of which course is so palpable to common\r\nsense ... that I am astonished any Federal man should hesitate upon the\r\nsubject.’[1909] And the ‘Centinel’ expressed the hope that it would be\r\nable ‘by Saturday next to announce either that the people will have\r\nanother opportunity to elect a Federal President; or that the House,\r\nrejecting a theoretical and experimental philosopher, will prefer, as a\r\nvery respectable member of Congress describes Mr. Burr, “a practical\r\ngentleman who will have judgment, taste and genius enough to appreciate\r\nthe usefulness of our federal fabric, and nerve enough to preserve its\r\nintegrity.”’[1910]\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt that the Federalist hot-heads were ready\r\nfor usurpation and revolutionary measures. It was known to every\r\nDemocrat of any consequence in the country. Gallatin, counting noses,\r\nhad no fear of desertions from the Jeffersonian ranks. The real danger,\r\nas the little conclave at Conrad’s saw it, was the prevention of an\r\nelection, and Gallatin was certain that, to prevent this calamity, a\r\nFederalist from Maryland and Morris of Vermont would go over to\r\nJefferson. A plan to meet this contingency was drawn up by Gallatin and\r\naccepted by the chief. More sinister still was the threat, commonly\r\nheard, that should the Federalists succeed in preventing an election,\r\nthey would pass a law placing the Presidency in the hands of Marshall or\r\nsome other official. This the Democrats were prepared to resist by\r\nphysical force. To prevent this usurpation, the Jeffersonians notified\r\nGovernor M’Kean of Pennsylvania and Governor Monroe of Virginia, who\r\nwere prepared to march troops instantly upon the capital ‘for the\r\npurpose, not of promoting, but of preventing revolution and the shedding\r\nof a single drop of blood.’[1911] A careful survey convinced Gallatin\r\nthat this scheme of usurpation would not have mustered more than twenty\r\nvotes among the Federalist members. Only Henry Lee, ‘a desperate\r\ncharacter,’ and Roger Griswold of Connecticut, a bigot, appeared to\r\nGallatin to be really favorable to such a monstrous measure. Even so the\r\nrumor spread, and it was said that fifteen hundred men in Virginia and\r\nMaryland had agreed in the event a usurper were placed in the Presidency\r\nto move on Washington to assassinate him.[1912]\r\n\r\nJefferson had other plans in view, which he conveyed only to Madison and\r\nMonroe--to call a convention to reorganize the Government and amend the\r\nConstitution, but he concealed this from Gallatin.[1913] The Gallatin\r\nplan, with its military feature, leaked out, causing some uneasiness\r\namong the conspirators, who proceeded, however, with their plans. The\r\n‘Centinel’ boasted that Federalists had no fear of Southern and Western\r\nfighters. ‘Our General [Burr] if called upon can assure them that he has\r\nseen southern regiments in former times and knows what they are composed\r\nof.[1914]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Federalists proceeded with their plans. Burr, concealing\r\nhimself in Albany, was maintaining a discreet silence, and on February\r\n1st, Jefferson wrote him a letter. At no time had he any confidence in\r\nBurr’s political honesty or reliability. During the two Federalist\r\nAdministrations he had observed that, whenever a great military or\r\ndiplomatic appointment was to be made, Burr had hurried to Philadelphia\r\nand was ‘always at market if they wanted him.’ Jefferson had thought it\r\nwise to remain rather distant.[1915] But he was too sagacious to reveal\r\nhis distrust at this juncture. He had no thought of giving Burr any\r\nexcuse for treachery, and enemies had been busy with a forged letter\r\nbearing Jefferson’s signature setting forth uncomplimentary opinions. He\r\nwrote to call attention to the forgery and denounce it. ‘It was to be\r\nexpected,’ he wrote, ‘that the enemy would endeavor to sow tares between\r\nus that they might divide us and our friends.’ If the letter was ever\r\nanswered, the reply has been lost.\r\n\r\nOn the day Jefferson sat in his room at Conrad’s writing Burr,\r\nGouverneur Morris’s morning slumber was interrupted by two visitors who\r\nwished to discuss with him the organization of Burr’s Administration.\r\n‘Laughable enough under the circumstances which now exist,’ chuckled the\r\ncynic.[1916] Two days later, still serene, Jefferson was writing Dr.\r\nCaspar Wistar of some bones recently discovered which the Doctor wished\r\nfor the museum. The candidate had taken the trouble to write Chancellor\r\nLivingston, and the reply was inspired by the latter’s letter in answer.\r\nWith the village capital crowded, with talk of revolution, usurpation,\r\nassassination, he wrote at length. Perhaps it would be better to ask\r\nonly for the bones missing from the museum’s collection, as the town\r\nwhere they were found would probably be loath to part with them at all.\r\nEven then the philosopher and scientist was not wholly lost in the\r\npolitician.[1917]\r\n\r\nIn New York, Hamilton, having gone his limit, was no longer writing\r\nletters. The indifference of his erstwhile followers had left him\r\ndepressed and bitter. Then, one day at the Tontine Coffee-House, he had\r\nan opportunity to renew his warning in the most dramatic manner. Wolcott\r\nhad resigned from the Cabinet, his treachery still unsuspected by Adams,\r\nto be wined and dined by the Federalist members of Congress in\r\nWashington, and toasted by the merchants of Philadelphia and New York.\r\nAfter the regular toasts had been given at the Tontine and volunteers\r\nwere in order, Hamilton rose, and in his most impressive manner\r\nproposed: ‘May our government never fall a prey to the dreams of a\r\nCondorcet NOR THE VICES OF A CATILINE.’[1918] ‘The vices of a Catiline’\r\nwas the one expression remembered by the diners as they poured out into\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\nThe next day the balloting was to begin. On the day of the dinner at the\r\nTontine the ‘Commercial Advertiser’ predicted the election of Burr on\r\nthe second ballot; and that same day Representative William Cooper was\r\nwriting a friend of the determination of the Federalists ‘to run Burr\r\nperseveringly’ and to ‘leave the consequences to those who have hitherto\r\nbeen his friends.’[1919] At Conrad’s boarding-house all was serene.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn a blinding snowstorm the lawmakers and spectators fought their way to\r\nthe Capitol on Wednesday morning, the 11th. Nature spread a white mantle\r\nover the crudities of the village as though to dress it becomingly for\r\nthe great day. The great plain between the foot of the hill and the\r\nriver was covered with a spotless sheet, and even the shop of the\r\nshoemaker and the home of the washwoman took on the appearance of\r\nbeauty. No one minded the storm, not even Joseph H. Nicholson of\r\nMaryland, who, though bedridden with fever, insisted on being carried\r\nthrough the storm to cast his ballot for Jefferson. The electoral votes\r\nbeing counted in a joint session of the two houses, the members of the\r\nHouse retired to their own chamber to elect a President. The crowded\r\ngallery was ordered cleared. The visitors, grumbling loudly, filed out\r\ninto the corridors. When Samuel Harrison Smith, editor of the ‘National\r\nIntelligencer,’ who had established his paper in the capital on the\r\nadvice of Jefferson, insisted on remaining, he was angrily ordered out\r\nby Theodore Sedgwick, the Speaker. Arrangements were thereupon made by\r\nthe Jeffersonians to keep Smith informed hourly of the fortunes of the\r\nfight. In a committee room off the chamber lay Nicholson on a bed,\r\nburning with fever, an anxious wife at his side to give him water and\r\nmedicine. Even the conspirators could not restrain their admiration. ‘It\r\nis a chance that this kills him,’ wrote Otis. ‘I would not thus expose\r\nmyself for any President on earth.’[1920] The stricken Democrat was not\r\nthere, however, against the wishes of his wife, who had the fighting\r\nspirit of a Spartan woman.\r\n\r\nThe first ballot found Jefferson with eight States--Burr with six--nine\r\nnecessary to a choice. Another ballot immediately--the same result. A\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh--no change. As each ballot was\r\ntaken, a teller from Maryland entered the little committee room where\r\nNicholson lay fighting the fever, his head supported by the arm of his\r\nwife. He was awakened from his fitful sleep, a pencil was put in his\r\ntrembling fingers, and with his wife’s aid in guiding the pencil the\r\nname of Jefferson was written. The pencil fell from his hand--he slept\r\nagain.[1921] At the end of the eighth ballot a motion to vote again in\r\nan hour prevailed. There was little electioneering--men’s minds were\r\nmade up. Only a buzz of conversation, some laughter.\r\n\r\nThe ninth ballot, the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\nfifteenth ballots--and no change. Darkness had long since fallen on\r\nsnow-covered Washington. Bed-clothing, blankets, pillows, had been\r\nbrought in. The Federalists had determined to hold on without\r\nadjournment. At nine o’clock the sixteenth ballot brought no change. At\r\nten o’clock the seventeenth, at eleven the eighteenth--and no change.\r\nThe motion was made to adjourn until Thursday, only to be voted down. At\r\nmidnight the nineteenth ballot was taken, with the lines unbroken. By\r\nthis time the members were slipping off to cloak and committee rooms\r\nbetween ballots to sleep, and some slept in their chairs. As a ballot\r\nwas called, it was ‘ludicrous to see them running from committee rooms\r\nwith night caps on.’[1922] The crowd in the corridors dwindled, a few\r\nstubbornly held on. Every hour a messenger waded laboriously through the\r\nheavy snow to the home of the editor of ‘The Intelligencer’ with the\r\nresults. No sleep in that house that night. When the knock at the door\r\nwas heard, the editor’s wife, her heart beating audibly, as she thought,\r\ncould scarcely open to receive the paper.[1923]\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock another ballot--then at two. Nature was beginning to\r\nclaim its toll when it was agreed not to vote again until four o’clock.\r\nAfter that the ballots were taken hourly throughout the night. When the\r\ntwenty-seventh ballot was taken at eight o’clock and the motion was made\r\nto vote no more until noon, there were no protests. The vote at noon\r\nfound the opposing lines unbroken. The House adjourned until eleven\r\no’clock on Friday--the next day.\r\n\r\nFriday: larger crowds about the Capitol. Nicholson still on his bed.\r\nWhen the twenty-ninth ballot showed no change, an adjournment was taken\r\nuntil noon on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the participants in the struggle were sending out meager\r\nreports on the results. While the first ballots were being taken on\r\nWednesday, Jefferson had written Tench Coxe: ‘For some time since, a\r\nsingle individual has said he would by his vote make up the ninth\r\nState. On Saturday last he changed, and it stands at present eight one\r\nway, six the other, and two divided. Which of the two will be elected,\r\nand whether either, I deem perfectly problematical; and my mind has long\r\nsince been equally made up for either of the three events.’[1924] Otis,\r\nwriting his wife, was more interested in the scene at the sick bed than\r\nin conjectures.[1925] Gallatin wrote Mrs. Gallatin of the results\r\nwithout comment, other than that he had slept from eight o’clock until\r\nnoon on Thursday morning.[1926] Saturday found the lines still holding,\r\nbut with the conspirators subjected to a heavy and disturbing fire from\r\noutside. An imposing petition from Federalists in Maryland had been sent\r\nJohn Chew Thomas declaring that two thirds of his constituents favored\r\nJefferson. Gallatin did ‘not know what effect they would have.’[1927]\r\nand the thing that worried the Federalists was that they knew no better.\r\nSome of these were finding the backfire distressing. Others were openly\r\ndisgusted with Burr. ‘Had Burr done anything for himself, he would long\r\nere this have been President,’ wrote Cooper of New York.[1928] It was\r\nclearly time to push the contest. Thus, on Saturday three ballots were\r\ntaken without results, and the House adjourned until noon Monday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jefferson, presiding over the Senate, surrounded by hatred\r\nand excitement, presented an unruffled front, an untouched temper. From\r\ntime to time he could hear the angry discussions of his enemies, but he\r\nmade no sign. His impartiality was beyond question. ‘A spectator,’ wrote\r\na contemporary, ‘who watched his countenance would never have surmised\r\nthat he had any personal interest in the impending event.’[1929] From\r\nthe Capitol he walked like one unconcerned back to Conrad’s, enjoying\r\nthe snow. Some of the politicians sought to wring concessions from him\r\nto gain support, but he was adamant. General Sam Smith, without his\r\nauthority or knowledge, entered into a negotiation, which had no effect\r\nbeyond furnishing the groundwork for the charge of his enemies in\r\nhistory that he had made arrangements. As far as we know he was openly\r\napproached by but one--and he was acting on the suggestion of Alexander\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\nOne day, as Jefferson was descending the steps of the Capitol, he met\r\nGouverneur Morris and they paused to exchange compliments. Differing as\r\nwidely as the poles, they had enjoyed their social contacts in Paris.\r\nThe conversation turned naturally to the contest, and Morris observed,\r\nsignificantly, that the opposition to Jefferson’s election on the part\r\nof some was the fear that he would turn all Federalists out of office,\r\nput down the navy, and wipe out the debt. All that was necessary to his\r\nelection was the assurance that none of these steps would be taken. ‘I\r\nmust leave the world to judge the course I mean to pursue by that which\r\nI have pursued hitherto,’ Jefferson replied. ‘I believe it my duty to be\r\npassive and silent during the present contest. I shall certainly make no\r\nterms, and shall never go into the office of President by capitulation,\r\nnor with my hands tied by any conditions which will hinder me from\r\npursuing the measures which I shall deem for the public good.’ The two\r\nparted in the best of feeling.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was now approaching. Public sentiment was asserting itself\r\nunmistakably, and statesmen could hear afar off the cracking of the\r\nwhips. The Jeffersonians would clearly not budge. Even Nicholson was\r\nrecovering instead of sinking under the exposure and excitement. The\r\nFederalists in their caucuses were breaking up after stormy meetings. It\r\nwas agreed that nothing was left but desperate measures, and, while but\r\nfew urged their adoption, few openly disapproved. Burr was an\r\never-increasing torment. Only his coöperation was needed, said Bayard\r\nafterward, to have won. ‘By deceiving one man (a great blockhead) and\r\ntempting two (not incorruptible), he might have secured a majority of\r\nthe States.’[1930] But Burr was in Albany, silent as the sphinx and\r\ninactive as a mummy.\r\n\r\nOver Sunday the leaders caucused and cursed. When the House met on\r\nMonday, Gallatin understood that Bayard was going to vote for Jefferson\r\nand end the fight. But on the one ballot taken on Monday, he remained\r\nwith Burr. ‘But it is supposed,’ wrote Gallatin to his father-in-law,\r\n‘that the cause of delay is to make an attempt on his party and some\r\nothers to prevail on the whole Federal party to come over.’[1931]\r\n\r\nThe conferences continued on Monday and by night a decision had been\r\nreached. Nothing could be gained by fighting for a man who would not\r\nfight. The public was in an ugly mood. Hamilton’s friends, like Bayard,\r\nwere feeling a little ashamed of themselves. On Tuesday a crowd was\r\npacked in the corridors of the Capitol and in front of the building.\r\nWeary men in petulant mood pushed their way through these farmers,\r\nmechanics, and politicians to the House. A vote was immediately taken.\r\nMorris, Federalist from Vermont, withdrew, permitting Matthew Lyon to\r\ncast the vote of the State for Jefferson. The Maryland Federalists cast\r\nblank ballots--permitting the Democrats to put their State in the\r\nJefferson column. Bayard, after much meandering, finally satisfied\r\nHamilton by casting a blank, which, being the only vote to which his\r\nState was entitled, left Delaware out entirely. And Theodore Sedgwick,\r\nin a rage, was forced formally to announce the election of Thomas\r\nJefferson. The throng in the corridors and in front of the Capitol gave\r\nway to noisy rejoicing, and the conspirators hurried to their lodgings\r\nto escape the scowls of the populace.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhile most of them hurried home, three members of the House, including\r\ntwo of the vanquished, with Thomas Pinckney as spokesman, made their way\r\nwith many jests, we may be sure, up the slushy Avenue, between the frog\r\nponds, to the President’s house to notify John Adams that his successor\r\nhad been chosen. No record of their reception remains, but the\r\nimagination can supply the want. Nor is there any record that Adams sent\r\na note of congratulation to the victor. Those were the days when ‘The\r\nDuke of Braintree’s’ morbid vanity was suffering keenly the flings of\r\noutrageous fortune.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the same committee formally notified Jefferson of his\r\nelection and was asked to convey a gracious response to the House.[1932]\r\nMeanwhile, unflurried and unhurried, he went his way, appearing in the\r\nSenate, as usual to preside, and continuing to occupy the foot of the\r\ntable at Conrad’s boarding-house. He had long since determined upon\r\nMadison for the head of the Cabinet and Gallatin for the Treasury,\r\ngigantic figures compared with those who had occupied these posts after\r\nJefferson and Hamilton had left them in the days of Washington. The\r\nother positions were filled during the two weeks intervening between the\r\nelection and the inauguration.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday before his inauguration on Wednesday, Jefferson appeared for\r\nthe last time in the Senate to withdraw from his post there in a\r\nfarewell address. There before him sat men who hated him venomously, but\r\nthe suave, serene victor took leave as though departing with sorrow from\r\na cherished circle of congenial souls. Mistakes he had probably made,\r\nbut he had sought to ‘observe impartial justice,’ and his measurable\r\nsuccess had been due to the generosity and uniform courtesy of the\r\nmembers. Could he but carry to his new station such support as he had\r\nreceived from the Senate, he would ‘consider it as commencing under the\r\nhappiest auspices.’ In tendering his ‘cordial and respectful adieux,’ he\r\nwished for all both health and happiness. With a courtly bow he\r\ndescended from the rostrum, and passed out of the chamber.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Gouverneur Morris, chairman of the committee named to make\r\nresponse, reported an answer matching the courtliness of Jefferson’s\r\nfarewell. It lamented ‘the loss of that intelligence, attention, and\r\nimpartiality’ with which Jefferson had presided, and expressed\r\nappreciation of the kindly expressions on the Senate. Then, as Morris\r\nproceeded, there was a savage wagging of heads among the die-hards, as\r\nhe read: ‘In the confidence that your official conduct will be directed\r\nto those great objects [the honor and interests of the country]--a\r\nconfidence derived from past events, we repeat to you, sir, the\r\nassurance of our Constitutional support in your future administration.’\r\nInstantly an irreconcilable was on his feet with a motion to strike out\r\nthe words, ‘derived from past events.’ The roll was called. The motion\r\nwas lost by a vote of 9 to 19. The intolerant Tracy and Ross voted with\r\nthe nine, but Morris carried some of his party with him.[1933] The next\r\nday Morris reported Jefferson’s reply--a gesture of appreciation.\r\n\r\nAs the day of the inauguration approached, great crowds began to pour\r\ninto the drab little capital from the surrounding country. In the\r\nPresident’s house and in the Senate there was feverish activity. Early\r\nin the session, the Federalists, realizing that their power was over in\r\nthe executive and legislative branches, sought to maintain themselves\r\nand provide for their favorites through the creation of many Federal\r\njudgeships. The purpose was transparent. The Democrats had fought the\r\nmeasure without avail. All that now remained was for Adams to pack the\r\ncourts with partisans as narrow and intolerant as those who had for ten\r\nyears been delivering common party harangues from the Bench. With the\r\njoyous visitors wading the muddy streets in holiday mood, with Jefferson\r\ncloseted with his friends at Conrad’s, the Senate was busy confirming\r\nthese partisan Judges, and in the Executive Department they were busy\r\nsigning the commissions. Night came--and John Marshall remained in his\r\noffice making them out.\r\n\r\nTo this drama of hate, Adams gave a touch of irony in selecting the\r\nbeneficiaries of his generosity. Wolcott had left him but a little while\r\nbefore. Through four years he had played the game of Adams’s enemies,\r\npresenting all the while a smiling countenance to his chief. We have\r\nseen him lingering on in the citadel after Pickering and McHenry had\r\nbeen thrown from the battlements, to wig-wag secret messages to the\r\nenemy in New York. But Adams had suspected nothing. Moved by an impulse\r\nof gratitude, he offered Wolcott a life position on the Bench, and that\r\nconsummate actor, smiling still, sent the assurance that ‘gratitude to\r\nbenefactors is among the most amiable ... of social obligations,’[1934]\r\nand accepted. There is something of pathos to the Adams of the sunset.\r\nSomething of pathos and inspiration, too--for, to the disgust of the\r\ninner circle of his party, he made John Marshall Chief Justice of the\r\nUnited States, and thus, unwittingly, saved the better part of\r\nFederalism from the wreckage of the temple, to fight on through many\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe morning of inauguration day found the entire nation marching in the\r\nstreets, exultant Democrats following the fife and drum, singing and\r\nshouting hosannas. Merchants locked their doors, mechanics left their\r\nwork-benches, clerks laid down their pens, farmers deserted their homes\r\nfor the towns, and from Boston to Savannah men and women celebrated with\r\nan enthusiasm not approached since the celebration of the peace in\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, the thunder of artillery ushered in the day. As it shook\r\nthe heavens, an embittered old man with a sour countenance sat far back\r\nin his coach as it bumped and splashed its way through the mire and over\r\nthe stumps of the Baltimore road, for at four o’clock in the morning\r\nJohn Adams had slipped out of the house of the Presidents and hurried\r\naway, rather than remain to extend the ordinary courtesies to his\r\nsuccessor. ‘You have no idea,’ wrote Gallatin to his wife, ‘of the\r\nmeanness, indecency, almost insanity of his conduct, especially of late.\r\nBut he is fallen and not dangerous. Let him be forgotten.’[1935]\r\nSomewhere in hiding, or in flight, was Theodore Sedgwick, Speaker of the\r\nHouse, who could not bear to witness the triumph of a foe.\r\n\r\nThat morning Jefferson remained quietly at Conrad’s, receiving friends.\r\nAs he entered the dining-room for breakfast, the wife of Senator Brown\r\nrose impulsively and offered him her seat. With an appreciative smile he\r\ndeclined and sat down as usual at the end of the table near the\r\ndoor.[1936]\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock there was a flurry among the men, women, and children\r\nstanding reverently in front of Jefferson’s lodgings, when, with a\r\nswinging stride, companies of riflemen and artillery from Alexandria\r\nparaded before the boarding-house. At noon, dressed plainly, with\r\nnothing to indicate the dignity of his position, Jefferson stepped out\r\nof Conrad’s, accompanied by citizens and members of Congress, and walked\r\nto the Capitol. As he passed the threshold, there was a thunder of\r\nartillery. When he entered the little Senate Chamber, the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives rose, and Aaron Burr, now Vice-President, left his\r\nseat--all standing until Jefferson sat down in the chair he had occupied\r\nuntil a week before. On his right hand, Burr; on his left, Marshall.\r\nOnly a little while, and Burr, arrested for treason at the instigation\r\nof Jefferson, would be tried by Marshall at Richmond.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Jefferson rose and read a conciliatory address, in a\r\ntone scarcely audible in the tiny room.[1937] ‘We are all Republicans;\r\nwe are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to\r\ndissolve this Union, or to change its Republican form, let them stand\r\nundisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\r\nbe tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.’ As he concluded,\r\nhe turned to Marshall, his Hamilton of the future. The Chief Justice\r\nadministered the oath. It was over. The festivities of ‘83 had\r\ncelebrated the achievement of the right of the American people to form\r\ntheir own government and make their own laws. The roar of artillery as\r\nthe new President emerged from the Capitol meant that the real American\r\nRevolution had triumphed, and definitely determined that this should be\r\na democratic republic.\r\n\r\nIn the streets and public-houses that afternoon there was rejoicing,\r\nshouting, singing, laughing, drinking. Even the more tolerant of the\r\nvanquished fraternized with the victors, and the wife of the editor of\r\nthe Jeffersonian organ[1938] poured tea for Gouverneur Morris, Jonathan\r\nDayton, and James A. Bayard. For the moment ‘all were Republicans, all\r\nwere Federalists.’ That night Washington saw its first illumination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLumbering along the wretched mud roads in his coach rode Adams, the\r\nreverberations of the artillery peal of the morning still hammering on\r\nhis nerves, meditating bitterly on the treachery of men.... Somewhere in\r\nhiding, Sedgwick--cursing the fates.... And somewhere in New York,\r\nAlexander Hamilton was tasting the bitter fruits of the victory he had\r\nfought to win for his greatest opponent. From his window he could see\r\nthe marching men and he could hear the pæans of triumph. The brilliant\r\nparty he had moulded was in ruins--his leadership scorned by the\r\ncrawling creatures who had shone only in the reflected light of his\r\nbrilliance. He was alone--isolated.... A little while and he would write\r\nMorris, ‘What can I do better than withdraw from the scene? Every day\r\nproves to me more and more that this American world was not made for\r\nme.’[1939] ... A few months, and he would be describing himself as a\r\n‘disappointed politician’ in a letter to Pinckney requesting melon seeds\r\nfor his garden and parroquets for his daughter.[1940] ... Four\r\nyears--and before Burr’s pistol he would fall on the banks of the Hudson\r\none tragic summer morning.... Some years more, and a visitor to the home\r\nof the retired sage of Monticello would see in the hall a marble bust of\r\nHamilton--the tribute of one great man to another.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century witnessed their Plutarchian battles; the\r\ntwentieth century uncovers at the graves at Monticello and in Trinity\r\nChurchyard--but the spirits of Jefferson and Hamilton still stalk the\r\nways of men--still fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nBOOKS, PAMPHLETS, NEWSPAPERS, AND MAGAZINES CITED OR CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\n     ADAMS, ABIGAIL. _See_ Charles Francis Adams.\r\n\r\n     ADAMS, CHARLES FRANCIS. _Diary and Autobiography of John Adams;\r\n     Works of John Adams._ 10 vols.
