From the commencement of its sessions, a portion of\r\nthe members were in favor of the daily publication of the proceedings.\r\nI was disposed to go farther and have the sessions open to the public;\r\nbut this proposition was opposed by a large majority. Strong reasons\r\nwere urged for excluding the multitude which in the excitement of the\r\ntime would have thronged the hall wherein the Conference held its\r\nsessions. But these reasons did not apply to the publication of the\r\ndebates, and a considerable minority were strongly of opinion that the\r\npeople should be informed daily, of the votes and remarks of their\r\nrepresentatives in that body.\r\n\r\nI commenced taking notes on the first day of the session. For the\r\nfirst few days, and until the reports were presented from the general\r\ncommittee, there was but little discussion, and that related to\r\nquestions incidental to the general subject. On the 15th of February,\r\nand before the committee reported, Mr. ORTH offered a resolution\r\nauthorizing the admission of reporters, which, after some discussion,\r\nby a close vote was laid upon the table. On the 18th, finding the\r\nlabor of taking notes greater than I had anticipated, and desiring\r\nthat a complete record should be preserved; I introduced a resolution\r\nproviding for the appointment of an official stenographer, who should\r\nreport the proceedings and hold them subject to the order of the\r\nConference. I urged the adoption of this resolution as strenuously as\r\nwas proper, but the feeling of the majority appeared to be still\r\nadverse to its passage, and it shared the fate of its predecessor. I\r\nthen revised the notes already taken, and finding them more complete\r\nthan I had anticipated, determined to make as accurate a report as I\r\nwas able of the general discussion. I could not then anticipate\r\nwhether such a report would be useful to the country or not; but I\r\nthought if the Conference should propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution, and these should be ultimately submitted to the States\r\nfor adoption, a knowledge of the motives and reasons which influenced\r\nthe action of the Conference as well as the construction which the\r\nmembers gave to the propositions themselves, might become of as great\r\nimportance as the same subjects were in the convention which framed\r\nthe present Constitution. I attended every session of the Conference,\r\nand, so far as my strength would permit, made as full and accurate\r\nnotes as I could, both of the action of the Conference and the\r\nobservations of its members.\r\n\r\nThese notes were carefully examined and revised immediately after the\r\nclose of each daily session. After the passage of the resolution\r\nintroduced by Mr. BARRINGER, removing the injunction of secrecy and\r\nauthorizing their publication, I determined to write them out for the\r\npress. I was engaged in this work when the rebellion commenced, and\r\nwas shortly after called to the performance of the duties of an\r\nofficial position, which for many months left me no leisure for other\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nMy notes were then laid aside. As it was known by every member of the\r\nConference that I had taken them, I was often pressed to permit\r\nselections from them to be made. These requests I invariably declined,\r\nas I desired the publication, if made at all, to be entire, as well as\r\naccurate. As time passed, these appeals became more frequent and\r\npressing, and claims were made in relation to the course of several of\r\nthe members which could only be sustained or refuted by a publication\r\nof their remarks. At length I was earnestly requested to write out one\r\nof these speeches, and after some weeks of delay consented to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of this speech, which took place about the time\r\nof the fall elections of 1863, previous to which the action of the\r\nConference had been much discussed, the desire to see a full report of\r\nthe proceedings of that body appeared to be excited anew. Letters and\r\npersonal interviews upon this subject became very numerous. I finally\r\ndetermined to take the advice of a number of gentlemen who were\r\nprominent in the convention and the country, as to the propriety of\r\nyielding to this desire, and to be guided by it. I did so, and found\r\namong them a remarkable unanimity of expression in favor of making the\r\nhistory of the Conference public.\r\n\r\nWhen this question was settled, I desired to avail myself of every\r\nopportunity to secure the highest degree of accuracy and fidelity. I\r\naddressed notes to such of the members as were accessible, asking them\r\nto transmit to me such memoranda of the proceedings of the Conference\r\nas they had preserved. The response to these letters was very\r\ngratifying; not because the materials furnished were very full, but\r\nbecause so general a purpose was shown by all the members thus\r\naddressed, to furnish me every facility and aid in their power.\r\n\r\nI have found much difficulty in determining what control each member\r\nought to be permitted to exercise over his own remarks. The most\r\nagreeable course to me would have been, to have written out each\r\nspeech and submitted it to its author for correction or revision; but\r\nto this there was a decisive objection. It would have depreciated, if\r\nnot destroyed, the accuracy of the report. Although I do not believe\r\nthat any gentleman would have been tempted to change the tenor of his\r\nremarks by subsequent events, the view of the public might not have\r\nbeen so charitable.\r\n\r\nI have therefore made my own notes the standard of authority, and have\r\nadmitted nothing into the report which has not been justified by them\r\naided by my own recollection. The manuscript has not been changed or\r\nadded to, except by my own hands. The few instances in which I have\r\navailed myself of the materials furnished by others, are distinctly\r\nstated either in the notes or the appendix.\r\n\r\nDuring the sessions of the Conference I was able to secure but little\r\npractical assistance from the members. Although many of them desired\r\nthat my purpose should be accomplished, and some were taking brief and\r\ngeneral notes, I soon discovered that an accurate report of a speech\r\nrequired an amount of labor and a degree of attention to the subject,\r\nwhich few gentlemen were inclined to give. The work, therefore, was\r\nthrown almost exclusively upon myself. Some idea of its amount and\r\nseverity may be formed when it is stated, that the sessions usually\r\ncommenced at about ten o'clock in the morning, and with a brief\r\nintermission were continued late in the evening, in one instance as\r\nlate as the hour of two o'clock, A.M. The necessity of these long\r\ndaily sessions, arose from the fact, that the Congress then in\r\nexistence terminated on the fourth of March, and but few days\r\nremained in which to discuss and perfect the report, and to submit it\r\nto that body for its action.\r\n\r\nI do not claim to have furnished a _verbatim_ report of the speeches\r\ndelivered in the Conference of 1861, but I insist that I have given an\r\naccurate account of all its official proceedings, and the substance of\r\nthe remarks made in the course of those proceedings. I think, also,\r\nthat I have preserved nearly all the propositions made in the course\r\nof the debate, and generally have presented the ideas in the very\r\nlanguage used. The gentlemen who have critically examined the report,\r\nall concur upon the question of its general accuracy, and I am content\r\nin this respect to rely upon their testimony.\r\n\r\nI have suggested these considerations simply by way of explanation,\r\nand not for the purpose of avoiding criticism. I have endeavored to\r\nfollow, so far as was in my power, the example of the illustrious\r\nReporter of the Constitutional Convention of 1787; and while my notes\r\nlack the beauty and felicity which characterize his, I trust they are\r\nnot less full and accurate. I submit them to the country as the best\r\ncontribution which I can make to its history, at a most important and\r\ninteresting period of our national existence.\r\n\r\nThe three short years which have passed since the Conference of 1861,\r\nhave witnessed singular vicissitudes among its members. Many of them\r\nhave entered into the military or civil service of the country, or of\r\nthe rebellion which it was the avowed purpose of some members of that\r\nConference to nourish into vigorous life. Death, also, has been busy\r\nwith the roll. BALDWIN, BRONSON, SMITH, WOLCOTT, TYLER, and CLAY, are\r\nno more. ZOLLICOFFER fell at the head of a rebel army. HACKLEMAN\r\nsealed with his blood his devotion to the principles he advocated\r\nupon the field of Corinth, and now, while I am writing these pages in\r\na morning of beautiful spring, when tree, and shrub, and grass, and\r\nflower, are bursting into life and beauty; from the roar of cannon,\r\nthe rattle of musketry, and the deadly storm of lead and iron, which\r\nbearing destruction upon its wings is waking the echoes of the\r\n\"Wilderness,\" comes the mournful tidings that WADSWORTH has fallen. In\r\nthat Conference or in the world, there was never a purer or a more\r\nardent patriot. Those of us who were associated with him politically,\r\nhad learned to love and respect him. His opponents admired his\r\nunflinching devotion to his country, and his manly frankness and\r\ncandor. He was the type of a true American, able, unselfish, prudent,\r\nunambitious, and good. Other pens will do justice to his memory, but I\r\nthought as I heard the last account of him alive, as he lay within the\r\nrebel lines, his face wearing that calm serenity which grew more\r\nbeautiful the nearer death approached, after having given so\r\nabundantly of his goods, now yielding his life to his country in the\r\nhour of her trial, that hereafter the good and true men of the nation\r\nwould emulate the illustrious example of his patriotism, and would\r\nprize the blessings of a free government the more highly, as they\r\nremembered that it could only be maintained and perpetuated by such\r\nexpensive sacrifices.\r\n\r\nL.E.C.\r\n\r\n_May_, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE,\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, _February 4th, 1861._\r\n\r\nCommissioners representing a number of the States, assembled at\r\nWillard's Hall, in the City of Washington, D.C., on the fourth day of\r\nFebruary, A.D. 1861, at 12 o'clock M., in pursuance of the following\r\npreamble and resolutions, adopted by the General Assembly of the State\r\nof Virginia, on the nineteenth day of January, A.D. 1861:\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, It is the deliberate opinion of the General\r\n     Assembly of Virginia, that unless the unhappy controversy\r\n     which now divides the States of this confederacy, shall be\r\n     satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent dissolution of Union is\r\n     inevitable; and the General Assembly, representing the\r\n     wishes of the people of the commonwealth, is desirous of\r\n     employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a\r\n     calamity, and determined to make a final effort to restore\r\n     the Union and the Constitution, in the spirit in which they\r\n     were established by the fathers of the Republic: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia,\r\n     an invitation is hereby extended to all such States, whether\r\n     slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite\r\n     with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present\r\n     unhappy controversies, in the spirit in which the\r\n     Constitution was originally formed, and consistently with\r\n     its principles, so as to afford to the people of the\r\n     slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of\r\n     their rights, to appoint commissioners to meet on the fourth\r\n     day of February next, in the City of Washington, similar\r\n     commissioners appointed by Virginia, to consider, and if\r\n     practicable, agree upon some suitable adjustment.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER, WILLIAM C. RIVES,\r\n     Judge JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH, GEORGE W. SUMMERS, and JAMES A.\r\n     SEDDON are hereby appointed commissioners, whose duty it\r\n     shall be to repair to the City of Washington, on the day\r\n     designated in the foregoing resolution, to meet such\r\n     commissioners as may be appointed by any of said States, in\r\n     accordance with the foregoing resolution.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That if said commissioners, after full and free\r\n     conference, shall agree upon any plan of adjustment\r\n     requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution, for the\r\n     further security of the rights of the people of the\r\n     slaveholding States, they be requested to communicate the\r\n     proposed amendments to Congress, for the purpose of having\r\n     the same submitted by that body, according to the forms of\r\n     the Constitution, to the several States for ratification.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That if said commissioners cannot agree on such\r\n     adjustment, or if agreeing, Congress shall refuse to submit\r\n     for ratification, such amendments as may be proposed, then\r\n     the commissioners of this State shall immediately\r\n     communicate the result to the executive of this\r\n     commonwealth, to be by him laid before the convention of the\r\n     people of Virginia and the General Assembly: _Provided_,\r\n     That the said commissioners be subject at all times to the\r\n     control of the General Assembly, or if in session, to that\r\n     of the State convention.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the opinion of the General Assembly of\r\n     Virginia, the propositions embraced in the resolutions\r\n     presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon.\r\n     JOHN J. CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the first article\r\n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, shall apply to all the territory of the United\r\n     States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude\r\n     thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, and provide that\r\n     slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected\r\n     as property therein during the continuance of the\r\n     territorial government, and the fourth article shall secure\r\n     to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their\r\n     slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States and\r\n     territories, constitute the basis of such an adjustment of\r\n     the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this\r\n     confederacy, as would be accepted by the people of this\r\n     commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby\r\n     appointed, by the concurrent vote of each branch of the\r\n     General Assembly, a commissioner to the President of the\r\n     United States, and Judge JOHN ROBERTSON is hereby appointed,\r\n     by a like vote, a commissioner to the State of South\r\n     Carolina, and the other States that have seceded or shall\r\n     secede, with instructions respectfully to request the\r\n     President of the United States and authorities of such\r\n     States to agree to abstain, pending the proceedings\r\n     contemplated by the action of this General Assembly, from\r\n     any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms\r\n     between the States and the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That copies of the foregoing resolutions be\r\n     forthwith telegraphed to the executives of the several\r\n     States, and also to the President of the United States, and\r\n     the Governor be requested to inform, without delay, the\r\n     commissioners of their appointment by the foregoing\r\n     resolutions.\r\n\r\n     [A copy from the rolls.]\r\n\r\n     WM. F. GORDON, JR.,\r\n       _C.H.D. and K.R. of Va._\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky, who\r\nproposed the name of the honorable JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, as\r\ntemporary Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT was conducted to the Chair by Mr. MEREDITH, of\r\nPennsylvania, and Mr. CHASE, of Ohio, and proceeded to address the\r\nConference as follows:\r\n\r\nMy warmest thanks are due to you, Gentlemen, for the undeserved honor\r\nwhich you have conferred upon me, in selecting me for the purpose of\r\ntemporarily presiding over your deliberations. We have come together\r\nto secure a common and at the same time a most important object--to\r\nagree if we can upon some plan for adjusting the unhappy differences\r\nwhich distract the country, which will be satisfactory to ourselves\r\nand those we represent. We have assembled as friends, as brothers,\r\neach, I doubt not, animated by the most friendly sentiments.\r\n\r\nIf we enter upon, and with these sentiments carry through, a patient\r\nexamination of the difficulties which now surround the Government, the\r\nresult will be, it must be, a success, earnestly hoped for by every\r\nlover of his country; a result which will establish the Union\r\naccording to the spirit of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I may say that I have come here with the earnest purpose\r\nof doing justice to all sections of the Union. I will hear with a\r\npatient and impartial mind all that may be said in favor of, or\r\nagainst such amendments of the Constitution as may be proposed. Such\r\nof them as will give to the Government permanence, strength, and\r\nstability, as will tend to secure to any State, or any number of\r\nStates, the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their rights under it,\r\nshall receive my cordial support. My confidence in republican\r\ninstitutions, in the capacity of the people for self-government, has\r\nbeen increased with every year of a life which has been protracted\r\nbeyond the term usually allotted to man. That life is now drawing to a\r\nclose, and I hope, when it ends, I may leave the Government more\r\nfirmly established in the affections of my countrymen than it ever was\r\nbefore. To this end I have always labored, and shall continue to labor\r\nwhile I live. I pray GOD that He will be with us during our\r\ndeliberations, and that He may guide them to a happy and wise\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN C. HOWARD, a commissioner from the State of Maryland, was\r\nunanimously appointed temporary Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Roll of the States was then called over, and commissioners\r\nrepresenting the following were found to be present:\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire,\r\nRhode Island,\r\nNew Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania,\r\nDelaware,\r\nMaryland,\r\nVirginia,\r\nNorth Carolina,\r\nKentucky,\r\nOhio,\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE, of New Jersey:--I am informed that a number of Reporters\r\nfor the press are at the door of the hall, desiring admittance to this\r\nConference, for the purpose of reporting our proceedings. Whatever may\r\nbe the ultimate action of the Conference in this respect, I can see no\r\nobjection to the admission of reporters to-day, for our business will\r\nrelate wholly to organization. I hope we shall admit them, and I make\r\nthat motion.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON, of Virginia:--I hope this motion will not prevail. I do\r\nnot see that any good can possibly come of giving publicity now, to\r\nour proceedings. On the contrary, in the present excited condition of\r\nthe country, I can see how much harm might result from that publicity.\r\nIt is not unlikely that wide differences of opinion will be found to\r\nexist among us at the outset. These we shall attempt to harmonize, and\r\nif we succeed, it will only be by mutual concessions and compromises.\r\nEvery one should be left free to make these concessions, and not\r\nsubject himself to unfavorable public criticism by doing so. If our\r\ndeliberations are to attain the successful conclusion we so much\r\ndesire, it certainly is the course of wisdom that we should follow the\r\nillustrious example of the framers of the present Constitution, and\r\nsit with closed doors.\r\n\r\nThe motion was thereupon, by _viva voce_ vote, decided in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nMr. MEREDITH:--I move the appointment of a committee to consist of one\r\nmember from each delegation present, to be named by the delegation and\r\nappointed by the President, who shall recommend permanent officers of\r\nthis, body, and also report rules for its government.\r\n\r\nWhich motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen were then appointed such Committee on Rules\r\nand Organization:\r\n\r\nKentucky, Charles A. Wickliffe, _Chairman_; New Hampshire, Amos Tuck;\r\nRhode Island, William W. Hoppin; New Jersey, Joseph F. Randolph;\r\nPennsylvania, Thomas E. Franklin; Delaware, George B. Rodney;\r\nMaryland, John W. Crisfield; Virginia, William C. Rives; North\r\nCarolina, Thomas Ruffin; Ohio, Reuben Hitchcock; Indiana, Godlove S.\r\nOrth.\r\n\r\nThe Conference then adjourned to meet at 12 o'clock M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, TUESDAY, _February 5th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by the Chairman _pro tem._,\r\npursuant to adjournment, and the journal of the proceedings of the\r\nfirst day was read and approved.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN, of Pennsylvania:--It is usual in bodies of this\r\ndescription to take measures to ascertain who are and who are not duly\r\naccredited members. We should have the names of all the Commissioners\r\npresent brought on to our records. I therefore move that a Committee\r\nof five be appointed by the Chairman, to whom all credentials of\r\nmembers shall be referred for examination and report.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. FRANKLIN was adopted unanimously, and the Chairman\r\nannounced as such Committee Mr. Summers, of Virginia; Mr. Franklin, of\r\nPennsylvania; Mr. Guthrie, of Kentucky; Mr. Morehead, of North\r\nCarolina, and Mr. Smith, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky:--I rise at this time for the purpose of\r\nmaking the report of the Committee on Organization. I am instructed to\r\nreport that we recommend that the permanent officers of the Convention\r\nbe a President and Secretary, and that the Secretary have leave to\r\nappoint assistants, not exceeding two in number, to assist him in the\r\ndischarge of his duties; and that the President of this Convention be\r\nJOHN TYLER, of Virginia, and that CRAFTS J. WRIGHT, of Ohio, be its\r\nSecretary. The committee also report a series of rules for the\r\ngovernment of the Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY, of Kentucky:--I move that the question upon accepting the\r\nreport be divided, and that it be first taken on that part of the\r\nreport which relates to the officers of the Convention.\r\n\r\nWhich was agreed to without objection.\r\n\r\nIt was then moved, and unanimously voted, that the part of the report\r\nrelating to officers, be accepted, and the officers designated be\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nThe President _pro tem._ then appointed Mr. EWING, of Ohio, and Mr.\r\nMEREDITH, of Pennsylvania, to conduct the President elect to the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nPresident TYLER upon taking his seat proceeded to address the\r\nConvention as follows:\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I fear you have committed a great error in appointing me to\r\nthe honorable position you have assigned me. A long separation from\r\nall deliberative bodies has rendered the rules of their proceedings\r\nunfamiliar to me, while I should find, in my own state of health,\r\nvariable and fickle as it is, sufficient reason to decline the honor\r\nof being your presiding officer. But, in times like these, one has but\r\nlittle option left him. Personal considerations should weigh but\r\nlightly in the balance. The country is in danger; it is enough; one\r\nmust take the place assigned him in the great work of reconciliation\r\nand adjustment. The voice of Virginia has invited her co-States to\r\nmeet her in council. In the initiation of this Government, that same\r\nvoice was heard and complied with, and the results of seventy-odd\r\nyears have fully attested the wisdom of the decisions then adopted. Is\r\nthe urgency of her call now less great than it was then? Our godlike\r\nfathers created, we have to preserve. They built up, through their\r\nwisdom and patriotism, monuments which have eternized their names. You\r\nhave before you, gentlemen, a task equally grand, equally sublime,\r\nquite as full of glory and immortality. You have to snatch from ruin a\r\ngreat and glorious Confederation, to preserve the Government, and to\r\nrenew and invigorate the Constitution. If you reach the height of this\r\ngreat occasion, your children's children will rise up and call you\r\nblessed. I confess myself to be ambitious of sharing in the glory of\r\naccomplishing this grand and magnificent result. To have our names\r\nenrolled in the Capitol, to be repeated by future generations with\r\ngrateful applause--this is an honor higher than the mountains, more\r\nenduring than the monumental alabaster. Yes, Virginia's voice, as in\r\nthe olden time, has been heard. Her sister States meet her this day at\r\nthe council board. Vermont is here, bringing with her the memories of\r\nthe past, and reviving in the memories of all, her Ethan Allen and his\r\ndemand for the surrender of Ticonderoga, in the name of the Great\r\nJehovah and the American Congress. New Hampshire is here, her fame\r\nillustrated by memorable annals, and still more lately as the\r\nbirthplace of him who won for himself the name of defender of the\r\nConstitution, and who wrote that letter to John Taylor which has been\r\nenshrined in the hearts of his countrymen. Massachusetts is not here.\r\n(Some member said \"She is coming.\") I hope so, said Mr. TYLER, and\r\nthat she will bring with her her daughter Maine. I did not believe it\r\ncould well be that the voice which in other times was so familiar to\r\nher ears had been addressed to her in vain. Connecticut is here, and\r\nshe comes, I doubt not, in the spirit of ROGER SHERMAN, whose name\r\nwith our very children has become a household word, and who was in\r\nlife the embodiment of that sound practical sense which befits the\r\ngreat lawgiver and constructer of governments. Rhode Island, the land\r\nof ROGER WILLIAMS, is here, one of the two last States, in her\r\njealousy of the public liberty, to give in her adhesion to the\r\nConstitution, and among the earliest to hasten to its rescue. The\r\ngreat Empire State of New York, represented thus far but by one\r\ndelegate, is expected daily in fuller force to join in the great work\r\nof healing the discontents of the times and restoring the reign of\r\nfraternal feeling. New Jersey is also here, with the memories of the\r\npast covering her all over. Trenton and Princeton live immortal in\r\nstory, the plains of the last incrimsoned with the hearts blood of\r\nVirginia's sons. Among her delegation I rejoice to recognize a gallant\r\nson of a signer of the immortal Declaration which announced to the\r\nworld that thirteen Provinces had become thirteen independent and\r\nsovereign States. And here, too, is Delaware, the land of the BAYARDS\r\nand the RODNEYS, whose soil at Brandywine was moistened by the blood\r\nof Virginia's youthful MONROE. Here is Maryland, whose massive columns\r\nwheeled into line with those of Virginia in the contest for glory,\r\nand whose state house at Annapolis was the theatre of the spectacle of\r\na successful Commander, who, after liberating his country, gladly\r\nungirthed his sword, and laid it down upon the altar of that country.\r\nThen comes Pennsylvania, rich in revolutionary lore, bringing with her\r\nthe deathless names of FRANKLIN and MORRIS, and, I trust, ready to\r\nrenew from the belfry of Independence Hall the chimes of the old bell,\r\nwhich announced _Freedom_ and _Independence_ in former days. All hail\r\nto North Carolina! with her Mecklenberg Declaration in her hand,\r\nstanding erect on the ground of her own probity and firmness in the\r\ncause of public liberty, and represented in her attributes by her\r\nMACON, and in this assembly by her distinguished son at no great\r\ndistance from me. Four daughters of Virginia also cluster around the\r\ncouncil board on the invitation of their ancient mother--the eldest,\r\nKentucky, whose sons, under the intrepid warrior ANTHONY WAYNE, gave\r\nfreedom of settlement to the territory of her sister, Ohio. She\r\nextends her hand daily and hourly across _la belle riviere_, to grasp\r\nthe hand of some one of kindred blood of the noble states of Indiana,\r\nand Illinois, and Ohio, who have grown up into powerful States,\r\nalready grand, potent, and almost imperial. Tennessee is not here, but\r\nis coming--prevented only from being here by the floods which have\r\nswollen her rivers. When she arrives, she will wear the badges on her\r\nwarrior crest of victories won in company with the Great West on many\r\nan ensanguined plain, and standards torn from the hands of the\r\nconquerors at Waterloo. Missouri, and Iowa, and Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nand Minnesota, still linger behind, but it may be hoped that their\r\nhearts are with us in the great work we have to do.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the eyes of the whole country are turned to this assembly,\r\nin expectation and hope. I trust that you may prove yourselves worthy\r\nof the great occasion. Our ancestors, probably, committed a blunder in\r\nnot having fixed upon every fifth decade for a call of a general\r\nconvention to amend and reform the Constitution. On the contrary, they\r\nhave made the difficulties next to insurmountable to accomplish\r\namendments to an instrument which was perfect for five millions of\r\npeople, but not wholly so as to thirty millions. Your patriotism will\r\nsurmount the difficulties, however great, if you will but accomplish\r\none triumph in advance, and that is, a triumph over _party_. And what\r\nis party, when compared to the work of rescuing one's country from\r\ndanger? Do that, and one long, loud shout of joy and gladness will\r\nresound throughout the land.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I move that the remaining portion of the report of the\r\nCommittee on Organization be postponed until to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. EWING was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE. I offer the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Conference shall be opened with prayer,\r\n     and that the clergymen of the city of Washington be\r\n     requested to perform that service.\r\n\r\nThe resolution offered by Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted, and prayer was\r\nthen offered by the Rev. Dr. P.D. GURLEY, of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I have received a communication from the Messrs.\r\nWillard, placing the Hall in which the Conference is now sitting at\r\nthe service of the Conference, while its sessions may continue; also,\r\na communication from the Mayor and Common Council of the City of\r\nWashington, offering police officers to attend our sittings.\r\n\r\nIt was moved, and agreed to, that these offers be severally accepted.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Maryland:--I move that the President of the Conference\r\nbe requested to furnish a copy of his address to the Conference upon\r\ntaking the Chair, that it be entered upon the journal as a part of\r\nthis day's proceedings, and that the same be published.\r\n\r\nWhich motion was unanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. GRIMES, of Iowa:--I have received from the Governor of the State\r\nof Iowa a communication, requesting myself and my colleague in the\r\nSenate of the United States, and also the members representing that\r\nState in the House of Representatives, to represent the State of Iowa\r\nhere. I desire to present his communication, that it may be referred\r\nto the Committee on Credentials.\r\n\r\nThe communication was so referred, and on motion of Mr. WRIGHT, of\r\nOhio, the Conference adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 6th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference met at twelve o'clock, at noon, and was called to order\r\nby the PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday was read, and after amendment, was approved.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials to make\r\na report. That committee has examined the credentials which have been\r\nsubmitted to it, and finds the following-named gentlemen duly\r\naccredited as members of this Conference:\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire._--Amos Tuck, Levi Chamberlain, Asa Fowler.\r\n\r\n_Vermont._--Hiland Hall, Lucius E. Chittenden, Levi Underwood, H.\r\nHenry Baxter, B.D. Harris.\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island and Providence Plantations._--Samuel Ames, Alexander\r\nDuncan, William W. Hoppin, George H. Browne, Samuel G. Arnold.\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._--Roger S. Baldwin, Chauncey F. Cleveland, Charles J.\r\nMcCurdy, James T. Pratt, Robbins Battell, Amos S. Treat.\r\n\r\n_New Jersey._--Charles S. Olden, Peter D. Vroom, Robert F. Stockton,\r\nBenjamin Williamson, Joseph F. Randolph, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen,\r\nRodman M. Price, William C. Alexander, Thomas J. Stryker.\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._--Thomas White, James Pollock, William M. Meredith,\r\nDavid Wilmot, A.W. Loomis, Thomas E. Franklin, William McKennan.\r\n\r\n_Delaware._--George B. Rodney, Daniel M. Bates, Henry Ridgely, John W.\r\nHouston, William Cannon.\r\n\r\n_Maryland._--John F. Dent, Reverdy Johnson, John W. Crisfield,\r\nAugustus W. Bradford, William T. Goldsborough, J. Dixon Roman,\r\nBenjamin C. Howard.\r\n\r\n_Virginia._--John Tyler, William C. Rives, John W. Brockenbrough,\r\nGeorge W. Summers, James A. Seddon.\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._--George Davis, Thomas Ruffin, David S. Reid, Daniel\r\nM. Barringer, J.M. Morehead.\r\n\r\n_Kentucky._--William O. Butler, James B. Clay, Joshua F.

Backus, Reuben Hitchcock, Thomas Ewing, Valentine B.\r\nHorton.\r\n\r\n_Indiana._--Caleb B. Smith, Pleasant A. Hackleman, Godlove S. Orth,\r\nE.W.H. Ellis, Thomas C. Slaughter.\r\n\r\n_Iowa._--James W. Grimes, Samuel H. Curtis, William Vandever.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I move that the Secretary be authorized to employ one\r\nor more assistants. I am advised that the Secretary cannot perform his\r\nduties without assistance, and I see no objection to giving him this\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I now desire to call up the remaining portion of the\r\nreport of the Committee on Rules and Organization, and to move its\r\nadoption at the present time. These Rules are substantially the same\r\nas those which were adopted by the convention which proposed our\r\npresent Constitution. The rule which we have reported securing\r\nsecrecy, so far as our proceedings are concerned, has been made the\r\nsubject of much discussion in the committee; and it was at first\r\nthought best to recommend a modification of it. But upon reflection\r\nand consideration, and in view of the fact that, while the rule\r\nreported requires that secrecy should be preserved in regard to all\r\nthat is said or done in this Conference, it does not prevent any\r\nmember from expressing his own hopes or predictions upon the final\r\nresult of our deliberations, we have thought best to let it remain as\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I desire to offer an amendment to this portion of the\r\nreport of the committee, which I will read for the information of the\r\nConference. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That no part of the Journal be published\r\n     without the order or leave of the Conference, and that no\r\n     copies of the whole or any part be furnished or allowed,\r\n     except to members, who shall be privileged to communicate\r\n     the same to the authorities or deliberative assemblies of\r\n     their respective States, when deemed judicious or\r\n     appropriate, under their instructions, and that nothing\r\n     spoken in the House be printed or otherwise published; but\r\n     private communications respecting the proceedings and\r\n     debates, while recommended to be with caution and reserve,\r\n     are allowed at the discretion of each member.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be thought, that in offering this resolution, I am seeking a\r\ndifferent end from the one I proposed yesterday, when I advocated the\r\nproposition of excluding reporters from our sessions, and insisted\r\nthat our proceedings should be at all times under the seal of secrecy.\r\nSuch, however, is not my purpose. But some discretion must be allowed\r\nus, in order that we may conform to and carry out the spirit of the\r\nresolutions under which we respectively act. This is especially true\r\nin relation to myself and my colleagues. The resolutions under which\r\nwe are acting, require that we should from time to time communicate to\r\nthe legislature of Virginia the proceedings of this body, and to\r\nexpress our own opinions of the prospect which may exist of the\r\nsettlement of existing difficulties. The Commissioners from Virginia\r\nwould be placed in a delicate, not to say an awkward position, by the\r\nadoption of a rule here which would absolutely prohibit such\r\ncommunications. I hope my amendment may be adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--Would not the purpose of the gentleman from Virginia be\r\nanswered by giving any delegation leave to communicate any action\r\nactually taken by the Conference, with their own opinions as to the\r\nprobable result of our deliberations?\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Those opinions would possess no value, unless the facts\r\nand circumstances are communicated upon which they are founded. It is\r\nvery clear to me, that the best course will be to entrust to the\r\ndiscretion of each member the privilege of making these\r\ncommunications, trusting that he will not abuse the confidence thus\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope we have all come here with an earnest desire to\r\nharmonize our conflicting opinions, and to unite upon some plan which\r\nwill settle our troubles and save the union of the States. The South\r\nhas spoken of the North in very severe terms, and the North has not\r\nbeen slow in returning the compliment. If we come finally, to any\r\ndefinite result satisfactory to either side, it must be by mutual\r\nconcessions, by confessing our sins to each other, and endeavoring to\r\nlive harmoniously together in future. In my judgment, secrecy is\r\nabsolutely indispensable to successful action here. I do not wish to\r\nbe precluded from abandoning a position to-morrow, if I see cause for\r\nit, which I have taken to-day. If the proceedings, and especially the\r\ndebates of this Conference, are made public from day to day, they will\r\ngo into the newspapers and be made the subject of comment, favorable\r\nor otherwise. The necessary result will be, that when a member is\r\nunderstood to have committed himself to a particular proposition, or\r\nany special course of policy, that pride of opinion, which we all\r\npossess, will render any change of policy on his part difficult, if\r\nnot impossible. I should sincerely regret the adoption of the\r\nresolution of the gentleman from Virginia.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I move that the portion of the committee's report under\r\nconsideration, together with the resolution of Mr. SEDDON, be\r\nrecommitted to the Committee on Rules and Organization.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. RANDOLPH was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I have an idea relating to the plan which should be\r\nadopted to carry into effect the purpose of this Conference. I wish to\r\npropose it. We have come together upon the invitation of the glorious\r\nold commonwealth of Virginia, the mother of States and Statesmen. We\r\nhave come from the North and the South, from the East and the West, to\r\nsee whether our wisdom can devise some means to avert the dangers\r\nwhich threaten to destroy this noble Republic, founded by the wisdom\r\nand patriotism of our ancestors. I hope we are animated by a common\r\npurpose. The storm is threatening. The horizon is covered with dark\r\nand portentous clouds. Section is arrayed against section, and already\r\n_seven_ of our sister States have separated from us and are proceeding\r\nto establish an independent Confederation. War! Civil War! is\r\nimpending over us. It must be averted! Who does not know that such a\r\nwar, among such a people, must be, if it comes, a war of\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I move the adoption of the resolution which I now send\r\nto the chair.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE was read as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a committee of one from each State be\r\n     appointed by the Commissioners thereof, to be nominated to\r\n     the President, and to be appointed by him, to whom shall be\r\n     referred the resolutions of the State of Virginia, and the\r\n     other States represented, and all propositions for the\r\n     adjustment of existing difficulties between States, with\r\n     authority to report what they may deem right, necessary, and\r\n     proper to restore harmony and preserve the Union, and that\r\n     they report on or before Friday next.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--It appears to me that the mode pointed out by the\r\nresolution introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky, is neither the\r\none most appropriate nor expeditious for accomplishing the result\r\ndesired. We are convened under the invitation of the State of\r\nVirginia; and the same invitation that brings us here, proposes the\r\nbasis for our deliberation and action. Virginia has stated what will\r\nbe satisfactory to her; not as an _ultimatum_, but as a basis of\r\nadjustment. It appears to me that the proper course would be, to take\r\nup the propositions of Virginia--propose amendments to them--discuss\r\nthem, and in the end determine how far they shall be adopted. The\r\nadoption of the resolution proposed, transfers the labors of this\r\nConference, not in itself too large for convenient deliberation, to a\r\ncommittee. That committee is to discuss the various propositions\r\noffered and report the result. What, in the mean time, is this\r\nConference to do? Nothing whatever! We are to meet here from day to\r\nday and adjourn, no one knows how long, until this committee reports,\r\nand then the discussion will commence which ought to commence now. Mr.\r\nPRESIDENT, if any thing is accomplished, it must be accomplished\r\nspeedily. Events are on the wing. Already in my State the delegates\r\nare elected to a Convention, which is to meet next week, to consider\r\nthe subject which now engrosses the minds of the American people. I\r\nhope my suggestion may meet with favor in the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I cannot agree with the gentleman from Virginia, for\r\nreasons which must be obvious to all. I do not think Virginia intended\r\nto dictate the terms upon which we were to act. I am in favor of the\r\nresolution, but would make one suggestion in relation to it. By its\r\nterms the committee is to report on Friday, if it can properly do so.\r\nI suggest that the committee should have leave to sit during the\r\nsessions of the Conference. In this way our business may be greatly\r\nexpedited.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--It gives me pleasure to accept the modification proposed\r\nby the gentleman from Ohio. I should have incorporated it into my\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nThe resolution as modified was then adopted by the Conference without\r\na division.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I will take this occasion to announce a committee to\r\ncarry into effect the determination of the Conference relating to the\r\nobtaining of the services of clergymen to open the proceedings of the\r\nConference daily with prayer. The Chair appoints as such committee,\r\nMr. RANDOLPH, of New Jersey, Mr. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky, and Mr.\r\nJOHNSON, of Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--It appears to me very appropriate, in view of the\r\noccasion which has brought us together, that the members of this\r\nConference should pay their respects in a body to the President of the\r\nUnited States. I therefore move that we call upon him in a body at\r\nsuch a time as will be most agreeable to him; such time to be\r\nascertained by the President of this Conference.\r\n\r\nWhich motion was unanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I move the reconsideration of the vote by which the portion\r\nof the report of the Committee on Rules and Organization not yet\r\nadopted was recommitted to that committee. I do this in order that the\r\nConference may now proceed to the consideration of those rules which\r\nmay be adopted without much difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nThe vote was thereupon reconsidered, and the following rules were\r\nseverally read and adopted. The remaining rules recommended were\r\nrecommitted to the committee:\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES.\r\n\r\nI. A Convention to do business, shall consist of the Commissioners of\r\nnot less than seven States; and all questions shall be decided by the\r\ngreater number of those which be fully represented. But a less number\r\nthan seven may adjourn from day to day.\r\n\r\nII. Immediately after the President shall have taken the chair, and\r\nthe members their seats, the minutes of the preceding day shall be\r\nread by the Secretary.\r\n\r\nIII. Every member, rising to speak, shall address the President; and\r\nwhile he shall be speaking none shall pass between them, or hold\r\ndiscourse with another, or read a book, pamphlet, or paper, printed or\r\nmanuscript; and of two members rising to speak at the same time, the\r\nPresident shall name him who shall first be heard.\r\n\r\nIV. A member shall not speak oftener than twice, without special\r\nleave upon the same question; and not a second time before every other\r\nwho had been silent shall have been heard, if he choose to speak upon\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nV. A motion made and seconded, shall be repeated; and if written, as\r\nit shall be when any member shall so require, read aloud by the\r\nSecretary before it shall be debated; and may be withdrawn at any time\r\nbefore the vote upon it shall have been declared.\r\n\r\nVI. Orders of the day shall be read next after the minutes, and either\r\ndiscussed or postponed, before any other business shall be introduced.\r\n\r\nVII. When a debate shall arise upon a question, no motion, other than\r\nto amend the question, to commit it, or to postpone the debate, shall\r\nbe received.\r\n\r\nVIII. A question which is complicated, shall, at the request of any\r\nmember, be divided and put separately upon the propositions of which\r\nit is compounded.\r\n\r\nIX. A writing which contains any matter brought on to be considered,\r\nshall be read once, throughout, for information; then by paragraphs,\r\nto be debated, and again with the amendments, if any, made on the\r\nsecond reading, and afterwards the question shall be put upon the\r\nwhole, as amended or approved in the original form, as the case may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nX. Committees shall be appointed by the President, unless otherwise\r\nordered by the Convention.\r\n\r\nXI. A member may be called to order by another member, as well as by\r\nthe President, and may be allowed to explain his conduct or\r\nexpressions supposed to be reprehensible. And all questions of order\r\nshall be decided by the President, without appeal or debate.\r\n\r\nXII. Upon a question to adjourn for the day, which may be made at any\r\ntime, if it be seconded, the question shall be put without debate.\r\n\r\nXIII. When the Convention shall adjourn, every member shall stand in\r\nhis place until the President pass him.\r\n\r\nXIV. That no member be absent from the Convention, so as to interrupt\r\nthe representation of the State, without leave.\r\n\r\nXV. That Committees do not sit while the Convention shall be, or ought\r\nto be sitting, without leave of the Convention.\r\n\r\nXVI. That no copy be taken of any entry on the Journal, during the\r\nsitting of the Convention, without leave of the Convention.\r\n\r\nXVII. That members only be permitted to inspect the Journal.\r\n\r\nXVIII. _Mode of Voting._ All votes shall be taken by States, and each\r\nState to give one vote. The yeas and nays of the members shall not be\r\ngiven or published--only the decision by States.\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the foregoing Rules, the Conference adjourned\r\nuntil 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, THURSDAY, _February 7th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference convened, pursuant to the adjournment yesterday, at 10\r\no'clock A.M.\r\n\r\nIt was called to order by President TYLER, and prayer was offered by\r\nRev. Dr. PYNE, of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday was read, and after sundry amendments, was\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nMessrs. J.H. PULESTON, JOHN STRYKER, W.W. HOPPIN, Jr., and ----\r\nOlcott, took their places as Assistant Secretaries.\r\n\r\nPresident TYLER:--Gentlemen of the Conference, as directed by the\r\nresolution which you adopted yesterday, I addressed a note to the\r\nPresident of the United States, asking at what hour it would be\r\nagreeable to him that this Conference should call on him in a body. To\r\nthis note I have received a reply which will be read by the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then read the following note from the President:\r\n\r\n     EXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 6th, 1861._\r\n\r\n     My DEAR SIR:--I shall feel greatly honored to receive the\r\n     gentlemen composing the Convention of Commissioners from the\r\n     several States, on any day and at any hour most convenient\r\n     to themselves. I shall name to-morrow (Thursday) at 11 or 3\r\n     o'clock, though any other time would be equally agreeable to\r\n     me. I shall at all times be prepared to give them a cordial\r\n     welcome.\r\n\r\n     Yours, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n     JAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n     His Excellency, JOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--What order will the Conference take upon the subject?\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move that the members of this Conference call in a\r\nbody upon the President of the United States this morning, at 11\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE'S motion was adopted unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials further\r\nto report, that the committee have examined the credentials of the\r\nfollowing gentlemen, and find them duly accredited as members of this\r\nbody:\r\n\r\n_New York._--William E. Dodge.\r\n\r\n_Tennessee._--Samuel Milligan, Josiah M. Anderson, Robert L.\r\nCarruthers, Thomas Martin, Isaac R. Hawkins, R.J. McKinney, Alvin\r\nCullom, William P. Hickerson, George W. Jones, F.K. Zollicoffer,\r\nWilliam H. Stephens, A.W.O. Totten.\r\n\r\n_Illinois._--John Wood, Stephen T. Logan, John M. Palmer, Burton C.\r\nCook, Thomas J. Turner.\r\n\r\nWhich report was accepted, and the names of the Commissioners were\r\nentered upon the record.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Certain printing has been ordered, but no provision\r\nhas been made for paying for it. The Committee on Rules have therefore\r\nrequested me to report the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Secretary procure for the use of the\r\n     Convention the necessary stationery, and also provide for\r\n     such printing as may be ordered. That the Journal, up to and\r\n     including this day's proceeding, as well as the Rules, be\r\n     printed for the use of the members.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The respective delegations have recommended, and the\r\nChair announces the names of the following gentlemen to compose the\r\ncommittee ordered to be raised under the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE,\r\nwhich was adopted yesterday:--New Hampshire, Asa Fowler; Vermont,\r\nHiland Hall; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Samuel Ames;\r\nConnecticut, Roger S. Baldwin; New Jersey, Joseph F. Randolph;\r\nPennsylvania, Thomas White; Delaware, Daniel M. Bates; North Carolina,\r\nThomas Ruffin; Kentucky, James Guthrie; Ohio, Thomas Ewing; Indiana,\r\nCaleb B. Smith; Illinois, Stephen T. Logan; Iowa, James Harlan;\r\nMaryland, Reverdy Johnson; Virginia, James A. Seddon.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--The Committee on Rules have further considered the\r\nrule relating to the secrecy of the debates and proceedings of this\r\nbody, and their convictions as to the necessity and propriety of its\r\nadoption remain unchanged. The prospect of an ultimate agreement among\r\nthe Commissioners composing this body, in the opinion of the\r\ncommittee, would be materially lessened if all or any of its debates\r\nshould be made public, for reasons which have already been stated. If\r\nany gentleman should desire to communicate with the Executive or\r\nLegislative authorities of his State any facts, during the progress of\r\nour business, I apprehend little difficulty would be experienced in\r\nobtaining the leave of the Convention. We therefore recommend the\r\nfollowing Rule:\r\n\r\n     XIX. That nothing spoken in the Convention be printed, or\r\n     otherwise published or communicated, without leave.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I do not desire to discuss the adoption of the rule under\r\nconsideration any further than I have already. The Commissioners from\r\nthe State of Virginia are appointed under resolutions which make it\r\ntheir duty to communicate from time to time with her deliberative\r\nassemblies. We do not wish to have our right to do so subject to the\r\naction of this or any other body. It is no answer to this to say, that\r\nthere is no doubt that the leave to make the necessary communications\r\nwill be accorded to us when we ask it. We do not wish to ask it. We\r\ninsist upon our rights in this respect, as it is our duty to the State\r\nthat sent us here to do.\r\n\r\nThe rule was adopted upon a count of the members voting.\r\n\r\nOn motion, the Convention adjourned.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment, the Convention in a body called upon the\r\nPRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, when the several delegations were\r\nintroduced by President TYLER, and the several Commissioners were\r\npresented by the chairmen of the several delegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 8th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order at 12 o'clock by President TYLER.\r\nPrayer was offered by Rev. Dr. BUTLER. After sundry amendments, the\r\nJournal was approved.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report\r\nthat they find the following gentlemen duly accredited as members of\r\nthe Convention:\r\n\r\n_New York._--David Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S.\r\nWadsworth, Erastus Corning, Amaziah B. James, James C. Smith, Addison\r\nGardner, Greene C. Bronson, John A. King, John E. Wool.\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts._--John Z. Goodrich, John M. Forbes, Richard P. Waters,\r\nTheophilus P. Chandler, Francis B. Crowninshield, George S. Boutwell,\r\nCharles Allen.\r\n\r\n_Missouri._--John D. Coalter, Alexander W. Doniphan, Waldo P. Johnson,\r\nAylett H. Buckner, Harrison Hough.\r\n\r\nOn motion of the respective delegations the following gentlemen were\r\nadded to the committee raised on the resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE:\r\n\r\n_New York._--Mr. Field.\r\n_Missouri._--Mr. Doniphan.\r\n_Tennessee._--Mr. Zollicoffer.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I am instructed by the committee raised upon the\r\nresolution introduced by myself, to inform the Convention that that\r\nbody is not able to report to-day, agreeable to the suggestion made at\r\nthe time they were appointed. Several States are yet unrepresented on\r\nthe committee, and delegations from some of them have only arrived\r\nthis morning. I am therefore directed to ask for further time to make\r\na report, assuring the Convention, at the same time, that a report\r\nwill be made at soon as a proper regard to the interests of all\r\nsections will permit it to be done.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I move that the time for the report of the committee be\r\nextended until Monday next. As in the mean time there will be little\r\nbusiness for the Convention to do, and that of a formal character, it\r\nmight be as well to adjourn from this time until Monday; and I move\r\nfurther, that if delegates arrive from States now unrepresented, they\r\nmay present their credentials to the committee, and if no question\r\narises on them, they may then select a member of the committee on Mr.\r\nGUTHRIE'S resolution, and report his name to the Secretary of that\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I object to an adjournment until Monday. We can meet here\r\nto-morrow and do any business which may come before us.\r\n\r\nThe several motions of Mr. CLAY, with the alteration suggested by Mr.\r\nSEDDON, were then agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLIS:--I move that the President be requested to issue cards of\r\nadmission to the members and officers of this Convention.\r\n\r\nWhich motion was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I would like to understand whether we all construe the\r\nrule referring to the secrecy of our transactions alike. I am told\r\nthat different constructions are placed upon it by different members,\r\nand would suggest the propriety of the PRESIDENT'S giving his views of\r\nthe meaning of the rule.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I understand, by the correct interpretation of the\r\nrule, that nothing which is said or done in the Convention having\r\nreference to any subject of business in it, can be spoken of or\r\ndisclosed to any but members.\r\n\r\nThe Convention then adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 9th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was\r\noffered by Rev. Dr. BULLOCK. The Journal was read, corrected, and\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I am directed by the Committee on Credentials to report\r\nas members of this Convention the names of the following gentlemen\r\nfrom the State of Maine:--William P. Fessenden, Lot M. Morrill, Daniel\r\nE. Somes, John J. Perry, Ezra B. French, Freeman H. Morse, Stephen\r\nCoburn, Stephen C. Foster.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL, of Maine, and Mr. CROWNINSHIELD, of Massachusetts, were\r\nannounced as members of the committee under the resolution of Mr.\r\nGUTHRIE.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I offer certain resolutions, which I desire to have printed\r\nand referred to the Committee on Resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of Mr. TUCK were read, ordered to be printed, and\r\nreferred. (These resolutions will be found on a subsequent page.)\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I hold in my hand the proceedings of a very large\r\nDemocratic meeting recently held at New Haven, in the State of\r\nConnecticut. Among them are certain resolutions, breathing a spirit of\r\nfervent devotion to the Union, and expressing an anxious desire for\r\nthe settlement of the difficult questions now before the country. They\r\nhave been sent to me with a request that I should lay them before this\r\nConvention. Why I was selected by them for the performance of this\r\nduty, I do not know, unless it was because, from my name and\r\nassociations, they thought an assurance might be found that I\r\nparticipated in the sentiments expressed in the resolutions. I present\r\nthem with great pleasure, and ask that they may be referred to the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CLAY was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I move that the Secretary be requested to furnish for\r\nthe use of the members a printed list of the delegates to and officers\r\nof this Convention.\r\n\r\nWhich motion was adopted, and the Convention adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 11th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT. Prayer was\r\noffered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY.\r\n\r\nAfter the reading and amendment of the Journal, Mr. GUTHRIE, from the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions, asked for further time to make a general\r\nreport of the matters submitted to them, which was given; and\r\nthereupon Mr. GUTHRIE, from the same Committee, made the following\r\nreport upon the resolutions of a meeting in the State of Connecticut,\r\nwhich were referred to that committee on motion of Mr. CLAY:\r\n\r\n     The committee to whom were referred certain resolutions of\r\n     the Democratic party of the State of Connecticut, report\r\n     that in the opinion of the committee it is inexpedient for\r\n     this Convention to act upon any resolution purporting to\r\n     emanate from any political party whatever; and that the\r\n     member of the Convention by whom they were presented have\r\n     leave to withdraw the same.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I take this opportunity to announce to the Convention\r\nthat the Door-keeper of the House of Representatives has transmitted\r\nto the Chair cards admitting members of this body on to the floor of\r\nthe House. These cards will be delivered by the Secretary to such\r\nmembers as call for them.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I move that any propositions or resolutions which members\r\nof this Convention desire to have considered by the Committee on\r\nResolutions and Propositions, may be presented to the committee\r\nthrough the Secretary, without being presented in Convention.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to, and on motion the Convention adjourned until\r\nWednesday the 13th instant, at 12 o'clock M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 13th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by the PRESIDENT, and prayer was\r\noffered by Rev. Dr. EDWARDS. The Journal, after sundry amendments, was\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The Committee on Resolutions, &c., have labored\r\ndiligently, and held protracted sessions, in the hope of being able to\r\nmake their report to-day. This they find themselves unable to do. They\r\nare fully impressed with the necessity of immediate action, in view of\r\nthe short time that will remain for Congress to consider the action of\r\nthis Convention, if it shall become necessary to submit any\r\nproposition of this body to be acted upon by that. I have no doubt we\r\nshall be able to report on Friday, and I ask that we may have until\r\nthat time to make a report.\r\n\r\nThe request of Mr. GUTHRIE was acceded to.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The time has now arrived when, as one of the\r\nCommissioners from the State of Virginia, I find it necessary to ask\r\nthe leave of the Convention to communicate to the Legislative\r\nauthorities of Virginia, and to her Convention now in session, the\r\nstate of the proceedings before this body, and the committee. I ask\r\nfor liberty to do so, and believe that a proper regard to the\r\ninstructions of the Legislature of the State under which my\r\nappointment is made, requires that my request should be granted.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Commissioners of any State represented\r\n     in this Convention, upon their joint application, have leave\r\n     to communicate to the Legislature, Governor, or Convention\r\n     of said State, the proceedings of this body, or so much\r\n     thereof as they may deem expedient.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The passage of this resolution is all I ask.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I move to amend the resolution by adding thereto:\r\n\"But not to communicate what has transpired in the committee, before\r\nsaid committee has reported to the Convention.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I do not deem the passage of the resolution at this\r\nmoment as very important. At the suggestion of several gentlemen, I\r\nwill move to lay it on the table, subject to be called up after\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nThe Convention then adjourned to Friday at 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of February 13th, the members of the Conference were\r\ninformed of the death of Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, who officiated\r\nas temporary chairman previous to the permanent organization. In view\r\nof the anxious desire of all the members to recognize their\r\nappreciation of this act of Divine Providence, in removing from the\r\nsphere of his earthly labors one of the most valued Commissioners in\r\nattendance, President TYLER was requested to summon a special meeting\r\nof the Conference. In pursuance of his invitation, all the members\r\nattended on the morning of February 14th, when the following\r\nproceedings were had:\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, WASHINGTON CITY, _February 14th, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Convention met in special session, pursuant to the call of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were opened with prayer by the Rev. Dr. HALL.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the Secretary, CRAFTS J. WRIGHT, was read,\r\nand ordered to be entered upon the minutes:\r\n\r\n     WILLARD'S HOTEL,                        }\r\n     WASHINGTON CITY, _February 13th, 1861._ }\r\n\r\n     _Hon._ JOHN TYLER, _President of Conference Convention._\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR:--I grieve to communicate to you the fact, that the\r\n     delegate from Ohio to this Conference Convention, the Hon.\r\n     JOHN C. WRIGHT, departed this life this day, the 13th\r\n     February, at half-past one o'clock.\r\n\r\n     Judge WRIGHT came to this Convention with a heart filled\r\n     with fear for the safety of the Union. Though at an advanced\r\n     age and nearly blind, he was filled with an earnest desire\r\n     to add his efforts to that of others of the Convention\r\n     called by the State of Virginia, and seek to agree on some\r\n     measures honorable to each and all, to effect the object.\r\n     Since the arrival of my father in Washington, he has been\r\n     constant in his efforts to effect the end in view, and he\r\n     has had his heart cheered with the belief that the object\r\n     would be accomplished. Almost the last words that he uttered\r\n     were, that he believed the Union would be preserved. He\r\n     desired me to say, if the Union were preserved, he would die\r\n     content. He called me to read to him, at 12 o'clock, the\r\n     sections in the Constitution in regard to counting the\r\n     votes, and this request, and this reading, terminated his\r\n     knowledge on earth. In this desire of my father to do what\r\n     he could, he pressed me to accompany him on account of his\r\n     blindness. Since the Convention honored me with the\r\n     appointment of Secretary, he required of me a promise that I\r\n     would not leave the position. When I read the section of the\r\n     Constitution to him, he required me then to leave him for\r\n     the Convention. Whatever my personal feelings may be, I deem\r\n     the pledge made sacred. I therefore ask that I may have\r\n     leave of absence, until I carry the remains home to Ohio,\r\n     and return to my duty.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully,\r\n\r\n     CRAFTS J. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--J. HENRY PULESTON will act for me in my absence.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT informed the Convention that the request of the\r\nSecretary had been complied with. The PRESIDENT asked what action the\r\nConvention proposed to take on the subject for which they had been\r\nspecially assembled.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. SALMON P. CHASE, of Ohio, then said:--Mr. PRESIDENT, since we\r\nassembled yesterday in this Hall, it has pleased God to remove one of\r\nour number from all participation in the concerns of earth. It is my\r\npainful duty to announce to the Convention that JOHN C. WRIGHT, one of\r\nthe Commissioners from Ohio, is no more. Full of years, honored by the\r\nconfidence of the people, rich in large experience and ripened wisdom,\r\nand devoted in all his affections and all his powers to his country,\r\nand his whole country, he has been called from our midst at the very\r\nmoment when the prudence and patriotism of his counsels seemed most\r\nneeded. Such are the mysterious ways of Divine Providence. Judge\r\nWRIGHT was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, on the 10th of August,\r\n1784. The death of his parents made him an orphan in infancy; and he\r\nhad little to depend upon in youth and early manhood, save his own\r\nenergies and God's blessing. He was married, while young, to a\r\ndaughter of Thomas Collier, of Litchfield, and for several years after\r\nresided at Troy, New York. When about twenty-six years old he removed\r\nto Steubenville, in Ohio, where he commenced the practice of the law,\r\nand rapidly rose to distinction in the profession. In 1822 he was\r\nelected a representative in Congress, where he became the associate\r\nand friend of Clay and Webster, and proved himself, on many occasions,\r\nworthy of their association and friendship.\r\n\r\nAfter serving several terms in Congress, he was elected a Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of Ohio, and, in 1834, removed from Steubenville to the\r\ncity of Cincinnati. Resigning his seat soon afterwards, he resumed\r\nthe labors of the bar, and, ever zealous for the improvement and\r\nelevation of the profession, established, in association with others,\r\nthe Cincinnati law school.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, upon the dying request of CHARLES HAMMOND, the veteran editor\r\nof the \"Cincinnati Gazette,\" Judge WRIGHT assumed the editorial\r\ncontrol of that Journal, and retained that position until impaired\r\nvision, in 1853, admonished him of the necessity of withdrawing from\r\nlabors too severe.\r\n\r\nThenceforward engaged in moderate labors, surrounded by affectionate\r\nrelatives, enjoying the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens,\r\nand manifesting always the liveliest concern in whatever related to\r\nthe welfare and honor of his State and his country, he lived in\r\ntranquil retirement, until called by the Governor of Ohio, with the\r\napprobation of the Senate, to take part in the deliberations of this\r\nConference Convention.\r\n\r\nIt was but a just tribute, sir, to his honored age, illustrated by\r\nabilities, by virtues, and by services, that he was unanimously\r\nselected as its temporary President. His interest in the great purpose\r\nof our assembling was profound and earnest. His labors to promote an\r\nauspicious result of its deliberations were active and constant. And\r\nwhen fatal disease assailed his life, and his enfeebled powers yielded\r\nto its virulence, his last utterances were of the Constitution and the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, Judge WRIGHT was my friend. His approval cheered and\r\nencouraged my own humble labors in the service of the State. Pardon me\r\nif I mingle private with public grief. He has gone from his last great\r\nlabor. He was not permitted to witness upon earth the result of the\r\nmission upon which he and his associates, who here mourn his loss,\r\nwere sent. God grant that the clouds which now darken over us may\r\nspeedily disperse, and that through generous counsels and patriotic\r\nlabors, guided by that good Providence which directed our fathers in\r\nits original formation, the Union of our States may be more than ever\r\nfirmly cemented and established.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I offer the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the death of our late venerable\r\n     colleague, the Hon. JOHN C. WRIGHT, we mourn the loss to the\r\n     State of Ohio, and to the nation at large, of one of our\r\n     most sagacious statesmen and distinguished patriots; and to\r\n     the cause of Union and conciliation, one of its most\r\n     illustrious supporters.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while we deplore with saddened hearts the\r\n     affliction with which an All-wise Providence has visited us,\r\n     we know that no transition from life to immortality could\r\n     have been more grateful to him who has fallen than this, in\r\n     which his life has been offered a willing sacrifice in an\r\n     effort to restore harmony to his distracted country.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the members of this Convention tender their\r\n     heartfelt sympathies to the family of the deceased in this\r\n     their great affliction.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That these resolutions be spread upon the\r\n     records of this body, and a copy of the same be transmitted\r\n     to the family of the deceased.\r\n\r\nMr. CHARLES A. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky, moved the adoption of the\r\nresolutions, and said:\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I rise to tender my most cordial sanction and second to\r\nthe resolutions which have just been read.\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT and myself entered the councils of this nation thirty-seven\r\nyears ago. We served together during a period when party excitement\r\nran high upon questions more of a personal than a constitutional\r\ncharacter. I can bear witness not only to his ability, but to his\r\npersonal integrity, and his purity of political action through our\r\nterm of service in the House of Representatives. I have seldom met him\r\nsince we separated at the termination of his service and mine in that\r\nbody, which occurred at pretty near the same period; but whenever I\r\nhave met him, I have found him the same stern advocate of the Union\r\nand of constitutional liberty. I rejoiced, therefore, when I found him\r\nin this hall on the day we first assembled here. I knew his\r\nconservative disposition and principles, and I promised myself that\r\nwith his aid I could be more useful to my country and to my State than\r\nwithout him. In conversing with him upon the difficulties which now\r\ndivide and distract our common country, I found him ready and willing,\r\nconscientiously and patriotically, to do that which I thought that\r\nportion of the country which I represent has a right to demand and\r\nexpect of those who represent a different portion of our Union. And if\r\nmy friend from Ohio (Mr. CHASE) and his colleagues will permit me to\r\nmingle my sorrow at the public loss, I will say nothing of the private\r\nbereavement of the family of our deceased colleague. I leave him to\r\nhis country, and to you, with this testimony which I leave to his\r\nmemory, his honesty of purpose and his patriotic love of country.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. A.W. LOOMIS, of Pennsylvania, said:\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I desire to mingle my sincere regrets with those of the\r\nmembers of this assemblage at the sad and unexpected occurrence which\r\ndeprived us of an able, experienced, and patriotic associate. My\r\nrelations with the deceased were, for many years, probably more\r\nintimate than those which existed between him and any other member of\r\nthis Convention. Forty years have elapsed since I first made his\r\nacquaintance. He was then in full, active, and extensive practice; a\r\nlearned lawyer, an accomplished, skilful, and successful advocate.\r\nDuring the succeeding year I came to the bar, and resided and\r\npracticed in the same judicial circuit with our departed friend. For\r\nmany years the most kind and intimate relations existed between\r\nus--sometimes colleagues, but usually opponents. So kind and genial\r\nwas his nature, so fair and liberal his practice, that during our\r\nentire intercourse not an unkind word was uttered, and, so far as I\r\nknow or believe, not an unpleasant feeling existed in the bosom of\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThough not gifted with the highest order of eloquence, he was clear,\r\ndistinct, and persuasive. His style of speaking resembled not the\r\nbabbling brook or the dashing cataract, but usually the limpid stream,\r\ngliding gracefully amid fields and fruits and flowers, though\r\nsometimes assuming the power and proportions of the majestic river,\r\ncutting its sure and certain way to the mighty ocean.\r\n\r\nHis professional position, his kindness of heart, and genial humor,\r\nmade him an object of high respect and warm regard among his\r\nprofessional brethren. And now, sir, as memory passes in review the\r\npleasant incidents which marked our social and professional\r\nintercourse, the smitten heart shrinks in sadness and sorrow from the\r\ncontemplation of our bereavement. He adorned, sir, the bar, the bench,\r\nand the halls of Legislation. He discharged, in all the relations of\r\nlife, his obligations with fidelity. Of him it might be truly said:\r\n\r\n     His life hath flowed a sacred stream, in whose calm depths\r\n     The beautiful and pure alone are mirrored;\r\n     Which, though shapes of ill may hover o'er the surface,\r\n     Glides in light, and takes no shadows from them.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, the great crowning virtue and glory of his life was his\r\nacceptance of the mission which brought him here. Though whitened by\r\nthe frosts of nearly eighty winters, neither lofty mountains nor\r\nintervening space could restrain his patriotic heart from a prompt\r\nresponse to the call of his country to mingle his influence in a\r\nsincere and sacred effort to save the Constitution and perpetuate the\r\nUnion. He accepted the great trust; he mingled in our deliberations,\r\nand has fallen in the discharge of his duty. He has justly earned a\r\ntitle to the gratitude and respect of his country. May we not, sir,\r\nfondly hope that he, who was called from the discharge of such duties\r\nto the presence of his God, has passed from the sorrows of earth to\r\nthe happiness of Heaven, and to the full fruition of joys pure,\r\nperfect, and eternal?\r\n\r\nThe Hon. THOMAS EWING, of Ohio, said:--I rise to bear my tribute of\r\nrespect to the memory of the deceased. I have known him long. On my\r\nfirst entrance into active life, at the bar, I found him an able and\r\ndistinguished member. Since that time down to the present day, he has\r\nbeen largely associated, in mind and person, with all the acts and\r\nprogress, professional and political, of my life. I feel his loss\r\nintensely; and I feel it with more regret, because I know that on this\r\noccasion his voice would have been potential in our counsels, and\r\nwould have been united with all of us who labor most earnestly for the\r\npreservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nI tender my sympathies to the family of the deceased. I unite with\r\nthem in their regrets and in their hopes of the happy future to which\r\nhe may have attained.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. WILLIAM C. RIVES, of Virginia, said:--Though wholly\r\nunprepared to say any thing worthy of the solemnity of this occasion,\r\nI feel that I should be wanting, sir, in that sentiment of respect\r\nwhich is due to the character of a distinguished citizen, if I were\r\nnot to add to what has been so eloquently spoken by others, a few\r\nwords of personal recollection in regard to our deceased friend Judge\r\nWRIGHT. It so happened that we entered the public councils of the\r\ncountry at the same moment, and continued in them for the same period\r\nof time. It is now just thirty-seven years since I had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting Judge WRIGHT, for the first time, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States. I may be permitted to say, that\r\nthere were giants in those days. My honorable friend from Kentucky\r\n(Governor WICKLIFFE), who has already so feelingly addressed the\r\nConvention, will recollect that on the roll of the House of\r\nRepresentatives at that time stood the names of WEBSTER and EVERETT,\r\nof OAKLEY and STORRS, of SARGEANT and of HEMPHILL, of LEWIS McLANE, of\r\nthe immortal CLAY, and BARBOUR and RANDALL, and other gentlemen known\r\nto fame from the State which I have the honor to represent in this\r\nbody, and LIVINGSTON of Louisiana, McDUFFIE and HAMILTON of South\r\nCarolina, and other gentlemen who, on the spur of the occasion, I am\r\nnot now able to recall, but whose names will forever shine upon the\r\nrolls of their country's glory. And yet in that body Judge WRIGHT,\r\nthen in the maturity of his powers, though not previously known to the\r\nnation, vindicated an equal rank in debate with those gentlemen whose\r\nnames I have mentioned. Sir, I shall never forget with what\r\nearnestness, with what manliness, with what integrity, with what\r\nability, he ever uttered his convictions of public duty, whatever they\r\nwere, in that consecrated hall.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining here, I think, for six years, he retired to his own\r\nState for the purpose of assuming the duties of a highly-important and\r\ndignified office, which was soon followed by his retirement into the\r\nbosom of private life, where he met a rich and ample solace for the\r\nstorms of his public career. He was followed there by the respect of\r\nhis fellow-citizens throughout the country, and the confidence of his\r\nown State, as we have recently seen, by his being called from that\r\nhonorable retirement to take part in the grave and solemn duties of\r\nthis assembly. Sir, he came among us in obedience to the solemn call\r\nof patriotic duty, at a most exigent and distressing period in our\r\nnational annals. He came here on an errand of peace, in the spirit of\r\npeace and conciliation. Such was the feeling entertained toward him by\r\nthe whole of this assembly, that without the slightest preconcert, so\r\nfar as I know, he was invited by general consent to preside during the\r\npreliminary stages of the organization of this Convention. I had an\r\nopportunity, from time to time, of private conversation with the aged\r\nstatesman. I found no member of the assembly I met here, and, indeed,\r\nI have found nowhere any citizen of this wide Republic of ours, whose\r\nheart was more deeply imbued with the spirit of conciliation and of\r\npeace--of that spirit which was so solemnly and impressively uttered\r\nin his last prayer, \"May the Union be preserved.\" Sir, it is not\r\ngiven to mortal man to choose the manner of his death; but if such\r\nwere the privilege accorded to any human being, what more glorious end\r\ncould he, appreciating a true fame, covet, than that which has been\r\nthe lot of our departed friend? Sir, I speak what I feel, and I dare\r\nsay I express a sentiment which has impressed itself upon many other\r\nbosoms in this assembly, when I say that his sudden death in the midst\r\nof our deliberations, seems to me to exalt--in some degree to\r\ncanonize--our labors. This manifestation of the visible hand of God\r\namong us, brings us in the immediate presence of those solemn\r\nresponsibilities which attach themselves to the discharge of our\r\nduties here. I doubt not that every member of this assembly is already\r\ndeeply impressed with the solemnity of those duties, and I feel\r\nconvinced that there are few, if any, in this assembly, who would not\r\nlay down their fleeting and feverish existence, and follow our\r\ndeceased brother to his final account, if by doing so they could\r\nrestore peace and harmony to this glorious Republic of ours.\r\n\r\nIt does not become me to make any professions of devotion to my\r\ncountry--to my whole country--but this I will say, in the spirit of\r\nthe last prayer of my friend, that I should regard my poor life, such\r\nas it is, a cheap purchase--the cheapest imaginable purchase--for that\r\ngreat boon to our country, the restoration of its peace, of its\r\nharmony, of its unity, of its ancient confederated strength and glory.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken, and the resolutions were unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nThe body of Judge WRIGHT was then brought into the hall, preceded by\r\nRev. Dr. HALL, who read the impressive service of the Episcopal\r\nChurch. A number of the members of the family, and of the friends of\r\nthe deceased, were present during the services.\r\n\r\nThe funeral cortege proceeded from the hall to the depot of the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen were designated to act as pall-bearers on the\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\nMr. Ewing,\r\nMr. Hitchcock,\r\nMr. Chase,\r\nMr. Loomis,\r\nMr. Backus,\r\nMr. Wolcott,\r\nMr. Sherman,\r\nMr. Vinton,\r\nMr. Groesbeck,\r\nMr. Stanton,\r\nMr. Harlan,\r\nMr. Gurley.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings upon the death of Judge WRIGHT were, by the\r\nConference, ordered to be published, and the special session closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 15th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by President TYLER, and prayer was\r\noffered by Rev. Mr. RENNER. The Journals of the 13th and 14th were\r\nread and approved.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I have this morning received several communications\r\nfrom different persons, which will be laid before the Convention. One\r\nis an invitation from HORATIO STONE, inviting the members of the\r\nConvention to visit his studio; also, a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, authorizing the admission of members of this\r\nConvention to the floor of the House. Also, a letter from J.E. SANDS,\r\noffering to the Convention certain flags which possess historical\r\ninterest, from the fact that they were used in the convention which\r\nadopted the present Constitution of the United States. Also, a\r\ncommunication from HORATIO G. WARNER.\r\n\r\nThe communications were severally read and laid upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials to\r\ninform the Convention that the committee has received satisfactory\r\nevidence of the appointment by the Executive of Ohio of C.P. WOLCOTT,\r\nas a delegate to this Convention, in the place of JOHN C. WRIGHT,\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I desire to offer the following resolutions, which I ask to\r\nhave read for the information of the Convention. I have no purpose to\r\nadmit spectators to seats on this floor, but in my judgment it is the\r\nright of the country to know what we are doing here. My constituents\r\nwill not be satisfied with my course, unless I take means to give the\r\npublic knowledge of all our transactions. I am aware that this is an\r\ninvasion of the rule already adopted, requiring secrecy, but in my\r\nopinion no possible harm can come from the daily publication of our\r\ndebates. It is far better that true reports of these debates should be\r\nmade, than that the distorted and perverted accounts which we see\r\ndaily in the New York papers should be continued.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were read, and are as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Rules Sixteen (16) and Eighteen (18) of\r\n     this Convention be, and the same hereby are, rescinded.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the President is hereby authorized to grant\r\n     cards of admission to reporters of the press, not exceeding\r\n     ---- in number, which shall entitle them to seats on the\r\n     floor of the Convention, for the purpose of reporting its\r\n     proceedings.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That no person be admitted to the floor of the\r\n     Convention, except the members, officers, or reporters.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I do not wish to prolong this discussion myself, nor\r\nto cause it to be prolonged by others. I am sure that if we permit our\r\ndebates to be reported, we shall never reach a conclusion which will\r\nin the slightest degree benefit the country. Every member will in that\r\nevent wish to make a set speech, some of them three or four. I wish to\r\nhave our time used in consultation and in action, not consumed in\r\npolitical speech-making. I do not care what the newspapers say of us.\r\nI know their accounts are distorted; but they would be distorted if we\r\nadmitted reporters. Some of them assail us as a convention of\r\ncompromisers--as belonging to the sandstone stratum of politics.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--That is the formation which supports all others.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I know it, and I hope this Convention will prove to be\r\nthe stratum which supports and preserves the Union and the country.\r\nLet us go on as we have begun, preserving secrecy; keeping our own\r\ncounsels; making no speeches for outside consumption or personal\r\nreputation. Let us all keep steadily in mind the accomplishment of the\r\ngreat and good purpose which brought us here, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--New Jersey does not wish to have time consumed in\r\nmaking speeches. I think we should proceed at once to hear the report\r\nof the committee. I move that the resolutions offered be laid upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I suppose this motion cuts off debate. I should much have\r\npreferred to discuss the resolutions. I hope the motion will not\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThe motion to lay on the table passed in the affirmative by a _viva\r\nvoce_ vote.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--Is the General Committee upon Propositions prepared to\r\nreport? If it is, their report is now in order.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--That committee has given earnest and careful\r\nconsideration to the subjects and propositions which have from time to\r\ntime been presented to it. It has held numerous and protracted\r\nsessions, and the differences of opinion naturally existing between\r\nthe members have been discussed in a spirit of candor and\r\nconciliation. The committee have not been so fortunate as to arrive at\r\nan unanimous conclusion. A majority of its members, however, have\r\nagreed upon a report which we think ought to be satisfactory to all\r\nsections of the Union, one which if adopted will, we believe,\r\naccomplish the purpose so much desired by every patriotic citizen. We\r\nthink it will give peace to the country. In their behalf I have now\r\nthe honor to submit, for the consideration of the Conference, the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     PROPOSALS OF AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED\r\n     STATES.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States not\r\n     embraced within the limits of the Cherokee treaty grant,\r\n     north of a line from east to west on the parallel of 36\r\n     degrees 30 minutes north latitude, involuntary servitude,\r\n     except in punishment of crime, is prohibited whilst it shall\r\n     be under a Territorial government; and in all the territory\r\n     south of said line, the status of persons owing service or\r\n     labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed by law while\r\n     such territory shall be under a Territorial government; and\r\n     neither Congress nor the Territorial government shall have\r\n     power to hinder or prevent the taking to said territory of\r\n     persons held to labor or involuntary service, within the\r\n     United States, according to the laws or usages of the State\r\n     from which such persons may be taken, nor to impair the\r\n     rights arising out of said relations, which shall be subject\r\n     to judicial cognizance in the federal courts, according to\r\n     the common law; and when any territory north or south of\r\n     said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe,\r\n     shall contain a population required for a member of\r\n     Congress, according to the then federal ratio of\r\n     representation, it shall, if its form of government be\r\n     republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal footing\r\n     with the original States, with or without involuntary\r\n     service or labor, as the Constitution of such new State may\r\n     provide.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 2. Territory shall not be acquired by the United\r\n     States, unless by treaty; nor, except for naval and\r\n     commercial stations and depots, unless such treaty shall be\r\n     ratified by four-fifths of all members of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 3. Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment\r\n     thereof, shall be construed to give Congress power to\r\n     regulate, abolish, or control within any State or Territory\r\n     of the United States, the relation established or recognized\r\n     by the laws thereof touching persons bound to labor or\r\n     involuntary service therein, nor to interfere with or\r\n     abolish involuntary service in the District of Columbia\r\n     without the consent of Maryland and without the consent of\r\n     the owners, or making the owners who do not consent just\r\n     compensation; nor the power to interfere with or prohibit\r\n     representatives and others from bringing with them to the\r\n     City of Washington, retaining, and taking away, persons so\r\n     bound to labor; nor the power to interfere with or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in places under the exclusive\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States within those States and\r\n     Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor\r\n     the power to prohibit the removal or transportation, by\r\n     land, sea, or river, of persons held to labor or involuntary\r\n     service in any State or Territory of the United States to\r\n     any other State or Territory thereof where it is established\r\n     or recognized by law or usage; and the right during\r\n     transportation of touching at ports, shores, and landings,\r\n     and of landing in case of distress, shall exist. Nor shall\r\n     Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\n     on persons bound to labor than on land.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the\r\n     fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to\r\n     prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and\r\n     through the action of their judicial and ministerial\r\n     officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from\r\n     labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 5. The foreign slave-trade and the importation of\r\n     slaves into the United States and their Territories, from\r\n     places beyond the present limits thereof, are forever\r\n     prohibited.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 6. The first, second, third, and fifth articles,\r\n     together with this article of these amendments, and the\r\n     third paragraph of the second section of the first article\r\n     of the Constitution, and the third paragraph of the second\r\n     section of the fourth article thereof, shall not be amended\r\n     or abolished without the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United\r\n     States shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive\r\n     from labor, in all cases where the marshal or other officer,\r\n     whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was prevented\r\n     from so doing by violence or intimidation, or when, after\r\n     arrest, such fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner\r\n     thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his\r\n     remedy for the recovery of such fugitive.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I have not been able to concur in opinion with those\r\nmembers of the committee who have presented the propositions just\r\nsubmitted. I do not deem them fair or equitable to the Free States,\r\nnor do I think they are likely to secure approval in those States. As\r\none member of the minority, I have drawn up a report embodying my own\r\nviews and perhaps those of some of my colleagues, which I now present\r\nfor the consideration of the Conference:\r\n\r\n     MR. BALDWIN'S MINORITY REPORT.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, one of the minority of the committee of one\r\n     from each State, to whom was referred the consideration of\r\n     the resolutions of the State of Virginia, and the other\r\n     States represented, and all propositions for the adjustment\r\n     of existing differences between the States, with authority\r\n     to report what they deem right, necessary, and proper to\r\n     restore harmony and preserve the Union, and report thereon,\r\n     entered upon the duties of the committee with an anxious\r\n     desire that they might be able to unite in the\r\n     recommendation of some plan which, on due deliberation,\r\n     should seem best adapted to maintain the dignity and\r\n     authority of the Government of the United States, and at the\r\n     same time secure to the people of every section that perfect\r\n     equality of right to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\n     Convened, as we are, on the invitation of the Governor of\r\n     Virginia, in pursuance of the resolutions of the General\r\n     Assembly of that State, with an accompanying expression of\r\n     the deliberate opinion of that body that, unless the unhappy\r\n     controversy which now divides the States shall be\r\n     satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent dissolution of the\r\n     Union is inevitable; and, being earnestly desirous of an\r\n     adjustment thereof, in concurrence with Virginia, in the\r\n     spirit in which the Constitution was originally formed, and\r\n     consistently with its principles, so as to afford to the\r\n     people of all the States adequate security for all their\r\n     rights, the attention of the undersigned was necessarily led\r\n     to the consideration of the extent and equality of our\r\n     powers, and to the propriety and expediency, under existing\r\n     circumstances, of a recommendation by this Conference\r\n     Convention of any specific action by Congress, whether of\r\n     ordinary legislation, or in reference to constitutional\r\n     amendments to be proposed by Congress on its own\r\n     responsibility to the States.\r\n\r\n     A portion of the members of this Convention are delegated by\r\n     the Legislatures of their respective States, and are\r\n     required to act under their supervision and control, while\r\n     others are the representatives only of the Executives of\r\n     their States, and, having no opportunity of consulting the\r\n     immediate representatives of the people, can only act on\r\n     their individual responsibility.\r\n\r\n     Among the resolutions and propositions suggesting modes of\r\n     adjustment appropriate to this occasion which were brought\r\n     to the notice of the committee, were the resolutions of the\r\n     State of Kentucky recommending to her sister States to unite\r\n     with her in an application to Congress for the calling of a\r\n     Convention in the mode prescribed by the Constitution for\r\n     proposing amendments thereto.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, for the reasons set forth in the\r\n     accompanying resolution, and others which have been herein\r\n     indicated, is of opinion that the mode of adjustment by a\r\n     General Convention, as proposed by Kentucky, is the one\r\n     which affords the best assurance of an adjustment acceptable\r\n     to the people of every section, as it will afford to all the\r\n     States which may desire amendments, an opportunity of\r\n     preparing them with care and deliberation, and in such form\r\n     as they may deem it expedient to prescribe, to be submitted\r\n     to the consideration and deliberate action of delegates duly\r\n     chosen and invested with equal powers from all the States.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned did not, therefore, deem it expedient that\r\n     any of the measures of adjustment proposed by the majority\r\n     of the committee, should be reported to this body to be\r\n     discussed or acted upon by them, and he respectfully submits\r\n     as a substitute for the articles of amendment to the\r\n     Constitution, reported by the majority of the committee, the\r\n     following preamble and resolution, and respectfully\r\n     recommends the adoption thereof.\r\n\r\n     ROGER S. BALDWIN.\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, unhappy differences exist which have alienated\r\n     from each other portions of the people of the United States\r\n     to such an extent as seriously to disturb the peace of the\r\n     nation, and impair the regular and efficient action of the\r\n     Government within the sphere of its constitutional powers\r\n     and duties;\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, the Legislature of the State of Kentucky has\r\n     made application to Congress to call a Convention for\r\n     proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States;\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, it is believed to be the opinion of the\r\n     people of other States that amendments to the Constitution\r\n     are or may become necessary to secure to the people of the\r\n     United States, of every section, the full and equal\r\n     enjoyment of their rights and liberties, so far as the same\r\n     may depend for their security and protection on the powers\r\n     granted to or withheld from the General Government, in\r\n     pursuance of the national purposes for which it was ordained\r\n     and established;\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, it may be expedient that such amendments as\r\n     any of the States may desire to have proposed, should be\r\n     presented to the Convention in such form as the respective\r\n     States desiring the same may deem proper;\r\n\r\n     This Convention does, therefore, recommend to the several\r\n     States to unite with Kentucky in her application to Congress\r\n     to call a convention for proposing amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, to be submitted to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States, or to conventions\r\n     therein, for ratification, as the one or the other mode of\r\n     ratification may be proposed by Congress, in accordance with\r\n     the provision in the fifth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I do not concur in the conclusions to which the majority\r\nof the committee have arrived. I may say that I wholly dissent from\r\nthem. I have not deemed it necessary to make a separate report. At a\r\nsuitable time I shall endeavor to make known to the Conference my\r\nviews upon the topics which have occupied the attention of the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nMr. CROWNINSHIELD:--I occupy substantially the same position as Mr.\r\nFIELD, and shall make my views known at a proper time.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The report presented by the majority, I think, is a wide\r\ndeparture from the course we should have adopted. Virginia has\r\nprepared and presented a plan, and has invited this Conference to\r\nconsider it. I think we ought to take up her propositions, amend and\r\nperfect them, if need be, and then adopt or reject them. To avoid all\r\nmisconstruction as to my individual opinions or position, I have\r\nreduced my views to writing, which, with the leave of the Conference,\r\nI will now read.\r\n\r\nNo objection being made, Mr. SEDDON proceeded to read the following:\r\n\r\n     REPORT OF MR. SEDDON.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, acting on the recommendation of the\r\n     Commissioners from the State of Virginia, as a member of the\r\n     committee appointed by this Convention to consider and\r\n     recommend propositions of adjustment, has not been so happy\r\n     as to accord with the report submitted by the majority; and\r\n     as he more widely dissents from the opinions entertained by\r\n     the other dissenting members, he feels constrained, in\r\n     vindication of his position and opinions, to present on his\r\n     part this brief report, recommending, as a substitute for\r\n     the report of the majority, a proposition subjoined. To this\r\n     course he feels the more impelled, by deference to the\r\n     resolutions of the General Assembly of his State, inviting\r\n     the assemblage of this Convention, and suggesting a basis of\r\n     adjustment.\r\n\r\n     These resolutions declare, that \"in the opinion of the\r\n     General Assembly of Virginia the propositions embraced in\r\n     the resolutions presented to the Senate of the United States\r\n     by the Hon. JOHN J. CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the\r\n     first article proposed as an amendment to the Constitution\r\n     of the United States shall apply to all the territory of the\r\n     United States now held or hereafter acquired south of\r\n     latitude 36° 30´, and provided that slavery of the African\r\n     race shall be effectually protected as property therein\r\n     during the continuance of the territorial government, and\r\n     the fourth article shall secure to the owners of slaves the\r\n     right of transit with their slaves between and through the\r\n     non-slaveholding States or Territories, constitute the basis\r\n     of such an adjustment of the unhappy controversy which now\r\n     divides the States of this Confederacy, as would be\r\n     accepted by the people of this Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\n     From this resolution, it is clear that the General Assembly,\r\n     in its declared opinion of what would be acceptable to the\r\n     people of Virginia, not only required the Crittenden\r\n     propositions as a basis, but also held the modifications\r\n     suggested in addition essential. In this the undersigned\r\n     fully concurs. But, in his opinion, the propositions\r\n     reported by the majority do not give, but materially weaken\r\n     the Crittenden propositions themselves, and fail to accord\r\n     the modifications suggested. The undersigned therefore,\r\n     feels it his duty to submit and recommend, as a substitute,\r\n     the resolutions referred to, as proposed by the Hon. JOHN J.\r\n     CRITTENDEN, with the incorporation of the modifications\r\n     suggested by Virginia explicitly expressed, and with some\r\n     alterations on points which, he is assured, would make them\r\n     more acceptable to that State, and, as he hopes, to the\r\n     whole Union. The propositions submitted are appended, marked\r\n     No. 1.\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, while contenting himself, in the spirit of\r\n     the action taken by the General Assembly of his State, with\r\n     the proposal of that substitute for the majority report,\r\n     would be untrue to his own convictions, shared, as he\r\n     believes, by the majority of the commissioners from\r\n     Virginia, and to his sense of duty, if he did not\r\n     emphatically declare, as his settled and deliberate\r\n     judgment, that for permanent safety in this Union, to the\r\n     slaveholding States, and the restoration of integrity to the\r\n     Union and harmony and peace to the country, a guarantee of\r\n     actual power in the Constitution and in the working of the\r\n     Government to the slaveholding and minority section is\r\n     _indispensable_. How such guarantee might be most wisely\r\n     contrived and judiciously adjusted to the frame of the\r\n     Government, the undersigned forbears now to inquire. He is\r\n     not exclusively addicted to any special plan, but believing\r\n     that such guarantee might be adequately afforded by a\r\n     partition of power in the Senate between the two sections,\r\n     and by a recognition that _ours_ is a Union of freedom and\r\n     consent, not constraint and force, he respectfully submits,\r\n     for consideration by members of the Convention, the plan\r\n     hereto appended, marked No. 2.\r\n\r\n     Whether he shall feel bound to invoke the action of the\r\n     Convention upon it, may depend on the future manifestations\r\n     of sentiment in this body.\r\n\r\n     All which is respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n     JAMES A. SEDDON.\r\n     _Commissioner from Virginia._\r\n\r\n     _February 15th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\n     No. 1.\r\n\r\n     _Joint Resolutions proposing certain amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States._\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, serious and alarming dissensions have arisen\r\n     between the Northern and Southern States, concerning the\r\n     rights and security of the rights of the slaveholding\r\n     States, and especially their rights in the common territory\r\n     of the United States; and _whereas_, it is eminently\r\n     desirable and proper that those dissensions, which now\r\n     threaten the very existence of this Union, should be\r\n     permanently quieted and settled by constitutional\r\n     provisions, which shall do equal justice to all sections,\r\n     and thereby restore to the people that peace and good will\r\n     which ought to prevail between all the citizens of the\r\n     United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, by this Convention, that the following articles\r\n     are hereby approved and submitted to the Congress of the\r\n     United States, with the request that they may, by the\r\n     requisite constitutional majority of two-thirds, be\r\n     recommended to the respective States of the Union, to be,\r\n     when ratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the States,\r\n     valid and operative as amendments of the Constitution of the\r\n     Union.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States, now\r\n     held or hereafter acquired, situate north of latitude\r\n     thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, slavery or\r\n     involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, is\r\n     prohibited, while such territory shall remain under\r\n     territorial government. In all the territory south of said\r\n     line of latitude, slavery of the African race is hereby\r\n     recognized as existing, and shall not be interfered with by\r\n     Congress, but shall be protected as property by all the\r\n     departments of the territorial government during its\r\n     continuance; and, when any territory, north or south of said\r\n     line, within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe,\r\n     shall contain the population requisite for a member of\r\n     Congress, according to the then federal ratio of\r\n     representation of the people of the United States, it shall,\r\n     if its form of government be republican, be admitted into\r\n     the Union on an equal footing with the original States, with\r\n     or without slavery, as the Constitution of such new State\r\n     may provide.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 2. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     in places under its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate\r\n     within the limits of States that permit the holding of\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 3. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     within the District of Columbia, so long as it exists in the\r\n     adjoining States of Virginia and Maryland, or either, nor\r\n     without the consent of the free white inhabitants, nor\r\n     without just compensation first made to such owners of\r\n     slaves as do not consent to such abolishment. Nor shall\r\n     Congress at any time prohibit officers of the Federal\r\n     Government, or members of Congress, whose duties require\r\n     them to be in said District, from bringing with them their\r\n     slaves, and holding them as such during the time their\r\n     duties may require them to remain there, and afterwards\r\n     taking them from the District.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 4. Congress shall have no power to prohibit or\r\n     hinder the transportation of slaves from one State to\r\n     another, or to a Territory in which slaves are by law\r\n     permitted to be held, whether that transportation be by\r\n     land, navigable rivers, or by the sea. And if such\r\n     transportation be by sea, the slaves shall be protected as\r\n     property by the Federal Government. And the right of transit\r\n     by the owners with their slaves, in passing to or from one\r\n     slaveholding State or Territory to another, between and\r\n     through the non-slaveholding States and Territories, shall\r\n     be protected. And in imposing direct taxes pursuant to the\r\n     Constitution, Congress shall have no power to impose on\r\n     slaves a higher rate of tax than on land, according to their\r\n     just value.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 5. That, in addition to the provisions of the third\r\n     paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, Congress shall provide by\r\n     law, that the United States shall pay to the owner who shall\r\n     apply for it, the full value of his fugitive slave, in all\r\n     cases, when the marshal, or other officer, whose duty it was\r\n     to arrest said fugitive, was prevented from so doing by\r\n     violence or intimidation, or when, after arrest, said\r\n     fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner thereby\r\n     prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\n     the recovery of his fugitive slave, under the said clause of\r\n     the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof. And\r\n     in all such cases, when the United States shall pay for such\r\n     fugitive, they shall reimburse themselves by imposing and\r\n     collecting a tax on the county or city in which said\r\n     violence, intimidation, or rescue was committed, equal in\r\n     amount to the sum paid by them, with the addition of\r\n     interest and the costs of collection; and the said county or\r\n     city, after it has paid said amount to the United States,\r\n     may, for its indemnity, sue and recover from the\r\n     wrong-doers, or rescuers, by whom the owner was prevented\r\n     from the recovery of his fugitive slave, in like manner as\r\n     the owner himself might have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 6. No future amendment of the Constitution shall\r\n     affect the five preceding articles, nor the third paragraph\r\n     of the second section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution, nor the third paragraph of the second section\r\n     of the fourth article of said Constitution, and no amendment\r\n     shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or\r\n     give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with\r\n     slavery in any of the States, by whose laws it is or may be\r\n     allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 7, Sec. 1. The elective franchise and the right to\r\n     hold office, whether federal, State, territorial, or\r\n     municipal, shall not be exercised by persons who are, in\r\n     whole or in part, of the African race.\r\n\r\n     And _whereas_, also, besides those causes of dissension\r\n     embraced in the foregoing amendments proposed to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, there are others which\r\n     come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may be\r\n     remedied by its legislative power: and _whereas_ it is the\r\n     desire of this Convention, as far its influence may extend,\r\n     to remove all just cause for the popular discontent and\r\n     agitation which now disturb the peace of the country, and\r\n     threaten the stability of its institutions: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     1. _Resolved_, That the laws now in force for the recovery\r\n     of fugitive slaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and\r\n     mandatory provisions of the Constitution, and have been\r\n     sanctioned as valid and constitutional by the judgment of\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States; that the\r\n     slaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance\r\n     and execution of those laws, and that they ought not to be\r\n     repealed, or so modified or changed as to impair their\r\n     efficiency; and that laws ought to be made for the\r\n     punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the slave or\r\n     other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution\r\n     of said laws.\r\n\r\n     2. That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive\r\n     slave acts, or any other constitutional acts of Congress, or\r\n     which in their operation impede, hinder, or delay the free\r\n     course and due execution of any of said acts, are null and\r\n     void by the plain provisions of the Constitution of the\r\n     United States. Yet those State laws, void as they are, have\r\n     given color to practices, and led to consequences which have\r\n     obstructed the due administration and execution of acts of\r\n     Congress, and especially the acts for the delivery of\r\n     fugitive slaves, and have thereby contributed much to the\r\n     discord and commotion now prevailing. This Convention,\r\n     therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does not deem\r\n     it improper, respectfully and earnestly to recommend the\r\n     repeal of those laws to the several States which have\r\n     enacted them, or such legislative corrections or\r\n     explanations of them as may prevent their being used or\r\n     perverted to such mischievous purposes.\r\n\r\n     3. That the act of the 18th of September, 1850, commonly\r\n     called the Fugitive Slave Law, ought to be so amended as to\r\n     make the fee of the Commissioner, mentioned in the eighth\r\n     section of the act, equal in amount, in the cases decided by\r\n     him, whether his decision be in favor of or against the\r\n     claimant. And to avoid misconstructions, the last clause of\r\n     the fifth section, of said act, which authorizes the person\r\n     holding a warrant for the arrest or detention of a fugitive\r\n     slave, to summon to his aid the _posse comitatus_, and which\r\n     declares it to be the duty of all good citizens to assist\r\n     him in its execution, ought to be so amended as to expressly\r\n     limit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall\r\n     be resistance, or danger of resistance or rescue.\r\n\r\n     4. That the laws for the suppression of the African\r\n     slave-trade, and especially those prohibiting the\r\n     importation of slaves into the United States, ought to be\r\n     made effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed, and all\r\n     further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be\r\n     promptly made.\r\n\r\n\r\n     No. 2.\r\n\r\n     _Proposed Amendments by Mr. Seddon._\r\n\r\n     To secure concert and promote harmony between the\r\n     slaveholding and non-slaveholding sections of the Union, the\r\n     assent of the majority of the Senators from the slaveholding\r\n     States, and of the majority of the Senators from the\r\n     non-slaveholding States, shall be requisite to the validity\r\n     of all action of the Senate, on which the ayes and noes may\r\n     be called by five Senators.\r\n\r\n     And on a written declaration, signed and presented for\r\n     record on the Journal of the Senate by a majority of\r\n     Senators from either the non-slaveholding or slaveholding\r\n     States, of their want of confidence in any officer or\r\n     appointee of the Executive, exercising functions exclusively\r\n     or continuously within the class of States, or any of them,\r\n     which the signers represent, then such officer shall be\r\n     removed by the Executive; and if not removed at the\r\n     expiration of ten days from the presentation of such\r\n     declaration, the office shall be deemed vacant and open to\r\n     new appointment.\r\n\r\n     The connection of every State with the Union is recognized\r\n     as depending on the continuing assent of its people, and\r\n     compulsion shall in no case, nor under any form, be\r\n     attempted by the Government of the Union against a State\r\n     acting in its collective or organic capacity. Any State, by\r\n     the action of a convention of its people, assembled pursuant\r\n     to a law of its Legislature, is held entitled to dissolve\r\n     its relation to the Federal Government, and withdraw from\r\n     the Union; and, on due notice given of such withdrawal to\r\n     the Executive of the Union, he shall appoint two\r\n     Commissioners, to meet two Commissioners to be appointed by\r\n     the Governor of the State, who, with the aid, if needed from\r\n     the disagreement of the Commissioners, of an umpire, to be\r\n     selected by a majority of them, shall equitably adjudicate\r\n     and determine finally a partition of the rights and\r\n     obligations of the withdrawing State; and such adjudication\r\n     and partition being accomplished, the withdrawal of such\r\n     State shall be recognized by the Executive, and announced by\r\n     public proclamation to the world.\r\n\r\n     But such withdrawing State shall not afterwards be\r\n     readmitted into the Union without the assent of two-thirds\r\n     of the States constituting the Union at the time of the\r\n     proposed readmission.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--It is proper that I should say a word in relation to the\r\nposition of Missouri in this Conference. It is expressly referred to\r\nin the resolution under which we hold our appointment, passed by the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives. It is believed by the people of\r\nMissouri that the rights and privileges of the slaveholding States are\r\nin danger, and that the time has arrived when they should be secured\r\nby additional guarantees. Those guarantees must be such as will secure\r\nthe honor and equal rights of the slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nI wish to say, further, that we, as Commissioners, must act at all\r\ntimes under the control of the General Assembly or the State\r\nConvention of our State. Before we can act definitely upon either of\r\nthe propositions submitted, I think it will be our duty to transmit\r\nthem to the General Assembly for instructions.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--The several reports are now before the Conference. I\r\npresume it will be the desire of every member to give them a careful\r\nexamination. In order to prevent all unnecessary delay, I move that\r\nthe several reports be laid upon the table, that they be printed at\r\nonce and distributed to the members, and made the special order of the\r\nConference for 12 o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I have drawn up a preamble and a resolution which I\r\nwish to offer for the consideration of the Conference. I shall not\r\npress action upon them to-day, but desire to have them laid on the\r\ntable and printed. I shall call them up after the report of the\r\nGeneral Committee is disposed of. It would gratify me much, and I\r\nthink greatly tend to the peace and harmony of the country, if they\r\ncould be adopted at once, and published. It is well known to most of\r\nyou that there is nothing in all the legislation or action of the Free\r\nStates, which has created so much excitement and alarm among the\r\npeople of the slaveholding States, as the passage of the so called\r\n\"personal liberty\" acts. They are regarded as deliberate infractions\r\nand breaches of the Constitution, and as attempts to nullify the\r\noperation of a constitutional enactment of Congress. But I do not wish\r\nto invite discussion upon the subject now; I hope my motion will not\r\nmeet with objection.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted, and the preamble and\r\nresolution were presented as follows:\r\n\r\n     MR. WICKLIFFE'S PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION.\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, the second section of the fourth article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States declares, \"that no person\r\n     held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any\r\n     law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service\r\n     or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to\r\n     whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\n     This clause is one of the compromises without which no\r\n     Constitution would have been adopted. It was a guarantee to\r\n     the States in which such labor and service existed by law,\r\n     that their rights should be respected and regarded by all\r\n     the States; and it is not within the competency of any State\r\n     to disregard the obligation it imposes, or to render it\r\n     valueless by legislative enactments. And _whereas_, the\r\n     House of Representatives of the United States did, on the\r\n     ---- day of February, by unanimous vote, declare that\r\n     neither the Congress of the United States nor the people or\r\n     government of any non-slaveholding State, has the\r\n     constitutional right to legislate upon, or to interfere with\r\n     slavery in any slaveholding State in the Union.\r\n\r\n     This declaration is regarded by this Convention as an\r\n     admission that the statutes of those States, passed for the\r\n     purpose of defeating the provision of the Constitution\r\n     aforesaid, and the laws of Congress made to enforce the just\r\n     and proper execution of this constitutional guarantee, are\r\n     in violation of the supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n     The provisions of the statutes in many of the\r\n     non-slaveholding States, commonly known and called \"personal\r\n     liberty bills,\" amount in their consequences to a practical\r\n     nullification of the acts of Congress of February 12th,\r\n     1793, and September 18th, 1850, and are in violation of the\r\n     second section of the fourth article of the Constitution, as\r\n     before stated. That the spirit of those statutes appears to\r\n     be repugnant to the principles of compromise and mutual and\r\n     liberal concessions which dictated the section of the\r\n     Constitution in question, and which pervades every part of\r\n     that instrument. It is, therefore, respectfully requested by\r\n     this Convention that the several States abrogate all such\r\n     obnoxious enactments.\r\n\r\n     That the spirit of comity between the States, and the spirit\r\n     of unity and fraternity which should actuate all the people\r\n     of these United States, require that complete right and\r\n     security of transit with all persons who owe them service or\r\n     labor should be allowed to the citizens of each State by the\r\n     laws of every other State.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a copy of the foregoing be sent by the\r\n     President of this Convention to the Governors of each of the\r\n     free States, as the deliberate judgment and opinion of this\r\n     Convention, and that he request the same be laid before\r\n     their respective Legislatures.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I move that all the resolutions, of the States, under\r\nwhich Commissioners have been appointed, or relating to subjects to\r\ncome before this Conference, be printed. I think this course\r\nconvenient and necessary, and one reason that I may assign is this:\r\nThe opinion of the Legislature of the State of Ohio, as expressed in\r\none of the resolutions adopted by that body, is, that it would have\r\nbeen wiser and better if the time for holding this Conference had been\r\ndeferred until a later period. Ohio has expressly said in her\r\nresolutions that she is not prepared to assent to the terms of\r\nsettlement proposed by Virginia, and has expressed the opinion that\r\nthe Constitution as it now stands, if fairly interpreted and obeyed,\r\ncontains ample provision for the correction of all the evils which are\r\nclaimed to exist. Nevertheless she is willing to meet in a friendly\r\nspirit and consult with her sister States. But the opinion extensively\r\nprevails that this Conference ought not to have been called upon so\r\nshort a notice and before the inauguration of the incoming\r\nadministration. We, the Commissioners from that State, are instructed\r\nin the resolutions, to which I have referred, to use our influence to\r\nprocure an adjournment of this Conference, before final action is\r\ntaken, to the 4th of April next. I shall feel it my duty, at some\r\nfuture time, to make a motion to that effect. The extent to which I\r\nshall urge its adoption will depend in some measure upon the course of\r\nevents and the opinions of my colleagues. In the mean time I wish to\r\nsee all the resolutions printed.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CHASE was agreed to. The resolutions as printed will\r\nbe found in the appendix.\r\n\r\nMr. ALLEN, of Massachusetts:--Before the adjournment to-day I desire\r\nto know what will be the order of business when these various reports\r\ncome up for discussion. By the general rules governing parliamentary\r\nproceedings, to which I suppose we are subject, I understand the first\r\nquestion will be upon the substitution of the minority report\r\npresented by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. BALDWIN) for the\r\nreport of the majority; and that, upon that question, amendments may\r\nbe offered, and either accepted or rejected, both to the reports of\r\nthe majority and the minority. I think it would be well to have this\r\nmatter understood. Am I right in this?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Chair understands that the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts has correctly pointed out the manner of proceeding.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. HACKLEMAN, the Conference then adjourned until 12\r\no'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 16th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by the PRESIDENT at 12 o'clock M.\r\n\r\nPrayer was offered by Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Journal was read by the Assistant Secretary, Mr. PULESTON, and,\r\nbeing corrected, was approved.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I have received a communication from Mr. W.C. JEWETT,\r\nwhich I am requested to lay before the Conference. Should any member\r\ndesire to have it read, it will be presented upon motion. I am not\r\ninclined to occupy the time of the Conference by reading it, unless\r\nsome member specially requests that it be read.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Let it be laid on the table without reading.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--That disposition will be made of it.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I am instructed, by the Committee on Rules and\r\nOrganization, to propose an amendment to the Eleventh Rule which has\r\nbeen adopted. As the Rule now stands, no appeal is allowed from the\r\ndecision of the Chair upon questions of order. It is not probable that\r\neither the Chair or the Conference would wish to be bound in that way.\r\nThe purpose of the resolution is to assimilate the Rule in this\r\nrespect to the practice in parliamentary bodies, and to allow an\r\nappeal from the decision of the Chair to the Conference itself. I\r\noffer the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the Eleventh Rule of this Convention be so\r\n     amended as to allow an appeal from the decision of the\r\n     PRESIDENT, which appeal shall be decided without debate.\"\r\n\r\nOn the passage of this resolution a division was called for, and upon\r\na count by the Secretaries, the PRESIDENT declared it adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I now offer another resolution--the following:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That in the discussions which may take place in\r\n     this Convention, no member shall be allowed to speak longer\r\n     than thirty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nWe must all by this time be impressed with the necessity of prompt,\r\nimmediate, and efficient action. I do not charge any member of the\r\nbody with any purpose unnecessarily to consume the time of the\r\nConvention in making speeches. I have no reason to believe that any\r\nsuch purpose exists. But the present Congress is rapidly drawing to a\r\nclose. If any plan is adopted it will be nugatory, unless recommended\r\nby Congress. If we are to sit here until each member of the Conference\r\nhas spoken upon each question presented, as many times and as long as\r\nhe pleases, I fear the Congress will close its labors before we do\r\nours.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIS:--I think thirty minutes quite too long. Our opinions are\r\nformed. Before this time probably every member has determined his\r\ncourse of action, and it will not be changed by debate. I move to\r\nstrike out the word \"thirty,\" and insert the word \"ten.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I am altogether opposed to this attempt in advance to\r\ncut off or limit debate. I am sure it cannot meet with favor from the\r\nConference, for reasons so obvious that I will not occupy time in\r\nstating them. I move to lay the resolution on the table.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen here interposed and appealed to Mr. HITCHCOCK to\r\nwithdraw his motion, as it would cut off all debate upon the merits of\r\nthe resolution. Mr. HITCHCOCK accordingly withdrew it.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--We have one rule already which prohibits any member from\r\nspeaking more than twice upon any question without special leave, and\r\na member cannot speak a second time until every other, who desires to\r\nspeak, has spoken. This was the rule, I believe, in the Convention\r\nthat formed our present Constitution, and no one complained of its\r\noperation there. I am as much impressed with the necessity of\r\nexpediting our action as any one can be, and should be among the last\r\nto protract our sessions. But this resolution looks too much like\r\nsuppressing discussion--like cutting off debate. I desire at the\r\nproper time to be heard upon the report which I have submitted. It\r\nwill be impossible to discuss the grave questions involved in it in\r\nthe space of a brief half hour.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I hope Governor WICKLIFFE will consent to a postponement\r\nof his resolution for the present. It is anticipating a necessity that\r\nmay not arise. As yet no one has abused the privileges of debate. It\r\nis not well to assume in advance that any one will do so.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I have no wish to press this resolution upon the\r\nConvention, and it may be as well to postpone it for the present. I\r\nwill move its postponement until Tuesday morning next.\r\n\r\nThe motion to postpone was unanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I move that the hour of meeting hereafter be ten\r\no'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Maryland:--I am sure that we shall all agree that this\r\nhour is quite too early. I wish to make all reasonable progress, but I\r\nthink we shall find it difficult to secure a quorum at that hour. I\r\nmove to amend by inserting _eleven_ o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I think we had better let the hour of meeting remain where\r\nour rules leave it. We shall find our labors severe enough if we\r\ncommence at twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I will accept the amendment of my colleague. Let the\r\ntime of meeting be eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CRISFIELD as amended was agreed to without a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I have a motion which I desire to make, and as I do not\r\nwish to press it to a vote at the present time, I will move to lay it\r\non the table. But I wish to have it before the Conference. It is\r\napparent to me that we ought to pass it at some time, in order to give\r\nmembers who may belong to delegations in which differences of opinion\r\nexist, an opportunity of appearing on the record as they personally\r\nwish to vote. I move to amend the first rule by inserting after the\r\nword \"representing,\" the words, \"The yeas and nays of the delegates\r\nfrom each State, on any question, shall be entered on the Journal when\r\nit is desired by any delegate.\"\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. CHASE, the amendment was laid upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the order of the\r\nday, the question being upon the several reports presented by the\r\nGeneral Committee of one from each State.\r\n\r\nThe chair was taken, at the request of the PRESIDENT, by Mr.\r\nALEXANDER, of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I move to substitute the report presented by myself for\r\nthe report of the majority of the Committee. I will consent to strike\r\nout that part of it which relates to--\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--Before the gentleman from Connecticut proceeds with his\r\nargument I trust he will give way for the introduction of a\r\nresolution. I am sure the time has come when we ought to pass such a\r\nresolution as I now offer. I am unwilling to sit here longer unless\r\nsome means are taken to secure a report of our proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--A resolution is not now in order.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I ask that the resolution may be read for the information\r\nof the Conference, and also ask the leave of the Conference for its\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was read. It provided for the appointment of a\r\nstenographer.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken, and upon a division the leave to introduce it\r\nwas refused.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I rise for the purpose of supporting my motion to\r\nsubstitute the report presented by myself for that presented by the\r\nmajority of the committee. As I was about to remark, when the\r\nresolution just disposed of was introduced, I will consent to strike\r\nout all that portion of my report which precedes the words \"whereas\r\nunhappy differences,\" &c., in order that the substitute offered may\r\nconform more nearly in substance to the proposition of the majority.\r\nIt seems desirable on all hands that whatever we adopt here should be\r\npresented to Congress; and if it receives the sanction of that body,\r\nshould be by it presented to the States for their approval. My report\r\nwhen thus amended will be in a proper form for such a disposition.\r\n\r\nMy report, it will be noticed, is based mainly upon the action of the\r\nLegislature of Kentucky. I have adopted those resolutions of Kentucky\r\nas the basis of my recommendation, on account of the short time which\r\nremains for any action at all, and because it appears to me that the\r\nkind of proceeding indicated in them is best calculated to meet with\r\nfavor in the States which must approve any action taken here before it\r\ncan be made effectual.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of Virginia, under which this Convention is called,\r\nwere adopted on the 19th of January last. The resolutions of Kentucky\r\nto which I have referred were adopted on the 25th of the same month.\r\nIt is not only the necessary presumption that the latter were passed\r\nwith a full knowledge of the action of Virginia, but I understand from\r\ntheir reading that they were adopted in consequence of the proposition\r\nof the latter State. I am disposed to favor the line of policy\r\ninitiated in the resolutions of the State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of presenting amendments to the Constitution\r\nprovided in that instrument. By the first, by Congress whenever\r\ntwo-thirds of both Houses shall deem such amendments necessary: or by\r\nthe second, the same body, upon the application of the Legislatures of\r\ntwo-thirds of the States, may call a convention for the purpose of\r\nproposing amendments. These two are the _only_ modes in which, under\r\nthat instrument, amendments can be proposed to the Constitution.\r\nEither of these is adequate, and it was the manifest intention of its\r\nframers to secure due consideration of any changes which might be\r\nproposed to the fundamental law of our Government.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded on all hands that our action here will amount to\r\nnothing, unless it meets the approval of Congress, and such proposals\r\nof amendment as we shall agree upon are recommended by that body to\r\nthe States for adoption. The session of the present Congress is\r\ndrawing to a close. There remain only fifteen or sixteen days during\r\nwhich it can transact business. Can any one suppose that in the\r\npresent state of the country, with the large number of important\r\nmeasures before Congress and awaiting its action, any proposition of\r\nreal importance emanating from this Conference could be properly\r\nconsidered by either House in this short time? I am assuming just now\r\nthat this is a Convention which has the right, under the Constitution\r\nor by precedent, to make such propositions. But if we do not remember,\r\nmost certainly Congress will, that however respectable this body may\r\nbe, however large may be the constituency which it represents, it is,\r\nafter all, one which has no existence under, and is not recognized by\r\nthe Constitution. In a recent speech in the Senate, Judge COLLAMER, of\r\nVermont, one of the ablest lawyers in that body, has more than\r\nintimated a doubt whether Congress could, under the Constitution,\r\nentertain proposals of amendment presented to it by such a body as\r\nthis. But, waiving all technicalities, the substantial objection which\r\ninfluences my mind is, that the course of action proposed by the\r\nmajority of the committee is contrary to the spirit of the\r\nConstitution. When the people adopted that instrument and subjected\r\nthemselves to its operation, they intended and had a right to\r\nunderstand that it should be amended only in the manner provided by\r\nthe Constitution itself. They did not intend that amendments should be\r\nproposed under, or the existence of the Constitution endangered by any\r\nextraneous pressure whatever. They wisely provided a way in which\r\namendments might be proposed, or rather two ways. Under either of\r\nthem, due examination and consideration was secured. They would not\r\nhave consented to any other way of proposing amendments. The General\r\nGovernment, on the adoption of the Constitution, for all national\r\npurposes, took the place of the State Governments. The people of the\r\nUnited States from that time, in the language of a distinguished\r\nSenator from Kentucky, owed a paramount allegiance to the General\r\nGovernment, and a subordinate allegiance only to the State\r\nGovernments. Changes in the Constitution, then, can only be _properly_\r\nmade in the manner provided by the Constitution. Propositions for\r\nchanges in it must come from the people, or their representatives in\r\nCongress. Any attempt to coerce Congress, or to influence its action\r\nin a manner not provided by the Constitution, is a disregard of the\r\nrights of the people.\r\n\r\nWhy are we assembled here to urge these amendments upon Congress? to\r\ninduce Congress to recommend them to the people for adoption? Are we\r\nthe representatives of the people of the United States? Are we acting\r\nfor them, and as their authorized agents, in this endeavor to press\r\namendments upon the attention of Congress? Because, if our action is\r\nto have any effect at all, it must be to induce Congress to conform to\r\nour wishes--to propose the very amendments which we prepare.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House of Representatives were elected by the\r\npeople. They were selected to perform, and they do perform, their\r\nduties and functions under the obligations of their official oaths.\r\nThere is no question about their agency, or their right to act in the\r\npremises. The Constitution makes them the agents of the people. The\r\nLegislature of the State of Kentucky, well understanding and\r\nappreciating the only true method in which constitutional amendments\r\nshould be proposed, with all the formality of a legislative act\r\napproved by the Executive of that State, has applied to Congress for\r\nthe call of a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution\r\nof the United States, and has requested the President to lay those\r\nresolutions immediately before Congress. She wishes other States to\r\nunite with her in the preparing and proposing of amendments to the\r\nConstitution. This is the correct, the legal, the patriotic course.\r\nThis was what Kentucky had the right to ask, and this is all she has\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN here read the Kentucky resolutions, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolutions recommending a call for a Convention of the\r\n     United States._\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, The people of some of the States feel themselves\r\n     deeply aggrieved by the policy and measures which have been\r\n     adopted by some of the people of the other States; and\r\n     _whereas_ an amendment of the Constitution of the United\r\n     States is deemed indispensably necessary to secure them\r\n     against similar grievances in the future: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\r\n     Kentucky, that application to Congress to call a Convention\r\n     for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, pursuant to the fifth article thereof, be, and the\r\n     same is hereby, now made by this General Assembly of\r\n     Kentucky; and we hereby invite our sister States to unite\r\n     with us, without delay, in a similar application to\r\n     Congress.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Governor of this State forthwith\r\n     communicate the foregoing resolution to the President of the\r\n     United States, with the request that he immediately place\r\n     the same before Congress and the Executives of the several\r\n     States, with a request that they lay them before their\r\n     respective Legislatures.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, If the Convention be called in accordance with\r\n     the provisions of the foregoing resolutions, the Legislature\r\n     of the Commonwealth of Kentucky suggest for the\r\n     consideration of that Convention, as a basis for settling\r\n     existing difficulties, the adoption, by way of amendments to\r\n     the Constitution, of the resolutions offered in the Senate\r\n     of the United States by the Hon. JOHN J. CRITTENDEN.\r\n\r\n     DAVID MERIWETHER,\r\n     _Speaker of the House of Representatives._\r\n\r\n     THOMAS P. PORTER,\r\n     _Speaker of the Senate._\r\n\r\n     Approved January 25, 1861.\r\n       B. MAGOFFIN.\r\n\r\n     By the Governor:\r\n       THOMAS B. MONROE, JR.,\r\n         _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN continued:--Now, what are we asked to do by the majority\r\nof the committee? It is not to unite with Kentucky or to accede to her\r\nwishes for a convention of the States, under the Constitution, but to\r\nthwart the wishes of Kentucky, and to induce Congress itself to\r\noriginate and propose amendments, or to propose those which we may\r\noriginate. Kentucky asks that the people of the States themselves\r\nmight elect delegates to a convention, who should carefully consider\r\nthe whole subject. The Kentucky resolutions were transmitted to the\r\nPresident, who sent them to Congress, as he said, with great pleasure.\r\nKentucky stated that she was in favor of the so-called Crittenden\r\nresolutions, but she did not request Congress to propose them as\r\namendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHow is this body constituted? Do we, its members, represent the people\r\nof the several States? Have they had an opportunity to elect\r\ndelegates, to select those in whom they had confidence and whom they\r\ncould trust? Not at all. Why should we assemble here and express our\r\nwishes to Congress in reference to the Constitution without permitting\r\nCalifornia, Oregon, or many other States not here represented, to\r\nunite in our deliberations? I cannot assent to such an unfair\r\nproceeding toward other States.\r\n\r\nSuppose one-half the States should request Congress to propose\r\namendments, will Congress agree to it? No, sir. The Constitution\r\nprovides that Congress shall not propose amendments without the\r\nconsent of two-thirds of the States. Congress has not deemed any\r\namendments necessary, so far as we know, and yet a majority of the\r\ncommittee of this body ask Congress to propose the amendments on our\r\nresponsibility alone. It appears to me, then, that this proceeding\r\nmust be regarded not as one known to the Constitution, but as a\r\nrevolutionary proceeding. All the States are not represented here, nor\r\nhave all had an opportunity to be so represented. Some of us are\r\nacting under the appointment of the Legislatures of our States; other\r\ndelegates are simply appointed by the Executives of their States and\r\nare acting without any legal authority. We are not standing upon equal\r\nground; some are only acting upon their own judgment; others are\r\nacting under instructions from their several Legislatures. If the\r\nVirginia Legislature itself were here, its action would differ\r\nmaterially from the present views of the delegates from that State.\r\n\r\nBut how is this? The Resolutions of the Legislature of Virginia make\r\nthe statement that unless these questions are settled, and settled\r\nsoon, there is danger of the disruption of the Union. Admit this to be\r\nso, and it furnishes no reason for changing the mode of proposing\r\nconstitutional amendments. The Constitution knows no such danger. It\r\nis a self-sustaining Constitution, and was supposed to contain within\r\nitself the power to secure its own preservation. The Constitution\r\nought not to be amended without the deliberate action of the people\r\nthemselves. I cannot and I will not disregard their rights. I cannot\r\nrecognize the claim that the secession of a State, by an ordinance of\r\nits Convention, can carry either the State or its people out of the\r\nUnion. There is no such thing as _legal_ secession, for there is no\r\npower anywhere to take the people out of the protecting care of the\r\nGovernment, or to relieve them from their obligations to it.\r\n\r\nAnd where is the clause in the Constitution that authorizes the call\r\nupon Congress to do what Congress is asked to do here? The\r\nConstitution was adopted \"to form a more perfect Union.\" The people\r\nwere not to be allowed to alter it, except in the two modes prescribed\r\nin it. The Convention which adopted it did not propose that changes\r\nshould be made in it without ample time for deliberation and\r\ndiscussion. We are here, then, simply as conferees from States\r\nexpressing our individual opinions. We are now asked to recommend to\r\nCongress amendments to our fundamental law; we have no more right to\r\ndo so than members of the so-called Southern Confederacy. We, a mere\r\nfraction of the people, propose to unite in bringing a pressure upon\r\nCongress, which shall induce it to propose these amendments. This was\r\nnot one of the modes contemplated or provided by the framers of that\r\nsacred instrument.\r\n\r\nGeneral WASHINGTON presided over the Convention which prepared our\r\nConstitution. None knew better than he the reasons which made its\r\nadoption necessary to the preservation of the Government--none knew\r\nbetter the dangers which would probably surround it in after years. In\r\nthat last counsel of his to the American people--his Farewell\r\nAddress--a paper drawn up with the greatest deliberation, embodying\r\nopinions which he entertained as the result of a long life of active\r\nstudy and reflection, he warns us against all such proceedings as\r\nthose contemplated by the majority of the committee. I am sure the\r\ndelegates from Virginia will not now refuse to listen to the words of\r\nthat illustrious man, uttered upon the most solemn and momentous\r\noccasion of his life. Hear his words:\r\n\r\n     \"Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your\r\n     welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the\r\n     apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me\r\n     on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn\r\n     contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review,\r\n     some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of\r\n     no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me\r\n     all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a\r\n     people. These will be offered to you with more freedom, as\r\n     you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a\r\n     parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to\r\n     bias his counsel.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     \"But as it is easy to foresee, that from different causes\r\n     and from different quarters much pains will be taken, many\r\n     artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction\r\n     of this truth; as this is the point in your political\r\n     fortress, against which the batteries of internal and\r\n     external enemies will be most constantly and actively\r\n     (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of\r\n     infinite moment that you should properly estimate the\r\n     immense value of your national union to your collective and\r\n     individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial,\r\n     habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming\r\n     yourselves to think and speak of it as the Palladium of your\r\n     political safety and prosperity; watching for its\r\n     preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever\r\n     may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be\r\n     abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning\r\n     of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from\r\n     the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link\r\n     together the various parts.\"\r\n\r\nAre not these admonitions at the present moment peculiarly worthy of\r\nour attention? And with them before us, can we invoke the action of\r\nCongress for the alteration of the fundamental law of the Government\r\nin any other ways than those provided in the Constitution? I earnestly\r\nhope not. If we act at all, let us act in that regular method which\r\ngives time for consultation, for consideration, and for action among\r\nthe people of all the States. It appears to me, that in adopting the\r\nline of policy proposed by the majority of the committee, we are doing\r\nthe very thing which WASHINGTON warned us not to do.\r\n\r\nHe said further:\r\n\r\n     \"To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government\r\n     for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however\r\n     strict, between the parts, can be an adequate substitute;\r\n     they must inevitably experience the infractions and\r\n     interruptions which all alliances in all times have\r\n     experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have\r\n     improved upon your first essay, by the adoption of a\r\n     Constitution of Government better calculated than your\r\n     former for an intimate union, and for the efficacious\r\n     management of your common concerns. This Government, the\r\n     offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unmoved,\r\n     adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation,\r\n     completely free in its principles, in the distribution of\r\n     its powers, uniting security with energy, and _containing\r\n     within itself a provision for its own amendment_, has a just\r\n     claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its\r\n     authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its\r\n     measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of\r\n     true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the\r\n     right of the people to make and to alter their Constitutions\r\n     of Government. But the Constitution which at any time\r\n     exists, _till changed by an explicit and authentic act of\r\n     the whole_ people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     \"Toward the preservation of your Government, and the\r\n     permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite, not\r\n     only that you should steadily discountenance irregular\r\n     oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you\r\n     resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its\r\n     principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of\r\n     assault may be to affect in the forms of the Constitution\r\n     alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and\r\n     thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all\r\n     the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time\r\n     and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true\r\n     character of governments, as of other human institutions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd still further:\r\n\r\n     \"If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or\r\n     modification of the constitutional powers be in any\r\n     particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the\r\n     way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no\r\n     change by usurpation; for though this in one instance may be\r\n     the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which\r\n     free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always\r\n     greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or\r\n     transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\"\r\n\r\nIf we adopt the majority report here, we attempt to correct the\r\nConstitution by an amendment in a way which, the Constitution does\r\n_not_ designate. WASHINGTON says if there is any thing wrong, let it\r\nbe corrected in a constitutional way; and that, sir, is just what\r\nKentucky has said, and that is what every loyal State will say.\r\nKentucky has inaugurated this proceeding, and it is one eminently\r\nworthy of her--true as she has always been to the Union. I cannot\r\ndisregard this action of her Legislature. I do not think any exigency\r\nexists which requires us to disregard it. I am ready, and my State is\r\nready, to confer with other States in reference to the Constitution,\r\nwhen asked to do so in any of the modes pointed out by that\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these opinions, and with these convictions, I should be\r\nuntrue to my sense of duty to the Government and the State I\r\nrepresent, and to the people of the United States, if I should consent\r\nto disregard the Constitution and my obligations to it.\r\n\r\nI have stated these considerations because they are powerful enough to\r\ninfluence and control my course. Others must act upon their own\r\nconvictions. I have come to the conclusion that I ought to submit this\r\nminority report with distrust, and with distrust only, because so many\r\nof the able statesmen composing the majority of the committee have\r\nseen fit to adopt different views. My report leaves every thing to the\r\npeople, where I think every such question should be left. When they\r\nconsult together and decide in the constitutional way I shall bow to\r\ntheir decision, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I do not propose to follow the gentleman (Mr. BALDWIN)\r\nthrough all the ramifications of his speech. I have made the\r\nConstitution my study for many years, and I have looked at the causes\r\nwhich give it strength and the causes which give it weakness. I\r\nbelieve that our fathers organized this Government in great wisdom.\r\nIts strength was in the affections of the people. It never had any\r\nother strength, and it was never intended it should have. It was not\r\nintended to be sustained by standing armies. Its strength was intended\r\nto be placed in the affections of the people, and I had hoped it would\r\nendure forever. Without the affections of the people it is the weakest\r\nGovernment ever established. The people! What a spectacle do we\r\nwitness now! One portion of the people has lost confidence in the\r\nGovernment, and now seven States have left it. The Government cannot\r\nrealize that they are gone. We have established the right of\r\nrevolution, and that right gave to the world this splendid Government.\r\nThis was the first precedent; it will stand for all time. It will\r\nalways be acted upon when the people have lost confidence in the\r\nGovernment. I _hate_ that word secession, because it is a cheat! Call\r\nthings by their right names! The Southern States have framed another\r\nGovernment; they have originated a _revolution_. There is no warrant\r\nfor it in the Constitution, but it is like the right of self-defence,\r\nwhich every man may exercise. The gentleman from Connecticut has\r\nforgotten that the Government made Congress the recipient of\r\npetitions. Why was this? It was that Congress might be influenced by\r\nthe wishes of the people and act upon them.\r\n\r\nWe are twenty States assembled here. Congress has been in session more\r\nthan two months. The Government is falling to pieces. Congress has not\r\nhad the sagacity to give the necessary guarantees, the proper\r\nassurances to the slaveholding States. This session will make a\r\nshameful chapter in the history of this Government, to be hereafter\r\nwritten. Why should this Congress refuse to give the people\r\nguarantees? The proudest Governments in the world have been compelled\r\nto give their people guarantees.\r\n\r\nWe are assembled here to consult, and see what can be done; to consult\r\nas representatives of the States. Is there any impropriety in our\r\nstating what would restore confidence, to our putting this in writing,\r\nand to our proposing the plan of restoration we think should be\r\nadopted to Congress, and asking Congress to submit that plan to the\r\npeople? Are we not the representatives of the people, sent here to do\r\nwhat we think ought to be done, and to ask Congress by way of petition\r\nto repair the foundations of the Government? It is all legitimate,\r\nand legitimate in the most technical sense.\r\n\r\nSuppose we ask Congress to act on this proposition. We come directly\r\nfrom the people. We ask Congress to submit a plan which we think will\r\nsave the Government, to the people. Is this taking any advantage of\r\nthe States? _They_ can take all the time they wish for deliberation,\r\nand we can bring no pressure to bear on them. In these times of great\r\nperil and trouble, we ask Congress, backed by the moral force of the\r\nStates we represent, to act and save the country.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years hence will not answer. The foundations of the\r\nGovernment are undermined and growing weaker every day, and if the\r\npeople who may give to it the necessary repair and strength do not do\r\nso, they will be called to a fearful account. When the building is on\r\nfire, it is no time to inquire who set it on fire. The North say the\r\nSouth did it, and the South say the North did it.\r\n\r\nWe are all interested in this Government; we love the Constitution; we\r\nlove the Union; we want to repair it--we want to lay the foundation\r\nfor bringing back the States who have left us, by reason and not by\r\nthe sword. The delay which the gentleman proposes is too long; the\r\nConstitution has provided a shorter way. In adopting that we are only\r\nrecognizing the right of petition.\r\n\r\nI, sir, will answer to Kentucky; I don't want the gentleman to come\r\nbetween me and the people of Kentucky. He has no right to speak for\r\nthe people of that State--her representatives here have that right and\r\nwill exercise it. Why were these resolutions passed? Because Congress\r\nhad failed to provide the means needful to our safety. The resolutions\r\nunder which the Kentucky delegation came here were passed on the 29th,\r\nnot the 25th of January. They were passed after the resolutions to\r\nwhich the gentleman refers. They ought to be regarded, as they are in\r\nfact, as the deliberate expression of the Legislature of Kentucky in\r\nfavor of this Conference. In them it is stated that Kentucky heartily\r\naccepts the invitation of her old mother Virginia. She acts in no\r\nunwilling spirit, she hastens to avail herself of any opportunity to\r\nsave the Government. She believes a favorable opportunity is offered\r\nby this Conference. I repeat again: Adopt the report of the majority\r\nof the committee and I will answer to Kentucky. I will go farther. I\r\nwill answer that Kentucky herself will adopt the very proposals of\r\namendment to the Constitution contained in the committee's report.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman insists that the action proposed is not only\r\nimproper but that it is _revolutionary_. I deny that it is\r\nrevolutionary. It is no more revolutionary than any other form of\r\npetition. It is a petition sustained by the moral force of twenty\r\nStates--a petition which Congress will not disregard.\r\n\r\nBut if the report of the majority is revolutionary, what of the\r\ngentleman's report? Is that provided for by the Constitution? Is that\r\naccording to the forms of the Constitution? No, sir. Every argument he\r\nhas brought against the report of the majority, applies with equal\r\nforce to his own. His views will answer for those who are willing to\r\nstand by and see this Government drift toward destruction--to see this\r\ncountry involved in civil war. It will answer for those who will\r\noppose all action, and who wish to do nothing at all. His report is a\r\nnew excuse for inaction. It will not answer for us.\r\n\r\nSir, we are acting under a fearful responsibility. The eyes of every\r\ntrue patriot in the nation are turned toward this body. The people are\r\nawaiting our action, with anxious and painful solicitude. They know\r\nand we know that, unless the wisdom of this Conference shall devise\r\nsome plan to satisfy the people of the slaveholding States--to quiet\r\ntheir apprehensions, a disruption of the Government is inevitable. If\r\nwe adopt the gentleman's views, go home and do nothing, we take the\r\nresponsibility of breaking up the Government.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to discuss the merits of the majority report at the\r\npresent time. I have only sought to answer the arguments of the\r\ngentleman against our acting at all. But I claim that this way of\r\nproceeding is entirely irregular. The report of the gentleman is not\r\nin order. The report of the majority was first presented, and should\r\nbe first acted upon. I move to lay the report of the gentleman from\r\nConnecticut upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I would ask Mr. GUTHRIE to withdraw his motion. If the\r\nmotion were adopted it would prevent discussion. It was expected that\r\nwe were to discuss the subject to-day. It is not of much consequence\r\nwhich report is first acted upon. They are all before the Conference,\r\nand the merits of all of them are under discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE withdrew the motion to lay on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky, took the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I am a member of the present Congress; I have faithfully\r\nattended its deliberations, and have anxiously watched its course. Mr.\r\nGUTHRIE will find that there are other and different objections to the\r\nline of policy he proposes, to which he has not alluded, and which he\r\ndoes not understand. But they are objections which have determined,\r\nand will determine, the action of Congress. I would ask Mr. GUTHRIE if\r\nthe adoption of his propositions, previous to their action, would have\r\nprevented the States which have already seceded from going out.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I think it would have prevented them; all but South\r\nCarolina. I did not intend to assail Congress, or any member of it,\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I do not agree with the gentleman. We know, and the\r\ngentleman knows, that there has been for a long time a purpose, a\r\ngreat conspiracy in this country, to begin and carry out a revolution.\r\nThat has been avowed over and over again in the halls of Congress. Can\r\nyou expect a member of Congress to do more than reflect the will of\r\nhis constituents, the will of his people? Would you have him do any\r\nthing different? There were forty or fifty different propositions\r\nbefore the Congressional Committee of Thirty-three. There are many\r\nhere. There are many difficulties attending the solution of this\r\nquestion in every respect. But we may as well speak plainly. I cannot\r\ngo for the majority report of the committee, and among other reasons,\r\nfor this reason: Their proposition makes all territory we may\r\nhereafter acquire slave territory.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--No; such is not the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I have read it, and such is my construction.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--Such is not the intention.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--Any future territory which we acquire must be from the\r\nsouth; we have extended as far as we can to the north and the\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Will you agree to divide all future territory?\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I will do almost any thing to save the Union. I will\r\nreflect the will of my constituents. I think it ought not to be\r\ndivided equally, but the South ought to have its share. There is\r\nanother trouble. Look at the difficulty of getting any proposition\r\nthrough Congress. Congress has only fifteen days of life. I ask you,\r\neven with general unanimity, if you can hope to pass at this session\r\nany new proposals of amendments? If you do, you will get along faster\r\nthan is generally the case. There is one proposition before Congress\r\nthat I believe can pass. It is the Adams proposition, to admit all the\r\nterritories south at once. It is already slave territory. It is now\r\napplying for admission. If this is acceptable to the South, I will go\r\nfor it. We are bound to admit it under the ordinance of 1789.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--Do I understand my friend to claim that the ordinance\r\nof 1789 involves a proposition to divide the territory?\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I understand that in connection with the subsequent\r\nlegislation it does.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--The concession of territory from North Carolina\r\ncontains a prohibition from acting on the subject of slavery in the\r\nterritory ceded.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I agree entirely with the gentleman. I am opposed to\r\nslavery, but we must divide the territory. Let us leave slavery where\r\nit is, and admit the territory for the purpose of settling the\r\nquestion. I do not agree with Mr. GUTHRIE that this Government depends\r\non the will of the people. It is a self-supporting government; it will\r\nsupport itself. There is no justification for the action of the\r\nseceded States, and I cannot agree that Congress is responsible for\r\ntheir action. The secession plot was formed before Congress assembled.\r\nThere _was_ a power to check it. If our President had acted as Jackson\r\ndid, there would have been an end of it. The day for hanging for\r\ntreason has gone by. We must look at things as they are. Even in\r\nbattle the white flag must be respected. Let this subject be frankly\r\ndiscussed in a conciliatory manner. If any State has the right to go\r\nout of the Union at its own volition, then this Government, in my\r\nopinion, is not worth the trouble of preserving. The President is\r\nsworn to protect and uphold the Government. So long as there is a\r\nnavy, an army, and a militia, it is his sworn duty to uphold it--to\r\nuphold it as well against an attack from States as from individuals.\r\nThe Government is one of love and affection, it is true, but it is\r\nalso one of strength, and power. Where was there ever a more indulgent\r\npeople than ours? Our forts have been taken, our flag has been fired\r\nupon, our property seized, and as yet nothing has been done. But they\r\nwill not be indulgent forever. Beware, gentlemen, how you force them\r\nfurther. Gentlemen talk about the inefficiency of Congress; I wish\r\nthere was some efficiency in the Executive. If there was, or had been,\r\nour present troubles would have been avoided.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I do not understand that the report of the majority is\r\napplicable to future territory. I move the recommitment of the report,\r\nto have that question settled.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--It is true there are different constructions which may\r\nbe placed on the report. I think if it had been understood to apply to\r\nfuture territory, it could not have received the support of a majority\r\nof the committee. Mr. CRITTENDEN'S proposition applies to future\r\nterritory. I submitted a proposition to the committee also intended to\r\napply to future territory. A majority of the committee was opposed to\r\nit. Mr. EWING drew this part of the amendment, and there is some\r\ndifference of opinion about it. In my opinion the amendment would not\r\napply to future territory, and I intended at the proper time to offer\r\nan amendment which should make it plain, and not leave it open to\r\nconstruction. Personally, I should be glad to apply it to future\r\nterritory, but I shall yield. I think if we can settle the question\r\nnow, there will be no further trouble. I do not believe any territory\r\nwill be acquired hereafter without great unanimity. It is not quite\r\ntrue, although it may be probable, that the future territory will be\r\nsouth of the line proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I am still more confirmed that it was the intention of\r\nthe committee to have the amendment only apply to existing territory.\r\nIf this is settled now, it will shorten the debate. If the gentleman\r\nwill move to amend now, I will withdraw my motion.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--I move to amend by inserting the word _present_ before\r\nthe word _territory_ in the first line of Section I., with such other\r\nverbal amendments as may make the sense conform, and to adopt that\r\namendment now. This covers the whole ground. I wish to discuss these\r\namendments, but am physically unable to speak to-day, and would\r\nprefer to have the discussion deferred.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON then moved an adjournment, which was carried on a\r\ndivision, and the Convention adjourned at two o'clock and fifty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEVENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 18th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was opened with prayer by Rev. P.D. GURLEY.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday was read and approved.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the rules of this Convention be so far\r\n     modified as to require the Secretary to employ a competent\r\n     stenographer, who shall write down and preserve accurate\r\n     notes of the debates and other proceedings of this body,\r\n     which notes shall not be communicated to any person, nor\r\n     shall copies thereof be taken, nor shall the same be made\r\n     public until after the final adjournment of this Convention,\r\n     except in pursuance of a vote authorizing their publication.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I have no desire to occupy time in debating this\r\nresolution, much less to waste it in a fruitless attempt to oppose\r\nwhat seems to be the settled purpose of a majority of this Convention.\r\nBut if this body will consider the purpose which the resolution seeks\r\nto attain, it may, perhaps, be found less objectionable than other\r\nsimilar ones which have been defeated. The objection heretofore made\r\nis, that a publication of what transpires here would lead to an\r\nexcited criticism in the country, which would be unfavorable to the\r\ncalmness and ultimate success which should attend our deliberations.\r\nWhile I entertain no such apprehensions, permit me to observe that\r\nthis resolution contemplates no present publication of our debates,\r\nbut a publication at such a time, and in such a manner, as will be\r\nunobjectionable. That time may not come till after our adjournment. I\r\nam free to say, that when we are dealing with the important issues now\r\nbefore us, I prefer to have our action, our words, our whole conduct,\r\nall that we do and say, open and public. We should fear no criticism\r\nwhen we are right; we ought to be held to account when we are wrong.\r\nBut if gentlemen will not consent to this, at least let the daily\r\nrecord of each of us be made up now: let it be full and perfect. When\r\na question comes up hereafter which concerns the sentiments or the\r\naction of a member, let its decision depend upon no uncertain\r\nrecollection, a recollection which must fade and grow dim with each\r\none of us, as the time of this Convention recedes into the past. Such\r\na record can injure no one; it may be of infinite service hereafter. I\r\ncould not justify myself to my conscience, or to those who have a\r\nright to hold me responsible for my acts here, if I failed to do all\r\nthat lays in my power to have the true history of this Convention laid\r\nbefore the country. A naked journal amounts to nothing. It is a\r\nskeleton. Our discussions alone will give it form and comeliness. I\r\nhave prepared this resolution upon consultation with many members,\r\nwhose ideas of what should be done here agree with mine. They concur\r\nwith me in the propriety of offering it. If it fails, the\r\nresponsibility of keeping our discussions from the people will not\r\nrest with us.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--I move to lay the resolution on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--Let the vote be taken by States.\r\n\r\nThe vote was so taken, and the following States voted in the\r\naffirmative: Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri, Virginia, and\r\nPennsylvania--11.\r\n\r\nThe following States voted in the negative: Maine, Vermont, New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and New York--8.\r\n\r\nSo the motion to lay on the table prevailed.\r\n\r\nWhen the State of Ohio was called, a member of her delegation stated\r\nthat it was equally divided.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I ask the unanimous consent of the Conference to introduce\r\na proposition in the form of an address to the people of the United\r\nStates. I do so after having consulted a considerable number of\r\nmembers; and having found that it meets their approval, I desire to\r\nread it, and will then move that it be laid on the table and printed.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--Is the gentleman's motion in order?\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I object to the reading.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--Certainly; I object also.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I will acquiesce with a single word. I certainly hoped no\r\ncurt objection would be made to the reading of _any_ proposition which\r\nany member might deem it his duty to offer. As gentlemen differ from\r\nme in this respect, I will hand the paper to the Chair. I hope at\r\nleast it may be permitted to lay on the table.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I hold it the gentleman's undoubted right to read the\r\npaper if he chooses.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--Very well.\r\n\r\nHe commenced reading when he was interrupted by\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope Mr. TUCK will withdraw this paper. If the\r\nConvention agrees to any result, I shall favor its submission to the\r\npeople with an address. I will pledge myself to suggest the\r\ngentleman's name as one of a committee to prepare the address at the\r\nproper time.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The gentleman from New Hampshire has the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK then completed the reading of the paper, as follows:\r\n\r\n     TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\n     This Convention of Conference, composed in part of\r\n     Commissioners appointed in accordance with the legislative\r\n     action of sundry States, and in part of Commissioners\r\n     appointed by the Governors of sundry other States, in\r\n     compliance with an invitation by the General Assembly of\r\n     Virginia, met in Washington on the 4th of February, 1861.\r\n     Although constituting a body unknown to the Constitution and\r\n     laws, yet being delegated for the purpose, and having\r\n     carefully considered the existing dangers and dissensions,\r\n     and having brought their proceedings to a close, publish\r\n     this address, and the accompanying resolutions, as the\r\n     result of their deliberations.\r\n\r\n     We recognize and deplore the divisions and distractions\r\n     which now afflict our country, interrupt its prosperity,\r\n     disturb its peace, and endanger the Union of the States; but\r\n     we repel the conclusion, that any alienations or dissensions\r\n     exist which are irreconcilable, which justify attempts at\r\n     revolution, or which the patriotism and fraternal sentiments\r\n     of the people, and the interests and honor of the whole\r\n     nation, will not overcome.\r\n\r\n     In a country embracing the central and most important\r\n     portion of a continent, among a people now numbering over\r\n     thirty millions, diversities of opinion inevitably exist;\r\n     and rivalries, intensified at times by local interests and\r\n     sectional attachments, must often occur; yet we do not doubt\r\n     that the theory of our Government is the best which is\r\n     possible for this nation, that the Union of the States is of\r\n     vital importance, and that the Constitution, which\r\n     expresses the combined wisdom of the illustrious founders of\r\n     the Government, is still the palladium of our liberties,\r\n     adequate to every emergency, and justly entitled to the\r\n     support of every good citizen.\r\n\r\n     It embraces, in its provisions and spirit, all the defence\r\n     and protection which any section of the country can\r\n     rightfully demand, or honorably concede.\r\n\r\n     Adopted with primary reference to the wants of five millions\r\n     of people, but with the wisest reference to future expansion\r\n     and development, it has carried us onward with a rapid\r\n     increase of numbers, an accumulation of wealth, and a degree\r\n     of happiness and general prosperity never attained by any\r\n     nation.\r\n\r\n     Whatever branch of industry, or whatever staple production,\r\n     shall become, in the possible changes of the future, the\r\n     leading interest of the country, thereby creating unforeseen\r\n     complications or new conflicts of opinion and interest, the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, properly understood and\r\n     fairly enforced, is equal to every exigency, a shield and\r\n     defence to all, in every time of need. If, however, by\r\n     reason of a change in circumstances, or for any cause, a\r\n     portion of the people believe they ought to have their\r\n     rights more exactly defined or more fully explained in the\r\n     Constitution, it is their duty, in accordance with its\r\n     provisions, to seek a remedy by way of amendment to that\r\n     instrument; and it is the duty of all the States to concur\r\n     in such amendments as may be found necessary to insure equal\r\n     and exact justice to all.\r\n\r\n     In order, therefore, to announce to the country the\r\n     sentiments of this Convention, respecting not only the\r\n     remedy which should be sought for existing discontents, but\r\n     also to communicate to the public what we believe to be the\r\n     patriotic sentiment of the country, we adopt the following\r\n     resolutions:\r\n\r\n     1st. _Resolved_, That this Convention recognize the\r\n     well-understood proposition that the Constitution of the\r\n     United States gives no power to Congress, or any branch of\r\n     the Federal Government, to interfere in any manner with\r\n     slavery in any of the States; and we are assured by abundant\r\n     testimony, that neither of the great political organizations\r\n     existing in the country contemplates a violation of the\r\n     spirit of the Constitution in this regard, or the procuring\r\n     of any amendment thereof, by which Congress, or any\r\n     department of the General Government, shall ever have\r\n     jurisdiction over slavery in any of the States.\r\n\r\n     2d. _Resolved_, That the Constitution was ordained and\r\n     established, as set forth in the preamble, by the people of\r\n     the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union,\r\n     establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for\r\n     the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure\r\n     the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity;\r\n     and when the people of any State are not in full enjoyment\r\n     of all the benefits intended to be secured to them by the\r\n     Constitution, or their rights under it are disregarded,\r\n     their tranquillity disturbed, their prosperity retarded, or\r\n     their liberty imperilled by the people of any State, full\r\n     and adequate redress can and ought to be provided for such\r\n     grievances.\r\n\r\n     3d. _Resolved_, That this Convention recommend to the\r\n     Legislatures of the States of the Union to follow the\r\n     example of the Legislatures of the States of Kentucky and of\r\n     Illinois, in applying to Congress to call a Convention for\r\n     the proposing of amendments to the Constitution of the\r\n     United States, pursuant to the fifth article thereof.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I object to printing this paper. If that course is\r\ntaken, every member may offer his disquisitions on the Constitution,\r\nand they will be printed at our expense.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--Unanimous consent was given that it be read, laid on the\r\ntable, and printed.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--There were three motions involved in one. Now the\r\nquestion is upon laying the paper on the table and printing it.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--I call for a division of the question.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question will be on the motion to lay it on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--Are we not entitled to have the question taken on the\r\nmotion to print? I supposed all these questions would be taken in a\r\nspirit of conciliation. But if not, I will withdraw the motion to lay\r\non the table, and move that the paper be printed.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--I came here in a spirit of conciliation,\r\nand I shall act in that spirit. Let us all do so. I disagree entirely\r\nwith Mr. TUCK and his proposition, but I am in favor of receiving\r\nevery proposition that is offered, of printing them all, and at the\r\nproper time of considering them all. I trust that unanimous consent\r\nwill be given to printing this paper.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT then put the motion upon printing the address, and it\r\nwas carried upon a division.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE offered the following resolution, which was adopted\r\nunanimously:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That if the President shall choose to speak on\r\n     any question, he may, for the occasion, call any member to\r\n     preside.\r\n\r\nMr. MEREDITH:--I wish to offer a proposition, and hope for the present\r\nit may lie on the table, and be considered hereafter. I do not desire\r\nto move it as an amendment to the report of the committee, but think\r\nit better to present it as a direct and independent proposition. I\r\npresent it now only for the purpose of having it before the\r\nConvention. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE.--That Congress shall divide all the territory of\r\n     the United States into convenient portions, each containing\r\n     not less than sixty thousand square miles, and shall\r\n     establish in each a territorial government; the several\r\n     territorial legislatures, whether heretofore constituted, or\r\n     hereafter to be constituted, shall have all the legislative\r\n     powers now vested in the respective States of this Union;\r\n     and whenever any territory having a population sufficient,\r\n     according to the ratio existing at the time, to entitle it\r\n     to one member of Congress, shall form a republican\r\n     constitution, and apply to Congress for admission as a\r\n     State, Congress shall admit the same as a State accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of Mr. MEREDITH was laid on the table without\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--There appears to be a misunderstanding between the\r\nSecretary and myself upon the question of printing the Journal. To\r\navoid question, I move that the Journal be printed up to and including\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I move to amend by adding \"and from day to day during\r\nthe session.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment and the motion were adopted without objection.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER, of New Jersey, took the chair.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Convention will now proceed to the order of the\r\nday--the consideration of the report of the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. REID, of North Carolina:--I wish to move an amendment to the\r\namendment offered by Mr. JOHNSON. It is to add to his the words \"and\r\nfuture.\" If adopted, the language will be \"present and future\r\nterritory.\"\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--This will render a division of the question necessary. The\r\ngentleman had better withdraw his amendment for the time.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I am instructed by the Legislature of North Carolina to\r\noffer it, and I think best to do so in this regular manner.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--I think the motion of Mr. REID is out of order. I\r\nsuggest that if adopted, with Mr. JOHNSON'S amendment, the sense of\r\nthe proposition as it now stands will not be changed.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I rise merely to make a suggestion to my colleague. This\r\nmotion must be made at some time, by some one, so that we may have a\r\nregular vote upon it. Now, as it is not certain how the report of the\r\nmajority of the committee is to be construed, I propose at a suitable\r\ntime to move an amendment which will make the proposition applicable\r\nto territory hereafter acquired. If this will suit my colleague, I\r\nhope he will withdraw his motion.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I came here not to deceive the North or the South. I intend\r\nto be plain and unambiguous. Why should we send forth a proposition\r\nthat is uncertain, vague, and, as gentlemen admit, open to different\r\nconstructions? If we are to pour oil upon the troubled waters, let us\r\ndo so to some purpose; above all, let us be definite, plain, and\r\ncertain. I cannot consent to withdraw my motion. I must insist upon\r\nits consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I had hoped the question on Mr. JOHNSON'S amendments would\r\nhave been taken on Saturday. It is an important one, and one which\r\nmust be met. I would suggest that it would be best to let the question\r\nbe taken on Mr. JOHNSON'S amendments now. The subject presents itself\r\nto my mind in this way: The proposition of the majority, as it now\r\nstands, is uncertain. The friends of the proposition ought to be\r\nallowed to perfect it, to make it satisfactory to themselves. If there\r\nis a doubt about it, let us make it clear that it applies only to the\r\npresent territory. Then we can have a clear and decisive vote upon it.\r\nThe substance of the proposition is what I wish to arrive at, and it\r\nwill be more in order if the vote is not taken till we know what that\r\nsubstance is. I shall not object to its application to future\r\nterritory. I hope the gentleman from North Carolina will withdraw his\r\namendment, and let the question be taken on that of Mr. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--One word only. I fear we are being placed in an awkward\r\nposition. I am desirous to have the language of the proposition clear\r\nand not delusive. The amendment of Mr. JOHNSON embarrasses me; I\r\nhardly know how to vote upon it. If I vote for Mr. JOHNSON'S motion, I\r\nshall have the semblance of favoring the limitation of the proposition\r\nto present territory. Mr. RUFFIN and myself both want the same thing,\r\nbut on Mr. JOHNSON'S motion he will vote one way and I the other.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--Will the gentleman allow me to explain? I voted against\r\nthe proposition in committee because, as it now stands, it applies\r\nonly to existing territory. I wish to carry this proposition, but not\r\nby the vote of the South alone. I want Northern votes, and assurances\r\nthat the people of the North will vote for the proposition and adopt\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I shall feel disposed to vote against Mr. JOHNSON'S\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe question was here stated by the President as follows:\r\n\r\nThe vote will be taken upon the motion of Mr. REID to amend the\r\namendment offered by Mr. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--It strikes me that the question is this: My proposition is\r\nto add the words \"and future,\" but Mr. JOHNSON'S amendment is to add\r\nthe word \"present.\" Can this be treated as an amendment to his motion?\r\nI must say that my duty to my country and State will prevent my voting\r\nfor the proposition as he proposes to limit it.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I think the committee ought to be permitted to amend and\r\ncomplete their report. Let us, by general consent, agree to have the\r\nword \"present\" inserted.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I object to that all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I move that the report be recommitted for amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--Shall we adjourn over simply for this? That will use up\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope it will not be recommitted. We can settle the\r\nquestion here in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The vote will now be taken.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I call for the individual names of members voting.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The call is not in order.\r\n\r\nThe question was then taken on the amendment of Mr. REID, and resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES--New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\n     North Carolina, Missouri, and Virginia--8.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, Rhode Island, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n     Pennsylvania, New York, and Iowa--12.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment failed.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question now recurs on the motion of the gentleman\r\nfrom Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--I trust that I shall not trespass upon the time of the\r\nConference, but the subject now before it is one of great importance,\r\nand it involves the consideration of many important questions. The\r\namendment which I offer is for the purpose of making the proposition\r\nof the committee clear and plain. I was aware that a construction\r\nmight be placed upon it different from that which the committee\r\nintended; and it is due to the frankness which is manifested here,\r\nthat the purposes of the committee should be made plain. There ought\r\nto be no ambiguity in a constitutional provision. Some of the most\r\nimportant constitutional questions decided by the Supreme Court have\r\nbeen questions of construction. Lawyers would differ about the\r\nconstruction to be given the committee's proposition. I think the\r\nSupreme Court has placed a construction upon the terms used here,\r\nwhich would be conclusive. A similar question arose in the Dred Scott\r\ncase. There the question was upon that article in the Constitution\r\nwhich confers on Congress the power \"to dispose of and to make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting the _territories_ or other\r\nproperty belonging to the United States.\" The Court in that case\r\ndecided that the provision had no bearing on the controversy in that\r\ncase, because the power given by that provision, whatever it might be,\r\nwas confined, and was intended to be confined, to the territory which,\r\nupon the adoption of the Constitution, belonged to or was claimed by\r\nthe United States, and was within their boundaries, as settled by the\r\ntreaty with Great Britain. With this clause in the Constitution,\r\ntherefore, it could have no influence upon the territory afterward\r\nacquired from a foreign government. I think this decision conclusive,\r\nand that the proposition, if incorporated into the Constitution, would\r\nrefer only to the territory now owned by the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was the wish of the representatives of some States in the committee\r\nthat the word \"future\" should be inserted in the report. I was opposed\r\nto it: it was so odious to me to put words into the Constitution, or\r\nto propose to do so, which should go forth to the world as an\r\nindication that this Government proposes to acquire new territory in\r\nany way. I have said that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case\r\ndecided that the words \"the territories\" in the Constitution only\r\napplied to the then existing territory. I think they decided wrong in\r\nthis respect, though I agree to the correctness of the decision in\r\nthat case in the main; but such as it is, the decision is binding\r\nupon this Conference and the people.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON here read a portion of the opinion of Judge TANEY\r\ndelivered in the Dred Scott case, and continued:\r\n\r\nYou perceive that Judge TANEY turns the question upon the construction\r\nof the word \"the.\" Had the word \"any\" been used in its place, he must\r\nhave held that the provision applied to future, as well as the then\r\nexisting territory.\r\n\r\nKnowing that it was the purpose of the majority of the committee to\r\nexclude future territory from the operation of this proposition, and\r\nthat it was due to the committee and the Convention that their\r\npurposes should be carried out, I offer my amendment as applicable to\r\nthe sixth line of the proposition as well as the first.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the merits of this report, in its application to the\r\nexisting condition of the country, I have to say a word to my Southern\r\nfriends. You have sought to extend this provision to territory which\r\nshall be hereafter acquired. You have had a decisive vote and have\r\nbeen beaten in this Conference. The fight has been a fair one; the\r\nquestion has been thoroughly understood. We ought to acquiesce in the\r\ndecision of the majority. We cannot change this decision if we would;\r\nand if we could change it, the proposition amended as you would prefer\r\nto have it, would never pass Congress. The repeated action of that\r\nbody, during its present session, shows this conclusively. Accepting\r\nthis decision then, as definitive, can we not settle the question with\r\nreference to existing territory? Shall we settle it? Settle it\r\nfairly--recognizing and acknowledging the rights of all, and remain\r\nbrethren forever with the Free States! From my very heart, I say yes.\r\n(Applause.) The proposition as it now stands covers all the territory\r\nwe have. The whole ground, the whole trouble, which has brought this\r\ncountry into its present lamentable condition--has arisen over this\r\nquestion. I believe if it had been disposed of or settled in some way\r\nbefore, many States would have been kept in the Union that have now\r\ngone out. And why should we not settle it?\r\n\r\nWe have now a territory extensive enough to sustain two hundred\r\nmillions of people--embracing almost every climate, fruitful in almost\r\nevery species of production--rich in all the elements of national\r\nwealth, and governed by a Constitution that has raised us to an\r\nelevation of grandeur that the world has never before witnessed. That\r\nwe should separate to the destruction of such a Government, on account\r\nof territory we have not got, and territory that we do not want, is\r\nnot, I believe, the patriotic sense of the South.\r\n\r\nBut this proposition does not stand by itself alone. It is connected,\r\nand must be construed, with the provision relating to the acquisition\r\nof future territory. The second section of the committee's proposition\r\nprovides that territory shall not be acquired by the United States,\r\nunless by treaty, nor, with unimportant exceptions, unless such treaty\r\nshall be ratified by four-fifths of all the members of the Senate. Is\r\nnot that guaranty enough for us? Should we not act unreasonably if we\r\nrequired further guaranty in this respect? For myself, I should have\r\npreferred that the consent of two-thirds of the Senate only should be\r\nrequired, and that that two-thirds should comprise a majority both\r\nfrom the free and slave States.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--At the proper time I shall move such an amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--If such an amendment is proposed I shall vote for it. I\r\nknow there will be objections raised to it, but they will be far\r\noutweighed by the advantages it will give to the South.\r\n\r\nBut the objection of Mr. BALDWIN is opposed here, and it is one which\r\nmust be answered. He says this is the wrong way to propose amendments\r\nto the Constitution--that our action is inconsistent with that\r\ninstrument. He does not claim that it is prohibited by the letter, but\r\nby the spirit of the Constitution. Where does he get the spirit but\r\nfrom the letter? There are two methods of proposing amendments to the\r\nConstitution provided by that instrument. Let us see what they are.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON here read the article of the Constitution providing for\r\namendments, and continued:\r\n\r\nOne is where two-thirds of Congress deem it advisable to propose\r\namendments; the other is where the States themselves propose them. My\r\nlearned brother would have us believe that the members of Congress,\r\nacting under their official oaths, must each be satisfied that each\r\namendment proposed is proper to be incorporated in the instrument,\r\nbefore they should propose them; and he maintains that there is a\r\ndifference, in fact, in the two methods prescribed. What right has\r\nthis body, if there is any force in this objection, to submit _his_\r\nproposition to the States? If what we propose is revolutionary, then\r\nwhat he proposes is revolutionary. I reply to him, with all respect\r\nfor his legal ability, and with all the humility which becomes me, and\r\ninsist that he is wrong. He refers to the opinion of Judge COLLAMER. I\r\nhold Judge COLLAMER in much respect, and his opinion in great honor\r\nhere, but his statements are at war with the objections made by the\r\ngentleman from Connecticut. Judge COLLAMER maintains that it is the\r\nduty of Congress _to propose_ amendments, not to _recommend_ them. It\r\nwould be entirely proper, according to his opinion, for Congress to\r\npropose amendments which they would not adopt themselves. I go\r\nsomewhat farther, and insist that it is the duty of Congress to\r\npropose amendments whenever desired by any State or any considerable\r\nsection of the Union. If we have no right to suggest a line of action\r\nto Congress, no right to petition Congress, no right to ask Congress\r\nto propose amendments, as the gentleman insists, we had better go\r\nhome, or rather, I should say, we should never have come here.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty States represented in this Conference. I have no\r\ndoubt other States would have been here, but for the shortness of the\r\ntime. But how and why are we here? We have come here on the invitation\r\nof Virginia; her resolutions are our constitution. We have come here\r\nat her instance. For what purpose did she ask us to come here? under\r\nwhat circumstances did she pass these resolutions? Virginia saw that\r\nthe country was going to ruin--that one State had already seceded, and\r\nseveral others were about to follow. She saw there were circumstances\r\naffecting the condition of the South which aroused her to frenzy--not\r\nmadness, but the frenzy which falls on every patriotic mind when it\r\nwitnesses a country going to destruction. She saw the country was\r\ngoing to ruin with rapid steps, and that its ruin must be accomplished\r\nunless her friends in the free States would come forward, and consent\r\nto put into the Constitution additional guarantees which would satisfy\r\nthe people of the slave States that their rights were secure. See what\r\nshe did--what she said. She expresses it as her deliberate opinion,\r\n\"that unless the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of\r\nthis Confederacy shall be satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent\r\ndissolution of the Union is inevitable; and the General Assembly,\r\nrepresenting the wishes of the people of the Commonwealth, is desirous\r\nof employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a calamity, and\r\ndetermined to make a final effort to restore the Union and the\r\nConstitution, in the spirit in which they were established by the\r\nfathers of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore she invites all States, whether slaveholding or\r\nnon-slaveholding, who were willing to unite with her in an earnest\r\neffort to adjust the unhappy controversies in the spirit of the\r\nConstitution, to come together to secure that adjustment. She asks us\r\nto agree to some suitable adjustment. She does not leave us to suggest\r\nwhat that adjustment shall be. She tells us herself. She requests us\r\nto adopt it, and to submit it to Congress. She does not ask that\r\nCongress should call a convention, for Congress could not. Try, if we\r\ncan, says Virginia, to come to some settlement of these unhappy\r\ncontroversies, and send that settlement to Congress, that Congress may\r\nsubmit it to the country.\r\n\r\nVirginia invited you here. She told you just what she wanted. She says\r\nif you cannot consent to that, then let her commissioners come home\r\nand report the result. If this cannot be done, if the mode of\r\nadjustment indicated by her cannot be substantially carried out, then\r\nour whole authority is at an end.\r\n\r\nThis matter of amending the Constitution is not as intricate and\r\ndifficult a work as gentlemen imagine. Are there not twelve amendments\r\nto the Constitution already? Were they submitted to the people by each\r\nmember of Congress acting under his official oath? Or were they\r\nsubmitted in the very way the gentleman would avoid? Were they not\r\nbrought into the Constitution by outside pressure?\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has been amended. I wish to mark how it was done, and\r\nthen note why it was done.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when fears were entertained that wrongs might be done\r\nto different sections of the Union under the Constitution as it then\r\nstood. Congress listened to those fears, and did not hesitate to\r\npropose amendments suggested from outside its own body--to submit them\r\nto the people for adoption. It was necessary, in the judgment of\r\nCongress, to do this, in order to restore confidence. It was done, and\r\nconfidence was restored. Is not that precisely our case now? Is not\r\nconfidence lost in the North and in the South?--not exactly lost,\r\nperhaps, but shaken. The credit of the Government is gone. Even our\r\nnaval commanders are unable to negotiate Government bills abroad--are\r\nreduced to the degrading alternative of asking the endorsement of\r\nforeign States, in order to such negotiation. Some brilliant\r\nindividuals have suggested that we have already become so poor that\r\nour widows and wives must bring out their stockings.\r\n\r\nOur last loan was negotiated at twelve per cent. discount. The present\r\nloan is not to be taken at any rate, unless the Government descends to\r\nthe humiliating alternative of securing State endorsements. Our credit\r\nis going lower and lower every day, and it will soon come to the point\r\nwhere our bonds will be worth no more than Continental money was.\r\n\r\nSuppose we do nothing here. Are gentlemen blind to the consequences?\r\nGentlemen, honest and patriotic as I know you are, have you no love\r\nfor this Union?--have you no care for the preservation of this\r\nGovernment? God forbid that I should say you have none! I know you too\r\nwell. My relations have been too intimate with you, and have existed\r\ntoo long, for me to suppose it. You do love the Union. I speak for the\r\nSouth and to the South. I know that we can still labor to keep this\r\nGovernment together. If we follow the plain dictates of our judgment,\r\nany other course would be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Convention is even now in session, and what a convention\r\nit is! Disguise as we may, deceive ourselves as we will, it is a\r\nconvention which proposes to consider the question of withdrawing the\r\nState from the Union. Kentucky and Missouri, if we do nothing, will\r\nsoon follow. If there ever was a time in the history of the Government\r\nfor conciliation, for patriotic concession, that time is now. The time\r\nhas come when parties must be forgotten. Let not the word party be\r\nmentioned here. It is not worthy of us. Representatives of the States,\r\nyou are above party--high above. The cords that bind you together are\r\na hundred times as strong as those which ever bound any party. Unless\r\nwe do something, and something very quickly, before the incoming\r\nPresident is inaugurated, in all human probability he will have only\r\nthe States north of Mason and Dixon to govern--that is, if he is to\r\ngovern them in peace.\r\n\r\nI think there is no right of secession; such is my individual opinion.\r\nBut there is a right higher than all these--the right of\r\nself-defence, the right of revolution. It is recognized by the\r\nConstitution itself. The Constitution was adopted by nine of the\r\nStates only. What right had those nine States to separate from the\r\nother four?\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The right of secession.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--I won't dispute about terms. In all such discussions,\r\nHeaven save me from a Virginia politician!\r\n\r\nThe opinions of Mr. MADISON upon the Constitution are certainly\r\nentitled to value. He had more to do with making it than any other\r\nstatesman of the time. I desire to read an opinion of his, which will\r\nbe found in number forty-two of the Federalist:\r\n\r\n     \"Two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves\r\n     on this occasion:--1. On what principle the Confederation,\r\n     which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the\r\n     States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of\r\n     the parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between\r\n     the nine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the\r\n     remaining few who do not become parties to it?\r\n\r\n     \"The first question is answered at once by recurring to the\r\n     absolute necessity of the case, to the great principle of\r\n     self-preservation, to the transcendent law of nature and of\r\n     nature's God, which declares that the safety and happiness\r\n     of society are the objects at which all political\r\n     institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be\r\n     sacrificed.\"\r\n\r\nNow, apply these principles to the present condition of the country.\r\nThe cases are exactly parallel. Mr. MADISON says in substance, that if\r\none section of the Union refuses to recognize and protect the rights\r\nof another--in other words, if the free States now refuse to guarantee\r\nthe rights of the South, that there is a right of self-preservation, a\r\nlaw of nature and nature's God, which is above all Constitutions. I am\r\nnot here to inquire whether the South has a right to go out if these\r\nguarantees are not given. That is a question which I will not argue.\r\nSome of the States have already gone. I hold that to be a fact\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nNow, I put it to my friends of the North: Do you want us to go out?\r\nYou are a great people, a great country--a powerful people, a rich\r\ncountry. No threat or intimidation shall ever come from me to such a\r\npeople. I ask you in all sadness whether, in the light of all our\r\nglory, of all our happiness and prosperity, whether you will, by\r\nwithholding a thing that it will not harm you to grant, suffer us,\r\ncompel us to depart? Let me read what was said by the same great man\r\nof Virginia, in anticipation of the existence of the present state of\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n     \"I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations,\r\n     in full confidence that the good sense which has so often\r\n     marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and\r\n     effect; and that you will never suffer difficulties, however\r\n     formidable in appearance, or however fashionable the error\r\n     on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy\r\n     and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion\r\n     would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice, which\r\n     tells you that the people of America, knit together as they\r\n     are by so many cords of affection, can no longer live\r\n     together as members of the same family; can no longer\r\n     continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness; can\r\n     no longer be fellow-citizens of one great, respectable, and\r\n     flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which\r\n     petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended\r\n     for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that\r\n     it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest\r\n     projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to\r\n     accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against this\r\n     unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison\r\n     which it conveys. The kindred blood which flows in the veins\r\n     of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed\r\n     in defence of their sacred rights, consecrate their Union,\r\n     and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens,\r\n     rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be shunned, believe\r\n     me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild of all\r\n     projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rending\r\n     us in pieces, in order to preserve our liberties, and\r\n     promote our happiness.\"\r\n\r\nGrant us then, gentlemen of the North, what we are willing to stand\r\nupon--what we will try to stand upon, and what we believe we can. At\r\nleast, this will save the rest of the States to yourselves and to us.\r\nThe States that are now in the Union will continue there.\r\n\r\nWhat is it we ask you to do? It is to settle this question as to our\r\npresent territory. To settle it--how? By dividing it. And how by\r\ndividing it? By the line of 36° 30´. Apparently, you think we are\r\nasking the North to yield something. I tell you it is we who are\r\nyielding. By the decision of the Supreme Court we have the right to go\r\nNorth of this line with our slaves. Now, all we ask you to give us\r\nhere is the territory south of that line; and even as to that, we give\r\nyou the right to destroy slavery there whenever a State organized out\r\nof it chooses to do so. We are, in fact, yielding to you. We abandon\r\nour rights North. Will you not let us retain what is already ours,\r\nSouth?\r\n\r\nIs it quite certain that the territory south of the line will be slave\r\nterritory? Those who repealed the Missouri Compromise, believed that\r\nKansas would be a slave State. It did not turn out so. All we ask is,\r\nthat you should leave the territory south of the line where it has\r\nbeen left by the decision of the Supreme Court. We freely yield you\r\nall the rest.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to discuss all the amendments proposed. I confine\r\nmyself to the single one which, if satisfactorily disposed of, will\r\nsettle all our troubles.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I ask, oppressed by a consciousness which almost\r\novermasters me--which renders me unfit to do any thing but feel--will\r\nyou not settle this question here? I feel, and I cannot escape the\r\nfeeling, that on your decision hangs the question, whether we shall be\r\npreserved an united people, or be broken to atoms. The States now\r\nremaining in the Union may possibly get on for a few years with\r\nsomething like prosperity; but if this question is not settled in some\r\nway, man must change his nature or _war_ in the end will come. War!\r\nWhat a word to be used here! War between whom? There is not a family\r\nat the South which has not its associations with the North--not a\r\nNorthern family which has not its Southern ties! War in the midst of\r\nsuch a people! God grant that the future, that the events which must\r\ninevitably follow dissension here, may at least spare this agony to\r\nourselves, our families, and our posterity.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--It is very clear to me that I ought not to make a\r\nprolonged address upon a question which I favor. The only question now\r\nbefore us is: Shall this amendment be made plain? We should deal\r\nhonestly among ourselves; there should be no cheat--no uncertainty--no\r\ndelusion here. Our language should be so clear that it will breed no\r\nnew nests of trouble.\r\n\r\nBut the address of the gentleman from Maryland requires a brief notice\r\nfrom me. I listened with sadness to many parts of it. I bemoan that\r\ntones so patriotic could not rise to the level of the high ground of\r\nequality and right upon which we all ought to stand.\r\n\r\nI appeal not to forbearance--I ask not for pity. I feel proud to\r\nrepresent the grand old commonwealth of Virginia here, and prouder\r\nstill that I only come here to demand right and justice in her behalf.\r\nAye! and it is more complimentary to you to have it so. I ask for such\r\nguarantees only as Virginia needs, and as she has the right to demand.\r\nIt is far more complimentary to you to appeal to your sense of\r\njustice, to your sense of right, than to your forbearance or pity.\r\n\r\nVirginia comes forward in a great national crisis. When support after\r\nsupport of this glorious temple of our Government has been torn away,\r\nshe comes--proud of her memories of the past--happy in the part she\r\nhad in the construction of this great system--she comes to present to\r\nyou, calmly and plainly, the question, whether new and additional\r\nguarantees are not needed for her rights; and she tells you what those\r\nguarantees ought to be.\r\n\r\nNor does she stand alone. She is supported by all her border sisters.\r\nThe propositions she makes are familiar to the country. They were made\r\nby a patriot of the olden time, a time near to that of the foundation\r\nof our Government. They were such as he thought suited to the\r\nexigencies of his time. They have since then received a larger meed of\r\napproval, north and south, than any other plan of arrangement.\r\n\r\nMy State offers these resolutions of her Legislature as a basis for\r\nour action here, with certain modifications acceptable to her people.\r\nOne of these modifications has since been accepted by the mover of\r\nthese resolutions himself. Most important among them is the provision\r\nas to future territory. The gentleman seems to think that Virginia\r\nwould not insist on this provision as applicable to territory we may\r\nnever have. It behooves not me to answer such a momentous question. I\r\nam only the mouthpiece of Virginia. She insists on the provision for\r\nfuture territory. She and her sister States plant themselves upon it.\r\nWhat right have I to strike out a clause which she makes specific?\r\nWhat right have I to esteem it of so little weight that it may be\r\nthrown aside and disregarded? I do not propose to give my reasons,\r\nthough they would not be troublesome to give. It was an element in the\r\nMissouri Compromise that it should apply to future as well as to\r\nexisting territory.\r\n\r\nDoes not the gentleman assert that under the laws as they now stand,\r\nwe have the right to go north of the compromise line with our slaves?\r\nWhat, then, is our position? Under the decision of the Supreme Court\r\nwe are entitled to participate in _all_ the territory of the United\r\nStates. We are offering to give up the great part and the best part of\r\nit, and in payment we are to take the naked chance of getting a little\r\npiece of the worthless territory south of the proposed line! Such an\r\nidea was never entertained by those who made the Compromise. The idea\r\nwhich governed their action was, beyond all doubt, not that present\r\nterritory alone should be thus divided, but that the question should\r\nbe removed from doubt and difficulty for all time, and to give us at\r\nthe South a chance whatever change might come.\r\n\r\nShall we be rewarded for all we give up, and find full compensation in\r\na clause which itself prevents the acquisition of future territory?\r\nThe statement is in itself a sufficient answer to the question.\r\n\r\nBut there was another element in the propositions of the Legislature\r\nof Virginia. That, was security against the principles of the North,\r\nand her great and now dominant party; it was intended to put an end to\r\nthe discussions that have convulsed the country and jeopardized our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of our fathers to settle these questions. They\r\ndetermined to make a final and decisive line of demarkation, and to\r\nlet that be conclusive. But this young people could not be restrained,\r\nand when new territory was acquired the same question arose again. It\r\nnow comes up once more. Virginia early saw the seeds of trouble in it,\r\nbecause she saw that the tide of emigration would continue to press\r\ntoward the fertile lands of the South. She saw and she acted. In\r\nconsequence of her action we are here. Would it not be wise and well\r\nas statesmen and as patriots, that you should do what you can for\r\nadjustment? do what you can to bring back your sisters of the South\r\nwho have departed? It is the part of wisdom to settle. Virginia was\r\nwise to ask it.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing. A great and mighty party has arisen at the\r\nNorth that is determined to exclude the institution of slavery, not\r\nonly from all future, but from all _present_ territory. We know that\r\nin all ways this party has declared that it would not consent to let\r\nslavery go where it does not now exist. More heated zealots, also\r\nanimated and sustained by this same party, have determined that this\r\nnatural and patriarchal institution of the South should be surrounded\r\nby a cordon of free States, and in the end be extinguished altogether.\r\n\r\nIs it not wise in Virginia, that she should see that this project of\r\nsurrounding the South with free States should be guarded against--most\r\neffectually guarded against now and in time to come, and so preserve\r\nher dignity and power?\r\n\r\nThis amendment adopted, and the proposition to Virginia will be a\r\nfarce. Gentlemen, we hold that as the soul is to man, so is honor to a\r\nnation. Honor is the soul of nations. Without it, no nation can have a\r\nplace in history or among the nations. We of Virginia must have in\r\nthis Confederation the position of an equal. Equal in dignity--equal\r\nin right. In the Congress of the States of this Union, we insist on\r\nthis as our right. We must have the same protection as the States of\r\nthe North. Otherwise we are a dishonored people. We might live for a\r\ntime otherwise, but we should be unworthy a place among the nations.\r\nWe hold _property_, yes, _our property in slaves_, as rightful and as\r\nhonorable as any property to be found in the broad expanse between\r\nocean and ocean.\r\n\r\nWe feel that in the existence, the perpetuity, the protection of the\r\nAfrican race, we have a mission to perform, and not a mission only,\r\nbut a right and a duty.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject I have a word to say in all seriousness. Think not,\r\ngentlemen of the North, that we propose to deceive or mislead you. We\r\nof the South are earnest in what we say. This is a question which we\r\nanswer to ourselves. We hold that these colored barbarians have been\r\nwithdrawn from a country of native barbarism, and under the benignant\r\ninfluence of a Christian rule, of a Christian civilization, have been\r\nelevated, yes, _elevated_ to a standing and position which they could\r\nnever have otherwise secured. In respect to the colored race we\r\nchallenge comparison with San Domingo, with the freed regions of\r\nJamaica, with those who have been transferred to the coast of Africa.\r\nAsk the travellers who have visited those distant shores to contrast\r\nthe condition of the colored people there with that of those on our\r\nSouthern plantations, and they will give you but one answer--they will\r\nsay, we have redeemed and kept well our high and our holy trust.\r\n\r\nBut this is a matter with our own consciences, not with yours. We\r\nappeal to you to leave it where it is, to leave the colored people\r\nwhere they are. Why should you undertake to interfere with the policy\r\nof a neighboring State concerning a people about which you know\r\nnothing? We feel, we know that we have done that race no wrong. Deep\r\ninto the Southern heart has this feeling penetrated. For scores of\r\nyears we have been laboring earnestly in our mission. In all this time\r\nwe have contributed far more to the greatness of the North than to our\r\nown. Yet all this time we have been assailed, attacked, vilified and\r\ndefamed, by the people of the North, from the cradle to the grave, and\r\nyou have educated your children to believe us monsters of brutality,\r\nlust and iniquity.\r\n\r\nI tell you, that from the time the abolition societies aroused the\r\nlatent anti-slavery spirit of the North until now, nothing but evil\r\nhas come of the excitement and discussion. It has spread a horrid\r\ninfluence far and wide; it has for years distilled, and is now\r\ndistilling its poison and venom all over the land.\r\n\r\nIt was under English, yes, British, Anglo-Saxon instigation that it\r\nfirst commenced. By this instigation it has been fed, been given life,\r\ncontinuity and power. Think you the English authors of this\r\ninstigation had any purpose but to disrupt this Republic? They\r\nprofessed to regard slavery as an evil and a sin. The fruits of their\r\naction were first manifested in religious societies--first in the\r\nlargest churches in New England, in the Presbyterian or Congregational\r\nchurches, next the Methodist, then the Baptist, and finally, the venom\r\nspread so widely, its influence separated other churches. What has the\r\nmoral influence of this power done? It has made the abstraction of our\r\nslaves a virtue. Societies have been formed for that very purpose,\r\ninciting their members and others, by the vilest motives, to steal our\r\nslaves, to destroy our property.\r\n\r\nNor have they been sufficiently modest to cloak their designs under\r\nthe veil of secrecy. These people advocated their pernicious doctrines\r\nopenly in your leading cities, even within the consecrated walls of\r\nFanueil Hall.\r\n\r\nOpenly among your people, in the very light of day, these efforts were\r\ncarried on for the destruction of your sister States. There has not\r\nbeen an effort of the law nor an exertion of public opinion to put\r\nthem down.\r\n\r\nThese efforts culminated in the actual invasion of my own old honored\r\nState, and your people thought they were doing GOD service in signing\r\na petition to our authorities for mercy to John Brown and his ruffian\r\ninvaders of our soil. And when these men met the just reward of their\r\ncrime, there was, throughout the North, in your meetings and your\r\npublic prints, expressions of sympathy for these robbers and\r\nmurderers. They were looked upon as the victims of oppression, as\r\nmartyrs to a holy and righteous cause. Gentlemen, consider these\r\nthings, and tell me, is there not to-day reason for suspicion; on the\r\npart of the South for grave apprehension?\r\n\r\nBut the half is yet to be told; I have looked only at the moral aspect\r\nof the question. Dangerous enough hitherto, it becomes far more\r\ndangerous when it culminates on the arena of politics, and asks, with\r\nthe powerful aid of a majority, the interference and the aid of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became the party of one idea it began to draw to it,\r\nfirst the support of one, then another political party. It went on\r\nsecuring the assistance of one after another until it demoralized,\r\nuntil it brought each to ruin. It destroyed the grand old Whig party.\r\nFanatic enough before, when it had brought that party to its grave, it\r\nthrust upon the arena of politics this question of slavery in the\r\nterritories. Then for the first time it raised the cry of \"Free Soil,\"\r\nand brought to its support the hearts of a majority of the people of\r\nthe northern States.\r\n\r\nThe people of the North and Northwest have long been noted for their\r\nacquisitive disposition, especially for the acquisition of lands. This\r\nhas been manifested in every form. Carried into effect it has made\r\nthem powerful, until, not long since, they thought they might get\r\nentire dominion at no distant day. Then arose in their hearts a desire\r\ngreater than the greed of land--the greed of office and power. They\r\nthen saw that perhaps the North alone might control the national\r\ngovernment, and with it the South. Then, too, the great class of\r\nprotected interests at the North--always greater at the North than at\r\nthe South--joined with them. All these protected classes, whose\r\nadvantages had been diverted from other classes to which they\r\nbelonged, joined with landseekers to secure power. Influence after\r\ninfluence of this sort combined, until it produced your great\r\nRepublican party; in other words, your great Sectional party, which\r\nhas at length come to majority and power.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to dwell upon the principles of that party, or to\r\ndiscuss them; I simply assert that their principles involve all the\r\nsentiments of abolitionism. They may be summed up in this: you\r\ndetermine to oppose the admission of slave States in the future.\r\n\r\nYou say that the whole power of the country, the whole power of the\r\nadministration, shall be used in future for the final extinction of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThis, now, is the ruling idea of your great sectional party. It is\r\nsimply the rule of one portion of the country over another. There is\r\nno difference between attacking slavery in the States and keeping it\r\nout of the territories. It is only drawing a parallel around the\r\ncitadel at a more remote point.\r\n\r\nNow, see how the South is placed. The South has forborne as long as it\r\ncan, just as long as party organization existed, and as long as the\r\nSouth could keep it in existence. It was only when we saw that the\r\nwhole united Government was to be turned against us, that we began to\r\nthink of taking the subject into our own hands.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to expect now, when the power, direct and indirect, of\r\nthis great Government is to be used in the most effective manner\r\nagainst us? A power which claims that we shall not exercise the rights\r\nof States even, a power which seeks to coerce us, when we propose to\r\nprotect ourselves against this lowering and impending danger. You of\r\nthe North are descended from men who honored the scaffold for the very\r\nrights we now seek to exercise. So are we. You would deserve to be\r\nspurned by the maids and matrons among you, if you refused to protect\r\nyourselves against the dangers thus drawing around you. Can you expect\r\nless of us?\r\n\r\nDo you tell me that this is an artificial crisis? Would seven States\r\nhave abandoned all the grand interest they possessed in a glorious and\r\nhappy Confederacy like ours, but for more serious and vital interests,\r\nthe interests of safety, security, and honor? Think well of these\r\nthings, gentlemen!\r\n\r\nI have hastily endeavored to show you where I conceive we of the South\r\nstand. The feelings which I express are entertained likewise by the\r\nborder States, by all the citizens of the South, by every householder\r\nof my State in a greater or less degree.\r\n\r\nThe State to which I refer, Virginia, is now met in solemn convocation\r\nto consider whether she shall remain in the Union or go out of it; and\r\nwith the most earnest desire to secure to herself a longer connection\r\nwith the American Union, a Union of so much honor and pride, and with\r\nan equally earnest desire to bring back the wandering States of the\r\nSouth which have already left us, she, my own, my native State, comes\r\nhere to ask for these guarantees. In my deliberate judgment, the Union\r\nand the Constitution, as they now stand, are unsafe for the people of\r\nthe South, unsafe without other guarantees which will give them actual\r\npower instead of mere paper rights. Her stake in this controversy is\r\ntoo deep. In my judgment she has asked too little; I think fuller and\r\ngreater guarantees ought to be required, and that this Convention\r\nshould not stand upon ceremony, but in a free and liberal spirit of\r\nconcession should yield to us all that we ask. Be assured we shall ask\r\nnone but adequate guarantees.\r\n\r\nBut I am told that Virginia is content with the Crittenden\r\nResolutions--I say this because I am instructed to say so--that is, if\r\nwe are to treat these resolutions, not as the principles of the man\r\nwho offers them, but as the principles of the great party just come\r\ninto power.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, remember that we of the South are already stripped of\r\none-half our sister States; our system is dislocated; the Union is\r\ndisrupted.\r\n\r\nHow can you expect now to retain Virginia, to retain the border\r\nStates, when they stand in the face of such a great, such an immense\r\nparty? How can you expect Virginia to remain in the Union without\r\nthese added guarantees?\r\n\r\nI told you I would make no appeals to your pity. If we are not\r\nentitled to the guarantees we ask, according to the principles of\r\nsound philosophy, of right and justice, then we do not ask them at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUTWELL:--I have not been at all clear in my own mind as to when,\r\nand to what extent, Massachusetts should raise her voice in this\r\nConvention. She heard the voice of Virginia, expressed through her\r\nresolutions in this crisis of our country's history. Massachusetts\r\nhesitated, not because she was unwilling to respond to the call of\r\nVirginia, but because she thought her honor touched by the manner of\r\nthat call and the circumstances attending it. She had taken part in\r\nthe election of the sixth of November. She knew the result. It\r\naccorded well with her wishes. She knew that the Government whose\r\npolitical head for the next four years was then chosen, was based upon\r\na Constitution which she supposed still had an existence. She saw that\r\nState after State had left that Government--seceded is the word used;\r\nhad gone out from this great Confederacy, and were defying the\r\nConstitution and the Union.\r\n\r\nCharge after charge has been vaguely made against the North. It is\r\nattempted here to put the North on trial. I have listened with grave\r\nattention to the gentleman from Virginia to-day, but I have heard no\r\nspecification of these charges. Massachusetts hesitated I say; she has\r\nher own opinions of the Government and the Union. I know\r\nMassachusetts; I have been into every one of her more than three\r\nhundred towns. I have seen and conversed with her men and her women,\r\nand I know there is not a man within her borders who would not to-day\r\ngladly lay down his life for the preservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has made war upon slavery wherever she had the right to\r\ndo it; but much as she _abhors_ the institution, she would sacrifice\r\neverything rather than assail it where she has not the right to assail\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCan it be denied, gentlemen, that we have elected a President in a\r\nlegal and constitutional way? It cannot; and yet you tell us in tones\r\nthat cannot be misunderstood, that as a precedent condition of his\r\ninauguration we must give you these guarantees.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts hesitated, not because her blood was not stirred, but\r\nbecause she insisted that the Government and the inauguration should\r\ngo on, in the same manner they would have done had Mr. Lincoln been\r\ndefeated. She felt that she was touched in a tender point when invited\r\nhere under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is true, and I confess it frankly, that there are a few men at the\r\nNorth who have not yielded that support to the grand idea upon which\r\nthis confederated Union stands, that they should have done; who have\r\nbeen disposed to infringe upon, to attack certain rights which the\r\nentire North, with these exceptions, accords to you. But are you of\r\nthe South free from the like imputations? The John Brown invasion was\r\nnever justified at the North. If, in the excitement of the time, there\r\nwere those to be found who did not denounce it as gentlemen think they\r\nshould, it was because they knew it was a matter wholly outside the\r\nConstitution--that it was a crime to which Virginia would give\r\nadequate punishment.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I believe, yes, I know, that the people of the North are as\r\ntrue to the Government and the Union of the States now, as our\r\nfathers were when they stood shoulder to shoulder upon the field,\r\nfighting for the principles upon which that Union rests. If I thought\r\nthe time had come when it would be fit or proper to consider\r\namendments to the Constitution at all, I should believe that we would\r\nhave no trouble with you except upon this question of slavery in the\r\nterritories. You cannot demand of us at the North any thing that we\r\nwill not grant, unless it involves a sacrifice of our principles.\r\nThese we shall not sacrifice--these you must not ask us to abandon. I\r\nbelieve further, and I speak in all frankness, for I wish to delude no\r\none, that if the Constitution and the Union cannot be preserved and\r\neffectually maintained without these new guarantees for slavery, that\r\nthe Union is not worth preserving.\r\n\r\nThe people of the North have always submitted to the decisions of the\r\nproper constituted powers. This obedience has been unpleasant enough\r\nwhen they thought these powers were exercised for sectional purposes;\r\nbut it has always been implicitly yielded. I am ready, even now, to go\r\nhome and say that, by the decision of the Supreme Court, slavery\r\nexists in all the territories of the United States. We submit to the\r\ndecision and accept its consequences. But in view of all the\r\ncircumstances attending that decision, was it quite fair--was it quite\r\ngenerous for the gentleman from Maryland to say that, under it, by the\r\nadoption of these propositions, the South was giving up every thing,\r\nthe North giving up nothing? Does he suppose the South is yielding the\r\npoint in relation to any territory, which by any probability would\r\nbecome slave territory? Something more than the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court is necessary to establish slavery anywhere. The decision\r\nmay give the _right_ to establish it, other influences must control\r\nthe question of its actual establishment.\r\n\r\nI am opposed, further, to any restrictions on the acquisition of\r\nterritory. They are unnecessary. The time may come when they would be\r\ntroublesome. We may want the Canadas. The time may come when the\r\nCanadas may wish to unite with us. Shall we tie up our hands so that\r\nwe cannot receive them, or make it forever your interest to oppose\r\ntheir annexation? Such a restriction would be, by the common consent\r\nof the people, disregarded.\r\n\r\nThere are seven States out of the Union already. They have organized\r\nwhat they claim is an independent Government. They are not to be\r\ncoerced back, you say. Are the prospects very favorable that they will\r\nreturn of their own accord? But _they_ will annex territory. They are\r\nalready looking to Mexico. If left to themselves they would annex her\r\nand all her neighbors, and we should lose our highway to the Pacific\r\ncoast. They would acquire it, and to us it would be lost forever.\r\n\r\nThe North will consider well before she consents to this--before she\r\neven permits it. Ever since 1820 we have pursued, in this respect, a\r\nuniform policy. The North will hesitate long before, by accepting the\r\ncondition you propose, she deprives the nation of the valuable\r\nprivilege, the unquestionable right, of acquiring new territory in an\r\nhonorable way.\r\n\r\nI have tried to look upon these propositions of the majority of the\r\ncommittee, as true measures of pacification. I have listened patiently\r\nto all that has been said in their favor. But I am still unconvinced,\r\nor rather I am convinced that they will do nothing for the Union. They\r\nwill prove totally inadequate; may, perhaps, be positively\r\nmischievous. The North, the free States, will not adopt them--will not\r\nconsent to these new endorsements of an institution which they do not\r\nlike, which they believe to be injurious to the best interests of the\r\nRepublic; and if they did adopt them, as they could only do by a\r\nsacrifice of principles which you should not expect, the South would\r\nnot be satisfied; she would not fail to find pretexts for a course of\r\naction upon which I think she has already determined. I see in these\r\npropositions any thing but true measures of pacification.\r\n\r\nBut the North will never consent to the separation of the States. If\r\nthe South persists in the course on which she has entered we shall\r\nmarch our armies to the Gulf of Mexico, or you will march yours to the\r\nGreat Lakes. There can be no peaceful separation. There is one way by\r\nwhich war may be avoided and the Union preserved. It is a plain and a\r\nconstitutional way. If the slave States will abandon the design, which\r\nwe must infer from the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia they\r\nhave already formed, will faithfully abide by their constitutional\r\nobligations, and remain in the Union until their rights are in _fact_\r\ninvaded, all will be well. But if they take the responsibility of\r\ninvolving the country in a civil war; of breaking up the Government\r\nwhich our fathers founded and our people love, but one course remains\r\nto those who are true to that Government. They must and will defend it\r\nat every sacrifice--if necessary, to the sacrifice of their lives.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I came here with my colleagues representing a Southern\r\nState. I have had full and free communication with the people of all\r\nportions of the South, before, during, and since the election of the\r\nsixth of November, and I state here, that I have never dreamed that\r\nthere was the slightest objection anywhere to the inauguration of Mr.\r\nLINCOLN. To-day is the first time I ever heard the question raised,\r\nand yet I do not believe that any such objection now exists.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this is not a fit time to hold such a conference--not\r\na suitable time to consider the questions now before us. Is there any\r\nreason why we should not consider the rights of any section of the\r\ncountry, whether a President is going out or coming in? As one\r\ndelegate I will not consent to postpone the action necessary to secure\r\nour rights for any such reason as this.\r\n\r\nNow, as to this question of slavery in the Territories. It is true\r\nthat the Supreme Court has decided it in favor of the South. It is\r\nequally true that parties have repudiated that decision both in\r\nplatforms and on the stump.\r\n\r\nWhen territory has been acquired by the blood and treasure of the\r\ncommon Union, you cannot exclude one portion of the _cestuis que\r\ntrust_ from its rights. The Supreme Court so decided, and its decision\r\nwas just and equitable.\r\n\r\nAt the South, we ask for our rights _under the Constitution_. We say,\r\nlet all questions which affect or concern them be decided. The\r\ngentleman from Massachusetts says he will not give them up, that his\r\nState will not yield. Well, if this is so, let us go to the ballot\r\nbox. If the question is decided in the gentleman's favor there, _we\r\nknow how to take care of ourselves_.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Massachusetts does not understand this question. He\r\ndoes not understand why we of the South want it--why we must have it\r\nsettled. There _was_ a time when the embargo law threw our slaves out\r\nof employment. The North then contemplated a dissolution of the Union.\r\nWhy? Because she thought the Government wanted power--was\r\ninefficient. Now, there is a sense of insecurity felt throughout the\r\nSouth. Our property is depreciating, going down every day. We feel\r\nthis want of security very deeply, this want of faith in the\r\nGovernment under which we live. The South is in agitation.\r\n\r\nSuppose some event should in some way strike down the value of your\r\nproperty at the North. Would you not wish to have its security\r\nrestored? Would you not call for guarantees? If you would not, you are\r\nnot men. This is all we want; all we ask for, is security. There is\r\nnothing in the territorial question that we may not settle by a fair\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nThe commonwealth of Virginia called this Conference in high\r\npatriotism. I have an earnest faith in her sincerity and her purity in\r\ndoing so. She hoped to meet her sisters animated by the same\r\npatriotism--that they would join with her in granting the assurances,\r\nin giving the securities we need. Gentlemen, you can give us these\r\nsecurities--these assurances. We shall then go home and tell our\r\npeople that we can still live on together, in security. Will it do to\r\nsay that this cannot be done before the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN?\r\nNo! No such answer should go to the people of any of the States--no\r\nsuch answer will satisfy them. Give us the guarantees _here_. We will\r\nsatisfy the people of the whole nation as to the appropriateness of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThere is no truth in the assertions of the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts. We are willing to go before the old commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts with all her glorious memories, willing to go before New\r\nYork with her half million of voters, confident that both will do us\r\njustice. Why stand between us and the people? At least, let us ask\r\ntheir judgment upon our propositions.\r\n\r\nWe come here to confer, to propitiate, not to awaken old troubles and\r\ndifferences. If there are such existing and which must be settled, why\r\nshould we not settle them here? We all wish to bring back the seven\r\nStates which have left us; we have a common interest in them. I think\r\nthey should not have deserted us; that they should have consulted us\r\nfirst, and then there would have been no necessity. If they were here,\r\ntheir presence surely would not have weakened us, nor would their\r\npresence have disturbed the North. We come not here to widen our\r\nseparation--to drive them further off. We come to consult together, to\r\ngive and receive justice.\r\n\r\nI confess I am not much in favor of the second proposition of\r\namendment. We must regard this as a progressive country. From four\r\nmillions of people we have risen to thirty millions! Where will we be\r\nin eighty years more? There will be in that time a great population in\r\nour now unsettled territory--perhaps greater than all our present\r\npopulation. I thought the amendment unwise, but I consented to it, for\r\nif we would agree we must all yield something.\r\n\r\nAnd now I hope, and hope most earnestly, that without crimination or\r\nrecrimination we shall vote in good temper and in good time, so that\r\nour proposals may in due time go before Congress and before the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDo not let us give up to revolution anywhere, in any section of the\r\nUnion! Do not you of the North impose upon us the necessity of fleeing\r\nour country! God knows this same necessity may come to you of the\r\nNorth, and sooner than you expect it. If disruption--if war must come,\r\none-half your merchants, one-half your mechanics will become bankrupt.\r\nYou are marching that way with hasty steps. Not one man, North or\r\nSouth, but must suffer if the sad conclusion comes. Our products will\r\ndepreciate. Next year not one-half the fields now whitened by the rich\r\ngrowth of cotton will be cultivated if this unhappy contest goes on.\r\n\r\nThe people of my section, the people of the South, are restless and\r\nimpatient. They are already in the way of revolution--all these\r\ninfluences are leading them on. Can they remain quiet when the\r\nfortunes of one-half of them are struck down? Can you at the North\r\nremain quiet under like provocations? And yet harmony may even yet be\r\nrestored. All these differences may be settled harmoniously. We\r\nbelieve they may be settled now.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--If we should agree to all your propositions, and Congress\r\nstill should not act upon them, would not these difficulties be still\r\nmore complicated?\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--No, sir! No! We would then tell our people that this\r\nConference would, but Congress would not do any thing to save the\r\ncountry. In such an event we would wait for the ballot box and a new\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--Permit me one question to the gentleman from Kentucky.\r\nWould this Convention, in his opinion, have been called by Virginia,\r\nif either Mr. DOUGLAS or Mr. BRECKENRIDGE had been elected?\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I do not think it would have been called in that event.\r\nLet me say, however, one thing which escaped me. It is not a divided\r\nDemocracy--not the existence of a Whig party, but it is the union of\r\nall discordant elements combined, which have brought the abolitionists\r\ninto power, which has produced this sense of insecurity in the South.\r\nIt is their combined power which the people of the South feel, and\r\nwhich they wish to guard against.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--I feel bound to say to all here present, that unless\r\nthis debate stops now, we might as well go home. I have pondered much\r\nupon the remark of my worthy friend from Kentucky, that if we could\r\nnot do good here, at least we ought not to do harm. Why should we do\r\nany thing to aggravate these unhappy circumstances? Let us not widen\r\nour dissensions; let us do nothing to postpone or destroy the only\r\nhope we have for the settlement of our troubles.\r\n\r\nLet us be gentle and pleasant. Let us love one another. Let us not try\r\nto find out who is the smartest or the keenest. Let us vote soon, and\r\nwithout any feeling or any quarrelling.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I fear from some remarks that have been made during this\r\ndiscussion, that not only my motives, but the terms in which I have\r\nexpressed them, have been misapprehended. I have been untrue to every\r\npurpose of my mind, if I have spoken with any bitterness or acrimony.\r\nI thought it was my duty to be plain--at the same time temperate\r\nthough emphatic. I thought I had been so. Nothing is farther from my\r\npurpose than the irritation of any section, much less of any member\r\nhere. Most assuredly I did not intend to create dissension or to give\r\nthe slightest occasion for personal feeling or recrimination.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT finding it necessary to leave the Conference, now called\r\nMr. ALEXANDER to the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--I did not mean to stir up anybody. I want to settle\r\nthese unhappy points of difference here. I want to settle them to-day,\r\nnow, this very hour. Suppose we do not settle them! Does not border\r\nwar follow? does not civil war come? I speak to all of you, both\r\nNorth and South. What becomes of your property in such a case? Who\r\nwants to stake it all on such a hazard? We settled this question once\r\nfairly, and, as everybody thought, finally. That was in 1850. Why was\r\nnot that settlement permitted to stand? Nothing but the ambition that\r\nhas sent so many angels down to hell could have ever brought it up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt is too late to bring charges against either section now--too late\r\nto bring charges against individuals. The question now before us\r\nis,--Which is the way to lead the country out of her present danger?\r\nWe want faith and good works--these alone will do it. If these fail,\r\nwe have no hope elsewhere. I am in favor of the propositions of\r\namendment submitted. These we can stand upon throughout the land. The\r\npeople will adopt them. In the name of all that is good and holy let\r\nus settle these differences here.\r\n\r\nWhy talk about territory to be acquired hereafter? We have just the\r\nsame title to it that the devil had to the territory he offered our\r\nSaviour on a certain remarkable occasion--just the same title, at all\r\nevents, no better. For Heaven's sake, gentlemen, let us act for the\r\ngood of the country! let us give to every section its rights--to every\r\nman his rights, and let this be remembered through all time as the\r\nConvention of Patriots which sacrificed every selfish and personal\r\nconsideration to save the country!\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I wish to make one remark to the Conference, and\r\nespecially to the gentleman from Kentucky. Much is said here about\r\nequal rights. We have always believed in that doctrine. We believe\r\nthis to be a country of equals. We went into the last Presidential\r\ncontest as equals--and as such we elected Mr. LINCOLN. Now, when we\r\nhave the right to do so, we wish to come into power as equals--with\r\nthat superiority only which our majority gives us. When we are in\r\npower and disturb or threaten to disturb the rights of any portion of\r\nthe Union, then ask us for security, for guarantees, and if need be\r\nyou shall have both. How would you have treated us if we had come to\r\nyou with such a request at the commencement of any Democratic\r\nadministration?\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I want to refer the report of the majority, and the\r\nsubstitute proposed by the minority, back to the committee. I believe\r\nthat it is better to have action upon all these questions at the\r\nearliest possible moment. The question now is, not which section of\r\nthe Union is suffering most--all sections are suffering; all are\r\nfeeling the influence of this agitation; all look with fear and\r\ntrembling to the future; all desire a speedy and a peaceful conclusion\r\nof our differences. If we cannot settle them here--if we cannot induce\r\nCongress to submit our propositions of amendment to the people, then I\r\npray from my heart, I hope and believe, that our friends in every\r\nsection will wait patiently until these propositions can go before the\r\nState Legislatures and receive proper consideration there.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT here stated the proposition, to refer the reports of the\r\nmajority and the minority of the committee back to the committee, with\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nSeveral members objected to the motion, declaring it not in order.\r\n\r\nThe motion was thereupon withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question recurs upon the amendment offered by the\r\ngentleman from Maryland, to insert the word \"present\" before the word\r\nterritories, in the first line and the fifth line of the propositions\r\nof the amendment to the Constitution submitted by the majority of the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was adopted without a count of the yeas and nays, and\r\nthe first section of the majority report, after the adoption of the\r\namendment, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the present territory of the United\r\n     States, not embraced within the limits of the Cherokee\r\n     treaty grant, north of a line from east to west on the\r\n     parallel of 36° 30´ north latitude, involuntary servitude,\r\n     except in punishment of crime, is prohibited whilst it shall\r\n     be under a Territorial Government; and in all the present\r\n     territory south of said line, the status of persons owing\r\n     service or labor as it now exists, shall not be changed by\r\n     law while such territory shall be under a Territorial\r\n     Government; and neither Congress nor the Territorial\r\n     Government shall have power to hinder or prevent the taking\r\n     to said territory of persons held to labor or involuntary\r\n     service, within the United States, according to the laws or\r\n     usages of the State from which such persons may be taken,\r\n     nor to impair the rights arising out of said relations,\r\n     which shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal\r\n     Courts, according to the common law; and when any territory\r\n     north or south of said line, within such boundary as\r\n     Congress may prescribe, shall contain a population required\r\n     for a member of Congress, according to the then Federal\r\n     ratio of representation, it shall, if its form of government\r\n     be republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal\r\n     footing with the original States, with or without\r\n     involuntary service or labor, as the Constitution of such\r\n     new State may provide.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN:--I move that when this Conference adjourn, it adjourn to\r\nmeet at seven o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I move an adjournment of the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN:--Is not my motion first in order?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question is on the motion of the gentleman from\r\nVermont.\r\n\r\nThe motion to adjourn was put and carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELFTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, TUESDAY, _February 19th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by the PRESIDENT at eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were opened with prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Journal was read by Assistant Secretary PULESTON, and, after\r\nsundry amendments, was approved.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--The Committee on Credentials have received and\r\nconsidered the credentials of Mr. FRANCIS GRANGER, of New York,\r\nappointed to fill a vacancy in the delegation from that State,\r\noccasioned by the resignation of Mr. ADDISON GARDINER. They are\r\nsatisfactory, and if no objection is made, the list of delegates from\r\nNew York will be altered accordingly.\r\n\r\nNo objection was made, and Mr. GRANGER'S name was added to the list of\r\ndelegates from New York.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I ask now that the resolution limiting the time to be\r\noccupied by each member in debate be taken up. I have become satisfied\r\nthat unless we place some restrictions, in this respect, upon the\r\ndiscussions, we shall occupy much more time than we wish to have\r\nexpended in that way. The session of the present Congress will soon\r\nterminate. Our labors will be useless, unless we submit the result of\r\nthem to Congress in time to secure the approval of that body. The\r\npropositions will be debated there, and that debate must necessarily\r\noccupy time. I am sure no gentleman wishes to defeat the main purpose\r\nof the Conference by delay. The resolution is as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the discussions which may take place in\r\n     this Convention upon any question, no member shall be\r\n     allowed to speak more than thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIS:--I move to amend the resolution by inserting _ten_ minutes\r\ninstead of _thirty_ minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Is it seriously contemplated now, after gentlemen upon one\r\nside have spoken two or three times, and at great length--after the\r\nquestions involved in the committee's reports have been thoroughly and\r\nexhaustively discussed on the part of the South--and when only one\r\ngentleman from the North has been heard upon the general subject, to\r\ncut us off from all opportunity of expressing our views? Such a course\r\nwill not help your propositions.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUTWELL:--Massachusetts will never consent to this.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--If we cannot get Massachusetts to help us, we will\r\nhelp ourselves. We got along without her in the war of 1812; we can\r\nget on without her again. The disease exists in the nation now. It is\r\nof no use, or rather it is too late to talk about the cause, we had\r\nmuch better try to cure the disease.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--New York has not occupied the time of the Conference for\r\nthree minutes. Kentucky has been heard twice, her representative\r\nspeaking as long as he wished. I insist upon the same right for New\r\nYork. I insist upon the discussion of these questions without\r\nrestriction or limitation.\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--I wish to speak for the commercial interests of the\r\ncountry. I cannot do them justice in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I am very desirous to reach an early\r\ndecision, and yet I do not quite like to restrict debate in this way.\r\nSuppose, after holding one morning session, we have another commencing\r\nat half-past seven in the evening?\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--We have come here for the purpose of _acting_; not to\r\nhear speeches. There is no use in talking over these things; our minds\r\nare all made up, and talking will not change them. I want to make an\r\nend of these discussions. I move that all debate shall close at three\r\no'clock to-day, and that the Conference then proceed to vote upon the\r\npropositions before it.\r\n\r\nMr. ALLEN:--The object which brought us together I presume we shall\r\nnot disagree about. We came here for the purpose of consultation over\r\nthe condition of the country. If this is true, nothing but harm can\r\ncome from these limitations upon the liberty of speech. The questions\r\nbefore us are the most important that could possibly arise. Before our\r\npresent Constitution was adopted it was discussed and examined in\r\nConvention for more than three months. We are now practically making a\r\nnew Constitution. Though we as members differed widely when we came\r\nhere, I think progress has been made toward our ultimate agreement. I\r\nthink the general effect of our discussions is to bring us nearer\r\ntogether. I think our acquaintance and our association as members lead\r\nto the same end.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Kentucky says that we have come here to heal\r\ndisease. I don't quite agree with him as to the disease. I differ\r\nwidely from him as to the proper method of treating it. He seems\r\ndisposed to apply a plaster to the foot, to cure a disease in the\r\nhead. If these debates should continue for a week, the time would not\r\nbe lost, the effect would be favorable. We should have more faith in\r\neach other, a more kindly feeling would be produced. Do not let us\r\nhurry. You may _force_ a vote to-day, but the result will satisfy\r\nnone. Such a course will give good ground for dissatisfaction. You may\r\neven carry your propositions by a majority, but what weight will such\r\na vote have in Congress or with the people?\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--We who represent smaller States intend to be very\r\nmodest here, but you will need our votes when you seek to place new\r\nand important limitations upon a Constitution with which we are now\r\nsatisfied. I will answer for one State, and tell you that she will not\r\nlisten to a proposition that comes to her with a taint of suspicion\r\nabout it. If you will not allow her representatives to participate in\r\nthe examination and discussion of these propositions here, her people\r\nwill reject them without discussion, if they are ever called to act on\r\nthem. She has not occupied the time of this Conference for one minute\r\nupon the general subject. She may not wish to do so. I submit whether\r\nit is wise for you to cut off her right to be heard here, if she\r\nchooses to exercise it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I agree with the gentleman from Tennessee, that we came\r\nhere to act and not to talk. We have had talking enough, perhaps too\r\nmuch already. I have drawn up a resolution which I think covers the\r\nwhole subject, I move its adoption. The resolution was read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this Convention will hold two sessions\r\n     daily, viz., from ten o'clock, A.M., to four o'clock, P.M.;\r\n     and from eight to ten o'clock, P.M.; and that no motion to\r\n     adjourn prior to said hours of four and ten, P.M., shall be\r\n     in order, if objection be made; and that on Thursday next,\r\n     at twelve o'clock, noon, all debate shall cease, and the\r\n     Convention proceed to vote upon the questions or\r\n     propositions before them in their order.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT commenced a statement of the various propositions\r\nrelating to the subject now pending, when Mr. ALEXANDER moved to lay\r\nthe whole subject on the table.\r\n\r\nThe motion to lay on the table was negatived by the following\r\nvote:--ayes, 48; nays, 54.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I call for the division of the question.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--So many motions have been made that it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to decide, by the rules of Parliamentary law, which is in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nI will divide the questions as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Will the Conference hold two sessions daily?\r\n\r\n2d. Shall the debate be closed on Thursday at twelve o'clock?\r\n\r\n3d. Shall each member be limited to ten minutes in the discussion?\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--I hope the questions will be decided\r\naffirmatively.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--It appears to me that we can arrange this whole subject\r\nwithout serious difficulty. If Mr. WICKLIFFE will adhere to his\r\nresolution, and the other proposals are withdrawn, we can then\r\nproceed. If any gentleman finds it necessary to ask for an extension\r\nof his time, it will no doubt be granted to him. Mr. RANDOLPH'S\r\nproposition exacts too much labor. I think the Conference had better\r\nlimit the time of each member. I am opposed to fixing a time for\r\nterminating the discussion. It will not be agreeable to many who may\r\nbe cut off. It is contrary to the spirit of the rules we have already\r\nadopted. I hope we shall not be compelled to vote on the questions one\r\nby one, and I will suggest to Mr. RANDOLPH whether it would not be\r\nbetter that his resolution should be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. HOPPIN:--I hope the resolution will pass as it is. We have come\r\nhere to act. We are all ready to take the vote now. The sooner we vote\r\nthe better. There is every necessity for prompt action.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--If the proposition had emanated from another quarter, I\r\nshould feel at liberty to urge its adoption. As it is, I would pay the\r\nhighest respect to it. I regret extremely to hear the talk about\r\n_sides_ in this Conference. I came here to act for the Union--the\r\nwhole Union. I recognize no sides--no party. If any come here for a\r\ndifferent purpose I do not wish to act with them; they are wrong. I\r\nhope from my heart that we can all yet live together in peace; but if\r\nwe are to do so we must act, and act speedily.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE again stated his proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--If I understand rightly, the question should be on\r\nstriking out the latter clause of the resolution, so as to perfect it\r\nand make it meet the case. I make the point and--\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I think the gentleman from Maryland is right.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--I desire to ask whether a resolution to supersede the\r\nmotion to adjourn is in order?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the question should first be taken on the\r\nmotion to strike out the last clause in the resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. STOCKTON:--If the Conference felt as I do, it would at once\r\nestablish such peremptory orders as would bring a speedy termination\r\nto this whole business. Upon what, let me ask gentlemen, does the\r\nsalvation of the Union depend at this moment? What is it alone that\r\nprevents civil war now? I answer, it is the session of this\r\nConvention--this august Convention! We stand in the presence of an\r\nawful danger! We feel the throes of an earthquake which threatens to\r\nbring down ruin on the whole magnificent fabric of our Government! Is\r\nit possible that we should suffer this ruin to take place? Would it\r\nnot impeach the wisdom and good sense of our day and generation to\r\npermit the edifice which our fathers constructed--to crumble to\r\npieces? No! fellow countrymen, it is necessary that we, by trusting in\r\nGod, who guided our ancestors through the stormy vicissitudes of the\r\nRevolution, should this day resolve that the Union shall be preserved!\r\n\r\nIn the execution of that resolve let us unfold a new leaf in our\r\nnational history, and write thereon words of peace. Peace or war is\r\nin our hands--an awful alternative! Peace alone is the object of our\r\nmission; to restore peace to a distracted country. I have spent my\r\nwhole life in the service of my country. I love the people of every\r\nState in it. They have been under my command and I have been under\r\ntheirs. I know them, and I know that this Union can never be dissolved\r\nwithout a struggle. Will you hasten the time when we shall begin to\r\nshed each other's blood? No! gentlemen, no!\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one question which gives us any difficulty in\r\nadjusting. That is, about the right of the South to take their slaves\r\ninto the territories. Is it possible that we can permit this Union to\r\nbe broken up because of any difference on such a question as this?\r\nBetter that the territories were buried in the deep sea beyond the\r\nplummet's reach, than that they should be the cause of such a\r\ndeplorable result.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the value of the territories which is in dispute; it is\r\nnot whether the North or the South shall colonize them, because, as\r\nthe gentleman from New York has said, that though the territory south\r\nof 36° 30´ had been ten years open to Southern colonization, only\r\ntwenty-four slaves had been introduced into it. No, the real question\r\nis, whether pride of opinion shall succumb to the necessities of the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThe Premier of the incoming administration has declared that parties\r\nand platforms are subordinate to, and must disappear in the presence\r\nof the great question of the Union. This gives me hope. Let him and\r\nhis friends act upon that, and this Conference can in six hours, in\r\nconjunction with a committee of his political friends, adjust such\r\nterms of settlement as will save the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Curtius offered himself as a sacrifice to save Rome, when\r\ninformed by the oracle that the loss of his life would save his\r\ncountry. We are now in greater danger than Rome was then; but is there\r\nno Curtius for our salvation? We are not called upon to give up life,\r\nproperty, or honor, but to concede justice and equal rights to our\r\nSouthern brethren. We only want the courage to yield extreme opinions.\r\nWhat power, after victory, refuses to lower the lofty terms which were\r\nasserted on the eve of the battle for the sake of peace? But the\r\nRepublicans say, shall we surrender the fruits of victory to the\r\nvanquished? I answer, how are you to enjoy your fruits without\r\npacification? You expected to govern the whole country. You aspired to\r\nthe control of the whole empire. Without peace you will not succeed in\r\nestablishing possession of that magnificent country which your\r\npredecessors governed, but you will govern a little more than half of\r\nit, and with that you have to provide for war.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to dispose of the threatening attitude of the South by\r\ndenouncing it as a rebellion--as treason. It is idle to disguise the\r\ndanger. The revolt of a whole people, covering a territory equal to\r\nhalf of Europe, is a revolution. You cannot dwarf the movement by\r\nstigmatizing it as treason. Its magnitude and proportions make the\r\nsword, and not the law, its arbiter. Is it possible that people can be\r\nso infatuated as to contemplate the use of the sword to conquer\r\nsecession? Will you hasten the time when we shall begin to shed each\r\nother's blood? Coerce! force fifteen States! Why, you cannot force New\r\nJersey alone! Force the South? They won't stop to count\r\nforces--neither side can be frightened. Don't think of it. You cannot\r\nfrighten either, no more than the hero could be frightened whom the\r\nRoman poet has immortalized. Suppose after the expenditure of a\r\nthousand millions you shall have stopped dismemberment and subjugated\r\nthe South, what is to become of the country then? what is to become of\r\nthe army and its chiefs who have conquered? When the Long Parliament\r\nhad murdered Charles, subdued Ireland and Scotland, and compelled the\r\ndeference of all Europe, they supposed they would enjoy the fruits of\r\ntheir victories. They began to discuss the expenses of the army, and\r\nthe expediency of its reduction. They had hardly commenced when\r\nCromwell entered Westminster Hall and turned out the Republican party\r\nof that day. The whole country, tired of war, crouched under the iron\r\nheel of the Puritan soldier. The Republican party of England\r\nsuccumbed; Cromwell died; his son resigned the Protectorate, and the\r\nRepublican party of England rose to the surface and made its last\r\nstruggle for its power. General Monk and his army approached London,\r\nand Parliament with servility waited the pleasure of the army. The\r\narmy declared for the King, and the King was restored.\r\n\r\nWhen men meet to save the country, they must be prepared to give up\r\nevery thing--to give their lives if necessary. How can men stop for\r\nparty platforms when their country is in danger? But will the country\r\nconsent to be dragged into civil war to maintain the Chicago Platform?\r\nIt will not. That Platform was erected upon a perishable foundation.\r\nIn the language of the New York Senator, it must \"disappear.\"\r\n\r\nI appeal to the brotherhood, to the fraternity of the North. My\r\nfriends, peace or war is in your hands. You hold the keys of peace or\r\nwar. You tell us not to hasten in this matter. But you do not realize\r\nthe facts--no one does. It is said that the South challenges and\r\ninvites war. No such thing. The mad action of South Carolina does not\r\ntruly represent the South. There are disunionists South as well as\r\nNorth. It is the duty of patriotic men to checkmate the disunionists\r\nof both sections. By a proclamation of war, we shall effectually play\r\ninto the hands and gratify the disunionists of both extremes. Civil\r\nwar consolidates the South as a unit for disunion. The gallant\r\nsouthern men who have so nobly battled for the Union against great\r\nodds, will then be overpowered and forced into the ranks of the\r\ndefenders of the South. While the South will thus be undivided and\r\nstand in solid phalanx, what will be our condition here at the North?\r\n\r\nCan it be supposed that the Union men of the Democracy of the North\r\nwill stand by and see the country plunged into civil war to maintain\r\nthe Chicago Platform? Will they acquiesce in the demolition of this\r\nUnion by these means, when it can be preserved by peace? No, sir! Do\r\nyou talk here about regiments for invasion, for coercion--you,\r\ngentlemen of the North? You know better; I know better. For every\r\nregiment raised there for coercion, there will be another raised for\r\nresistance to coercion. If no other State will raise them, remember\r\nNew Jersey. The Republican leaders of the North, with hot haste, have\r\nworked through the Legislatures of the several States resolutions of a\r\nbelligerent character, offering the military power of those States to\r\nthe Government to subdue the South. Did the people of the North\r\nauthorize those Legislatures to make any such tenders? Would the\r\npeople of the North sanction any such nefarious policy? I know well\r\nthe enormous bribe with which the Republican leaders would seduce the\r\nNorth into fratricidal war. The expenditure of uncounted millions, the\r\ndistribution of epaulets and military commissions for an army of half\r\na million of men, the immense patronage involved in the letting of\r\narmy contracts, the inflation of prices and the rise of property which\r\nwould follow the excessive issue of paper money, made necessary by the\r\nlavish expenditure;--these, indeed, are the enormous bribes which the\r\nRepublican party offers.\r\n\r\nHow arrogant it is for the Republican leaders to tender the military\r\npower of their States! Who gave them or their States authority to\r\nraise armies? For national purposes the whole militia of the Union is\r\nsubject to Congress. Congress alone has power to declare war and to\r\ncall out the militia, and Congress can only call upon the militia to\r\nsuppress insurrection or repel invasion. Pause, gentlemen! Stop where\r\nyou are! You will bring strife to your own doors, to your very\r\nhearthstones--bloody, disheartening strife. War will be in your own\r\nhomes, among your own families. Under ordinary circumstances you would\r\nhesitate. If the question was about tariff, you would hesitate and\r\nlook at the awful consequences. That there is a diversity between us\r\nis very true. What of it? It lies in a nutshell. We can fix it in a\r\nminute, if you will be calm and act like brothers.\r\n\r\nThe only question, as I understand it, for I have thought and studied\r\nupon it, is this: You of the North will not yield to the South the\r\nsmall privilege of taking their slaves into the territories of the\r\ncommon Union. You will not give them a fair chance with you, even in\r\nthe Government property--the territories. When the territories become\r\nStates they will have to take care of themselves. You cannot theorize\r\nslave soil into free soil, nor _vice versâ_. Am I not right? Does the\r\nSouth ask any control or power over these territories after they have\r\nbecome States? No, gentlemen; the South demands no such thing. It is\r\nnot demanded by her, and never will be. All I ask for the South, and\r\nall she asks for herself, is this: Let us be free to come with our\r\nslaves into all your territories, and hold them there until the\r\nterritory is made up into States.\r\n\r\nI have shown that if peace be not secured, the uprising of the South\r\nwould be a revolution, and cannot be treated as mere insurrection. The\r\nbravado, therefore, of offering armies to the Government, can only\r\nhave the effect, at this crisis, of preventing a peaceful adjustment.\r\nAgainst all such demonstrations we must fix our faces like flint.\r\nPeace we must have. The Union can only be preserved by peace. The\r\nSouth asks no more than the North will concede, if the people of the\r\nNorth can express their sentiments. The South only asks for equal\r\nrights, and to be let alone. For thirty years she has asked no more.\r\nThe South will soon present its cause in an authoritative shape. Their\r\nconventions will soon declare their propositions. Let the North be\r\nprepared to consider them in conventions representing their people\r\nfairly. If this is done, there is no doubt the present crisis will\r\npass without danger. Until time for these results can be taken, let\r\nwarlike demonstrations be resisted. Let the Government abstain from\r\ncollision, even with South Carolina. There is as much of loyalty to\r\nthe Union at the South as anywhere. It has only disappeared in the\r\npresence of danger which threatened their domestic tranquillity, their\r\nsafety, and their honor. Let the hostile attitude which the North\r\nassumed at Chicago give place to the recognition of the rights of the\r\nSouth, and we shall see an outburst of loyalty to the Union throughout\r\nthe entire South, like that which welcomed to old England its\r\nconstitutional sovereign after a long and bloody civil war, forced\r\nupon the English people by the Puritans. It is the spirit of the same\r\nfanatic intolerance which has caused our present troubles.\r\n\r\nIntelligent citizens should abandon platforms and stand up for peace.\r\nPeace with all nations has been the master policy. It has elevated our\r\ncountry to its present condition of power and prosperity. Do not let\r\nus sacrifice peace, and suffer violence and discord to usurp its\r\nreign. We have a magnificent future if we can only preserve the Union\r\nas our fathers constructed it. While it lasts there is a great light\r\nin the firmament in which all may walk in security, hope, and\r\nhappiness. It is a light reaching far down the depths of futurity\r\ncheering and guiding the steps of our children. It is a light shining\r\nto the remotest corner of the earth--raising up the down-trodden and\r\nilluminating the homes of the victims of oppression. But let that\r\nlight be now eclipsed, go out in blood and darkness, and the hopes of\r\nmankind are forever blasted.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, will you not consider? Shall we not settle the question\r\nhere, and not trouble the rest of the Union with it? We will settle it\r\nfairly and squarely. It is too small a matter to get mad about--to set\r\nabout destroying the Union. Why quarrel over such a simple question?\r\nNo, gentlemen, you shall not do it. I am going to talk to you as\r\nindividuals--as men--as patriots. I know too many of you and too much\r\nabout you. You love your country too well to destroy her for such a\r\ncause. You are too patriotic. The North will never dissolve this Union\r\non any such pretexts. You cannot destroy your country for that. You\r\nlove it too much. I call on you, WADSWORTH and KING, FIELD and CHASE\r\nand MORRILL--as able men, as brothers--as good patriots--to give up\r\nevery thing else if it is necessary, to save your country. But we\r\ndon't ask you to give up any thing in the way of principles.\r\n\r\nNow that Chicago Platform of yours is a nice paper. It has many good\r\nthings in it. But it must not control this question. You can keep that\r\nplatform and save your country: but you must save your country. Shall\r\nwe go into war upon this little question about the Territories. No!\r\nNo!!\r\n\r\nUnder the most favorable circumstances possible for the experiment of\r\nself-government, with every possible inducement to preserve our\r\ncountry, we must not give it up. The years of civil war which will\r\nsucceed dismemberment of the Union will cause true men to seek refuge\r\nand security, from military despotism, in some other country. Some\r\nCæsar or Napoleon will spring from the vortex of revolution and war,\r\nand with his sword cleave his way to supreme command. If all history\r\nis not a failure, and if mankind are now what they have always been,\r\nsuch will be the fate of free government in the United States, in the\r\nevent of war. Shall we bring such a catastrophe upon us to vindicate\r\nthe Chicago Platform? No! the American people will rise in their\r\nomnipotence and trample into dust the man who dared to put in jeopardy\r\nthis Union, in order to maintain such demagogism. Away with parties\r\nand platforms and every thing else which would obstruct the free and\r\npatriotic efforts now making for the salvation of the Union. It shall\r\nnot be destroyed. I tell you, friends, I am going to stand right in\r\nthe way. You shall not go home; you shall never see your wives and\r\nfamilies again, until you have settled these matters, and saved your\r\ngood old country, if I can help it. Spread aloft the banner of stripes\r\nand stars, let the whole country rally beneath its glorious folds,\r\nwith no other slogan on their lips but the unanimous cry, THE UNION,\r\nIT MUST BE PRESERVED!\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--New Jersey has addressed New York as though she supposed\r\nthe delegation from that State to be united in its opinions, and its\r\naction. Let me set the gentleman himself and the Conference right on\r\nthat point at the commencement. The members composing that delegation\r\ndo not agree; very far from it. The vote of that delegation hitherto\r\nhas been determined by a majority only; a majority reduced to the very\r\nsmallest point possible now, since the delegation is full. It may be\r\nsaid that New York voted at the last Presidential election against us\r\nby a majority of fifty thousand; but let me assure you that if the\r\nnoble propositions of the majority of your committee, which I read for\r\nthe first time yesterday, could be submitted to them, the people of\r\nNew York would adopt them by even a larger majority.\r\n\r\nThese _are_ noble propositions; they are worthy the eminent and\r\npatriotic committee from which they have emanated. They present a fair\r\nand equitable basis for the adjustment of our difficulties; they are a\r\nshield and a sure defence against the dangers which threaten us. They\r\nare such as the people expect and such as they want. They know that\r\nthe politicians who have brought the country to the verge of ruin can\r\nbe trusted no longer. The time has come when they must act for\r\nthemselves. Be assured, gentlemen, they will do so.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a few words about the last election in New York, for it\r\nhas been widely misrepresented and misunderstood. How did we go into\r\nthat canvass? Upon what principles was it conducted? What\r\nrepresentations were made? I am one of the men who have struggled to\r\nmeet and oppose this Republican party from the outset--to avert, if\r\npossible, the adoption of its pernicious principles by the people of\r\nNew York. I took my stand upon the Compromise of 1850, and separated\r\nmyself politically from all men who could not stand with me on that\r\nplatform. We struggled on until that Compromise was adopted by the\r\nBaltimore Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas bill was introduced at a most fatal hour. It was\r\ndistasteful to the whole country; satisfactory nowhere. In due time\r\nthe Charleston Convention was assembled, and the Democratic party was\r\nbroken up forever.\r\n\r\nWhat next? Next came the Chicago Convention. It may have been\r\nconducted with dignity, and it nominated a candidate. I differ widely\r\nfrom that candidate in my principles and my policy. And yet I believe\r\nin him although I opposed his election. I would trust his Kentucky\r\nblood to the end, if all else failed. I think he is honest. I have no\r\nidea that he will permit the policy of his administration to be\r\ncontrolled by the hotheaded zealots who have been so conspicuous in\r\nthe last canvass. I expect to see him call to his council board, cool,\r\ndispassionate, and conservative men; not men who are driven to the\r\nverge of insanity upon this question of slavery.\r\n\r\nWhat next? The Baltimore Convention was held. The tragedy was\r\nconsummated; the contest was ended. The mere scuffle to secure the\r\ncontrol of the Convention which ended in its division, has brought the\r\ncountry into all its present difficulties. If that Convention had\r\npresented to the people a good conservative Democrat, there were\r\nseventy-five thousand good old line Whigs who would have buckled on\r\ntheir armor and would have won the battle for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Southern papers began to threaten disunion because LINCOLN\r\ndid not suit the South, I was not one who abused or denounced them. I\r\nknew the temper of some of the politicians in the free States. I knew\r\nthe action of the South was not impulsive. I knew there was a reason\r\nfor it. They said their capital was to be rendered worthless--their\r\nproperty to be destroyed, and their country made desolate. God forbid\r\nthat I should chide them for thinking so!\r\n\r\nThe Northern mind is in some respects very different from the\r\nSouthern. It is not started by slight scratches, but strike the rowel\r\ndeep, and there is a purpose in it that nothing can conquer or\r\nrestrain. The people of the North will carry that purpose into\r\nexecution, with a power as fierce as that of the maddest chivalry of\r\nSouth Carolina. The rowel _was_ struck deep and the consequences were\r\nnot considered.\r\n\r\nSubjects have been introduced into this discussion which I should have\r\nbeen glad to have avoided, which it would have been better every way\r\nto have avoided. The gentleman from Virginia has referred to the JOHN\r\nBROWN invasion. That is one of those subjects. He spoke of the feeling\r\nat the North regarding insurrections. I assure you that the North\r\nregarded the invader in that case as a foe in your homes--uncurbed and\r\nunrestrained--a terrible enemy. I would say to the gentleman from\r\nVirginia, that although too many instances among extreme men may have\r\nbeen found of attempts to justify that invasion, such was not the\r\ngeneral feeling at the North. Those instances were rare exceptions;\r\nand because they were so few and so exceptional, acquired a degree of\r\nnotoriety and received a degree of attention to which they were never\r\nentitled. Such instances as these have always served to prejudice the\r\nSouth improperly against the North. Men are too much given to forming\r\nopinions of us from the intemperate acts of a few meddling men.\r\n\r\nHow do we stand at the present moment in this respect. You will find a\r\nfew men among us, even now, rash enough to say, \"Let these Southern\r\nslaveholders go. The 'nigger' will rise upon them and cut their\r\nthroats!\" The action of such men, I admit, gives some color and\r\njustification to your charges and prejudices against the whole\r\nNorthern people.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, gentlemen, that this is now a question of peace or\r\nwar. I believe it to be so from my very soul. The North has been much\r\nto blame in bringing it upon us. What has been the language used at\r\nthe North? Men have used such expressions as this, \"The South secede?\r\nWhy, you can't kick out the South.\" And men who knew no better\r\nbelieved the statement to be true. I appeal to northern men to say\r\nwhether this has not been so. I myself thought four States would go,\r\nbut I believed secession would stop there. We had more to hope from\r\nLouisiana than from any other Gulf State. She has gone, and has now\r\ntaken up a most offensive and threatening position. Virginia to-day is\r\nin more danger of immediate secession than Louisiana was a few short\r\nmonths ago.\r\n\r\nMy friend from New Jersey says that if this Convention does not\r\nprevent it, there must be war. I agree with him. War! what a fearful\r\nalternative to contemplate? War is a fearful calamity at best,\r\nsometimes necessary I admit, but always terrible. It cannot come to\r\nthis country without a fearful expenditure of blood and treasure. It\r\nwill leave us, if it leaves us a nation at all, with an awful legacy\r\nof widows' tears--of the blighted hopes of orphans--with a catalogue\r\nof suffering, misery, and woe, too long to be enumerated and too\r\npainful to be contemplated. For God's sake! let such a fate be averted\r\nat any cost, from the country. If it comes at all, it will be such a\r\nwar as the world never saw. War is commonly, and almost universally,\r\nbetween nations foreign to each other--whose individuals are strangers\r\nto each other, and whose interests are widely separated. But we are a\r\nnation of brothers, of a common ancestry, and bound together by a\r\nthousand memories of the past--a thousand ties of interest and blood.\r\nIt will be a war between brothers--between you who come to us in\r\nsummer, and we who visit you in winter. It will be a war between those\r\nwho have been connected in business--associated in pleasures, and who\r\nhave met as brothers in the halls of legislation and the marts of\r\ncommerce. Save us from such a war! Let not the mad anger of such a\r\npeople be aroused. And, gentlemen, if war comes it must be long and\r\nterrible. You will see both parties rise in their majesty at both ends\r\nof the line. They will slough off every other consideration and devote\r\nthemselves, with terrible energy, to the work of death. Oh ye! who\r\nbring such a calamity as this upon this once happy country! Pause,\r\ngentlemen, before you do it, and think of the fearful accountability\r\nthat awaits you in time and in eternity.\r\n\r\nBut I am here to answer for the State of New York; the Empire State\r\nand the people of the Empire State. I have never been classed with the\r\nrash men of that State who have aided in bringing about this condition\r\nof things. I will not be classed with those who now thrust themselves\r\nbetween the Empire State and those glorious propositions of your\r\ncommittee. They are in the smallest possible majority even in our\r\ndelegation. All I ask is, that we may have the judgment of the people\r\nupon these propositions, and I will be answerable for the rest; and\r\nthese gentlemen who rely upon the fifty thousand (50,000) majority of\r\nlast November, will have a fearful waiting for of judgment. Fifty\r\nthousand majority! Who does not know how that majority was made up? It\r\nwas not a majority upon the question of slavery at all. It came in\r\nthis wise: The opposite party was divided and distracted. The\r\nRepublican party united all sorts of discordant elements; men voted\r\nfor Mr. LINCOLN from a great variety of motives. Some, because they\r\nwanted the Homestead law; some because they wanted a change in the\r\nTariff; and, gentlemen, let me assure you, there were more men who\r\nvoted for Mr. LINCOLN--solely on account of the Tariff--than would\r\nhave made up this fifty thousand majority. I know the people of New\r\nYork, and I know I can answer for them when I say, Give us these fair\r\nand noble propositions and we will accept them with an unanimity that\r\nwill gratefully surprise the nation.\r\n\r\nHow does the nation stand to-day? Look at Kansas! She is a State and\r\nyet in beggary. She is stretching out her hands to us for relief. We\r\nhave relieved her for the time, but she will need more aid again. The\r\nwhole country is excited and agitated. The press, North and South, is\r\nfull of misrepresentation and vituperation. Sections are arrayed\r\nagainst each other. Men fear to trust each other. The very air is full\r\nof anxiety and apprehension. Such, gentlemen, is the miserable\r\ncondition of the country. The nation is in great peril. Its interests,\r\nits institutions, its property, are all in great and common peril.\r\nParalysis has seized upon the whole country. In vain now shall we\r\nargue about causes. The effect is upon us. Business is stagnated.\r\nThose who have capital do not dare to move it. But we here must do\r\nsomething. Mr. LINCOLN is coming, and all along the route the people\r\nare doing him honor. But that triumphal march is insignificant\r\ncompared with the anxiety felt throughout the country that this\r\nConvention should agree upon some plan that will save the Government\r\nand the Union.\r\n\r\nIn one thing, under other circumstances, I would agree with the\r\ngentleman (Mr. BOUTWELL) from Massachusetts. Had the border States\r\nelected their members of Congress, I would wait. But the elections in\r\nthe border States are yet to be held. And upon what idea? Why, sir,\r\nupon the idea that their whole interests and their whole property are\r\nin danger. Aspiring and dangerous men will go before an excited people\r\nfull of anxiety and uncertainty for the future, and by them be elected\r\ninstead of the sound, wise, and conservative gentlemen usually\r\nselected to represent those States. Those elections would be a mad\r\nscene of aspersion and vituperation. I cannot, I will not trust them.\r\nRather give me in those States the glorious results of years gone by.\r\n\r\nI say, and I am proud to declare here, that I had no association with\r\nthe dominant party in the old Empire State at the last election. I\r\nstruck every other name from the ticket, except those who voted for\r\nBell and Everett. Glorious names! which received the triumphant\r\nendorsement of the mother of Presidents--the grand old commonwealth of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nSometimes I meet with men who tell me what is going to be done. They\r\ntalk of retaking forts now held by seceded States by force, of\r\nrestoring things to their former condition, as they would about\r\nsending a vessel for a cargo of oranges to Havana. But they forget\r\nthat the next administration, like the philosopher who would move the\r\nworld with a lever, has no holding spot--no place whereon to stand. It\r\nis one thing to hold a fort where you have it, but quite another thing\r\nto take it when held by the enemy.\r\n\r\nWho can magnify the importance of this Conference to all the nation?\r\nIt is the most important ever held in this country. It holds the key\r\nof peace or war. The eyes of the whole people are turned hopefully\r\nupon it. By every consideration that should move a patriot, let us\r\nagree. Let us act for the salvation of our common country. I came here\r\nvery unexpectedly to myself. Long withdrawn from political circles,\r\nliving in comparative retirement, at peace with the world and myself,\r\nI would have preferred to remain there; but when I heard of my\r\nappointment as a delegate to this Conference, I felt it my duty to\r\ncome here and say these few things to you.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me close by again assuring you, that if all you ask of New\r\nYork is the adoption of the propositions which I heard here yesterday\r\nas the propositions of a majority of your committee, New York will do\r\nyou justice. She will answer \"YES\" by a most triumphant majority--a\r\nmajority compared with which any heretofore given will seem\r\ninsignificant! I will occupy time no farther. There is much which I\r\nwould add, but this is a time for action and not for words.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--There are few members of this Conference who attend its\r\nsessions with greater interest than myself. I presume that we have\r\ncome together influenced by various considerations. There are some, I\r\nhave no doubt, who do not desire the preservation of the Union--who do\r\nnot care for the safety of the Government which our fathers founded.\r\nThey may not avow their purposes, they may even conceal them under\r\nspecious words, but their purpose will be disclosed when we see them\r\narrayed against all projects of settlement--all measures to quiet the\r\nexisting excitement. Others may think there is no necessity for any\r\naction at all, may think so honestly. But let me assure them they are\r\nmistaken--sadly mistaken.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not care what motives influence others. It is of no\r\nconsequence to me what their designs or purposes may be, I have no\r\nconcealment and no deception. I came here for a purpose which I openly\r\nand distinctly avow. I proclaim it here and everywhere. I will labor\r\nto carry it into execution with all the strength and ability which my\r\nadvanced years and enfeebled health have left me. _I came to maintain\r\nand preserve this glorious Government! I came here for Union and\r\npeace!_ (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMy health is such that if I could avoid it, I would not mingle in this\r\ndiscussion. I would not say one word, if I did not know perfectly well\r\nthat life or death to my part of the country was involved in the\r\naction of this Conference. If gentlemen felt as deeply as I do,\r\nthey would deprecate as I do the introduction of party or politics\r\ninto this discussion, or the slightest reference to them. Of what\r\nimportance is party, compared with the great questions involved here?\r\nParties or men may go up or down, and yet our country is safe. But\r\nsuch Conferences as this, in such emergencies as the present, must\r\nact, if our country is to be saved. Let us discard politics and\r\nparty--let us be brethren and friends.\r\n\r\nA gentlemen asked yesterday whether the Convention would have been\r\ncalled, if a Democrat had been elected President. Certainly not. But\r\nconsiderations of a party character would not have prevented it. The\r\ntrue necessity that called us here, is that a President has been\r\nelected by a large majority, and a new and strong party is coming into\r\npower, which our people believe entertain views and designs hostile to\r\nour institutions. Do not understand me as charging the fact upon the\r\nnew Government. Perhaps I might say that I do not believe it myself.\r\n\r\nBut that will not answer. Our people are agitated and excited, and we\r\nhave come here to tell you all, with sorrow in our hearts, that if you\r\nwill not do something to restore a confidence that is shaken, we are\r\nruined, and we must see this noble Government go down.\r\n\r\nWe ask you for new constitutional guarantees; and what are the\r\npropositions we make? Is there any thing in them which you cannot\r\ngrant? Is there any thing which it would be dishonorable for you to\r\nyield? You reply to us, that you will consent to call a convention to\r\ndiscuss and adjust matters. That will not do. We must act on the\r\nexisting state of facts. Seven States are already in rebellion--in\r\nrevolution! I don't care which you call it; either word is bad enough.\r\nTennessee and North Carolina already form fourteen hundred miles of\r\nwhat is virtually a frontier. We are now the border States; we are to\r\nbe the theatre of war, if it comes. The slave property we speak of\r\nwill be in still greater peril than it is now. Now think of these\r\nthings, and tell us whether we can wait for all this complicated\r\nmachinery of a convention to be put into operation. At the very\r\nshortest, it will take three or four years to accomplish any thing.\r\n\r\nBut my friend from Massachusetts says he does not wish to do any thing\r\nat all; that the North is under duress, and her people would despise\r\nthemselves if they acted under duress. No! no! This is not true in any\r\nsense. We respect the people of the North too much to attempt to drive\r\nthem, or to secure what we need by threats or intimidation. We want\r\nthe aid of the people of Massachusetts, and we will appeal to their\r\nsense of right and justice.\r\n\r\nI believe that these propositions, if adopted, will not only satisfy\r\nand quiet the loyal States of the South, but that they will bring back\r\nthe seven States which have gone out. I must be frank and outspoken\r\nhere. We cannot answer for these States. We cannot say whether they\r\nwill be satisfied. But we can even stand their absence. We can get on\r\nwithout them, if you will give us what will quiet our people, and what\r\nat the same time will not injure you.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we of North Carolina are not hostile to you; we are your\r\nfriends--brothers in a common cause--citizens of a common country. We\r\nare loyal to our country and to our Constitution. We lose both of\r\nthem, unless you will aid us now.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am an old man. My heart is very full when I look upon the\r\npresent unhappy and distracted condition of our affairs. I was born\r\nbefore the present Constitution was adopted. May God grant that I do\r\nnot outlive it. I cannot address you on this subject without\r\nmanifesting a feeling which fills my heart. Let me assure you, in\r\nterms as strong as I can make them, that we cannot stand as we are;\r\nthat unless you will do something for us, our people will be drawn\r\ninto that mad career of open defiance, which is now opening so widely\r\nagainst the Government. All I ask of you is to let these propositions\r\ngo to the people--to submit them at once to their conventions, and not\r\nwait the action of the Legislatures of all the States. We want the\r\npopular voice--the decision of the people, and the whole people; and\r\nif it is to avail us at all, we must have it at once and speedily.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--I did not design to trespass upon the time of the\r\nConference at this stage of the debate. But statements have been made\r\nupon this floor to-day which I cannot permit for a single hour to\r\nremain unanswered. I should be recreant to my conscience, and\r\nespecially to my State, if I did not answer them here and now.\r\n\r\nI came here for peace, prepared to do that justice to every section of\r\nthe Union which would secure peace--prepared to go to the farthest\r\nlimit which propriety and principle, and my obligations to the\r\nConstitution, would permit me, to satisfy our southern friends. I did\r\nnot wish to commit myself to any thing, until I had patiently seen and\r\nheard all that was to be said and proposed. Even now I regret that\r\nthis incidental discussion upon a subject entirely collateral has\r\narisen. How thoroughly it shows the idleness and folly of attempting\r\nto limit, or trammel, or hamper discussion upon the general questions\r\nwhich are presented for our action!\r\n\r\nSir, I speak for New York! Not New York of a time gone by! Not New\r\nYork of an old fossiliferous era, remembered only in some chapter of\r\nher ancient history, but young, breathing, living New York, as she\r\nexists to-day. Full of enterprise, patriotism, energy--her living\r\nself, with her four millions of people, among whom there is scarcely\r\nto be found a heart not beating with loyalty to the Constitution and\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of that New York, the one and only one alive now, I propose\r\nto reply to some of the statements made here by one of her\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the popular voice of that State, recently uttered in\r\ntones that I supposed any one could understand, I tell you, gentlemen\r\nof this Convention, beware of false prophets. _This day_, the\r\nScripture is fulfilled among you. [Pointing to Mr. GRANGER.] \"A\r\nprophet is not without honor save in his own country, and in his own\r\nhouse!\"\r\n\r\nNew York must stand upon this floor, and upon every other floor, as\r\nthe peer of every other State. Her representatives must have the same\r\nrights as any other--and they must be treated like any other. If, in\r\nher judgment, New York ought not to give her assent to these\r\npropositions, that assent shall not be given; it can never be secured\r\nby threats or intimidations. She must have the same rights as any\r\nother State, certainly the same rights as New Jersey.\r\n\r\nMr. STOCKTON:--I am sure the gentleman is mistaken; I said nothing\r\nintended as a threat or an intimidation.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--Well, let me say it once for all, New York will yield\r\nnothing to intimidation.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the question which has led to this most extraordinary\r\ndiscussion? It is simply whether debate shall be hampered, or\r\npractically cut off, by short limitations as to time, after one\r\nsection has had an opportunity of expressing its views.\r\n\r\nVirginia has called this Conference together. We thought she had no\r\nright to do so, and that no possible good could come from her doing\r\nit. But we waived all considerations of that kind, and upon her\r\ninvitation we came here.\r\n\r\nShe asks us to consider new and important amendments to the\r\nConstitution, alterations of our fundamental law; and in the same\r\nbreath we are told that we must not discuss them--that we must take\r\nthem as they are offered to us, without change or alteration.\r\n\r\nWe take time to make treaties. We do not even enter into private\r\ncontracts without taking time for consideration and reflection. We\r\nhave been here a little more than a week. The greater part of that\r\ntime has been occupied by the committee in preparing these\r\npropositions. The discussion has scarcely commenced. I submit to the\r\nConference, is it kind, is it generous, is it proper to stop here? Is\r\nit _best_ to do so?\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--The gentleman seems to think my resolution was aimed\r\nat the delegation from New York. That is not true in any sense. I did\r\nnot wish to cut off debate at all. I thought we might economize time\r\nand still have debate enough to satisfy everybody.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--I believe I perfectly understand your proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I have agreed to support the resolution, and must adhere\r\nto my agreement.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--Personally I might be in favor of the adoption of the\r\nhalf-hour rule, for I think I could say all I desire to say in\r\nrelation to these propositions within that time. I have certainly no\r\ndesire that this discussion should be unreasonably protracted. But\r\nsuch limitations are always embarrassing. Other gentlemen do not wish\r\nto have them imposed. Mr. FIELD objects to them; and if gentlemen\r\nreally think they need more time, I think it ungenerous not to yield\r\nto their wishes. And I insist that such a course is least calculated\r\nto promote conciliation. The more free and full you make this\r\ndiscussion, the more will your results find favor elsewhere. It has\r\nbeen my belief from the beginning, that by careful comparison of our\r\nviews, by a discussion of all our points of difference, we should, in\r\nthe end, come to an agreement. I had hoped that such sentiments would\r\nhave universally prevailed, and that no desire would be shown to force\r\nthe action of any delegation. I am willing to say for myself that if\r\nthe thirty minute rule be adopted I will give way at once.\r\n\r\nBut I must proceed to notice some statements which have been urged\r\nhere as reasons why we must adopt--\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Will my colleague yield to me for one moment? I have a\r\ncommunication to make which I think will make every lover of his\r\ncountry in this Conference rejoice. It is news from a slaveholding\r\nState. It shows that her heart beats true to the Union.\r\n\r\nMissouri has just elected delegates to a convention to consider the\r\nquestions now agitating the Country. I hold in my hands a telegram,\r\nstating that a very large proportion of the delegates elected are\r\n_true Union men_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I will assume it to be the pleasure of the Conference\r\nthat the telegram be read.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD then read the telegram announcing that Union delegates to\r\nthe Convention in Missouri had been elected by heavy majorities. The\r\nannouncement was received with much applause.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--This news is indeed cheering. It is an additional evidence\r\nof the depth to which love for our country has struck into the hearts\r\nof its people--another inducement to make us agree--another reason why\r\nwe should not be led off upon false issues.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has provided the only proper way in which amendments\r\nmay be made to it. If these methods are followed, amendments will be\r\nthoroughly discussed and considered, and they will not be adopted\r\nunless the interests of the nation shall be found to require their\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia seeks to precipitate action; to secure these\r\nvital changes in our fundamental law in a manner unknown to it, and in\r\na manner which, in my judgment, it is not advisable to adopt. I make\r\nno complaint of Virginia. It is the right and privilege of any State\r\nto make such a request, but it is none the less unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nShall we be told that Virginia cannot wait, that her people are so\r\nimpatient that they will not give the country time to consider these\r\nimportant changes in its form of Government? Why should there be such\r\nindecent haste? Why not wait a week--month, and even six months, if\r\nthat time is necessary? Be assured, gentlemen, that no substantial\r\nalteration of the fundamental law of this Government will ever be made\r\nuntil it has been discussed and considered by the Press and the people\r\nin all its details. The thing is impossible!\r\n\r\nI have a few words to say for New York, as I said in the\r\ncommencement--for the New York of the present day. Where, I ask, is\r\nthe gentleman's (Mr. GRANGER) warrant of attorney to speak for the\r\npeople of that State? Where is the evidence upon which he founds the\r\nassertion which he makes on this floor that New York will adopt the\r\npropositions to which he refers? Let me assure you, gentlemen, that\r\nthe political principles of the people of New York do not sit thus\r\nlightly upon their consciences. They gave a heavy republican majority\r\nat the last Presidential election, not because they were carried away\r\nupon collateral issues, but because the principles of the Chicago\r\nPlatform met their approval--because they thought the time had come\r\nwhen the destinies of this nation should no longer be left in the\r\nhands of men who would use them only to promote the interests of one\r\nsection of the Union. Do not mistake, sir, the effect of that great\r\ndemonstration! The people of New York were in earnest; they went into\r\nthe election with a strong, determined purpose, and it is too late now\r\nto misconstrue or misunderstand that purpose. They were not influenced\r\nby collateral issues. Their action was upon the great principles\r\ninvolved. They believed that the platform of the Republican party\r\nembodied the true principles upon which the Government should be\r\nconducted, and they said so. You will find that their minds are to-day\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman says, the result of recent elections shows that a\r\nchange in their minds has taken place; that it indicates a strong wish\r\non their part for conciliation and peace. Sir, I deny that such a\r\nchange has taken place. There may have been slight changes in a few\r\ncities where the whole power and strength of the Democratic party has\r\nbeen put forth. But the country, upon the great issues before it, is\r\nunchanged. The county of St. Lawrence has just elected every\r\nRepublican candidate for supervisor. In other counties, nearly the\r\nsame unanimity prevails. The great heart of the country is still loyal\r\nand Republican.\r\n\r\nAnd, sir, these threats of dissolution will all react against you.\r\nThey operated in the Presidential election only in one way. I have no\r\ndoubt that these threats gave Mr. LINCOLN five thousand votes in New\r\nYork City alone. The people are sick of them. They know that if they\r\nonce yielded to them, they would be forced to do so again. They do not\r\nlike these insinuations against the Government involved in the\r\npropositions made here. If you wish them to be considered favorably by\r\nthe people of New York, you must send them out free from all suspicion\r\nof duress or intimidation; you must permit them to be examined,\r\ndiscussed, and dissected here, by the representatives of New York and\r\nof every other State. I am opposed decidedly to cutting off or\r\nlimiting these discussions. Let all parties be heard; give them time,\r\nand time enough, to deliberate, and the result will be peace and\r\nharmony to the country.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--I rise for the purpose of answering some of the\r\nobservations of the gentleman from New York; and first of all I wish\r\nto say a word about the motives and purposes of Virginia in calling\r\nthis Convention. She has called this Convention together because she\r\nbelieved it would exert a powerful influence for the safety and honor\r\nof the country, and the perpetuity of its institutions. She is met _in\r\nlimine_ with the reproach that her action is unconstitutional. How\r\nunconstitutional?\r\n\r\nIs not our Government based upon the sovereignty of the people? Is not\r\nthat the idea upon which this Government rests? And when the people\r\nact, are they to be told that their action is unconstitutional or\r\nimproper? Cannot Virginia and her people, acting through their\r\nrepresentatives, suggest the means of amendment or improvement in our\r\nConstitution to Congress?--the Congress which represents the people,\r\nand whose members are servants only of the people? Can she not call\r\ntogether a convention of this kind and suggest measures to be\r\nconsidered by it for the purpose of saving an imperilled country?\r\nVirginia knew well that this was to be an advisory Conference merely.\r\nShe invited commissioners from all the States to come here and present\r\ntheir views, to compare and discuss them, to devise measures for the\r\nbenefit of the country, in the same way that any assemblage of the\r\npeople may lawfully do. Has the gentleman looked into the history of\r\nour present Constitution? Virginia did the same thing previous to the\r\nadoption of that Constitution, which she is doing now.\r\n\r\nSome State must invite a Conference, if one is to be had. If it was\r\nproper that Virginia should do it before the adoption of our present\r\nConstitution, it is eminently proper that she should do it now. There\r\nare occasions, sir, in the history of nations, when men should rise\r\nfar above the rules of special pleading. This is one of them. Let the\r\ngentleman look into the history of the old articles of Confederation;\r\nlet him read the debates which arose upon their adoption. Virginia\r\noriginated measures then, far more important than any before us now;\r\nand there were gentlemen then, who took the same ground that gentlemen\r\ndo now, who sought by the use of dilatory pleas, by interposing\r\nobjections, temporary in their nature, to prevent and delay action\r\nupon the great national questions then under consideration. Now, in a\r\ntime of great peril, when the whole country is convulsed, when the\r\nexistence and perpetuity of the Government is in danger, Virginia has\r\ninvoked her sister States to come here and see whether they cannot\r\ndevise some method to avoid the danger and save the country.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble to the first ten articles of Confederation, there is\r\nto be found an express reference to the action of the State\r\nLegislatures in initiating proposals of amendment. Every amendment\r\nthat has hitherto been made to our Constitution originated with the\r\npeople, and directly or indirectly through the action of State\r\nLegislatures. What purpose can gentlemen have in interposing these\r\ndilatory pleas, objections merely for delay, when we all know that\r\nCongress is now waiting for--actually inviting the action of this\r\nConference?\r\n\r\nSenator COLLAMER, in his speech already referred to, makes the\r\ndistinct proposition, that when any considerable portion of the people\r\n(certainly a much smaller portion than is here represented) desire to\r\nhave amendments submitted, it is the duty of Congress to propose them,\r\nand to do so without committing that body either for or against them.\r\nGovernor CORWIN, also of the Congressional Committee of Thirty-three,\r\nhaving this subject in charge, is understood to have stated that the\r\ncommittee desire to consider the propositions which may here be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nNow, as I said, these dilatory objections were interposed previous to\r\nthe adoption of our present Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--Are we to understand that Virginia then asked for a\r\nGeneral Convention to consider amendments to the Constitution?\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--No! The Annapolis Convention met. The invitation under\r\nwhich that body was convened was addressed to all the States. Five\r\nonly responded, and they proposed a General Convention of all the\r\nStates, to meet at Philadelphia. Virginia was the first to act and to\r\nappoint her delegates. I repeat, that the same objection was then\r\nurged, that Congress _or_ the States should propose the amendments.\r\nThe first Convention was just as unconstitutional as this. The two\r\ncases were perfectly alike. The crisis is infinitely more important\r\nnow than it was then. Then, there was no disintegration of the States.\r\nThey still held firmly together. How are we now? Seven States are out\r\nof the Union. _The Union is dissolved!_ Virginia loves the Union. She\r\ncherishes all its glorious memories. She is proud of its history and\r\nof her own connection with it. But Virginia has no apprehension as to\r\nher future destiny. She can live in the Union or out of it. She can\r\nstand in her own strength and power if necessary. Her delegates come\r\nhere in no spirit of supplication, nor do they propose to offer any\r\nintimidation. She has called you here as brothers, as friends, as\r\npatriots. If the future has suffering in store for Virginia, be\r\nassured all her sister States must suffer equally.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, the position of Virginia must be understood and\r\nappreciated. She is just now the neutral ground between two embattled\r\nlegions, between two angry, excited, and hostile portions of the\r\nUnion. To expect that her people are not to participate in the\r\nexcitement by which they are surrounded; to expect that they should\r\nnot share in the apprehensions which pervade the country; to expect\r\nthat they should not begin to look after the safety of their interests\r\nand their institutions, were to expect something superhuman. Something\r\nmust be done to save the country, to allay these apprehensions, to\r\nrestore a broken confidence. Virginia steps in to arrest the progress\r\nof the country on its road to ruin. She steps in to save the country.\r\nI am here in part to represent her. I utter no menace; intimidation\r\nwould be unworthy of Virginia, but if I perform my duty I must speak\r\nfreely. The danger is imminent, _very_ imminent.\r\n\r\nOur national affairs cannot longer remain in their present condition;\r\nit is impossible, absolutely impossible that they should. My\r\nRepublican friends, will you not take warning? Were there not\r\npretended prophets of old, who cried, \"Peace! Peace! when there was no\r\npeace\"? Political prophets to-day say there is no danger. Have their\r\ncounsels been wise heretofore? Can you not see that there is danger,\r\nand imminent danger in them, now?\r\n\r\nLook, sir, at our position! I mean the position of the loyal South. By\r\nthe secession of these States we are reduced to an utterly helpless\r\nminority; a minority of seven or eight States to stand in your\r\nnational councils against an united North! It is not in the nature of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race thus to stand in the face of a dominant and\r\nopposition party. Were the case reversed, you would not do it\r\nyourselves. We cannot hold our rights by mere sufferance, and we will\r\nnot; we do not ask you to hold yours in that way. If the other States\r\nhad kept on with us--had remained in the Union--we might have secured\r\nour rights in a fair contest. Now other paths are open to us, and one\r\nof these we must follow.\r\n\r\nI desire to say a word in answer to the propositions of my honorable\r\nfriend from Connecticut. What did he tell us? He said that this was a\r\nself-sustaining Government; a Government that possessed the power of\r\nsecuring its own perpetuity, and one that must not yield or make\r\nconcessions. Sir, let me say that ideas, that principles, that\r\nstatements of that kind have led to the downfall of every Government\r\non earth which has ever fallen. What but ideas and language of this\r\nkind, forced our colonies into rebellion, and lost America to the\r\nBritish crown?\r\n\r\nSir, I have had some experience in revolutions in another\r\nhemisphere--in revolutions produced by the same causes that are now\r\noperating among us. What causes but these led to the two revolutions\r\nin France? One of them I saw myself, where interest was arrayed\r\nagainst interest, friend against friend, brother against brother. I\r\nhave seen the pavements of Paris covered, and her gutters running with\r\nfraternal blood! God forbid that I should see this horrid picture\r\nrepeated in my own country; and yet it will be, sir, if we listen to\r\nthe counsels urged here!\r\n\r\nIt is too late to theorize, too late to differ theoretically. I do not\r\nbelieve in the constitutional right of secession. I proclaimed _that_,\r\nthirty years ago in Congress. I have always adhered to my opinions\r\nsince. But we are not now discussing theories; we are in the presence\r\nof a great fact. The South is in danger; her institutions are in\r\ndanger. If other excuses were necessary, she might justify her action\r\nin the eyes of the world upon the ground of self-defence alone.\r\n\r\nI condemn the secession of States. I am not here to justify it. I\r\ndetest it. But the great fact is still before us. Seven States have\r\ngone out from among us, and a President is actually inaugurated to\r\ngovern the new Confederation.\r\n\r\nWith this fact the nation must deal. Right or wrong, it exists. The\r\ncountry is divided. Wide dissensions exist. A people have separated\r\nfrom another people. Force will never bring them together. Coercion is\r\nnot a word to be used in this connection. There must be negotiation.\r\nVirginia presents herself as a mediator to bring back those who have\r\nleft us.\r\n\r\nThe border States are not in revolt; and by border States I mean\r\nStates on both sides of the border. They are here, and they came here\r\nto unite with you in measures that will reunite the country, and save\r\nit from irredeemable ruin.\r\n\r\nThere was one observation of the gentleman from Massachusetts that\r\nsurprised me. He complained of Virginia for thrusting herself between\r\nthe Republican party and its victory. It is not so.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUTWELL:--I said that Massachusetts thought her action had that\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--Let me say to you, Republican gentlemen, we wish to make\r\nyour victory worthy of you. We wish to inaugurate your power and your\r\nadministration over the _whole_ Union. We wish to give you a nation\r\nworth governing. Do us at least the justice of supposing we are in\r\nearnest in this. We are laboring to relieve you from the difficulties\r\nthat hang over you. War is impending. Do you wish to govern a country\r\nconvulsed by civil war? The country is divided. Do you wish to govern\r\na fraction of the country? Behold the difficulties that you must\r\nencounter. You cannot carry on your Government without money. Where is\r\nthe capitalist who will advance you money under existing\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, believe me, as one who has given no small amount of time\r\nand careful reflection to this subject, when I tell you that you\r\ncannot coerce sovereign States. It is impossible. Mr. HAMILTON'S great\r\nforesight made him assert that our strength lay in the Government of\r\nthe States--of the undivided States. Look at New York. She herself is\r\na match for the whole army of the United States. Look at the South.\r\nShe stands now almost upon an equality with you. You may spend\r\nmillions of treasure, you may shed oceans of blood, but you cannot\r\nconquer any five or seven States of this Union. The proposition is an\r\nutter absurdity. You must find some other way to deal with them. In\r\nthe wisdom of the country some other way must be found.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen have referred to our army and our navy. As a citizen\r\nof the United States, I am proud of both. I am proud of the country\r\nthey serve. I have enjoyed at times her honors, at others endured her\r\nchastisements. I respect the power which our army and our navy give\r\nto our nation, but our army and navy are impotent in such a crisis as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, even England herself has been shaken to her centre by\r\nrebellions in her North with which she has been forced to contend. In\r\nParis, too, I have myself seen regiment after regiment throw down\r\ntheir arms and rush into the arms of the people, of their\r\nfellow-citizens, and thus oppose, by military strength, the government\r\nunder which their organization was formed. Will you repeat such\r\noccurrences here? Will you 'destroy the imperishable renown of this\r\nnation'? No! I answer for you all--you will not. Now, we,\r\nrepresentatives of the South and of Virginia, ask of this Convention,\r\nthe only body under heaven that can do it, to interpose and save us\r\nfrom a repetition of the scenes of blood which some of us have\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nOur patriotic committee have labored for two weeks--have labored\r\nearnestly and zealously. Their report, though not satisfactory to\r\nVirginia in all respects, will yet receive her sanction, and the\r\nsanction of the border States. The representatives of Virginia know\r\nthey are yielding much, when they tell you that they will support\r\nthese propositions. We will do it because they will give peace to the\r\ncountry. Now, sir, when we are just in sight of land, when we are just\r\nentering a safe harbor, shall we turn about and circumnavigate the\r\nocean to find an unknown shore? No, sir! no! Let us enter the harbor\r\nof safety now opened before us.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I know Massachusetts well. She is a powerful\r\nCommonwealth. She has added largely to the wealth, the power, and\r\nglory of this Union. I respect the gentleman who has addressed this\r\nConvention in her behalf; but when he went out of his way and stated\r\nthat he abhorred slavery, the statement grated harshly on my ears. We\r\nof the South, we of Virginia, may not and do not like many of the\r\ninstitutions of Massachusetts, but we cannot and we will not say that\r\nwe abhor them.\r\n\r\nLet me recall to the gentleman from Massachusetts who has addressed\r\nus, a fact from history. Let me show him that his own State was\r\npowerful in colonial times in extending the time for the importation\r\nof slaves! Let me tell him that his State has helped to fasten the\r\ninstitution of slavery upon a portion of this nation. Is it for a son\r\nof Massachusetts now to complain of the result of the acts of his own\r\nState? Is it for him to use these reproaches, which, if not\r\nungrateful, are at least wanting in charity? It was a representative\r\nof Massachusetts, Mr. GORHAM, through whose motion and influence the\r\ntime for the importation of slaves was extended in that period of our\r\ncolonial history. Virginia ever, in every period of her colonial\r\nexistence, exerted herself to close her ports against the importation\r\nof slaves. It was the veto of her Royal Master alone that rendered her\r\nefforts nugatory. It was New England that fastened this institution\r\nupon us. Shall she reproach us for its existence now?\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--At the time of the adoption of our present Constitution,\r\nit was well understood that Georgia and South Carolina would not enter\r\nthe Union without slavery. The only question then was, should slavery\r\nhave an existence inside the Union or out of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--No, sir! The gentleman is mistaken. In the Constitution,\r\nas first proposed to the Convention, an unlimited right was given to\r\nimport slaves. Mr. ELLSWORTH declared that it would be an infraction\r\nof _State rights_ to prohibit this importation. New England, engaged\r\nin commerce, found an advantage in the right of importation, and she\r\nendeavored to force it upon the South.\r\n\r\nI regard the present course of New England as very unfair. She is\r\nherself responsible for the existence of slavery--she is now our\r\nfiercest opponent; and yet New Jersey and Pennsylvania, who have not\r\nthis responsibility, have always stood by the South, and I believe\r\nthey always will.\r\n\r\nIt is not by _abhorring_ slavery that you can put an end to the\r\ninstitution. You must let it alone. We are responsible for it now, and\r\nwe are willing to stand responsible for it before the world. We\r\nunderstand the subject better than you do. It has occupied the\r\nattention of the wisest men of our time. In fact, it is not a question\r\nof slavery at all. It is a question of race. We know that the very\r\nbest position for the African race to occupy is one of unmitigated\r\nlegal subjection. We have the negroes with us; you have not. We must\r\ndeal with them as our experience and wisdom dictate; with that you\r\nhave nothing to do. The gentleman from Massachusetts may congratulate\r\nhimself that there are no negroes in that Commonwealth. I ask him what\r\nhe would do, if he had the race to deal with in Massachusetts as we\r\nhave it in Virginia?\r\n\r\nI said, twenty years ago, in the Senate of the United States, and my\r\nwhole experience since having confirmed the truth of the statement I\r\nrepeat it now, that candid minds cannot differ upon this proposition,\r\nthat the present position of the negroes of the United States is the\r\nbest one they could occupy, both for the superior and inferior race.\r\n\r\nAnd to the people of New England I have this to say: Your ancestors\r\nwere most powerful and influential in fastening slavery upon us. You\r\nare the very last who ought to reproach us for its existence now. We\r\ndo not indulge reproaches toward you. It is unpleasant for us to\r\nreceive them from you. Their use by either can only serve to widen the\r\nunhappy differences existing between us. Let us all drop them, and, so\r\nfar as we can, let us close up every avenue through which dissensions\r\nmay come. We call upon you to make no sacrifices for us. It will cost\r\nyou nothing to yield what we ask. Say, and let it be said in the\r\nConstitution, that you will not interfere with slavery in the\r\nDistrict, or in the States, or in the Territories. Permit the free\r\ntransit of our slaves from one State to another, and in the language\r\nof the patriarch, \"let there be peace between you and me.\"\r\n\r\nLet us all agree that there shall be landmarks between us; the same\r\nwhich our fathers erected. Let us say that they shall never be\r\nremoved. I think upon this point I can cite an authority that will\r\ncommand universal respect. I discovered it in my researches into the\r\nhistory of the very Constitution we are now considering.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES here read an extract from a letter written by Mr. MADISON\r\nafter his retirement from public life. I have not a copy of this\r\nletter, but the substance of the portion read by Mr. RIVES was a\r\nstatement by Mr. MADISON, that upon the passage of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, President MONROE was much embarrassed with the question of\r\nthe constitutionality of the prohibition clause; that he took counsel\r\nwith Mr. MARTIN, who declared that, in his judgment, Congress had no\r\npower over the subject of slavery in the territories.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--Will you leave that question just where the Constitution\r\nleaves it, upon your construction of that instrument? If so, we will\r\nagree to give you all necessary guarantees against interference.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--No! I will not leave it there, for it would always remain\r\na question of construction. I prefer to put the prohibition into the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Massachusetts speaks for the North. Massachusetts\r\ndoes not constitute the North. I venerate the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts. I have many friends there. I look with pride upon her\r\nconnection with the Revolution; upon her public men, her manufactures,\r\nher public institutions. Her people who have accomplished so much,\r\nwill not turn a deaf ear to our wants now. We wish to go to her people\r\nand obtain their judgment upon our propositions. But Massachusetts is\r\nnot all the North. Rhode Island constitutes a part of it. She has\r\nalways spoken for us. She will speak for us to-day. What does New\r\nJersey say? What does the great State of Pennsylvania and the greater\r\nNorthwest say? Surely they do not echo the sentiments of the gentleman\r\nfrom Massachusetts. They are with us, and we will trust to them.\r\n\r\nI dislike this way of answering for sections of the country. I have\r\nheard similar language from Mr. CALHOUN. He was fond of saying, \"The\r\nSouth says--The South thinks--The South will do,\" this or that. I did\r\nnot like it then. It stirred up all the rebellious sentiments of my\r\nnature; for I knew the statement was not true. I do not like such\r\nlanguage better now. Let the _people_ of Massachusetts speak. I know\r\nthey will not refuse to fulfil the compact of their fathers.\r\n\r\nWe are brothers. I feel we can settle this important question which\r\nportends over us like an eclipse; we can leave this glorious country\r\nto our posterity. Once more let me refer to the noble and eloquent\r\ncounsels of MADISON, and I am done. As children of the same family, as\r\nfellow-citizens of a great, glorious, and proud Republic, he invoked\r\nthe kindred blood of our people to consecrate our common Union, and to\r\nbanish forever the thought of our becoming aliens.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I have never in any manner countenanced the discussions of\r\nslavery and the questions connected with it, at the North. I have\r\nalways, so far as possible, discouraged those discussions. No good can\r\npossibly come from them. Is the North the _censor morum_ of the\r\nSouth? We have faults enough ourselves; let us consider and try to\r\ncorrect them, before we interest ourselves so much in those of our\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nIf there was any danger that slavery would be extended at the North, I\r\nwould oppose its extension there, and I would teach my sons to oppose\r\nit. But this danger has never existed. Does any one fear that slavery\r\nwill go into New York or Massachusetts? No sane man thinks or ever\r\nthought so.\r\n\r\nBut it exists, and we must deal with it as it is. As one northern man,\r\nI do not want the negroes distributed throughout the North. We have\r\ngot enough of them now. I have watched the operation of this\r\nemigration of slaves to the North. Ten negroes will commit more petty\r\nthefts than one thousand white men. We cannot permit them to come into\r\nOhio. Wherever they have been permitted to come, it has almost cost us\r\na rebellion. Before we begin to preach abolition I think we had better\r\nsee what is to be done with the negroes.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago the subject of abolishing slavery was agitated in\r\nVirginia. Some of the most eloquent speeches were made in favor of the\r\nabolition movement that I ever read. The act providing for gradual\r\nabolition, was, I believe, lost by a single vote. I thought then that\r\nthe result was an unfortunate one. But there is something to be said\r\non both sides of the question. Had the act passed, the negroes would\r\nhave been sent South, and we should have had plantation slavery,\r\ninstead of the humane form which now exists in Virginia. But Virginia\r\nwould have had one great, one powerful advantage. Her power would have\r\nincreased tenfold. Free labor would have come in to take the place of\r\nslave labor, and the banks of the Potomac and the James would have\r\nblossomed as the rose.\r\n\r\nThe North has taken the business of abolition into its own hands, and\r\nfrom the day she did so, we hear no more of abolition in Virginia.\r\nThis was but the natural effect of the cause. Now, we can never coerce\r\nthe Southern States into abolitionism. It is not the way to convert\r\nthem to our views by saying that we _abhor_ their institutions. But\r\nthese northern men will not listen to reason. They keep on making\r\neloquent speeches--their pulpits thunder against the sin of\r\nslaveholding. All grades of speech and thought are made use of, and\r\nthe sickening sentimentalism of some of them is disgusting. They\r\nrepeat poetry. They say:\r\n\r\n     \"I would not have a slave to till my ground,\r\n     To watch me when I wake--to fan me when I sleep;\"\r\n\r\nand much more of the same stuff!\r\n\r\nIn this way false ideas are inculcated throughout the North. The whole\r\nscheme is full of falsehood. It would be far better for each man to\r\nlook for the beam in his own eyes before he troubles himself about the\r\nmote in his neighbor's.\r\n\r\nEngland, also, has been very fierce in denouncing slavery in this\r\ncountry, and yet we have no slavery or misery to be compared with that\r\nexisting in the India provinces. It is said that in a single season\r\ntwo hundred thousand of her subjects were starved to death in one\r\nprovince of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nI might say the same thing almost of Ireland. Two millions have died\r\nthere from famine, and God knows how many more would have perished but\r\nfor the relief sent from this country. I say, and I have abundant\r\nreason for saying, that I never have, and I never will, favor any of\r\nthese denunciations of southern slaveholders and slavery.\r\n\r\nLet us rather look at this subject as members of a common family--let\r\nus acknowledge our mutual faults. The slave trade was once fostered by\r\nthe North. That was when it was profitable, and when large fortunes\r\nwere made in that trade by northern men. When it became unprofitable\r\nthe North began to denounce it, and to call it sinful. Now, we\r\nfastened this institution upon the South, cannot we permit her to deal\r\nwith it as she chooses?\r\n\r\nI do not say that there is a necessary conflict between the white and\r\nthe black races, but I assert that they cannot unite--that they cannot\r\noccupy the same country upon an equality. Our free laborers of the\r\nNorth will not work with slaves or with blacks. I have had experience\r\nin this matter, and I know I am right. The only way we can do, is to\r\ndivide the common territory--divide it fairly, honestly.\r\n\r\nSuppose there were two sons who succeeded to a joint inheritance of\r\nlands. One says to the other, \"Your family is not so moral as mine,\r\ntherefore your sons shall have none of the lands.\" Would this be right\r\nor honest? Would any one attempt to justify it? And yet this is what\r\nextreme men of the North are practically saying to the citizens of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Compromise was intended to settle the rights of the\r\nrespective sections in the territories. The line adopted was not\r\nunfair to the North. The same line will answer now. I am for adopting\r\nit and arranging this difficult subject finally.\r\n\r\nBut one and another says, \"Don't let us extend slavery.\" To that I\r\nanswer, that our action will not make one slave more or less. There is\r\nno question of humanity involved in our propositions. I cannot see\r\nwhat question is involved so far as the North is concerned. We need no\r\nmore territory. We do not want New Mexico. We have territory enough\r\nnow for one hundred and fifty millions of people, and enough for the\r\nexpansion of our people for one hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nIf gentlemen are found here who wish to make trouble, who cannot see\r\nthe peril we are in, and how easily we can avoid the danger which\r\nthreatens us, I shall be much pained, but not half so much as I shall\r\nbe, to see this Union broken up and the Government destroyed.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to hear the assertion of the gentleman from\r\nConnecticut, that this was an unconstitutional assembly. I hear to-day\r\nthe statement made that it is a revolutionary assembly. If these\r\nassertions were true I would not be a member of it for one moment. If\r\nrevolutionary, it is either treasonable or seditious. But it is\r\nneither. These gentlemen forget the constitutional right of petition.\r\nWe have the right to meet here. We have the right to do just what we\r\nare proposing to do, and the right is to be found in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI am surprised, too, at the assertion, that there is a wish here to\r\nlimit or cut off debate--that this resolution would cut off New York.\r\nWould it not cut off Ohio? I have no intention of depriving any\r\ngentleman or any State of any right. I do not believe such an\r\nintention exists in the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL:--In my judgment many subjects have been considered here,\r\nand many things said to the North especially, that are superfluous,\r\nand much more that is useless. I have listened to the gentleman from\r\nOhio and to some gentlemen who have preceded him. They have all\r\nreferred, in terms which I do not choose to characterize, to the\r\naction and the opinions of the North.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Ohio refers in strong terms to what he calls the\r\nsentimentalism of the North. He has recited poetry which he says is\r\npopular there.\r\n\r\nNow, once for all, let me ask those gentlemen who are proposing\r\nvarious methods of settling our differences: Do you propose to make\r\nwar upon the _sentiments_, the _principles_ of the North? If you do,\r\nwe may as well drop the discussion here. Our people, and we, their\r\nrepresentatives, cannot meet you upon that ground. Our principles\r\ncannot be interfered with; we carry them with us always. Our\r\nconsciences approve them. We can negotiate with you, and treat with\r\nyou upon subjects which do not involve their sacrifice. If it is your\r\npurpose to attack them, you may abandon all other purposes so far as\r\nthis body is concerned. The people of the North will never sacrifice\r\ntheir principles. It is useless for you to ask them to do so. It is\r\nentirely useless for you to urge war upon the sentiments or opinions\r\nof the North.\r\n\r\nAgain; let me tell you there is no disloyalty in the free States. The\r\nword dissolution has not been thought of there during the last half\r\ncentury. In all your discussions, in all your action, remember that we\r\nare loyal to the Constitution and the Union.\r\n\r\nStrong appeals are made here to the free States. You call them by the\r\ngeneral name of the Northern States. Gentlemen undertake to pledge\r\ndifferent sections to this or that policy. We are told that New\r\nYork--that Massachusetts--that Pennsylvania will adopt or will not\r\nadopt various propositions that are made here.\r\n\r\nSir, in my judgment all such questions are unworthy of our\r\nconsideration. We spend time to little purpose upon them. The true\r\nquestion here is, \"What will Virginia do? How does Virginia stand?\"\r\nShe to-day holds the keys of peace or war. She stands in the gateway\r\nthreatening the progress of the Government in its attempts to assert\r\nits legal authority. Evade it as you may--cover it as you will--the\r\ntrue question is, \"What will Virginia do?\" She undertakes to dictate\r\nthe terms upon which the Union is to be preserved. What will satisfy\r\nher?\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--Has not Virginia spoken? Has she not already told us what\r\nshe wants?\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL:--I am coming to that point very soon. I assert again that\r\nVirginia must not be misunderstood in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe peril of the time is _Secession_. Six States are already in\r\nrevolution. A distinct confederacy, a new government, has been\r\norganized within the limits of the United States.\r\n\r\nDoes Virginia to-day, frown upon this atrocious proceeding? No! so far\r\nfrom that she affirms that these States have a right to do what they\r\nhave done. She boasts that she has armed her people, that she has\r\nraised five millions of money, and that she will use both to prevent\r\nthe interference of the National Government with these States, now in\r\nrevolution. Whether her course will conciliate the free\r\nStates--whether under such circumstances the free States will\r\nnegotiate with Virginia or others in her position, I leave for others\r\nto consider. It is my opinion that the people of this country will\r\nfirst of all _demand the recognition of the supremacy of the\r\nGovernment_.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--No! I do not understand such to be the position of\r\nVirginia. She appeals to both sides to refrain from violence while\r\nthese negotiations are pending.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--No! A little farther than that. Virginia _will not permit\r\ncoercion_. She has plainly declared she will not. But in the very\r\nhighest spirit of patriotism, she has asked for this Convention, and\r\nshe proposes to exhaust the very last means of restoring peace to the\r\nUnion. This is exactly her position. She hopes, and I hope, that this\r\nConvention will interpose to preserve the peace and to save this\r\ncountry from war.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL:--I thought I did not misunderstand the position of\r\nVirginia. She is armed to the teeth, and she now proposes to step in\r\nbetween the Government and the States. I understand her attitude. It\r\nis an attitude of menace. It gives aid and comfort to those who\r\ntrample upon the laws and defy the authority of this Government.\r\n\r\nNo action of the Conference can be consummated for months: I might\r\nalmost say for years. Any propositions we may make must go to the\r\npeople. They must and will take time for consideration. Endeavor to\r\nforce their action and you will secure the rejection of the terms\r\nproposed. While the people are acting you will have a Government and\r\nit must operate. It must operate not upon a section only, but upon the\r\nwhole country. During this time, does Virginia propose to maintain the\r\nposition she has assumed? To prevent by force of arms the execution of\r\nthe laws of the Union in the seceded States? Yes, and we are told that\r\nher position is one exhibiting the highest patriotism. In my judgment\r\nher position is one of menace, and not of pacification. If I rightly\r\nunderstand her, nothing that is here proposed to be done will satisfy\r\nher even if adopted.\r\n\r\nAnd now I wish to ask the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SEDDON) a plain\r\nquestion, and I wish to receive a frank answer. If this Conference\r\nagrees to the amendments proposed by the majority of the committee,\r\nwill Virginia sustain the Government and maintain its integrity, while\r\nthe people are considering and acting on the new proposals of\r\namendment to the Constitution? If she will not do this, if this\r\nproposition does not meet the heart of Virginia, there is no use--\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I can let Virginia speak for herself. She has spoken for\r\nherself in most emphatic language. She has told you what will satisfy\r\nher in the resolutions under which this body is convened. I have no\r\nright whatever to suppose that she will accept less. She is solemnly\r\npledged to resist coercion. She will resist it to the very last\r\nextremity. She arrived at that conclusion after grave deliberation,\r\nand it was attended with every manifestation of concurrence on the\r\npart of the people. I have no reason to suppose there was any\r\nhesitation at the time, or that there has been any change since, or\r\nthat there is any hesitation in her purpose now.\r\n\r\nNow, if the gentleman wants my private opinion, I will tell him that\r\nwhether the propositions of the majority of the committee or her own\r\nbe adopted here, or by the people, the purpose of Virginia to resist\r\ncoercion is _unchanged_ and _unchangeable_.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I rise to a point of order. It appears to me that this\r\ndiscussion is very foreign to the subject before the Conference. It is\r\nso long since that subject has been named, that many have doubtless\r\nforgotten it. The question is upon the adoption of the resolution\r\nlimiting the debate. I think we had better keep to the question.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The gentleman is undoubtedly correct in his statement\r\nof the question, but the discussion of the general subject has been\r\npermitted to go on without objection by the Convention, and I do not\r\nthink it would be right to stop it now.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I said the position of Virginia was unchanged. She\r\nconsiders this a Government of love and not of force. She thinks there\r\nshould be no force or coercion used toward any sovereign State acting\r\nin its collective capacity. She does not propose to permit such\r\ncoercion to be used.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having answered the gentleman frankly, as he desired, I wish\r\nto ask him a question, and I wish also an explicit and frank answer.\r\nMy question is this: Is it the purpose or is it the policy of the\r\nincoming administration to attempt to execute the laws of the United\r\nStates in the seceded States by an armed force? The answer to this\r\nquestion involves information of the utmost importance to my State and\r\nothers whose interests are involved with hers. It should be at once\r\ncommunicated, and especially to my part of the country. I now ask the\r\ngentleman, if he knows what the purpose of the incoming administration\r\nis in this respect, to state it here, and now. His relations to some\r\nof the officers elected will entitle his opinions to grave\r\nconsideration. I invite a full and frank answer to my question.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL:--There is a point in the gentleman's answer which may as\r\nwell be met, but I will not be diverted from the question I was\r\ndiscussing. I will show him in a moment why I cannot answer his\r\ninquiry from any personal knowledge of my own.\r\n\r\nSir, I was endeavoring to ascertain what was the present position of\r\nVirginia; to find out what she would accept and be contented. I wanted\r\nher to speak emphatically. She has done so. I now understand from Mr.\r\nSEDDON, that he has no assurances to give that Virginia will accept\r\nthe propositions of the committee, and that while any propositions are\r\npending she will resist the enforcement of the laws in the seceded\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThen let it be understood that Virginia _has_ spoken. That she makes\r\nthe Crittenden resolutions her _ultimatum_, that she must have them\r\nand all of them, that nothing less will satisfy her. As I said at the\r\nbeginning of my remarks, it is idle for us to stay here, useless for\r\nus to discuss the various propositions which are made here, unless we\r\nexpect to satisfy Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt is important for us to understand her position. I do not\r\nunder-estimate her influence. When the propositions of this Conference\r\nare presented to the people of the free States, the first question\r\nthey will ask is, \"Will Virginia adopt them? Will she be satisfied\r\nwith them?\" If she will not, there will be no action upon them. If she\r\nwill, her position will exercise a powerful influence upon the people\r\nof the North in favor of their adoption.\r\n\r\nBut if Virginia puts her ancient Commonwealth across the path of the\r\nGovernment, if she stands between the administration and the\r\nenforcement of the laws, the execution of its official duty, its\r\npositive obligations--if this is the manner in which she proposes to\r\nmediate, her mediation will be accepted nowhere. Such I understand to\r\nbe the position she assumes. It is a position of menace.\r\n\r\nMr. STOCKTON:--If the gentleman from Maine wants to get up a row, we\r\nare ready for him. He shall have enough of it right here! I should\r\nlike to know why he makes such charges against Virginia? They are\r\nunfounded; we don't wish to hear them.\r\n\r\n(There was at this point considerable confusion in the Conference,\r\nwhich was promptly suppressed by the PRESIDENT.)\r\n\r\nMr. MORRILL:--Gentlemen need not be disturbed or excited. I have\r\naccomplished my object. I know now what to expect from Virginia; the\r\nNorth will know what the course of Virginia is to be, and we can all\r\nact understandingly. I do not propose to waste valuable time in idle\r\ndiscussions in this hall, when we can come to the true point at once.\r\nI do not propose to talk around this question, nor to deceive or\r\nmislead the Conference. Other gentlemen may think differently, but I\r\nnow understand Virginia to say, that the Federal authority shall not\r\nbe reëstablished by the ordinary means, (where it is resisted) in\r\ncertain of the States comprised in the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nI will now answer the question of the gentleman from Virginia, in\r\nrelation to the proposed policy of the incoming administration. I have\r\nno personal knowledge upon this subject. Mr. LINCOLN I never saw in my\r\nlife. I know nothing of his opinions, except from his speeches; but I\r\nwill say, that if he and his administration do not use every means\r\nwhich the Constitution has given them to assert the authority of the\r\nGovernment in all the States--to preserve the Union, and the Union in\r\nall its integrity, the people will be disappointed. I have felt and\r\nnow feel the importance of the action of Virginia, and I have done\r\nwhat I could to learn here what we may expect from her.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me say, that unless we can have the earnest\r\nconcurrence of the slave States in whatever we do, and especially\r\nunless we have the heart of Virginia with us, our action will give no\r\npeace to the country.\r\n\r\nMr. ZOLLICOFFER moved that the Conference adjourn. The motion was lost\r\nby a _viva voce_ vote.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWNE:--I think we have debated these matters long enough. Let us\r\ncome back to the question before us. Personally I am in favor of\r\nlimiting debate to the shortest time, for I feel the necessity for\r\nprompt action. I think if Mr. RANDOLPH would strike out the latter\r\nclause of his resolution, requiring the final vote to be taken on\r\nThursday next, we should have no difficulty in agreeing to it. Its\r\nadoption in its present form might cut off some delegation or some\r\ngentlemen from speaking at all. I would not do this. Let every one\r\nspeak, but let the speeches be short. I move to strike out the last\r\nclause of the resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I did not expect to raise such a storm by introducing\r\nthis resolution. I now ask to withdraw it and stop the debate.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--The gentleman cannot do that, as\r\nseveral motions are involved. I object to his proposal to withdraw the\r\nresolution. I move to lay the whole subject on the table, and to make\r\nit the special order for ten o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was carried.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I move that when the present session of the Conference\r\nadjourn, its next meeting be at seven o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER:--Say eight o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--Well, then, let it be eight o'clock. But let me ask you,\r\ngentlemen, not to protract or unnecessarily delay our action here.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, my heart is full! I cannot approach the great issues\r\nwith which we are dealing with becoming coolness and deliberation!\r\nSir, I love this Union. The man does not live who entertains a higher\r\nrespect for this Government than I do. I know its history--I know how\r\nit was established. There is not an incident in its history that is\r\nnot precious to me. I do not wish to survive its dissolution. My hand\r\nor voice was never raised against it. They never will be. The Union is\r\nas dear to me as to any living man; and it would be pleasant, indeed,\r\nif my mind to-day could be as free from fear and anxiety about it, as\r\nthe minds of other gentlemen appear to be. But, Sir, I cannot shut my\r\neyes to events which are daily transpiring among a people who are\r\nexcited and anxious, who are apprehensive that their rights are in\r\ndanger--who are solicitous for--who will do as much to preserve their\r\nrights as any people. They must be calmed and quieted. It is useless\r\nnow to tell them they have no cause for fear. They are looking to this\r\nConference. This Conference must act. If it does not, I almost fear to\r\ncontemplate the prospect that will open before us.\r\n\r\nSir! this Conference has now been in session fifteen days. While I\r\nhave felt reluctant to do any thing which should have the appearance\r\nof precipitating our action, of cutting off or limiting debate, I have\r\nall the time been pressed with this conviction; that if we are to save\r\nthis country we must act speedily. I have been in constant\r\ncommunication with the people of Virginia since I have been here. I\r\nknow that this feeling of apprehension which existed when I came away,\r\nhas been constantly increasing in my State since; and even last night\r\nI received letters from members of the Convention now in session in\r\nRichmond; gentlemen who are as true to this Union as the needle to the\r\npole, informing me that every hour of _delay_ in this Conference was\r\nan hour of _danger_.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with some of my colleagues in their construction of the\r\nresolutions of the Virginia Legislature inviting this Conference. I\r\nunderstand that she suggests the resolutions of Mr. CRITTENDEN as\r\n_one_ acceptable way of settling our present difficulties. She says\r\nthat she will be satisfied with a settlement on the basis of those\r\nresolutions. But she has not made them her _ultimatum_. She has not\r\nsaid she will not consent to any other plan of arrangement. Her\r\npurpose was not to draw up certain articles of pacification; to call\r\nher sister States together, and say to them, \"These or nothing! We\r\nhave dictated the terms upon which the matter between us may be\r\narranged. We will have these or we will not arrange at all!\" I\r\nunderstand her as offering no restrictions whatever. She invites a\r\nconference--she asks the States to _confer_ together. She expects\r\nreasonable concessions, reasonable guarantees, and with these she will\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n\r\nNor do I know why the gentleman from Maine places Virginia in the\r\nposition he described, nor upon what authority. I reply to him that he\r\nmakes a grave assumption when he attributes to Virginia a dictatorial\r\nposition. I have come here, and I trust my colleagues have also,\r\nanimated by a single purpose:--that purpose is to save the Union.\r\nVirginia claims no greater rights than any other State. She would not\r\ntake them if they were offered.\r\n\r\nLet me say here, that it is my purpose to carry out the wishes of the\r\npeople of Virginia; that exercising the best judgment I have I shall\r\ntry to ascertain what that purpose is, and shall do all I can to\r\naccomplish it. When the proper time comes I shall cast my vote for the\r\nproposals of amendment offered by my colleague (Mr. SEDDON); I shall\r\ndo so for several reasons. The first and most important of them all is\r\nthis: The Union is our inheritance--it is our pride. To preserve it,\r\nwhat sacrifice should we not make? Its preservation is the one single\r\ndesire that animates me. Can I not be understood by my Northern\r\nfriends? Will you not yield something to our necessities--to our\r\ncondition? Will you not do something which will enable us to go back\r\nto our excited people and say to them, \"The North is treating us\r\nfairly. See what she will do to make our Union perpetual!\"\r\n\r\nAgain; I shall vote cheerfully for Mr. SEDDON'S propositions, because\r\nthe Legislature of my State has said that such amendments will satisfy\r\nthe people of Virginia. I think the Legislature is right. I think in\r\nthis respect it reflects the will of the people of Virginia. Remember,\r\nsir, that these propositions have been for some time before the\r\ncountry, that they have been discussed and commented upon by the\r\npublic Press--that they will probably settle our difficulties, now and\r\nforever. They were introduced into Congress by a distinguished and an\r\nable man--a statesman, whose integrity and fidelity no one has ever\r\nquestioned, and no one will question. It is my firm belief that the\r\nStates can adopt them without any material sacrifice, and that they\r\nwill adopt them if they have the opportunity.\r\n\r\nBut if the CRITTENDEN resolutions--if the propositions of my colleague\r\ncannot be recommended by this Conference--do not find favor with the\r\nmajority here? What then? Shall we dissolve this body, and go home?\r\nShall we risk all the fearful consequences which must follow? No, sir!\r\nNo! We came here for _peace_. Virginia came here for _peace_. We will\r\nnot be impracticable. You, representatives of the free States, will\r\nnot be impracticable. Therefore, I tell you that it is my firm belief\r\nthat the people of Virginia WILL accept the proposals of amendment to\r\nthe Constitution as reported by the majority of the committee. I\r\nbelieve these propositions would be acceptable to our people. I\r\nbelieve if we should pass them here, that the Convention now in\r\nsession in Richmond would at once adopt them and recommend them to the\r\npeople of that honored member of the Federal Union. Can you not? Will\r\nyou not give us one chance to satisfy our people, and to save us from\r\nthat other alternative which I almost fear to contemplate?\r\n\r\nI feared when the result was announced, that the late election in\r\nVirginia of the delegates to the Convention now in session, would be\r\nmisapprehended and misunderstood at the North: that the North would\r\nregard it as a triumph of the Union sentiment in Virginia. In one\r\nsense it was such a triumph. The advocates of immediate and\r\nunconditional secession were defeated, were defeated by a heavy\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nBut the members comprising that Convention represent the true feeling\r\nof the people who elected them, and they represent the present feeling\r\nof Virginia. The people of that State are full of anxiety. They fear\r\nthat the new administration has designs which it will carry into\r\nexecution, fatal to their rights and interests. They are for the\r\nUnion, _provided_ their rights can be secured; provided, they can have\r\nproper and honorable guarantees. It is useless to discuss now whether\r\nthey are right or wrong. Such is the condition of affairs now, and it\r\nis too late to enter into the causes which produced it. We must deal\r\nwith things as they are.\r\n\r\nI have known many gentlemen who have represented the interests of New\r\nEngland long and well. I know what sentiments filled their hearts\r\nyears ago, and I do not believe those sentiments are changed now. I\r\nappeal to Vermont. Among her representatives here, I see a gentleman\r\nwith whom, for a long time, I was upon terms of peculiar intimacy. In\r\nthe whole course of that intimacy I cannot recall a single occurrence\r\nwhich did not impress me with his integrity, his ability, his justice.\r\nI appeal to him. I appeal to him by every consideration which can move\r\na friend, which can influence a patriot, which can govern the action\r\nof a statesman. I appeal to Massachusetts, to all New England, which I\r\nknow possesses many like himself; and I ask you to consider our\r\ncircumstances, to consider our dangers, and not to refuse us the\r\nlittle boon we ask, when the consequences of that refusal must be so\r\nawful. Can you not afford to make a little sacrifice, when we make one\r\nso great? Can you not yield to us what is a mere matter of opinion\r\nwith you, but what is so vital with us? Will you not put us in a\r\nposition where we can stand with our people, and let us and you stand\r\ntogether in the Union? I have no delicacy here. The importance of our\r\naction with me, transcends all other considerations. I do not hesitate\r\nto appeal to New England for help in this crisis.\r\n\r\nIf New England refuses to come to our aid, it will not alter my course\r\nor change my conviction. In no possible contingency which can now be\r\nforeseen shall these convictions be changed. _I will never give up the\r\nUnion!_ Clouds may hang over it, storms and tempest may assail it, the\r\nwaves of dissolution may dash against it, but so far as my feeble hand\r\ncan support it, that support shall be given to it while I live!\r\n\r\nWhen the dark days come over this Republic, and there is nothing in\r\nthe future but gloom and despondency, I will do as WASHINGTON once\r\nsaid he would do in similar circumstances: I will gather the last\r\nhandful of faithful men, carry them to the mountains of Western\r\nVirginia, and there set up the flag of the Union. It shall be defended\r\nthere against all assailants until the friends of freedom and liberty\r\nfrom all parts of the civilized world shall rally around it, and\r\nagain establish it in triumph and glory over every portion of a\r\nrestored and united country.\r\n\r\nSir, the questions which now agitate and alarm the country do not\r\naffect the interests of all sections of the Union, or if they do\r\naffect all sections, certainly not in the same proportion. The farther\r\nsections are removed from each other, the less do the interests and\r\nthe principles of their people assimilate. Maine and Louisiana, far\r\ndistant from each other, differ widely. Approaching the line between\r\nthe slave and free States all these differences grow less. This is\r\nshown by the action of this Conference. The border States can settle\r\nthese questions. They will settle them if you will let them alone.\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey, States along the\r\nline, whose people are most vitally interested, can have no difficulty\r\nin coming to an agreement. With all the possible political interests\r\nwhich you may have, not only are the relations of society, of\r\nbusiness, and commerce, to be interrupted, but these States are to\r\nform the long frontier between two foreign nations, if that fearful\r\ncontingency is to happen, so often and so confidently referred to\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, should remote sections interfere to prevent this\r\nadjustment? If they cannot aid us, why not let us alone? Let them look\r\nalong the valley of the Ohio River, one of the most fertile sections\r\nof the continent, in itself great enough and fruitful enough to\r\nsupport a nation. It has already a large population, and that\r\npopulation is increasing every day. The people are attached to each\r\nother by every tie that binds society together. They now live in\r\nharmony and friendship; their property is secure. They are prosperous\r\nand happy. Such a people _cannot be, must not be divided_.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, I say, that if we are driven to that alternative; if\r\nthe representatives of the two extremes will not give us the benefit\r\nof their counsel and assistance, the Central States, and the great\r\nNorthwest, must take the matter into their own hands. North Carolina,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and\r\nother States near them, must unite with Ohio and the Northwest to save\r\nthe country. They have the power to do it--they must do it.\r\n\r\nRemember, sir, that I only refer to this as a last alternative. It is\r\none to which I hope and pray we may never be driven. I cannot yet\r\ngive up the hope, that all we need here is patient and thorough\r\ndiscussion and examination of the subject; that when the true\r\ncondition is understood, we shall unite together to restore confidence\r\nto the country. It must be so. The consequences of farther\r\ndisagreement are too great, the crisis is too important to permit mere\r\nsectional differences, mere pride of opinion, party shackles or party\r\nplatforms to control the action of any gentleman here. The Republic\r\nshall not be divided. The nation shall not be destroyed. The\r\npatriotism of the people will yet save the country against all its\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN gave notice, that at the proper time he wished to offer two\r\namendments to the second section of the propositions reported by the\r\ncommittee.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. RUFFIN stated the substance of the amendments he\r\nproposed in a voice so low, as not to be audible to the greater part\r\nof the Conference. They are not to be found in the Journal, nor in the\r\ndocuments printed by order of the Conference, nor were they heard by\r\nme.]\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD and Mr. DODGE rose and made motions at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe floor was given to Mr. DODGE, who moved, that when the Conference\r\nadjourn, it adjourn to meet at ten o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH moved to amend, by inserting half-past ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nSeveral motions were made by different members, and much confusion\r\narose, which was suppressed.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--We all, no doubt, wish to economize time as much as\r\npossible. The prevailing wish seems to be to meet about eleven o'clock\r\nto-morrow. That can be accomplished by a simple motion to adjourn,\r\nwhich I make, and which should take precedence of all others.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT put the motion to adjourn, and declared it not carried.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER:--I move to amend Mr. DODGE'S motion, by inserting seven\r\no'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nThis motion did not prevail, and the question was taken upon Mr.\r\nDODGE'S motion, which was adopted, and the Conference then adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 20th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by President TYLER at ten o'clock,\r\nand after prayer by the Rev. Dr. SAMPSON, the Journal of yesterday was\r\nread and approved.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS:--I desire to call the attention of the Conference to the\r\nfact, that the time has not yet arrived when the Conference, by its\r\nrules, should commence business. The rule is, that the daily session\r\nshall commence at eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference, previous to its adjournment yesterday,\r\nadopted the motion of Mr. DODGE, fixing this hour for the commencement\r\nof the present session.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I wish to call attention to the 9th rule in the\r\nprinted list. It has not been adopted by the Conference. It is in here\r\nby mistake. The Committee on Rules did not intend to recommend it. I\r\nask now that it be stricken from the record.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I rise to debate that motion.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Then I withdraw it.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS:--I wish to offer a preamble and resolutions, and would\r\nlike to have them read for the information of the Conference. I ask to\r\nhave them printed and laid upon the table, so that I can move them as\r\nan amendment at the proper time.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were laid upon the table and ordered to be printed,\r\nand are as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, The Federal Constitution and the laws made in\r\n     pursuance thereof, are the supreme law of the land, and\r\n     should command the willing obedience of all good citizens;\r\n     and _whereas_ it is alleged that sundry States have enacted\r\n     laws repugnant thereto. Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved._ That this Convention respectfully requests the\r\n     several States to revise their respective enactments, and\r\n     to modify or repeal any laws which may be found to be in\r\n     conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the President of this Convention is\r\n     requested to send a copy of the foregoing preamble and\r\n     resolutions to the Governor of each of the States, with the\r\n     request that the same be communicated to the Legislature\r\n     thereof.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I must now insist upon having my resolution, offered\r\nyesterday, considered. Congress is about adjourning, and, if we do not\r\nclose our labors to-day, we cannot have our propositions acted upon\r\nunder the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives. They can\r\nbe kept out on the objection of any member. I do not wish to debate\r\nthe resolution, and I hope the debate will not be continued in the\r\ngeneral manner it was yesterday.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--There seems to be a disposition to stop debate now, after\r\nnearly the whole time has been occupied by the other side. Yesterday\r\nthe whole session was occupied by a general discussion of this\r\nquestion. It is my right to debate it as generally as other gentlemen\r\nhave done. I shall avail myself of that right. I may not speak thirty\r\nminutes, but I will not submit to the imposition of a different rule\r\nupon me, if I can avoid it, from that which has been imposed upon\r\nothers. The first question is on striking out the last clause of the\r\nresolution. On that I have nothing to say except that I ask for a vote\r\nby States.\r\n\r\nA vote by States was then taken, and resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n    AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n    Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio,\r\n    Pennsylvania, and Vermont--12.\r\n\r\n    NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, North\r\n    Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia--8.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I move to lay the whole subject upon the table. It is\r\nuseless to attempt to stop discussion in this way.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I call for a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CLAY prevailed by the following vote.\r\n\r\n    AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n    Massachusetts. New York, Vermont, Virginia, and New\r\n    Hampshire--10.\r\n\r\n    NOES.--Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North\r\n    Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee--9.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--There is really but one question that ought to engage\r\nthe attention of this Conference. All others may be settled in half an\r\nhour. This question is a great one, and assumes a variety of forms. I\r\nwish to vote upon it understandingly, and I want some information from\r\nthe committee which has had it in charge.\r\n\r\nI ask that committee whether they are not proposing a change in the\r\nConstitution, which, if adopted, will operate as a direct and\r\neffectual protection of slavery in all the territories of the United\r\nStates? This appears to me to be the true question for our\r\nconsideration. I wish to know what meaning is attached by its friends\r\nto one part of the proposed article.\r\n\r\nIt states that \"the _status_ of persons owing service or labor as it\r\nnow exists shall not be changed by law,\" &c.; and again, \"that the\r\nrights arising out of said relations shall be subject to judicial\r\ncognizance in the Federal courts according to the _common law_.\" The\r\n_status_, then, shall not be changed. By that term I suppose condition\r\nis intended. I understand that perfectly. There shall be no law to\r\nchange the condition, to _impair_ the rights of the slaveholder; but\r\nshall there be no law to _protect_ these rights? Now, what is intended\r\nby this? Why not make this provision plain, and not leave it open to\r\nany question of construction? The ghost of the old trouble rises here,\r\nand will not down at the bidding of any man. I believe under this\r\narticle the institution of slavery is to be protected by a most\r\ningenious contrivance. The _common law_, administered according to the\r\npro-slavery view, is to be called in for its protection.\r\n\r\nNow I ask the chairman of the committee reporting these propositions\r\nwhat he means by the _common law_? The common law, as we understand\r\nit, is the law of freedom--not of slavery. But I do not here propose\r\nto discuss that question. I wish to know how the truth really is. How\r\ndoes the committee, how do the friends of this proposition understand\r\nit?\r\n\r\nBy the _common law_ a slave is still a man: a person, and not a\r\npersonal chattel. He may owe service, as a child to its parent, an\r\napprentice to his master, but he is still a _person_ owing service. He\r\nis all the time recognized as a _man_. As such he may own and hold\r\nproperty, take it by inheritance and dispose of it at pleasure, by\r\nwill or by contract. All these rights, all the principles on which\r\nthey are founded, are in direct antagonism to slavery. The argument\r\nmay be carried much farther, but this is far enough for my purpose. By\r\nthe slave law, all this is reversed. The master owns the _body_ of the\r\nslave, may sell or otherwise dispose of him, may make him the subject\r\nof inheritance. The slave loses all the attributes of a person, and\r\nbecomes property as much as the horse or the ox that feeds at his\r\nmaster's crib. These, in a condition of slavery are the rights of the\r\nmaster over the slave. These rights the common law, under this\r\nproposition, is to recognize, protect, and enforce. I believe I am not\r\nmistaken in this. What other construction can you give the article? It\r\nis a distinct proposal to engraft slavery upon the common law: to\r\ndeclare in the Constitution that slavery is recognized and protected\r\nby the common law.\r\n\r\nNow, the North has always protested against this. She will never\r\nconsent to it. She understands all the consequences as well as you. No\r\ndoubt it would be a great point gained for you, to have the\r\nConstitution recognize the institution of slavery as part of the\r\ncommon law. For then slavery goes wherever the common law goes. Its\r\nrights under this provision are not confined to the territories. Once\r\nestablished, these may be enforced in a free State just as well. It is\r\nthe old proposition over again, which has come before the American\r\npeople so many times under so many different guises. It makes slavery\r\nnational, freedom sectional. If this is so, if such is the\r\nconstruction which it is intended this section shall receive, why not\r\nstate it openly? why leave it as a question of construction?\r\n\r\nThis construction involves other considerations. This new kind of\r\ncommon law is to be substituted for the old. The latter has been\r\nunderstood for centuries almost. Its principles have been discussed\r\nand settled. It is a system founded by experience, and adapted to the\r\nwants of the people subject to it. Its very name implies that it was\r\nnot created by legislative authority. A strange common law indeed that\r\nwould be which is _created by the Constitution_.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Other principles of the common law are subject to\r\nchange. They are adapted to the advance of civilization, to the wants\r\nof communities. Change is the universal law of nature. This new kind\r\nof common law is alone to be perpetual.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter into a general discussion of the\r\nsubject. This point struck me as important, as needing elucidation. If\r\nI am wrong in this construction, the committee will correct me.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--The proposition contained in the first article of the\r\nproposed amendment, is copied from the CRITTENDEN resolutions in\r\nsubstance. It is true that the language is somewhat changed, but the\r\nlegal effect is identical in both the propositions. The term\r\n\"_status_\" &c., as there used is not applicable to all the territory\r\nof the United States. It only extends to that portion of the territory\r\nsouth of 36° 30´. It crushes out liberty nowhere. It changes\r\nnothing--no rights whatever. Again, whatever may be the _status_ of\r\nthe person in the State from which he comes, _that_ is preserved in\r\nthe territory, and that alone. It is precisely similar to the case of\r\na contract to which the _lex loci_ gives the construction, and the\r\n_lex fori_ its execution.\r\n\r\nI like the common law. I have made it my study. I like the use of this\r\nterm here. It was a good system when not as perfect as it is now. The\r\ncommon law of England even tolerated slavery until it was abolished.\r\nThe colliers of the North of England were once, to all intents and\r\npurposes, as much slaves as any negro on the Southern plantations,\r\nexcept in the matter of separation of families. I can refer you to a\r\nprecedent on this subject, which you will find in a book of no very\r\nhigh authority. I mean the novel, _Red Gauntlet_.\r\n\r\nThe general principle applicable here is this: Whenever you establish\r\nthe right--no matter how, if you _establish_ it--the common law\r\nasserts the remedy. There is no crushing out about it. The simple\r\nproposition is this: Slavery exists already in that little worthless\r\nterritory we own below the proposed line. Will we agree that it shall\r\nremain there just as it is now, so long as the territorial condition\r\ncontinues? That is all. There is no mystery or question of\r\nconstruction about it.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--The questions now before the Conference I suppose arise\r\nupon the report presented by the majority of the committee, and upon\r\nthe motion to substitute for that report the propositions of the\r\nminority of the same committee.\r\n\r\nI propose to add to this report the three following propositions; and\r\nI will read them for the information of the Conference.\r\n\r\n     I. \"Each State has the sole and exclusive right, according\r\n     to its own judgment, to order and direct its domestic\r\n     institutions, and to determine for itself what shall be the\r\n     relation to each other of all persons residing or being\r\n     within its limits.\r\n\r\n     II. \"Congress shall provide by law for securing to the\r\n     citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of\r\n     citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\n     III. \"The union of the States under the Constitution is\r\n     indissoluble; and no State can secede from the Union, or\r\n     nullify an act of Congress, or absolve its citizens from\r\n     their paramount obligations of obedience to the Constitution\r\n     and laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThese additions would render the majority report much more acceptable\r\nto the northern people than it is in its present shape, though even\r\nthen, I am bound to declare, I could not support it. I prefer the\r\nsubstitute. In what I have now to say, I shall not confine myself to a\r\ndiscussion of these propositions, but availing myself of the latitude\r\nof debate hitherto allowed to gentlemen who have addressed the\r\nConference in favor of the report of the majority of the committee, I\r\nshall endeavor to bring to the notice of this body, more fully than I\r\nhave yet done, my views upon the general question presented for our\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I state at the outset that I am indisposed to the\r\nadoption, at the present time, of any amendment of the Constitution.\r\nTo change the organic law of thirty millions of people is a measure of\r\nthe greatest importance. Such a measure should never be undertaken in\r\nany case, or under any circumstances, without great deliberation and\r\nthe highest moral certainty that the country will be benefited by the\r\nchange. In this case, as yet, there has been no deliberation;\r\ncertainly not so far as the delegates from New York are concerned. The\r\nresolutions of Virginia were passed on the 19th of January. New York\r\n(her Legislature being in session) appointed her delegates on the 5th\r\nof February. We came here on the 8th. Our delegation was not full for\r\na week. The amendments proposed were submitted on the 15th. It is now\r\nthe 20th of the month. We are urged to act at once without further\r\ndeliberation or delay.\r\n\r\nTo found an empire, or to make a constitution for a people, on which\r\nso much of their happiness depends, requires the sublimest effort of\r\nthe human intellect, the greatest impartiality in weighing opposing\r\ninterests, the utmost calmness in judgment, the highest prudence in\r\ndecision. It is proposed that we shall proceed to amend in essential\r\nparticulars a Constitution which, since its adoption by the people of\r\nthis country, has answered all its needs; with a haste which to my\r\nmind is unnecessary, not to say indecent.\r\n\r\nHave any defects been discovered in this Constitution? I have listened\r\nmost attentively to hear those defects mentioned, if any such have\r\nbeen found to exist. I have heard none. No change in the Judicial\r\nDepartment is suggested. The exercise of judicial powers under the\r\nConstitution has been satisfactory enough to the South. The Judicial\r\nDepartment is to be left untouched, as I think it should be. You\r\npropose no change in the form of the Executive or Legislative\r\nDepartments. These you leave as they were before. What you do propose\r\nis, to place certain limitations upon the Legislative power, to\r\nprohibit legislation upon certain important subjects, to give new\r\nguarantees to slavery, and this, as you admit, before any person has\r\nbeen injured, before any right has been infringed.\r\n\r\nThere is high authority which ought to be satisfactory to you, that of\r\nthe President of the United States, now in office, for the statement\r\nthat Congress never undertook to pass an unconstitutional law\r\naffecting the interests of slavery except the Missouri Compromise.\r\nWell, you have repealed that. You have also every assurance that can\r\nbe given, that the administration about coming into power proposes no\r\ninterference with your institutions within State limits. Can you not\r\nbe satisfied with that? No. You propose these amendments in advance.\r\nYou insist upon them, and you declare that you must and will have them\r\nor certain consequences must follow. But, gentlemen of the South, what\r\nreasons do you give for entering upon this hasty, this precipitate\r\naction? You say it is the prevailing sense of insecurity, the anxiety,\r\nthe apprehension you feel lest something unlawful, something\r\nunconstitutional, may be done. Yet the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.\r\nSEDDON) tells us that Virginia is able to protect all who reside\r\nwithin her limits, and that she will do so at all hazards. Why not\r\ntell us the truth outright? It is not action under the Constitution or\r\nin Congress that you would prevent. What is it, then? You are\r\ndetermined to prevent the agitation of the subject. Let us understand\r\neach other. You have called us here to prevent future discussion of\r\nthe subject of slavery. It is _that_ you fear--it is _that_ you would\r\navoid--discussion in Congress--in the State Legislatures--in the\r\nnewspapers--in popular assemblies.\r\n\r\nBut will the plan you propose, the course you have marked out,\r\naccomplish your purpose? Will it stop discussion? Will it lessen it in\r\nthe slightest degree? Can you not profit by the experience of the\r\npast? Can you prevent an agitation of this subject, or any other, by\r\nany constitutional provisions? No! Look at the details of your scheme.\r\nYou propose through the Constitution to require payment for fugitive\r\nslaves: to make the North pay for them. You are thus throwing a\r\nlighted firebrand not only into Congress, but into every State\r\nLegislature, into every county, city, and village in the land.\r\n\r\nThis one proposition to pay for fugitive slaves, will prove a subject\r\nfor almost irrepressible agitation. You say to the State Legislatures,\r\nyou shall not obstruct the rendition of fugitives from service, but\r\nyou may legislate in aid of their rendition, thereby implying that the\r\nlatter kind of legislation will be their duty. You thus provide a new\r\nsubject of discussion and agitation for all these Legislatures. In the\r\nBorder States especially, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, you will find\r\nthis agitation fiercer than any you have hitherto witnessed; of which\r\nyou complain so much. You will add to the flame until it becomes a\r\nconsuming fire.\r\n\r\nYou propose to stop the discussion of these questions by the press. Do\r\nyou really believe that in this age of the world you can accomplish\r\nthat? You know little of history if such is your belief. Free speech\r\nis stronger than constitutions or dynasties. You might as well put\r\nyour hands over the crater of a burning volcano, and seek thus to\r\nextinguish its flames, as to attempt to stop discussion by such an\r\namendment of the Constitution. Stop discussion of the great questions\r\naffecting the policy, strength, and prosperity of the Government! You\r\ncannot do it! You ought not to attempt to do it!\r\n\r\nI wish to speak kindly upon this subject. I entertain no unfriendly\r\nfeelings toward any section. But while you are thus complaining of us\r\nin the free States, because we agitate and discuss the question of\r\nslavery, are you not, in a great degree, responsible for this\r\nagitation yourselves? Do you not discuss it, and agitate it? Do you\r\nnot make slavery the subject of your speeches in the South, and in the\r\npresence of your slaves? Do you not make charges against us, which in\r\nyour cooler moments you know to be unfounded? Do you not charge us in\r\nthe hearing of your slaves with the design of interfering with slavery\r\nin the States, with a design to free them if we succeed?\r\n\r\nYou have done all this and more, and if discontent, anxiety, and\r\nmistrust exist among your people, let me say that such discussion has\r\ncontributed more to produce them, than all the agitation of the\r\nslavery question at the North. But your amendments are not pointed at\r\nyour discussions. That kind of agitation may go on as before. It is\r\nonly the discussion on the other side you would repress!\r\n\r\nIf the condition of affairs among you is as you represent it, have you\r\nno duties to perform; is there nothing for you to do? Should you not\r\ntell your people what we have assured you upon every proper occasion,\r\nthat the Republican Party has always repudiated all intention of\r\ninterfering with slavery, or any other Southern institution within the\r\nStates? This you all know. Have you told your people this? If you\r\nwould explain it to them now, would they not be quieted? Do not reply\r\nthat they _believe_ we have such a purpose. Who is responsible for\r\nthat belief? Have you not continually asserted before your people,\r\nnotwithstanding every assurance we could give you to the contrary,\r\nthat we are determined to interfere with your rights? It is thus the\r\nresponsibility rests with you.\r\n\r\nAlthough such is my conviction, supported, as I think, by all the\r\nevidence, I am still for peace. Show me now any proposition that will\r\nsecure peace, and I will go for it if I can. We came here to take\r\neach other by the hand, to compare views, explain, consult. We meet\r\nyou in the most reasonable spirit. Any thing that honorable men _may_\r\ndo, we _will_ do.\r\n\r\nWe will go back to 1845 when you admitted Texas; back to the Missouri\r\nCompromise of 1820. You certainly can complain of nothing previous to\r\nthat time. If, since then, there has been any law of Congress passed\r\nwhich is unjust toward you, which infringes upon your rights, which\r\noperates unfairly upon your interests, we will join you in securing\r\nits repeal. We will go farther. If you will point out any act of the\r\nRepublican Party which has given you just cause for apprehension, we\r\nwill give you all security against it. We will do any thing but amend\r\nthe fundamental law of Government. Before we do that we must be\r\nconvinced of its necessity.\r\n\r\nWhen you propose essential changes in the Constitution you must expect\r\nthat they will be subjected to a critical examination; if not here,\r\ncertainly elsewhere. I object to those proposed by the majority of the\r\ncommittee--\r\n\r\n1st. For what they _do_ contain.\r\n\r\n2nd. For what they _do not_ contain.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to criticize the language used in your propositions\r\nof amendment. That would be trifling. I think the language very\r\ninfelicitous, and if I supposed those propositions were to become part\r\nof the Constitution, I should think many verbal changes indispensable.\r\nBut I pass by all that, and come at once to the substance.\r\n\r\nI object to the propositions, sir, because they would put into the\r\nConstitution new expressions relating to slavery, which were\r\nsedulously kept out of it by the framers of that instrument; left out\r\nof it, not accidentally, but because, as MADISON said, they did not\r\nwish posterity to know from the Constitution that the institution\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nBut I object further, because the propositions contain guarantees for\r\nslavery which our fathers did not and would not give. In 1787 the\r\nconvention was held at Philadelphia to establish our form of\r\nGovernment. WASHINGTON was its presiding officer, whose name was in\r\nitself a bond of union. It was soon after the close of a long and\r\nbloody war. Shoulder to shoulder--through winter snows and beneath\r\nsummer suns--through such sufferings and sacrifices as the world had\r\nscarcely ever witnessed--the people of these States, under Providence,\r\nhad fought and achieved their independence. Fresh from the field,\r\ntheir hearts full of patriotism, determined to perpetuate the\r\nliberties they had achieved, the people sent their delegates into the\r\nconvention to frame a Constitution which would preserve to their\r\nposterity the blessings they had won.\r\n\r\nThese delegates, under the presidence of WASHINGTON, aided by the\r\ncounsels of MADISON and FRANKLIN, considered the very questions with\r\nwhich we are now dealing, and they refused to put into the\r\nConstitution which they were making, such guarantees to slavery as you\r\nnow ask from their descendants. That is my interpretation of their\r\naction. Either these guarantees are in the Constitution, or they are\r\nnot. If they are there, let them remain there. If they are not there,\r\nI can conceive of no possible state of circumstances under which I\r\nwould consent to admit them.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--Not to save the Union?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--No, sir, no! That is my comprehensive answer.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--Then you will let the Union slide.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--No, never! I would let slavery slide, and save the Union.\r\nGreater things than this have been done. This year has seen slavery\r\nabolished in all the Russias.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN:--Do you think it better to have the free and slave States\r\nseparated, and to have the Union dissolved?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I would sacrifice all I have; lay down my life for the\r\nUnion. But I will not give these guarantees to slavery. If the Union\r\ncannot be preserved without them, it cannot long be preserved with\r\nthem. Let me ask you, if you will recommend to the people of the\r\nsouthern States, in case these guarantees are conceded, to accept\r\nthem, and abide by their obligations to the Union? You answer, Yes! Do\r\nyou suppose you can induce the seceded States to return? You answer:\r\nWe do not know! What will you yourselves do if, after all, they\r\nrefuse? Your answer is, \"_We will go with them!_\"\r\n\r\nWe are to understand, then, that this is the language of the slave\r\nStates, which have not seceded, toward the free States: \"If you will\r\nsupport our amendments, we will try to induce the seceded States to\r\nreturn to the Union. We rather think we can induce them to return; but\r\nif we cannot, then we will go with them.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is to be done by the Government of the United States while you\r\nare trying this experiment? The seceded States are organizing a\r\nGovernment with all its departments. They are levying taxes, raising\r\nmilitary forces, and engaging in commerce with foreign nations, in\r\nplain violation of the provisions of the Constitution. If this\r\ncondition of affairs lasts six months longer, France and England will\r\nrecognize theirs as a Government _de facto_. Do you suppose we will\r\nsubmit to this, that we can submit to it?\r\n\r\nI speak only for myself. I undertake to commit no one but myself; but\r\nI here assert, that an administration which fails to assert by force\r\nits authority over the whole country will be a disgrace to the nation.\r\nThere is no middle ground; we must keep this country unbroken, or we\r\ngive it up to ruin!\r\n\r\nWe are told that one State has an hundred thousand men ready for the\r\nfield, and that if we do not assent to these propositions she will\r\nfight us. If I believed this to be true, I would not consent to treat\r\non any terms.\r\n\r\nFrom the ports of these seceded States have sailed all the\r\nfillibustering expeditions which have heretofore disgraced this land.\r\nThere, have those enterprises been conceived and fitted out. Their new\r\ngovernment will enter upon a new career of conquest unless prevented.\r\nEven if these propositions of amendment are received and submitted to\r\nthe people, I see nothing but war in the future, unless those States\r\nare quickly brought back to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to use harsh language. I will not stigmatize this\r\nConvention as a political body, or assert that this is a movement\r\ntoward a revolution counter to a political revolution just\r\naccomplished by the elections. Nor will I speak of personal liberty\r\nbills, or of northern State legislation, about which so much complaint\r\nhas been made. If I went into those questions, much might be said on\r\nboth sides. We might ask you whether you had not thrown stones at us?\r\n\r\nDid not the Governor of Louisiana, in his message to the Legislature\r\nof his State, recommend special legislation against the supporters of\r\nMr. LINCOLN? Is there not on the statute books of Maryland a law which\r\nprohibits a \"black Republican\" from holding certain offices in that\r\nState?\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--There was a police bill before the Legislature of\r\nMaryland, in which some provision of that kind was inserted by one who\r\nwished to defeat it. Its friends were compelled to accept the\r\nprovision in order to save the bill. The courts at once held the\r\nprovision unconstitutional. All that is so.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I am answered. It is admitted that the Legislature of that\r\nancient State did place upon her statute book an act passed with all\r\nthe forms of law, containing a provision so insulting to millions of\r\nAmerican citizens.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--Will Mr. FIELD permit me a single question? I ask it for\r\ninformation, and because I am unable to answer it myself. I therefore\r\nrely upon his superior judgment and better means of knowledge. It\r\nappears to me that Massachusetts, Maine, and New York have gone much\r\nfarther. The charge is a serious one. Maryland has never refused to\r\nsubmit to the decisions of the proper judicial tribunals. The\r\nConstitution has provided for the erection of a tribunal which should\r\nfinally decide all questions of constitutional law. That tribunal has\r\ndecided that the people of the slave States have a legal right to go\r\ninto the territories with their property. The gentleman from New York\r\ntells us he is in favor of free territory, and his people are also.\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to ask, where in the Constitution he finds the right to\r\nappeal from the decision of the Supreme Court to the popular voice? In\r\nwhat clause of the Constitution is this power lodged? Where does he\r\nfind this right of appeal to the people, a right which he insists the\r\nNorth will not give up?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I am happy to answer the question of the gentleman from\r\nMaryland, and I reply that when once the Supreme Court has decided a\r\nquestion, I know of no way in which the decision can be reversed,\r\nexcept through an amendment of the Constitution. I have the greatest\r\nrespect for the authority of the Supreme Court. I would take up arms,\r\nif necessary, to execute its decisions. I say that States, as well as\r\npersons, should respect and conform to its judgments, and I would say\r\nthey must. But I am bound in candor to add, that in my view the\r\nSupreme Court has never adjudged the point to which the gentlemen\r\nrefers; it gave opinions, but no decision.\r\n\r\nI was about to state, when I was first interrupted, that the majority\r\nreport altogether omits those guarantees, which, if the Constitution\r\nis to be amended, ought to be there before any others that have been\r\nsuggested. I mean those which will secure protection in the South to\r\nthe citizens of the free States, and those which will protect the\r\nUnion against future attempts at secession; guarantees which are\r\ncontained in the propositions that I have submitted as proper to be\r\nadded to the report of the majority.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I must insist, that if amendments to the Constitution are\r\nrequired at all, it is better that they should be proposed and\r\nconsidered in a General Convention. Although I do not regard this\r\nConference as exactly unconstitutional, it is certainly a bad\r\nprecedent. It is a body nominally composed of representatives of the\r\nStates, and is called to urge upon Congress propositions of amendment\r\nto the Constitution. Its recommendations will have something of force\r\nin them; it will undoubtedly be claimed for them in Congress that they\r\npossess such force. I do not like to see an irregular body sitting by\r\nthe side of a legislative body and attempting to influence its\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAgain, all the States are not here. Oregon and California--the great\r\nPacific dominions with all their wealth and power, present and\r\nprospective--have not been consulted at all. Will it be replied that\r\nall the States can vote upon the amendments? That is a very different\r\nthing from proposing them. California and Oregon may have interests of\r\ntheir own to protect, propositions of their own to make. Is it right\r\nfor us to act without consulting them? I will go for a convention,\r\nbecause I believe it is the best way to avoid civil war.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--If a General Convention is held, what amendments will\r\nyou propose?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I have already said that I have none to propose. I am\r\nsatisfied with the Constitution as it is.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Then, for God's sake, let us have no General\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I think the gentleman's observation is not logical. He\r\nwants amendments, I do not. But I say if we are to have them, let us\r\nhave them through a General Convention.\r\n\r\nAnd I say farther, that this is the quickest way to secure them. If a\r\nGeneral Convention is to be called, let it be held at once, just as\r\nsoon as possible. If gentlemen from eight of the States in this\r\nConference represent truly the public sentiment of their people, as I\r\nwill assume they do, there is no other alternative. We must have\r\neither the arbitrament of reason or the arbitrament of the sword. The\r\ngloomy future alone can tell whether the latter is to be the one\r\nadopted. I greatly fear it is. The conviction presses upon me in my\r\nwaking and my sleeping hours. Only last night I dreamed of marching\r\narmies and news from the seat of war. [A laugh from the Kentucky and\r\nVirginia benches.]\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen laugh. I thought they, too, had fears of war. I thought\r\ntheir threats and prophecies were sincere. God grant that I may not\r\nhereafter have to say, \"I had a dream that was not all a dream.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I have but little more to trouble you with. In what I have said I\r\ntrust there has been no expression that will be taken in ill part. I\r\nhave spoken what I sincerely felt. If there has been an unkind word in\r\nmy remarks I did not intend it, and am sorry for having uttered it.\r\n\r\nFor my own State and for the North I have only to say that they are\r\ndevoted to the Union. We have been reminded of HAMILTON'S opinion,\r\nthat the States are stronger than the Union, and that when the\r\ncollision comes the Union must fall. This is a mistake. In the North\r\nthe love for the Union is the strongest of political affections. New\r\nYork will stand by the flag of the country while there is a star left\r\nin its folds. If the Union should be reduced to thirteen States--if it\r\nshould be reduced to three States--if all should fall away but\r\nherself, she will stand alone to bear and uphold that honored flag,\r\nand recover the Union of which it is the pledge and symbol. God grant\r\nthat time may never come, but that New York may stand side by side\r\nwith Kentucky and Virginia to the end. That we may all stand by the\r\nUnion, negotiate for it, fight for it, if the necessity comes, is my\r\nwish, my hope, my prayer. The Constitution made for us by WASHINGTON,\r\nFRANKLIN, MADISON, and HAMILTON, and the wise and patriotic men who\r\nlabored with them, is good enough for us. We stand for the country,\r\nfor the Union, for the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI found yesterday upon my table a pamphlet bearing the title of \"The\r\nGoverning Race.\" It contains a sublime passage from LONGFELLOW'S poem\r\nof \"The Ship,\" which, as it closes the pamphlet, shall also close my\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n     \"Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\r\n     Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!\r\n     Humanity with all its fears,\r\n     With all the hopes of future years,\r\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\r\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\r\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\r\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\r\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\r\n     In what a forge and what a heat\r\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\r\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\r\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\r\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\r\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\r\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\r\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\r\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\r\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\r\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\r\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\r\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE:--I shall not occupy much of the time of the Conference. All\r\nthe speeches that have been made, and all the declamation that has\r\nbeen uttered on this floor, have not made a single convert. Last of\r\nall would I wish to follow the gentleman who has just taken his seat.\r\nHe proposes to postpone action, asserts that we are acting without\r\nconsideration, in haste, and without due deliberation. I look upon\r\nthis subject from a different point of view. I believe the motive of\r\nPennsylvania in first responding to the invitation of Virginia was to\r\ninduce the States to meet here in council, and remove that peril which\r\nnow threatens our common country.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania had another reason. She is a border State; she has a\r\ndeeper and more vital interest in the present unhappy differences than\r\nNew York or the North. If there is to be war; civil, unnatural war,\r\nwhose country is to be devastated, whose fields laid waste and\r\ntrampled down? They are those of the border States--of Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and possibly New Jersey. These are\r\nthe States that are to suffer. Gentlemen from New York and the North\r\nEast, in the bosom of their families, their towns and cities not in\r\nthe least danger, may be as impassive as the granite rocks that bind\r\ntheir shores. We have a deeper, a more vital interest; therefore we\r\nfeel and speak. When Pennsylvania received the invitation of Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, and other States had seceded. Dangers were\r\naccumulating. Then it was that the old conservative Keystone State\r\nthrew herself into the breach. She sent her delegation here to save\r\nthe country and not to change the Constitution--not to alter it, but\r\nto explain it and to give our Southern sisters the guarantees they\r\nonce did not ask and did not need. We believed that the great majority\r\nof the people of the Southern States were Union loving men, who choose\r\nto sail under the flag of the Union, rather than under any piratical\r\nand treasonable banner. We knew there were rebels within those States,\r\nas there is a faction at the North composed of men as much rebels as\r\nthey are. We knew, also, that there was a large body of men at the\r\nSouth, who, though loyal at heart, were in a state of great anxiety\r\nand apprehension, and who might be stirred up by demagogues, through\r\nappeals to their State pride and other influences, to take a stand\r\nagainst the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans denied that they wished to interfere in any manner\r\nwith the institution of slavery. We have come here to give the slave\r\nStates a declaratory exposition of our views. We have come bearing the\r\nolive branch. We are met by the South in a spirit of conciliation. The\r\ndelegates tell us that they hope to be able to bring back their erring\r\nsister States into the fold of the Union, if they can go to them\r\nbearing satisfactory guarantees from us. Pennsylvania is willing that\r\nwe should give them that opportunity. We have lived in harmony with\r\nthem: we wish to live in peace with them. If the seceded States will\r\nnot come back, if the other Southern States cannot bring them back,\r\nthen, are we in any worse position? No, sir! we are not. We desire to\r\nplace ourselves right before the world. Then, if some States will not\r\nstay in the Union, on their heads be the responsibility. Then, if any\r\nwrong has been done, if any right has been violated, Pennsylvania will\r\nnot be responsible. We shall have done our duty, on them will the\r\nresponsibility rest. They must answer for it before the world and\r\nbefore the judgment-seat.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the consequence of postponing action on this subject? We\r\nare strengthening the position of the seceded States. We\r\n\r\n     \"Keep the word of promise to the ear,\r\n     And break it to the hope.\"\r\n\r\nEvery rebel will rejoice at our inaction.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of Virginia in the Union depends upon the action of a\r\nconvention now in session in Richmond. If we send her commissioners\r\nhome to say to that convention, \"The North will wait two years and\r\nthen consider your propositions,\" what will the convention say to\r\nthat? The seceded States have at this moment commissioners at Richmond\r\nentreating Virginia to join their Confederacy, and to detach herself\r\nfrom the free States. If we fail to act, who can fail to foresee the\r\nconsequences? Maryland is about calling a convention. She, too, will\r\nact, and she will go where her associations and her interests carry\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFrom this you can infer some of the reasons why Pennsylvania has sent\r\nher commissioners here. Her object was not delay. Her wish was for\r\naction--speedy action. She wishes to do all she can to accelerate\r\naction. She wishes to have some plan laid before the country at\r\nonce--something fair to all sections--and then, with, the\r\nalternatives before them, let the people decide. She wishes to pour\r\noil on the troubled waters.\r\n\r\nWe are told by our friend from New York, that the amendments are badly\r\ndrawn. If so, let him help us to correct them. No one can do it\r\nbetter. Surely there is talent enough in this Conference to remedy\r\nsuch defects as are suggested by him.\r\n\r\nGentlemen say they do not wish to convert free territory into slave\r\nterritory. Neither do I. We are not doing that. All the territory\r\nsouth of the line proposed is slave territory already. The adoption of\r\nthese propositions does not extend slavery at all.\r\n\r\nThe first advantage the Republican party ever obtained in\r\nPennsylvania, was on account of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nfollowed by the decision of the Supreme Court, declaring that the\r\nnormal condition of the territory was a condition of slavery, and on\r\nthat ground holding the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. Such\r\nbeing the state of the matter, do we lose any thing by the prohibition\r\nof slavery north of 36° 30´? No! All that vast territory north of the\r\nline will be dedicated to freedom. The South asks that faith shall be\r\nkept; that slavery in the territory south of the line shall not be\r\ninterfered with. This is the only material averment in the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nThe second article contains a modification of the Constitution which\r\nwas not intended. This I understand it is proper to amend.\r\n\r\nAnother proposition is to put a barrier into the Constitution, which\r\nwill prevent the acquisition of territory in future by joint\r\nresolution. To this I am sure the gentleman from New York will not\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nSir, I have read and carefully considered all the proposed amendments.\r\nTo my mind they present no essential changes, or modifications, or\r\nconstructions, of that instrument. I can see no injury in them to the\r\ninterests of the North. I think they are rather to the advantage of\r\nthe North. I believe the people of the North will hasten cheerfully to\r\nadopt them.\r\n\r\nNow, if we can adopt them--if we can make them a part of our organic\r\nlaw, and thus settle these differences, who will not be glad? There is\r\nstill a deep and abiding love of the Union in the hearts of all the\r\npeople. They will hail with joy any action of yours which tends to\r\nstrengthen it.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I should not address the Conference at this time if I did\r\nnot discover early signs of closing the debate, and I prefer to be\r\nclearly understood upon the subject of discussion before it closes.\r\n\r\nI well understand the appeals of the border slave States. They think\r\nthat one-half their number are already out of the Union. They deem\r\nthemselves weakened by their defection. I well understand the inquiry\r\nof the eloquent gentleman from Virginia, when he asked, on the second\r\nday of the session, \"Can't you understand our position?\"\r\n\r\nI have listened to appeals stronger and more eloquent than I ever\r\nexpect to hear again. The representatives from the South on this floor\r\nare skilful in debate and eloquent in speech. Were there no view of\r\nthe case but the one they present, I might become a convert myself.\r\n\r\nThey have seen half of the slave States, acting on the theory of right\r\nclaimed by the South, undertake to go out of the Union. If they love\r\nthe States they represent, and the Union of all the States, they\r\nshould be filled with apprehension and alarm. The venerable gentleman\r\nfrom North Carolina (Judge RUFFIN) has appealed to us with an ardor,\r\npatriotism, and eloquence which has produced an indelible impression\r\nupon my mind, while the gentleman (Mr. SEDDON) from Virginia, in\r\ndescribing parallels of attack which the North, as he said, were\r\nconstructing, in the course of events, about the institution of\r\nslavery, commanded my undivided attention. Yet gentlemen greatly err\r\nin assuming that we of the North are acting under some wizard\r\ninfluence, and, out of pure malignity, are plotting the overthrow of\r\nslavery. There is no plot or general concert in the action of the\r\nNorth on this subject. We are, like the South, subject to general laws\r\naffecting mind and morals, as well as pecuniary concerns, which laws\r\ncannot be disregarded. We cannot act otherwise than we do. Ideas and\r\nprinciples control, and we and those whom we represent will act in\r\naccordance with them, whatever be the consequences.\r\n\r\nMuch is said here about saving to the Union the slave States not yet\r\ngone. All I have to say on this point is, I wish to save them, and I\r\ntrust we shall have less trouble with the seven than with the fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe chair was here taken by Mr. ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nThe people of this country, North and South alike, obey the laws of\r\ninterest and morality. There is no disposition at the North to destroy\r\nslavery. Let these accusations and criminations be heard no more. What\r\nI am about to say may weigh but little, but I know something of the\r\nNorth, and a little of the South. I fully believe that the institution\r\nof slavery within the States should be left with them exclusively--that\r\nsuch is the prevailing sentiment of the North. I say so because there\r\nis no disposition at the North to interfere with it. Do we believe\r\nthat we can manage slavery better than you? No, sir! I believe that we\r\ncould not manage it so well. If we had been reared on your soil in the\r\nmidst of slavery, we could manage it just as well. It is a mistake and\r\na pernicious error, for the South to believe that either party at the\r\nNorth proposes to raise any question relating to slavery within State\r\nlimits. There is not a man at the North who could stand up long enough\r\nto fall down, if he should take such a position.\r\n\r\nThere are problems connected with slavery which we cannot solve; we do\r\nnot wish to undertake their solution. We will leave them with you.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, should we do? My answer is, live along as we have done\r\nbefore. We will live with you in the Union, under a Constitution that\r\nrequires us to help you keep the peace. Where you dwell, we will\r\ndwell. Your people shall be our people, and where you die, we will\r\ndie. Our Constitution is good enough for a people who are wise enough\r\nto live under it. With such a Constitution, Virginia proposes to leave\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nWill you leave the Union because the Constitution has not been rightly\r\nconstrued? No; for it has been construed to your entire satisfaction.\r\nIt has been made to speak your views. The judges of our Supreme Courts\r\nrepresent your opinions. There has never been a construction of the\r\nConstitution adverse to your interests. The Dred Scott decision\r\nprotects slavery in all the territories according to your desire,\r\nthough against our strong conviction of law and right. Will you leave\r\nthe Union because you have not had the Government your share of the\r\ntime? You have had possession and control of it for fifty years out\r\nof seventy-two; and during a large portion of the twenty-two years,\r\nwhen we have had the President from the free States, the\r\nadministration has been under the control of southern sentiments, and\r\nsouthern interests have been in the ascendency, through the servility\r\nof northern men. Do you leave the Union in order to secure the\r\nprotection of a better Constitution? No; for they who have left us\r\nhave said that the Constitution was well enough, if the people were\r\nsufficiently enlightened to live under it. Why is it, then, with all\r\nthese facts before you, that you propose to turn away from the\r\nGovernment of our fathers, from all the glories of the past, the\r\nblessings of the present, and the hopes of the future, to hunt for new\r\nand better things under a new Government?\r\n\r\nYou are going out of the Union because you say we propose to immolate\r\nyou--to turn you over to the mercies of a Government of slaves set\r\nfree. How unfounded is such a belief! Are we not brothers still? I\r\ndoubt whether there was a better feeling between the masses of the\r\nNorth toward you ten or seventy years ago than there is to-day. Can\r\nyou find better fortunes elsewhere? Where do you propose to go? To the\r\ndoubtful fortunes of a Southern Confederacy? You certainly are not\r\nacting with your accustomed prudence and forethought. You know what\r\nthe teachings of history are in relation to nations in that belt of\r\nlatitude. You know how they have always compared with northern\r\nnations. Together the two sections may be prosperous and powerful;\r\nseparated you can judge where the advantage must fall. Had we not\r\nbetter try and get along as we are?\r\n\r\nThis Conference presents some singular scenes. Although made up, so\r\nfar as the North is concerned, of members of both political parties,\r\nyet, by a majority, it supports southern views of southern interests\r\nas earnestly and emphatically as any southern man has done. In all\r\nconflicts of the past and present you have carried your points, and\r\nyou have reason to think you may do so in future. Yet you insist upon\r\nseparation. Be assured, you will experience as bitter feuds among\r\nyourselves as you do in the fellowship of those you leave. You cannot\r\nbe reconciled to even the existence of a minority against you, but you\r\nwill find you cannot escape the minorities, and may fall into one\r\nyourselves. You propose to join the fortunes of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, in which, there is a contention already. You turn your\r\nbacks upon the Government of the Father of his Country, whose portrait\r\nis before us, and join your fortunes to a mere southern nationality.\r\nBeware of the act. Look back over the last two thousand years, and\r\ncontrast the stability of governments in southern latitudes with those\r\nmore northern, under latitudes which you leave. Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica, and South America, furnish valuable lessons on this\r\nContinent, while the Eastern Hemisphere is, in this respect, full of\r\ninstruction. Will you leave a people whose character and habits are\r\nlike those which have produced the permanence and power of Russia,\r\nFrance, and England, and ally yourselves to those more southern people\r\nwho have not hitherto enjoyed stability, power, or happiness? Is it\r\nnot wiser to stay where you are, to scorn the pernicious doctrines of\r\nnew teachers, and to live and die under the flag of our fathers?\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas opened a Pandora's box of evil. Had not that\r\ntaken place, the Missouri Compromise would not have been repealed. Had\r\nnot that Compromise been repealed, the shadow of our present troubles\r\nwould not have arisen.\r\n\r\nYou speak of the opposition of the North to slavery. Believe us or\r\nnot, it is true, nevertheless, that slavery is regarded at the North\r\nas strictly a State institution; as such, we are content to let it\r\nremain; we desire to let it remain such. But let not the North be\r\nmisunderstood in its position. The North is willing to let slavery\r\nremain where it is--where our fathers left it; but against its\r\nextension into the territories, the North is inflexibly and\r\nunalterably opposed.\r\n\r\nIf there is any thing to pacificate I am in favor of pacification, but\r\nin favor of it according to the Constitution. The Constitution\r\nembraces all that any State can reasonably ask or honorably concede.\r\nBut if from change of circumstances or other causes, the men of the\r\nSouth are of the opinion that their interests are overlooked or\r\nill-defined, I, for one, will favor a call of a convention to consider\r\namendments to the Constitution, and I will vote for such amendments as\r\nshall give as substantial protection to the South as the North ought\r\nto ask for, in the change of circumstances.\r\n\r\nI submitted an address and resolutions a few days since for adoption\r\nin this Convention, which I hope may be carefully read before being\r\nrejected. They contemplated a convention, and their design is to give\r\nassurance of justice to the public. I oppose the proposition for an\r\naddress by the committee, to be issued to the public after our\r\nadjournment. We wish to know beforehand what we adopt, and to weigh\r\nevery word. There is a northern sentiment to be regarded as well as a\r\nsouthern sentiment.\r\n\r\nWe of the North have heard much said in denunciation of us, and have\r\nthought it political clap-trap and gasconade. But if we are made to\r\nbelieve in your hostility to us and the Government, we may conclude it\r\nis best to let you leave us. We have no fears in trusting ourselves,\r\nif necessary, to our industry, our habits, and enterprise, separate\r\nfrom the slaveholding States. Opinions are changing rapidly. I do not\r\nlike the idea of maintaining the Union by force of arms. It is not in\r\naccordance with the theory of our Government.\r\n\r\nA Virginian stated only a few days ago, that there was nothing which\r\nthe South could ask or that the North could give, that was not found\r\nin the Constitution. But you say that we do not understand it\r\nalike--that the two sections differ in their construction of it. Well,\r\nif that is so, we are willing to submit to the courts.\r\n\r\nYou have always fared well enough there. If that is not enough we will\r\nleave the whole subject, amendments and all, to a General Convention.\r\nThat we now propose. We propose it fairly, not for any purpose of\r\ndelay or postponement. Call the convention as early as it can be done.\r\nWe will aid you. We will go home and in good faith urge our people to\r\ngo into the convention, and there patiently and fairly consider all\r\nyour claims, all your complaints. We would urge them to concede all\r\nthey can without a sacrifice of principle. We will do this as a party,\r\nand with all our strength. Now, this does not quite come up to what\r\nyou want, but is it best for you to insist upon breaking up the\r\nGovernment on that ground? That is neither sensible nor safe. We are\r\nlike two lobes in the same skull; one cannot outlive the other.\r\nDestroy one and you destroy the other. I do not believe this Republic\r\ncan stand without the Union which our fathers made. But it will\r\nstand--it must stand. Wise counsels will yet prevail. You will yet\r\nbelieve us sincere in our desires to relieve you. The end of the\r\nUnion has not come--it is not coming. The Union will yet outlive us\r\nand our posterity.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--In rising to express briefly my views, I feel\r\noppressed and embarrassed in view of the magnitude of the subjects we\r\nare discussing, and in the presence of this distinguished auditory. I\r\ncannot claim to represent an Empire State with its four millions of\r\npeople, nor a Bay State, which we are told, with its wealth, its\r\nenterprise, and its commerce, can settle a new State every year. But\r\nwith my colleagues, I represent a State which performed her part in\r\nthe dark night of the Revolution--her share in that great struggle for\r\nour priceless institutions--a State which has ever since been faithful\r\nin the discharge of all her constitutional obligations. In that bloody\r\nconflict, upon her own soil, New Jersey joined hands with the North\r\nand South. There is scarcely a church spire within her borders beneath\r\nwhose shadows does not lay the remains of some of the entombed\r\npatriots in that great conflict from both these sections, commingled\r\nwith those of her own sons!\r\n\r\nNew Jersey was true to the Union in that great struggle--she has\r\nalways since been true; and under the favor of Providence she always\r\nwill be faithful to the Union and its memories, so inseparably\r\nconnected with the glory and honor of her sons. Other States may have\r\ndone as much, may have as good a record, may be entitled to equal\r\ncredit with her. But in all her past history, I can point to her\r\nfidelity to the Union and her sister States with no blush of shame\r\nupon my brow. Other States might be wanting! New Jersey never! She has\r\nalways been true to her constitutional obligations; she has always\r\nkept--never sought to avoid them.\r\n\r\nWith a narrow stream separating her from a slaveholding State, there\r\nwere never any underground railroads in New Jersey; she never rescued\r\na fugitive slave from the custody of the law; no _personal liberty_\r\nbill ever disgraced the pages of her statutes, nor ever will disgrace\r\nthem. In 1793 she enacted a statute providing for the prompt return of\r\nfugitive slaves found within her limits. She subjected any judge\r\nrequired to act under it, to imprisonment, if he neglected to perform\r\nhis duties. That law has ever since been in force. It was reënacted in\r\n1836, and again in 1846, when some of its defects were amended.\r\nCourteous as just, she provided by another law, passed in 1820, that\r\nany southern gentleman visiting her territory, might bring with him\r\nhis household slaves, travel in, through, and out of the State, or\r\neven take up his temporary residence as securely in this respect as at\r\nhome. This law was reënacted in 1847, and again in 1855; one of my\r\nworthy colleagues here was associated, upon the commission which\r\nrevised this act, with that distinguished New Jersey Republican,\r\nWILLIAM L. DAYTON.\r\n\r\nIn the recent unhappy political contest, New Jersey, ever anxious to\r\ndo justice to all sections of the Union, and injustice to none, as if\r\nhesitating and doubtful toward which of the two parties in that\r\nstruggle she ought to incline, extended her fraternal hands to North\r\nand South, by giving one-half her electoral vote to each; thus showing\r\nthat she still retains her unselfish spirit, which leads her to\r\nsacrifice her own preferences to her duty to the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit to-day she bears her full share of the heavy sorrow\r\nthat rests, like a pall, over the people of the whole country as they\r\nwitness this glorious fabric, which our fathers erected and cemented\r\nwith their blood and their prayers--trembling, shattered, and\r\ndismembered. In the conciliatory spirit of my State, I, as a\r\nJerseyman, proud of the title and every thing connected with it, wish\r\nto say a word to the South in all frankness and candor. I freely tell\r\nyou that, in my opinion, you have a right to guarantees, and to\r\nconstitutional guarantees. It is no answer to say that the\r\nConstitution has not been broken. That is not the question now.\r\nReference has been made to the fact that WASHINGTON signed the present\r\nConstitution. Yes, but when he did so we had a population of but three\r\nmillions, and now we have a population of upward of thirty millions.\r\nIs it surprising that some change should be required in that\r\ninstrument with this great change in the nation? The balance of power\r\nso long fluctuating between the free and the slaveholding States has\r\nat length entirely changed. It has now come to us of the free States,\r\nand therefore we are bound to respect the claims of the South, and\r\nquiet the apprehensions of its people.\r\n\r\nIt is of little use to make patriotic speeches here. The South demands\r\nguarantees, and I feel under obligations to respond to that demand. I\r\nassert as a general principle, that whoever has a right is entitled\r\nto have it guaranteed. I believe there is not a gentleman here, who,\r\nin his heart, does not think so. If it is right for them to have these\r\nguarantees at all, they should have them to-day. I do not care whether\r\nVirginia occupies a menacing attitude or not, my moral code is still\r\nthe same; it is not effected by any thing that has been done or can be\r\ndone by Virginia or any other State. It is my belief that\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the people of the North to-day are in favor of\r\ngiving to the South all the guarantees it asks against all\r\ninterference with slavery in the territories. Some say, \"We admit\r\nthis, but we will do nothing until the Republican President is\r\ninaugurated on the 4th of March.\" I am ready to do it now; and my\r\nobligations to do right will not be changed by the 4th of March\r\nrolling over my head.\r\n\r\nGentlemen have made eloquent and patriotic speeches asserting their\r\ndetermination not to interfere with the rights of the South. That is\r\nvery pleasant and very proper. But those speeches are the expressions\r\nof individuals, and they pass away. Where is the man who will consent\r\nto hold any political right at the will of any man or class of men, no\r\nmatter how kindly disposed? We all require security. The highest and\r\ngrandest aim and object of government is not the stability and peace\r\nof society, but a well-grounded confidence in the minds of the people\r\nof the perpetuity of that stability and peace.\r\n\r\nThe South asks the right to use and occupy a portion of the common\r\nterritory of the country. As a northern man I will accept the\r\ncompromise, and I believe a large majority of the people will agree\r\nwith me. You, gentlemen of the South, have asked that the arrangement\r\nmay be extended to territory hereafter to be acquired. New Jersey has\r\nvoted in this Convention against interference with slavery in the\r\nterritory, present or future, and she is the only northern State that\r\nhas cast her vote in favor of your demand. Her representatives have\r\nbeen told somewhat sneeringly, that while slaveholding States voted\r\nagainst this proposition, New Jersey was the only free State that\r\nvoted for it. Well, we accept the responsibility, and will bear it.\r\nNew Jersey has made up her record. There it stands, and there let it\r\nstand forever. We are proud of it. If civil war is to come, if this\r\nland is to be deluged with fraternal blood, when that time comes\r\nthere will not be a northern State represented here that would not\r\ngive untold millions to be placed upon that record by the side of New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, sir, we have acquired our liberties too cheaply. Had we\r\npurchased them at the cost our fathers did, by coloring the snows of\r\nwinter by our blood tracks, and by passing the summers in the\r\nunhealthy morass, we should have learned to prize them more highly; we\r\nshould be more patriotic and less proud, more sensible and less\r\nsensitive.\r\n\r\nA word further on the subject of extending this provision to territory\r\nhereafter acquired. Gentlemen, you do not want that provision; you do\r\nnot need any provision as to future acquisitions. You are better off\r\nwithout it. No present rights are involved in it. You are providing\r\nfor a contingency which may never, and probably never will happen.\r\nWould it not be inconsistent for a nation to commit suicide because a\r\nconstitution is not made to meet an improbable contingency? You have\r\nterritory enough for the next two hundred years. You say you require\r\nit to maintain your honor, to preserve your fair equality, to maintain\r\nyour lawful rights. Permit me to say you have no rights in territory\r\nwhich we never owned, and I hope never may. This is no question of\r\nhonor or equality. But if we should acquire territory and should then\r\nexclude you from it, will it not then be time enough to resort to the\r\nexpedient of national suicide as a remedy for the wrong? Nor do you\r\nrequire it for any particular purpose. You have within your States\r\nroom for all the increase of a century. Your interest is to retain\r\nyour sons at home and develop the wealth and advance the prosperity of\r\nyour States, and not to send them to the western wilderness where\r\none-half die in the process of acclimation. The fact that you are all\r\nin favor of placing in the Constitution new _restrictions_ as to the\r\n_acquisition_ of territory, proves you do not consider you need more\r\nterritory. I heard it said, the other day, by a gentleman from\r\nVirginia, that the South wanted the provision for a finality, to end\r\nforever this dispute about slavery. With all my heart I sympathize\r\nwith him in his desire to end this discussion forever. You think you\r\nhave suffered from these discussions at the South; so have we at the\r\nNorth. It has separated families and neighborhoods; it has broken up\r\nand scattered Christian churches; it has severed every benevolent\r\nsociety of the land; it has destroyed parties; it broke up the good\r\nold Whig party, and more recently sapped the strength and vigor from\r\nthe Herculean Democracy. It now threatens the dissolution of the\r\nUnion. Let us crush the head of the monster forever. Let us do it by\r\nrestricting and defining its limits in existing territory.\r\n\r\nSuppose the word \"future\" had been inserted. You do not wish to\r\ndestroy all probability of the adoption of this proposition at the\r\nNorth. These proposals could not pass Congress, with the word\r\n\"future,\" by the requisite vote; and if it passed Congress, there is\r\nno hope that twenty-five out of twenty-eight States would have adopted\r\nit. With it you would have given great strength to the opposition at\r\nthe North. It would have created a more powerful anti-slavery party\r\nthan ever before existed. No, you are better off by confining the\r\nprovisions of this compromise to present territory--you having, as\r\nwell as the North, in the contemplated amendment a veto on the\r\nacquisition of territory.\r\n\r\nThe North will want new territory before you will desire it. They will\r\ndemand Mexico and Cuba for the advantages of trade. You then, having\r\nthe veto power, can say to them--No, gentlemen, we will not agree to\r\nit unless our particular institution is there respected; or, if you\r\nplease, you may go further and say, We will not acquiesce unless this\r\nterritory comes in as a slave State so as to restore measurably the\r\nbalance of power in the Government. With this veto power you would\r\nhave the North in your hands, and could make your own terms. You make\r\nthe provision more of a finality by letting it stand as it is.\r\n\r\nBut gentlemen say, they want the amendment for another purpose, in\r\norder that they may induce States that have gone out to return. Here,\r\nagain, I sympathize with you. I had rather bring back South Carolina\r\nthan to secure the annexation of both the Canadas. I would give more\r\nfor one American than for a regiment of John Bulls. Ungenerous as\r\nSouth Carolina has been, I would receive her home again. I desire the\r\nStates to return. Let their place at the Federal Board remain vacant\r\nfor them. Let the stars of their sovereignty on our nation's ensign\r\nremain unobliterated and without further dishonor. We are ready to\r\nreceive them. But this provision as to future territory is not\r\nnecessary for their return. The same considerations to which I have\r\nalluded, and which, will satisfy you that such provision is not\r\nrequisite, will satisfy them. The guarantees which the North are ready\r\nto give as to the representation, taxation, and return of property,\r\nand the compromise as to the existing territory, will do much to\r\nsatisfy them. To effect a compromise, you of the South must demand as\r\nlittle as you can render satisfactory to your people, and we of the\r\nNorth must give as much as our people will approve, and both parties\r\nmust consent to avoid all objectionable phraseology.\r\n\r\nNow, a few words to my friends of the North. There is resting upon us\r\na grave responsibility. We are bound to settle this question finally\r\nin this Convention. Talk about a convention of the people! We who have\r\nno constitution, we who are tied up to no technicalities, must settle\r\nit. We of the North may meet political death; but let political death\r\ncome, it is enough to have lived for, if we can settle this question.\r\n\r\nBut one asks, Will you strike hands with treason, and enter into\r\ncompacts with rebels and traitors? Yes, sir! I will strike hands with\r\njust such rebels and traitors as I see around me; and I would give\r\nthem what they ask as cheerfully and as freely as I would give a glass\r\nof water to a soldier returning wounded and weary from the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nBut it is said we must first see whether we have a Government. We must\r\ntry the strength of the Government. We must know whether the\r\nGovernment can assert its supremacy and compel obedience to its laws.\r\nSir, that is just what I do not want to try. What, try the strength of\r\nthe Government! and do so at the end of an administration in which\r\ncorruption and treason and every evil principle have been contending\r\nfor the mastery, when our ships are all away beyond sea, when our arms\r\nand our fortifications are out of our hands, when our treasury is\r\nbankrupt, our people divided, insolvency and ruin threatening our\r\ncountry, and all the Gulf States defying the authority of the\r\nGovernment? No, sir! this is no time to try the strength of the\r\nGovernment. When we do that, let us select some more auspicious\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBut another says these proposals of amendment contravene the Chicago\r\nplatform. What if they do? Is the Chicago platform a law to us? Is it\r\na law to any one? It was passed upon ten minutes' consideration in a\r\nconvention of five thousand people. If it was a law, the convention\r\nshould have been perpetual and never dissolved, in order that the law\r\nmight have been subject to requisite modifications without a change of\r\ncircumstances. A strange manner in which to enact such a law! But\r\nthings have changed since the Chicago Convention. In fifty days, fifty\r\nyears of history have transpired. This is enough to release us from\r\nthe obligation, if any existed. It is not a law; it is a doctrine, the\r\nspirit, the policy of the party that it undertakes to enunciate. It is\r\nnot a law, because a majority of the people have never given it their\r\nsanction. Mr. Lincoln was elected by less than a majority. And in his\r\nvote how many old Whigs and Democrats may be counted who did not\r\nsupport him _because_ he stood upon the Chicago platform, but because\r\nthey preferred him to either of the opposing candidates. And even if\r\nit is a law, I call upon the North to support the proposals of\r\namendment here submitted. Let us, as Republicans, be honest, and when\r\nthe opportunity offers are we not bound so to change the Constitution\r\nthat three-fourths of all our present territory, now open to slavery,\r\nshall be consecrated to freedom? Yes, we are bound to relieve that\r\nthree-fourths from slavery. All we need to do to secure this, is not\r\nto carry slavery where it is not, but to secure it where it is. I can\r\ngo home to the Republicans of New Jersey with a clear conscience and\r\nsay to them, that by our action here we have not carried slavery one\r\ninch farther than it was before. If they are not satisfied with that,\r\nthey must be dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nBut there is one plank in the Chicago platform to which I will call\r\nthe attention of my Republican friends. It must not be forgotten. I\r\nread from a genuine copy which I brought from Chicago myself.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That to the Union of the States, this nation\r\n     owes its unprecedented increase in population, its\r\n     surpassing development of internal resources, its rapid\r\n     augmentation of wealth, its happiness at home and its honor\r\n     abroad, and we hold in abhorrence all schemes of disunion,\r\n     come from whatever source they may.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a rule of construction, that all parts of an instrument must be\r\nconstrued together; that due regard and effect must be given to all\r\nparts of it, unless they are clearly repugnant. Will any gentleman\r\ntell me how the Union can be more effectually preserved than by\r\ncontrolling disunion? It is by granting what is asked to those who\r\nmight disturb its tranquillity, when they ask nothing unreasonable.\r\nThis resolution every patriot can subscribe to; and I hold that it can\r\nbe as effectually violated by the neglect to do all we can to turn\r\naside disunion, as by affirmative action against the Government. And\r\nlet me say that the party in this country which goes between the\r\npeople and the preservation of the Union, will sink so low,\r\neventually, that a bubble will not return to mark the spot where it\r\nwent down. But I cannot understand how any one who is honestly opposed\r\nto the extension of slavery, as a political institution, can refuse\r\nthe compromise proposed. The federal courts, to which we have\r\ncommitted the power, have decided that slavery, of right, goes into\r\nall the territories. The distinguished Republican from Massachusetts\r\nhas told us that the court cannot be so organized, even if we keep the\r\npower, as to change that decision in twenty-five years. In that time\r\nthe whole question will be determined. Now we have an opportunity, at\r\nonce and forever, by constitutional enactment, to prohibit slavery\r\nfrom going into three-fourths of the territory, by simply agreeing\r\nthat as to the other one-fourth, while it remains a territory, the\r\n_status_ of slavery shall not be changed. I confess I have not the\r\ningenuity to contrive how I should apologize to an audience of\r\nRepublicans for refusing such a contract.\r\n\r\nNow, what can we of the North, we Republicans, do? By a settlement\r\nhere we can retain the Border States, and, in my opinion, that is\r\nequivalent to saving the Union. Retain the Border States and the\r\nseceding States must come back. If the Border States go, I believe war\r\nis inevitable. How can two sections exist with only an imaginary line\r\nbetween them. I do not believe the South will ever consent to give up\r\nthe Capital, claimed to be within her borders, and the North could\r\nnever surrender it. Sir, I shrink from the prospect of civil war. The\r\npicture of civil war has often been painted, and by abler hands than\r\nmine. Its calamities and miseries, the sufferings that attend it,\r\nstrike a chill of horror to the soul. But such a picture as a civil\r\nwar in this country would be, has never been drawn. History would be\r\nsearched in vain for its parallel. A civil war between the members of\r\na family, between brother and brother, father and son, who have all\r\nenjoyed the same blessings which their fathers made early and bloody\r\nsacrifices to secure! Shall it be said that such a people, for such a\r\ncause, risked their interests, their country, their all, and rushed\r\nblindly into the calamities of a civil war? He has read history to\r\nlittle account who has not learned that such a warfare is, in its\r\nnature, not only cruel, but protracted. It is like letting loose the\r\nhurricane. Passion and poverty, carnage and crime, desolation and\r\ndeath, become the condition of a hitherto happy people. For thirty\r\nyears Germany was ravaged, and millions slain by a contest occasioned\r\nby a difference in religious opinions. For more than thirty years the\r\nwar of the Roses devastated England. The French Revolution, including\r\nthe \"Reign of Terror\"--originating in a question of taxation and\r\nterminating with the supremacy of Napoleon--lasted nearly ten years.\r\nFor a like decade civil war raged between England and Scotland,\r\noriginating in a question of authority between the King and Commons,\r\nand ending in Cromwell's protectorate. Why, I ask, if we admit this\r\nfiendish visitant to our borders, should we anticipate that our fate\r\nwould be more favorable? No! war is to be averted, and a nation still\r\ncovered with glory is to be preserved by holding the Border States in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked what I would do; I answer, Compromise--compromise! Two\r\ngentlemen cannot live in a parlor together a single day without\r\nreciprocal compromises. I would not be \"stiff in the back and firm in\r\nthe knees.\" There is such a thing as too much \"backbone.\" I say I\r\nwould \"back down\" to save the country. I am not ashamed of the\r\nexpression. Our Government itself was a compromise, and in nothing\r\nmore so than as to the slavery question. HENRY CLAY was the great\r\ncompromiser. The Missouri Compromise was his. Resigning his office as\r\nSpeaker, on the floor of Congress by irresistible argument, and\r\neloquence unequalled--though twice defeated, he succeeded in\r\nestablishing the compromise line of 36° 30´--and thereby erected a\r\nbarrier which severed the angry currents of opinion on this\r\ndistracting theme, and which was as valuable to this nation as the\r\nisthmus at the equator, holding in check the mighty ocean on either\r\nside. The North has compromised before; let her do it again. Let our\r\nfriends at the South take as little as they can, and let the North\r\nyield as little as she can, but let us come together. The party that\r\nstands between the people and the preservation of the Government will\r\nbe crushed to atoms. It will be remembered in history only with curses\r\nand indignation.\r\n\r\nWe all love this Union, and we mean to preserve it. There is no one\r\nhere who, as he has witnessed the freedom, the comfort, the\r\nprosperity, and the pure religion disseminated among the people, has\r\nnot hoped this nation was to accomplish great social and moral good\r\nfor our whole race. Yes, in fond conception we have seen her the\r\nLiberator and Equalizer of the world--walking like an angel of light\r\nin the dark portions of the earth. These sacred anticipations may not\r\nbe disappointed without a fearful accountability somewhere. And, sir,\r\nsuffer me to say that this whole people have a strong regard for each\r\nother, notwithstanding the petulant differences which have arisen\r\nbetween us. Kindred blood flows in our veins, and that of our fathers\r\nmingles on the same field; and even now, in the day of our country's\r\nperil, our affections meet at the hallowed grounds of Mt. Vernon, of\r\nMarshfield, and of Ashland.\r\n\r\nWe have our history. WASHINGTON and FRANKLIN, and HENRY and SUMTER, as\r\nwell as Bunker Hill, and Yorktown, and Trenton, are yours, and they\r\nare all ours.\r\n\r\nWe have our religion--and with every diurnal revolution of this\r\nsphere, from North and South, through the efficacy of a common faith,\r\na goodly company are ascending to that realm of peace where their\r\nharmonious union shall never more be severed. And to-day, from a\r\nthousand hearthstones in the sunny South, and in the more rigid North,\r\nthe family prayer ascends to the Father of us all, for a blessing on\r\nour common country and for the preservation of this Union. Those\r\nprayers will be heard, and this priceless Union will be preserved.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I wish to call the attention of the Conference for a\r\nmoment to another subject, in order that members may give it their\r\nconsideration. I shall call up my motion to terminate the debate upon\r\nthe report of the committee early to-morrow, and ask to have the\r\ndiscussion closed on the 21st instant. I am sure that I shall be\r\nsustained in this by every member who wishes to have this body come to\r\nany agreement. I wish to have the vote taken on the _twenty-second day\r\nof February_, that we may see whether the same day that gave a\r\nWASHINGTON to our Fathers, may not give PEACE to their posterity.\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--I have listened with intense interest to the addresses\r\nwhich have recently been made to the Conference. I respect the ability\r\nwhich they have exhibited--I honor the patriotism which has produced\r\nthem. They have presented the important principles involved in the\r\naction of this Conference in a much more interesting and forcible\r\nmanner than I could; and I would not occupy the attention of this body\r\nwith a single observation, if I had the good fortune to be associated\r\nwith a delegation in which unanimity of opinion and feeling prevailed.\r\nBut I am not so fortunate. In that delegation I find many shades of\r\nopinion. I respect the views of my brother delegates. It is not for me\r\nto assume to sit in judgment upon them. I give each one of them credit\r\nfor the same honesty and integrity which I claim for myself; and if I\r\nhappen to differ from them, I claim that such difference honestly\r\narises from the different paths in life which we pursue, which may\r\nlead us to take different views of the same subjects as they are here\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe Conference has heard the ideas of political and professional men\r\nexpressed upon the important questions now presented for its\r\nconsideration. These ideas have been well expressed, and we have all\r\nbeen interested in hearing them. Will you now hear a few words from a\r\nbody of men who have hitherto been silent here, but who have a deep\r\nand abiding interest in the happiness and prosperity of the country\r\nand in the preservation and perpetuity of the American Union?\r\n\r\nSir! I am here as a plain merchant, out of place, I very well know, in\r\nsuch a Conference as this; but accident has brought me here, and I\r\nwill tell you how and why I came. Three weeks ago I left my\r\nbusiness--which in times like these certainly deserves all my\r\nattention--to come to the city of Washington on business of a public\r\ncharacter. I came at the suggestion and request of the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of New York, hoping, in my humble way, to serve the public\r\ninterests in this crisis. Inconvenient though it was, and involving\r\npersonal sacrifices of no ordinary character, when others thought my\r\ncountry had need of my poor services, I did not hesitate to respond to\r\nher call. And I hope I may never hesitate under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nI came here to visit Congress, as a member of a committee, bearing a\r\npetition to that body signed by more than thirty-nine thousand of my\r\nfellow-citizens, all interested in the welfare and permanence of this\r\nGovernment. This number included more than twenty thousand business\r\nmen and firms. This petition was earnest and emphatic. In it, we asked\r\nand prayed that Congress would adopt some plan that would settle our\r\npresent sectional troubles; that would relieve the country from the\r\nanxiety and apprehension which pervaded it, and permit business and\r\ncommerce to resume their accustomed channels, with assurances of\r\nsafety in the future. We knew that the time had arrived when patriotic\r\nmen must act; that commercial and financial ruin was impending. Our\r\npetition set forth, that in the opinion of the signers, the plan\r\ncontained in what were called the \"Border State Resolutions\" was best\r\ncalculated to secure the end desired. We thought those resolutions\r\nought to be satisfactory to the reasonable and true Union men of the\r\nSouth, and that they ought not to be obnoxious to the prejudices or\r\nobjections of the people of the free States. Still we were not\r\nstrenuous--we were not committed to any particular plan. All we\r\ndesired, was to secure such action on the part of Congress and the\r\nExecutive, as would satisfy the country; such action as would give the\r\ncountry peace.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Washington we met _seventy_ republican members of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives. We had with them a most\r\nsatisfactory and delightful interview. It gave me renewed hope for my\r\ncountry and her interests when I heard the expressions of conciliation\r\nand good will which these gentlemen used; I felt my confidence\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nBesides these gentlemen, who met and heartily coöperated with us,\r\nthere were several members from the Border States whose expressions\r\nwere not less friendly, although they did not think it expedient to\r\nact with us. Our committee made all the representations and\r\nexplanations which were deemed necessary; and having performed my duty\r\nin that connection, in the earnest hope that we had influenced the\r\naction of Congress in the right direction, I was about to return home\r\nwith my colleagues, when I received a telegraphic despatch requesting\r\nme to attend the meeting of this Conference. I obeyed the summons; and\r\nsince I received it, I have been laboring with all the ability,\r\nstrength, and power with which GOD has blessed me, to secure the\r\nadoption of some plan here, that would settle our difficulties and\r\navert from our beloved country the evils with which she is now\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nSir, there has not one moment passed since I came here, during which I\r\nhave not felt a deep and overpowering sense of the grave\r\nresponsibility which rests upon myself and the other members of this\r\nConference. I am accustomed to the trials, vexations, cares, and\r\nresponsibilities of business; I know how to meet and grapple with them\r\ncalmly. But I do not feel so here. My days are anxious and excited--my\r\nnights are wakeful and sleepless. In all the weary watches of last\r\nnight, I could not close my eyes in slumber. The reason was, because I\r\nsaw from a point of view which you do not, the certain and inevitable\r\nruin that is threatening the business, commercial interests of this\r\ncountry, and which is sure to fall with crushing force upon those\r\ninterests, unless we come to some arrangement here.\r\n\r\nI speak to you now as a business man--as a merchant of New York, the\r\ncommercial metropolis of the nation. I am no politician, I have no\r\ninterest except such as is common to the people. But let me assure\r\nyou, that even I can scarcely realize, much less describe, the\r\nstagnation which has now settled upon the business and commerce of\r\nthat great city, caused solely by the unsettled and uncertain\r\ncondition of the questions which we are endeavoring to arrange and\r\nsettle here.\r\n\r\nI tell you what I do not get from second hands, but what I know\r\nmyself, when I assure you that had not Divine Providence poured out\r\nits blessings upon the great West in an abundant harvest, and at the\r\nsame time opened a new market for that harvest in foreign lands,\r\nbringing it through New York in its transit, our city would now\r\npresent the silence and the quiet of the Sabbath day. Why is this? It\r\nis because we, who have lived together in harmony with each other, a\r\npowerful and a happy people, are breaking up--are preparing to\r\nseparate and go out from one another!\r\n\r\nThe merchants of our great commercial cities of Baltimore,\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and Boston, are not listless or unenterprising\r\nmen. They are accustomed to the interests, the bustle, the excitement\r\nof business. They have heretofore seen their stores crowded with\r\nbuyers. During the day the interiors of their places of business were\r\nlike busy hives. Not unfrequently have their clerks been obliged to\r\nlabor all through the night to secure and send off the goods which\r\nthey had sold to reliable customers during the day. When business is\r\ngood and driving throughout our commercial cities, wealth and comfort\r\nare secured to merchants and agents engaged in commerce in those\r\ncities, and it indicates general prosperity in the country to which\r\nthe goods purchased are transmitted. It shows a healthy condition of\r\naffairs both in city and country.\r\n\r\nHow stands the matter in those cities to-day? Now, just when the\r\nspring trade should be commencing, go to the extensive and magnificent\r\nestablishments for the sale of goods in any of the cities I have\r\nnamed, where goods are sold which in prosperous times found their way\r\ninto almost every family to a greater or less amount in this great\r\ncountry. What will you see in those cities now? The heavy stocks of\r\ngoods imported last autumn, or laid in from our own manufactories,\r\nremain undisturbed and untouched upon the shelves. The customers are\r\nnot there--they have not made their appearance. The few who have come\r\nat all, come not as buyers, but as debtors who cannot pay, and whose\r\nbusiness is not to make purchases but to arrange for extensions. The\r\nmerchants, in despair, are poring over their ledgers; checking off the\r\nnames of their insolvent debtors, a new list of whom comes by each\r\nday's mail. Their clerks sit around in idleness reading the\r\nnewspapers, or thinking mournfully of the wives and children at home,\r\nwho will go unclad and hungry if they are discharged from their\r\nplaces, as they know they must be, if this condition of things shall\r\ncontinue. All alike, employers and employed, with all dependent upon\r\nthem, are looking anxiously, and I wish I could say hopefully, to the\r\nCongress of the United States, or to this Conference, as the only\r\nsources from which help may come.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands and tens of thousands belonging to these classes\r\nall over the country who must have relief, or their ruin is\r\ninevitable. And then look at that other class, numerically larger,\r\nperhaps, certainly not less worthy of our regard, who are dependent\r\nupon these; I mean the mechanics, the day laborers, and those in turn\r\ndependent upon them. What are they to do? If some change does not\r\ncome, if something is not done again to start the wheels of commerce\r\nand business, what is to become of them?\r\n\r\nAnd look, too, at New England! She has latterly been the workshop of\r\nthe South and the West. She has furnished their people with her\r\nmanufactures--they have been her market. An excellent market, too,\r\nhave they furnished her; she has grown rich through their consumption.\r\nHow stands the matter with New England to-day? True, some of her shops\r\nare running, but many more are still. The noise of the loom, the\r\nrattle of the shuttle, have ceased in many of her factories, while\r\nothers are gradually discharging their operatives and closing their\r\nbusiness. But I will pursue this branch of the subject no farther. No\r\none acquainted with the facts, will deny that the whole country is\r\nupon the eve of such a financial crisis as it has never seen--that\r\nthis crisis will come as sure as that the sun will rise, unless we do\r\nsomething to avert it!\r\n\r\nWhat is it that has thus stopped the wheels of manufactures and\r\narrested the ordinary movements of commerce? What is it that has\r\nproduced this unusual and uncommon stagnation of business? What is it\r\nthat has driven away from the markets of the North those hitherto so\r\nwelcome to them? I do not propose to go into the history of these\r\nquestions. I will not attempt to enlarge upon the answers to them. I\r\ncan condense the answer into few words. It is because anxiety,\r\ndistrust, and apprehension, are universally prevailing. Confidence is\r\nlost. The North misunderstands the South--the South misunderstands the\r\nNorth. Neither will trust the other, and the consequences to which I\r\nhave adverted necessarily follow.\r\n\r\nI am a merchant. I am unused to public discussions or arguments, but I\r\nam a business man, and I take a business view of this subject. I can\r\nsee as clearly as I can see the sun at noonday the causes of our\r\npresent embarrassment. I believe I can see equally clear how those\r\ncauses may be removed.\r\n\r\nWe have come here for a grand and lofty purpose. What nobler work can\r\nengage the mind of a true patriot than that of devising the means of\r\nsaving his country when it is in peril? That work is ours. In\r\nperforming it, are we not acting under a grave and solemn\r\nresponsibility? We are, sir! The _people_ will hold us responsible for\r\nthe manner in which we perform this great trust. I know the people of\r\nthis country. They value this Union. They will make great sacrifices\r\nto save it. They will disregard politics and parties--they will cast\r\nplatforms to the winds of heaven, before they will place the Union in\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from New England in this Conference seem to be the most\r\nobstinate and uncompromising. They aver that they cannot agree to\r\nthese propositions because their adoption involves a sacrifice of\r\nprinciples--that New England is opposed to slavery, and will not\r\nconsent to put it into the Constitution, nor to its extension. They\r\nsay the people hate slavery, and will not for that reason accept these\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nI do not believe one word of this. I know the people of New England\r\nwell; they are true Yankees; they know how to get the dollars, and how\r\nto hold on to them when they have got them. They are a shrewd and\r\ncalculating as well as an enterprising people; they understand their\r\ninterests and will protect them. They will not sit quietly by and see\r\ntheir property sacrificed or reduced in value. Once show them that it\r\nis necessary to adopt these propositions of amendment in order to\r\nsecure the permanence of the Government, and to keep up the property\r\nand other material interests of the country, and they will adopt them\r\nreadily. You will hear no more said about slavery or platforms. They\r\nwill never permit this Government, which has contributed so much to\r\ntheir wealth and prosperity, to be sacrificed to a technicality, a\r\nchimera. The people of New England know how to take care of\r\nthemselves. Give them a chance, and they will settle all these points\r\nof difference in some peaceful way.\r\n\r\nI am not here to argue or discuss constitutional questions. That duty\r\nbelongs to gentlemen of the legal profession. I have lived under the\r\nConstitution. I venerate it and its authors as highly as any man here.\r\nBut I do not venerate it so highly as to induce me to witness the\r\ndestruction of the Government rather than see the Constitution amended\r\nor improved.\r\n\r\nI regret that the gentlemen composing the committee did not approach\r\nthese questions more in the manner of merchants or commercial men. We\r\nwould not have sacrificed our principles, but we would have\r\nagreed--have brought our minds together as far as we could; we would\r\nhave left open as few questions as possible. These we would have\r\narranged by mutual concessions.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I speak as a merchant; I have a deep and abiding\r\ninterest in my country and its Government. I love my country; my heart\r\nis filled with sorrow as I witness the dangers by which it is\r\nsurrounded. But I came here for _peace_. The country longs for peace;\r\nand if these proposals of amendment will give us peace, the prayer of\r\nmy heart is, that they may be adopted. Believing such will be their\r\neffect, I will vote for them. I would like to say much more, but I\r\nwill not occupy time that is now so valuable. Let us approach these\r\nquestions in a spirit of conciliation. Above all, let us agree upon\r\nsomething. Let us do the best we can, and then let us go home and ask\r\nthe people to approve our action. The people will approve it, and\r\ntheir approval will give us _peace_!\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH, of New York:--I did not propose to take any part in this\r\ndebate. The Conference is made up of men, many of whose names are\r\nhistorical, and are intimately connected with the history of the\r\ncountry. I preferred to leave the whole discussion to them.\r\n\r\nBut as we are all seeking a common end, there are some views which\r\nhave occurred to me that I thought should be presented, inasmuch as\r\nthey appear not to have engaged the attention of others. New York, I\r\nam aware, has occupied considerable time, and I owe an apology on her\r\npart for trespassing farther upon your time.\r\n\r\nWe are here in a family meeting. On one side Virginia thought the\r\nparent was so ill that the family ought to be called together. I\r\nthought yesterday that we were undergoing some family discipline--that\r\nNew York had in some way disgraced herself, and needed correction. I\r\ndid not know what she had done; but I supposed the reproof was\r\nadministered to her in a kindly spirit, though it was uncalled for.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed to us is, to be sure, a work of conciliation. But\r\ncall it by whatever name you may, nothing less is proposed than an\r\nalteration of the Constitution. When we are asked to alter a\r\nConstitution that was made by WASHINGTON and MADISON, under which the\r\ncountry has grown to wealth and happiness, we certainly ought to\r\napproach the subject with the utmost deliberation. If we were settling\r\nfamily differences only, we would deliberate. How much more should we\r\ndo so when we are dealing with the great principles which uphold our\r\nGovernment!\r\n\r\nIt is by great principles that nations are governed and their\r\ndestinies are shaped. The world is governed by ideas and not by\r\nmaterial interests. These facts must be kept distinctly in view by\r\nthose who take upon themselves the business of making constitutions.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that we are called here to settle the terms upon which\r\ncertain sectional differences are to be arranged. We ought, then,\r\nfirst to ascertain what is the extent--what the limit of these\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is agreed that no constitutional rights have\r\nyet been invaded. The occasion for fear is not what _has been_, but\r\nwhat _may be_ done. I suppose we are all alike tenacious of our\r\nrights, whether we derive them from the Constitution or from any other\r\nsource. The rights of the State are just as important to New York as\r\nto Virginia. But it is said that appearances exist that indicate an\r\nintention on our part to interfere with some of the institutions of\r\nthe South. We ask for the proof. None is forthcoming--nothing but the\r\nmost vague and indefinite suspicion.\r\n\r\nWe propose to give the most satisfactory and absolute guarantees on\r\nthat subject--the subject of interference with Southern\r\ninstitutions--even to put those guarantees into the Constitution. But\r\nthat is not satisfactory--we are told that we cannot be trusted. I\r\nshould hope that no Northern State could ever be truthfully required\r\nto admit that it had given cause for such an apprehension. But it is\r\nevident that this is not the real occasion of calling us together.\r\nWhat, then, is the occasion?\r\n\r\nIt is said, that certain sectional rights in the Territories must be\r\nsecured and guaranteed. In that view I desire to call the attention of\r\nthe Conference to two or three points in the plan of the proposed\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the scheme, it is this: It is proposed to divide our\r\npresent territory by the line of 36° 30´, with a view to have\r\nemigration from the free States go north, and from the slave States go\r\nsouth of that line. This is made in connection with a limitation\r\npreventing the acquisition of future territory. Now the first thing\r\nthat impresses me is the objection to placing any such restraints upon\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I think the gentleman misunderstands the report. I have\r\nseen no proposition that proposes to confine or restrain emigration.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I concede that there is no express provision restricting\r\nemigration, but such I think will be the effect of the amendments.\r\n\r\nBy the third section, Congress is prohibited, forever, from\r\ninterfering with the subject of slaves, and the sixth section makes\r\nthe others, with certain provisions of the Constitution as it now\r\nstands, irrepealable and unchangeable. No matter how much the\r\ncondition of the country may change; no matter if all but the most\r\ninconsiderable fraction of the people may desire to change them; these\r\npropositions must stand as long as this country stands, a part of its\r\nfundamental law.\r\n\r\nThese are the general provisions which the scheme contains. It is\r\noffered as a measure of peace; of conciliation; to calm and quiet the\r\nexisting excitement.\r\n\r\nI think I am right in saying that when you are making a constitution\r\nyou should consider all the conditions of the people who are to be\r\ngoverned by it; that you should keep in view all sections and\r\nopinions. It is my belief that instead of calming the excitement these\r\npropositions will aggravate it--will arouse it to a pitch it has never\r\nyet attained. I believe this, because the entire proposition goes\r\ncounter to the fundamental ideas upon which our Government is based.\r\n\r\nIt proposes to _establish_ slavery South. Is not this the first time\r\nin the history of the Constitution that it has ever been proposed, by\r\naffixing an article to that instrument, to _establish_--to _plant_\r\nslavery in territory which was free when it was acquired? The\r\nordinance of 1787 prohibited slavery from going into the territory\r\nwhich was acquired by it.\r\n\r\nIn similar language the article proposes to abolish slavery in the\r\nterritory north of the line. It is well to consider what is the legal\r\ncondition of that territory now. New Mexico and Arizona were free when\r\nwe first acquired them. Is not this provision wholly unnecessary? Mr.\r\nCLAY left such language out of the Missouri Compromise, as he avowed,\r\non the ground that slavery could not legally go into territory free\r\nwhen it was acquired, without the aid of affirmative legislation.\r\nPrevious and up to the year 1850, there was no difference of opinion\r\namong lawyers on this question. All agreed with Mr. CLAY.\r\n\r\nNow, slavery has gone into a portion of this territory; violently too;\r\nwithout such legislation. Limits are prescribed to it, it is true, but\r\n_it is there_, and in this way. _That_ is the _status_ which is to be\r\nrecognized, constitutionalized by these articles. I am aware that\r\nthere is a law of the territory that authorizes slavery, but slavery\r\nwent there without law, in spite of the opinions and opposition of Mr.\r\nCLAY.\r\n\r\nThis is shown by the debate of 1850. It is proposed now to convert the\r\nterritory south of the line of 36° 30´ into slave territory, and to\r\nmake that conversion irrevocable. Suppose these propositions had been\r\napplied at the moment the territory was acquired. Then certainly\r\nslavery would have been carried there by force of these articles\r\nalone. The principle would have been the same; one case being no\r\nstronger than the other.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, I shall not enter into any discussion of the merits or\r\ndemerits of the question in any other than its political aspects. I\r\nhave nothing to say respecting the morals of slavery. If there is\r\nvirtue in the institution, you have the credit of it; if there is sin,\r\nyou must answer for it. And here let me say that you discuss the moral\r\naspect of slavery much more than we do. We hold it to be strictly a\r\nState institution. So long as it is kept there, we have nothing to do\r\nwith it. It is only when it thrusts itself outside of State limits,\r\nand seeks to acquire power and strength by spreading itself over new\r\nground, that we insist upon our objections.\r\n\r\nWhatever the consequences may be, we should not conceal from each\r\nother the true condition of public opinion in our respective sections.\r\nA correct knowledge of this is essential and indispensable. It is in\r\nview of this opinion that our proposals should be framed, if they are\r\never to be adopted. The settled convictions of a people formed upon\r\nmature examination and experience, cannot be easily changed. This\r\nshould be understood at the outset.\r\n\r\nNow, I respectfully submit that no sentiment, no opinion ever took a\r\nfirmer hold of the Northern mind--ever struck more deeply into\r\nit--ever became more pervading, or was ever adopted after maturer\r\nconsideration, than this: That it is impolitic and wrong to convert\r\nfree territory into slave territory. With such convictions the North\r\nwill never consent to such conversion. Never! never!\r\n\r\nThis was the view of Mr. CLAY. His opinion always had great weight at\r\nthe North. Mr. CLAYTON, of Delaware, declared to the same purpose, and\r\navowed that Northern men could not be expected to consent to this. We,\r\nat least, know how this opinion is consecrated in the hearts of the\r\npeople of the North, and how idle it is for statesmen to run counter\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nWe are told by the gentleman from Maryland, that all the South wants\r\nis to have the force of the decision of the Supreme Court acknowledged\r\nas to that part of the territory south of the line, in consideration\r\nof which the South will yield what she gains by that decision in the\r\nterritory north; and also that we must do this, or the slave States\r\nwill be driven to join those States that have seceded. Now, it is due\r\nto frankness to say, that the North does not acquiesce in that\r\nstatement; that the point as made by the gentleman from Maryland, has\r\nbeen _decided_ by the Supreme Court. We know that the Chief Justice of\r\nthat court has expressed his own opinion that way; but we don't know\r\nthat it has been _decided_ by that court. But if it has been so\r\ndecided, the very ground of the decision is a misapprehension. If I\r\nrightly understand the language of Chief Justice TANEY, he insists\r\nthat the Constitution expressly affirms the right of property in\r\nslaves. I think it does not. The North thinks it does not.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SMITH then proceeded to discuss the facts in the Dred\r\n     Scott case, and the various opinions declared by the judges,\r\n     showing that the decision did not extend so far as claimed\r\n     by Mr. JOHNSON, and that the question of the _right_ to hold\r\n     slaves in the Territories was not presented by the record in\r\n     that case.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--There were two questions involved in the Dred Scott\r\ncase. One was, the authority of Scott to sue; the other was, upon the\r\nconstitutionality of the Missouri Compromise. Both these were decided\r\nin that case, and both were decided by the Supreme Court years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I am aware of the views taken by the gentleman from\r\nKentucky. I am stating as a matter of fact how this decision is\r\nregarded by a large portion of the people of the North. I am aware\r\nthat the Southern construction of the decision is different, and some\r\nat the North concur in it. I am trying to see how the majority\r\npropositions will suit the people who agree with the Northern view.\r\n\r\nI understand it is claimed that the court decided that slaves were\r\nproperty, and that the Constitution did not permit any restraint to be\r\nlaid upon the owners of that property in the Territories. Yes, the\r\ncourt did decide that the owner had the right to take his slaves into\r\nthe Territory and hold them there; and to that extent they were\r\nproperty. It is a prevalent idea at the North that the Southern\r\nconstruction of this decision is not fair, and that it would be\r\ndangerous to adopt it.\r\n\r\nWe do not subscribe to the doctrine that the Constitution expressly\r\naffirms the right of property in slaves. We may be wrong; it may be a\r\nmere misapprehension. But with their present opinions, the people of\r\nthe North will hesitate long before they make this express affirmation\r\na part of the organic _law_.\r\n\r\nAgain; if the Constitution affirms this right, and was understood to\r\ndo so by its framers, what was the need of the rendition clause? The\r\nConstitution is the supreme law in the free States as well as in the\r\nslave States. Under this construction the rights of the owner could\r\nhave been enforced like any other right of property in the courts of\r\nlaw, without any provision for the rendition of slaves.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the opinions that are entertained at the North. They\r\nmay be right or they may be wrong, but they have been deliberately\r\nadopted, and they prevail extensively. They cannot be changed by our\r\naction here. In all we do they must be respected. They are\r\n_constitutionally_ entertained.\r\n\r\nThis proposition to carry slavery into the Territories, opens the\r\ndiscussion of the merits of that institution. Gentlemen say they wish\r\nto stop the discussion; that there has been too much of it already;\r\nthat such a discussion would be especially unfortunate now. I do not\r\npropose to enter upon it here. But I desire to know in what manner you\r\ncould more effectually invite discussion than by placing your proposed\r\namendments before the people?\r\n\r\nYou must not forget that the people of the North believe slavery is\r\nboth a moral and a political evil. They recognize the right of the\r\nStates to have it, to regulate it as they please, without\r\ninterference, direct or indirect; but when it is proposed to extend it\r\ninto territory where it did not before exist, it becomes a political\r\nquestion, in which they are interested, in which they have a right to\r\ninterfere, and in which they will interfere. Such an attempt they\r\nconsider it their duty to resist by all constitutional means.\r\n\r\nThe establishing of slavery in the Territories is the practical\r\nexclusion of free labor in them. True, there is no direct provision\r\nfor the exclusion of free labor in your propositions, but such will\r\ncertainly be their effect. I appeal to gentlemen from the South to say\r\nfrom their own experience whether free labor _can_ be employed side by\r\nside with slave labor. This presents another consideration. You of the\r\nSouth ask us to guarantee a right which you say is very important and\r\nvery dear to you. You ask that your children may enter into and\r\npossess these new Territories. We know it. But the North asks the same\r\nprivilege. We want our children to go there, and live on the labor of\r\ntheir own free hands. They are excluded if slavery goes there before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT, the people of the North do understand, that we are in a\r\ncontest--a great and important contest. Yet it is one that can be\r\ncarried on without trampling upon each other's rights--without\r\nattempting to secure any unfair advantage. That is the way the North\r\nproposes to carry on this contest in relation to the _extension_ of\r\nslavery. This contest is between the owners of slaves on the one side,\r\nand all the _free men_ of this great nation on the other.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact that should be kept in view. The Territories are\r\nthe property not of the individual States, but of the General\r\nGovernment. They are held by the Government in trust, I grant. But in\r\ntrust for whom? For the whole _people_ of the Union; not in trust for\r\nthirty-four distinct States. The idea that these Territories are\r\nsubject to partition--that South Carolina has the right to demand her\r\nthirty-fourth part of them in severalty, is one that by the North\r\ncannot be entertained. It is this idea which has produced that other\r\nmore mischievous one--that an equilibrium must be maintained between\r\nthe free and the slave States; in other words, between freedom and\r\nslavery. Where did this idea creep into the Constitution? It never\r\nhas found, and it never will find, favor with the people of the North.\r\n\r\nWe may talk around this question--we may discuss its incidents, its\r\nhistory, and its effects, as much and as long as we please. And after\r\nall is said--disguise it as we may--it is a contest between the great\r\nopposing elements of civilization--whether the country shall be\r\npossessed and developed and ruled by the labor of slaves or of\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\nLeave it where it is, and all is well. We can live in peace while it\r\nis a State institution; extend it, and who can answer for the\r\nconsequences? Leave it where it is! I humbly suggest that in that\r\ndirection lays the only path of peace. So long as the Territories are\r\ncommon property, so long will the people insist upon protecting their\r\ninterests in them. In a Government like ours, conflicts will ensue.\r\nThe Constitution provides the proper and peaceful way of settling\r\nthem; and it is not by a partition of every subject in which a mutual\r\ninterest exists.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Does the gentleman consider this a nation, or a federal\r\nunion of States?\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--If I did not consider this a nation I should certainly not\r\nbe here.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Is not the whole machinery of the Government federative?\r\nIs not its whole action that of a confederation? Is not the recent\r\nelection of Mr. LINCOLN a proof of the fact? He was elected by less\r\nthan a majority of the people.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--In all the action of the Government with other\r\ngovernments, we are a nation as much as France or England. In every\r\nthing pertaining to the acquisition of territory we are a nation. The\r\nrights of the States are preserved in the Constitution, I admit, but\r\ntheir power is to be exercised subject to the powers reserved by the\r\nConstitution to the General Government. In all that respects these\r\npowers the Government is supreme.\r\n\r\nI have only sought to state some of the opinions which are\r\nconscientiously entertained at the North upon subjects connected with\r\nthese propositions. They _are_ entertained there, and they must be\r\nrespected by the Conference.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of the preservation of the balance of power is a new\r\ndoctrine. It was unknown to the framers of our Constitution. In my\r\nopinion it is a most mischievous doctrine to the country, and can only\r\nproduce the most pernicious results. It is closely akin to the\r\ndoctrine once broached in the Senate of a _duality_ of the Executive,\r\nwhich, extended, would require a President for every sectional\r\ninterest. Such ideas were never popular at the North. I do not think\r\nthey would operate very well in practice at the South.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--Will the gentleman give way for a motion to adjourn?\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. CLEVELAND the Conference adjourned to ten o'clock\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, THURSDAY, _February 21st, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by the President, at ten o'clock\r\nand fifteen minutes A.M., and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. STOCKTON.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday was read and approved.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--As I stated yesterday, I now wish to call up my\r\nresolutions relating to the termination of the debate, and to have a\r\nvote taken upon them.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--Will Governor WICKLIFFE permit me to make a formal motion,\r\nwhich cannot give rise to discussion? It is this: The resolutions\r\npassed by the Legislature of Ohio, under which myself and my\r\ncolleagues hold our seats, make it my duty to lay before the\r\nConference the resolves I now offer. I ask to have them read, laid\r\nupon the table, and printed.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were read, and the motion of Mr. CHASE concurred in.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions are as follow:--\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is inexpedient to proceed to final\r\n     action on the grave and important matters involved in the\r\n     resolutions of the State of Virginia, in compliance with\r\n     which this Convention has assembled, and in the several\r\n     reports of the majority and minority of the committee to\r\n     which said resolutions were referred, until opportunity has\r\n     been given to all of the States to participate in\r\n     deliberation and action under them, and ample time has been\r\n     allowed for such deliberation and action.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved, therefore_, That this Convention adjourn to meet\r\n     in the city of Washington, on the 4th day of April next; and\r\n     that the President be requested to address a letter to the\r\n     Governors of the several States not now represented in this\r\n     body, urging the appointment and attendance of\r\n     Commissioners.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I wish to state here that I do not concur in these\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I now offer two resolutions, one providing that debate\r\nshall cease upon the report of the committee, at 10 o'clock to-morrow.\r\nThe other, that five minutes shall be allowed to the mover of an\r\namendment to explain it, with five minutes to the committee to reply.\r\nUpon reflection, I will offer a third: That a motion to strike out and\r\ninsert shall not be divided. If desired, a vote may be taken on the\r\nresolutions separately, as I wish to have each stand upon its own\r\nmerits. I will not discuss these resolutions, for I think all must be\r\nimpressed with the necessity for passing them now.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were as follow:--\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, 1st, That at 10 o'clock, the 22d February, 1861,\r\n     all debate upon the report of the Committee of one from each\r\n     State shall cease, and the Convention will proceed to vote,\r\n     and continue to vote until the whole subject shall have been\r\n     disposed of.\r\n\r\n     2d. If an amendment be offered by the Commissioners of any\r\n     State, or the minority of such Commissioners, five minutes\r\n     is allowed for explanation, and the like time is allowed to\r\n     the committee to resist the amendment, if they desire to do\r\n     so; and the mover of the amendment, or any member of the\r\n     same State, may have five minutes for reply.\r\n\r\n     3d. A motion to strike out and insert shall not be divided.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I shall not debate these resolutions. As I am engaged\r\nin taking notes of the discussion, I cannot enter into a contest for\r\nthe floor, and I would not if I could. My State has not occupied a\r\nmoment of time on the general subject, nor are her delegates very\r\nanxious to address the Convention at all.\r\n\r\nWhether the Conference will give one of us a few minutes or not, is\r\nsimply a question of policy, of which I am not a disinterested judge.\r\nIt is possible that some suggestions might be made which would be\r\nworthy of attention.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I move to amend by inserting Saturday, instead of\r\nto-morrow, in the first resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--There is force in the remark of the gentleman from\r\nVermont. No State should be cut off. I suggest that the States whose\r\ndelegates have not addressed the Conference, should have the\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--I represent a youthful State. She is not\r\nthe daughter of any particular State or section, but of the Union. We\r\nMissourians love the Union, but we have fully arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the time has come when something must be done to\r\nprevent our entire separation. We have hitherto remained silent. We\r\ncame here to preserve the Union. Not that we love the Union less, but\r\nwe love our rights more. We love our rights more than the Union, our\r\nproperty, or our lives. We desire to come to a speedy adjustment. Ten\r\ndays of Congress only remain. It will be difficult even to introduce\r\nour propositions, still more to get them considered. I sustain the\r\nmotion of the gentleman from Kentucky; and Missouri will vote for it.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I will make the proposition as acceptable as possible.\r\nI will insert one o'clock instead of ten.\r\n\r\n     Exclamations were heard from several members of, \"Let us\r\n     agree,\" and the question being taken on the first resolution\r\n     as amended, it was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I move to insert in the second resolution, ten minutes\r\ninstead of five, wherever the word occurs. That time is none too long\r\nto state the purpose of an amendment properly.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--Is this resolution designed to exclude all discussion upon\r\nan amendment, except by the member moving it and the committee?\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--No! Such is not the intention. Any one can speak five\r\nminutes. I rely on our sense of propriety not to abuse this\r\nconstruction of the resolution.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. BACKUS was decided in the negative by a vote\r\n_viva voce_.\r\n\r\n     The resolution was then adopted, together with the\r\n     resolution relating to motions to strike out and insert.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWNE:--I move that when the Convention adjourn, it adjourn to\r\nmeet at half-past seven o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I hope the Conference will not hold night sessions. Our\r\nday sessions are protracted and very laborious. I agree with Commodore\r\nSTOCKTON, that night sessions are dangerous.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--I do not agree with Mr. CHASE. I have\r\nparticularly observed the demeanor of all the gentlemen in the\r\nConference, and know that they are as well fitted for business at five\r\no'clock in the afternoon as at ten o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nA vote by the States was called for, which resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES:--Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, New York, North Carolina, New Hampshire,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia--13.\r\n\r\n     NOES:--Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     Ohio, and Vermont--7.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--In pursuance of the instructions of the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania, I offer the following. I wish to have it laid on the\r\ntable, and printed, that I may move it as an amendment to the\r\ncommittee's report at the proper time.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. WILMOT was agreed to, and the amendment is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"And Congress shall further provide by law, that the United\r\n     States shall make full compensation to a citizen of any\r\n     State, who in any other State shall suffer, by reason of\r\n     violence or intimidation from mobs and riotous assemblies,\r\n     in his person or property, or in deprivation, by violence,\r\n     of his rights secured by this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I ask that the following may be adopted as an additional\r\nrule:\r\n\r\n     \"When the vote on any question is taken by States, any\r\n     Commissioner dissenting from the vote of his State, may have\r\n     his dissent entered on the Journal.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I suggest whether it would not be better to call the yeas\r\nand nays, on the motion of any Commissioner. I have heretofore\r\nintroduced a resolution to that effect, which, with the gentleman's\r\npermission, I will now call up.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I won't insist.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE'S resolution was taken up as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The yeas and nays of the Commissioner of each State, upon\r\n     any question, shall be entered upon the Journal when it is\r\n     desired by any Commissioner, and the vote of each State\r\n     shall be determined by the majority of Commissioners present\r\n     from each State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope the gentleman will waive the first part of the\r\nresolution. I think it is the best way not to disclose our divisions\r\nany farther than is indispensably necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I copied the rule _verbatim_ from the one adopted by the\r\nCongress of the Confederation. I think it right and fair. But I have\r\nno objection to modifying it, so as to have the yeas and nays called\r\non the motion of any entire delegation.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I did not withdraw my motion. I think it will accomplish\r\nall we need. It will be taken, of course, that those who do not\r\ndissent vote with the delegation.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I think it is entirely too late to talk about saving time.\r\nHow long will it take to have the names of dissenting delegates\r\ncalled? For one, I desire to exercise my rights under the authority of\r\nthe State I represent. I will not consent to waive them. When the vote\r\nof my State is cast, I wish to have the record show who is responsible\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n     The question was taken on the resolution offered by Mr.\r\n     CHASE, and it was rejected, and the additional rule proposed\r\n     by Mr. DENT was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I offer the following, which I shall move as an\r\namendment to the report. I ask that it be laid on the table, and\r\nprinted:\r\n\r\n     \"The term of office of all Presidents and Vice-Presidents of\r\n     the United States, hereafter elected, shall be six years;\r\n     and any person once elected to either of said offices, shall\r\n     ever after be ineligible to the same office.\"\r\n\r\nThe above motion to lay on the table and print was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I also have an amendment, of which I ask to have the\r\nsame disposition made. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Congress shall have no power to legislate in respect to\r\n     persons held to service or labor in any case, except to\r\n     provide for the rendition of fugitives from such service or\r\n     labor, and to suppress the foreign slave trade; and the\r\n     existing _status_ or condition of all the Territories of the\r\n     United States, in respect to persons held to service or\r\n     labor, shall remain unchanged during their territorial\r\n     condition; and whenever any Territory, with suitable\r\n     boundaries, shall contain the population requisite for a\r\n     representative in Congress, according to the then federal\r\n     ratio of representation, it shall be entitled to admission\r\n     into the Union on an equal footing with the original States,\r\n     with or without persons held to service or labor, as the\r\n     Constitution of such new State may prescribe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON'S motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr GUTHRIE:--I call for the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The order of the day is called for, and the gentleman\r\nfrom New York has the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--At the adjournment yesterday, I had proceeded to state\r\ntwo or three grounds upon which I think the proposals of amendment to\r\nthe Constitution reported by the majority of the committee would be\r\nunacceptable to the North, and I had also stated some special\r\nobjections to action in this way and at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration to which I would invite attention is this: Is\r\nit necessary or wise for the Conference, composed as it is of friends\r\nof the Union, or is it _expedient_ thus to encounter the settled\r\nsentiments and convictions of the people of so large a section of the\r\ncountry? It is not necessary, for various reasons. This territorial\r\nquestion is, after all, a question to be looked at in a prospective\r\nview. Why is it necessary to disturb the Constitution by inserting\r\nsuch a provision as you propose? Why is it necessary for gentlemen\r\nfrom the South to have it in, in order to enable them to stand with\r\ntheir people at home?\r\n\r\nSlavery is now in New Mexico. That must be acknowledged as a fact. The\r\nSouth think it rightfully there--the North believe it is there\r\nwrongfully. But its existence in the territories is a fact\r\nnevertheless. President LINCOLN cannot help it if he would. The\r\nSupreme Court will affirm its rightful existence there, whenever the\r\nquestion comes before that body. That Court cannot be changed before\r\nthese territories are admitted as States, if the disposition exists to\r\nchange it. You claim that the question is already decided. How, then,\r\ncan it be important to you to press the adoption of these sections as\r\na part of the Constitution? My judgment is, that it is best to leave\r\nthis subject alone--that that is the true way to save the Union.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the South, remember that if you must stand at home with\r\nyour people, so also must we. There is a _North_ as well as a\r\n_South_!--a northern people as well as southern people. You press us\r\nhard on these subjects. But can men who are rational ask us to abandon\r\nour own people, to go counter to their convictions and sentiments? We\r\ncannot do it! You would not respect us if we did! I am very sure that\r\nif this Conference is to attain any beneficial result, it must abandon\r\nall idea of coercion or intimidation as applied to the friends of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIt is said we are contending for a party platform--that we are letting\r\nparty stand between us and the Union. I could trample parties and\r\nplatforms under foot to preserve the Union, but I cannot understand\r\nhow honest men can abandon principles because a party has adopted them\r\ninto its platform. Do not tell us that by adhering to the Union and\r\nthe Constitution, we are simply adhering to a party platform. Our\r\nprinciples are at least as dear to us, as yours are to you; you must\r\nnot expect us to sacrifice them either to promote our own material\r\ninterests or to promote yours.\r\n\r\nLet us then sink the question of slavery in the Territories. Let the\r\ncourts take care of it if need be, or let it be dealt with when it\r\nproperly comes up. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" In\r\nthat direction lays the path of peace.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it may be suggested that such a course would really leave\r\nno plan to be adopted. Perhaps so. Is it, then, not true that we are\r\nhaving all this trouble over a contingency that may or may not arise?\r\nThat the Constitution is sufficient for all purposes but this, you\r\naver; and yet you say in the same breath that the Court has settled\r\nthis question entirely and finally in your favor. Why not be\r\nsatisfied, then, with the settlement? Can you make it more of a\r\nfinality in the way you propose? No, gentlemen; believe me when I tell\r\nyou that the true remedy does not consist in endeavoring to humiliate\r\nthe people of one section for the benefit of another. Remember we are\r\ndealing with the _American_ people; I would not throw the Constitution\r\ninto the vortex of disunion that is opening before us; I would\r\npreserve it rather as a rock on which we can all safely stand. Do not\r\nthrow away the compass by which alone we can safely be guided!\r\n\r\nIf I were to suggest a suitable remedy, what I think a wise plan, it\r\nwould be the one adopted on a similar occasion, when one of the States\r\nset itself up in opposition to the General Government, with such very\r\nbeneficial results; and that would be, to have the Government appeal\r\nto the people for support--to throw itself into the arms of the\r\npeople. The result then has become historical. It is remembered with\r\npride and pleasure by all. I would have a similar course pursued now.\r\nThe result would be equally grand, equally gratifying. It would rally\r\nevery patriot, every friend of the Union from every section, to its\r\nsupport. You, gentlemen of the South, now friends of the Union, still\r\ngive it the strength of your support, the favor of your countenance,\r\nand you shall be supported and sustained as you can be in no other\r\nway. You shall have the support of the power of the Government and of\r\nevery friend of the Union in the country.\r\n\r\nYou remember how those patriotic statesmen, CLAY and\r\nWEBSTER--differing from the Executive, opposing his election with all\r\nthe strength of their gigantic intellects--when the authority of the\r\nGovernment was questioned, and South Carolina, under the lead of Mr.\r\nCALHOUN, undertook to set herself up in opposition to it--how they\r\nwaived all former differences, and instead of encouraging secession by\r\ntheir delay and timidity, without asking for new guarantees or for\r\namendments of the Constitution, came voluntarily and earnestly to the\r\nsupport of the Executive and the administration, because the Executive\r\nwas right, and was the chosen instrument of the people to preserve the\r\nintegrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--If the gentleman will excuse me, I will state that the\r\ncourse of the Executive against South Carolina was universally\r\nacquiesced in except in that State. And yet the opinion that President\r\nJACKSON far exceeded his powers, was equally unanimous. That precedent\r\nhas been greatly misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I thank the gentleman from North Carolina. He entertains\r\nhis opinions, I do mine, as to what then saved the Union. I should not\r\nprobably be able to make him think with me; but I feel sure that the\r\nidea prevails quite extensively, that South Carolina returned to the\r\npath of duty then, because the power of the Government was wielded by\r\nan honest and energetic Executive. She came to the conclusion that any\r\nother course would probably be attended with danger.\r\n\r\nOur present differences had no very remote origin. They belong to our\r\nown generation, and we ought to be compelled to deal with them. I\r\nthink the so-called compromise of 1850 was the cause of all our\r\ntroubles--that instead of saving the country it brought it into\r\ngreater danger than it ever was before.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I wish to make a suggestion on that point.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I hope the gentleman will not forget that he will have a\r\nfull opportunity to answer me. I am nearly through, and generally no\r\ngood comes of interruptions. They only consume time.\r\n\r\nI was about to say, that I do not propose to go into the question of\r\nwho was to blame for that repeal. I agree with gentlemen from the\r\nSouth, that there is no profit now in discussing the origin of our\r\ntroubles--in inquiring who set the house on fire before we put on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--Does the gentleman do justice to Mr. CLAY, when at one\r\nmoment he says that Mr. CLAY held up the arms of the administration,\r\nstrengthened the Executive, and aided the Government in putting down\r\nsecession, and in the next, states that the compromise of 1850 was the\r\ncause of all our troubles, when it is well known that Mr. CLAY\r\nstrongly favored that compromise?\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--When I speak of the unhappy effect of the compromise\r\nmeasures of 1850, I ascribe no wrong motives to Mr. CLAY or any one\r\nelse. If he approved that compromise, I have no doubt he did it in the\r\nfull belief that it would be beneficial to the country. Experience has\r\nshown that he was mistaken. Saying this is doing no injustice to Mr.\r\nCLAY. I spoke only of effects. I spoke of the zeal and the energy with\r\nwhich the patriots and eminent statesmen of all parties of this\r\ncountry have been accustomed to come forward and sustain the\r\nadministration when any necessity existed for doing so. Now let this\r\nConference--let all true friends of the Union everywhere, with one\r\nvoice, without attempting to place any section or any man in a false\r\nor disagreeable position, unite in one determined effort in behalf of\r\nthe Union, and in an attempt to bring the rash and dangerous men who\r\nwould seek the destruction of the Government back to a sense of duty.\r\nLet us address the country, let us show that we are devoted to the\r\nUnion, far beyond any considerations of party or self; let us invoke\r\nthe aid of all true and patriotic men; let us ask them to lay aside\r\nfor the time all other considerations, and give themselves for the\r\npresent to the country! The spirit of the old time is yet alive. We\r\ncan call it out in more than its old strength and vigor, and it will\r\nsave the country. Our private interests may suffer, but the great\r\ninterests of the Union will be strengthened and preserved, and the\r\nConstitution, which has been our pride and strength, will not be\r\ndragged down into the great whirlpool of disunion. I appeal to the\r\nvenerable and able men around me, who bear historic names--who have\r\nbeen themselves long connected with the Union and its Government, to\r\njoin us in our struggle to save the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe views I have expressed may be chimerical. I have advanced them\r\nwith no little diffidence, but I felt called upon to state them in the\r\ndischarge of a duty I owe to a people who love and will make great\r\nsacrifices to save the Constitution and the Union.\r\n\r\nA majority vote, one way or the other here, would be of little\r\nconsequence. It would carry no weight with it. But if the members of\r\nthis Conference would all unite in such an appeal to the country, the\r\nresponse would be instantaneous and effective. The heart of the\r\ncountry is loyal; the heart of the South is loyal, I believe. We have\r\nabundant evidence that it is not too late to rely upon the Union men\r\nin Missouri and Tennessee!\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--The vote of Tennessee is entirely misunderstood.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--Perhaps so. I have no acquaintance with the people of\r\nTennessee. But I will not occupy the time of the Conference farther. I\r\nhave spoken plainly, but I have spoken what I believe to be the honest\r\nconvictions of a large majority of the people of this Union. Once more\r\nI say, let us not destroy the Constitution!\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--I have not got up to make a speech. We have had too\r\nmuch speech-making here. It may be very well for gentlemen to get up\r\nand make long arguments and eloquent appeals, and show their abilities\r\nand powers, but it all does no sort of good--nobody is benefited, and\r\nno opinions are changed. I shall take no such course. I want to see\r\nwhether this little handful of men who meet every day in this hall,\r\ncannot get together and fix up this matter which has been so much\r\ntalked about. Let us pay no attention to the great men or the\r\npoliticians. They have interests of their own. Some of them have\r\ninterests which are superior to those of their country.\r\n\r\nIn the common affairs of life there are always a great many\r\ndifferences of opinion. Some treat these differences one way--some\r\nanother. Foolish men go to law, and always come out worse off than\r\nwhen they started. Sensible men get together, and talk matters over;\r\none gives up a little, the other gives up a little, and finally they\r\nget together. Now, friends, that is just what I want to see done here.\r\n\r\nWe are all friends--friends of the Union and of each other. Nobody\r\nwants to give up the Union, or hurt Mr. LINCOLN. The South has got\r\nfrightened--not exactly frightened, but she thinks the Republicans,\r\nsince they have got the power, are going to trample upon her rights.\r\nShe wants the North to agree not to do so. Now I should like to know\r\nwhat objection there was to that? Who is afraid to do that? If we\r\ncould go to work at this thing like sensible men, we could settle the\r\nwhole matter in two hours.\r\n\r\nNow about these propositions. I do not see any thing alarming in them.\r\nI have not set to work to pick flaws in them. Leave that to the\r\nlawyers. I don't care much about them, nor does the North care about\r\nthem. If the South will take them and be satisfied--if they will stop\r\nthis clamor about slavery and slavery extension, I think she had\r\nbetter have them. For one, I am sick of the whole subject.\r\n\r\nLet us then go about the work like sensible men; let us stop making\r\nlong speeches and picking flaws in each other. It is a matter of\r\nbusiness, and pretty important business. Let us consider it as such,\r\nand from this moment let us throw aside all feeling, and set about\r\ncoming to some understanding. We can do it to-day as well as next\r\nweek. I do not know that these propositions are the best that can be\r\nmade; but if they are not, let us talk the matter over like good Union\r\nmen, and see what is best. When we can find that out, let us agree. If\r\nwe stay here and make speeches until doomsday, we shall be no better\r\noff. I am for action, and coming to an immediate decision.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--If the vote of Missouri is to be taken as an evidence of\r\nher devotion to the Union, it must also be understood with this\r\nqualification: Her interests and her sympathies unite her closely with\r\nthe South. She feels, in common with others, her share of anxiety for\r\nthe future. She is devoted to the Union, and at the same time she\r\ninsists that it is fair and right that these guarantees should be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIt has been distinctly avowed on this floor that the people of certain\r\nsections of the North _abhor_ slavery. Ought we not to be distrustful\r\nwhen a party entertaining such sentiments comes into supreme power?\r\nIf Massachusetts abhors _slavery_, how long will it be before she will\r\nabhor _slaveholders?_\r\n\r\nIgnorance is the source of all our difficulties. The people of the\r\nNorth know little of the condition of the negro in a state of slavery.\r\nWe know that the four millions of blacks in the South are better off\r\nin all respects than any similar number of laborers anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut I rise only to correct a false impression in regard to Missouri. I\r\nhave only besides to express my full conviction that if the North will\r\nnot give us these guarantees, we are henceforth a divided people.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--Mr. President, the object of this Convention, assembled\r\non the call or invitation of Virginia, is, as set forth in the\r\npreamble and resolutions of her General Assembly,\r\n\r\n     \"To restore the Union and Constitution in the spirit in\r\n     which they were established by the fathers of the Republic;\"\r\n     or, as otherwise expressed, \"to adjust the present unhappy\r\n     controversies in the spirit in which the Constitution was\r\n     originally made, and consistently with its principles.\"\r\n\r\nThis agrees, in substance, with the purpose of the Republican party,\r\nwhich, in the words of the Philadelphia platform, is declared to be\r\nthat of \"restoring the action of the Federal Government to the\r\nprinciples of WASHINGTON and JEFFERSON.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia announces to the other States that she \"is desirous of\r\nemploying every reasonable means,\" and is \"willing to unite\" with them\r\n\"in an earnest effort\" for the accomplishment of this common end and\r\nobject of that State and the Republican party; and she is moved to\r\nmake this her \"final effort,\" by \"the deliberate opinion of her\r\nGeneral Assembly, that unless the unhappy controversy which now\r\ndivides the States of this Confederacy shall be satisfactorily\r\nadjusted, a permanent dissolution of the Union is inevitable,\" and by\r\na desire to \"avert so dire a calamity.\"\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, equally willing to unite with the other States in an\r\nearnest effort to further the same end, accepted the invitation of\r\nVirginia, and sent Commissioners here to represent her.\r\n\r\nThe honorable Chairman (Mr. GUTHRIE) of the committee to report a plan\r\nof adjustment, in his opening speech, advocated with earnestness and\r\neloquence a restoration of the Constitution to the principles of the\r\nfathers. The distinguished gentleman (Mr. RIVES) from Virginia\r\ndemands a \"restoration of the Constitution to the landmarks of our\r\nfathers,\" and his colleague (Mr. SEDDON) urges a return to the \"policy\r\nof our fathers in 1787.\"\r\n\r\nThis assumes that we have departed from the principles and landmarks\r\nof our fathers, and from the policy of 1787. The call of the\r\nConvention assumes this; the platform of the Republican party assumes\r\nit, and the gentlemen whose remarks I have quoted assume it, and it is\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe particular object of a return to the principles and landmarks of\r\nthe policy of 1787, as stated in the preamble and resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Virginia, is, \"to afford to the people of the\r\nslaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of their\r\nrights.\" This implies that such a return will afford these adequate\r\nguarantees. I agree that it will; and I am ready, and Massachusetts is\r\nready, to adjust this unhappy controversy, and to give the guarantees\r\ndemanded in exactly this way.\r\n\r\nStated in these general terms, there is a perfect agreement between\r\nus. But we find a wide difference when we go one step farther, and\r\nlearn precisely what Virginia claims would be a restoration of the\r\nConstitution to the principles of the fathers, and a return to the\r\npolicy of 1787. This she has told us in one of the resolutions sent\r\nout with the call for this Convention. That resolution is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That in the opinion of the General Assembly of\r\n     Virginia, the propositions embraced in the resolutions\r\n     presented to the Senate of the United States by Hon. JOHN J.\r\n     CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the first article proposed\r\n     as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\n     shall apply to all the territory of the United States, now\r\n     held or hereafter acquired south of latitude 36° 30´, and\r\n     provide that slavery of the African race shall be\r\n     effectually protected as property therein during the\r\n     continuance of the territorial government, and the fourth\r\n     article shall secure to the owners of slaves the right of\r\n     transit with their slaves between and through the\r\n     non-slaveholding States and territories, constitute the\r\n     basis of such an adjustment of the unhappy controversy which\r\n     now divides the States of this Confederacy, as would be\r\n     accepted by the people of this Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in reference to these propositions that the gentleman (Mr.\r\nSEDDON) from Virginia, has asked us the question, \"Are we not entitled\r\nto these added guarantees according to the spirit of the compact of\r\nour fathers?\"\r\n\r\nThe true answer to this question is the pivot on which this whole\r\ncontroversy must turn. If the slave States are not entitled to these\r\nadded guarantees, \"according to the spirit of the compact of our\r\nfathers,\" then Virginia, as I understand her Commissioners, and the\r\nresolutions of her General Assembly, does not claim them. She stands\r\nupon her rights according to that compact. And all such rights\r\nMassachusetts is ready to accord to her, fairly and fully.\r\n\r\nBy the spirit of the compact of our fathers is meant, the Constitution\r\nas they understood it, and as the people of that day understood it.\r\nAnd this is what is meant by the \"landmarks of the fathers.\" All admit\r\nthat the Federal Government should be administered now, as it was\r\nadministered by its framers. This is what gentlemen from the slave\r\nStates, in giving utterance to their intense devotion to the Union,\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThen, what is the Constitution, as understood by those who framed it?\r\nWhat does it mean when interpreted by the light of the policy of 1787?\r\nand what is the spirit of the compact which they made? This is the\r\nquestion we are called to consider. In my remarks I do not mean to\r\nwander from it.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Constitution touches the question out of which the\r\npresent unhappy controversy has arisen, I say it means this: That\r\nslavery, as it existed or might exist within the limits of the\r\noriginal States, should not be interfered with to the injury of the\r\nlawful rights of slaveholders under State authority; on the contrary,\r\nthat it should have the right of recaption, and a qualified\r\nprotection; but that outside of those limits, otherwise than in this\r\nright of recaption, it should never exist, neither in the territories\r\nnor in the new States.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say here, that when I speak of the original States, I mean\r\nthe territory of those States as then bounded. Alabama and Mississippi\r\nbelonged to Georgia, Tennessee belonged to North Carolina, Kentucky\r\nbelonged to Virginia, Vermont belonged to New York, and Maine belonged\r\nto Massachusetts, and were parts of the thirteen original States, at\r\nthe time the Constitution was adopted. When, therefore, I speak of\r\nterritory outside the original States, I do not refer to territory\r\nwithin any of the States named.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUTWELL:--I trust my colleague does not claim to speak for\r\nMassachusetts, when he denies the right of any State of this Union to\r\nestablish and maintain slavery within its jurisdiction, or to prohibit\r\nit altogether, according to its discretion. This right was reserved to\r\nthe States; and States in this Union, whether original or new, stand\r\non a footing of perfect equality.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I certainly do not claim to speak for Massachusetts,\r\nthough I believe the opinion of the great majority of her people\r\nagrees with my own on this subject. However, what I claim is, that\r\nOhio and the other States of the northwestern territory have no\r\nconstitutional power to legalize slavery within their limits; that\r\nthey were admitted into the Union without any such power, and that\r\nevery other new State formed from territory outside the limits of the\r\noriginal States, according to the \"spirit of the compact of our\r\nfathers,\" should have been admitted without that power, or the right\r\nto acquire it. This I will now proceed to show.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of March, 1784, the northwest territory, constituting\r\nthe present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin, was ceded by Virginia to the United States. The\r\njurisdiction of the United States was then exclusive and paramount, or\r\nsoon became so--such other States as had claimed any right of\r\njurisdiction having ceded it. The cession of Virginia was made by\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, SAMUEL HARDY, ARTHUR LEE, and JAMES MONROE, who were\r\ndelegates in Congress from that State, and had been appointed\r\nCommissioners for this purpose. On the same day the cession was made,\r\nMr. JEFFERSON, in behalf of a committee, reported a plan for temporary\r\ngovernments in the United States territory then and afterwards to be\r\nceded, and for forming therein permanent governments.\r\n\r\nThat plan provided, \"that so much of the territory ceded, or to be\r\nceded, by individual States to the United States, shall be divided\r\ninto distinct States.\" It is obvious that this plan contemplated the\r\npossession of territory in no other way than by cession from the\r\nStates. It was expected that Georgia and North Carolina would cede\r\ntheir western lands, now the States of Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nTennessee, as they did some years later; and Mr. JEFFERSON'S plan was\r\nintended to embrace those lands or territories to be ceded.\r\nConsequently, the following provisions, which were part of the plan\r\nreported, were intended by him to apply to Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nTennessee, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"After the year 1800 of the Christian era, there shall be\r\n     neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said\r\n     States, otherwise that in the punishment of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nHere the States were evidently those to be formed in United States\r\nterritory. And farther on in the plan it is stated,\r\n\r\n     \"That the preceding articles shall be formed into a charter\r\n     of compact, and shall stand as fundamental Constitutions\r\n     between the thirteen original States, and each of the\r\n     several States now newly described, unalterable ... but by\r\n     the joint consent of the United States in Congress\r\n     assembled, and of the particular State within which such\r\n     alteration is proposed to be made.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a proposition to exclude slavery forever after 1800, not only\r\nfrom the territories which had been, and might afterwards be, ceded,\r\nbut from the States to be formed in them, and to make it a fundamental\r\nConstitution between the original States and each new State. It\r\nexcited a short discussion, and was postponed from time to time to the\r\n19th of April, when Mr. SPEIGHT, of North Carolina, moved to strike it\r\nout. The motion was seconded by Mr. REED, of South Carolina. The vote\r\nby States, on the motion to strike out, was:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina--3.\r\n\r\n     NAYS.--New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania--6.\r\n\r\nThis was under the Confederation articles, which provided that the\r\nvote on all questions should be taken by States, each State casting\r\none vote; that no proposition could be adopted without the vote of\r\nseven States in favor of it, and that the vote of no State could be\r\ncounted unless two members, at least, were present. As there were but\r\nsix States in favor of the proposition to prohibit slavery after 1800,\r\nit was stricken out.\r\n\r\nThere was but one member present from New Jersey, and the vote of that\r\nState was not counted. The member present voted for Mr. JEFFERSON'S\r\nproposition. Another vote from that State would have made the required\r\nnumber, and carried the measure.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina, WILLIAMSON voted for prohibition, and SPEIGHT\r\nagainst it. One more vote from that State would have made seven States\r\nfor the proposition, and it would have been carried.\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON voted for his own proposition to prohibit; and if one of the\r\nother two members present from Virginia had voted with him, that, too,\r\nwould have made the required number of seven States.\r\n\r\nThe vote North and South, by members, was in favor of prohibition:\r\nNorth, 14; South, 2--total, 16. Against prohibition, South, 7.\r\n\r\nThe majority was more than two-thirds; enough to carry it over an\r\nexecutive veto under the present Constitution, and yet it was\r\ndefeated. And this vote was given in favor of absolute and\r\nunconditional prohibition, and that alone, without the right of\r\nreclaiming fugitive slaves, or any proposition, or any expectation to\r\nconfer it. Under the Confederation, no such right existed, nor was it\r\nagreed to till more than three years afterwards, and then with the\r\ngreatest reluctance, and as a matter of compromise, as I will\r\npresently show.\r\n\r\nSuch was the action of the American Congress in 1784--a unanimous vote\r\nfrom the North, and two in nine from the South--in favor of excluding\r\nslavery forever after 1800, in all new States to be formed, in\r\nterritory ceded or to be ceded, embracing Tennessee, Alabama, and\r\nMississippi, in the extreme South. Nothing can be clearer than that\r\nthe interdiction was to apply to all such States, and to constitute a\r\nfundamental Constitution between them and the original States,\r\nunalterable without the consent of Congress. The new State was to be\r\ndeprived of all power to admit slavery. This proposition was made and\r\nvoted for by JEFFERSON. But how many votes would such a proposition\r\nreceive in this Convention? Not many, I fear, even from the free\r\nStates. My friend and colleague, though strongly anti-slavery, and\r\nearnestly devoted to freedom in the Territories, is afraid I shall\r\ncommit Massachusetts to this old Jeffersonian doctrine of no slavery,\r\nand no right to establish it in the new States.\r\n\r\nFrom this time till July, 1787, the question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories and new States remained open and unsettled. In 1785, RUFUS\r\nKING renewed Mr. JEFFERSON'S proposition to prohibit, and it was\r\nreferred to a committee by the vote of eight States; but it never\r\nbecame a law, a few from the South always preventing it.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Convention to revise the old, or frame a new\r\nConstitution, assembled in Philadelphia on the second Monday of May,\r\n1787. And here let me read a single paragraph from a lecture by Mr.\r\nTOOMBS, of Georgia, delivered in Boston in 1856. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The history of the times and the debates in the Convention\r\n     which framed the Constitution, show that the whole subject\r\n     of slavery was much considered by them, and perplexed them\r\n     in the extreme, and that those provisions which relate to it\r\n     were earnestly considered by the State Conventions which\r\n     adopted it. Incipient legislation providing for emancipation\r\n     had already been adopted by some of the States.\r\n     Massachusetts had declared that slavery was extinguished by\r\n     her Bill of Rights. The African slave trade had already been\r\n     legislated against in many of the States, including\r\n     Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, the largest\r\n     slaveholding States. The public mind was unquestionably\r\n     tending toward emancipation. This feeling displayed itself\r\n     in the South as well as in the North. Some of the present\r\n     slaveholding States thought that the power to abolish, not\r\n     only the African slave trade, but slavery in the States,\r\n     ought to be given to the Federal Government; and that the\r\n     Constitution did not take this shape, was made one of the\r\n     most prominent objections to it by LUTHER MARTIN, a\r\n     distinguished member of the Convention from Maryland; and\r\n     Mr. MASON, of Virginia, was not far behind him in his\r\n     emancipation principles. Mr. MADISON sympathized to a great\r\n     extent. Anti-slavery feelings were extensively indulged in\r\n     by many members of the Convention, both from the\r\n     slaveholding and the non-slaveholding States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON'S testimony is important here. He was a member of the old\r\nCongress in New York, until the assembling of the Constitutional\r\nConvention, and took his seat as a member of that body.\r\n\r\nThe History of the Ordinance of 1787, by Hon. EDWARD COLES, contains\r\nthe following statement, as made to him by Mr. MADISON:\r\n\r\n     \"The old Congress held its sessions, in 1787, in New York,\r\n     while at the same time the Convention which framed the\r\n     Constitution of the United States held its sessions in\r\n     Philadelphia. Many individuals were members of both bodies,\r\n     and thus were enabled to know what was passing in each--both\r\n     sitting with closed doors and in secret sessions. The\r\n     distracting question of slavery was agitating and retarding\r\n     the labors of both, and led to conferences of\r\n     intercommunications of the members.\"\r\n\r\nI quote this testimony now, to show that Conferences were held between\r\nthe members of Congress and the Federal Convention, upon the subject\r\nof slavery. I shall quote farther from it on another point, after\r\nturning for a moment to the proceedings of Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th July, 1787, the Convention having been in session about two\r\nmonths, the ordinance for the government of the Western Territory,\r\nwhich had been reported in a new draft on the 26th of the preceding\r\nApril, and ordered to a third reading on the 10th May, and then\r\npostponed, was referred to a new committee, consisting of Messrs.\r\nCARRINGTON, of Virginia; DANE, of Massachusetts; R.H. LEE, of\r\nVirginia; KEAN, of North Carolina; and SMITH, of New York. Two days\r\nafterwards, July 11th, Mr. CARRINGTON reported what has since been\r\nknown as the \"Ordinance of 1787,\" with the exception of the 6th\r\narticle of compact, prohibiting slavery. When it came up the next day,\r\nthe 12th, for a second reading, Mr. DANE rose and stated as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"In the committee, as ever before, since the day when\r\n     JEFFERSON first introduced the proposal to prohibit slavery\r\n     in the territory, it was found impossible to come to any\r\n     arrangement; that the committee desired to report only so\r\n     far as they were unanimous; that they, therefore, had\r\n     omitted altogether the subject of slavery; but that it was\r\n     understood that any member of the committee might,\r\n     consistently with his having concurred in the report, move\r\n     in the house to amend it in the particular of slavery. He\r\n     therefore moved as an amendment, to add a prohibition of\r\n     slavery in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"That there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\n     servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the\r\n     punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\n     convicted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as a compromise, Mr. DAVIS proposed to add the following proviso:\r\n\r\n     \"Provided always, that any person escaping into the same,\r\n     from whom labor-service is lawfully claimed in any one of\r\n     the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully retained\r\n     and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or\r\n     service as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nThis was at once unanimously accepted by the slave States. The next\r\nday, the 13th, the ordinance was passed, every slave State present,\r\nviz.: Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,\r\nand every member from those States voting for it. The same\r\nprohibition--which a large majority of the South had resisted when\r\npresented alone--was now, when accompanied with the proviso,\r\nunanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nHere was a sudden change. But the proviso giving the right of\r\nreclamation in the said territory, only partially explains it. For a\r\nfull explanation we must turn again to the Convention. And the first\r\nthing is a further extract from Mr. MADISON, respecting a letter,\r\nbefore quoted, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The distracting question of slavery was agitating and\r\n     retarding the labors of both bodies--Congress and the\r\n     Convention; and led to conferences and intercommunications\r\n     of the members, which resulted in a Compromise, by which the\r\n     Northern, or anti-slavery portion of the country, agreed to\r\n     incorporate into the ordinance and Constitution, the\r\n     provision to restore fugitive slaves; and this mutual and\r\n     concurrent action was the cause of the similarity of the\r\n     provisions contained in both, and had its influence in\r\n     creating the great unanimity by which the ordinance passed,\r\n     and also in making the Constitution the more acceptable to\r\n     the slaveholders.\"\r\n\r\nMr. MADISON, also, in the Virginia Convention, urged the ratification\r\nof the Constitution for the following among other reasons, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"At present, if any slave escape to any of those States\r\n     where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by their laws;\r\n     for the laws of the States are uncharitable to one another\r\n     in this respect. This clause was expressly inserted to\r\n     enable owners of slaves to retain them. This is a better\r\n     security than any that now exists.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral PINCKNEY, one of the delegates in the Federal Convention, from\r\nSouth Carolina, in a debate in the House of Representatives of that\r\nState on the Constitution, said:\r\n\r\n     \"We have obtained a right to remove our slaves in whatever\r\n     part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we\r\n     had not before. In short, considering all the circumstances,\r\n     we have made the best terms we could, and on the whole I do\r\n     not think them bad.\"\r\n\r\nIn the speech made by Mr. WEBSTER on the 7th of March, 1850, he\r\nremarked that:\r\n\r\n     \"So far as we can now learn, there was a perfect concurrence\r\n     of opinion between those respective bodies--the Congress and\r\n     the Constitution--and it resulted in this ordinance of\r\n     1787.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. WEBSTER had closed his speech, Mr. CALHOUN arose, and among\r\nother things, said:\r\n\r\n     \"He, Mr. WEBSTER, states very correctly that the ordinance\r\n     commenced under the old confederation; that Congress was\r\n     sitting in New York at the time, while the Convention sat in\r\n     Philadelphia; and that there was concert of action.... When\r\n     the ordinance was passed, as I have good reason to believe,\r\n     it was upon a principle of compromise; first, that this\r\n     ordinance should contain a provision similar to the one put\r\n     in the Constitution, with respect to fugitive slaves; and\r\n     next, that it should be inserted in the Constitution; and\r\n     this was the compromise upon which the prohibition was\r\n     inserted in the ordinance of 1787.\"\r\n\r\nThis agrees with Mr. MADISON. The idea he conveys could scarcely have\r\nbeen more identical with Mr. MADISON if he had used MADISON'S words.\r\nWhen the Southern members of Congress voted unanimously for the 6th\r\nArticle, or anti-slavery clause in the ordinance, with the proviso in\r\nrespect to slaves escaping into the Territory, it was with the\r\nunderstanding that the Convention would insert a similar provision in\r\nthe Constitution respecting slaves escaping from one State to another;\r\nand this--its insertion in both--was the compromise upon which the\r\nprohibition was inserted in the ordinance. Such is the concurrent\r\ntestimony of Mr. MADISON and Mr. CALHOUN.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the ordinance of 1787, and see whether it applies,\r\nas the one proposed by Mr. JEFFERSON in 1784 did, to the new States as\r\nwell as to the Territories, and is the basis of State as well as\r\nTerritorial Governments, and was so intended. It declares as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"For extending the fundamental principles of civil and\r\n     religions liberty, which form the basis whereon these\r\n     republics, their laws and constitutions, are erected; to fix\r\n     and establish these principles as the basis of all laws,\r\n     constitutions, and governments, which forever hereafter\r\n     shall be formed in the said Territory; to provide also for\r\n     the establishment of States and permanent governments\r\n     therein, and for their admission to a share in the Federal\r\n     councils, on an equal footing with the original States, at\r\n     as early periods as may be consistent with the general\r\n     interest.\r\n\r\n     \"It is hereby ordained and declared by the authority\r\n     aforesaid: That the following articles shall be considered\r\n     as articles of compact between the original States and the\r\n     people and States in the said Territory, and forever remain\r\n     unalterable, unless by the common consent.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows six articles of compact. Part of the fifth and the sixth\r\nare in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"ART. 5.... Whenever any of the said States shall have sixty\r\n     thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be\r\n     admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United\r\n     States, on an equal footing with the original States, in all\r\n     respects whatever; and shall be at liberty to form a\r\n     permanent Constitution and State Government; _provided_ the\r\n     Constitutional Government, so to be formed, shall be\r\n     republican and in conformity to the principles contained in\r\n     these articles.\"\r\n\r\n     \"ART. 6. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\n     servitude in the said Territory, otherwise than in the\r\n     punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\n     convicted; _Provided, always_, That any person escaping into\r\n     the same from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in\r\n     any one of the original States, such fugitive may be\r\n     lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his\r\n     or her labor or service as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is so much of the ordinance as bears directly upon the point I am\r\ndiscussing. And the Convention, as if for the very purpose of giving\r\nthe unequivocal sanction of the Constitution and of the country to\r\nthis compromise, and of establishing it as the permanent policy of the\r\nGovernment, expressly provided that the \"engagements entered into\r\nbefore the adoption of this Constitution shall be as valid against the\r\nUnited States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.\"\r\n\r\nThis ordinance, then, which was an unalterable compact, prohibiting\r\nslavery, and fixing and establishing freedom as the basis of all laws,\r\nconstitutions, and governments in the Territory forever--State\r\nConstitutions and Governments of course included--was made valid by\r\nthe Constitution itself. And on this point I refer to the highest\r\nSouthern authority, the late Judge BERRIEN, who was thoroughly\r\npro-slavery in his views, and should certainly be ranked among the\r\nablest lawyers and statesmen Georgia has ever produced, who spoke to\r\nthis precise point during the compromise discussion in the United\r\nStates Senate in 1850, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Validity was given to their act by the clause in the\r\n     Constitution, which declares that contracts and engagements\r\n     entered into by the Government of the Confederation, should\r\n     be obligatory upon the Government of the United States\r\n     established by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the \"act\" of Congress in passing the ordinance referred to here.\r\nThis being so, it was the same in effect as though the ordinance had\r\nbeen written word for word in the Constitution itself. A contract can\r\nbe made valid, only by making it binding and obligatory upon the\r\nparties to it, according to its terms and meaning. To make an\r\nunalterable compact valid is to make it perpetually binding.\r\n\r\nHaving shown that the articles of compact in the ordinance were\r\nunalterable; that validity was given to them by the Constitution\r\nitself; that in express terms they applied to States as well as to\r\nTerritories, and must, therefore, being made valid by the\r\nConstitution, necessarily have been understood and intended by\r\nCongress and the Convention to prohibit slavery as effectually in one\r\nas the other, I will now show very briefly that they were also so\r\nunderstood in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON, of Pennsylvania, a prominent member of the Federal\r\nConvention, and also of the State Convention for ratifying the\r\nConstitution, remarked in the latter as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I consider this clause as laying the foundation for\r\n     banishing slavery out of the land.... The new States which\r\n     are to be formed will be under the control of Congress in\r\n     this particular, and slavery will never be introduced among\r\n     them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON speaks of the clause authorizing the prohibition of the\r\nAfrican slave trade.\r\n\r\nIn the Massachusetts Convention to adopt the Constitution, Gen. HEATH\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery cannot be extended. By their ordinance Congress has\r\n     declared that the new States shall be republican States, and\r\n     have no slavery.\"\r\n\r\nColonel BLAND, a member of the Convention from Virginia, said he\r\n\"wished slavery had never been introduced into America,\" and that \"he\r\nwas willing to join in any measure that would prevent its extending\r\nfarther.\" To allow it in new States would not prevent its extending\r\nfarther, and therefore it was prohibited in such States.\r\n\r\nDoctor RAMSAY, a member of the Convention of South Carolina, in his\r\nHistory of the United States, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Under these liberal principles, Congress, in organizing\r\n     colonies, bound themselves to impart to their inhabitants\r\n     all the privileges of coequal States.... These privileges\r\n     are not confined to any particular country or complexion.\r\n     They are communicable to the emancipated slave, for in the\r\n     new State of Ohio, slavery is altogether prohibited.\"\r\n\r\nThis compact, then, applies to State as well as Territorial\r\ngovernments, and was so understood in all sections of the\r\ncountry--northern, central, and southern--when the Constitution was\r\nratified.\r\n\r\nLet me now call attention to the very significant proviso to the sixth\r\narticle. What does the word original mean, and what does the whole\r\narticle mean with that word in the proviso?\r\n\r\n     \"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in\r\n     the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of\r\n     crimes, &c.; _Provided, always_, That any person escaping\r\n     into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully\r\n     claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may\r\n     be lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming\r\n     his or her labor or service as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude, except for the purpose of reclaiming such fugitives--and I\r\nadmit that slaves were intended--as are lawfully claimed in any one of\r\nthe original States. The very fact of the proviso implies that\r\nCongress understood that the right of reclamation could not exist,\r\nunless it was excepted.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it could only exist for the purpose excepted. The\r\nintention was to grant the right to the original States, but to limit\r\nit to them. It is impossible to conceive of a measure for framing the\r\nproviso as it is, if that had not been the intention. As the ordinance\r\nitself made provision for the formation of new States, such States\r\nmust have been in the minds of members when acting upon it. If the\r\nobject had been to authorize the reclamation of slaves escaping to\r\nthis territory from other States than original States, it is certain\r\nthe word \"original\" would have been omitted. It was intended for the\r\npurpose of limiting the right.\r\n\r\nNow observe that this article, proviso and all, is part of an\r\nunalterable compact to which the Constitution has given validity.\r\nNobody pretends Congress has ever had the power to alter it. Mr.\r\nTOOMBS denies any such power in express terms. A law which Congress\r\ncannot alter has substantially the force and effect of a\r\nconstitutional proviso. This, then, is the only law for the\r\nreclamation of fugitive slaves in the five States of the northwest\r\nterritory; and there can be no other, the Constitution having made it\r\nperpetually valid.\r\n\r\nSuch obviously is the meaning and legal effect of the fugitive slave\r\nprovision in the ordinance. And the meaning of that, derived as it is\r\nnot merely from the consent of the Federal and State conventions, but\r\nfrom their concurrent action, necessarily fixes the meaning of the\r\nprovision on the same subject in the Constitution, and shows how it\r\nmust have been understood. As the two were parts of the same\r\ncompromise, of course neither was understood to be inconsistent with\r\nthe other. The provision in the Constitution is in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the\r\n     laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence\r\n     of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such\r\n     service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\n     party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as this describes, or was understood to describe, persons held\r\nto service or labor as slaves, it necessarily must also have been\r\nunderstood to apply only to the original States. This follows from\r\nwhat has already been shown. And it must have been so understood for\r\nanother reason, because it was only \"in\" and \"under\" the laws of those\r\nStates that persons could be held to service or labor as slaves. Under\r\nthe laws of the Territories and new States, their being so held was\r\nforever prohibited. Hence, none but those escaped from one of the\r\noriginal States could ever be legally liable to reclamation, according\r\nto the understanding and intention of the original parties to this\r\ncompact. This manifestly was the meaning of \"the fathers,\" when the\r\nordinance and Constitution were framed and ratified.\r\n\r\nThe two provisions must be construed together. That in the ordinance\r\nwas intended for the Territories and new States, and that in the\r\nConstitution for the original States. If that in the Constitution had\r\nbeen intended for the Territories, it would have read, \"escaping into\r\nanother State or into the Territory,\" and that in the ordinance would\r\nhave been entirely omitted. The proviso to the prohibition in the\r\nMissouri Compromise in 1820 is a striking confirmation of this. That\r\nwas copied, word for word, from the ordinance of 1787, or original\r\ncompromise, except substituting for the words \"in any one of the\r\nStates,\" the words \"in any State or Territory of the United States,\"\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Provided, always_, That any person escaping into the same, from whom\r\nlabor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original\r\nStates, such fugitive,\" &c. And in the compromise of 1820:\r\n\r\n\"_Provided, always_, That any person escaping into the same from whom\r\nlabor or service is lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of the\r\nUnited States, such fugitive,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhy say \"in any State or Territory of the United States,\" instead of\r\n\"in any one of the original States,\" as in the ordinance of 1787,\r\nunless the Congress of 1820 understood the latter to limit the right\r\nof recovering fugitive slaves to the original States, and meant by the\r\nMissouri bill to extend it to all the States and Territories? They did\r\nextend it, but in palpable violation of the \"spirit of the compact of\r\nthe fathers,\" and of the \"policy of 1787.\"\r\n\r\nOriginally the Southern States committed themselves to the policy of\r\nslavery restriction, by a compact in the nature of a contract for a\r\nconsideration. By their own votes, they relinquished all pretence of\r\nright to any slaves beyond the jurisdiction of the original States.\r\nSlaveholders, as such, voluntarily shut themselves out of the new\r\nStates, in consideration of the right of recovering their fugitive\r\nslaves in whatever part of America they might take refuge. The object,\r\nas I have clearly shown, was to secure to slavery in the original\r\nStates the right of recovering fugitives, whether their escape should\r\nbe from one of those States to another, or to the Territories and new\r\nStates; but to make that the limit, both of the right of recovery on\r\none side, and of the obligation to permit or allow it, on the other.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then:\r\n\r\n_First_: That as between the new States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin, no right of reclamation exists, or can exist,\r\nthere being no power in Congress, as the South admit, to alter the\r\ncompact in the ordinance of 1787, which denies this right.\r\n\r\n_Second_: That no person, escaping from those States into any other\r\nState or Territory, can be reclaimed as a fugitive slave, because no\r\nperson can be held as a slave under their laws.\r\n\r\n_Third_: That no slave escaping from the slave States of Missouri,\r\nArkansas, Texas, Louisiana, or Florida, into Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, or Missouri, can be lawfully reclaimed as a fugitive slave,\r\nbecause Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are not\r\n_original_ States.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_: If slaves escape from any State or Territory other than the\r\noriginal States, into the States of the northwestern territory, no\r\nlawful power can touch them. The moment they reach those States they\r\nbecome free, because labor or service cannot lawfully be claimed of\r\nthem in an original State.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_: After the Missouri Compromise of 1820, slaves escaping from\r\nArkansas and Missouri, for example to Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and\r\nMinnesota, could be reclaimed, but escaping to Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\nMichigan, Indiana, and Ohio, they could not be. And the Congress of\r\n1820 so understood it. The particular in which the Missouri proviso\r\nwas altered in copying from the ordinance of 1787, is proof enough of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nBut did the framers of the Government intend to distinguish in this\r\nmanner between new and original slave States? Certainly not; and the\r\nreason is, they did not mean to have any new slave States. Otherwise\r\nthey certainly did mean to make this distinction, for nothing can be\r\nclearer than that Louisiana and Missouri cannot go to Ohio to recover\r\nfugitive slaves within the meaning of this \"compact of the fathers;\"\r\nwhile Georgia can. Manifestly we have departed from the system devised\r\nby the fathers in allowing Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and\r\nFlorida to be admitted with slavery, which explains, and nothing else\r\ncan, this anomalous condition of things.\r\n\r\nThere can be no escape from these conclusions, but to deny that the\r\nordinance has ever had any validity under the Constitution; which\r\nwould be scarcely less than to deny that the Constitution itself had\r\never been a valid instrument. Having the like unequivocal sanction of\r\nnational authority, and expressing alike in the words of Mr. Toombs,\r\n\"the collective will of the whole,\" they must stand or fall together.\r\n\r\nOriginally the territory was not divided by the line of 36° 30´, or by\r\nany other line giving part to freedom and part to slavery. It was all\r\nsecured, and by consent of the South, to freedom. There is nothing,\r\ntherefore, in the original compromise, to justify the remark of the\r\nEditor of the Boston _Courier_ in a recent number of that paper, that\r\n\"below the line of 36° 30´, the South have the right of prescription.\"\r\nFreedom has an older prescriptive right to all the Territories. The\r\nline established by the compromise, between slavery permitted and\r\nslavery prohibited, was the boundary line between the then existing\r\nStates and the Territory of the United States; or the line between\r\nexclusive national jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the States. It\r\nis an erroneous assumption, therefore, that the free States, by the\r\nintroduction of slavery south of 36° 30´, as well as north of it,\r\nwould receive more than a fair share or moiety of rights and\r\nprivileges, as between States or parties entitled to equal privileges.\r\nThe idea that the extension of slavery under the Federal Government\r\ncan be claimed by anybody south or north as a right, is wholly\r\ninadmissible. The _Courier_ will hold the following declarations from\r\nMr. WEBSTER to be good authority, if others do not:\r\n\r\n     \"Wherever there is a foot of land to be staid back from\r\n     becoming slave territory, I am ready to assert the principle\r\n     of excluding slavery.\" \"We are to use the first and last,\r\n     and every occasion which offers, to oppose the extension of\r\n     slave power.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I have to say, that while I hold with as much integrity, I\r\n     trust, and faithfulness, as any citizen of this country, to\r\n     all the original amendments and compromises in which the\r\n     Constitution under which we now live was adopted, I never\r\n     could, and never can persuade myself to be in favor of the\r\n     admission of other States into this Union as slave States\r\n     with the inequalities which were allowed and accorded to the\r\n     slaveholding States then in existence by the Constitution. I\r\n     do not think that the free States ever expected, or could\r\n     expect, that they would be called upon to admit further\r\n     slave States.... I think they have the clearest right to\r\n     require that the State coming into the Union, shall come in\r\n     upon an equality; and if the existence of slavery be an\r\n     impediment to coming in on an equality, then the State\r\n     proposing to come in should be required to remove that\r\n     inequality by abolishing slavery or take the alternative of\r\n     being excluded. I put my opposition on the political ground\r\n     that it deranges the balance of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nWherever there is a foot of land to be staid back from slavery! Every\r\noccasion to be used to oppose the extension of the slave power! New\r\nStates to abolish the inequality of slavery, or be excluded! I suppose\r\nNorthern conservatives of the class referred to have endorsed those\r\ndoctrines and declarations of Mr. WEBSTER a thousand times, as sound,\r\nnational, conservative, and constitutional. But no Republican, so far\r\nas I know, has ever proposed to go an inch beyond the line of policy\r\nthey indicated. The Chicago, or Republican Platform, certainly does\r\nnot. And yet that same line of policy, when advocated by Republicans,\r\nis denounced as unsound, sectional, radical, and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nWe have a great deal said about the equality of the States; of the new\r\nwith the original States. This is said to be a fundamental doctrine of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that citizens of the slaveholding States have an equal\r\nright in the Territories with the citizens of the non-slaveholding\r\nStates; and I admit they have. But it is also claimed that they have\r\nthe same right to the protection of property in slaves as property in\r\ncotton. This I deny. There is no such doctrine of State equality in\r\nthe Constitution, nor was any thing like it contemplated by its\r\nframers. On the contrary, the Constitution denied this doctrine by\r\nclear implication, certainly for the first twenty years. It withheld\r\nfrom Congress the power to prohibit the importation of slaves into the\r\n\"existing\" States till 1808, while their importation into the\r\nTerritories and new States might be prohibited at once. Ohio was\r\nadmitted in 1802. Congress had power to prohibit the importation of\r\nslaves into that State from that time, and did do it in effect by the\r\nvery terms and conditions of her admission, which required that her\r\nConstitution and Government should not be repugnant to the ordinance\r\nof the 13th of July, 1787, which interdicted slavery. But Congress had\r\nno power to prohibit the importation of slaves into Georgia till after\r\n1808. Georgia and Ohio, therefore, in this respect, were not political\r\nequals from 1802 to 1808.\r\n\r\nNor have the States been all political equals in the sense claimed,\r\nsince 1808. It will surprise many to be told that there is nothing in\r\nthe Constitution about State equality, and especially nothing that\r\naffirms the equality of the new with the original States, even after\r\n1808. And yet this is true. The only passages which refer to the new\r\nStates, except impliedly in the importation clause, are these: \"New\r\nStates may be admitted by Congress into the Union; but no new State\r\nshall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other\r\nState.\" There is nothing, certainly, in this language to show that the\r\nnew States were to be admitted on an equality, or an equal footing\r\nwith the original States.\r\n\r\nAnd yet provision was made, when the Constitution was framed, for the\r\nadmission of all the new States to be formed in United States\r\nTerritory then possessed, \"on an equal footing with the original\r\nStates.\" But it was a footing of equality which was in nowise\r\ninconsistent with an absolute denial of the right to establish the\r\ninequality of slavery. And this is proved by the only compact in the\r\nEnglish language contemporaneous with the Constitution which touches\r\nthe subject, namely, that part of the fifth article of compact in the\r\nordinance of 1787 which I have already quoted. There can be no shadow\r\nof claim that any thing else secured, or pretended to secure, the\r\nright of new States to admission into the Union on an equal footing\r\nwith the original States. That, I admit, did. It is, to repeat it, in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n     \"Whenever any of said States shall have sixty thousand free\r\n     inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its\r\n     delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an\r\n     equal footing with the original States in all respects\r\n     whatever, and shall be at liberty to form a permanent\r\n     Constitution and State Government; _provided_ the\r\n     Constitution and Government so to be formed, shall be\r\n     republican in conformity to the principles of these\r\n     articles,\" the 6th, which prohibited slavery, included.\r\n\r\nAnd this is all there is, contemporaneous with the Constitution, on\r\nthe subject of the equality of the States. The very instrument, then,\r\nwhich secured the admission of new States, on an equal footing with\r\nthe original States, itself provided that they were never to tolerate\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe new States, then, neither were to have, nor have they, any\r\npolitical equality which the prohibition violates, as Southern\r\ngentlemen contend. Certainly those formed and admitted under the plan\r\nof Government devised by the fathers, have not. In this sense they are\r\nnot political equals. The original States were, from the beginning,\r\nand have ever been, political equals in this and every sense. Not,\r\nhowever, because the Constitution says they are, for it says nothing\r\non the subject; but because they were independent sovereignties, and\r\nas such, made a compact which united them under one Federal\r\nGovernment, with discriminating restrictions upon the subject of\r\nslavery, or upon any other subject. But the fact that the evil and\r\ninequality of slavery existed in the original States, and was\r\ntolerated from necessity, was no reason why it should be allowed in\r\nthe Territories and new States, where it did not and need never exist.\r\nSo the power of the Territories and new States was sufficiently\r\nrestricted to secure equality in personal rights and freedom to all\r\nthe \"inhabitants.\" Of course it cannot be pretended that the mere fact\r\nthat one or more States had established, and had power to perpetuate\r\nslavery, secured to new States the right to establish and perpetuate\r\nthe same enormity, as a necessary result of State equality. That would\r\nmake the right or power of one State, resulting from State equality,\r\nnecessarily coextensive with tolerated evil in another. Manifestly\r\n\"the fathers\" had no such idea as this. Theirs was the common sense\r\nand rational idea that a moral and political evil which existed in the\r\nold States, and could not be removed, need not for that reason be\r\ntolerated in new States.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees to each State a republican form of\r\nGovernment merely; but the ordinance of 1787 provides that the\r\n\"Constitution and Government of each new State shall be republican.\"\r\nWhy this difference? In the original States slavery existed, or in\r\nmost of them; and so far they were anti-republican in fact and\r\npractice, though republican in form. The framers of the Constitution,\r\nhaving no power to abolish this anti-republican institution of slavery\r\nin those States, did nothing more than guarantee them Governments\r\nrepublican in form. But having the power to exclude it from the new\r\nStates, they did exclude it, and provided that their constitutions and\r\ngovernments should be republican. That this was the reason for the\r\ndifference may be inferred from the remark of LUTHER MARTIN, a\r\ndistinguished member of the Federal Convention, that \"slavery is\r\ninconsistent with the genius of republicanism,\" and of General HEATH\r\nin the Massachusetts Convention, that \"Congress has declared that the\r\nnew States shall be republican and have no slavery.\" No other reason\r\ncan be given. Thus republicanism in fact, and not in form merely, was\r\nmade a condition of admitting new States. This is part of the\r\nunalterable compact to which validity was given by the Constitution.\r\nThe Constitution, therefore, while it guarantees a republican form of\r\ngovernment, does in fact, by giving validity to the ordinance,\r\nguarantee republican governments to the new States. This is another\r\nvery significant fact harmonizing perfectly with all the other facts\r\nin the original plan for extending the Union by admitting States from\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nThe States are all equals, or not, according to the terms of their\r\nadmission. The original States became members of the Union upon the\r\nsingle condition of ratifying the Constitution, which left them at\r\nliberty to tolerate slavery or not. But the States formed in the only\r\nTerritory which belonged to the United States at the time the\r\nConstitution was framed, were admitted on condition that slavery\r\nshould be perpetually interdicted within their limits, and as parties\r\nto an unalterable compact to that effect.\r\n\r\nSlavery was regarded, South as well as North, when the Constitution\r\nwas adopted, as a moral and political evil. This had been the general\r\nsentiment of the country many years before, and continued to be long\r\nafter that period. The representatives of the extensive district of\r\nDarien in Georgia, on the 12th of January, 1775, spoke of slavery as\r\n\"founded in injustice and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our\r\nliberties.\" JEFFERSON pronounced it \"an injustice and enormity.\" The\r\npresent Chief Justice of the United States, Mr. TANEY, who acted many\r\nyears ago as counsel of Rev. Mr. GRUBER, who was indicted in the State\r\nof Maryland for preaching a sermon on the evils of slavery, spoke as\r\nfollows in his defence:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. GRUBER did quote the language of our great act of\r\n     National Independence, and insisted on the principles\r\n     contained in that venerated instrument. He did rebuke those\r\n     masters who, in the exercise of power, are deaf to the call\r\n     of humanity, and he warned them of the evils they might\r\n     bring upon themselves. He did speak in abhorrence of those\r\n     who live by trading in human flesh, and enrich themselves by\r\n     tearing the husband from the wife, the infant from the bosom\r\n     of the mother, and this was the head and front of his\r\n     offending. So far is he from being the object of punishment\r\n     in any form of proceeding, that we are prepared to maintain\r\n     the same principles, and to use, if necessary, the same\r\n     language here in the Temple of Justice, and in the presence\r\n     of those who are the ministers of the law.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A hard necessity, indeed, compels us to endure the evils of\r\n     slavery for a time. While it continues it is a blot on our\r\n     national character; and every real lover of freedom\r\n     confidently hopes that it will be effectually, though it\r\n     must be gradually, wiped away, and earnestly looks for the\r\n     means by which the necessary object may be best obtained.\r\n     And until it shall be accomplished, until the time shall\r\n     come when we can point, without a blush, to the language\r\n     held in the Declaration of Independence, every part of\r\n     humanity will seek to lighten the galling chain of slavery,\r\n     and better, to the utmost of his power, the wretched\r\n     condition of the slave.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Maryland:--Where did you get that?\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I got it from a printed sermon recently preached by Dr.\r\nORVILLE DEWEY, of Boston.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. CALHOUN, in the United States Senate, in 1838, said that \"many\r\nin the South once believed that slavery was a moral and political\r\nevil;\" and Mr. BUTLER, late a United States Senator from South\r\nCarolina, said in the Senate in 1850, that he \"remembered the time\r\nwhen slavery was regarded as a moral evil, even in South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a state of public sentiment, it is certainly no marvel that\r\nslavery was not allowed to extend into the Territories and new States.\r\nIt was not prohibited in the northwest territory, because it was\r\nsupposed to be, or would become, an evil in that territory\r\nparticularly, or a greater evil there than anywhere else; but because\r\nit was regarded as an evil everywhere, and therefore wrong to permit\r\nits extension anywhere, when there was power to prevent it. There can\r\nbe no doubt it would have been prohibited in the Territories and new\r\nStates of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, if Georgia and North\r\nCarolina, previous to the Federal Convention, had ceded them to the\r\nUnited States upon the same conditions Virginia had ceded the\r\nnorthwest territory. Proof of this is found in the fact that the plan\r\nof territorial governments interdicting slavery forever after 1800,\r\nembraced all territory ceded, or to be ceded by individual States; and\r\nstill further proof is in the fact, that the cessions by Georgia and\r\nNorth Carolina, after the adoption of the Constitution, were upon the\r\nexpress condition that slavery should not be prohibited; thereby\r\nshowing that the policy of the Federal Government, as they understood\r\nit, was restrictive of slavery in the far southern latitudes as well\r\nas in the more northern, and that they expected the power to restrict\r\nwould be exercised, if not withheld in the deeds of cession. A\r\nproposition was, in fact, made to apply the anti-slavery clause of\r\n1787, to all the southern part of the Mississippi territory, now the\r\nsouthern parts of Alabama and Mississippi, by the act of April 7th,\r\n1798, it being supposed at one time that it belonged to the United\r\nStates; but the debate shows that the proposition was withdrawn\r\nbecause the jurisdiction was in Georgia, or because not five members\r\nof Congress, after the question was examined, believed otherwise.\r\nGeorgia claimed absolute title and right of jurisdiction, and denied\r\nall right on the part of the United States to interfere with slavery.\r\nCongress did, however, prohibit the importation of slaves into the\r\nterritory, and declare every slave so imported to be entitled to his\r\nfreedom. This was probably wholly unauthorized, as it was six years\r\nbefore Georgia ceded it to the United States, and ten years before\r\nCongress had power to prohibit the importation of slaves into that\r\nState. But these facts show a strong disposition on the part of \"the\r\nfathers\" to curtail and circumscribe slavery, even in the far south,\r\nand at the hazard, too, of exercising doubtful power.\r\n\r\nNothing can be clearer than that the original States had a right to\r\nform a Federal Government on such terms as to themselves as they\r\ncould mutually agree upon, and to fix the terms upon which they would\r\npermit new members to be admitted. The Northern States were under no\r\nobligation to protect slavery at all, not even by permitting fugitives\r\nto be reclaimed within their limits. If, then, they were willing to\r\nconcede that right to the original States, only upon condition that\r\nslavery should not be allowed to extend, who will say they had not a\r\nright to make that condition, or that, if agreed to, it would not be\r\nvalid and binding? With their views of slavery, believing it to be a\r\nmoral and political evil, it was certainly their first and highest\r\nduty to make effectual provision against its extension, before\r\nundertaking, for any reason, to give the least protection to it. Such\r\nprovision they supposed they had made, and it was this that justified\r\nthem, if any thing could, in conceding the right of reclamation.\r\n\r\nThe free, or northern States, in the exercise of their admitted right\r\nin deciding upon the terms of Union, insisted on making it a\r\nfundamental and ever-binding condition that no obligation to protect\r\nslavery in Illinois should ever exist; and this was done for reasons\r\nwhich render it morally certain that they would have insisted on the\r\nsame condition in reference to Missouri, if Missouri had been part of\r\nthe original territory. It would be preposterous to suppose that while\r\nthey would not consent to guarantee slavery in any manner in Illinois,\r\nbecause they believed it to be a moral and political evil, they meant\r\nat the same time to make a Government that could obligate them to\r\nguarantee it in the adjoining Territory or State of Missouri, either\r\nby the return of fugitive slaves, or in any other manner. They meant\r\nno such thing, nor can an honest interpretation of the terms of union\r\nbind them to such guarantee now. The right to recapture fugitive\r\nslaves could not exist without the consent of the free States; and as\r\nthat consent was given upon conditions and with limitations, by\r\nnecessary implication and every sound principle of construction, they\r\nreserved the right to say whether it should exist upon other\r\nconditions and with other limitations, or without either condition or\r\nlimitation.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--No one from Kentucky or Virginia wishes to alter the\r\nordinance of 1787. For GOD'S sake spare us the argument.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I understand no alteration is proposed in the\r\nordinance; nor am I arguing against any such proposition. I am showing\r\nwhat the policy of 1787 was, and what the compact of the fathers was.\r\nAnd I am doing this because it is in the spirit of that policy and\r\ncompact that Kentucky and Virginia tell us they wish to have this\r\ncontroversy adjusted. Massachusetts and the other Northern States\r\nmeant to fix, and supposed they had fixed, a limit to their connection\r\nwith, and responsibility for slavery. By consenting to the clause\r\nwhich secured the right of reclamation, they did become responsible\r\nfor it to a certain extent. So far as it was supposed, when that\r\nclause was agreed to, that its effect would be the recapture of\r\nfugitive slaves, and their return to bondage, and so far as the\r\npurpose was to make such recapture and return lawful, so far the\r\nresponsibility of adding to the security of slavery was voluntarily\r\nassumed. But this was limited to the existing States by excluding\r\nslavery from all United States territory. If any part of such\r\nterritory had been left for slavery--enough for a single slave\r\nState--it might be said that its extension from a part was for reasons\r\napplicable only to a part, and so could not be considered as\r\nestablishing the principle of non-extension. But now this cannot be\r\nsaid. Not a foot was left for slavery.\r\n\r\nWe thus see what the state of things would have been to-day if foreign\r\nterritory had not been acquired. Such acquisitions were not originally\r\ncontemplated, and of course not provided for. The first--Louisiana--was\r\ndeemed unconstitutional by Mr. JEFFERSON, and yet it was made while he\r\nwas President; but with no right, \"according to the spirit of the\r\ncompact of the fathers,\" to place the Federal Government or the States\r\nunder any other relation to slavery in subsequently acquired territory\r\nthan that which they sustained to it--the only one they would consent\r\nto sustain--in the Territories possessed at the time that compact was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nA great deal is said about State rights. But the doctrine of State\r\nrights proves too much. Massachusetts had a clear and undoubted right\r\noriginally to limit her obligations upon this subject. And she did\r\nlimit them. The original compromise was \"better security\" to slavery\r\nin the original States, with no extension of it to the Territories and\r\nnew States. This better security was the accepted consideration for\r\nwaiving the right to extend, and Massachusetts may rightfully insist\r\non this waived right to extend, so long as this \"better security\" is\r\ndemanded of her.\r\n\r\nSouthern gentlemen in this Convention propose to be governed by the\r\nprinciples of the founders of the Government, and by the Constitution,\r\nor compact of union, as those founders understood it. By that they say\r\nthey are willing to do as the fathers did, and adjust the present\r\nunhappy controversy by applying to new territory the same principles\r\nwhich the fathers applied to the old. Let me assure gentlemen from the\r\nslave States that if they are really in earnest in offering these\r\nterms of adjustment, this unhappy controversy can be settled in less\r\nthan an hour's time. Having always claimed the right to recapture\r\nfugitive slaves in territory acquired since, as well as in that\r\nacquired before the adoption of the Constitution, the slave States\r\nhave ever been bound, upon every principle of honor and fair dealing,\r\nto concede the original consideration for it, that is, prohibition. A\r\npurpose secretly entertained when that compromise was made, to use the\r\nGovernment in the manner it has actually been used, to enlarge the\r\narea of slavery and the obligation to guarantee it, would have been\r\ndishonest and fraudulent; but the fact that this purpose was conceived\r\nafterward, as it doubtless was, does not alter the case a whit. No man\r\npossessed of the facts can honestly claim that the bargain between the\r\nNorth and South, interpreted according to the true interest and\r\nmeaning of both parties at the time of making it, can justify the\r\nextension of slavery a rod beyond the original States, or a particle\r\nof protection to it beyond the right to recover fugitives from such\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown, as I think I have, that an essential element in the\r\nbasis of the \"more perfect Union\" on the question of slavery, was the\r\nprinciple of non-extension, we find the first failure to assert this\r\nprinciple was in the omission to apply it to the Louisiana purchase.\r\nThe importation of slaves into that territory was immediately\r\nprohibited. That probably cut off the only source of supply from which\r\ndanger of extension was then apprehended. The policy of the Government\r\nwas well understood, and no apprehension of a practical departure from\r\nit existed. There was nothing in the circumstance of the purchase, or\r\nthe reasons for making it, to excite such apprehension. But it was\r\nseen on the application of Missouri for admission, that the ordinance\r\nof 1787 should have been applied to it at the time of the purchase. If\r\nit had been, Louisiana, Missouri, and Arkansas would never have become\r\nslave States (the few slaves in New Orleans and vicinity being\r\nemancipated, as they should have been, upon some equitable principle),\r\nand the Missouri Compromise, which was the second departure from the\r\noriginal policy, would never have been made. The third was the\r\nannexation of Texas as a slave State, and the argument to divide it\r\ninto three or four more. Annexation led to the war with Mexico, and\r\nthe acquisition of a large part of her territory, and to the\r\ncompromise of 1850, by which it was Congressionally agreed that the\r\nStates formed in that territory might be admitted with slavery, if\r\ntheir Constitutions should so prescribe. This was the fourth departure\r\nfrom the original policy of prohibition. The fifth was the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise in 1850, and the attempts to subjugate and\r\nenslave Kansas. That repeal made the change from the original policy\r\nradical and total. Certainly it is high time \"to restore the Union and\r\nConstitution in the spirit in which they were established by the\r\nfathers.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, I propose to begin the work of \"restoring the policy of\r\n1787,\" by applying the ordinance of 1787 to every foot of organized\r\nand unorganized territory, wherever situated, which now belongs to the\r\nUnited States, precisely as the fathers applied it to every foot of\r\nsuch territory at the time the Constitution was made; and I ask, in\r\nall earnestness and seriousness, what any member of the Convention can\r\nhave to say against this, who sincerely desires to \"restore the Union\r\nand Constitution in the spirit in which they were established by the\r\nfathers of the Republic,\" and is \"ready to adjust the present unhappy\r\ncontroversy\" in the same spirit? What, I beg to know, can be said\r\nagainst this mode of adjustment by those who are in favor of a\r\n\"restoration of the Constitution to the principles and landmarks of\r\nour fathers,\" and of a \"return to the policy of 1787\"? Can any man\r\ndoubt that that ordinance would have been extended over all these\r\nterritories in 1787, if they had belonged to the United States at that\r\ntime? Let slavery, then, be prohibited now precisely as the fathers\r\nprohibited it then. Copy that old ordinance word for word, and give it\r\nlegal force and effect, and make it the basis of all laws, and all\r\nconstitutions, and all governments in these Territories forever,\r\nbecause the fathers gave it such force and effect, and made it the\r\nbasis of all laws, and all constitutions and all governments forever\r\nin all the Territories of the Union, in 1787. If that would not be a\r\nreturn to the \"principles and landmarks of the fathers,\" and to the\r\n\"policy of 1787,\" then I beg to know what would be? How is it\r\npossible--I put it to you, gentlemen of the South--how is it possible\r\nto persuade yourselves that the principles and policy of 1787 can be\r\nrestored by adopting the resolutions of the General Assembly of\r\nVirginia? By what process is it that the gentleman (Mr. SEDDON) from\r\nVirginia, has come to believe that the South is entitled, according to\r\nthe spirit of the compact of the fathers, \"to the added guarantees\" of\r\nwhich he speaks? According to the spirit of that compact it is\r\nmanifest the slave States are entitled to no added guarantees.\r\n\r\nBut another of the Virginia Commissioners (Mr. RIVES) tells us that\r\nthis question of slavery in nowise concerns the free States. On this\r\npoint I will quote from a very high authority, which Virginia,\r\ncertainly, will respect. Mr. MADISON was a member of the first\r\nCongress under the Constitution. A colleague of his, Mr. PARKER,\r\nproposed a duty on the importation of slaves, and said he \"hoped\r\nCongress would do all that lay in their power to restore to human\r\nnature its inherent privileges, and, if possible, wipe off the stigma\r\nunder which America labors.\" Mr. MADISON, in remarking on that\r\nproposition, among other things said:\r\n\r\n     \"Every addition the States receive to their number of slaves\r\n     tends to weaken and render them less capable of\r\n     self-defence. In case of hostilities with foreign nations,\r\n     they will be the means of inviting attack instead of\r\n     repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty of the General\r\n     Government to protect every part of their confines against\r\n     danger, as well internal as external. Every thing,\r\n     therefore, which tends to increase danger, though it be a\r\n     local affair, yet, if it involve national expense and\r\n     safety, becomes of concern to every part of the Union, and\r\n     is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged\r\n     with the general administration of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we hear, too, a great deal about war, civil war, if this unhappy\r\ncontroversy is not satisfactorily adjusted, which means upon the\r\nterms proposed by the slave States. But do gentlemen mean that an\r\nappeal will be made to the sword, unless the Constitution shall be so\r\namended as to \"provide that slavery of the African race shall be\r\neffectually protected as property in all the territory of the United\r\nStates, now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude 36°\r\n30´\"?--which is the proposition of Virginia. If that is what is meant,\r\nthen let me, before I close, read an extract from one of the last\r\nspeeches made by HENRY CLAY in the Senate of the United States. It is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"If, unhappily, we should be involved in war, civil war,\r\n     between the two portions of this Confederacy, in which the\r\n     effort upon the one side should be to restrain the\r\n     introduction of slavery into the new Territories, and upon\r\n     the other side to force its introduction there, what a\r\n     spectacle should we present to the astonishment of mankind,\r\n     in an effort, not to propagate rights, but--I must say it,\r\n     though I trust it will be understood to be said with no\r\n     design to excite feeling--a war to propagate wrongs!\"\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD moved an adjournment.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON objected, raising the question of order. He claimed that\r\nthe Conference, by adopting the resolutions of Mr. RANDOLPH, had fixed\r\nthe limits of the sessions, from 10 o'clock A.M., to 4 o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. HOWARD was not concurred in.\r\n\r\nMr. LOOMIS:--I feel that this is an important crisis in the affairs of\r\nthe country. Perhaps it is the most important that ever occurred in\r\nAmerican history. The first Convention of thirteen scattered States\r\nwas earnestly engaged in protecting the liberties which had been won\r\nin the Revolution. It gave us a Constitution under which, for more\r\nthan seventy years, we have lived prosperously and happily. Now\r\npolitical contests have taken place. New questions have arisen, and\r\none portion of the Union believes the Constitution inadequate to\r\nprotect its interests. The question which we are obliged to consider\r\nis: How shall we save the country? Disguise it as we may, deceive\r\nourselves as we may, the country is in danger--in great and imminent\r\ndanger. A solemn duty is imposed upon each one of us. How shall we\r\nsave the country?\r\n\r\nVirginia has invited this conference of her sister States.\r\nPennsylvania responded to her call with all activity. Pennsylvania has\r\nresponded because she understood and appreciated Virginia. There is\r\ngreat misapprehension in the North concerning this venerated State,\r\nas well in regard to her motives as in regard to the principles and\r\nfeelings that influence her people in their intercourse with and their\r\naction toward other States of the Union. I know Virginia well. I have\r\nassociated with her people. I have practiced before her judicial\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I was greatly pressed by an abolitionist who was\r\nindicted in Virginia, to undertake his defence. He was very fearful\r\nthat he would not receive an impartial trial, that the court and jury\r\nwould participate in the public excitement. I told him that he need\r\nindulge in no such misapprehensions. I knew Virginia too well for\r\nthat. I told him, however, that if he desired it, I would go; but it\r\nwas simply to defend him, and secure him a fair trial--to act as his\r\ncounsel. I could not represent his sentiments, for I am not and never\r\nwas an abolitionist. I assumed his defence. I told him I would go, and\r\nI went. I did find great excitement there, but it did not surprise me.\r\nMany valuable slaves had shortly before escaped, some of them through\r\nthe assistance and instrumentality of my client. Judge Fry was the\r\npresiding judge of the court. His liberality, and that of all his\r\nofficers, was great--as great as I ever enjoyed in my own State. The\r\nsheriff of the county drew thirty-six jurymen. Of these, twelve were\r\nslaveholders, twelve were abolitionists, and twelve were\r\nnon-slaveholders. When the jury was finally empannelled it consisted\r\nof nine abolitionists and three non-slaveholders.\r\n\r\nI never saw in my whole professional life a trial conducted with\r\ngreater fairness or justice. The whole of it was entirely satisfactory\r\nto myself, and I believe to my client.\r\n\r\nI have ever since entertained a feeling of the highest respect for\r\nVirginia. Her abstractions I confess I could never understand, nor did\r\nI ever wish to. They are her exclusive property, and she never uses\r\nthem to the injury of her neighbors. If she chooses to make the\r\nresolutions of '98 a matter of importance, I do not know that anybody\r\nis injured.\r\n\r\nI regretted to hear the imputations upon Virginia which some gentlemen\r\nhave seen fit to make. Menace is not the habit of that ancient\r\ncommonwealth. She does not indulge in it, and it would not become her.\r\nThe gentleman from New York intimated that if a State came to him with\r\na menace he would meet it with a menace. In this I agree with him. If\r\nVirginia came here with a menace I should meet her with defiance. But\r\nhappily for us we have no occasion to consider the question in this\r\nlight. If ever a State came to meet her sisters, to consult for the\r\ncommon good in a proper spirit, Virginia does so now.\r\n\r\nA military chieftain once, when approaching his death, lamented that\r\nhe had no children to transmit his name and his qualities to\r\nposterity. Virginia will never need to take up such a lamentation. She\r\nhas children enough. She is the mother of WASHINGTON and JEFFERSON, of\r\nMADISON, MARSHALL, and CLAY. Rightly and justly she has been called\r\nthe mother of States. She is the mother of States, and of millions of\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\nI honor and respect Virginia, for she deserves it. She was among the\r\nforemost in the Revolutionary struggle; and since it was terminated,\r\nshe has exhibited a continued example of patriotism and loyalty. Her\r\nsons have been among the ablest in our legislative councils, and even\r\nto-day she sets a noble example before the country, for the emulation\r\nof her sister States. Our interests are inseparably connected with her\r\nown. We will acknowledge the fact, and act in view of it. Let her\r\nremember, also, that she has a common interest with us. She will do so\r\nbecause she will be faithful to her old traditions as well as to her\r\npresent duty.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that the time has come when it is necessary for us to\r\ncontemplate a dissolution of the Union. The people are not prepared\r\nfor such an awful event. We do not yet know how heavy sacrifices they\r\nwill make to avoid it. Some States have left us I know, but I believe\r\ntheir absence is but temporary. We must have them back, and we will.\r\nAs for the Border States leaving us in the present condition of\r\naffairs, with the present feeling of friendship for them, _that_ I\r\nregard as an impossibility. Why should the Border States go out of the\r\nUnion when three-fourths of the present Congress are ready to give\r\nthem all the guarantees they ask?\r\n\r\nBut let not Pennsylvania be misunderstood in her position. She will\r\nyield a vast deal for peace. She will examine and recognize the rights\r\nof every section of the country. She believes that when this is done,\r\nit is the duty of all to stand by the Union. She believes that the\r\nBorder States cannot connect themselves with a so-called Southern\r\nConfederacy without involving themselves in a vortex of ruin. The\r\nPresident of the Southern Confederacy already talks about the smell of\r\ngunpowder, and about battles at the North. Well! he is a brave man no\r\ndoubt, but if he will invade Pennsylvania we will resist him.\r\nPennsylvania has gold enough to calm her friends; she has iron enough\r\nto cool her enemies.\r\n\r\nBut Pennsylvania desires no war. She will do all that an honorable\r\nState can do to avoid war. In that temper she sends her delegates\r\nhere, and they will do all that honorable men can do to carry out her\r\nwishes. She has no desire to be a frontier State with her four hundred\r\nmiles of border, which she must guard and protect if disunion takes\r\nplace on the terms suggested. She will do all she can to avoid\r\ndisunion. She is now a central State--the keystone of the arch. She\r\nwants no imaginary line drawn along her border, with herself on one\r\nside of it and enemies upon the other.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has always kept faith with the Union. She has always\r\nperformed all her duties toward the Federal Government with\r\ncheerfulness and fidelity. Her three millions of people are true to\r\nall their obligations now to the Government as well as to her sister\r\nStates. Her voice is for peace. She would at all hazards avoid\r\ndisunion. She would make many sacrifices to avoid civil war. Last of\r\nall, she would do all she could to save the Union; she would never\r\npermit the destruction of the country. My own position is easily\r\ndefined. I fully sympathize with and endorse the position of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOOMIS referred to the election, installation, and\r\n     message of the Governor of Pennsylvania, also to various\r\n     resolutions of political conventions in Pennsylvania, in\r\n     confirmation of his own views of the sentiments of the\r\n     people of that State, and continued:\r\n\r\nI shall dwell but a short time upon the provisions of the proposed\r\namendments. I can live under the Constitution as it is, or as it will\r\nbe if these amendments are adopted. I shall uphold the Constitution. I\r\nshall commit myself to no opposite course. The whole amendment is\r\nconnected with and concerns the question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories. This has always been a fruitful source of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe character of the relation of the Government to the Territories,\r\nand the interests of the States in them, were questions raised in most\r\nof the States when the Constitution was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe compromise of 1820, it was hoped, settled one question concerning\r\nthem--the question of slavery. But upon the repeal of the compromise\r\nthe difficulty was opened again. Pennsylvania never took as ultra\r\nground respecting this subject as many other States. She thought its\r\nimportance was magnified. It is magnified now. If the South secured\r\nthe amendment proposed it would not avail her much. The granting of it\r\nwould not injure the North. The territory is unfitted for the\r\nprofitable employment of slave labor. That is shown by experience. In\r\nten years scarcely ten slaves had found their way into New Mexico and\r\nArizona.\r\n\r\nThis is a question of sectional interest, and may be one, to some\r\nextent, of political power. Examine, for a moment, the true interests\r\nof both the North and South, in the question as it is now presented. I\r\nmean the interest of the extremes, for the Border States certainly\r\ncannot have a very deep interest in it. They lay between the two\r\nsections, and to some extent sympathize with both. The valuable\r\nportion of our present territory is north of the line proposed. It is\r\nrich in agricultural and mineral resources. It will be changed in time\r\ninto a number of powerful and wealthy States. Is it not desirable now\r\nto exclude slavery from them forever? Then as to the territory south.\r\nIt is smaller in extent, and almost infinitely less valuable. Much of\r\nit is barren desert which can never be cultivated. Considered as a\r\nmaterial interest, the South is asking but little. The North is giving\r\nup almost nothing, by agreeing to give the South the control of this\r\nsection while it remains a territory. But the South does not ask even\r\nthat. She simply asks to have those rights guaranteed, the existence\r\nof which are already practically conceded.\r\n\r\nAs to future territory, I would raise no question about it. We want no\r\nmore territory north or south. Its acquisition would only be attended\r\nwith new troubles. New questions would be raised to threaten the quiet\r\nof the country and the stability of our institutions. Why should we\r\ntrouble ourselves about the acquisition of new territory when we have\r\nalready enough for one hundred millions of people?\r\n\r\nWe may form a Constitution which will be entirely satisfactory to the\r\nnation now. We may extend our territory in such a way as to render a\r\nchange indispensable. Considerations of climate and race will be\r\nconstantly occurring, which will require new changes. The Federal\r\nConstitution may have been well enough adapted to the four millions of\r\npeople to whom it was first applied, and it is not strange that the\r\ngrowth of the nation, and the new interests which have since arisen,\r\nshould require some changes now. I say that we need no more territory.\r\n\r\nWhat objection, then, can there be to compromising this matter, to\r\narranging it to the satisfaction of all parties, if the rights of all\r\ncan be regarded and secured? The course which I would follow in such a\r\ncase, would be that indicated by traditional policy of statesmen in\r\nwhom our people have had confidence--the policy of such men as\r\nHARRISON and HENRY CLAY.\r\n\r\nI do not regard the provisions relating to slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia as of any practical consequence to the North. Pennsylvania\r\ncares little about it. There would seem to be a propriety in\r\ncountenancing slavery here so long as it exists in the adjoining\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Border States ask us now for these guarantees. They ask them\r\nearnestly and in a spirit of loyalty to the Union. My answer to such a\r\nrequest, urged in such a spirit, is, that I would give them any\r\nguarantees I could within the limits of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania forms one of the brotherhood of States. She is in the\r\nUnion, and she will remain there. She is bound to it by all the\r\nmemories and associations of the past, and by all the hopes of the\r\nfuture. She will discharge, as she always has discharged, all her\r\nduties, all her obligations to the Union. No State exceeds her in\r\ndevotion to it. But, at the same time, she will not be unmindful of\r\nher duties and her obligations to the other States. She would\r\ndischarge these obligations as she can afford to discharge them, in a\r\nspirit of generosity and conciliation. In that spirit she will give\r\nher assent to these propositions of amendment. I believe I have fairly\r\nrepresented the opinions of Pennsylvania in what I have said, and I\r\nrely upon her people--my constituents--for my justification.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I will consult the pleasure of the Conference\r\nwhether I shall proceed with my observations now, or during the\r\nevening session?\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD: I think the Conference had better adjourn. I make the\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted, and the Conference adjourned to meet at\r\nhalf-past seven o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION--FOURTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, THURSDAY, _February 21st, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order at half-past seven o'clock, Mr.\r\nALEXANDER in the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN: I feel gratified by the kindness which has given me an\r\nopportunity of making a few observations to the Conference, and I\r\nshall not abuse it.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from Vermont have acted throughout the session under\r\ngreat embarrassment. We hold our appointments from the Executive of\r\nthat State. Her Legislature was not in session when the Virginia\r\nResolutions were adopted, and the day fixed for the meeting of the\r\nConference was so early that no time was given to the Governor of\r\nVermont for consultation, or for taking any other means of\r\nascertaining the temper of the State in relation to the Virginia plan.\r\nWe were summoned by telegraph--myself upon an hour's notice--to come\r\nhere, and we obeyed the summons.\r\n\r\nBy the rules of the Conference we are prohibited from correspondence\r\nwith our constituents upon the subject of its action, and we are\r\nentirely without recent information concerning their views and wishes.\r\nBut one course remains to us, and that we must inflexibly pursue. That\r\nis, to apply the propositions upon which we are called to vote, to the\r\nknown and established opinions of our people upon the principles\r\ninvolved in them; and if these principles coincide with their\r\nopinions, to give our assent; if they do not, to withhold it. We hold\r\nit our duty to respect and obey the opinions of our constituents; and\r\nin our action here, such obedience is a pleasure.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, before referring to the merits or demerits of these\r\npropositions, I wish to be informed distinctly upon one point. One\r\nsection of the Union requires guarantees; the other does not. Here are\r\ntwo parties having different interests, proposing to themselves\r\ndifferent courses of action. One of them proposes these guarantees in\r\nthe form of what it calls a compromise. There are many subjects which,\r\nin the experience of life, we are obliged to compromise. All of us\r\nunderstand the meaning of the term. It implies that when two parties\r\ndiffer upon a subject of common interest, each is to yield something\r\nto the other, until both reach an agreement upon a middle ground, and\r\nthe difference is settled. But one consequence always follows, always\r\nmust follow, or it is in nowise a compromise: _Both parties are bound\r\nby the agreement._\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which compromises are effected. When opposing\r\nparties cannot come to an understanding, they agree to submit the\r\nmatters in difference to some tribunal that can decide between them. A\r\nlike consequence always follows from such a proceeding. The parties\r\nagree to _submit_ to the decision, to be _bound_ by it, and mutually\r\nundertake to carry it into effect, whatever the decision may be.\r\n\r\nThere is still another way in which a _political_ compromise may be\r\nmade. Its terms may be agreed upon, and then it may be submitted to\r\nthe people for adoption. When adopted, it becomes the law of the\r\nland--equally binding upon all sections of the country. If it is\r\nrejected, the party which proposed it has secured its submission to\r\nthe proper tribunal--it has been considered, and that party should,\r\nupon every principle of law or morality, acquiesce in the result.\r\n\r\nExcept in one of these three methods I know of no way in which a\r\n_compromise_ can be made. Let us apply these methods to the questions\r\nbefore us. One of them must be adopted if we _compromise_ at all.\r\n\r\nIn fact there is one principle which forms the very foundation of our\r\nGovernment, and it should be kept constantly in mind. We cannot\r\nnegotiate, we cannot legislate, we cannot _compromise_, unless all\r\nparties will acknowledge its binding force. If there is a party that\r\ndoes not acknowledge this, in my judgment that party has no right to\r\nbe here. It is not a Republican party. I do not use this term in a\r\nparty sense, but in the sense which is used in the fourth article in\r\nthe Constitution, where the United States are required to guarantee to\r\nevery State a _republican_ form of Government. The principle to which\r\nI refer is this: That the will of the majority, constitutionally\r\nexpressed, must control the Government, and all questions relating to\r\nit; and that will must be respected and obeyed by the minority.\r\n\r\nNow, if the members representing the free States will accept these\r\npropositions of amendment in good faith--will agree to submit them\r\nthrough Congress to the people of the States, and to be bound by the\r\ndecision of the majority, whatever that decision may be--will you,\r\ngentlemen of the slave States, do the same? I do not refer to the\r\nStates which have undertaken to withdraw from the Union. I only call\r\nupon the members for the States here represented. You have the right\r\nto speak for your respective States. You are sent here for that\r\npurpose. You ask us to give our votes for proposals which are\r\ncertainly unpleasant, not to say offensive to us, and to use such\r\ninfluence as we possess to induce Congress to submit these to the\r\npeople. You express the highest degree of confidence in the result.\r\nThis is _your_ plan of compromise. If we resist it, you charge us with\r\nstanding between the people and your plan--of sacrificing the Union to\r\nour platform. Very well. If we will submit your propositions to the\r\npeople, and agree to be bound by and to acquiesce in their decision,\r\nwill you do the same? If you will, it may be of service to protract\r\nthis discussion, to make these propositions as acceptable as possible.\r\nIf you will not, we are wasting time. We may as well stop here.\r\nBelieve me, sir, Vermont, as well as every other free State, will have\r\ntoo much self-respect to agree to the terms of a compromise which will\r\nbind one party and will not bind the other.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing farther which we must understand. It has been\r\nfrequently referred to in debate, and I shall not enlarge upon it.\r\nTime must elapse before these propositions can be acted upon. The free\r\nStates expect faithfully to observe all their duties to the General\r\nGovernment--to keep faith with it as they always have. Will the slave\r\nStates do the same? Will they not only _not obstruct_ the Government\r\nin the execution of the laws, but will they _aid_ the Government in\r\nexecuting the laws? The answer to this inquiry is as important as the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nNow, it is useless to tell the people of the free States, that such is\r\nthe present condition of the South, such is the apprehension and\r\ndistrust prevailing there, that we must give them these guarantees at\r\nonce, without any longer delay or discussion--that if we do not they\r\nwill secede. Such an argument as that, sir, is an unworthy argument;\r\nit is unfit to be used in an assembly of men met to confer upon the\r\nConstitution. This is not the way in which good constitutions are\r\nmade, for one of the several parties to present its ultimatum, and\r\nthen insist upon its adoption, under the threat that if it is not\r\nadopted they will go no farther. If such is the true condition of\r\naffairs in some of the States, and the gentlemen representing them are\r\nthe best judges, then before proceeding to amend the Constitution to\r\nsatisfy them, I think we had better try to put them into a frame of\r\nmind suitable for negotiation. A Constitution adopted in that way\r\nwould be good for nothing. Let it once be understood that such claims\r\nwill be recognized, and we shall have amendments to the Constitution\r\nproposed as often as any section can find a pretext for proposing\r\nthem. The agreeable course to us all would be to yield to your\r\npressing appeals. But you ask us to compromise upon most extraordinary\r\nterms. You will not give us the slightest assurance that the people of\r\nthe slave States will acquiesce in the vote of the whole people upon\r\nyour propositions. You even say, you will not acquiesce, if the\r\ndecision is adverse. You are in doubt if they will be satisfied if the\r\ndecision is in their favor; and some gentlemen frankly avow that these\r\npropositions in themselves are not satisfactory. The gentleman from\r\nVirginia, with an openness and a frankness which seems a part of his\r\nnature, tells us in substance that Virginia will not be satisfied with\r\nthese; that Virginia is settled in her determination that slave\r\nproperty shall be respected; that it has as high a right to protection\r\nas any other property, and in some respects higher; that Virginia will\r\nhave these rights acknowledged and secured _under_ the Constitution,\r\nor she will not be satisfied. The statement that she will _not be\r\nsatisfied_, has a very peculiar and expressive signification.\r\n\r\nSuch being our present condition, I have little hope that good can\r\ncome of our deliberations. We have started wrong. We should have\r\nsettled the questions first, that the Union must be preserved, the\r\nlaws enforced, and the duty of every State toward the Union performed,\r\nin every contingency and under all circumstances. Having resolved\r\nthis, we could then go on, carefully consider the wants of every\r\nsection, and we could afford to be generous in meeting the views of\r\nour Southern friends.\r\n\r\nI feel more diffidence than I can well express in being obliged to\r\ndiffer so widely from the opinions of the gentlemen who have\r\nintroduced the proposals contained in the majority report, and who\r\nhave advocated them with such signal ability. I have less hesitation\r\nin expressing my unqualified dissent from the representatives of the\r\nfree States, who pledge the people of those States so unreservedly to\r\nthe support of these propositions, if Congress will submit them to\r\ntheir constituents. I object to these pledges, because I know they are\r\ndeceptive, that they are made without authority, and that they will\r\nnever be fulfilled. The South may as well understand this now, as\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Union is precious to the people of the free States. They look upon\r\nit with a feeling closely approaching to reverence. They have looked\r\nupon its dissolution as the greatest national calamity possible. They\r\nhave been taught to regard the idea of dissolution as a sin. Now, when\r\nthe subject is forced upon their attention, when Conventions are\r\ncalled throughout the South to discuss it, when in some of the States\r\nthe process has already commenced, I am well aware they will make\r\nheavy sacrifices to preserve the Union. They will sacrifice their\r\nprosperity, political influence, friendship, social relations, yes,\r\ntheir lives, to secure its perpetuity. But they will not sacrifice\r\ntheir principles which they have conscientiously adopted. No, not even\r\nto save the Union.\r\n\r\nBut let me not be misunderstood. A Government that cannot be\r\nmaintained without the sacrifice of those principles upon which all\r\ngood governments are founded, is not worth preserving. Such is not the\r\ncase with _ours_. Its preservation requires no such sacrifice; and if\r\nwe made it, the sacrifice would be useless. The habit once commenced,\r\nwe should be called upon to repeat it over and over again, until at\r\nlength we should have a Government destitute of principle.\r\n\r\nThe people of the slave States believe that slavery is a desirable\r\ninstitution, that a Government founded upon it would be most\r\ndesirable. It has been declared here, that it is even a missionary\r\ninstitution, and that the North, in attempting to overthrow it,\r\ninterposes between the slaveholder and his Maker, thereby preventing\r\nhim from performing a duty toward the African race which his ownership\r\nimposes upon his conscience. Well, that is a question between\r\nyourselves and your consciences. We do not wish to interfere. Keep the\r\ninstitution within your own State limits, and we are content that you\r\nshould have all the credit, and honor, and glory that pertains to it.\r\nOver and over again the truth has been asserted here, that there never\r\nhas been, and is not now, any party, or any considerable number of men\r\nin the free States, who entertain the idea of interfering with slavery\r\nin the States. The opinions of a few rash men who entertain other\r\nviews, are no more respected among us than among yourselves.\r\n\r\nBut the growth and extension of slavery outside of State limits, in\r\nthe Territories which are our common property, present a very\r\ndifferent question. If the North permits it there, to that extent it\r\nbecomes responsible for slavery. I do not care what term you use to\r\ndescribe the feeling of the North in relation to slavery. One\r\ngentleman says that the North _abhors_ it, and the use of the term has\r\nexcited much comment. I may be still more unfortunate, but it is my\r\nduty to say that you cannot present an idea more repulsive to the\r\nnorthern mind or the northern conscience, than that of making the\r\nNorth responsible for the existence, expansion, growth, extension, or\r\nany thing else relating to slavery. Right or wrong, this sentiment has\r\ntaken a firm hold of the northern mind. There it is, and it must be\r\ntaken into account in every proposition which depends for its success\r\nupon the action of the North. Sneering at it will do no good; abuse\r\nwill only make it stronger. You cannot legislate it out of existence.\r\nFrom this time forward, as long as the nation has an existence, you\r\nmust expect the determined opposition of the North to the extension of\r\nslavery into free territory. If your proposals of amendment involve\r\n_that_, we may accept them, Congress may propose them, the South may\r\nadopt them; but the answer of the North to them all will be an\r\nemphatic, a determined, _No!_\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--If you Republicans will let us go to the people, we\r\nwill show you what they will do. I think I understand the wishes and\r\nfeelings of the people of the North.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--No doubt. The gentleman says he supported the BELL\r\nand EVERETT ticket. The record of his State shows to what extent his\r\nopinions are in sympathy with those of the people of the North.\r\n\r\nMr. President, for a time I did expect profitable results from this\r\nConference. As I watched it from day to day, it seemed to me that\r\ngenerally the States had been very fortunate in the selection of their\r\nrepresentatives; that few of extreme opinions had been selected; and\r\nthat such a body, animated by common love for the Union, and by a\r\ncommon desire to secure a perpetuity of its blessings, must finally\r\ncome to an agreement which would satisfy all; or if not, to an\r\nagreement in which all would acquiesce. In that belief I had\r\ndetermined to give my assent to the most extreme propositions which\r\nmight be made here, that did not run counter to the position of my\r\nState upon the question of slavery extension, if those propositions\r\nwould quiet the country and settle our present difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut when I heard it announced on this floor that the propositions\r\ncontained in the majority report even, which do provide for the\r\nextension of slavery into the Territories, which involve a direct\r\nconstitutional recognition of slavery for the first time, which place\r\nit above and beyond legislation, which take it out of the hands of\r\nposterity, which compel the North to pay for fugitives; and when I\r\nheard it stated that even these were not enough to satisfy the South,\r\nthat Virginia must have something more, that she was \"solemnly pledged\r\nagainst coercion, that she would not agree to abide by the decision of\r\nthe people upon these propositions,\" then hope went out from my heart!\r\nI have not since had any expectation that much good would come from\r\nour deliberations.\r\n\r\nI have refrained from entering into the merits or demerits of slavery.\r\nI have refrained, so far as I could, from repeating what has been\r\nbetter said by others than I could say it. The point which I wish to\r\npress upon the Conference is this: Speaking for one State, we frankly\r\ntell you that she will not enter upon a compromise which is not fair\r\nand mutual, which does not bind both parties.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, although I have thus expressed myself, I do not at all\r\ndespair of the Republic. I do not believe that a dissolution or\r\ndestruction of this Government is to take place. Its origin and its\r\nexistence have been characterized by too many signal interpositions of\r\nProvidential favor. We cannot look into the future. I have no desire\r\nto do so. If we all conscientiously perform our prescribed duties, if\r\nwe are faithful to ourselves, to our people and our Constitution, HE\r\nwho rules the nations will take care of the rest. It may be that the\r\nclouds which now cover our horizon will be swept away, carrying with\r\nthem all these subjects of difficulty and danger, which alone have\r\ntroubled the quiet and the prosperity of the American Union.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--Instead of dreaming, like Mr. FIELD, of news from the seat\r\nof war, and of marching armies, I have thought of a country through\r\nwhich armies _have_ marched, leaving in their track the desolation of\r\na desert. I have thought of harvests trampled down--of towns and\r\nvillages once the seat of happiness and prosperity, reduced to heaps\r\nof smoking ruins--of battle-fields red with blood which has been shed\r\nby those who ought to have been brothers--of families broken up, or\r\nreduced to poverty; of widowed wives, of orphan children, and all the\r\nother misfortunes which are inseparably connected with war. This is\r\nthe picture which presents itself to my mind every day and every hour.\r\nIt is a picture which we are doomed soon to witness in our own\r\ncountry, unless we place a restraint upon our passions, forget our\r\nselfish interests, and do something to save our country.\r\n\r\nWe feel these things deeply in the Border States. The people of these\r\nStates bear the most intimate relations to each other. They are\r\nclosely connected in business. They associate in their recreations and\r\ntheir pleasures. The members of a large number of their families have\r\nintermarried. State lines, except for legislative purposes, are\r\nscarcely thought of. The people of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois, are one people, having an identity of sympathy, of feeling,\r\nand of interest.\r\n\r\nWe have in the West a section of country known as the dark and bloody\r\nground. The historical incidents connected with it are of the most sad\r\nand mournful character. There is buried under it an ancestor of almost\r\nevery family descended from the early settlers of the West. But this\r\nground is limited in extent. If we are to plunge this country into\r\ncivil war--if we are to go on exasperating the sections until they\r\ntake up arms against each other, then shall we make a dark and bloody\r\nground of all the Border States. We shall desolate all their fields,\r\nand carry sorrow and mourning into every family within their limits.\r\n\r\nShould we not have a deep interest in avoiding war? Should we not\r\nlabor with, and entreat the people of all sections to help us avoid\r\nit? If it comes, we are to be the sufferers. Upon _our_ heads the ruin\r\nmust fall. We cannot and will not talk about abstractions now. We are\r\nimpelled by every consideration to do all we can to settle our\r\ndifferences, and keep off the evil day that brings civil war upon our\r\nhappy and prosperous country, and to prevent the devastation of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a few earnest words to my brother Republicans. You\r\nobject to these propositions because they are pressed just now when\r\nthe new administration is coming into power. You say that there is no\r\nneed of them, and that they involve submission on your part, as a\r\ncondition of your enjoying the fruits of the victory you have won. Let\r\nme assure you that no one labored harder for the triumph of Mr.\r\nLINCOLN than myself; I exerted what little influence I had; I paid my\r\nmoney to secure his election; I now wish to give him an honorable\r\nadministration. I believe he will make a good President, and I wish to\r\ngive him a united country to rule. This can only be done by a\r\nsettlement of our troubles. No one will rejoice over that settlement\r\nmore than Mr. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nFellow Republicans, the only way that opens before us now to settle\r\nthem is, by adopting the report of the committee; by permitting the\r\npeople to adopt it. Can you, dare you, refuse to let these\r\npropositions go to the people? Dare you stand between the people and\r\nthese propositions?\r\n\r\nI would appeal to you on another ground. Remember that it is the\r\nminority that is asking for these guarantees. You are just coming into\r\npower. The country has approved of your action in the election of Mr.\r\nLINCOLN. You can afford to be liberal. Liberality is a noble trait in\r\nany character, whether it be that of an individual or political party.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons why the South should be apprehensive now. The\r\norganizations of the old Whig and Democratic parties had nothing\r\nsectional in them. There were no resolutions in their platforms which\r\ncould give the South any cause of alarm. The content between these\r\nparties did not involve any sectional interests whatever. Now, it is\r\nundeniable that the organization of the Republican party was brought\r\nabout by the agitation of the slavery question in its various forms.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange to me that the success of that party in the late\r\nelection should be misconstrued and misunderstood by the South, and\r\nthat the people there should be apprehensive for the result.\r\n\r\nIf the Missouri Compromise had not been repealed we should not have\r\nfound ourselves in our present condition. It was the repeal of that\r\ncompromise that brought the Republican party into power. The masses of\r\nthe people do not sympathize with extremists on either side. The\r\nRepublican party took the middle ground, and thus rendered itself\r\nacceptable to them.\r\n\r\nAfter the repeal of the Missouri Compromise came the Kansas agitation.\r\nIn this the North was right and the South was wrong. Slavery was\r\nattempted to be forced upon an unwilling people. They resisted--the\r\nAmerican people always will resist injustice. The excitement pervaded\r\nthe whole country. Sympathy was excited for Kansas, and properly\r\nenough. This excitement benefited the Republican party--it injured all\r\nothers. It overwhelmed all other considerations. The aspect of the\r\nslavery question was remembered in Kansas; elsewhere it was forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn this way, was the Republican party brought into power. I say now\r\nthat if the Union is dissolved, that party will be responsible;\r\nresponsible, as that party has now the power to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Vermont, who has put his argument in a very\r\ningenious way, insists that before the North is called upon to act on\r\nthese propositions, that the South ought to declare whether she will\r\nbe satisfied with them. I do not think so. I am perfectly aware of the\r\ndifficulties under which the Representatives of the slave States are\r\nlaboring. They cannot answer this question. Let the gentleman\r\nremember, when he presses this point so hard, and with such apparent\r\ncandor, that even he will not undertake to answer for New England.\r\nMore than that, he denies the authority of those who undertake to\r\nanswer for the North. I do not believe the gentleman is very extreme\r\nin his opinions; but let him remember that the South should be treated\r\nfairly, and that she is placed in circumstances of peculiar\r\nembarrassment. It raised the hair upon Republican heads when they were\r\ntold that Virginia had presented her ultimatum. Now complaint is made\r\nthat she has not done so, and that she will not say what will satisfy\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI feel that I have no interest in this question, except the interest\r\nof a citizen. I have no special interest in it. I ask nothing of\r\npolitics, but I do feel for my country. I may be wrong. I do not claim\r\ninfallibility; but I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that we\r\nought not to adopt these proposals. I cannot see any practical injury\r\nto the North in them, and I can see much benefit to the South.\r\n\r\nThe North is vitally interested in the preservation of peace, in the\r\npreservation of her commerce, and other relations with the South.\r\nThese relations cannot be broken up without great injury to the\r\nNorthern people. My heart would rejoice if we could think alike upon\r\nthese propositions, and adopt them with a degree of unanimity that\r\nwould give them weight with the country.\r\n\r\nI would not assail the motives of gentlemen. Doubtless there are men\r\nwho honestly believe that such a proposition ought only to be\r\nconsidered in a General Convention. In my judgment such a Convention\r\nwould be utterly useless. It would lead to endless discussion, which\r\nwould not be conducted with the decorum that characterizes these\r\nproceedings. It would amount to nothing.\r\n\r\nNo, gentlemen, there is a better way than that. Let us have no General\r\nConvention, but let us induce Congress to submit our propositions at\r\nonce to the people. In no other way, in my judgment, can we avoid the\r\ndisunion that threatens us. In no other way can the country be saved\r\nin her present peril.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIS, of North Carolina:--[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The speech of Mr. DAVIS is, I believe, the only one\r\ndelivered in the Conference which I did not hear, and of which I did\r\nnot preserve minutes more or less full. The reason for the omission\r\nwas this: The morning session was protracted until a late hour, and\r\nthe labor of reporting the remarks of the members had been very\r\nsevere. The evening session commenced with some observations of my\r\nown; and after reporting the remarks of Mr. LOGAN, which followed\r\nmine, I found myself in such a condition of physical exhaustion that I\r\nwas obliged to retire to my room. It was during this temporary absence\r\nthat the remarks of Mr. DAVIS were made. I was informed that his\r\nspeech was very animated and in excellent temper--that he took the\r\nposition that North Carolina was loyal to the Union, but that he fully\r\nconcurred with the Southern States in the necessity of demanding\r\nconstitutional guarantees; and that if these were not given, her\r\nrelations were such with South Carolina and the Gulf States that,\r\nhowever much she might regret the necessity, she could not do\r\notherwise than to leave the Union and unite her future with those of\r\nthe seceded States.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to communicate by letter with any of the members\r\nrepresenting the States now in insurrection. As Mr. DAVIS was the only\r\nrepresentative from North Carolina who entered into a general\r\ndiscussion of the reports of the majority and minority of the\r\nCommittee of One from each State, I was the more desirous of securing\r\nsome report of his remarks. But in all the material which has been\r\nfurnished me, by the many members with whom I have corresponded, I\r\nfind that none of them preserved notes of his speech.]\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--Mr. President, I have thus far avoided any participation in\r\nthe general discussion of questions which have claimed the attention\r\nof this Conference. My purpose has been to give a calm and careful\r\nattention to whatever may be offered for our consideration; to hear\r\nwith unbiassed judgment the grievances which are the subject of\r\ncomplaint, and to afford redress, if redress be necessary.\r\n\r\nVirginia, rich in her patriotism of the past, rich in her historic\r\ntreasures, has called upon her sisters to convene and consult with\r\nreference to the condition of the Union, and the matters which are\r\nsupposed to threaten our future peace and welfare. Indiana heard and\r\nheeded that call. To her it was as the voice of a mother to her child.\r\nIt was a voice which none of the States of the great Northwest--carved\r\nout of that vast domain which Virginia granted to the United States as\r\nthe common property of all--could fail to hear with favor. If dangers\r\nthreaten the common welfare, if the future peace of this land is to be\r\ndisturbed, it was well for Virginia, as in other days of danger, to\r\nsound the alarm, and invite a general council. In pursuance of that\r\ncall, Indiana is here, and here to listen. She feels conscious that\r\nshe has by no act of hers infringed upon the rights of any of her\r\nsister States; that she has been faithful to her constitutional\r\nobligations--seeking for nothing but what was right, and ever ready to\r\nremedy any wrong. Occupying this position, her representatives on this\r\nfloor would be derelict in their duty if they attempted to assume any\r\nother, or to pursue any course of action inconsistent therewith.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, in all candor, are the grievances of some of our sister\r\nStates, as presented by their delegated authority to this Conference?\r\nNothing of a tangible nature calling for practical and definite\r\naction. A deliberative body ought not to act upon the fears or\r\nimaginations of those desiring such action. The mere election of\r\nPresident of the United States by the votes of the northern portion of\r\nthis Union, affords no just ground of complaint. That election is\r\nvalid, being in strict conformity with all the requirements of the\r\nConstitution. The peculiar notions or political opinions of that\r\nPresident cannot be the ground of a just complaint, so long as these\r\nopinions in their practical operations do not interfere with or\r\ncontravene the provisions of that Constitution. The opinions and\r\nprinciples of the President elect, however obnoxious they may be to\r\nany portion of the people of this Union, are harmless so long as his\r\npolitical opponents have in their control the legislative and judicial\r\ndepartments of the Government. The question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories, if ever any real cause of grievance to any portion of the\r\nUnion, is in process of final settlement, and will be settled before\r\nthe close of the present Congress in a manner acceptable to a large\r\nmajority of the American people. What, then, is left? \"Personal\r\nLiberty bills\" in some of the States; and these are being repealed as\r\nrapidly as possible; and so far as practical results are concerned,\r\nthey have been a dead letter on the statute books ever since their\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nThe non-enforcement of the fugitive slave law. The history of the\r\ncountry since the year of its enactment clearly shows that no law\r\namong the national statutes has received more prompt and vigorous\r\nexecution, notwithstanding its exceedingly odious features. Here,\r\nthen, is the list of grievances, or I might more properly say supposed\r\ngrievances; and for a failure to redress them, this Government is\r\nthreatened with civil war. To justify this unnatural and diabolical\r\nresort to arms, the chimera of \"State sovereignty\" is invoked. And\r\nwhat is State sovereignty? The gentleman from North Carolina has\r\nendeavored to enforce this doctrine, and deduce from certain premises,\r\nthe right of a State, when she feels herself aggrieved, to secede from\r\nher sister States, and assume an independent position and a separate\r\nnationality. The fallacy of the gentleman's position, in fact the\r\nfallacy of the doctrine of \"State rights,\" and the deductions made\r\ntherefrom by the school of politicians and statesmen to which the\r\ngentleman belongs, arises from confounding the terms State rights and\r\nState sovereignty, and using these as though they were convertible\r\nterms. The several States of this Union possess certain rights clearly\r\ndefined, and known and understood by the reader of American political\r\nhistory. Subject to the restrictions of the national Constitution,\r\nthey have the right to establish, regulate, and control their internal\r\npolice and entire polity so far as it affects the persons and property\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction; to regulate trade, commerce, contracts,\r\nmarriage, the acquisition, possession, control, and disposal of real\r\nand personal property; also the assessing and collecting of taxes, and\r\ndisbursement of the public revenue.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the main rights belonging to the States as such, but\r\nthese do not in any just sense constitute sovereignty. The several\r\nStates of the Union are not now and never have been sovereign States.\r\nThey never possessed the right to declare war, to make peace, to coin\r\nmoney, to enter into treaty with nations, and none of them ever\r\nendeavored or attempted to exercise any such rights as these. These\r\nare attributes of sovereignty, as laid down by writers upon the laws\r\nof nations, and recognized as such by the civilized world. Examine the\r\nhistory of your several States, and tell me whether in any one of them\r\nany act or fact can be found which would entitle either of them at any\r\ntime, past or present, to be recognized as sovereign independent\r\nnations?\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--Will the gentleman from Indiana permit me to inform him\r\nthat during the Revolutionary War, the State of North Carolina had\r\nlaid the foundation of a navy, and at the close of hostilities she\r\ntransferred her vessels to the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for the\r\ninterruption, and for the allusion to the local history of his State,\r\nof which I was not before aware.\r\n\r\nThere, then, we have a single instance of one of the States taking one\r\nstep toward sovereignty, by the establishing of a navy. I believe\r\nthis is the only instance now remembered, and this instance affords\r\nthe strongest argument in favor of the position I assume and am\r\nendeavoring to enforce. North Carolina, it seems, had taken one step\r\ntoward sovereignty; and yet upon the adoption of our national\r\nConstitution, upon the creation of the only sovereign Government in\r\nthis Union, the _Government of the Union_, she transfers to that\r\nsovereign her infant navy; she relinquishes her only attribute of\r\nsovereignty--if such it be--to the United States, and merges herself\r\nwith her sister States into that Union of States which has hitherto\r\nbeen our boast and pride, as well as the admiration of the world.\r\n\r\nThe several propositions now pending before us do not meet my\r\napprobation, and cannot receive my support. They are in the shape of\r\namendments to the Constitution, and are all in the interest of\r\nslavery, seeking to strengthen that institution, and to give it an\r\nimportance far beyond what the fathers were willing to concede. While\r\nthe North is willing to recognize and enforce the requirements of the\r\nConstitution touching the various aspects of the slavery question, so\r\nnominated in the bond, they feel unwilling to grant new guarantees to\r\na system which the civilized world is beginning to hold in\r\ndetestation, and which is inimical to free institutions, and the only\r\nsubject of contention that will ever seriously disturb the peace and\r\nprosperity of the Union. I am opposed to the proposition before us:\r\nFirst, because the grievances complained of are not of that serious\r\ncharacter requiring any amendment of our fundamental laws. Secondly,\r\nbecause I am in favor of the Constitution as it is, firmly believing\r\nthat no good reason exists for its change, and that an honest\r\nadherence to its wise provisions is our surest guarantee for real or\r\nsupposed grievances, and that the present of all times is the most\r\nunpropitious moment to attempt any change or modification. Party\r\npolitics in all their embittered madness rule the hour, but calm times\r\nand cool heads will be required whenever the American people desire to\r\nenter upon so hazardous an experiment. Let the Constitution remain; it\r\nhas hitherto been, and will continue to be, the palladium of our\r\nrights, the sheet anchor of our safety. Thirdly, under no state of\r\ncircumstances that can possibly arise among us as a people, will I\r\never consent, by word, thought, or deed, to do any thing to strengthen\r\nthe institution of slavery. I regard it as an evil which all good men\r\nshould desire to see totally eradicated; and I hope for the day to\r\ndawn speedily when, throughout the length and breadth of the land,\r\nfreedom shall be enjoyed by every human being, without reference to\r\ncaste, color, or nationality. While I am willing to tolerate its\r\nexistence where it now is, I am unwilling to extend its boundaries a\r\nsingle inch, and will not give it any guarantee, protection, or\r\nencouragement, save what it can exact by the strict letter of the\r\nfundamental law. Beyond that I will never go; beyond that Indiana will\r\nnever go; and to this, gentlemen from the other side had as well\r\nbecome reconciled. It is the _ne plus ultra_ of the American people,\r\nand to that they will adhere through all coming time. If, in\r\nconsequence of this position, the foundations of society are to be\r\nbroken up, civil war inaugurated, and the destruction of the\r\nGovernment attempted, you must remember we are standing upon the\r\nConstitution, in favor of sustaining the laws of the land, denying the\r\nexistence of any real grievance; and standing thus with that\r\nconsciousness of strength which integrity imparts, you must strike the\r\nfirst blow, cross the Rubicon, commit the foul and damning crime of\r\ntreason, and bring upon your people ruin, devastation, and\r\ndestruction, and call down upon your guilty heads the curses of your\r\nchildren and the disapprobation of the civilized world!\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--For what purpose was this Conference called? Why have we\r\ncome here? I suppose we are here to do something, to accomplish\r\nsomething. If we are only here to make speeches, and not to arrive at\r\nconclusions, our mission is useless. The greater portion of the debate\r\nhitherto has been made up of set speeches, all like the circumlocution\r\noffice in one of Dickens' novels, showing \"how not to do it.\" I am not\r\nin favor of pursuing this course any longer. Let us talk the subject\r\nover like business men, in a sensible way, and then come to a vote. I\r\nthink we may do something which will prove effectual, and I hope we\r\nshall. My political opinions are well known. For more than forty years\r\nI have belonged to one political party. I did not come here to speak.\r\nI did not intend to speak at all, and shall now only submit a few\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nI hail from the old Democratic party. The most of you are members of\r\nthe opposition. I do not know how or why I was selected as one of the\r\ndelegates from New York. I do not even know how the vote of that\r\ndelegation will stand on these proposals of amendment. I suppose the\r\ndominant party has taken care to send a majority of its members. If I\r\nwas a mere politician, I do not know but I should be in favor of\r\nbreaking up the Conference, and of doing nothing; but being only a\r\nDemocrat, I desire to transmit to posterity the blessings of a good\r\nConstitution and a good Government.\r\n\r\nThe country has become disquieted. Its peace has been disturbed by the\r\nacts of politicians. Many have become disgusted with the present\r\ncondition of affairs, and are unwilling to act or vote. A large\r\nportion of our people have become alarmed. They think their rights\r\nhave been invaded. Some of the States have gone. GOD knows whether\r\nthey will ever come back again. If we act wisely, perhaps they may.\r\nBut there is occasion enough for alarm. I have felt alarmed for a long\r\ntime. One way suggested to get these States back is by conquest. But\r\nwhat are we to do with a conquered State? Shall we establish a\r\nmilitary despotism over it?\r\n\r\nWe all have the right to express our opinions, and I will express\r\nmine. There are eight other slave States whose condition is to be\r\nconsidered. If we do not act here, will they not leave us and join\r\ntheir sisters? I hope they will not. I would not raise my voice in\r\nthis Conference, if it were not for the purpose of inducing them to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nVirginia, that noble old Commonwealth, has invited us together. She\r\nproposes the CRITTENDEN resolutions, and asks us to consider them. Now\r\nshe is charged with standing in the way of the Government. This is not\r\ntrue. Blessed are the peacemakers, and the position of Virginia in\r\nthis matter is that of a peace-maker. I thank her for bringing us\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the speeches here have been made by those of a political\r\nparty to which I never belonged. I do not understand either their\r\npurposes or wishes. Perhaps I may be behind the times. I have not been\r\nactually engaged in politics for more than twenty-five years. During a\r\nlarge part of that time I have been engaged, in my humble way, in the\r\nadministration of justice in the State I here in part represent. I do\r\nnot know but I may be falling into the common fault of making a\r\nspeech. If I do, you must check me. Again I say, I thank Virginia for\r\nher invitation. Why should we not confer together? Six or seven\r\nStates--no matter which--are gone. If nothing is done, eight or nine\r\nothers will follow, and other divisions will come as a matter of\r\nnecessity. Rhode Island--patriotic Rhode Island--will not go with New\r\nEngland in this Conference. She will not separate from her southern\r\nsisters. Connecticut, I think, will not stay, and New York, I believe,\r\nwill stand with the South.\r\n\r\nHow is it, or why is it, that we should do nothing? Why should we\r\nbreak up and go home? Have not all the States asked us to come here\r\nand do this work? Why did their legislatures take the trouble to send\r\nus here? All this circumlocution might have better been done at home.\r\n\r\nWill a Convention answer the purpose, when another Confederacy has\r\nbeen formed in our very midst? It would be two years at least before\r\nany thing could be accomplished by a Convention, and then it would be\r\ntoo late. We all know how delegates to such a Convention are elected.\r\nWe all know how much time would be consumed before the Convention\r\ncould meet. I say we cannot bear the delay. I ask the gentleman (Mr.\r\nBALDWIN) of Connecticut whether he thinks it would be safe to delay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I think it is always safe to follow the Constitution. I\r\nthink we can follow the example of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I would suggest to the gentleman from Connecticut that the\r\nrepresentatives of Kentucky are here to speak for her.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--Kentucky has sent delegates to this Convention since she\r\npassed the resolutions to which the gentleman refers. I think we\r\ncannot stand upon the ground taken in these resolutions. I do not\r\nbelieve Kentucky herself would be satisfied with them now.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to see gentlemen so cool and apathetic under such\r\ncircumstances. Is no one alarmed for the safety of the old flag about\r\nwhich so much is said? Can the Border States stay with us when their\r\nbrethren are gone? If the action of the North in relation to slavery\r\nis such as to drive out South Carolina, can Delaware and the other\r\nBorder States remain? For one, I do not wish to put this Constitution\r\ninto the hands of a General Convention. Who can tell what such a\r\nconvention would do with the Constitution; what it would do with the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, under which so many of the vexatious\r\nquestions have been settled? It would be worse than attempting to\r\nsettle our differences in a town meeting. I would hesitate long before\r\nI would submit such questions to a convention. Before they could be\r\nsettled in that way, the Union would be gone forever. The process\r\nwould be too slow. I have nothing to gain in this matter. My only wish\r\nis to spend my few remaining days in the United States, and to\r\ntransmit the blessings of our Government to my children.\r\n\r\nSome of the Republican members here subordinate their platform to\r\ntheir country. I commend them for it; these are noble sentiments. Men\r\nshould abandon platforms when they tend to destroy the country. I\r\nconcur in the sentiments of the gentleman from Illinois, uttered this\r\nmorning. They also are noble sentiments.\r\n\r\nI venerate our Constitution. When made, it was equal to any ever\r\nframed. Nothing short of Almighty Wisdom could have framed a better.\r\nBut was it given to human wisdom, to WASHINGTON and MADISON, to\r\nforesee all the events of the future? The Constitution has held us\r\ntogether for three-fourths of a century; that is a wonder in itself;\r\nbut its makers did not foresee this day--a day when Freedom itself was\r\nin danger of perishing.\r\n\r\nWhy this hesitation about amending the Constitution? New York accepted\r\nit reluctantly, and only ratified it upon the assurance that it should\r\nbe amended as she proposed. It is not so holy a thing now, that it may\r\nnot be amended. WASHINGTON, you must remember, signed the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law of 1793, as well as the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWe are told by gentlemen from New York and Connecticut (Mr. NOYES and\r\nMr. BALDWIN), that the action proposed here is unconstitutional. It\r\ndoes not become these gentlemen to raise this objection. There was\r\nnever an amendment of the State Constitutions, in either of the States\r\nthey represent, adopted, that was not brought before the people in\r\nsubstantially the same way.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said here about modern civilization and the spirit of\r\nthe age. It is said that these are hostile to slavery. Suppose they\r\nare? What have we to do with them? The example of England, also, has\r\nbeen referred to, as well as that of France. True, they have abolished\r\nslavery by name, but they have imported apprentices from Africa, and\r\nCoolies from Asia, and have placed them under the worst form of\r\nslavery ever known. England tolerates slavery in her mining districts\r\nto-day in a worse form than that existing in the Southern States. She\r\nhas millions in India worse off than slaves. She has been the greatest\r\nland robber on the earth. She has contributed to the support of the\r\nJuggernaut, and has forced the Chinese at the point of the bayonet to\r\neat opium. Do you forget that she ruined the capitol in this city, and\r\nblew it up, in 1814? I do not deny her virtues, but I do not care to\r\nfollow her example.\r\n\r\nOur fathers said slavery was strictly a State institution, and they\r\nwould not meddle with it by the Constitution. Their doctrine is true\r\nnow. The Union cannot be preserved if we interfere with the\r\ninstitutions of the States.\r\n\r\nI will not stop to refer to the Missouri Compromise, or the\r\ncompromises of 1850 and 1854. I will only say that the North\r\nunderstood these to settle the slavery question, and professed to\r\nagree not to meddle with slavery hereafter in the States. But the cry\r\nof freedom was raised, and its new apostles, during the last campaign,\r\nwent through the land preaching destruction to slavery. What did they\r\nmean but that slavery was to be assailed at every possible point? This\r\ndoctrine was involved in their platforms, and advocated in their\r\nspeeches. They collected all the bad things ever said about slavery,\r\nwhether true or untrue, and published them. The purpose to assail the\r\ninstitution was everywhere owned.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a word about the Territories. What great harm would be\r\ndone if all the Territories were thrown open to slavery? By the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, they are open\r\nalready. But in the greater part of them slavery cannot exist at all.\r\nNew Mexico has a slave code. So have the Cherokee and other Indian\r\ntribes; and yet slavery does not and cannot flourish among them. It\r\ncannot make head against the obstacles which oppose it, and yet you\r\nwill attack it even there. If you do so, civil war is inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut what mischief is done if slavery does go into the Territories? It\r\nwill not add another to the degraded race of Africans. It is a\r\nblessing to the slave if he may be permitted to go with his master\r\ninto these new Territories. In the old slave States he is compelled to\r\nwork in gangs under the whip of a driver, with no one to look after\r\nhis health or comfort. Take him into one of these new Territories, and\r\nthere are one hundred white men and women to protect each individual\r\nof his race, and to see that he suffers no wrong. It is a blessing to\r\ntake him out of the plantation gangs, and to place him in a new\r\ncountry. Then why not let him go there and live in peace? Your zeal to\r\nexclude slavery from the Territories only injures the African race. If\r\nthere is a good substantial reason for this exclusion I shall be glad\r\nto hear it. Up to this time I have heard no good reason stated.\r\nAlthough I have declared myself a Democrat, in this Conference I am no\r\nparty man. Show me any good reason for not adopting these proposals of\r\namendment and I will oppose them. But until that reason is shown they\r\nwill receive my support. So far as I can judge, no argument has been\r\nproposed here against these propositions which is not of a partisan\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe rights which the slave States now ask to have us recognize, are\r\nguaranteed to them by the Constitution as it now stands. We are giving\r\nthem nothing new. Every lawyer is familiar with the rule of\r\nconstitutional construction, that all the rights not expressly granted\r\nto the General Government are reserved to the States. Let us carry\r\nthis principle into effect now. It is all that we are asked to do. Let\r\nus do something. Let us amend these propositions; make them as\r\nunobjectionable as we can, and send them to Congress. Let us urge\r\nCongress and the country to adopt them. In their adoption there is\r\nsafety; there is great danger in their rejection.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK obtained the floor, and at twelve o'clock the Conference\r\nadjourned to ten o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 22d, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by President TYLER, at 10 o'clock\r\nA.M., and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. SUNDERLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday was read, corrected, and approved.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--It will be necessary that some plan be adopted to\r\ndefray the expenses of the Conference, and of printing the Journal. I\r\nmove the appointment, by the President, of a committee of three to\r\ntake those subjects into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted, and the President appointed Mr. JOHNSON, of\r\nMaryland, Mr. POLLOCK, and Mr. GRANGER as such committee.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I have an amendment in three sections which I shall\r\noffer to the report of the committee. I ask that it may be read, laid\r\non the table, and printed.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to, and the amendment read as follows:\r\n\r\n     Strike out Section 3, and insert the three following:\r\n\r\n     SEC. 3. Congress shall have no power to regulate, abolish,\r\n     or control within any State the relations established or\r\n     recognized by the laws thereof, touching persons held to\r\n     service or labor therein.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 4. Congress shall have no power to discharge any person\r\n     held to service or labor in the District of Columbia, under\r\n     the laws thereof, from such service or labor, or to impair\r\n     any rights pertaining to that relation under the laws now in\r\n     force within the said District, while such relation shall\r\n     exist in the State of Maryland, without the consent of said\r\n     State, and of those to whom the service or labor is due, or\r\n     making to them just compensation therefor; nor the power to\r\n     interfere with or prohibit members of Congress, and officers\r\n     of the Federal Government whose duties require them to be in\r\n     said District, from bringing with them, retaining, and\r\n     taking away persons so held to service or labor; nor the\r\n     power to impair or abolish the relations of persons owing\r\n     service or labor in places under the exclusive jurisdiction\r\n     of the United States, within those States and Territories\r\n     where such relations are established or recognized by law.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 5. Congress shall have no power to prohibit the removal\r\n     or transportation of persons held to labor or service in any\r\n     State or Territory of the United States, to any State or\r\n     Territory thereof, where the same obligation or liability to\r\n     labor or service is established or recognized by law; and\r\n     the right during such transportation, by sea or river, of\r\n     touching at ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in\r\n     case of distress, shall exist; nor shall Congress have power\r\n     to authorize any higher rate of taxation on persons held to\r\n     service or labor than on land.\r\n\r\n     Strike out Section 7, and insert:\r\n\r\n     SEC. 9. Congress shall provide by law, that in all cases\r\n     where the marshal, or other officer whose duty it shall be\r\n     to arrest any fugitive from service or labor, shall be\r\n     prevented from so doing by violence of a mob or riotous\r\n     assemblage, or where, after arrest, such fugitive shall be\r\n     rescued by like violence, and the party to whom such service\r\n     or labor is due shall thereby be deprived of the same, the\r\n     United States shall pay to such party the full value of such\r\n     service or labor.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I offer the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the time fixed upon to commence voting upon\r\n     the questions before this Convention, be postponed until\r\n     Monday, February 25th, at 12 o'clock M.\r\n\r\nI am as desirous as any member of the Conference can be for action.\r\nIllinois is a Border State, and she feels, in common with the Border\r\nStates, a deep interest in the questions we are discussing here. But I\r\nthink a false issue has arisen, and that it ought to be corrected.\r\nThis issue has been forced upon us, and it will go to the country\r\nunless corrected. Very little time has yet been occupied by Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Ohio, but we wish and we ought to be heard.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri, moved to lay the resolution upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken by States, with the following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio and\r\n     Vermont--10.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I see the resolution does not meet with favor. I will\r\nwithdraw it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I offer the resolution again. I wish to appeal to this\r\nConference in the name of peace, not to press this vote to-day. We\r\nhave been discussing general questions. There has been little or no\r\ndiscussion touching the merits of the proposed amendments to the\r\nConstitution. Do gentlemen suppose that if it is pressed through in\r\nthis way, it will meet with favor when it comes before the country?\r\nLet me assure you, gentlemen, that you will not give the country peace\r\nby such a course.\r\n\r\nThere is a prospect that all sections of the Union may yet be induced\r\nto agree to a General Convention. The floor is so parcelled out that\r\nthe Western States cannot be heard. Why do you force the vote in this\r\nmanner? Two-thirds of Congress must concur, or these propositions\r\ncannot go to the people. The same two-thirds can suspend the rule at\r\nany time. There is no necessity for passing these propositions to-day.\r\nI regret that the proposition of Mr. WICKLIFFE, limiting the speeches\r\nto thirty minutes, has not prevailed. It was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--No! It was laid on the table by enemies.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--I have the floor. I will occupy it only thirty minutes,\r\nwith the understanding that those who follow will do the same. We\r\nstill have time for six speeches.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I have but little more to say. When we have a rule, we\r\nknow what it is. A general understanding will amount to nothing. I\r\nhave insisted that it was inexpedient to press these matters to a\r\ndecision before the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN; but when overruled I\r\nhave cheerfully submitted. I now appeal to gentlemen to yield, and let\r\nus take the final vote on Monday.\r\n\r\nOne word now as to a General Convention. I have faith in that, and\r\nbelieve we can agree to call one. The idea was started by Kentucky,\r\nand promptly followed by Illinois. I have seen a copy of the\r\n\"Louisville Journal,\" which strongly advocates it. It is practicable,\r\nand the country will assent to it.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--The delegates from Delaware desire that the vote should\r\nbe taken to-day. We have not discussed these propositions, and do not\r\nwish to discuss them. We want action.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I concur in the views of the gentleman from Delaware.\r\nDiscussion, so far, has tended very little toward harmony or\r\nunanimity. I am in favor of closing the general debate to-day. But I\r\ndo protest against that part of the resolution we have adopted, which\r\nlimits the discussion of an amendment to five minutes, and confines\r\nthe reply to the committee. We ought not thus to be restricted and\r\nchoked down. I will not move to amend the resolution now under\r\ndiscussion. It will answer my purpose to give notice that I shall move\r\nto amend the five-minute rule.\r\n\r\nMr. COOK:--We ought to have an opportunity to present the views of\r\nIllinois. As yet we have had none. We cannot justify ourselves to our\r\npeople unless we do.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I move to lay the whole subject on the table. I want\r\nto test the question. Debate and discussion change the mind of no one.\r\nWe have now been here eighteen days, and the country is expecting a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon Mr. WICKLIFFE'S motion was called by States, and\r\nresulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\n     and Vermont--11.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I now offer my proposition as a substitute for Mr.\r\nCHASE'S resolution, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the resolution heretofore passed, limiting\r\n     debate on amendments that shall be offered to the report of\r\n     the Grand Committee, be so amended as to allow the delegates\r\n     who may desire, to speak not exceeding ten minutes on each\r\n     amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I do not wish to seem unreasonable. As my resolution meets\r\nwith objection, I will withdraw it in favor of the one adopted by my\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Have gentlemen calculated how many hours this will\r\ntake? It will amount to a total defeat of all action. We could not get\r\nthrough by the middle of next month.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I favor the resolution. All should have a fair chance.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--I move to amend, giving each delegate ten minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I object to that very strenuously. Many delegations are\r\ndivided. I hope the resolution will pass as it is.\r\n\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN:--I approve of the rule as it now stands. Practically,\r\nit gives ten minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I move to lay the resolution on the table. We adopted\r\nthe rule unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--The motion is not in order. We have once voted not to\r\ntable the resolutions.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--I will withdraw my motion, at the instance of the\r\ngentlemen around me.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--The question is upon the adoption of the resolution\r\noffered by Mr. BACKUS. I have accepted it in place of the one offered\r\nby myself.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It is subject, at any time, to a motion to lay on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--That is my motion.\r\n\r\nThe motion to lay the resolution of Mr. BACKUS on the table was lost\r\nby the following vote--the vote by States being requested by Mr.\r\nCHASE:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, and\r\n     Vermont--10.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I presume we all desire to know the result of our\r\nlabors. I regret to see so much feeling manifested. Perhaps some of us\r\nhad better take the benefit of the prayers of the church on Sunday.\r\nSome of us wish to get our propositions to Congress at an early hour.\r\nThose who oppose us--those determined to defeat action, can speak on\r\nuntil the fourth of March. I hope such is not their intention.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--If the rule is abused, the Convention will stop the abuse.\r\n\r\nAt this point there were loud calls of \"question,\" and the President\r\nput the question to vote, _viva voce_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the Noes clearly have it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--A vote by States was called for by several members.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--Is this resolution intended to give the right of\r\nreply? If so, we shall have a half-hour speech upon every amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--If any member wishes to divide his time, he can do so;\r\nbut he can only occupy ten minutes in all. We are called to\r\ndeliberate, as well as to act. We are asked if we wish to stave off\r\nfinal action? I answer, No. I want speedy action. But at the same time\r\nlet us have deliberation. I wish to give a vote that my constituents\r\nwill approve.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The vote will be taken by States.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\n     and Vermont--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia--9.\r\n\r\nMr. HALL offered the following, which was read, laid on the table, and\r\nordered to be printed:\r\n\r\n     Amendment to Section 3 of the Committee's Report, to come in\r\n     after the words \"retaining and taking away persons so bound\r\n     to labor:\"--\"but the bringing into said District of persons\r\n     held to service for the purpose of being sold, or placed in\r\n     depot to be afterwards transferred to any other place to be\r\n     sold as merchandise, is forever prohibited, and Congress may\r\n     pass all necessary laws to make this prohibition effectual;\r\n     nor shall Congress have,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will proceed to the order of the day,\r\nand Mr. POLLOCK has the floor:\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--Brevity is always a virtue. I intend to practice that\r\nvirtue now. I would not make a single observation, if I did not feel\r\nthat by keeping silence I should neglect my duty. As it is, I do not\r\nintend to occupy the time of the Conference more than twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee upon the subject invited Pennsylvania to furnish a\r\nblock for the Washington Monument in this city, they asked also for a\r\nmotto, to be inscribed upon it, which should express some idea\r\ncharacteristic of Pennsylvania. What was the motto selected in behalf\r\nof that great State? Did we go to Germantown and invoke the memories\r\nof the mighty dead? Did we ask the motto of Valley Forge? No,\r\nbrothers, no! Pennsylvania stood by the side of the grave of Penn, the\r\nman of peace, and in his example she found her motto, and it stands\r\ninscribed upon her contribution to that monument to the Father of his\r\nCountry to-day. There may it stand forever. \"_Pennsylvania was founded\r\nby deeds of Peace._\" How noble the sentiment! How characteristic of\r\nthat Commonwealth!\r\n\r\nAnimated by the same sentiment, filled with the same spirit, herself\r\nasking nothing, requiring nothing, Pennsylvania comes into this\r\nConference and says to every delegate here, \"_Peace, Brothers,\r\nPeace._\" She is not for war. She believes that the power of kindness\r\nis far greater than that of the sword; that in the affection of\r\nbrother toward brother there is greater strength than in all the iron\r\ncontained in all her thousand hills and mountains. She comes here at\r\nthe instance of a sister. She heard the voice of that sister asking\r\nfor consultation, and she obeyed it. She is here, and in the right\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nA word now as to the motive of Virginia in calling the States\r\ntogether. Some object that Virginia comes bearing the olive branch on\r\nthe point of the bayonet. Not so, sir. She is placed in a peculiar\r\nposition, and I appreciate it. She does not make use of threats. These\r\nexist only in the imagination of gentlemen. I am willing to meet her\r\nhere upon the very ground she takes, and unite with her in saying,\r\n\"Our Union as it is, now and forever.\" We are here taking counsel, not\r\nwith traitors, not with secessionists, but with lovers of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe people love the Union; they will not give it up. They are true. My\r\nheart almost leapt from my bosom when that telegraph message was read\r\nfrom Missouri a few days ago. Tennessee has taken up the cry, \"Union\r\nfor ever,\" The nation is troubled. All nations are, at times. But our\r\ntroubles are not insurmountable. We are all here together to settle\r\nthem. Why not settle them, and give peace to the Union, and joy to the\r\nhearts of the people?\r\n\r\nWe can settle our difficulties. The right feeling animates gentlemen\r\nfrom both sections. Where was the heart in this Conference that did\r\nnot start with emotion, when, some days ago, that glorious old patriot\r\nfrom North Carolina (Mr. RUFFIN) told us of his devotion to the Union?\r\nWho did not honor and respect him? Old men and young men wept as they\r\nlistened. Friends! Countrymen! I come here from a Border State. These\r\nStates have a vital interest in the result, therefore we speak\r\nearnestly. Let us say to the angry passions of the country, \"Peace, be\r\nstill!\"\r\n\r\nThe Border States are united; they have common interests. Beside the\r\nhearthstones of each, sit wives, and children, and families, connected\r\nwith each other by ties of blood, of interest, of social intercourse.\r\nWe are one. Is Maryland or Delaware ready to say that either will\r\npart company from Pennsylvania? No! We are brethren--come weal, come\r\nwo, we will stand by each other, and we will stand by the Union.\r\n\r\nGentlemen say there will not be war, if we do not agree. I wish I\r\ncould think so, but I cannot. But if war should come, let me ask the\r\ngentlemen from New York who think principles are standing in their\r\nway, will you take the risk? Will you see the soil of Pennsylvania\r\ndrenched with blood? Can you risk all this hereafter, when you can\r\navoid it by accepting a proposition that involves no sacrifice of\r\nprinciples? Never in my whole life have I felt the weight of official\r\nresponsibility as I feel it now. God grant that war may be averted\r\nfrom the country!\r\n\r\nLet the lightning this day flash to the extreme limits of the Union,\r\nthe glad tidings that we have settled these questions. The message\r\nwould be received with gratitude and thanksgiving. Our friends in the\r\nBorder States say, \"We love the Union, we wish to stay in it; we do\r\nnot wish to be driven out.\" Can you not, will you not, do something\r\nfor them? Let us trust this matter to the people. I am not afraid to\r\ntrust the people of Pennsylvania. New York and Massachusetts, trust\r\nyours!\r\n\r\nWe talk calmly of war, but we forget its calamities. Let us remember\r\nthat we should not sacrifice one life for this paltry abstraction. Let\r\nus remember how great are the miseries of war. Let us think of the\r\nrush of angry armies, of the widows and orphans, of the sorrow and\r\ndesolation that war always leaves in its path.\r\n\r\nChristian men! remember that our great Saviour was a Prince of\r\nPeace--that he came to conquer with peace, not with the sword. \"The\r\nLord God omnipotent reigneth.\"\r\n\r\nDisunion is a crime against every thing. Above all, it is a crime\r\nagainst GOD. Christians, pause and reflect. Let me entreat you to help\r\nus save this country from disunion.\r\n\r\nI speak earnestly. We Pennsylvanians are upon the border. Our soil\r\nmust be the battle ground. Upon us will the heavy trouble fall. Once\r\nmore I say, let us trust the people. They are always right. They will\r\ndo something; and honest men, sincere men, tell us that unless\r\nsomething is done, the border slave States cannot be retained in the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nI am not here as a party man, but as an American citizen, and a\r\ncitizen of Pennsylvania. I am here to perform my duty to the whole\r\ncountry, if I can find out what that duty is.\r\n\r\nOur friends say there is great apprehension at the South that the\r\nRepublican party meditates unconditional interference with Southern\r\nrights. I do not believe for a moment that there is any ground for\r\nsuch an apprehension. But, nevertheless, it exists. Acting upon it,\r\nseveral States have withdrawn from the Union. We must deal with it in\r\nthe best way we can. If we can satisfy our southern brethren, in the\r\nname of peace let us do it. I labored for the election of Mr. LINCOLN,\r\nbut I never understood that hostility to slavery was the leading idea\r\nin the platform of his party. Pennsylvania had other interests--other\r\nreasons very powerful, for supporting him. There was the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise--ruinous discriminations in the Tariff--the\r\ncorruption of the Government--the villanous conduct of its high\r\nofficers; these and other considerations gave Mr. LINCOLN more\r\nstrength in Pennsylvania than the slavery question.\r\n\r\nThere are sentiments and opinions at the North that must be respected.\r\nThere are sentiments and opinions at the South that must be respected;\r\nbut there are no differences that cannot be honorably adjusted. The\r\nonly practicable way that I can discover is to adopt the plan reported\r\nby the committee, and secure its submission to the people.\r\n\r\nHow can we do greater honor to this glorious day, which gave the\r\nimmortal WASHINGTON to his country and to the world, than by marking\r\nit on the calendar as the day that secured the safety and perpetuity\r\nof the American Union?\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--The Committee on Credentials have examined the case of\r\nMr. J.C. STONE, who is commissioned as a delegate from Kansas, and are\r\nof opinion that he is duly accredited.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I understand that he was appointed by Mr. BEEBE, the\r\nSecretary of the Territorial Government.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--There is a provision in the Kansas Act authorizing the\r\nSecretary to perform all the duties of the Governor in his absence.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I represent an old and honored Commonwealth. I\r\nspeak, remembering the maxing that \"a soft answer turneth away\r\nwrath.\" But I should disregard my duty if I did not reply to what was\r\nsaid a few days ago, in arraignment--in unfair and improper\r\narraignment, of Virginia.\r\n\r\nVirginia occupies no menacing position, no attitude of hostility\r\ntoward the Union or her sister States. Virginia knows that \"eternal\r\nvigilance is the price of liberty.\" She knows, too, that there is good\r\npolicy in the maxim, \"in peace prepare for war.\" Her action is only\r\nsuch as is dictated by a prudent foresight. How unkind, then, are such\r\ntaunts against Virginia, the mother of us all. She comes here in a\r\npaternal spirit; she desires to preserve the Union; she disdains to\r\nemploy a menace; she knows that she never can secure the cooperation\r\nof brave men by employing menaces. No! She wishes to use all her\r\nefforts to perpetuate the reign of peace.\r\n\r\nAnother says we are seeking to secure an amendment of the Constitution\r\nby the employment of unconstitutional means, and that this meeting is\r\na revolutionary mob--that these eminent men of the country assembled\r\nhere, constitute a mob. No, sir! No!\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--If the gentleman from Virginia refers to me, he quite\r\nmisunderstood me. I said only that the action proposed here was not\r\ncontemplated by the Constitution, and was revolutionary in its\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I cannot for my life so consider it. This is\r\nmerely an advisory body. We are here to devise an adjustment, and to\r\nlay it before Congress. We are exercising the right of petition, and\r\nthat is a sacred right. Is this revolutionary? No, sir! You would\r\ninsist that Congress should _receive_ a petition, although that body\r\nhad no right to act upon it. If so, how much more should our petition\r\nbe received, when we seek to preserve the Union, and when the\r\nConstitution expressly authorizes Congress to act in such a case.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Vermont said last evening, that a pledge from the\r\nSouth to abide by the result would be a condition precedent to the\r\nsubmission of the proposition at all, and yet he says he cannot pledge\r\nVermont. Why, then, does he ask us to pledge Virginia?\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I am not willing to be misunderstood. I thought my\r\nlanguage was plain. What I said was, that no one could pledge the\r\nfree States for or against these propositions; but I did say we could\r\npledge them _to abide by the Union, whatever_ the result might be.\r\n_That_ is the pledge we ask from the South.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--Well, that is a pledge we have no authority to\r\ngive. We cannot accept these propositions as a boon from any section.\r\nWe must have them as a right, or not at all.\r\n\r\nBut let me address myself at once to the momentous question. It seems\r\nthat we can agree upon every thing but this question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories. So far as that subject is concerned, Virginia has\r\ndeclared that she will accept the Crittenden resolutions. She and her\r\nsouthern sisters will stand upon and abide by them. If gentlemen will\r\ncome up to this basis of adjustment with manly firmness, the electric\r\nwires will flash a thrill of joy to the hearts of the people this very\r\nhour. Why not come up to it like men?\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has already established the rights of the South, so\r\nfar as this question is concerned, upon a basis which is satisfactory.\r\nUnder the Dred Scott decision, the people of the South have the right\r\nto go into any portion of the Territory with their slaves. You,\r\ngentlemen of the North, will not abide by that decision. You have\r\ndeclared in your platform that it is a miserable dogma. How can we be\r\nsatisfied with such a guarantee for our rights as that?\r\n\r\nBut it is said that this part of the Dred Scott decision is only an\r\n_obiter dictum_; that the question was not presented by the record.\r\nThis is not so. As was said by Governor WICKLIFFE, the other day,\r\nthere were two questions in that case. The judgment of the court was\r\nupon them both, and both were presented by the record.\r\n\r\nWe know that the dominant party has elected a President on a purely\r\nsectional issue, and in deadly hostility to our institutions. We\r\nbelieve, from all the indications of the times, that our institutions\r\nare utterly insecure. Therefore we ask these guarantees. Give them to\r\nus, and from that time you will restore peace and quiet to the\r\ncountry. You at once attach the Border States firmly to you forever. I\r\nhope you will do so; but I tell you that the Border States cannot be\r\nretained unless you will consent to give such guarantees as will\r\nbring back the seceded States, and unite us all in a glorious\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nSentiments have been uttered here that grate harshly on the minds of\r\nSouthern gentlemen. It is said that this is a war of ideas. If so,\r\nthen there is certainly that irrepressible conflict about which we\r\nhave heard so much. But it is not true that slaves exclude free labor.\r\nCome to the harvest homes of Western Virginia. There you will see the\r\nunion of white and black labor--see the two races working harmoniously\r\ntogether. The mechanics are white, the field hands are black. Those\r\nonly make such assertions who know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nYou insist at the North that slavery is a sin. If it is as you claim\r\nit to be, a sin, the sum of all villanies, then we may as well\r\nseparate. We cannot live together longer.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot have the aid of other sections, the Border States must\r\ntake the subject into their own hands, and settle it for themselves.\r\nThese States, with one exception, have shown a most excellent spirit.\r\nLet them all come up to the work to-day; on this natal day of\r\nWASHINGTON, of whom it was said that nature had denied him children,\r\nin order that he might be indeed the Father of his Country. New Jersey\r\nhas most nobly responded, through her distinguished sons, but\r\nespecially through the voice of that eloquent man, who swept with a\r\nmaster hand the chords of the human heart, in his remarks here, and\r\ntones of heavenly music responded to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe whole nation stands on tiptoe awaiting the final result of the\r\naction of this Conference. All sections are ready to make sacrifices,\r\nbut sacrifices are not required. Let us act, and then go home. A\r\ngrateful people will bind the wreath of victory around your brows, for\r\n\"Peace hath her victories not less than War.\"\r\n\r\nWe make no appeal to the sympathies of gentlemen. We ask you to do\r\njustice, simple justice to the South. Do it, and you will do honor to\r\nyourselves. Give us the guarantees we ask, and my word for it, you\r\nwill see the seceded States coming back one by one, and we shall see\r\nourselves once more a happy and a united people!\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--It is not my purpose to enter upon the wide field that\r\nhas been opened in this debate. I did not intend to speak at all. I\r\nknow well the position I occupy before the country. I am regarded by\r\nthose who do not know me as an extreme man. I am, if I know myself, a\r\nman of moderation, and, I trust, of firmness. I make these remarks\r\nbecause the time has come when I must separate from my delegation. I\r\nconcede every thing to their patriotism, good intentions, and\r\nintegrity. But I must separate from them in the votes they are about\r\nto give.\r\n\r\nWe are called here to consider the condition of the country. It is\r\nsaid that condition requires our interference--that such interference\r\nis necessary. The country has just passed through one of those\r\nconflicts which are incidental to our form of Government. It has borne\r\nthe trial, and I think it is safe.\r\n\r\nThose who insist that certain things shall be done, place us in a\r\ndelicate position. You say that you do not object to the inauguration\r\nof Mr. LINCOLN, but you refuse to permit his principles to be carried\r\ninto effect. We say that we have not merely elected Mr. LINCOLN, but\r\nwe have decided the principles upon which his administration shall be\r\nconducted. You refuse to permit this, and say that you will leave us\r\nand revolutionize, unless we consent to a counter resolution.\r\n\r\nThe contest in which we are now engaged is not a new one. It is of\r\ntwelve or fifteen years' standing. It assumed new proportions when we\r\nacquired Texas. Texas, under the laws of Mexico, was then free. We\r\ninsisted that slavery should not be recognized there. You claimed that\r\nit should--that slavery should go into all the common Territories of\r\nthe Union. You succeeded. You procured what you claim is a decision of\r\nthe court in your favor. But the people would not give the question\r\nup. The issue was formed--Slavery or Freedom; and on that issue we\r\nwent into the late election. It was well understood in all its\r\nbearings. It was discussed and argued upon both sides and all sides,\r\nand the people determined the question against the South. In my\r\nsection of the country there was no change. In all the excitement of a\r\nPresidential contest, I do not know of twenty votes that were changed.\r\nThe opinions of the people were formed before; now they have declared\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMy first allegiance is to the principles of truth and justice.\r\nConvince me that your propositions are right, that they are just and\r\ntrue, and I will accept them. I will sustain them to the end. If they\r\nare wrong--and I now believe them to be--I will never sustain them,\r\nand I will show my faith in GOD by leaving the consequences with Him.\r\n\r\nAny substantial change in the fundamental principles of government is\r\nrevolutionary. Yours may be a peaceable one, but it is still a\r\nrevolution. The seceded States are in armed revolution. You are in\r\ndirect alliance with them. You say the Government shall not retake the\r\nforts, collect the revenue, and you ask us to aid you in preventing\r\nthe Government from doing its duty.\r\n\r\nPermit this, and the judgment of the world will be that we have\r\nsubmitted to the inauguration of your principles as the principles of\r\nthe Government. It would exhibit a weakness from which the country\r\ncould never hope to recover. These are reasons satisfactory enough to\r\nme. I cannot vote for the first article.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Do you wish to get the seceded States back?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Certainly I do.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--How do you propose to do it?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I cannot say that I have any special way. It is their\r\nduty to return. There are better methods of coercing them than to\r\nmarch our army on to their soil. Now I understand it is your purpose\r\nto intrench slavery behind the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--Certainly. That is true--in a certain portion of the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I thought I was not mistaken. The Government has long\r\nbeen administered in the interest of slavery. The fixed determination\r\nof the North is, that this shall be no longer.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--Will the gentleman hazard the assertion that such has\r\nbeen the policy of Tennessee, Maryland, or Delaware?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I did not intend to say more than that such has been the\r\ngeneral policy of the Government. Another objection to the proposed\r\namendment is its ambiguity. Its construction is doubtful, when it\r\nshould be plain. Don't let us differ when we go home. If we do we\r\nshall settle nothing. Some will claim that the first article does not\r\nfurnish a slave code. Others will claim that it does, and such I think\r\nis a fact. I am also opposed to the second article. I do not think it\r\nis right thus to bind posterity. I am opposed to the third article,\r\nexcept the first clause. If you think there is really a purpose at the\r\nNorth to interfere with slavery in the States, I am willing a\r\ndeclaratory amendment should be adopted prohibiting such interference.\r\nI like that of Mr. FIELD much better. I can go for that with all my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAs to the foreign slave trade we ask nothing. The laws are well enough\r\nas they are, if properly enforced. Besides, you make too much of it.\r\nYou will claim hereafter that this formed one part of the compromise.\r\nIt will amount to nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--But the South wants the foreign slave trade\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Do not the statutes prohibit it? Why not enforce them?\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--We had rather have the prohibition in the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I am opposed also to abrogating the power of Congress\r\nover the District of Columbia. I hope to see slavery abolished in the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Will the gentleman from Pennsylvania abide by the\r\ndecision in the Dred Scott case?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Certainly, so far as it decides what is in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--You will not permit it to settle the principle?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I will not, any more than Virginia would accede to the\r\ndecision upon the Alien and Sedition Laws. I will be frank and go\r\nfarther. If the Court had undertaken to settle the principle, I would\r\ndo all I reasonably could to overthrow the decision.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--My voice has failed me to-day, and I do not know that I\r\ncan speak in audible tones, but I will try.\r\n\r\nI understand the gentleman who last addressed us to say, that there\r\nare to be incorporated into the administration of the Government two\r\nnew principles: one is, that there shall be no slavery in the\r\nterritories; the other is, that the action of the Government shall be\r\non the side of freedom. And furthermore, that slavery is to be\r\nregarded as a purely local institution, and that slaves are not to be\r\nregarded as property anywhere except in the slave States. Now, that\r\nwas just the way in which I interpreted the action of the North in the\r\nlast election, and it is precisely this view which has led to the\r\nsecession of the States. The gentleman well understands that a\r\ndifferent view of their rights under the Constitution prevails among\r\nthe Southern people. Will he also understand and recognize the fact,\r\nthat the Supreme Court has clearly given the sanction of its opinion\r\nto the Southern construction?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Ought not the action of the Government under WASHINGTON\r\nto be a precedent of some weight in our favor?\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I cannot accede to that. Now the North has inaugurated\r\nthis policy. We of the South say it is a subversion of the\r\nConstitution. The gentleman must as freely admit that the party just\r\ncoming into power must of necessity be a Northern party. It can have\r\nno affiliation with any party at the South. Now I ask, can we, as a\r\nmatter of policy or justice, whose rights are so vitally involved, sit\r\nby and see this done? Slavery is with us a democratic and a social\r\ninterest, a political institution, the grandest item of our\r\nprosperity. Can we in safety or justice sit quietly by and allow the\r\nNorth thus to array all the powers of the Government against us?\r\n\r\n     The hour of one o'clock having arrived, the PRESIDENT\r\n     announced that under the resolutions adopted by the\r\n     Conference, general debate must cease, and the Conference\r\n     would proceed to vote upon the report of the General\r\n     Committee, and various amendments proposed thereto.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I rise to a question of privilege. What was done by the\r\nConference with the credentials of the gentleman from Kansas?\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY:--The practice heretofore has been, to consider a\r\ngentleman a member, when the Committee on Credentials report in his\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Then I move to reconsider the action of the Conference in\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE:--I rise to a question of order. The committee have reported\r\nin favor of Mr. STONE, and that is conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the Conference has a right to pass upon the\r\ncredentials.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I have a serious objection to the admission of the\r\ngentleman from Kansas. He holds the commission of the Secretary of the\r\nTerritory alone, from a man who has never been appointed Governor. It\r\nis very irregular. It looks as though the gentleman was sent here only\r\nfor the purpose of giving the vote of Kansas to certain propositions.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--The delegate comes here with an appointment\r\nunder the seal of the State of Kansas. The act admitting Kansas\r\nprovides that all the territorial officers shall exercise jurisdiction\r\nuntil others are elected. I think it is in very bad taste for the\r\ngentleman from New York to question the regularity of the appointment.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I make a point of order. We have decided to proceed to\r\nthe vote at this time.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think this is a privileged question.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--I respectfully appeal from the decision of the\r\nPRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--I move to lay the whole subject on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I ask for a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It is somewhat difficult to decide what motion has\r\nprecedence. What was the motion of the gentleman from New York?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I moved a reconsideration of the action of the Convention\r\nadmitting Mr. STONE. Let us have a vote on that motion. It is as good\r\na test as any.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--I insist that the question is upon my motion to lay the\r\nwhole subject on the table.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken upon the motion of Mr. MOREHEAD, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Vermont--9.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I would ask, as a matter of courtesy, not to say of common\r\ndecency, that Mr. STONE may be permitted to state how and why he came\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. STONE, of Kansas:--I understand that I was appointed by the\r\nSecretary of Kansas, who was at the time the Acting Governor. I\r\nunderstand that the appointment was made in accordance with the\r\nEnabling Act of Kansas. I am not inclined to argue my right to a seat\r\nin the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I wish to ask the gentleman only one question. Was not\r\nGovernor ROBINSON actually in possession of his office before the\r\ndelegate received his appointment, and is he not in such possession\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nMr. STONE:--He was, and is.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--I call for the reading of the fourth Rule.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Rule was read by the Secretary, as follows:\r\n\r\n     4TH RULE.--A member shall not speak oftener than twice,\r\n     without special leave, upon the same question; and not a\r\n     second time, before every other who has been silent shall\r\n     have been heard, if he chooses to speak upon the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--In order to bring the subject fairly before the\r\nConference, I will put my motion in the form of a resolution, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the credentials of Mr. STONE, who desires\r\n     to act as a Commissioner from Kansas, be referred back to\r\n     the Committee on Credentials, with instructions to that\r\n     committee to report the facts concerning his appointment,\r\n     and whether it proceeded from the Territorial Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I wish the Committee on Credentials to stand right with\r\nthe Conference. We accepted the commission of the Acting Governor as\r\n_prima facia_ correct.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I wish to offer a resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--All resolutions are out of order.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think resolutions under the ruling of the Conference\r\ncannot now be considered.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I ask leave for the State of Iowa to vote on the motion\r\nto lay the subject of the admission of the delegate from Kansas on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe motion was granted, and Iowa being called, voted No; and the vote\r\nstood: Ayes, 10; Noes, 10. And so the motion was lost.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion here ensued on the subject of the admission of the\r\ndelegate from Kansas, which was participated in by Messrs. STOCKTON,\r\nCLEVELAND, COALTER, and others, when\r\n\r\nMr. STONE observed that he had no desire to force himself into the\r\nConference, and until the question was settled he thought it proper to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\nThe resolution offered by Mr. FIELD was adopted without a division.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOTE ON THE PROPOSITIONS AND AMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the consideration\r\nof the report of the General Committee, and the amendments thereto.\r\nThe question will be taken on the adoption of the first section\r\nreported by the Committee of One from each State, which the SECRETARY\r\nwill now read.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY read the report as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. In all the present territory of the United\r\n     States, not embraced within the limits of the Cherokee\r\n     treaty grant, north of a line from east to west on the\r\n     parallel of 36° 30´ north latitude, involuntary servitude,\r\n     except in punishment of crime, is prohibited whilst it shall\r\n     be under a territorial government; and in all the present\r\n     territory south of said line, the status of persons owing\r\n     service or labor as it now exists shall not be changed by\r\n     law while such territory shall be under a territorial\r\n     government; and neither Congress nor the territorial\r\n     government shall have power to hinder or prevent the taking\r\n     to said territory of persons held to labor or involuntary\r\n     service, within the United States, according to the laws or\r\n     usages of the State from which such persons may be taken,\r\n     nor to impair the rights arising out of said relations,\r\n     which shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal\r\n     Courts, according to the common law; and when any territory\r\n     north or south of said line, within such boundary as\r\n     Congress may prescribe, shall contain a population required\r\n     for a member of Congress, according to the then Federal\r\n     ratio of representation, it shall, if its form of Government\r\n     be republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal\r\n     footing with the original States, with or without\r\n     involuntary service or labor, as the constitution of such\r\n     new State may provide.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 2. Territory shall not be acquired by the United\r\n     States, unless by treaty; nor, except for naval and\r\n     commercial stations and depots, unless such treaty shall be\r\n     ratified by four-fifths of all the members of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 3. Neither the Constitution nor any amendment\r\n     thereof shall be construed to give Congress power to\r\n     regulate, abolish, or control, within any State or Territory\r\n     of the United States, the relation established or recognized\r\n     by the laws thereof touching persons bound to labor or\r\n     involuntary service therein; nor to interfere with or\r\n     abolish involuntary service in the District of Columbia,\r\n     without the consent of Maryland, and without the consent of\r\n     the owners, or making the owners who do not consent just\r\n     compensation; nor the power to interfere with or prohibit\r\n     representatives and others from bringing with them to the\r\n     city of Washington, retaining and taking away, persons so\r\n     bound to labor; nor the power to interfere with or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in places under the exclusive\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States within those States and\r\n     Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor\r\n     the power to prohibit the removal or transportation, by\r\n     land, sea, or river, of persons held to labor or involuntary\r\n     service in any State or Territory of the United States to\r\n     any other State or Territory thereof where it is established\r\n     or recognized by law or usage; and the right during\r\n     transportation of touching at ports, shores, and landings,\r\n     and of landing in case of distress, shall exist. Nor shall\r\n     Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\n     on persons bound to labor, than on land.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the\r\n     fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to\r\n     prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and\r\n     through the action of their judicial and ministerial\r\n     officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from\r\n     labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 5. The foreign slave trade, and the importation of\r\n     slaves into the United States and their Territories, from\r\n     places beyond the present limits thereof, are forever\r\n     prohibited.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 6. The first, third, and fifth sections, together\r\n     with this section six of these amendments, and the third\r\n     paragraph of the second section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution, and the third paragraph of the second section\r\n     of the fourth article thereof, shall not be amended or\r\n     abolished without the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United\r\n     States shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive\r\n     from labor, in all cases where the marshal, or other\r\n     officer, whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was\r\n     prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation from\r\n     mobs or riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such\r\n     fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner thereby\r\n     prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\n     the recovery of such fugitive.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope now the Conference will proceed in the regular\r\nway, and that the majority report will be first perfected so far as\r\namendments are concerned, and that then it may be adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I move to amend the first section by inserting, after the\r\nwords \"in all the present territory south of said line,\" the words\r\n\"including the Cherokee grant,\" and I call for a vote by States on the\r\nadoption of the amendment I propose. My object is to carry out the\r\ninstruction of the committee. A small part of the grant lies north of\r\nthe line. It is better to include the whole.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I move to amend the amendment proposed by the gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia, by substituting the word \"excluding\" for the word\r\n\"including,\" and on my motion ask a vote by States.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I think the gentleman does not understand the effect of\r\nhis amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I do not think we ought to regard the Cherokee grant at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--I think both the amendments important.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--We must recognize the Cherokee Territory, and not divide\r\nit. Upon mature reflection, I think the amendment is important.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon the motion of Mr. BACKUS, and resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\n     and Vermont--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia--9.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question is now upon the amendment offered by the\r\ngentleman from Virginia, as amended by the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope the amendment will not be adopted. It is not\r\nnecessary to the sense of the article. It is cumulative in its effect.\r\nWe have expressly excluded the Cherokee grant, lest we might seem to\r\noverrule the Cherokee treaty by a provision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken by States, on the adoption of the amendment\r\nproposed by Mr. SEDDON, as amended, with the following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, and\r\n     Vermont--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\nThus the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. PRATT:--I wish to enter my dissent from the vote of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--I now offer as a substitute for the first section, as\r\nreported, the following:\r\n\r\n     Strike out after the words \"United States,\" in the first\r\n     line, and insert as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Not embraced by the Cherokee treaty, north of the parallel\r\n     of 36° 30´ of north latitude, involuntary servitude, except\r\n     in punishment of crime, is prohibited. In all the present\r\n     territory south of that line, the _status_ of persons held\r\n     to service or labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed;\r\n     nor shall any law be passed to hinder or prevent the taking\r\n     of such persons to said territory, nor to impair the rights\r\n     arising from said relation; but the same shall be subject to\r\n     judicial cognizance in the Federal courts, according to the\r\n     common law. When any territory north or south of said line,\r\n     within such boundary as Congress may prescribe, shall\r\n     contain a population equal to that required for a member of\r\n     Congress, it shall, if its form of government be republican,\r\n     be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\n     original States, with or without involuntary servitude, as\r\n     the constitution of such State may provide.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--Let us first perfect the original. I move to amend by\r\ninserting after the word \"prevent,\" in the first section, the words\r\n\"or facilitate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I think we ought to perfect the section before we vote on a\r\nsubstitute. I move to amend it by inserting after the word \"line,\"\r\nafter the words \"territory south of said line,\" the following words:\r\n\"involuntary servitude is recognized, and property in those of the\r\nAfrican race held to service or labor in any of the States of the\r\nUnion, when removed to such territory, shall be protected and\"--\r\n\r\nI have not expressed my views at large upon the subject of the\r\ncommittee's report. I have earnestly wished to settle the perplexing\r\nquestions which now distract the country. I do not rise to make a\r\nspeech. I have not come here to exact more than the North can\r\nhonorably grant, nor to deceive the North in the result, if the rights\r\nof the South are not protected. Our property is involved in your\r\naction. You can afford to be liberal. If you intend to recognize\r\nproperty in slaves, write it down in the bond. If the North wants any\r\nprotection, name it, and we will put it into the bond. If you fear\r\nthat slavery may go north of the proposed line, we will give you any\r\nassurance to the contrary. But I tell you that on the other side we\r\nrequire reciprocal terms. Nothing else will satisfy the public\r\nsentiment. Twelve months hence and we will not take what we now offer\r\nto take.\r\n\r\nWhat are we talking about? Every one knows that the African race is\r\nbetter off at the South than it could be elsewhere. We do not wish to\r\ndisrupt the Union. You are doing it on a mere Northern abstraction.\r\nSuppose a foreign power asked you what you were fighting about, what\r\nwould be your answer?\r\n\r\nBut I was saying that the only way is for the North to be liberal; to\r\nbe reciprocal; to make us entirely safe. Our security must be put into\r\nthe bond and be faithfully preserved. The present _status_ of the\r\nStates in the Union is deceptive. If I am to remain in the Union, it\r\ndon't suit me. If I am to go into a southern confederacy, it is just\r\nwhat I should want. Beware, gentlemen of the North! You are cutting\r\nyourselves off from future glory and expansion.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--The gentleman from North Carolina wants the distinct\r\nrecognition of slavery in the bond. I would like to refer him to the\r\ncondition of this question when the Constitution was adopted. The men\r\nof that time would not assert such a position. They did not think it\r\nproper or necessary. If we adopt his views we attempt to sit in\r\njudgment on the men of that day. Mr. CALHOUN understood this matter\r\nperfectly, and in one of his speeches refers to the unwillingness of\r\nthe Convention to recognize slavery specifically. The sentiment of\r\nIowa is that no such recognition ought to be made now. I am opposed to\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I consider this an important amendment, and a very just\r\none. The principle upon which we are proceeding is that of partition.\r\nWe, with our property are prohibited from going north of the line. The\r\nexact correlative of that would be, that you should be prohibited from\r\ngoing south with your institutions. That we do not ask. On one side\r\ninvoluntary servitude is prohibited. On the other we simply ask that\r\nit may be recognized. We give up two-thirds of the territory\r\naltogether. All we ask is protection in the remaining one-third.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this proposition as it now stands? Who does not\r\nsee that its meaning is ambiguous? It requires us to give up\r\nterritorial protection, and leaves us with nothing but the shred of a\r\nright protected by the Federal courts. Once more let me tell you, that\r\nin my opinion the South will never consider this a satisfactory\r\nadjustment. You say we are protected by the principles of the common\r\nlaw. Who can tell what this will amount to? Assuming the territorial\r\ngovernment to be favorable, it could do nothing. You leave it\r\npowerless. Suppose a citizen of Virginia emigrates to the territory\r\nsouth of the line with his property. He would have no earthly right\r\nexcept under the laws of Virginia. The power to enforce those laws is\r\na thousand miles away. If we are to make a partition, let it be a\r\npartition. As the provision stands, it is the unfairest bargain ever\r\nmade. It is all on the side of the North. In common fairness and\r\nhonesty, I submit that the North ought to vote for this amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--There is much that is worthy of consideration in the\r\nremarks of the gentleman from Virginia. I hope earnestly that we shall\r\nnot adopt a proposal of amendment that admits of two interpretations.\r\nIf I could vote for the report of the majority at all, I would throw\r\naround it all the protection it needs. This is a new and peculiar\r\nspecies of property which we are now making the Constitution recognize\r\nand protect. If the South is entitled to the proposition itself, I\r\nthink they are entitled to this amendment. After all, it is only\r\nmaking the amendment express just what we know its friends claim it\r\nimplies.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I would have preferred the direct recognition by express\r\nterms of slavery south of the line proposed, and I voted that way in\r\nthe committee. I suppose, however, that the clause as it stands\r\nrecognizes the _status_ there, as it now exists--that it prevents all\r\ninterference with the _status_. Would you prefer to put into the\r\nproposition certain express terms which would destroy all chance of\r\nits adoption by the people? I do not think the world is governed by\r\nideas alone. It is governed by ideas and material interests. The\r\nConstitution of 1787 secured the interests of the slaveholder in the\r\nStates. This clause does the same in the Territories. No man can be\r\ncheated by it unless he cheats himself. Gentlemen favoring the\r\namendment must know that at least it will not improve the prospects of\r\nthe proposition with the people. Do you wish to break up the\r\nConference? This is an effectual way of doing it.\r\n\r\nWe ask for this proposition substantially as it stands. The North can\r\ngive it to us if it chooses. If it will not, then we shall go home and\r\ntell our constituents. They must decide for themselves what they will\r\ndo. This will settle the Territorial question effectually. What more\r\ndo we want? The additional guarantees? These are provided for in the\r\nother clauses.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I call for a vote by States on Mr. REID'S amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I shall vote for the amendment of my colleague. I have\r\noccupied no time in the general debate, but now I do desire to say a\r\nfew words about this amendment, and the proposition to which it is\r\noffered. The amendment brings up the very _gist_ of the matter.\r\nDifferences of opinion exist as to the effect of the clause. The\r\namendment settles them. This is no place to talk about devotion to the\r\nUnion. To be a Union at all it must be one that recognizes and\r\nprotects the rights of all. Any other Union is not worth the name; is\r\nnot worth preserving. We came here, it is true, to save the Union. We\r\ncame here to devise the means of saving it. Practically the Union is\r\nalready dissolved. If not dissolved it is disintegrated.\r\n\r\nWe ask first, additional guarantees for our rights--for Southern\r\nrights. They must be such as will satisfy our people, and bring back\r\nthe States that have left the Union. Short of this they will amount to\r\nnothing. I know the public opinion of the South on these important\r\nquestions. I have closely watched its growth. My own convictions as to\r\nwhat it will require are decided. Unless you use language and adopt\r\nterms in your proposals of amendment which will satisfy the seceded\r\nStates--which will induce them to return to the Union--your labors\r\nwill have been in vain.\r\n\r\nWhat is our claim? It is this, in short: We claim that every Southern\r\nman has the right to go into the Territories with his property,\r\nwherever these Territories may be. The Territories belong to both; to\r\nthe South as well as to the North. We want equality. We have no wish\r\nto propagate slavery, but every man at the South does wish to insist\r\nupon his right to enter the Territories upon terms of perfect equality\r\nwith the North, if he chooses to do so. He may not exercise the right,\r\nbut he will not give it up.\r\n\r\nWe want a division of the Territories. We want to set up landmarks so\r\nthat neither we nor our posterity shall dispute hereafter about the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina has instructed us to say to this Conference, that if\r\nthe CRITTENDEN amendment can be adopted here, we can carry it almost\r\nwith unanimity. There will be a struggle even with our own people, but\r\nwe can induce them to adopt it.\r\n\r\nWe have three hundred miles of border in common with South Carolina.\r\nOur trade and our associations are in that direction. It is useless to\r\ndeny that South Carolina has sympathizers among us in her recent\r\nmovement. You must consider these things, and give us a chance. We\r\nmust base our argument on principle; we must stand upon terms of\r\nperfect equality.\r\n\r\nThe proposition needs this amendment. As it stands it is ambiguous. It\r\nis worse than that, for its construction will depend on the opinion of\r\na Territorial Judge.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I come from a State that is deeply interested in the\r\nsubject of slavery. Nevertheless, I shall vote against the amendment\r\nof the gentleman from North Carolina.\r\n\r\nI belong to that class of politicians which believes that the people\r\nof every section of the Union have a right to go into all the\r\nTerritories of the Union, and take with them their property and hold\r\nit in safety. But we ought not, in our proposals of amendment to the\r\nConstitution, to insist upon what will be repulsive to any section of\r\nthe Union. I think the amendment is unnecessary--that the right we\r\nclaim is sufficiently protected without it. As it stands, neither\r\nCongress nor the Territorial Government has the right to impair the\r\n_status_ of the slave. What farther protection do we need? What other\r\ncan we have? Why should we insist upon the adoption of a new style of\r\nlanguage? We ought not to be unreasonable; we ought to content\r\nourselves with the proposition as it stands, and not put expressions\r\ninto it which will make the whole repulsive to a large section of the\r\ncountry, and which, in all probability, will defeat the whole\r\namendment when it comes before the country. I am not even sure that we\r\ncould get it there. I doubt whether it would pass Congress.\r\n\r\nThis is a very serious and important question. We wish to stay the\r\nhands of extremists on both sides. We wish to stand by the Union. If\r\nwar comes, our soil is to be the battle ground. I wish to avoid war. I\r\nwill insist upon this, and I will consent to no extreme opinions.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I do not see why Mr. GUTHRIE cannot accept the proposed\r\namendment. He and the gentleman from North Carolina are both aiming at\r\nthe same thing. The amendment is certainly the clearest. Do you\r\nsuppose the people are not going to understand the subject thoroughly?\r\nDo you suppose that they will be deceived by any such transparent\r\ndisguise of words? You do not pay them a very high compliment by such\r\na supposition.\r\n\r\nI must vote against the amendment, because I am opposed to the\r\n_principle_ of protecting slavery in the Territories. Such is the\r\nsentiment of the North. If it was not, I should vote for the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--As I intend to vote against the amendment,\r\nit is due to the Convention that I should state the reasons for my\r\nvote. I am in favor of a clear recognition of all the rights of the\r\nSouth, especially of our rights in the Territories. I voted for the\r\nCRITTENDEN amendment in the committee. I thought the North ought, in\r\njustice to us, to adopt that amendment. We, in this Conference, have\r\nselected a Committee of One from each State--a committee of able men,\r\nand we have placed this subject in their charge. They have consulted\r\ntogether. They have ascertained the views and feeling of the different\r\nsections of the country; they have embodied the result of their labors\r\nin this report. The question now presented appears to my mind to be\r\nthis: After all the time and ability they have given to their report\r\nin the present distracted and perilous condition of the country, shall\r\nI consent to put words into the amendment of the Constitution which\r\nthey recommend, that will ensure its defeat when it comes before the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nI know as certainly as that GOD rules in heaven, that unless we come\r\nto some satisfactory adjustment in this Conference, a convulsion will\r\nensue such as the world has never seen.\r\n\r\nI have been travelling for nearly two months in the seceded States. I\r\nbelieve I understand the temper of their people. I have found there an\r\nall-pervading dissatisfaction with the existing state of things, but I\r\nhave also found great devotion to the Union. I think we can yet save\r\nthe seceded States. But at least let us save Texas and Arkansas. As it\r\nis, black ruin sits nursing the earthquake which threatens to level\r\nthis Government to its foundations. Can you not feel it, while there\r\nis yet time to prepare for the shock? If this giant frenzy of disunion\r\nraises its crested head--if red battle stamps his foot, the North will\r\nfeel the shock as severely as the South.\r\n\r\nSuch is the prospect before us, and near to us, and yet gentlemen say\r\nthat they will not give _one_ guarantee to avert such dire calamities.\r\nWill not the gentleman from New York do one thing to save that Ship of\r\nState of which he spoke so eloquently, when she is already among the\r\nbreakers, and driving so rapidly toward that rocky shore against which\r\nher ribs of steel cannot long protect her? We are patriots all--we are\r\nbound to act together--to do something--to do our duty, and our whole\r\nduty--to do what will ultimately preserve the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--A few days ago the Conference listened to a deliberate\r\ndefence of the institution of slavery by its friends from the slave\r\nStates, in which at least one gentleman from a free State (Mr. EWING)\r\nparticipated. That defence could have had but one object. That object\r\nwas to place us who do not believe in slavery in such a position that\r\nwe could not agree to a compromise without endorsing the views then\r\nexpressed. Gentlemen expect us to give up our opinions and concur with\r\nthem. I have but one remark to make to all such suggestions. We\r\nentertain our opinions on the subject of slavery; we cannot, we will\r\nnot surrender them.\r\n\r\nWe are told that this contest must cease, or the Union must perish. I\r\nam inclined to think so myself. We stand ready to make any reasonable\r\ncompromise to save the Union, short of sacrificing our opinions. You,\r\ngentlemen of the South, cannot be satisfied unless our capitulation is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nI do not assent to much that is said here about the Border States. If\r\nthe Union is not dissolved until the Border States go to fighting each\r\nother, it will last forever.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--If we all mean the same thing, let us put it into the bond.\r\nThen there will be no room for misunderstanding or controversy. If you\r\nleave this article open to construction, nothing will be settled. The\r\ngentleman is mistaken if he supposes that I wish him to adopt my\r\narguments. I do not. If this provision, as it stands, protects slavery\r\nin the Territories south of 36° and 30´, why not say so in express\r\nterms? I question whether the article, as reported, recognizes\r\nproperty in slaves at all. I wish to settle the question now and\r\nforever. I do not wish to have my purpose perverted. I wish to carry\r\nhome to North Carolina a reasonable story. We have given up all our\r\nrights in the territory north of the line. Let the North be\r\nreciprocal. What shall I tell my people at home? That I have given\r\naway their rights in more than one-half the territory, and have not\r\neven secured a provision protecting property in slaves in the\r\nremainder?\r\n\r\nThe vote, on the request of Mr. CHITTENDEN, was taken by States, and\r\nresulted as follows:--\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, North Carolina, and Missouri--3.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, and Iowa--17.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--Tennessee approves the sentiment of the amendment,\r\nbut she thinks the requisite security is already given.\r\n\r\nMessrs. BUTLER and CLAY, of Kentucky, and Mr. DENT, of Maryland, asked\r\nto have their dissent recorded from the votes of their respective\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I wish to make a suggestion in relation to Mr.\r\nFRANKLIN'S substitute. I think it is not in order. The Conference has\r\nalready determined to perfect the committee's report, before\r\nsubstitutes are to be considered.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--I now move to amend Mr. FRANKLIN'S substitute, by\r\nstriking out all after the word \"prohibit,\" in the third line, down to\r\nand including the words \"common law,\" and inserting instead thereof\r\nthe words, \"but this restriction shall not apply to territory south of\r\nsaid line.\"\r\n\r\nMy proposition is offered in good faith, and to show that Iowa is\r\ndisposed to compromise. I do not say that this is as far as she will\r\ngo. I have inserted the very words used by our fathers. They\r\nprohibited slavery north and tolerated it south of the line. This was\r\nthe original proposition of Virginia. If there is any thing in its\r\nethics, they are Virginia ethics. Slavery now exists in these\r\nTerritories. Let it be there. There is slavery in Kansas, Utah, and\r\nNebraska. We cannot help it. It appears to me that the South ought to\r\naccept this amendment. It recognizes the opinions of our fathers. This\r\nwas JEFFERSON'S idea when he drew the ordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does recognize the relation of master and slave, in\r\nmy opinion. I do not like it, I confess. You in the South do not\r\nregard your blacks as slaves in the absolute sense of the term. You\r\nhave a right in their services, not in their bodies. You recognize\r\nthem as _men_ in various ways.\r\n\r\nAgain I say, I do not offer this amendment to embarrass the action of\r\nthe Conference. It secures slavery south of 36° 30´.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--This amendment would not be satisfactory either to the\r\nSouth or myself. In my judgment, it ought not to be adopted. We claim\r\nthe right under the Constitution as it is, to go into all the\r\nTerritories of the Union with our property. This right is confirmed to\r\nus by the decision of the Supreme Court. There will be no compromise,\r\nif we cannot go home to our people and tell them that you concede this\r\nright south of 36° 30´. Otherwise, they would throw the propositions\r\nin our faces. As it stands, the article gives you security, North. As\r\nit would be when this amendment is adopted, it would give the South\r\nlaw and litigation. We want peace. We cannot take this amendment.\r\n\r\nPending the consideration of the amendment offered by Mr. CURTIS, on\r\nmotion of Mr. JAMES, the Conference adjourned to ten o'clock to-morrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 23d, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order at ten o'clock A.M., by President\r\nTYLER, and its proceedings commenced with prayer from Rev. Dr. BUTLER.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of yesterday, in part, was read. The Secretary stated that\r\nhe had not found time to complete it.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--I move to rescind the resolution adopted yesterday\r\nallowing ten minutes to a member proposing an amendment, and ten\r\nminutes for the reply. I do not propose to discuss the motion. I think\r\nall will agree upon the necessity of rescinding the resolution. This\r\nwill leave the five minutes' rule in full force.\r\n\r\nA vote by States was asked by several members.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I wish to call the attention of the Conference to this\r\nsubject for a moment. I hope the present rule will not be changed. The\r\ndebate up to yesterday was upon general questions. We have not yet\r\ngone into detail. We tried the operation of the ten minutes' rule\r\nyesterday. I am sure that it will not be claimed that any gentleman\r\nabused it.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--We have scarcely discussed a question of detail connected\r\nwith an article in the committee's report.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--I will withdraw my motion.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I tried to offer a resolution yesterday which I deemed\r\nimportant. It was then ruled out of order. I am sure it is in order\r\nnow. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That whatever may be the ultimate determination\r\n     upon the amendment of the Federal Constitution, or other\r\n     propositions for adjustment approved by this Convention, we,\r\n     the members, do recommend our respective States and\r\n     constituencies to faithfully abide in the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I rise to a question of order. The report of the\r\ncommittee and the amendments thereto, are the special order of\r\nbusiness. We ought not to permit collateral questions to be brought\r\nin. We adjourned yesterday with the amendment proposed by Mr. FRANKLIN\r\nas a substitute for the first article of the committee's report before\r\nus. To that Mr. CURTIS, of Iowa, had offered an amendment, which was\r\nunder discussion. Let us keep to our rules.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the resolution of the gentleman from Iowa is\r\nin order now.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I hope the question will be taken upon my resolution at\r\nthe present time. All the questions we have been discussing are, in my\r\njudgment, secondary to another which ought to be first decided. Is\r\nthis Conference true to the Union--true under all circumstances? If\r\nso, I regard it as highly important that the Conference should give\r\nsome expression to that effect. Even if we should settle this great\r\ncontention about slavery to-day, other questions might afterward\r\narise. I am quite prepared to see a claim set up, to what is called\r\nthe right of peaceful secession. I would guard against all such\r\nclaims. The passage of this resolution would have a beneficial effect\r\nupon the public mind. I think we still have a Government which can\r\nprotect itself and the nation. My constituents believe this\r\npreliminary question quite as important as that of protecting slavery\r\nin the Territories.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I move to lay the resolution introduced by the\r\ngentleman from Iowa, on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. BUTLER:--I want the resolution read again.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--Let us all go on to the record. I ask a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was read, and the vote being taken by States, resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, and Ohio--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa--9.\r\n\r\nSo the motion to lay the resolution on the table prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the consideration\r\nof the order of the day. The question is upon the amendment offered\r\nby the gentleman from Iowa, to the substitute for the first section of\r\nthe report of the committee, offered by the gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I came into this Conference with the honest and single\r\npurpose of healing the unfortunate differences which now distract the\r\ncountry, having no sinister ends to answer. That purpose has hitherto\r\nremained unchanged. To accomplish it, there is nothing I will not\r\nsacrifice except principle and honor. I think the amendment of the\r\ngentleman from Iowa is, in substance, just the same as Mr. FRANKLIN'S\r\nsubstitute. In the one, a fact is implied; in the other, the same fact\r\nis expressed. I understand that neither proposition can command the\r\nsupport of those gentlemen in the Conference who favor a National\r\nConvention. Neither can the amendment command the approval of the\r\nborder slave States. Certainly not all, if it can any of them. The\r\nadoption, then, of this amendment, will operate as a defeat of the\r\nfirst section of the proposed amendment of the Constitution. Neither\r\nparty in this Conference will accept it. While, therefore, I believe\r\nit ought to be accepted--while I believe it amounts to nearly the same\r\nas the original proposition, I will not peril the Union upon a mere\r\nquestion of form.\r\n\r\nI did not come here to inquire into causes. Our differences exist, and\r\nI do not think they were occasioned by the success of the Republican\r\nparty in the last Presidential election. The plotters against the\r\nUnion have seized upon the occasion to accomplish their designs.\r\n\r\nBy no fault of their own, several of the Border States are placed in a\r\nvery unfortunate position. They wish to remain in the Union, but their\r\npeople insist that certain of their rights shall be previously\r\nsecured; in other words, guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIt is my firm belief that if the inauguration of President LINCOLN was\r\nover, if his administration had been for a few months in operation, we\r\nshould all be at peace. Now, we must act upon the facts as they are\r\npresented to us.\r\n\r\nI must vote against the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa in order\r\nto give the original proposition a fair chance. I wish to have it\r\ndistinctly understood that this is the reason why I cast my vote\r\nagainst his amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--I do not rise to debate the question at length, now\r\nbefore the Conference. I think that this amendment brings us at once\r\nto the true issue which the case presents. We have hitherto been\r\ntalking about abstractions. Now we come directly to the point. As this\r\nis a Conference to settle disputed questions, the sooner we come to\r\nthe true points in issue, the better.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of our present differences? It is not found in any\r\naction of the North. No Northern State proposes to disrupt the Union\r\nor to threaten its stability. But certain of the Southern slave States\r\ncome here and say to us that certain alleged rights of theirs must be\r\nsecured, or they cannot induce their people to consent to remain in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nI have heard a great deal said in this Conference about civil war.\r\nNow, civil war is not a pleasant subject to consider; but, gentlemen,\r\nI pray you to remember that the North proposes no civil war. She\r\ndeclines to consider the subject at all, now. If civil war is brought\r\nupon the country, it will be your work, not ours. The North will do\r\nall she can to stay your hands--to prevent you from plunging the\r\ncountry into civil war. She will not enter upon it until you force her\r\nto do so. When you begin it, and force her into war in order to defend\r\nthe Government and the Union, I have no doubt she will enter the field\r\nand carry on civil war until the Union is restored and its enemies put\r\ndown. Let me ask you, gentlemen, who have so much to say about war,\r\nwhether you had not better leave that question where it is?\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed, and very often stated here, that the present\r\nConstitution gives the right to the Southern slave owner to take his\r\nnegroes into any of the Territories of the United States, and hold\r\nthem there as slaves. I think it would be well for you not to act so\r\nentirely upon that assumption. A different view prevails quite\r\nextensively at the North. It will be a long time before that view is\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nNow, you gentlemen of the South propose to restore the Missouri\r\nCompromise line. To induce us to adopt it, you say that the territory\r\nsouth of it is a barren, worthless desert--that slavery can never\r\nobtain a substantial foothold there. Why, then, do you make the\r\nsubject one of so much importance? Why do you risk all the calamities\r\nof civil war and a disruption of the Union for such a poor reward? We\r\nshould distrust all your statements, we should disbelieve all your\r\nprofessions of patriotism, if we could for a moment credit the\r\nassertion that you would break up the Union on such a worthless\r\npretext.\r\n\r\nYou ring the changes in our ears upon the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt in your favor. Let me tell you plainly that there is no section\r\nof the Union in which the decisions of that court have been so fully\r\nand fairly respected and observed as in the free States of the North.\r\nWith that you should be satisfied.\r\n\r\nYou are in trouble; that is evident. Your troubles have been caused by\r\nthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise. That, again, was your work, not\r\nours. We opposed the repeal to the end. You had the power and you\r\ncarried it. Now the North is indifferent about the restoration of that\r\ncompromise; but if that will satisfy you, restore the _status quo_,\r\nand the North will stand by you. But you must not expect now, that the\r\nNorth will do any thing better for you than to extend the provisions\r\nof the Missouri Compromise to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--The gentleman from New York who has last addressed\r\nthe Conference, appeals to us to accept the amendment now proposed,\r\nupon the grounds of justice and equity. What is the present state of\r\nthe case? We claim the right to go into all the Territories with our\r\nsouthern property. The Supreme Court has confirmed this right to us.\r\nWith this advantage in our favor, we have met here to compromise. What\r\nis the proposition now? It is to give the North all the territory\r\nnorth of 36° 30´, and to leave all questions concerning the territory\r\nsouth of that line without any adjustment at all! That gentleman\r\nfavors no compromise at all. He proposes that we should go home\r\nwithout any adjustment. Shall we go back to our excited people and say\r\nthis: \"The North will make no adjustment with you\"? Is this the way to\r\nsettle the important questions that now distract the country?\r\n\r\nWe have not come here for war; we have come here for peace. We have\r\ncome to settle all the questions between us upon a fair and equitable\r\nbasis. How are we met? Gentlemen from the North say they will give us\r\nnothing. All we ask is right and justice--that right which the\r\nConstitution and the Court has given us in _all_ the territory,\r\n_secured in one-third of it_. With that we will be content.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen object to the phraseology of the article. Let them\r\nhave all that their own way. They stop here to quarrel about words?\r\nSettle those as you like, but we ask all the friends of the Union to\r\nstand by, and reject all amendments which affect the substance of the\r\narticle. Such a course will end all contention.\r\n\r\nWe read in Sacred History that the Israelites were once so\r\nconscientious that they would not fight on Sunday. They were attacked\r\nand overthrown. They finally agreed to compromise the question of\r\nconscience so far as to fight in self-defence on Sunday. They were\r\nattacked then, and the enemy was overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe report is not such as we could wish it might be, but, such as it\r\nis, we will accept it and stand by it. We will adopt it, and we ask\r\nthe North to adopt it, in the true spirit of compromise.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I am under the necessity of believing that the gentleman\r\nfrom Iowa is in earnest, in offering this amendment; but if I were to\r\npresent it, I should not expect any one to believe I was in earnest.\r\nWhat is the compromise which this amendment proposes? It is, in\r\nsubstance, that the North will take three-fourths of the Territory\r\nunder the Constitution, and the rest by force. If gentlemen entertain\r\nsuch views, we might as well come to a direct vote at once, and see\r\nwhether any thing can be done.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Iowa says this is the Missouri Compromise; but it\r\nlacks much of it. Besides, circumstances have greatly changed since\r\n1820, when the compromise was adopted. Now, seven States have left us\r\nand gone out of the Union, and we are acting in view of that fact.\r\nThere is a contest between the North and the remaining Southern\r\nStates, and the latter have no better chance in that contest alone,\r\nthan Turkey had in the grasp of the rugged Russian Bear. The gentlemen\r\nfrom these States do not threaten. All they say is, \"If we cannot\r\nagree longer together, let us go in peace. We will fight only in\r\nself-defence.\"\r\n\r\nThey ask us further, \"If we stay with you, how do you intend to treat\r\nus? As equals, or as inferiors?\" If as inferiors, we cannot sustain\r\nourselves with our people, saying nothing of our own self-respect. I\r\nacknowledge the force of these inquiries.\r\n\r\nA civil revolution terminated at the last election. The power to wield\r\nthe Government came into the hands of the Republicans. The\r\ncircumstances suddenly change. Political power leaves the South. What\r\nnow shall we give them in place of that? Shall we leave these States\r\nat our mercy? This is an earnest time. We should act as if the fate of\r\na great nation depended on our action. If we intend to say we will do\r\nnothing, let us say so plainly, and not by indirection.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I thank GOD I hear a voice such as I\r\nhave just heard from _that_ section of the country (Iowa)! I have been\r\na member of a recent Legislature of North Carolina, in which there was\r\na majority of secessionists. I have been jeered at in that body for\r\nthe opinions I have expressed, for I have told those gentlemen\r\nrepeatedly that if we could once get the ear of the North, the North\r\nwould do us justice. They pointed me to the raid of JOHN BROWN--to the\r\nmeeting in Boston, where the gallows of JOHN BROWN was carried with\r\nsolemn ceremonies into the Cradle of Liberty. They pointed me to the\r\nman who presided over that meeting, since elevated to the high and\r\nhonorable position of Governor of Massachusetts. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, I have replied that the masses of the northern people would deal\r\nfairly by us. I have told these secessionists to their teeth that Mr.\r\nLINCOLN was properly elected under the Constitution, and that he ought\r\nto be inaugurated. Their reply was, \"Kansas, and the JOHN BROWN raid!\"\r\n\r\nNow, I ask this Conference to look for one moment at the effect of the\r\namendment which is proposed. It withdraws all constitutional\r\nprotection from us north of 36° 30´. Adopt it, and what has\r\nMassachusetts to do but to import her foreigners into the country\r\nsouth, and take possession of it. New York will back her, and we shall\r\nbe swept from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the gentleman from New York means to say that the nation can put\r\nits foot on to the neck of the States and crush them into submission,\r\nlet him go into Virginia and join in another JOHN BROWN raid. Virginia\r\nwill treat him as she did JOHN BROWN. No! the gentleman has not\r\nstudied the motto of the Union. There is the _E pluribus_ as well as\r\nthe _unum_. If the new President proposes to come down to the South\r\nand conquer us, he will find that the whole temple shall fall. We can\r\nbe crushed, perhaps, but conquered, _never_!\r\n\r\nMr. BRADFORD:--Maryland has, under the lead of her constitutional\r\nChief Magistrate, determined to preserve her position of neutrality,\r\nand not by any action of hers to add to the prevailing excitement on\r\neither side. She has done what she could to allay the existing\r\nirritation, and will continue to pursue the same policy she has\r\nhitherto adopted.\r\n\r\nHere is a large file of amendments. Almost every delegation has given\r\nnotice of an intention to offer one or more. If we begin to adopt\r\nthem, I feel sure that we shall destroy all hope of an ultimate\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I desire to make an emphatic declaration to this\r\nConference. It is this: Give us the report as it came from the\r\ncommittee, without substantial alteration, and there is no power on\r\nearth that can draw the State of Maryland out of the Union! Maryland\r\nhas been called the heart of the Union. The day she leaves the Union,\r\nthat heart is broken! I am now inclined to set my face against all\r\namendments. I think that is the better course.\r\n\r\nIn the populous section of the State where I reside, the universal cry\r\nis, \"For God's sake, settle these questions!\" Why can we not settle\r\nthem? The committee inform us that the members of which it is\r\ncomposed, were nearly unanimous upon all points except the territorial\r\nquestion. Will reasonable men not yield a little to each other in\r\norder to settle that?\r\n\r\nThen let us look calmly at the consequences which must follow our\r\ndisagreement. I will enter into no panegyric of the Union. To use an\r\noften repeated expression, it needs none. It is enshrined in the\r\nhearts of the people with all the glories of the past, with all the\r\nglorious hopes of the future. It has given us a position in the front\r\nrank of the nations. There is every prospect that it will make us in\r\nthe end the most powerful among the nations. Who can look unmoved upon\r\nthe spectacle of such a Union about to fall into fragments? What\r\nsacrifice too great to avert such a ruin?\r\n\r\nWe all understand, we all agree that we can save the Union by settling\r\nthis miserable question of slavery in the Territories. We should be\r\nunworthy of ourselves and our trusts, if we set our division upon\r\nthis question above the preservation of the Union. How can it be\r\npossible that Union men, or even politicians, can hesitate as to which\r\npath ought to be taken? One leads to ruin, the other to a haven of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nIt will be a world-wonder hereafter, if we do not agree. The\r\npeople--the whole country, will stand aghast at the spectacle of folly\r\nwe present. I would not, for all the wealth and honors the nation\r\ncould bestow, be remembered hereafter as a man who stood between these\r\nmeasures of pacification and the people who should finally decide upon\r\nthem. I would not have the priceless blessing of the Union put in\r\nperil for a single hour, when its safety can be purchased at so small\r\na cost.\r\n\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN:--The civilized world is amazed at the present condition\r\nof one of the greatest Governments on the face of the earth. I\r\nparticipate in that amazement myself. What is that condition? In a\r\ntime of profound peace, of great prosperity, with the Government\r\nitself in the hands of southern men, State after State has dared to\r\nattempt to sever its connection with the Union. Even Florida, which\r\nhas cost us so many millions, which ever since we had her has been a\r\nconstant slough of expenditure, says we cannot even have the national\r\nproperty which happens to be within her territorial limits!\r\n\r\nI am not so strong a believer in the effect of legislative action as\r\nmany others. I have looked at the main points of our differences in\r\nthe light of history, and it is my belief that the laws of soil and\r\nclimate will settle this question of slavery in the Territories, much\r\nmore effectually than we can settle it by any legislative or\r\nconstitutional provisions.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Compromise once settled this Territorial question in a\r\nmanner satisfactory to the South. Through the influence of the South\r\nit was repealed. Now the South desires to have its provisions\r\nrestored. As I understand the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa, it\r\nexactly restores the _status quo_.\r\n\r\nWe are told, farther, that the natural allies of the border slave\r\nStates have left them; that, reduced in numbers, they cannot maintain\r\ntheir position against the North. This assumes that the North is\r\nhostile to the South. I deny it. I say that my state is the natural\r\nally of Kentucky, a more powerful ally than she ever had South.\r\n\r\nParties are governed by certain natural laws. A party which adopts a\r\nprinciple at war with the sentiments of the people may succeed for a\r\ntime by the force of party drill, but in the end it will go down. The\r\nCALHOUN doctrine destroyed a party. Under the operation of the same\r\nlaw the Democratic party has gone down. But you cannot destroy a party\r\nbefore its time. The effort of Virginia now is to overthrow the\r\nRepublican party. The effort will not succeed. It is equivalent to an\r\nattempt to overthrow the country.\r\n\r\nI am not frightened at this idea of giving guarantees. I do not think\r\nthem of much importance. I am willing to give such as are reasonable.\r\nWe hold to a certain extent to your doctrine of State sovereignty, and\r\nwould protect it.\r\n\r\nOur people North and South are too much alike in many respects. We are\r\nall inclined to stand too much upon party abstractions. This is almost\r\nthe only reason why we cannot agree.\r\n\r\nWe are told that some things stated here grate harshly upon the ears\r\nof gentlemen from the South. The converse of this is equally true. I\r\ncan take a rebuke, I trust, in a good temper, but I do not like to be\r\nstabbed in the house of my friends. I do not like to have doctrines\r\nand opinions imputed to me and my party which are only entertained by\r\na little knot of fanatical abolitionists in the neighborhood of\r\nBoston; a few men who will not vote under the present Constitution,\r\nand who are led and controlled by LLOYD GARRISON and WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--I am strongly averse to the introduction of the subject\r\nof party into the deliberations of the Conference. I did not intend to\r\nallude to party at all; but since the subject has been referred to in\r\nsuch impassioned terms, I feel that I must say a word about it.\r\n\r\nMany references have been made in this debate to the opinions of\r\nWASHINGTON. I wish his opinions were better observed and respected. I\r\nrefer to his appeal to his countrymen not to form parties with\r\nreference to geographical lines, and asking them to frown indignantly\r\nupon every attempt to form such parties.\r\n\r\nWhat WASHINGTON foresaw, at length has come to pass. Parties have been\r\nformed, and are now in existence, divided by geographical lines,\r\nhaving no interests or opinions in common. But no such parties can\r\nlong exist without threatening the stability of the Government.\r\n\r\nSo long as parties were national in their character; so long as they\r\nexcluded sectional interests from their platforms, their existence was\r\na benefit rather than an injury to the Union. Gradually they have all\r\ndrifted toward sectionalism, until now we find ourselves in a position\r\nwhich taxes the ability and ingenuity of the ablest men to provide for\r\nthe existence even of our Government.\r\n\r\nNow, I see no chance of safety for us until we reëstablish political\r\nparties upon their old bases, excluding all sectional considerations.\r\nWhen this is accomplished, the country is safe. It can only be done by\r\nsettling this territorial question, and removing all inducement to the\r\nformation of sectional parties.\r\n\r\nThe election of Mr. LINCOLN was a fair election. It afforded no just\r\npretext for secession, much less for the formation of sectional\r\nparties, or for creating sectional issues.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the advice, the counsels of WASHINGTON, become\r\nhis most precious legacy to the country. Shall we not regard the\r\nsolemn admonitions of the Father of his Country?\r\n\r\nI would ask our friends from the North--for they are our friends and\r\nnot our enemies--whether they will not listen to these counsels of\r\nWASHINGTON? He was always ready, always willing to submit to just\r\ncompromises, when they were necessary to the peace and happiness of\r\nhis country. Will they not emulate his example now?\r\n\r\nDelaware does not feel any special interest in this question of\r\nslavery in the Territories. She would have it settled in that way\r\nwhich would promote the interests of the whole Union. Her present\r\nimpression is, that the report of the committee presents the most\r\npracticable and equitable mode of adjustment. Long ago Delaware\r\nfavored the abolition of the slave trade. She has been consistent in\r\nher course on that question ever since. It is not unlikely that she\r\nmay soon favor the abolition of slavery within her limits. Her\r\nprogress has been in that direction. When the present Constitution was\r\nadopted, Delaware had fifteen thousand slaves. Now she has not more\r\nthan eighteen hundred.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I recognize the reason and propriety of the wishes of the\r\ngentleman from Maryland, to try the proposition now before the\r\nConference upon its merits. I certainly do not desire to have time\r\ntaken up in unnecessary delay. I do not think much of these statements\r\nabout civil war. Nor is there any attempt here to defame or injure any\r\nsection. No member here has any such intention. We seem to be divided\r\ninto two parties. Both are willing to act; neither asks for delay. One\r\ndesires action through Congress, the other through the people, acting\r\nin General Convention. We all have confidence in the people. What do\r\nyou see in this Conference? One-half of the Republicans here, are\r\nready to join hands with those who would invoke the action of\r\nCongress, and carry their propositions through, to send them at once\r\nto Congress. I am ready to carry your propositions directly to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nA word now to the Democrats in this Conference. You have always been\r\nour superiors in political address and management. You expect in four\r\nyears to bring the Government back under your control. My strong bias\r\nis in favor of a General Convention. That bias I got from the old\r\nDemocratic party. The first mention of such an idea I found in an\r\narticle in the \"National Intelligencer\"--a paper which certainly does\r\nnot advocate radical views. I am aware of the opposition which this\r\nidea will meet with here, and yet I have heard many gentlemen from the\r\nSouth say, that this idea carried out--the question fairly submitted\r\nto the people, and decided by them, their decision would be\r\nsatisfactory. And would not many of the Southern slave States be\r\nsatisfied with a decision upon these questions by a General\r\nConvention? Would not Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Tennessee be\r\nwilling to submit their interests to such a tribunal?\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to ask the members representing the Southern States in\r\nthis Conference, whether, when we offer you a General Convention,\r\nfairly elected, which shall patiently hear and firmly decide all our\r\npoints of difference, you had not better accept it? I assure you,\r\ngentlemen, in the most perfect good faith, that a convention is the\r\nbest alternative the North can now offer you. It is a fair and an\r\nhonorable alternative; and because it is so, the North will insist\r\nthat it ought to be satisfactory to you. If you refuse it, I ask you\r\nwhether, in the sight of GOD and Man, you will not have stood between\r\nthe country and peace? We act in secret here, but in the end all our\r\nactions will be exposed to the world. It will be seen that we were\r\nready to do justice to you, and to submit all your claims to the final\r\nverdict of the people. Should you not at least wait for their\r\ndecision?\r\n\r\nMr. DONIPHAN:--Will the gentleman support these proposals of amendment\r\nin a convention of the people, and will he use his influence to elect\r\nmembers of such a convention who will do the same? If the North will\r\ngive us such pledges as will secure that kind of action, perhaps we\r\nwill go for a General Convention. Without such a pledge, a General\r\nConvention would be worse than useless.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I am glad I have obtained the floor for a few minutes.\r\nI feel that it will be very painful for me to address the Conference,\r\non account of physical debility.\r\n\r\nBut I came here with the single purpose of accomplishing the\r\nsettlement of one or two important questions. Permit me, once for all,\r\nand for the last time, to tell the gentlemen from New Hampshire and\r\nConnecticut, that they wholly misunderstand the import of the action\r\nof the Legislature of Kentucky, and the views of the \"Louisville\r\nJournal.\" I have said, before, that in view of the fact that Congress\r\ncould not settle our difficulties, the Legislature of Kentucky asked\r\nfor a National Convention, as our only hope of making an adjustment.\r\nAfter this came the invitation of Virginia, like a bright beam of\r\nhope. Virginia invited you all, New York, New Hampshire, and\r\nMassachusetts, and the other States, to meet and consult for the\r\npublic safety. If you did not wish to secure our common safety, you\r\nshould not have accepted her invitation.\r\n\r\nMr. BOUTWELL:--Then we are to understand that if we do not favor the\r\nCRITTENDEN resolutions, we should not have come here at all.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I say nothing of the kind. But I insist that you\r\nshould tell us now, what the conclusion is to which you have arrived.\r\nWe want to know what you gentlemen, representing the Northern States,\r\nintend to do. Give us your votes. We have had enough of discussion,\r\nwhich amounts to nothing. If you will consent to no arrangement, let\r\nus know it now. We have a duty to perform toward our own people. We\r\nwish to relieve them from suspense, so that they may determine what\r\ntheir future course shall be, in view of the fact that you will do\r\nnothing for them.\r\n\r\nMr. COOK:--If Illinois had understood that she was only to come here\r\nfor the purpose of agreeing to the propositions of Virginia as\r\nannounced in the resolutions which accompanied her invitation, the\r\nConference may be assured that Illinois would not have appeared here\r\nat all. She understood that she was invited to a _Conference_, in\r\nwhich all the States were to meet upon a basis of perfect equality.\r\nThe very resolutions of the Legislature of Illinois, under which we\r\nreceived our appointments, assert that their adoption is not to be\r\nregarded as an assent to the resolutions of Virginia.\r\n\r\nWe think we are not passing the limits of propriety, when we insist\r\nthat we should be permitted to state the views and opinions of the\r\npeople of Illinois, on the questions which this Conference proposes to\r\ndecide. To state what we will and what we will not concede. There\r\nseems to be an unwillingness to give us this permission. If the people\r\nare now ready to give their sanction to the propositions contained in\r\nthe Virginia resolutions, they would send delegates here who would\r\naccept these propositions without debate or discussion. They have not\r\nyet done so. If they intended to limit our right of private judgment,\r\nthey have certainly not yet expressed any such intention. They\r\nunderstand, and we have not forgotten, that there is a broad\r\ndistinction between the guaranty of old rights and the creation of new\r\nones.\r\n\r\nWe now understand just what the South proposes. The question is\r\nplainly and distinctly presented to us, whether we will assent to a\r\nconstitutional recognition of the right to hold slaves in a portion of\r\nthe Territories of the United States. It is not a question of\r\nprohibition at all. We are required to assert the affirmative right of\r\nholding slaves independent of State laws, and under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nGentlemen present us this question, and coolly tell us we want no more\r\ndiscussion, no more arguments, no examination of our respective rights\r\nunder or outside the Constitution. We wish you to tell us at once\r\nwhether you will assent to our wishes or not. If you will not, then\r\ncomes some dark insinuations about going home to their people, and\r\ncertain consequences are to follow, of the precise nature of which we\r\nare not informed.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, when was the sanction of the American people ever secured\r\nto an important proposition in such a way as this? If we are not to\r\nexercise our judgment, and act according to its dictates, upon every\r\nproposal of amendment here presented, then, for one, I care not how\r\nsoon our deliberations end. Until we better understand our relative\r\npositions than we seem to at present, I do not see much use in\r\nprolonging the discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--Some concession must be expected from both sides, or we\r\ncannot agree. As a Northern man, I feel it to be my duty to get these\r\npropositions made as acceptable to the North as I can, and then to\r\nensure their submission to the people. Even then, we are not committed\r\nto the support of these propositions, though I myself should feel so\r\nto some extent. A single question is now presented to us. Shall we\r\naccept these propositions when they are perfected as far as they can\r\nbe, or shall we submit to a dissolution of the Union? I am willing to\r\nsay that I will yield my personal opinions for the purpose of\r\nconcession, and I do not think I show myself an inferior man by doing\r\nso. In all disputes, the firmest men are the first to yield. Let a man\r\nbe firm as a rock in battle, but conciliatory in council; especially\r\nin such a council as this, where the lives of millions may be\r\nconcerned. There is a firmness which is but another name for\r\nimprudence--for rashness. Take the case of a railroad collision. One\r\nengineer may have the right of track; it may be the duty of all others\r\nto recognize that right, and not interfere with his exercising it.\r\nBut, if another gets on to it, he who has the right would not be\r\njustified, if, in its exercise, he ran blindly on, and produced a\r\ncollision, destroying the lives of his passengers, when he could have\r\navoided the collision. So it is here. We may be right--the North may\r\nbe right; but we should not hazard the existence of the Union by a\r\ndetermination to exercise that right at all events, when, by some\r\nslight concessions, we could save the Union. Let us use our\r\njudgments--let us act in view of the facts here presented, with that\r\nprudence and discrimination which we apply to the ordinary affairs of\r\nlife, and all will yet be well.\r\n\r\nMr. KING:--I have not spoken hitherto, and should not now say a word,\r\nbut for the remark of the gentleman from Kentucky. I come here as one\r\nof the representatives of the State of New York. As such I am the\r\nequal--the peer of any representative of any other State on this\r\nfloor. I do not intend to be lectured into or intimidated from doing\r\nany thing which my judgment tells me I should not do, or should do.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for New York, I say that she holds her allegiance to the\r\nConstitution and the Government of the United States above and beyond\r\nany other political duty or obligation. With this obligation always\r\nbefore them, her representatives have come here to consult with you\r\nupon the present condition of the country. I am as old as the\r\ngentleman from Kentucky. I recognize no right in him to lecture me on\r\nmy political duties. I revere the Constitution of my country. I was\r\neducated to love it, and my own father helped to make it. I cannot sit\r\nstill and hear such declarations as have been hourly repeated here for\r\nthe last few days.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Does the gentleman consider this a consolidated\r\nGovernment or a confederation of States?\r\n\r\nMr. KING:--I consider this a confederation of States under the\r\nConstitution, and that in all that respects the General Government,\r\nevery good citizen owes an allegiance to it above and beyond that\r\nwhich he owes to his State or to any other political authority. And\r\nthat statement comprises nearly all I wish to say. The State of New\r\nYork at all times, in peace or war, has been loyal to the\r\nConstitution; and, although some of her representatives here may\r\nundertake to make you think differently, she always will be. Yes!\r\nloyal with all her strength and power! And as one of her\r\nrepresentatives, I shall yield nothing on her part to threats,\r\nmenaces, or intimidations. I believe the Constitution as it now stands\r\ngives you guarantees enough--all you ought to have.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I ought not to permit this vote to be taken, without a\r\nword of reply to the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina. The\r\nimpression would certainly be derived from his speech that Governor\r\nANDREW, of Massachusetts, approved of the JOHN BROWN raid. This is not\r\ntrue. There is not a particle of truth in the assertion. There is a\r\ngentleman here, who heard Governor ANDREW state publicly when he\r\nfirst heard of that raid, that JOHN BROWN must be crazy. It is true\r\nthat a meeting was held in Boston to raise funds to support the\r\npoverty-stricken family of JOHN BROWN. Governor ANDREW, I believe,\r\npresided; and a single paragraph taken from some remarks he made on\r\nthat occasion, has been scattered broadcast over the country. In order\r\nto understand what he did say, both the context and what followed it\r\nare indispensable. Those were carefully suppressed. The opinions of\r\nGovernor ANDREW are well known. They are in sympathy with those of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts. Neither he nor they approved the JOHN BROWN\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I call the gentleman to order. He is discussing a\r\nsubject which is strictly personal, having no connection with the\r\nreport of the committee, or the amendments offered to that report.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the remarks of the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts are not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--Well, I cannot proceed in order. I only desired to\r\ncorrect a misapprehension. I do not quite understand why these\r\nmisrepresentations should be made, and then objections interposed to\r\ntheir correction.\r\n\r\nMr. HOPPIN:--I rise, Mr. President, to address the Conference with\r\ngreat reluctance. If there is a gentleman within the sound of my voice\r\nwhose heart is full of anxious solicitude for the safety of the\r\ncountry, he will know how to sympathize with me. I do not represent a\r\nState containing four millions of people, but one of the smallest in\r\nthe Union; and yet little Rhode Island has a heart which beats true to\r\nthe Union. It so happened that she was one of the last to accept the\r\nConstitution; but when she did accept it--when she took upon herself\r\nits obligations--she became faithful to it, and she has ever since\r\nbeen true.\r\n\r\nI feel that my position is peculiar. I cannot judge of other men as\r\nsome gentlemen do. The North is full of men who do not concur in my\r\nopinions upon the question of slavery. I know they are honest and\r\nhonorable men. I should do injustice to them and to myself, if I\r\nbelieved them to be either corrupt or enemies of the Union and of good\r\ngovernment; and it is just the same in the South as in other sections.\r\nLooking around me upon these able and patriotic representatives, who\r\ncome here with full hearts and tell us of their position--of the\r\nfeelings of their people--of the anxiety and apprehension which is so\r\ndeeply felt among them, can I believe that these men are dishonest?\r\nthat they do not mean what they say? No, sir! Nobody can be so unjust\r\nand unfair as that.\r\n\r\nI think of these questions which we are discussing earnestly and\r\ncontinually. My heart is torn by conflicting emotions. I wish to\r\nperform my duty toward all sections, and I do feel sure that something\r\nmust be done for our southern friends. They wish to remain in the\r\nUnion--they do not wish to be driven out; and they tell us in all\r\nsincerity that something must be done to satisfy their people, or they\r\ncannot keep them in the Union. I know that the questions presented\r\nhere are very embarrassing to the North, but we must decide them. We\r\nmust do the best we can, and the North will sustain us; our\r\nconstituents will approve our action.\r\n\r\nRhode Island wishes to act fairly by all. She does not herself, need\r\nany amendments to the Constitution; but if her sisters need them, she\r\nwill consider their necessities. Her delegation here acts unitedly,\r\nand it's members are influenced by the same spirit. We have done all\r\nwe could to bring ourselves to a rational conclusion; and we feel, my\r\nfriends, as though this body ought never to separate until we come to\r\nan agreement--until we come to some compromise which will be\r\nsatisfactory to all.\r\n\r\nI cannot now, in the short time that remains, go into a minute\r\nexamination of the various points presented. This has been done by\r\nabler men. But I do feel that although the questions may be difficult,\r\nthere are none of them which, as sensible men, we cannot settle. Don't\r\nlet us forget our great mission and descend into personal abuse. Do\r\nnot let us forget our high duties. Let us perform them in a friendly\r\nand a Christian spirit. Let us look at the facts as they are. Let us\r\nnot spend our time in trying to find out who struck the first blow, or\r\nwho is responsible. Let us all unite together in one great, final\r\neffort to save the country and the Union.\r\n\r\nAs matters now stand, we who represent Rhode Island can see no way\r\nmore desirable than to vote for and support the report of the\r\ncommittee. And yet we do not insist upon that report. Show us any\r\nthing better, and we will go for it. But we will do nothing to widen\r\nthe breach--we will do all we can to heal it. My friends, I say once\r\nmore, let us go to work earnestly, and do not let us separate and go\r\nto our homes, until we can carry with us the glorious news that we\r\nhave healed up all dissensions and adopted a plan that will secure the\r\nUnion and make it perpetual.\r\n\r\nMr. CROWNINSHIELD:--I understand that the proposition of the gentleman\r\nfrom Iowa is to restore the Missouri Compromise. If so, does not his\r\nproposition commend itself to the Conference as one that will command\r\nthe respect and support of the country? I have asked, many others have\r\nasked, what is the cause of our present difficulties? The question\r\nmeets no direct reply--no definite answer. The repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise is referred to, hinted at, as the principal cause. If an\r\nanswer were extorted, I think it would be, the repeal of that\r\nCompromise.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Missouri Compromise is so simple that we all\r\nunderstand it. Southern men forced the measure upon the North. The few\r\nnorthern men who voted for it were swept out of their political\r\nexistence at the election which followed its passage. Which section is\r\nresponsible for its repeal--the North or the South? You say its repeal\r\nwas moved by a northern man. Very true! But he was a northern man who\r\nhad adopted southern principles, and who sought to secure the favor of\r\nthe South by this act. Southern men supported his proposition and\r\ncarried it through Congress against the votes and the remonstrances of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nThe South, then, established and destroyed the Missouri Compromise.\r\nThe South wishes to have its provisions restored. Why, then, are you\r\nnot satisfied to have it put into the Constitution, and so make it\r\npermanent and perpetual, if the North will consent to it? Are the\r\ncircumstances of the South so much changed? If it was equitable in\r\n1820, _à fortiori_ it ought to be equitable in 1861. Territory has\r\nbeen acquired since 1820, it is true, but it is all or nearly all,\r\nsouth of the compromise line. Restore the Missouri Compromise and this\r\nterritory will be devoted to southern institutions. What territory has\r\nbeen acquired since? Will gentlemen reply, \"Oregon\"? I insist that\r\nOregon was virtually acquired before. It only required the final\r\nagreement upon a boundary line.\r\n\r\nIf there is any proposition in which the North can concur--any that\r\nwill restore harmony between the North and the South--it is the\r\nrestoration of the Missouri Compromise. If any other is proposed less\r\nfavorable or just to the North, I do not believe the people will adopt\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI am not insensible to the condition of the country. Neither are my\r\ncolleagues, nor the constituents they represent. But you must not\r\nexpect us here, in the worst emergency you can imagine, to forget or\r\nthrow away the rights of our people. If we consent to support this\r\namendment, it is as far as we can go. You ought not to ask us to go\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I will only occupy one moment. Maryland has spoken in\r\nlanguage which satisfies me. As I understand him, I concur in what my\r\ncolleague has said.\r\n\r\nNow the nut is to be cracked. The majority report proposes to give up\r\nthree-fourths of our territory to the North absolutely, retaining the\r\nlittle balance for the South. The amendment proposes to pick the\r\nkernel out of the balance, and to leave the husks to us. To that we\r\nshall agree when we are compelled to; not before.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--The Supreme Court has already decided, in\r\nterms which are not ambiguous, that Congress has no right, under the\r\nConstitution, to prohibit slavery in the Territories. Now, our\r\nbrethren of the North propose to give us the Missouri Compromise. What\r\ndo they mean? Do they intend to give us a substantial right--one that\r\nwe can enforce and rely upon, or do they intend to keep it from us?\r\nThey are shrewd as well as honorable men. They know that the effect of\r\nthis amendment will be to leave the territory south of the line,\r\nwithout the slightest acknowledgment or guaranty, just where it is at\r\nthe present time, so far as slavery is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe construction placed upon the Missouri Compromise was, that the\r\nprohibition of slavery north of the line which it established, implied\r\nthe right of holding slaves south of the line. At the time of its\r\nadoption there was, in respect of this construction, no difference of\r\nopinion: Such was the construction of Mr. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nNow you propose to leave it still for Congress to legislate as to the\r\nterritory south. You secure that north, by a prohibition in the\r\nConstitution; you will get that south, by the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe decision in the Dred Scott case may be reversed. It afforded no\r\npermanent protection. One of your leaders (Mr. WILMOT) says he will\r\nwar against it. The gentleman from New York (Mr. SMITH) denies the\r\nforce of the decision in this respect. Now, gentlemen, all we of the\r\nSouth want, is to have this question settled. You know well that the\r\nadoption of this amendment, so far from settling it, leaves it all\r\nopen; or rather it settles the question North, and leaves it open\r\nSouth. The country is in danger--that all concede. Will you, because\r\nyou do not agree in opinion with the Supreme Court, refuse to join us\r\nin one more effort to save the country?\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I have not unnecessarily occupied a moment of the time of\r\nthis Conference, and it is not now my intention to occupy the whole\r\nten minutes to which I am entitled. But I do wish to express some of\r\nthe opinions which I entertain upon the questions immediately under\r\nour consideration. \"Red Gauntlet\" has been cited as an authority in\r\nthis body, but I think I might cite another of the same class which\r\nwould be more in point. It is the \"Bleak House,\" by Charles Dickens,\r\nin which the circumlocution office is so graphically described. It\r\nwould be decidedly more appropriate to our present action.\r\n\r\nWhy have we come together? What brought us here? We have come to\r\ndevise the means of saving a distracted and bleeding country. What the\r\nSouth asks you to do, is, to recognize the property which her citizens\r\npossess; and when they take that property to the Territories, to\r\nsecure its protection there, or rather to protect it south of the line\r\nof 36° 30´. Will you do it? Are you going to do it? If you intend to\r\nrecognize our property south of this line, write it down so plain that\r\nmy constituents can understand it--so that they will not be cheated.\r\nIf you intend to do nothing, let us know it at once. We will then know\r\nwhat to expect, and how to advise our people.\r\n\r\nThe question of slavery is but an incident to the great questions\r\nwhich are at the bottom of our divisions. Such differences have\r\nbrought war after war upon Europe. It is, after all, the old question\r\nof the balance of power between the different sections and different\r\ninterests. Who does not remember that in 1832 and 1833 the Tariff\r\nbrought up the same questions? Why did South Carolina then threaten to\r\nnullify? Because nullification then, was one of the effects which the\r\ndisregard of the rights of a section caused.\r\n\r\nThe South have always insisted upon terms of equality with the North.\r\nTo this equality no one can deny she is justly entitled. So long as\r\nnew States came in _pari passu_, North and South, she was satisfied.\r\nWhen this equilibrium was disturbed, she began to insist upon\r\nguarantees. Now, when you propose to put the point of equilibrium out\r\nof sight altogether, the South insists upon these guarantees, as not\r\nonly necessary, but indispensable to her safety. This is right and\r\nfair. The North would insist upon the same thing, under like\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nGentlemen from the North have complained here that we have not stated\r\nexactly what would satisfy us. We have told you what we wanted over\r\nand over again. We want the CRITTENDEN resolutions. We told you that,\r\nwhen we first came here. We have now been here for nearly four weeks,\r\nand the CRITTENDEN amendment has never once been submitted to a vote.\r\nSince our difficulties first assumed importance, there has never been\r\na measure of pacification suggested which has met with such a measure\r\nof acceptance as the CRITTENDEN resolutions. State after State has\r\nsent petitions to Congress asking for their adoption. Almost the\r\nentire South, with Virginia, the Mother of States, in the advance,\r\ntells you that these resolutions will be an acceptable measure of\r\npacification, and yet you will not give us a vote upon them; you will\r\nscarcely consent to consider them. Even the committee, whose report is\r\nso unsatisfactory to the North (and a portion of the South also), does\r\nnot appear to have given them much attention.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in behalf of the South, I think I know what to say. If\r\nour differences are to be settled at all, we must have our property in\r\nour slaves in the Territories recognized; and when that property is\r\nconstitutionally recognized, it must be constitutionally protected.\r\nSuch, I know, are the sentiments of the people of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. ALLEN:--I wish to ask the attention of the Conference for only\r\none moment to the true aspect of the question now before us. We are\r\nasked if we will suffer the Union to be destroyed on account of the\r\nTerritory of New Mexico. Let me ask these gentlemen who it is that\r\nproposes to break up and destroy the Union? It is the South--it is\r\n_not_ the North. But all that I pass by.\r\n\r\nIf it were merely a question of who should have the beneficial\r\npossession of our present unoccupied territory, we would give that up\r\nat once to the South. But it is not a question of possession at all.\r\nIt is _the_ question which shall control and give direction to the\r\npolicy of the country--the institutions of Slavery or the institutions\r\nof Freedom! You ask for a provision in the Constitution which will\r\nplace that policy under the control of the institutions of slavery.\r\nThis we cannot grant you.\r\n\r\nWe of the North stand where our fathers did, who resisted the Stamp\r\nAct; who threw overboard the tea in Boston harbor. We have been taught\r\nto resist the smallest beginnings of evil; that this is the true\r\npolicy. _Obsta principii_ was the motto of our fathers. It is ours.\r\nThe debates of this Conference, and those of the Convention of 1787,\r\nwill stand in a strange contrast to each other.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I now offer the minority report of the committee, with\r\nthe accompanying resolutions as an amendment to--\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The gentleman from Connecticut is not in order.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken by States, upon the amendment offered by Mr.\r\nCURTIS, to the substitute proposed by Mr. FRANKLIN, for the first\r\narticle of the section reported by the General Committee, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, and\r\n     New York--6.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio--12.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. CORNING:--I dissent from the vote of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I wish to be recorded as voting Aye!\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--I dissent; I am against the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. WOOD:--I wish my vote recorded in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. COOK:--And so do I.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I am the other way.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I dissent from the vote of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--And I from that of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. WOLCOTT:--I dissent from the vote of Ohio. I notice that my\r\ncolleague, Mr. CHASE, is not present at this moment.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I also dissent from the vote of New York. My associate,\r\nGEN. WOOL, is confined to his room by a severe indisposition. For his\r\nbenefit, and as I know he feels a deep interest in these votes, and\r\ndesires to have his name appear upon the record, in his behalf I offer\r\nthe following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, Whereas JOHN E. WOOL, a delegate from New York,\r\n     is unable to attend the Convention, from sickness, therefore\r\n     that he be permitted, when he does attend, or by\r\n     communication in writing to the Secretary, to have his\r\n     dissent recorded, as to any vote of his State.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question now will be upon the adoption of the\r\nsubstitute proposed by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FRANKLIN),\r\nto the first section of the article reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--Before that question is taken, I desire to accept\r\ncertain verbal amendments which have been proposed by various members,\r\nwhich will, I think, improve the substitute which I offer. These\r\namendments are as follows:\r\n\r\n     1st. In the fifth line, as printed, after the words \"nor\r\n     shall any law be passed,\" insert the words \"by Congress or\r\n     the Territorial Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n     2d. In the sixth line, after the words \"the taking of such\r\n     persons,\" insert \"from any of the States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\n     3d. In the eighth line, before the words \"according to the\r\n     common law,\" insert the words \"course of the.\"\r\n\r\n     4th. In the seventh line, after the words \"prevent the\r\n     taking of such persons,\" insert the words \"from any State in\r\n     the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThese amendments I adopt, and wish them to be treated as incorporated\r\ninto my substitute.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--Such will be assumed as the pleasure of the\r\nConference, as no objection is made.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I am content, on the part of the committee, that the\r\nsubstitute offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania should be\r\nadopted in the place of the first section of the article reported by\r\nthe committee. It amounts to the same thing, and is expressed in\r\nshorter and better language.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I move to amend Mr. FRANKLIN'S substitute as\r\nfollows:[3] I think these words would be more acceptable to the people\r\nof the Northern States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This was a verbal amendment. I was not able to note it at\r\nthe time, nor have I since been able to procure it.]\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--Does not the gentleman's amendment involve an\r\nHibernicism? I think if we are to adopt the report of the committee,\r\nthe FRANKLIN amendment admits of no improvement. It had better stand\r\nas it is. If we undertake to change it we shall all get to sea.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I withdraw my proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--It was moved yesterday to insert the words, \"or\r\nfacilitate\" after the words \"hinder or prevent,\" in that part of Mr.\r\nFRANKLIN'S amendment which negatives the right to pass laws. What was\r\ndone with that?\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--Nothing. I moved it, and I insist upon the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I submit to the Conference whether this amendment is\r\nnecessary or proper. Suppose some new question arises relating to\r\nslavery which it may be greatly for the interest of the Territory to\r\nprotect. Suppose mines are discovered, and the Territory should want\r\nslaves to work them. Shall we put it into the Constitution that no law\r\nshall be passed to encourage their emigration?\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I see no need of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--The point generally comes out. Now you say that you will\r\nhave the right to go into the Territory with your slaves, and no law\r\nshall be passed to prevent you, no matter how much such a law would\r\npromote the material interests of the Territory. The converse of this\r\nyou will not agree to. You are not content to let slavery stand by\r\nitself, you must have it nursed by the Territorial Legislatures. Does\r\nslavery always require such partiality? I say the power of the\r\nLegislature should be exercised on both sides, or it should not be\r\nexercised at all. I am trying to perfect the article. If it is to\r\npass, and go to the people as a measure of pacification, and if you\r\nexpect them to adopt it, you must not have it so one-sided and unfair.\r\nThe people will understand it--it will be our duty to explain it to\r\nthem, and to give them its history.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--But your amendment would prohibit the passage of a law\r\npermitting the transit of a slaveholder through the Territory with his\r\nproperty. Remember, also, that the prohibition only continues so long\r\nas the territorial condition exists.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--Before this vote is taken, I wish to call attention to the\r\ncharacter of the prohibition. \"Nor shall any law be passed to hinder\r\nor prevent the taking of such persons to said Territory, nor to impair\r\nthe rights arising from said relation,\" &c. Now, this is very broad.\r\nSuppose a law giving the right of transit to the people of the free\r\nStates, or any law for their protection in the Territory, as\r\ninhabitants, is held by the Territorial Judge to \"impair the rights\r\narising from said relation.\" He holds it unconstitutional. Where is\r\nthe remedy? What views are entertained upon some of these points in\r\nsome sections of the South we know. If you do not adopt this amendment\r\nit is quite in the power of the Legislature to exclude any person from\r\nthe Territory whose presence there may be thought injurious to\r\nslavery. Did the committee intend this?\r\n\r\nThe question upon the adoption of Mr. FOWLER'S amendment resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\n     Iowa--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and\r\n     Ohio--10.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I move to amend the substitute offered by Mr.\r\nFRANKLIN, by inserting after the words \"nor shall any law be passed,\"\r\nthe words \"by Congress or the Territorial Legislature.\" I think this\r\nis necessary to make our intention plain. Otherwise it might be said\r\nthat the prohibition did not apply to Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--I think the suggestion a very proper one. I will accept\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I only wish to understand where we are. Have we disposed\r\nof the word \"facilitate\"?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--That amendment was not adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Then I move to insert before the word \"_status_,\" the\r\nword \"legal.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--That raises again every question we have been discussing.\r\nThe word, as used in the substitute, only refers to the status _in\r\nfact_.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--This brings up all our old troubles. Let us reject it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I wish to understand this subject, and what will be the\r\neffect of adopting this amendment. I understand that the slave has\r\nwhat we call a _status_. The substitute of Mr. FRANKLIN is intended\r\nspecifically to recognize and protect that _status_ in the Territories\r\nas fully as it is protected and recognized in the States. I think it\r\nhas that effect. Adopt the amendment, and the effect is precisely the\r\nopposite. The amendment rescinds the _status_.\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--I wish to make an inquiry of the mover. Does the\r\namendment, after all, make any difference? Must not any _status_, not\r\nagainst law, be, of necessity, a _legal_ status?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--No. I think there is a wide difference, and the South\r\nthinks so. One is a status in fact, the other, one in law.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I hope we shall not adopt the amendment. We all want these\r\nquestions settled. The amendment opens them all wider than before. If\r\nwe intend to give the South the right she asks for, and, as I think,\r\nrightfully asks for, let us give it to her in plain and unequivocal\r\nlanguage. Let us not give her a legacy of litigation, by using words\r\nwhich mean one thing or the opposite, according to the construction\r\nyou place upon them. I wish to settle all these questions fairly. The\r\namendment leaves the question as to what constitutes a _legal status_,\r\nto be decided by the Court. The North would claim that there cannot be\r\nsuch a thing as a legal status, a legal condition of slavery. The\r\nSouth would claim the opposite.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--If the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina had\r\nbeen adopted, I would not have moved this. The section then would have\r\nbeen unambiguous and clear. Now it is all open to construction.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--In my judgment it is unimportant whether the amendment is\r\nadopted or not. The condition of the slave in the Southern States is\r\none arising out of law, established by legislative provisions. _Status\r\nin fact_ must mean _status in law_ as well as _status in fact_.\r\n\r\nI have listened with attention to the appeals made by gentlemen who\r\nurge the interests of the South in favor of a settlement of these\r\nquestions. But you are now prosecuting a plan which will be the\r\nsubject of debate throughout the country. Adopt your article in either\r\nform, and the question, What does status mean? will still remain.\r\n\r\nA majority of the people have adopted the opinion that under the\r\nConstitution slavery has not a legal existence in the Territories. The\r\ntriumph of this opinion is not the result of any sudden impulse. A\r\nPresident has been elected, and a Government will soon be organized,\r\nwhose duty it will be to respect and observe the opinions of the\r\npeople. You are now seeking, by the adoption of a single section, to\r\nchange these opinions and this policy. Do not deceive yourselves,\r\ngentlemen. You will never accomplish this result so easily. You are\r\npresenting such a subject for debate and excitement as the country\r\nnever had before. It is best we deal frankly.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon the adoption of the amendment, and resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, and Ohio--11.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I move to insert in the substitute offered by Mr.\r\nFRANKLIN, after the words \"south of that line,\" the words \"not\r\nembraced by the Cherokee treaty.\"\r\n\r\nA word of explanation. Do we intend to prohibit the Cherokee Nation\r\nfrom changing the status of persons within their Territory, if they\r\nthink proper to do so? Would not this be a violation of our\r\nunderstanding, if not of our treaty stipulations with these Indians?\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I have looked into this subject, and I do not think the\r\nproposition would be improved by the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--Then I will withdraw it for the present.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope the vote on the main question will now be taken.\r\nIt is evident that the sense of the majority is against accepting\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--That obliges me to renew my motion. I do renew it, and\r\nask for a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the amendment offered by Mr. GOODRICH was taken, with\r\nthe following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, and Iowa--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--9.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I move to amend the substitute offered by Mr. FRANKLIN,\r\nby inserting after the words \"hinder or prevent,\" the words \"or\r\nencourage.\"\r\n\r\nI think there is a palpable difference between the word \"encourage\"\r\nand the word \"facilitate.\" The former is broader and less restricted.\r\nIf this measure is to be commended to the favor of the North, it\r\nshould be deprived of this one-sided character.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--We have already decided this question. In every\r\npractical sense the words are synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon the amendment offered by Mr. TURNER, and\r\nresulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\n     Iowa--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and\r\n     Ohio--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I ask the Conference now to let us have a vote.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Not just yet. I move to amend the substitute offered by\r\nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania, by the insertion after the clause\r\nproviding for the division of the territory, of the following:\r\n\r\n     \"All appointments to office in the Territories lying north\r\n     of the line 36° 30´, as well before as after the\r\n     establishment of Territorial governments in and over the\r\n     same, or any part thereof, shall be made upon the\r\n     recommendation of a majority of the Senators representing,\r\n     at the time, the non-slaveholding States. And, in like\r\n     manner, all appointments to office in the Territories which\r\n     may lie south of said line of 36° 30´, shall be made upon\r\n     the recommendation of a majority of the Senators\r\n     representing, at the time, the slaveholding States. But\r\n     nothing in this article shall be construed to restrain the\r\n     President of the United States from removing, for actual\r\n     incompetency or misdemeanor in office, any person thus\r\n     appointed, and appointing a temporary agent, to be continued\r\n     in office until the majority of Senators as aforesaid may\r\n     present a new recommendation; or from filling any vacancy\r\n     which may occur during the recess of the Senate; such\r\n     appointment to continue _ad interim_. And to insure, on the\r\n     part of the Senators, the selection of the most trustworthy\r\n     agents, it is hereby directed that all the net proceeds\r\n     arising from the sales of the public lands, shall be\r\n     distributed annually among the several States, according to\r\n     the combined ratio of representation and taxation; but the\r\n     distribution aforesaid may be suspended by Congress, in case\r\n     of actual war with a foreign nation, or imminent peril\r\n     thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I invite the careful and deliberate attention of the\r\nConference to the provisions of this amendment. It is commended by\r\nhigh authority. It is commended by nothing inferior to the wisdom and\r\nexperience of our honored President. It is intended as a division of\r\nthe territory between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nNow, to insure a fair operation of the provisions of the Constitution,\r\nas they will stand in that instrument when amended as we propose, we\r\ndeem it very essential that the rights of the southern section should\r\nbe secured by such an amendment as this. It will be noticed that Mr.\r\nFRANKLIN'S substitute precludes us from any appeal to Congress or the\r\nTerritorial Legislatures for affirmative protection. The powers of\r\nthose bodies will be negative only. We have nothing left, then, but\r\nthe Federal Courts. We ask now that we may not be subjected to the\r\ngovernment and power of Federal officers, whose opinions are against\r\nus--who will exercise those powers for our oppression. Congress or the\r\nPresident may send into a Territory in the southern section, a set of\r\nofficers who are anti-slavery propagandists, who will exercise all\r\ntheir official powers to our injury. I hold this amendment to be\r\neminently just and fair. We have no protection from Congress; none\r\nfrom the Legislature. Is there a chance, even, unless such a provision\r\nis adopted, that the South will ever be placed in the favorable\r\npossession or enjoyment of the rights you are willing to concede to\r\nus?\r\n\r\nThe latter portion of the amendment is equally just. The Government\r\nholds the public lands in trust. It is better to divide their proceeds\r\nat short intervals, and thus remove the subject from all danger of\r\ncorrupting influences. But I shall leave this to be discussed by the\r\nmover.\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--I move to rescind the ten-minute rule adopted by the\r\nConference, so far as the President is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. PALMER was agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nPresident TYLER:--I am very grateful for the compliment which the\r\nConference extends to me in the vote which has just passed. I will not\r\nabuse its kindness.\r\n\r\nThe amendment which is offered may, at first sight, appear to be\r\nextraordinary; but I wish to say, in all seriousness, that all my\r\nexperience in public life leads me to favor its adoption. I wish to\r\nhave the Conference understand fully its import and meaning.\r\n\r\nThat policy is the best, which reduces within the narrowest limits the\r\npatronage to be exercised by the Executive authority. Every party out\r\nof power has discovered that in the patronage of the President there\r\nis a voice of greater potency than is heard elsewhere in the\r\nGovernment. This amendment places a limitation upon the power of the\r\nPresident. It confers upon a majority of the Senators from each\r\nsection the power to recommend appointments to office, and this will\r\nbe found in practice equivalent to the power of appointment. It is the\r\nonly practicable limitation of Executive patronage. The power of the\r\nExecutive in this Government is very great. Limit it, abridge it as\r\nyou may, and the President will have a power in the Government which\r\nis not possessed by any sovereign of any throne in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis is not a political question. Our warrant for the adoption of this\r\nplan will be found in the tranquillity it will give to the country--in\r\nthe peace which will result from it. We are now settling differences\r\nbetween the States. Adopt this provision, and we secure unanimity\r\nforever. You will always find that dissatisfaction is confined to\r\nlimited portions of the country. The North is content with the\r\nexisting state of things--so is three-fourths of the South. Remove\r\nthis power from the Executive, and those measures will be adopted\r\nwhich will promote the welfare of the greater number. Do you not see\r\nthat you have in this way good security for the selection of the best\r\nmen?\r\n\r\nSuppose the Government should start to day on this new policy--that it\r\nshould avoid all propagandism--should place honest, competent men,\r\nonly, in office--should let all others understand that there was no\r\nchance for them--should permit both sides, all sides to be fairly\r\nrepresented. You would ensure peace, secure quiet in the country\r\nforever. You would thus heal the wound, not cicatrize it. How small\r\nwould be the cost of so great a victory!\r\n\r\nMay I not go one step farther. I have heard with pleasure the feelings\r\nexpressed, the references made, to the Cotton States. I have scarcely\r\nheard an unkind word said against them. We have come here to cement\r\nthe Union--to make that Union, of which gentlemen have so eloquently\r\nspoken, permanent, noble, and glorious in the future as it has been in\r\nthe past--not to be content with it as a maimed and crippled Republic.\r\n\r\nNow, eight flourishing States are practically lost to us. The crest of\r\nthe noble Mexican Gulf has separated from us. Let us exert every power\r\nwe possess to bring them all back to the fold. Why should we not?\r\nEvery motive of interest or patriotism should induce us to do so.\r\nSuppose the States were vacillating and in doubt where to go. Suppose\r\nthey were set up for sale in market _overt_, and the States of Europe\r\nwere to bid for them--for this, not only the richest portion of our\r\nown country, but of the world--because this portion of our land has an\r\nelement of wealth and power which must be prized and valued wherever\r\ncommerce is known. What would not one of the Powers of Europe give for\r\nthis favored section? The treasures of the continent would be opened.\r\nNations would unlock the caskets of their crown jewels to secure it.\r\nEngland would double her national debt to have it; so would France; so\r\nwould Russia. And yet we stand here higgling over these little\r\ndifferences which alone have caused our separation. Is it not better\r\nthat we should rise to the level of the occasion, and meet the\r\nrequisition of the times, instead of expending precious hours in the\r\ndiscussion of these miserable abstractions?\r\n\r\nWe talk about the events of the Revolution and their consequences.\r\nHave we forgotten our revolutionary history? Have we forgotten the\r\nMARIONS, the SUMTERS, the PICKENS, of those times? Has the spirit of\r\nsacrifice which, animated those men wholly departed from their\r\ndescendants? God forbid!\r\n\r\nOur body politic is not free from disease. The disease should be\r\ntreated properly and judiciously. Whenever disease shows itself we\r\nshould apply a suitable remedy--one that is suggested by the pharmacy\r\nof mutual brotherhood, and yet powerful enough to reach every nerve in\r\nour political system.\r\n\r\nIt is to accomplish this purpose that we have come together. It is to\r\nsecure this desirable result that I urge the adoption of this\r\namendment. I press it because I feel that it will give peace to all\r\nsections. Adopt it, and from that moment you may date the beginning of\r\nthe return of the seceded States into the fold of the Union. How\r\nheartily would we welcome their return! Do we not all desire it? Has\r\nnot Virginia a heart large enough to give them their old place in the\r\nUnion? Has not Rhode Island and New Jersey?\r\n\r\nI say my proposition will accomplish this, and a single reason will\r\ndisclose the ground of my faith. It preserves the equilibrium, the\r\nbalance of power, between the sections. It enables each section to\r\nappoint its own officers, to protect its own interests, to regulate\r\nits own concerns. It is fair and equal in its operations. With it, no\r\nsection can have any excuse for dissatisfaction. I pledge the united\r\nsupport of the South to the Union, if it is adopted.\r\n\r\nThe latter branch of the amendment looks to the annual distribution of\r\nthe net proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the several\r\nStates. This was one of the favorite ideas of HENRY CLAY. His argument\r\nupon this subject, to my mind, was always conclusive. Will the party\r\nwhich has adopted his principles repudiate this, or will its members\r\nput their feet down firmly and give it their support?\r\n\r\nI have watched the operations of this Government with great interest\r\nand care, and I have noticed that every approach toward making each\r\nsource of revenue or expenditure separate and independent of all\r\nothers, tended to the profit and advantage of the Government, and\r\nincreased the chances of securing honorable and honest agents to\r\ntransact its business. A marked instance of this will be found in the\r\nadministration of the affairs of the Post Office Department. And here\r\nI cannot refrain from relating an anecdote which is strongly in\r\npoint, and which forms one of the pleasantest recollections of my own\r\nconnection with the administration of the General Government.\r\n\r\nUpon a certain occasion I called my cabinet together. Sad complaints\r\nhad been made concerning the administration of several of the\r\nDepartments, and the press had not failed to predict heavy losses to\r\nthe Government through the dishonesty and the defalcations of its\r\nagents. I determined that I would know what the facts were, and I\r\ndirected all the departments to furnish me, by a certain day, with a\r\ncorrect and accurate list of all their defaulting employés, and on the\r\nsame day I summoned my cabinet to consider these reports. The lists\r\ncame in from the several Departments, and I assure the Conference that\r\nthey were formidable enough to give ample occasion for anxiety. But\r\nthe list from the Department of the Post Office was not forthcoming.\r\nMy friend, Governor WICKLIFFE, was at that time at the head of that\r\nDepartment. The day of the cabinet meeting arrived. We were all\r\nassembled but the Postmaster General. We waited for a long time for\r\nhim and for his report. At length he came, bringing his report with\r\nhim, but with the marks of great care and anxiety upon his brow. _He\r\nhad discovered a defalcation_ in his Department. He had been occupied\r\nfor a long time in tracing it out, but he had at length succeeded. He\r\ncame to announce to the President that the postmaster of a certain\r\n\"Cross Roads\" in Kentucky had absconded, and defrauded the Government\r\nout of the sum of _fifteen dollars_! and worst of all, his bail _had\r\nrun away with him_!!\r\n\r\nThis is only one of the many proofs which my own experience would\r\nfurnish of the propriety, if not the necessity of keeping each\r\nDepartment of the Government by itself--of not connecting it with\r\nothers, and of making the agents of each Department responsible to\r\nitself alone. Carry this idea into practice in all the Departments of\r\nthe Government, and a better class of agents would be secured, and the\r\nloss by defaulters would be much lessened.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase of the expenditures of the General Government\r\nmight, by the same process, be prevented. How does it happen that in a\r\ntime of peace these expenses have risen from twenty-three millions of\r\ndollars up to seventy or eighty millions? In the same proportion, the\r\nsum to which they will reach in another decade will be frightful! It\r\nis high time that a stop was put to this lavish expenditure, and\r\nespecially to the losses by dishonest agents. The plan here proposed\r\nwill give you a starting point. The proceeds of the vast domain of the\r\npublic lands are now so mingled with the other expenditures of the\r\nGovernment, that no one can tell what becomes of them. They are now\r\ncommon plunder. Divide them among the States, and they will be\r\nsaved--they will be applied to some worthy object, and you will have\r\nadopted a principle which, after a little time, under any honest\r\nadministration, will be applied to the other Departments of the\r\nGovernment. I trust the whole amendment may be adopted. As the\r\namendment may be divided into two parts--one relating to appointments\r\nto office, and the other to the public domain--I would ask that the\r\nvote may be taken upon each proposition separately.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the first portion of the amendment\r\nproposed by Mr. SEDDON, with the following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\n     Iowa--14.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--I cannot concur in the vote just given by Maryland. I\r\ndesire to have my dissent recorded.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I dissent, also, from the vote of Maryland.\r\n\r\nPresident TYLER:--The last part of the amendment will be considered as\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I move to amend the substitute proposed by Mr. FRANKLIN,\r\nby adding thereto the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"_Provided_, That nothing in this article contained shall be\r\n     so construed as to carry any law of involuntary servitude\r\n     into such Territory.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope we shall reject all such amendments. I consider\r\nthis simply procrastination.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--I wish to raise a point, a question of\r\norder. This conflicts directly with the sense of the substitute\r\nproposed. We ought not to entertain it.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon the amendment proposed by Mr. McCURDY, with\r\nthe following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, and Iowa--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois--13.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I dissent from the vote of Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I rise to inquire whether it will now be in order to\r\noffer a substitute? I have one which I wish at the proper time to\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question is now upon the adoption of a\r\nsubstitute--that offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania--to the\r\nfirst section of the article reported by the committee. I do not think\r\nany other substitute is in order at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I hope that this vote may be postponed, and I will briefly\r\nstate the reason why. I am informed that a delegation from the State\r\nof Kansas has arrived during the day, and that their credentials are\r\nnow in the hands of the appropriate committee. That committee has not\r\nyet reported, and cannot until they have a meeting after our\r\nadjournment. The credentials of three of these delegates have been\r\npresented by myself but a few minutes since. The Committee on\r\nCredentials, I am informed, will not report until Monday. I wish the\r\nyoungest State in the Union to express her opinion upon this motion. I\r\ntherefore move an adjournment.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I do not think any delay is necessary. We can let them\r\nvote on Monday.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I only wish to say a word of explanation in behalf of\r\nthe Committee on Credentials. The delay in the case of Kansas is not\r\nthe fault of that committee. The delegates themselves think it better\r\nthat the report should not be made until all the delegates arrive who\r\nare expected. The committee can report at any time.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken on the motion to adjourn, with the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and\r\n     Indiana--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri--12.\r\n\r\nSo the motion to adjourn was negatived.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question will now be taken upon the substitute of\r\nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FRANKLIN), offered for the first\r\nsection of the article reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nWhich vote being taken, resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois--14.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Missouri--4.\r\n\r\nAnd the substitute was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--There seems to be a misapprehension as to the proper time\r\nfor offering substitutes for the whole report of the committee. I\r\nshall act upon the understanding that the proper time to offer them\r\nwill be when we have gone through with the report of the committee. If\r\nI am wrong I wish to be corrected now.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I am informed that Mr. LINCOLN, the President-elect, has\r\narrived in this city. I feel certain that the Conference would desire\r\nto treat him with the same measure of respect which it has extended to\r\nthe present incumbent of that high office. I therefore move that the\r\nPresident of this Convention be requested to call upon the\r\nPresident-elect of the United States, and inform him that its members\r\nwould be pleased to wait upon him in a body at such time as will suit\r\nhis convenience, and that this Convention be advised of the result.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. LOGAN was agreed to unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I move an adjournment to half-past seven o'clock this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to, and the Conference adjourned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION--SIXTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SATURDAY, _February 23d, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order by the President, at half-past\r\nseven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I have addressed a note to the President-elect,\r\nannouncing the desire of the Conference to offer their respects to him\r\nin a body, at seven and one-half o'clock this evening, or at such\r\nother time as would be agreeable to him. I have received his reply,\r\nstating that he will be pleased to receive the members of this body at\r\nnine o'clock this evening, or at any other time which may suit their\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Conference then proceeded to the order of the day, being the\r\nconsideration of the second article of the section reported by the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move to strike out the second article, and to insert\r\nthe following in its place:\r\n\r\n     \"Territory may be acquired for naval and commercial stations\r\n     and transit routes, and by discovery, and for no other\r\n     purposes, without the concurrence of four-fifths of the\r\n     Senate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that under our present Constitution the\r\nUnited States have no power to acquire territory for coaling or naval\r\nstations, within the country of a foreign power. It was the\r\ncommittee's intention to remedy this defect by the present section.\r\nBut as it stands, I do not like it. The idea is somewhat awkwardly\r\nexpressed. I wish to have the enabling power conferred in direct\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I would ask to interrupt the order of business for a\r\nmoment, in order to make a report from the Committee on Credentials,\r\nin the Kansas case. The defect adverted to in the case of Mr. STONE,\r\nhas been supplied to the satisfaction of the committee, and Messrs.\r\nCONWAY, EWING, and ADAMS, have also presented themselves as delegates\r\nfrom the State of Kansas, with proper credentials. It has not been our\r\npractice heretofore to admit members by a formal vote, nor do I see\r\nany necessity for making the case of Kansas an exception. The\r\ncommittee would suggest that the clerk enter the names of these\r\ngentlemen upon the roll of delegates, unless objection is made.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Secretary will make the entry, as no objection is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--Some days ago I introduced into the Conference, and\r\ncaused to be printed, a substitute which I proposed to offer for the\r\nsecond section of the committee's article. I offer it now, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"No territory shall be acquired by the United States without\r\n     the concurrence of a majority of all the Senators from\r\n     States which allow involuntary servitude, and a majority of\r\n     all the Senators from States which prohibit that relation;\r\n     nor shall territory be acquired by treaty, unless the votes\r\n     of a majority of the Senators from each class of States\r\n     hereinbefore mentioned, be cast as a part of the two-thirds\r\n     majority necessary to the satisfaction of such treaty.\"\r\n\r\nI do not propose to occupy time in discussing it, but I ask a minute\r\nor two to explain its provisions. The second section of the article\r\nproposed by the committee, requires that a treaty under which\r\nterritory or commercial or naval stations is acquired, should require\r\nfour-fifths of the Senate for its ratification. This, I think, is an\r\nunnecessary restriction upon the treaty-making power. Occasion may\r\narise when it would not be advisable to wait for the exercise of this\r\npower at all. The question of acquiring territory may arise under\r\ncircumstances when delay would be fatal. Suppose our title to an\r\nisland in the Arctic Ocean, or a point upon the shore, by discovery or\r\notherwise, which might be settled by prompt action! There might be no\r\nnational authority with which we could treat for its acquisition. I\r\nthink it would be hazardous to provide that in no event should\r\nterritory be acquired except by treaty. The case I have supposed has\r\nno relation whatever to the case of an ordinary acquisition of\r\nterritory by treaty with a recognized foreign power.\r\n\r\nBut the question of slavery always arises when the subject of\r\nacquiring territory is mentioned. This clause would fix the _status_,\r\nwould put it in the power of either class of States to prevent the\r\nacquisition, but it would not permit a small number of States to do\r\nit. To leave it where a _majority_ of the Senators of both sections\r\ncould control the subject, would seem to me the mode of settlement\r\nleast objectionable. The ratification would require two-thirds of the\r\nSenate, like all treaties, and these two-thirds would include a\r\nmajority of both sections.\r\n\r\nObjection will be made to this classification of the States. I do not\r\nlike it myself, but there it no way to avoid it. I have adopted the\r\nlanguage of the Ordinance of 1787. There can be no very sound\r\nobjection to the use of these terms. The objection is rather\r\nsentimental than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe amendment I offer ought to satisfy the South, and I think it will.\r\nThe South asks for these provisions because they settle all questions\r\nabout our present territory, and prevent questions arising over that\r\nwe may acquire hereafter. They will give to both sides equality of\r\npower. But voting is far more important now than speaking. I will\r\nconsume no more time.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The gentleman from Virginia desires to try his motion.\r\nFor the present, I will withdraw mine.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I have only a word to say on this subject. There are very\r\ngrave objections to this classification of sections. I will not repeat\r\nthem here. I supposed the sense of the Conference had been expressed\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nBut I wish to inquire why this second section is necessary at all? It\r\ncame up in the committee rather by accident than otherwise. I do not\r\nthink any one of the committee intended to make it one of the subjects\r\nof our action, and the section was finally presented by a small\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nLet us leave this subject where the Constitution leaves it. We can now\r\nacquire territory by discovery or by treaty. So far the Constitution\r\nhas operated satisfactorily. The country owes much of its greatness to\r\nthis very provision of the Constitution. No grievance to the South,\r\nassuredly, has been caused by it. I am much averse to any alteration.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I think, after some reflection, that this amendment is\r\nof much more importance than many of us have supposed. I shall vote\r\nfor it, because I do not wish to have too many limitations placed upon\r\nthe power of the Government in relation to the acquisition of\r\nterritory. We know how difficult it is to change our fundamental law.\r\nVery few amendments to the Constitution have been made since the death\r\nof WASHINGTON. We are now establishing our fundamental law for ages to\r\ncome. Is there upon the face of the civilized earth a nation with\r\nsuch a limitation upon the power of acquiring territory as this\r\noriginal article proposes? Its adoption would place us at the feet of\r\nforeign nations.\r\n\r\nIn war, conquest is one means of indemnity--often the best and only\r\none. We must look to the acquisition of future territory; we must make\r\nour settlement with that in view.\r\n\r\nReference has been made here to the seceded States, and some hard\r\nwords have been used toward them. This is not the place for such\r\nwords. What is the condition of these States now? They say they are\r\nout of the Union. We say, No! The question between us may be decided\r\nby the Courts; it may be decided by the sword. But we all want them\r\nback; we would place no restrictions upon their return. They will only\r\ncome back by treaty. Unless you adopt this amendment, the section\r\nproposed will be applicable to their case, and a mere fraction could\r\nkeep them out of the Union forever.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the subject of slavery, what we want is security for the\r\nfuture. That we can arrange. In my opinion you will never get back the\r\nseceded States, without you give them some hope of the acquisition of\r\nfuture territory. They know that when slavery is gathered into a\r\n_cul-de-sac_, and surrounded by a wall of free States, it is\r\ndestroyed. Slavery must have expansion. It must expand by the\r\nacquisition of territory which now we do not own. The seceded States\r\nwill never yield this point--will never come back to a Government\r\nwhich gives no chance for the expansion of their principal\r\ninstitution. They will insist upon equity, upon the same rights with\r\nyou in the common territory, and the same prospect, of acquiring\r\nforeign territory that you have. If you are not prepared to grant all\r\nthis, do not waste your time in thought about the return of the\r\nseceded States.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--New Jersey voted to make the first section of the\r\narticle reported applicable to future territory, not because she\r\nwishes to acquire new territory, but because she knows that it will be\r\nacquired; and she believes all questions raised here can be settled\r\nnow, in regard to it, better than they can be hereafter. These\r\nquestions have raised a ferment in the nation; we would settle them\r\nany way. We should have voted for these restrictions upon the power of\r\nacquiring territory; and still we cannot shut our eyes to the fact\r\nthat in a few years new territory must be acquired. Look at Sonora, at\r\nall Mexico; they furnish the reason for our action. An effort will be\r\nmade, perhaps, to secure the new territory by treaty. Better get it in\r\nthat way than by conquest.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would oppose any farther acquisitions. We need no more\r\nterritory, and yet I know that more will be acquired. The North wishes\r\nit more than the South. In the end, the North will insist that we\r\nshould have Cuba. What is the sentiment of our commercial cities now?\r\n\r\nI think we ought to surround this power of acquisition by some\r\njudicious restrictions; not make them too strong, or the country will\r\nbreak over, and not regard them. What restriction would not have been\r\nbroken down, when the question came up in relation to Texas? We must\r\nanticipate occasions of the same kind. I am inclined to vote for the\r\nsubstitute of the gentleman from Virginia. At all events let us adopt\r\nsome limitations. If not these, then such as are contained in the\r\noriginal article.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Maryland:--I propose to amend the substitute offered\r\nby the gentleman from Virginia, by inserting after the words \"United\r\nStates,\" the words \"except by discovery, and for naval and commercial\r\ndepots and transit routes.\"\r\n\r\nThere is now a law, the constitutionality of which has not been\r\ndoubted, providing for the acquisition of territory by discovery. But\r\nthe Court, in the Dred Scott case, decided that territory could not be\r\nacquired, except as preliminary to the formation of a State. This\r\ndifficulty should be obviated. I think the amendment I propose will do\r\nit. If we adopt the proposition of Mr. SUMMERS, we cut off the power\r\nof acquiring territory for transit routes, &c., except by treaty. I\r\nthink my amendment will make the section more satisfactory to the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I will accept the amendment, and treat it as a part of\r\nmy substitute.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I feel a deep solicitude in this subject. We are\r\nhere for the purpose of settling a great difficulty. Instead of\r\nsettling it, we shall add to it by placing these unnecessary\r\nobstructions in the way of acquiring territory in future. Would not\r\nthe South be safer by the adoption of this guarantee? It is the only\r\none, aside from the first section, which gives the South a grain of\r\npower. We cannot go on with things as they are--only seven States to\r\ncontend with all the rest of the nation. We must all desire that the\r\nseceded States should return to the Union. How are they to come back?\r\nBy treaty, or by the sword? Who will not prefer to win them back by\r\nadopting principles in our amendments which will make it for their\r\ninterest to return? If the amendment is adopted, no future territory\r\nwill be acquired without the consent of a majority of Senators on both\r\nsides of the line. Reject this, and I have not the slightest hope of\r\never seeing the seceded States again in the Union. I believe this\r\namendment will meet the wishes of a large majority of the people of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the adoption of the substitute proposed by Mr. SUMMERS\r\nresulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I will now renew my proposition, and ask a vote upon it\r\nby States.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the substitute offered by Mr. GUTHRIE, for the section\r\nof the article reported by the committee, resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Ohio--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia,\r\n     North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE dissented from the vote of New Jersey, and Mr. BARRINGER\r\nfrom the vote of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--As the hour named for the call upon the\r\nPresident-elect is approaching, I move that a committee of three\r\nmembers be appointed by the President to make arrangements for the\r\nintroduction of the members of the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to, and the President appointed\r\nMessrs. WICKLIFFE, FIELD, and CHASE, as the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENNAN:--I move a reconsideration of the vote of the Conference\r\nrejecting the substitute offered by the gentleman from Virginia. I am\r\nnot at all certain that we may not think it advisable to adopt that\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe order of the day was now suspended, and the committee appointed to\r\nwait upon the President-elect, reported that they had performed that\r\nduty, and that the President-elect would be pleased to receive the\r\nmembers of the Conference in his parlors in Willard's Hotel, at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of waiting on the President, on motion of Mr. EWING,\r\nthe Conference adjourned until the 25th inst., at ten o'clock A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 25th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order at ten o'clock, pursuant to\r\nadjournment, by President TYLER, and prayer was offered by Rev. Dr.\r\nSMITH.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of Saturday was read.\r\n\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN:--The Delegates from the State of Indiana desire that\r\nthe vote of that State upon the proposition of amendment offered by\r\nthe gentleman from Iowa (Mr. CURTIS), on Friday last, may be recorded.\r\nThe vote was taken on Saturday, and Indiana desires to record her vote\r\nagainst said proposition.\r\n\r\nThe Conference granted the leave asked, and the vote of Indiana was\r\naccordingly entered upon the Journal.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--There have been transmitted to me the proceedings of a\r\nmeeting of the Democrats of Pennsylvania, in which are contained\r\ncertain resolutions relating to the matters now before us. I am\r\ninformed that the meeting was one of the largest ever held in that\r\nState. The usual course would be to enter them upon the record, but in\r\nthis instance I would suggest the propriety of having them read.\r\nHowever, the Conference will take such order upon them as it thinks\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--The policy of the Conference from the beginning has been\r\nnot to receive or consider resolutions of a partisan character. That\r\ndecision was made on one of the early days of our session, upon a\r\nseries of resolutions adopted by a convention held in New Haven,\r\nConnecticut, which were presented by Mr. CLAY. I think we had better\r\npass over the subject informally, and I would call for the order of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--I think the resolutions had better be\r\nreferred to the Committee on Credentials.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I quite approved of the course taken by the Conference of\r\nthe resolutions which were sent to me for presentation. I hope we will\r\npursue the same course now. I move that these resolutions be entered\r\nupon the Journal as received, and that they be laid on the table.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CLAY was agreed to, and the resolutions were laid on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH, of New York:--I would inquire whether any action has been\r\ntaken under the order of the Conference for the printing of the\r\nJournal from day to day. It is very important that we have these\r\nJournals, that we may know exactly what has been done. No gentleman\r\ncan carry all our proceedings in his memory.\r\n\r\n     The Secretary made a statement to the effect that he had not\r\n     found time fully to complete the Journal, or to arrange for\r\n     its being printed under the rule requiring that secrecy\r\n     should be preserved; that the Mayor of Washington had\r\n     proposed to have the printing done under a supervision which\r\n     would secure its non-publication by the press, and that\r\n     various reasons existed why the order of the Conference had\r\n     not been complied with.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--Then I hope the order will be complied with to-day. It is\r\nvery important that each member should have a copy of our daily\r\nJournal. I certainly expected one this morning. I will not make a\r\nmotion now, but if these copies are not furnished, I shall move the\r\nappointment of a committee to secure their future publication.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--There was a vote passed upon this subject. It may have been\r\nin the absence of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference is informed that the Journal shall be\r\npublished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I have two amendments which I shall offer. At\r\npresent I desire to have them laid on the table and printed.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: I suppose these amendments offered by Mr. BROCKENBROUGH\r\nwere never printed; certainly no printed copy of them was ever\r\ndistributed to the members of the Conference, and they were never\r\ninserted in the Journal. In preserving my notes, I naturally assumed\r\nthat I could rely upon the printed copies distributed to the members,\r\nfor the various amendments offered. At the period of writing out these\r\nnotes communication with Mr. BROCKENBROUGH is impossible, and I am\r\nobliged to omit farther notice of his amendments. I am not even able\r\nto state the subjects to which they referred.]\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the consideration\r\nof the order of the day, which is the motion to reconsider the vote\r\nrejecting the substitute offered by Mr. SUMMERS, for the second\r\nsection of the articles of amendment reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. McKENNAN:--At the request of one of my colleagues I would ask a\r\npostponement of the vote upon my motion of reconsideration for the\r\npresent. It will produce no injurious result, and I think myself we\r\nhad better hold this amendment subject to the future action of the\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I will not withhold my consent to the postponement. But\r\nI hope the members of this Conference will consider my amendment, and\r\ngive it their attention when it comes up again.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--If we pass Mr. SUMMERS' amendment, we should pass by the\r\nconsideration of the whole section. I think that is the better way.\r\nLet us now proceed to the consideration of the third section in the\r\narticle of amendment proposed by the committee.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--Such will be taken as the pleasure of the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe third section was read.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The third section is open to propositions of\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move to amend this section by striking out the words\r\n\"by land, sea, or river,\" occurring after the words \"or\r\ntransportation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE'S motion was adopted without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I now move to insert after the words \"during\r\ntransportation,\" the words \"by sea or river.\"\r\n\r\nWhich motion was also agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I now move to amend the third section by striking out\r\nall after the word \"give,\" in the second line thereof, and inserting\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"to Congress power to regulate, abolish, or control, within\r\n     any State, the relations established or recognized by the\r\n     laws thereof, touching persons held to service or labor\r\n     therein.\"\r\n\r\n     SECTION 4. Congress shall have no power to discharge any\r\n     person held to service or labor in the District of Columbia,\r\n     under the laws thereof, from such service or labor, or to\r\n     impair any rights pertaining to that relation, under the\r\n     laws now in force within the said District, while such\r\n     relations shall exist in the State of Maryland, without the\r\n     consent of said State, and of those to whom the service or\r\n     labor is due, or making them just compensation therefor; nor\r\n     the power to prohibit or interfere with members of Congress\r\n     and officers of the Federal Government whose duties require\r\n     them to be in said District, from bringing with them, for\r\n     personal service only, retaining, and taking away persons so\r\n     held to service or labor, nor the power to impair or abolish\r\n     the relations of persons owing service or labor in places\r\n     under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\r\n     within those States and Territories where such relations are\r\n     established or recognized by law.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 5. Congress shall have no power to prohibit the\r\n     removal or transportation of persons held to service or\r\n     labor in any State or Territory of the United States to any\r\n     State or Territory thereof where the same obligation or\r\n     liability to labor or service is established or recognized\r\n     by law; and the right during such transportation, by sea or\r\n     river, of touching at ports, shores, or landings, and of\r\n     landing in case of distress, shall exist; nor shall the\r\n     Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\n     on persons held to service or labor than on land.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be strictly in order, yet, as a part of my plan, I\r\nwish to bring forward a substitute which I shall offer to the seventh\r\nsection of the committee's article, which, if adopted, should be\r\nnumbered\r\n\r\n     SECTION 9. Congress shall provide by law, that in all cases\r\n     where the Marshal, or other officer whose duty it shall be\r\n     to arrest any fugitive from service or labor, shall be\r\n     prevented from so doing by violence of a mob or riotous\r\n     assemblage; or where, after such arrest, such fugitive shall\r\n     be rescued by like violence, and the party to whom such\r\n     service or labor is due shall thereby be deprived of the\r\n     same, the United States shall pay to such party the full\r\n     value of such service or labor.\r\n\r\nI offer these in separate sections, in order not only that the vote\r\nmay be taken upon each one separately here, but also when the same\r\nquestions come before the people. The first section of my amendment,\r\nas I understand from every quarter, sets all opposition at rest; all\r\nare willing to agree to it. This may be adopted and the others\r\nrejected, which could not be done if the original section was adopted.\r\nThe other sections conform to the language of our present\r\nConstitution, and for that reason I think they will meet with more\r\nfavor. Each subject is thus made to stand on its own merits.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question will be taken upon each section of the\r\nsubstitute proposed.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--I propose the following as a substitute for the first\r\nsection of the amendment offered by Mr. HITCHCOCK. It is, I believe,\r\nthe same as that proposed in Congress by the Committee of Thirteen. I\r\nunderstand, also, that the Committee of the House of Representatives\r\nare about to substitute it for what is known as the ADAMS Proposition.\r\nWe all have the same purpose in view, to negative in express terms the\r\nright of Congress to interfere with the institution of slavery within\r\nthe States. I present the amendment because I think it expresses the\r\npurpose in better language.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. No amendment shall be made to the Constitution\r\n     which will authorize or give to Congress the power to\r\n     abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic\r\n     institutions thereof, including that of persons held to\r\n     labor or service by the laws of said State.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--This amendment would be limited in its application to the\r\nStates. Congress would still have power in this respect over\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The report of the committee has been agreed upon after\r\nmuch discussion, and printed. We all understand it, and I hope we\r\nshall adhere to it without any alteration. If we begin to adopt these\r\namendments no one can tell where they will carry us.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--My proposition is offered as an amendment to that offered\r\nby Mr. HITCHCOCK.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--So I understand; but his amendment is proposed as a\r\nsubstitute for the third section of the article reported by the\r\ncommittee. I object to the whole of it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--Do I understand that the question now is upon\r\nsubstituting Mr. HITCHCOCK'S amendment for the committee's report.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--No. It is upon substituting my proposition for the first\r\nsection of Mr. HITCHCOCK'S amendment.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the amendment offered by Mr. JAMES resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, and Indiana--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, and Kansas--13.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. WOOD:--I must enter my dissent from the vote of Illinois.\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--I have an amendment which I offer to the substitute\r\nproposed by Mr. HITCHCOCK--\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I object to it as out of order. Let us take the vote\r\nupon the various sections of Mr. HITCHCOCK'S proposition. If they are\r\nrejected, then these amendments may all be moved to the committee's\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I have already decided that the substitute is open to\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--Then I will appeal from the decision of the Chair.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I will state the ground of my decision. It is true, as\r\nclaimed by the gentleman from New Jersey, that if the propositions of\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK are _rejected_ these amendments may be moved to the\r\nsections reported by the committee. If, on the contrary, they are\r\n_adopted_, or either of them, so far as they are adopted they must\r\nstand as the order of the Conference, and are no longer subject to\r\namendment. I understand the Parliamentary rule in such a case to be\r\nwell settled.\r\n\r\nA somewhat confused debate here arose, when Mr. RANDOLPH withdrew his\r\nappeal from the decision of the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I move to amend the proposition of the gentleman from\r\nOhio, by striking out the words \"nor shall Congress have the power to\r\nauthorize any higher rate of taxation on persons held to service or\r\nlabor, than on land.\" I do not think these words are appropriate in a\r\nprovision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I supposed the Conference would understand my purpose.\r\nIt was to substitute my three sections for the third section of the\r\ncommittee's report. I did not suppose this series of amendments would\r\nbe offered. For the present, I will withdraw my amendments.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS:--The gentleman forgets that if we once adopt them, they\r\nare no longer subject to amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I wish to make a suggestion. I don't know but\r\nParliamentarians would call it a point of order. Now let us go on and\r\ndecide whether we will, or will not, adopt the third section as\r\nreported by the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I have several amendments which I am constrained to offer\r\nto this third section. My State would think me remiss if I did not\r\noffer them. I move, first, to insert after the words \"State or\r\nTerritory of the United States,\" the words \"or obstruct, hinder,\r\nprevent, or abolish.\"\r\n\r\nBy the section as reported by the committee, Congress is prohibited\r\nfrom controlling or abolishing slavery in any State or Territory. This\r\namendment which I propose will prevent any action in relation to\r\nit--in aid of it, or otherwise. The Territorial Legislature will\r\nalways be the creature of Congress, and under the committee's section\r\nit might act upon the subject of slavery. I understand that the\r\npurpose of the committee was to prevent Congress from abolishing\r\nslavery in the Territories, but not to prevent the Territorial\r\nLegislature from acting in aid of it. My amendment will secure slavery\r\nfrom all interference. That is what we want.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The first section of the report covers this. The\r\namendment, I think, is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I think the first section, properly construed, would\r\nprevent the Territorial Legislature from enacting a law in aid of\r\nslavery, even if the whole people of the Territory desired it.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I do not desire to go over these questions again. If the\r\nConference intends to come to any conclusion at all, I hope it will\r\nvote down all these amendments.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I call for a vote by States.\r\n\r\nMr. WOOD:--I move that the amendment be laid on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--Which motion is in order--mine or that of the gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The gentleman from Ohio having withdrawn his\r\namendment, the proposal of the gentleman from Connecticut is no longer\r\nbefore the Conference. The question is upon the motion of the\r\ngentleman from Virginia to amend the third section of the article\r\nreported by the committee.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the amendment proposed by Mr. SEDDON resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\n     Kentucky, and Missouri--6.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky--14.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was not adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I now move to amend the third section reported by the\r\ncommittee, by striking out the words \"City of Washington,\" and\r\ninserting in their place the words \"District of Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. SEDDON was agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I do not see why this privilege of bringing their\r\nslaves into the District should be limited to members of Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--It is not. The expression is \"representatives and\r\n_others_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I now propose to amend the same section by inserting\r\nafter the words \"without the consent of Maryland\" the words \"and\r\nVirginia.\" I think slavery ought not to be destroyed in the District\r\nof Columbia without the consent both of Maryland and Virginia. If\r\nthere is any reason for requiring the consent of one State, the same\r\nreason exists as to the other. This amendment will make the section\r\nmuch more acceptable to the slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The committee did not require the assent of Virginia,\r\nbecause no part of the present District came from Virginia. We thought\r\nit unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--Maryland and Virginia originally joined in the cession of\r\nthe District to the United States. Afterwards that portion which came\r\nfrom her was re-ceded to Virginia. But this question is not one of\r\nterritory alone. The policy and interest of the two States are\r\nintimately connected. It would be far more satisfactory to both these\r\nStates, and to the South, if the assent of Virginia was required\r\nbefore Congress could abolish slavery in the District. Still Maryland\r\ndoes not insist upon it.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I can see no necessity for, or propriety in, the\r\namendment. We might as well require the consent of North Carolina or\r\nany of the other slave States. Virginia owns none of the District. She\r\nhas no right to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe amendment proposed by Mr. SEDDON was rejected by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\n     Missouri--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Kansas--14.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--My next proposition is to amend the third section by\r\ninserting after the words \"landing in case of distress, shall exist,\"\r\nthe words \"and if the transportation be by sea, the right of property\r\nin the person held to service or labor shall be protected by the\r\nFederal Government as other property.\"\r\n\r\nWe claim that our property in slaves shall be recognized by the Union\r\njust like any other property--that no unjust or improper distinction\r\nshall be made. When we trust it to the perils of the seas, we wish to\r\nhave it protected by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I would inquire of the gentleman from Virginia whether\r\nit has not already been decided that this species of property is as\r\nmuch entitled to Federal protection as any other. I refer to the\r\n\"Creole\" case. The British Government made compensation for this\r\nspecies of property in that case. This was done upon the award of the\r\ncommissioners pursuant to the decision of the umpire.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Yes! But on the express ground that slavery was\r\nrecognized in the islands. Express notice was given, that when the\r\nemancipation policy was adopted, the same principles would not be\r\nrecognized. We are now removing doubts. We wish to have these matters\r\nno longer involved in uncertainty. We insist upon having these\r\nprovisions in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I wish to say a word on this subject, much as I regret\r\nthe consumption of time. I am willing to leave this question where it\r\nis now; and my reason is this: If we put this into the Constitution,\r\nthe question may be raised, whether if foreign nations should\r\ninterfere with this kind of property on the high seas, the Government\r\nwould not be bound to consider it a cause of war. We ought not to bind\r\nourselves to go to war. War should always depend upon considerations\r\nof policy. We should raise a thousand troublesome questions by\r\nputting these words \"shall be protected\" into the Constitution. The\r\nmatter is well enough as it is. Our rights in this respect are well\r\nenough protected by the ordinary course of national diplomacy. I would\r\nnot be willing to put into the Constitution language which would\r\nembarrass us hereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I will frankly say that I think slave property upon every\r\nground is as well entitled to the national protection as any other\r\nspecies of property.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--This amendment brings up the very gist of the matter.\r\nThe question of the right of our property to Federal protection is now\r\nan open one. In the case of the Creole it was settled by negotiation,\r\nand not by the courts. The question so often hinted at and suggested\r\nin this Conference is now fairly brought up for decision. Governor\r\nCHASE struck at the very root of the matter the other day, when he\r\nsaid that slavery was an _abnormal_ condition. He laid down the\r\nopinion of the North. He is a statesman and a lawyer. He says that\r\nslavery cannot exist anywhere until it is established or authorized by\r\nlaw. This is the Northern idea, and it is a technical one. I hate\r\ntechnicalities almost as bad as I do sectionalism. The North deals in\r\nboth. I regret to speak in these terms of the North, but I must if I\r\nspeak truth. Now, I will lay down what is the opinion of the South\r\nupon the subject. We say that the right to hold and use slave\r\nproperty, always, everywhere, exists until it is prohibited by law. We\r\nsay that it is a natural right, which grows out of the very\r\nnecessities of society. We hold that the condition of slavery is a\r\nnormal condition--not local at all; that it is found everywhere,\r\nexcept where it is forbidden by law. We claim that the right to hold\r\nslaves is a natural right, recognized by the law of nations, and of\r\nthe world. I am quite aware that the North does not agree with our\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I would ask whether this normal condition is confined\r\nto the blacks, or does it extend to all races?\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--Most assuredly it is not confined to a single race. It\r\nextends to all races. Slavery of all races exists even in Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Not now!\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--Perhaps not now, and why? For the reason that it has\r\nbeen abolished by law, as in the recent case of Russia. Slavery once\r\nexisted in the Northern States. By law it was also abolished in those\r\nStates. We say that when slave property is on the high seas it ought\r\nto be protected--the rights of the owner ought to be protected.\r\n\r\nThis question came up in the case of the \"Amistead.\" Mr. ADAMS claimed\r\nthat although these slaves were recognized by the laws of Spain as\r\nproperty, yet, when once upon the high seas, they were, by the law of\r\nnations, _free_, and these slaves have never been paid for to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis amendment is highly important to the South. The concession we ask\r\nis no greater than has been made before. In the treaties of 1783 and\r\n1815, slaves were to be protected as property.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I do not wish to nullify the action, or change the\r\ncourse of our Government on this question. Slaves upon the high seas\r\nhave always been recognized as property. Look at the treaty of 1815.\r\nThat recognized slaves as property, and those which were taken from\r\nthe District were paid for. ADAMS, of Massachusetts, took the same\r\nground now taken by the North. The Government took the opposite\r\nground. The question was ultimately referred to the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwho decided that property in slaves must be recognized by the law of\r\nnations, and sustained our view. Take the \"Creole\" case also. But I\r\nwill not go over the ground. The \"Amistead\" case stood upon grounds\r\nwhich were entirely different.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to put this amendment into the Constitution.\r\nThe rights of the South in this respect are well enough protected now.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--I regret that the distinguished gentleman from Virginia\r\nhas again raised a question which was decided against him by a large\r\nmajority in the Conference a few days ago.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The gentleman is quite correct. The principle must be the\r\nsame whether applied to the Territories or to the high seas.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--It is claimed by the South that slaves are property\r\neverywhere. Why, then, name slave property more than any other species\r\nin the Constitution?\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--We say that slaves are _both_ persons and property.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--It has always been the course of the Government to pay\r\nfor slaves taken on the high seas. The gentleman has referred to the\r\n\"Amistead\" case as having been decided against the southern claim. I\r\npresent the \"Amistead\" case as a perfect answer to the miserable\r\ncalumnies which have been disseminated against that Court. The Judges\r\nin that case were unanimous with a single exception, and he was a\r\nJudge from a free State. We of the North upon these national questions\r\nare prepared to go with you to the extreme verge of right and loyalty.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I have no desire to complicate these\r\nquestions of international law. The treaties of 1783 and 1815 were\r\nparticipated in by JAY and the elder ADAMS. They expressly provided\r\nfor the payment for slaves like other property. This is plain English,\r\nand settles the question so far as the North is concerned. I am for\r\nletting it alone where it is.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I am not able to support this proposition of the\r\ngentleman from Virginia. I consider the right of property in slaves,\r\nin the slave States, and in the territory south of 36° 30´, as fully\r\nrecognized and established in the report of the majority of the\r\ncommittee. In this very clause this property is expressly admitted,\r\nand Congress is prohibited from interfering with it. This is\r\nenough--it is all that should be done. We have come here to settle our\r\ndomestic troubles. The report of the committee recognizes and affirms\r\nthese rights of the South which have heretofore been denied or\r\ndoubted. I think their report gives us all the assurance we need. We\r\nwere not sent here to engraft new principles into our foreign policy,\r\nand I will not consent to enter upon that business. We have got this\r\nright of property specifically recognized, and no administration\r\nhereafter will refuse to carry out the plain provisions of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--Where in the article do you find this right recognized?\r\nIt simply prohibits Congress from interfering with slavery within\r\ncertain limits. Nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I find the recognition pervading the whole report. The\r\nright of transportation, for instance, is secured. Does not that\r\ninvolve, of necessity, a recognition of the right of property? I am\r\nsure the South is safe in leaving this question where the report\r\nleaves it.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--We feel disposed to adhere firmly to the report of the\r\ncommittee. We know the arduous labor they have bestowed upon the\r\nsubject, and feel that we ought to be satisfied with the result. We do\r\nnot wish to have our friends put us in a false position. We shall vote\r\nagainst the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia, not because we\r\ndo not think it is right on principle, but because we think it is\r\nunnecessary. The right of property in slaves is protected now wherever\r\nthat property goes.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I admit that the policy of the Government hitherto has\r\nbeen as the gentlemen claim. If the South could have been satisfied\r\nwith that, we should never have been sent here--this Convention would\r\nnever have been called. But we have come together for the reason that\r\nwe fear the established policy of the Government will be changed by\r\nthe party now coming into power. We ask for assurances that the old\r\npolicy should be continued; and we wish to have the obligation to\r\ncontinue it, written down in the bond.\r\n\r\nThe Chair restated the question, and Mr. SEDDON called for a vote by\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon Mr. SEDDON'S amendment resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Missouri--4.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,\r\n     and Kansas--17.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMessrs. BUTLER and CLAY, of Kentucky; Messrs. DONIPHAN and JOHNSON, of\r\nMissouri; Messrs. HOWARD and DENT, of Maryland, dissented from the\r\nvotes of their respective States.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I now move the following amendment of the same third\r\nsection. After the words \"in case of distress, shall exist,\" insert\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     \"And the rights of transit by persons holding those of the\r\n     African race to labor or service, in and through the States\r\n     not recognizing the relations of persons held to labor or\r\n     service, in passing with them from one State or Territory\r\n     recognizing such relation, to another, shall be secure.\"\r\n\r\nI only wish to say in reference to this amendment that it secures a\r\nright specifically referred to in the resolutions of Virginia under\r\nwhich this Conference is called. On that account I feel bound to\r\noffer it, but I will not occupy time in its discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--In the early years of our Government this right was\r\nextended by courtesy to the slaveholding States. Since these\r\ndifferences have sprung up, in some States it has been denied--in\r\nothers, the courtesy still exists. We considered this question\r\nthoroughly in committee. We did not wish to put any thing into our\r\nreport that would operate to excite the prejudices of any section\r\nagainst it, and so lessen the chances of its being adopted. We thought\r\nit best not to insert such a provision. I am opposed to the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I call a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe amendment proposed by Mr. SEDDON was rejected by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Missouri--4.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n     Iowa, and Kansas--17.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--One more amendment. I move to amend the third section as\r\nfollows: after the words \"by the laws thereof touching,\" insert the\r\nwords \"the relations existing between master and slave or.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not detain the Conference for five minutes in the discussion\r\nof this amendment. I wish, however, to have the words \"master and\r\nslave\" somewhere inserted in this article, in plain English language,\r\nso that the dangerous delusion so prevalent at the North, that the\r\nConstitution does not recognize slavery, may be thoroughly and forever\r\nremoved; so that the Constitution shall, beyond any question,\r\nrecognize the relation of master and slave; a duplex relation--a\r\nrelation of person and property. I wish to meet that question fairly\r\nand squarely. Let it be thoroughly understood as a relation of person\r\nand property. This is what we ask, and this is what we insist upon.\r\nPut this into the Constitution, and you take the shortest and the most\r\neffective means of settling the question, and of promoting peace and\r\ntranquillity. You strike the axe to the very root of bitterness,\r\nwhence has sprung all our trouble, all our difficulties. I ask a vote\r\nby States.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--What I have already said applies with equal force to\r\nthis amendment. I will not repeat my objections.\r\n\r\nThe amendment offered by Mr. SEDDON was rejected by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, North Carolina, and Missouri--3.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas--18.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--Maryland votes \"No,\" not because she specially objects\r\nto the amendment, but she stands by the report of the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I dissent from the vote of Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--And I from the vote of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER:--[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The published Journal states that Mr. ALEXANDER dissented\r\nfrom the vote of New Jersey. My notes do not show that he dissented,\r\nand I think the Journal may be erroneous in this particular.]\r\n\r\nMr. HALL, of Vermont:--I move to amend the third section by striking\r\nout the word \"nor,\" immediately succeeding the words \"persons so bound\r\nto labor,\" and inserting the following:\r\n\r\n     \"But the bringing into said District of persons held to\r\n     service, for the purpose of being sold, or placed in depot\r\n     to be afterwards transferred to any other place to be sold\r\n     as merchandise, is forever prohibited, and Congress may pass\r\n     all necessary laws to make this prohibition effectual; nor\r\n     shall Congress have.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that much of the agitation upon the question of\r\nslavery has formerly arisen from the existence of the slave-trade in\r\nthe District of Columbia. Since the prohibition of 1850, the public\r\nmind has been much more quiet, so far as this subject is concerned. I\r\nsuppose the committee did not intend to change the law of 1850, but I\r\nfear their action will not be so understood at the North. I propose to\r\nmake the matter clear. [Mr. HALL here read the section of the Act of\r\n1850 referring to this subject.] My amendment puts the language of\r\nthis act into the Constitution. My only purpose is, to have this\r\nquestion left in exactly its present position. Without the amendment,\r\nI fear it will be claimed that the article restores the slave-trade in\r\nthis District. Nothing would more effectually destroy the article at\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE:--The language of the report is clear. It gives no right to\r\nsell slaves in the District.\r\n\r\nMr. HALL:--I wish to be understood. The article prohibits Congress\r\nfrom interfering with slavery. _Ergo_, it will be claimed they cannot\r\nprohibit the exercise of any of its functions. The construction, to\r\nsay the very least, will be doubtful. It should not be left in doubt.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--The slave-trade in the District of Columbia has always\r\nbeen a subject of great dissatisfaction. I don't know that it is\r\nconsidered of much importance in the South, but at the North it always\r\nhas been. Ten years ago it was abolished by act of Congress. I fear\r\nthat unless the amendment of the gentleman from Vermont is adopted,\r\nthe effect of the committee's report will be to restore the\r\nslave-trade in the District. The section reported by the committee\r\npermits any person to bring his slaves into the District; to retain\r\nthem there as long as he chooses, and to take them away. It recognizes\r\nthe right of absolute dominion. It secures it effectually. It imposes\r\nupon the soil of the District the right of holding, retaining, and\r\ntaking away the slaves by the owner himself, his agent or assignee.\r\nThe slave-trade, in my judgment, is thus restored.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I am satisfied that the article reported by the\r\ncommittee is not susceptible of misconstruction, and I hope we shall\r\nnot mar the report by adopting the amendment. Our intention was only\r\nto permit public officers to bring their servants here.\r\n\r\nMr. AMES:--Two words will cure all this difficulty. The insertion of\r\nthe words \"for personal service only.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--We have no intention of reviving the slave-trade in the\r\nDistrict. I have no more to say.\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--I hope this section will not be left in doubt. When I\r\nfirst read it I said to myself, \"This thing will never do; it will\r\nbring the slave-trade back to the District.\"\r\n\r\nMr. AMES:--Will the gentleman from Vermont accept my amendment?\r\n\r\nMr. HALL:--No. I cannot accept it. I offer the amendment in good\r\nfaith, for I believe it necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--Cannot we avoid the verbiage of the\r\namendment?\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I shall vote against the amendment of the gentleman from\r\nVermont, so that I can vote for that proposed by Mr. AMES.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon Mr. HALL'S amendment being taken by States, resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and\r\n     Kansas--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was adopted.\r\n\r\nMessrs. HOPPIN and BROWNE, of Rhode Island, dissented from the vote of\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I move to amend the original article of the committee's\r\nreport by the addition of this proviso. My object is to prevent the\r\nsale of slaves in the waters of New York or any other port:\r\n\r\n     \"_Provided_, That nothing in this section shall be so\r\n     construed as to prevent any States in which involuntary\r\n     servitude is prohibited, from restraining by law the\r\n     transfer of such persons, or of any right or interest in\r\n     their services, from one individual to another, within the\r\n     limits of such State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I insist there is not the slightest necessity for this\r\namendment. I hope gentlemen will stop interposing these useless\r\npropositions; they confound the sense of the article, and we are\r\nguarding against questions which by no possibility can arise.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken on the amendment of Mr. McCURDY, and resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and\r\n     Kansas--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMessrs. LOGAN and PALMER, of Illinois, dissented from the vote of that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--I would ask the gentleman from Connecticut if he ever\r\nknew or heard of a case where a slave was sold in a free State?\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I do not intend to argue that question; but as I am\r\nappealed to, although the proviso is adopted, I will state the grounds\r\non which it rests.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I wish to know whether the object of the amendment is to\r\nprevent the making of contracts connected with the purchase or sale of\r\nslaves in the free States?\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--My object is apparent from the amendment. It explains\r\nitself. I wish to prohibit any transactions concerning the purchase or\r\nsale of slaves, either within the free States or the navigable waters\r\nconnected therewith, or under free State jurisdiction. If there were\r\nno such prohibition, a cargo of slaves might be brought from the coast\r\nof Africa into the port of New York, and transferred there to parties\r\nresiding in the slave States. The free States have a right to direct\r\nwhat shall, and what shall not be a subject of commerce within their\r\nlimits. I presume it is not intended that the Constitution shall\r\nprohibit the exercise of this right. I desire not to leave this open\r\nto construction, but to make the section declare that no such\r\nintention exists.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I am now satisfied that we shall get nothing here that\r\nis satisfactory to the people of the south side of the river. We are\r\ncontinually waylaid by suspicions, which are unjust, unfounded, and\r\nought not to exist. If this class of amendments is to be adopted, I\r\ncannot go on, with respect to myself or the Convention. I feel now,\r\nsince this amendment is adopted, that my mission here is ended.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I move to insert at the end of the third article reported\r\nby the committee these words: \"Persons of the African race shall not\r\nbe deemed citizens, or permitted to exercise the right of suffrage, in\r\nthe election of federal officers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--This is worse than ever, and it comes from the South\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--I will withdraw it then.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I ask the unanimous consent of the Conference to move\r\nthe adoption of the previous question. We may as well come to the\r\npoint now as ever. There is no use of discussing this question any\r\nlonger. I move the previous question upon the report.\r\n\r\nObjections and cries of \"No, no,\" were made by several members.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I will withdraw the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I think it would be very unreasonable for any gentleman\r\nto expect that we were to get through with the questions presented by\r\nthis report without the exercise of mutual forbearance. The adoption\r\nof an amendment implies no disrespect to the committee. No member of\r\nthe committee should take it in that sense. I will move a\r\nreconsideration of the vote by which the last amendment was adopted. I\r\ndo not think we had better take the vote now, but pass the subject for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It can be passed by common consent.\r\n\r\nThe vote was reconsidered without a division, and the immediate\r\nconsideration of the question passed.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I now renew the offer of my substitute for the third\r\nsection of the article reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I thought when the motion to reconsider the vote upon Mr.\r\nMcCURDY'S amendment was agreed to, it was understood that the\r\nconsideration of the whole section was to be passed for the present.\r\nMy vote upon that amendment was given deliberately, and I have no idea\r\nthat this Convention is to break up because a vote is passed in it\r\nwhich is distasteful to any man, State, or delegation.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I think I must insist upon the consideration of my\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWNE:--I move to lay the substitute proposed by the gentleman\r\nfrom Ohio on the table. If that motion is carried, I do not understand\r\nthat the effect of it is to lay the report of the committee on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I rise to a question of order. I think the question now\r\nshould be on Mr. McCURDY'S amendment. I ask for information. I do not\r\nquite see how that amendment can be informally passed over without at\r\nthe same time passing the consideration of the whole article.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It was passed by universal consent.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--As I understand it, the gentleman from Illinois made the\r\nmotion that the vote be reconsidered, and the consideration of the\r\namendment passed for the present, and this was agreed to by the\r\nConference unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. BROWNE to lay the motion of Mr. HITCHCOCK on the\r\ntable, was agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I move to strike out these words in the third section:\r\n\"Nor shall Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of\r\ntaxation on persons bound to labor than on land.\" I have already\r\nstated that I think this language singularly inappropriate to a\r\nprovision of the Constitution. The Constitution already prohibits such\r\ndistinctions in the laying of taxes, and, therefore, there is no\r\nnecessity for the adoption of this clause. But I have another and more\r\nimportant objection to it; it contains and proposes to place in the\r\nConstitution the distinct recognition of the right of property in\r\nslaves. This recognition was carefully avoided in the Convention which\r\nframed the Constitution, and the North always has been, and always\r\nwill be, opposed to any such recognition. Place it there, and your\r\narticle will never be adopted in any of the free States.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--The first statutes passed by Congress on this subject\r\nrecognized the right to tax slaves. This implied the right to hold\r\nslaves. This recognition of the right of taxation was made in express\r\nterms. The gentleman has forgotten the history of the legislation on\r\nthis subject. The object of the committee is to prevent any\r\npossibility that those who come after us should make any distinction\r\nbetween these classes of property in levying taxes. We do not seek a\r\nrecognition of the right of property in slaves in this; that right is\r\nalready recognized to our satisfaction in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I understand the gentleman from Kentucky, and I think he is\r\nright. If we adopt the article at all we ought to retain this\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken by States on the amendment proposed by Mr. BALDWIN,\r\nwith the following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut--3.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri--18.\r\n\r\nMr. PRATT dissented from the vote of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nMessrs. NOYES and SMITH also dissented from the vote of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--I move to strike out the words \"without the consent of\r\nMaryland,\" immediately following the words \"service in the District of\r\nColumbia.\"\r\n\r\nI can see no necessity for requiring the consent of Maryland to the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District. There is no more reason for it\r\nthan for requiring the consent of Maine, or any other State. By the\r\ncession of the District to the United States Maryland has parted with\r\nall power over it, and the exclusive power of legislation is given to\r\nCongress. The District has become the common property of the Union as\r\nmuch as any of the Territories, and ought to be controlled in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I hope this amendment will not prevail. The District\r\nis almost surrounded by the Territory of Maryland. The abolition of\r\nslavery in it would be very destructive to our interests and property.\r\nTo convert the District into free territory would offer a direct\r\ninvitation to our slaves to abscond and go into the District. Even if\r\nthe rendition clause of the Constitution was faithfully observed and\r\ncarried out, it would involve us in much expense and difficulty. If we\r\nare required to maintain faith with the Government, the Government\r\nmust keep faith with us.\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--I did not suppose my motion would meet with such serious\r\nobjections. If they exist I will withdraw it.\r\n\r\nMr. BATES:--I have an amendment to propose, which I think will improve\r\nthe language of the section, and make it more consonant with that used\r\nin the Constitution. I move to amend the third section by striking out\r\nthe word \"bound\" wherever it occurs therein, and inserting in its\r\nplace the word \"held;\" also to insert after the words \"to labor\"\r\nwherever they occur, the words \"or service.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendments proposed by Mr. BATES were adopted without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--I propose to amend the section as it stands after the\r\nadoption of the amendments of Mr. BATES, by inserting between the\r\nwords \"or\" and \"service\" where they occur in that connection, the word\r\n\"involuntary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I had rather leave out the word \"involuntary;\" it would\r\nlook better. As the section now stands, both voluntary and involuntary\r\nservice are included.\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--By the insertion of the words \"service\" in Mr. BATES'\r\namendment, one portion of my purpose is accomplished. I will withdraw\r\nmy motion.\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I would ask if it is now in order to move a substitute\r\nfor the whole section. I have one which meets my wishes, and which, I\r\nthink, will meet the views of, and be acceptable to, the Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I do not think it is in order to offer a substitute at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--Then I will call it a motion to strike out and insert,\r\nwhich, certainly, is in order. I, therefore, move to strike out the\r\nwhole of the third section and insert the following:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 3. Congress shall have no power to abolish or\r\n     control within any State the relations established or\r\n     recognized by the laws thereof respecting persons held to\r\n     service or labor therein.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 4. Congress shall have no power to legislate\r\n     respecting the relation of service or labor in places under\r\n     its exclusive jurisdiction, but within States where that\r\n     relation is established or recognized, and while it\r\n     continues, without the consent of such States; nor abolish\r\n     or impair such relation in the District of Columbia, without\r\n     the consent of such States; nor abolish or impair such\r\n     relation in the District of Columbia, without the consent of\r\n     Maryland, and compensation to persons to whom such service\r\n     or labor is due.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 5. Congress shall have no power to prohibit the\r\n     removal from any State or Territory of persons held to\r\n     service or labor therein, to any other State or Territory in\r\n     which persons are so held; and the right during removal of\r\n     touching at ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in\r\n     case of distress, shall exist, but not the right of transit\r\n     in or through any State or Territory without its consent. No\r\n     higher rate of taxation shall be imposed on persons so held\r\n     than on land.\r\n\r\nThree objects are sought to be obtained by the third section as\r\nproposed by the committee: one is, the declaration that Congress has\r\nno power over slavery in the States; the second, that Congress shall\r\nnot legislate respecting slavery in territory under its jurisdiction,\r\nbut within the limits of States, without the consent of such States,\r\nnor abolish slavery in the District without the consent of Maryland;\r\nthe third concerns the subject of the removal of slaves from place to\r\nplace. It is desirable that these three subjects should be so\r\npresented that one or more of them may be adopted, and the others\r\nrejected; a purpose that cannot be accomplished if they are all\r\nembraced in the same section. My substitute is plain and simple, and I\r\nthink covers the whole ground.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN:--Has not the gentleman entirely left out the provision\r\nrelative to bringing slaves into the District of Columbia?\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I have, because I believe it entirely unnecessary.\r\nCannot the South take a proposition that is fair? A slave within the\r\nDistrict cannot be taken from the owner under any authority of\r\nCongress, unless the owner receives full compensation. Compensation\r\nwould in all cases be an equivalent for the slave in the District, or\r\nelsewhere. Under the Constitution, slavery cannot be abolished without\r\ncompensation, except by the consent of all parties interested in the\r\nsubject. It is not pretended that Congress has a right to abolish\r\nslavery anywhere without making compensation to the owner.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The owner should always have compensation, it is true;\r\nbut his right in this respect is based upon the right of property in\r\nslaves. It is not true that compensation is in all cases an equivalent\r\nfor the slave. An owner should be free to determine for himself the\r\nquestion whether he will part with his property upon receiving\r\nsuitable compensation. Under the gentleman's proposition this right\r\nwould be exercised by Congress and not by the owner. But there is a\r\nfarther, and still greater objection to the proposition: The North\r\ndenies the right of property in slaves, and would deny compensation\r\nalso, unless compelled to make it under the Constitution. The North\r\nholding slavery to be unjust and unrighteous, would desire to abolish\r\nthe institution without paying for it.\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I am willing to amend Section 4 of the substitute I\r\noffer, by denying to Congress the power to abolish the relation\r\nwithout making compensation, and the section may be thus considered.\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--I wish to support the proposition of Mr. GROESBECK; and\r\nlet me say one thing farther: our words should be plain and simple; we\r\nshould use language which common men can understand, and which does\r\nnot require to be construed by lawyers. Above all, let us have some\r\nconfidence in each other.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--There is another entire and important omission in Mr.\r\nGROESBECK'S proposition: there is no provision whatever for the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I think the Conference had much better adhere to the\r\nsection reported by the committee as it has been already amended. We\r\nhave all read and studied that section. We understand it. A State that\r\nwill not adopt the whole of the section will not adopt any part of it,\r\nand so there is no use in severing the subjects provided for. I am\r\nopposed to the adoption of the substitute. We understand the original\r\narticle better than we can any other.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I think the original proposition the best; the word\r\n\"regulate\" has been struck out of it, leaving only the words \"impair\r\nor abolish.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I ask leave to revive my motion. I regret having\r\nwithdrawn it. I think I have the right to renew it now.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT (Mr. ALEXANDER in the chair):--The motion of the\r\ngentleman from Connecticut is out of order.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I understand we are now considering the amendment\r\noffered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GROESBECK). If so, I move to\r\ninsert in his proposition after the word \"abolish\" the words \"or\r\nimpair.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I think the amendment improves it. I will accept it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--There is, certainly, a misunderstanding as to the effect\r\nof the vote laying the amendment offered by Mr. HITCHCOCK upon the\r\ntable: it was offered as a substitute to the third section; if it did\r\nnot carry the whole section to the table, then motions to amend that\r\nsection are in order. In that view, I think Mr. McCURDY'S motion is in\r\norder either way: to amend the article proposed by the committee, or\r\nto amend the amendment of Mr. GROESBECK.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I think Mr. McCURDY'S motion is entirely out of order;\r\nit has once been passed by informally.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--Is it not in order at any time to make a motion which\r\nwill render the proposed substitute more perfect?\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I do not wish my proposition ruled out upon any\r\ntechnical construction of rules. I will now move it as an addition to\r\nthe third section.\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--I move to reconsider the vote adopting the motion\r\nproposed by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. HALL).\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I oppose the motion. The amendment is both proper and\r\nnecessary. It can certainly do no harm to the South; and if the South\r\nwishes to be fair, it will not object to it.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--I oppose the reconsideration of the vote adopting Mr.\r\nHALL'S amendment, and I will state very shortly the reason why. If the\r\ndoctrine is to be established here, that the report of the committee\r\nis too sacred to be touched--too perfect to be made subject to\r\namendment--let us know it. It will relieve myself, and I think many\r\nothers, from farther attendance here; and I wish to say now, that if\r\nwe are to sit here, such considerations must not be presented in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nMr. FOWLER:--I will withdraw my motion.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I certainly wish some one would renew the motion\r\nto reconsider the vote upon Mr. HALL'S amendment. I do not like to do\r\nit myself, but I think if that amendment were reconsidered, we would\r\nfix upon some terms that would be satisfactory to all sides.\r\n\r\nMr. AMES:--I do not see the necessity for adopting Mr. McCURDY'S\r\nproposition. I think it amounts to nothing. It is simply a prohibition\r\nin the Constitution against the exercise of a right which no one\r\nwishes to exercise. I oppose it because it is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I certainly do not wish to insist upon an unnecessary\r\namendment. If the third section, as reported by the committee, is\r\nadopted, it declares that the right of transportation, &c., _shall\r\nexist_. Under this, if no amendment is adopted, slaves may be bought\r\nand sold in any of the waters of the free States.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--What difficulty or damage does the gentleman propose\r\nto obviate by his amendment?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Chair has already decided that the proposition of\r\nMr. McCURDY is not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE appealed from the decision of the Chair, and upon the appeal\r\nthe decision was sustained.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I understand this decision cuts off both the amendments\r\noffered by Mr. HALL and Mr. McCURDY; that compels us to vote against\r\nthe proposition of Mr. GROESBECK.\r\n\r\nMr. CHITTENDEN:--The amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. HALL, has\r\nbeen accepted. It stands as the order of the Conference, and cannot be\r\nrescinded except by a vote. I sustain the decision of the Chair,\r\nbecause, by every rule of parliamentary law, it was correct. But one\r\nthing farther. It is now perfectly in order to move Mr. McCURDY'S\r\nproposition, or any other, as an _addition_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--Most clearly so.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I do not discover any particular objection to the\r\namendment of Mr. GROESBECK. If it had been reported by the committee,\r\nI should have preferred it; but the South is willing to take the\r\nsection as it stands, and prefers the original to any substitute.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--I am against the substitute, for it destroys the effect of\r\nthe amendments offered by Messrs. HALL and McCURDY.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon Mr. GROESBECK'S amendment, and resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, and Indiana--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri,\r\n     Illinois, and Kansas--12.\r\n\r\nAnd it was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I feel that my mission here is ended, and that I may as\r\nwell withdraw from the Conference. I seem to be unable to impress\r\ngentlemen with the necessity of accomplishing any thing. The report of\r\nthe committee is not satisfactory to the South; it is even doubtful\r\nwhether they will adopt it; certainly they will not, if it is cut to\r\npieces by amendments. I may be compelled to sacrifice my property, or\r\ngo with the secessionists. At my time of life, I do not wish to do\r\neither.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--I regret that my amendment produces so much feeling, but\r\nI think, at all events, we should prevent the sale of slaves in the\r\nfree States; it should be prevented beyond any possibility. I renew\r\nthe offer of my amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--If the laws of New York will permit the sale of slaves\r\nwithin the limits of that State, then we should prohibit the sale in\r\nthe Constitution as proposed; but so long as that State has power to\r\npass a law prohibiting it, there is no necessity for the amendment.\r\nThe owner is only permitted to touch with his slaves, under certain\r\ncircumstances, at the ports of free States.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--It is impossible that slaves can be sold in a free State\r\nunder the section reported by the committee. We propose to give the\r\nright of touching at those ports as a privilege, but we give no right\r\nof sale there. The laws of a free State could not be evaded in this\r\nway. Each State is supreme within its own limits; that supremacy would\r\nnot be aided by this proviso.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--Suppose a slave owner is compelled to stop at the port of\r\nCairo, through stress of weather or any other cause, and he dies\r\nthere, are his slaves set free by his death? Does not the law of\r\nactual domicil prevail? I think they will be regarded as slaves, and\r\nthat under this provision they might be administered upon and sold as\r\na part of his estate.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--I think we may obviate all difficulty by inserting after\r\nthe words \"landing in case of distress,\" the words \"but not for\r\ntraffic or sale.\"\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I am in favor of the amendment proposed by the gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania. It is not proper or best to encumber these\r\npropositions with amendments that are not necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--Every State has the right to regulate transit within its\r\nown limits to suit itself. The proposed amendment gives no rights\r\nexcept such as are expressly named: \"a right, during transportation,\r\nof touching at the ports, and of landing in case of distress.\" The\r\nright of the State to regulate transit is left unimpaired.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--There is one principle of law which will settle this\r\nquestion at once: property that is held under State laws must be\r\ntransferred by the operation of State laws alone. Slaves are held and\r\ntransferred by the specific laws of the States in which they are held.\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--The right of sale cannot possibly arise out of the right\r\nto touch during transportation at a port, or the right to land in case\r\nof distress. I cannot see the slightest occasion or necessity for the\r\nadoption of Mr. McCURDY'S amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY'S amendment was rejected by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,\r\n     Indiana, and Iowa--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, and\r\n     Kansas--14.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK'S amendment was then adopted without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I wish to propose an amendment by way of proviso:\r\n\r\n     \"_Provided_ nothing herein contained shall be so construed\r\n     as to prevent any State from prohibiting the introduction as\r\n     merchandise of persons held to service or labor, or to\r\n     prevent such State from prohibiting the transit of persons\r\n     so held to service or labor through its limits.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--This does not cover Mr. McCURDY'S proposition at all. Is\r\nthere any secret purpose here to bring into the Constitution a\r\nprovision which will permit the sale of slaves in free States? If\r\nthere is not, why not say plainly that the States shall have the\r\nexclusive right to determine who shall and who shall not cross its\r\nborders, and what shall be the subject of sale or traffic within them?\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--The States have all the powers which are not expressly\r\ndelegated under the Constitution to be exercised by Congress. Congress\r\nhas no power, except such as are expressly conferred upon them. The\r\npower to prohibit the sale of slaves rests somewhere. It has not been\r\nconferred upon Congress; it must remain in the State.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--The argument of the gentleman from Kentucky seems to me\r\nvery inconsistent with his report in other respects.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--The Border States are trying to get back the seceded\r\nStates. We hope they will come back. We expect the adoption of this\r\nreport to offer a strong inducement to them to return to the Union. It\r\nwill not offer such inducement if its general effect is ruined by\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon Mr. VANDEVER'S amendment resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,\r\n     Indiana, and Iowa--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, and\r\n     Kansas--14.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I have already stated that the State of Kentucky is\r\nprepared to adopt the CRITTENDEN amendment; that amendment will be\r\nsatisfactory to the Border States. The longer we remain here the more\r\nI become satisfied that the CRITTENDEN amendment will meet with more\r\ngeneral favor than any other; therefore I ask the consent of the\r\nConference to introduce the CRITTENDEN amendment as a substitute for\r\nthe committee's report.\r\n\r\nThe consent of the Conference was not given to Mr. CLAY'S proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I move to amend the third section by inserting after\r\nthe words \"in case of distress shall exist,\" the words \"but not the\r\nright of transit in any other State or Territory without its consent.\"\r\n\r\nWe must certainly do something to cover this difficulty; if we omit\r\nthe subject entirely, we shall leave much opportunity for cavil on\r\nthis question when the question goes to the people.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I move to amend the amendment by substituting in place of\r\nthe words \"without its consent,\" the words \"against its dissent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GROESBECK:--I will accept the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. GROESBECK was agreed to by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     and Ohio--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois--8.\r\n\r\nMr. ALEXANDER, of New Jersey, dissented from the vote of that State.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER moved that when the Conference adjourn it adjourn to\r\nhalf-past seven o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon Mr. GRANGER'S motion was taken by States, and resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Ohio,\r\n     Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas--13.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Kentucky, and Missouri--6.\r\n\r\nSo the motion was adopted.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. CHASE the Conference adjourned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION--SEVENTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, MONDAY, _February 25th, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order at half-past seven o'clock, Mr.\r\nALEXANDER in the chair.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH, of New York:--I move that a committee of two be appointed\r\nby the PRESIDENT to arrange for the printing of the Journal.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. SMITH was adopted, and the PRESIDENT appointed as\r\nsuch committee, Mr. SMITH, of New York, and Mr. HOWARD, of Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe Conference then proceeded to the consideration of the order of the\r\nday, being the third section of the article reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. HITCHCOCK:--I move to amend the third section by striking out the\r\nwords \"or Territory of the United States,\" occurring after the words\r\n\"within any State.\"\r\n\r\nI think we shall make the amendment more satisfactory by limiting the\r\nprohibition to States alone; still leaving the power in Congress to be\r\nexercised in conformity with the other provisions that regulate\r\nslavery in the Territories.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I have the same objection to this as to other\r\namendments. It may not be important, but I do not want to commence by\r\nadopting amendments at all.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken upon the amendment proposed by Mr. HITCHCOCK,\r\nand was agreed to by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\n     Kansas--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\n     Missouri--9.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMMERS:--I now desire to call up for consideration the amendment\r\nproposed by myself on the evening of the 23d instant. The state of the\r\ncase is this: Mr. JOHNSON, of Maryland, moved an amendment to my\r\nproposition, which was accepted; my amendment was then rejected by a\r\nvote of the Conference, and on the 25th the Conference reconsidered\r\nthe vote by which the amendment was rejected. I will not now repeat\r\nwhat I said, when the amendment was offered, in favor of its\r\nadoption. I would only call the attention of gentlemen to the remarks\r\nI then made, and say in addition, that I earnestly hope the Conference\r\nwill now adopt the amendment. It will make the proposition much more\r\nacceptable to the South, and, certainly, not more objectionable to the\r\nNorth. The amendment is offered to the second section, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"No territory shall be acquired by the United States, except\r\n     by discovery, and for naval and commercial stations, depots\r\n     and transit routes, without the concurrence of a majority of\r\n     all the Senators from States which allow involuntary\r\n     servitude, and a majority of all the Senators from States\r\n     which prohibit that relation; nor shall territory be\r\n     acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a majority of the\r\n     Senators from each class of States hereinbefore mentioned,\r\n     be cast as a part of the two-thirds majority necessary to\r\n     the ratification of such treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. SUMMERS was adopted by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio--12.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n     and Kansas--6.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--No further amendment being offered to the second and\r\nthird sections, the Conference will proceed to the consideration of\r\nthe fourth section of the report, or any amendments proposed to that\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nNone being proposed, the Conference proceeded to the fifth section.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I move to strike out the whole of the section. It has\r\nbeen heretofore stated, on behalf of the North, when this section was\r\nunder consideration, that its adoption was not desirable, inasmuch as\r\nexisting laws, properly enforced, amount to a sufficient prohibition\r\nof the slave-trade. If the North does not desire it, the South does\r\nnot. I hope the Conference will consent to strike it out.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I think it very important to retain this section; it\r\ncan, certainly, do no harm. We all agree, North and South, that the\r\nforeign slave-trade should not be revived.\r\n\r\nThe amendment offered by Mr. SEDDON was rejected by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Missouri--4.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n     Iowa, and Kansas--17.\r\n\r\nMr. BRADFORD:--I move to amend the fifth section by inserting after\r\nthe words \"slave-trade,\" the words \"by citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn proposing amendments to the Constitution, it seems to me improper\r\nthat we should attempt to bind any but our own citizens. The adoption\r\nof the section in this form would seem to imply that we undertook to\r\nprohibit the slave-trade in other countries and among citizens of\r\nother countries. I desire to see it prohibited, but wish to have the\r\nconstitutional provision expressed in appropriate terms.\r\n\r\nMr. CROWNINSHIELD:--I object to this amendment. It would nullify the\r\noperation of the section entirely. There are in the United States\r\nthousands of persons who are not citizens, but who, under such a\r\nprovision of the Constitution, would revive the slave-trade and infuse\r\ninto it a vigor which it never before possessed. It would be better to\r\nhave no section at all than to permit such an amendment as this. The\r\namendment can bear but one construction. It is intended to prohibit\r\nthe slave-trade by our own citizens, and expressly to permit it by\r\nthose who are not citizens.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I am in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BRADFORD:--I do not desire to embarrass the action of the\r\nConference, and I will withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES:--I move to amend this section by striking out the following\r\nwords: \"from places beyond the limits thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this amendment is apparent, and does not need\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. JAMES was agreed to by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois,\r\n     Indiana, and Kansas--17.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Virginia, North Carolina, and Missouri--3.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I move that the vote just passed\r\nstriking out the words \"from places beyond the present limits\r\nthereof,\" be rescinded.\r\n\r\nI think the action of the Convention in passing this vote was hasty,\r\nand not taken upon due consideration. It may be an important question\r\nto determine, what are \"the present limits thereof.\" Upon one\r\nconstruction it might prohibit the bringing of slaves from the States\r\nwhich have seceded and left the Union; upon another construction,\r\nwhich assumes that these are still in the Union and does not recognize\r\ntheir secession, it would not cut off the trade between those States\r\nand the others. I do not like to have such a question raised.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I am against this reconsideration. So far as I am\r\nconcerned, I do not propose, in this Conference, to recognize the\r\nsecession of the States at all. I deny the legal power of a State to\r\nwithdraw itself from the Union without the consent of the others. And\r\nbeyond this, I do not think the question is raised as the gentleman\r\nasserts.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I think the clause is better as it is. By striking out\r\nthe words \"from beyond the present limits thereof,\" we do not\r\nestablish any territorial limitation. And whether these States come\r\nback or not, no question of territory is raised. But if this\r\nreconsideration is carried, and the seceding States do not return to\r\nthe Union, they will retaliate upon us. In the event of their\r\ncontinued secession we cannot get back from those States those of our\r\nslaves who are now temporarily there. We may wish to bring back those\r\nslaves, and some of our people may wish to carry ours there.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--I hope this vote will not be reconsidered. The argument\r\nof Judge RUFFIN is conclusive.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--This is likely to be a troublesome question any way. Why\r\nnot leave it as we have to leave many others--to the discretion of\r\nCongress? We certainly do not wish to adopt a provision which will cut\r\noff the traffic in slaves between the Gulf States and the others.\r\nNobody is in favor of that, and I am at a loss how to manage this\r\nquestion. The negroes are a portion of the families of Southern men.\r\nThey are regarded as such in all the transactions of life. Those\r\nfamilies may at times become separated. A portion of them may now be\r\nin the seceded States, and a portion farther North. Again, it often\r\nhappens that during one season of the year the planter, with his\r\nfamily and slaves, lives upon the plantation in the Gulf States; and\r\nat another season, removes with his family and slaves to a plantation\r\nfarther North. We do not wish to obstruct a relation or proceeding of\r\nthis kind. This is not a mere matter of dollars and cents. It is one\r\ninvolving the happiness of families. The blacks themselves are\r\ninterested in it. I think it better to let the section stand as it\r\ndoes, and to leave the whole matter to the discretion of Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--I have always stood up against all the societies and\r\norganizations which have been established at the North to carry on\r\ncrusades against slavery. My position in that respect is still\r\nunchanged. I hold that the people of the free States have nothing to\r\ndo with slavery; that they are not responsible for it, and that it is\r\ntheir duty to let it alone. At the same time I have just as steadily\r\nopposed the slave-trade. I think it inhuman and atrocious, and I am\r\nthe last man that would consent to its restoration. This section as it\r\nstands, in my judgment, cannot be improved. I think we had better\r\nleave it, and not raise these troublesome questions which will\r\ninevitably be suggested if these words are restored.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--This is a matter which requires some reflection, and,\r\non the whole, I am inclined, for the present, to withdraw my\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I do not like this plan of legislating in the\r\nConstitution. The Constitution ought to be an instrument defining and\r\nlimiting the powers of Congress. We had better leave to Congress, or\r\nrather, to assign to Congress the power to exercise this prohibition.\r\nI, therefore, move to amend by inserting at the commencement of the\r\nsection these words: \"The Congress shall have power to prohibit,\" and\r\nto strike out at the end of the section the words \"are forever\r\nprohibited.\"\r\n\r\nMr. ALLEN:--This would be a most effectual way of reviving the\r\nslave-trade. It would remove the constitutional prohibition, and\r\npermit Congress to prohibit or permit it, as that body may choose.\r\nWould that ever hereafter be considered a crime which Congress had\r\npower to permit? No. I cannot conceive it possible that any State\r\nshould seriously wish to see a traffic resumed which has been\r\nstigmatized by the whole civilized world as worse than piracy. This is\r\na question which I would not leave to Congress. We know how immensely\r\nprofitable this trade is--that fortunes are made by a single\r\nsuccessful voyage. Don't let such an inducement to corruption creep\r\ninto our Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I am in favor of this amendment, not because I am in\r\nfavor of the slave-trade, but because such a section is out of place\r\nin the Constitution. The Constitution is a bill of rights, an\r\ninstrument which defines and settles the rights of citizens. It is not\r\na law. I have no fear that if we leave this to Congress the\r\nslave-trade will be revived.\r\n\r\nMr. DONIPHAN:--I cannot agree with my colleague. I am opposed to the\r\nforeign slave-trade in every form. I would not even make a treaty with\r\na nation or a State that would permit it. If the seceded States are to\r\nbe regarded out of the Union, I would not treat with them; I would not\r\ninvest Congress with such a dangerous power. Nothing will suit me but\r\nan unqualified prohibition of this trade in the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--The gentleman from Missouri has expressed the views of\r\nDelaware. His argument is conclusive.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--The intervention of Congress will be necessary whether\r\nthis amendment passes or not. The section as adopted makes no\r\nprovision for the punishment of any one who violates it. If a vessel\r\nshould be seized while engaged in the trade, this section does not\r\nprovide for her forfeiture or condemnation, or the punishment of her\r\nofficers or owners. The section would be inoperative without the\r\naction of Congress. Why not let Congress have all the power?\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE:--Congress will declare the punishment.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--If you cut off the slave with the seceded States, they\r\nwill do the same with you. I think the Border States should at all\r\nevents adopt the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Conference refused to agree to the amendment of Mr. SEDDON by the\r\nfollowing vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\n     Missouri--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and\r\n     Kansas--16.\r\n\r\nMessrs. JOHNSON and DONIPHAN, of Missouri, dissented from the vote of\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--I move to strike out the whole of this section, and\r\ninsert a new one of the following tenor: \"The foreign slave-trade is\r\nhereby forever prohibited; and it shall be the duty of Congress to\r\npass laws to prevent the importation of slaves into the United States\r\nand their Territories, from places beyond the limits thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I like the amendment proposed better than the\r\noriginal, but I wish to suggest an amendment to it myself.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that certain countries which are much exercised over the\r\ncriminality of slavery and the slave-trade, have recently adopted a\r\nsystem, the horrors of which are not surpassed by those of the middle\r\npassage. I refer to the importation of coolies and other persons from\r\nChina and the East. In my judgment, this is the slave-trade in one of\r\nits worst forms. I think if we prevent the importation of slaves at\r\nall, the provision ought to be made to cover such a case. I therefore\r\nmove to amend the proposition of Mr. MOREHEAD, by inserting after the\r\nwords \"importation of slaves,\" the words \"or coolies, or persons held\r\nto service or labor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--I accept the amendment of Mr. WICKLIFFE, and should\r\nhave inserted it myself had it occurred to me. My proposition as it\r\nnow stands, covers both the points here made; it declares the entire\r\nprohibition of the slave-trade, and it makes it also the duty of\r\nCongress to pass laws effectually to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe amendment offered by Mr. MOREHEAD was agreed to by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\n     Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\n     Illinois--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, New York, New Jersey, and Kansas--8.\r\n\r\nMr. HOPPIN, of Rhode Island, Messrs. ORTH and ELLIS, of Indiana, and\r\nMr. STOCKTON, of New Jersey, dissented from the votes of their\r\nrespective States.\r\n\r\nMr. CROWNINSHIELD:--I move to strike out the whole section. I had\r\nrather have no section at all, and no provision upon the subject, than\r\nsuch a one as we have now adopted. The requisition upon Congress\r\nmaking it their duty to enact laws, will be considered as a necessary\r\none; the consequence which must result is, that until Congress\r\nlegislates, there is no law against the importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CROWNINSHIELD was rejected by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Massachusetts, Virginia, and Tennessee--3.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, North Carolina, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio,\r\n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Kansas--18.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the consideration\r\nof the sixth section.\r\n\r\nNo amendment being offered thereto, the Conference proceeded to the\r\nseventh section.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I move to strike out the whole of the seventh section,\r\nand insert in lieu thereof the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Congress shall provide by law for securing to the citizens\r\n     of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens of\r\n     the several States.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh section, as it now stands, will encounter more serious\r\nobjection at the North than all the remaining portion of the article.\r\nIt is objectionable for many reasons: it looks to the actual exercise\r\nof violence and intimidation by mobs and unlawful assemblies at the\r\nNorth. Although such may have occurred in one or two sections only,\r\ngenerally the provisions of the fugitive slave law have been observed\r\nand carried out. The whole subject is very distasteful to the North. I\r\nthink if we keep it out of the article, and in its place secure that\r\nrespect for the privileges of citizens in the various States, to\r\nwhich, indeed, under the Constitution, they are entitled, we shall do\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--There are various reasons peculiar to some of the free\r\nStates why this provision should not be adopted. The laws of several\r\nof the Western States do not recognize negroes as citizens. I move to\r\namend the amendment proposed by my colleague, by inserting the words\r\n\"free white\" before the word \"citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment offered by Mr. LOGAN was adopted by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\n     Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and\r\n     Illinois--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, and Iowa--8.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH, of Indiana, dissented from the vote of his State.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER:--I suppose the purpose of my colleague has been attained.\r\nIf there is a delegation willing to make such a distinction in the\r\nConstitution, they will, of course, support the amendment as it is now\r\namended.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the amendment, as amended, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--None.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\n     Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Indiana--18.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--If the seventh section is adopted, I think the North\r\nshould have some compensation therefor. I think citizens of the North\r\nhave as much occasion for complaint on account of the action of mobs\r\nand riotous assemblies in the slave States, as the slave States have\r\nof the occurrence of those mobs and assemblies in the North. I\r\ntherefore move the following as an addition to the seventh section:\r\n\r\n     \"And Congress shall farther provide by law, that the United\r\n     States shall make full compensation to a citizen of any\r\n     State, who, in any other State, shall suffer by reason of\r\n     violence or intimidation from mobs and riotous assemblies,\r\n     in his person or property, or in the deprivation, by\r\n     violence, of his rights secured by this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I am opposed to this amendment upon the general\r\nprinciples I have so often stated. I oppose it for another reason. I\r\nam not in favor of an amendment which encourages mobs and riots at the\r\nNorth, and I will not consent to one which, like this, encourages\r\nseditious speeches at the South.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Such is not the effect of my amendment. It does not\r\nprotect a man in making seditious speeches in the slave States. It\r\nonly secures to the citizen his rights without regard to the State to\r\nwhich he belongs. We have a provision of the Constitution on that\r\nsubject now, but it is not effective.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I am in favor of the amendment. There is great necessity\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I think gentlemen entirely misconstrue the intent and\r\npurpose of the present provision of the Constitution on that subject.\r\nIt grows out of and rests upon that provision which requires the\r\nreturn of fugitive slaves. It imposes an obligation upon Congress to\r\nsecure to the owner, when he pursues his slave into a free State, the\r\nright which he enjoys as a citizen of his own State. In all other\r\nrespects it is unnecessary. If a man is injured in his person or his\r\nproperty, he has his redress in the State courts; or if he is a\r\nforeigner or a citizen of another State, he may go into the Federal\r\ncourts and get his redress there. In this respect the citizens of both\r\nsections are amply protected.\r\n\r\nMr. STEPHENS:--I earnestly hope this amendment may be rejected. We\r\nhave come here to arrange old difficulties, not to make new ones.\r\nAdopt this, and you lay the foundation stone of disunion. It is an\r\nencouragement to seditious speeches and purposes. The clause is well\r\nenough as it is. We do not wish to encourage men to come among us and\r\nexcite discontent among our slaves. We will not permit them to do it.\r\nOur safety requires that we should not. Our own citizens do not\r\nconnive at the escape of slaves. None do it who have any business in\r\nour States. We are here for peace. When half a dozen States are out,\r\nwhose return we wish to secure, shall we put such a clause as this\r\ninto the Constitution? Do it, and a half dozen others will follow. I\r\nam not at all sure that the report of the majority, if adopted, will\r\nsatisfy my State. It certainly will not if it is mangled and frittered\r\naway. I have not occupied time in making speeches here. I say to you\r\ngentlemen, beware! If I thought the spirit of the North was truly\r\nrepresented in this Conference, I would go home and advise my State to\r\nsecede; and if she did not, I would abandon her forever.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I am opposed to the amendment because I think it\r\nunnecessary, and because it opens a new and very serious controversy.\r\nThe rights of Northern men are fully protected now. There is not a\r\ncourt in the South in which a Northern citizen cannot find a lawyer to\r\nadvocate his cause. If he is poor, he may even sue _in forma\r\npauperis_, and incur no liability even for costs.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I am claiming no more than I have a right to claim under\r\nthe decision of the Supreme Court. That court, in the case of Prigg\r\n_vs._ The State of Pennsylvania, decided that the Constitution imposes\r\nthe duty upon Congress of carrying this provision into effect. I\r\ninsist upon making it plain. Rights upon both sides are sought to be\r\nprotected by this article. They are correlative.\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN favored and Mr. EWING opposed the amendment, in a few brief\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I do not think we shall accomplish much by protracting our\r\npresent session longer. I move that the Conference adjourn, and ask a\r\nvote by States.\r\n\r\nThe Conference refused to adjourn, by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois,\r\n     Iowa, and Kansas--7.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\n     New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,\r\n     North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio--14.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question recurs upon the amendment of the\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon the question of agreeing to the motion of Mr. WILMOT,\r\nresulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Maine, New York, Indiana, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Iowa--8.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, and Ohio--11.\r\n\r\nAnd the motion was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I now move to amend the seventh section, by adding\r\nthereto the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"And in all cases in which the United States shall pay for\r\n     such fugitive, Congress shall also provide for the\r\n     collection by the United States of the amount so paid, with\r\n     interest, from the county, city, or town in which such\r\n     arrest shall have been prevented, or rescue made.\"\r\n\r\nI am certain that no objection can be made to the equity of this\r\namendment. If a municipal corporation shall permit the rights of a\r\nslave owner to be disregarded by the rescue of a slave, it not only\r\nfails to perform its duty under the Constitution, but becomes an\r\nactive participant in the crime. Shall the consequences of its own\r\nfault be visited upon the people of the whole country? Those who\r\nacknowledge and carry out their obligations under the Constitution, as\r\nwell as those who do not? This would inflict a punishment upon the\r\ninnocent for the crime of the guilty. It is not right to leave it in\r\nthat way. It would present an inducement to these violations of law\r\nwhich the provision is intended to prevent. We ought to make the\r\nguilty party pay the penalty.\r\n\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN:--If such a proposition were to come from a free State,\r\nthe mover would be charged with attempting to destroy all hope that\r\nthe committee's report could be adopted by the people. However, if the\r\nfriends of the report are willing to adopt it, I do not know that I\r\nought to object. It places the Government in a position where it is\r\nbound under the Constitution to prosecute a municipal corporation for\r\nthe acts of its individual members. It is certainly novel, and\r\nintroduces a new system into the jurisprudence of the country. Is the\r\nmover serious in his proposition?\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I am certainly serious. I would like to hear some\r\nsubstantial argument against my motion.\r\n\r\nThe question being taken on the amendment of Mr. BARRINGER, resulted\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Virginia, North Carolina, and Kansas--3.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\n     Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n     Illinois, and Iowa--17.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I wish to enter my dissent from the vote of Maryland. I\r\nconsider the amendment as eminently just and proper.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I dissent from the vote of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I have an amendment which I intend to offer at\r\nsome time, and I may as well propose it now. The people of the free\r\nStates have complained, and not without good reason, that one clause\r\nin the Constitution is not carried into effect in some of the\r\nslaveholding States. Their complaints are similar to those made on the\r\npart of the South, which it is the purpose of the seventh section to\r\nremove. If there have been instances at the North where mobs and\r\nriotous assemblies have obstructed the administration of justice in\r\nthe case of fugitive slaves, so there have been instances at the South\r\nwhere mobs and riots have disregarded the rights of citizens of\r\nNorthern States. I propose to deal fairly by all sections. Let us\r\nremove both causes of complaint. I move to amend the seventh section\r\nby adding thereto the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"Congress shall provide by law for securing to the citizens\r\n     of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\n     the several States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I repeat my objection to all these amendments. If our\r\nwork here is to have any efficacy, we must adhere to the report. Why\r\nbring in another bone of contention?\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--Will you not extend the same protection to free citizens\r\nwhich you do to slaveholders?\r\n\r\nThe question was taken on the motion of Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,\r\n     Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, New\r\n     Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--16.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--4.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN dissented from the vote of Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. AMES:--I move an amendment which will make the section more\r\nexplicit. I move to strike out the word \"force,\" and to insert instead\r\nthereof the words \"violence or intimidation.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to without objection.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I move to amend the seventh section by adding at the close\r\nthereof the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"And such fugitives, after such payment, shall then be\r\n     discharged from such service.\"\r\n\r\nI am opposed to this whole business of making compensation for\r\nfugitive slaves; but if this section is to be adopted, and the\r\nGovernment pays the owner the whole value of the fugitive, upon every\r\nprinciple of equity and justice the fugitive should be discharged, and\r\nthe master should have no right to reduce him again to slavery. You\r\nmake the measure of the owner's damages in such a case the value of\r\nthe slave. Do you intend, after he has secured that, he shall still\r\nhave the right of capture--that after the damages have been fully\r\npaid, he may still call on the courts of law for the slave's\r\nsurrender? This would be a double compensation indeed. I shall insist\r\nupon this amendment, and ask a vote by States.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMAN:--I have not hitherto addressed the Conference, but I should\r\ndo myself injustice if I remained silent any longer. I came here in\r\ngood faith, encouraged with the hope that this Conference would do\r\nsomething which would indicate a purpose to protect and acknowledge\r\nthe rights of the slaveholding States. I have patiently attended your\r\nsittings, and little by little that hope has faded, until to-night it\r\nhas almost passed away. What good can come of these deliberations,\r\nwhen upon every question which is presented the lines of sectionalism\r\nare tightly drawn, and with one or two exceptions every northern State\r\nis arrayed against us? Suppose these proposals of amendment as\r\nreported by the committee are adopted, there is evidently a purpose\r\nmanifested here by a large delegation from the free States, to prevent\r\ntheir adoption by the people. I know the opposition which in any event\r\nwill be arrayed against them. It is an opposition which nothing but\r\nunanimity among the moderate conservative men of the country can\r\novercome. Believe it or not, gentlemen, I assure you we are in\r\nearnest, in our determination to have our rights under the\r\nConstitution defined and guaranteed. Our safety, as well as our\r\nself-respect, requires this. I have not been satisfied with the\r\nmajority report, but if I had been disposed to accept it--if the South\r\nwould accept it now, you will not concede even that. You insist upon\r\nweakening its provisions by amendments, and by amendments which are\r\ninsulting to us.\r\n\r\nIt is now seriously proposed under the Constitution, by an express\r\nprovision, to deprive us of our property in slaves against our\r\nconsent, and to emancipate them by making compensation. What other\r\neffect can be given to such an amendment? One of our slaves escapes\r\ninto a free State. He is arrested by the marshal and discharged by a\r\nmob. Does this act discharge him from his service? Does this lawless\r\nviolence make him free? And if the town or city where the mob occurs\r\nis made to pay a slight penalty, does this also divest the owner of\r\nhis right? This is nothing but an inducement to mobs and riots. Pass\r\nthis provision, and no fugitive slave will ever again be returned from\r\na free State. There will always be abolitionists enough to pay for a\r\nslave, and this payment will set the slave free, and will constitute\r\nthe only penalty for this violence. For one, I would prefer to have no\r\nprovision at all on the subject than to have one encumbered with such\r\nan amendment.\r\n\r\nI have but little more to say. If the peace of this country is to be\r\nhereafter established on a permanent basis, and the Union is to be\r\npreserved, you, gentlemen of the North, must recognize our rights, and\r\ncease to interfere with them. You have nothing to do with this\r\nquestion of slavery. It is an institution of our own. If it is a\r\ncrime, we are responsible for it, and will bear the responsibility. We\r\nhave never interfered with your institutions. You must now let us\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--The objection of the gentleman from Maryland may be\r\nanswered in a word. It is for the owner to elect whether or not to\r\naccept compensation and set his slave free. If he still chooses to\r\npursue him, he need not accept compensation; but if he does not, and\r\nreceives payment for him, the slave should go free. As to mobs and\r\nriots, we punish men at the North who engage in them.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I entirely agree with my colleague in this respect. We\r\ncould not accept the section if such an amendment was adopted. The\r\nreport of the committee is the very least that will satisfy our\r\npeople. Do not destroy it by such amendments as these.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the amendment proposed by Mr. ORTH, with\r\nthe following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New\r\n     York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Kansas--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,\r\n     New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\r\n     Vermont, and Virginia--11.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I move to amend the report by adding a section to be\r\nnumbered Section 8, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The second paragraph of the second section of fourth\r\n     article of the Constitution shall be so construed that no\r\n     State shall have the power to consider and determine what is\r\n     treason, felony, or crime, in another State; but that a\r\n     person charged in any State with treason, felony, or crime,\r\n     who shall flee from justice and be found in another State,\r\n     shall, on demand of the executive authority of the State\r\n     from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the\r\n     State having jurisdiction of the crime.\"\r\n\r\nI do not think discussion necessary upon such an amendment as this. It\r\nis well known to the Conference that great difficulties have been\r\nfound to exist in carrying into effect this provision of the\r\nConstitution. So far as the slave States are concerned, it is a\r\nperfect nullity. Unless it is amended it may as well be stricken from\r\nthe instrument. I believe the tenor of the decisions at the North has\r\nbeen to permit the executive upon whom the requisition is made, to\r\ndetermine whether the offence charged is a crime under the law of the\r\nState to which the person charged has fled. If it is a crime, the\r\nfugitive is delivered up. If not a crime in that sense, he is\r\ndischarged. The decisions of the courts have been to the same effect;\r\nwhenever the fugitive has been brought upon _habeas corpus_, the\r\ndecision has been the same. It is obvious that under this construction\r\nof the Constitution no fugitive will be hereafter returned for an\r\noffence in which the question of slavery is involved. This is only one\r\nof the many evasions of the Constitution which have been practised in\r\nthe free States. I deem the amendment very important.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--The gentleman from Kentucky is entirely mistaken in his\r\nstatement of the decisions of the northern courts or northern\r\ngovernors. The decisions are uniform so far as I know, that where the\r\noffence charged is either a crime at common law, or under the statutes\r\nof the State from which the fugitive has fled, he has been delivered\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--Did not the Executive of New York refuse to deliver up a\r\nfugitive on the demand of the Governor of Virginia?\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--In that case I think there was no evidence that the\r\noffence charged was a crime under the statutes of Virginia, and it\r\ncertainly was not at common law.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon Mr. CLAY'S amendment, and resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,\r\n     Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, New\r\n     Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--16.\r\n\r\nAnd the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nAnd on motion, at two o'clock A.M., the Conference adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, TUESDAY, _February 26th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference, pursuant to adjournment, was called to order at eleven\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nPrayer was offered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT informed the Conference that in consequence of the\r\nlength of the Journal of yesterday, the Secretary had not been able to\r\nwrite it out, and that it would be necessary to omit the reading\r\nthereof this morning.\r\n\r\nMr. McCURDY:--There was a vote taken in the confusion near the close\r\nof the session last evening, in which Connecticut, according to the\r\nminutes of the Secretary, appears to have voted in the negative. It\r\nwas upon the amendment of Mr. ORTH, declaring that the slave should be\r\nfree whenever his master had accepted payment for him. On that\r\namendment the vote of Connecticut was Yea. As the vote is recorded Nay\r\nby mistake, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--The motion to reconsider is not necessary. Connecticut\r\ncan record her vote as she wishes to have it stand. It will not change\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the motion is in order, if made by\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nMr. BATTELL:--I will move to reconsider. I voted with the majority.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--No individual delegate can make such\r\na motion. States vote here, not individuals. I submit that the motion\r\nis out of order, unless made by a majority of the delegation.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--The question is not complicated at all; neither is the\r\nmotion out of order. A majority of the delegation from Connecticut\r\ncast the vote of that State in favor of Mr. ORTH'S amendment. By\r\nmistake that vote was recorded against the amendment. The same\r\nmajority whose vote is made to do them injustice by a mistake for\r\nwhich its members are not responsible, now moves to reconsider the\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe question was then taken upon Mr. McCURDY'S motion, and resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Vermont and\r\n     Kansas--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\nAnd the motion prevailed, and the vote was reconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question now recurs upon the amendment offered by\r\nMr. ORTH. On this amendment the vote will be taken by States.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE:--I consider this amendment as entirely unnecessary. The\r\nresult which it seeks to attain is only the announcement of a\r\nwell-understood provision of the common law. By the common law, if an\r\naction is brought for a trespass, and judgment recovered for that\r\ntrespass, and the damages under that judgment paid, the property which\r\nis the subject of the action, and which may have originally been\r\nwrongfully taken, becomes transferred; the damages take the place of\r\nthe property, the defendant has paid for his wrongful act, or, in\r\nother words, has paid for the property. The same principle applies to\r\nthe case of the fugitive slave who is rescued from the custody of the\r\nlaw, when his owner has consented to accept payment for him. The legal\r\nright of the owner in the slave is satisfied by such payment; the\r\nmoney takes the place of the slave. But if this were not so, we ought\r\nnot to encumber the Constitution with such provisions. Congress will\r\nundoubtedly make the proper provision both for the protection of the\r\nslave and his master. Congress will not permit payment to be made for\r\na slave, and then suffer him to go back to bondage. This would be both\r\nunlawful and unjust. I can see no necessity for adopting the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. ORTH:--I understand there is some difference of opinion between\r\nmembers of the Conference as to the effect of the phraseology of my\r\namendment. I will change that phraseology, and make the amendment read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"And such fugitive, after the master has been paid therefor,\r\n     shall be discharged from such service.\"\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky:--I am opposed to this amendment upon every\r\nground. I would rather see some direct scheme of emancipation adopted\r\nand inserted in the Constitution. Adopt this amendment, and the result\r\nis inevitable. It would amount to emancipation upon the largest\r\npossible scale. Our slaves would escape, you would rescue and pay for\r\nthem, and that would be the end of them. Why not leave it to Congress\r\nto pass the necessary laws upon this subject? The adoption of this\r\namendment would destroy all hope that our labors would be acceptable\r\nto the South. I say again, we had better establish emancipation at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--If this amendment is to be adopted, I hope we shall at the\r\nsame time reconsider the vote by which we rejected the amendment of\r\nthe gentleman from North Carolina, requiring the payment by the\r\ncounty, city, or town wherein the slave is rescued from the custody of\r\nthe law. This provision would make the General Government pay for the\r\ncrimes of a few citizens in one section. In that case the General\r\nGovernment ought to own the negro. It has paid for him, and the\r\nproperty in him ought to be transferred.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--There is nothing in this. We do not wish to have the\r\nGovernment own the negro. It is bad enough to have individuals own\r\nslaves. We do not propose to turn the Government into an extensive\r\nslave owner.\r\n\r\nBut let me ask the gentleman seriously, who is to own the negro, in\r\nsuch a case, after he has been paid for? Certainly not the former\r\nowner, because his right is gone. This amendment only states a\r\nconclusion of law; the right of the owner being gone, the negro is\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I think a single word will settle this. By the\r\nConstitution as it now stands, the escaped fugitive is not discharged\r\nfrom service or labor. The original section, as proposed, requires\r\nthat the slave should be paid for, when he is rescued. Now, he might\r\nbe rescued three or four times. Shall he be paid for as often? Do\r\ngentlemen claim that his owner shall receive compensation more than\r\nonce? I cannot see why gentlemen interested in slavery should object\r\nto this amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--I think if gentlemen would look at this proposition\r\nseriously, there would be no difference of opinion among us. Such a\r\nproposition would foist into the Constitution a most injurious,\r\npernicious, and troublesome doctrine. By the most ultra abolitionists\r\nof the free States the power of emancipating our slaves has been\r\ndisclaimed. From the organization of the Government, no such right has\r\nbeen claimed by any respectable party or body of men. The question\r\narose in the first Congress, I think, upon the petition of the Quakers\r\nof Pennsylvania. It was decided almost unanimously against the power,\r\neven when exercised by Congress. But there is no need of multiplying\r\nor citing precedents. From that time to this, no political party has\r\nclaimed the power of emancipation. Such is the universal doctrine now.\r\n\r\nThe right to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia is now\r\nclaimed by some. I think that is the doctrine of Mr. CHASE. But upon\r\nwhat argument is it founded? Simply this: That the States, by the act\r\nof cession, have surrendered this power to Congress. This is the only\r\nargument I have ever heard in favor of the right, even in the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nBut this amendment proposes a most comprehensive scheme of\r\nemancipation. It accomplishes emancipation in every one of the slave\r\nStates. It amounts to forcible emancipation upon the principle of\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThe point has been well stated by gentlemen who have preceded me.\r\nPlace this in the Constitution, and there is an end of returning\r\nfugitives. The very courts will act upon it. They will say that if any\r\none will come forward and pay the value of a slave when arrested, all\r\nthe requirements of the Constitution are satisfied, and he shall go\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of our Conference? Why are we here? We are here to\r\nbury out of sight all the causes of our difference and trouble. And\r\nyet you propose to insert a new principle into our fundamental law,\r\nwhich, however you may look upon it, will be regarded at the South as\r\ntotally inconsistent with our independence. Our people will not\r\nconsent to it.\r\n\r\nThere is another view which I would suggest. This is eminently a\r\nmatter of legislative regulation. If the slave is paid for, Congress\r\nwill at once recognize the impropriety and injustice of permitting the\r\nowner to receive payment for, and also receive his slave. Congress may\r\nsay with great propriety that the owner shall give a bond to return\r\nthe money upon the restoration of his slave. I hope no principle will\r\nbe implanted in the Constitution which will be more troublesome--more\r\nproductive of difficulties than any which has heretofore been made the\r\nsubject of discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--If we do any thing of this kind, perhaps we had better say\r\nthat if the owner accepts compensation for his slave, he shall execute\r\na deed of manumission. This will make it a matter of consent on the\r\npart of the owner. Put the amendment in that form and I will vote for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--This amendment would offer a most powerful inducement to\r\nour slaves to run away. It would be dangerous in the extreme. When a\r\nfugitive has been paid for, and thus emancipated, he can come back and\r\nsettle by the side of his master. What effect would that have upon the\r\nrest of his slaves? Would they not attempt the same thing? It may be\r\nsaid that the States can pass laws which will prevent their return.\r\nBut this power will not be exercised. I know many free negroes in the\r\nslave States who are respectable persons, who own property, and have\r\ntheir social and domestic ties. These examples are bad. A fugitive who\r\nhas been set free is not a safe man to return and settle as a free\r\nnegro among those who were his co-slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--By this amendment you are inaugurating a system of\r\ncovert emancipation to which the South can never submit. We protest\r\nagainst its adoption. The argument upon which you seek to sustain it\r\nis a false one. How can the owner receive the full value of his\r\nrescued slave when he himself, as a citizen and tax-payer, pays a part\r\nof the price?\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I move to amend this amendment by\r\nadding thereto these words:\r\n\r\n     \"And the negro when thus emancipated shall not be permitted\r\n     to leave the State in which the emancipation takes place.\"\r\n\r\nWe know from past experience what the abolitionists of the free States\r\nwould do under such a provision as this in the Constitution. There\r\nwill be an underground railroad line along every principal route of\r\ntravel. There will be depots all along these lines. Canoes will be\r\nfurnished to ferry negroes over the Potomac and Ohio. JOHN BROWN & CO.\r\nwill stand ready to kill the master the very moment he crosses the\r\nline in pursuit of his slave. What officer at the North will dare to\r\narrest the slave when JOHN BROWN pikes are stacked up in every little\r\nvillage? If arrested, there will be organizations formed to rescue\r\nhim, and you may as well let the \"nigger\" go free at once. You are\r\nopening up the greatest scheme of emancipation ever devised.\r\n\r\nMr. BACKUS:--I move to amend the amendment proposed by Mr. ORTH by the\r\nsubstitution of the following:\r\n\r\n     \"And the acceptance of such payment shall preclude the owner\r\n     from further claim to said fugitive.\"\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that this is a scheme of emancipation. It is nothing of\r\nthe sort. It is not intended that the owner shall be obliged to accept\r\ncompensation for his slave. That is left optional with him. He may\r\ntake it or not as he likes. The effect of accepting compensation would\r\nbe just the same as if he sold his slave to the North. The gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia raises a curious objection; that the owner does not\r\nreceive a full compensation because he pays a portion of it himself.\r\nWell, I suppose the owner would pay the one hundred and\r\nthirty-millionth part of the price! Does not the same objection lay\r\nagainst the payment of any tax whatever? It is asked, Does this\r\npayment transfer the legal title to the slave? Well, it probably goes\r\nto the party who pays for it. If the payment is made in a free State,\r\nwhere slavery is not tolerated, the title would not pass at all. I\r\nsubmit to our friends from the South, whether they wish to have the\r\nGovernment become a slave-trader, to set it up as a huckster of slaves\r\nin the shambles. My amendment imposes the responsibility upon\r\nCongress. I have no doubt Congress will legislate properly upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nNow let me say one word to gentlemen, friends of the South, in all\r\nkindness. I have appreciated your position, and it has influenced my\r\naction. I have not refused to give you any reasonable guarantees, and\r\nI shall not refuse them. But I submit to you, whether it is in good\r\ntaste for you to declare that, if we do not yield all these little\r\npoints to you, the Government is to be broken up; that that is the\r\nonly alternative?\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I hope this amendment will be adopted. As a Southern\r\nman, I declare that it is acceptable to me. Let us adopt it, and end\r\nthe matter. [Cries of \"Agreed.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Missouri:--I have a very serious objection to putting\r\nany bid in the Constitution to induce slaves to run away. I firmly\r\nbelieve that if this amendment should ever become a part of the\r\nConstitution, it would lead to the ultimate extinction of slavery. The\r\nState of Missouri is surrounded on three sides by free States. When\r\none of our slaves escapes and crosses the border, he finds himself at\r\nonce among a people, some of whom will vindicate his freedom with\r\ntheir lives. I am willing to leave this whole subject to Congress.\r\nCongress will not permit the owner to get his money, and also retain\r\nhis slave. In the name of God I ask that no such provision may be put\r\ninto the Constitution!\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD:--I will agree to this. The difference between the two is\r\nas wide as the poles.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the amendment as amended, and resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,\r\n     Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North\r\n     Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\n     Tennessee, and Vermont--17.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Indiana, Missouri, and Virginia--3.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMessrs. CLAY, of Kentucky, DENT and ROMAN, of Maryland, STEPHENS and\r\nTOTTEN, of Tennessee, dissented from the votes of their respective\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--It is evident under the rules, as they now stand, that\r\nthis debate is not to close within a month. I move to amend the rules\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Before reaching the final question on the plan to be\r\n     submitted to Congress, no member shall be allowed to speak\r\n     more than three minutes on any proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I rise to a question of order. I submit that the motion\r\nof the gentleman from New York is not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move to lay the amendment on the table.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. GUTHRIE prevailed without a division.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I move to add an additional section to the report, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 8. The Union of the States under the Constitution is\r\n     indissoluble, and no State can secede from the Union, or\r\n     nullify an act of Congress, or absolve its citizens from\r\n     their paramount obligation of obedience to the Constitution\r\n     and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn offering this amendment as an additional section, I propose very\r\nbriefly to state the reasons for its adoption. I shall not anticipate\r\nany of the objections that may be urged against it, for, as I\r\nunderstand the rule, I shall have the right to speak in reply. I will\r\nonly state one or two arguments in favor of the article.\r\n\r\nWe have been discussing the means of removing the symptoms of the\r\ndisease called secession. This amendment attacks the disease itself.\r\nThe doctrines of CALHOUN, originated and advocated by him, have now\r\nbeen taken up by his followers, who are striking at the very\r\nfoundation of our Government. The doctrine of the North is, that no\r\nState can secede from the Union. This amendment asserts that doctrine.\r\nBefore we begin to amend, we ought to know whether we have any\r\nConstitution to amend. The people of my section wish to know whether\r\nwe can compel obedience of a State, if every man in it undertakes to\r\nrefuse obedience. They believe that power to exist in the Constitution\r\nnow. If there is any doubt about it, they wish that power distinctly\r\nasserted.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I move to lay the amendment on the table at present,\r\nwithout affecting the section of the report under consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--This motion is debatable.\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I submit that the motion of the gentleman from New\r\nYork is not an amendment; that it is an addition, and may be laid on\r\nthe table without affecting the remainder of the report.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--We have now gone through with the propositions, and are\r\nready to take a final vote upon them. Mr. FIELD'S amendment is\r\nproperly an addition, and relates entirely to other subjects. Laying\r\nthat on the table does not carry the whole subject there.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. EWING prevailed by the following vote: Ayes, 11;\r\nNoes, 10.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: I relied upon the Journal for the individual list of the\r\nvotes. In this respect the Journal is defective, and does not give the\r\nnames of the States voting. My minutes show that the vote was taken by\r\nStates with the foregoing result.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. MEREDITH, WILMOT, and CHASE dissented from the votes of their\r\nrespective States.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I now offer it as an amendment to the 7th section.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I rise to a point of order. My colleague has proposed\r\nthis amendment as an additional section, and it has been laid upon the\r\ntable. He now proposes to put the same thing in another place. That is\r\ncertainly not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I now offer it distinctly as an amendment to the 7th\r\nsection, to avoid the quibbling by which a direct vote was avoided\r\nbefore. It may as well be understood that other than slave States have\r\ncertain rights upon this floor, and that those rights will be\r\nasserted. I wish gentlemen to understand that I shall resist, as well\r\nas I may, every attempt to avoid or dodge this question.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--In the opinion of the Chair it is not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Then I offer one-half the amendment as follows: \"The Union\r\nof the States, under the Constitution, is indissoluble.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Is it necessary to put this into the Constitution?\r\nDoes not the gentleman think the Constitution prohibits secession now?\r\nIf so, let him offer a resolution to that effect, and I will vote for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I rise to a point of order. The amendment is not germane to\r\nthe section.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--That is entirely a matter of opinion. The Chair cannot\r\nrule out an amendment on that ground.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--If gentlemen will give us a square vote on my proposition,\r\nI will not debate it.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I believe every word that is stated in that\r\nproposition. It is all in the Constitution now; but the South thinks\r\ndifferently, and this is one of the great obstructions in our path.\r\nThere is not a man here who does not believe that this provision is\r\nalready in the Constitution. I hope, therefore, that we shall vote at\r\nonce, and vote it down.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--The amendment proposed, implies the existence of the right\r\nof secession, under the present Constitution. I do not believe in\r\nthat, and shall therefore vote against it.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--I desire to obtain a clear vote upon this question, and\r\nnot have it pass off upon any technical points. I will withdraw my\r\namendment, and now move to amend the 7th section by striking out the\r\nwhole of it, and inserting in its place the following:\r\n\r\n     \"No State shall withdraw from the Union without the consent\r\n     of all the States, given in a Convention of the States,\r\n     convened in pursuance of an act passed by two-thirds of each\r\n     House of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GOODRICH:--I do not quite like the language of the amendment, for\r\nit might seem to give the implication of a right to secede. I move the\r\nfollowing as a substitute:\r\n\r\n     \"And no State can secede from the Union, or nullify an act\r\n     of Congress, or absolve its citizens from their paramount\r\n     obligations of obedience to the Constitution and laws of the\r\n     United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--There is no objection on my part\r\nagainst the gentleman from New York taking any course he pleases, and\r\nas much time as he likes; but I should regret extremely to have this\r\namendment adopted, and to have the Constitution made practically to\r\nassert a right of secession. I have denied that right always in my\r\nState, in public and in private. I am aware that on this point I\r\ndiffer from the general sentiment of the South, and I hold there is no\r\nright of secession, and on the part of the General Government no right\r\nof coercion. I claim that a State has no right to secede, because that\r\nright is not found in the Constitution, and the theory of the\r\nConstitution is against it.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think the amendment of Mr. GOODRICH is not in order.\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--As suggested by a friend, I will modify my motion, and\r\nstate it in this way, which certainly will avoid all these\r\nobjections:\r\n\r\n     \"It is declared to be the true intent and meaning of the\r\n     present Constitution, that the Union of the States under it\r\n     is indissoluble.\"\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--Does the gentleman mean this as a substitute for the\r\nentire report of the committee, for all that we have hitherto done?\r\n\r\nMr. FIELD:--Certainly not.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--We have not met here for any such purpose as that\r\nindicated in the present amendment. We are not here to discuss the\r\nquestion of secession. We are here because the Border States are\r\nalarmed for their own safety. We wish them to remain in the Union. The\r\npurpose of our consultations is to make an arrangement under which\r\nthey can stay in the Union. If we do not confine ourselves to that\r\npurpose, and leave these questions alone, our differences may be\r\nsubmitted to a greater than any human judge. I hope, in Heaven's name,\r\nthey will not be submitted to the arbitrament of battle. No practical\r\ngood whatever can come from debating this amendment. I move to lay it\r\non the table; but if that motion will have the effect to carry the\r\nwhole report on the table, I will not make it.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I shall vote against this amendment. I believe the\r\nConstitution is endowed with sufficient authority to accomplish its\r\nown preservation, and to carry into execution its own laws; and,\r\nbelieving so, I deny the right of secession, but the right of\r\nrevolution is a natural right possessed by every people. They may\r\nrevolutionize their governments when they become oppressive. The\r\nConstitution was adopted as the logical consequence of this idea.\r\nThere is no use now in discussing the abstract question of secession.\r\nWe must treat the present condition of the Gulf States as a revolution\r\nin fact accomplished. We must meet them fairly. I vote against this\r\namendment, and wish to stand right upon the record. If the history of\r\nthis Convention is to be written, I do not wish to be handed down to\r\nposterity as one who favors the right of secession, which I believe to\r\nbe a radical error.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--Pennsylvania is agreed in principle upon the doctrine of\r\nthis amendment. I believe the whole North agrees also that the right\r\nof secession cannot be conceded, but my colleagues and myself differ\r\nessentially as to the manner in which we shall make our doctrine most\r\neffective. I think the true way is, to vote for this plain\r\nproposition, and not vote against it.\r\n\r\nNow, all the North agrees that there is no right under the\r\nConstitution to interfere with slavery where it exists. No one has\r\never asserted such right, or believed in it. We are now asked to give\r\na declaratory provision on that subject--to give it in order to quiet\r\nthe slave States. One of my colleagues--Mr. POLLOCK--was willing to\r\ngive that declaratory clause, which was necessary. I went with him in\r\nthat; I now ask him to go with me, not against a mere shadow, but\r\nagainst what is the doctrine of a large portion of the people of the\r\nslave States; a doctrine of that proportion which proposes to\r\noverthrow the Constitution of the country. It is a demoralizing\r\ndoctrine. My colleague proposes to vote against it. Did my colleague\r\nbelieve that any one proposed to interfere with slavery in the States?\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--No, I do not believe there was any such intention\r\nentertained by any considerable party. But there was an apprehension\r\nupon this subject in the slave States, caused by the action of a few\r\nradical men at the North. I was willing to vote for a declaratory\r\nresolution to quiet that apprehension.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--This amendment points to something more than an\r\napprehension. It deals with an existing fact. Seven States have\r\nalready gone out of the Union, asserting that the principal allegiance\r\nof their people is to the State, and not to the General Government. I\r\nthink it high time that the Constitution was made unequivocal upon\r\nthis subject of secession.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE:--I occupy even a few minutes of time with much reluctance.\r\nTime is precious to us--too precious to be used in debate. I believe\r\nin the doctrine of the gentleman from New York. That is the doctrine\r\nof my State; but I believe in a great many other things which it is\r\nnot necessary to insert in the Constitution. We came here to treat a\r\nfact, a great fact. There is a Southern Confederacy--there is a\r\nPresident DAVIS--there is a Government organized within the Union\r\nhostile to the United States. I came here, as the gentleman from\r\nIllinois has said, to act as if I had never given a vote or united\r\nwith a political party. I say, with my colleague, that when the\r\ncountry is in danger my political robes hang loosely upon my\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThere is an element in this Conference which, from the first day of\r\nour session, has opposed any action. Its policy has been to distract\r\nand divide our counsels, to put off every thing, to prevent all\r\naction. How different this is from what I expected when I came here.\r\nShall we sit here debating abstract questions when State after State\r\nis seceding? I hope not. I trust the patriotic spirit which animates a\r\nmajority of this Conference will to-day send forth a proposition which\r\nwill restore peace to the country. We all agree to the principle\r\ncontained in this amendment; but if we adopt it and make it a part of\r\nthe Constitution, we could never, under it, bring back the seceded\r\nStates. They will not admit the principle. What is to be gained, then,\r\nby adopting it? Why will gentlemen insist upon propositions which will\r\nnullify our action? New Jersey occupies high constitutional ground.\r\nShe is ready to do any thing that is fair, and she goes for these\r\npropositions of the majority because they are fair. She will adopt\r\nthese, and I believe every State will adopt them--New York as quickly\r\nas any. I do not think the gentleman properly represents the wishes of\r\nhis constituents. He misrepresents them. Let us act, then, promptly,\r\nand act now. Every moment is precious. I know the trembling anxiety\r\nwith which the country is awaiting our action. Do not let us sit here\r\nlike the great Belshazzar till the handwriting appears on the wall.\r\nLet us set our faces against delay. Let us put down with an indignant\r\nrebuke every attempt to demoralize our action or destroy its effect.\r\n\r\nMr. BUCKNER:--I move to amend the amendment of Mr. FIELD, by adding\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     \"But this declaration shall not be construed so as to give\r\n     the Federal Government power or authority to coerce or to\r\n     make war directly or indirectly upon a State, on account of\r\n     a failure to comply with its obligations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FRELINGHUYSEN:--I hope the gentleman from New York will withdraw\r\nhis resolution. The view of this Convention is against secession, and\r\nwe all know that the Union of the States under the Constitution is\r\nindissoluble. We know just as well that it is not necessary to assert\r\nthis principle now. It is not expedient to assert it. We want to get\r\nback the seceded States. If we are earnest in this, is it best to call\r\nthem traitors? I ask the gentleman whether the rejection of his\r\nproposition will not tend to weaken the Government and the Union? It\r\nwill stand as a naked vote of rejection; the reasons why we vote\r\nagainst it will not go before the world.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--With the exception of a few minutes between eleven and\r\ntwelve o'clock, a few nights since, I have not occupied the time or\r\nattention of the Conference. I will not now occupy but a few minutes.\r\nI came here to do something. I supposed we could accomplish something.\r\nWe learned very soon after our arrival here that my colleague was\r\nopposed to any amendment of the Constitution. The same is true of\r\nseveral of my colleagues; perhaps a majority of them are here to do\r\nnothing. I supposed that something ought to be done to quiet the\r\ncountry. Instead of that an amendment is now offered asserting that we\r\ndo not believe in the right of secession, that we do believe that\r\nthese States which have seceded have done wrong. Suppose we do not\r\nbelieve in secession, what relevance has that to the present subject?\r\nSuch an amendment may be used to delay or embarrass our action. There\r\nare a good many ways to defeat the project, a good many ways to\r\nsuppress secession. My colleague looks to force alone. He proposes to\r\nbring back the seceded States by force. I contemplate the use of force\r\nin this connection with horror. It can never be used successfully.\r\n\r\nWe are here to agree upon something which will give peace to the\r\ncountry. Our committee has submitted a report which they think will\r\naccomplish that. My colleagues are skilful; they know how many ways\r\nthere are to accomplish their purposes. One way to defeat any action\r\nhere is by making long speeches, by loading down the propositions of\r\namendment to the Constitution with other amendments, which will make\r\nthe whole thing offensive to the country.\r\n\r\nI stand here for my country. I would leave politics and political\r\nparties in the back ground. I would vote for nothing here which is not\r\npertinent to the Constitution, and which will not help us in our\r\nattempts to quiet the apprehensions of our fellow-citizens. My\r\ncolleague now brings forward a proposition which may be true in\r\nitself, but it is not pertinent and amounts to nothing. I am sorry he\r\nis not in his seat to hear what I have to say. He shot his arrow, and,\r\nI understand, has left for New York.\r\n\r\nI am ready to vote down his proposition. I wish to see it voted down.\r\nI am prepared to take all the consequences of voting it down, here and\r\nelsewhere. But I have drawn an amendment myself which I offer in lieu\r\nof his. Permit me to read it:\r\n\r\n     \"While we do not recognize the constitutional right of any\r\n     State to secede from the Union, we are deeply impressed by\r\n     the fact that this Government is not maintained by force,\r\n     but by unity of origin and interest, inducing fraternal\r\n     feelings between the people of different sections of the\r\n     country; and our labors have been directed to the end of\r\n     giving a new assurance to our brethren, North, South, East,\r\n     and West, of our determination to stand firmly by all the\r\n     compromises of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nI think we can vote for this amendment. It denies the right of\r\nsecession as explicitly as the amendment of my colleague. But it has\r\nno coercion about it, and it asserts, as I understand it, the true\r\nprinciple upon which our Government is founded. I offer it as an\r\nexpression of my own views. I have sat here for eight or ten days and\r\nhave voted, except in a few instances, with the delegation from my own\r\nState. There is a bare majority of that delegation against the\r\npropositions of the committee. That majority ordinarily casts the vote\r\nof our State. I cannot express my views by my votes, and for that\r\nreason I undertake to express them in this amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. KING:--Like my colleague, I have taken but little part in the\r\ndiscussions in this Conference. I cannot be justly charged with having\r\noccupied time unnecessarily, as I have spoken on but one occasion, and\r\nthen very briefly. I would not speak now if I did not sincerely\r\nbelieve this amendment to be eminently proper for the consideration of\r\nthis body.\r\n\r\nMyself and the majority of my colleagues differ from the majority of\r\nthe Conference. That difference is an honest difference of opinion. It\r\nis based upon principle. If we consulted policy only, it would give us\r\npleasure to yield to the wishes of the majority. But our first duty is\r\nto our constituents, and we must represent their opinions here. We\r\nshould do it because our opinions coincide with theirs; and it was\r\nbecause we entertained these opinions that we were selected to\r\nrepresent New York in this body. When we are called upon to vote, we\r\nshall vote to carry out those opinions; and even when we differ from\r\nsome of our colleagues, we are entitled to the same consideration from\r\nthis body that they are. We do not intend to be driven from our\r\nposition by threats or by intimidation. We believe that it is\r\neminently proper for this Conference to express its decided\r\nconvictions upon the question of secession. We are told here that\r\nsecession is a fact. Then let us deal with it as such. I go for the\r\nenforcement of the laws passed in pursuance of the Constitution. I\r\nwill never give up the idea that this is a Government of the people,\r\nand possessing within itself the power of enforcing its own decrees.\r\nThis I shall never do. This Conference could perform no nobler act\r\nthan that of sending to the country the announcement that the union of\r\nthe States under the Constitution is indissoluble, and that secession\r\nis but another term for rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from New Jersey says we misrepresent our constituents.\r\nHow does he know that? Who gave him the right to place himself between\r\nour constituents and ourselves--to sit in judgment upon us? He will\r\nfind that statement a very adventurous one. I should know something\r\nabout New York and the people of New York. I have lived in that State\r\nall my life. I have been honored by the confidence and support of my\r\nfellow-citizens. Let me assure the gentleman that I know the people of\r\nthat State far better than he. We will undertake to answer to our\r\nconstituents; let him answer to his.\r\n\r\nI will occupy no farther time. I wish to live in peace and harmony\r\nwith our brethren in the slave States. But I wish to put upon the\r\nrecord here a statement of the fact that this is a Government of the\r\npeople, and not a compact of States.\r\n\r\nMr. PALMER:--It is no part of my business or duty to vindicate the\r\nmotives or conduct of the gentleman from New York, who is charged by\r\none of his colleagues with interposing his amendment only for the\r\npurpose of delay. But that amendment meets my approval, and will have\r\nmy support without regard to such imputations. Of what consequence are\r\nthe gentleman's motives to us if his motion is right and proper? Are\r\nwe to be gravely told that secession and treason are not proper\r\nsubjects for our consideration? To be told this when every mail that\r\ncomes to us from the South is loaded with both these crimes? Sir, we\r\nhave commenced wrong. The first thing we ought to have done was to\r\ndeclare that these were crimes, and that we would not negotiate with\r\nthose who denied the authority of the Government, and claimed to have\r\nthrown off their allegiance to it. Far better would it be for the\r\ncountry if, instead of debating the question of slavery in reference\r\nto our Territories, we had set to work to strengthen the hands of the\r\nGovernment, and to put down the treason which threatens its existence.\r\n\r\nYou, gentlemen of the slave States, say that we of the North use fair\r\nwords, that we promise fairly, but you insist that you will not rely\r\nupon our promises, and you demand our bond as security that we will\r\nkeep them. I return the statement to you with interest. You,\r\ngentlemen, talk fairly also--give us your bond! You have been talking\r\nfairly for the last dozen or twenty years, and yet this treason, black\r\nas night, has been plotted among you, and twelve years ago one of your\r\nstatesmen predicted the very state of things which now exists. I am\r\nwilling to give bonds, but I want our action in this respect to be\r\nreciprocal. I want your bond against secession, and I ask it because\r\nseven States in sympathy with you have undertaken to set up an\r\nindependent Government--have placed over it a military chieftain who\r\nasserts that we, the people of the United States, are foreigners, and\r\nmust be treated with as a foreign nation.\r\n\r\nYou charged JOHN BROWN with treason. You convicted and executed him;\r\nand yet among you are thousands of men guilty of treason, beside which\r\nthat of JOHN BROWN was paltry and insignificant. If we are to act at\r\nall, gentlemen, we must act upon reciprocal terms. I am willing to\r\nmake every reasonable concession. Will you do the same? Will you,\r\ngentlemen of the South, declare that you will stand by the Union, and\r\nbrand secession as treasonable? If you will, you must vote for this\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD:--I am sure no member of this Conference could have\r\nlistened to the remarks of the two gentlemen who have last spoken\r\nwithout the deepest regret. It has been intimated here that Maryland\r\nwill secede unless she secures these guarantees. I do not know whether\r\nshe will or not. I know there is danger that she will.\r\n\r\nI agree that there is no _right_ of secession. I think that secession\r\nis revolution. But the right of revolution always exists. It has\r\nalways been maintained by statesmen North and South. It was admitted\r\nby WEBSTER in his reply to HAYNE. I would read a quotation from his\r\nspeech if time was not so valuable.\r\n\r\nYes, gentlemen, we are all in danger. The storm is raging; Virginia\r\nhas hung her flag at half-mast as a signal of distress. If Virginia\r\nsecedes our State will go with her, hand in hand, with Providence as\r\nour guide. This is not intended as a threat. GOD forbid! It is a truth\r\nwhich we cannot and ought not to conceal.\r\n\r\nWhy will not New York and Massachusetts for once be magnanimous? Why\r\nwill they not follow the glorious example of Rhode Island? If they\r\nwill, I should still have hope. But if those two great States are\r\nagainst us, I can see nothing but gloom in the future.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH:--I hope the true state of the question will not be lost\r\nsight of. The first question is on the motion of the gentleman from\r\nMissouri, to amend the proposition of my colleague. On that I rise to\r\na point of order. The motion of the gentleman from Missouri is a\r\ndistinct proposition, and inconsistent with that offered by Mr. FIELD.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I do not think the point of order is well taken.\r\n\r\nThe question upon agreeing to the amendment of Mr. BUCKNER was then\r\ntaken by States, with the following result:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, and\r\n     Virginia--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--15.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--My motion is now in order as an amendment. I insist that\r\nthe question should be taken upon its adoption.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--Does the gentleman propose to put this into the\r\nConstitution? If the gentleman wishes to publish it as his speech, I\r\nwill agree to it.\r\n\r\nThe question on the adoption of Mr. BRONSON'S motion was taken _viva\r\nvoce_, and the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question now recurs on the amendment offered by\r\nthe gentleman from New York--Mr. FIELD.\r\n\r\nMr. RIVES:--I hope the Conference will pardon me for saying a few\r\nwords upon this motion. I feel so sensibly the gravity of the\r\nconsequences involved in the result of this vote, that I ask for a few\r\nminutes only in which to beseech the Conference not to act now upon a\r\nmere abstraction.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, what have we come here for? We have come at a time when the\r\nGovernment of our country is in great peril; and after a long session\r\nof diligent labor, and when we are just upon the point of arriving at\r\nthe satisfactory adjustment of our differences, we have these abstract\r\nquestions thrust upon us. They do not belong here. They ought not to\r\nbe considered here. They would better befit a debating society than an\r\nassembly of statesmen met to consider constitutional questions. The\r\ngentleman (Governor KING) of New York announces his theory that this\r\nis a Government of the people and not a compact of the States. While I\r\nshould agree with him upon his conclusions, we should differ widely as\r\nto the premises from which they are derived. It is a compact. All the\r\nauthorities say so; and like any other compact, it is one from which\r\neach independent party may withdraw.\r\n\r\nNow, what is this proposed amendment but an abstraction? In theory,\r\nthe union of the States under the Constitution is indissoluble. But\r\nhow is it in fact? It is now a fact that the Union is disrupted, is\r\ndissolved, because certain of the States composing it have withdrawn.\r\nBut this is no time to discuss these questions. While we are talking\r\nabout abstractions, we are wasting our time. I do not propose to\r\nenlarge upon the observations I have already submitted. But I beseech\r\nyou, one and all, recognizing every member of the Conference as a\r\nbrother of a common family, that now, after the labor of three weeks,\r\nand upon the very verge of adjustment, you should not destroy all we\r\nhave done by interposing questions of this kind. Do not let us be seen\r\nengaged in the idle labor of Sisyphus. Do not let us now, just as we\r\nare about placing on the top of the mountain the block of\r\nconstitutional adjustment, suffer that block to rebound. Dismiss the\r\namendment with, I pray you earnestly, all questions of this sort, and\r\nlet us proceed to the practical matters involved in the report, and\r\nits adoption.\r\n\r\nMr. NOYES:--If my colleague who offered this amendment, was not at\r\nthis time absent, I should not address the Conference at all. I should\r\nlike, however, to know what possible dangerous consequence we may\r\nanticipate from the adoption of this clause. Whether this Union is a\r\ncompact of the States or a Government of the people, is equally\r\nunimportant in this connection. In either case it is not to be broken\r\nup at pleasure. If it is claimed either that the right exists\r\nalready--if it is apprehended that the people themselves may assert\r\nthe right to overthrow the Constitution and destroy the Government at\r\npleasure--we should not, by all means, pass this amendment.\r\n\r\nThe slave power has now had possession of the Government in all for\r\nmore than fifty years. A President has been elected belonging to the\r\nopposing party. For that cause alone, and without claiming or\r\nassigning any other, the slave States, under the powerful protection\r\nof Virginia, have come here for guarantees. We are told, over and over\r\nagain, that seven States have left the Union. There is a fact with\r\nwhich we have to deal. On our side, we are merely dealing with\r\napprehensions. If you have a right to guarantees to quiet your\r\napprehensions, have we not a right to insist that secession shall be\r\nput down and condemned by an explicit clause of the Constitution? It\r\nis this claim of the right of secession which has brought all the\r\ntrouble upon the country. We are right in our claim that it should be\r\ndealt with in this Conference. If we, as delegates, should prove\r\nfaithless to our trust, should yield you all the guarantees you ask,\r\nand should insist upon nothing on our side, such action would not\r\navail you any thing.\r\n\r\nThe North and the people of the North must be satisfied upon this\r\npoint. Much has been said here about the right of revolution. I do not\r\npropose to discuss that right. At all events that is not a right which\r\ndepends upon the Constitution, or grows out of it. If it exists at\r\nall, it is higher than, and above all Constitutions. The statement in\r\nthis amendment does not controvert the right of revolution. It is\r\nsimply a statement that _the Union of the States, under the\r\nConstitution, is indissoluble_. I regard the adoption of this\r\namendment as both expedient and essential.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER, of Illinois:--I do not think this amendment very important\r\neither way. If this is intended as a mere declaration of the purposes\r\nof the Constitution, it may be well enough. But will the assertion\r\nthat such is the purpose of the Constitution preserve that instrument\r\nand the Government under it? No, sir. We may call spirits from the\r\nvasty deep; but the question is, will they come?\r\n\r\nIf the right of secession exists at all, it is not confined to the\r\nSouth. If it is conceded at all, it must be conceded in much broader\r\nterms--in terms that are common to all the States. This amendment\r\nsecures to the States no practical benefit. I protest against being\r\nbound to harmonize on all abstract questions. This is an abstraction.\r\nGentlemen schooled in deduction could spend weeks in argument over it.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken upon the amendment proposed by Mr. FIELD, and\r\nresulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\r\n     and Virginia--11.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was disagreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I now submit that we ought to take the vote on the\r\nsubstitute proposed by the gentleman from Connecticut. I trust we are\r\nthrough with speeches, and hope we shall now get to some result. We\r\nmay as well vote upon all these propositions within the next hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SOMES:--I desire to move an amendment by adding the following, to\r\nbe numbered\r\n\r\n     SECTION 8. \"That the freedom of speech, or of the press,\r\n     shall not be abridged; but that the people of any Territory\r\n     of the United States shall be left perfectly free to discuss\r\n     the subject of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--I move to lay that amendment on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. SOMES:--Is not that motion debatable?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It is not debatable.\r\n\r\nThe motion to lay the amendment offered by Mr. SOMES upon the table,\r\nprevailed by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\n     Tennessee, Virginia, and Kansas--13.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, and Vermont--5.\r\n\r\nThus the amendment was laid upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. VANDEVER:--I move to amend the report by the addition of the\r\nfollowing section:\r\n\r\n     \"The navigation of the Mississippi River shall remain free\r\n     to the people of each and all the States; and Congress shall\r\n     provide by law for the protection of commerce on said river\r\n     against all interference, foreign or domestic.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of this proposition can be seen at once. It is one in\r\nwhich the whole country is interested, especially that portion of it\r\nin which I reside, which is drained by the upper waters of the\r\nMississippi and Missouri. On this subject we have our apprehensions,\r\nand they are better founded, too, than any which I have heard from the\r\nSouth. We believe that our right to the navigation of this great\r\nnational highway is imperilled. I submit whether we are to be\r\ncavalierly treated in this matter, and whether a subject of so much\r\nimportance is to be laid upon the table? We may at all events, with\r\nperfect propriety, go this far, and make it, under the Constitution,\r\nthe duty of Congress to protect the free navigation of the Mississippi\r\nRiver by law. We want it understood that the navigation of that river\r\nshould be free and unobstructed, and that the faith of the nation is\r\npledged to enforce that right. HENRY CLAY once stated that nothing\r\nupon earth could induce him to agree to any thing that should impede\r\nthe free navigation of that river. I assert and repeat his\r\ndeclaration. We of the Northwest ask that this right should be\r\nguaranteed to us.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--I am as anxious for the free navigation of the\r\nMississippi River as the gentleman. I wish simply to say that it is\r\nmade the duty of the people of Iowa, and of other States bounded by\r\nthis river, to protect that right of navigation. But the amendment is\r\nnot germane to the report of the committee. I move to lay it on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. CRISFIELD prevailed by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia--14.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     and New York--6.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was laid on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. BALDWIN:--I move that my substitute be taken up, and ask that it\r\nmay be read.\r\n\r\nIt was read as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_ unhappy differences exist, which have alienated\r\n     from each other portions of the people of the United States,\r\n     to such an extent as seriously to disturb the peace of the\r\n     nation and impair the regular and efficient action of the\r\n     Government within the sphere of its constitutional powers\r\n     and duties;\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, the Legislature of the State of Kentucky has\r\n     made application to Congress to call a Convention for\r\n     proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States;\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, it is believed to be the opinion of the\r\n     people of other States that amendments to the Constitution\r\n     are, or may become, necessary to secure to the people of the\r\n     United States, of every section, the full and equal\r\n     enjoyment of their rights and liberties, so far as the same\r\n     may depend for their security and protection on the powers\r\n     granted to or withheld from the General Government in\r\n     pursuance of the national purposes for which it was ordained\r\n     and established:\r\n\r\n     This Convention does therefore recommend to the several\r\n     States to unite with Kentucky in her application to Congress\r\n     to call a Convention for proposing amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, to be submitted to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States, or to Conventions\r\n     therein, for ratification, as the one or the other mode of\r\n     ratification may be proposed by Congress, in accordance with\r\n     the provision in the fifth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI propose to avail myself of the privilege of a short reply to the\r\narguments against my proposition; and in order that I may occupy as\r\nlittle time as possible, I have reduced my reply to writing. At the\r\nrisk of repeating some of the remarks I made at the opening of the\r\ndiscussion, I wish to recur to the facts on which my report is based.\r\n\r\nThe resolution which I have moved to substitute, recommends to the\r\nseveral States to unite with Kentucky in her application for the\r\ncalling of a Convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of January, seven days before the assembling of this\r\nConference Convention, the Governor of Kentucky transmitted to the\r\nPresident of the United States the joint resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly of that Commonwealth, \"recommending a call for a Convention\r\nof the United States,\" with a request that the President would lay the\r\nsame before Congress; and on the 5th of February, the day after the\r\nassembling of this Convention, they were, by a special message of the\r\nPresident, communicated to Congress, with the expression of great\r\nsatisfaction in the performance of that duty, and of confidence that\r\nCongress would bestow upon those resolutions the careful consideration\r\ndue to the distinguished and patriotic source from which they\r\nproceeded, as well as to the great importance of the subject which\r\nthey involve. The resolution requesting the call of a Convention I\r\nhave already read to the Conference.\r\n\r\nThere are, sir, but two modes provided by the people of the United\r\nStates for altering the fundamental law of their Government, both of\r\nwhich are specified in the fifth article of the Constitution:\r\n\r\n     1. Congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses _shall deem\r\n     it necessary_, shall PROPOSE amendments to the Constitution;\r\n     or,\r\n\r\n     2. On the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of\r\n     the several States, shall _call a Convention_ for PROPOSING\r\n     _amendments_, which, in either case, shall be valid as part\r\n     of the Constitution, when _ratified_ by the Legislatures, or\r\n     by Conventions in _three-fourths_ of the States.\r\n\r\nThe first mode is recommended by the majority of the committee, in the\r\nexpectation that Congress, by a two-thirds vote of both houses, will\r\npropose, on the request of this Convention, for ratification by the\r\nStates, the several amendments they have reported.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is the one proposed by the Legislature of Kentucky,\r\nand which, in accordance therewith, I have moved to substitute for the\r\nrecommendation of the committee.\r\n\r\nThere are now but few days remaining before the termination of the\r\nfunctions of the present Congress. If it were within the fair scope\r\nand interest of the constitutional provision that Congress should act,\r\nin the proposing of amendments, on the recommendation of this\r\nConference Convention, no one, I think, can reasonably expect them to\r\nconsider and deliberately act on such recommendation during the few\r\nremaining days of the present Congress. Other questions, of engrossing\r\ninterest, now pending before them, and the acts of necessary\r\nlegislation at the close of the session, will prevent it. It must,\r\ntherefore, go over to the next Congress. Assuming that during the term\r\nof that Congress the amendments recommended by this Convention shall,\r\nby two-thirds of both houses, be _deemed necessary_, and be proposed\r\nto the States for ratification; there would probably be no earlier\r\nfinal action by the requisite number of States, than in the mode\r\nproposed by Kentucky, and recommended by the resolution which I have\r\nmoved to substitute for the mode of amendment reported by the\r\ncommittee. But the great objection, in my mind, to the mode of\r\namendment contemplated by the majority report, is that it is not in\r\naccordance with either the letter or the spirit of the Constitution.\r\nThe people of the United States intended, when they adopted the\r\nConstitution under which we have for more than seventy years enjoyed a\r\nhigher degree of prosperity than has fallen to the lot of any other\r\npeople, that it should remain in full force and unchanged, except in\r\none of the two modes prescribed in that sacred instrument for its own\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nIt is a Constitution which binds the people of every State, as the\r\nsupreme law of the land, until it can be changed by the action, in the\r\nfirst instance, of those who are _sworn_ to support it. No amendments\r\ncan, consistently with the letter or the spirit of the Constitution,\r\nbe _proposed_ by Congress, unless two-thirds of both houses, acting\r\nunder the responsibility of their official oaths, shall \"_deem_ them\r\n_necessary_.\" No interference or pressure by any extraneous body\r\nunknown to the Constitution, was contemplated, or can be allowed with\r\nsafety to the people, to impair the exercise of this function under\r\nall the responsibilities and official sanctions that properly\r\nappertain to it. The judgment of two-thirds of both houses of Congress\r\nin regard to the _necessity_ of the amendments, must precede their\r\nproposal to the States for _ratification_.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States, in its sphere of duties, is\r\nsupreme. The State Governments, when they consented to its formation\r\nby the people of the United States, surrendered so much of their\r\nseparate sovereignties as was essential to its strength and\r\nefficiency. To that extent we became one people. This Government, for\r\nall _national_ purposes, took the place of the State Governments, as\r\nwell in regard to the _paramount allegiance_ as to the duty of\r\nprotection of the people of every State in the enjoyment of all their\r\nfederal rights. Its powers can neither be enlarged nor diminished,\r\nexcept in the _constitutional_ mode, without violating the rights of\r\nthe States as well as of the people.\r\n\r\nAny attempt from without, by combinations and associations not\r\nresponsible to the people, to _coerce_ or overawe Congress, or in any\r\nway to impair the free and _deliberate_ exercise of its judgment in\r\n_proposing_ amendments \"as deemed _necessary_\" by Congress, is a\r\npalpable violation of the privileges of the people. They elected the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives with the intention that they\r\nshould freely and deliberately, under their official oaths, propose\r\namendments, or not, to the Constitution, as _they_ might _deem\r\nnecessary_, and not at the dictation of _States even_, who cannot\r\nthemselves propose amendments, but can only require of Congress to\r\ncall a Convention of _all the States_ for that purpose. Much less can\r\na convention of delegates from the Legislatures, or the Executive of a\r\npart only of the States--a body unknown to, and unauthorized by, the\r\nConstitution--assume to exercise, or dictate to Congress the exercise\r\nof this high prerogative.\r\n\r\nWE do not represent the people of the United States. This Government,\r\nfor every purpose for which it was established, is a separate, and in\r\nsome sense a foreign government to the States. It operates directly on\r\nthe people, and is itself their true protector in all their Federal\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nAny number of States, less than two-thirds, have no more right to call\r\ninto action the power of Congress either to call a Convention, or to\r\npropose amendments, than the individual members of their Legislatures\r\nin their private capacities; and Congress might as well, and probably\r\nwould, treat our interference with their official duties as an\r\n_usurpation_; as much so as if we should seek to interfere with the\r\nappropriate duties of the Legislatures of Virginia or Massachusetts.\r\nAnd, sir, I cannot but regard it, so far as the _free_ action of\r\nCongress should be influenced by the recommendations of this body, as\r\nin the nature of a _revolutionary proceeding_ for which there is no\r\nsufficient cause or justification. Sir, all the States are not here\r\nrepresented. All have not even had an opportunity to be here. And yet\r\nwe are endeavoring to influence the action of Congress in a manner\r\nwhich may deeply affect their interests. If, under any circumstances,\r\na body so convened, would have a right to act upon Congress, by the\r\nexpression of our opinions as a Convention of States, ought not all to\r\nhave an opportunity to participate in our deliberations? Most\r\ncertainly they ought.\r\n\r\nBut it is said some of the States are threatening to secede from the\r\nUnion; others have seceded, and must be induced to come back, by the\r\nspeedy action of Congress on the amendments recommended by the\r\ncommittee. Does the _Constitution_ authorize amendments under such\r\ncircumstances, with _less care_ and deliberation than in time of peace\r\nand tranquillity?\r\n\r\nThis Government, sir, cannot recognize the fact that _States_ have\r\nseceded. It is not a Government over _States_, but over the _people_\r\nof the United States, irrespective of the State in which they live.\r\nThis Government, and not the States, protects them in their Federal\r\nrights, and requires allegiance and obedience from the people in every\r\nState, to the Constitution and laws of the United States as the\r\nsupreme law of the land, any thing in the laws or ordinances of any\r\nState to the contrary notwithstanding. It is the _people_ and not the\r\nStates that are governed by that law, within the sphere of its\r\nconstitutional operation.\r\n\r\nI have said that the course proposed by the majority of the committee\r\nis, in my judgment, not only against the letter, but the spirit of the\r\nConstitution. The State of Kentucky, ever patriotic and conservative,\r\nmust have so regarded it, when, instead of asking Congress to propose\r\nthe amendments they desired, they requested their sister States to\r\nunite with them in an application in the mode prescribed by the\r\nConstitution to Congress to call a Convention for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOur fathers, who framed that Constitution, and the people of the\r\nUnited States, who ratified it, set it forth in the preamble as their\r\nfirst great purpose \"to form a more perfect Union.\" They intended to\r\nestablish thereby a Government of perpetual obligation and of\r\nself-sustaining vigor. They did not contemplate the necessity of\r\namendments for any other causes than such as, after calm, deliberate,\r\nundisturbed consideration should be judged necessary. They did not\r\nintend that it should be exposed to the danger of hasty action under\r\nthe influence of excited passions or timid and groundless\r\napprehension. They would not trust the entire people even with the\r\nright of amendment, except in the mode prescribed, with all the delays\r\nincident to that mode; and then only by the action, in every stage of\r\nthe proceeding, of persons bound by solemn oath to support it.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, in prescribing the modes of proposing amendments,\r\nendeavored to provide against irregular combination of a part only of\r\nthe States to effect them. Hence it prohibited all agreements or\r\ncompacts between the States; and it made no provision for the\r\nrecognition of any action by a convention, except when called on the\r\nrecommendation of two-thirds of the States applying to Congress, by\r\nseparate action of their Legislatures, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAny interference with the duty of Congress by such a body as we are,\r\nrepresenting only a portion of the States in any form, and some of us\r\nonly the executives of the States from which we come, would be as much\r\nat variance with the Constitution as with the counsel of that\r\nillustrious American--I will not say Virginian--for WASHINGTON\r\nbelonged to his whole country--in the Farewell Address which he\r\ndedicated to the people of the United States on his retirement from\r\nthe public service, and which ought to be cherished in the heart of\r\nevery patriot. In addition to what I have already read from that\r\naddress let me read this passage:\r\n\r\n     \"All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all\r\n     _combinations_ and _associations_ under whatever plausible\r\n     character, with the _real design to direct, control,\r\n     counteract_, or _awe_ the regular deliberation and action of\r\n     the _constituted authorities_, are destructive to this\r\n     fundamental rule, and of fatal tendency.\"\r\n\r\nLet me read it again. \"All obstructions,\" &c. \"All combinations,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis address is replete with words of true wisdom. Let us heed them;\r\nfor they are eminently adapted to the present occasion. There is no\r\nexigency which should be allowed to overawe Congress in the\r\nperformance of its constitutional duties. No State intervention, no\r\ncombination or association of representatives of States in a manner\r\nunknown to the Constitution, can be recognized as authoritative by\r\nthose to whom, on their own responsibility, the people of the United\r\nStates have conferred their national interests and the guardianship of\r\ntheir fundamental law. \"We owe,\" in the language of the illustrious\r\nstatesman of Kentucky, \"_a paramount_ allegiance to the Government of\r\nthe United States--a subordinate one to our State.\"\r\n\r\nSir, while I am willing to perform all my constitutional duties--all\r\nmy fraternal duties toward the people of every section of our common\r\ncountry, I, for one, feel bound to abstain from any encroachment on\r\nthe duties which the Constitution of my country has delegated to\r\nothers to be performed, in the modes, and with the responsibilities,\r\nwhich the _people_ for their own security have deemed it proper to\r\nprescribe.\r\n\r\nWith these opinions, I should be unfaithful to my own convictions of\r\nduty, and recreant to the trust which has devolved on me as a citizen\r\nof the United States, and by inheritance from an ancestor who took a\r\npart in the deliberations of the Convention which framed our\r\nConstitution, and to whose public services, you, sir, so kindly\r\nalluded at the opening of the Conference, were I to unite with the\r\nmajority of the committee in urging upon Congress the amendments they\r\nhave proposed.\r\n\r\nEntertaining as I do for the members of the committee who have\r\nconcurred in that report a profound respect, it has been with a\r\nfeeling of unaffected diffidence and self-distrust that I have\r\nventured to express my sentiments on this occasion. But as I must act\r\non my own convictions of duty, which are in harmony with those of my\r\nassociates from Connecticut, so far as in the brief period which has\r\nelapsed since the report was submitted I have had opportunity to\r\nascertain them, I felt bound to make known to the Convention the\r\nreasons which will govern my action.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The closing remarks of Mr. BALDWIN were committed to\r\nwriting. I am able through the kindness of a member of his family to\r\navail myself of a copy.]\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken by States on the substitute proposed by Mr.\r\nBALDWIN, and the substitute was rejected by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont--8.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\n     Tennessee, Virginia, and Kansas--13.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen disagreed to the vote of their respective\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON, of New York; Mr. GRANGER, of New York; Mr. DODGE, of New\r\nYork; Mr. CORNING, of New York; Mr. ORTH, of Indiana; Mr. HACKLEMAN,\r\nof Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I suppose it is now in order for me to move my substitute\r\nfor the report of the majority of the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I also have a substitute to offer. I shall not discuss it.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--The substitute which I propose embodies the CRITTENDEN\r\nresolutions, with the modifications suggested by Virginia. These are\r\nprincipally confined to the first section, which is made to apply to\r\nour future as well as our present territory. I have modified the form\r\nof the substitute in several particulars, and now offer it without\r\nfarther introduction. These are the amendments which I understand the\r\ndelegation from Virginia is instructed to insist upon:\r\n\r\n     JOINT RESOLUTIONS\r\n\r\n     PROPOSING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE\r\n     UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, serious and alarming dissensions have arisen\r\n     between the Northern and Southern States, concerning the\r\n     rights and security of the rights of the slaveholding\r\n     States, and especially their rights in the common territory\r\n     of the United States; and whereas, it is eminently desirable\r\n     and proper that those dissensions, which now threaten the\r\n     very existence of this Union, should be permanently quieted\r\n     and settled by constitutional provisions, which shall do\r\n     equal justice to all sections, and thereby restore to the\r\n     people that peace and good will which ought to prevail\r\n     between all the citizens of the United States: therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, by this Convention, that the following articles\r\n     are hereby approved and submitted to the Congress of the\r\n     United States, with the request that they may, by the\r\n     requisite constitutional majority of two-thirds, be\r\n     recommended to the respective States of the Union, to be,\r\n     when ratified by conventions of three-fourths of the States,\r\n     valid and operative as amendments of the Constitution of the\r\n     Union.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States now\r\n     held or hereafter acquired, situate north of latitude 36°\r\n     30´, slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a\r\n     punishment for crime, is prohibited, while such territory\r\n     shall remain under territorial government. In all the\r\n     territory now or hereafter acquired south of said line of\r\n     latitude, slavery of the African race is hereby recognized\r\n     as existing, and shall not be interfered with by Congress;\r\n     but shall be protected as property by all the departments of\r\n     the territorial government during its continuance; and when\r\n     any territory, north or south of said line, within such\r\n     boundaries as Congress may prescribe, shall contain the\r\n     population requisite for a member of Congress, according to\r\n     the then federal ratio of representation of the people of\r\n     the United States, it shall, if its form of government be\r\n     republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal footing\r\n     with the original States, with or without slavery, as the\r\n     constitution of such new State may provide.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 2. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     in places under its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate\r\n     within the limits of States that permit the holding of\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 3. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     within the District of Columbia, so long as it exists in\r\n     the adjoining States of Virginia and Maryland, or either,\r\n     nor without the consent of the free white inhabitants, nor\r\n     without just compensation first made to such owners of\r\n     slaves as do not consent to such abolishment. Nor shall\r\n     Congress at any time prohibit officers of the Federal\r\n     Government or members of Congress, whose duties require them\r\n     to be in said District, from bringing with them their slaves\r\n     and holding them, as such, during the time their duties may\r\n     require them to remain there, and afterwards taking them\r\n     from the District.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 4. Congress shall have no power to prohibit or\r\n     hinder the transportation of slaves from one State to\r\n     another, or to a Territory in which slaves are by law\r\n     permitted to be held, whether that transportation be by\r\n     land, navigable rivers, or by the sea. And if such\r\n     transportation be by sea, the slaves shall be protected as\r\n     property by the Federal Government. And the right of transit\r\n     by the owners with their slaves in passing to or from one\r\n     slaveholding State or Territory to another, between and\r\n     through the non-slaveholding States and Territories, shall\r\n     be protected. And in imposing direct taxes pursuant to the\r\n     Constitution, Congress shall have no power to impose on\r\n     slaves a higher rate of tax than on land, according to their\r\n     just value.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 5. That in addition to the provisions of the third\r\n     paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, Congress shall provide by\r\n     law, that the United States shall pay to the owner who shall\r\n     apply for it, the full value of his fugitive slave, in all\r\n     cases, when the marshal, or other officer, whose duty it was\r\n     to arrest said fugitive, was prevented from so doing by\r\n     violence or intimidation, or when, after arrest, said\r\n     fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner thereby\r\n     prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\n     the recovery of his fugitive slave, under the said clause of\r\n     the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof. And\r\n     in all such cases, when the United States shall pay for such\r\n     fugitive, they shall reimburse themselves by imposing and\r\n     collecting a tax on the county or city in which said\r\n     violence, intimidation, or rescue was committed, equal in\r\n     amount to the sum paid by them, with the addition of\r\n     interest and the costs of collection; and the said county or\r\n     city, after it has paid said amount to the United States,\r\n     may, for its indemnity, sue and recover from the\r\n     wrong-doers, or rescuers, by whom the owner was prevented\r\n     from the recovery of his fugitive slave, in like manner as\r\n     the owner himself might have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 6. No future amendment of the Constitution shall\r\n     affect the five preceding articles, nor the third paragraph\r\n     of the second section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution, nor the third paragraph of the second section\r\n     of the fourth article of said Constitution, and no amendment\r\n     shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or\r\n     give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with\r\n     slavery in any of the States by whose laws it is or may be\r\n     allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 7. SEC. 1. The elective franchise and the right to\r\n     hold office, whether Federal, State, territorial, or\r\n     municipal, shall not be exercised by persons who are, in\r\n     whole or in part, of the African race.\r\n\r\n     And whereas, also, besides those causes of dissension\r\n     embraced in the foregoing amendments proposed to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, there are others which\r\n     come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may be\r\n     remedied by its legislative power: and whereas it is the\r\n     desire of this Convention, as far as its influence may\r\n     extend, to remove all just cause for the popular discontent\r\n     and agitation which now disturb the peace of the country,\r\n     and threaten the stability of its institutions: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     1. _Resolved_, That the laws now in force for the recovery\r\n     of fugitive slaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and\r\n     mandatory provisions of the Constitution, and have been\r\n     sanctioned as valid and constitutional by the judgment of\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States; that the\r\n     slaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance\r\n     and execution of those laws, and that they ought not to be\r\n     repealed or so modified or changed as to impair their\r\n     efficiency; and that laws ought to be made for the\r\n     punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the slave or\r\n     other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution\r\n     of said laws.\r\n\r\n     2. That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive\r\n     slave acts, or any other constitutional acts of Congress, or\r\n     which, in their operation, impede, hinder, or delay the free\r\n     course and due execution of any of said acts, are null and\r\n     void by the plain provisions of the Constitution of the\r\n     United States. Yet those State laws, void as they are, have\r\n     given color to practices, and led to consequences which have\r\n     obstructed the due administration and execution of acts of\r\n     Congress, and especially the acts for the delivery of\r\n     fugitive slaves, and have thereby contributed much to the\r\n     discord and commotion now prevailing. This Convention,\r\n     therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does not deem\r\n     it improper, respectfully and earnestly, to recommend the\r\n     repeal of those laws to the several States which have\r\n     enacted them, or such legislative corrections or\r\n     explanations of them as may prevent their being used or\r\n     perverted to such mischievous purposes.\r\n\r\n     3. That the act of the eighteenth of September, eighteen\r\n     hundred and fifty, commonly called the fugitive slave law,\r\n     ought to be so amended as to make the fee of the\r\n     commissioner, mentioned in the eighth section of the act,\r\n     equal in amount, in the cases decided by him, whether his\r\n     decision be in favor of or against the claimant. And to\r\n     avoid misconstruction, the last clause of the fifth section\r\n     of said act, which authorizes the person holding a warrant\r\n     for the arrest or detention of a fugitive slave to summon to\r\n     his aid the _posse comitatus_, and which declares it to be\r\n     the duty of all good citizens to assist him in its\r\n     execution, ought to be so amended as to expressly limit the\r\n     authority and duty to cases in which there shall be\r\n     resistance, or danger of resistance or rescue.\r\n\r\n     4. That the laws for the suppression of the African\r\n     slave-trade, and especially those prohibiting the\r\n     importation of slaves into the United States, ought to be\r\n     made effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed, and all\r\n     further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be\r\n     promptly made.\r\n\r\nThe substitute offered by Mr. SEDDON was rejected by the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, and Virginia--4.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, New\r\n     Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\r\n     Vermont, and Kansas--16.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT dissented from the vote of Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. HOUSTON:--I wish to explain the vote of Delaware. She has endorsed\r\nthe CRITTENDEN resolutions. She would accept the mode of adjustment\r\nproposed by the gentleman from Virginia. She has adhered to her\r\nopinions as long as she thinks it fit or expedient to do so. Under\r\nthese circumstances Delaware feels it her duty to vote for the report\r\nof the majority. As we desire to harmonize conflicting opinions, and\r\nto arrive at a fair settlement, we have voted against Mr. SEDDON'S\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nMr. CRISFIELD:--Like Delaware, Maryland prefers the CRITTENDEN plan of\r\nadjustment. That we think is now impossible. But that plan does not\r\ndiffer very widely from the report of the majority. Certainly not\r\nenough to warrant us in risking the Union, when we can get the one and\r\ncannot have the other. For this reason Maryland votes \"No\" on Mr.\r\nSEDDON'S proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CLAY:--I gave notice some days ago that I should offer as a\r\nsubstitute the CRITTENDEN resolutions--pure and undefiled--without the\r\ncrossing of a \"t\" or the dotting of an \"i.\" I now offer them as\r\nfollows, and demand a vote by States:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, the Union is in danger; and owing to the unhappy\r\n     divisions existing in Congress, it would be difficult, if\r\n     not impossible, for that body to concur, in both its\r\n     branches, by the requisite majority, so as to enable it\r\n     either to adopt such measures of legislation, or to\r\n     recommend to the States such amendments to the Constitution\r\n     as are deemed necessary and proper to avert that danger; and\r\n     whereas, in so great an emergency, the opinion and judgment\r\n     of the people ought to be heard, and would be the best and\r\n     surest guide to their representatives: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That provision ought to be made by law, without\r\n     delay, for taking the sense of the people, and submitting to\r\n     their vote the following resolutions as the basis for the\r\n     final and permanent settlement of those disputes that now\r\n     disturb the peace of the country and threaten the existence\r\n     of the Union.\r\n\r\n     And that whereas serious and alarming dissensions have\r\n     arisen between the Northern and Southern States, concerning\r\n     the rights and security of the rights of the slaveholding\r\n     States, and especially their rights in the common territory\r\n     of the United States; and whereas, it is eminently desirable\r\n     and proper that those dissensions, which now threaten the\r\n     very existence of this Union, should be permanently quieted\r\n     and settled by constitutional provisions, which shall do\r\n     equal justice to all sections, and thereby restore to the\r\n     people that peace and good will which ought to prevail\r\n     between all the citizens of the United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the following articles be, and hereby are,\r\n     proposed and submitted as amendments to the Constitution of\r\n     the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and\r\n     purposes as part of said Constitution, when ratified by\r\n     conventions of three-fourths of the several States:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States now\r\n     held or hereafter acquired, situate north of latitude 36°\r\n     30´, slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a\r\n     punishment for crime, is prohibited, while such territory\r\n     shall remain under territorial government. In all the\r\n     territory south of said line of latitude, slavery of the\r\n     African race is hereby recognized as existing, and shall not\r\n     be interfered with by Congress; but shall be protected as\r\n     property by all the departments of the territorial\r\n     government during its continuance; and when any Territory,\r\n     north or south of said line, within such boundaries as\r\n     Congress may prescribe, shall contain the population\r\n     requisite for a member of Congress, according to the then\r\n     Federal ratio of representation of the people of the United\r\n     States, it shall, if its form of government be republican,\r\n     be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\n     original States, with or without slavery, as the\r\n     constitution of such new States may provide.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 2. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     in places under its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate\r\n     within the limits of States that permit the holding of\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 3. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery\r\n     within the District of Columbia, so long as it exists in the\r\n     adjoining States of Virginia and Maryland, or either, nor\r\n     without the consent of the inhabitants, nor without just\r\n     compensation first made to such owners of slaves as do not\r\n     consent to such abolishment. Nor shall Congress at any time\r\n     prohibit officers of the Federal Government or members of\r\n     Congress, whose duties require them to be in said District,\r\n     from bringing with them their slaves, and holding them, as\r\n     such, during the time their duties may require them to\r\n     remain there, and afterwards taking them from the District.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 4. Congress shall have no power to prohibit or\r\n     hinder the transportation of slaves from one State to\r\n     another, or to a Territory in which slaves are by law\r\n     permitted to be held, whether that transportation be by\r\n     land, navigable rivers, or by the sea; and the right of\r\n     transit by the owners with their slaves in passing to or\r\n     from one slaveholding State or Territory to another, between\r\n     and through the non-slaveholding States and Territories,\r\n     shall be protected.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 5. That, in addition to the provisions of the third\r\n     paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, Congress shall have power\r\n     to provide by law, and it shall be its duty so to provide,\r\n     that the United States shall pay to the owner who shall\r\n     apply for it, the full value of his fugitive slave in all\r\n     cases, when the marshal or other officer whose duty it was\r\n     to arrest said fugitive was prevented from so doing by\r\n     violence or intimidation, or when, after arrest, said\r\n     fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner thereby\r\n     prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\n     the recovery of his fugitive slave, under the said clause of\r\n     the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof. And\r\n     in all such cases, when the United States shall pay for such\r\n     fugitive, they shall have the power to reimburse themselves\r\n     by imposing and collecting a tax on the county or city in\r\n     which said violence, intimidation, or rescue was committed,\r\n     equal in amount to the sum paid by them, with the addition\r\n     of interest and the costs of collection; and the said county\r\n     or city, after it has paid said amount to the United States,\r\n     may, for its indemnity, sue and recover from the\r\n     wrong-doers, or rescuers, by whom the owner was prevented\r\n     from the recovery of his fugitive slave, in like manner as\r\n     the owner himself might have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 6. No future amendment of the Constitution shall\r\n     affect the five preceding articles, nor the third paragraph\r\n     of the second section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution, nor the third paragraph of the second section\r\n     of the fourth article of said Constitution; and no amendment\r\n     shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or\r\n     give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with\r\n     slavery in any of the States by whose laws it is or may be\r\n     allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 7. SEC. 1. The elective franchise, and the right to\r\n     hold office, whether federal, State, territorial, or\r\n     municipal, shall not be exercised by persons who are, in\r\n     whole or in part, of the African race.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. The United States shall have power to acquire, from\r\n     time to time, districts of country in Africa and South\r\n     America, for the colonization, at expense of the Federal\r\n     Treasury, of such free negroes and mulattoes as the several\r\n     States may wish to have removed from their limits and from\r\n     the District of Columbia, and such other places as may be\r\n     under the jurisdiction of Congress.\r\n\r\n     _And whereas_, also, besides those causes of dissension\r\n     embraced in the foregoing amendments proposed to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, there are others which\r\n     come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may be\r\n     remedied by its legitimate power; and whereas it is the\r\n     desire of this Convention, as far as its influence may\r\n     extend, to remove all just cause for the popular discontent\r\n     and agitation which now disturb the peace of the country,\r\n     and threaten the stability of its institutions: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     1. _Resolved_, That the laws now in force for the recovery\r\n     of fugitive slaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and\r\n     mandatory provisions of the Constitution, and have been\r\n     sanctioned as valid and constitutional by the judgment of\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States; that the\r\n     slaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance\r\n     and execution of those laws, and that they ought not to be\r\n     repealed or so modified or changed as to impair their\r\n     efficiency; and that laws ought to be made for the\r\n     punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the slave or\r\n     other illegal means, to hinder of defeat the due execution\r\n     of said laws.\r\n\r\n     2. That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive\r\n     slave acts, or any other constitutional acts of Congress, or\r\n     which in their operation impede, hinder, or delay the free\r\n     course and due execution of any of said acts, are null and\r\n     void by the plain provisions of the Constitution of the\r\n     United States.

That the laws for the suppression of the African\r\n     slave-trade, and especially those prohibiting the\r\n     importation of slaves into the United States, ought to be\r\n     made effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed, and all\r\n     further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be\r\n     promptly made.\r\n\r\nThe question on agreeing to said amendment resulted in the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--5.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, New\r\n     Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and\r\n     Vermont--14.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. DENT:--I desire to dissent from the vote of Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I desire to record the vote of Kansas in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--Leave will be given unless objection is made.\r\n\r\nMr. TUCK:--I hold in my hand a substitute which I propose to offer for\r\nthe report of the committee. I know all the delegates have made up\r\ntheir minds how to vote, and what to vote for. Argument now will\r\namount to but little. But I submit this as indicating to a certain\r\nextent the views of the minority here. I shall make no farther\r\nremarks, but shall pass it to the Secretary, and I hope the Conference\r\nwill be patient for five minutes while it is read.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of Mr. TUCK was read as follows:\r\n\r\n     TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\n     On the 4th day of February, 1861, in compliance with the\r\n     invitation of the State of Virginia, commissioners from\r\n     several other States met the commissioners of that State in\r\n     Conference Convention, in the City of Washington. From time\r\n     to time, commissioners from other States appeared, appointed\r\n     as were those who first appeared, some by the Legislatures,\r\n     and some by the Governors of their respective States, until,\r\n     on the 23d instant, twenty-one States were then represented.\r\n     The Convention thus constituted claims no authority under\r\n     the Constitution and laws; but deeply impressed with a sense\r\n     of existing dissensions and dangers, proceeded to a careful\r\n     consideration of them and their appropriate remedies, and\r\n     having brought their deliberations to a close, now submit\r\n     the result to the judgment of their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n     We recognize and deplore the divisions and distractions\r\n     which now afflict our country, interrupt its prosperity,\r\n     disturb its peace, and endanger the Union of the States; but\r\n     we repel the conclusion, that any alienations or dissensions\r\n     exist which are irreconcilable, which justify attempts at\r\n     revolution, or which the patriotism and fraternal sentiments\r\n     of the people, and the interests and honor of the whole\r\n     nation, will not overcome.\r\n\r\n     In a country embracing the central and most important\r\n     portion of a continent, among a people now numbering over\r\n     thirty millions, diversities of opinion inevitably exist;\r\n     and rivalries, intensified at times by local interests and\r\n     sectional attachments, must often occur; yet we do not doubt\r\n     that the theory of our Government is the best which is\r\n     possible for this nation, that the Union of the States is of\r\n     vital importance, and that the Constitution, which expresses\r\n     the combined wisdom of the illustrious founders of the\r\n     Government, is still the palladium of our liberties,\r\n     adequate to every emergency, and justly entitled to the\r\n     support of every good citizen.\r\n\r\n     It embraces in its provisions and spirit, all the defence\r\n     and protection which any section of the country can\r\n     rightfully demand or honorably concede.\r\n\r\n     Adopted with primary reference to the wants of five millions\r\n     of people, but with the wisest reference to future expansion\r\n     and development, it has carried us onward with a rapid\r\n     increase of numbers, an accumulation of wealth, and a degree\r\n     of happiness and general prosperity never attained by any\r\n     other nation.\r\n\r\n     Whatever branch of industry, or whatever staple production,\r\n     shall become, in the possible changes of the future, the\r\n     leading interests of the country, thereby creating\r\n     unforeseen complications or new conflicts of opinion and\r\n     interest, the Constitution of the United States, properly\r\n     understood and fairly enforced, is equal to every exigency,\r\n     a shield and defence to all, in every time of need. If,\r\n     however, by reason of a change in circumstances, or for any\r\n     cause, a portion of the people believe they ought to have\r\n     their rights more exactly defined or more fully explained in\r\n     the Constitution, it is their duty, in accordance with its\r\n     provisions, to seek a remedy by way of amendment to that\r\n     instrument; and it is the duty of all the States to concur\r\n     in such amendments as may be found necessary to insure equal\r\n     and exact justice to all.\r\n\r\n     In order, therefore, to announce to the country the\r\n     sentiments of this Convention, respecting not only the\r\n     remedy which should be sought for existing discontents, but\r\n     also to communicate to the public what we believe to be the\r\n     patriotic sentiment of the country, we adopt the following\r\n     resolutions:\r\n\r\n     1st. _Resolved_, That this Convention recognize the\r\n     well-understood proposition that the Constitution of the\r\n     United States gives no power to Congress, or any branch of\r\n     the Federal Government, to interfere in any manner with\r\n     slavery in any of the States; and we are assured by abundant\r\n     testimony, that neither of the great political organizations\r\n     existing in the country contemplates a violation of the\r\n     spirit of the Constitution in this regard, or the procuring\r\n     of any amendment thereof, by which Congress, or any\r\n     department of the General Government, shall ever have\r\n     jurisdiction over slavery in any of the States.\r\n\r\n     2d. _Resolved_, That the Constitution was ordained and\r\n     established, as set forth in the preamble, by the people of\r\n     the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union,\r\n     establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for\r\n     the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure\r\n     the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity;\r\n     and when the people of any State are not in full enjoyment\r\n     of all the benefits intended to be secured to them by the\r\n     Constitution, or their rights under it are disregarded,\r\n     their tranquillity disturbed, their prosperity retarded, or\r\n     their liberty imperilled by the people of any other State,\r\n     full and adequate redress can and ought to be provided for\r\n     such grievances.\r\n\r\n     3d. _Resolved_, That the Constitution of the United States,\r\n     and the acts of Congress in pursuance thereof, are the\r\n     supreme law of the land, to which every citizen owes\r\n     faithful obedience; and it is therefore respectfully\r\n     recommended to the Legislatures of the several States to\r\n     consider impartially whatever complaints may be made of acts\r\n     as inconsistent therewith, by sister States or their\r\n     citizens, and carefully revise their statutes, in view of\r\n     such complaints, and to repeal whatever provisions may be\r\n     found to be in contravention of that supreme law.\r\n\r\n     4th. _Resolved_, That this Convention recommend to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States of the Union to follow\r\n     the example of the Legislatures of the States of Kentucky\r\n     and of Illinois, in applying to Congress to call a\r\n     Convention for the proposing of amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, pursuant to the fifth\r\n     article thereof.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I have not thought it best to occupy much of the time of\r\nthe Convention in discussing the propositions presented for its\r\ndecision. I have indeed been impressed with an idea that a decision\r\nupon these propositions just now may be premature.\r\n\r\nI have already stated to the Conference that the delegates from Ohio\r\nact under resolutions of the General Assembly of that State, one of\r\nwhich requires them to use their influence in procuring an adjournment\r\nof this body to the 4th of April next. It is the wish of that State\r\nthat opportunity may be given for full consideration of any\r\nconstitutional amendment that may be proposed here, and especially to\r\navoid precipitate action under apprehensions of resistance to the\r\ninauguration of Mr. LINCOLN on the 4th of next month.\r\n\r\nI have already submitted resolutions in accordance with the views of\r\nthe Legislature, and intended, at the proper time, to ask a vote upon\r\nthe proposed adjournment. On consultation with my colleagues, however,\r\nI find a majority of them averse to postponement; and, in view of the\r\nfact that the resolution of the Legislature is not imperative in its\r\nterms, and especially in consideration of the assurances constantly\r\ngiven here by delegates from slaveholding States that, whatever may be\r\nthe result of our deliberations, no obstruction or hindrance will be\r\nopposed to the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN, I have determined to\r\nforbear urging a vote.\r\n\r\nUpon the respective merits of the propositions of the committee, and\r\nthe proposed amendments, I have not much to say. But what I do say\r\nwill be said in all seriousness.\r\n\r\nI do not approve the confident pledges made here of favorable action\r\nby the people of either section, or of any State, upon whatever\r\npropositions may receive the sanction of this Conference. The people\r\nof the free States, so far as my observation goes, do not commit their\r\nright of judgment to anybody. They generally exercise it themselves,\r\nand be assured they will exercise it freely upon any proposition\r\ncoming from this body. Whatever our actions may be here, every\r\nproposition to amend the Constitution must come before the people.\r\nThey will discuss it, and must adopt it before it can become a part of\r\nthe fundamental law. Dismiss, then, the idea that all that is\r\nnecessary to secure amendments acceptable to a particular interest or\r\nsection is to secure for them the sanction of a majority in this hall.\r\n\r\nThe result of the national canvass which recently terminated in the\r\nelection of Mr. LINCOLN has been spoken of by some as the effect of a\r\nsudden impulse, or of some irregular excitement of the popular mind;\r\nand it has been somewhat confidently asserted that, upon reflection\r\nand consideration, the hastily-formed opinions which brought about\r\nthat election will be changed. It has been said, also, that\r\nsubordinate questions of local and temporary character have augmented\r\nthe Republican vote, and secured a majority which could not have been\r\nobtained upon the national questions involved in the respective\r\nplatforms of the parties which divide the country.\r\n\r\nI cannot take this view of the result of the Presidential election. I\r\nbelieve, and the belief amounts to absolute conviction, that the\r\nelection must be regarded as the triumph of principles cherished in\r\nthe hearts of the people of the free States. These principles, it is\r\ntrue, were originally asserted by a small party only. But, after years\r\nof discussion, they have, by their own value, their own intrinsic\r\nsoundness, obtained the deliberate and unalterable sanction of the\r\npeople's judgment.\r\n\r\nChief among these principles is the restriction of slavery within\r\nState limits; _not_ war upon slavery within those limits, but fixed\r\nopposition to its extension beyond them. Mr. LINCOLN was the candidate\r\nof the people opposed to the extension of slavery. We have elected\r\nhim. After many years of earnest advocacy and of severe trial, we have\r\nachieved the triumph of that principle. By a fair and unquestionable\r\nmajority we have secured that triumph. Do you think we, who represent\r\nthis majority, will throw it away? Do you think the people would\r\nsustain us if we undertook to throw it away? I must speak to you\r\nplainly, gentlemen of the South; it is not in my heart to deceive you.\r\nI therefore tell you explicitly that if we of the North and West would\r\nconsent to throw away all that has been gained in the recent triumph\r\nof our principles, the people would not sustain us, and so the consent\r\nwould avail you nothing. And I must tell you farther, that under no\r\ninducements whatever will we consent to surrender a principle which we\r\nbelieve to be so sound and so important as that of restricting slavery\r\nwithin State limits.\r\n\r\nThere are some things, however, which I think the people are willing\r\nto do. In all my relations with them, and these relations have been\r\nsomewhat intimate, I have never discovered any desire or inclination\r\non the part of any considerable number, to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery within the States where it exists. I do not\r\nbelieve that any such desire anywhere prevails. All your rights have\r\nbeen respected and enforced by the people of the free States. More\r\nthan this: even your claims have been enforced, under repulsive\r\ncircumstances, and, in my judgment, beyond right and beyond\r\nconstitutional obligation. When and where have the people of the free\r\nStates, in their representatives, refused you any right? When and\r\nwhere have they refused to confer with you frankly and candidly when\r\nyou imagined your rights to be in danger? They have been, and still\r\nare, patient and forbearing. They do not believe that you need any new\r\nconstitutional guarantees. You have guarantees enough in their\r\nvoluntary action. But, since you think differently, they send us\r\nhither to meet you, to confer with you, to consider the questions\r\nwhich threaten the Union, to discuss them freely and decide them\r\nfairly.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, what do we ask of you? Do we ask any thing\r\nunreasonable in the amendment which has been submitted? We simply ask\r\nthat you say to your people that we of the free States have no\r\npurpose, and never had any purpose, to infringe the rights of the\r\nslave States, or of any citizen of the slave States. And that our\r\ndevotion to the Government and the Constitution is not inferior to\r\nthat of any portion of the American people. By uniting with us in the\r\ndeclaration we propose, you tell your people at home that no\r\nconsiderable party, that no considerable number of persons, in the\r\nfree States, has any wish or purpose to interfere with slavery in the\r\nStates where it exists, or with any of your rights under the\r\nConstitution. You can say this with absolute truth, and with entire\r\nconfidence. In all the action of the delegates who favor this\r\namendment, in all our private consultations, every heart has been\r\nanimated by a most anxious desire to maintain the Union and preserve\r\nthe harmony of the Republic. No word has been uttered indicating the\r\nslightest wish to avoid any obligation of the Constitution, or to\r\ndeprive you of any right under it. All concur in desiring to give\r\neffect to the Constitution and the laws passed in pursuance of it. The\r\nsame sentiments animate the people of the free States. Congress has\r\ndeclared, with the almost unanimous concurrence of the members from\r\nthe free States, against national interference with slavery in the\r\nslave States. The Chicago Convention most emphatically asserted the\r\nsame doctrine. It has been reiterated over and over again by the\r\nLegislatures of the free States, and by great and small conventions of\r\ntheir people. Is it, then, too much to ask you to unite with us in a\r\ndeclaration that all fears of aggression entertained by your people\r\nare groundless? Such a declaration will go far to insure peace; why\r\nnot make it?\r\n\r\nYou profess to be satisfied with slavery, as it is and where it is.\r\nYou think the institution just and beneficial. The very able gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia (Mr. SEDDON), who commands the respect of all by the\r\nfrankness and sincerity of his speech, has said that he believes\r\nslavery to be the condition in which the African is to be educated up\r\nto freedom. He does not believe in perpetual slavery. He believes the\r\ntime will come when the slave, through the beneficent influences of\r\nthe circumstances which surround him, will rise in intelligence,\r\ncapacity, and character, to the dignity of a freeman, and will be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWe cannot agree with you, and therefore do not propose to allow\r\nslavery where we are responsible for it, outside of your State limits,\r\nand under National jurisdiction. But we do not mean to interfere with\r\nit at all within State limits. So far as we are concerned, you can\r\nwork out your experiment there in peace. We shall rejoice if no evil\r\ncomes from it to you or yours. [Mr. CHASE'S time having expired, he\r\nwas unanimously invited to proceed.]\r\n\r\nAside from the Territorial question--the question of slavery outside\r\nof the slave States--I know of but one serious difficulty. I refer to\r\nthe question concerning fugitives from service. The clause in the\r\nConstitution concerning this class of persons is regarded by almost\r\nall men, North and South, as a stipulation for the surrender to their\r\nmasters of slaves escaping into free States. The people of the free\r\nStates, however, who believe that slaveholding is wrong, cannot and\r\nwill not aid in the reclamation, and the stipulation becomes therefore\r\na dead letter. You complain of bad faith, and the complaint is\r\nretorted by denunciations of the cruelty which would drag back to\r\nbondage the poor slave who has escaped from it. You, thinking slavery\r\nright, claim the fulfilment of the stipulation; we, thinking slavery\r\nwrong, cannot fulfil the stipulation without consciousness of\r\nparticipation in wrong. Here is a real difficulty, but it seems to me\r\nnot insuperable. It will not do for us to say to you, in justification\r\nof non-performance, \"the stipulation is immoral, and therefore we\r\ncannot execute it;\" for you deny the immorality, and we cannot assume\r\nto judge for you.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you ought not to exact from us the literal\r\nperformance of the stipulation when you know that we cannot perform it\r\nwithout conscious culpability. A true solution of the difficulty seems\r\nto be attainable by regarding it as a simple case where a contract,\r\nfrom changed circumstances, cannot be fulfilled exactly as made. A\r\ncourt of equity in such a case decrees execution as near as may be. It\r\nrequires the party who cannot perform to make compensation for\r\nnon-performance. Why cannot the same principle be applied to the\r\nrendition of fugitives from service? We cannot surrender--but we can\r\ncompensate. Why not, then, avoid all difficulties on all sides, and\r\nshow respectively good faith and good will by providing and accepting\r\ncompensation where masters reclaim escaping servants and prove their\r\nright of reclamation under the Constitution? Instead of a judgment for\r\nrendition, let there be a judgment for compensation, determined by the\r\ntrue value of the services, and let the same judgment assure freedom\r\nto the fugitive. The cost to the National Treasury would be as nothing\r\nin comparison with the evils of discord and strife. All parties would\r\nbe gainers.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said is, indeed, not exactly to the point of the\r\npresent discussion. But I refer to this matter to show how easily the\r\ngreatest difficulties may be adjusted if approached in a truly just,\r\ngenerous, and patriotic spirit.\r\n\r\nI refer to it also in order to show you that, if we do not concede all\r\nyour wishes, it is because our ideas of justice, duty, and honor\r\nforbid, and not because we cherish any hostile or aggressive\r\nsentiments. We will go as far as we can to meet you--come you also as\r\nfar as you can to meet us. Join at least in the declaration we\r\npropose. Your people have confidence in you. They will believe you.\r\nThe declaration, made with substantial unanimity by this Conference,\r\nwill tranquillize public sentiment, and give a chance for reason to\r\nresume its sway, and patriotic counsels to gain a hearing.\r\n\r\nDo you say that after all what we propose embodies no substantial\r\nguarantees of immunity to slavery through the perversion of Federal\r\npowers? We reply that we think the Constitution as it stands,\r\ninterpreted honestly and executed faithfully, is sufficient for all\r\npractical purposes; and that you will find all desirable security in\r\nthe legislation or non-legislation of Congress. If you think\r\notherwise, we are ready to join you in recommending a National\r\nConvention to propose amendments to the Constitution in the regular\r\nand legitimate way. Kentucky, a slave State, has proposed such a\r\nConvention; Illinois, a free State, has joined in the proposition.\r\nJoin us, then, in recommending such a Convention, and assure us that\r\nyou will abide by its decision. We will join you and give a similar\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nThis, gentlemen, is the proposition we make you to-day. It is embodied\r\nin the amendment just submitted. Is it not a fair proposition? It is a\r\nplain declaration of facts which cannot reasonably be questioned, and\r\na plain submission of all disputed questions to the only proper\r\ntribunal for the settlement of such questions--that of the American\r\npeople, acting through a National Convention.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative to this proposition is the proposition that the\r\npresent Congress be called upon to submit to the States a thirteenth\r\narticle embodying the amendments recommended by the committee. In\r\norder to the submission of these amendments to the States by Congress,\r\na two-thirds vote in each House is necessary. That, I venture to say,\r\ncannot be obtained. Were it otherwise, who can assure you that the new\r\narticle will obtain the sanction of three-fourths of the States,\r\nwithout which it is a nullity? As a measure to defeat all adjustment,\r\nI can understand this proposition. As a measure of pacification, I do\r\nnot understand it. There is, in my judgment, no peace in it. Gentlemen\r\nhere, of patriotism and intelligence, think otherwise. I am sorry that\r\nI cannot agree with them.\r\n\r\nGentlemen say, if this proposition cannot prevail, every slave State\r\nwill secede; or, as some prefer to phrase it, will resort to\r\nrevolution. I forbear to discuss eventualities. I must say, however,\r\nand say plainly, that considerations such as these will not move me\r\nfrom my recognized duty to my country and its Constitution. And let me\r\nsay for the people of the free States, that they are a thoughtful\r\npeople, and are much in earnest in this business. They do not delegate\r\ntheir right of private judgment. They love their institutions and the\r\nUnion. They will not surrender the one nor give up the other without\r\ngreat struggles and great sacrifices. Upon the question of the\r\nmaintenance of an unbroken Union and a whole country they never were,\r\nand it is my firm conviction they never will be divided. Gentlemen who\r\nthink they will be, even in the worst contingency, will, I think, be\r\ndisappointed. If forced to the last extremity, the people will meet\r\nthe issue as they best may; but be assured they will meet it with no\r\ndiscordant councils.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, Mr. LINCOLN will be inaugurated on the 4th of March. He\r\nwill take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates--of the whole--of all the United States. That oath will bind\r\nhim to take care that the laws be faithfully executed throughout the\r\nUnited States. Will secession absolve him from that oath? Will it\r\ndiminish, by one jot or tittle, its awful obligation? Will attempted\r\nrevolution do more than secession? And if not--and the oath and the\r\nobligation remain--and the President does his duty and undertakes to\r\nenforce the laws, and secession or revolution resists, what then? War!\r\nCivil war!\r\n\r\nMr. President, let us not rush headlong into that unfathomable gulf.\r\nLet us not tempt this unutterable woe. We offer you a plain and\r\nhonorable mode of adjusting all difficulties. It is a mode which, we\r\nbelieve, will receive the sanction of the people. We pledge ourselves\r\nhere that we will do all in our power to obtain their sanction for it.\r\nIs it too much to ask you, gentlemen of the South, to meet us on this\r\nhonorable and practicable ground? Will you not, at least, concede this\r\nto the country?\r\n\r\nThe question on agreeing to said amendment resulted in the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\r\n     and Virginia--11.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I wish now to offer an amendment which embraces an\r\nunconditional proposition for the call of a Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. BRONSON:--This has been voted down already.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--What changes do you gentlemen from Pennsylvania and\r\nOhio wish to make in the report of the committee? Would you adopt that\r\nreport in a General Convention?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Chair rules that the amendment offered by the\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania is not in order.\r\n\r\nMessrs. WILMOT, CHASE, CORNING, and BRONSON then entered their\r\ndissents from their respective States upon the substitute offered by\r\nMr. TUCK.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope now that we may be permitted to take the vote\r\nat once upon the report of the majority.\r\n\r\nMr. REID:--Before this vote is taken, I deem it my duty to myself and\r\nmy State to make a remark.\r\n\r\nI came here disposed to agree upon terms that would be mutually\r\nsatisfactory to both sections of the Union. I would agree to any fair\r\nterms now, but the propositions contained in the report of the\r\nmajority, as that report now stands, can never receive my assent. I\r\ncannot recommend them to Congress or to the people of my own State.\r\nThey do not settle the material questions involved; they contain no\r\nsufficient guarantees for the rights of the South. Therefore, in good\r\nfaith to the Conference and to the country, I here state that I cannot\r\nand will not agree to them.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--If the gentlemen from the South, after we have yielded\r\nso much as we have, assert that these propositions will not be\r\nsatisfactory to the slave States, I, for one, will not degrade myself\r\nby voting for them.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I insist now upon taking the vote.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The rules of the Conference do not require the vote to\r\nbe taken upon this proposition by sections.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--We have not heretofore adhered to the rules. Let us\r\nvote then on the whole as a proposition, and not by sections.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I think we should take the vote by sections. It is\r\ncertainly within the discretion of the President to rule that the vote\r\nmay be so taken. The rules do not apply to an article which is\r\ncomposed of many sections. We certainly should vote upon them\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I desire now to get the amendment which I have\r\nproposed once more before the Conference. I move to amend by adding to\r\nthe first section a clause which shall provide that\r\n\r\n     \"The rights of the slave States shall be protected by all\r\n     the departments of the territorial government during its\r\n     continuance.\"\r\n\r\nBy the section as it now stands, the rights of the North are absolute;\r\nthose of the South should be equally clear. It is true that the\r\nsection contains a distinct recognition of the relation of master and\r\nslave, but this recognition is in negative terms. It is certainly the\r\nduty of the territorial legislature and government to protect these\r\nrights wherever they are invaded. If this is so, why not declare it in\r\nthe provision?\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I desire to ask whether this proposition is in order.\r\n\r\nMr. BROCKENBROUGH:--I insist that it is. I assert the existence of\r\ncertain rights, and I want these rights protected under the\r\nConstitution. Rights without remedies are anomalies of which the law\r\nknows nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. WILMOT:--I feel constrained to oppose any amendment of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Chair is inclined to rule this amendment as not in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--Before the final vote is taken, I wish to say a word by\r\nway of explanation. My colleague says he cannot vote for the report of\r\nthe committee because he does not approve the whole of it. I do not\r\nlike the first article, but the report as a whole is a great\r\nimprovement upon the Constitution as it now stands. I think the report\r\nought to go before the people. If we can secure what the report\r\nproposes, we are certainly no worse off. I wish to submit it to my\r\npeople, and thus have them to judge for themselves whether they will\r\nadopt it.\r\n\r\nMr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina:--I would not say a word were it not\r\nfor the words that have fallen from my colleague--Governor REID. I\r\ncame here to try to save the Union. I have labored hard to that end. I\r\nhope and believe the report of the majority, if adopted, will save the\r\nUnion. I wish to carry these propositions before the people. I believe\r\nthat the people of North Carolina and of the Union will adopt them.\r\nGive us an opportunity to appeal to the generosity of the people of\r\nthe whole Union. Certainly no Southern man can object to submitting\r\nthese propositions to the popular vote.\r\n\r\nMr. LOOMIS:--I am content to vote for the first article.\r\n\r\nMr. CARRUTHERS:--I only desire to say for my State that if you will\r\ngive us these propositions, Tennessee will adopt them, and it will\r\nsink secession beyond any hope of resurrection.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I cannot say that I am gratified with the display\r\nwhich I have just witnessed in these appeals from the Conference to\r\nthe people. We come here to deal with facts, not theories. I do not\r\nspeak with the confidence of some with respect to the action of some\r\nof the people. I know the people of the South, and I tell you this\r\nhollow compromise will never satisfy them, nor will it bring back the\r\nseceded States. We are acting for the people who are not here. We are\r\ntheir delegates that have come here, not to demand indemnity for the\r\npast, but security for the future. This is my opinion. You will see\r\nwhether I am right or not. We could stand upon the CRITTENDEN\r\nproposition or the Virginia alternative. With Virginia in our favor we\r\ncould have stood upon either. You, gentlemen of the North, might as\r\nwell have consented to either as to the report which is now presented.\r\nI desire the preservation of the Union; I would go for this scheme if\r\nthat would accomplish it. But it will not. There is great force in the\r\nstatement of the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. CHASE, in which he says\r\nthere is no importance to a scheme which goes from this Conference to\r\nthe States only by a majority of one or two States. If one or two\r\nStates only, which are here, reject this compromise, it will be\r\nrejected entirely. Once more I say it would have been better for all\r\nto have stood upon the Virginia alternative.\r\n\r\nMr. STOCKTON:--I have not much to say, sir. I rise with a sadness\r\nwhich almost prevents my utterance. I was born at Princeton. My heart\r\nhas always beat for the Union. I have heard these discussions with\r\npain from the commencement. Shall we deliberate over any proposition\r\nwhich shall save the Union? The country is in jeopardy. We are called\r\nupon to save it. New Jersey and Delaware came here for that purpose,\r\nand no other. They have laid aside every other motive; they have\r\nyielded every thing to the general good of the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the majority of the committee meets their concurrence.\r\nRepublicans and Democrats alike, have dropped their opinions, for\r\npolitics should always disappear in the presence of a great question\r\nlike this. Politics should not be thought of in view of the question\r\nof disunion. By what measure of execration will posterity judge a man\r\nwho contributed toward the dissolution of the Union? Shall we stand\r\nhere and higgle about terms when the roar of the tornado is heard that\r\nthreatens to sweep our Government from the face of the earth? Believe\r\nme, sir, this is a question of peace or war.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Rome, Curtius threw himself into the chasm when told by\r\nthe oracle that the sacrifice of his life would save his country.\r\nAlas! is there no Curtius here? The alternative is a dreadful one to\r\ncontemplate if we cannot adopt these propositions and secure peace. It\r\nis useless to attempt to dwarf this movement of the South by the name\r\nof treason. Call it by what name you will, it is a revolution, and\r\nthis is a right which the people of this country have derived in\r\ncommon from their ancestors.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I now move that we proceed to take the vote, and propose\r\nto take it upon the first section of the report of the majority.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLIS:--I move so to amend the rule that when the report is taken\r\nup each section and each distinct proposition shall be voted on\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--I think this motion is out of order, and the question\r\nwill be taken on the motion of the gentleman from Kentucky for the\r\nadoption of the first section, which the Secretary will now read.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. In all the present territory of the United States\r\n     north of the parallel of 36° 30´ of north latitude,\r\n     involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime, is\r\n     prohibited. In all the present territory south of that line,\r\n     the status of persons held to involuntary service or labor,\r\n     as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be\r\n     passed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to hinder\r\n     or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the States\r\n     of this Union to said territory, nor to impair the rights\r\n     arising from said relation; but the same shall be subject to\r\n     judicial cognizance in the Federal courts, according to the\r\n     course of the common law. When any Territory north or south\r\n     of said line, within such boundary as Congress may\r\n     prescribe, shall contain a population equal to that required\r\n     for a member of Congress, it shall, if its form of\r\n     government be republican, be admitted into the Union on an\r\n     equal footing with the original States, with or without\r\n     involuntary servitude, as the Constitution of such State may\r\n     provide.\r\n\r\nThe question on agreeing to said section resulted as follows--Indiana\r\ndeclining to vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee--8.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     Missouri, New York, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\n     and Virginia--11.\r\n\r\nAnd the section was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the votes of their respective\r\nStates: Mr. RUFFIN and Mr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina; Mr. TOTTEN, of\r\nTennessee; Mr. COALTER and Mr. HOUGH, of Missouri; Mr. BRONSON, Mr.\r\nCORNING, Mr. DODGE, Mr. WOOL, and Mr. GRANGER, of New York; Mr.\r\nMEREDITH and Mr. WILMOT, of Pennsylvania; Mr. RIVES and Mr. SUMMERS,\r\nof Virginia; Mr. CLAY and Mr. BUTLER, of Kentucky; and Mr. LOGAN, of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken in the midst of much partially suppressed\r\nexcitement, and the announcement of the vote of different States\r\noccasioned many sharp remarks of dissent or approval. After the vote\r\nwas announced, for some minutes no motion was made, and the delegates\r\nengaged in an informal conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. TURNER finally moved a reconsideration of the vote.\r\n\r\nMr. GRANGER:--To say that I am disappointed by the result of this\r\nvote, would fail to do justice to my feelings. I move that the\r\nConference adjourn until half-past seven o'clock this evening. I think\r\nit well for those gentlemen from the slave States especially, who have\r\nby their votes defeated the compromise we have labored so long and so\r\nearnestly to secure, to take a little time for consideration.\r\nGentlemen we have yielded much to your fears, much to your\r\napprehensions; we have gone to the very verge of propriety in giving\r\nour assent to the committee's report. We have incurred the censure of\r\nsome of our own people, but we were willing to take the risk of all\r\nthis censure in order to allay your apprehensions. We expected you to\r\nmeet us in the path of compromise. Instead of that you reject and\r\nspurn our propositions. Take time, gentlemen, for reflection. Beware\r\nhow you spurn this report, and incur the awful responsibility which\r\nwill follow. Reject it, and if the country is plunged in war, and the\r\nUnion endangered, you are the men who will be held responsible.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have been deeply pained at the manner in which some\r\ngentlemen have here spoken of the possible dissolution of this\r\nGovernment. When, perchance, the rude hand of violence shall here have\r\nseized upon the muniments and archives of our country's history; when\r\nall the monuments of art that time and treasure may here have\r\ngathered, shall be destroyed; when these proud domes shall totter to\r\ntheir fall, and the rank grass wave around their mouldering columns;\r\nwhen the very name of WASHINGTON, instead of stirring the blood to\r\npatriotic action, shall be a byeword and a reproach--then will this\r\npeople feel what was the value of the Union!\r\n\r\nThe motion to reconsider was then adopted by a vote of 14 ayes to 5\r\nnoes, and the Conference adjourned to seven o'clock and thirty minutes\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION--EIGHTEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, TUESDAY, _February 26th, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Conference was called to order pursuant to adjournment by the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope after some of the informal consultations which\r\nhave been held since the adjournment of the Conference this afternoon,\r\nthat we may yet be able to bring our minds together, and to adopt the\r\npropositions recommended by the committee. It is, however, certain\r\nthat the vote had better not be taken this evening. I therefore move\r\nan adjournment until ten o'clock to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nThe motion to adjourn was agreed to; ayes 17, noes 3, and the\r\nConference adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINETEENTH DAY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 27th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference assembled pursuant to adjournment, and was called to\r\norder by President TYLER. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. GURLEY.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The Conference will now proceed to the consideration\r\nof the order of the day, the proposals of amendment to the\r\nConstitution reported by the majority of the committee.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I suppose, under the rules which the Conference has\r\nadopted, discussion of these proposals is no longer in order. I hope\r\nnow the Conference will proceed to the vote. The opinions of each\r\ndelegation are undoubtedly fixed, and cannot be changed by farther\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nI move you, sir, the adoption of the first section of the report as\r\namended, which I ask to have read by the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe section was read by the Secretary, as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. In all the present territory of the United States\r\n     north of the parallel of 36° 30´ of north latitude,\r\n     involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime, is\r\n     prohibited. In all the present territory south of that line,\r\n     the status of persons held to involuntary service or labor,\r\n     as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be\r\n     passed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to hinder\r\n     or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the States\r\n     of this Union to said territory, nor to impair the rights\r\n     arising from said relation; but the same shall be subject to\r\n     judicial cognizance in the Federal courts, according to the\r\n     course of the common law. When any Territory north or south\r\n     of said line, within such boundary as Congress may\r\n     prescribe, shall contain a population equal to that required\r\n     for a member of Congress, it shall, if its form of\r\n     government be republican, be admitted into the Union on an\r\n     equal footing with the original States, with or without\r\n     involuntary servitude, as the Constitution of such State may\r\n     provide.\r\n\r\nThe vote upon said section resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey,\r\n     Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, North\r\n     Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Virginia--8.\r\n\r\nSo the section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe vote of New York being called, Mr. KING, temporary Chairman of the\r\ndelegation, said:\r\n\r\nThe question arises concerning the vote of New York. Mr. FIELD, one of\r\nthe delegates from this State, is necessarily absent from the\r\nConference, having left to attend to the argument of a cause in the\r\nSupreme Court noted for argument this morning. It is his\r\nunderstanding, and with him that of a majority of the delegation, that\r\nthe vote of New York is to be cast against this section, and the whole\r\nreport. Under these circumstances I propose to give the vote of New\r\nYork as it would be given if Mr. FIELD was present.\r\n\r\nMr. CORNING:--I object to this. The vote of that State should be given\r\nas the majority of the commissioners present decide. And I think this\r\nis a matter for the delegation, and that the Conference has nothing to\r\ndo with it.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--An absent member cannot participate in the control of\r\na vote except by general leave of the Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. KING:--If Mr. FIELD is not to be taken into the account, the vote\r\nof New York upon this section is divided.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: I have not heretofore expressed my own opinions upon the\r\naction of the Conference or of delegations; but as much has been said\r\nabout the vote given by New York, or rather the division of the\r\ndelegation, under which no vote was given, it is due to the parties\r\nconcerned that I should state my own understanding of the practice of\r\nthe Conference in this respect. After the rejection of the motion of\r\nMr. CHASE (found on page 209), and the adoption of the proposition of\r\nMr. DENT, so far as my own knowledge goes it was never deemed\r\nnecessary that the entire delegation from a State should be present in\r\norder to cast its vote. I was present all the time, and frequently\r\ncast the vote of my own State upon previous consultation with my\r\ncolleagues, when a majority of the delegation was absent. This was\r\nfrequently done, to my personal knowledge, by other States: by none\r\nmore frequently than Virginia. During several of the sessions the\r\nPresident himself was absent, and the chair was filled for the greater\r\npart of the time by Mr. ALEXANDER, or Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky. I can\r\nrecall to mind several occasions when the vote of Virginia was cast by\r\nMr. SEDDON alone, no other member of his delegation being present.\r\nWhen the question arose upon the vote of New York, I was surprised\r\nthat this point was not insisted upon; but deeming it a matter\r\nexclusively for the delegation from that State to settle, I did not\r\nthink the case one in which others should interfere. L.E.C.]\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--The vote of Kansas is also divided.\r\n\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN:--The vote of Indiana is divided. The commissioners of\r\nIndiana were appointed by virtue of resolutions passed by the\r\nLegislature of that State, which require them to report to the\r\nLegislature any proposition before voting for it finally, so as to\r\ncommit the State either for or against it. It is impossible, under the\r\ncircumstances, to submit this proposition of amendment to the\r\nLegislature of Indiana for approval or rejection. Indiana, therefore,\r\ndeclines to vote.\r\n\r\nMr. SLAUGHTER:--As the delegation from Indiana declines to cast its\r\nvote, I desire to have my individual vote entered in the affirmative\r\nupon this section.\r\n\r\nMr. ELLIS:--For the same reason I desire to have my vote entered in\r\nthe negative.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their respective\r\nStates: Mr. CLAY and Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky; Mr. RUFFIN and Mr.\r\nMOREHEAD, of North Carolina; Mr. MEREDITH and Mr. WILMOT, of\r\nPennsylvania; Mr. TOTTEN, of Tennessee; Mr. COOK, of Illinois; Mr.\r\nRIVES and Mr. SUMMERS, of Virginia; and Mr. CHASE and Mr. WOLCOTT, of\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move the adoption of the second section of the report\r\nas amended, and ask that it may be read.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read it as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 2. No territory shall be acquired by the United\r\n     States, except by discovery, and for naval and commercial\r\n     stations, depots, and transit routes, without the\r\n     concurrence of a majority of all the Senators from States\r\n     which allow involuntary servitude, and a majority of all the\r\n     Senators from States which prohibit that relation; nor shall\r\n     territory be acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a\r\n     majority of the Senators from each class of States\r\n     hereinbefore mentioned be cast as a part of the two-thirds\r\n     majority necessary to the ratification of such treaty.\r\n\r\nThe vote on the adoption of section two was taken, and resulted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Vermont--8.\r\n\r\nNew York and Kansas were divided.\r\n\r\nSo the section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their States: Mr.\r\nMEREDITH and Mr. WILMOT, of Pennsylvania; Mr. RUFFIN and Mr. MOREHEAD,\r\nof North Carolina; Mr TYLER, of Virginia; Mr. CLAY, of Kentucky; and\r\nMr. HACKLEMAN and Mr. ORTH, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I now move the adoption of the third section of the\r\nreport as amended, and request that it may be read.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proceeded to read as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 3. Neither the Constitution nor any amendment\r\n     thereof shall be construed to give Congress power to\r\n     regulate, abolish, or control, within any State, the\r\n     relation established or recognized by the laws thereof\r\n     touching persons held to labor or involuntary service\r\n     therein, nor to interfere with or abolish involuntary\r\n     service in the District of Columbia without the consent of\r\n     Maryland and without the consent of the owners, or making\r\n     the owners who do not consent just compensation; nor the\r\n     power to interfere with or prohibit representatives and\r\n     others from bringing with them to the District of Columbia,\r\n     retaining and taking away, persons so held to labor or\r\n     service; nor the power to interfere with or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in places under the exclusive\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States within those States and\r\n     Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor\r\n     the power to prohibit the removal or transportation of\r\n     persons held to labor or involuntary service in any State or\r\n     Territory of the United States to any other State or\r\n     Territory thereof, where it is established or recognized by\r\n     law or usage; and the right during transportation, by sea or\r\n     river, of touching at ports, shores, and landings, and of\r\n     landing in case of distress, shall exist; but not the right\r\n     of transit in or through any State or Territory, or of sale\r\n     or traffic, against the laws thereof. Nor shall Congress\r\n     have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation on\r\n     persons held to labor or service than on land.\r\n\r\n     The bringing into the District of Columbia of persons held\r\n     to labor or service for sale, or placing them in depots to\r\n     be afterwards transferred to other places for sale as\r\n     merchandise, is prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe question on the adoption of said section resulted in the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\n     Tennessee, and Virginia--12.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New\r\n     Hampshire, and Vermont--7.\r\n\r\nNew York and Kansas were divided.\r\n\r\nSo the section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their States: Mr.\r\nCLAY, of Kentucky; Mr. COOK, of Illinois; Mr. SLAUGHTER, of Indiana;\r\nand Mr. CHASE, and Mr. WOLCOTT, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move the adoption of the fourth section of the report\r\nas amended.\r\n\r\nAnd the Secretary read it as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the\r\n     fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to\r\n     prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and\r\n     through the action of their judicial and ministerial\r\n     officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from\r\n     labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.\r\n\r\nThe question on the adoption of said section resulted in the following\r\nvote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,\r\n     Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,\r\n     Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and\r\n     Virginia--15.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire--4.\r\n\r\nNew York and Kansas were divided.\r\n\r\nAnd the section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their respective\r\nStates: Mr. BALDWIN, of Connecticut; Mr. HACKLEMAN and Mr. ORTH, of\r\nIndiana; and Mr. CHASE and Mr. WOLCOTT, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I now move the adoption of the fifth section of the\r\nreport as amended.\r\n\r\nIt was read by the Secretary as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 5. The foreign slave-trade is hereby forever\r\n     prohibited; and it shall be the duty of Congress to pass\r\n     laws to prevent the importation of slaves, coolies, or\r\n     persons held to service or labor, into the United States and\r\n     the Territories from places beyond the limits thereof.\r\n\r\nThe vote on the adoption of this section resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,\r\n     Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire,\r\n     Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--16.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and\r\n     Virginia--5.\r\n\r\nSo this section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their respective\r\nStates: Mr. BALDWIN, of Connecticut; Mr. CLAY, of Kentucky; Mr. RUFFIN\r\nand Mr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina; Mr. WOLCOTT and Mr. CHASE, of\r\nOhio; and Mr. HACKLEMAN and Mr. ORTH, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move the adoption of the sixth section of the report\r\nas amended, and desire that the Secretary may read that also.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 6. The first, third, and fifth sections, together\r\n     with this section of these amendments, and the third\r\n     paragraph of the second section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution, and the third paragraph of the second section\r\n     of the fourth article thereof, shall not be amended or\r\n     abolished without the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\nThe vote on the adoption of this section stood as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New\r\n     Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Kansas--11.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\n     North Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Virginia--9.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York was divided.\r\n\r\nAnd this section was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their States:--Mr.\r\nRUFFIN and Mr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina; Mr. CHASE and Mr. WOLCOTT,\r\nof Ohio; Mr. COOK, of Illinois; and Mr. SUMMERS and Mr. RIVES, of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--I move the adoption of the seventh section of the\r\nreport, as amended.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United\r\n     States shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive\r\n     from labor, in all cases where the marshal, or other\r\n     officer, whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was\r\n     prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation from\r\n     mobs or riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such\r\n     fugitive was rescued by like violence or intimidation, and\r\n     the owner thereby deprived of the same; and the acceptance\r\n     of such payment shall preclude the owner from further claim\r\n     to such fugitive. Congress shall provide by law for securing\r\n     to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities\r\n     of citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\nThe vote on the adoption of this section was as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New\r\n     Jersey, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\n     Tennessee, and Kansas--12.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina,\r\n     Vermont, and Virginia--7.\r\n\r\nThe vote of New York was divided.\r\n\r\nSo this last section was also adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen dissented from the vote of their respective\r\nStates:--Mr. RUFFIN and Mr. MOREHEAD, of North Carolina; Mr. TOTTEN of\r\nTennessee; Mr. HACKLEMAN and Mr. ORTH, of Indiana; and Mr. CHASE and\r\nMr. WOLCOTT, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--The sections which have been adopted severally, as a whole\r\nmay not be acceptable to a majority of the Conference. They have been\r\nadopted by different votes and different majorities. I think a vote\r\nshould be taken upon them collectively, in order that we may know\r\nwhether, as a single proposition, they meet the approbation of the\r\nConference. I move that a vote be taken upon the several sections as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--It is the opinion of the Chair that this motion is not\r\nin order. Each section, when once approved by a majority of votes,\r\nstands as the order of the Conference. These sections have been\r\nseverally taken up, amended, and adopted, and no further vote is\r\nnecessary or proper, except by way of reconsideration.\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--I think the motion an important one, and with all\r\ndeference, appeal from the decision of the Chair to the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:--The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand\r\nas the order of the Conference?\r\n\r\nMr. CHASE:--As I have no wish except to secure a fair vote, and the\r\nopinion of the Chair may be technically correct, I will withdraw my\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--Having adopted the report of the committee, I think now\r\nthere should be an expression of the Conference upon the question of\r\nsecession. I therefore move the adoption of the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, As the sense of this Convention, that the\r\n     highest political duty of every citizen of the United States\r\n     is his allegiance to the Federal Government created by the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and that no State of this\r\n     Union has any constitutional right to secede therefrom, or\r\n     to absolve the citizens of such State from their allegiance\r\n     to the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--I move to lay that resolution on the table. This is a\r\nConvention to propose amendments to the Constitution, not to make\r\ncommentaries upon that instrument.\r\n\r\nMr. CLEVELAND:--I ask a vote by States.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken by States, and resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode\r\n     Island, Vermont, and Kansas--12.\r\n\r\nAnd the Convention refused to lay the resolution upon the table.\r\n\r\nMr. COALTER:--I offer the following amendment: strike out all after\r\nthe word resolve, and insert as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The term of office of all Presidents and Vice-Presidents of\r\n     the United States, hereafter elected, shall be six years;\r\n     and any person once elected to either of said offices shall\r\n     ever after be ineligible to the same office.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. COALTER was rejected by a _viva voce_ vote.\r\n\r\nMr. SEDDON:--I now move to amend by striking out all after the word\r\n\"resolved\" in Mr. FRANKLIN'S resolution, and insert a series of\r\namendments hitherto proposed by myself, as follows:\r\n\r\n     To secure concert and promote harmony between the\r\n     slaveholding and non-slaveholding sections of the Union, the\r\n     assent of the majority of the Senators from the slaveholding\r\n     States, and of the majority of the Senators from the\r\n     non-slaveholding States, shall be requisite to the validity\r\n     of all action of the Senate, on which the ayes and noes may\r\n     be called by five Senators.\r\n\r\n     And on a written declaration, signed and presented for\r\n     record on the Journal of the Senate by a majority of the\r\n     Senators from either the non-slaveholding or slaveholding\r\n     States, of their want of confidence in any officer or\r\n     appointee of the Executive, exercising functions exclusively\r\n     or continuously within the class of States, or any of them,\r\n     which the signers represent, then such officer shall be\r\n     removed by the Executive; and if not removed at the\r\n     expiration of ten days from the presentation of such\r\n     declaration, the office shall be deemed vacant, and open to\r\n     new appointment.\r\n\r\n     The connection of every State with the Union is recognized\r\n     as depending on the continuing assent of its people, and\r\n     compulsion shall in no case, nor under any form, be\r\n     attempted by the Government of the Union against a State\r\n     acting in its collective or organic capacity. Any State, by\r\n     the action of a convention of its people, assembled pursuant\r\n     to a law of its legislature, is held entitled to dissolve\r\n     its relation to the Federal Government, and withdraw from\r\n     the Union; and, on due notice given of such withdrawal to\r\n     the Executive of the Union, he shall appoint two\r\n     commissioners, to meet two commissioners to be appointed by\r\n     the Governor of the State, who, with the aid, if needed from\r\n     the disagreement of the commissioners, of an umpire, to be\r\n     selected by a majority of them, shall equitably adjudicate\r\n     and determine finally a partition of the rights and\r\n     obligations of the withdrawing State; and such adjudication\r\n     and partition being accomplished, the withdrawal of such\r\n     State shall be recognized by the Executive, and announced by\r\n     public proclamation to the world.\r\n\r\n     But such withdrawing State shall not afterwards be\r\n     readmitted into the Union without the assent of two-thirds\r\n     of the States constituting the Union at the time of the\r\n     proposed readmission.\r\n\r\nI desire to get these amendments on the Journal. It is my duty to\r\noffer them, and I wish the Journal to show that I have performed that\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nMr. FRANKLIN:--I then move to lay the amendment on the table, and to\r\ngive the gentleman leave to have it inserted in the Journal. That will\r\naccomplish his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken on the motion to lay the amendment on the\r\ntable, and resulted in an affirmative vote.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--I regard the mission of this Convention as now performed,\r\nand I hope we shall take up no new questions, which can only distract\r\nand divide us. I therefore move to postpone the consideration of this\r\nresolution indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe question was taken on Mr. RUFFIN'S motion, with the following\r\nresult:--\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania--7.\r\n\r\nThe vote of New York was divided.\r\n\r\nMessrs. DUNCAN and AMES dissented from the vote of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nMr. GUTHRIE:--It will be necessary that this proposition be presented\r\nto Congress in an authentic form, and I suppose it will not be\r\nnecessary for the Convention to continue its sessions until this\r\npresentation is made. I therefore offer the following preamble:\r\n\r\n     TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\n     The Convention assembled upon the invitation of the State of\r\n     Virginia to adjust the unhappy differences which now disturb\r\n     the peace of the Union and threaten its continuance, make\r\n     known to the Congress of the United States that their body\r\n     convened in the city of Washington on the 4th instant, and\r\n     continued in session until the 27th.\r\n\r\n     There were in the body, when action was taken upon that\r\n     which is here submitted, one hundred and thirty-three\r\n     commissioners, representing the following States: Maine, New\r\n     Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas.\r\n\r\n     They have approved what is herewith submitted, and\r\n     respectfully request that your honorable body will submit it\r\n     to conventions in the States as an article of amendment to\r\n     the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. RANDOLPH:--I move the adoption of the preamble, and that the same,\r\nwith the propositions already adopted, be authenticated by the present\r\nSecretary, and that all be presented by the President of this\r\nConvention to the Senate and House of Representatives, with a\r\nrespectful request for their passage.\r\n\r\nThis motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. BARRINGER:--As the labors of the Convention are now closed, I\r\npresume there is no occasion for continuing the injunction of secrecy.\r\nAs notes of the proceedings have been taken with a view, I presume, to\r\npublication, I now move that the injunction of secrecy against\r\nspeaking of the action of the Convention, or the publication of its\r\nproceedings, be removed.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mr. BARRINGER was agreed to by a _viva voce_ vote.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON:--I desire here to have printed in the Journal the\r\nfollowing resolution.\r\n\r\nLeave was granted to Mr. JOHNSON as requested, and his resolution was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while the adoption, by the States of South\r\n     Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\n     and Texas, of ordinances declaring the dissolution of their\r\n     relation with the Union, is an event deeply to be deplored;\r\n     and while abstaining from any judgment on their conduct, we\r\n     would express the earnest hope that they may soon see cause\r\n     to resume their honored places in this Confederacy of\r\n     States; yet to the end that such return may be facilitated,\r\n     and from the conviction that the Union being formed by the\r\n     assent of the people of the respective States, and being\r\n     compatible only with freedom, and the republican\r\n     institutions guaranteed to each, cannot and ought not to be\r\n     maintained by force, we deprecate any effort by the Federal\r\n     Government to coerce in any form the said States to reunion\r\n     or submission, as tending to irreparable breach, and leading\r\n     to incalculable ills; and we earnestly invoke the abstinence\r\n     from all counsels or measures of compulsion toward them.\r\n\r\nMr. POLLOCK:--The Committee on Finance have made an examination of the\r\nexpenses which have been incurred for printing, stationery, &c., by\r\nthe Conference. It has been, already stated that the expense of\r\nprinting the Journal is met by the city of Washington. The additional\r\nexpense incurred amounts to $735. If this is equally apportioned among\r\nthe States represented it will amount to $35 each. It is for the\r\nConference to decide in what manner the assessment shall be made.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWNE:--I offer the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the report of the committee be received and\r\n     accepted; that the committee be continued, and requested to\r\n     make the necessary disbursements; and that the States now\r\n     pay over the sum assessed to the chairman.\r\n\r\nAnd the resolution was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. LOOMIS:--I take great pleasure in presenting to the Conference the\r\nfollowing letter, which has been addressed by the proprietors of the\r\nhall to the Secretary. I ask that the letter may be read, and I also\r\noffer the following resolution.\r\n\r\nThe letter was read, as follows:\r\n\r\n     CRAFTS J. WRIGHT, ESQ.,\r\n       _Secretary Conference Convention_:\r\n\r\n     SIR:--Please inform the Convention that we have tendered,\r\n     free of charge, the use of our Hall and lights, which they\r\n     have occupied. We hope the use may be sanctified by\r\n     restoring peace to the Union.\r\n\r\n     We are, respectfully, &c.,\r\n\r\n     J.C. & H.A. WILLARD.\r\n\r\n     _February 23d, 1861._\r\n\r\nAnd the resolution, which was unanimously adopted, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Convention are justly\r\n     due, and are hereby given, to the Messrs. Willard, for the\r\n     liberal and generous tender, free of charge, of the use of\r\n     the Hall and the lights, for the purposes expressed in their\r\n     letter to the Secretary; and that the Secretary be requested\r\n     to communicate to them a copy of this resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. DODGE offered the following resolution, and that, too, was\r\nunanimously agreed to:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Convention are justly\r\n     due and hereby given to the Mayor and Council of the city of\r\n     Washington, for their kindness and liberality to the members\r\n     of this Convention, in defraying so large an amount of their\r\n     expenses for printing and stationery, and also for the\r\n     officers to protect this hall and the members from intrusion\r\n     whilst in session, and that the Secretary be requested to\r\n     communicate the same to said parties.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. RANDOLPH, the thanks of the Conference were tendered\r\nto the clergymen of the city for their services during the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the Conference were also presented to the Secretary and\r\nhis assistants.\r\n\r\nMr. EWING:--I move the adoption of the following:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Convention be tendered\r\n     to the President, for the dignified and impartial manner in\r\n     which he has presided over the deliberations of this body.\r\n\r\nThe resolution being seconded by Mr. HACKLEMAN, it was unanimously\r\nadopted; whereupon President TYLER addressed the Conference as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN OF THE CONFERENCE:\r\n\r\n\"The labors of this Convention are drawing to a close. Before we\r\nseparate never in this world to meet again, I am much pleased that the\r\nresolution you have just adopted gives me an opportunity of uttering a\r\nfew words of congratulation and farewell.\r\n\r\n\"We came together at a most important and critical time. One of the\r\noldest members of the American Union, a commonwealth which had\r\ncontributed its full share to the honor and glory of the\r\nnation--having as great interests at stake as any other member of the\r\nsisterhood of States--summoned you here to consider new additions to\r\nour Constitution, which the experience of near three-quarters of a\r\ncentury had taught us were required. I expected from the first that\r\nyou would approach the consideration of the new and important\r\nquestions which must arise here, with that patriotism and intelligence\r\nwhich belongs to the descendants of the patriots of the Revolution and\r\nthe statesmen of the Convention of 1787. I have not been disappointed.\r\nIn the whole course of a public life, much longer than usually falls\r\nto the lot of man, I have been associated with many bodies of my\r\nfellow-citizens, convened for legislative or other purposes, but I\r\nhere declare that it has never been my good fortune to meet with an\r\nassociation of more intelligent, thoughtful, or patriotic men, than\r\nthat over which I have been here called to preside. I cannot but hope\r\nand believe that the blessing of GOD will follow and rest upon the\r\nresult of your labors, and that such result will bring to our country\r\nthat quiet and peace which every patriotic heart so earnestly desires.\r\nI thank you most sincerely for that kindness and partiality on your\r\npart which induced you to call me to the honorable position of your\r\npresiding officer, and for the courtesy so uniformly extended in the\r\ndischarge of the responsible duties of that position.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, farewell! I go to finish the work you have assigned me, of\r\npresenting your recommendations to the two Houses of Congress, and to\r\nask those bodies to lay your proposals of amendment before the people\r\nof the American Union. Although these proposals are not in all\r\nrespects what I could have desired--although I should have preferred\r\nthe adoption of those recommended by the Legislature of Virginia,\r\nbecause I know they would have been acceptable to my own constituents,\r\nstill it is my duty to give them my official approval and support. It\r\nis not to be expected that entire unanimity of opinion should exist\r\namong the representatives of so large a population, and so many\r\ndiversified interests, as now comprise the Republic of the United\r\nStates. It is probable that the result to which you have arrived is\r\nthe best that under all the circumstances could be expected. So far as\r\nin me lies, therefore, I shall recommend its adoption.\r\n\r\n\"May you have a happy and safe return to your constituents and your\r\nfamilies! May you all inculcate among your people a spirit of mutual\r\nforbearance and concession; and may GOD protect our country and the\r\nUnion of these States, which was committed to us as the blood-bought\r\nlegacy of our heroic ancestors!\"\r\n\r\nMr. WICKLIFFE:--I move that the Convention do now adjourn, its labors\r\nhaving come to an end; and I would suggest that the delegates meet\r\ninformally and take leave of each other at three o'clock this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWNE moved that the Conference adjourn without day, and his\r\nmotion was adopted by the following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey,\r\n     Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont--9.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, and\r\n     Pennsylvania--5.\r\n\r\nAnd the Conference adjourned without day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nBefore the final vote was taken upon the proposals of amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, reported by the General Committee\r\nof which Mr. GUTHRIE was Chairman, and the votes upon the various\r\nsubstitutes offered for such proposals, there were _twenty-one_ States\r\nrepresented in the Conference.\r\n\r\nMaine and Iowa were represented by their respective Congressional\r\ndelegations; Tennessee, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Delaware, Illinois,\r\nNew Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and\r\nMissouri, by delegates appointed by their respective Legislatures,\r\nunder joint resolutions which are here inserted; New Hampshire,\r\nVermont, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, Indiana, and Kansas,\r\nby delegates appointed by their respective Governors.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of Virginia originated the call for the Conference.\r\n\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, and Oregon were not\r\nrepresented. South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nArkansas, and Texas had passed ordinances of secession previous to the\r\nmeeting of the Conference. Messrs. BENJAMIN and SLIDELL, the Senators\r\nfrom Louisiana, withdrew from the Senate of the United States before\r\nthe proposed amendments to the Constitution were reported to the\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions of their respective States were presented by\r\nthe delegates to the Committee on Credentials, and were ordered by the\r\nConference to be printed, on the motion of Mr. CHASE.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See page 64, Proceedings of the Conference.]\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS _proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates._\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee_, That a\r\nConvention of delegates from all the slaveholding States should\r\nassemble at Nashville, Tennessee, or such other place as a majority of\r\nthe States coöperating may designate, on the fourth day of February,\r\n1861, to digest and define a basis upon which, if possible, the\r\nFederal Union and the constitutional rights of the slave States may be\r\nperpetuated and preserved.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee\r\nappoint a number of delegates to said Convention, of our ablest and\r\nwisest men, equal to our whole delegation in Congress; and that the\r\nGovernor of Tennessee immediately furnish copies of these resolutions\r\nto the Governors of the slaveholding States, and urge the\r\nparticipation of such States in said Convention.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in the opinion of this General Assembly, such plan of\r\nadjustment should embrace the following propositions as amendments to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\n1. A declaratory amendment that African slaves, as held under the\r\ninstitutions of the slaveholding States, shall be recognized as\r\nproperty, and entitled to the _status_ of other property, in the\r\nStates where slavery exists, in all places within the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of Congress in the slave States, in all the Territories\r\nsouth of 36° 30´; in the District of Columbia; in transit; and whilst\r\ntemporarily sojourning with the owner in the non-slaveholding States\r\nand Territories north of 36° 30´, and when fugitives from the owner,\r\nin the several places above named, as well as in all places in the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of Congress in the non-slaveholding States.\r\n\r\n2. That all the territory now owned, or which may be hereafter\r\nacquired by the United States south of the parallel of 36° 30´;\r\nAfrican slavery shall be recognized as existing, and be protected by\r\nall the departments of the Federal and Territorial Governments, and in\r\nall north of that line, now owned, or to be acquired, it shall not be\r\nrecognized as existing; and whenever States formed out of any of said\r\nterritory south of said line, having a population equal to that of a\r\ncongressional district, shall apply for admission into the Union, the\r\nsame shall be admitted as slave States, whilst States north of the\r\nline, formed out of said territory, and having a population equal to a\r\nCongressional district, shall be admitted without slavery; but the\r\nStates formed out of said territory north and south having been\r\nadmitted as members of the Union, shall have all the powers over the\r\ninstitution of slavery possessed by the other States of the Union.\r\n\r\n3. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in places under its\r\nexclusive jurisdiction, and situate within the limits of States that\r\npermit the holding of slaves.\r\n\r\n4. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery within the District\r\nof Columbia, as long as it exists in the adjoining States of Virginia\r\nand Maryland, or either, nor without the consent of the inhabitants,\r\nnor without just compensation made to such owners of slaves as do not\r\nconsent to such abolishment. Nor shall Congress at any time prohibit\r\nthe officers of the Federal Government or members of Congress whose\r\nduties require them to be in said District, from bringing with them\r\ntheir slaves, and holding them as such, during the time their duties\r\nmay require them to remain there, and afterwards take them from the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n5. Congress shall have no power to prohibit or hinder the\r\ntransportation of slaves from one State to another, or the Territory\r\nin which slaves are by law permitted to be held, whether that\r\ntransportation be by land, navigable rivers, or by seas.\r\n\r\n6. In addition to the fugitive slave clause, provide that when a slave\r\nhas been demanded of the Executive authority of the State to which he\r\nhas fled, if he is not delivered, and the owner permitted to carry him\r\nout of the State in peace, the State so failing to deliver, shall pay\r\nto the owner the value of such slave, and such damages as he may have\r\nsustained in attempting to reclaim his slave, and secure his right of\r\naction in the Supreme Court of the United States, with execution\r\nagainst the property of such State and the individuals thereof.\r\n\r\n7. No future amendment of the Constitution shall affect the six\r\npreceding articles, nor the third paragraph of the second section of\r\nthe first article of the Constitution, nor the third paragraph of the\r\nsecond section of the fourth article of the Constitution; and no\r\namendments shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or\r\ngive to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any\r\nof the States by whose laws it is, or may be allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n8. That slave property shall be rendered secure in transit through, or\r\nwhilst temporarily sojourning in, non-slaveholding States or\r\nTerritories, or in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n9. An amendment to the effect that all fugitives are to be deemed\r\nthose offending the laws within the jurisdiction of the State, and who\r\nescape therefrom to other States; and that it is the duty of each\r\nState to suppress armed invasion of another State.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That said Convention of the slaveholding States having\r\nagreed upon a basis of adjustment satisfactory to themselves, should,\r\nin the opinion of this General Assembly, refer it to a Convention of\r\nall the States, slaveholding and non-slaveholding, in the manner\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nIt should invite all States friendly to such plan of adjustment, to\r\nelect delegates in such manner as to reflect the popular will, to\r\nassemble in a Constitutional Convention of all the States North and\r\nSouth, to be held at Richmond, Virginia, on the ---- day of February,\r\n1861, to revise and perfect such plan of adjustment, for its reference\r\nfor final ratification and adoption by a Convention of the States\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That should a plan of adjustment, satisfactory to the\r\nSouth, not be acceded to by a requisite number of States to perfect\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States, it is the opinion\r\nof this General Assembly that the slaveholding States should adopt for\r\nthemselves the Constitution of the United States, with such\r\namendments as may be satisfactory to the slaveholding States, and that\r\nthey should invite into the Union with them all States of the North\r\nwhich are willing to abide such amended Constitution and frame of\r\nGovernment, severing at once all connections with States refusing such\r\nreasonable guarantees to our future safety; such renewed conditions of\r\nFederal Union being first submitted for ratification to Convention of\r\nall the States respectively.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Governor of the State of Tennessee furnish copies\r\nof these resolutions immediately to the Governors of the\r\nnon-slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nOHIO.\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTIONS _of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio,\r\nrelative to the appointment of Commissioners to the Convention to meet\r\nin Washington on the 4th of February, proximo.

George B.\r\nRodney, Daniel M. Bates, Esq., Dr. Henry Ridgely, Hon. John W.\r\nHouston, and William Cannon, Esq., be, and they are hereby appointed\r\nCommissioners, on behalf of the State of Delaware, to represent the\r\npeople of said State in the Convention to be held at Washington, on\r\nthe fourth day of February next.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in the opinion of this General Assembly, the people\r\nof Delaware are thoroughly devoted to the perpetuity of the Union, and\r\nthat the Commissioners appointed by the foregoing resolution are\r\nexpected to emulate the example set by the immortal patriots who\r\nframed the Federal Constitution, by sacrificing all minor\r\nconsiderations upon the altar of the Union.\r\n\r\n_Resolved, further_, That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of\r\nState to furnish a copy of the above preamble and resolutions to each\r\nof the Commissioners herein and hereby appointed, duly attested under\r\nthe great seal of the State.\r\n\r\n_Resolved, further_, That immediately upon the adoption of the\r\nforegoing preamble and resolutions, it shall be the duty of the Clerk\r\nof the House to transmit to the Secretary of State a copy thereof,\r\ncertified by him; and when the Secretary of State shall have received\r\nsaid copy so certified, it shall be evidence that said preamble and\r\nresolutions were duly adopted by this General Assembly.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, resolutions of the State of Virginia have been communicated\r\nto the General Assembly of this State, proposing the appointment of\r\nCommissioners by the several States to meet in Convention, on the\r\nfourth day of February, A.D. 1861, at Washington.\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring\r\nherein_, That with the earnest desire for the return of harmony and\r\nkind relations among all our sister States, and out of respect to the\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia, the Governor of this State be requested to\r\nappoint five Commissioners on the part of the State of Illinois, to\r\nconfer and consult with the Commissioners of other States who shall\r\nmeet at Washington: _Provided_, That said Commissioners shall at all\r\ntimes be subject to the control of the General Assembly of the State\r\nof Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the appointment of Commissioners by the State of\r\nIllinois, in response to the invitation of the State of Virginia, is\r\n_not_ an expression of opinion on the part of this State that any\r\namendment of the Federal Constitution is requisite to secure to the\r\npeople of the slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security\r\nof their rights, nor an approval of the basis of settlement of our\r\ndifficulties proposed by the State of Virginia, but it is an\r\nexpression of our willingness to unite with the State of Virginia in\r\nan earnest effort to adjust the present unhappy controversies in the\r\nspirit in which the Constitution was originally formed, and\r\nconsistently with its principles.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That while we are willing to appoint Commissioners to meet\r\nin convention with those of other States for consultation upon matters\r\nwhich at present distract our harmony as a nation, we also insist that\r\nthe appropriate and constitutional method of considering and acting\r\nupon the grievances complained of by our sister States, would be by\r\nthe call of a Convention for the amendment of the Constitution in the\r\nmanner contemplated by the fifth article of that instrument; and if\r\nthe States deeming themselves aggrieved, shall request Congress to\r\ncall such Convention, the Legislature of Illinois will and does concur\r\nin such call.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTIONS _in relation to the Union of the States._\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the people of New Jersey, conforming to the opinion of \"the\r\nFather of his Country,\" consider the unity of the Government, which\r\nconstitutes the people of the United States one people, a main pillar\r\nin the edifice of their independence, the support of their\r\ntranquillity at home and peace abroad, of their prosperity, and of\r\nthat liberty which they so highly prize; and properly estimating the\r\nimmense value of their National Union to their individual happiness,\r\nthey cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it as\r\nthe palladium of their political safety and prosperity; therefore,\r\n\r\n1. _Be it resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of\r\nNew Jersey_, That it is the duty of every good citizen, in all\r\nsuitable and proper ways, to stand by and sustain the Union of the\r\nStates as transmitted to us by our fathers.\r\n\r\n2. _And be it resolved_, That the Government of the United States is a\r\nNational Government, and the Union it was designed to perfect is not a\r\nmere compact or league; and that the Constitution was adopted in a\r\nspirit of mutual compromise and concession by the people of the United\r\nStates, and can only be preserved by the constant recognition of that\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n3. _And be it resolved_, That however undoubted may be the right of\r\nthe General Government to maintain its authority and enforce its laws\r\nover all parts of the country, it is equally certain that forbearance\r\nand compromise are indispensable at this crisis to the perpetuity of\r\nthe Union, and that it is the dictate of reason, wisdom, and\r\npatriotism, peacefully to adjust whatever differences exist between\r\nthe different sections of the country.\r\n\r\n4. _And be it resolved_, That the resolutions and propositions\r\nsubmitted to the Senate of the United States by the Honorable John J.\r\nCrittenden, of Kentucky, for the compromise of the questions in\r\ndispute between the people of the northern and of the southern States,\r\nor any other constitutional method that will permanently settle the\r\nquestion of slavery, will be acceptable to the people of the State of\r\nNew Jersey, and the Senators and Representatives in Congress from New\r\nJersey be requested and earnestly urged to support those resolutions\r\nand propositions.\r\n\r\n5. _And be it resolved_, That as the Union of the States is in\r\nimminent danger unless the remedies before suggested be speedily\r\nadopted, then, as a last resort, the State of New Jersey hereby makes\r\napplication, according to the terms of the Constitution, of the\r\nCongress of the United States, to call a Convention (of the United\r\nStates) to propose amendments to said Constitution.\r\n\r\n6. _And be it resolved_, That such of the States as have in force laws\r\nwhich interfere with the constitutional rights of citizens of the\r\nother States, either in regard to their persons or property, or which\r\nmilitate against the just construction of that part of the\r\nConstitution that provides that \"the citizens of each State shall be\r\nentitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the\r\nseveral States,\" are earnestly urged and requested, for the sake of\r\npeace and the Union, to repeal all such laws.\r\n\r\n7. _And be it resolved_, That his Excellency Charles S. Olden, Peter\r\nD. Vroom, Robert F. Stockton, Benjamin Williamson, Joseph F. Randolph,\r\nFrederick T. Frelinghuysen, Rodman M. Price, William O. Alexander, and\r\nThomas J. Stryker, be appointed Commissioners to confer with Congress\r\nand our sister States, and urge upon them the importance of carrying\r\ninto effect the principles and objects of the foregoing resolutions.\r\n\r\n8. _And be it resolved_, That the Commissioners above named, in\r\naddition to their other powers, be authorized to meet with those now\r\nor hereafter to be appointed by our sister State of Virginia, and such\r\nCommissioners of other States as have been, or may be hereafter\r\nappointed, to meet at Washington on the fourth day of February next.\r\n\r\n9. _And be it resolved_, That copies of the foregoing resolutions be\r\nsent to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States, and to the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress from New Jersey, and to the Governors of\r\nthe several States.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS _appointing Commissioners from this State to\r\nmeet Commissioners from other States at Washington, on invitation of\r\nVirginia._\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the State of Virginia, by resolutions of her General\r\nAssembly, passed the 19th instant, has invited such of the\r\nslaveholding and non-slaveholding States as are willing to unite with\r\nher, to meet at Washington, on the fourth of February next, to\r\nconsider, and, if practicable, agree on some suitable adjustment of\r\nour national difficulties; and whereas, the people of New York, while\r\nthey hold the opinion that the Constitution of the United States, as\r\nit is, contains all needful guarantees for the rights of the States,\r\nare nevertheless ready, at all times, to confer with their brethren\r\nupon all alleged grievances; and to do all that can justly be required\r\nof them to allay discontent; therefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That David Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S.\r\nWadsworth, James O.

but the said\r\nCommissioners shall at all times be subject to the control of this\r\nLegislature, and shall cast five votes to be determined by a majority\r\nof their number.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in thus acceding to the request of Virginia, it is\r\nnot to be understood that this Legislature approves of the\r\npropositions submitted by the General Assembly of that State, or\r\nconcedes the propriety of their adoption by the proposed Convention.\r\nBut while adhering to the position she has heretofore occupied, New\r\nYork will not reject an invitation to a conference, which, by bringing\r\ntogether the men of both sections, holds out the possibility of an\r\nhonorable settlement of our national difficulties, and the restoration\r\nof peace and harmony to the country.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Governor be requested to transmit a copy of the\r\nforegoing resolutions to the Executive of the several States, and also\r\nto the President of the United States, and to inform the Commissioners\r\nwithout delay of their appointment.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the foregoing resolutions be transmitted to the\r\nhonorable the Senate, with a request that they concur therein.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS _to appoint Commissioners to a Convention of the States._\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Virginia has invited a\r\nmeeting of Commissioners from the several States of this Union, to be\r\nheld in the City of Washington, on the fourth day of February next, to\r\nconsider, and if practicable, agree upon some suitable adjustment of\r\nthe unhappy differences which now disturb the business of the country\r\nand threaten the dissolution of this Union:\r\n\r\n_And whereas_, in the opinion of this Legislature, no reasonable cause\r\nexists for this extraordinary excitement which now pervades some of\r\nthe States, in relation to their domestic institutions, and while\r\nPennsylvania still adheres to, and cannot surrender the principles\r\nwhich she has always entertained on the subject of slavery, this\r\nLegislature is willing to accept the invitation of Virginia, and unite\r\nwith her in an earnest effort to restore the peace of the country, by\r\nsuch means as may be consistent with the principles upon which the\r\nConstitution is founded; therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met_, That the\r\ninvitation of the Legislature of Virginia to her sister States, for\r\nthe appointment of Commissioners to meet in the City of Washington, on\r\nthe fourth of February next, be and the same is hereby accepted;

that\r\nPennsylvania will cordially unite with the other States of the Union\r\nin the adoption of any proper constitutional measures adequate to\r\nguarantee and secure a more strict and faithful observance of the\r\nsecond section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which provides, among other things, that \"the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens\r\nof the several States,\" and that no person held to service or labor in\r\none State under the law thereof, escaping into another, shall in\r\nconsequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such\r\nservice or labor, but shall be delivered up on the claim of the party\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nRESOLVE _for the appointment of Commissioners to attend a Convention\r\nto be held in the City of Washington._\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is desirous of a full and\r\nfree conference with the General Government, and with any or all of\r\nthe other States of the Union, at any time and on every occasion when\r\nsuch conference may promote the welfare of the country;

For several weeks Senators have declined to make an effort\r\nto call up the propositions of my colleague, for the reason that\r\ncertain Peace Commissioners were in session in this capital, convened\r\nat the call of the State of Virginia. I am confident now that that\r\nCommission, or Peace Congress, or Conference, or whatever you may call\r\nit, will not accomplish any thing. Indeed, certain facts have fallen\r\nunder my notice, that cause me to believe that it has been the fixed\r\npurpose of certain Republicans that that Conference should not\r\naccomplish any thing. I believe, sir, that certain commissioners from\r\nStates of this Union have been brought into that Conference for the\r\npurpose of preventing them from agreeing on any thing. I have thought\r\nthat for some time past. A friend sent to me yesterday the Detroit\r\n_Free Press_, containing two letters from the distinguished Senators\r\nfrom the State of Michigan to their Governor, which, I think, clearly\r\nand fully establish the fact that the Republicans, a portion of them\r\nat least, instead of sending commissioners to that Conference with a\r\nview to inaugurate something that would compromise the difficulties by\r\nwhich we are surrounded, and save this country from ruin, have\r\nabsolutely been engaged in the work of sending delegates there to\r\nprevent that commission from doing any thing. I send this paper to the\r\ndesk, and ask the Secretary to read these letters.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, _February 15th, 1861._\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: When Virginia proposed a Convention in Washington,\r\n     in reference to the disturbed condition of the country, I\r\n     regarded it as another effort to debauch the public mind,\r\n     and a step toward obtaining that concession which the\r\n     imperious slave power so insolently demands. I have no doubt\r\n     at present but that was the design. I was therefore pleased\r\n     that the Legislature of Michigan was not disposed to put\r\n     herself in a position to be controlled by such influences.\r\n\r\n     The Convention has met here, and within a few days the\r\n     aspect of things has materially changed. Every free State, I\r\n     think, except Michigan and Wisconsin, is represented; and we\r\n     have been assured by friends upon whom we can rely, that if\r\n     those two States should send delegations of true,\r\n     unflinching men, there would probably be a majority in favor\r\n     of the Constitution as it is, who would frown down rebellion\r\n     by the enforcement of laws. These friends have urged us to\r\n     recommend the appointment of delegates from our State; and,\r\n     in compliance with their request, Mr. CHANDLER and myself\r\n     telegraphed to you last night. It cannot be doubted that the\r\n     recommendations of this Convention will have a very\r\n     considerable influence upon the public mind, and upon the\r\n     action of Congress.\r\n\r\n     I have a great disinclination to any interference with what\r\n     should properly be submitted to the wisdom and discretion\r\n     of the Legislature, in which I place great reliance; but I\r\n     hope I shall be pardoned for suggesting that it may be\r\n     justifiable and proper, by any honorable means, to avert the\r\n     lasting disgrace which will attach to a free people who, by\r\n     the peaceful exercise of the ballot, have just released\r\n     themselves from the tyranny of slavery, if they should now\r\n     succumb to treasonable threats, and again submit to a\r\n     degrading thraldom. If it should be deemed proper to send\r\n     delegates, I think, if they could be here by the 20th, it\r\n     would be in time.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor, with much respect, to be truly yours,\r\n\r\n     K.S. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     To his Excellency Governor BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--I submit whether it is in order to go into a\r\ndiscussion on this motion. If so, I suppose this must be regarded as a\r\npart of the speech.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair understood the discussion to be in\r\norder. It was certainly not objected to at the time the Senator\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--It is not too late to raise the point.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The motion is to lay aside one bill and take\r\nup other business; and the Chair understood the Senator from Kentucky\r\nto be giving his reasons why he wished that to be done.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--If it is in order, of course I cannot object to it;\r\nbut I raise that question.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Senator from Maine raises the question\r\nwhether this debate is in order.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--There was no objection to my proceeding, and I suppose I\r\nhave a right to go on. I wish the letters read as part of my speech.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--There is no objection to reading them.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair has decided that the Senator from\r\nKentucky is in order.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--I have not yielded, except for the purpose of reading\r\nthese letters.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Is an appeal taken from the decision of the\r\nChair?\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--I take no appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read as follows:\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, _February 11th, 1861._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR GOVERNOR: Governor BINGHAM and myself telegraphed\r\n     you on Saturday, at the request of Massachusetts and New\r\n     York, to send delegates to the Peace or Compromise Congress.\r\n     They admit that we were right and that they were wrong; that\r\n     no Republican State should have sent delegates; but they are\r\n     here and cannot get away. Ohio, Indiana, and Rhode Island\r\n     are caving in, and there is danger of Illinois; and now they\r\n     beg us, for God's sake, to come to their rescue, and save\r\n     the Republican party from rupture. I hope you will send\r\n     _stiff-backed_ men, or none. The whole thing was gotten up\r\n     against my judgment and advice, and will end in thin smoke.\r\n     Still, I hope as a matter of courtesy to some of our erring\r\n     brethren, that you will send the delegates.\r\n\r\n     Truly your friend,\r\n\r\n     Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n     His Excellency AUSTIN BLAIR.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--Some of the manufacturing States think that a fight\r\n     would be awful. Without a little blood-letting this Union\r\n     will not, in my estimation, be worth a rush.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--I think it evident from these letters, that there is, and\r\nhas been, a fixed purpose in certain quarters, that the Peace\r\nConference should do nothing. Indeed, it seems, from the letter of the\r\nSenator from Michigan [Mr. CHANDLER], that while he opposed any\r\nRepublican State going into this Conference, yet, as some of them were\r\nthere, and Indiana, and Illinois, and Ohio, and Rhode Island were\r\nabout to cave in, on the advice of Massachusetts and New York he asked\r\nMichigan to come in and relieve them, and save the Republican party\r\nfrom rupture. Is it possible that the Republican party is to be saved,\r\neven if the Union be destroyed? It is very evident that those\r\n\"stiff-backed\" gentlemen were to be sent here in order to prevent any\r\ncompromise being presented. The object, then, as I stated, on the part\r\nof certain members on the other side of the Chamber, has been to send\r\ndelegates to the Conference for the purpose of preventing any\r\ncompromise measures being proposed by that body. They desire, in the\r\nlanguage of these letters, to save their party from destruction. They\r\nsay that if the Conference should agree on any thing, it would have a\r\ndemoralizing effect upon the people, and upon the two Houses of\r\nCongress. In one word, it will have the effect to make a rupture in\r\nthe Republican party, which, in the estimation of the Senators, is\r\nhigher, holier, and better, it seems, than the Union.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this fact being apparent, that it is not the design\r\nor the intention that the Peace Conference should do any thing, I\r\nthink we should not wait for it any longer, but the Senate should\r\nproceed at once to the consideration of the amendments to the\r\nConstitution proposed by my colleague. I think we had better be\r\nengaged in that work--one that is calculated, if the propositions of\r\nmy colleague should pass, in my opinion, to save the country from\r\nfurther disintegration. I think we had better be at that, than be\r\nappropriating money to support an Army that is to be engaged, it\r\nseems, in the work of blood-letting. The Senator from Michigan thinks\r\nthe Government is not worth a rush until it shall have drawn a little\r\nblood. I hope my motion will prevail, and that we shall lay this bill\r\naside and proceed to the consideration of the measures proposed by my\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\nMr. CHANDLER:--The Senator from Kentucky has read what purports to be\r\na short note that I sent the other day to the Governor of Michigan.\r\nWhether it is a correct copy or not, I cannot say; I kept no copy of\r\nit, nor do I care.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--If the Senator will allow me one word, I will state to\r\nthe Senate that, when I received this paper, yesterday--\r\n\r\nMr. CHANDLER:--I was about to state that.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--I asked both the Senators if the letters were right. They\r\ntold me they kept no copies, but they believed they were substantially\r\nso.\r\n\r\nMr. CHANDLER:--I was going to say that. Now, sir, I desire to answer\r\nthe Senator from Kentucky, and to set myself right on this\r\nquestion--(my position from the first has been well known upon this\r\nquestion, and upon most others)--but, at the earnest solicitation of\r\nthe Senator from Maine, who has charge of this bill, I will forego the\r\nresponse which I intended to make, and which I shall make to the\r\nSenator from Kentucky, for the present, for the purpose of going on\r\nand disposing of the Army appropriation bill. At another day I propose\r\nto give my views more at large upon these compromise measures, that\r\nthe Senator from Kentucky seems so anxious to take up at this time. I\r\nam as anxious as he is to go into that discussion. I am anxious to go\r\ninto it. It is a question that ought to be discussed. It is a question\r\nin which the people of Michigan take a deep interest. They are opposed\r\nto all compromises; they do not believe that any compromise is\r\nnecessary; nor do I. They are prepared to stand by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States as it is; to stand by the Government as it is; ay,\r\nsir, to stand by it to blood, if necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I ask the general permission of the Senate to give notice\r\nthat at three o'clock I shall move to go into executive session; and\r\nif it is not agreed to, I shall then ask that the galleries may be\r\ncleared, for the purpose of disclosing what I consider ought to be\r\npassed on in executive session.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee:--If I can obtain the attention of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky, I wish to make a suggestion. Those resolutions,\r\nas I understood, went over until last Monday at one o'clock, and were\r\nthen to be taken up and considered. I do not know whether the motion\r\nwas made in that way, or whether it was an informal understanding that\r\nthey should be taken up last Monday for consideration; but as the Army\r\nbill is now under consideration, and the time is growing short, would\r\nit not be better to have a night session, and postpone the subject\r\nuntil seven o'clock this evening, and let it be taken up at that time;\r\nand then let this other bill go on to-day? Those who want to make\r\nspeeches on those resolutions could do it to-night; we should thus\r\nsave time and expedite business.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--I think the Senator from Virginia has given an\r\nadditional very good reason for taking up the Army bill, and going\r\nthrough with it; and not postponing it for speeches at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe question being taken by yeas and nays, resulted--yeas 17, nays 27;\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Messrs. Bayard, Bigler, Bragg, Bright, Clingman,\r\n     Douglas, Fitch, Gwin, Hunter, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy,\r\n     Lane, Latham, Mason, Polk, Powell, and Rice--17.\r\n\r\n     NAYS.--Messrs.

HENRY PULESTON,\r\n       _Secretary._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 1. In all the present territory of the United States\r\n     north of the parallel of 36° 30´ of north latitude,\r\n     involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime, is\r\n     prohibited. In all the present territory south of that line,\r\n     the _status_ of persons held to involuntary service or\r\n     labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any\r\n     law be passed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to\r\n     hinder or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the\r\n     States of this Union to said territory, nor to impair the\r\n     rights arising from said relation; but the same shall be\r\n     subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal courts,\r\n     according to the course of the common law. When any\r\n     Territory north or south of said line, within such boundary\r\n     as Congress may prescribe, shall contain a population equal\r\n     to that required for a member of Congress, it shall, if its\r\n     form of government be republican, be admitted into the Union\r\n     on an equal footing with the original States, with or\r\n     without involuntary servitude, as the constitution of such\r\n     State may provide.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. No territory shall be acquired by the United States,\r\n     except by discovery and for naval and commercial stations,\r\n     depots, and transit routes, without the concurrence of a\r\n     majority of all the Senators from States which allow\r\n     involuntary servitude, and a majority of all the Senators\r\n     from States which prohibit that relation; nor shall\r\n     territory be acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a\r\n     majority of the Senators from each class of States\r\n     hereinbefore mentioned be cast as a part of the two thirds\r\n     majority necessary to the ratification of such treaty.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 3. Neither the constitution, nor any amendment thereof,\r\n     shall be construed to give Congress power to regulate,\r\n     abolish, or control, within any State, the relation\r\n     established or recognized by the laws thereof touching\r\n     persons held to labor or involuntary service therein, nor to\r\n     interfere with or abolish involuntary service in the\r\n     District of Columbia without the consent of Maryland and\r\n     without the consent of the owners, or making the owners who\r\n     do not consent just compensation; nor the power to interfere\r\n     with or prohibit Representatives and others from bringing\r\n     with them to the District of Columbia, retaining, and\r\n     taking away, persons so held to labor or service; nor the\r\n     power to interfere with or abolish involuntary service in\r\n     places under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\r\n     within those States and Territories where the same is\r\n     established or recognized; nor the power to prohibit the\r\n     removal or transportation of persons held to labor or\r\n     involuntary service in any State or Territory of the United\r\n     States to any other State or Territory thereof where it is\r\n     established or recognized by law or usage, and the right\r\n     during transportation, by sea or river, of touching at\r\n     ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in case of\r\n     distress, shall exist; but not the right of transit in or\r\n     through any State or Territory, or of sale or traffic,\r\n     against the laws thereof. Nor shall Congress have power to\r\n     authorize any higher rate of taxation on persons held to\r\n     labor or service than on land. The bringing into the\r\n     District of Columbia of persons held to labor or service,\r\n     for sale, or placing them in depots to be afterwards\r\n     transferred to other places for sale as merchandise, is\r\n     prohibited.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the\r\n     fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to\r\n     prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and\r\n     through the action of their judicial and ministerial\r\n     officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from\r\n     labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 5. The foreign slave-trade is hereby forever\r\n     prohibited; and it shall be the duty of Congress to pass\r\n     laws to prevent the importation of slaves, coolies, or\r\n     persons held to service or labor, into the United States and\r\n     the Territories from places beyond the limits thereof.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 6. The first, third, and fifth sections, together with\r\n     this section of those amendments, and the third paragraph of\r\n     the second section of the first article of the Constitution,\r\n     and the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth\r\n     article thereof, shall not be amended or abolished without\r\n     the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United States\r\n     shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive from\r\n     labor, in all cases where the marshal, or other officer,\r\n     whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was prevented\r\n     from so doing by violence or intimidation from mobs or\r\n     riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such fugitive\r\n     was rescued by like violence or intimidation, and the owner\r\n     thereby deprived of the same; and the acceptance of such\r\n     payment shall preclude the owner from further claim to such\r\n     fugitive. Congress shall provide by law for securing to the\r\n     citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of\r\n     citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I suppose the proper disposition is to have it printed.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--There is nothing to print.\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--And refer it to the Committee for the District of\r\nColumbia. I think that is about right.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I move that it be referred to a select committee,\r\nwith instructions to report to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--We ought certainly to have it printed.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--It can be printed in the mean time.\r\n\r\nMr. FESSENDEN:--We should have time to look at it.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--It is moved that the communication be printed and\r\nreferred to a select committee, with instructions to report to-morrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I would be glad to make a suggestion to the Senator from\r\nKentucky, that he name in addition an hour to-morrow at which the\r\nconsideration of the report shall be in order, or else a single\r\nobjection will throw it over to the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Well, to-morrow at twelve o'clock, I would say.\r\n[\"One.\"] I move one o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--With instructions to the committee to report to-morrow\r\nmorning, and that the report be the special order at one o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--Does the Senator indicate the number of the\r\ncommittee?\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--Seventeen.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--Five is enough.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--A committee of five; no more.\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--I would suggest to gentlemen not only that it be made\r\nthe order of the day for twelve o'clock to-morrow, but that it be\r\nadopted by three-fourths of the States the next day. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--It is moved and seconded that the communication\r\nbe printed and referred to a select committee of five members, to\r\nreport to-morrow at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--I ask for a division of the question.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--The first question will be on printing.\r\n\r\nThe motion to print was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--The next question is that the communication be\r\nreferred to a select committee of five, with instructions to report\r\nto-morrow at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--I ask for a division of that.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--How would it be divided?\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--The motion to refer to a select committee is one\r\nproposition, and the instructions are another.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--That is the form in which the Senator wants it\r\ndivided?\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--As the Chair states the proposition, it does not reach\r\nthe object which the Senator from Kentucky had in view. The\r\ninstructions should be that the committee report to-morrow morning,\r\nand that the report shall be the special order at one o'clock. Unless\r\nthat is done, one objection will put it over.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--The Senator from New Hampshire asks for a\r\ndivision of the question, and it is susceptible of division. The first\r\nquestion is on referring the communication to a special committee of\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--The next branch of the proposition is that that\r\ncommittee be instructed to report to-morrow morning, and that their\r\nreport be made the special order for to-morrow at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--On that, I should like to have the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nThe VICE-PRESIDENT:--The question is upon directing the committee to\r\nreport to-morrow morning, and that the report be made the special\r\norder for to-morrow at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proceeded to call the roll.\r\n\r\nMr. CLINGMAN:--Though I am utterly opposed to the proposition, I am\r\nwilling to give it the direction its friends desire, and I vote \"yea.\"\r\n\r\nMr. LATHAM:--I desire to change my vote. I have no confidence in this\r\nthing, and I fear it will be an unnecessary consumption of time; but I\r\nyield to the judgment of my political associates and I vote \"yea.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was announced--yeas 26, nays 21; as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Messrs. Anthony, Baker, Bayard, Bigler, Bragg,\r\n     Bright, Clingman, Crittenden, Dixon, Douglas, Fitch, Foster,\r\n     Gwin, Hunter, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane, Latham,\r\n     Mason, Nicholson, Pearce, Polk, Powell, Rice, Sebastian, and\r\n     Thomson--26.\r\n\r\n     NAYS.--Messrs. Bingham, Chandler, Clark, Collamer,\r\n     Doolittle, Durkee, Fessenden, Foot, Green, Grimes, Hale,\r\n     Harlan, King, Morrill, Seward, Simmons, Sumner, Ten Eyck,\r\n     Trumbull, Wade, and Wilson--21.\r\n\r\nSo the motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I move that the committee be appointed by the Chair.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to; and Mr. CRITTENDEN, Mr. BIGLER, Mr. THOMSON,\r\nMr. SEWARD, and Mr. TRUMBULL, were appointed the committee.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February the committee so appointed, presented to the\r\nSenate the following report, and the following action was taken\r\nthereon:\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--The select committee, to whom was referred the\r\ncommunication received yesterday from the Convention assembled in this\r\nplace, commonly called the Peace Convention, with instructions to\r\nreport by twelve o'clock to-day, have had the subject under\r\nconsideration, and have directed me to make the following report--\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--I object to its consideration to-day.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITCH in the chair):--Objection being made,\r\nit cannot be considered until one o'clock, but it will be read.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read the joint resolution reported by Mr. CRITTENDEN (S.\r\nNo. 70), proposing certain amendments to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, as follows:\r\n\r\n     JOINT RESOLUTION _proposing certain amendments to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States._\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS Commissioners, appointed on the invitation of the\r\n     State of Virginia, by the following States, respectively:\r\n     Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\n     Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\n     Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\n     Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and\r\n     Kansas, have met in Convention at the City of Washington,\r\n     for the purpose of considering the distracted and perilous\r\n     condition of the country, and proposing measures for the\r\n     preservation of the peace, the safety of the people, and the\r\n     security of the Union, and having performed that duty, and\r\n     communicated to Congress the result of their deliberations,\r\n     with a request and recommendation on the part and in the\r\n     name of said States, that the following be proposed to the\r\n     several States as amendments to the Constitution of the\r\n     United States, according to the fifth article of said\r\n     instrument, namely: [See article preceding.]\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--Mr. President--\r\n\r\nMr. GWIN:--I think I am on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I desire to speak a word from the committee touching the\r\npresent report.\r\n\r\nMr. GWIN:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--I object to its present consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I am not proposing to consider it.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--The Senator from New Hampshire has no right to make the\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I am not proposing to consider it at the present moment;\r\nbut I am desirous of making an explanation from the committee,\r\ntouching the report made by the Senator from Kentucky. The honorable\r\nSenator from Illinois [Mr. TRUMBULL], and myself, constituted a\r\nminority of the committee. We dissent from the report, and we proposed\r\nin committee to submit a substitute. The majority held that, for some\r\nreason, sufficient in their estimation, we were not entitled to submit\r\na minority report. I therefore ask leave of the Senate to introduce a\r\njoint resolution in my own name, and in which the honorable Senator\r\nfrom Illinois authorized me to say that he concurs with me, and which\r\nI ask unanimous consent to have read and printed; and it will be the\r\nsubject of consideration at such time hereafter as the Senate shall\r\nchoose to hear it, either in connection with the other or not.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Is it in the form of a report?\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--No; it is not insisted on in that form; it is submitted\r\non my own behalf. I desire that it may be read for information and\r\nprinted, subject to the future action of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of Mr. SEWARD was read, as follows:\r\n\r\n     A joint resolution concerning a National Convention to\r\n     propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Legislatures of the States of Kentucky, New\r\n     Jersey, and Illinois, have applied to Congress to call a\r\n     Convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of\r\n     the United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Be it Resolved, &c._, That the Legislatures of the other\r\n     States be invited to take the subject into consideration,\r\n     and to express their will on that subject to Congress, in\r\n     pursuance of the fifth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I desire to make--\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Senator from California was on the floor.\r\nNo action is now requested on the paper just offered, only a motion to\r\nprint. Shall the paper be printed?\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--Was it read for information?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--For information only.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I move that it be printed.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair hears no objection.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I desire to make a remark in reference to the question of\r\norder made by the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator objects to\r\nthe consideration of the report to-day. Yesterday, when the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky made the motion, I insisted on further moving that the\r\nreport of the committee should be the special order at one o'clock\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--That is the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--That instruction was offered, and therefore the Senator's\r\nobjection will not apply.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--Therefore it will.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I insist on the motion to print.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Senator from California is on the floor.\r\nThe Senator from New Hampshire having objected to the present\r\nconsideration of the resolution reported by the Senator from Kentucky,\r\nfor the time being it cannot be considered.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--Will the Senator from California allow the question to be\r\nput on my motion to print?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:-The Chair heard no objection to that; and it\r\nwas ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. DOOLITTLE:--The Senator from California will allow me to say a\r\nsingle word. I observe that, in this report, the State of Wisconsin is\r\nmentioned as having sent delegates to this Convention, commonly\r\ndenominated the Peace Convention. That is a mistake. I desire, also,\r\nto give notice that when this subject shall come up for consideration,\r\nI shall offer as an amendment to the first section of article\r\nthirteen, as proposed, the following proviso:\r\n\r\n     _Provided, however_ (and this section shall take effect upon\r\n     the express condition), That no State, or any part thereof,\r\n     heretofore admitted, or hereafter to be admitted, into the\r\n     Union, shall have power to withdraw from the jurisdiction of\r\n     the United States; and that this Constitution, and all laws\r\n     passed in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the\r\n     land therein, any thing contained in any constitution, act,\r\n     or ordinance of any State Legislature or Convention to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe section will then read as follows:\r\n\r\n     SEC. 1. In all the present territory of the United States\r\n     north of the parallel of 36° 30´ of north latitude,\r\n     involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime, is\r\n     prohibited. In all the present territory south of that line,\r\n     the _status_ of persons held to involuntary service or\r\n     labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any\r\n     law be passed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to\r\n     hinder or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the\r\n     States of the Union to said territory, nor to impair the\r\n     rights arising from the said relation; but the same shall be\r\n     subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal courts,\r\n     according to the course of the common law. When any\r\n     Territory north or south of said line, within such boundary\r\n     as Congress may prescribe, shall contain a population equal\r\n     to that required for a member of Congress, it shall, if its\r\n     form of government be republican, be admitted into the Union\r\n     on an equal footing with the original States, with or\r\n     without involuntary servitude, as the Constitution of such\r\n     State may provide; _Provided, however_ (and this section\r\n     shall take effect upon the express condition), That no\r\n     State, nor any part thereof, heretofore admitted, or\r\n     hereafter to be admitted into the Union, shall have power\r\n     to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United States; and\r\n     that the Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance\r\n     thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land therein, any\r\n     thing contained in any constitution, act, or ordinance, of\r\n     any State Legislature or Convention to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nAnd I desire that that amendment, which I now send to the Chair, may\r\nbe printed.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Is there any objection to printing the paper\r\nwhich the Senator has just read? The Chair hears no objection.\r\n\r\nThe same day the Report of the Peace Conference was called up for\r\nconsideration, when Senator HALE objected to the consideration of the\r\nreport. Considerable discussion then ensued, in which Messrs. HALE,\r\nBIGLER, TRUMBULL, CRITTENDEN, and DIXON participated. This discussion\r\nrelated merely to the question, whether under the rules of the Senate\r\nthe Report of the Peace Conference could at this time be taken up. The\r\nmerits of the report were not considered, and for that reason it is\r\nnot deemed necessary to report the proceedings of the Senate in this\r\nrespect. The joint rules of the two Houses were suspended in order\r\nthat another subject might be taken up, and no decision was had upon\r\nthe question, whether the Report of the Peace Conference at this time\r\nshould be considered.\r\n\r\nThe allotted time having been consumed in this discussion, the Senate\r\nproceeded to the consideration and disposal of several orders of the\r\nday. On the first of March it resumed action on the Report of the\r\nPeace Conference.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITCH):--It is the duty of the Chair to\r\nannounce the special order of the day, being the joint resolution (S.\r\nNo. 70) proposing certain amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I ask that the resolutions from the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in regard to amendments of the Constitution, be laid\r\nbefore the Senate, in order that they may be considered at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair will lay before the Senate a joint\r\nresolution from the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution (H.R. No. 80) to amend the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, was read the first time by its title.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I ask that that be made the special order at the same\r\ntime, in connection with the joint resolution reported by the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I have looked at that joint resolution, and it certainly\r\nought to be committed to a committee to correct its English. It is\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--My object is merely to have it considered at the same\r\ntime with the other.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The joint resolution will have its second\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution (H.R. No. 80) was read a second time by its\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--It is now the subject of any motion that may\r\nbe made in regard to it.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I move that it be made the special order in connection\r\nwith the joint resolution reported by the Senator from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK:--How does that happen to be in order here when there is a\r\nspecial order called up?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--It is not in order to consider it, except by\r\nunanimous consent.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK, Mr. BINGHAM, and Mr. SUMNER:--I object.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The special order is before the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I ask that the other resolutions which have come from\r\nthe House of Representatives, be read. There are two of them, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nThe House joint resolutions (No. 64) declaratory of the opinion of\r\nCongress in regard to certain, questions now agitating the country,\r\nand of measures calculated to reconcile existing differences, were\r\nread the first time by the title.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The second reading--\r\n\r\nMr. CHANDLER and others:--I object.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Is objection made?\r\n\r\nMr. CHANDLER:--I withdraw my objection.\r\n\r\nMr. SUMNER:--I object.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Objection being made, it cannot be read the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nMr. SIMMONS:--It passed the other House unanimously. There can be no\r\nobjection, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK:--We have another subject up.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The special order is before the Senate. The\r\nquestion is on the second reading.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution (S. No. 70) proposing certain amendments to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, was read the second time, and\r\nconsidered as in Committee of the Whole.\r\n\r\nMr. PUGH:--Let the resolution be read, not the proposition itself, but\r\nthe formal part, the introduction.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Is that open to amendment now?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--It is in Committee of the Whole, and open to\r\namendment. The reading of the formal part of the joint resolution is\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read it.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--I offer the following as a substitute:\r\n\r\n     Strike out all after the word \"whereas,\" in the preamble, to\r\n     the end of the resolution, and insert:\r\n\r\n     The Legislatures of the States of Kentucky, New Jersey, and\r\n     Illinois, have applied to Congress to call a Convention for\r\n     proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States; Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     the Legislatures of the other States be invited to take the\r\n     subject of such a Convention into consideration, and to\r\n     express their will on that subject to Congress, in pursuance\r\n     of the fifth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair understands that a proviso was\r\noffered to the matter that the Senator from New York proposes to\r\nstrike out. The vote will first be taken on the proviso offered by the\r\nSenator from Wisconsin [Mr. DOOLITTLE], to insert at the end of\r\nsection one of article thirteen:\r\n\r\n     _Provided, however_ (and this section shall take effect upon\r\n     the express condition), That no State, nor any part thereof,\r\n     heretofore admitted, or hereafter to be admitted into the\r\n     Union, shall have power to withdraw from the jurisdiction of\r\n     the United States; and that this Constitution, and all laws\r\n     passed in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the\r\n     land, any thing contained in any constitution, act, or\r\n     ordinance of any State Legislature or Convention to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I believe that the amendment of the Senator from\r\nWisconsin is not pending.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Senator from Wisconsin proposes that as a\r\nproviso to the matter which the Senator from New York moves to strike\r\nout; and the question must first be taken on that.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I did not know that that was before the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--He only gave notice of it.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I thought the Senator from Wisconsin only gave notice\r\nthat he would offer it.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair may have misunderstood the Senator's\r\nmotion at the time. He called for the printing of it; but if that is\r\nthe understanding of the Senate--\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--What does the record say?\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Chair understands that the record presents\r\nit as \"intended to be offered.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--Then the question is on the substitute. I ask that the\r\nquestion be taken.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I have an amendment to submit. I propose to amend the\r\nfirst section of the proposition before us, by inserting in lieu of it\r\nthe first article of what are called the CRITTENDEN resolutions. I\r\nmove to strike out the first article of the peace propositions, and to\r\ninsert:\r\n\r\n     That in all the territory of the United States now held, or\r\n     hereafter acquired, situate north of latitude 36° 30´,\r\n     slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\n     crime, is prohibited while such territory shall remain under\r\n     territorial government. In all the territory south of said\r\n     line of latitude, slavery of the African race is hereby\r\n     recognized as existing, and shall not be interfered with by\r\n     Congress; but shall be protected as property by all the\r\n     departments of the territorial government during its\r\n     continuance; and when any Territory, north or south of said\r\n     line, within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe,\r\n     shall contain the population requisite for a member of\r\n     Congress, according to the then Federal ratio of\r\n     representation of the people of the United States, it shall,\r\n     if its form of government be republican, be admitted into\r\n     the Union on an equal footing with the original States, with\r\n     or without slavery, as the constitution of such new State\r\n     may provide.\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--I rise to a question of order. It will be observed that\r\nthis paper is before us under a recital that, whereas these\r\npropositions of amendment have been presented by the Commissioners, as\r\nthey are called, from the several States--naming them--who have asked\r\nCongress to submit them, therefore we propose to submit them to the\r\nStates. The whole proceeding is based and predicated on this recital.\r\nI say that it cannot be amended. If it were amended, it would cease to\r\nbe the application of that body which the recital States. I therefore\r\nobject to any amendments, except a substitute; perhaps a substitute\r\nmay be offered striking out the recital and all; but an amendment to\r\nit is out of order, in my view.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--In regard to the question of order, I understand that the\r\nrecital is the recital of the committee, and that the question before\r\nus is on these propositions for amending the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, which are to be treated as a bill. If so, each section\r\nis subject to amendment as a bill would be subject to amendment. It\r\nwas my purpose to offer the entire series of what are called the\r\nCRITTENDEN resolutions, as an amendment to these, and I still intend\r\nto offer them, section by section; but I was prevented from offering\r\nthem in that form, because the Senator from New York got the floor\r\nfirst, and offered his proposition as a substitute. I therefore could\r\nnot raise the question which I desired to raise, except by offering\r\nthe amendments, section by section, in order to perfect the original\r\nproposition. I submit that it is in order.\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--I submit, still, my question of order, suggesting to\r\ngentlemen that if we make any amendment, we must strike out the\r\nrecital.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I do not see that any ordinary question of order can be\r\nraised in this case; but I do think there is a consideration much more\r\ngrave, and that is the question whether we will treat the series of\r\nresolutions presented here by this Peace Congress as a proposition\r\nwhich we ought either to accept or reject. I was one of those in the\r\nselect committee who took that position. It was manifestly intended\r\nthat we should accept the entire programme, or reject it. Therefore I\r\nwas unwilling; and we decided to consider no question of amendment--\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--That is not a question of order, but of propriety. It\r\nwould be an argument against any amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I have said it was no ordinary question of rules; but\r\nthat there was a far graver question of propriety. I agree with the\r\nSenator in that view; and I rose for the purpose of alluding to the\r\nview taken of this subject by the select committee. The Senator from\r\nNew York desired the leave of the committee to report his proposition\r\nas a substitute; but the majority of the committee held that the\r\nresolutions had not been committed to us for the purpose of\r\nconsidering them and changing them, or substituting something else,\r\nbut simply to attach to them the formal resolution to present them as\r\namendments to the Constitution for the ratification of the States. For\r\nthat reason we proposed no amendment; and the Senator from New York\r\nyesterday offered his substitute on his own responsibility, because,\r\nas I understood him, of the view taken by the committee. Now, sir, I\r\nstill entertain the view that, while the Senate have a clear right\r\nunquestionably to change these resolutions, and to change the\r\nresolution of submission to make it conform to any thing we may do, we\r\nought to consider these resolutions sent here by this Peace Conference\r\nas a whole, and accept them or reject them; but there can be no\r\nquestion of ordinary rule raised as to the right to offer an\r\namendment; there is a greater, a graver question of propriety as to\r\nhow they shall be treated.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--It is not merely a question of form or order, but the\r\nproposition of the Senator from Virginia would change the whole\r\ncharacter of the transaction. This joint resolution is one single,\r\ncomplete proposition. It is one act. It begins with a declaration by\r\nCongress, that \"whereas Commissioners, appointed on the invitation of\r\nthe State of Virginia,\" have performed a certain duty confided to\r\nthem, \"and communicated to Congress the result of their deliberations,\r\nwith a request and recommendation on the part and in the name of said\r\nStates\"--of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, and the rest of the States represented in the Convention--\"the\r\nfollowing\"--nothing different, nothing originating in Congress,\r\nnothing originating anywhere else, but--\"the following be proposed to\r\nthe several States as amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, according to the fifth article of said instrument.\" Now, if we\r\nshould adopt this whole transaction, we should simply do this: we\r\nshould submit these amendments to the people of the United States for\r\ntheir acceptance, for the reason that the Peace Convention, as it is\r\ncalled, has considered upon the subject, and thought it grave enough\r\nto solicit us to invest it with the legislative or congressional\r\nsanction, and so submit it to the Legislatures and conventions of the\r\nStates; but whenever you have made a single alteration in it, such as\r\nis proposed now by the Senator from Virginia, it is not, then, the\r\nproposition of the States \"of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts,\" or any other States; but it is a recommendation of the\r\nCongress of the United States. The whole character is changed. The\r\nConvention is swept out of existence in the history of Congress. The\r\nresolutions then adopted become the deliberate conviction of the\r\nmajority of the Congress of the United States, who substitute their\r\nown judgment, and their own wisdom, and their own will, for the\r\nwishes, the opinions, respectfully submitted to them by the\r\nrepresentatives of those States, and take the responsibility of saying\r\nthat this is what the Peace Convention should have submitted, instead\r\nof the proposition which they have sent here.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I wish to make a suggestion in regard to the real\r\nposition of this question, as it now appears before us. The arguments\r\nthat have been urged by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator\r\nfrom New York might very well be brought up against the propriety of\r\nadopting the amendment; but, so far as the question itself stands, it\r\nis only brought before us by a report of our committee. The Peace\r\nConference had no power to present questions or make communications to\r\nus; but they having made a communication, and we, having respect for\r\nthat body, agreed to take it up, and we referred their proposition to\r\na committee. The only authority which we have now for considering it\r\nin the Senate, is on the recommendation of our committee. This\r\nproposition stands here as a recommendation of that committee to alter\r\nthe Constitution, as proposed by this Conference. It being their\r\nrecommendation in regard to the alteration of the Constitution, under\r\nour rules it stands like a bill; and I have a right to move to amend\r\nit, section by section; and in doing so, I should be pursuing the\r\nmethod taken by the Peace Conference, as I understand, for I am told\r\nthey never took a vote on it as a whole, but voted on it proposition\r\nby proposition; and in fact, the majority who passed the propositions\r\nwere composed of different States, and they never did take a vote on\r\nthe articles as a whole.\r\n\r\nNow, I am proposing to amend this as it comes up, proposition by\r\nproposition; and if it would be in order for me to make such a motion,\r\nsupposing that this proposition had originated with a committee of\r\nthis body, who had made a report proposing such amendments to the\r\nConstitution, I should have a right to make it now, for it is only in\r\nthat way that it appears legally before us. I say, then, so far as the\r\nquestion of order is concerned, it seems to me that I have clearly a\r\nright to do it. I would be willing, in order to get rid of the\r\nquestion of order, to move to strike out the preamble too; but in my\r\nopinion it stands before us as a bill would stand. I may amend the\r\nparticular sections. I am not proposing by this amendment to perfect\r\nthe whole proposition, but a part of it; and if I should succeed in\r\nthat, I can then go back, and move to amend the preamble.\r\n\r\nSo far as the question of order is concerned, I cannot see how it is\r\nthat I am out of order. There may be a question of propriety. Those\r\nwho believe that this proposition is one that ought to be accepted as\r\na whole, and ought to be accepted because it comes from this body,\r\neminently respectable, as we all acknowledge it to be, may say that we\r\nought not to amend it; not that we have not the power, but that we\r\nought not to amend it. Those of us, however, who think as I do, that\r\nit is a proposition not to be accepted; that it is a proposition\r\nhighly dangerous, and one which will give rise to great difficulties,\r\non the other hand, may think it eminently proper to amend it. I,\r\nthinking in that way, avail myself of what I suppose my parliamentary\r\nright, to offer an amendment; and it is upon that question of\r\nparliamentary right alone, as I understand, that the Chair is to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--Mr. President, it seems to me very clear that, as a\r\nquestion of order, this proposition does not stand in any respect\r\ndifferent from any other. Suppose an individual Senator had thought\r\nproper to propose amendments to the Constitution; that they had been\r\nreferred to a committee; and the committee had approved them: what\r\nwould it have done? Precisely what this committee has done. It would\r\nhave reported back the proposition, with a resolution in conformity\r\nwith that clause of the Constitution which points out the mode of its\r\namendment. The fact that this proposition was adopted by gentlemen\r\nfrom various States does not alter it at all. It comes here as a mere\r\npetition. However respectable and dignified the Convention may have\r\nbeen which arrived at these conclusions; however much weight their\r\nconclusions may be entitled to in the country, they come here simply\r\nas petitioners--in that light, and none other--asking Congress to\r\nsubmit certain resolutions to the States of the Union to be adopted or\r\nnot as portions of the fundamental law, and, unquestionably, any\r\nSenator has a right to propose an amendment in the same way as if they\r\nwere introduced by an individual Senator. Can it be possible that if I\r\ndraw up a series of propositions as amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and a select committee thinks proper to recommend\r\nthem to this body, the hands of the body are tied up, and it must take\r\nthem, word for word, and letter for letter, as I have drawn them? The\r\nquestion is, whether it is proper to do this; whether the respect due\r\nthe Peace Convention should not deter gentlemen from offering\r\namendments, is a question we are not discussing. The point is one of\r\norder; and as a question of order, I was astonished when the Senator\r\nfrom Pennsylvania first suggested it.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I suggested no question of order.\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--I did understand the Senator from Pennsylvania to say,\r\nthat that was the view he took in committee in response to what was\r\nsaid by the Senator from Vermont, and it was to that I alluded when I\r\nsaid I was astonished at the ground he took, that the committee could\r\nnot amend these propositions, or that any other person could not move\r\nto amend them.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--The Senator from Vermont made a distinct point of order;\r\nbut I did not sustain the Senator's views on the point of order. On\r\nthe other hand, so far from that, I stated distinctly, that there\r\ncould be no ordinary question of order under the rule; but a question\r\nof propriety, a question as to the consideration that was to be\r\nattached to this proposition of the Peace Convention; that the select\r\ncommittee, or a majority, at least, were under the impression that it\r\nwas expected we would treat it as a whole, and accept it or reject it.\r\nThat is what I said. I have no doubt whatever of the right of a\r\nSenator on this floor to move to amend this resolution. But, sir, I\r\ncannot agree with the Senator from Illinois by any means, that this\r\nproposition should be treated as the mere report of a committee or the\r\nproposition of an individual Senator. Who supposes that twenty States\r\nwould have sent commissioners here to consider this great question and\r\nsuggest to Congress--\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--The Senator from Pennsylvania, I see, is\r\nmisunderstanding me. I said, as a question of order, it was to be\r\ntreated the same as if offered by an individual Senator; that however\r\nmuch respect we might have for it, as coming from the source it did,\r\nyet, as a question of order, there was no difference in the rules.\r\n\r\nMr. BIGLER:--I did not understand the Senator as placing entire stress\r\non the question of order. I have been endeavoring to take this\r\nquestion away from the rules, to set it above the rules, and I say\r\nthat we ought to consider it without reference to the rules. If it be\r\nthat this programme is not acceptable to the Senate, let it be\r\nrejected. What I supposed was intended from the beginning was, that\r\nwhatever they sent here was to be considered as an entirety--accepted\r\nor rejected. I was about to remark, who supposes that twenty States\r\nwould have sent commissioners to prepare a programme of peace for the\r\nconsideration of Congress, if they had supposed that immediately the\r\npeculiar views of each member of Congress would be set up in\r\nopposition to them?\r\n\r\nMr. President, a single remark in relation to what fell from the\r\nSenator from New York, and I shall have done. The Senator from New\r\nYork alludes to the terms of the preamble, that, for the reason that\r\nthese commissioners agreed, therefore these propositions are submitted\r\nas amendments to the Constitution. I do not wish to be understood as\r\nregarding it in that light. I do not think it is the right of Congress\r\nto submit propositions of amendment of the Constitution because they\r\ncome from any source. The spirit of the Constitution is, that Congress\r\nwill submit amendments to the Constitution; because Congress approves\r\nthose amendments, and it would be a reason why I should vote for or\r\nagainst them, whether I approved them or not. If, as a whole, I could\r\nvote for them, I would vote for them; if, as a whole, I could not, I\r\nwould vote against them. That does not affect the question whether,\r\nunder all the circumstances, and solemn surroundings, the labor which\r\nhas been bestowed, and the character of the men that have presented\r\nthis paper, we should consider it as an entirety, or attempt to cut it\r\nup by piecemeal, by which neither they, nor the public, will ever\r\nascertain what the judgment of Congress was on the results of their\r\nlabor. That is what I say.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWARD:--The honorable Senator may very naturally and very\r\nproperly take the ground that he would not vote, and that Congress\r\nought not to vote, for submitting this proposition to the people, for\r\nthe reason assigned in the paper before us. I have not any disposition\r\nto quarrel with him about it. I might take the same view, and say\r\nthat I would not submit to the people a proposition which was futile,\r\nwhich was frivolous. That is not what I was speaking to. What I was\r\nspeaking to was, the character of this proposition; and this is a\r\nproposition just to this effect, logically and technically expressed:\r\nthat whereas these commissioners appointed by the States have met,\r\nconsulted, considered, and adopted that resolution, therefore, for\r\nthat reason, independent of every thing else, Congress submits it to\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nMr. PUGH:--I want to make an appeal to the friends of some proposition\r\nof peace. This is the last day of the session but one, and we have not\r\nmade the progress of one line. We have gone into an eternal discussion\r\nabout questions of order, and that, too, in defiance of the rule of\r\nthe Senate. I insist that the question shall be decided without\r\nfurther debate.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITCH):--It is not for the Chair to decide\r\nany question of propriety, except as an individual Senator. As\r\nPresiding Officer, he does not deem the question of order, made by the\r\nSenator from Vermont, to be well taken. The joint resolution differs\r\nin no respect from other resolutions, and is open to amendment, and is\r\nbefore the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, for that purpose. The\r\nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment which has been offered by the\r\nSenator from Virginia.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Mr. President, I have offered this amendment, as the\r\nfirst of a series which I shall offer, for the purpose of carrying out\r\nthe will of my State, as it has been expressed through its\r\nLegislature; and I might say there are other Senators similarly\r\nsituated, for there are other States which have declared a disposition\r\nto settle upon the basis of what are called the CRITTENDEN\r\nresolutions. That is the first reason which prompts me; and to me it\r\nis imperative, because the Legislature of the State which I have the\r\nhonor in part to represent, has declared that this is the basis upon\r\nwhich it would settle, and intimated that it would not take less than\r\nthey propose by way of security for the South. I have also another\r\nreason. I have examined this proposition of the Peace Conference--\r\n\r\nMr. WADE:--Will the Senator let us hear it read? We do not understand\r\nwhat his proposition is.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--My proposition is the first article from the CRITTENDEN\r\namendments, in regard to the territorial adjustment.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE:--We understand that.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--After as careful an examination as I have been able to\r\ngive this proposition from the Peace Conference since it was printed,\r\nthat is to say, within the last day or two, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that it would not only make a great many more difficulties\r\nthan it would remove, if it should be adopted as an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, but that it would place the South--the slaveholding\r\nStates--in a far worse position than they now occupy under the present\r\nConstitution, with the Dred Scott decision as its exposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK:--Will the Senator from Virginia allow me to make a\r\nsuggestion?\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK:--I understand him to say he proposes to offer the several\r\npropositions of the CRITTENDEN amendment one after the other.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CLARK:--Then I suggest, as that is the intention of the Senator,\r\nthat unanimous consent be given to move them as one amendment, so that\r\nwe may have them all up for discussion, if any one chooses to discuss\r\nthem, at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I have no objection to that, if it is the general wish. I\r\nwas saying, Mr. President, when I was interrupted, that after as\r\ncareful an examination as I was able to give this peace proposition,\r\nsince it was printed, I came to the conclusion that it would put the\r\nsouthern States in a far worse position than they now occupy under the\r\npresent Constitution, and with the Dred Scott decision. Under that\r\nConstitution, and with the Dred Scott decision, they had a right, as\r\nthe court has decided, to carry their slaves into any Territory of the\r\nUnited States. That is a right which has been adjudicated to them by a\r\nsolemn decision of the Supreme Court; and it is to be remembered that\r\nthis right has not only been accorded to them by the decision of the\r\ncourt, but by the action of the several branches of the Federal\r\nGovernment. That is their present state of things under the present\r\nConstitution of the United States with regard to the territorial\r\nquestion. In what position, then, does this proposed territorial\r\nadjustment place them? Why, sir, it excludes them; it puts the WILMOT\r\nproviso on all territory north of 36° 30´; and south of 36° 30´ it\r\ngives them the privilege of another lawsuit, in order to try their\r\nright and title to enter the territory with their slaves. What are the\r\nwords of this proposed amendment of the Constitution?\r\n\r\n     \"In all the present territory south of that line, the\r\n     _status_ of persons hold to involuntary service or labor, as\r\n     it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be\r\n     passed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to hinder\r\n     or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the States\r\n     of this Union to said territory, nor to impair the rights\r\n     arising from said relation; but the same shall be subject\r\n     to judicial cognizance in the Federal courts, according to\r\n     the course of the common law.\"\r\n\r\n\"In all the present territory south of that line, the _status_ of\r\npersons held to involuntary servitude or labor, as it now exists,\r\nshall not be changed.\" What is the meaning of that word \"_status_\"?\r\nWhat is the _status_? The word _status_ may be applied to different\r\nthings; there may be a local _status_ or a political _status_. In some\r\ncountries a slave may hold property, and, in a certain form, sue; in\r\nothers, he cannot. Or it may be the social and legal relation, that of\r\nthe slave to his master, which constitutes the _status_ that is\r\nreferred to; and I presume it is that which it is declared shall not\r\nbe changed. But, sir, shall not be changed by whom? By Congress? It\r\ndoes not say so. By the Territorial Legislature? It does not say so in\r\nterms. Does it mean that it shall not be changed by Congress or by the\r\ngovernment of the Territory? Does it mean that it shall not be changed\r\nat all by anybody? Does it mean the master shall not emancipate him if\r\nhe chooses? Is it an absolute prohibition of any change of the\r\n_status_ of the slave, of any sort or description?\r\n\r\nThese are the terms which we are obliged to resort to in order to\r\nescape from the manly declaration of the CRITTENDEN resolution, that\r\nsouth of that line slavery shall be recognized and protected. It was\r\neminently proper, as we excluded them north of it, that our\r\ninstitutions should be recognized and protected south of that line.\r\nThat, sir, was plain English; that everybody could understand; but\r\nhere we are interpolating law Latin into the Constitution; this word\r\n\"_status_\" is introduced; and who is to determine what the _status_\r\nwas? I thought it had been considered a march forward, a step of\r\nprogress, an evidence of improvement in English legislation, when it\r\nabandoned Norman French and law Latin, and resorted to the mother\r\ntongue; and especially it should be so, when we are making\r\nconstitutions for American people of English descent, and who speak\r\nthe English tongue. A constitution is for the millions, and the\r\nmillions should be able to understand it.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, let us proceed a little further. This whole matter\r\nis to be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal courts,\r\naccording to the course of common law. That embraces the right of the\r\nmaster to his slave as a matter of cognizance under the common law\r\nbefore the courts; because what do they mean by the _status_ of all\r\npersons held to involuntary servitude or labor? They mean rightfully\r\nheld. They do not mean if a man is kidnapped and held illegally to\r\ninvoluntary service or labor that he is always to be so held. It means\r\nthat the _status_ of persons who are rightfully and legally held shall\r\nnot be changed; and who is to determine that? The courts are to\r\ndetermine it according to the common law. That is to be determined by\r\njudges who are to be appointed from a party, and by a party who\r\nbelieve that there cannot be property in man; by a party who believe\r\nthat, in the Somerset case, Lord MANSFIELD has laid down the common\r\nlaw properly; by a party who will probably believe that the decision\r\nof the English courts, in regard to the slave ANDERSON, that it was no\r\nmurder for a slave when escaping to kill his master, was a correct\r\nexposition of the common law.\r\n\r\nHow, then, do we stand? Why, sir, in relation to our right to slaves,\r\nwe have to try that right before judges who are thus appointed, and\r\nappointed from a party who we know entertain these opinions. Why, sir,\r\nyou might poll that party through the whole United States, and I would\r\nventure any thing upon the assertion that you cannot get one in a\r\nhundred thousand who would not deny that there could be property in\r\nman, especially under the common law. We thus lose the advantage of\r\nthe Dred Scott decision. According to the Dred Scott decision, we can\r\ncarry them into the territory of the United States and hold them, and\r\nit is decided that there is property in slaves--decided under the\r\nConstitution. The court maintain that the Constitution recognizes it.\r\nIt is upon constitutional ground that we have made our claims, and so\r\nfar, it is upon this that we have fought and won the battle, not upon\r\ncommon law; and now we are to abandon the advantages that we have got\r\nfrom that ground of title under the Dred Scott decision, and go into\r\ncourt and try a case that has been already decided in our favor; and\r\nunder the common law, try it before judges who are to be selected by a\r\nparty entertaining such opinions as I have just described; and I am\r\nsorry to say, without appeal to the Supreme Court; because, in the\r\nterritorial bills which have been lately passed, that right has been\r\ntaken from us. My friend from North Carolina will be kind enough to\r\nread an article in the Chicago platform, showing what is held on that\r\nsubject by those who wield the power of this Government.\r\n\r\nMr. CLINGMAN read, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Eighth. \"That the normal condition of all the territory of\r\n     the United States is that of freedom; that as our republican\r\n     fathers, when they had abolished slavery in all our national\r\n     territory, ordained that 'no person should be deprived of\r\n     life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' it\r\n     becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever such legislation\r\n     is necessary, to maintain this provision of the Constitution\r\n     against all attempts to violate it; and we deny the\r\n     authority of Congress, of a Territorial Legislature, or of\r\n     any individuals, to give legal existence to slavery in any\r\n     Territory of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Thus much, Mr. President, in regard to the _status_; and\r\nit is to be observed that the same word is used in reference to\r\npersons who are now held to involuntary servitude in the Territories\r\nand to those whom we are to have the right to take into the\r\nTerritories from the States recognizing slavery. So that we submit\r\nthis question of our right to slaves, when it reaches the Territories,\r\nto be tried under the common law, by courts appointed by the party\r\nentertaining the opinions I have described, and that without appeal.\r\nThis is in regard to the Territories which we now own. What is the\r\nsettlement provided for in regard to territory hereafter to be\r\nacquired? Here it is, in the third section:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 3. Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment\r\n     thereof, shall be construed to give Congress power to\r\n     regulate, abolish, or control, within any State, the\r\n     relation established or recognized by the laws thereof\r\n     touching persons held to labor or involuntary service\r\n     therein, nor to interfere with or abolish involuntary\r\n     service in the District of Columbia without the consent of\r\n     Maryland, and without the consent of the owners, or making\r\n     the owners who do not consent just compensation; nor the\r\n     power to interfere with or prohibit Representatives and\r\n     others from bringing with them, to the District of Columbia,\r\n     retaining and taking away, persons so held to labor or\r\n     service; nor the power to interfere with or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in places under the exclusive\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States within those States and\r\n     Territories where the same is established or recognized.\r\n\r\nThat is, they shall not prohibit it as to future acquired territory,\r\nwhere it is established or recognized. Will not the inference be\r\nclaimed from such an expression, that where it is not established and\r\nnot recognized, they may prohibit it? Will it not be said that the\r\nexpression of one exception to the power of Congress to prohibit\r\nslavery in the Territories excludes the idea of an exception to that\r\npower when slavery is not recognized in the Territories?\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--If the gentleman will indulge me a moment, I desire to\r\nsay that is a section declaring that Congress shall not abolish\r\nslavery in the dock-yards, &c., in the States where it is recognized.\r\nThere is nothing in it about future acquired territory.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--This third section applies not only to present but to\r\nfuture acquired territory. It is not confined, like the first section,\r\nto the territory at present acquired. It is not confined to dock-yards\r\nand arsenals in the Territories and States. If the Senator will\r\nexamine it, he will find that it is applied to all places where the\r\nUnited States have exclusive jurisdiction. \"Exclusive jurisdiction\" is\r\nthe word. Will it not be claimed that they have exclusive jurisdiction\r\nin the Territories of the United States? Will not those who have the\r\npower to construe, and carry out their construction, so construe it?\r\nWill they not say it is a prohibition to Congress to prohibit slavery\r\nwhere it is recognized in the Territories or States, but not a denial\r\nof the right to prohibit slavery in Territories where it is not\r\nrecognized by law, although that Territory may be vacant and\r\nuninhabited?\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--That clause of the section is, that Congress shall not\r\nhave power--\r\n\r\n     \"To interfere with or abolish involuntary service in places\r\n     under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States within\r\n     those States and Territories where the same is established\r\n     or recognized.\"\r\n\r\nThat, so far as I have read, is confined only to where they have local\r\njurisdiction in the States holding slaves.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I thought so at first myself; but the Senator will find,\r\non a further examination, I think, that he is mistaken. They shall not\r\nprohibit it wherever they have exclusive jurisdiction in places where\r\nslavery \"is established or recognized.\" It is not confined to\r\ndock-yards, forts, and arsenals. Why should it be in the Territories?\r\nThey have exclusive jurisdiction over the whole. There is reason for\r\nconfining it to dock-yards in the States; but there is no reason for\r\nconfining it to dock-yards, &c., in the Territories. But that is not\r\nthe construction which will be given; the construction given to it\r\nwill be, that they shall not prohibit it where they have exclusive\r\njurisdiction, if it is recognized in such places; but if it be not\r\nrecognized in such places, where they have exclusive jurisdiction, I\r\nsay the inference will be drawn, plausibly, if not justly, that they\r\nshall have power to prohibit; and I say if this be so, then it is a\r\npower (so far as Mexican territories are concerned, if there should be\r\nany acquisition there) by which the South will be forever estopped;\r\nbecause there the Mexicans have abolished slavery, and there, under\r\nthis clause giving in that territory exclusive jurisdiction, the party\r\nnow controlling the Government would claim the right to prohibit it.\r\nAnd what a difference between our position then and our position now\r\nunder the decision of the Supreme Court! Under the decision of that\r\ncourt, all the people of all the States have a right to go into the\r\ncommon territory with their institutions. It belongs to all in common,\r\nand Congress cannot prohibit them from taking their property there.\r\n\r\nI say that those who have the power to carry out any construction they\r\nchoose to give, would be interested in putting upon it the\r\nconstruction which I fear; and it would be difficult to raise an\r\nargument which they would deem conclusive against it. But take it the\r\nother way; suppose that the Senator from Vermont is right in his first\r\nsupposition, that it was only meant to be applied to forts, arsenals,\r\nand dock-yards, then I ask what settlement does this proposition give\r\nus in regard to future acquired territories; what earthly settlement\r\nis it? We have all the old difficulties to encounter that we have to\r\nmeet now, every one of them. We not only have all the old difficulties\r\nto encounter, but the slaveholder would have an additional obstacle\r\nwhich this first clause would put in his way. It requires that the\r\nright to slaves in the present territory shall be tried by the common\r\nlaw, and it might be said in court that the inferences drawn\r\nheretofore from those provisions of the Constitution recognizing\r\nslavery were to be overruled by the fact that the people in their\r\nlatest action--by way of constitutional amendment--had introduced\r\nanother rule in order to determine the _status_ of those held to\r\ninvoluntary service or labor, and the consequence of that would be\r\nthat the South never could acquire another foot of territory; that is,\r\nthe few southern States who are left in the Union.\r\n\r\nI am told that here is a provision that you cannot acquire territory\r\nexcept by the assent of a majority of the Senators from both sections.\r\nDoes any man believe that the North, with its eighteen, soon to be\r\ntwenty, or thirty, non-slaveholding States, would allow a majority of\r\nsix, or seven, or eight slave States, that are now attached to them,\r\nto prevent them from acquiring any territory hereafter? Would they\r\nagree to such an amendment, in the first instance; and if they did,\r\nhow long before they would change this restriction in the\r\nConstitution? Indeed, it is hardly to be supposed that they will agree\r\nto it in the first instance, so far as it regards the acquisition of\r\nterritory; but of what avail would it be to the South? There is but\r\none conceivable acquisition--I speak of possible things, and I hope\r\ngentlemen will not understand me as coveting my neighbor's goods, or\r\ndesiring to lay violent hands on the property of any other States or\r\nnations--but, if things should so happen that we could rightfully\r\nacquire Cuba, under my view of the probable construction to be given\r\nto this clause, and because slavery there is recognized, Congress\r\nmight be prevented from prohibiting it; but, everywhere else, the\r\nSouth would be shut out and excluded.\r\n\r\nThen, sir, what would be its position? It would be prevented from\r\nacquiring any territory under this Government as an outlet for its\r\nslaves; and the only chance of securing that necessity of its\r\ncondition would be to quit this Union and join the Southern\r\nConfederacy, which can acquire territory. It would be an inducement to\r\ndisunion so strong as would almost force them to it.\r\n\r\nLet us go a little further. Here is another clause holding out the\r\nsame temptation:\r\n\r\n     \"The foreign slave-trade is hereby forever prohibited, and\r\n     it shall be the _duty_ of Congress to pass laws to prevent\r\n     the importation of slaves, coolies, or persons held to\r\n     service or labor, into the United States and the Territories\r\n     from places beyond the limits thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThis is to be the duty of Congress. As it now stands, it is in the\r\npower of Congress. When it was merely given as a power to Congress,\r\nwas there a failure to execute that power? Do we not know that every\r\nState in the present Confederation has desired to suppress the African\r\nslave-trade? Some do it from sentiment and principle; some from\r\ninterest; but there is a controlling motive with each and all of them.\r\nIt is safe enough to leave it where it stood, giving Congress the\r\npower merely. Here you make it their duty. Suppose this case: the\r\nStates that have left us have set up another Government, another\r\nConfederation; under this clause you forbid us to buy their slaves, to\r\ninterchange and trade in slaves with them: what will be the\r\nconsequence? They will exclude us from selling our slaves in their\r\nterritory, and where then do we stand? If you should think it prudent,\r\nif you should think it politic, you would have no means, under this\r\nproposed amendment, of allowing that to be done between these two\r\ncoterminous countries. Though it would be to the advantage of both\r\nConfederacies that there should be this interchange, you preclude\r\nCongress from allowing it; and then where would that place the border\r\nslave States? They would not be able to sell their slaves in the\r\nStates further South; and if they carried them there, they would have\r\nto emigrate with them. You would thus prevent Congress from adopting a\r\nregulation which would make it possible for them to remain in this\r\nUnion with safety, with advantage, to themselves. Why was this put in?\r\nWhy not have left it where it stood, giving Congress the power, when\r\nwe all know that there is no State in the present Confederation that\r\nwould not exercise that power for the purpose of suppressing the\r\nslave-trade from Africa? This probably would constitute the only\r\nexception. Why shut ourselves out from allowing the exception?\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, my desire is to be brief; I do not want to consume\r\nthe time of the Senate; I am merely endeavoring to state the points of\r\nobjection as briefly as I can. Here is, at the close of it, another\r\nprovision which, it seems to me, contains the seeds of civil war; and\r\nthat is this: \"Congress shall provide by law for securing to the\r\ncitizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States;\" that is to say, Congress shall have power to pass\r\nlaws to force the States to receive those persons whom they have\r\nexcluded from police considerations--considerations of domestic\r\nsafety. Yes, sir, to force the States to receive persons who would be\r\ndangerous to their peace; to force upon them, if you will, abolition\r\nlecturers; to force upon them persons whom they regard as the most\r\ndangerous emissaries that could be sent among them; to enable Congress\r\nto obtrude, in fact, into all the business of the States. That was not\r\nintended when the Constitution was framed, and never ought to have\r\nbeen. The present provision in regard to the rights of citizens in the\r\nseveral States, I regard as in the nature of an inter-treaty\r\nstipulation. It is a duty imposed on each State, for the violation of\r\nwhich there is no remedy; no remedy, unless the State aggrieved may\r\nresort sometimes to retaliation.\r\n\r\nThere are various things of that sort in the Constitution. Duties\r\nimposed upon the States, but without a remedy for the failure to\r\nexecute them. No State shall keep a standing army; but suppose it\r\ndoes: what are you to do? Congress cannot remedy it; and it would not\r\nbe right to give Congress the power to remedy it. You have to trust\r\nsomething to the sense of right and duty of the States themselves; and\r\nso it should be in regard to this matter of citizens. Suppose one\r\nState should say that the citizens of another should not sue in its\r\ncourts; how is Congress to enforce their right? Is Congress to say\r\nthey shall be allowed to sue, and that the Sheriffs and officers of\r\nthe State shall execute the process? Is it proposed to allow Congress,\r\nby law, to interpose in all these delicate matters? Is it not far\r\nbetter to leave it to the sense of justice of the States--to their\r\nsense of duty and of honor? Have we not got along very well while we\r\nleft it there? If there be any instances in which there have been\r\nexceptions, they are instances in which persons have been excluded on\r\naccount of police considerations, deemed to be dangerous to the safety\r\nof the people who excluded them. Is it proposed so to amend the\r\nConstitution as to take from the people of the States this right of\r\nself-defence?\r\n\r\nIf we once introduced this as an amendment to the Constitution, what\r\nwould become of the feeble southern States, six or seven (for Delaware\r\ncan hardly be considered as a slave State), that would be left?\r\nArkansas may conclude to secede when she shall determine finally upon\r\nher position in the Union. What would become of us in the hands of\r\nthis powerful majority, who would pass what laws they pleased in\r\nregard to the introduction of their citizens among us, and the rights\r\nof those citizens to do as they pleased after they got there? Is it\r\nnot obvious that these various changes would lead to endless\r\ndiscontents, to irreparable breaches between these States? Would you\r\nnot certainly drive out the Border States? They would say, \"If we go\r\nsouth, we ally ourselves to a homogeneous people; we shall have none\r\nof these difficulties; we have no reason to fear their citizens; we\r\ncan grant all these privileges without the least difficulty or\r\ndanger; we can send our slaves south from a country where they are not\r\nprofitable, to one where they are; but if we stay here, we are\r\nforbidden to do any of these things; if we stay here, we are prevented\r\nfrom ever obtaining any outlet for our slave property.\" Will you not\r\noffer them the highest inducements, nay, will you not make it almost\r\nnecessary for them to leave you, if you should adopt such a\r\nproposition as this?\r\n\r\nNor is that all, Mr. President. Our present Constitution--for I am\r\ncomparing our position under it with that in which this would place\r\nus--in most of its difficult provisions has been expounded--expounded\r\nby the action of the State Governments, by the action of all the\r\ndepartments of the Federal Government. We have had legal\r\ninterpretations in the decisions of the State and Federal courts. We\r\nhave come almost to a point--indeed, I, who believe that the Dred\r\nScott decision is law, think we have come to a point--where we have a\r\nlegal exposition on the whole of these matters. Are we to be turned\r\naside from that, to wander into a new sea of doubt and difficulty and\r\nambiguity? No candid man can take this up and say it is not full of\r\ndouble constructions, full of ambiguities, giving ground for new\r\nquarrels between the sections, to new constructions of courts, to new\r\nlawsuits.\r\n\r\nMr. COLLAMER:--And to be perpetual.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Yes, sir; and to be made perpetual. We cannot change them\r\nafterwards, if we want to do it. I can conceive nothing that would\r\nendanger what is left of this Union so much as the adoption of this\r\nproposition, although it has been produced by persons so eminent and\r\nso respectable as those who composed the Peace Congress.\r\n\r\nI know that this measure does emanate from a body eminently patriotic\r\nand wise, entitled to the public deference and affection; and for\r\ntheir work I feel all possible respect. Against that work I will\r\npronounce nothing except what the necessities of the occasion may\r\nrequire. But when the peace, the safety, the rights of the State which\r\nI seek to represent--when the peace of the whole country, as it seems\r\nto me, would be so seriously imperilled as it would be if this were\r\nadopted, I feel bound by a sense of what I owe to those who sent me\r\nhere, bound by a sense of what I owe to those who have some respect\r\nfor my opinions, to express them here on this occasion, and to give\r\nbriefly the points and the heads upon which I differ from the\r\nconclusions of that Congress. Indeed, sir, before taking my seat, I\r\nmay suggest a doubt whether I am in truth acting against any thing\r\nwhich they have really done. I was informed by a member of that\r\nCongress that they never did take a vote upon this proposed article,\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nMr. DOOLITTLE:--If the Senator will allow me, I beg leave to state\r\nthat I was informed of the same fact by a distinguished member of the\r\nConvention; and I was further informed that the person who claims to\r\nbe the secretary of the Convention was never elected as such. And\r\nthere is another fact stated in the preamble that I know is not\r\ncorrectly stated: that the State of Wisconsin was in that Convention,\r\nor took any part in it. How many more mistakes there are in the\r\npreamble, I am unable to say.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--I believe it is certain that they never did take a vote\r\non this article as a whole, but upon its separate sections. I think it\r\nequally probable that it could not have passed as a whole. That\r\nopinion was expressed to me by a member. As it did pass, I think there\r\nwere three or four States not voting; and the States not voting were\r\nsupposed to be against it. Under such circumstances, I do not know\r\nthat this is to be taken as an expression of the will of that\r\nCongress. Further: I will say, in regard to myself, that a majority of\r\nthe members from my own State voted against it, and were very decided\r\nin their opposition to it. They believed it was not such a proposition\r\nas the South could safely accept; and that majority, I believe, have\r\nreturned home to express that opinion to the State Convention, and to\r\ngive their reasons for it. Under all these circumstances, I have\r\nthought that I ought to present, as a counter proposition (believing\r\nthat the people whom I represent cannot and ought not to accept\r\nthese), resolutions upon which they have said they were willing to\r\nsettle this controversy. I believe the State of Kentucky has declared\r\nthe same thing. I understand the State of California has done\r\nlikewise. I believe, though I may be mistaken, that Tennessee has said\r\nthe same. The State of North Carolina has made the same declaration\r\nunanimously. To the last, I believe I may add Missouri.\r\n\r\nNow, I am making a proposition to amend, by inserting the resolutions\r\nof the honorable Senator from Kentucky; upon which so many of the\r\nborder slaveholding States have said they would settle the difference.\r\nWhy not send them out to the States and the people? We know that some\r\nof them would settle on that. Why should we send out such a\r\nproposition as this, which there is every reason to believe they will\r\nnot accept, and which will have the effect of dividing the\r\nconservative men of the North? Those northern men who are willing to\r\nsettle on some proposition that would give satisfaction to the Border\r\nStates, would just as soon vote for the CRITTENDEN resolutions as for\r\nthese, and some probably would prefer to do so. They will waste all\r\ntheir strength, and efforts, and energies, in going for a proposition\r\nwhich the South in the end will not accept, or at least which I do not\r\nbelieve they will accept, as there is every reason to suppose they\r\nwill not accept it. Then, when we know there are propositions upon\r\nwhich so many of the Border States have said they would be willing to\r\nsettle existing difficulties, why not submit them? I think, under such\r\ncircumstances, notwithstanding the respect which I feel for the\r\nmembers composing the Peace Congress, my duty to my own State, whose\r\nLegislature has spoken in regard to it, and my sympathy with so many\r\nof the Southern States who have declared the same opinion, should\r\ninduce me to present the proposition which they desire instead of one\r\nto which none of them have as yet given their adhesion, and to which I\r\nhave no idea they will ever agree.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I suppose, Mr. President, not only out of deference\r\nto the Presiding Officer of this body, but because it seems to me to\r\nbe entirely reasonable, that the decision of the Chair on the question\r\nof order which was made as to the admissibility of these amendments,\r\nwas correct. The question which these amendments present, I think, is\r\na question of consistency or inconsistency with the proceeding in\r\nwhich we are engaged, with the resolutions offered by the Peace\r\nConference; and each member, in deciding ultimately upon the question\r\nfor or against the proposed amendment, will consider that question of\r\nconsistency or inconsistency, and regulate his vote accordingly. It is\r\nnot, perhaps, strictly a question of order, to be decided on the\r\nconsistency or inconsistency of amendments. So I take it. I am willing\r\nit should be decided by this body. Now, what is it? The proposed\r\namendment contravenes the whole nature of the transaction, and changes\r\nits character. The representatives of twenty-one or twenty-two\r\nStates--we will not make any question about Kansas; whether it be in\r\nor not, is not material--the representatives and delegates of over\r\ntwenty States of the Union have recommended to us the adoption of\r\ncertain amendments to the Constitution, which they say will arrest the\r\ntroubles of the country and adjust those great differences which now\r\nso much threaten us; and they ask Congress to propose these amendments\r\nto the several States, according to the fifth article of the\r\nConstitution, for their adoption. These amendments have been submitted\r\nto us, and the question is, whether we will submit them to the States\r\nor not? That I take to be the specific and solitary question. This\r\nimposes no obligation on us to sanction these constitutional\r\namendments by proposing them to the people. We can do as we please\r\nupon that point; but what is the question and the only question? It is\r\nnot whether we ourselves will propose amendments to the Constitution,\r\nbut whether we will propose to the people the amendments which this\r\nConvention has proposed to us. Now, that whole character is effaced,\r\nand a new character is given to the transaction, if any one of the\r\namendments proposed by Senators be adopted.\r\n\r\nSuppose these same States, by their Legislatures, had respectively\r\nrecommended to us these particular and specific constitutional\r\namendments, asking us to propose them according to the Constitution:\r\nwould it have been proper for us then to undertake to amend their\r\nresolutions? It would be a different transaction altogether. In the\r\none instance, out of respect to the States, we are proposing their\r\nresolutions; in the other case, we are proposing our own to the\r\nStates. Now, the question here is, whether the resolutions have come\r\nto us with a sufficient sanction to constitute in our minds a reason\r\nfor referring to the States the amendments which the States themselves\r\nhave asked. That is all. It seems to my mind to be a clear question.\r\nThey have asked us, they have requested us, to submit their\r\nresolutions, and not any others, to the States; and the question is,\r\nwill we comply with their request, not whether we will fabricate\r\namendments of our own and refer them to the people. They have asked of\r\nus to submit their proposals; and the question is, whether we will do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis amendment implies, in the first instance, that we will not do\r\nthat, because the moment we adopt the amendment of the Senator from\r\nVirginia, that moment we say in effect, \"We will not propose your\r\nrecommendations to the people; while proposing our own, which we will\r\nsubstitute for yours.\" That is passing by this Convention altogether;\r\nit is negativing the States represented in it.\r\n\r\nIf gentlemen take this view it will be a sufficient reason, I trust,\r\nin itself, for voting against the proposed amendment. These\r\npropositions which the Convention has recommended may be such as we\r\nmay refuse; it is in our power to refuse; but the question is, whether\r\na recommendation, coming so sanctioned to us, is not, in itself, a\r\nsufficient reason why Congress, if disposed to satisfy the people,\r\nshall do the small act of presenting this to the people themselves,\r\nfor their adoption. We may reject it, if we please. The people, when\r\nit is sent to them, will, of course, have the power to reject or adopt\r\nit. The only question now is, whether we will give the States an\r\nopportunity of saying whether this proposition is satisfactory or not.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not wish to occupy time; but I cannot perceive the justice\r\nof the criticisms made upon these resolutions of the Convention. They\r\nseem to me to be perspicuous and intelligible in every part and in\r\nevery sentence. I do not see where the difficulty is to arise.\r\nGentlemen need not tell us here, in respect to these resolutions,\r\nthat a member of the Convention told them thus and so. No matter what\r\na member of the Convention told this one or that one about the votes\r\nthat were given, it is certified to us, in a formal manner, by the\r\nPresident of the Convention--himself a Virginian, and once a President\r\nof the United States--that this is the result of the proceedings of\r\nthe Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--If the Senator will allow me, I will state to him how\r\nthat occurred. It was decided, as it will be seen when we get the\r\nJournal, that, according to some rules of the old Convention, they\r\nshould not vote upon a proposition as a whole, but upon each\r\nparticular provision. That was the rule of the Convention; and\r\ntherefore he certified it as the Convention had instructed. The vote\r\nwas taken only section by section, and the vote was never taken on it\r\nas a whole. There is no inconsistency between what I have said, and\r\nthe certificate of the President of the Convention, because, according\r\nto the rules adopted by them, he had to certify it if it was adopted\r\nby sections, though it was not voted upon as a whole.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I suppose this remark is intended to annul the\r\nConvention, and discredit all their proceedings, though the Senate\r\nhave received the letter of the President and Secretary as authentic\r\nevidence that this does contain the result of the deliberations and\r\nthe proceedings of the body. I take it so, whatever a discontented\r\nmember here and there may have said to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\nHe may have said it all truly, for aught I know, but we must regard\r\nthis as the authentic act of the Convention; otherwise it was nothing;\r\nand it is certified to us by the proper authority as its act, by the\r\nPresident of the Convention, with the request that we shall adopt it.\r\nIt must have had, in some form or shape, the sanction of a majority of\r\nthe Convention, or it could not have been so certified to us. How they\r\nvoted, whether upon parts or the whole, they gave such votes as, they\r\nthought were necessary to ascertain the meaning of the body, and the\r\nexpression of their will and opinion upon the subject. This is what\r\nthey have done.\r\n\r\nI do not stop to inquire whether I like these resolutions better than\r\nI do those proposed by myself, or the amendments now offered by the\r\nSenator from Virginia. We are near the close of our session. I have\r\nlooked upon the proceedings of this great and eminent body of men as\r\nthe best evidence of public opinion outside of this body, and of the\r\nwish and will of the States they represent. I am for peace. I am for\r\ncompromise. I have not an opinion on the subject of what would be best\r\nthat I would not be perfectly willing to sacrifice to obtain any\r\nreasonable measure of pacification that would satisfy the majority. I\r\nwant to save the country and adjust our present difficulties.\r\n[Applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BRIGHT in the chair) called to order.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--That is what I want to do. That is the object I am\r\naiming at. I attach no particular importance--I feel, at least, no\r\nselfish attachment--to any opinions I may have proclaimed on the\r\nsubject heretofore. I proclaimed those opinions because I thought them\r\nright; but I am ready to sacrifice them, any and every one of them, to\r\nany more satisfactory proposition that can be offered. I look upon the\r\nresolutions proposed by this Convention as furnishing us, if not the\r\nlast, the best hope of an adjustment; the best hope for the safety of\r\nthe people and the preservation of the Government. I will not stop to\r\ncavil about the construction of these words; but I see none of the\r\ndifficulties that suggest themselves to the mind of my friend from\r\nVirginia. Look at that third section, which has been the subject of\r\nhis particular criticism. Every part and portion of it is a negation\r\nof power to Congress, and nothing else; and yet he has argued as if it\r\ngave Congress power; as if it conferred more power upon Congress. It\r\nleaves to the States all the rights they now have; all the remedies\r\nwhich they now have; and consists merely in a negation of power to\r\nCongress. How can that take away the rights of the people? How can\r\nthat make our condition worse? I cannot possibly see. It is nothing\r\nbut a negative from beginning to end, and therefore it cannot take\r\naway any thing from the people. It may take from Congress, but cannot\r\ntake away from the States, or the people, any thing. It is a negative\r\nin its form and in its language, from beginning to end, that Congress\r\nshall have no power to do this, that, or the other. If they have that\r\npower under the present Constitution, it is taken away. That is all.\r\nIt takes away no power from the States. It takes away no rights from\r\nindividuals. Its simple office is the negation of power to Congress.\r\nThat is all there is in it; and how, under that, can the gentleman\r\nfind constructions which are to increase our difficulties and diminish\r\nour rights? He says the language will need construction. So does all\r\nlanguage need construction. I do not see that this is particularly so.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, the Senator offers my own proposition as an amendment to\r\nthis. I shall vote against my own proposition here; I shall vote for\r\nthis. [Applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I shall be constrained to require that the galleries be\r\ncleared, if there be any further demonstrations in that quarter.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--I hope the galleries will not be cleared. The admiration\r\nof a noble sentiment is never out of place.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--There is no motion to clear the galleries.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I shall vote for the amendments proposed by the\r\nConvention, and there I shall stand. That is the weapon offered now,\r\nand placed in my hand, by which, as I suppose, the Union of these\r\nStates may be preserved; and I will not, out of any selfish preference\r\nfor my own original opinions on this subject, sacrifice one idea or\r\none particle of that hope. I go for the country; not for this\r\nresolution or that resolution, but any resolution, any proposition,\r\nthat will pacify the country. Therefore, I vote against my own, to\r\ngive place to a proposition which comes from an authority much higher\r\nthan mine--from one hundred and thirty of the most eminent men of this\r\ncountry, out of which number a Senate might be selected that might\r\nwell compare in point of talent and intellect and ability even with\r\nthis honorable body. They have recommended this on arduous, laborious\r\nconsultation with one another; through many difficulties, through many\r\ndiversities of opinion, they have at last arrived at these\r\nconclusions, and sent them to us. Shall any Senator stand upon the\r\nlittle consideration, \"this changes my resolution,\" and shall he\r\ncompare that little atom of his production with the great end and\r\nobject proposed to be attained for a whole nation? No, sir; not a\r\nmoment. I believe our best hope of preservation is in adopting the\r\nresolutions proposed by this Convention, and I adhere to them against\r\nall amendments.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the only material or substantial change in respect to\r\nthe first section of this proposed amendment from my first proposition\r\nis, that it omits all reference to territory hereafter acquired,\r\nlimiting our consideration and our settlement to territory which we\r\nnow have. When I first offered my resolutions, I explained somewhat in\r\nreference to that particular provision which related to future\r\nterritory. I said that I wanted no more territory. Our great trouble\r\nnow is from the magnitude of the territory which we have already\r\nacquired. New Mexico is one of our acquisitions, and what a subject of\r\ndispute it has been! I want no more acquisitions. My country is big\r\nenough, and great enough. I say that further acquisitions are\r\ndangerous. We have found them to be so. Our experience and our reason,\r\nthen, unite in teaching us \"to beware of that sin, ambition.\" National\r\naggrandizement! I want no more. I proposed that, however, as the idea\r\nthen was, that we wanted a settlement that was to last forever; to be\r\neternal; to embrace the present and to embrace the future, with all\r\nits acquisitions, all its changes. Reflection since, and the\r\narguments of others, I will say, have changed my opinion on that\r\npoint. If they had not changed it, however, I should be ready here to\r\nsacrifice it and give it up, if thereby I could obtain the assent of\r\nany respectable portion of my countrymen to the propositions for\r\npeace. If we can settle in respect to what we have, in GOD'S name let\r\nus do it; and if we are to have future acquisitions, let us leave the\r\ntroubles they may bring upon us to a future day. We have enough for\r\nto-day. I do not object, therefore, to the first section of the\r\nproposition of the Convention, that it is confined to the territory\r\nwhich we now have. The adjustment which they have made varies but\r\nlittle in substance in regard to the territorial question, and the\r\nquestion of slavery as connected with it, from my original\r\nproposition. South of the line which we propose to establish, 36° 30´,\r\nyou have no foot of territory left, but what is embraced in the\r\nTerritory of New Mexico. In New Mexico, by law of the Territory--a\r\nconstitutional law, a valid law of the Territory--slavery exists as\r\nfully and completely as the law can establish it, or has established\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, this proposition is, that the _status_ of things shall continue\r\nas it is until that Territory becomes a State; and when it becomes a\r\nState, let it dispose of the question of slavery as it chooses. There\r\nis no ambiguity about this. In substance, though in a different form\r\nof words, the same is expressed in my proposition. The proposition of\r\nthe Convention is the same in substance, only omitting the words--a\r\nvery proper and a very timely omission--supposed to be offensive in\r\ncertain parts of the country, and substituting others that are equally\r\nwell understood in all parts of the country, and which were less\r\noffensive to some.\r\n\r\nSir, now is the time for mediation; now is the time for pacification;\r\nnow is the time to omit every word that can give offence or add to the\r\nirritation under which the country is. I desire, by the most moderate\r\nterms, by the most unoffending language, to reach some mode of\r\nadjustment that can give satisfaction to the whole country and reunite\r\nus all.\r\n\r\nMy friend from Virginia seems to apprehend that under these amendments\r\nwe shall be worse off in respect to territory hereafter acquired. That\r\nis supposed to be sufficiently provided for and secured in the\r\nprovision, that no future acquisition shall be made, by purchase or by\r\ntreaty, except that treaty or that purchase be ratified by a majority\r\nof the Senators from the slaveholding States, as well as a majority of\r\nSenators from the non-slaveholding States. Does not this give the\r\nSouth a safe assurance, an assurance to be relied upon? My friend from\r\nVirginia says, however, do we believe the North, with its superior\r\nnumber, would submit to this provision of the Constitution? Why, sir,\r\nthe Convention have had the caution to make this provision, if I\r\nunderstand them, irrepealable by any future amendment of the\r\nConstitution. There it stands, then, in the most solemn form that men\r\ncan enter into any compact, in the most formal language by any terms\r\nthat Government can establish, that all are bound by that provision of\r\nthe Constitution which requires a majority from each section. When the\r\ngentleman asks whether we can believe for a moment that this law will\r\nbe acquiesced in and adhered to, I say we must to some extent have\r\nconfidence in one another, or all human society must lose its basis,\r\nnot merely of government, but its foundation, and all society would be\r\ntorn up at once by the roots. That confidence is the root of society;\r\nit is the root of all the associations of men in public or private\r\nlife; it is the root and foundation of all government. What more can\r\nyou have, what better security can you have than written, solemn terms\r\nupon any subject which is to regulate government? There is nothing\r\nmore solemn among men, unless you would require angels to come down\r\nand make responses for them. Here you have the very highest security\r\nthat can be given; and when any gentleman shall say these are not to\r\nbe relied upon, he says there is no Government that stands upon any\r\nfoundation that can be relied upon. Such an assertion strikes not at\r\nthis provision; it strikes at the root of all government. What further\r\nsecurity can be had? If our brethren of the other section were willing\r\nto give the highest possible security they could, what can they give\r\nmore? Nothing. This argument, then, can avail nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have gone perhaps a little further than I ought to\r\nhave done. It is not now necessary that I should enter into a\r\nvindication of every provision of these amendments offered by the\r\nConvention. It is sufficient to speak to the amendment which the\r\ngentleman has offered. Excluding territory hereafter to be acquired, I\r\nthink, in substance, we ought to be satisfied with that; I believe\r\nthat will make peace; I believe that will give substantial security to\r\nour rights, and to the rights which the Southern States claim. With\r\nthat I am satisfied. It is enough for the dreadful occasion. It is the\r\ndreadful occasion that I want to get rid of. Rid me of this, rid the\r\nnation of this, and I am willing to take my chance for the future and\r\nmeet the perils of every day that may come. Now is the appointed time\r\nupon which our destiny depends. Now is the emergency and exigency upon\r\nus. Let us provide for them. Save ourselves now, and trust to\r\nposterity and that Providence which has so long and so benignly guided\r\nthis nation, to keep us from the further difficulties which in our\r\nnational career may be in our way.\r\n\r\nI prefer the propositions which the Convention have made to my own\r\npropositions, because I have no hope for my propositions. They have\r\nnot been so fortunate as to receive the favor of my colleagues of the\r\nSenate from the North, the men whose sanction of them was necessary to\r\ngive them effect. I transfer all my hopes of peace to these\r\npropositions and terms proposed by the Convention representing\r\ntwenty-odd of the States of this Union--a large majority of all the\r\nStates. I will not go into particulars about it; but since gentlemen\r\nhave made some allusion to the out-of-door rumors and reports and\r\nsayings in respect to this Convention, I believe that perhaps a\r\nmajority of those who voted for these amendments were men representing\r\nnon-slaveholding States. I do not know the fact, and I will not state\r\nit, but I am under that impression now, and that impression encourages\r\nmy hopes that the Senate, rather than see the country fall into ruin,\r\nfall into dismemberment, limb from limb, and blood flowing at the\r\nplucking out of every limb, will supply the remedy which is proposed.\r\nIt seems to me proper and just. But little is asked, and great is the\r\nreward, and mighty are the consequences that are to flow from it.\r\n\r\nSir, I have occupied more of the time of the Senate on this particular\r\nquestion than I ought to have done.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Mr. President, there is a very grave duty devolving upon\r\nthe Senate on the proposition which is now before us. We are called\r\nupon, pursuant to the Constitution, to propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution. The fifth article of the Constitution says this:\r\n\r\n     \"The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem\r\n     it necessary, shall propose amendments to this\r\n     Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I cannot agree, for one, to propose an amendment to this\r\nConstitution unless it has the sanction and the approbation of my\r\njudgment; and I suppose no other Senator will. I am bound, therefore,\r\nby every obligation of faith and honor to my State, when a proposition\r\nis submitted to the Senate as one that should be proposed to the\r\nStates as an amendment to the Constitution, to examine it and\r\nunderstand it, and see it in all its bearings and effects, as far as\r\nmy intellect will enable me, and to propose it or to withhold it by my\r\nvote, as I shall be guided by my judgment. I can see no other position\r\nof a Senator.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, what are the facts? The country was convulsed by the success\r\nin the late presidential election of one of the political parties of\r\nthe country. The tremor was evinced at once in all the Southern\r\nStates, in a belief that their existence and their safety was\r\nimperilled by that election. Congress met. As was proper and\r\nnecessary, the very first act in each House was to appoint a committee\r\nto take the condition of the country into consideration, and see if,\r\nby any mode of amendment to the Constitution, those perils could be\r\navoided. A committee was raised in the collateral branch. A committee\r\nwas raised in this Senate, I think upon the motion of the honorable\r\nSenator from Kentucky, actuated as he always is by principles of the\r\nhighest patriotism. Those committees met. They remained in anxious\r\ndeliberation for weeks. What was the result? They were unable to\r\nagree. I think the committee came before the Senate and admitted the\r\nfact. They could agree upon no form of amendment which they believed\r\nwould remedy the evils and avert the perils under which the country\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nIn that state of things, the Legislature of Virginia--my own honored\r\nState--having been called into special session on the 19th of January,\r\npassed a series of resolutions, one of which recites this:\r\n\r\n     \"That on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia, an\r\n     invitation is hereby extended to all such States, whether\r\n     slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite\r\n     with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present\r\n     unhappy controversies in the spirit in which the\r\n     Constitution was originally formed, and consistently with\r\n     its principles, so as to afford to the people of the\r\n     slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of\r\n     their rights.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the recital of the resolution of the Legislature of Virginia:\r\n\"to afford to the people of the slaveholding States adequate\r\nguarantees for the security of their rights;\" and there was a further\r\nprovision, that, if those States should meet and agree upon any form\r\nof adjustment, it should be submitted to Congress. A number of the\r\nStates--some twenty or twenty-one, it seems--some by their\r\nLegislatures, some by their Executives--met the invitation of\r\nVirginia, and deputed their commissioners to the conference in\r\nWashington, to see if they could agree upon a mode of adjustment. We\r\nhave the report of that Conference before us now, presented through a\r\ncommittee of this body; and they propose an additional article to the\r\nConstitution. Mr. President, the honorable Senator from Kentucky, who\r\nhas pronounced so deserved a eulogium upon that body, does not exceed\r\nme in the respect which I bear to it. If there be one more than\r\nanother Senator upon whom it would devolve to treat the work of that\r\nConvention with peculiar respect, it would devolve upon me and my\r\ncolleague, because they met at the invitation of my State. I yield to\r\nnone in the respect which I bear to those gentlemen or to the purity\r\nof their motives in the results which they have attained in that\r\nConference; but, sir, I am bound by my obligations to the\r\nConstitution, by my honor as a man, by my faith to my own State, to\r\nunderstand what they have done, and to exhibit it either in\r\nrecommendation or disapproval, as my judgment may dictate. _Nullius\r\naddictus jurare in verba magistri._\r\n\r\nI admit no authority to bind my judgment as a representative of one of\r\nthe States of the Union. I yield my respect to what they have done;\r\nbut I will scan it, and if, in my honest, unbiased judgment, I cannot\r\nrecommend it as an amendment to the Constitution, I am bound to\r\nwithhold that recommendation, and to give the reasons for it.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, sir, the State of Virginia, finding that Congress was\r\nat a loss for a mode of adjustment, invited the States to send\r\ncommissioners here for this purpose:\r\n\r\n     \"To agree upon something which would afford to the people of\r\n     the slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security\r\n     of their rights.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia knew that, under the Constitution as it was interpreted under\r\nthe constituted authorities of the country as they have been elected,\r\nthere was no security for their rights; and it was in the hope of\r\nobtaining such a security--Congress failing to agree upon it--that, at\r\nher invitation, these gentlemen from the different States met here in\r\nconference. I am to look, therefore, to their work, and to see if it\r\naffords that security for their rights; and if I am satisfied in my\r\nown judgment, as I honestly am--and the reasons for which I am now to\r\nannounce to the world--that it not only affords no security for the\r\nrights of the South, but takes away what little they have, I should be\r\na traitor if I would recommend it as an amendment to the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, let us look at it. It is presented as an entire article, to\r\nbe the thirteenth article, if adopted, of the Constitution. The first\r\nsection of it relates to the Territories--the great and difficult\r\npoint of division between the two sections. If that could be\r\novercome--if these rights that are spoken of in the resolutions of\r\nVirginia in the Territories could be guaranteed by adequate securities\r\nto the slaveholding States--I believe the rest of the path would be\r\nsmooth. It embraces almost the whole controversy. What securities are\r\nprovided in the Territories to the slaveholding States by this first\r\nsection of the thirteenth article? It proposes to divide the present\r\nTerritories--for it is confined to them--by an east and west line, a\r\nparallel of latitude. North of that line, there is a clear cut\r\nentirely, unsusceptible of misinterpretation. None can doubt what the\r\ncondition of servitude is north of that line. It is a clear cut; it is\r\nprohibited, and prohibited forever. No interpretation can mistake it;\r\nno casuist can doubt upon it; it is a work well done. North of that\r\nline involuntary servitude, except for crime, is prohibited. How is it\r\nsouth? My honorable colleague, I think, has well said that, south of\r\nthat line, for our rights, at best we are remitted to a lawsuit. I\r\nwill read the language:\r\n\r\n     \"Nor shall any law be passed by Congress or the Territorial\r\n     Legislature to hinder or prevent the taking of such\r\n     persons--\"\r\n\r\nThat is, persons held to service--\r\n\r\n     \"from any of the States of this Union to said Territories,\r\n     nor to impair the rights arising from said relation.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature has power to\r\ninterfere with the rights arising from the relation of master and\r\nservant, or master and slave. That is the meaning; that is clear. What\r\nnext?\r\n\r\n     \"But the same--\"\r\n\r\nThe rights resulting from the relation of master and slave--\r\n\r\n     \"shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal\r\n     courts, according to the course of the common law.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the security for the rights of the South. South of that line\r\nthey are remitted to the courts under the common law. Now, sir, let us\r\nexamine that. By this section, if it is adopted as an article of the\r\nConstitution, the common law, _eo nomine_, is made a part of the\r\nConstitution, so far as it affects the relations of master and slave.\r\nNow, what is the common law? Who is there upon this floor that will\r\ntell me what common law is meant by this section? With all my respect\r\nfor the thorough knowledge and the legal acquirements of the honorable\r\nSenator from Kentucky, I know he cannot tell me what common law is\r\nmeant by that first section. We know, as jurists, what is meant by the\r\nterm common law, for it is a technical term. The common law is the law\r\nof England, the unwritten law of England, the _lex non scripta_. That\r\nis the common law in its legal acceptation. Is it, then, the law of\r\nEngland that is made a part of the Constitution, and to which the\r\nmaster is remitted for the security of his rights between him and his\r\nservant? Will any gentleman tell me that it is the common law of\r\nEngland that is to be made a part of the Constitution to which we are\r\nto be remitted? If it is the common law of England, is it the common\r\nlaw of England as it stands at this day, on the first of March, 1861?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--If my friend will allow me, I take it that that term\r\napplies only to the remedies known to the common law. The laws of the\r\nTerritories are to be enforced, and the remedies under them are to be\r\nadministered according to common law. The master is to have his rights\r\naccording to the law of the Territory, and to secure those rights\r\naccording to the common law.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--The language of the section is, that neither Congress nor\r\nthe Territorial Legislature shall interfere to impair the rights\r\narising from this relation of master and slave; \"but the same\"--that\r\nis, this relation between master and slave--\"shall be subject to\r\njudicial cognizance in the Federal courts, according to the course of\r\nthe common law.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the honorable Senator says that means only the remedy of the\r\ncommon law; that you are to take the law of the Territory, whatever it\r\nmay be, and administer that, by confining it to the remedies known to\r\nthe common law. I deny the interpretation. The Senator may be right,\r\nor I may be right. I say the text does not warrant the interpretation.\r\nThe text refers to the rights in the relation of master and slave, and\r\nsays they (those rights) shall be the subject of judicial cognizance,\r\naccording to the course of common law. Now, I ask, what is the common\r\nlaw that is thus made a part of the Constitution for the subject to\r\nwhich it refers? Is it the law of England? There is no common law,\r\nthat I am aware of, known to jurists as the law of England. There is\r\nno law in the State of Virginia, and, I presume, none in the State of\r\nKentucky, known as common law. The State of Virginia, when it became\r\nindependent as a colony of Great Britain, adopted and made its own\r\nthat which before had been the common law of England, and therefore\r\nthe common law of the colony. The State of Virginia (and I instance\r\nthat only because I am familiar with it), when it became independent,\r\nadopted as its law the common law of England, as that common law stood\r\nat the commencement of the fourth year of James I.; and thereby, by\r\nstatute, made that which had been the common law, the law of Virginia.\r\nNow, it is the law of Virginia, not because it is the common law, but\r\nbecause statutes made it the law of Virginia. But is the common law of\r\nVirginia, if you will call it by that name, the common law of\r\nKentucky; or is the common law of Kentucky the common law of Missouri;\r\nor is the law of those three States, or any other State, now the\r\ncommon law of England? I demand to know, therefore, when we make the\r\ncommon law a part of the Constitution, if this enactment should\r\nprevail, what is meant by the common law? To that vague, grand\r\nresiduum of judicial legislation we are to be remitted for our rights\r\nbetween master and slave, if this is enacted.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, suppose it were so: my colleague has well said (and I will\r\nnot repeat it after him, for I should only weaken it), that there is\r\nnot one judicial interpreter or expounder of the common law, in any\r\none of the free States, in reference to the relation of master and\r\nslave, that does not deny that the master has any property in his\r\nslave, at this day and this hour. Why, sir, what is the pending\r\ncontroversy between the State of Ohio, one of the free States, and the\r\nState of Kentucky, one of the slave States--a controversy depending\r\nhere recently in the Supreme Court? The Governor of Kentucky demanded,\r\nunder the Constitution, the rendition of a fugitive from justice, who\r\nhad abducted a slave from Kentucky, and carried him into Ohio. The\r\nGovernor of Ohio refused the demand, upon the ground that there could\r\nbe no stealing of a man; that there could be no property in man; and\r\nthat the slave, being a man, was not a subject of theft, of larceny;\r\nand he refused, and refuses up to this day, under the common law, to\r\nrecognize the existence of property in man.\r\n\r\nNow, take the common law of England at this day: here, within the last\r\nthree or four weeks, the Queen's Bench, in England, has declared as\r\nthe common law, that if a slave murders his master, or murders the\r\nagent of his master, in the attempt to recapture him, he is justified.\r\nThat is the common law to which we are to be remitted for the rights\r\nresulting from the relations of master and slave. Sir, I have looked\r\nback a little to see what the common law was in England in this famous\r\nSomerset case, I find this in the argument of the counsel there,\r\nexpounding the common law, which was afterwards sustained by Lord\r\nMANSFIELD in his decision:\r\n\r\n     \"But it has been said by great authorities, though slavery,\r\n     in its full extent, be incompatible with the natural rights\r\n     of mankind, and the principles of good government, yet a\r\n     moderate servitude may be tolerated, nay, sometimes must be\r\n     maintained.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     \"There is now, at last, an attempt, and the first yet known,\r\n     to introduce it [slavery] into England. Long and\r\n     uninterrupted usage, from the origin of the common law,\r\n     stands to oppose its revival.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     \"A new species has never arisen till now; for had it,\r\n     remedies and powers there, would have been at law;\r\n     therefore, the most violent presumption against it, is the\r\n     silence of the laws, were there nothing more. It is very\r\n     doubtful whether the laws of England will permit a man to\r\n     bind himself by contract to serve for life; certainly will\r\n     not suffer him to invest another man with despotism, nor\r\n     prevent his own right to dispose of property.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     \"There are very few instances, few, indeed, of decisions as\r\n     to slaves in this country. Two in Charles II., where it was\r\n     adjudged trover would lie. Chamberlayne and Perrin, William\r\n     III., trover brought for taking a negro slave; adjudged it\r\n     would not lie. 4th Ann., action of trover; judgment by\r\n     default. On arrest of judgment, resolved that trover would\r\n     not lie. Such the determinations in all but two cases; and\r\n     those the earliest, and disallowed by the subsequent\r\n     decisions. Lord HOLT: 'As soon as a slave enters England he\r\n     becomes free.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the court, of Lord MANSFIELD, as to these principles\r\nof common law, that very distinguished and able judge, who made the\r\nlaw, as I understand, for the occasion, but certainly ruled it as the\r\ncommon law, says this:\r\n\r\n     \"The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is\r\n     incapable of being introduced for any reasons, moral or\r\n     political; but only by positive law, which preserves its\r\n     force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from\r\n     whence it was created, is erased from memory. It's so odious\r\n     that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law.\r\n     Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a\r\n     decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by\r\n     the law of England.\"\r\n\r\nI need not go back to authority. We have it abundantly in our own\r\ncountry, in all the free States, so far as I know, without exception.\r\nThey deny what the amendment of my honorable friend from Kentucky\r\naffirms. They deny that there is property in a slave. The amendment of\r\nthe Senator affirms there is property in a slave. This section is\r\nsilent, ominously silent, portentously and potentially silent. It is\r\nnot only silent, Mr. President, but when it refers you to that code of\r\nlaw which is to protect the right of the master to the slave, it\r\nrefers you to the common law, and the common law to be expounded by\r\nthe Federal courts, and the common law, which is judicially and\r\nhistorically known to the whole country, to be expounded in all the\r\nfree States as one that denies that very property which we say must be\r\nsecured. That is our position under this section. Sir, the State of\r\nVirginia has said that we must have adequate guarantees; and I am\r\nasked here to vote away what little guarantees we have. I am asked,\r\nalmost in the high ethics or morals of revealed religion, when my\r\nadversary takes away my cloak, that I shall give him my coat also. I\r\nam required to do that by this section. We believe that our rights are\r\nsecured under the present Constitution; we know that they have been\r\nwithheld by the political party which has now come into power; we\r\nbelieve that they are insecure unless there are further and adequate\r\nguarantees; but, so far from their being proposed by the section\r\nbefore us, in my judgment, what little we have is taken away. Sir, I\r\ncannot vote for these propositions. I regret it. I was prepared,\r\nwhether it had the approval of my judgment or not, to follow the\r\ninstructions of my State, and to vote for the amendment offered by the\r\nhonorable Senator from Kentucky after it had been modified, as was\r\nrequired by the resolutions of my State.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of the Senator from Kentucky was so modified, I do not\r\nknow whether at the instance of Virginia or not; but it was modified\r\nby a vote of this Senate, so as to embrace what was required in the\r\nresolutions of Virginia. I am not at liberty to recommend, or, in the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution, to propose to the States this section of\r\nthe thirteenth article; because it not only withholds, but denies by\r\nwithholding, any security, far less that security which the State of\r\nVirginia requires.\r\n\r\nThere are further provisions in this proposition that are\r\nobjectionable, one of which was pointed out by my colleague: that\r\nwhich calls upon Congress to legislate on that clause of the\r\nConstitution which secures to the citizens of one State all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the several States. I need\r\nnot say that any legislation on that subject by Congress would be any\r\nthing but the messenger of peace to which the honorable Senator from\r\nKentucky looks. Why, sir, it has been found indispensable in\r\nslaveholding States, as a part of their police regulations, to punish\r\nall persons who were either of the State or otherwise, who tamper with\r\nthe slaves, who have intercourse with them that is forbidden by law,\r\nfar more those who preach to them sedition, or insurrection, or\r\nrevolt; and yet, if we were to be controlled within the body of the\r\nState by Federal relations in our interior police, we should be\r\ncompletely at the mercy of the free States.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I should have been certainly gratified, if my honored\r\nState of Virginia had been successful in the mediation which she\r\ninvited of all the States, with a view to agree upon an adjustment\r\nwhich would guaranty the rights of the South. I deeply deplore, and I\r\ndoubt not my State will deplore, that that mediation has not been\r\neffected. So far from impugning any motives or purpose of that\r\nhonorable and distinguished body, I doubt not that, in the short time\r\nthat was allowed to them, they got together the best mode of\r\nadjustment which would satisfy their judgment, but which I am sure\r\nwill not satisfy the judgment of the Southern States, but would place\r\nthem in still greater peril, if they were to admit that to become a\r\npart of the Constitution. I did not intend to do more than state my\r\nobjections to it as briefly as I could. I have done so temperately and\r\nwithout heat, I regret that I cannot, as one Senator, propose this as\r\nan amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I wish only to reply for a single moment to the\r\nmaterial objection urged by the Senator from Virginia. The portion of\r\nthe article to which the Senator from Virginia objects, declares that\r\nthe _status_ of persons bound to service and labor shall remain\r\nunchanged; that neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature shall\r\npass any law affecting the relation, or the rights growing out of the\r\nrelation between master and servant--I do not pretend to recite the\r\nexact words; but that is the exact idea--well knowing that, according\r\nto the laws of the Territory, the _status_ of slavery was fully\r\nestablished, and all the rights of the master in and to his servant\r\nestablished, as they exist in the State of Missouri, or the State of\r\nVirginia, by positive law of the Territory. It is therefore equivalent\r\nto saying that that law shall stand, when it says that the _status_\r\nshall continue unchanged. It then goes on to say (which I admit was\r\naltogether unnecessary) that the remedy for the violation of the\r\nrights of the master, whatever they might be, shall be had in the\r\nFederal courts, and according to the course of the common law. Now,\r\nsir, what right does this take away from any slaveholder? That law\r\nwhich secured and gave him a right, is declared to be unchangeable.\r\nThat law acknowledges his property in any sense in which you please to\r\ntake it, or in any sense in which it is applicable. It acknowledges\r\nit, and gives legal remedies for the violation of it; and in addition\r\nto all that, and, as I admit, by a sort of pleonasm of expression, it\r\nsays that he shall have his remedy in the Federal court, according to\r\nthe course of the common law.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Will the Senator allow me a moment?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--With the permission of the Senator I will put this\r\nproposition to him: He says that the meaning of the language,\r\n\"according to the course of the common law,\" is confined to the\r\nremedy. Now, admitting that to be the case, for the sake of the\r\nargument, suppose, in one of these Territories, a slave is purloined,\r\nseduced, got away; the slave of A gets into the possession of B, and\r\nhe is there at work for him upon his farm, or in his house, and A\r\nbrings an action of trover to recover him; that is an action known to\r\nthe common law; and the decision of the Federal court is, that trover\r\nlies only to recover property, and a slave is not property: what is\r\nthe remedy? That is the decision in England; and I presume it would be\r\nthe decision in the free States, if the suit were brought.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--It was to avoid going into definitions of that sort\r\nthat this language was employed in the amendments of the Convention.\r\nThey saw and had before them the law of New Mexico, which did\r\nacknowledge the existence of this right as fully as it is\r\nacknowledged by the law of Virginia. However it may be disputed here,\r\nhowever legal opinions may differ about it, the law of New Mexico\r\nestablished property in slaves; and there the law stands; and the\r\nConvention now comes and says that _status_ shall remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--That is the resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--Will the honorable Senator allow me a word, for I am very\r\nanxious to understand it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--The Senator says it provides that that law, the law of New\r\nMexico, whatever it may be, shall remain unchanged, if I understand\r\nhim, and that that fixes the _status_ of slavery in the Territory. I\r\ncall the attention of the Senator to the language. I think that only\r\nfixes the _status_ of persons now in the Territory, and not those to\r\nbe carried there hereafter--not the _status_ of slavery, but the\r\n_status_ of persons who are there now, held to service or labor, and\r\nnot the _status_ of those who are to be carried there in future. That\r\nis provided for in the language which it follows in another part.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Here it is, sir:\r\n\r\n     \"In all the present territory south of that  line\"--\r\n\r\nWhich I have explained, and which gentlemen admit to be embraced in\r\nthe Territory of New Mexico--\r\n\r\n     \"the _status_ of persons held to involuntary service or\r\n     labor, as it now exists.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not as to such slaves as are now there, but such slavery as now\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--If it said that, I admit that it would cover the _status_\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--It does say that. It seems to me that is the only\r\nconstruction that can be given to the language. It could not be\r\nintended to confine it to the twenty-six slaves that are now held\r\nthere, especially when they provided, in a subsequent article, that it\r\nshall be lawful for any one to carry slaves there.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--Will the honorable Senator again allow me to interrupt\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. BRAGG:--I have not the slightest doubt that a great many who voted\r\nfor the proposition consider it as the Senator does. I have equally as\r\nlittle doubt that others intended it to mean precisely what I have\r\nstated. I cannot see, for my life, while they were framing a\r\nconstitutional provision, why they did not place this matter beyond\r\nany sort of doubt. If they intended to recognize slavery, they could\r\nhave said so in one word. If they intended not to recognize it, they\r\ncould have said it in another word. If they intended to mystify and\r\nleave in doubt, then they have been very successful in accomplishing\r\ntheir purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--\"In all the present territory south of that line, the\r\n_status_ of persons held to involuntary service or labor, as it now\r\nexists;\" not as they now exist; not in respect to those that are there\r\nnow; but part of the same sort of slavery which now exists, shall\r\ncontinue to exist unchanged until the Territory becomes a State; and\r\nin the mean time persons shall be admitted to go into that Territory\r\nand carry their slaves with them. Now, I submit it to my honorable\r\nfriend if it is not entirely improbable that any such construction as\r\nhe suggests can prevail before any court that seeks to attain the real\r\nintention of the parties who made this proposition? It is such slavery\r\nas now exists. Persons held to that service--you may carry as many\r\nthere as you please. Put them both together, and they would read so;\r\nand they being in the same instrument, can there be a doubt that ought\r\nto alarm us here, that the construction will be given to it which I\r\nplace upon it, that it was intended not to be confined merely to\r\npersons now there and held to servitude, but as well to those who\r\nmight be carried there hereafter? This is all I will say in reference\r\nto that; and I submit it to the candor and the judgment of my\r\nhonorable friend from North Carolina, in which I have entire\r\nconfidence, whatever result he may come to, that if we put the two\r\npropositions together, all doubt would seem to be removed.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, my friend from Virginia will argue this question as if the\r\nquestion of slavery was to be decided according to the course of the\r\ncommon law, and then refers us to the express declarations and\r\ndecisions as though the common law decided that slavery could not\r\nexist. What sort of construction would that make of this provision?\r\nHere they have provided that the law establishing slavery shall exist,\r\nthat the property of the master in him shall be recognized as it is\r\nthere established by law; and then the gentleman supposes that to be\r\nexactly contradictory, to refer to the common law as furnishing the\r\nrule of decision, which common law says there can be no property, as\r\nhe interprets it, in man, and that when trover was brought for a\r\nslave--\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Not as I interpret it, but as interpreted in England.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I know that. He says it may be so interpreted; that\r\nwhen trover was brought for a slave in England, the judges decided\r\nthere was no property in man. Could the same judges, sitting in a\r\ncourt in New Mexico, have given that decision when the law there\r\nestablished such property? In such a case, their decision must be\r\ndifferent. They are referring, according to him, to two contradictory\r\nrules: one establishing slavery and acknowledging property in the\r\nmaster, and the other the common law denouncing and deciding against\r\nthe right of property in man. This could not have been their\r\nintention, nor can this be the construction. We cannot consider these\r\ngentlemen to have changed their opinion from one sentence to another,\r\nto have left an incongruity and a contradiction expressed upon the\r\nface of the same section.\r\n\r\nNor, sir, do they refer--and that is my answer to my friend from\r\nVirginia--to the common law as furnishing the rule of decision at all.\r\nThe proceedings shall be according to the course of the common law;\r\nthat is all. If any violation is done to the rights of the master, he\r\nmay sue; and, for his greater security, he may sue in the Federal\r\ncourts; and, for greater security still, the law shall be administered\r\naccording to the course of the common law. The common law is referred\r\nto as determining the mode of trial. We say according to the course of\r\nthe civil law, and we say according to the course of the common law.\r\nWhat do we mean? We mean this marked and characteristic and essential\r\ndifference: the course of the civil law is for the judge, without the\r\nintervention of a jury, to decide facts as well as the law. The common\r\nlaw takes away from the judge the power of deciding the facts, and\r\ndemands a trial by jury. What this convention mean, therefore, by this\r\nprovision is, that trial shall be by jury, according to the course of\r\nthe common law. That is the explanation of the difficulty, and thus\r\nall doubt is removed. By these plain provisions--plain in themselves,\r\nand made plainer still by being taken with the context--they say you\r\nshall have your rule of right, according to the law of the Territory,\r\nwhich is in your favor as to the right to hold persons as property;\r\nthat law shall be your security; you shall have a remedy for any\r\nviolation of that right in the Federal courts, and you shall have that\r\nremedy, not according to the course of the civil law, in which the\r\njudge is to decide, who might be against you, but in which a jury\r\nshall be called to decide the fact according to the course of the\r\ncommon law. That is the whole of it.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Mr. President--\r\n\r\nMr. POLK:--If the Senator will allow me, before the Senator from\r\nKentucky sits down, I will ask him if the Mexican law establishes\r\nslavery, or if it does any thing more than to protect the right of the\r\nmaster to his slave? If that is the only establishment of it, then it\r\nis established by implication merely.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I really do not know whether the gentleman would\r\nconsider it as establishing or merely protecting. I do not know that\r\nthere is a law in any State of the Union that _eo nomine_ establishes\r\nslavery; I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. POLK:--The object of the inquiry was this: it has been contended\r\nheretofore that, by the law of Mexico, there could be no slavery\r\nthere; and then there is another law of New Mexico professing to\r\nprotect the right of property. I have never seen that New Mexican law.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I believe I have answered the gentleman as far as my\r\ninformation extends. I have examined that law. It is as strong in\r\nfavor of the master as the laws of Kentucky or Missouri. I believe it\r\nis the law of Mississippi transcribed literally, _verbatim_. That is\r\nmy understanding. The law is as complete on the subject as the law of\r\nany State that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Mr. President, if the Senator from Kentucky is right, and,\r\nin the interpretation of this section, the courts are necessarily to\r\nconsider the expression, \"according to the course of the common law,\"\r\nto which slaveholders are referred for the enforcing of the relation\r\nof master and slave, as referring only to common law remedies, then I\r\nam at no loss to conceive, after our experience of judicial\r\ninterpretation against slavery, by what sort of artificial and\r\nsophistic reasoning those judges of the Federal courts may feel\r\nthemselves bound to withhold the remedy. Why, sir, are we to shut our\r\nears and our eyes against experience passing before us every day? What\r\nis the present Constitution? The second section of the fourth article\r\nis in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or\r\n     other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in\r\n     another State, shall, on demand of the executive authority\r\n     of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be\r\n     removed to the State having jurisdiction of the crime.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the text of the Constitution. What is the interpretation in\r\nthe free States? In the State of Kentucky an African is property,\r\nunder their laws and usages, and has been so for two hundred years;\r\nfor it was so when it was a part of Virginia; and did it ever enter\r\ninto the mind of man to conceive that this plain text of the\r\nConstitution would be resisted, upon the ground that property in man\r\nwas not acknowledged? And yet it is done. If I am not mistaken, the\r\nhonorable Senator from New York [Mr. SEWARD], not now in his seat,\r\nwhen Governor of New York, made that very question with the Governor\r\nof Virginia; and seeing this, are we to be willingly blind to this as\r\nthe actual, judicial, and executive interpretation in every thing that\r\naffects the question of slavery as it stands in that section, and\r\nthat, too, while we are seeking equality? Sir, it never entered into\r\nthe mind of man, at the time this Constitution was formed, to credit\r\nthat the time could ever come in the relations of these States when a\r\nman who fled from the State of Kentucky because he had stolen a negro\r\ninto the State of Ohio, was screened from the operation of the\r\nConstitution, because in Ohio they do not deem a negro to be the\r\nsubject of property; and yet that is the fact, the very issue now\r\ndepending between those States; and we are asked to be blind,\r\nwillingly blind, to all that experience at the very time we are\r\nattempting to secure a guarantee for violated rights!\r\n\r\nNow, I said, Mr. President, that, if I were to tax my ingenuity, I\r\nmight find a mode, even if the honorable Senator is right in ascribing\r\nto this clause of the section the necessary interpretation that it\r\nrefers to remedies only. The Senator says the previous part of the\r\nsection establishes the relation, as he construes it, not directly\r\nlike the resolution of the honorable Senator which we offer here as an\r\namendment, which establishes directly that there is property in\r\nslaves. This does not; but designedly avoids it; not from any improper\r\nmotive--I do not ascribe that--but it is not only silent, but it\r\navoids the very question. I suppose the honorable Senator is right in\r\nsaying this language, judicial cognizance, according to the course of\r\nthe common law, refers only to the remedy. Now, I tax my ingenuity to\r\nknow how a court, in one of the free States, always leaning, of\r\ncourse, against slavery, would reason out that proposition, whether\r\nthe remedy could be applied. Suppose an action of trover is brought.\r\nThe inquiry would be, what is the remedy? We are told this is the\r\nremedy for which you are to apply to the law. A remedy is nothing in\r\nthe world but a redress for wrong. Before you can apply the remedy,\r\ntherefore, you must ascertain whether a wrong has been committed for\r\nwhich the remedy is adequate. Well, it comes from one side: the wrong\r\nwas in taking the negro from the possession of the owner, against the\r\nlocal law of the Territory. The answer would be, \"that may be true as\r\nfar as the local law of the Territory is concerned; but here the\r\nConstitution adopts the common law as part of its text, and points the\r\njudges to the common law, and it applies the remedy.\" Now, the remedy\r\nis redress of the wrong, and we are bound to see that the wrong is one\r\nto which the remedy is applicable. The remedy is to recover property\r\nin the possession of one who is not entitled to it, and the common\r\nlaw, which applies that remedy to that wrong, says there is no wrong\r\ninflicted by taking the negro from the possession of his owner. It\r\ncomes to that. It is suggested to me by the honorable Senator from\r\nVermont [Mr. COLLAMER], that the common law, as a remedy, is one\r\napplicable to a common-law wrong. I do not say that the reasoning is\r\njust; I do not say that it is juridical; but I say, in our experience,\r\nwe should be willingly blind if we take that for a security which will\r\nonly be a snare.\r\n\r\nMr. PUGH:--Mr. President, it is very well known to the Senate that I\r\nprefer the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky, as a matter of\r\nindividual choice, to the proposition which is proposed by the Peace\r\nConference. Nevertheless, that Conference having been authorized, if\r\nnot by Congress, at all events, so far as my State is concerned, by\r\nthe act of her Legislature; and an overwhelming majority of the\r\ncommissioners having agreed to this proposition as it stands, I shall\r\nhesitate very much in departing from it, whatever might be my\r\nindividual opinion; but certainly if I thought the two Senators from\r\nVirginia had given it a correct interpretation, I should not agree to\r\nit. Now, as to this clause, it, in my judgment, had better have been\r\nomitted:\r\n\r\n     \"The same shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the\r\n     Federal courts, according to the course of the common law.\"\r\n\r\nI suggest that the common law is referred to as fixing a right simply.\r\nThe course of the common law is a phrase defined for more than two\r\nhundred years, in Latin, in English, and in Norman French. It means\r\nthe formula of proceeding. I understood the Senator from Virginia [Mr.\r\nMASON] to say that it had been decided in several of the courts that\r\nan action of trover could not be brought for a negro slave in England.\r\nI think I am familiar with the case. It is reported in Salkeld's\r\nReports, Lord Raymond's Reports, and in the Modern Reports--the same\r\ncase reported three times; but the same court which decided that\r\ntrover would not lie, because trover included the idea of property in\r\nthe man himself, in the same opinion said that trespass on the case\r\nwould lie for the loss of the service; so that it was all a question\r\nof pleading, and no question of right at all. It is within my\r\nrecollection--and I believe the case was brought to the Supreme Court\r\non a writ of error, and can be found in Howard's Reports--that a\r\ncitizen of Kentucky declared in trespass on the case for taking away\r\nhis slaves, and added two counts in trover. What is trover but an\r\naction of trespass on the case? Nothing more; and it never was any\r\nthing more. The measure of damages is the same in both actions--the\r\nvalue of the service of the servant; and yet that controversy on mere\r\npleading--which, in nine-tenths of the States of this Union, has\r\nceased to be of any value, because they have a code of procedure, is\r\nmade a terrific objection here.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I have never read the code of New Mexico, and I do not\r\npropose to read it; but it is perfectly understood that that\r\nTerritorial Legislature, pursuing the privilege, if you call it\r\nprivilege, conferred by the compromise measures of 1850, has\r\nestablished the relation of master and slave, or master and servant,\r\nas perfectly as it is established in any of the fifteen so-called\r\nslaveholding States. I do not admire this word \"_status_\" which we\r\nfind in the report of the Peace Conference; but as to the meaning of\r\nthat word, I cannot be in any doubt. It does not refer to any persons\r\nin particular; it refers to a legal relation of servitude as between\r\nmaster and servant, and it provides that that relation, or condition,\r\nor _status_, shall not be changed; that for all wrongs or\r\ncontroversies arising out of that there shall be a remedy through the\r\nFederal judiciary.\r\n\r\nI can see why the commission made this distinction. There have been\r\nmany who have insisted that the Congress of the United States should\r\npass laws for the protection of the right of the master to the\r\nservices of his slave in a Territory; but it has always been my\r\nopinion, that the worst thing the slaveholding States ever could have\r\nwould be to have that; for there would be a perpetual controversy here\r\nfrom session to session, and from day to day, whether the law went far\r\nenough in giving protection or went too far; and they would be\r\nremitting their right to the adjudication of the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from the non-slaveholding States. Others have\r\ninsisted, as the propositions of my honorable friend from Kentucky\r\nprovided, that the relation should be protected by the legislation of\r\nthe territorial authority. I would rather it were so, individually, if\r\nthey chose to establish it. The peace commission do not want that.\r\nThey evidently do not want to quarrel with the Territorial\r\nLegislatures about the measure of legislation; but they declare the\r\nright, and then say that this right shall be enforced in the Federal\r\njudiciary according to the course of remedies and forms of the common\r\nlaw. I do not see how there can be a doubt; and yet, as I have said,\r\nit seems to me that a great deal of it is unnecessary verbiage. I do\r\nnot mean to debate that; I am not one of the peace commissioners; I am\r\nnot to select my words to express the idea; but I am here; and my\r\nState with other States, having appointed commissioners in view of a\r\ncrisis like this, as they esteem it, and as I esteem it, and they\r\nhaving agreed upon a great variety of propositions, some of which\r\ncommend themselves to my judgment and some do not; but taking it\r\naltogether as one proposition, I am satisfied that I must either vote\r\nfor all of it, or let all of it fall. I would rather vote for the\r\nproposition of my honorable friend from Kentucky. I said that sixty\r\ndays ago; and I have said it in season and out of season. I have\r\nexpressed my views frequently. I think the proposition of the\r\ncommissioners would be better expressed, though it would come to the\r\nsame thing, in these words: \"in all the territory south of that line,\r\nit is hereby declared that no law or regulation shall ever be made or\r\nhave any effect denying or impairing the right of the inhabitants to\r\nthe service or labor of such persons as were held in that condition in\r\nany State of the Union; and thence taken into the said Territory.\"\r\nThat would have expressed my idea more clearly, yet I am satisfied\r\nwith this; it amounts to that. Whether the word \"_status_\" be good\r\nLatin or good English, the meaning is very clear.\r\n\r\nI believe I admonished the Senate two hours ago that time was very\r\nprecious; and I shall not detain them myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--Mr. President, I mean to vote for the passage of these\r\nproposed amendments, just as they are, without any change; and I\r\npropose to give very briefly a few of the reasons which govern my\r\njudgment in that act. I will do it as pointedly as I can, and I will\r\ncertainly do it very briefly.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I feel that I am but submitting to the people of\r\nthe whole country, amendments which they, and they only, can\r\nincorporate in the present Constitution; and I do not believe that, in\r\nany state of the case, I can do very wrong in doing that; but when I\r\nconsider the immediate condition of the country, I feel that I am\r\ndoing very right. Twenty States assemble in what is called the Peace\r\nConvention. They recommend to us, in times of great trial and\r\ndifficulty, the passage of these resolutions. They are eminent men;\r\nthey are able men; they are--very many of them, at least--great men;\r\nthey have been selected by the States which they respectively\r\nrepresent, because of their purity of character and ability. The\r\ncountry is in great trouble. Six States have seceded; and I am told by\r\nvery many men in whom I have great confidence, that their States are\r\nto-day trembling in the balance. I believe it. I am told--and upon\r\nthat subject I have not yet made up my mind--that the adoption of\r\nthese measures by the people will heal the differences with the Border\r\nStates. I do not believe that I can do wrong, therefore, in giving the\r\npeople of the whole Union a chance to determine these questions.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, I voted against the propositions of the\r\ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. Even then I did not perceive any\r\ngreat harm in submitting any propositions to the people of the United\r\nStates which circumstances might appear to render necessary for any\r\ngood purpose. I refused to vote for them, for two reasons: first, I\r\nbelieved something better might be attained; and second, I did not\r\nbelieve that the people of the States would agree to them. I do not\r\nbelieve that now, and for one simple reason: I think I may consider\r\nmyself in some respect a representative of the opinion as well as the\r\npower of my own people. I am a Republican, a zealous and determined\r\none. I have all my life been of the opinion that Congress ought not to\r\nprotect slavery, and to extend the dominion of this Government for\r\nthat purpose or with that possibility. A great many in the North, who\r\nare not Republicans, but are what we call DOUGLAS men, have shown, at\r\nthe last election, under something of trial and sacrifice, that they\r\ntoo, do not believe that the Constitution does or ought to extend\r\nslavery. I am not disposed to give up that opinion; I do not believe\r\nthey are. I was not disposed to give up when six States were in the\r\nUnion who are now out, as they say; and I am not disposed to give it\r\nup yet. Independently of pride of opinion, I do not believe that kind\r\nof sacrifice would accomplish any good result.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons in brief which induced me to vote with regret\r\nagainst the propositions of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky in\r\nthe earlier portion of this session. But now, we are within two days\r\nof adjournment. Propositions essentially variant in their character to\r\nthose are submitted here; and I am asked: \"Will you, in your\r\nrepresentative capacity, submit these to your people for their\r\ndecision, either to accept or reject?\" Now, why not? I need not dwell\r\nupon the fact that, while we are a representative, we are at the same\r\ntime a democratic Government. I will not shut my eyes to the fact that\r\ntwenty States appeal to us; I will not shut my eyes to the fact that\r\nthere is imminent danger of permanent dissolution; I will not shut my\r\neyes to the fact that, though the Republican party is in a\r\nconstitutional majority, it is not yet, and it never has been, in an\r\nactual majority; and I do not believe that it is possible for\r\none-third of the people to coerce the opinion of two-thirds.\r\n\r\nMr. WILKINSON:--I wish to ask the gentleman a question.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--Do, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. WILKINSON:--I understand him as saying that the whole of the\r\ntwenty States which were assembled in this Peace Convention agreed to\r\nthis proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--My distinguished friend was writing, instead of listening,\r\nwhen he understood that. I did not mean to say that, and I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. WILKINSON:--I understood the Senator to say that twenty States\r\nappealed to us.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--Yes, sir; just as I say that the Government appeals to\r\nanother Government, I do not say every individual in it; just as I say\r\nthat Congress appeals to another Government, not every individual\r\nmember of Congress; but I do say, in the words of the proposition\r\nbefore us, that \"they,\" the Peace Convention, composed of the States\r\nrecited, \"have approved what is herewith submitted, and respectfully\r\nrequest that your honorable body will submit it to conventions in the\r\nStates, as article thirteen of the amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\" That is all I said, or, at least, it is all I\r\nmeant to say.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, suppose every argument that the distinguished Senators from\r\nVirginia have brought to bear on this proposition was true: what then?\r\nIs that any reason why it should not be submitted to the people?\r\nSuppose they do not approve of it: what then? It is their business,\r\nnot ours. Suppose they should: it is a measure of peace, of security,\r\nof union. Sir, I know, as you do, many of the members of that\r\nConvention. I have acted with them as Whigs in old times, and I wish\r\nthey could come back. I know they have proved in old times, as they\r\nwill prove again, that they love this Union to the very depth and core\r\nof their hearts. I do not propose to give them up; I do not propose to\r\nweaken them; I do admire, with my whole heart, the sacrifice of\r\nopinion which they make, and which is typified by the noble expression\r\nof the distinguished Senator from Kentucky to-day. Party or no party,\r\nNorth or no North, I, at least, will meet him half way. My State is\r\nvery far distant. She had no members in that Convention. I do not know\r\nwhether she will approve this measure; but I know it will neither hurt\r\nthat State nor me to give her a chance to determine. I know very well\r\nthat the Senators from Virginia do not approve it. That is the very\r\nreason I do. [Laughter.] If I was sure they would not think me guilty\r\nof disrespect, I would remind them of what was said by a distinguished\r\nman in old times. Phocion, in the last days of his Republic--and I\r\nhope in that respect, at least, there will be no parallel--Phocion was\r\nonce making a speech to the Athenian people, and something he said\r\nexcited very great applause. He turned around to gentlemen, friends\r\nnear him, and said: \"What foolish thing have I been saying, that these\r\npeople praise me?\" Sir, if Virginia, represented as she is to-day--not\r\nas I believe she really is--but if Virginia, represented as she is\r\nhere to-day, and as she has been during this session, were to approve\r\nthese propositions, I should doubt them very much indeed.\r\n\r\nI was surprised, however, to hear some things that the distinguished\r\nSenator from Virginia--I do not know whether to call him junior or\r\nsenior--said. I do not mean the Senator who spoke last. He [Mr.\r\nHUNTER] says that this proposition here is worse than the old\r\nConstitution. If that be really so, what in the world has he been\r\ncomplaining of so bitterly? He tells us, now, that under the old\r\nConstitution slavery was secure. Then, why do you grumble? He\r\nconsiders it as secure, not only wherever it is, but wherever it can\r\ngo--nay, more than that; wherever the Stars and Stripes of the\r\nAmerican Republic can float. I have been telling my people that, as a\r\nRepublican, for a long while, and complaining of the Dred Scott\r\ndecision; but he says slavery is secured. All the complaint that the\r\nother Senator from Virginia [Mr. MASON] makes, is against the decision\r\nof the courts in the free States we have been in the habit of making,\r\nwhich he insists are against the decision of the Supreme Court,\r\nconstituted other than we wished it was. We have been in the habit of\r\nbelieving that one of the great evils we complained of was under the\r\nold Constitution, and that a new construction was given to it, alien\r\nto the intention, wish, construction, of our fathers; and we have\r\ncomplained that the Supreme Court was so constituted that it could not\r\nbe reversed. We complained, as partisans, that now this Senate and the\r\nother House were so composed that we had no power in the Government,\r\nsave through the President. Now, the Senator from Virginia indorses\r\nthe whole of it, and says they were very well off, and did\r\nbeautifully. Then why dissolve; why threaten; why make a Peace\r\nConference necessary?\r\n\r\nMr. President, let us be just to these propositions. As a Republican,\r\nI give up something when I vote for them; but remember, sir, I am not\r\nvoting for them now; I am only voting to submit them to my people; and\r\nI shall go before them, when the time comes, being governed in my\r\nopinion and advice as to whether they shall vote for them or not, as I\r\nsee that Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Missouri,\r\nby their people, desire. To be frank, sir; if this proposition will\r\nsuit the Border States, if there will be peace and union, and loyalty\r\nand brotherhood, with this, I will vote for it at the polls with all\r\nmy heart and with all my soul; but if I see that the counsels of the\r\nSenators from Virginia shall prevail; if my noble friend from\r\nTennessee [Mr. JOHNSON] shall be overwhelmed; if secession shall still\r\ngrow in the public mind there; if they are determined, upon artificial\r\ncauses of complaint, as I believe, still to unite their fate, their\r\ndestiny, and their hope, with the extremest South, then, perceiving\r\nthem to be of no avail, I shall refuse them. Therefore, at the polls\r\nat last, I shall be governed as an individual citizen by my\r\nconviction at the moment of what the ultimate result of these\r\npropositions will be; but I am not voting for that to-day. I am\r\nsaying: \"People of the United States, I submit it to you; twenty\r\nStates demand it; the peace of the country requires it; there is\r\ndissolution in the very atmosphere; States have gone off; others\r\nthreaten; the Queen of England upon her throne declares to the whole\r\nworld her sympathy with our unfortunate condition; foreign Governments\r\ndenote that there is danger to-day that the greatest Confederation the\r\nworld has ever seen is to be parted in pieces, never to be reunited.\"\r\nNow, not what I wish, not what I want, not what I would have, but all\r\nthat I can get, is before me. I know that I do no harm. If the people\r\nof Oregon do not like it, they can easily reject it. If the people of\r\nPennsylvania will not have it, they can easily throw it aside. If they\r\ndo not believe there is danger of dissolution, if they prefer\r\ndissolution, if they think they can compel fifteen States to remain in\r\nor come back, or if they believe they will not go out, let them reject\r\nit. I repeat again, it is their business, it is not mine.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, whether I vote for it at the polls or not, in voting for it\r\nhere it may be said that I give up some of my principles. Mr.\r\nPresident, we sometimes mistake our opinions for our principles. I am\r\nappealed to often; it is said to me: \"You believed in the Chicago\r\nplatform.\" Suppose I did. \"Well, this varies from the Chicago\r\nplatform.\" Suppose it does. I stand to-day, as I believe, in the\r\npresence of greater events than those which attend the making of a\r\nPresident. I stand, as I believe, at least, in the presence of peace\r\nand war; and if it were true that I did violate the Chicago platform,\r\nthe Chicago platform is not a Constitution of the United States to me.\r\nIf events, if circumstances change, I will violate it, appealing to my\r\nconscience, to my country, and to my God, to justify me according to\r\nthe motive. [Applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FOSTER in the chair). Order will be\r\npreserved in the galleries, or they will be cleared.\r\n\r\nMr. BAKER:--Again, sir, let us see how, as a Republican, I give up any\r\nthing. First, suppose I did: I would give up a great deal to preserve\r\na great Government; I would give up a great deal to be able to shake\r\nhands with Kentucky and Tennessee as friends for the rest of my life,\r\nas I have in all that has gone before. I would not be ashamed to give\r\nup. I would not at least be giving up to traitorous secession, such as\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina are guilty of to-day; but I\r\nwould be giving up to loyal and affectionate brethren, who implore me\r\nfor the love of a common Union to do something to satisfy the doubts\r\nand fears of their people. I can stand that; I will do it.\r\n\r\nAgain, sir; how much do I give up? I have said, as a Republican, that\r\nCongress has the power to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of\r\nthe United States. I believe it to-day. Talking about giving up, there\r\nare a good many other people that give up something here. Gentlemen on\r\nthe other side, who have been contending that Congress had no power\r\nwhatever to prohibit slavery, acknowledge that they were mistaken; at\r\nany rate they go for it; they do prohibit it by law, by the\r\nConstitution itself. Therefore I am not the only one that gives up.\r\n\r\nAgain: I believe it is wrong, politically wrong--I am not now\r\ndiscussing the social and moral question--but I believe it to be\r\npolitically very wrong to establish slavery in the name of freedom.\r\nSir, twelve years ago or more, it was my fortune, perhaps, to wander\r\nin a foreign land beneath the Stars and Stripes of my country. I went\r\nthere, as I think, impelled by motives of patriotism, perhaps having\r\nmingled with them not a little desire of adventure, love of change,\r\nand that feverish excitement for which we people of this country are\r\nalways and everywhere remarkable; but I believe, if I know myself,\r\nthat I did suppose I was doing something to repay the country for much\r\nthat she had done for me. Sir, often and again, wandering sometimes\r\nbeneath\r\n\r\n     \"Where Orizaba's purpled summit shone,\"\r\n\r\nsometimes by the dark pestilential river that marks the boundary\r\nbetween the two countries, often and often have I wondered to myself\r\nwhether I was wandering and suffering there to spread slavery over an\r\nunwilling people. I am not sorry to see that now that is rendered\r\nimpossible. I am not sorry to see that it is impossible, first, in the\r\ncourse of events; but if it were not so, I know, if these propositions\r\nshall pass, that the foul blot of slavery never will be extended over\r\none foot of territory to be stolen or conquered by the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBut I am asked, \"What do you say about New Mexico?\" I will tell you in\r\ntwenty words. I am an older Republican than many of those I see around\r\nme, who vote to-day differently from me; not a better but an older. I\r\nvoted in 1850, on the floor of the other House, against the compromise\r\nmeasures of that year. I did so, among other reasons, because I was\r\nnot willing that Utah and New Mexico should become slave or free\r\naccording to the wishes of their people, believing as I did then (I\r\nhave changed my opinion in some respects since), that that was not\r\nbest for the whole country. Contrary to my wishes, those compromise\r\nmeasures prevailed. New Mexico is nominally now, I believe, a slave\r\nTerritory; that is, to use the words of the distinguished Senator from\r\nNew York [Mr. SEWARD], there are some twenty slaves in the whole\r\nTerritory. There they may, they probably will, remain. I submit to my\r\npeople a proposition, that if they approve it as a compromise, as a\r\nconcession, for peace for the Union, as it happens that that little\r\nTerritory includes all that possibly can be slave territory, they will\r\nlet it alone till the people are able and willing to make their own\r\nState constitution. That is all. Do I state it fairly? Does it go\r\nbeyond that?\r\n\r\nFirst, I contend that I give up but little. I give it up, as I\r\nunderstand, for purposes of freedom; and the distinguished Senators\r\nfrom Virginia agree with me. They say, in substance, that I am getting\r\na great deal more than I give; and I confess, taking that view of the\r\nsubject, at least in part, I wonder that a good many more of my\r\nRepublican friends do not go with me.\r\n\r\nAgain: it is said on the Republican side that we protect slavery. In\r\none sense we do, and in another sense we do not. In the offensive idea\r\nto me and to you of protecting slavery, I do no such thing, and I\r\nwould die first. When the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky\r\nwere up the other day, I voted for the amendment of the other Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky [Mr. POWELL], in order to make them clear, to show what\r\nI was voting against. I was unwilling that territory hereafter to be\r\nacquired should be rendered slave territory; and I put that\r\nproposition distinctly in it, in order that when I voted against them,\r\nit might be seen why and how I did it. As I have said, this\r\nproposition renders that impossible. First, it refers only to the\r\nterritory we now possess; that is, New Mexico alone. As to the\r\nterritory north of 36° 30´, I need not speak. We know that God\r\nAlmighty has registered a decree in Heaven that that shall never be\r\nslave. We, on our part, want no WILMOT proviso there; we all agree\r\nthat we are willing to let it alone. South, there is but the barren\r\nTerritory of New Mexico. Beyond that, who knows? If we are to acquire\r\nit, we are to acquire it by this proposition, by the assent of a\r\nmajority of the States of both sections and two-thirds of the whole;\r\nand I do not know a man living who believes that with that proposition\r\nincorporated in the Constitution, slavery is probable, or even\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr. President, I agree that in the compromise I, as a\r\nRepublican, do give up to that extent, and no more, what I have said;\r\nbut doing that, I believe that I consecrate all the territory between\r\nhere and Cape Horn to freedom, with all its blessings, forever and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nSo far, sir, as the discussion as to the meaning of this phrase about\r\nthe common law is concerned, I do not care to indulge in it, and for\r\nthis simple reason: first, according to the legal view of the Senator\r\nfrom Ohio, everybody knows that this expression, \"the course of the\r\ncommon law,\" means the duly established forms of procedure known to\r\nthe courts; that is all. In the next place, I am not afraid of the\r\ncommon law. I have been reared under it. With all its imperfections,\r\nand they are many, I love it. While it may be an objection to Virginia\r\nto quote it, to me it is full of guardianship and blessing. I do not\r\nstop to talk about the Somerset case, nor the decision in Salkeld, nor\r\nthe Modern Reports. It is enough for me that I know, taking the whole\r\nproposition together, that slavery is impossible beyond where it now\r\nis, and, as a Republican, I can justify myself to my conscience in\r\ngiving that vote.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I add very few more words. I should have been\r\nexcessively pleased, as a partisan and a man, if the inauguration of\r\nMr. LINCOLN could be one at which all the States would attend with the\r\nold good feeling, and with the old good humor. I have seen six States\r\nseparate themselves, as they say, from us, and form a new confederacy,\r\nwith great pain and greater surprise. I cannot shut my eyes, if I\r\nwould, to the existing state of things. I listen to the warning of my\r\nfriend from Kentucky. I listen to the warning of my friend from\r\nTennessee. I have been in both States. I know something of their\r\npeople. I believe that there, even there, the Union is in danger; and\r\nI believe if we break up here without some attempt to reconcile them\r\nto us, and us to them, many of the predictions of friends and foes as\r\nto the danger will be accomplished. I said, in the earlier part of the\r\nsession--I repeat it--I would yield nothing to secession. When the\r\nRepresentatives from South Carolina and Mississippi and Alabama and\r\nLouisiana came here invoking war, telling us that if we did not yield\r\nto them they would secede, they would confederate with foreign\r\nGovernments, they would break this Union, they would hold us as aliens\r\nand strangers and enemies, I believed then, as I believe now, that\r\nthat was too dear a price to pay even for Union and peace; but to-day\r\nthe case is altered. Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, reiterate their\r\nlove for the Union. They tell us in unmistakable terms that they\r\ndesire to remain; and in every county, nay, in every township of those\r\nStates, we have staunch and true and ardent friends who would be\r\nwilling to seal their devotion to this Union with their blood. It is\r\nthey to whose appeal I would listen. It is from them that I would take\r\ncounsel and advice; and when they tell me, \"pass these resolutions;\r\nthey are resolutions of peace; submit them to your people; listen to\r\nwhat ours say in reply; if it appears to you at the polls that these\r\nresolutions will produce peace, restore union, create or renew\r\nfraternal, kindly feeling, pass them; let us settle this question, and\r\nbe one people,\" I agree; with all my heart, I will do it.\r\n\r\nNow, as I close, let me ask what evil; who will be hurt? Suppose, when\r\nI get home, I find that the Senators from Virginia are on the stump\r\nand they are convincing their people that they are a great deal worse\r\noff; the more they convince Virginia that she is worse off, the more\r\nPennsylvania and New York will be convinced that they are better off;\r\nand every argument they make against it in Virginia will have a\r\ntwofold weight North and West. I could not make half as good a speech\r\nin favor of these propositions of Union, even in Oregon, or\r\nCalifornia, or Illinois--I speak of the States I know best--as I\r\nshould make if I were to read their objections to these propositions.\r\n\r\nBut suppose--which I do not think possible--they could succeed, not\r\nonly in Virginia (which I do not believe), but in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee; suppose they were to swear, by the throne of God, they\r\nwould not take them, but would dissolve and go off whether we passed\r\nthem or not: we could very easily refuse to vote for them and be in as\r\ngood a condition as we are to-day, and, in the mean time, next Monday,\r\nMr. LINCOLN will be inaugurated. I desire to see around him thronging,\r\nnay forming the procession, every augury of hope and peace.\r\n\r\nI expect to hear from his lips words of manly trust and confidence in\r\nthe Union, and of concession, kindness to all its constituent parts. I\r\nhave hoped that, in response to what he shall say, I shall hear from\r\nevery part of what is now acknowledged everywhere yet as our\r\nConfederacy, a perpetual hymn of hope and praise rising from all parts\r\nof the Union; and, above all things else, I have hope and trust in\r\ntime and patience. Therefore it is that I shall do no harm.\r\n\r\nI know that there are very excited feelings upon this subject North\r\nand South. I understand that Massachusetts, an honored State--let me\r\nsay, to qualify what I am going to say, first, that I believe that\r\nMassachusetts is the pattern of a community in the world; as well\r\nrepresented here as any State can be; representing herself better than\r\nanybody else can do it for her--I know that there are excited feelings\r\nin Massachusetts, and I think she has good cause. The act that more\r\nthan any other else, perhaps, leads to this proposition of a Peace\r\nConvention--that \"Congress shall provide by law for securing to the\r\ncitizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States\"--was an act which I abhorred and condemned from\r\nthe beginning, and which I am not sorry to perceive that\r\nMassachusetts remembers now. Many gentlemen on the floor know to what\r\nI allude. On the other hand, South Carolina and Louisiana are\r\nferocious for disunion; and I am afraid that their young men do want\r\nwar. There is not excitement enough on the plantation and the farm,\r\nand in the streets of the towns; but they really want contest,\r\nexcitement, and bloodshed. What they want I do not; I am trying to\r\nkeep from it. I do not apprehend, therefore, that the sentiments which\r\nI have expressed here to-day will meet the approbation of the extreme\r\nmen upon either side. I have no doubt my republicanism may be doubted.\r\nI think I can see in the look of my friend on my left now [Mr. KING]\r\nthat he has various convictions that I am very far from being sound in\r\nthe faith. [Laughter.] Sir, it may be. I come from the midst of a\r\npeople not directly concerned in this controversy; a population about\r\nhalf northern, half southern. We have intermarried together. Our\r\ninterests, our fears, our hopes, our recollections, are mingled North\r\nand South; and I believe I am expressing their opinions--which perhaps\r\nform my own--when I say that I can see no possible harm to anybody\r\nanywhere in submitting these propositions to the people, who are, and\r\nought to be, sovereign.\r\n\r\nBesides, sir, what else can I do? As I sit down, let me ask Senators\r\nupon every side, what else can any of us do? Shall we sit here for\r\nthree months, when petition, resolution, public meeting, speech,\r\nacclamation, tumult, is heard, seen, and felt on every side, and do\r\nnothing? Shall State after State go out, and not warn us of danger?\r\nShall Senators and Representatives, patriotic, eloquent, venerable,\r\ntell us, again and again, of danger in their States, and we condescend\r\nto make no reply?\r\n\r\nSir, there is other business to be done here besides the mere ordinary\r\nbusiness of the Government; besides the voting of supplies, and the\r\nraising of means by which to buy them. We have questions here to-day,\r\nas I believe, of peace and war, and I have waited long to see some\r\nmode of their solution. I repeat, I go for this proposition, and agree\r\nto submit it to the vote of the people, not because I believe it the\r\nbest that can be done. I believe, however, that, to-day being two days\r\nfrom the close of this session, it is all I can do. When my people ask\r\nme, on my return, \"Sir, have not States gone out?\" I will say, \"Yes.\"\r\n\"Do not more threaten it?\" if that is the word (I trust it is not the\r\nbest one), I say, \"Yes.\" They say, \"Sir, do you believe they will do\r\nit?\" \"On my honor and on my conscience,\" I say, \"if something is not\r\ndone, yes.\" They then ask, \"What have you done?\" Mr. President, what\r\nhave we done? I believe that is the question the country will ask of\r\nus; and I, for one, will vote for this proposition, that I may be able\r\nto respond.\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--Mr. President, I regard the consideration of this question\r\nas one of the most important which has ever been presented to the\r\nSenate since I have been a member of it. The Union is in danger; the\r\nfate of the country is at stake; and whatever the Senate or the House\r\nof Representatives or Congress combined can do, ought to be done to\r\nsave the country. I have very little faith or hope, and I would\r\nexpress the reason why. But as little as there is, I will cling to the\r\nlast remaining straw, and sink with it grasped fast in my hands, if I\r\nhave no other resource. This country is of too much importance to me,\r\nto my family, to my friends, to my State, to my associates everywhere,\r\nto give up without a struggle. That struggle may prove to be\r\nfruitless; it may prove to be unavailing. The taunts and jeers thrown\r\nout are calculated to stir up ire and ill-feeling; I shall pass them\r\nby with disregard. I choose to sacrifice my feelings, and to make\r\nmyself a burnt-offering on the altar, if I can do any thing to save\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall we do? These propositions, presented by what is\r\ncalled the Peace Conference, are not to be compared to the\r\npropositions of the Senator from Kentucky; and I will not vote for a\r\nsingle one of them, while I will vote for his. They amount to a\r\nsacrifice of my honor, and a destruction of the rights of my State. I\r\nam permitted to say that the representatives from my State in the\r\nPeace Conference condemned them all, while they are willing to go for\r\nthe proposition of the Senator from Kentucky. We cannot stand by this,\r\nand we will not.\r\n\r\nLet us not deceive each other; let us not undertake to practice a\r\nsystem of deception which will sound pleasant to the ear, but will be\r\nbitter to the taste. I will not do it. Here is a positive prohibition\r\nof slavery north of 36° 30´, and then a doubtful question whether it\r\nis recognized south of 36° 30´. The Senator from Kentucky thinks it\r\nis; but I will not act upon a doubt. We have had too many doubts\r\nheretofore, and out of those doubts have grown many difficulties. I\r\nshall never permit, so far as my action is concerned, another question\r\nof doubt.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Will the gentleman allow me to interrupt him? Did he\r\nunderstand me as admitting that it was a doubtful recognition of\r\nslavery?\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--Not at all. I said expressly that the Senator from\r\nKentucky contended that it did amount to a recognition, but others\r\ndenied it, and that made it a question of doubt. I will not\r\nmisrepresent anybody if I know it. Now, sir, I will not act upon a\r\nquestion which admits of doubt. We have passed along in our career for\r\nso many years that we have arrived at a point when we must understand\r\neach other distinctly and unequivocally, and I will not leave a single\r\npoint open to equivocation. It must be expressly settled, and settled\r\nnot only in express words, not only in unmistakable language; but I go\r\nfurther than that; it must emanate from the hearts of a people\r\ndisposed to stand by it; and if they will not stand by it, I will not\r\nassociate with them.\r\n\r\nI want to preserve this Union; I want to maintain the constitutional\r\nrights of all classes, North and South; but to give me a mere written\r\nguarantee on parchment, and file it in the office of the Secretary of\r\nState, with a predetermination in the hearts and minds of the northern\r\npeople inculcated and instructed to violate it, I cannot live with,\r\nand I will not. I would rather go where I naturally belong, with\r\nsouthern men; but if the true-hearted, the patriotic, and the\r\nhonorable portion of the North will reverse this inculcated spirit of\r\nhostility to southern institutions, and bring them up to the mark\r\nwhere they will recognize constitutional guarantees, then I say,\r\n\"Hail, thou my brother, we can go together;\" but never till that comes\r\nto pass. We have approached that period in our country's history when\r\nthere should be no cheating or attempt to cheat. We must understand\r\neach other, and make a permanent, lasting Union, or a permanent,\r\nlasting, peaceful separation.\r\n\r\nThis proposition presented by the Peace Conference, as it is called, I\r\nthink the merest twaddle--and I use the term with entire respect to\r\nthe members--the merest twaddle that ever was presented to a thinking\r\npeople. The proposition of the Senator from Kentucky has some sense in\r\nit. If he chooses to desert his own, I shall not complain of him; for\r\nI know that warm, patriotic impulses move him in all his action; but I\r\ncannot accept the other, and I shall vote against every one of its\r\nprovisions. When it is said to me that the territory south of 36° 30´\r\nhas adopted slavery--that New Mexico has--I must reply to Senators\r\nthat they misunderstand the law. New Mexico has never adopted slavery.\r\nNew Mexico has done this: she has provided remedies for redress of\r\nwrongs, including wrongs affecting slave property; but she has never\r\nestablished slavery; nor has Utah. Utah has never even recognized it\r\nby implication. Utah passed a law of this character: apprentices bound\r\nto service for a period of years may be held there; but when their\r\nservitude has expired, according to their articles of apprenticeship,\r\nthey are free; so that the law of Utah absolutely, if it has any\r\neffect, prohibits slavery.\r\n\r\nSenators overlook these facts. I take the broad and the bold and the\r\nunmistakable ground, not that the Constitution establishes slavery\r\nanywhere, but that the Constitution, extending over a Territory, will\r\nprotect me in all my rights not prohibited by a local competent\r\nauthority; that my rights are to take any property which I own in any\r\npart of the Union, Yankee clocks from the North, polar bears from the\r\nRocky Mountains, mules from the Middle States, and slaves from the\r\nSouth; and that, unless there is a competent local authority to\r\nprohibit my rights in these respective classes of property, I am to be\r\nprotected. The second step is that there can be no local authority as\r\nlong as the territorial condition remains, competent to prohibit\r\nslavery in any Territory.\r\n\r\nThese are my positions; and hence, so far from this extraordinary\r\nposition that slavery is local being true, the reverse is true. It may\r\nbe local in the United States, but so far from its being local to the\r\nTerritory in the United States, the reverse is true. Talk about\r\nfreedom being national, and slavery local! I have a right to pass\r\nthrough Pennsylvania, and my right of transit is as perfect this day\r\nas it was when Pennsylvania was a slave State....\r\n\r\nI have been anxious from the beginning of this session to stave off\r\npublic action, to hold the public pulse still, and give an opportunity\r\nfor reaction of northern sentiment. I want no reaction south. It has\r\nbeen my only hope, and my last hope, and that hope has failed....\r\n\r\nThese resolutions are intended to lull old Virginia, Maryland,\r\nMissouri, and Kentucky, until we are hand-cuffed and tied fast, and\r\nthen action is to commence. They are all designed simply to lull us\r\ninto a fancied security; but if we are wise betimes, and look forward\r\nto coming events, we will at once strike the blow, and separate from a\r\nConfederation which denies us peace, denies us protection, denies us\r\nour constitutional rights, and seek them in some other association of\r\nStates....\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, I want all these propositions voted down, and I\r\nhope my friend from Kentucky will revive his propositions and bring\r\nthem up again. There is some vitality in them; there is some point in\r\nthem; but as for these wishy-washy resolutions, that amount to\r\nnothing, it is impossible that any Senator here will, for a moment,\r\nentertain the idea of supporting them. The Peace Conference! And the\r\nsmallest peace that ever I have heard of. Let the Senator adhere to\r\nhis original propositions; let the Senator bring them up and press\r\nthem upon the attention of the Senate. That is as far backing down as\r\nI will go. It is a little more than I want; but still, as a last\r\neffort to save the Union, I would go that far. Talk about these\r\nmeasures! These measures that have no vitality--these measures that\r\namount to a total surrender of every principle--I never will vote for;\r\nand let the consequences of the future be what they may, I stake my\r\nfaith and reputation upon the vote I intend to cast.\r\n\r\nMr. WADE:--I move that the Senate adjourn.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE:--I hope the Senator will give me the floor before he makes\r\nthat motion.\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--I ask the Senator from Oregon to yield to me a moment.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE:--For a motion to adjourn, I will.\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--Yes, sir; I desire the floor with a view to make that\r\nmotion. It is apparent that no good is to come out of the discussion\r\nof the proceedings of this Peace Conference. It is a proposition got\r\nup for the purpose of satisfying the Border States; and the Border\r\nStates, Missouri and Virginia, say they will have none of it. The\r\nfirst section is a proposition establishing slavery--\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I rise to a question of order.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Senator from Illinois will pause. The\r\nSenator from Virginia rises to a question of order, which he will\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--I understand the motion to adjourn has been made.\r\n\r\nMr. TRUMBULL:--I have not made the motion yet. I stated that I would\r\nmake that motion, and I was merely going to give the reason. The\r\nSenator from Oregon will have the floor to-morrow. I was stating the\r\nreason why I should make the motion to adjourn, which I intend to make\r\nin the course of a minute, and I merely made that statement to show\r\nthat there was no object in sitting here and punishing ourselves in\r\nregard to resolutions which manifestly cannot command the assent of\r\nthis body. I now move that the Senate adjourn.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I call for the yeas and nays on that motion.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nAnd the Senate refused to adjourn, and, for special business, the\r\npeace propositions were set aside. The same day they were introduced,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nMr. LANE:--Mr. President, my object in getting the floor, was to give\r\nthe reason why I cannot vote for the resolution now before the Senate.\r\nYou are aware, sir, that I did vote for the propositions of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky to amend the Constitution, with the hope, if\r\nthey could be adopted, that peace, perhaps, might be restored to the\r\ncountry; but those propositions have been superseded, and the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky himself says that he is willing to sacrifice, on the\r\naltar of his country, as he terms it, his own propositions, and take\r\nthe amendments which are proposed to the Constitution presented by the\r\nPeace Congress to the Senate. The resolutions proposed by the\r\ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky were as low down as I could go.\r\nThey did not secure to every State that right they have under the\r\nConstitution, as I understand it; but the resolution now before the\r\nSenate, to speak modestly, as I look at it, with all due respect to\r\nthe great men who met here to consider this matter, who deliberated\r\nfor many days, and presented this as the result of their\r\ndeliberations, is a cheat, a deception, a humbug--nothing that any\r\nState can take as a final settlement of the questions that are now\r\ngiving trouble to this country, nothing that can settle permanently\r\nthose difficulties. We must have something more definite, something\r\nmore certain, or there can be no Union even of the States that now\r\nremain in the Union, as I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--Mr. President--\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Does the Senator from Oregon give way?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE:--Only for an adjournment.\r\n\r\nMr. GREEN:--I rise to make that motion, that the Senate do now\r\nadjourn.\r\n\r\nSo the motion was agreed to; and the Senate by a vote--23 to\r\n22--adjourned.\r\n\r\n_March 2d._--Senator LANE having secured the floor, made the following\r\nspeech on the report of the Peace Conference:\r\n\r\nMr. LANE:--Mr. President, I hope I shall be permitted to proceed\r\nwithout interruption, and I trust not to consume much time. While I\r\nhad the floor yesterday, I stated some of my objections to the\r\nproposed amendments to the Constitution which are now before us. They\r\nare: that they do not do justice to the whole country--that they do\r\nnot do justice to all the States. I have always held that the\r\nterritory is common property; that it belongs to all the States; that\r\nevery citizen of every State has an equal right to emigrate to, and\r\nsettle in, the common Territories; and that any species of property,\r\nrecognized as such in any State of the Confederacy, should have a like\r\nrecognition in the Territories, and be guaranteed, protected, and\r\nsecured in its full integrity, to the owner thereof. That this should\r\nbe so, was the intent of the revolutionary fathers who shaped and\r\nframed the Constitution; and it was this principle, more, perhaps,\r\nthan any other, which called into being that noble compact, which has\r\nso long been a bond of Union and goodness between all the States. It\r\nis the very life-blood and vitality of the Constitution. It is the\r\nligament that has held us together heretofore, and which, if cut now,\r\nwill result only in hopeless and immutable disruption. I have never\r\ndeviated a single iota from this correct doctrine. Had we lived up to\r\nthis equitable principle--the foundation upon which the Constitution\r\nrests, upon which only this Union can be maintained--we should have\r\nhad no trouble in this country to-day. It is not my fault that trouble\r\nand dissatisfaction prevail; it is not my fault that secession has\r\ntaken place, and that further secession will take place, unless\r\nCongress shall recognize this great principle of justice, of right,\r\nand of equality. That is the doctrine upon which this Union rests; and\r\nit must be maintained, or the connection will be severed.\r\n\r\nWhile upon this question, Mr. President, I may be permitted to allude\r\nto my course in the Senate last session, and I shall do so very\r\nbriefly, upon a series of resolutions introduced by the Senator from\r\nMississippi [Mr. DAVIS]--a series of resolutions that were considered\r\nin this body, after having been previously maturely and deliberately\r\nadopted by a caucus composed of the Democratic Senators, and agreed\r\nupon by them, as setting forth the principles necessary to be\r\nmaintained in order to secure the existence and perpetuity of this\r\nConfederacy. It has been charged upon this floor that, on the 25th day\r\nof May last, I voted against the right of protection to slave property\r\nin the Territories. In order that the Senate may know how I voted, and\r\nthat I may show you and every other man that I stood then as I stand\r\nto-day, and as I have always stood upon this question, I will read\r\nsome short extracts from the discussion upon this series of\r\nresolutions. The fourth resolution was in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That neither Congress nor a Territorial\r\n     Legislature, whether by direct legislation or legislation of\r\n     an indirect and unfriendly nature, possesses the power to\r\n     annul or impair the constitutional right of any citizen of\r\n     the United States to take his slave property into the common\r\n     Territories, but it is the duty of the Federal Government\r\n     there to afford for that, as for other species of property,\r\n     the needful protection; and if experience should at any time\r\n     prove that the judiciary does not possess power to insure\r\n     adequate protection, it will then become the duty of\r\n     Congress to supply such deficiency.\"\r\n\r\nNow mark! this resolution states that all the property of all the\r\npeople of any State, whether slave or otherwise, has an equal right to\r\nprotection; and if experience should at any time prove that the\r\ncourts had not the power to afford that protection, then it was the\r\nduty of Congress to enact such laws as were necessary to protect every\r\nman in his legal and rightful property, no matter of what description\r\nor characteristic. Sir, not long since, upon this floor, a Senator was\r\nhardy enough to say that I voted against protecting property in\r\nTerritories; and he desired to know what had happened that States\r\nshould be concerned; what had occurred to alarm the States that were\r\nseceding from the Union? I will show you, sir, very briefly, what I\r\nsaid upon that question then; and I will repeat it now, for I have\r\nnever changed my sentiments on this subject. No living man can assert,\r\nand in so doing tell the truth, that I ever uttered a word against the\r\nequality of the States, and their equal right in the common territory\r\nof our common country; and any charge that I voted then to refuse\r\nprotection to property in the territory _is false_. I have always held\r\nthat the territory belonged to all; that it was acquired, as I knew,\r\nat the expense of the Southern States as well as of the Northern; and\r\nupon the battle-fields where I had witnessed the good conduct of\r\nNorthern and Southern troops, I found the soldier from the Southern\r\nStates pouring out his blood as freely, and certainly in very much\r\nlarger quantity--for there were very many more from the Southern\r\nStates who participated in the battles of our country in the war which\r\nresulted in the acquisition of territory, than there were from the\r\nNorthern States. Then, so far as the acquisition is concerned, it is\r\njoint, and it was for the joint benefit of all portions of the\r\ncountry. Consequently, I have held, and I hold now, that the\r\nTerritories should be so appropriated. And when those resolutions were\r\nup last winter, I said what I will now read:\r\n\r\n     \"I only desire to say, in relation to the series of\r\n     resolutions, a portion of which I have already voted in\r\n     favor of, that I shall vote in favor of the rest; for the\r\n     whole of them together meet with my hearty approbation. They\r\n     assert the truth; they assert the great principle that the\r\n     constitutional rights of the States are equal; that the\r\n     States have equal rights in this country under the\r\n     Constitution; and, as I understand it, they must be\r\n     maintained in that equality. These resolutions only assert\r\n     that principle; and I say that it is a misfortune to the\r\n     country, in my opinion, that the principles laid down in\r\n     these resolutions had not been asserted sooner. They ought\r\n     to have been asserted by the Democratic party in plain\r\n     English ten years ago. If they had been, you would have had\r\n     no trouble in this country to-day; the Democratic party\r\n     would have been united and strong, and the equality and\r\n     constitutional rights of the States would have been\r\n     maintained in the territory, and in all other things;\r\n     squatter-sovereignty would not have been heard of, and\r\n     to-day we should be united. It is the fault of the\r\n     Democratic party in dodging truth, in dodging principle, in\r\n     dodging the Constitution itself, that has brought the\r\n     trouble upon the country and the party that is experienced\r\n     to-day.\"\r\n\r\nI believe, if we had asserted and maintained these great truths ten\r\nyears ago, and placed ourselves upon them boldly, as it was our duty\r\nto have done, we would have no trouble in this country to-day; but\r\ninstead of declaring the great truths enunciated in these resolutions,\r\nwe went off upon issues unbecoming the Democratic party. A portion of\r\nour leaders wandered and went astray, and asserted that the people of\r\na Territory had the right to prohibit slavery whenever, in their\r\njudgment, it ought to be prohibited; a power which Congress even does\r\nnot possess, and consequently cannot confer upon a Territorial\r\nLegislature, unless the creature becomes greater than the creator. It\r\nwas this kind of trouble, and this sort of heresy introduced into the\r\nDemocratic party, that has broken it up, and brought the disasters\r\nupon our country which we experience to-day. I say, then, let the\r\nblame fall upon the guilty; I am innocent of it; for I have held but\r\none doctrine upon this question from the beginning to the present\r\nhour, and I shall hold that doctrine to the end. In the speech from\r\nwhich I have already read, I also used the following language:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, it appears to me to be very singular indeed, that any\r\n     man can hold that the territory of this country belongs to a\r\n     portion of the people, and that the people of one portion of\r\n     the Union can go there and enjoy their property, when the\r\n     people of another portion cannot enjoy the right of property\r\n     in that territory--territory common to the whole country;\r\n     territory that was earned or acquired by the common blood\r\n     and common treasure of all; territory that is sustained by\r\n     the common treasure of all; and to say that all shall not\r\n     have an equal right there, is to deny a fact so plain, a\r\n     principle so just, a right so manifest, that I can hardly\r\n     see how any man who professes to be a Democrat can deny it,\r\n     or how he can attempt to embarrass the adoption of the\r\n     correct principles announced in these resolutions. I shall\r\n     therefore vote against all the amendments, and every thing\r\n     that is offered to obstruct their passage, upon the ground\r\n     that they assert justice, that they assert truth, that they\r\n     assert the equality and constitutional rights of all the\r\n     States, which principle must be maintained, or this Union\r\n     cannot be preserved.\"\r\n\r\nThat was my doctrine then, it is the doctrine which I have held and\r\nadvocated for twenty years. It is the doctrine I hold now; and I so\r\nnotified the Senator from Tennessee, who arraigned me here as voting\r\nagainst protecting property, and who did me willful and gross\r\ninjustice in it--for I voted for it and he voted against it. That is\r\nto say, I voted against the resolution introduced by Mr. CLINGMAN,\r\ndeclaring \"that slave property did not need protection in the\r\nTerritories,\" while the Senator from Tennessee voted for it; and when\r\nthe motion was made to reconsider the vote adopting it in lieu of the\r\nfourth resolution of the DAVIS series, I voted to reconsider, and the\r\nSenator from Tennessee voted against it, showing clearly that he was\r\nagainst affording that protection to slave property which the fourth\r\nresolution provided for. Did I not maintain the truth? Was I not\r\nprophetic in the announcement that I made in this Senate Chamber then?\r\nI said, that unless this great principle of justice, of equality, of\r\nthe right of every man to the common territory should be maintained,\r\nthis Union would be broken up. This great principle has not been\r\nmaintained, but the Union has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, to go to the votes. It will be borne in mind, and every\r\nSenator on this floor will bear me out in my statement, that while the\r\nDAVIS resolutions--the series of which I speak--were up, various\r\npropositions were made to amend them, and I voted against all\r\namendments. There are Senators here at this moment who will sustain me\r\nwhen I say that, when in caucus and we had under consideration this\r\nseries of resolutions, I said, and said it boldly and in plain terms,\r\nthat if every man from every Southern State of this Union would come\r\nhere and say, for the sake of peace, if you please, or any other\r\nreason, he was willing to abandon his equality, his right in the\r\ncommon territory, then, if alone, I would stand and protest against\r\nit; protest that he had no right to surrender a constitutional right;\r\nthat none but a coward would do it; that every man had a right in the\r\ncommon territory; that it was his privilege, and he should never\r\nsurrender it with my permission. On the other hand, I said that if\r\nevery Northern man in the Senate Chamber--nay, but even every Northern\r\ncitizen--expressed a desire to surrender his right, his equality, his\r\nprivilege, to go to the common Territories with his property, I should\r\nenter my solemn protest against it, and insist that he had a\r\nconstitutional right to go there, which he should never surrender with\r\nmy consent. Then, how any man could assert that I ever entertained the\r\nopinion that slavery did not need protection from aggression, is to me\r\nthe strangest, falsest thing in nature. I said, as I have shown you,\r\nthat I had voted against all amendments, and would continue to vote\r\nagainst all amendments, or any attempt whatsoever calculated to\r\nobstruct the passage of the resolutions; for they asserted the right\r\nof the people to go to the Territories, asserted the power of the\r\ncourt to protect them in the possession of their property, and that if\r\nthe court failed to protect them, Congress should afford the necessary\r\nauthority to do so.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, allow me to observe, there was a resolution that I never\r\nvoted for, and that no man can charge me with ever having voted for.\r\nSenators will recollect--and whoever has read the proceedings of the\r\nSenate will recollect--that an amendment was offered as a substitute\r\nto the fourth resolution, in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"That the existing condition of the Territories does not\r\n     require the intervention of Congress for the protection of\r\n     property in slaves.\"\r\n\r\nI did not vote for that resolution; but the Senator from Tennessee\r\ndid. That amendment was adopted in lieu of the fourth resolution of\r\nthe series that I have read, which insured protection to slave\r\nproperty in the Territories. It was adopted not entirely by Democratic\r\nvotes; and that there may be no mistake, I will read what the Senator\r\nfrom Massachusetts said when he moved a reconsideration:\r\n\r\n     \"I wish simply to say that I voted for that resolution\r\n     because I believed the condition of the Territories requires\r\n     no such law now or ever, and I do not believe in the\r\n     enactment of any such law; but my friends on this side of\r\n     the Chamber have put that resolution in the series; and for\r\n     myself, I do not wish to be responsible for any portion of\r\n     these resolutions, and I therefore wish the vote to be\r\n     reconsidered.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the language of the Senator from Massachusetts, when he found\r\nthat the Republicans, united with some Democrats, had stricken out the\r\nfourth resolution of the series, and inserted this as a substitute. I\r\nsaid to Mr. WILSON on that occasion:\r\n\r\n     \"I desire merely to tender my thanks to the honorable\r\n     Senator from Massachusetts. The series of resolutions, as\r\n     introduced by the honorable Senator from Mississippi, are\r\n     germane one to the other. They are a declaration of\r\n     principles by the Democratic party. This amendment, as the\r\n     Senator has said correctly, has been fastened on the\r\n     Democratic resolutions by the votes of the Republican\r\n     Senators. I feel grateful, indeed, to the Senator for making\r\n     the motion to reconsider. I hope the vote will be\r\n     reconsidered, and the resolution voted down.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion was put, and on the yeas and nays the vote was\r\nreconsidered. I voted for the reconsideration, and I voted against the\r\namendment when it was adopted as a substitute for the fourth\r\nresolution. Among those who voted in the affirmative for\r\nreconsideration were Messrs. BENJAMIN, BROWN, CHESNUT, CLAY, DAVIS,\r\nFITZPATRICK, GREEN, GWIN, HAMMOND, HARLAN, HUNTER, IVERSON, JOHNSON of\r\nArkansas, and LANE. Among those who voted against it, I find JOHNSON\r\nof Tennessee. I did not vote to continue in the series a resolution\r\nthat refused protection to all the people in the common Territories.\r\nPortions of the Journal have been paraded to show the vote on Mr.\r\nBROWN'S amendment to Mr. CLINGMAN'S amendment. I said, in several\r\nspeeches, that I should vote against all amendments, because the\r\nseries had been considered not only here, but in a caucus composed of\r\nthe Democratic Senators of this body, and we had agreed to take them\r\nas a whole, and to vote them through altogether if we had the strength\r\nto do so. I voted against every proposition to amend. I voted against\r\nMr. BROWN'S, and I voted against Mr. CLINGMAN'S, and I voted against\r\nevery other amendment that was calculated to weaken or embarrass the\r\npassage of the resolutions. Yet I am represented here as having voted\r\nagainst affording protection to slave property in the Territories! I\r\nask again, if any Senator, if any man who can read, can say that the\r\nfourth resolution, for which I did vote and for which I struggled and\r\ncontended, does not declare that slave property shall be protected in\r\nthe common Territories of our country.\r\n\r\nCould any thing be stronger than the fourth resolution? Could any man\r\ndesire a more direct declaration of principles than that? Upon the\r\nyeas and nays I voted for it. I voted against the amendment that was\r\nadopted, and afterwards reconsidered. How, then, can a man arraign me\r\nbefore the country as having said upon oath, on the 25th of May last,\r\nthat slave property should not be protected in the common Territories\r\nwith other property? I have always held that all property should be\r\nprotected, slave as well as other property; that it should have the\r\nsame protection as, and no more protection than any other property.\r\nThat they do not secure all this, is the objection I have to the\r\namendments to the Constitution proposed by the Peace Conference. They\r\nare ambiguous, loose, and deceptive. I do not know that the people can\r\ncomprehend them. There will be no certainty under them; and they\r\nwould, if adopted, result in endless trouble and litigation. I trust\r\nno amendments will ever be made to the Constitution, unless they are\r\nmade upon principles of right, justice, and equality, so that there\r\ncan be no mistake in construing them hereafter. If we amend the\r\nConstitution, let us do it with a view to the peace of the country,\r\nwith a view to the harmony of the country, with a view to the security\r\nof every interest, and of every State in the Union. If we could do\r\nthat, and this day amend the Constitution so as to provide expressly\r\nthat every State should have equal rights in the Territories and\r\nelsewhere within the Union, this Confederacy would last forever, the\r\nStates that have left us would come back, and we should have then a\r\ngreat and a lasting Union indeed. Without it, we never can have a\r\npermanent Union. We must do something that is clearly right, or the\r\nStates that have left us will never return. They never ought to\r\nreturn, unless they can have the right of equality secured to them by\r\nthe Constitution. I claim for my State just that which she is entitled\r\nto, and not a particle more. I would concede to the Southern States,\r\nthat to which they are entitled, and not a particle more. That, they\r\nmust have, or there can be no peace, no union, no harmony, no\r\nsecurity, and no perpetuity of this Confederacy. Such amendments to\r\nthe Constitution, securing these objects and principles, are\r\nindispensable to the maintenance of the Government as it was formed.\r\n\r\nThen why not do right? Why not every southern man ask just that which\r\nhe is entitled to, and no more? He ought to be content with nothing\r\nshort of what he is entitled to; and if he be, he is untrue to his\r\nsection and his constituents; untrue to the people whose servant he\r\nis; and untrue to the institutions of the country; for the country can\r\nexist only upon the triumph of such principles. He who is unwilling to\r\ndeal fairly by the North and the South, is a man who is guilty of\r\nshattering and ruining the Confederacy; destroying the peace and\r\nharmony and success of this great experiment of ours.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in the State of Connecticut the Democracy assert the\r\ncorrect principle, and they charge the trouble in the country to the\r\nright quarter. I stated, on a former occasion, that the Democracy of\r\nold Connecticut would never join the Republican party in any attempt\r\nto coerce the Southern States; and I am now authorized by their own\r\ndeclaration to say again, what I said before, that they, like the\r\nDemocracy of Oregon and of every other Northern State, will never join\r\na party that has refused justice; that has refused equality and right;\r\nthat has refused to protect property in the Territories, or wherever\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States extends, in putting down those\r\nwho contended for their rights and for the equality to which they were\r\nentitled. Sir, the loyal Democracy of this country fully understand\r\nthe question, and they assert the right.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, these great principles were not carried out. The platform on\r\nwhich the Democracy presented their candidates for President and\r\nVice-President was not heeded, though based upon the Constitution. I\r\nwill say to the Senator who has boasted of his efforts in Tennessee in\r\nbehalf of the BRECKINRIDGE ticket, that I shall notice that hereafter;\r\nbut I have only to say now, that, for the sake of the country, I would\r\nto God the ticket had succeeded. We should then have had those\r\nprinciples endorsed upon which the Government is established, and the\r\ncountry would have been at peace. For that alone I wished it to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nI will say only a word, now, as to the amendments proposed to the\r\nConstitution. I had the pleasure of listening, yesterday, to the\r\ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. I know his patriotism and his\r\ndevotion to the Union. I know his willingness to take any thing,\r\nhowever small, however trifling, however little it might be, that\r\nwould, in his opinion, give peace to the country. Sir, I am actuated\r\nby no such feeling. We should never compromise principle nor sacrifice\r\nthe eternal foundations of justice. Whenever the Democratic party\r\ncompromised principle it laid the foundation of future troubles for\r\nitself and for the country. When we do, then, amend the Constitution,\r\nit ought to be in the spirit of right and justice to all men and to\r\nall sections. I voted for the Senator's propositions, and I will do so\r\nagain, if we can get a vote, because there is something in them;\r\nsomething that I could stand by; but there is nothing in the\r\namendments proposed by the Peace Conference. He proposed to establish\r\nthe line of 36° 30´, and to prohibit slavery north of it and protect\r\nit south of it, in all the present territory, or of the territory to\r\nbe hereafter acquired. In that proposition there was something like\r\njustice and right; but there is nothing in the amendments proposed by\r\nthe Peace Conference that any man, North or South, ought to take. They\r\nare a cheat; they are a deception; they are a fraud; they hold out a\r\nfalse idea; and I think, with all due respect to the Senator--for I\r\nhave the highest regard for him personally--that he is too anxious to\r\nheal the trouble that exists in the country. He had better place\r\nhimself upon the right and stand by it. Let him contend, with me, for\r\nthe inalienable and constitutional rights of every American citizen.\r\nLet him beware of \"compromising\" away the vital rights, privileges,\r\nand immunities of one portion of the country to appease the graceless,\r\nunrelenting, and hostile fanaticism of another portion. Let him labor\r\nwith me, to influence every State to mind its own affairs, and to keep\r\nthe Territories entirely _free_ to the enterprise of all, with equal\r\nsecurity and protection--without invidious distinctions--to the\r\nproperty of every citizen. Thus, and only thus, can we have peace,\r\nhappiness, and eternal Union.\r\n\r\nI could not avoid noticing the anxiety of the Senator from Kentucky to\r\naccept any thing, and the readiness of the Senator from Oregon to\r\npledge his people--\"my people\"--to any thing that he chooses. Now, I\r\nknow there are many free people in the State of Oregon. They generally\r\ndo as they please. They have no master. No man owns them; and no man\r\ncan claim to control them. But this I am warranted in asserting--for I\r\nknow long, well, and intimately, the gallant men of Oregon--that they\r\nwill not be found ready or inclined, at the Senator's and his masters\r\nbeck, to imbrue their hands, in a godless cause, in fraternal gore.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the principles asserted in the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Senate, last winter, have not been carried out. We see the\r\nconsequences. We see a dissevered country and a divided Union. A\r\nnumber of the States have gone off, have formed an independent\r\nGovernment; it is in existence, and the States composing it will never\r\ncome back to you, unless you say in plain English, in your amendments\r\nto the Constitution, that every State in the future Union has an equal\r\nright to the Territories and all the protection and blessings of this\r\nGovernment--never! I tell you, sir, although some foolish men and some\r\nwicked ones may say I am a disunionist, I am for the Union upon the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, and not a traitor. None but a coward\r\nwill even think me a traitor; and if anybody thinks I am, let him test\r\nme. This Union could exist upon the principles that I have held and\r\nthat are set forth in the DAVIS resolutions; but upon no other\r\ncondition can it exist. Then, sir, disunion is inevitable. It is not\r\ngoing to stop with the seven States that are out. No, sir; my word for\r\nit, unless you do something more than is proposed in this proposition,\r\nold Virginia will go out too--slothful as she has been, and tardy as\r\nshe seems in appreciating her own interests and her rights, and kind\r\nand generous as she has been in inviting a Peace Congress to agree\r\nupon measures of safety for the Union. The time will come, however,\r\nwhen old Virginia will stand trifling and chicanery no longer. Neither\r\nwill North Carolina suffer it. None of the slave States will endure\r\nit; for they cannot separate one from the other, and they will not.\r\nThey will go out of this Union and into one of their own; forming a\r\ngreat, homogeneous, and glorious Southern Confederacy. It is and it\r\nhas been, Senators, in your power to prevent this; it is and it has\r\nbeen for you to say (you might to-day, as it is the last day, say so),\r\nwhether the Union shall be saved or not. I know, that gallant Old\r\nDominion will never put up with less than her rights; and if she\r\nwould, I should entertain for her contempt. I should feel contempt for\r\nher if she were to ask for any thing more than her rights; and so I\r\nwould if she were to put up with any thing less than her\r\nconstitutional rights. Then, sir, secession has taken place, and it\r\nwill go on unless we do right.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in the remarks which I made on the 19th of December\r\nlast, in reply to the Senator from Tennessee, I took the ground that a\r\nState might rightfully secede from the Union when she could no longer\r\nremain in it on an equal footing with the other States; in other\r\nwords, when her continuance as a member of the Confederacy involved\r\nthe sacrifice of her constitutional rights, safety, and honor. This\r\nright I deduced from the theory of equality of the States, upon which\r\nrests the whole fabric of our unrivalled system of government--unrivalled,\r\nas it came from the hands of its illustrious framers--a model as\r\nperfect, perhaps, as human wisdom could devise, securing to all the\r\nblessings of civil and religious liberty, when rightly understood and\r\nproperly administered; but like all other Governments, and even\r\nChristianity itself, a most dangerous engine of oppression when,\r\nhaving fallen into the hands of persons strangers to its spirit, and\r\nunmindful of the beneficent objects for which it was framed, it is\r\nperverted from its high and noble mission to the base uses of a\r\nselfish or sectional ambition, or a blind and bigoted fanaticism. I\r\nsaid, on that occasion--referring to this fundamental principle of our\r\nGovernment, the equality of the States--that \"as long as this equality\r\nbe maintained the Union will endure, and no longer.\" I might here\r\nundertake to enforce, by argument and the authority of writers on the\r\nnature and purposes of our Government, this, to me, self-evident\r\nproposition. But I deem it unnecessary to consume the time of the\r\nSenate in discussing that branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nI propose, Mr. President, to confine what I have to say in regard to\r\nthe right of secession to the question, Who must judge whether such\r\nright exists, and when it should be exercised? According to the theory\r\nof every despotic Government, of ancient or modern times, there is no\r\nsuch right. A province of an empire, how much soever oppressed, is\r\nheld by the oppressor as an integral part of his dominions. The yoke,\r\nonce fastened on the neck of the subject, is expected, however\r\ngalling, to be worn with patience and entire submission to the\r\ntyrant's will. This is the theory of despotism. What are its fruits?\r\nWe have seen, in modern times, some of the bloodiest struggles\r\nrecorded in history growing out of the assertion by one party, and the\r\ndenial by the other, of this very right. Hungary undertook to \"secede\"\r\nfrom the Austrian empire. Her right to do so was denied. She\r\nconstituted an integral part of the empire--a great \"consolidated\"\r\nnation, as some consider the United States to be. Being an integral\r\npart of the empire, according to the theory of the Austrian\r\nGovernment, she must so remain forever. Austria not having the power\r\nto enforce an acquiescence in this doctrine, Russian legions were\r\ncalled to her aid; and Hungary, on whose gallant struggle for\r\nindependence the liberty-loving people of this country looked with so\r\nmuch admiration and sympathy, soon lay prostrate and bleeding at the\r\ntyrant's feet. You may call this attempt of Hungary to regain her\r\nindependence revolution. That is precisely what Austria called it. I\r\ncall it an effort on her part to peaceably secede--to peaceably\r\ndissolve her connection with a Government which, in her judgment, had\r\nbecome intolerably unjust and oppressive. Her oppressors told her it\r\nwas not her province but theirs, to judge of her alleged grievances;\r\nthat to acknowledge the right of secession would strike a fatal blow\r\nat the integrity of the empire, which could be maintained only by\r\nenforcing the perfect obedience of each and every part.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the recent struggle of the Italian States, an instructive\r\ncommentary on the now mooted questions of secession and coercion.\r\nIndeed, history, through all past ages, is but a record of the efforts\r\nof tyrants to prevent the recognition of the doctrine, that a people\r\ndeeming themselves oppressed might peaceably absolve themselves from\r\nallegiance to their oppressors. When our Government was formed, our\r\nfathers fondly thought that they had made a great improvement on the\r\ndespotic systems of modern Europe. They saw the infinite evil\r\nresulting from coercing the unwilling obedience of a subject to a\r\nGovernment which he abhorred and detested. They accordingly declared\r\nthe great truth, never enunciated until then, that \"Governments derive\r\nall their just power from the consent of the governed.\" A Government\r\nwithout such consent they held to be a tyranny.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, this brings us to the very point in issue. Who is\r\nto determine whether this consent is given or withheld? Must it be\r\ndetermined by the ruler? If so, the proposition just stated is an\r\nabsurdity. Clearly it was the meaning of those who enunciated this\r\ngreat truth, that the subjects of a Government have the right to\r\ndeclare or withhold their consent; otherwise no such right exists.\r\nThey, and they only, must judge whether their rights are protected or\r\nviolated. If protected, every consideration of interest and safety\r\nimpels them to consent to live under a Government which secures the\r\nblessings they desire. If, on the other hand, in their judgment, their\r\nmost sacred rights are violated, interest and honor, and the instinct\r\nof self-preservation, all conspire to impel them to withhold their\r\nconsent; which being withheld, the Government, as far as they are\r\nconcerned, ceases.\r\n\r\nHere I would call the attention of the Senate to the first of the\r\nKentucky resolutions of 1798-'99, written by Mr. JEFFERSON, in which\r\nhe says distinctly, that the parties to a political compact must judge\r\nfor themselves of the mode and measure of redress, when they consider\r\nthe compact violated and their rights invaded:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the several States composing the United\r\n     States of America, are not united on the principle of\r\n     unlimited submission to their General Government; but that\r\n     by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for\r\n     the United States, and of amendments thereto, they\r\n     constituted a General Government for special purposes,\r\n     delegated to that Government certain definite powers,\r\n     reserving, each State to itself, the residuary mass of right\r\n     to their own self-government; and that whensoever the\r\n     General Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are\r\n     unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact\r\n     each State acceded as a State, and is an integral party;\r\n     that this Government, created by this compact, was not made\r\n     the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers\r\n     delegated to itself, since that would have made its\r\n     discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its\r\n     power; but that, as in all other cases of compact among\r\n     parties having no common judge, each party has an equal\r\n     right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the\r\n     mode and measure of redress.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. JEFFERSON asserts that a State aggrieved shall judge not only\r\nof the mode, but the measure of redress. Is this treason? If the\r\nmeasure of redress extends to secession, how can the Senator from\r\nTennessee [Mr. JOHNSON] do less than denounce the great apostle of\r\nliberty--as Mr. JEFFERSON has been called--a traitor?\r\n\r\nNo less clear and explicit on this point, is the language of Mr.\r\nMADISON. Being chairman of a committee to whom the subject was\r\nreferred--the resolutions having been returned by several of the\r\nStates--he says in his report:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears to your committee to be a plain principle,\r\n     founded in common sense, illustrated by common practice, and\r\n     essential to the nature of compacts, that where resort can\r\n     be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the\r\n     parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful judges\r\n     in the last resort, whether the bargain made has been\r\n     pursued or violated. The Constitution of the United States\r\n     was formed by the sanction of the States, given by each in\r\n     its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and\r\n     dignity, as well as to the authority of the Constitution,\r\n     that it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation. The\r\n     States, then, being the parties to the Constitutional\r\n     compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of\r\n     necessity, that there can be no tribunal above their\r\n     authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the\r\n     compact made by them be violated, and consequently that, as\r\n     the parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last\r\n     resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to\r\n     require their interposition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the remarks which I made on the 19th of December last, I referred\r\nto the fact that Virginia, in accepting the Constitution, declared\r\nthat the powers granted under that instrument \"being derived from the\r\npeople of the United States, may be resumed by them whenever the same\r\nshall be perverted to their injury or oppression.\" I referred, also,\r\nto the fact that New York had adopted the Constitution upon the same\r\ncondition and with the same reservation. I may here quote the language\r\nof Mr. WEBSTER, distinctly recognizing the right of the people to\r\nchange their Government whenever their interest or safety require it.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n     \"We see, therefore, from the commencement of the Government\r\n     under which we live, down to this late act of the State of\r\n     New  York\"--\r\n\r\nTo which he had just referred--\r\n\r\n     \"one uniform current of law, of precedent, and of practice,\r\n     all going to establish the point that changes in Government\r\n     are to be brought about by the will of the people, assembled\r\n     under such legislative provisions as may be necessary to\r\n     ascertain that will truly and authentically.\"\r\n\r\nIf the people of a State, believing themselves oppressed, undertake to\r\nestablish a Government, independent of that to which they formerly\r\nowed allegiance, and the latter interferes with the movement, and\r\nemploys force to prevent such a consummation, no one who acknowledges\r\nthe great truth that the basis of all free government is the \"consent\r\nof the governed,\" will deny that such interference is an act of\r\nusurpation and tyranny. Those only who borrow their ideas of political\r\njustice from the despotic codes of Europe, and are more imbued with\r\nthe spirit of METTERNICH and BOMBA than of JEFFERSON and MADISON, will\r\nattempt to justify, palliate, or excuse such violation of the sacred\r\nrights of the people. I have observed that often the noisiest\r\nchampions of popular rights are the first to trample those rights\r\nunder foot. The word \"freedom\" is continually on the tongues of\r\ngentlemen on the other side of the Chamber; and I believe the Senator\r\nfrom Tennessee has been suspected of a decided leaning to agrarianism,\r\nso zealous has he been in advocating the rights, so entirely devoted\r\nis he to the interests of the \"dear people.\" But now, when the\r\n_people_ of the seceding States have pronounced, in tones of thunder,\r\nthe fiat which absolves them from allegiance to a Government which\r\nthey no longer respect or love, these same gentlemen all lift their\r\nhands in horror, roll up the whites of their eyes, as did old Lord\r\nNORTH many years ago, and exclaim \"Treason!\" \"Treason!\" Then, boiling\r\nwith patriotic rage, they rise up and declare that \"this treason must\r\nbe punished; the laws must be enforced.\" History tells us that this\r\nwas the language of King GEORGE and Lord NORTH when the colonies\r\nrenounced their allegiance to the mother country. The former of these\r\nworthies, we are told, spent much of his life in a state of mental\r\ndarkness--in other words, he was a lunatic. The other received from\r\nnature a narrow intellect, and inherited prejudices common to the\r\naristocracy of that period and of all other periods of the world's\r\nhistory. Their errors were the natural offspring of incapacity and the\r\nfalse teaching received in their youth. While, therefore, we cannot\r\nadmire or approve their conduct, these circumstances incline us more\r\nto sorrow than to anger, disarm our resentment, and dispose us to\r\nforgive what, under other circumstances, would deserve the severest\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nBut what excuse can we find for the peculiar champions of popular\r\nrights in this Chamber; these zealous servants of the people, forever\r\nringing in our ears, \"Let the voice of the people be heard; respect\r\nthe will of the people; _vox populi vox Dei_!\" Sir, I say too, let the\r\nvoice of the people be heard and respected. And I think, for the sake\r\nof consistency with all my past professions as a Democrat, I am bound\r\nto respect the declared will of the sovereign States which, for\r\nreasons satisfactory to themselves, have seceded from the Union and\r\nestablished a separate and independent Government. Whatever the causes\r\nmay have been which impelled them to a separation from the other\r\nStates, I am bound to respect the expression of their sovereign will;\r\nand I heartily reprobate the policy of attempting to thwart that will\r\nunder the pretence of \"punishing treason\" and \"enforcing the laws.\" We\r\nare told that the design is to attempt nothing more than to collect\r\nthe revenue in the ports of the seceded States. To say nothing of the\r\njustice or injustice of the attempt so to do, I ask Senators from the\r\nNorth, and the Senator from Tennessee, _will it pay_? Will it not be a\r\ndeclaration of war against the seceding States, involving the people\r\nof all the States in a long and bloody conflict, ruinous to both\r\nsections? Are their ethics not the ethics of the school-boy pugilist,\r\n\"Knock the chip off my shoulder\"?\r\n\r\nOne of the framers of the Constitution [Mr. MADISON], whose\r\nexpositions of that instrument all classes, all parties, have\r\nheretofore received, and still receive, or pretend to receive, with\r\nprofound deference and respect, has left on record his views of the\r\ninjustice, impracticability, and inefficacy of force as a means of\r\ncoercing States into obedience to Federal authority.\r\n\r\nAmong the statesmen of the Revolution--those who participated in the\r\nformation of our Government--there was no one who had such exalted\r\nnotions of the power and dignity of the Federal Government, as the\r\ngreat HAMILTON. He was a consolidationist. The advocates of coercion\r\nmight naturally expect to obtain \"aid and comfort\" from the recorded\r\ndeclarations of one of his peculiar political faith. But an\r\nexamination of his writings will show, that instead of favoring\r\ncoercion, instead of being the advocate of force, he was the advocate\r\nof leniency and conciliation towards refractory States, and deprecated\r\na resort to force as madness and folly.\r\n\r\nIf the great names of MADISON and HAMILTON have not sufficient weight\r\nto restrain the madness of those who urge a coercive policy against\r\nthe seceding States, then, indeed, I see no escape from that most\r\ndreadful of all calamities which can befall a nation--civil war. If\r\nthose in this Chamber who talk so flippantly of war, had seen, as it\r\nhas been my lot to see, some of its actual horrors, they might,\r\nperhaps, heed the warnings and respect the counsels of the sages and\r\npatriots whose language I have quoted. They would at least refrain\r\nfrom ungenerous insinuations against the patriotism of those northern\r\nDemocrats, who, like myself, reprobate the policy of coercion as\r\ndestructive of the peace, the prosperity, and happiness of every part\r\nof the country, north as well as south.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee. In the\r\npamphlet report of his speech, page 7, JEFFERSON is quoted; but the\r\nconcluding part of the quotation is repeated in the _Globe_ report and\r\nnot in that of the pamphlet. That part is:\r\n\r\n     \"When two parties make a compact, there results to each a\r\n     power of compelling the other to execute it.\"\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON is here quoted to show that the Confederation has a power to\r\nenforce its articles on delinquent States. But the citation is\r\nunfortunate for the Senator from Tennessee. He had just previously\r\nasserted that Vermont and other States had, by personal liberty bills,\r\nviolated the Constitution. Well; can he tell us how Virginia and South\r\nCarolina could enforce the Constitution on Vermont in that respect? It\r\ncannot be done. What follows? Why, as Mr. WEBSTER said at Capon\r\nSprings, \"a compact broken by one party is broken as to all.\" Hence,\r\naccording to the doctrines of JEFFERSON and WEBSTER as to the actual\r\ncase which, according to the Senator, has occurred, the compact having\r\nbeen broken, the Southern States have a right to retire--are absolved\r\nfrom further obligations under the constitutional compact.\r\n\r\nThe Senator complains that I replied at all, as I was a northern\r\nSenator, and a Democrat whom he had supported at the last election for\r\na high office. Now, I was, as I stated at the time, surprised at the\r\nSenator's speech--because I understood it to be for coercion, as I\r\nthink it was by almost everybody else, except, as we are now told, by\r\nthe Senator himself; and I still think it amounted to a coercion\r\nspeech, notwithstanding the soft and plausible phrases by which he\r\ndescribes it--a speech for the execution of the laws and the\r\nprotection of the Federal property. Sir, if there is, as I contend,\r\nthe right of secession, then, whenever a State exercises that right,\r\nthis Government has no laws in that State to execute, nor has it any\r\nproperty in any such State that can be protected by the power of this\r\nGovernment. In attempting, however, to substitute the smooth phrases\r\nof \"executing the laws\" and \"protecting public property\" for coercion,\r\nfor civil war, we have an important concession, _i.e._, that this\r\nGovernment dare not go before the people with a plain avowal of its\r\nreal purposes, and of their consequences. No, sir; the policy is to\r\ninveigle the people of the North into civil war, by masking the design\r\nin smooth and ambiguous terms.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, I want it distinctly understood, as I have already shown,\r\nthat during the last session I stood firmly by the DAVIS resolutions.\r\nI voted against every amendment. I voted against an amendment that he\r\nvoted for, because I believed it was partial, and did not do justice.\r\n\r\nBut the Senator from Tennessee proceeded with an air and tone of great\r\ntriumph to bring forward my vote on the amendments proposed to the\r\nDAVIS resolutions. I think I have said all that it is necessary for me\r\nto say upon that subject. I have shown that I have voted for them\r\nunder all circumstances, and against every amendment. Those\r\nresolutions assert the right of property in the Territories, and that\r\nwhen the courts fail to afford protection, then it is the duty of\r\nCongress to come forward and provide that protection. I wished to put\r\nslave property upon the same footing as other property. That is where\r\nI then stood, where I now stand, and where I intend to stand. The\r\nSenator asks, with a kind of triumphant air, what has happened since\r\nthat day? Mr. President, I have said that I have done all in my power,\r\nby standing firm to the resolutions agreed to by the Democratic party,\r\nto afford protection. The Senator misrepresented my vote on those\r\nresolutions. I never voted against the DAVIS resolutions, nor did\r\ntheir substitute ever come up as a separate proposition. It was an\r\namendment to one of that series of resolutions I voted against; and I\r\nwould vote against any thing and every thing that would embarrass\r\ntheir passage, for they contained just what I thought was right.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened since? Why, a thing has happened that never happened\r\nbefore. The denial of any and all protection to slave property in any\r\nand in all the territory; the denial of the right to take slave\r\nproperty to any of them has been proclaimed and affirmed at the\r\nballot-box by a majority of the States, and a majority of the\r\nelectoral votes of this Union. What has happened? Why, the thing has\r\nhappened that has been three times before attempted, and three times\r\nbefore failed; the first attempt having endangered the formation of\r\nthe Union, and the second and third its continuance. The first attempt\r\nwas made in 1784, to exclude slavery from all the Territories. It was\r\nabandoned in 1787 by excluding it only from the territory northwest of\r\nthe Ohio, leaving it to colonize that portion southwest of that river.\r\nThe same thing was again attempted in 1820, as to the territory\r\nacquired from Louisiana; and after a terrible agitation, was abandoned\r\nby adopting the Missouri line. The third attempt was made in 1850, as\r\nto the territory acquired from Mexico; and then also the Union\r\nnarrowly escaped destruction; but the compromise measures were\r\nadopted. And now it comes again, but in a more formidable way than\r\never. A President has been elected on that issue; for the first time\r\nthe people of the North, after all previous compromises and warnings,\r\nhave voted on the question, and every Northern State has pronounced\r\nfor the spoliation.\r\n\r\nMr. President, perhaps the most signal instance of the evils of\r\ncompulsory union between dissimilar people, is that of Ireland and\r\nEngland. The people of Ireland--the home and heritage of my\r\nancestors--have, as the South has, a representation in the national\r\nLegislature; but being also, as the South is, in a minority in that\r\nbody, have no power to protect themselves from the aggressions of\r\nEngland. The consequence is, that they have been excluded from the\r\ncommon benefits of British legislation, commercially, and even\r\nreligiously, to say nothing of their exclusion from official station\r\nin the empire. And, accordingly, Ireland has been impoverished,\r\ndegraded, and discontented. She has been trampled upon, outraged,\r\ninsulted, treated like Cinderella. The people of this country have\r\nalways sympathized with the wrongs of Ireland, and her struggles for\r\nindependence. Yet there is now a greater difference between the people\r\nof the South and of the North than between those of England and\r\nIreland, and greater antagonism of opinion and feeling. Nevertheless,\r\nit is proposed to hold the South in political subjection to the North,\r\nand for that purpose to employ naval and military force.\r\n\r\nSir, I might mention many other cases: the subjection of Greece to\r\nTurkey; of Poland to Russia; of the Netherlands to Spain; Italy to\r\nAustria. In all these cases we have sympathized with, and, in many of\r\nthem aided, the secession from the common government, by contributions\r\nand individual service. Yet those Governments were not founded on\r\nconsent, and there was no compact conceding the right of secession.\r\n\r\nSir, in conclusion, whether the course the seceding States have seen\r\nfit to take be right or not, is a question which we must leave to\r\nposterity, and the verdict of impartial history. Our time will\r\nprobably be more profitably employed in considering how we shall deal\r\nwith secession than in discussing the causes which have produced it.\r\nSecession, right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable, is an\r\naccomplished fact; and it presents to us no less an alternative than\r\nthat of peace or war. Sir, I believe that, in the general ruin which\r\nwould follow coercive measures against the seceding states, all\r\nsections, all classes, all the great interests of the country,\r\nwithout any exception, would be involved. How much better, Mr.\r\nPresident, that, in so fearful a crisis as the present, instead of\r\npassing \"force bills,\" and preparing for war, instead of \"breathing\r\nthreatenings and slaughter,\" and preparing implements of destruction\r\nto be used against our brethren of the South, how much better, I say,\r\nfor ourselves, for posterity, for the cause of civil liberty\r\nthroughout the world, that our thoughts should be turned on peace?\r\nPeace, not war, has brought our country to the high degree of\r\nprosperity it now enjoys. The energies of the people up to this time\r\nhave been directed to the development of our boundless resources, to\r\nthe mechanic arts, to agriculture, mining, trade, and commerce with\r\nforeign nations. Banish peace, turn these mighty energies of the\r\npeople to the prosecution of the dreadful work of mutual destruction,\r\nand soon cities in ruins, fields desolate, the deserted marts of\r\ntrade, the silent workshops, gaunt famine stalking through the land,\r\nthe earth cumbered with the bodies of the dying and the dead, will\r\nbear awful testimony to the madness and wickedness which, from the\r\nvery summit of prosperity and happiness, are plunging us headlong into\r\nan abyss of woe.\r\n\r\nSir, in God's name, let us have peace! If we cannot have it in the\r\nUnion, as it existed prior to November last, let us have it by\r\ncultivating friendly relations with those States which have dissolved\r\ntheir connection with that Union, and established a separate\r\ngovernment. Though we and they may not, and, perhaps, in the nature of\r\nthings, cannot live harmoniously under the same Government, it is our\r\ninterest, no less than theirs, that we should at once endeavor to\r\nestablish between our Government and theirs those amicable relations\r\nwhich should ever exist between two neighboring Republics. War, with\r\nits attendant horrors, being thus happily averted, the people of each\r\nRepublic will be left at liberty to pursue, undisturbed, their several\r\nvocations. A mutually advantageous commerce will grow up between the\r\ntwo nations; treaties, such as regulate our intercourse with the\r\nCanadas, will be formed; confidence in all branches of business will\r\nbe restored; a new impetus given to every variety of industry; the\r\nmarch of improvement accelerated, and the cause of humanity, of\r\ncivilization, and of Christianity, advanced throughout the world. The\r\npeople of Europe, accustomed to refer the settlement of their\r\nslightest differences to the bloody arbitrament of the sword, will\r\nbehold with silent wonder and amazement the spectacle of a great\r\npeople unable to agree in reference to one of their peculiar domestic\r\ninstitutions, peacefully separating, as did the patriarchs of old;\r\nresolving themselves into two distinct political communities, not\r\nhostile, discordant, belligerent; but each, animated with a spirit of\r\ngenerous rivalry toward the other, pursuing a more successful and\r\nprosperous career in its own chosen path, than when, united under the\r\nsame Federal head, they painfully sought together the same common\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we are living at a day and at a time when a Northern\r\nsectional party have obtained possession of the power of this great\r\nGovernment, who have declared in their platform, in their speeches\r\neverywhere, and in their press, that slavery shall never go into\r\nanother foot of territory; that no other slave State shall ever be\r\nadmitted into this Union; that slavery shall be put in the course of\r\nultimate extinction. We have the announcement of the party that the\r\nfoot of a slave shall never press the soil of one of the Territories;\r\nthat no new slave State shall be admitted; and, in addition to that,\r\nthat no slave State shall go out of the Union. Who ever saw such a\r\nparty as that? Who ever knew any thing like it in the world before?\r\nThey will not let slavery go into the Territories; they will not let a\r\nslave State come in; and they will not let one go out! They will not\r\nlet them go out because they could not carry out their programme of\r\nplacing slavery in the course of ultimate extinction. They want to\r\nkeep the slave States in for their benefit--to foot the bills, to pay\r\nthe taxes--that they may govern them as they see fit, and rule them\r\nagainst their will. Well, sir, I wish to say one word to that party,\r\nin all kindness; for I shall not trouble them again on this subject. I\r\nshall be a private, independent citizen before long. But I will say to\r\nthat party, they had better change their tactics; they had better\r\nchange front, and do it speedily. Let them place themselves upon the\r\nhigh ground of right and justice, and adopt such amendments to the\r\nConstitution as will not only hold old Kentucky, which has produced\r\nthe greatest \"compromiser\" of us all--that good old State where I was\r\nraised, and that I am proud of--but the other Southern States also. I\r\nam afraid Republicanism will not do this. I know those old Kentucky\r\npeople from terrace to foundation. They will endure much--very\r\nmuch--peaceably and quietly; but if they are goaded too far; if, by\r\nrepeated wrongs, they are compelled to fight, then I would say to\r\ntheir enemy \"beware!\" There are chivalry and patriotism in Kentucky\r\nwhich is neither in the power of accident nor nature to subdue. You\r\nhad better not press them too far. Do not drive them to the goal of\r\nlast resort. Give them justice while you have it in your power to do\r\nso. Satisfy them that ultimately they shall have equality in this\r\nbroken Government, or Union, if you will. But, sir, I leave the\r\npatching up of the Constitution to the distinguished Senator from\r\nKentucky and other gentlemen, especially my friend from Pennsylvania\r\n[Mr. BIGLER], who has labored harder to patch up the Constitution\r\nthan any man I ever knew, except my friend from Kentucky, and I wish\r\nhim God speed in the work. Let it be upon just principles; let it be\r\nright; let us have justice; and I shall be content.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, I have paid all the attention to the attempt that\r\nwas made to place me in the wrong that I deem necessary. I can only\r\nnow repeat, in the conclusion of my speech, that neither the Senator\r\nfrom Tennessee, nor any other Senator, nor can any man, tell the truth\r\nand say that I have, by any vote, word, or act of mine, at any time or\r\non any occasion, refused protection to all property alike in the\r\nTerritories. I have made it a point always. Indeed, the doctrine of\r\nthe equal right of property, whether slave or any other, in the\r\nTerritories, and its equal right to protection, is as strong in me as\r\nlife itself. I have never uttered a word against that principle; but I\r\nhave said, upon all occasions, that that doctrine must be maintained,\r\nor this Union could not stand. I have fought for it; but as I said in\r\nthe outset, while I deeply deplore the condition of the country, it\r\nhas been caused by no act of mine. And with this remark, I part with\r\nhim, who, in imitation of Esau, seeks to sell his birthright. I would,\r\nif there was time, give a little advice to all sides, to every Senator\r\non this floor. I would say: Senators come up to the great importance\r\nof this question; meet it; adopt, by a two-thirds vote--as we could do\r\nif Senators would deal rightly--amendments to the Constitution,\r\nplacing all the States upon an equality in the Territories, and on\r\nevery other question; submit them to the people; and by such\r\namendments I believe we could prevent, or stop, a further rupture of\r\nthis Union.\r\n\r\nIn a reply to the speech of Senator LANE of Oregon, the following\r\nremarks on secession, coercion, the Territorial question, and the\r\nPeace Conference propositions, are furnished by\r\n\r\nSenator JOHNSON, of Tennessee:--Mr. President, it is painful for me to\r\nbe compelled, at this late hour of the session, to occupy any of the\r\ntime of the Senate upon the subject that has just been discussed by\r\nthe Senator from _Oregon_. Had it not been for the extraordinary\r\nspeech he has made, and the singular course he has taken, I should\r\nforbear from saying one word at this late hour of the day and of the\r\nsession. But, sir, it must be apparent, not only to the Senate but to\r\nthe whole country, that, either by accident or by design, there has\r\nbeen an arrangement that any one who appeared in this Senate to\r\nvindicate the Union of these States should be attacked. Why is it that\r\nno one, in the Senate or out of it, who is in favor of the Union of\r\nthese States, has made an attack upon me? Why has it been left to\r\nthose who have taken both open and secret ground in violation of the\r\nConstitution, for the disruption of the Government? Why has there been\r\na concerted attack upon me from the beginning of this discussion to\r\nthe present moment, not even confined to the ordinary courtesies of\r\ndebate and of senatorial decorum? It is a question which lifts itself\r\nabove personalities. I care not from what direction the Senator comes\r\nwho indulges in personalities toward me; in that, I feel that I am\r\nabove him, and that he is my inferior. [Applause in the galleries.]\r\nMr. President, they are not arguments; they are the resort of men\r\nwhose minds are low and coarse. Cowper has well said:\r\n\r\n     \"A truly sensible, well-bred man\r\n     Will not insult me; no other can.\"\r\n\r\nSir, have we reached a point at which we cannot talk about treason?\r\nOur forefathers talked about it; they spoke of it in the Constitution\r\nof the country; they have defined what treason was; is it an offence,\r\nis it a crime, is it an insult to recite the Constitution that was\r\nmade by WASHINGTON and his compatriots? What does the Constitution\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n     \"Treason against the United States shall consist only in\r\n     levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies,\r\n     giving them aid and comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThere it is defined clearly that treason shall consist only in levying\r\nwar against the United States, and adhering to and giving aid and\r\ncomfort to their enemies. Who is it that has been engaged in\r\nconspiracies? Who is it that has been engaged in making war upon the\r\nUnited States? Who is it that has fired upon our flag? Who is it that\r\nhas given instructions to take our arsenals, to take our forts, to\r\ntake our dock-yards, to take the public property? In the language of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, have not those who have been\r\nengaged in it been guilty of treason? We make a fair issue. Show me\r\nwho has been engaged in these conspiracies, who has fired upon our\r\nflag, has given instructions to take our forts and our custom-houses,\r\nour arsenals and our dock-yards, and I will show you a traitor.\r\n[Applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nMr. President, if individuals were pointed out to me who were engaged\r\nin nightly conspiracies, in secret conclaves, and issuing orders\r\ndirecting the capture of our forts and the taking of our\r\ncustom-houses, I would show who were the traitors; and that being\r\ndone, the persons pointed out coming within the purview and scope of\r\nthe provision of the Constitution which I have read, were I the\r\nPresident of the United States, I would do as THOMAS JEFFERSON did, in\r\n1806, with AARON BURR; I would have them arrested, and, if convicted,\r\nwithin the meaning and scope of the Constitution, by the Eternal GOD I\r\nwould execute them. Sir, treason must be punished. Its enormity and\r\nthe extent and depth of the offence must be made known. The time is\r\nnot distant, if this Government is preserved, its Constitution obeyed,\r\nand its laws executed in every department, when something of this kind\r\nmust be done.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Oregon, in his remarks, said that a mind that it\r\nrequired six weeks to stuff could not know much of any thing. He\r\nintimated that I had been stuffed. I made my speech on the 19th of\r\nDecember. The gentleman replied. I made another speech, and now he has\r\nreplied again; and how long has he been \"stuffing\"? How often has he\r\nbeen \"stuffed\"? [Laughter.] He has been stuffed twice; and if the\r\nstuffing operation was as severe and laborious as the delivery has\r\nbeen, he has had a troublesome time of it, for his travail has been\r\ngreat and the delivery remarkable. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nWe know how the Senator stands upon popular or squatter sovereignty.\r\nOn that subject he spoke at Concord, New Hampshire, where he\r\nmaintained that the inhabitants of the Territories were the best\r\njudges; that they were the very people to settle all these questions;\r\nbut when he came here, at the last Congress, he could make a speech in\r\nwhich he repeated, I cannot tell how many times, \"the equality of the\r\nStates, the rights of the States in the Union, and their rights out of\r\nthe Union;\" and he thus shifted his course. If the conflict between\r\nhis speech made in Concord in 1856, and his speech made here on the\r\n25th day of May last, can be reconciled, according to all rules of\r\nconstruction, it is fair to reconcile the conflict. If the discrepancy\r\nis so great between his speech made then and his speech on the 25th of\r\nMay last, of course the discrepancy is against him; but I am willing\r\nto let one speech set off the other, and to make honors easy, so far\r\nas speech-making is concerned.\r\n\r\nThen, how does the matter stand? There is one speech one way, and\r\nthere is another speech the other way. Now, we will come to the\r\nsticking point. You have seen the equivocation to-day. You have seen\r\nthe cuttle fish attempt to becloud the water and elude the grasp of\r\nhis pursuer. I intend to stick to you here to-day, as close and as\r\ntight as what I think I have heard called somewhere \"Jew David's\r\nAdhesive Plaster.\" How does your vote stand as compared with your\r\nspeeches? Your speeches being easy, I shall throw in the scale against\r\nyou the weight of what you swore. How does that matter stand? I intend\r\nto refer to the record. By referring to the record, it will be found\r\nthat Mr. CLINGMAN offered the following as an amendment to the fourth\r\nresolution of the series introduced by Mr. DAVIS:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the existing condition of the Territories\r\n     of the United States does not require the intervention of\r\n     Congress for the protection of property in slaves.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the vote on the amendment proposed to that resolution by Mr.\r\nBROWN, to strike out the word \"not.\" I want the Senator's attention,\r\nfor I am going to stick to him, and if he can get away from me he has\r\ngot to obliterate the records of his country. How would it read, to\r\nstrike out the word \"not.\"\r\n\r\n     \"That the existing condition of the Territories of the\r\n     United States does require the intervention of Congress for\r\n     the protection of property in slaves.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who voted against striking out the word \"not,\" who\r\ndeclared that protection of slavery in the Territories by legislation\r\nof Congress was unnecessary, was the Senator from Oregon. When was\r\nthat? On the 25th day of May last. The Senator, under the oath of his\r\noffice, declared that legislation was not necessary. Now where do we\r\nfind him? Here is a proposition to amend the Constitution, to protect\r\nthe institution of slavery in the States, and here is the proposition\r\nbrought forward by the Peace Conference, and we find the Senator\r\nstanding against the one, and I believe he recorded his vote against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut, let us travel along. We have only applied one side of this\r\nplaster. The Senator voted that it was not necessary to legislate by\r\nCongress for the protection of slave property. Mr. BROWN then offered\r\nthe amendment to the resolution submitted by Mr. DAVIS, to strike out\r\nall after the word \"resolved,\" and to insert in lieu thereof:\r\n\r\n     \"That experience having already shown that the Constitution\r\n     and the common law, unaided by statutory enactment, do not\r\n     afford adequate and sufficient protection to slave\r\n     property--some of the Territories having failed, others\r\n     having refused, to pass such enactments--it has become the\r\n     duty of Congress to interpose, and pass such laws as will\r\n     afford to slave property in the Territories that protection\r\n     which is given to other kinds of property.\"\r\n\r\nWe have heard a great deal said here to-day of \"other kinds,\" and\r\nevery description of property. There is a naked, clear proposition.\r\nMr. BROWN says it is needed; that the court and the common law do not\r\ngive ample protection; and then the Senator from Oregon is called\r\nupon; but what is his vote? We find, in the vote upon this amendment,\r\nthat but three Senators voted for it; and the Senator from Oregon\r\nrecords his vote, and says \"no,\" it shall not be established; and\r\nevery Southern man, save three, voted against it also. When was that?\r\nOn the 25th day of May last. Here is an amendment, now, to protect\r\nand secure the States against any encroachment upon the institution\r\nwithin the States; and there the Senator from Oregon swore that no\r\nfurther legislation was necessary to protect it in the Territories.\r\nWell, his speeches in honors being easy, and he having sworn to it in\r\nthe last Congress, I am inclined to take his oath in preference to his\r\nspeeches, and one is a fair set-off against the other. Then, all the\r\namendments being voted down, the Senate came to the vote upon this\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     \"That if experience should at any time prove that the\r\n     judicial and executive authority do not possess means to\r\n     insure adequate protection to constitutional rights in a\r\n     Territory, and if the territorial government should fail or\r\n     refuse to provide the necessary remedies for that purpose,\r\n     it will be the duty of Congress to supply such deficiency,\r\n     within the limits of its constitutional powers.\"\r\n\r\nDoes not the resolution proceed upon the idea that it was not\r\nnecessary then; but if, hereafter, the Territories should refuse, and\r\nthe courts and the common law could not give ample protection, then it\r\nwould be the duty of Congress to do this thing? What has transpired\r\nsince the 25th day of May last? Is not the decision of the court with\r\nus? Is there not the Constitution carrying it there? Why was not this\r\nresolution, declaring protection necessary, passed during the last\r\nCongress? The Presidential election was on hand.\r\n\r\nI have been held up and indirectly censured, because I have stood by\r\nthe people; because I have advocated those measures that are sometimes\r\ncalled demagogical. I would to GOD that we had a few more men here who\r\nwere for the people in fact, and who would legislate in conformity\r\nwith their will and wishes. If we had, the difficulties and dangers\r\nthat surround us now, would be postponed and set aside; they would not\r\nbe upon us. But in May last, we could not vote that it was necessary\r\nto pass a slave code for the Territories. Oh, no; the Presidential\r\nelection was on hand. We were very willing then to try to get northern\r\nvotes; to secure their influence in the passage of resolutions; and to\r\ncrowd some men down, and let others up. It was all very well then; but\r\nsince the people have determined that somebody else should be\r\nPresident of the United States, all at once the grape has got to be\r\nvery sour, and gentlemen do not have as good an opinion of the people\r\nas they had before; we have changed our views about it. They have not\r\nthought quite as well of us as we desired they should; and if I could\r\nnot get to be President or Vice-President of all these United States,\r\nrather than miss it altogether, I would be perfectly willing to be\r\nPresident of a part; and therefore we will divide--yes, we will\r\ndivide. I am in favor of secession; of breaking up the Union; of\r\nhaving the rights of the States out of the Union; and as I signally\r\nfailed in being President of all, as the people have decided against\r\nme, we have reached that precise point of time at which the Government\r\nought to be broken up. It looks a little that way.\r\n\r\nI have no disposition now, in concluding what little I am going to\r\nsay, to mutilate the dead, or add one single additional pang to the\r\ntortures of the already politically damned. I am a humane man; I will\r\nnot add one pang to the intolerable sufferings of the distinguished\r\nSenator from Oregon. [Laughter.] I sought no controversy with him; I\r\nhave made no issue with him; it has been forced upon me. How many have\r\nattacked me; and is there a single man, North or South, who is in\r\nfavor of this glorious Union, who has dared to make an assault on me?\r\nIs there one? No; not one. But it is all from secession; it is all\r\nfrom that usurpation where a reign of terror has been going on.\r\n\r\nI repeat, again, the Senator has made a set-to on me. I am satisfied\r\nif he is. I am willing that his speech and mine shall go to the\r\ncountry, and let an intelligent people read and understand, and see\r\nwho is right and who is wrong on this great issue.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I alluded to the fact that secession has been brought about\r\nby usurpation. During the last forty days, six States of this\r\nConfederacy have been taken out of the Union; how? By the voice of the\r\npeople? No; it is demagogism to talk of the people. By the voice of\r\nthe freemen of the country? No. By whom has it been done? Have the\r\npeople of South Carolina passed upon the ordinance adopted by their\r\nConvention? No; but a system of usurpation was instituted, and a reign\r\nof terror inaugurated. How was it in Georgia? Have the people there\r\npassed upon the ordinance of secession? No. We know that there was a\r\npowerful party there, of passive, conservative men, who have been\r\noverslaughed, borne down; and tyranny and usurpation have triumphed. A\r\nconvention passed an ordinance to take the State out of the\r\nConfederacy; and the very same convention appointed delegates to go to\r\na congress to make a constitution, without consulting the people. So\r\nwith Louisiana; so with Mississippi; so with all the six States which\r\nhave undertaken to form a new Confederacy. Have the people been\r\nconsulted? Not in a single instance. We are in the habit of saying\r\nthat man is capable of self-government; that he has the right, the\r\nunquestioned right, to govern himself; but here, a government has been\r\nassumed over him; it has been taken out of his hands, and at\r\nMontgomery a set of usurpers are enthroned, legislating, and making\r\nconstitutions and adopting them, without consulting the freemen of the\r\ncountry. Do we not know it to be so? Have the people of Alabama, of\r\nGeorgia, of any of those States, passed upon it? No; but a\r\nConstitution is adopted by those men, with a provision that it may be\r\nchanged by a vote of two-thirds. Four votes in a convention of six,\r\ncan change the whole organic law of a people constituting six States.\r\nIs not this a _coup d'état_ equal to any of Napoleon? Is it not a\r\nusurpation of the people's rights? In some of those States, even our\r\nStars and our Stripes have been changed. One State has a palmetto,\r\nanother has a pelican, and the last that I can enumerate on this\r\noccasion, is one State that has the rattlesnake run up as an emblem.\r\nOn a former occasion I spoke of the origin of secession; and I traced\r\nits early history to the garden of Eden, when the serpent's wile and\r\nthe serpent's wickedness beguiled and betrayed our first mother. After\r\nthat occurred, and they knew light and knowledge, when their Lord and\r\nMaster turned to them, they seceded, and hid themselves from his\r\npresence. The serpent's wile, and the serpent's wickedness, first\r\nstarted secession; and now, secession brings about a return of the\r\nserpent. Yes, sir; the wily serpent, the rattlesnake, has been\r\nsubstituted as the emblem on the flag of one of the seceding States;\r\nand that old flag, the Stars and the Stripes, under which our fathers\r\nfought and bled and conquered, and achieved our rights and our\r\nliberties, is pulled down and trailed in the dust, and the rattlesnake\r\nsubstituted. Will the American people tolerate it? They will be\r\nindulgent; time, I think, is wanted, but they will not submit to it.\r\n\r\nA word more in conclusion. Give the Border States that security which\r\nthey desire, and the time will come when the other States will come\r\nback; when they will be brought back--how? Not by the coercion of the\r\nBorder States, but by the coercion of the people; and those leaders\r\nwho have taken them out will fall beneath the indignation and the\r\naccumulating force of that public opinion which will ultimately crush\r\nthem. The gentlemen who have taken those States out are not the men to\r\nbring them back.\r\n\r\nI have already suggested that the idea may have entered into some\r\nminds, \"if we cannot get to be President and Vice-President of the\r\nwhole United States, we may divide the Government, set up a new\r\nestablishment, have new offices, and monopolize them ourselves when we\r\ntake our States out.\" Here we see a President made, a Vice-President\r\nmade, cabinet officers appointed, and yet the great mass of the people\r\nnot consulted, nor their assent obtained in any manner whatever. The\r\npeople of the country ought to be aroused to this condition of\r\nthings; they ought to buckle on their armor; and, as Tennessee has\r\ndone (GOD bless her!), by the exercise of the elective franchise, by\r\ngoing to the ballot-box under a new set of leaders, they will\r\nrepudiate and put down those men who have carried these States out and\r\nusurped a Government over their heads. I trust in GOD that the old\r\nflag of the Union will never be struck. I hope it may long wave, and\r\nthat we may long hear the national air sung:\r\n\r\n     \"The star-spangled banner, long may it wave,\r\n     O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\"\r\n\r\nLong may we hear old Hail Columbia, that good old national air, played\r\non all our martial instruments! long may we hear, and never repudiate,\r\nthe old tune of Yankee Doodle! Long may wave that gallant old flag\r\nwhich went through the Revolution, and which was borne by Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky at the battle of New Orleans, upon that soil the right to\r\nnavigate the Mississippi near which they are now denied. Upon that\r\nbloody field the Stars and Stripes waved in triumph; and, in the\r\nlanguage of another, the Goddess of Liberty hovered around when \"the\r\nrocket's red glare\" went forth, indicating that the battle was raging,\r\nand watched the issue; and the conflict grew fierce, and the issue was\r\ndoubtful; but when, at length, victory perched upon your Stars and\r\nyour Stripes, it was then, on the plains of New Orleans, that the\r\nGoddess of Liberty made her loftiest flight, and proclaimed victory in\r\nstrains of exultation. Will Tennessee ever desert the grave of him who\r\nbore it in triumph, or desert the flag that he waved with success? No;\r\nwe were in the Union before some of these States were spoken into\r\nexistence; and we intend to remain in, and insist upon--as we have the\r\nconfident belief we shall get--all our constitutional rights and\r\nprotection in the Union, and under the Constitution of the country.\r\n[Applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITCH in the chair):--It will become the\r\nunpleasant but imperative duty of the Chair to clear the galleries.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee:--I have done.\r\n\r\n[The applause was renewed, and was louder and more general than\r\nbefore. Hisses were succeeded by applause, and cheers were given and\r\nreiterated, with \"three cheers more for JOHNSON.\"]\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--The Sergeant-at-Arms will immediately clear\r\nthe galleries, and the order will not be rescinded.\r\n\r\nThe order having been executed by clearing the galleries and locking\r\nthe doors leading to them, the Presiding Officer announced that the\r\nbusiness of the Senate would be proceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, having disposed of several bills, was about to take action\r\non a proposed amendment to the House resolutions, when the Peace\r\nConference amendments were adverted to as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--Now, I desire to say a word. There was a commission from\r\ntwenty or twenty-one States summoned here by the State of Virginia to\r\ntake into consideration the state of the country, and they have\r\nproposed an elaborate amendment to the Constitution, which they ask\r\nthis body, in connection with the other House, to refer to the States.\r\nThat has been under consideration for two days; no vote has been taken\r\nupon it; and the Senator from Illinois now proposes to postpone that\r\nin order to give precedence to a resolution from the House of\r\nRepresentatives proposing to amend the Constitution by prohibiting\r\nCongress from interfering with slavery in the States. His motion is,\r\nat this stage of the session, to put aside any further consideration\r\nof this amendment to the Constitution proposed by that Peace\r\nConference, presented in the impressive manner in which it was done by\r\nthe honorable Senator from Kentucky, in order to give precedence to\r\nthis joint resolution of the House on this the last day of the\r\nsession. Sir, I shall vote against giving it that precedence. I think\r\nit is due not only to those honorable gentlemen who came here and have\r\nsubmitted to us the result of their labors that we should give it that\r\nprecedence, but I feel that it is due to the State of Virginia, who\r\ninvited the Conference, that no precedence should be given over it.\r\nFor that reason, I shall vote against it.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I am glad to find that the Senator from Virginia has\r\nbecome such a warm advocate of the report of the Peace Conference. How\r\nmany hours is it since we heard him denounce it as unworthy the\r\nconsideration of Southern men or of this country? How long is it since\r\nthese denunciations were ringing in our ears? We do not hear the\r\npraises of the Peace Conference sounded until we are about to get a\r\nvote on another proposition to pacify the country; and for fear we may\r\nhave a vote that will quiet the apprehensions of the Southern States\r\nin respect to the designs of the North to change the Constitution, so\r\nas to interfere with slavery in the States, we find now that the Peace\r\nConference is to be pushed forward, to defeat this. Sir, if he is a\r\nfriend of the proposition of the Peace Conference, let him act with me\r\nand sit as long as I will in urging it upon the Senate. I am for both;\r\nbut this one is within our reach. We can close this much in five\r\nminutes. We should have had it passed before this time, if the Senator\r\nfrom Virginia had not interposed objections. If the amendment to the\r\nConstitution which furnishes guarantees to the border slave States\r\nfail, it will be the result of the efforts of the Senator from\r\nVirginia. My object is to take that up; we can dispose of it in a very\r\nfew minutes; and then, when we have secured thus much, we will proceed\r\nimmediately to take up the report of the Peace Conference; and I tell\r\nthe Senator from Virginia he will find me standing here adhering to it\r\nas long as he will; and when the vote comes, I think I shall show that\r\nI am as friendly to it as he; and that I have as much respect for and\r\nappreciation of the services of the great men who reported it.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--The Senator from Illinois and I construe our duties in a\r\nvery different way. I have no parliamentary ends to obtain here by\r\ndexterous motions to give preference. The Senator has never heard me\r\nexpress the slightest approbation of these resolutions from the Peace\r\nConference. On the contrary, he has heard me point out, with whatever\r\nability I might, the objections that would compel me to vote against\r\nthem. I intend to vote against them; but I deem it due to the\r\ncharacter of these resolutions, and the way in which they were brought\r\nbefore the Senate, that their precedence should not be taken from\r\nthem, and that we should have the first vote upon them. The Senator\r\nfrom Illinois will not find me taking back one word that I have said\r\nof objection to the resolutions that came from the Peace Conference;\r\nbut I protest against their precedence being taken from them--a matter\r\nwhich has engaged the attention of the Senate for the last two hours\r\nto effect it. Now that it is done, I shall vote against the motion to\r\ngive precedence. The resolutions of the Peace Conference should not be\r\nthrust aside by this resolution of the House; but that is the motion\r\nnow before us, to thrust aside these resolutions in order to give\r\nplace to the resolution of the House, and I shall vote against it.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I shall pursue, on this occasion, the course I have\r\npursued throughout. My object is to attain a great end, and, if\r\npossible, to give entire satisfaction to the country, and restore it\r\nto peace and quiet, or to go as far in that direction as it is in my\r\npower to go. I shall vote to take up the resolution of the House,\r\nbecause we can act upon it immediately. I am an advocate of the\r\nresolutions from the Peace Conference. I have shown it; I have\r\nexpressed it, and my determination to vote for them, and so I will;\r\nbut I confess that I feel somewhat as the gentleman from Illinois\r\ndoes--surprised at the great zeal with which gentlemen want to keep up\r\nthese propositions merely to strike a blow at others, claiming a\r\nprecedence for a thing they mean to trample and spit upon.\r\n\r\nMr. MASON:--It has precedence, if the Senator will allow me, and he\r\ntook it from it.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--And he wants to continue that precedence. Sir, the\r\nway to manifest respect for their proposition is to vote for it. I do\r\nnot understand this sort of proceeding on the part of gentlemen who\r\ndesire to afford any means of pacification to the country. I am for\r\nthis resolution of the House of Representatives; and I hope the Senate\r\nwill vote to take it up. We can act upon it, and we can vote upon it,\r\nand we know well that we cannot pass these propositions of the Peace\r\nConference. There are but two hours more of session in the other\r\nHouse--from ten to twelve o'clock on Monday morning. I cannot indulge\r\nin a hope, sanguine as I have been throughout, of the passage of those\r\nresolutions; and, indeed, the opposition here, and the opposition on\r\nthis [the Democratic] side of the Chamber to those resolutions, are\r\nconfirmation strong as Holy Writ that they cannot pass. Do gentlemen\r\nwant to press them forward in order to prevent a vote on this\r\nresolution of the House? I hope not. I hope the motion of the\r\ngentleman from Illinois will prevail, and that we shall take up the\r\nHouse resolution.\r\n\r\nMr. BAYARD:--Mr. President, I have forborne to take any part in this\r\ndiscussion about the merits of any of these propositions before the\r\nSenate, nor do I intend to do so now. I shall reserve what I may have\r\nto say to another occasion. I shall not occupy the time of the Senate\r\nnow. I shall vote against this motion, because, while I feel I do no\r\ninjustice to others, I must necessarily exercise my own opinions. I\r\nconsider the resolution passed by the House of Representatives as not\r\nworth the paper on which it is written, for the purpose of adjusting\r\nthe difficulties in this country. I shall not detain the Senate by any\r\nattempt to give the reasons. Sufficient for me to state the ground of\r\nmy objection, why I shall not vote to give preference to a resolution\r\nwhich, as it stands, I think will lead to no attainable result as\r\nregards peace or quiet in the country. As regards the other\r\npropositions, for which it is sought to be substituted, I express no\r\nopinion now, except to say, they are not exactly those that I should\r\nhave preferred; but that I would gladly and willingly vote to adopt\r\nthe distinct resolutions offered originally by the Senator from\r\nKentucky. As to attaining a vote and disposing of this House\r\nresolution at once, of course, as I do not attach any importance to\r\nthe measure, if passed, for the purpose for which it is to be passed,\r\nthat would be a sufficient answer; but further, it will not stop\r\ndebate, and it cannot prevent amendments. Amendments may be made; one\r\nsubstitute after another may be offered, and you can be led into\r\ndebate quite as much as on the other. I would rather see the other\r\nproposition discussed; and on the whole, not thinking the particular\r\nresolution of the House entitled to preference as being of any great\r\nimportance, I am not disposed to give it precedence.\r\n\r\nMr. SEBASTIAN, in speaking on the House resolutions, said: \"It is now\r\npast four o'clock in the morning of the 4th of March, and it is\r\nevident, from obvious causes, that it is utterly impossible that any\r\nexpression of preference for any other resolution than this can now\r\nhave any effect, or receive even the notice of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nAt different stages of the proceedings of the Senate, in proposing and\r\nvoting in relation to various amendments, the following among other\r\nthings said and done, occurred with reference to the Report of the\r\nPeace Conference:\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas:--I beg leave to offer as an amendment, and I\r\npresume it will be the last, the propositions submitted by the Peace\r\nConference. I offer them not with a belief that they will be accepted\r\nor sustained at all. I should be glad to see even that step taken by\r\nthe party who are to have, and who, in point of fact, do have\r\npossession of this Government. I offer them for the purpose of\r\nobtaining a vote upon them. I offer them, stating frankly that I shall\r\nnot vote for them. I offer them with the conviction that there is\r\nbetween the Representatives on the other side of the Chamber, and\r\nthose on the southern side, an irreconcilable difference; and it ought\r\nto be proclaimed, and it ought to be made frank and unmistakable. I\r\noffer it because it evolves truth. There is nothing left here to this\r\nSenate, on this the last night of the session, but this: to declare to\r\nthe American people what is true, in order that they may know it, and\r\nmay prepare themselves to meet it; that they may prepare, if they can,\r\nto reconcile it with peace, or to reconcile it to themselves; to stand\r\nby all the sorrowful consequences that shall otherwise come. This is\r\nthe reason why I present this amendment. I believed when I voted for\r\nthem that the propositions of the Senator from Kentucky were fair,\r\nwere just to the people of the South, and to my own State among that\r\nnumber; and it is but honest that I should say now in presenting this\r\namendment, that I consider these propositions a thousand fathoms\r\nbeneath the propositions of the Senator from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIt is in that condition that I offer this amendment. I hope Senators\r\nwill have the courage and the nerve, if they have faith in and regard\r\nfor their constituents, to whom they have taught their doctrines\r\nheretofore, to adhere to them and to stick to them now; and while they\r\nwill vote against this amendment, I will stand by them also and vote\r\nagainst it, as one person who for fourteen years has represented his\r\nState in one or the other branch of this Congress. In saying this, I\r\nsay it as the last act of my political life, and it is one upon which\r\nI put my faith, and on which I would put the last hope I have on\r\nearth. I know from the bottom of my soul that I am not averse to the\r\ncontinuation and the preservation of the present Union of States,\r\nwhich I have always considered sanctifies the continent of North\r\nAmerica to peace and to prosperity forever. I feel from the bottom of\r\nmy heart that whenever it shall be divided, it will be given up, from\r\npetty causes, and from petty irritations and misapprehensions, to the\r\ncontingencies of war and the contingencies of blood and disaster,\r\nwhich have followed the divisions and separations of every other\r\ncontinent in the whole wide world.\r\n\r\nThen, Mr. President, I offer this amendment from the conviction that\r\ncommon honesty of purpose, and the common frankness of men of nerve\r\nand of honor, will give us one vote to show that there is among us an\r\nirreconcilable difference, or that will give hope to those who, like\r\nthe Senator from Kentucky, it seems to me, can hope against hope, that\r\nthere is something to be done. I cannot believe that any thing is\r\ngained by this resolution. I cannot conceive that the proposition of\r\nthe House gives security to my people. I will not stop to comment upon\r\nit, and to show why it is that I cannot vote for it. I sincerely hope\r\nthat we may have a vote of the Senate upon the amendment I now offer;\r\nand I call for the yeas and nays upon it.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee:--I wish merely to repeat again, before the\r\nyeas and nays are called on this amendment, that I shall vote against\r\nthis, as I have voted against all preceding amendments, with the\r\ndistinct understanding that I am not committed for or against any\r\nproposition contained in those amendments. I hope we shall vote them\r\nall down.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I will merely state that when we have disposed of this\r\nresolution, I hope we shall take up the Peace Conference propositions\r\nimmediately, and get through with them.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proceeded to call the roll.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN (when his name was called):--I desire to say that,\r\nalthough preferring this amendment, I shall vote against it, as I have\r\nagainst all others, in order to pass it as it came to us from the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas:--I should like to have made a further\r\nexplanation; but I will not do it. I vote \"nay.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was then announced--yeas 3, nays 34; as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Messrs. Foot, Nicholson, and Pugh--3.\r\n\r\n     NAYS.--Messrs. Anthony, Baker, Bigler, Bingham, Bright,\r\n     Chandler, Clark, Crittenden, Dixon, Doolittle, Douglas,\r\n     Durkee, Fessenden, Foster, Grimes, Harlan, Hunter, Johnson\r\n     of Arkansas, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, King, Latham,\r\n     Mason, Morrill, Polk, Rice, Sebastian, Sumner, Ten Eyck,\r\n     Trumbull, Wade, Wigfall, Wilkinson, and Wilson--34.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\nOther amendments--of which some were approved and some rejected--were\r\noffered to the joint resolutions, and, finally, the proposals of\r\namendments to the Constitution from the Conference Convention were\r\nagain brought forward in this manner:\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I intend to be perfectly consistent in my course on\r\nthis subject. I look upon the result of the deliberations of the Peace\r\nCongress, as they call it here, as affording the best opportunity for\r\na general concurrence among the States and among the people. I\r\ndetermined to take it in preference to my own proposition, and so\r\nstated to many of the members of that Convention. I now propose the\r\npropositions agreed to by them as a substitute for my own.\r\n\r\nI came here this morning, without the least expectation of any vote\r\nbeing taken on this proposition of mine. It has never been in a\r\ncondition before where I was prepared to offer amendments to it. I had\r\namendments which I intended to propose, not intending to make material\r\nchanges, as I supposed, in substance and effect, but changing the\r\nphraseology, particularly of the first article, in which I propose to\r\nsubstitute an amendment, to declare merely that the _status_ of\r\npersons held to servitude or labor under the laws of any State shall\r\ncontinue with the laws thus unchanged, as long as the Territory\r\nremains under a territorial government; and when it forms a\r\nconstitution, to come into the Union as a State, to be received with\r\nor without slavery. All my papers and the amendments which I prepared\r\nare at my room, not here. That is the condition of the thing.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--The resolution stands now as several States have\r\ninstructed for it, and I hope we shall have a vote on it.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I now move to substitute the resolutions of the Peace\r\nConvention. I have declared that I would do this; that I would abandon\r\nmy own resolutions, and take that proposed by the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--Then I call for the yeas and nays on the amendment of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER:--Does the Chair understand the Senator from\r\nKentucky to offer as an amendment to the resolution now before the\r\nSenate, the resolution of the Peace Conference?\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. HUNTER:--That is an amendment, and on that I ask for the yeas and\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. CRITTENDEN:--I wish to say a word in explanation; of course I\r\nshall make no speech at this hour. I have examined the propositions\r\noffered by that Convention; they contain, in my judgment, every\r\nmaterial provision that is contained in the resolution called the\r\nCRITTENDEN resolution. The resolution that I offered contained nothing\r\nsubstantial that has not been adopted by the Convention, except in one\r\nparticular, and that particular is this: they reject so much of the\r\nresolution offered by me as embraced future acquired territory. They\r\nsaid it was enough to settle in regard to the territory we now hold;\r\nand they have substituted a provision which, I think, ought to be\r\nperfectly satisfactory, as to acquisition of future territory. They\r\nsay none shall be acquired, unless it be by a two-thirds vote of the\r\nSenate, which two-thirds vote shall include a majority of the Senators\r\nfrom the slaveholding States, as well as a majority of the Senators\r\nfrom the North. That gives ample security to the South; it gives ample\r\nsecurity to the North. No territory can be acquired without the\r\napprobation of both sections of the Union, and having this in their\r\npower, they can then make any previous arrangement in regard to\r\nslavery that they please, before the acquisition of territory. That is\r\nthe way they dispose of future acquisitions. I prefer it to the\r\ndisposition made in the resolutions which I submitted to the Senate. I\r\ntherefore offer them, and for other reasons: out of deference to that\r\ngreat body of men selected on the resolution of Virginia, and invited\r\nby Virginia herself. The body having met, and being composed of such\r\nmen, and a majority of that Convention concurring in these\r\nresolutions, I think they come to us with a sanction entitling them to\r\nconsideration; therefore I have moved them.\r\n\r\nMr. GWIN:--I hope the substitute will not be adopted. The very reason\r\nthe Senator has given in favor of it, with reference to the\r\nacquisition of future territory, I think should be the cause of its\r\nbeing voted down. I am sure Senators from Northern States should not\r\nvote for such an amendment as this; because the first acquisition, if\r\nwe get any at all, will be the very kind of acquisition that the\r\nNorthern States want. It is well known that if we had had the same\r\ncounsels in 1854 that we had in 1803, we should have acquired the\r\nwhole Russian Pacific territory to Behring Straits. If THOMAS\r\nJEFFERSON had been President, we should have got the whole of the\r\nPacific possessions of Russia, as we got Louisiana from France, on the\r\nsame principle; and I believe the first acquisition of territory we\r\nshall get will be the Russian possessions to Behring Straits. I hope\r\nthis amendment of the Constitution will not be voted for by those who\r\nare in favor of acquiring territory, especially which will give us\r\nsuch important advantages on the Pacific Ocean. I am utterly opposed\r\nto restricting all acquisition hereafter; especially on the Pacific\r\ncoast of the United States, both north and south. I hope this\r\namendment will be voted down.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGLAS:--I was exceedingly anxious to get a separate and distinct\r\nvote, first on the Peace Conference propositions, and then on the\r\nCRITTENDEN proposition, as perfected by the Senator from Kentucky. I\r\nhave announced several times to-night, that that was my purpose; but\r\nafter what the Senator from Kentucky has said about his obligations to\r\nthe Peace Conference, to give priority to their proposition, I must\r\nfollow him, although I should be delighted if we could make\r\narrangements for separate votes. I prefer his perfected amendment to\r\nthe Peace Conference proposition; but still, I cannot separate from\r\nhim on this question, when he thinks he is bound to bring it forward.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proceeded to call the roll on the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. NICHOLSON (when his name was called):--I greatly prefer the\r\nresolution of the Senator from Kentucky, because it is unequivocal,\r\nunambiguous in its language, and embraces future as well as present\r\nterritory; but I am willing, if that cannot be got, to vote for the\r\nother; and I do not concur in the criticisms that have been made on it\r\nto the full extent, though there are features in it to which I very\r\nmuch object. I shall, therefore, vote \"nay\" on this proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--As I have before announced, I have paired with the\r\nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CAMERON]. If I were not paired, I\r\nshould vote \"nay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GWIN:--He would vote with you, if he were here.\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL:--I cannot tell; he is not here.\r\n\r\nThe result was announced--yeas 7, nays 28, as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Messrs. Crittenden, Douglas, Harlan, Johnson of\r\n     Tennessee, Kennedy, Morrill, and Thomson--7.\r\n\r\n     NAYS.--Messrs. Bayard, Bigler, Bingham, Bright, Chandler,\r\n     Clark, Dixon, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Gwin, Hunter,\r\n     Lane, Latham, Mason, Nicholson, Polk, Pugh, Rice, Sebastian,\r\n     Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade, Wigfall, Wilkinson, and\r\n     Wilson--28.\r\n\r\nSo the amendment was rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV.\r\n\r\n[The action of both houses of Congress in relation to the Peace\r\nConference, and the propositions of amendments therein adopted, would\r\nseem to form a portion of its history. I shall endeavor to furnish\r\ntheir action so far as it can be separated from other matters\r\nconnected with the propositions presented. Immediately after the\r\nadoption of the resolutions of Virginia, under which the Conference\r\nwas called, and on the 28th of January, 1861, the following\r\nproceedings took place in the House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,                 }\r\nWASHINGTON, MONDAY, _January 28th, 1861._ }\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER, Hon. WM. PENNINGTON, laid before the House a message from\r\nthe President of the United States, which was read by the Clerk, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States:_\r\n\r\n    I deem it my duty to submit to Congress a series of\r\n    resolutions adopted by the Legislature of Virginia, on the\r\n    19th inst., having in view a peaceful settlement of the\r\n    exciting questions which now threaten the Union. They were\r\n    delivered to me on Thursday the 24th inst., by ex-President\r\n    TYLER, who has left his dignified and honored retirement, in\r\n    the hope that he may render service to his country in this\r\n    its hour of peril. These resolutions, it will be perceived,\r\n    extend an invitation \"to all such States, whether\r\n    slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite\r\n    with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present\r\n    unhappy controversies in the spirit in which the Constitution\r\n    was originally formed, and consistently with its principles,\r\n    so as to afford to the people of the slaveholding States\r\n    adequate guarantees for the security of their rights, to\r\n    appoint Commissioners to meet, on the 4th day of February\r\n    next, in the City of Washington, similar Commissioners\r\n    appointed by Virginia, to consider, and, if practicable,\r\n    agree upon some suitable adjustment.\"\r\n\r\n    I confess I hail this movement, on the part of Virginia, with\r\n    great satisfaction. From the past history of this ancient and\r\n    renowned Commonwealth, we have the fullest assurance that\r\n    what she has undertaken she will accomplish, if it can be\r\n    done by able, enlightened, and persevering efforts. It is\r\n    highly gratifying to know that other patriotic States have\r\n    appointed, and are appointing Commissioners to meet those of\r\n    Virginia in council. When assembled, they will constitute a\r\n    body entitled, in an eminent degree, to the confidence of the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    The General Assembly of Virginia have also resolved \"that\r\n    ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby appointed by the concurrent\r\n    vote of each branch of the General Assembly, a Commissioner\r\n    to the President of the United States; and Judge JOHN\r\n    ROBERTSON is hereby appointed, by a like vote, a Commissioner\r\n    to the State of South Carolina, and the other States that\r\n    have seceded or shall secede, with instructions respectfully\r\n    to request the President of the United States and the\r\n    authorities of such States to agree to abstain, pending the\r\n    proceedings contemplated by the action of this General\r\n    Assembly, from any and all acts calculated to produce a\r\n    collision of arms between the States and the Government of\r\n    the United States.\"\r\n\r\n    However strong may be my desire to enter into such an\r\n    agreement, I am convinced that I do not possess the power.\r\n    Congress, and Congress alone, under the war-making power, can\r\n    exercise the discretion of agreeing to abstain \"from any and\r\n    all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms\" between\r\n    this and any other Government. It would, therefore, be a\r\n    usurpation for the Executive to attempt to restrain their\r\n    hands by an agreement in regard to matters over which he has\r\n    no constitutional control. If he were thus to act, they might\r\n    pass laws which he should be bound to obey, though in\r\n    conflict with his agreement.\r\n\r\n    Under existing circumstances, my present actual power is\r\n    confined within narrow limits. It is my duty at all times to\r\n    defend and protect the public property within the seceding\r\n    States so far as this may be practicable, and especially to\r\n    employ all constitutional means to protect the property of\r\n    the United States, and to preserve the public peace at this\r\n    the seat of the Federal Government. If the seceding States\r\n    abstain \"from any and all acts calculated to produce a\r\n    collision of arms,\" then the danger so much to be deprecated\r\n    will no longer exist. Defence, and not aggression, has been\r\n    the policy of the administration from the beginning.\r\n\r\n    But while I can enter into no engagement such as that\r\n    proposed, I cordially commend to Congress, with much\r\n    confidence that it will meet their approbation, to abstain\r\n    from passing any law calculated to produce a collision of\r\n    arms pending the proceedings contemplated by the action of\r\n    the General Assembly of Virginia. I am one of those who will\r\n    never despair of the Republic. I yet cherish the belief that\r\n    the American people will perpetuate the Union of the States\r\n    on some terms just and honorable for all sections of the\r\n    country. I trust that the mediation of Virginia may be the\r\n    destined means, under Providence, of accomplishing this\r\n    inestimable benefit. Glorious as are the memories of her past\r\n    history, such an achievement, both in relation to her own\r\n    fame and the welfare of the whole country, would surpass them\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n    JAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nThe \"series of resolutions\" referred to, and transmitted in President\r\nBUCHANAN'S message to Congress, are in the body of this book on pages\r\n9 and 10.\r\n\r\nThe following communication by the Governor of Virginia to the General\r\nAssembly thereof, was also submitted with the President's Message:\r\n\r\n    _The Commonwealth of Virginia,\r\n      to all to whom these presents shall come, greeting:_\r\n\r\n    Know you, that the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of\r\n    Virginia, having, by joint resolution, adopted on the 19th\r\n    instant, and hereto attached, appointed ex-President JOHN\r\n    TYLER a Commissioner to the President of the United States to\r\n    carry out the instructions conveyed in said resolution:\r\n    therefore, I, JOHN LETCHER, Governor, do hereby announce the\r\n    said appointment, and authenticate the same.\r\n\r\n            In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and\r\n    [L.S.]  caused the great seal of the State to be affixed, in the\r\n            City of Richmond, this 20th day of January, Anno Domini\r\n            1861.\r\n\r\n    JOHN LETCHER.\r\n\r\n    By the Governor:\r\n      GEORGE W. MUNFORD,\r\n        _Secretary of the Commonwealth._\r\n\r\nMr. STANTON:--I move that that message be printed, and referred to the\r\nStanding Committee on Military Affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN COCHRANE:--I move as an amendment to that motion, that it be\r\nreferred to the special committee of five.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD, of Michigan:--I would suggest that whatever committee the\r\nmessage is referred to, ought to have power to report it back at any\r\ntime; otherwise it will be locked up where the House cannot control\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BURCH:--The gentleman from Virginia only yielded the floor for the\r\nreading of the message, and is now entitled to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--It is proper that the message should be disposed of in\r\nsome way.\r\n\r\nMr. STANTON:--If the House will allow me, I will move that the\r\nmessage be referred to the Standing Committee on Military Affairs,\r\nwith power to report on it at any time.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--That motion is not in order. A motion has been made to\r\nrefer the message to the Committee on Military Affairs, and the\r\ngentleman from New York moves, as an amendment, that it be referred to\r\nthe special committee of five.\r\n\r\nMr. BOCOCK:--If there is to be any debate on this motion, it should be\r\nallowed to go over until my colleague (Mr. PRYOR) makes his speech.\r\n\r\nMr. STANTON:--I move the previous question.\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS:--The question should first be taken on the motion to refer\r\nto the Committee on Military Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--That statement is correct. The question is on referring\r\nthe message to the Military Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. BOCOCK:--I am bound to interpose on behalf of my colleague, who\r\nsays he only yielded to have the message read.\r\n\r\nMr. STANTON:--The previous question is demanded, and that will put an\r\nend to the matter at once.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLSON:--I think the question deserves some little consideration.\r\nI therefore move to postpone the further consideration of the\r\nPresident's message till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMr. STANTON:--Very well; let that course be taken.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the report of the Peace Conference had been transmitted to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and while the joint resolutions were under\r\nconsideration, several ineffectual attempts were made to get the\r\nlabors of the Conference before the House. Here is one of the first:\r\n\r\nMr. MAYNARD:--It is known, I suppose, to most members of the House,\r\ninformally and unofficially, that what is known as the Peace\r\nConference, to which the country has been looking for several days,\r\nhas concluded its labors and dissolved. [Cries of \"Order!\"] I desire\r\nto make a proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. BINGHAM, and others objected.\r\n\r\nMr. MAYNARD:--I have a right to make a proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIGE, of North Carolina:--I call the gentleman to order, and\r\ninsist upon the enforcement of the rules.\r\n\r\nMr. MAYNARD [amid loud cries of \"Order!\"] moved to postpone the vote\r\nupon the pending propositions until to-morrow after the morning hour.\r\n\r\nThe motion was not agreed to.\r\n\r\nAnd again, the same day, February 27th, the following effort was made:\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I wish to state that I understand there is on the\r\nSpeaker's table a communication from the president of the Peace\r\nConference. I ask the unanimous consent of the House that it be taken\r\nup and read.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--I object.\r\n\r\nSo action was further delayed.\r\n\r\n_March 1st, 1861._--When a communication from the Navy Department came\r\nup for consideration in the House, the motion to postpone the special\r\norder brought out the following action on the communication of the\r\nPeace Conference:\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--There is a communication, which has been for some time\r\nlying upon the Speaker's table, from the president of the Peace\r\nConference. The Chair thinks it is right that it should be taken up.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--I object.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I call for the regular order of business.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair has not thought proper to present it until the\r\npropositions of the Committee of Thirty-three had been disposed of;\r\nbut he thinks it right that they should now be presented.\r\n\r\nMr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania:--I object, on behalf of John Tyler, who\r\ndoes not want them in. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I move to suspend the rules.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I call for the regular order of business.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair thinks he ought to have the privilege of\r\npresenting these papers.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I rise to a question of order. The territorial business is\r\nthe special order. I am entitled to the floor; and I submit that it\r\ncannot be taken from me by any motion to suspend the rules.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair thinks the motion to suspend the rules is in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--The Chair can hardly understand my question of order. It is\r\nthat the territorial business is the special order, made so by a\r\nsuspension of the rules. While that is pending, therefore, by the\r\nuniform decision of the House, no motion can be entertained to suspend\r\nthe rules.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The territorial business was made the special order for\r\nthe two succeeding days after the propositions reported by the\r\nCommittee of Thirty-three had been disposed of.\r\n\r\nMr. BOTELER:--I want to know if there is any business, or can be any\r\nbusiness, that should take precedence of these propositions of the\r\nPeace Conference?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--Yes, sir; there are ten thousand things that should take\r\nprecedence.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair decides that the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.\r\nMcCLERNAND] has the floor, and is entitled to make the motion to\r\nsuspend the rules.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--Do I understand the Chair to decide that the business of\r\nthe Territories does not come up to-day?\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair is of opinion that, under a strict\r\nconstruction of the rule, it would properly come up to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I appeal from the decision of the Chair.\r\n\r\nMr. HATTON: I move to lay that appeal on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. HICKMAN:--Upon that motion, I call for tellers.\r\n\r\nMr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois:--Before the House divides upon the appeal,\r\nI desire the Chair to state precisely what the point of order is that\r\nwe are to vote upon.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair decided that the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.\r\nMcCLERNAND] had the floor, and was in order in moving to suspend the\r\nrules for the purpose of receiving the communication the Chair desired\r\nto lay before the House. From that decision an appeal was taken, and a\r\nmotion made to lay the appeal on the table. The question is now upon\r\nthe latter motion.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I rise to a question of order again. The Chair has not\r\nstated my question of order correctly. My point of order was, that the\r\nbusiness of the Territories was set down as a special order\r\nimmediately after the disposal of the business of the Committee of\r\nThirty-three.\r\n\r\nMr. HATTON:--I call the gentleman from Pennsylvania to order.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I have the right to state my point of order.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The gentleman from Pennsylvania will state his point of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--It is, that the Territorial business having been made the\r\nspecial order, comes up now as the regular order of business.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair decides that the gentleman from Illinois\r\nobtained the floor, and had the right to submit the motion to suspend\r\nthe rules.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--He had no right to take the floor from me for any such\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair overrules the question of order.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--And from that decision I take an appeal.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The appeal is already pending; and a motion has been\r\nmade to lay the appeal on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--I call for tellers on the motion.\r\n\r\nTellers were ordered, and Messrs. ADRAIN and GROW were appointed.\r\n\r\nThe House divided; and the tellers reported--forty-seven in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nMr. HOWARD, of Michigan:--I move that the House adjourn.\r\n\r\nBefore the vote had been taken on the motion, the hour of five\r\narrived; and\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER declared the House had taken a recess until seven o'clock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION.\r\n\r\nThe House reassembled at seven o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--What is the regular order of business?\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair had decided that the gentleman from Illinois\r\n[Mr. McCLERNAND] was entitled to the floor, to move that the rules be\r\nsuspended to receive a communication from the Peace Conference. From\r\nthat decision the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GROW] appealed; and\r\na motion was made to lay the appeal on the table.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I think we can perhaps agree to an arrangement that\r\nwill be satisfactory to gentlemen upon both sides, by which any\r\ndifficulty upon the question of order can be avoided. If gentlemen\r\nupon that side of the House will allow the propositions to be\r\npresented, we are willing that they shall be referred, and the House\r\nthen proceed to the consideration of the territorial business.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLOGG, of Illinois:--I hope that will be done.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--I object to the reception of the proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. HICKMAN:--There are but few members present. I move that there be\r\na call of the House.\r\n\r\nThe motion was disagreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. HICKMAN:--I ask the Chair for his judgment whether there is a\r\nquorum present or not.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--In the opinion of the Chair, a quorum is not present.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I inquire whether there is any objection to the\r\npropositions of the Peace Conference being taken up and referred?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--I certainly object in _toto coelo_ to any such\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nMr. BOTELER:--I desire to ask this question: can any member object to\r\nthe reception of a communication from the Peace Congress?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--It is not a Peace Congress at all. There is no such body\r\nknown to this House.\r\n\r\nMr. BOTELER:--I merely ask the question for information, for I do not\r\nprofess to be familiar with the rules; I desire to know whether the\r\nobjection of a single member can defeat the reception of such a\r\nproposition, especially when that single member is known not to be a\r\nconservative man, but a man opposed to all compromises?\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair will suggest that a great deal of time will be\r\nsaved by having a call of the House, as there is evidently no quorum\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nA call of the House was taken. A quorum having appeared, the House\r\nproceeded to dispose of several special orders, when, on a motion of\r\npostponement, it returned in this wise to the Peace Conference:\r\n\r\nMr. LOGAN:--I demand the yeas and nays on the motion to postpone.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were not ordered.\r\n\r\nThe special order was then postponed.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I now move to suspend the rules of the House, for the\r\npurpose of receiving the memorial of the Peace Congress, which\r\nassembled lately in this city.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--To be received? What for?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--For reference I suppose.\r\n\r\nMr. BURNETT:--No; but to get it in, and put it upon its passage.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair understood the proposition to be, that the\r\nrules should be suspended, in order that the paper should be received\r\nfor reference.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--I withdraw that part of the proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SICKLES:--If it be received, it is then in the power of the House\r\nto do with it what it pleases.\r\n\r\nMr. GROW:--The understanding was that the motion should be made for\r\nthe suspension of the rules only to receive the proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SICKLES:--That is all right. When the paper gets in, the House can\r\ndo with it what it may deem fit.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVEJOY:--I demand the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\nThe yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN:--Is it proposed to act on the memorial of the Peace\r\nCongress?\r\n\r\nMr. SICKLES:--If it comes before the House, it will be for us to say\r\nwhat disposition shall be made of it. [Cries of \"Call the roll!\"]\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIGE, of North Carolina:--This motion is merely for the\r\nsuspension of the rules to receive the proposition, and this,\r\ntherefore, may be considered a test vote. [Cries of \"Call the roll!\"]\r\n\r\nThe question was taken; and it was decided in the negative--yeas 93,\r\nnays 67; as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS.--Messrs. Charles F. Adams, Green Adams, Adrain,\r\n     Aldrich, William C. Anderson, Avery, Barr, Barret, Bocock,\r\n     Boteler, Brabson, Branch, Briggs, Bristow, Brown, Burch,\r\n     Burnett, Campbell, Horace F.

Alley, Ashley, Bingham, Blair, Brayton,\r\n     Buffinton, Burlingame, Burnham, Carey, Case, Coburn, Colfax,\r\n     Conway, Burton Craige, Dawes, Delano, Duell, Edgerton,\r\n     Eliot, Ely, Fenton, Ferry, Frank, Gooch, Graham, Grow,\r\n     Gurley, Helmick, Hickman, Hindman, William A.

Washburn, Elihu B. Washburne, Wells, Wilson, Windom, and\r\n     Woodruff--67.\r\n\r\nSo (two thirds not voting in favor thereof) the rules were not\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nDuring the vote,\r\n\r\nMr. WOODSON said:--I rise for information. What are we voting on?\r\n[Cries of \"Order!\"] I cannot for my life imagine how this can be\r\nregarded as a test vote. I will vote to receive the proposition of the\r\nPeace Conference; but on its passage I will vote against it.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The motion is, to suspend the rules for the reception of\r\nthe memorial.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIGE, of North Carolina:--I understood the gentleman from\r\nIllinois to state that this was a test vote.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair cannot undertake to decide whether it is a\r\ntest vote or not.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN COCHRANE stated that his colleagues, Mr. CLARK B. COCHRANE\r\nand Mr. LEE, were paired.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIGE, of North Carolina:--I would have no objection, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, to permit this resolution to come before the House, but I\r\nunderstood the gentleman from Illinois to proclaim that this was a\r\ntest vote. Utterly opposed to any such wishy-washy settlement of our\r\nnational difficulties, I vote \"no.\"\r\n\r\nMr. CURTIS stated that he was paired with Mr. ANDERSON, of Missouri.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER:--While I am willing to vote for the reception of the\r\nmemorial of the Peace Congress, of which I was a member, still I am\r\nunwilling to be considered as favoring their proposition. Is this vote\r\na test vote on that proposition?\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair does not think that it is; but each gentleman\r\nwill decide for himself.\r\n\r\nMr. HALE:--I am willing to receive this memorial in courtesy to the\r\nPeace Conference; and not regarding this as a test vote, I vote \"ay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. LEACH, of Michigan, stated that he had paired with Mr. ENGLISH, or\r\nhe would have voted in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr. LEAKE (when his name was called) said that he regarded this\r\n_thing_ as a miserable abortion, forcibly reminding one of the old\r\nfable of the mountain and the mouse; nevertheless, he was willing to\r\nlet the mouse in, in order to have the pleasure of killing it.\r\n\r\nMr. RUFFIN:--As it is announced that this is a test vote, I am\r\ncompelled to vote \"no.\" Otherwise, I would have been willing to let\r\nthe matter be brought before the House for its consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. JENKINS:--Who can make this a test vote? Certainly no man in this\r\nHouse. This is a vote to receive the memorial, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nMr. WILSON stated that Mr. VALLANDIGHAM was paired with Mr. BEALE.\r\n\r\nMr. JUNKIN stated that his colleague, Mr. MONTGOMERY, was detained at\r\nhome by illness.\r\n\r\nMr. NIXON stated that his colleague, Mr. STRATTON, was detained at his\r\nroom by illness, and that if he were present, he would vote to receive\r\nthe memorial of the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. ELY stated that his colleague, Mr. LEE, was detained at his room\r\nby indisposition.\r\n\r\nMr. PENDLETON stated that his colleague was detained at his room by\r\nindisposition.\r\n\r\nMr. CAMPBELL stated that his colleague, Mr. SCRANTON, was absent from\r\nthe Hall because of illness.\r\n\r\nMr. POTTER:--As this is a test vote, I vote \"no.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BRAYTON:--I understand this to be a test vote, and therefore vote\r\n\"no.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HOARD:--These papers are not before us. They are not printed, and\r\nwe cannot be supposed to know any thing of them; and I would ask,\r\ntherefore, how they can be regarded as a test vote? I vote \"ay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BOCOCK:--Mr. Speaker, out of deference to the Peace Conference,\r\ncalled as it was by my State, I vote to receive this report. But\r\nunless the report, as it appears in the papers, can be amended, it\r\ncannot receive my approval.\r\n\r\nMr. SHERMAN:--I vote against this, simply because we have no time to\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\nMr. HINDMAN:--I vote against suspending the rules, because I desire to\r\ndefeat the proposition of the Peace Conference, believing it to be\r\nunworthy of the vote of any Southern man.\r\n\r\nMr. COX (not being within the bar when his name was called) asked\r\nleave to vote.\r\n\r\nMr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, objected.\r\n\r\nMr. GARNETT:--Mr. Speaker, intending and desiring to express my\r\nabhorrence of these insidious propositions, conceived in fraud and\r\nborn of cowardice, by giving a direct vote against them, yet from\r\nrespect for the conference which reported them, I am willing to\r\nreceive them, and therefore now vote \"ay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HARRIS, of Virginia:--I vote \"ay,\" because I am in favor of the\r\nresolutions as a peace measure.\r\n\r\nMr. MAYNARD:--Believing these propositions eminently wise and just, I\r\nwill let my vote stand in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nMr. BURNETT:--I hope the Chair will enforce the rules.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--I am trying to, all I can; and I hope gentlemen will\r\nkeep their seats and preserve order.\r\n\r\nMr. DE JARNETTE:--I vote \"ay,\" with the hope of having an opportunity\r\nto vote against the propositions of the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. BOTELER:--I vote \"ay,\" to introduce these propositions, because I\r\nbelieve it to be my duty to do every thing, consistent with honor, to\r\npreserve the peace and save the Union of my country.\r\n\r\nMr. COX:--I desire to ask a question of the Chair.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair will hear you.\r\n\r\nMr. COX:--I desire to know whether or not it will be in order to move\r\nto suspend the rules to enable me to have my vote recorded?\r\n\r\nMr. SPEAKER:--No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. COX:--I would like very much to have it recorded in favor of these\r\npeace propositions. I vote \"ay,\" if there is no objection.\r\n\r\nMr. HINDMAN:--Consent is not given to the gentleman from Ohio to have\r\nhis vote recorded.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--It is not received.\r\n\r\nMr. ROBINSON, of Rhode Island:--Believing that this is a test vote, I\r\nchange my vote, and vote \"no.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN COCHRANE:--I wish to know whether the vote of my colleague,\r\nCLARK B. COCHRANE, is recorded.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--It is not.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN COCHRANE:--I think he has retired from the House on account\r\nof sickness in his family; and I believe he is laboring for the Union\r\nin other quarters.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLSON:--I desire to vote.\r\n\r\nObjection was made.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLSON:--I am entitled to vote, having been absent upon a\r\ncommittee of conference. I vote \"ay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HINDMAN:--Is the gentleman entitled to vote under the rules of the\r\nHouse?\r\n\r\nMr. BARR:--Objection comes too late.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--It has been usual to allow gentlemen to vote under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. HICKMAN:--Do the rules allow him to vote?\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER:--The Chair supposes that is the rule of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. HINDMAN:--I ask to have the rule read.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLSON:--No rule of the House could take away the right of a\r\nmember to vote when he is absent by order of the House. If the rules\r\ndeprived a member of the right to vote under such circumstances, it\r\nwould be void.\r\n\r\nThe result was announced as above recorded.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLERNAND:--This vote divides the Republican party, and sounds\r\nits death knell.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\nREPORTS OF DELEGATES TO STATES.\r\n\r\n_Report of the Peace Commissioners to the Legislature of Virginia._\r\n\r\n    _To His Excellency_ JOHN LETCHER, _Governor of Virginia:_\r\n\r\n    The undersigned Commissioners, in pursuance of the wishes of\r\n    the General Assembly, expressed in the resolutions of the\r\n    19th day of January last, repaired in due season to the City\r\n    of Washington. They there found, on the 4th day of February,\r\n    the day suggested in the overture of Virginia for a\r\n    Conference with the other States, Commissioners to meet them\r\n    from the following States, viz.: Rhode Island, New Jersey,\r\n    Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut,\r\n    Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\n    Kentucky. Subsequently, during the continuance of the\r\n    Conference, at different periods, appeared likewise\r\n    Commissioners from Tennessee, Massachusetts, Missouri, New\r\n    York, Maine, Iowa, and Kansas. So that before the close\r\n    twenty-one States were represented by Commissioners,\r\n    appointed either by the Legislatures or Governors of the\r\n    respective States.\r\n\r\n    The undersigned communicated the resolutions of the General\r\n    Assembly to this Conference, and, both before its committee\r\n    appointed to recommend a plan of adjustment, and the\r\n    Conference itself, urged the propositions known as the\r\n    CRITTENDEN resolutions, with the modification suggested by\r\n    the General Assembly of Virginia, as the basis of an\r\n    acceptable adjustment.\r\n\r\n    They were not adopted by the Conference, but in lieu thereof,\r\n    after much discussion, and the consideration of many proposed\r\n    amendments, the article with seven sections, intended as an\r\n    amendment to the Constitution, was adopted by sections (not\r\n    under the rules, being voted on as a whole), and by a vote of\r\n    the Conference (not taken by States), was directed to be\r\n    submitted to Congress, with the request that it should be\r\n    recommended to the States for ratification, which was\r\n    accordingly done by the President of the Conference.\r\n\r\n    The undersigned regret that the Journal showing the\r\n    proceedings and votes in the Conference has not yet been\r\n    published or furnished them, and that consequently they are\r\n    not able to present it with this report. As soon as received\r\n    it will be communicated to your Excellency.\r\n\r\n    In the absence of that record it is deemed appropriate to\r\n    state that on the final adoption of the first section, two of\r\n    the States, Indiana and Missouri, did not vote, and New York\r\n    was divided, and that the votes by States was, ayes 9, nays\r\n    8--Virginia, by a majority of her Commissioners, voting in\r\n    the negative.\r\n\r\n    The other sections were adopted by ranging majorities (not\r\n    precisely recollected), and on the fifth and seventh sections\r\n    the vote of Virginia was in the negative. The plan, when\r\n    submitted to Congress, failed to receive its recommendation,\r\n    and as that body, having adjourned, can take no further\r\n    cognizance of it, the undersigned feel the contingency has\r\n    arrived on which they are required to report, as they herein\r\n    do, the result of their action.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    JOHN TYLER,\r\n    G.W. SUMMERS,\r\n    W.C. RIVES,\r\n    JAS. A. SEDDON.\r\n\r\nThe above report having been read and ordered to be printed, Mr.\r\nSUMMERS stated that the reason it was not signed by Judge\r\nBROCKENBROUGH, the other Virginia Commissioner, was because that\r\ngentleman was not in Richmond. Mr. SUMMERS presented a communication\r\nin which Judge BROCKENBROUGH stated his views at length on the\r\npropositions adopted by the Convention, and it was printed, by vote of\r\nthe Legislature, in connection with the report.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the different sections of the propositions adopted by\r\nthe Peace Conference, Judge BROCKENBROUGH, in his letter, states that\r\nthe said propositions, _as an entirety_, would have received his vote,\r\nand therefore the vote of Virginia, in the Peace Conference, if it had\r\nbeen submitted to a vote in that form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reports of the New York Commissioners to the Legislature of that\r\nState._\r\n\r\nMAJORITY REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO THE PEACE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n_March 23d, 1861._\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable the Legislature of the State of New York:_\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commissioners appointed by the Legislature of the\r\nState of New York to meet Commissioners from other States in the City\r\nof Washington on the fourth day of February, 1861, upon the call of\r\nthe State of Virginia, by resolutions passed by the General Assembly\r\nof that State on the nineteenth day of January, 1861.\r\n\r\nA copy of the Journal of the Convention is submitted herewith, from\r\nwhich it will be seen that prior to the presence of the Commissioners\r\nfrom New York, that body had been completely organized, rules of order\r\nadopted which excluded all persons other than members from witnessing\r\nits deliberations, forbidding any publication or other communication\r\nof its proceedings, and the taking of any entry from its Journal\r\nwithout leave; in short, requiring all its debates and acts to be kept\r\nsecret. A committee had also been organized of one from each State to\r\nbe appointed by the Commissioners from such State, to which the\r\nVirginia resolutions were referred, \"with all other propositions for\r\nthe adjustment of existing differences between the States, with\r\nauthority to report what they might deem right, proper, and necessary\r\nto restore harmony and preserve the Union;\" and this committee had\r\nbeen in session two days before your Commissioners were enabled to\r\nappoint any one of their number upon it. This was done on the eighth\r\nof February by the appointment of Mr. Field.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Dodge, one of your Commissioners, took his seat in the\r\nConvention on the seventh day of February, 1861, and Messrs. Field,\r\nNoyes, Wadsworth, Corning, King, and Wool, on the eighth of February,\r\nMr. Smith on the eleventh, and Judges James and Bronson on the twelfth\r\nday of February, and Mr. Granger, who was appointed in the place of\r\nJudge Gardiner, who declined, on the eighteenth day of February, 1861.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed advisable by your Commissioners that the proceedings of\r\nthe Convention should be open to the public and the press, and hence\r\nthey advised and concurred in resolutions introduced for that purpose,\r\nwhich were laid on the table on the motion of a Commissioner from the\r\nState of New Jersey. On a subsequent day they also concurred in a\r\nresolution authorizing the employment of a stenographer, to \"preserve\r\naccurate notes of the debates and other proceedings of 'the\r\nConvention,' which notes should not be communicated to any person, nor\r\nshall copies thereof be taken, nor shall the same be made public until\r\nafter the final adjournment of this Convention, except in pursuance of\r\na vote authorizing their publication;\" but this was refused, and the\r\nresolution laid on the table on motion of a Commissioner from the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, by a vote of eleven to eight, all the Slave\r\nStates represented voting against it, with the addition of the States\r\nof Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Before the\r\nConvention closed its session, the following states, twenty-one in\r\nall, were represented in the Convention: Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri, Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont,\r\nIllinois, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Kansas. With the\r\nconcurrence of a majority of your Commissioners, Mr. Field offered in\r\nthe committee of one from each State, on the fourteenth of February,\r\nthe following proposition:\r\n\r\n     \"Each State has the sole and exclusive right, according to\r\n     its own judgment, to order and direct its domestic\r\n     institutions, and to determine for itself what shall be the\r\n     relation to each other of all persons residing or being\r\n     within its limits;\"\r\n\r\nbut it was rejected by a majority of the committee, and formed no part\r\nof its report.\r\n\r\nThat committee made its report on the fourteenth of February,\r\nunaccompanied by any written observations, in the shape of an\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States, in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States not\r\n     embraced within the limits of the Cherokee Treaty Grant,\r\n     north of a line from east to west on the parallel of 36° 30´\r\n     north latitude, involuntary servitude, except in punishment\r\n     of crime, is prohibited whilst it shall be under a\r\n     Territorial Government; and in all the territory south of\r\n     said line, the status of persons owing service or labor, as\r\n     it now exists, shall not be changed by law while such\r\n     territory shall be under a Territorial Government; and\r\n     neither Congress nor the Territorial Government shall have\r\n     power to hinder or prevent the taking to said territory of\r\n     persons held to labor or involuntary service, within the\r\n     United States, according to the laws or usages of the State\r\n     from which such persons may be taken, nor to impair the\r\n     rights arising out of said relations, which shall be subject\r\n     to judicial cognizance in the Federal Courts according to\r\n     the common law; and when any Territory north or south of\r\n     said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe,\r\n     shall contain a population required for a member of\r\n     Congress, according to the then Federal ratio of\r\n     representation, it shall, if its form of government be\r\n     republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal footing\r\n     with the original States, with or without involuntary\r\n     service or labor, as the constitution of such new State may\r\n     provide.\r\n\r\n     ART. 2. Territory shall not be acquired by the United\r\n     States, unless by treaty, nor except for naval and\r\n     commercial stations and depots, unless such treaty shall be\r\n     ratified by four-fifths of all the members of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     ART. 3. Neither the Constitution nor any amendment thereof\r\n     shall be construed to give Congress power to regulate,\r\n     abolish, or control, within any State or Territory of the\r\n     United States, the relation established or recognized by the\r\n     laws thereof touching persons bound to labor or involuntary\r\n     service therein, nor to interfere with or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in the District of Columbia without the\r\n     consent of Maryland, and without the consent of the owners,\r\n     or making the owners who do not consent just compensation;\r\n     nor the power to interfere with or prohibit representatives\r\n     and others from bringing with them to the City of\r\n     Washington, retaining, and taking away persons so bound to\r\n     labor; nor the power to interfere with, or abolish\r\n     involuntary service in places under the exclusive\r\n     jurisdiction of the United States, within those States and\r\n     Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor\r\n     the power to prohibit the removal or transportation by land,\r\n     sea, or river, of persons held to labor or involuntary\r\n     service in any State or Territory of the United States to\r\n     any other State or Territory thereof where it is established\r\n     or recognized by law or usage; and the right during\r\n     transportation of touching at ports, shores, and landings,\r\n     and of landing in case of distress, shall exist, nor shall\r\n     Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\n     on persons bound to labor than on land.\r\n\r\n     ART. 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the\r\n     fourth article of the Constitution, shall not be construed\r\n     to prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation,\r\n     and through the action of their judicial and ministerial\r\n     officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from\r\n     labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.\r\n\r\n     ART. 5. The foreign slave-trade and the importation of\r\n     slaves into the United States and their Territories from\r\n     places beyond the present limits thereof, are forever\r\n     prohibited.\r\n\r\n     ART. 6. The first, third, and fifth articles, together with\r\n     this article of these amendments, and the third paragraph of\r\n     the second section of the first article of the Constitution,\r\n     and the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth\r\n     article thereof, shall not be amended or abolished without\r\n     the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n     ART. 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United States\r\n     shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive from\r\n     labor, in all cases where the marshal or other officers,\r\n     whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was prevented\r\n     from so doing by violence or intimidation from mobs and\r\n     riotous assemblies, or when after such arrest such fugitive\r\n     was rescued by force, and the owner thereby prevented and\r\n     obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for the recovery of\r\n     such fugitive.\r\n\r\nMr. Field, the member of the committee from New York, dissented from\r\nthis report, as also did Mr. Baldwin, of Connecticut, and Mr.\r\nCrowninshield, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Seddon, of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis report was under discussion, and various amendments were proposed\r\nto it until the twenty-seventh day of February, a majority of your\r\nCommissioners steadily opposing all its provisions except that\r\nprohibiting the foreign slave-trade, and most of such majority being\r\nopposed to the submission, by the Convention, of any amendment of the\r\nConstitution of the United States at the present time, and in the\r\npresent excited state of the public mind. During the consideration of\r\nthe report various independent propositions were made by the consent,\r\nand with the concurrence of your Commissioners; among which was one by\r\nMr. Baldwin, of Connecticut, presented on the fifteenth of February,\r\nin the form of a minority report from the committee upon the plan of\r\nadjustment, which concluded with a resolution, \"That the Convention\r\nrecommend to the several States to unite with Kentucky in her\r\napplication to Congress to call a Convention for proposing amendments\r\nto the Constitution of the United States, to be submitted to the\r\nLegislatures of the several States or to Conventions therein, for\r\nratification, as the one or other mode of ratification may be proposed\r\nby Congress;\" and this proposition, after being discussed at length,\r\nwas lost on the twenty-sixth of February, by a vote of thirteen States\r\nagainst to nine in its favor, a majority of your Commissioners casting\r\nthe vote of New York in favor of it.\r\n\r\nA proposition somewhat similar, embracing an address to the people of\r\nthe United States, and containing a resolution for calling the\r\nConvention, was also submitted to the Convention, with the like\r\nconcurrence of a majority of your Commissioners, by Mr. Tuck of New\r\nHampshire, on the eighteenth of February, and on the twenty-sixth was\r\nalso defeated by a vote of eleven States against nine.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that your Commissioners, with those from\r\nseveral other States, offered to unite in a call for a Convention, to\r\nbe convened in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States; and\r\nthat the slave States uniting with several of the free States,\r\nuniformly opposed, and at last defeated it.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of February Mr. Vandever, of Iowa, offered the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That whatever may be the ultimate determination\r\n     upon the amendment to the Federal Constitution, or other\r\n     propositions for the adjustment approved by this Convention,\r\n     we, the members, recommend our respective States and\r\n     constituencies to faithfully abide in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nA motion to lay it upon the table prevailed by a vote of eleven to\r\nnine, a majority of your Commissioners voting in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of February, Mr. Field, one of your Commissioners, at\r\nthe instance of a majority of them, offered, as an amendment to the\r\nConstitution to be adopted by the Convention, and proposed with any\r\nother amendments, that it should recommend the following:\r\n\r\n     \"The Union of the States, under this Constitution, is\r\n     indissoluble; and no State can secede from the Union, or\r\n     nullify an act of Congress, or absolve its citizens from\r\n     their paramount obligation of obedience to the Constitution\r\n     and laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of February, after several ineffectual attempts to\r\nget rid of the proposition, on points of order, it was negatived by a\r\nvote of eleven States against ten, a majority of your Commissioners\r\ncasting the vote of New York in its favor.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, moved the following as an amendment to\r\nthe seventh article, on the twenty-first of February.\r\n\r\n     \"And Congress shall further provide by law, that the United\r\n     States shall make full compensation to a citizen of any\r\n     State, who, in any other State, shall suffer by reason of\r\n     violence or intimidation from mobs or riotous assemblies in\r\n     his person or property, or in the deprivation by violence of\r\n     his rights secured by this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nA motion was made to insert the word \"white\" before \"citizen,\" but it\r\nfailed by a vote of eleven to ten; and on the twenty-fifth of February\r\nthe entire amendment was defeated by a vote of eleven to eight; your\r\nCommissioners, by a majority, casting the vote of New York in its\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nSeveral other propositions upon other subjects were also submitted to\r\nthe Convention, as will appear by the Journal; but it is not deemed\r\nnecessary to refer to them more particularly, except, that on the\r\neighteenth of February, Mr. Reid, of North Carolina, proposed to amend\r\nthe first section of the committee's report by inserting after the\r\nword \"line\" in the seventh line thereof, the words \"involuntary\r\nservitude is recognized; and property in those of the African race\r\nheld to service or labor, in any of the States of the Union, when\r\nremoved to such territory, shall be protected,\" and which was lost by\r\na vote of seventeen States against to three for it. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth of February, he also moved to insert in the same section,\r\nafter the words \"common law,\" the words, \"and such rights shall be\r\nprotected by all departments of the Territorial Government during its\r\ncontinuance,\" which the President ruled out of order, as the section\r\nhad been previously gone through in detail, and was only before the\r\nConvention on its final passage.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Committee on a plan of adjustment, already\r\nmentioned, came up for consideration on its final passage, after many\r\namendments had been made to it, as will appear by the Journal, on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of February, in the following form, and was ultimately\r\nthus adopted, by the votes stated at the end of each section:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\n     SECTION I.

A\r\nmotion was immediately made to reconsider, which was advocated by Mr.\r\nGranger, one of the Commissioners from New York, and was carried by a\r\nvote of fourteen States for, to five against it--a majority of the\r\nCommissioners from New York again casting its vote in the negative,\r\nand the Convention adjourned. On the next day it again came up on its\r\nfinal passage, and was then carried by a vote of nine States for, to\r\neight against it--the vote of New York not being given. Why it was not\r\ngiven is left by the Commissioners to be stated by Mr. Field, on his\r\nown responsibility. (_See note_, p. 596.)\r\n\r\nThe vote of New York was not given upon any of the sections except the\r\nfifth, for the reason already stated; but upon that section we all\r\nvoted Aye, as all her Commissioners then present were in its favor.\r\n\r\nAfter the several votes had been taken, it was objected that the whole\r\narticle should be put to a vote upon the question of its final\r\nadoption before it could be regarded as properly passed, but the\r\nPresident of the Convention decided that this was not necessary, and\r\nno such vote was taken. At the close of the discussion on this subject\r\nyour Commissioners were prepared to cast the vote against the entire\r\narticle, if any question had been taken upon it as a whole, as a\r\nmajority of your Commissioners think it should have been.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adoption of these proposed amendments to the\r\nConstitution, and after voting down and laying on the table various\r\npropositions made by a minority in the interest of freedom and the\r\nfree States, the Convention adjourned--having adopted an address to\r\nCongress requesting that body to submit the amendment, to Conventions\r\nof the several States, for ratification, according to the Constitution\r\nof the United States; and they were accordingly communicated to\r\nCongress on the same day. In the Senate, they were referred to a\r\ncommittee, and were recommended for adoption by a majority of that\r\ncommittee; but Messrs. Seward and Trumbull, a minority of the\r\ncommittee, reported against the amendments, and in favor of a National\r\nConvention; thus following out and approving the proposition which had\r\nbeen made in the Convention by your Commissioners, and the entire\r\nminority of that party, nearly three weeks before, and for which the\r\nmajority which controlled it, if it had chosen to do so, could at any\r\ntime have obtained an unanimous vote. The amendment of the Convention,\r\nhowever, failed to secure the approval of either branch of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe labors of your Commissioners having thus terminated, it is due to\r\nthose whom they represented, and to themselves, that the majority\r\nshould state briefly the reasons why the proposed amendments to the\r\nConstitution did not meet their approbation.\r\n\r\n_First._--In their judgment, no amendment of that sacred instrument in\r\nthe interest, and for the purpose of the extension and perpetuation of\r\nthe slave power--an interest which has wielded the whole political\r\npower of the United States during almost the entire existence of the\r\nGovernment--was either expedient or necessary. They preferred it\r\nshould remain and continue just as it came from the hands of our\r\nrevolutionary fathers; a Constitution establishing freedom and not\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n_Second._--The Convention would scarcely listen to, much less adopt,\r\nany amendment in the interest of freedom or of free labor, or of the\r\nrights of citizens of the free States; the only one of that\r\ncharacter--that in relation to securing to the citizens of each State\r\nthe privileges and immunities of citizens of the several\r\nStates--having been voted down as a direct proposition when offered by\r\nMr. Wilmot, and only adopted in an indirect way at the end of the\r\nsection requiring payment to be made by Congress for rescued slaves.\r\nIn like manner the absolute right of secession in every State as\r\ninherent under the Constitution of the United States was claimed to\r\nexist by members of the Convention from the slave States, accompanied\r\nby a denial of any right in the General Government to coerce obedience\r\nto it, or to enforce the laws for the collection of revenue. And\r\nalthough all the delegates from the slave States did not take this\r\nground, yet in several instances a majority of the delegates from\r\nseveral of them did so, and the States themselves generally voted\r\nagainst all propositions to the contrary. The article proposed by your\r\nCommissioners denying the right of nullification and secession was\r\ndefeated in accordance with these views; so that in effect slave\r\nStates, and such of the free States as voted with them, would not\r\nconsent so to amend the Constitution as to deny the right of\r\nnullification and secession, even if all the guarantees demanded by\r\nthe slave interest were accorded to it. In addition, many of the\r\ndelegates from the slave States declared that it was the fixed\r\ndetermination of those States to stand by the States that had seceded\r\nfrom the Union, and to aid them in resisting it, even if such\r\nguarantees were given; and that they would resist any attempts to\r\ncoerce them, or to enforce the revenue, or any other laws within their\r\nlimits, without their consent. In other words, they claimed a right to\r\nremain in the Union under the Constitution, with its new guarantees of\r\nslavery, and yet to obstruct the operations of the Government, to\r\nprevent the execution of the laws, and to aid those who were in open\r\nrebellion against, and had made war upon it. Under these circumstances\r\nyour Commissioners did not deem it consistent with justice, or the\r\nrespect due to their own State, to give their assent to any of the\r\nproposed amendments, except that prohibiting the slave-trade--and even\r\nthat, in their opinion, was unnecessary, as no enlightened legislative\r\nbody would dare to propose to reëstablish that infamous traffic.\r\n\r\n_Third._--By the first section of the proposed amendments, slavery is\r\n_constitutionally_ established in all of the territory south of the\r\nline of 36° 30´, and all control over it by Congress or the\r\nterritorial legislatures is absolutely taken away during its\r\nterritorial condition. In effect, there is to be no law for slavery,\r\nits permanency and existence being provided for, except the will of\r\nthe master and the present odious slave code of New Mexico. These are\r\nfastened upon every inch of the soil of that immense region, beyond\r\neven the power of the people to remove them, however much they may\r\ndesire to do so, prior to the formation of a State government. Slavery\r\nmust therefore be the normal condition of the territory, while the\r\nState is in the process of formation and organization; and the\r\ninevitable result must be, that free labor and free institutions will\r\nbe excluded, and no free State formed within its limits. As the\r\nterritory was free from the blight of slavery when acquired, your\r\nCommissioners could not assent to its being changed into slave soil by\r\nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--The second section of the proposed amendments gives to the\r\nslave States an absolute negative upon the acquisition of free\r\nterritory in every possible mode by which it can be acquired; and in\r\ngiving reciprocally the same right to free States as to acquiring\r\nslave territory, also fetters the operations of the General Government\r\nboth in peace and war, depriving it to some extent of the exercise of\r\nperfect sovereignty, and at the same time sanctioning, and\r\nperpetuating in the organic law, an odious discrimination in favor of\r\nan institution peculiar to the slave States, and at variance with the\r\nhumane principles of the age. The free States do not need any such\r\nveto power in their favor, and the slave States would not demand it\r\nexcept to maintain and preserve for slavery a balance of power\r\nhitherto claimed, and to some extent exercised by them, for which they\r\nsecure by this amendment a constitutional perpetuation. No\r\nwell-founded objection seems to exist in regard to the acquisition of\r\nfree territory, unless it be that it is obtained in order to convert\r\nit into slave soil; and your Commissioners could not consent to give\r\nto a single interest, that of slavery, a negative upon such\r\nacquisitions. They have always regarded slavery as a local\r\ninstitution, depending solely upon the laws of the States in which it\r\nwas permitted for its existence; and they did not deem it expedient or\r\njust to recognize it as, or elevate it to, the rank of a positive\r\ngovernmental power, by clothing it with the right to interrupt one of\r\nthe ordinary and most essential functions of the Government. Slavery,\r\nexcept as a limited basis of representation, has now no political\r\npower or authority under the Constitution; the wise and good men who\r\nframed that instrument cautiously withheld it in all other respects;\r\nand your Commissioners find in the history of the aggressions of the\r\nslave interest, only additional reasons for confining it within its\r\noriginal limits.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._--To so much of the third article as declares that the\r\nConstitution nor any amendment of it, shall be so construed as to give\r\nCongress the power to regulate, abolish, or control slavery within any\r\nState, there was no objection, as it has never been seriously claimed\r\nthat any such power was given; but this provision is connected with so\r\nmany objectionable, not to say odious ones, that your Commissioners\r\nfelt themselves bound to vote against it. These surrender all the\r\npower of Congress over the District of Columbia, and over other places\r\nwithin its exclusive jurisdiction, in respect of slavery and its\r\nultimate extinction, however much the people of the United States in\r\nthe progress of civilization and humanity may desire it; and by the\r\nsixth section this provision is made unalterable without the consent\r\nof all the States. The influences produced by the existence of slavery\r\nat the National Capital, upon public men and public measures, are well\r\nknown; and while they may be tolerated, as they have been, without any\r\ndesire to exercise the power of eradicating the cause of the evil,\r\nstill a sound policy requires that the power should not be abandoned.\r\nConnected with this surrender of a well-defined and necessary power,\r\nare other provisions in regard to the transit of slaves through the\r\nfree States; in effect, permitting the carrying on of the internal\r\nslave-trade through these States, unless they pass laws forbidding it.\r\nThis trade through the free States is not made dependent upon the\r\nconsent of the States, but is made lawful without dissent; and the\r\nresult is, that if this amendment shall be adopted, every free State\r\nwill find it necessary to legislate for its exclusion, or to permit\r\nand regulate the transit by its own laws. These laws would be deemed\r\nodious by the slave States, and would produce dissatisfaction and\r\nirritation. Besides, in most of the free States, the normal legal\r\ncondition of every person is that of freedom; this constitutional\r\nprovision would at once change the local law of the State, and operate\r\nas a positive recognition of slavery in the absence of any new\r\nenactment. Thus, every free State would find itself compelled to adopt\r\na slave code, more or less extensive in its character, regulating or\r\nexcluding the inter-state slave-trade. Taking this in connection with\r\nthe fourth section, authorizing the States to legislate upon the\r\nsubject of fugitive slaves, and by their judicial and ministerial\r\nofficers to enforce their delivery, contrary to the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, which declares all such\r\ninterference on the part of the States unconstitutional, it is\r\napparent that the legislatures of all the free States would be beset\r\nby hordes of persons in the interest of the slave power for the\r\npassage of laws protecting slavery within their limits. No means,\r\nhowever impure, would be omitted to obtain them; and it is easy to see\r\nthat a slave code upon the subject of transit of fugitives, more or\r\nless stringent in its character, would soon find its way into every\r\nstatute book. When the States now free abolished slavery within their\r\nown limits, they intended to get rid of the evil entirely, not only in\r\npractice but as a necessity of legislation; these provisions compel a\r\nreturn to it, and involve the adoption of new laws for its regulation\r\nor exclusion.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ [Transcriber's Note: should be \"Sixth\"]--The sixth section\r\nmakes most of the amendments which give a constitutional protection to\r\nslavery, unalterable without the consent of all the States. It also\r\nincludes the second section of the fourth article, which provides that\r\n\"representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the\r\nseveral States according to their respective members,\" including\r\nthree-fifths of all slaves, &c.; and that portion of the fourth\r\narticle which requires the delivering up of fugitive slaves. Thus, a\r\npreference is given to the slave interest over every other; these may\r\nall be affected by a constitutional amendment, ratified or adopted by\r\nthree-fourths of the States; but the slave clauses are to remain,\r\nexcept by universal consent, fixed and immovable. No such protection\r\nis given to freedom; none to the property of free men, unless it be\r\nwhat is called property in slaves; none to the freedom of the press;\r\nnone to the religion of the citizen, or to the rights of conscience.\r\nThese rights, more sacred than any other, are deemed of less\r\nimportance, and are secured by less guarantees than the right to hold\r\na fellow man in bondage and to traffic in his flesh. Moreover, the\r\nthree-fifth representation of slaves, and only the same rate of direct\r\ntaxation, are perpetual by the same rigid provision. This not only\r\ngives to the slave States a representation of three-fifths of their\r\nslave property, but it secures to them an exemption from taxation on\r\nthe same property to the extent of two-fifths. But no property\r\nwhatever, in the free States constitutes a basis of representation,\r\nand all of it is liable to, and may be taxed. Unequal and unjust as\r\nwas this discrimination in favor of the slave States, still as it\r\nformed a part of the original Constitution, it should be maintained;\r\nbut when it is sought to extend it to new States, and to make it\r\nunchangeable without the consent of all the States, the attempt should\r\nbe resisted by every freeman. There are other property interests more\r\nimportant than that of slavery, but none of them have been so arrogant\r\nas to claim such exclusive privileges and perpetuation.\r\n\r\n_Finally._--Other objections of a grave character might be stated, but\r\nit is not deemed necessary. The great purpose of the Convention was to\r\namend the Constitution of the United States, so as to recognize and\r\nprotect slaves as property. As a direct proposition this was\r\nnegatived, but the same end was sought to be attained by indirect\r\nmeans, and its friends exulted in having accomplished it. Such is the\r\nobvious effect of these amendments. If adopted, slaves must everywhere\r\nin the Union be regarded as property, and entitled to the same legal\r\nprotection as other property. The necessary result will be, that all\r\nState laws forbidding the bringing of slaves within their limits, will\r\nbe void, the sovereignty of the States in that respect will be\r\ndestroyed, and the National Constitution will recognize and protect\r\nproperty in man.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that the people of the State of New York will, under\r\nany pressure of circumstances, however grave, recognize a claim so\r\nrepugnant to humanity, so hostile to freedom.\r\n\r\nWe commend to your honorable body the careful consideration of these\r\nproposed constitutional amendments. We believe that they will, if\r\nadopted, engraft upon our Constitution the odious doctrine of property\r\nin man; that they will extend slavery over a vast domain once free;\r\nthat they will change the whole spirit and character of our organic\r\nlaw, making that to protect and foster slavery which was intended to\r\nestablish freedom; making that irrevocable and perpetual which the\r\nframers of the instrument intended should be temporary.\r\n\r\nDAVID DUDLEY FIELD,\r\nWM.

FIELD.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows why the vote of New York was not given\r\nupon the first question taken in the Peace Convention, on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of February. The Journal represents the vote as\r\ndivided. _It was not divided._ The vote was ordered to be cast, _and\r\nshould have been cast_ in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the day preceding, a message came to me from the clerk of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, that the Court was waiting for\r\nme in a case which had stood upon the docket since December, 1859, and\r\nwas now for the first time reached in its order. The case was of great\r\nimportance, for upon its result depended the closing or reopening of a\r\nlitigation which I had conducted for nineteen years, which had\r\nembraced in its different forms more than eighty suits, and in the\r\ncourse of which the Courts of the State and of the United States had\r\ncome into direct conflict. All the tribunals of the State of New York,\r\nwhere the question had been raised, had decided against my clients.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, by a majority of two, had once\r\ndecided in their favor.\r\n\r\nThe present case was to determine whether the Court would adhere to\r\nits former decision. The stake of my clients was therefore immense,\r\nand I was their only counsel.\r\n\r\nThe case being called after my arrival in Court, the Chief Justice\r\nobserved that, as it was too late to begin that day, the argument\r\nwould proceed first the next morning, at eleven o'clock, unless the\r\nAttorney-General should claim precedence in another case. Then,\r\nthinking that the Convention would close its business during the day,\r\nI hastened back, and the question being soon taken, I cast the vote of\r\nthe State against the proposition before the Convention, and it was\r\nrejected by 11 to 8.\r\n\r\nA reconsideration was moved and carried, and an adjournment taken to\r\nhalf-past seven in the evening. At that hour I returned to the\r\nConvention, but to my disappointment, and in spite of my efforts, it\r\nadjourned to the next morning at ten o'clock, a majority of my\r\nassociates voting for the adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I endeavored to procure a meeting of the delegation\r\nbefore ten o'clock, that I might obtain a formal instruction to the\r\nChairman in my absence to cast a vote of the State against the\r\nproposed amendments. Not being able, however, to obtain the earlier\r\nattendance of all the members, I waited till they appeared in the hall\r\nof the Convention, and there, shortly before eleven o'clock, I called\r\nthem together, and, all being present, a resolution, in contemplation\r\nof my absence, was moved and carried, that \"the Chairman declare that\r\nNew York voted No on each section.\" Thereupon requesting Mr. King to\r\nact as temporary Chairman in my absence, and when New York was called\r\nto cast the vote in the negative, pursuant to the resolution, I left\r\nthe hall and drove to the Capitol as rapidly as possible, that I might\r\nbe present at the opening of the Court.\r\n\r\nWas it reasonable, nay, was it possible, that I should do otherwise?\r\nIt is known to be a rule of the Supreme Court not to postpone an\r\nargument for other engagements of counsel. If neither counsel is\r\npresent, the case goes to the foot of the docket, to be reached again\r\nonly after two or three years; if one of the counsel only appears, he\r\nmakes an oral argument, and a printed brief is submitted on the other\r\nside. In my view, it would have been trifling with the rights of my\r\nclients either to submit their case on a printed brief or to postpone\r\nit for two years. I had no one to send to the Court in my place. To\r\ndespatch a letter with an excuse was a liberty I did not feel\r\njustified in taking, and if taken, it might fail of its object, as the\r\nCourt, when informed of the circumstances, must have believed that no\r\nmember of the delegation would take advantage of my absence if he\r\ncould, and that he could not if he would, since the vote had been\r\nalready determined in a meeting of the delegation, and that\r\ndetermination could not be reconsidered or changed without the\r\ndesertion to the minority of one of the majority.\r\n\r\nBut whatever might be the opinion of others, my duty appeared to\r\nmyself extremely plain. There was nothing to be done in the Convention\r\nbut the merely ministerial duty of declaring what had already been\r\ndetermined, which duty could certainly be performed by another as\r\nwell as myself, while, on the other hand, no one but myself could act\r\nin Court for my clients. It is true that some of my associates\r\nexpressed to me their apprehension that the minority might appeal to\r\nthe Convention, and that the Convention might arbitrarily overrule the\r\ndelegation; but I answered them as I repeat now, that neither the\r\nminority of the delegation nor the Convention itself had any right to\r\ninterpose. We were not asking a favor, but exercising a right. Whether\r\na person not present could vote was not the question. Persons did not\r\nvote except on unimportant questions and by general consent. States\r\nvoted; the vote of each State was delivered by its Chairman, who\r\ncollected the voices of his delegation and announced the result. There\r\nwas nothing in the reason of the thing, nothing in any rule or usage\r\nof the Convention, which required the voices of the delegation to be\r\ncollected at the instant of announcing the result. They might be\r\ncollected one minute beforehand, or, as in the present instance, ten\r\nminutes, or twice ten minutes. All that could be required was, that\r\neach member should give his own judgment upon the particular\r\nproposition, and the sum of these judgments it was the sole province\r\nof the Chairman to make known. There could be no occasion for their\r\nstanding by his side while he performed this duty unless he needed\r\ntheir support or they feared his weakness.\r\n\r\nI have said that there was no rule of the Convention which ordered the\r\nmatter otherwise; on the contrary, the rule as to the mode of\r\nvoting--the 18th--was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"18. MODE OF VOTING: All votes shall be taken by States, and\r\n     each State to give one vote. The yeas and nays of the\r\n     members shall not be taken, or published--only the decision\r\n     by States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of February, Mr. Dent, of Maryland, moved the\r\nadoption of the following rule:\r\n\r\n     \"When the vote on any question is taken by States, any\r\n     Commissioner dissenting from the vote of his State may have\r\n     his dissent entered on the journal.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, of Ohio, offered the following as a substitute for Mr.\r\nDent's rule.\r\n\r\n     \"The yeas and nays of the Commissioners of each State, upon\r\n     any question, shall be entered upon the Journal, when it is\r\n     desired by any Commissioner; and the vote of each State\r\n     shall be determined by the majority of Commissioners present\r\n     from each State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's substitute was rejected, and Mr. Dent's rule adopted.\r\n\r\nThe usage of the Convention may be understood by a single example. The\r\nMaine delegation consisted of her two Senators and six members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives. One member only attended for the greater\r\npart of the Convention, and cast the vote of the State. Indeed it was\r\na frequent practice for members to absent themselves and leave their\r\nassociates to act for them.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York had, moreover, decided for herself in what\r\nmanner her Commissioners should speak for her, by declaring in the\r\njoint resolution of the Senate and Assembly that they should cast\r\ntheir \"votes to be determined by a majority of their number,\" not the\r\nmajority of those who should happen to be present at a particular\r\ninstant on the floor of the Convention, but a majority of the whole\r\nnumber. Suppose, upon a question being put, the delegation had met for\r\nconsultation, and by a formal resolution determined that the vote of\r\nthe State be No; then, instructing their Chairman to cast the vote\r\naccordingly, had separated, and all but the Chairman retired from the\r\nhall, could he thereupon have changed the vote to Aye, because he\r\ndisagreed with the majority and alone remained on the floor? Or could\r\nthe Convention have refused this vote of the State? And if not, how\r\nis that question different from the one here?\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, I must think with good reason, assumed by me when I\r\nleft the hall, that if the question should be put in my absence, which\r\nby the way I considered uncertain, as the debate then going on might\r\nlast for hours, and I hoped still to find some means of deferring my\r\nargument to the next day, I might certainly depend on the vote of New\r\nYork being declared again as it had been declared before, never\r\ndoubting for a moment the ability and the will of my associates to\r\ndefend against all opposition the rights of the State, their own\r\nrights, and mine.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at the Court I did not succeed in my desire to defer my\r\nargument to the next day; but had I done so, it would have made no\r\ndifference, as the vote in the Convention must have been called before\r\nI reached the Capitol.\r\n\r\nWhat occurred in my absence I can only know from report. Five\r\ndifferent statements are given: one by Mr. King in a published letter,\r\nanother by the secretary of the delegation in the minutes kept by him,\r\nthe third by the chairman of the Massachusetts delegation, who had the\r\nbest opportunity to observe what was passing, the fourth by the\r\nsecretary in a correspondence with me, and the fifth in the published\r\nJournal of the Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. King's statement of what occurred in my absence is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The vote on the amendment soon followed, and before New\r\n     York was called I asked my colleagues what vote should be\r\n     given, and the reply was that in the absence of Mr. Field\r\n     the vote was divided. Nevertheless, I stated the case to the\r\n     Convention, and asked permission to cast the vote as before.\r\n     This was objected to by one of the Commissioners of the\r\n     minority, and permission having been refused by the\r\n     Convention, by direction of my colleagues when the State was\r\n     called I answered that the vote was divided.\"\r\n\r\nThe other statements are subjoined, and numbered, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\r\n\r\nFrom a comparison of these statements it appears.\r\n\r\n_First:_ That the direction given to Mr. King, when the whole\r\ndelegation were together, regularly convened, in contemplation of my\r\nabsence, was to \"declare that New York voted No.\"\r\n\r\n_Second:_ That instead of confining himself to that duty, he began\r\nimmediately upon my departure, and before the vote was demanded, to\r\nask anew, \"what vote should be given?\" and when the vote was demanded,\r\ninstead of voting No, \"stated the case to the Convention, and asked\r\npermission to cast the vote as before.\"\r\n\r\n_Third:_ That Mr. King's colleagues, though they had just resolved, in\r\nexpectation of my absence, that he should \"declare that New York voted\r\nNo,\" yet \"before New York was called,\" and of course before any\r\nintimation from the Convention or its President, in answer to his\r\nquestion, \"What vote shall be given?\" replied, \"that in Mr. Field's\r\nabsence, the vote was divided,\" and directed him so to declare.\r\n\r\n_Fourth:_ That the Convention never \"decided that no person could vote\r\nwho was not present.\" Whatever was done, was done between the\r\ndelegation and Mr. Tyler. No order was taken by the Convention, but,\r\non the contrary, the objection on the part of the minority of the\r\ndelegation was that \"the Convention had no control or authority in the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nWhat caused this departure from the course of proceedings prescribed\r\nby the resolution does not clearly appear. The delegation did not\r\nrescind the resolution; the Convention did not reverse it. I do not\r\nunderstand that my associates consider it a nullity--certainly they\r\ncould not have so considered it when it was passed. I have not\r\nsufficient evidence that they changed their minds within ten minutes,\r\nor that they have changed them yet. That the resolution was not a\r\nnullity, but an authoritative act, binding upon every member of the\r\ndelegation, until duly reconsidered, I believed then, and believe\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nI submit, therefore, that my reason for attending court, at its\r\nopening, was not only sufficient but imperative; and if I had not\r\nyielded to it, I should have incurred the reproach of my clients, and\r\nthe censure of all right-thinking men; that before I left the\r\nConvention, I did not only all that could have been done, but all that\r\nwas necessary, to make the vote of New York certain against the\r\nproposed amendments of the Constitution; and that the omission to\r\nrecord the vote of New York as it was ordered, was owing not to any\r\nact or omission of mine, but to the efforts of the minority of the\r\ndelegation, or some of them, to prevent an expression of the opinion\r\nof the majority, and to the failure of my associates of the majority\r\nto execute in my absence what had been resolved when I was present.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly with regret that I write this note. My preference was\r\nfor a statement in which we all could join, but my associates refused\r\nto enter into any joint relation of the facts.\r\n\r\nI hope, also, it will not be inferred from any thing I have written,\r\nthat I do not regret the omission to record New York as voting against\r\nwhat appeared to me an unwise and pernicious proposition. Though the\r\nimportance of the vote has been greatly magnified, and the result in\r\nmy opinion would not have been different if the vote of New York had\r\nbeen counted, as I believe some of the States not voting would, if\r\nnecessary, have voted in the affirmative; and even if it had been\r\notherwise, I think the action of the Convention was of no importance\r\nwhatever; yet, I should wish this State, of which we are so proud, to\r\nappear always, even in a matter of ceremony, on the side of Freedom;\r\never loyal to the Constitution as it is, but against placing there a\r\nguaranty to slavery beyond the guarantees of our fathers.\r\n\r\nDAVID DUDLEY FIELD.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _March 20th, 1861._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI.--_Extract from the Minutes of the New York Delegation, kept by\r\ntheir Secretary._\r\n\r\n\"WEDNESDAY, _February 27th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\"New York delegation met in the room, and Mr. Wadsworth moved that the\r\nNew York delegation vote No on each of the sections of the committee's\r\nreport.

To this one of the Commissioners, Mr. Corning I think it\r\nwas, objected, saying that the vote of New York was to be given as her\r\nCommissioners who were present should decide, and that the Convention\r\nhad no control or authority in the matter. Some conversation was then\r\nhad between the Commissioners who favored and those who opposed the\r\npending proposition, which I did not hear with sufficient distinctness\r\nto understand, and in a minute or two Governor King announced that the\r\nvote of New York was divided.\r\n\r\n\"This is the substance of what occurred, so far as I observed it.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, your friend,\r\n\r\n\"J.Z.

Field, to the report of the majority of the Commissioners to the\r\nConference Convention at Washington, respecting his absence on the\r\nfinal vote in that body, on the proposed amendments to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The fact of his absence is\r\nadmitted by Mr. Field, and attempted to be defended at great length,\r\nbut Mr. Field has omitted to state that, by the 14th Rule of the\r\nConvention, \"no member should be absent from the Convention, so as to\r\ninterrupt the representation of the State, without leave.\" Mr. Field\r\nneither asked nor obtained leave of absence, and hence, under the\r\nrule, he failed to discharge his duty, both to the Convention and his\r\ncolleagues. Mr. Field does not state that he made any application to\r\nthe court for a temporary postponement of his case, in view of the\r\nimportant vote then about to be taken in Convention. But, on the\r\ncontrary, argues to show that his duty to his client was paramount to\r\nhis duty as Commissioner of the State of New York, in a question\r\ninvolving constitutional principles. After Mr. Field had stated, in\r\nthe presence of his colleagues in the Convention, that he was obliged\r\nto go immediately to the Supreme Court of the United States, he was\r\nurged by those who agreed with him in opinion, to remain, and give the\r\nvote of the State against the proposed amendments, and was repeatedly\r\ntold that his absence would divide the vote; this was so stated to\r\nhim, by the minority of the Commissioners, and that it would be so\r\nclaimed by them before the Convention. He refused to remain, and with\r\nthe full knowledge of the effect of his absence on the question about\r\nto be taken, he left the Convention, and thus defeated the vote of his\r\nState. We who remained in our places, felt deeply the embarrassment,\r\nand the remarks which were made in consequence of Mr. Field's\r\nwithdrawal. We had steadily, up to that time, sustained with him, our\r\nown, and what we believed to be the sentiment of the State, in favor\r\nof freedom, and were, therefore, entirely unprepared for such a\r\ndetermination on his part. Nor is our surprise lessened by the manner\r\nand the certificates by which he has at great length attempted to\r\ndefend his course on this occasion. The vote of New York was not\r\ndeclared until after the vote which had been previously taken in its\r\ndelegation had been stated, nor until an appeal had been made to the\r\nConvention, and refused by its President, to enable his colleagues to\r\nprotect its vote in the absence of the Chairman of the delegation. By\r\nhis absence the vote of New York stood 5 to 5, and it was under the\r\ndecision of the Convention alone, that the vote was declared to be\r\ndivided. Mr. Field has stated that the omission to record the vote of\r\nNew York against the amendments was not owing to any act or omission\r\nof his, but to the efforts of the minority of the delegation, or some\r\nof them, to prevent the expression of the opinion of the majority. The\r\nobjection was made after notice to him that it would be made, and the\r\nConvention sustained it, hence the vote was lost by his absence. Nor\r\nis the opinion of Mr. Field entitled to consideration when he imputes\r\nto the majority a want of fidelity to him, in not claiming and\r\nadhering to the vote which had been taken when all were present, and\r\nwhich was afterwards rendered null, by his absence. They did adhere to\r\nit, and endeavored to cast the vote accordingly. It was his duty to\r\nhave been present, and to have thus given effect to that which had\r\nbeen previously agreed to. Mr. Field states, and truly, that his\r\ncolleagues refused to unite in a joint relation of the facts of the\r\ncase. They refused, because they were not satisfied with his course,\r\nand would not be responsible for it in any way. Up to the moment of\r\nhis leaving the Convention, Mr. Field had manifested great zeal and\r\nability in sustaining and defending the principles which a majority of\r\nthe delegation desired to advocate, and his failure at the last, and\r\ndecisive vote, was as unexpected as it was indefensible.\r\n\r\nJOHN A.

SMITH.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _March 28th, 1861._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the Legislature of the State of New York:_\r\n\r\nInformed by the newspapers of this morning that five of my associates\r\nin the Peace Convention, after waiting nearly three weeks, made\r\nyesterday to the Legislature a communication purporting to be an\r\nanswer to the note which I thought it my duty to append to the report,\r\nexplaining why the vote of New York was not given at a particular\r\ntime, I beg leave to submit the following in reply:\r\n\r\nI do not perceive that my associates impugn a single statement of fact\r\ncontained in my note. My engagement in Court, the importance of the\r\nengagement, the necessity for my keeping it, the meeting of the\r\ndelegation in contemplation of it, their resolution directing how the\r\nvote should be cast in my absence, the neglect so to cast it, are all,\r\nby silence, admitted. Nor do I perceive any denial of the proposition\r\nthat the delegation had a right to pass the resolution, which thus\r\nbecame binding on all its members until reconsidered and reversed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to make one exception to this use of admissions. My\r\nassociates apparently wish to have it believed, yet hesitate to\r\nassert, that the Convention made a decision respecting the right to\r\nvote. In one place they say, \"that an appeal had been made to the\r\nConvention, and refused by its President;\" in another, that \"it was\r\nunder the decision of the Convention alone that the vote was declared\r\nto be divided;\" and in a third, that the objection of the minority was\r\nmade after notice to me that it would be made, and the \"Convention\r\nsustained it, hence the vote was lost,\" by my absence. They should\r\nhave reflected that there could have been no \"decision of the\r\nConvention\" if the appeal to it was \"refused by its President.\" The\r\ntruth beyond question is, that although my associates imagined that\r\nthe Convention decided something, it did in fact decide nothing.\r\n\r\nMy associates say further, that I argue to show that my duty to my\r\nclient was paramount to my \"duty as Commissioner of the State of New\r\nYork, in a question involving constitutional principles.\" This is an\r\nidle calumny. My note can be read as well as theirs; and in general\r\nwill be read by the same persons, and there is not a word in it to\r\njustify or excuse their assertion. I never thus argued. I claimed that\r\nI had two duties to perform, and that I performed both. I did not\r\nclaim that my duty to my State was subordinate to any other duty\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nWhen my associates assert that their Chairman left the Convention\r\n\"with full knowledge of the effect of his absence on the vote about to\r\nbe taken,\" if they mean that I knew or supposed that they intended to\r\nreverse their own action, or that Mr. King would not announce the vote\r\nas it had been resolved, or would declare the vote divided, or that\r\nthey would support him in it, or that the Convention would overrule\r\nthe delegation, then they assert what they could not know to be true,\r\nand what is not true in fact. My note sets forth what I was told, and\r\nwhat I replied.\r\n\r\nMy associates argue that I failed to discharge my duty, because I did\r\nnot obtain leave of the Convention before going into the Supreme\r\nCourt. Though I do not remember to have heard before of leave granted\r\nby a deliberative body to a member to go out for half an hour, or for\r\none or two hours, I will observe, by this Convention absence was\r\nexpressly allowed, if it did not \"interrupt the representation of the\r\nState.\" My associates do indeed claim that, when I left the hall, the\r\nState ceased to be represented, ten Commissioners only remaining\r\nbehind. The argument of this strange position appears to be, that a\r\nState is not represented when its vote can be divided, and that the\r\nvote of New York was divided. Here is a double fallacy. To say that\r\nthe vote was divided, begs the question. It was not divided so long as\r\nthe resolution passed by the delegation remained valid, and its\r\nvalidity is not denied. The other part of the proposition is equally\r\nfallacious. A State is represented when there are in the body\r\ndelegates authorized to represent it, whatever be their number. The\r\narguments of my associates seem to be, that a State could only be\r\nrepresented in the Peace Convention by odd numbers, and that if it\r\nsent eight or ten representatives, it would have no representatives at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut what shall I say to the following sentences:--\"Nor is the opinion\r\nof Mr. Field entitled to consideration, when he imputes to the\r\nmajority a want of fidelity to him, in not claiming and adhering to\r\nthe vote which had been taken when all were present, and which was\r\nafterwards rendered null by his absence. They did adhere to it, and\r\nendeavored to cast the vote accordingly. It was his duty to have been\r\npresent, and to have thus given effect to that which had been\r\npreviously agreed to.\" Would any one imagine that the authors were\r\nspeaking of a vote, given in expectation of my absence, and to\r\ndetermine what should be done when I was away? The vote was taken\r\nbecause I was to be absent, and directed the Chairman how to act in\r\nthat event, but it is nevertheless pretended that the moment I became\r\nabsent, the vote became null. They might better have said that the\r\nvote would have become null, or rather that there would have been no\r\noccasion for it in case of my continued presence. Then they say that\r\nthey adhered to it. How did they adhere? The resolution directed the\r\nChairman to cast the vote in the negative. He did not obey the\r\nresolution. His associates and mine did not insist that he should.\r\nNobody prevented his answering \"no,\" when the vote was called. No\r\nreason has ever been given for his not so answering. That he should\r\ninstead have entered voluntarily into a discussion with Mr. Tyler on\r\nthe subject, and that his associates should have looked quietly on,\r\ncan only be accounted for by supposing them indifferent or bewildered.\r\n\r\nIt is not an agreeable task to write thus of old friends; but I must\r\ndefend myself when attacked, and defence cannot always be made\r\npleasant to an assailant.\r\n\r\nMy late friends profess to think me responsible for the loss of the\r\nvote of New York on a certain occasion. I think them responsible for\r\nit. Which side is right the Legislature and the people of the State\r\nwill judge.\r\n\r\nDAVID DUDLEY FIELD.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _April 11th, 1861._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Report of a Minority of the Commissioners of New York._\r\n\r\nIN SENATE, _March 25th, 1861._\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, constituting a minority of the Commissioners,\r\nappointed by the Legislature of the State of New York, under\r\nresolutions responsive to those of the State of Virginia, referred to\r\nin the report of the majority of the Commissioners of said State of\r\nNew York, admitting the correctness of the record of the proceedings\r\npresented by said majority, but differing from them in much of the\r\nreasoning which they present, respectfully report:\r\n\r\nThat they entered upon the duties assigned to them, earnestly desiring\r\nto carry out the patriotic spirit of said resolutions as therein\r\nexpressed, which said original resolutions are herein embodied as a\r\npart of this report:\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS _appointing Commissioners from this State to\r\nmeet Commissioners from other States at Washington, on invitation of\r\nVirginia._\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the State of Virginia, by resolutions of her General\r\nAssembly, passed the nineteenth instant, has invited such of the\r\nslaveholding and non-slaveholding States as are willing to unite with\r\nher, to meet at Washington, on the fourth of February next, to\r\nconsider, and if practicable, agree on some suitable adjustment of our\r\nnational difficulties; and whereas, the people of New York, while they\r\nhold the opinion that the Constitution of the United States, as it is,\r\ncontains all needful guarantees for the rights of the States, are\r\nnevertheless ready, at all times, to confer with their brethren upon\r\nall alleged grievances; and to do all that can justly be required of\r\nthem to allay discontent; therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That David Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S.\r\nWadsworth, James C. Smith, Amaziah B. James, Erastus Corning, Addison\r\nGardner, Greene C. Bronson, Wm. E. Dodge, Ex-Governor John A. King,\r\nand Major-General John E. Wool, be and are hereby appointed\r\nCommissioners on the part of this State, to meet Commissioners from\r\nother States, in the City of Washington, on the fourth day of February\r\nnext, or so soon thereafter as Commissioners shall be appointed by a\r\nmajority of the States of the Union, to confer with them upon the\r\ncomplaints of any part of the country, and to suggest such remedies\r\ntherefor as to them shall seem fit and proper; but the said\r\nCommissioners shall at all times be subject to the control of this\r\nLegislature, and shall cast five votes to be determined by a majority\r\nof their number.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in thus acceding to the request of Virginia, it is\r\nnot to be understood that this Legislature approve of the propositions\r\nsubmitted by the General Assembly of that State, or concede the\r\npropriety of their adoption by the proposed Convention. But while\r\nadhering to the position she has heretofore occupied, New York will\r\nnot reject an invitation to a conference, which, by bringing together\r\nthe men of both sections, holds out the possibility of an honorable\r\nsettlement of our national difficulties, and the restoration of peace\r\nand harmony to the country.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Governor be requested to transmit a copy of the\r\nforegoing resolutions to the Executives of the several States, and\r\nalso to the President of the United States, and to inform the\r\nCommissioners without delay of their appointment.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the foregoing resolutions be transmitted to the\r\nhonorable the Senate, with a request that they concur therein.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing resolutions were passed in the House of Assembly by a\r\nvote of seventy-three ayes to thirty-nine noes, and in the Senate by a\r\nvote of nineteen to twelve, those in the negative, in both Houses,\r\nbeing all members of the dominant party, and those in the affirmative\r\ncomposed of the members of the opposition, and of those Republicans\r\nwho were supposed to be prepared to meet the State of Virginia and\r\nother sister States, in the spirit of the resolutions adopted by the\r\nStates of Virginia and New York.\r\n\r\nA single point in the record, to which reference has been made,\r\nrequires some consideration before proceeding to the reasoning of a\r\nmajority of the Commissioners upon the propositions finally adopted by\r\nthe Convention. The majority of the Commissioners state that most of\r\nsaid majority were opposed to the submission by the Convention of any\r\namendments of the Constitution of the United States at the present\r\ntime, and in the present excited state of the public mind.\r\n\r\nNot only was that ground assumed by a majority of the New York\r\nCommissioners, but some of their number argued with great ability\r\nagainst the danger of touching that sacred instrument, consecrated by\r\nmemories so dear to every patriot heart.\r\n\r\nThe propositions, presented as amendments, were clear and\r\ndistinct--their adoption would in no manner disturb the general\r\nharmony of the Constitution; yet, strangely enough, to an ordinary\r\nmind, the majority of the Commissioners who found such danger in\r\nadopting the specific amendments proposed, voted with a united action\r\nfor a General Convention to remodel the entire Constitution--exposed\r\nto all the hazards that must attend such a Convention--by whose action\r\na form of government might be presented, in which could not be found a\r\nsingle trace of that Constitution for which they professed such high\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will now consider the reasons presented by a majority\r\nof the Commissioners against the proposition: The majority declare\r\nthat the Convention would not listen to, much less adopt any\r\namendments in the interests of freedom, or of free labor, or of the\r\nrights of citizens of the free States, the only one of that character,\r\nthat in relation to the securing to the citizens of each State the\r\nprivileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States, &c.,\r\n&c. As the undersigned have no recollection of the propositions to\r\nwhich reference would seem to be made, other than that embraced in the\r\nlast clause, which they have quoted, they would call the attention of\r\nthe people of the State of New York to this subject, as one deeply\r\ninteresting in its character, and upon which it is supposed that there\r\nis very little difference of opinion. As this statement is thrown out\r\nby a majority of the Commissioners, in a manner to carry a belief that\r\nthe harsh and cruel enactments which deprive colored citizens of the\r\nNorth of the privileges they claim in Southern States under the\r\nConstitution, it may be well for our people to consider that such\r\nenactments are not confined to the States fostering the institution of\r\nslavery, but exist and are enforced in some States making peculiar\r\nclaim to love for freedom and the rights of man. The State of Illinois\r\nhas a code of laws against free colored persons, citizens of other\r\nStates, as severe as those of South Carolina or Louisiana. These laws\r\nhave been recently enforced, and yet the North does not hear one word\r\nof the wrongs inflicted upon colored citizens of other States found\r\nwithin the borders of Illinois.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the Constitution first presented by the\r\nState of Oregon, contained a clause prohibiting free colored persons\r\nfrom residing within that State. That Constitution received the votes\r\nof both the Senators from New York--each expressing his views of that\r\ninstrument, yet the public censure has not fallen upon either of those\r\ngentlemen, by reason of such action. Nor is it necessary to go beyond\r\nthe election polls of this State, claiming its fifty thousand majority\r\nfor the cause of freedom and of equal rights--and yet counting from\r\nthe ballot box an hundred thousand majority against securing the\r\nprivilege of suffrage to colored persons, upon the same conditions\r\nthat it is secured to whites. These facts are presented with the hope\r\nthat they may create a spirit of charity in the public mind toward\r\nthose States whose peculiar position renders such harsh legislation\r\ncertainly not more censurable than it is in free States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned differ entirely from the majority of the\r\nCommissioners, as to the action of the Convention upon subjects\r\ninteresting to the North. It is known to all that Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nand it is believed all the Southern Border States instructed their\r\ndelegates to insist on the Crittenden propositions, a material feature\r\nof which was, that in all future acquired territory, south of 36° 30´,\r\nslavery should be permitted; and yet when this material clause was\r\nfound repugnant to the Northern sentiment, a distinguished\r\nCommissioner from Maryland moved to limit it to _present_ territory,\r\nwhich proposition was adopted. Surely this was an important surrender\r\nto Northern sentiment that should not have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe majority say, that by the first of the proposed amendments,\r\nslavery is constitutionally established in all the territory south of\r\nthe line of 36° 30´, as if such recognition of slavery there was now\r\nfor the first time to be established by the proposed amendment. The\r\nmajority of these Commissioners are counsellors of eminent ability,\r\nand yet, for some reason not easily comprehended, they have seen fit\r\nto ignore a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which\r\ndeclares that slavery can be carried into all the Territories of the\r\nUnited States, whether south or north of the line of 36° 30´. The\r\nfamous Dred Scott decision, to which reference is here made, was often\r\nreferred to in the debates of the Convention, and was insisted upon by\r\nmany gentlemen, holding views and opinions similar to those of a\r\nmajority of the New York Commissioners, as affording all the\r\nprotection that the South could require, and claiming that the\r\nproposed amendment was unnecessary, by reason of such protection.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of New Mexico was declared open to slavery by the\r\ncompromise act of 1850. The public mind of the North was deeply\r\nagitated upon that subject. A distinguished statesman, who was removed\r\nfrom earth before his eyes were forced \"to rest upon a dismembered\r\nConfederacy,\" was violently assailed for declaring that slavery could\r\nwork no practical evil in New Mexico; and yet the recent census has\r\nvindicated that assertion, showing that in the ten years that have\r\npassed since that compromise, only twenty-four slaves were to be found\r\nin what the majority of the committee are pleased to call the \"immense\r\nregion\" of New Mexico; more than half of whom were servants of army\r\nofficers, to be removed when they should be ordered to other stations.\r\n\r\nThe Territorial Legislature of New Mexico has declared the existence\r\nand passed laws for the protection of slavery throughout that entire\r\nTerritory, while the proposed amendment of the Constitution would\r\nexclude it from all that portion of said Territory north of 36° 30´.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned are not only ready to vindicate their votes for that\r\nproposed amendment, but claim that such an amendment to the\r\nConstitution would be a great gain to the cause of freedom; taking\r\nfrom the action of the Dred Scott decision, and of the Territorial\r\nLegislation, all territory north of 36° 30´; and they challenge a\r\ncomparison of their votes, with the course of those who preferred to\r\nleave this question subject to the action of that decision, and to the\r\nlegislation to which reference is made.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ section of the proposed amendments, touching the future\r\nacquisition of territory, met the approval of the undersigned, as\r\ncertainly not less important to the North than to the South. The\r\nhistory of our country shows how hastily the assumed powers of\r\nCongress have been exercised upon this question, and at this moment\r\npresents a startling example, of a State of vast territory, acquired\r\nby a joint resolution of Congress, sustained at an enormous expense,\r\nand now withdrawing from the Confederacy, seizing upon and applying to\r\nits own use all the Government property found within its borders.\r\nEvery reflecting citizen can determine for himself where there is the\r\nmost danger to the cause of humanity, and whether territory is more\r\nprobably to be acquired from the North, and consecrated to freedom, or\r\nfrom the Southwest, upon which these exciting contests might be\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nThis proposed amendment is presented with entire confidence for the\r\ndecision of our people.\r\n\r\nAs the majority of the Commissioners do not dissent from the general\r\nprinciples of the _third_ article, but object to some of its\r\nprovisions, the undersigned would remark that the principal difference\r\nbetween them and the majority would seem to be whether Congress shall\r\nbe denied the power of abolishing Slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nwithout the consent of Maryland and without the consent of the owners,\r\nor making the owners who do not consent just compensation. Ever since\r\nthe formation of the Government, this has been a subject upon which\r\nthe friends of freedom have been divided. In the opinion of the\r\nundersigned, this question should be permanently settled.\r\n\r\nThe power of removing slaves from one section of the country to\r\nanother, is secured by this section, but cannot be exercised against\r\nthe wishes of the State through which slaves would otherwise be taken.\r\nThe power to touch at ports, shores, and landings, with vessels having\r\non board persons held in bondage, and of landing, in case of distress,\r\nis embraced in this proposed amendment, the latter clause of which\r\nwill, certainly, receive the approval of every friend of humanity. The\r\nundersigned do not join in the fears expressed by the majority, that a\r\nresort to \"impure means\" could ever secure from the Legislature of New\r\nYork any laws upon these subjects, not entirely consistent with the\r\nhonor and dignity of the State.\r\n\r\nThe _Fourth_ proposition was adopted by a vote so large as to make\r\ncomment here unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAs the _Fifth_ proposition received the unanimous vote of your\r\nCommissioners, it requires no comment.\r\n\r\nThe _Sixth_ proposition is upon a subject that has been discussed ever\r\nsince the formation of the Government, and need not be dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nThe _Seventh_ proposition presented itself with such force to the\r\nConvention as to receive a strong vote, but seven States declaring\r\nagainst it. It will be seen that this section requires Congress to\r\nprovide by law for securing to citizens of each State the privileges\r\nand immunities of citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\nMany other propositions were presented to the Convention, some of\r\nwhich received the full concurrence of the undersigned; to others they\r\nwere opposed, and those who shared in the deliberations of the\r\nConvention do not doubt, and will not deny, that propositions were\r\npresented whose only object and effect could be to embarrass its\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Convention failed to secure at the hands of Congress\r\nthe legislation necessary to present it to the people of the different\r\nStates, in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. Still it is in\r\nthe power, and the undersigned trust will be in the disposition of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of New York, in both Halls of its\r\nLegislation, to present them for the acceptance or rejection of her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of political opinion may exist, there can be but\r\none mind as to the present critical condition of our country, or that\r\nit is the duty of every citizen to give all the aid in his power, to\r\nsustain an administration that has entered upon its complicated duties\r\nunder circumstances of more embarrassment than have ever before\r\nexisted in our country's history.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned not only as deeply regret, but as severely condemn,\r\nthe action of those States who have attempted to withdraw from the\r\nUnion, as do the majority of the Commissioners who opposed the\r\nadoption of the measures of conciliation presented by the Peace\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nThose who are conversant with the political action of the seceding\r\nStates, will have observed how strong is their desire to draw the\r\nSouthern Border States into this new Confederacy. With each of those\r\nBorder States are large bodies of active politicians, constantly\r\ninfluencing the public mind, and misrepresenting, to a great extent,\r\nthe opinions and designs of those who have wrought out this revolution\r\nin the national administration. The public mind is fearfully agitated\r\nupon these issues, and the refusal of the Legislature of New York to\r\npresent the propositions of the Peace Convention, for the suffrages of\r\nher people, will greatly diminish the power of the Union men of the\r\nBorder States to sustain themselves in their present trying position.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Virginia is about to submit these propositions to\r\nher people; let New York, who so nobly responded to the call of\r\nVirginia, show that she, too, will be governed by the wishes of _her_\r\npeople, and that if those ties which have so long held these powerful\r\nStates in the bonds of brotherhood, must be severed, it shall be done\r\nonly by the verdict of their people as recorded in the ballot box.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS GRANGER,\r\nERASTUS CORNING,\r\nGREENE C.

DODGE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Report of the Rhode Island Peace Commissioners._\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island:_\r\n\r\nThe undersigned Commissioners on the part of this State, appointed\r\nupon the request of the State of Virginia, to meet Commissioners from\r\nthe other States to confer upon the best mode of adjusting the unhappy\r\ndifferences which now disturb the peace of the country, respectfully\r\nbeg leave to report:\r\n\r\nThat on the 4th day of February last, at Washington, the day and place\r\nnamed for the opening of the Conference, they met Commissioners from\r\nother States, and remained with them in conference until the 27th day\r\nof February, at which time twenty-one States were represented, when\r\nhaving agreed by a majority of States to submit to Congress, to be by\r\nCongress submitted to conventions in the several States, the annexed\r\narticle in amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the\r\nConvention finally adjourned.\r\n\r\nThis article, it will be seen, applies the old line of 36° 30´ of\r\nNorth latitude to all the present Territory of the United States,\r\nprohibiting slavery north of that line, whilst it recognizes and\r\nsecures its existence south of that line during the territorial\r\ngovernment, and provides for the formation of new States out of such\r\nterritory with or without slavery as their constitutions may direct.\r\n\r\nAs this partition of territory was not disadvantageous, at least to\r\nthe free States, as it disposed of the agitation consequent upon a\r\nrecent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon a\r\ncelebrated case, and followed a precedent which had given peace to the\r\ncountry upon this most dangerous subject of controversy for upwards of\r\nthirty years, your Commissioners gave their assent to it as the best\r\npractical solution of all difficulties growing out of the territorial\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNew territory is no further dealt with by this article than to\r\nrequire, except in certain specified cases, a majority of all the\r\nSenators from each side of said line, to concur in its acquisition,\r\nwhether made by act of Congress or by treaty, thus giving to each\r\nclass of States a check upon the cupidity of the others.\r\n\r\nThe other sections of the article were designed in general so to\r\ndefine and limit the rights, powers, and duties of both Congress and\r\nthe States, with regard to the subject of slavery, as to prevent\r\nfurther controversy, and to enable and induce those most opposed in\r\nopinion and interest, by the practice of mutual forbearance, to live\r\nin peace and amity under the same Federal Government. It is believed\r\nthat in no essential particular will this article change the present\r\nactual state of things; its value consisting in the security therein\r\nwhich it gives to all, and in the settlement made by it of present and\r\nprobable subjects of controversy.\r\n\r\nIn a great practical matter of this sort, your Commissioners deem\r\nthese results of far more importance than strict adhesion to any\r\ntheory, however plausible in the abstract, and especially than to any\r\nparty declaration of principles of a sectional cast, however\r\nvehemently argued, or numerously adopted on either side. To deal well\r\nand wisely with the actual and real, and whilst consulting the past\r\nand looking to the probable future for guidance, to base his action on\r\nwhat _is_, comprises the whole duty of a statesman; leaving to\r\npolitical philosophers to dream of what might have been, or in the\r\nabstract of what ought to be. Reform, it is true, in this way comes\r\nslowly, but it comes without the disturbance of material interests,\r\nwithout agitation of human passions, and without the violent outbreaks\r\nwhich these occasion--hindering and obstructing its progress in that\r\ngrand and orderly procession of moral causes and effects which\r\nexpresses and marks the providence and government of GOD.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent to all that, whatever may have been the motive and\r\norigin of the present alarming movement in the extreme Southern\r\nStates, the instrument successfully used to promote it was the\r\nagitation of their people upon the safety of the institution of negro\r\nslavery in the States and Territories; and various conflicting\r\nopinions with regard to the best course to be pursued to allay this\r\nagitation were elicited in the course of this long conference.\r\nExtremists were not wanting on the one hand, who seemed inclined to\r\nconstrue the anomaly of slavery of the negro race, found in the\r\nConstitution of a free people, into a general rule; and who proposed\r\nor voted for propositions which they knew could not be accepted, that\r\ntheir assertion might aid in the remaining States the cause of\r\nsecession. Extremists were not wanting, on the other hand, who were\r\nopposed to doing any thing upon the subject of slavery, especially at\r\npresent, lest such action should compromise the incoming\r\nadministration, and the Republican party, and even the character of\r\nthe Government itself. Without suspecting the purity of the motives of\r\neither of these extremists, who beyond doubt represented the views of\r\nlarge and respectable bodies of men in their different sections, your\r\nCommissioners found themselves equally unable to agree with either.\r\n\r\nThey could not ignore the fact that seven States had separated\r\nthemselves from the others and set up a federal government of their\r\nown; and that these were ceaselessly agitating the people of the\r\nremaining Southern States by inflammatory speeches, and writings\r\nskilfully addressed to their interests and sympathies, to induce them\r\nto join in this new movement. They could not doubt the assurances\r\ngiven to them by able and patriotic men from the States of Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, that\r\nthese attempts upon the loyalty of the people of their States had met\r\nat least with partial success; nor, indeed, blind themselves to the\r\nevidences of this found in the speeches and votes of individual\r\nCommissioners from these very States. Above all, they could not be\r\ninsensible to the touching appeals of men, venerable in years,\r\ndistinguished in public service, and whose reputation for ability and\r\npatriotism was national, to give them something in the shape of a\r\nconstitutional security with which to allay the startled fears of\r\ntheir constituents, beat back the attacks of _their_ enemies and\r\n_ours_, and even bring again to their duty thousands of men in the\r\nStates of the extreme South, who had been led astray by the popular\r\nfears and impulses of the hour, and who, with the loyal but overborne,\r\nmight well look to them for support, since no other had been afforded\r\nthem in the reign of terror under which they were suffering. In the\r\ncircumstances in which the country was placed, it seemed to your\r\nCommissioners that true policy ran in the course of generous impulse;\r\nthat in this matter we were dealing not with treason, but with the\r\nmost devoted loyalty which invoked our aid against it; that the\r\nconcessions we made, if concessions indeed they were, were made to our\r\nfriends that they might be strong enough to triumph over _their_\r\nenemies and _ours_, because the enemies of the country.\r\n\r\nIf, as is true, in this view of their duty your Commissioners stood in\r\nthe main alone amongst the Commissioners from the Northern States, and\r\nranged themselves by the side of the Central States of the Union, upon\r\nwhom the weight of the civil strife must come if come it must, they\r\nneed not assure you that no dastardly fears, no feelings of base\r\ncompliance, dictated the position thus taken by them. Such motives to\r\naction neither became them nor those whom they represented. It was\r\nbecause of generous faith and earnest sympathy, of ties which no\r\ndistance of time or space, and no difference of institutions can\r\nweaken; which in our fathers' days and our own led our heroes to\r\n_hazard all for all_, and at Guilford Court House, and Eutaw, and at\r\nErie, with desperate valor to snatch victory for our common country\r\nout of the very lap of defeat; it was because our little State, with a\r\nwarm heart and a ready hand, has never failed in counsel or deed to\r\nstand with the whole country in all dangers and in extremest\r\ndisasters, that your Commissioners conceived that they best\r\nrepresented her by averting danger from those with whom they knew she\r\nwould hasten to share it. If it be true that the time has arrived when\r\nour sympathy for an alien and a subject race has extinguished all\r\nsympathy for our own, and has hidden from us the ties of a common\r\norigin, common interests, and of a common glory, then, indeed, are we\r\nseparated from our brethren, and the curse of slavery has fallen upon\r\nus as well as upon them. Your Commissioners found nothing in\r\nthemselves to justify them in attributing such sentiments to the\r\npeople of the State; and unitedly recommend the adoption by you of the\r\namendment to the Constitution proposed by the Conference of\r\nCommissioners, as best fitted to give security and ensure peace to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures strenuously enforced by some of the Commissioners,\r\nin lieu of that adopted by a majority, was the calling of a General\r\nConvention. To this measure your Commissioners opposed their most\r\nearnest and determined resistance. As a measure of peace, if for no\r\nother reason, because of the long delay which it implied, it would be\r\nutterly fruitless. But the possible danger of exposing a Constitution,\r\nframed and adopted in the earlier and more conservative days of the\r\nRepublic, to be torn in pieces in these times of lawless irreverence\r\nand change, is too great for any wise man willingly to encounter. The\r\nvery equality of the States in the Senate, which was won by the\r\nrevolutionary sacrifices and valor of the smaller States, now almost\r\nforgotten, would, in the judgment of your Commissioners, be thereby\r\ngreatly endangered; and your Commissioners earnestly represent to your\r\nHonorable body that under no circumstances should this State consent\r\nto a measure which might lead to her own extinction. The Constitution\r\nof a great country, adopted, as this was, on account of diversity of\r\ninterests and views, with great difficulty, should be sacred. It may\r\nand should from time to time be amended to suit a change of\r\ncircumstances, but never exposed to the danger of being uptorn. It is\r\nthe symbol of our strength, because the ligament of our Union. It has\r\ncollected about it the reverence of three generations of our people.\r\nIt is the only rallying point now for the loyalty of the remaining\r\nStates; the only hope of the restoration of the States which have left\r\nus; and, in its main features, it should be, as it was designed to be,\r\nperpetual. At no time should a General Convention be invited to invade\r\nit; and, of all times, this, in the judgment of your Commissioners,\r\nwould be the most dangerous.\r\n\r\nFinally, it will be found upon an inspection of the Journal of the\r\nlate Conference of Commissioners, that the undersigned voted against\r\nmany propositions in themselves just and expressive of _their_\r\nsentiments and _yours_, because inopportune and useless; and against\r\nothers, because introduced for the very purpose of sowing dissension\r\namong the Commissioners and to prevent an agreement by majority upon\r\nany thing. In this they must ask your candid construction of their\r\nconduct, looking to the crisis, the occasion, the purpose and effect\r\nof the matter upon which they were called to act; and their\r\nunwillingness to hazard an agreement upon that deemed by them\r\nnecessary, by tacking to it that which, however true, was at least\r\nuseless, and might in the result be dangerous.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted by\r\n\r\nSAMUEL AMES, for self, and\r\nALEXANDER DUNCAN,\r\nG.H.

Goodrich,\r\nCharles Allen, George S. Boutwell, Theophilus P. Chandler, Francis B.\r\nCrowninshield, John M. Forbes, and Richard P. Waters, Esquires, who\r\nwere appointed Commissioners on the part of Massachusetts, under a\r\nResolve passed the fifth day of February last, to attend a Convention\r\nof delegates from the several States of the Union, recently held at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAnd I embrace this opportunity to congratulate the people of the\r\nCommonwealth upon the fidelity, judgment, and ability with which the\r\nCommissioners, by whom they were represented, conducted their share of\r\nthe duties of that deliberation.\r\n\r\nAnd I trust that a similar intelligent, manful, and, at the same time,\r\ncharitable and patriotic adherence to principles, fundamental both in\r\nmorals and politics, will characterize the people of Massachusetts,\r\nand all their representatives, by whatever experiences of danger or\r\ndifficulty their devotion to truth and duty may hereafter be tried.\r\n\r\nI ask leave to call the attention of the General Court, also, to the\r\nfact that, as yet, no provision has been adopted for the payment of\r\nthe expenses incident to the service with which the Commissioners were\r\ncharged, and to recommend that a suitable appropriation for that\r\npurpose be made at the present session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. ANDREW.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency JOHN A. ANDREW, _Governor, &c., &c._:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Commissioners appointed by your excellency, in\r\npursuance of certain resolutions passed by the Legislature at its\r\npresent session, to attend a Convention to be held in the City of\r\nWashington, with authority to confer with the General Government, or\r\nwith the separate States, or with any associations of delegates from\r\nsuch States, having, agreeably to your excellency's instructions,\r\nrepaired to Washington and conferred with the delegates of twenty\r\nother States of the American Union, now respectfully submit the\r\nfollowing report of the proceedings of the said Convention, and of the\r\naction of the Commissioners from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe Convention commenced its sessions on the 4th of February, and\r\nclosed its deliberations on the 27th of the same month. The\r\nMassachusetts Commissioners repaired to Washington as early as\r\npracticable after their appointment, and presented their credentials\r\non the 8th of February.\r\n\r\nThe sessions of the Convention were secret; although repeated efforts\r\nwere made, with the concurrence of the undersigned, first, to remove\r\nthe injunction of secrecy, then to admit the public to witness the\r\ndeliberations, and then to procure a complete and accurate report of\r\nthe debates and doings. These efforts failed, and the undersigned are\r\ntherefore able only to transmit a copy of the Journal of the\r\nConvention.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: An authentic copy of the Journal was not received until\r\nthe 21st instant and the Commissioners did not feel prepared to make a\r\nreport without an opportunity for consulting it.]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February a resolution was adopted, upon the motion of\r\nMr. Guthrie, of Kentucky, that a \"committee of one from each State be\r\nappointed by the Commissioners thereof, to whom should be referred the\r\nresolutions of the State of Virginia, and the other States\r\nrepresented, and all propositions for the adjustment of existing\r\ndifficulties between the States.\" Mr. Crowninshield represented\r\nMassachusetts upon this committee. At the earliest practicable moment\r\nhe called for a specific statement of the grievances complained of by\r\nthe discontented States of the Union. This call elicited much\r\ndiscussion, but no definite response to the demand was ever made\r\neither in the committee or in Convention.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of February, Mr. Guthrie, from the committee of one from\r\neach State, made a report recommending certain amendments to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. This report was adopted in\r\ncommittee by a majority of five States, the delegates from Kansas not\r\nhaving then taken their seats in the Convention.\r\n\r\nA copy of this report may be found upon the twenty-second and\r\ntwenty-third pages of the Journal. After much discussion and many\r\namendments, the several sections of the proposed article of amendment\r\nto the Constitution were finally adopted on the last day of the\r\nsession. It is to be observed, however, that the report as a whole\r\nnever received the sanction of the Convention, although the several\r\nsections of the article of amendment were separately approved by a\r\nmajority of the States voting; and it may well be doubted whether the\r\nentire article would have been adopted by the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe first section was adopted by a vote of nine States to eight; four\r\nStates--New York, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas--not voting.\r\n\r\nThe other sections were approved by larger majorities.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned declined to vote upon the last section, but the vote\r\nof Massachusetts, with the unanimous consent of its Commissioners, was\r\ngiven in the negative upon all the others. This course seemed to be\r\ndemanded, whether regard was had to the constitution of the\r\nConvention, the circumstances under which it assembled, the nature of\r\nthe propositions submitted, the solution of the difficulties in which\r\nthe Government and people are involved, or to the character and peace\r\nof the country in the future. The two Pacific States, whose loyalty to\r\nthe Constitution and the Union is unquestioned, could not have been\r\nrepresented in the Convention. Other States failed to appoint\r\nCommissioners. The resolutions of the State of Virginia were passed on\r\nthe 19th of January; and it was expected that within sixteen days\r\nthereafter the representatives of this vast country would assemble for\r\nthe purpose of devising, maturing, and recommending alterations in the\r\nConstitution of the republic. As a necessary consequence, the people\r\nwere not consulted in any of the States. In several, the Commissioners\r\nwere appointed by the executive of each without even an opportunity to\r\nconfer with the Legislature; in others, the consent of the\r\nrepresentative body was secured, but in no instance were the people\r\nthemselves consulted. The measures proposed were comparatively new;\r\nthe important ones were innovations upon the established principles of\r\nthe Government, and none of them had ever been submitted to public\r\nscrutiny. They related to the institution of slavery; and the\r\nexperience of the country justifies the assertion that any proposition\r\nfor additional securities to slavery under the flag of the nation,\r\nmust be fully discussed and well understood before its adoption, or it\r\nwill yield a fearful harvest of woe in dissensions and controversies\r\namong the people. Nor could the undersigned have justified the act to\r\nthemselves, if they had concurred in asking Congress to propose\r\namendments to the Constitution unless they were prepared also to\r\nadvocate the adoption of the amendments by the people.\r\n\r\nIt is due to truth to say that the Convention did not possess all the\r\ndesirable characteristics of a deliberative assembly. It was in some\r\ndegree disqualified for the performance of the important task assigned\r\nto it, by the circumstances of its constitution, to which reference\r\nhas already been made. Moreover, there were members who claimed that\r\ncertain concessions must be granted that the progress of the secession\r\nmovement might be arrested; and on the other hand there were men who\r\neither doubted or denied the wisdom of such concessions.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were extraordinary. Within the preceding ninety days\r\nthe integrity of the Union had been assailed by the attempt of six\r\nStates to overthrow its authority; seven other States were\r\ndisaffected, and some of them had assumed a menacing and even hostile\r\nattitude. The political disturbances had been associated with or\r\nfollowed by financial distress.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was then a body of men without a recognized and\r\nascertained constituency, called together in an exigency and without\r\npreparation, and invited to initiate measures for the amendment of the\r\nConstitution in most important particulars, and all at a moment when\r\nthe public mind was swayed by fears and alarms such as have never\r\nbefore been experienced by the American people.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the undersigned thought it inexpedient to\r\npropose amendments to the Constitution, believing that so important an\r\nact should not be initiated and accomplished without the greatest\r\ndeliberation and care. Nor could the undersigned satisfy themselves\r\nthat any or all of the proposed amendments would even tend, in any\r\nconsiderable degree, to the preservation of the Union. Although\r\ninquiries were repeatedly made, no assurance was given that any\r\npropositions of amendment would secure the return of the seceded\r\nStates; and it was admitted that several of the Border States would\r\nultimately unite with the Gulf States, either within or without the\r\nlimits of the Union, as might be dictated by events yet in the future.\r\nIndeed, no proposition was in any degree acceptable to the majority of\r\ndelegates from the border slave States that did not provide for the\r\nextension of slavery to the Territories, and its protection and\r\nsecurity therein.\r\n\r\nAnd further, as appears from the Journal, the Convention was not\r\nprepared to deny the right of a State to secede from the Union. Mr.\r\nField, of New York, introduced the following proposition, which, on\r\nmotion of Mr. Ewing, of Ohio, was laid upon the table:\r\n\r\n     \"The Union of the States under the Constitution is\r\n     indissoluble; and no State can secede from the Union, or\r\n     nullify an act of Congress, or absolve its citizens from\r\n     their paramount obligation of obedience to the Constitution\r\n     and laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAfter much debate and repeated attempts to avoid a direct vote, the\r\nfollowing proposition was rejected:\r\n\r\n     \"It is declared to be the true intent and meaning of the\r\n     present Constitution that the union of the States under it\r\n     is indissoluble.\"\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and\r\n     Kansas--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\r\n     and Virginia--11.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the session, Mr. Franklin, of Pennsylvania, moved\r\nthe adoption of the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, as the sense of this Convention, that the\r\n     highest political duty of every citizen of the United States\r\n     is his allegiance to the Federal Government, created by the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and that no State of this\r\n     Union has any constitutional right to secede therefrom, or\r\n     to absolve the citizens of such State from their allegiance\r\n     to the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ruffin, of North Carolina, moved to postpone the consideration of\r\nthe same indefinitely, and the resolution was thereupon postponed by\r\nthe following vote:\r\n\r\n     AYES.--Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\n     North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and\r\n     Virginia--10.\r\n\r\n     NOES.--Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,\r\n     Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania--7.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and others the Commissioners from Massachusetts\r\nsupported the proposition originally made by Kentucky, and introduced\r\nby Mr. Baldwin, of Connecticut, recommending a national convention for\r\nthe purpose of revising the Constitution, and of providing for the\r\nexigencies likely to arise from the changed and perilous condition of\r\nthe country. This measure offered an opportunity for consideration by\r\nthe people, and for careful deliberation by the convention that might\r\nbe constituted for the purpose. It is highly probable that, after the\r\nlapse of three-fourths of a century, a convention of delegates from\r\nall the States would by general consent propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution; and it is also probable that such a convention would at\r\nonce tend to strengthen the feeling of brotherhood among the people of\r\nvarious sections, while the discussion of the principles of the\r\nGovernment would render its preservation of paramount concern to all.\r\nThis measure of peace and union was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned are constrained by the force of many facts and\r\ncircumstances to believe that an exciting cause of the present\r\ndifficulties, and a serious obstacle to their removal, is the possible\r\nacquisition of Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Convention furnish evidence upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to restore the Missouri Compromise, which guaranteed\r\nfreedom north of the parallel 36° 30´ north latitude, but furnished no\r\nprotection to slavery south of that line, was rejected by the aid of\r\nthe unanimous support of the slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to settle the territorial question by the admission of\r\nNew Mexico as a State, was summarily discouraged by the South in the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of one of the Commissioners from Massachusetts, that if\r\nthe Convention would leave the territorial question out of view, the\r\ndifficulties concerning the rights and relations of the existing\r\nStates might be adjusted, did not meet with a favorable response from\r\nthe slaveholding section of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed further, that the various propositions and\r\namendments which were in any degree acceptable to the slave States\r\nguaranteed slavery south of said line.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to the undersigned of signal importance, whether this\r\nguarantee was limited to our present territories, or made in words to\r\napply to all future acquisitions. Whenever the line of slave States\r\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean shall be formed, an\r\neffectual barrier will have been raised against the migration of\r\nfreemen southward. Nor can it be assumed, that either with or without\r\nconstitutional prohibition, the limits of the republic are not to be\r\nfurther extended; and if the proposed line be established by the\r\nConstitution, the fairest portions of North America will be given up\r\nirrevocably to African slavery. Nor is the limitation of the right of\r\na sovereign State to fix its own boundaries, which involves the right\r\nto acquire territory, consistent with its honor in peace, or\r\ncompatible with its dignity and necessities in time of war. The\r\nAmerican people are fully forewarned that it is unwise to rely upon\r\nconstitutional prohibitions against the acquisition of territory; nor\r\ncan such prohibitions always withstand the assaults of a determined\r\nand desperate majority when acting in harmony with the tendencies of\r\npublic opinion, and the real or supposed necessities of the country.\r\n\r\nWith these views, and with this experience in mind, the undersigned\r\ndid not regard with favor the provisions contained in the second\r\nsection of the proposed article of amendment. It is also to be\r\nobserved that by this section territory may be acquired for _naval and\r\ncommercial stations, depots, and transit routes_, without a resort to\r\nthe treaty-making power. These provisions seem to be broad enough to\r\npermit the summary annexation of Cuba, and portions of Central America\r\nand Mexico, by a simple law or joint resolution of Congress.\r\n\r\nThus, these two sections considered together, furnished no additional\r\nsecurities against territorial acquisitions, while they effectually\r\nestablished and protected slavery in all territory, present and\r\nfuture, south of the parallel 36° 30´ north latitude. By the first\r\nsection, the common law was to be so changed, that a condition of\r\nslavery would be assumed in regard to all the African race within the\r\nTerritories, and the laws of the several slave States would be\r\nenforced against all persons of that race who might be carried from\r\nthe existing slave States into the Territories. The language is\r\nambiguous, but this interpretation seems to be warranted; and, in the\r\nopinion of the undersigned, the courts would render an interpretation\r\nadequate to the result just indicated. It is thus seen that the only\r\nmethod of establishing and protecting slavery in the Territories, is\r\nto provide for the execution, within their limits, of the laws of the\r\nseveral slave States.\r\n\r\nThis section also incorporates into the Constitution of the United\r\nStates the existing laws and usages of New Mexico relating to slavery,\r\nand renders them irrepealable during the territorial condition.\r\n\r\nBy the second section, the Senators are divided into two classes,\r\nthose who represent the slaveholding, and those who represent the\r\nnon-slaveholding States of the Union, and a majority of each class is\r\nrequired as a part of the two-thirds majority necessary for the\r\nacquisition of territory by treaty. A full exposition of this\r\nproposition would show that it is a complete and dangerous departure\r\nfrom the principles of the Government, and sure to effect its complete\r\ndissolution. When the Senate becomes two separate and distinct bodies,\r\nand when the existence of the institution of slavery determines where\r\nthe line of division shall be, then the Government, for all practical\r\npurposes, is at an end. This proposition was introduced by Mr.\r\nSummers, of Virginia; and Virginia, by its delegates, also introduced\r\nand supported a kindred proposition, by which \"all appointments to\r\noffice in the Territories lying north of the line 36° 30´, as well\r\nbefore as after the establishment of Territorial Governments in and\r\nover the same, or any part thereof, shall be made upon the\r\nrecommendation of a majority of the Senators representing at the time\r\nthe non-slaveholding States; and in like manner, all appointments to\r\noffice in the Territories which may lie south of said line of 36° 30´,\r\nshall be made upon the recommendation of a majority of the Senators\r\nrepresenting at the time the slaveholding States.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot hesitate to declare the opinion, carefully formed, that this\r\npolicy of dividing the Senate into two classes, is fraught with\r\ndangers to the country more to be dreaded than the bold and defiant\r\nmeasures of those men and States that are arrayed in open hostility to\r\nthe Union. This measure is a part of the policy of Mr. Calhoun, by\r\nwhich the Government was to be changed, and the executive department\r\nso divided that nothing could be done without the concurrence of two\r\nPresidents, one representing the slaveholding and one representing the\r\nnon-slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nThe third section contains several provisions for strengthening and\r\nsecuring slavery in the District of Columbia and in the several States\r\nand Territories. It gives to representatives and others the right to\r\nbring their slaves into the District of Columbia, retain, and take\r\nthem away, even after slavery may have ceased to exist in that\r\nDistrict by the constitutional action of Congress. It secures the\r\nslave-trade between States and Territories in which slavery is\r\nestablished or recognized by law or usage, with the right of transit\r\nthrough free States, by sea or river, and of touching at ports,\r\nshores, and landings, and of landing in case of distress; reserving,\r\nhowever, to the States and Territories the power to prohibit the\r\ntransit of slaves and the sale or traffic therein. Thus the\r\ntransportation of slaves would be a right as broad as the limits of\r\nthe republic, unless it should be restrained by the laws of individual\r\nStates, which acts might readily be regarded as a breach of comity.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the article gives to the States the power of\r\nconcurrent legislation with the United States for the rendition of\r\nfugitive slaves, thus introducing a new topic of agitation into every\r\nState, without in any degree relieving Congress of its duty in this\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThe fifth section prohibits the foreign slave-trade, and makes it the\r\nduty of Congress to pass laws to prevent the importation of slaves,\r\ncoolies, or persons held to service or labor. As Congress has already,\r\nby the Constitution, full power to regulate the migration or\r\nimportation of persons from other countries, there is no reason for\r\nsuch constitutional provisions upon the subject. It alone remains to\r\nenact proper laws and secure their faithful and prompt execution.\r\n\r\nThe sixth section declares that certain sections of the proposed\r\narticle of amendment, and certain provisions of the Constitution\r\nrelating to slavery, shall not be amended or abolished without the\r\nconsent of all the States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, being of opinion that no such stipulation ought to be\r\nmade, and that if made, it would not be binding upon the country, did\r\nnot hesitate to give the vote of the State against the proposition.\r\n\r\nThe seventh and last section of the proposed article of amendment is\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"Congress shall provide by law that the United States shall\r\n     pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive from labor,\r\n     in all cases where the marshal, or other officer, whose duty\r\n     it was to arrest such fugitive, was prevented from so doing\r\n     by violence or intimidation from mobs or riotous assemblies,\r\n     or when, after arrest, such fugitive was rescued by like\r\n     violence or intimidation, and the owner thereby deprived of\r\n     the same; and the acceptance of such payment shall preclude\r\n     the owner from further claim of such fugitive. Congress\r\n     shall provide by law for securing to the citizens of each\r\n     State the privileges and immunities of citizens of the\r\n     several States.\"\r\n\r\nIn a Convention duly called and assembled for the revision of the\r\nConstitution, the undersigned would have assented to this section; and\r\nin declining to vote thereon they intended to so declare to their\r\nassociates from the slaveholding States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned thus set forth the doings of the Convention, and some\r\nof the reasons by which their conduct was controlled. It was not their\r\nfortune to concur with the action of the Convention. The concessions\r\ndemanded by the discontented States, seemed to be inconsistent with\r\nhonor, justice, and freedom, and calculated to render permanent the\r\nexisting causes of disturbance. A Union restored by unmanly\r\nconcessions, would be productive of bitter criminations and lasting\r\nhostilities, and would contain within itself the seeds of a violent\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut the undersigned are bound to say that the differences in the\r\nConvention were, in the main, differences of opinion, and not of\r\npurpose. Loyalty to the Constitution and the Union was general; and\r\nthe undersigned do not doubt that the act of Virginia, in inviting a\r\nconference with her sister States, will be productive of beneficial\r\nresults to the country.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners from Massachusetts were much impressed by the fact,\r\nwhich their personal intercourse with gentlemen from all the\r\nslaveholding States brought to their knowledge, that the present\r\ndifficulties of the country were not caused by the pressure of\r\ngrievances supposed to be actually existing; but rather by the fear of\r\nfuture interference with Southern rights, caused by entire\r\nmisapprehension of the purposes of the people of the free States.\r\nMisrepresentation of those purposes, proceeding from among ourselves,\r\nwhether prompted by ignorance of Northern sentiment, or by sinister\r\nmotives, are greatly to be deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned entertain no doubt that the intercourse between the\r\ndifferent sections of the country, through their representatives in\r\nConvention, had a most salutary influence in correcting false views of\r\nNorthern sentiment, and in assuring our brethren of the South that\r\nthere is no purpose among the people of those States, who, upon\r\nprinciple, oppose the extension of slavery, to disturb or touch with\r\nan unfriendly hand the domestic relations of any other States of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIn the present exigency of public affairs, each State should be\r\ncareful to perform its whole duty freely and faithfully to its sister\r\nStates and to the country; and then may it well and fearlessly demand,\r\nwhether the Union contain many States or few, that the Government\r\nshall be administered according to the principles of equality and\r\njustice which characterize the Constitution formed by our fathers, and\r\nwhich will prove a sufficient security in all the trials and perils of\r\nour national existence.\r\n\r\nJOHN Z.
