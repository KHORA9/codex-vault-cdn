SKEPSEY IN MOTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nACROSS LONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\nA gentleman, noteworthy for a lively countenance and a waistcoat to match\r\nit, crossing London Bridge at noon on a gusty April day, was almost\r\nmagically detached from his conflict with the gale by some sly strip of\r\nslipperiness, abounding in that conduit of the markets, which had more or\r\nless adroitly performed the trick upon preceding passengers, and now laid\r\nthis one flat amid the shuffle of feet, peaceful for the moment as the\r\nuncomplaining who have gone to Sabrina beneath the tides.  He was unhurt,\r\nquite sound, merely astonished, he remarked, in reply to the inquiries of\r\nthe first kind helper at his elbow; and it appeared an acceptable\r\nstatement of his condition.  He laughed, shook his coat-tails, smoothed\r\nthe back of his head rather thoughtfully, thankfully received his runaway\r\nhat, nodded bright beams to right and left, and making light of the muddy\r\nstigmas imprinted by the pavement, he scattered another shower of his\r\nnods and smiles around, to signify, that as his good friends would wish,\r\nhe thoroughly felt his legs and could walk unaided.  And he was in the\r\nact of doing it, questioning his familiar behind the waistcoat amazedly,\r\nto tell him how such a misadventure could have occurred to him of all\r\nmen, when a glance below his chin discomposed his outward face.  'Oh,\r\nconfound the fellow!' he said, with simple frankness, and was humorously\r\nruffled, having seen absurd blots of smutty knuckles distributed over the\r\nmaiden waistcoat.\r\n\r\nHis outcry was no more than the confidential communication of a genial\r\nspirit with that distinctive article of his attire.  At the same time,\r\nfor these friendly people about him to share the fun of the annoyance,\r\nhe looked hastily brightly back, seeming with the contraction of his\r\nbrows to frown, on the little band of observant Samaritans; in the centre\r\nof whom a man who knew himself honourably unclean, perhaps consequently a\r\nbit of a political jewel, hearing one of their number confounded for his\r\npains, and by the wearer of a superfine dashing-white waistcoat, was\r\nmoved to take notice of the total deficiency of gratitude in this kind of\r\ngentleman's look and pocket.  If we ask for nothing for helping gentlemen\r\nto stand upright on their legs, and get it, we expect civility into the\r\nbargain.  Moreover, there are reasons in nature why we choose to give\r\nsign of a particular surliness when our wealthy superiors would have us\r\nthink their condescending grins are cordials.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman's eyes were followed on a second hurried downward grimace,\r\nthe necessitated wrinkles of which could be stretched by malevolence to a\r\nsemblance of haughty disgust; reminding us, through our readings in\r\njournals, of the wicked overblown Prince Regent and his Court, together\r\nwith the view taken of honest labour in the mind of supercilious luxury,\r\neven if indebted to it freshly for a trifle; and the hoar-headed\r\nnineteenth-century billow of democratic ire craved the word to be set\r\nswelling.\r\n\r\n'Am I the fellow you mean, sir?' the man said.\r\n\r\nHe was answered, not ungraciously: 'All right, my man.'\r\n\r\nBut the balance of our public equanimity is prone to violent antic\r\nbobbings on occasions when, for example, an ostentatious garment shall\r\nappear disdainful our class and ourself, and coin of the realm has not\r\nusurped command of one of the scales: thus a fairly pleasant answer, cast\r\nin persuasive features, provoked the retort:\r\n\r\n'There you're wrong; nor wouldn't be.'\r\n\r\n'What's that?' was the gentleman's musical inquiry.\r\n\r\n'That's flat, as you was half a minute ago,' the man rejoined.\r\n\r\n'Ah, well, don't be impudent,' the gentleman said, by way of amiable\r\nremonstrance before a parting.\r\n\r\n'And none of your dam punctilio,' said the man.\r\n\r\nTheir exchange rattled smartly, without a direct hostility, and the\r\ngentleman stepped forward.\r\n\r\nIt was observed in the crowd, that after a few paces he put two fingers\r\non the back of his head.\r\n\r\nThey might suppose him to be condoling with his recent mishap.  But,\r\nin fact, a thing had occurred to vex him more than a descent upon the\r\npavement or damage to his waistcoat's whiteness: he abominated the\r\nthought of an altercation with a member of the mob; he found that\r\nenormous beat comprehensible only when it applauded him; and besides\r\nhe wished it warmly well; all that was good for it; plentiful dinners,\r\ncountry excursions, stout menagerie bars, music, a dance, and to bed:\r\nhe was for patting, stroking, petting the mob, for tossing it sops,\r\nnever for irritating it to show an eye-tooth, much less for causing it\r\nto exhibit the grinders: and in endeavouring to get at the grounds of his\r\ndissension with that dirty-fisted fellow, the recollection of the word\r\npunctilio shot a throb of pain to the spot where his mishap had rendered\r\nhim susceptible.  Headache threatened--and to him of all men!  But was\r\nthere ever such a word for drumming on a cranium?  Puzzles are presented\r\nto us now and then in the course of our days; and the smaller they are\r\nthe better for the purpose, it would seem; and they come in rattle-boxes,\r\nthey are actually children's toys, for what they contain, but not the\r\nless do they buzz at our understandings and insist that they break or we,\r\nand, in either case, to show a mere foolish idle rattle in hollowness.\r\nOr does this happen to us only after a fall?\r\n\r\nHe tried a suspension of his mental efforts, and the word was like the\r\nclapper of a disorderly bell, striking through him, with reverberations,\r\nin the form of interrogations, as to how he, of all men living, could by\r\nany chance have got into a wrangle, in a thoroughfare, on London Bridge,\r\nof all places in the world!--he, so popular, renowned for his affability,\r\nhis amiability; having no dislike to common dirty dogs, entirely the\r\nreverse, liking them and doing his best for them; and accustomed to\r\nreceive their applause.  And in what way had he offered a hint to bring\r\non him the charge of punctilio?\r\n\r\n'But I am treating it seriously!' he said, and jerked a dead laugh while\r\nfixing a button of his coat.\r\n\r\nThat he should have treated it seriously, furnished next the subject of\r\ncogitation; and here it was plainly suggested, that a degradation of his\r\nphysical system, owing to the shock of the fall, must be seen and\r\nacknowledged; for it had become a perverted engine, to pull him down\r\namong the puerilities, and very soon he was worrying at punctilio anew,\r\nattempting to read the riddle of the application of it to himself, angry\r\nthat he had allowed it to be the final word, and admitting it a famous\r\nword for the closing of a controversy:--it banged the door and rolled\r\ndrum-notes; it deafened reason.  And was it a London cockney crow-word of\r\nthe day, or a word that had stuck in the fellow's head from the perusal\r\nof his pothouse newspaper columns?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the plea of a fall, and the plea of a shock from a fall,\r\nrequired to account for the triviality of the mind, were humiliating to\r\nhim who had never hitherto missed a step, or owned to the shortest of\r\ncollapses.  This confession of deficiency in explosive repartee--using a\r\nfriend's term for the ready gift--was an old and a rueful one with Victor\r\nRadnor.  His godmother Fortune denied him that.  She bestowed it on his\r\nfriend Fenellan, and little else.  Simeon Fenellan could clap the halter\r\non a coltish mob; he had positively caught the roar of cries and stilled\r\nit, by capping the cries in turn, until the people cheered him; and the\r\neffect of the scene upon Victor Radnor disposed him to rank the gift of\r\nrepartee higher than a certain rosily oratorical that he was permitted to\r\ntell himself he possessed, in bottle if not on draught.  Let it only be\r\nexplosive repartee: the well-fused bomb, the bubble to the stone, echo\r\nround the horn.  Fenellan, would have discharged an extinguisher on\r\npunctilio in emission.  Victor Radnor was unable to cope with it\r\nreflectively.\r\n\r\nNo, but one doesn't like being beaten by anything!  he replied to an\r\nadmonishment of his better mind, as he touched his two fingers, more\r\nsignificantly dubious than the whole hand, at the back of his head, and\r\nchecked or stemmed the current of a fear.  For he was utterly unlike\r\nhimself; he was dwelling on a trifle, on a matter discernibly the\r\nsmallest, an incident of the streets; and although he refused to feel a\r\nbump or any responsive notification of a bruise, he made a sacrifice of\r\nhis native pride to his intellectual, in granting that he must have been\r\nshaken, so childishly did he continue thinking.\r\n\r\nYes, well, and if a tumble distorts our ideas of life, and an odd word\r\nengrosses our speculations, we are poor creatures, he addressed another\r\nfriend, from whom he stood constitutionally in dissent naming him Colney;\r\nand under pressure of the name, reviving old wrangles between them upon\r\nman's present achievements and his probable destinies: especially upon\r\nEngland's grandeur, vitality, stability, her intelligent appreciation of\r\nher place in the universe; not to speak of the historic dignity of London\r\nCity.  Colney had to be overcome afresh, and he fled, but managed, with\r\ntwo or three of his bitter phrases, to make a cuttle-fish fight of it,\r\nthat oppressively shadowed his vanquisher:\r\n\r\nThe Daniel Lambert of Cities: the Female Annuitant of Nations:--and such\r\nlike, wretched stuff, proper to Colney Durance, easily dispersed and out-\r\nlaughed when we have our vigour.  We have as much as we need of it in\r\nsummoning a contemptuous Pooh to our lips, with a shrug at venomous\r\ndyspepsia.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a malignant sketch of Colney's, in the which Hengist and\r\nHorsa, our fishy Saxon originals, in modern garb of liveryman and\r\ngaitered squire, flat-headed, paunchy, assiduously servile, are shown\r\nblacking Ben-Israel's boots and grooming the princely stud of the Jew,\r\nhad come so near to Victor Radnor's apprehensions of a possible, if not\r\nan impending, consummation, that the ghastly vision of the Jew Dominant\r\nin London City, over England, over Europe, America, the world (a picture\r\ndrawn in literary sepia by Colney: with our poor hang neck population\r\nuncertain about making a bell-rope of the forelock to the Satyr-snouty\r\nmaster; and the Norman Lord de Warenne handing him for a lump sum son and\r\ndaughter, both to be Hebraized in their different ways), fastened on the\r\nmost mercurial of patriotic men, and gave him a whole-length plunge into\r\ndespondency.\r\n\r\nIt lasted nearly a minute.  His recovery was not in this instance due to\r\nthe calling on himself for the rescue of an ancient and glorious country;\r\nnor altogether to the spectacle of the shipping, over the parapet, to his\r\nright: the hundreds of masts rising out of the merchant river; London's\r\nunrivalled mezzotint and the City' rhetorician's inexhaustible argument:\r\nhe gained it rather from the imperious demand of an animated and thirsty\r\nframe for novel impressions.  Commonly he was too hot with his business,\r\nand airy fancies above it when crossing the bridge, to reflect in\r\nfreshness on its wonders; though a phrase could spring him alive to them;\r\na suggestion of the Foreigner, jealous, condemned to admire in despair of\r\noutstripping, like Satan worsted; or when a Premier's fine inflation\r\nmagnified the scene at City banquets--exciting while audible, if a\r\nwaggery in memory; or when England's cherished Bard, the Leading Article,\r\nblew bellows, and wind primed the lieges.\r\n\r\nThat a phrase on any other subject was of much the same effect, in\r\nrelation to it, may be owned; he was lightly kindled.  The scene,\r\nhowever, had a sharp sparkle of attractiveness at the instant.  Down went\r\nthe twirling horizontal pillars of a strong tide from the arches of the\r\nbridge, breaking to wild water at a remove; and a reddish Northern cheek\r\nof curdling pipeing East, at shrilly puffs between the Tower and the\r\nCustom House, encountered it to whip and ridge the flood against\r\ndescending tug and long tail of stern-ajerk empty barges; with a steamer\r\nslowly noseing round off the wharf-cranes, preparing to swirl the screw;\r\nand half-bottom-upward boats dancing harpooner beside their whale; along\r\nan avenue, not fabulously golden, of the deputy masts of all nations, a\r\nwintry woodland, every rag aloft curling to volume; and here the spouts\r\nand the mounds of steam, and rolls of brown smoke there, variously\r\nundulated, curved to vanish; cold blue sky ashift with the whirl and dash\r\nof a very Tartar cavalry of cloud overhead.\r\n\r\nSurely a scene pretending to sublimity?\r\n\r\nGazeing along that grand highway of the voyageing forest, your London\r\ncitizen of good estate has reproached his country's poets for not pouring\r\nout, succinctly and melodiously, his multitudinous larvae of notions\r\nbegotten by the scene.  For there are times when he would, pay to have\r\nthem sung; and he feels them big; he thinks them human in their bulk;\r\nthey are Londinensian; they want but form and fire to get them scored on\r\nthe tablets of the quotable at festive boards.  This he can promise to\r\nhis poets.  As for otherwhere than at the festive, Commerce invoked is a\r\nGoddess that will have the reek of those boards to fill her nostrils, and\r\npoet and alderman alike may be dedicate to the sublime, she leads them,\r\nafter two sniffs of an idea concerning her, for the dive into the turtle-\r\ntureen.  Heels up they go, poet first--a plummet he!\r\n\r\nAnd besides it is barely possible for our rounded citizen, in the mood of\r\nmeditation, to direct his gaze off the bridge along the waterway North-\r\neastward without beholding as an eye the glow of whitebait's bow-window\r\nby the riverside, to the front of the summer sunset, a league or so down\r\nstream; where he sees, in memory savours, the Elysian end of Commerce:\r\nfrontispiece of a tale to fetch us up the out-wearied spectre of old\r\nApicius; yea, and urge Crispinus to wheel his purse into the market for\r\nthe purchase of a costlier mullet!\r\n\r\nBut is the Jew of the usury gold becoming our despot-king of Commerce?\r\n\r\nIn that case, we do not ask our country's poets to compose a single\r\nstanza of eulogy's rhymes--far from it.  Far to the contrary, we bid\r\nourselves remember the sons of whom we are; instead of revelling in the\r\nfruits of Commerce, we shoot scornfully past those blazing bellied\r\nwindows of the aromatic dinners, and beyond Thames, away to the\r\nfishermen's deeps, Old England's native element, where the strenuous\r\nancestry of a race yet and ever manful at the stress of trial are heard\r\naround and aloft whistling us back to the splendid strain of muscle, and\r\nspray fringes cloud, and strong heart rides the briny scoops and\r\nhillocks, and Death and Man are at grip for the haul.\r\n\r\nThere we find our nationality, our poetry, no Hebrew competing.\r\n\r\nWe do: or there at least we left it.  Whether to recover it when wanted,\r\nis not so certain.  Humpy Hengist and dumpy Horsa, quitting ledger and\r\ncoronet, might recur to their sea bowlegs and red-stubble chins, might\r\ntake to their tarpaulins again; they might renew their manhood on the\r\ncapture of cod; headed by Harald and Hardiknut, they might roll surges to\r\nwhelm a Dominant Jew clean gone to the fleshpots and effeminacy.\r\nAldermen of our ancient conception, they may teach him that he has been\r\nbacksliding once more, and must repent in ashes, as those who are for\r\njewels, titles, essences, banquets, for wallowing in slimy spawn of\r\nlucre, have ever to do.  They dispossess him of his greedy gettings.\r\n\r\nAnd how of the Law?\r\n\r\nBut the Law is always, and must ever be, the Law of the stronger.\r\n\r\n--Ay, but brain beats muscle, and what if the Jew should prove to have\r\nsuperior power of brain?  A dreaded hypothesis!  Why, then you see the\r\ninsurgent Saxon seamen (of the names in two syllables with accent on the\r\nfirst), and their Danish captains, and it may be but a remnant of high-\r\nnosed old Norman Lord de Warenne beside them, in the criminal box: and\r\npresently the Jew smoking a giant regalia cigar on a balcony giving view\r\nof a gallows-tree.  But we will try that: on our side, to back a native\r\npugnacity, is morality, humanity, fraternity--nature's rights, aha! and\r\nwho withstands them? on his, a troop of mercenaries!\r\n\r\nAnd that lands me in Red Republicanism, a hop and a skip from Socialism!\r\nsaid Mr. Radnor, and chuckled ironically at the natural declivity he had\r\ncome to.  Still, there was an idea in it .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nA short run or attempt at running after the idea, ended in pain to his\r\nhead near the spot where the haunting word punctilio caught at any excuse\r\nfor clamouring.\r\n\r\nYet we cannot relinquish an idea that was ours; we are vowed to the\r\npursuit of it.  Mr. Radnor lighted on the tracks, by dint of a thought\r\nflung at his partner Mr. Inchling's dread of the Jews.  Inchling dreaded\r\nScotchmen as well, and Americans, and Armenians, and Greeks: latterly\r\nGermans hardly less; but his dread of absorption in Jewry, signifying\r\nsubjection, had often precipitated a deplorable shrug, in which Victor\r\nRadnor now perceived the skirts of his idea, even to a fancy that\r\nsomething of the idea must have struck Inchling when he shrugged: the\r\nidea being .  .  .  he had lost it again.  Definition seemed to be an\r\nextirpation enemy of this idea, or she was by nature shy.  She was very\r\nfeminine; coming when she willed and flying when wanted.  Not until nigh\r\nupon the close of his history did she return, full-statured and\r\nembraceable, to Victor Radnor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE VAGUE TO THE INFINITELY LITTLE\r\n\r\nThe fair dealing with readers demands of us, that a narrative shall not\r\nproceed at slower pace than legs of a man in motion; and we are still but\r\nlittle more than midway across London Bridge.  But if a man's mind is to\r\nbe taken as a part of him, the likening of it, at an introduction, to an\r\narmy on the opening march of a great campaign, should plead excuses for\r\ntardy forward movements, in consideration of the large amount of matter\r\nyou have to review before you can at all imagine yourselves to have made\r\nhis acquaintance.  This it is not necessary to do when you are set\r\nastride the enchanted horse of the Tale, which leaves the man's mind at\r\nhome while he performs the deeds befitting him: he can indeed be rapid.\r\nWhether more active, is a question asking for your notions of the\r\ngoverning element in the composition of man, and of hid present business\r\nhere.  The Tale inspirits one's earlier ardours, when we sped without\r\nbaggage, when the Impossible was wings to imagination, and heroic\r\nsculpture the simplest act of the chisel.  It does not advance, 'tis\r\ntrue; it drives the whirligig circle round and round the single existing\r\ncentral point; but it is enriched with applause of the boys and girls of\r\nboth ages in this land; and all the English critics heap their honours on\r\nits brave old Simplicity: our national literary flag, which signalizes us\r\nwhile we float, subsequently to flap above the shallows.  One may sigh\r\nfor it.  An ill-fortuned minstrel who has by fateful direction been\r\nbrought to see with distinctness, that man is not as much comprised in\r\nexternal features as the monkey, will be devoted to the task of the\r\nfuller portraiture.\r\n\r\nAfter his ineffectual catching at the volatile idea, Mr. Radnor found\r\nrepose in thoughts of his daughter and her dear mother.  They had begged\r\nhim to put on an overcoat this day of bitter wind, or a silken kerchief\r\nfor the throat.  Faithful to the Spring, it had been his habit since\r\nboyhood to show upon his person something of the hue of the vernal month,\r\nthe white of the daisied meadow, and although he owned a light overcoat\r\nto dangle from shoulders at the Opera crush, he declined to wear it for\r\nprotection.  His gesture of shaking and expanding whenever the tender\r\nrequest was urged on him, signified a physical opposition to the control\r\nof garments.  Mechanically now, while doating in fancy over the couple\r\nbeseeching him, he loosened the button across his defaced waistcoat,\r\nexposed a large measure of chest to flaws of a wind barbed on Norwegian\r\npeaks by the brewers of cough and catarrh--horrid women of the whistling\r\nclouts, in the pay of our doctors.  He braved them; he starved the\r\nprofession.  He was that man in fifty thousand who despises hostile\r\nelements and goes unpunished, calmly erect among a sneezing and tumbled\r\nhost, as a lighthouse overhead of breezy fleets.  The coursing of his\r\nblood was by comparison electrical; he had not the sensation of cold,\r\nother than that of an effort of the elements to arouse him; and so quick\r\nwas he, through this fine animation, to feel, think, act, that the three\r\nsuccessive tributaries of conduct appeared as an irreflective flash and a\r\ngamester's daring in the vein to men who had no deep knowledge of him and\r\nhis lightning arithmetic for measuring, sounding, and deciding.\r\n\r\nNaturally he was among the happiest of human creatures; he willed it so,\r\nwith consent of circumstances; a boisterous consent, as when votes are\r\nreckoned for a favourite candidate: excepting on the part of a small band\r\nof black dissentients in a corner, a minute opaque body, devilish in\r\ntheir irreconcilability, who maintain their struggle to provoke discord,\r\nwith a cry disclosing the one error of his youth, the sole bad step\r\nchargeable upon his antecedents.  But do we listen to them?  Shall we not\r\nhave them turned out?  He gives the sign for it; and he leaves his\r\nbuoying constituents to outroar them: and he tells a friend that it was\r\nnot, as one may say, an error, although an erratic step: but let us\r\nexplain to our bosom friend; it was a step quite unregretted, gloried in;\r\na step deliberately marked, to be done again, were the time renewed: it\r\nwas a step necessitated (emphatically) by a false preceding step; and\r\nhaving youth to plead for it, in the first instance, youth and ignorance;\r\nand secondly, and O how deeply truly!  Love.  Deep true love, proved by\r\nyears, is the advocate.\r\n\r\nHe tells himself at the same time, after lending ear to the advocate's\r\nexordium and a favourite sentence, that, judged by the Powers (to them\r\nonly can he expose the whole skeleton-cupboard of the case), judged by\r\nthose clear-sighted Powers, he is exonerated.\r\n\r\nTo be exonerated by those awful Powers, is to be approved.\r\n\r\nAs to that, there is no doubt: whom they, all-seeing, discerning as they\r\ndo, acquit they justify.\r\n\r\nWhom they justify, they compliment.\r\n\r\nThey, seeing all the facts, are not unintelligent of distinctions, as the\r\nworld is.\r\n\r\nWhat, to them, is the spot of the error?--admitting it as an error.\r\nThey know it for a thing of convention, not of Nature.  We stand forth\r\nto plead it in proof of an adherence to Nature's laws: we affirm, that\r\nfar from a defilement, it is an illumination and stamp of nobility.  On\r\nthe beloved who shares it with us, it is a stamp of the highest nobility.\r\nOur world has many ways for signifying its displeasure, but it cannot\r\nbrand an angel.\r\n\r\nThis was another favourite sentence of Love's grand oration for the\r\ndefence.  So seductive was it to the Powers who sat in judgement on the\r\ncase, that they all, when the sentence came, turned eyes upon the angel,\r\nand they smiled.\r\n\r\nThey do not smile on the condemnable.\r\n\r\nShe, then, were he rebuked, would have strength to uplift him.  And who,\r\ncalling her his own, could be placed in second rank among the blissful!\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor could rationally say that he was made for happiness; he flew\r\nto it, he breathed, dispensed it.  How conceive the clear-sighted\r\ncelestial Powers as opposing his claim to that estate?  Not they.  He\r\nknew, for he had them safe in the locked chamber of his breast, to yield\r\nhim subservient responses.  The world, or Puritanic members of it, had\r\npushed him to the trial once or twice--or had put on an air of doing so;\r\ncreating a temporary disturbance, ending in a merry duet with his\r\ndaughter Nesta Victoria: a glorious trio when her mother Natalia, sweet\r\nlily that she was, shook the rainwater from her cup and followed the good\r\nexample to shine in the sun.\r\n\r\nHe had a secret for them.\r\n\r\nNesta's promising soprano, and her mother's contralto, and his baritone\r\n--a true baritone, not so well trained as their accurate notes--should\r\nbe rising in spirited union with the curtain of that secret: there was\r\nmatter for song and concert, triumph and gratulation in it.  And during\r\nthe whole passage of the bridge, he had not once cast thought on a secret\r\nso palpitating, the cause of the morning's expedition and a long year's\r\nprospect of the present day!  It seemed to have been knocked clean out of\r\nit--punctilioed out, Fenellan might say.  Nor had any combinations upon\r\nthe theme of business displaced it.  Just before the fall, the whole\r\ndrama of the unfolding of that secret was brilliant to his eyes as a\r\nscene on a stage.\r\n\r\nHe refused to feel any sensible bruise on his head, with the admission\r\nthat he perhaps might think he felt one which was virtually no more than\r\nthe feeling of a thought;--what his friend Dr. Peter Yatt would define as\r\nfeeling a rotifer astir in the curative compartment of a homoeopathic\r\nglobule: and a playful fancy may do that or anything.  Only, Sanity does\r\nnot allow the infinitely little to disturb us.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor had a quaint experience of the effects of the infinitely\r\nlittle while threading his way to a haberdasher's shop for new white\r\nwaistcoats.  Under the shadow of the representative statue of City\r\nCorporations and London's majesty, the figure of Royalty, worshipful in\r\nits marbled redundancy, fronting the bridge, on the slope where the seas\r\nof fish and fruit below throw up a thin line of their drift, he stood\r\ncontemplating the not unamiable, reposefully-jolly, Guelphic countenance,\r\nfrom the loose jowl to the bent knee, as if it were a novelty to him;\r\nunwilling to trust himself to the roadway he had often traversed, equally\r\ncareful that his hesitation should not be seen.  A trifle more\r\nimpressible, he might have imagined the smoky figure and magnum of\r\npursiness barring the City against him.  He could have laughed aloud at\r\nthe hypocrisy behind his quiet look of provincial wonderment at London's\r\nsculptor's art; and he was partly tickled as well by the singular fit of\r\ntimidity enchaining him.  Cart, omnibus, cab, van, barrow, donkey-tray,\r\nwent by in strings, broken here and there, and he could not induce his\r\nlegs to take advantage of the gaps; he listened to a warning that he\r\nwould be down again if he tried it, among those wheels; and his nerves\r\nclutched him, like a troop of household women, to keep him from the\r\nhazard of an exposure to the horrid crunch, pitiless as tiger's teeth;\r\nand we may say truly, that once down, or once out of the rutted line, you\r\nare food for lion and jackal--the forces of the world will have you in\r\ntheir mandibles.\r\n\r\nAn idea was there too; but it would not accept pursuit.\r\n\r\n'A pretty scud overheard?' said a voice at his ear.\r\n\r\n'For fine!--to-day at least,' Mr. Radnor affably replied to a stranger;\r\nand gazing on the face of his friend Fenellan, knew the voice, and\r\nlaughed: 'You?' He straightened his back immediately to cross the road,\r\ndismissing nervousness as a vapour, asking, between a cab and a van:\r\n'Anything doing in the City?' For Mr. Fenellan's proper station faced\r\nWestward.\r\n\r\nThe reply was deferred until they had reached the pavement, when Mr.\r\nFenellan said: 'I'll tell you,' and looked a dubious preface, to his\r\nfriend's thinking.\r\n\r\nBut it was merely the mental inquiry following a glance at mud-spots on\r\nthe coat.\r\n\r\n'We'll lunch; lunch with me, I must eat, tell me then,' said Mr. Radnor,\r\nadding within himself: 'Emptiness! want of food!' to account for recent\r\nejaculations and qualms.  He had not eaten for a good four hours.\r\n\r\nFenellan's tone signified to his feverish sensibility of the moment,\r\nthat the matter was personal; and the intimation of a touch on domestic\r\naffairs caused sinkings in his vacuity, much as though his heart were\r\nhaving a fall.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned the slip on the bridge, to explain his: need to visit a\r\nhaberdasher's shop, and pointed at the waistcoat.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was compassionate over the 'Poor virgin of the smoky city!'\r\n\r\n'They have their ready-made at these shops--last year's: perhaps, never\r\nmind, do for the day,' said Mr. Radnor, impatient for eating, now that he\r\nhad spoken of it.  'A basin of turtle; I can't wait.  A brush of the\r\ncoat; mud must be dry by this time.  Clear turtle, I think, with a bottle\r\nof the Old Veuve.  Not bad news to tell?  You like that Old Veuve?'\r\n\r\n'Too well to tell bad news of her,' said Mr. Fenellan in a manner to\r\nreassure his friend, as he intended.  'You wouldn't credit it for the\r\nSpring of the year, without the spotless waistcoat?'\r\n\r\n'Something of that, I suppose.'  And so saying, Mr. Radnor entered the\r\nshop of his quest, to be complimented by the shopkeeper, while the\r\nattendants climbed the ladder to upper stages for white-waistcoat boxes,\r\non his being; the first bird of the season; which it pleased him to hear;\r\nfor the smallest of our gratifications in life could give a happy tone to\r\nthis brightly-constituted gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOLD VEUVE\r\n\r\nThey were known at the house of the turtle and the attractive Old Veuve:\r\na champagne of a sobered sweetness, of a great year, a great age,\r\ncounting up to the extremer maturity attained by wines of stilly depths;\r\nand their worthy comrade, despite the wanton sparkles, for the promoting\r\nof the state of reverential wonderment in rapture, which an ancient wine\r\nwill lead to, well you wot.  The silly girly sugary crudity his given way\r\nto womanly suavity, matronly composure, with yet the sparkles; they\r\nascend; but hue and flavour tell of a soul that has come to a lodgement\r\nthere.  It conducts the youthful man to temples of dusky thought:\r\nphilosophers partaking of it are drawn by the arms of garlanded nymphs\r\nabout their necks into the fathomless of inquiries.  It presents us with\r\na sphere, for the pursuit of the thing we covet most.  It bubbles over\r\nmellowness; it has, in the marriage with Time, extracted a spice of\r\nindividuality from the saccharine: by miracle, one would say, were it\r\nnot for our knowledge of the right noble issue of Time when he and good\r\nthings unite.  There should be somewhere legends of him and the wine-\r\nflask.  There must be meanings to that effect in the Mythology, awaiting\r\nunravelment.  For the subject opens to deeper than cellars, and is a tree\r\nwith vast ramifications of the roots and the spreading growth, whereon\r\nhalf if not all the mythic Gods, Inferior and Superior, Infernal and\r\nCelestial, might be shown sitting in concord, performing in concert,\r\nharmoniously receiving sacrificial offerings of the black or the white;\r\nand the black not extinguishing the fairer fellow.  Tell us of a\r\ncertainty that Time has embraced the wine-flask, then may it be asserted\r\n(assuming the great year for the wine, i.e.  combinations above) that a\r\nspeck of the white within us who drink will conquer, to rise in main\r\nascension over volumes of the black.  It may, at a greater venture, but\r\nconfidently, be said in plain speech, that the Bacchus of auspicious\r\nbirth induces ever to the worship of the loftier Deities.\r\n\r\nThink as you will; forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious men,\r\nin whom these pourings of the golden rays of life breed fogs; and be\r\nmoved, since you are scarcely under an obligation to hunt the meaning,\r\nin tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety of narration (quiverings of\r\nthe reverent pen) when we find ourselves entering the circle of a most\r\nmagnetic polarity.  Take it for not worse than accompanying choric\r\nflourishes, in accord with Mr. Victor Radnor and Mr. Simeon Fenellan at\r\ntheir sipping of the venerable wine.\r\n\r\nSeated in a cosy corner, near the grey City window edged with a sooty\r\nmaze, they praised the wine, in the neuter and in the feminine; that for\r\nthe glass, this for the widow-branded bottle: not as poets hymning; it\r\nwas done in the City manner, briefly, part pensively, like men travelling\r\nto the utmost bourne of flying flavour (a dell in infinite nether), and\r\nstill masters of themselves and at home.\r\n\r\nSuch a wine, in its capturing permeation of us, insists on being for a\r\ntime a theme.\r\n\r\n'I wonder!' said Mr. Radnor, completely restored, eyeing his half-emptied\r\nsecond glass and his boon-fellow.\r\n\r\n'Low!' Mr. Fenellan shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Half a dozen dozen left?'\r\n\r\n'Nearer the half of that.  And who's the culprit?'\r\n\r\n'Old days!  They won't let me have another dozen out of the house now.'\r\n\r\n'They'll never hit on such another discovery in their cellar, unless they\r\nunearth a fifth corner.'\r\n\r\n'I don't blame them for making the price prohibitive.  And sound as\r\never!'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor watched the deliberate constant ascent of bubbles through\r\ntheir rose-topaz transparency.  He drank.  That notion of the dish of\r\nturtle was an inspiration of the right: he ought always to know it for\r\nthe want of replenishment when such a man as he went quaking.  His latest\r\nexperiences of himself were incredible; but they passed, as the dimples\r\nof the stream.  He finished his third glass.  The bottle, like the\r\ncellar-wine, was at ebb: unlike the cellar-wine, it could be set flowing\r\nagain: He prattled, in the happy ignorance of compulsion:\r\n\r\n'Fenellan, remember, I had a sort of right to the wine--to the best I\r\ncould get; and this Old Veuve, more than any other, is a bridal wine!\r\nWe heard of Giulia Sanfredini's marriage to come off with the Spanish\r\nDuke, and drank it to the toast of our little Nesta's godmother.  I 've\r\ntold you.  We took the girl to the Opera, when quite a little one--that\r\nhigh:--and I declare to you, it was marvellous!  Next morning after\r\nbreakfast, she plants herself in the middle of the room, and strikes her\r\nattitude for song, and positively, almost with the Sanfredini's voice--\r\nillusion of it, you know,--trills us out more than I could have believed\r\ncredible to be recollected by a child.  But I've told you the story.  We\r\ncalled her Fredi from that day.  I sent the diva, with excuses and\r\ncompliments, a nuptial present-necklace, Roman goldwork, locket-pendant,\r\ncontaining sunny curl, and below a fine pearl; really pretty; telling her\r\nour grounds for the liberty.  She replied, accepting the responsible\r\noffice; touching letter--we found it so; framed in Fredi's room, under\r\nher godmother's photograph.  Fredi has another heroine now, though she\r\nworships her old one still; she never abandons her old ones.  You've\r\nheard the story over and over!'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan nodded; he had a tenderness for the garrulity of Old Veuve,\r\nand for the damsel.  Chatter on that subject ran pleasantly with their\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor meanwhile scribbled, and despatched a strip of his Note-book,\r\nbearing a scrawl of orders, to his office.  He was now fully himself,\r\nbenevolent, combative, gay, alert for amusement or the probeing of\r\nschemes to the quick, weighing the good and the bad in them with his\r\nfine touch on proportion.\r\n\r\n'City dead flat?  A monotonous key; but it's about the same as fetching a\r\nbreath after a run; only, true, it lasts too long--not healthy!  Skepsey\r\nwill bring me my letters.  I was down in the country early this morning,\r\nlooking over the house, with Taplow, my architect; and he speaks fairly\r\nwell of the contractors.  Yes, down at Lakelands; and saw my first lemon\r\nbutterfly in a dell of sunshine, out of the wind, and had half a mind to\r\ncatch it for Fredi,--and should have caught it myself, if I had!  The\r\ntruth is, we three are country born and bred; we pine in London.  Good\r\nfor a season; you know my old feeling.  They are to learn the secret of\r\nLakelands to-morrow.  It 's great fun; they think I don't see they've had\r\ntheir suspicion for some time.  You said--somebody said--\"the eye of a\r\nneedle for what they let slip of their secrets, and the point of it for\r\npenetrating yours\":--women.  But no; my dear souls didn't prick and\r\nbother.  And they dealt with a man in armour.  I carry them down to\r\nLakelands to-morrow, if the City's flat.'\r\n\r\n'Keeping a secret's the lid on a boiling pot with you,' Mr. Fenellan\r\nsaid; and he mused on the profoundness of the flavour at his lips.\r\n\r\n'I do it.'\r\n\r\n'You do: up to bursting at the breast.'\r\n\r\n'I keep it from Colney!'\r\n\r\n'As Vesuvius keeps it from Palmieri when shaking him.'\r\n\r\n'Has old Colney an idea of it?'\r\n\r\n'He has been foretelling an eruption of an edifice.'\r\n\r\nThe laugh between them subsided to pensiveness.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan's delay in the delivery of his news was eloquent to reveal\r\nthe one hateful topic; and this being seen, it waxed to such increase of\r\nsize with the passing seconds, that prudence called for it.\r\n\r\n'Come!' said Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was understood.\r\n\r\n'Nothing very particular.  I came into the City to look at a warehouse\r\nthey want to mount double guard on.  Your idea of the fireman's night-\r\npatrol and wires has done wonders for the office.'\r\n\r\n'I guarantee the City if all my directions are followed.'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan's remark, that he had nothing very particular to tell,\r\nreduced it to the mere touch upon a vexatious matter, which one has to\r\nendure in the ears at times; but it may be postponed.  So Mr. Radnor\r\nencouraged him to talk of an Insurance Office Investment.  Where it is\r\nall bog and mist, as in the City to-day, the maxim is, not to take a\r\nstep, they agreed.  Whether it was attributable to an unconsumed glut of\r\nthe markets, or apprehension of a panic, had to be considered.  Both\r\ngentlemen were angry with the Birds on the flags of foreign nations,\r\nwhich would not imitate a sawdust Lion to couch reposefully.  Incessantly\r\nthey scream and sharpen talons.\r\n\r\n'They crack the City bubbles and bladders, at all events,' Mr. Fenellan\r\nsaid.  'But if we let our journals go on making use of them, in the shape\r\nof sham hawks overhead, we shall pay for their one good day of the game\r\nwith our loss of the covey.  An unstable London's no world's market-\r\nplace.'\r\n\r\n'No, no; it's a niggardly national purse, not the journals,' Mr. Radnor\r\nsaid.  'The journals are trading engines.  Panics are grist to them; so\r\nare wars; but they do their duty in warning the taxpayer and rousing\r\nParliament.  Dr. Schlesien's right: we go on believing that our God\r\nNeptune will do everything for us, and won't see that Steam has paralyzed\r\nhis Trident: good!  You and Colney are hard on Schlesien--or at him, I\r\nshould say.  He's right: if we won't learn that we have become\r\nContinentals, we shall be marched over.  Laziness, cowardice, he says.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, be hanged!' interrupted Fenellan.  'As much of the former as you\r\nlike.  He 's right about our \"individualismus\" being another name for\r\nselfishness, and showing the usual deficiency in external features; it's\r\nan individualism of all of a pattern, as when a mob cuts its lucky, each\r\nfellow his own way.  Well, then, conscript them, and they'll be all of a\r\nbetter pattern.  The only thing to do, and the cheapest.  By heaven!\r\nit's the only honourable thing to do.'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor disapproved.  'No conscription here.'\r\n\r\n'Not till you've got the drop of poison in your blood, in the form of an\r\narmy landed.  That will teach you to catch at the drug.'\r\n\r\n'No, Fenellan!  Besides they've got to land.  I guarantee a trusty army\r\nand navy under a contract, at two-thirds of the present cost.  We'll\r\nstart a National Defence Insurance Company after the next panic.'\r\n\r\n'During,' said Mr. Fenellan, and there was a flutter of laughter at the\r\nunobtrusive hint for seizing Dame England in the mood.\r\n\r\nBoth dropped a sigh.\r\n\r\n'But you must try and run down with us to Lakelands to-morrow,' Mr.\r\nRadnor resumed on a cheerfuller theme.  'You have not yet seen all I 've\r\ndone there.  And it 's a castle with a drawbridge: no exchangeing of\r\nvisits, as we did at Craye Farm and at Creckholt; we are there for\r\ncountry air; we don't court neighbours at all--perhaps the elect; it will\r\ndepend on Nataly's wishes.  We can accommodate our Concert-set, and about\r\nthirty or forty more, for as long as they like.  You see, that was my\r\nintention--to be independent of neighbouring society.  Madame Callet\r\nguarantees dinners or hot suppers for eighty--and Armandine is the last\r\nperson to be recklessly boasting.--When was it I was thinking last of\r\nArmandine?' He asked himself that, as he rubbed at the back of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was reading his friend's character by the light of his\r\nremarks and in opposition to them, after the critical fashion of\r\nintimates who know as well as hear: but it was amiably and trippingly,\r\non the dance of the wine in his veins.\r\n\r\nHis look, however, was one that reminded; and Mr. Radnor cried: 'Now!\r\nwhatever it is!'\r\n\r\n'I had an interview: I assure you,' Mr. Fenellan interposed to pacify:\r\n'the smallest of trifles, and to be expected: I thought you ought to know\r\nit:--an interview with her lawyer; office business, increase of Insurance\r\non one of her City warehouses.'\r\n\r\n'Speak her name, speak the woman's name; we're talking like a pair of\r\nconspirators,' exclaimed Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\n'He informed me that Mrs. Burman has heard of the new mansion.'\r\n\r\n'My place at Lakelands?'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor's clear-water eyes hardened to stony as their vision ran along\r\nthe consequences of her having heard it.\r\n\r\n'Earlier this time!' he added, thrummed on the table, and thumped with\r\nknuckles.  'I make my stand at Lakelands for good!  Nothing mortal moves\r\nme!'\r\n\r\n'That butler of hers--'\r\n\r\n'Jarniman, you mean: he's her butler, yes, the scoundrel--h'm-pah!\r\nHeaven forgive me! she's an honest woman at least; I wouldn't rob her of\r\nher little: fifty-nine or sixty next September, fifteenth of the month!\r\nwith the constitution of a broken drug-bottle, poor soul!  She hears\r\neverything from Jarniman: he catches wind of everything.  All foreseen,\r\nFenellan, foreseen.  I have made my stand at Lakelands, and there's my\r\nflag till it's hauled down over Victor Radnor.  London kills Nataly as\r\nwell as Fredi--and me: that is--I can use the words to you--I get back to\r\nprimal innocence in the country.  We all three have the feeling.  You're\r\na man to understand.  My beasts, and the wild flowers, hedge-banks, and\r\nstars.  Fredi's poetess will tell you.  Quiet waters reflecting.  I\r\nshould feel it in Paris as well, though they have nightingales in their\r\nBois.  It's the rustic I want to bathe me; and I had the feeling at\r\nschool, biting at Horace.  Well, this is my Sabine Farm, rather on a\r\nlarger scale, for the sake of friends.  Come, and pure air, water from\r\nthe springs, walks and rides in lanes, high sand-lanes; Nataly loves\r\nthem; Fredi worships the old roots of trees: she calls them the faces of\r\nthose weedy sandy lanes.  And the two dear souls on their own estate,\r\nFenellan!  And their poultry, cows, cream.  And a certain influence one\r\nhas in the country socially.  I make my stand on a home--not empty\r\npunctilio.'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan repeated, in a pause, 'Punctilio,' and not emphatically.\r\n\r\n'Don't bawl the word,' said Mr. Radnor, at the drum of whose ears it rang\r\nand sang.  'Here in the City the woman's harmless; and here,' he struck\r\nhis breast.  'But she can shoot and hit another through me.  Ah, the\r\nwitch!--poor wretch!  poor soul!  Only, she's malignant.  I could swear!\r\nBut Colney 's right for once in something he says about oaths--\"dropping\r\nempty buckets,\" or something.'\r\n\r\n'\"Empty buckets to haul up impotent demons, whom we have to pay as\r\nheavily as the ready devil himself,\"' Mr. Fenellan supplied the phrase.\r\n'Only, the moment old Colney moralizes, he's what the critics call\r\nsententious.  We've all a parlous lot too much pulpit in us.'\r\n\r\n'Come, Fenellan, I don't think .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, but it's true of me too.'\r\n\r\n'You reserve it for your enemies.'\r\n\r\n'I 'd like to distract it a bit from the biggest of 'em.'  He pointed\r\nfinger at the region of the heart.\r\n\r\n'Here we have Skepsey,' said Mr. Radnor, observing the rapid approach of\r\na lean small figure, that in about the time of a straight-aimed javelin's\r\ncast, shot from the doorway to the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BOTTLE\r\n\r\nThis little dart of a man came to a stop at a respectful distance from\r\nhis master, having the look of an arrested needle in mechanism.  His lean\r\nslip of face was an illumination of vivacious grey from the quickest of\r\nprominent large eyes.  He placed his master's letters legibly on the\r\ntable, and fell to his posture of attention, alert on stiff legs, the\r\nhands like sucking-cubs at play with one another.\r\n\r\nSkepsey waited for Mr. Fenellan to notice him.\r\n\r\n'How about the Schools for Boxing?' that gentleman said.\r\n\r\nDeploring in motion the announcement he had to make, Skepsey replied: 'I\r\nhave a difficulty in getting the plan treated seriously: a person of no\r\nstation:--it does not appear of national importance.  Ladies are against.\r\nThey decline their signatures; and ladies have great influence; because\r\nof the blood; which we know is very slight, rather healthy than not; and\r\nit could be proved for the advantage of the frailer sex.  They seem to be\r\nunaware of their own interests--ladies.  The contention all around us is\r\nwith ignorance.  My plan is written; I have shown it, and signatures of\r\ngentlemen, to many of our City notables favourable in most cases:\r\ngentlemen of the Stock Exchange highly.  The clergy and the medical\r\nprofession are quite with me.'\r\n\r\n'The surgical, perhaps you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Also, sir.  The clergy strongly.'\r\n\r\n'On the grounds of--what, Skepsey?'\r\n\r\n'Morality.  I have fully explained to them:--after his work at the desk\r\nall day, the young City clerk wants refreshment.  He needs it, must have\r\nit.  I propose to catch him on his way to his music-halls and other\r\nplaces, and take him to one of our establishments.  A short term of\r\ninstruction, and he would find a pleasure in the gloves; it would delight\r\nhim more than excesses-beer and tobacco.  The female in her right place,\r\ncertainly.'  Skepsey supplicated honest interpretation of his hearer, and\r\npursued\r\n\r\n'It would improve his physical strength, at the same time add to his\r\nsense of personal dignity.'\r\n\r\n'Would you teach females as well--to divert them from their frivolities?'\r\n\r\n'That would have to be thought over, sir.  It would be better for them\r\nthan using their nails.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know, Skepsey: I'm rather a Conservative there.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; with regard to the female, sir: I confess, my scheme does not\r\ninclude them.  They dance; that is a healthy exercise.  One has only to\r\nsay, that it does not add to the national force, in case of emergency.\r\nI look to that.  And I am particular in proposing an exercise independent\r\nof--I have to say--sex.  Not that there is harm in sex.  But we are for\r\ntraining.  I hope my meaning is clear?'\r\n\r\n'Quite.  You would have boxing with the gloves to be a kind of monastic\r\nrecreation.'\r\n\r\n'Recreation is the word, sir; I have often admired it,' said Skepsey,\r\nblinking, unsure of the signification of monastic.\r\n\r\n'I was a bit of a boxer once,' Mr. Fenellan said, conscious of height and\r\nbreadth in measuring the wisp of a figure before him.\r\n\r\n'Something might be done with you still, sir.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey paid him the encomium after a respectful summary of his gifts in\r\na glimpse.  Mr. Fenellan bowed to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor raised head from the notes he was pencilling upon letters\r\nperused.\r\n\r\n'Skepsey's craze: regeneration of the English race by boxing--nucleus of\r\na national army?'\r\n\r\n'To face an enemy at close quarters--it teaches that, sir.  I have always\r\nbeen of opinion, that courage may be taught.  I do not say heroism.  And\r\nsetting aside for a moment thoughts of an army, we create more valuable\r\ncitizens.  Protection to the weak in streets and by-places--shocking\r\nexamples of ruffians maltreating women, in view of a crowd.'\r\n\r\n'One strong man is an overmatch for your mob,' said Mr. Fenellan.\r\n\r\nSkepsey toned his assent to the diminishing thinness where a suspicion of\r\nthe negative begins to wind upon a distant horn.\r\n\r\n'Knowing his own intentions; and before an ignorant mob:--strong, you\r\nsay, sir?  I venture my word that a, decent lad, with science, would beat\r\nhim.  It is a question of the study and practice of first principles.'\r\n\r\n'If you were to see a rascal giant mishandling a woman?' Skepsey conjured\r\nthe scene by bending his head and peering abstractedly, as if over\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n'I would beg him to abstain, for his own sake.'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan knew that the little fellow was not boasting.\r\n\r\n'My brother Dartrey had a lesson or two from you in the first principles,\r\nI think?'\r\n\r\n'Captain Dartrey is an athlete, sir: exceedingly quick and clever; a hard\r\nboxer to beat.'\r\n\r\n'You will not call him captain when you see him; he has dismissed the\r\narmy.'\r\n\r\n'I much regret it, sir, much, that we have lost him.  Captain Dartrey\r\nFenellan was a beautiful fencer.  He gave me some instruction; unhappily,\r\nI have to acknowledge, too late.  It is a beautiful art.  Captain Dartrey\r\nsays, the French excel at it.  But it asks for a weapon, which nature has\r\nnot given: whereas the fists .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'So,' Mr. Radnor handed notes and papers to Skepsey: 'No sign of life?'\r\n\r\n'It is not yet seen in the City, sir.'\r\n\r\n'The first principles of commercial activity have retreated to earth's\r\nmaziest penetralia, where no tides are! is it not so, Skepsey?' said Mr.\r\nFenellan, whose initiative and exuberance in loquency had been restrained\r\nby a slight oppression, known to guests; especially to the guest in the\r\nearlier process of his magnification and illumination by virtue of a\r\ngrand old wine; and also when the news he has to communicate may be a\r\nstir to unpleasant heaps.  The shining lips and eyes of his florid face\r\nnow proclaimed speech, with his Puckish fancy jack-o'-lanterning over it.\r\n'Business hangs to swing at every City door, like a ragshop Doll, on the\r\ngallows of overproduction.  Stocks and Shares are hollow nuts not a\r\nsquirrel of the lot would stop to crack for sight of the milky kernel\r\nmouldered to beard.\r\n\r\nPercentage, like a cabman without a fare, has gone to sleep inside his\r\nvehicle.  Dividend may just be seen by tiptoe: stockholders, twinkling\r\nheels over the far horizon.  Too true!--and our merchants, brokers,\r\nbankers, projectors of Companies, parade our City to remind us of the\r\npoor steamed fellows trooping out of the burst-boiler-room of the big\r\nship Leviathan, in old years; a shade or two paler than the crowd o' the\r\npassengers, apparently alive and conversible, but corpses, all of them to\r\nlie their length in fifteen minutes.'\r\n\r\n'And you, Fenellan?' cried his host, inspired for a second bottle by the\r\nlovely nonsense of a voluble friend wound up to the mark.\r\n\r\n'Doctor of the ship!  with this prescription!' Mr. Fenellan held up his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n'Empty?'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan made it completely so.  'Confident!' he affirmed.\r\n\r\nAn order was tossed to the waiter, and both gentlemen screwed their lips\r\nin relish of his heavy consent to score off another bottle from the\r\nnarrow list.\r\n\r\n'At the office in forty minutes,' Skepsey's master nodded to him and shot\r\nhim forth, calling him back: 'By the way, in case a man named Jarniman\r\nshould ask to see me, you turn him to the rightabout.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey repeated: 'Jarniman !' and flew.\r\n\r\n'A good servant,' Mr. Radnor said.  'Few of us think of our country so\r\nmuch, whatever may be said of the specific he offers.  Colney has\r\nimpressed him somehow immensely: he studies to write too; pushes to\r\nimprove himself; altogether a worthy creature.'\r\n\r\nThe second bottle appeared.  The waiter, in sincerity a reluctant\r\nexecutioner, heightened his part for the edification of the admiring\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\n'Take heart, Benjamin,' said Mr. Fenellan; 'it's only the bottle dies;\r\nand we are the angels above to receive the spirit.'\r\n\r\n'I'm thinking of the house,' Benjamin replied.  He told them that again.\r\n\r\n'It 's the loss of the fame of having the wine, that he mourns.  But,\r\nBenjamin,' said Mr. Fenellan, 'the fame enters into the partakers of it,\r\nand we spread it, and perpetuate it for you.'\r\n\r\n'That don't keep a house upright,' returned Benjamin.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan murmured to himself: 'True enough, it 's elegy--though we\r\nperform it through a trumpet; and there's not a doubt of our being down\r\nor having knocked the world down, if we're loudly praised.'\r\n\r\nBenjamin waited to hear approval sounded on the lips uncertain as a woman\r\nis a wine of ticklish age.  The gentlemen nodded, and he retired.\r\n\r\nA second bottle, just as good as the first, should, one thoughtlessly\r\nsupposes, procure us a similar reposeful and excursive enjoyment, as of\r\nmen lying on their backs and flying imagination like a kite.  The effect\r\nwas quite other.  Mr. Radnor drank hastily and spoke with heat: 'You told\r\nme All? tell me that!'\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan gathered himself together; he sipped, and relaxed his\r\nbracing.  But there really was a bit more to tell: not much, was it?  Not\r\nlikely to puff a gale on the voluptuous indolence of a man drawn along by\r\nNereids over sunny sea-waves to behold the birth of the Foam-Goddess?\r\n'According to Carling, her lawyer; that is, he hints she meditates a\r\nblow.'\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Burman means to strike a blow?'\r\n\r\n'The lady.'\r\n\r\n'Does he think I fear any--does he mean a blow with a weapon?  Is it a\r\nlegal .  .  . ?  At last?  Fenellan!'\r\n\r\n'So I fancied I understood.'\r\n\r\n'But can the good woman dream of that as a blow to strike and hurt, for a\r\npunishment?--that's her one aim.'\r\n\r\n'She may have her hallucinations.'\r\n\r\n'But a blow--what a word for it!  But it's life to us life!  It's the\r\nblow we've prayed for.  Why, you know it!  Let her strike, we bless her.\r\nWe've never had an ill feeling to the woman; utterly the contrary--pity,\r\npity, pity!  Let her do that, we're at her feet, my Nataly and I.  If you\r\nknew what my poor girl suffers!  She 's a saint at the stake.  Chiefly on\r\nbehalf of her family.  Fenellan, you may have a sort of guess at my\r\nfortune: I'll own to luck; I put in a claim to courage and calculation.'\r\n\r\n'You've been a bulwark to your friends.'\r\n\r\n'All, Fenellan, all-stocks, shares, mines, companies, industries at home\r\nand--abroad--all, at a sweep, to have the woman strike that blow!\r\nCheerfully would I begin to build a fortune over again--singing!  Ha!\r\nthe woman has threatened it before.  It's probably feline play with us.'\r\n\r\nHis chin took support, he frowned.\r\n\r\n'You may have touched her.'\r\n\r\n'She won't be touched, and she won't be driven.  What 's the secret of\r\nher?  I can't guess, I never could.  She's a riddle.'\r\n\r\n'Riddles with wigs and false teeth have to be taken and shaken for the\r\nardently sought secret to reveal itself,' said Mr. Fenellan.\r\n\r\nHis picture, with the skeleton issue of any shaking, smote Mr. Radnor's\r\neyes, they turned over.  'Oh!--her charms!  She had a desperate belief in\r\nher beauty.  The woman 's undoubtedly charitable; she's not without a\r\nmind--sort of mind: well, it shows no crack till it's put to use.  Heart!\r\nyes, against me she has plenty of it.  They say she used to be courted;\r\nshe talked of it: \"my courtiers, Mr. Victor!\"  There, heaven forgive me,\r\nI wouldn't mock at her to another.'\r\n\r\n'It looks as if she were only inexorably human,' said Mr. Fenellan,\r\ncrushing a delicious gulp of the wine, that foamed along the channel to\r\nflavour.  'We read of the tester of a bandit-bed; and it flattened unwary\r\nrecumbents to pancakes.  An escape from the like of that seems pleadable,\r\nshould be: none but the drowsy would fail to jump out and run, or the\r\ninsane.'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor was taken with the illustration of his case.  'For the sake of\r\nmy sanity, it was!  to preserve my . . . . but any word makes nonsense of\r\nit.  Could--I must ask you--could any sane man--you were abroad in those\r\ndays, horrible days!  and never met her: I say, could you consent to be\r\ntied--I admit the vow, ceremony, so forth-tied to--I was barely twenty-\r\none: I put it to you, Fenellan, was it in reason an engagement--which\r\nis, I take it, a mutual plight of faith, in good faith; that is, with\r\ncapacity on both sides to keep the engagement: between the man you know\r\nI was in youth and a more than middle-aged woman crazy up to the edge of\r\nthe cliff--as Colney says half the world is, and she positively is when\r\nher spite is roused.  No, Fenellan, I have nothing on my conscience with\r\nregard to the woman.  She had wealth: I left her not one penny the worse\r\nfor--but she was not one to reckon it, I own.  She could be generous,\r\nwas, with her money.  If she had struck this blow--I know she thought of\r\nit: or if she would strike it now, I could not only forgive her, I could\r\nbeg forgiveness.'\r\n\r\nA sight of that extremity fetched prickles to his forehead.\r\n\r\n'You've borne your part bravely, my friend.'\r\n\r\n'I!' Mr. Radnor shrugged at mention of his personal burdens.  'Praise my\r\nNataly if you like!  Made for one another, if ever two in this world!\r\nYou know us both, and do you doubt it?  The sin would have been for us\r\ntwo to meet and--but enough when I say, that I am she, she me, till death\r\nand beyond it: that's my firm faith.  Nataly teaches me the religion of\r\nlife, and you may learn what that is when you fall in love with a woman.\r\nEighteen-nineteen-twenty years!'\r\n\r\nTears fell from him, two drops.  He blinked, bugled in his throat, eyed\r\nhis watch, and smiled: 'The finishing glass!  We should have had to put\r\nColney to bed.  Few men stand their wine.  You and I are not lamed by it;\r\nwe can drink and do business: my first experience in the City was, that\r\nthe power to drink--keeping a sound head--conduces to the doing of\r\nbusiness.'\r\n\r\n'It's a pleasant way of instructing men to submit to their conqueror.'\r\n\r\n'If it doubles the energies, mind.'\r\n\r\n'Not if it fiddles inside.  I confess to that effect upon me.  I've a\r\nwaltz going on, like the snake with the tail in his mouth, eternal; and\r\nit won't allow of a thought upon Investments.'\r\n\r\n'Consult me to-morrow,' said Mr. Radnor, somewhat pained for having\r\ninconsiderately misled the man he had hitherto helpfully guided.\r\n'You've looked at the warehouse?'\r\n\r\n'That's performed.'\r\n\r\n'Make a practice of getting over as much of your business in the early\r\nmorning as you well can.'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor added hints of advice to a frail humanity he was indulgent,\r\nthe giant spoke in good fellowship.  It would have been to have strained\r\nhis meaning, for purposes of sarcasm upon him, if one had taken him to\r\nboast of a personal exemption from our common weakness.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and laughed: 'Now I 'm pumping my pulpit-eh?  You come with\r\nus to Lakelands.  I drive the ladies down to my office, ten A.M.: if it's\r\nfine; train half-past.  We take a basket.  By the way, I had no letter\r\nfrom Dartrey last mail.'\r\n\r\n'He has buried his wife.  It happens to some men.'\r\n\r\nMr. Radnor stood gazing.  He asked for the name of the place of the\r\nburial.  He heard without seizing it.  A simulacrum spectre-spark of\r\nhopefulness shot up in his imagination, glowed and quivered, darkening at\r\nthe utterance of the Dutch syllables, leaving a tinge of witless envy.\r\nDartrey--Fenellan had buried the wife whose behaviour vexed and\r\ndishonoured him: and it was in Africa!  One would have to go to Africa to\r\nbe free of the galling.  But Dartrey had gone, and he was free!--The\r\nstrange faint freaks of our sensations when struck to leap and throw off\r\ntheir load after a long affliction, play these disorderly pranks on the\r\nbrain; and they are faint, but they come in numbers, they are recurring,\r\nalways in ambush.  We do not speak of them: we have not words to stamp\r\nthe indefinite things; generally we should leave them unspoken if we had\r\nthe words; we know them as out of reason: they haunt us, pluck at us,\r\nfret us, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nDartrey free, he was relieved of the murderous drama incessantly in the\r\nmind of shackled men.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like one of the miracles of a divine intervention, that Dartrey\r\nshould be free, suddenly free; and free while still a youngish man.  He\r\nwas in himself a wonderful fellow, the pick of his country for vigour,\r\ngallantry, trustiness, high-mindedness; his heavenly good fortune decked\r\nhim as a prodigy.\r\n\r\n'No harm to the head from that fall of yours?' Mr. Fenellan said.\r\n\r\n'None.' Mr. Radnor withdrew his hand from head to hat, clapped it on and\r\ncried cheerily: 'Now to business'; as men may, who have confidence in\r\ntheir ability to concentrate an instant attention upon the substantial.\r\n'You dine with us.  The usual Quartet: Peridon, Pempton, Colney, Yatt, or\r\nCatkin: Priscilla Graves and Nataly--the Rev. Septimus; Cormyn and his\r\nwife: Young Dudley Sowerby and I--flutes: he has precision, as naughty\r\nFredi said, when some one spoke of expression.  In the course of the\r\nevening, Lady Grace, perhaps: you like her.'\r\n\r\n'Human nature in the upper circle is particularly likeable.'\r\n\r\n'Fenellan,' said Mr. Radnor, emboldened to judge hopefully of his\r\nfortunes by mere pressure of the thought of Dartrey's, 'I put it to you:\r\nwould you say, that there is anything this time behind your friend\r\nCarling's report?'\r\n\r\nAlthough it had not been phrased as a report, Mr. Fenellan's answering\r\nlook and gesture, and a run of indiscriminate words, enrolled it in that\r\nform, greatly to the inspiriting of Mr. Radnor.\r\n\r\nOld Veuve in one, to the soul of Old Veuve in the other, they recalled a\r\npast day or two, touched the skies; and merriment or happiness in the\r\ntimes behind them held a mirror to the present: or the hour of the\r\nreverse of happiness worked the same effect by contrast: so that notions\r\nof the singular election of us by Dame Fortune, sprang like vinous\r\nbubbles.  For it is written, that however powerful you be, you shall not\r\ntake the Winegod on board to entertain him as a simple passenger; and you\r\nmay captain your vessel, you may pilot it, and keep to your reckonings,\r\nand steer for all the ports you have a mind to, even to doing profitable\r\nexchange with Armenian and Jew, and still you shall do the something\r\nmore, which proves that the Winegod is on board: he is the pilot of your\r\nblood if not the captain of your thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. Fenellan was unused to the copious outpouring of Victor Radnor's\r\nconfidences upon his domestic affairs; and the unwonted excitement of\r\nVictor's manner of speech would have perplexed him, had there not been\r\nsuch a fiddling of the waltz inside him.\r\n\r\nPayment for the turtle and the bottles of Old Veuve was performed\r\napart with Benjamin, while Simeon Fenellan strolled out of the house,\r\nquestioning a tumbled mind as to what description of suitable\r\nentertainment, which would be dancing and flirting and fal-lallery in the\r\nseason of youth, London City could provide near meridian hours for a man\r\nof middle age carrying his bottle of champagne, like a guest of an old-\r\nfashioned wedding-breakfast.  For although he could stand his wine as\r\nwell as his friend, his friend's potent capacity martially after the\r\nfeast to buckle to business at a sign of the clock, was beyond him.\r\nIt pointed to one of the embodied elements, hot from Nature's workshop.\r\nIt told of the endurance of powers, that partly explained the successful,\r\nastonishing career of his friend among a people making urgent, if\r\nunequal, demands perpetually upon stomach and head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON WALK WESTWARD\r\n\r\nIn that nationally interesting Poem, or Dramatic Satire, once famous,\r\nTHE RAJAH IN LONDON (London, Limbo and Sons, 1889), now obliterated\r\nunder the long wash of Press-matter, the reflection--not unknown to\r\nphilosophical observers, and natural perhaps in the mind of an Oriental\r\nPrince--produced by his observation of the march of London citizens\r\nEastward at morn, Westward at eve, attributes their practice to a\r\nsurvival of the Zoroastrian form of worship.  His Minister, favourable\r\nto the people or for the sake of fostering an idea in his Master's head,\r\nremarks, that they show more than the fidelity of the sunflower to her\r\nGod.  The Rajah, it would appear, frowns interrogatively, in the princely\r\nfashion, accusing him of obscureness of speech:--princes and the louder\r\nmembers of the grey public are fraternally instant to spurn at the whip\r\nof that which they do not immediately comprehend.  It is explained by the\r\nMinister: not even the flower, he says, would hold constant, as they, to\r\nthe constantly unseen--a trebly cataphractic Invisible.  The Rajah\r\nprofesses curiosity to know how it is that the singular people nourish\r\ntheir loyalty, since they cannot attest to the continued being of the\r\nobject in which they put their faith.  He is informed by his prostrate\r\nservant of a settled habit they have of diligently seeking their\r\nDivinity, hidden above, below; and of copiously taking inside them doses\r\nof what is denied to their external vision: thus they fortify credence\r\nchemically on an abundance of meats and liquors; fire they eat, and they\r\ndrink fire; they become consequently instinct with fire.  Necessarily\r\ntherefore they believe in fire.  Believing, they worship.  Worshipping,\r\nthey march Eastward at morn, Westward at eve.  For that way lies the key,\r\nthis way the cupboard, of the supplies, their fuel.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stage directions, THE RAJAH AND HIS MINISTER Enter a Gin-\r\nPalace.--It is to witness a service that they have learnt to appreciate\r\nas Anglicanly religious.\r\n\r\nOn the step of the return to their Indian clime, they speak of the hatted\r\nsect, which is most, or most commercially, succoured and fattened by our\r\nrule there: they wave adieu to the conquering Islanders, as to 'Parsees\r\nbeneath a cloud.'\r\n\r\nThe two are seen last on the deck of the vessel, in perusal of a medical\r\npamphlet composed of statistics and sketches, traceries, horrid blots,\r\ndiagrams with numbers referring to notes, of the various maladies caused\r\nby the prolonged prosecution of that form of worship.\r\n\r\n'But can they suffer so and live?' exclaims the Rajah, vexed by the\r\nphysical sympathetic twinges which set him wincing.\r\n\r\n'Science,' his Minister answers, 'took them up where Nature, in pity of\r\ntheir martyrdom, dropped them.  They do not live; they are engines,\r\ninsensible things of repairs and patches; insteamed to pursue their\r\ninfuriate course, to the one end of exhausting supplies for the renewing\r\nof them, on peril of an instant suspension if they deviate a step or\r\nstop: nor do they.'\r\n\r\nThe Rajah is of opinion, that he sails home with the key of the riddle of\r\ntheir power to vanquish.  In some apparent allusion to an Indian story of\r\na married couple who successfully made their way, he accounts for their\r\nsolid and resistless advance, resembling that of--\r\n\r\n                         The doubly-wedded man and wife,\r\n               Pledged to each other and against the world\r\n               With mutual union.\r\n\r\nOne would like to think of the lengthened tide-flux of pedestrian\r\ncitizens facing South-westward, as being drawn by devout attraction to\r\nour nourishing luminary: at the hour, mark, when the Norland cloud-king,\r\nafter a day of wild invasion, sits him on his restful bank of bluefish\r\nsmack-o'-cheek red above Whitechapel, to spy where his last puff of icy\r\njavelins pierces and dismembers the vapoury masses in cluster about the\r\ncircle of flame descending upon the greatest and most elevated of\r\nAdmirals at the head of the Strand, with illumination of smoke-plumed\r\nchimneys, house-roofs, window-panes, weather-vanes, monument and\r\npedimental monsters, and omnibus umbrella.  One would fair believe that\r\nthey advance admireing; they are assuredly made handsome by the beams.\r\nNo longer mere concurrent atoms of the furnace of business (from coal-\r\ndust to sparks, rushing, as it were, on respiratory blasts of an enormous\r\nengine's centripetal and centrifugal energy), their step is leisurely to\r\nmeet the rosy Dinner, which is ever a see-saw with the God of Light in\r\nhis fall; the mask of the noble human visage upon them is not roughened,\r\nas at midday, by those knotted hard ridges of the scrambler's hand seen\r\nfrom forehead down to jaw; when indeed they have all the appearance of\r\nsour scientific productions.  And unhappily for the national portrait, in\r\nthe Poem quoted, the Rajah's Minister chose an hour between morning and\r\nmeridian, or at least before an astonished luncheon had come to composure\r\ninside their persons, for drawing his Master's attention to the quaint\r\nsimilarity of feature in the units of the busy antish congregates they\r\nhad travelled so far to visit and to study:\r\n\r\n                              These Britons wear\r\n               The driven and perplexed look of men\r\n               Begotten hastily 'twixt business hours\r\n\r\nIt could not have been late afternoon.\r\n\r\nThese Orientals should have seen them, with Victor Radnor among them,\r\nfronting the smoky splendours of the sunset.  In April, the month of\r\npiled and hurried cloud, it is a Rape of the Sabines overhead from all\r\nquarters, either one of the winds brawnily larcenous; and London, smoking\r\nroyally to the open skies, builds images of a dusty epic fray for\r\npossession of the portly dames.  There is immensity, swinging motion,\r\ncollision, dusky richness of colouring, to the sight; and to the mind\r\nidea.  London presents it.  If we can allow ourselves a moment for not\r\ninquireing scrupulously (you will do it by inhaling the aroma of the ripe\r\nkitchen hour), here is a noble harmony of heaven and the earth of the\r\nworks of man, speaking a grander tongue than barren sea or wood or\r\nwilderness.  Just a moment; it goes; as, when a well-attuned barrel-organ\r\nin a street has drawn us to recollections of the Opera or Italy, another\r\nharshly crashes, and the postman knocks at doors, and perchance a\r\ncostermonger cries his mash of fruit, a beggar woman wails her hymn.\r\nFor the pinched are here, the dinnerless, the weedy, the gutter-growths,\r\nthe forces repressing them.  That grand tongue of the giant City inspires\r\nnone human to Bardic eulogy while we let those discords be.  An\r\nembittered Muse of Reason prompts her victims to the composition of the\r\nadulatory Essay and of the Leading Article, that she may satiate an angry\r\nirony 'upon those who pay fee for their filling with the stuff.  Song of\r\npraise she does not permit.  A moment of satisfaction in a striking\r\npicture is accorded, and no more.  For this London, this England, Europe,\r\nworld, but especially this London, is rather a thing for hospital\r\noperations than for poetic rhapsody; in aspect, too, streaked scarlet\r\nand pock-pitted under the most cumbrous of jewelled tiaras; a Titanic\r\nwork of long-tolerated pygmies; of whom the leaders, until sorely\r\ndiscomforted in body and doubtful in soul, will give gold and labour,\r\nwill impose restrictions upon activity, to maintain a conservatism of\r\ndiseases.  Mind is absent, or somewhere so low down beneath material\r\naccumulations that it is inexpressive, powerless to drive the ponderous\r\nbulk to such excisings, purgeings, purifyings as might--as may, we will\r\nsuppose, render it acceptable, for a theme of panegyric, to the Muse of\r\nReason; ultimately, with her consent, to the Spirit of Song.\r\n\r\nBut first there must be the cleansing.  When Night has fallen upon\r\nLondon, the Rajah remarks:\r\n\r\n               Monogamic Societies present\r\n               A decent visage and a hideous rear.\r\n\r\nHis Minister (satirically, or in sympathetic Conservatism) would have\r\nthem not to move on, that they may preserve among beholders the\r\nimpression of their handsome frontage.  Night, however, will come; and\r\nthey, adoreing the decent face, are moved on, made to expose what the\r\nRajah sees.  Behind his courteousness, he is an antagonistic observer of\r\nhis conquerors; he pushes his questions farther than the need for them;\r\nhis Minister the same; apparently to retain the discountenanced people in\r\ntheir state of exposure.  Up to the time of the explanation of the puzzle\r\non board the departing vessel (on the road to Windsor, at the Premier's\r\nreception, in the cell of the Police, in the presence of the Magistrate-\r\nwhose crack of a totally inverse decision upon their case, when he\r\nbecomes acquainted with the titles and station of these imputedly\r\npeccant, refreshes them), they hold debates over the mysterious\r\ncontrarieties of a people professing in one street what they confound\r\nin the next, and practising by day a demureness that yells with the\r\ncat of the tiles at night.\r\n\r\nGranting all that, it being a transient novelist's business to please the\r\nlight-winged hosts which live for the hour, and give him his only chance\r\nof half of it, let him identify himself with them, in keeping to the\r\nquadrille on the surface and shirking the disagreeable.\r\n\r\nClouds of high colour above London City are as the light of the Goddess\r\nto lift the angry heroic head over human.  They gloriously transfigure.\r\nA Murillo beggar is not more precious than sight of London in any of the\r\nstreets admitting coloured cloud-scenes; the cunning of the sun's hand so\r\nspeaks to us.  And if haply down an alley some olive mechanic of street-\r\norgans has quickened little children's legs to rhythmic footing, they\r\nstrike on thoughts braver than pastoral.  Victor Radnor, lover of the\r\ncountry though he was, would have been the first to say it.  He would\r\nindeed have said it too emphatically.  Open London as a theme, to a\r\ncitizen of London ardent for the clear air out of it, you have roused an\r\norator; you have certainly fired a magazine, and must listen to his\r\nreminiscences of one of its paragraphs or pages.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the hurtled fair ones in sky were wreathing Nelson's\r\ncocked hat when Victor, distinguishably bright-faced amid a crowd of the\r\nirradiated, emerged from the tideway to cross the square, having thoughts\r\nupon Art, which were due rather to the suggestive proximity of the\r\nNational Gallery than to the Flemish mouldings of cloud-forms under\r\nVenetian brushes.  His purchases of pictures had been his unhappiest\r\nventures.  He had relied and reposed on the dicta of newspaper critics;\r\nwho are sometimes unanimous, and are then taken for guides, and are\r\nfatal.  He was led to the conclusion that our modern-lauded pictures\r\ndo not ripen.  They have a chance of it, if abused.  But who thinks of\r\nbuying the abused?  Exalted by the critics, they have, during the days\r\nof Exhibition, a glow, a significance or a fun, abandoning them where\r\nexamination is close and constant, and the critic's trumpet-note\r\ndispersed to the thinness of the fee for his blowing.  As to foreign\r\npictures, classic pictures, Victor had known his purse to leap for a\r\nRaphael with a history in stages of descent from the Master, and critics\r\nto swarm: a Raphael of the dealers, exposed to be condemned by the\r\ncritics, universally derided.  A real Raphael in your house is\r\naristocracy to the roof-tree.  But the wealthy trader will reach to\r\ntitle before he may hope to get the real Raphael or a Titian.  Yet he\r\nis the one who would, it may be, after enjoyment of his prize, bequeath\r\nit to the nation--PRESENTED TO THE NATION BY VICTOR MONTGOMERY RADNOR.\r\nThere stood the letters in gilt; and he had a thrill of his generosity;\r\nfor few were the generous acts he could not perform; and if an object\r\nhaunted the deed, it came of his trader's habit of mind.\r\n\r\nHe revelled in benevolent projects of gifts to the nation, which would\r\ncoat a sensitive name.  Say, an ornamental City Square, flowers,\r\nfountains, afternoon bands of music--comfortable seats in it, and a\r\nshelter, and a ready supply of good cheap coffee or tea.  Tobacco?\r\nwhy not rolls of honest tobacco! nothing so much soothes the labourer.\r\nA volume of plans for the benefit of London smoked out of each ascending\r\npile in his brain.  London is at night a moaning outcast round the\r\npoliceman's' legs.  What of an all-night-long, cosy, brightly lighted,\r\nodoriferous coffee-saloon for rich or poor, on the model of the\r\nhospitable Paduan?  Owner of a penny, no soul among us shall be\r\nrightly an outcast .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nDreams of this kind are taken at times by wealthy people as a cordial at\r\nthe bar of benevolent intentions.  But Victor was not the man to steal\r\nhis refreshments in that known style.  He meant to make deeds of them,\r\nas far as he could, considering their immense extension; and except for\r\nthe sensitive social name, he was of single-minded purpose.\r\n\r\nTurning to the steps of a chemist's shop to get a prescription made up\r\nfor his Nataly's doctoring of her domestics, he was arrested by a rap on\r\nhis elbow; and no one was near; and there could not be a doubt of the\r\nblow--a sharp hard stroke, sparing the funny-bone, but ringing.  His\r\nhead, at the punctilio bump, throbbed responsively--owing to which or\r\nindifference to the prescription, as of no instant requirement, he\r\npursued his course, resembling mentally the wanderer along a misty beach,\r\nwho hears cannon across the waters.\r\n\r\nHe certainly had felt it.  He remembered the shock: he could not remember\r\nmuch of pain.  How about intimations?  His asking caused a smile.\r\n\r\nVery soon the riddle answered itself.  He had come into view of the\r\ndiminutive marble cavalier of the infantile cerebellum; recollecting a\r\ncouplet from the pen of the disrespectful Satirist Peter, he thought of a\r\nfall: his head and his elbow responded simultaneously to the thought.\r\n\r\nAll was explained save his consequent rightabout from the chemist's shop:\r\nand that belongs to the minor involutions of circumstances and the will.\r\nIt passed like a giver's wrinkle.  He read the placards of the Opera;\r\nreminding himself of the day when it was the single Opera-house; and now\r\nwe have two-or three.  We have also a distracting couple of Clowns and\r\nPantaloons in our Pantomimes: though Colney says that the multiplication\r\nof the pantaloon is a distinct advance to representative truth--and\r\nbother Colney!  Two Columbines also.  We forbear to speak of men, but\r\nwhere is the boy who can set his young heart upon two Columbines at once!\r\nVictor felt the boy within him cold to both: and in his youth he had\r\ndoated on the solitary twirling spangled lovely Fairy.  The tale of a\r\ndelicate lady dancer leaping as the kernel out of a nut from the arms of\r\nHarlequin to the legalized embrace of a wealthy brewer, and thenceforth\r\nliving, by repute, with unagitated legs, as holy a matron, despite her\r\nstarry past, as any to be shown in a country breeding the like\r\nabundantly, had always delighted him.  It seemed a reconcilement of\r\nopposing stations, a defeat of Puritanism.  Ay, and poor women!--women in\r\nthe worser plight under the Puritan's eye.  They may be erring and good:\r\nyes, finding the man to lift them the one step up!  Read the history of\r\nthe error.  But presently we shall teach the Puritan to act by the\r\nstandards of his religion.  All is coming right--must come right.  Colney\r\nshall be confounded.\r\n\r\nHereupon Victor hopped on to Fenellan's hint regarding the designs of\r\nMrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nHis Nataly might have to go through a short sharp term of scorching--\r\nGodiva to the gossips.\r\n\r\nShe would come out of it glorified.  She would be reconciled with her\r\nfamily.  With her story of her devotion to the man loving her, the world\r\nwould know her for the heroine she was: a born lady, in appearance and\r\nmanner an empress among women.  It was a story to be pleaded in any\r\ncourt, before the sternest public.  Mrs. Burman had thrown her into\r\ntemptation's way.  It was a story to touch the heart, as none other ever\r\nwritten of over all the earth was there a woman equalling his Nataly!\r\n\r\nAnd their Nesta would have a dowry to make princesses envious:--she would\r\ninherit .  .  .  he ran up an arithmetical column, down to a line of\r\nfigures in addition, during three paces of his feet.  Dartrey Fenellan\r\nhad said of little Nesta once, that she had a nature pure and sparkling\r\nas mid-sea foam.  Happy he who wins her!  But she was one of the young\r\nwomen who are easily pleased and hardly enthralled.  Her father strained\r\nhis mind for the shape of the man to accomplish the feat.  Whether she\r\nhad an ideal of a youth in her feminine head, was beyond his guessing.\r\nShe was not the damsel to weave a fairy waistcoat for the identical\r\nprince, and try it upon all comers to discover him: as is done by some;\r\nexcuseably, if we would be just.  Nesta was of the elect, for whom\r\nexcuses have not to be made.  She would probably like a flute-player\r\nbest; because her father played the flute, and she loved him--laughably\r\na little maiden's reason!  Her father laughed at her.\r\n\r\nAlong the street of Clubs, where a bruised fancy may see black balls\r\nraining, the narrow way between ducal mansions offers prospect of the\r\nsweep of greensward, all but touching up to the sunset to draw it to the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nFormerly, in his very early youth, he clasped a dream of gaining way\r\nto an alliance with one of these great surrounding houses; and he had\r\na passion for the acquisition of money as a means.  And it has to be\r\nconfessed, he had sacrificed in youth a slice of his youth, to gain it\r\nwithout labour--usually a costly purchase.  It had ended disastrously: or\r\nsay, a running of the engine off the rails, and a speedy re-establishment\r\nof traffic.  Could it be a loss, that had led to the winning of his\r\nNataly?  Can we really loathe the first of the steps when the one in\r\ndue sequence, cousin to it, is a blessedness?  If we have been righted\r\nto health by a medical draught, we are bound to be respectful to our\r\ndrug.  And so we are, in spite of Nature's wry face and shiver at a\r\nmention of what we went through during those days, those horrible days:\r\n--hide them!\r\n\r\nThe smothering of them from sight set them sounding he had to listen.\r\nColney Durance accused him of entering into bonds with somebody's\r\ngrandmother for the simple sake of browsing on her thousands: a picture\r\nof himself too abhorrent to Victor to permit of any sort of acceptance.\r\nConsequently he struck away to the other extreme of those who have a\r\nchoice in mixed motives: he protested that compassion had been the cause\r\nof it.  Looking at the circumstance now, he could see, allowing for human\r\nfrailty-perhaps a wish to join the ranks of the wealthy compassion for\r\nthe woman as the principal motive.  How often had she not in those old\r\ndays praised his generosity for allying his golden youth to her withered\r\nage--Mrs. Burman's very words!  And she was a generous woman or had been:\r\nshe was generous in saying that.  Well, and she was generous in having a\r\nwell-born, well-bred beautiful young creature like Nataly for her\r\ncompanion, when it was a case of need for the dear girl; and\r\ncompassionately insisting, against remonstrances: they were spoken by\r\nhim, though they were but partial.  How, then, had she become--at least,\r\nhow was it that she could continue to behave as the vindictive Fury who\r\npersecuted remorselessly, would give no peace, poisoned the wells round\r\nevery place where he and his dear one pitched their tent!\r\n\r\nBut at last she had come to charity, as he could well believe.  Not too\r\nlate!  Victor's feeling of gratitude to Mrs. Burman assured him it was\r\ngenuine because of his genuine conviction, that she had determined to end\r\nher incomprehensibly lengthened days in reconcilement with him: and he\r\nhad always been ready to 'forget and forgive.' A truly beautiful old\r\nphrase!  It thrilled off the most susceptible of men.\r\n\r\nHis well-kept secret of the spacious country-house danced him behind a\r\nsober demeanour from one park to another; and along beside the drive to\r\nview of his townhouse--unbeloved of the inhabitants, although by\r\nacknowledgement it had, as Fredi funnily drawled, to express her sense\r\nof justice in depreciation, 'good accommodation.'  Nataly was at home,\r\nhe was sure.  Time to be dressing: sun sets at six-forty, he said, and\r\nglanced at the stained West, with an accompanying vision of outspread\r\nprimroses flooding banks of shadowy fields near Lakelands.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the road and rang.\r\n\r\nUpon the opening of the door, there was a cascade of muslin downstairs.\r\nHis darling Fredi stood out of it, a dramatic Undine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNATALY\r\n\r\n'Il segreto!' the girl cried commandingly, with a forefinger at his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nHe crossed arms, toning in similar recitative, with anguish,\r\n'Dove volare!'\r\n\r\nThey joined in half a dozen bars of operatic duet.\r\n\r\nShe flew to him, embraced and kissed.\r\n\r\n'I must have it, my papa! unlock.  I've been spying the bird on its\r\nhedgerow nest so long!  And this morning, my own dear cunning papa,\r\nweren't you as bare as winter twigs?  \"Tomorrow perhaps we will have a\r\nday in the country.\"  To go and see the nest?  Only, please, not a big\r\none.  A real nest; where mama and I can wear dairymaid's hat and apron\r\nall day--the style you like; and strike roots.  We've been torn away two\r\nor three times: twice, I know.'\r\n\r\n'Fixed, this time; nothing shall tear us up,' said her father, moving on\r\nto the stairs, with an arm about her.\r\n\r\n'So, it is .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'She's amazed at her cleverness!'\r\n\r\n'A nest for three?'\r\n\r\n'We must have a friend or two.'\r\n\r\n'And pretty country?'\r\n\r\n'Trust her papa for that.'\r\n\r\n'Nice for walking and running over fields?  No rich people?'\r\n\r\n'How escape that rabble in England! as Colney says.  It's a place for\r\nbeing quite independent of neighbours, free as air.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  bravo!'\r\n\r\n'And Fredi will have her horse, and mama her pony-carriage; and Fredi can\r\nhave a swim every Summer morning.'\r\n\r\n'A swim?' Her note was dubious.  'A river?'\r\n\r\n'A good long stretch--fairish, fairish.  Bit of a lake; bathing-shed; the\r\nNaiad's bower: pretty water to see.'\r\n\r\n'Ah.  And has the house a name?'\r\n\r\n'Lakelands.  I like the name.'\r\n\r\n'Papa gave it the name!'\r\n\r\n'There's nothing he can conceal from his girl.  Only now and then a\r\nlittle surprise.'\r\n\r\n'And his girl is off her head with astonishment.  But tell me, who has\r\nbeen sharing the secret with you?'\r\n\r\n'Fredi strikes home!  And it is true, you dear; I must have a confidant:\r\nSimeon Fenellan.'\r\n\r\n'Not Mr. Durance?'\r\n\r\nHe shook out a positive negative.  'I leave Col to his guesses.  He'd\r\nhave been prophesying fire the works before the completion.'\r\n\r\n'Then it is not a dear old house, like Craye and Creckholt?'\r\n\r\n'Wait and see to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the customary guests for concert practice; the music,\r\ninstrumental and vocal; quartet, duet, solo; and advising the girl to be\r\nquick, as she had but twenty-five minutes, he went humming and trilling\r\ninto his dressing-room.\r\n\r\nNesta signalled at her mother's door for permission to enter.  She\r\nslipped in, saw that the maid was absent, and said: 'Yes, mama; and\r\nprepare, I feared it; I was sure.'\r\n\r\nHer mother breathed a little moan: 'Not a cottage?'\r\n\r\n'He has not mentioned it to Mr. Durance.'\r\n\r\n'Why not?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Fenellan has been his confidant.'\r\n\r\n'My darling, we did wrong to let it go on, without speaking.  You don't\r\nknow for certain yet?'\r\n\r\n'It's a large estate, mama, and a big new house.'\r\n\r\nNataly's bosom sank.  'Ah me! here's misery!  I ought to have known.\r\nAnd too late now it has gone so far!  But I never imagined he would be\r\nbuilding.'\r\n\r\nShe caught herself languishing at her toilette-glass, as, if her beauty\r\nwere at stake; and shut her eyelids angrily.  To be looking in that\r\nmanner, for a mere suspicion, was too foolish.  But Nesta's divinations\r\nwere target-arrows; they flew to the mark.  Could it have been expected\r\nthat Victor would ever do anything on a small scale?  O the dear little\r\nlost lost cottage!  She thought of it with a strain of the arms of\r\nwomanhood's longing in the unblessed wife for a babe.  For the secluded\r\nmodest cottage would not rack her with the old anxieties, beset her with\r\nsuspicions.  .  .  .\r\n\r\n'My child, you won't possibly have time before the dinner-hour,' she said\r\nto Nesta, dismissing her and taking her kiss of comfort with a short and\r\nstraining look out of the depths.\r\n\r\nThose bitter doubts of the sentiments of neighbours are an incipient\r\ndislike, when one's own feelings to the neighbours are kind, could be\r\naffectionate.  We are distracted, perverted, made strangers to ourselves\r\nby a false position.\r\n\r\nShe heard his voice on a carol.  Men do not feel this doubtful position\r\nas women must.  They have not the same to endure; the world gives them\r\nland to tread, where women are on breaking seas.  Her Nesta knew no more\r\nthan the pain of being torn from a home she loved.  But now the girl was\r\nolder, and if once she had her imagination awakened, her fearful\r\ndirectness would touch the spot, question, bring on the scene to-come,\r\nnecessarily to come, dreaded much more than death by her mother.  But\r\nif it might be postponed till the girl was nearer to an age of grave\r\nunderstanding, with some knowledge of our world, some comprehension of a\r\ncase that could be pleaded!\r\n\r\nHe sang: he never acknowledged a trouble, he dispersed it; and in her\r\npresent wrestle with the scheme of a large country estate involving new\r\nintimacies, anxieties, the courtship of rival magnates, followed by the\r\nwretched old cloud, and the imposition upon them to bear it in silence\r\nthough they knew they could plead a case, at least before charitable and\r\ndiscerning creatures or before heaven, the despondent lady could have\r\nasked whether he was perfectly sane.\r\n\r\nWho half so brilliantly!--Depreciation of him, fetched up at a stroke the\r\nglittering armies of her enthusiasm.  He had proved it; he proved it\r\ndaily in conflicts and in victories that dwarfed emotional troubles like\r\nhers: yet they were something to bear, hard to bear, at times unbearable.\r\n\r\nBut those were times of weakness.  Let anything be doubted rather than\r\nthe good guidance of the man who was her breath of life!  Whither he led,\r\nlet her go, not only submissively, exultingly.\r\n\r\nThus she thought, under pressure of the knowledge, that unless rushing\r\ninto conflicts bigger than conceivable, she had to do it, and should\r\ntherefore think it.\r\n\r\nThis was the prudent woman's clear deduction from the state wherein\r\nshe found herself, created by the one first great step of the mad woman.\r\nHer surrender then might be likened to the detachment of a flower on the\r\nriver's bank by swell of flood: she had no longer root of her own; away\r\nshe sailed, through beautiful scenery, with occasionally a crashing fall,\r\na turmoil, emergence from a vortex, and once more the sunny whirling\r\nsurface.  Strange to think, she had not since then power to grasp in her\r\nabstract mind a notion of stedfastness without or within.\r\n\r\nBut, say not the mad, say the enamoured woman.  Love is a madness, having\r\nheaven's wisdom in it--a spark.  But even when it is driving us on the\r\nbreakers, call it love: and be not unworthy of it, hold to it.  She and\r\nVictor had drunk of a cup.  The philtre was in her veins, whatever the\r\ndirections of the rational mind.\r\n\r\nExulting or regretting, she had to do it, as one in the car with a racing\r\ncharioteer.  Or up beside a more than Titanically audacious balloonist.\r\nFor the charioteer is bent on a goal; and Victor's course was an\r\nascension from heights to heights.  He had ideas, he mastered Fortune.\r\nHe conquered Nataly and held her subject, in being above his ambition;\r\nwhich was now but an occupation for his powers, while the aim of his life\r\nwas at the giving and taking of simple enjoyment.  In spite of his fits\r\nof unreasonableness in the means--and the woman loving him could trace\r\nthem to a breath of nature--his gentle good friendly innocent aim in life\r\nwas of this very simplest; so wonderful, by contrast with his powers,\r\nthat she, assured of it as she was by experience of him, was touched,\r\nin a transfusion of her feelings through lucent globes of admiration and\r\nof tenderness, to reverence.  There had been occasions when her wish for\r\nthe whole world to have proof and exhibition of his greatness, goodness,\r\nand simplicity amid his gifts, prompted her incitement of him to stand\r\nforth eminently: 'lead a kingdom,' was the phrase behind the curtain\r\nwithin her shy bosom); and it revealed her to herself, upon reflection,\r\nas being still the Nataly who drank the cup with him, to join her fate\r\nwith his.\r\n\r\nAnd why not?  Was that regretted?  Far from it.  In her maturity, the\r\nwoman was unable to send forth any dwelling thought or more than a flight\r\nof twilight fancy, that cancelled the deed of her youth, and therewith\r\nseemed to expunge near upon the half--of her term of years.  If it came\r\nto consideration of her family and the family's opinion of her conduct,\r\nher judgement did not side with them or with herself, it whirled, swam to\r\na giddiness and subsided.\r\n\r\nOf course, if she and Victor were to inhabit a large country-house,\r\nthey might as well have remained at Craye Farm or at Creckholt; both\r\nplaces dear to them in turn.  Such was the plain sense of the surface\r\nquestion.  And how strange it was to her, that he, of the most quivering\r\nsensitiveness on her behalf; could not see, that he threw her into\r\nsituations where hard words of men and women threatened about her head;\r\nwhere one or two might on a day, some day, be heard; and where, in the\r\nrecollection of two years back, the word 'Impostor' had smacked her on\r\nboth cheeks from her own mouth.\r\n\r\nNow once more they were to run the same round of alarms, undergo the love\r\nof the place, with perpetual apprehensions of having to leave it: alarms,\r\nthrobbing suspicions, like those of old travellers through the haunted\r\nforest, where whispers have intensity of meaning, and unseeing we are\r\nseen, and unaware awaited.\r\n\r\nNataly shook the rolls of her thick brown hair from her forehead; she\r\ntook strength from a handsome look of resolution in the glass.  She could\r\nalways honestly say, that her courage would not fail him.\r\n\r\nVictor tapped at the door; he stepped into the room, wearing his evening\r\nwhite flower over a more open white waistcoat; and she was composed and\r\nuninquiring.  Their Nesta was heard on the descent of the stairs, with a\r\nrattle of Donizetti's Il segreto to the skylights.\r\n\r\nHe performed his never-omitted lover's homage.\r\n\r\nNataly enfolded him in a homely smile.  'A country-house?  We go and see\r\nit to-morrow?'\r\n\r\n'And you've been pining for a country home, my dear soul.'\r\n\r\n'After the summer six weeks, the house in London does not seem a home to\r\nreturn to.'\r\n\r\n'And next day, Nataly draws five thousand pounds for the first sketch of\r\nthe furniture.'\r\n\r\n'There is the Creckholt .  .  .' she had a difficulty in saying.\r\n\r\n'Part of it may do.  Lakelands requires--but you will see to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nAfter a close shutting of her eyes, she rejoined: 'It is not a cottage?'\r\n\r\n'Well, dear, no: when the Slave of the Lamp takes to building, he does\r\nnot run up cottages.  And we did it without magic, all in a year; which\r\nis quite as good as a magical trick in a night.'  He drew her close to\r\nhim.  'When was it my dear girl guessed me at work?'\r\n\r\n'It was the other dear girl.  Nesta is the guesser.'\r\n\r\n'You were two best of souls to keep from bothering me; and I might have\r\nhad to fib; and we neither of us like that.'  He noticed a sidling of her\r\nlook.  'More than the circumstances oblige:--to be frank.  But now we can\r\nspeak of them.  Wait--and the change comes; and opportunely, I have\r\nfound.  It's true we have waited long; my darling has had her worries.\r\nHowever, it 's here at last.  Prepare yourself.  I speak positively.\r\nYou have to brace up for one sharp twitch--the woman's portion!  as\r\nNatata says--and it's over.' He looked into her eyes for comprehension;\r\nand not finding inquiry, resumed: 'Just in time for the entry into\r\nLakelands.  With the pronouncement of the decree, we present the licence\r\n.  .  .  at an altar we've stood before, in spirit .  .  .  one of the\r\nladies of your family to support you:--why not?  Not even then?'\r\n\r\n'No, Victor; they have cast me off.'\r\n\r\n'Count on my cousins, the Duvidney ladies.  Then we can say, that those\r\ntwo good old spinsters are less narrow than the Dreightons.  I have to\r\nconfess I rather think I was to blame for leaving Creckholt.  Only,\r\nif I see my girl wounded, I hate the place that did the mischief.\r\nYou and Fredi will clap hands for the country about Lakelands.'\r\n\r\n'Have you heard from her .  .  .  of her .  .  .  is it anything,\r\nVictor?'  Nataly asked him shyly; with not much of hope, but some\r\nreadiness to be inflated.  The prospect of an entry into the big new\r\nhouse, among a new society, begirt by the old nightmares and fretting\r\ndevils, drew her into staring daylight or furnace-light.\r\n\r\nHe answered: 'Mrs. Burman has definitely decided.  In pity of us?--to be\r\nfree herself?--who can say!  She 's a woman with a conscience--of a kind:\r\nslow, but it brings her to the point at last.  You know her, know her\r\nwell.  Fenellan has it from her lawyer--her lawyer! a Mr. Carting;\r\na thoroughly trustworthy man--'\r\n\r\n'Fenellan, as a reporter?'\r\n\r\n'Thoroughly to be trusted on serious matters.  I understand that Mrs.\r\nBurman:--her health is awful: yes, yes; poor woman!  poor woman!  we feel\r\nfor her:--she has come to perceive her duty to those she leaves behind.\r\nConsider: she HAS used the rod.  She must be tired out--if human.  And\r\nshe is.  One remembers traits.'\r\n\r\nVictor sketched one or two of the traits allusively to the hearer\r\nacquainted with them.  They received strong colouring from midday's Old\r\nVeuve in his blood.  His voice and words had a swing of conviction: they\r\nimparted vinousness to a heart athirst.\r\n\r\nThe histrionic self-deceiver may be a persuasive deceiver of another,\r\nwho is again, though not ignorant of his character, tempted to swallow\r\nthe nostrums which have made so gallant a man of him: his imperceptible\r\nsensible playing of the part, on a substratum of sincereness, induces\r\nfascinatingly to the like performance on our side, that we may be armed\r\nas he is for enjoying the coveted reality through the partial simulation\r\nof possessing it.  And this is not a task to us when we have looked our\r\nactor in the face, and seen him bear the look, knowing that he is not\r\nintentionally untruthful; and when we incline to be captivated by his\r\nrare theatrical air of confidence; when it seems as an outside thought\r\nstriking us, that he may not be altogether deceived in the present\r\ninstance; when suddenly an expectation of the thing desired is born and\r\nswims in a credible featureless vagueness on a misty scene: and when we\r\nare being kissed and the blood is warmed.  In fine, here as everywhere\r\nalong our history, when the sensations are spirited up to drown the mind,\r\nwe become drift-matter of tides, metal to magnets.  And if we are women,\r\nwho commonly allow the lead to men, getting it for themselves only by\r\nsnaky cunning or desperate adventure, credulity--the continued trust in\r\nthe man--is the alternative of despair.\r\n\r\n'But, Victor, I must ask,' Nataly said: 'you have it through Simeon\r\nFenellan; you have not yourself received the letter from her lawyer?'\r\n\r\n'My knowledge of what she would do near the grave--poor soul, yes!  I\r\nshall soon be hearing.'\r\n\r\n'You do not, propose to enter this place until--until it is over?'\r\n\r\n'We enter this place, my love, without any sort of ceremony.  We live\r\nthere independently, and we can we have quarters there for our friends.\r\nOur one neighbour is London--there!  And at Lakelands we are able to\r\nentertain London and wife;--our friends, in short; with some, what we\r\nhave to call, satellites.  You inspect the house and grounds to-morrow\r\n--sure to be fair.  Put aside all but the pleasant recollections of Craye\r\nand Creckholt.  We start on a different footing.  Really nothing can be\r\nsimpler.  Keeping your town-house, you are now and then in residence at\r\nLakelands, where you entertain your set, teach them to feel the charm of\r\ncountry life: we have everything about us; could have had our own milk\r\nand cream up to London the last two months.  Was it very naughty?--\r\nI should have exploded my surprise!  You will see, you will see\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\nNataly nodded, as required.  'Good news from the mines?' she said.\r\n\r\nHe answered: 'Dartrey is--yes, poor fellow! Dartrey is confident, from\r\nthe yield of stones, that the value of our claim counts in a number of\r\nmillions.  The same with the gold.  But gold-mines are lodgeings, not\r\nhomes.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Victor!  if money .  .  .  !  But why did you say \"poor fellow\" of\r\nDartrey Fenellan?'\r\n\r\n'You know how he's .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' she said hastily.  'But has that woman been causing fresh\r\nanxiety?'\r\n\r\n'And Natata's chief hero on earth is not to be named a poor fellow,' said\r\nhe, after a negative of the head on a subject they neither of them liked\r\nto touch.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered that Dartrey Fenellan was actually a lucky fellow;\r\nand he would have mentioned the circumstance confided to him by Simeon,\r\nbut for a downright dread of renewing his painful fit of envy.  He had\r\nalso another, more distant, very faint idea, that it had better not be\r\nmentioned just yet, for a reason entirely undefined.\r\n\r\nHe consulted his watch.  The maid had come in for the robeing of her\r\nmistress.  Nataly's mind had turned to the little country cottage which\r\nwould have given her such great happiness.  She raised her eyes to him;\r\nshe could not check their filling; they were like a river carrying\r\nmoonlight on the smooth roll of a fall.\r\n\r\nHe loved the eyes, disliked the water in them.  With an impatient,\r\n'There, there!' and a smart affectionate look, he retired, thinking in\r\nour old satirical vein of the hopeless endeavour to satisfy a woman's\r\nmind without the intrusion of hard material statements, facts.  Even the\r\nbest of women, even the most beautiful, and in their moments of supremest\r\nbeauty, have this gross ravenousness for facts.  You must not expect to\r\nappease them unless you administer solids.  It would almost appear that\r\nman is exclusively imaginative and poetical; and that his mate, the fair,\r\nthe graceful, the bewitching, with the sweetest and purest of natures,\r\ncannot help being something of a groveller.\r\n\r\nNataly had likewise her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBETWEEN A GENERAL MAN OF THIN WORLD AND A PROFESSIONAL\r\n\r\nRather earlier in the afternoon of that day, Simeon Fenellan, thinking\r\nof the many things which are nothing, and so melancholy for lack of\r\namusements properly to follow Old Veuve, that he could ask himself\r\nwhether he had not done a deed of night, to be blinking at his fellow-men\r\nlike an owl all mad for the reveller's hoots and flights and mice and\r\nmoony roundels behind his hypocritical judex air of moping composure,\r\nchanced on Mr. Carling, the solicitor, where Lincoln's Inn pumps lawyers\r\ninto Fleet Street through the drain-pipe of Chancery Lane.  He was in the\r\nstate of the wine when a shake will rouse the sluggish sparkles to foam.\r\nSight of Mrs. Burman's legal adviser had instantly this effect upon him:\r\nhis bubbling friendliness for Victor Radnor, and the desire of the voice\r\nin his bosom for ears to hear, combined like the rush of two waves\r\ntogether, upon which he may be figured as the boat: he caught at Mr.\r\nCarling's hand more heartily than their acquaintanceship quite\r\nsanctioned; but his grasp and his look of overflowing were immediately\r\nprivileged; Mr. Carling, enjoying this anecdotal gentleman's conversation\r\nas he did, liked the warmth, and was flattered during the squeeze with a\r\nprospect of his wife and friends partaking of the fun from time to time.\r\n\r\n'I was telling my wife yesterday your story of the lady contrabandist: I\r\ndon't think she has done laughing since,' Mr. Calling said.\r\n\r\nFenellan fluted: 'Ah?' He had scent, in the eulogy of a story grown flat\r\nas Election hats, of a good sort of man in the way of men, a step or two\r\nbehind the man of the world.  He expressed profound regret at not having\r\nheard the silvery ring of the lady's laughter.\r\n\r\nCarling genially conceived a real gratification to be conferred on his\r\nwife.  'Perhaps you will some day honour us?'\r\n\r\n'You spread gold-leaf over the days to come, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Now, if I might name the day?'\r\n\r\n'You lump the gold and make it current coin;--says the blushing bride,\r\nwho ought not to have delivered herself so boldly, but she had forgotten\r\nher bashful part and spoilt the scene, though, luckily for the damsel,\r\nher swain was a lover of nature, and finding her at full charge, named\r\nthe very next day of the year, and held her to it, like the complimentary\r\ntyrant he was.'\r\n\r\n'To-morrow, then!' said Carling intrepidly, on a dash of enthusiasm,\r\nthrough a haggard thought of his wife and the cook and the netting of\r\nfriends at short notice.  He urged his eagerness to ask whether he might\r\nindeed have the satisfaction of naming to-morrow.\r\n\r\n'With happiness,' Fenellan responded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carling was therefore in for it.\r\n\r\n'To-morrow, half-past seven: as for company to meet you, we will do what\r\nwe can.  You go Westward?'\r\n\r\n'To bed with the sun,' said the reveller.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps by Covent Garden?  I must give orders there.'\r\n\r\n'Orders given in Covent Garden, paint a picture for bachelors of the\r\ndomestic Paradise an angel must help them to enter!  Ah, dear me!  Is\r\nthere anything on earth to compare with the pride of a virtuous life?'\r\n\r\n'I was married at four and twenty,' said Carling, as one taking up\r\nthe expository second verse of a poem; plain facts, but weighty and\r\nnecessary: 'my wife was in her twentieth year: we have five children; two\r\nsons, three daughters, one married, with a baby.  So we are grandfather\r\nand mother, and have never regretted the first step, I may say for both\r\nof us.'\r\n\r\n'Think of it!  Good luck and sagacity joined hands overhead on the day\r\nyou proposed to the lady: and I'd say, that all the credit is with her,\r\nbut that it would seem to be at the expense of her sex.'\r\n\r\n'She would be the last to wish it, I assure you.'\r\n\r\n'True of all good women!  You encourage me, touching a matter of deep\r\ninterest, not unknown to you.  The lady's warm heart will be with us.\r\nProbably she sees Mrs. Burman?'\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Burman Radnor receives no one.'\r\n\r\nA comic severity in the tone of the correction was deferentially accepted\r\nby Fenellan.\r\n\r\n'Pardon.  She flies her flag, with her captain wanting; and she has,\r\nqueerly, the right.  So, then, the worthy dame who receives no one, might\r\nbe treated, it struck us, conversationally, as a respectable harbour-\r\nhulk, with more history than top-honours.  But she has the indubitable\r\nlegal right to fly them--to proclaim it; for it means little else.'\r\n\r\n'You would have her, if I follow you, divest herself of the name?'\r\n\r\n'Pin me to no significations, if you please, O shrewdest of the legal\r\nsort!  I have wit enough to escape you there.  She is no doubt an\r\nestimable person.'\r\n\r\n'Well, she is; she is in her way a very good woman.'\r\n\r\n'Ah.  You see, Mr. Carling, I cannot bring myself to rank her beside\r\nanother lady, who has already claimed the title of me; and you will\r\nforgive me if I say, that your word \"good\" has a look of being stuck upon\r\nthe features we know of her, like a coquette's naughty patch; or it's\r\na jewel of an eye in an ebony idol: though I've heard tell she performs\r\nher charities.'\r\n\r\n'I believe she gives away three parts of her income and that is large.'\r\n\r\n'Leaving the good lady a fine fat fourth.'\r\n\r\n'Compare her with other wealthy people.'\r\n\r\n'And does she outshine the majority still with her personal attractions.\r\n\r\nCarling was instigated by the praise he had bestowed on his wife to\r\nseparate himself from a female pretender so ludicrous; he sought\r\nFenellan's nearest ear, emitting the sound of 'hum.'\r\n\r\n'In other respects, unimpeachable!'\r\n\r\n'Oh! quite!'\r\n\r\n'There was a fishfag of classic Billingsgate, who had broken her\r\nhusband's nose with a sledgehammer fist, and swore before the magistrate,\r\nthat the man hadn't a crease to complain of in her character.  We are\r\ncondemned, Mr. Carling, sometimes to suffer in the flesh for the\r\nassurance we receive of the inviolability of those moral fortifications.'\r\n\r\n'Character, yes, valuable--I do wish you had named to-night for doing me\r\nthe honour of dining with me!' said the lawyer impulsively, in a rapture\r\nof the appetite for anecdotes.  'I have a ripe Pichon Longueville, '65.'\r\n\r\n'A fine wine.  Seductive to hear of.  I dine with my friend Victor\r\nRadnor.  And he knows wine.--There are good women in the world, Mr.\r\nCarling, whose characters .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Of course,'of course there are; and I could name you some.\r\nWe lawyers . . . . !\r\n\r\n'You encounter all sorts.'\r\n\r\n'Between ourselves,' Carling sank his tones to the indiscriminate, where\r\nit mingled with the roar of London.\r\n\r\n'You do?' Fenellan hazarded a guess at having heard enlightened liberal\r\nopinions regarding the sex.  'Right!'\r\n\r\n'Many!'\r\n\r\n'I back you, Mr. Carling.'\r\n\r\nThe lawyer pushed to yet more confidential communication, up to the verge\r\nof the clearly audible: he spoke of examples, experiences.  Fenellan\r\nbacked him further.\r\n\r\n'Acting on behalf of clients, you understand, Mr. Fenellan.'\r\n\r\n'Professional, but charitable; I am with you.'\r\n\r\n'Poor things!  we--if we have to condemn--we owe them something.'\r\n\r\n'A kind word for poor Polly Venus, with all the world against her!  She\r\ndoesn't hear it often.'\r\n\r\n'A real service,' Carling's voice deepened to the legal 'without\r\nprejudice,'--'I am bound to say it--a service to Society.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, poor wench!  And the kind of reward she gets?'\r\n\r\n'We can hardly examine .  .  .  mysterious dispensations .  .  .  here we\r\nare to make the best we can of it.'\r\n\r\n'For the creature Society's indebted to?  True.  And am I to think\r\nthere's a body of legal gentlemen to join with you, my friend, in\r\nfounding an Institution to distribute funds to preach charity over the\r\ncountry, and win compassion for her, as one of the principal persons of\r\nher time, that Society's indebted to for whatever it's indebted for?'\r\n\r\n'Scarcely that,' said Carling, contracting.\r\n\r\n'But you 're for great Reforms?'\r\n\r\n'Gradual.'\r\n\r\n'Then it's for Reformatories, mayhap.'\r\n\r\n'They would hardly be a cure.'\r\n\r\n'You 're in search of a cure?'\r\n\r\n'It would be a blessed discovery.'\r\n\r\n'But what's to become of Society?'\r\n\r\n'It's a puzzle to the cleverest.'\r\n\r\n'All through History, my dear Mr. Carling, we see that.\r\n\r\n'Establishments must have their sacrifices.  Beware of interfering: eh?'\r\n\r\n'By degrees, we may hope . . . .'\r\n\r\n'Society prudently shuns the topic; and so 'll we.  For we might tell of\r\none another, in a fit of distraction, that t' other one talked of it, and\r\nwe should be banished for an offence against propriety.  You should read\r\nmy friend Durance's Essay on Society.  Lawyers are a buttress of Society.\r\nBut, come: I wager they don't know what they support until they read that\r\nEssay.'\r\n\r\nCarling had a pleasant sense of escape, in not being personally asked to\r\nread the Essay, and not hearing that a copy of it should be forwarded to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe said: 'Mr. Radnor is a very old friend?'\r\n\r\n'Our fathers were friends; they served in the same regiment for years.\r\nI was in India when Victor Radnor took the fatal!'\r\n\r\n'Followed by a second, not less .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'In the interpretation of a rigid morality arming you legal gentlemen to\r\nmake it so!'\r\n\r\n'The Law must be vindicated.'\r\n\r\n'The law is a clumsy bludgeon.'\r\n\r\n'We think it the highest effort of human reason--the practical\r\ninstrument.'\r\n\r\n'You may compare it to a rustic's finger on a fiddlestring, for the\r\nmurdered notes you get out of the practical instrument.\r\n\r\n'I am bound to defend it, clumsy bludgeon or not.'\r\n\r\n'You are one of the giants to wield it, and feel humanly, when, by\r\nchance, down it comes on the foot an inch off the line.--Here's a peep\r\nof Old London; if the habit of old was not to wash windows.  I like these\r\nold streets!'\r\n\r\n'Hum,' Carling hesitated.  'I can remember when the dirt at the windows\r\nwas appalling.'\r\n\r\n'Appealing to the same kind of stuff in the passing youngster's green-\r\nscum eye: it was.  And there your Law did good work.--You're for\r\nBordeaux.  What is your word on Burgundy?'\r\n\r\n'Our Falernian!'\r\n\r\n'Victor Radnor has the oldest in the kingdom.  But he will have the best\r\nof everything.  A Romanee!  A Musigny!  Sip, my friend, you embrace the\r\nGoddess of your choice above.  You are up beside her at a sniff of that\r\nwine.--And lo, venerable Drury! we duck through the court, reminded a bit\r\nby our feelings of our first love, who hadn't the cleanest of faces or\r\nnicest of manners, but she takes her station in memory because we were\r\nboys then, and the golden halo of youth is upon her.'\r\n\r\nCarling, as a man of the world, acquiesced in souvenirs he did not share.\r\nHe said urgently: 'Understand me; you speak of Mr. Radnor; pray, believe\r\nI have the greatest respect for Mr. Radnor's abilities.  He is one of our\r\nforemost men .  .  .  proud of him.  Mr. Radnor has genius; I have\r\nwatched him; it is genius; he shows it in all he does; one of the\r\nmemorable men of our times.  I can admire him, independent of--well,\r\nmisfortune of that kind .  .  .  a mistaken early step.  Misfortune,\r\nit is to be named.  Between ourselves--we are men of the world--if one\r\ncould see the way!  She occasionally .  .  .  as I have told you.  I have\r\nventured suggestions.  As I have mentioned, I have received an impression\r\n.  .  .'\r\n\r\n'But still, Mr. Carling, if the lady doesn't release him and will keep\r\nhis name, she might stop her cowardly persecutions.'\r\n\r\n'Can you trace them?'\r\n\r\n'Undisguised!'\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Burman Radnor is devout.  I should not exactly say revengeful.\r\nWe have to discriminate.  I gather, that her animus is, in all honesty,\r\ndirected at the--I quote--state of sin.  We are mixed, you know.'\r\n\r\nThe Winegod in the blood of Fenellan gave a leap.  'But, fifty thousand\r\ntimes more mixed, she might any moment stop the state of sin, as she\r\ncalls it, if it pleased her.'\r\n\r\n'She might try.  Our Judges look suspiciously on long delayed actions.\r\nAnd there are, too, women who regard the marriage-tie as indissoluble.\r\nShe has had to combat that scruple.'\r\n\r\n'Believer in the renewing of the engagement overhead!--well.  But put a\r\nby-word to Mother Nature about the state of sin.  Where, do you imagine,\r\nshe would lay it?  You'll say, that Nature and Law never agreed.  They\r\nought.'\r\n\r\n'The latter deferring to the former?'\r\n\r\n'Moulding itself on her swelling proportions.  My dear dear sir, the\r\nstate of sin was the continuing to live in defiance of, in contempt of,\r\nin violation of, in the total degradation of, Nature.'\r\n\r\n'He was under no enforcement to take the oath at the altar.'\r\n\r\n'He was a small boy tempted by a varnished widow, with pounds of barley\r\nsugar in her pockets;--and she already serving as a test-vessel or mortar\r\nfor awful combinations in druggery!  Gilt widows are equal to decrees of\r\nFate to us young ones.  Upon my word, the cleric who unites, and the Law\r\nthat sanctions, they're the criminals.  Victor Radnor is the noblest of\r\nfellows, the very best friend a man can have.  I will tell you: he saved\r\nme, after I left the army, from living on the produce of my pen--which\r\nmeans, if there is to be any produce, the prostrating of yourself to the\r\nlevel of the round middle of the public: saved me from that!  Yes, Mr.\r\nCarling, I have trotted our thoroughfares a poor Polly of the pen; and it\r\nis owing to Victor Radnor that I can order my thoughts as an individual\r\nman again before I blacken paper.  Owing to him, I have a tenderness for\r\nmercenaries; having been one of them and knowing how little we can help\r\nit.  He is an Olympian--who thinks of them below.  The lady also is an\r\nadmirable woman at all points.  The pair are a mated couple, such as you\r\nwon't find in ten households over Christendom.  Are you aware of the\r\nstory?'\r\n\r\nCarling replied: 'A story under shadow of the Law, has generally two very\r\ndistinct versions.'\r\n\r\n'Hear mine.--And, by Jove!  a runaway cab.  No, all right.  But a crazy\r\ncab it is, and fit to do mischief in narrow Drury.  Except that it's\r\nsheer riff-raff here to knock over.'\r\n\r\n'Hulloa?--come!' quoth the wary lawyer.\r\n\r\n'There's the heart I wanted to rouse to hear me!  One may be sure that\r\nthe man for old Burgundy has it big and sound, in spite of his legal\r\npractices; a dear good spherical fellow!  Some day, we'll hope, you will\r\nbe sitting with us over a magnum of Victor Radnor's Romance Conti aged\r\nthirty-one: a wine, you'll say at the second glass, High Priest for the\r\ncelebration of the uncommon nuptials between the body and the soul of\r\nman.'\r\n\r\n'You hit me rightly,'said Carting, tickled and touched; sensually excited\r\nby the bouquet of Victor Radnor's hospitality and companionship, which\r\nadded flavour to Fenellan's compliments.  These came home to him through\r\nhis desire to be the 'good spherical fellow'; for he, like modern\r\ndiplomatists in the track of their eminent Berlinese New Type of the\r\ntime, put on frankness as an armour over wariness, holding craft in\r\nreserve: his aim was at the refreshment of honest fellowship: by no means\r\nto discover that the coupling of his native bias with his professional\r\nduty was unprofitable nowadays.  Wariness, however, was not somnolent,\r\neven when he said: 'You know, I am never the lawyer out of my office.\r\nMan of the world to men of the world; and I have not lost by it. I am\r\nMrs. Barman Radnor's legal adviser: you are Mr. Victor Radnor's friend.\r\nThey are, as we see them, not on the best of terms.  I would rather--at\r\nits lowest, as a matter of business--be known for having helped them to\r\nsome kind of footing than send in a round bill to my client--or another.\r\nI gain more in the end.  Frankly, I mean to prove, that it's a lawyer's\r\ninterest to be human.'\r\n\r\n'Because, now, see!' said Fenellan, 'here's the case.  Miss Natalia\r\nDreighton, of a good Yorkshire family--a large one, reads an\r\nadvertisement for the post of companion to a lady, and answers it,\r\nand engages herself, previous to the appearance of the young husband.\r\nMiss Dreighton is one of the finest young women alive.  She has a\r\nglorious contralto voice.  Victor and she are encouraged by Mrs. Barman\r\nto sing duets together.  Well?\r\n\r\nWhy, Euclid would have theorem'd it out for you at a glance at the trio.\r\nYou have only to look on them, you chatter out your three Acts of a Drama\r\nwithout a stop.  If Mrs. Barman cares to practise charity, she has only\r\nto hold in her Fury-forked tongue, or her Jarniman I think 's the name.'\r\n\r\nCarting shrugged.\r\n\r\n'Let her keep from striking, if she's Christian,' pursued Fenetlan, 'and\r\nif kind let her resume the name of her first lord, who did a better thing\r\nfor himself than for her, when he shook off his bars of bullion, to rise\r\nthe lighter, and left a wretched female soul below, with the devil's own\r\ntestimony to her attractions--thousands in the Funds, houses in the City.\r\nShe threw the young couple together.  And my friend Victor Radnor is of a\r\nparticularly inflammable nature.  Imagine one of us in such a situation,\r\nMr. Carting!'\r\n\r\n'Trying!' said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n'The dear fellow was as nigh death as a man can be and know the sweetness\r\nof a woman's call to him to live.  And here's London's garden of pines,\r\nbananas, oranges; all the droppings of the Hesperides here!  We don't\r\nreflect on it, Mr. Carling.'\r\n\r\n'Not enough, not enough.'\r\n\r\n'I feel such a spout of platitudes that I could out With a Leading\r\nArticle on a sheet of paper on your back while you're bending over the\r\nbaskets.  I seem to have got circularly round again to Eden when I enter\r\na garden.  Only, here we have to pay for the fruits we pluck.  Well, and\r\njust the same there; and no end to the payment either.  We're always\r\npaying!  By the way, Mrs. Victor Radnor's dinner-table's a spectacle.\r\nHer taste in flowers equals her lord's in wine.  But age improves the\r\nwine and spoils the flowers, you'll say.  Maybe you're for arguing that\r\nlovely women show us more of the flower than the grape, in relation to\r\nthe course of time.  I pray you not to forget the terrible intoxicant\r\nshe is.  We reconcile it, Mr. Carling, with the notion that the grape's\r\nher spirit, the flower her body.  Or is it the reverse?  Perhaps an\r\nintertwining.  But look upon bouquets and clusters, and the idea of\r\nwoman springs up at once, proving she's composed of them.  I was about\r\nto remark, that with deference to the influence of Mrs. Burman's legal\r\nadviser, an impenitent or penitent sinner's pastor, the Reverend\r\ngentleman ministering to her spiritual needs, would presumptively\r\nexercise it, in this instance, in a superior degree.'\r\n\r\nCarling murmured: 'The Rev. Groseman Buttermore'; and did so for\r\nsomething of a cover, to continue a run of internal reflections: as, that\r\nhe was assuredly listening to vinous talk in the streets by day; which\r\nimpression placed him on a decorous platform above the amusing gentleman;\r\nto whom, however, he grew cordial, in recognizing consequently, that his\r\nexuberant flow could hardly be a mask; and that an indication here and\r\nthere of a trap in his talk, must have been due rather to excess of\r\nwariness, habitual in the mind of a long-headed man, whose incorrigibly\r\nimpulsive fits had necessarily to be rectified by a vigilant dexterity.\r\n\r\n'Buttermore!' ejaculated Fenellan: 'Groseman Buttermore!  Mrs. Victor's\r\nFather Confessor is the Rev. Septimus Barmby.  Groseman Buttermore--\r\nSeptimus Barmby.  Is there anything in names?  Truly, unless these\r\nclerical gentlemen take them up at the crossing of the roads long\r\nafter birth, the names would appear the active parts of them, and\r\nthemselves mere marching supports, like the bearers of street placard-\r\nadvertisements.  Now, I know a Septimus Barmby, and you a Groseman\r\nButtermore, and beyond the fact that Reverend starts up before their\r\nnames without mention, I wager it's about all we do know of them.\r\nThey're Society's trusty rock-limpets, no doubt.'\r\n\r\n'My respect for the cloth is extreme.' Carling's short cough prepared the\r\nway for deductions.  'Between ourselves, they are men of the world.'\r\n\r\nFenellan eyed benevolently the worthy attorney, whose innermost imp burst\r\nout periodically, like a Dutch clocksentry, to trot on his own small\r\ngrounds for thinking himself of the community of the man of the world.\r\n'You lawyers dress in another closet,' he said.  'The Rev. Groseman has\r\nthe ear of the lady?'\r\n\r\n'He has:--one ear.'\r\n\r\n'Ah?  She has the other open for a man of the world, perhaps.'\r\n\r\n'Listens to him, listens to me, listens to Jarniman; and we neither of\r\nus guide her.  She's very curious--a study.  You think you know her--next\r\nday she has eluded you.  She's emotional, she's hard; she's a woman,\r\nshe's a stone.  Anything you like; but don't count on her.  And another\r\nthing--I'm bound to say it of myself,' Carling claimed close hearing of\r\nFenellan over a shelf of saladstuff, 'no one who comes near her has any\r\nreal weight with her in this matter.'\r\n\r\n'Probably you mix cream in your salad of the vinegar and oil,' said\r\nFenellan.  'Try jelly of mutton.'--'You give me a new idea.  Latterly,\r\nfond as I am of salads, I've had rueful qualms.  We'll try it.'\r\n\r\n'You should dine with Victor Radnor.'\r\n\r\n'French cook, of course!'\r\n\r\n'Cordon bleu.'\r\n\r\n'I like to be sure of my cutlet.'\r\n\r\n'I like to be sure of a tastiness in my vegetables.'\r\n\r\n'And good sauces!'\r\n\r\n'And pretty pastry.  I said, Cordon bleu.  The miracle is, it 's a woman\r\nthat Victor Radnor has trained: French, but a woman; devoted to him, as\r\nall who serve him are.  Do I say \"but\" a woman?  There's not a Frenchman\r\nalive to match her.  Vatel awaits her in Paradise with his arms extended;\r\nand may he wait long!'\r\n\r\nCarling indulged his passion for the genuine by letting a flutter of real\r\nenvy be seen.  'My wife would like to meet such a Frenchwoman.  It must\r\nbe a privilege to dine with him--to know him.  I know what he has done\r\nfor English Commerce, and to build a colossal fortune: genius, as I said:\r\nand his donations to Institutions.  Odd, to read his name and Mrs. Burman\r\nRadnor's at separate places in the lists!  Well, we'll hope.  It's a case\r\nfor a compromise of sentiments and claims.'\r\n\r\n'A friend of mine, spiced with cynic, declares that there's always an\r\namicable way out of a dissension, if we get rid of Lupus and Vulpus.'\r\n\r\nCarling spied for a trap in the citation of Lupus and Vulpus; he saw\r\nnone, and named the square of his residence on the great Russell\r\nproperty, and the number of the house, the hour of dinner next day.\r\nHe then hung silent, breaking the pause with his hand out and a sharp\r\n'Well?' that rattled a whirligig sound in his head upward.  His leave of\r\npeople was taken in this laughing falsetto, as of one affected by the\r\ncurious end things come to.\r\n\r\nFenellan thought of him for a moment or two, that he was a better than\r\nthe common kind of lawyer; who doubtless knew as much of the wrong side\r\nof the world as lawyers do, and held his knowledge for the being a man of\r\nthe world:--as all do, that have not Alpine heights in the mind to mount\r\nfor a look out over their own and the world's pedestrian tracks.  I could\r\nspot the lawyer in your composition, my friend, to the exclusion of the\r\nman he mused.  But you're right in what you mean to say of yourself:\r\nyou're a good fellow, for a lawyer, and together we may manage somehow\r\nto score a point of service to Victor Radnor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOME FAMILIAR GUESTS\r\n\r\nNesta read her mother's face when Mrs. Victor entered the drawing-room to\r\nreceive the guests.  She saw a smooth fair surface, of the kind as much\r\nrequired by her father's eyes as innocuous air by his nostrils: and it\r\nwas honest skin, not the deceptive feminine veiling, to make a dear man\r\nhappy over his volcano.  Mrs. Victor was to meet the friends with whom\r\nher feelings were at home, among whom her musical gifts gave her station:\r\nthey liked her for herself; they helped her to feel at home with herself\r\nand be herself: a rarer condition with us all than is generally supposed.\r\nSo she could determine to be cheerful in the anticipation of an evening\r\nthat would at least be restful to the outworn sentinel nerve of her\r\nheart, which was perpetually alert and signalling to the great organ;\r\noften colouring the shows and seems of adverse things for an apeing of\r\nreality with too cruel a resemblance.  One of the scraps of practical\r\nwisdom gained by hardened sufferers is, to keep from spying at horizons\r\nwhen they drop into a pleasant dingle.  Such is the comfort of it, that\r\nwe can dream, and lull our fears, and half think what we wish: and it is\r\na heavenly truce with the fretful mind divided from our wishes.\r\n\r\nNesta wondered at her mother's complacent questions concerning this\r\nLakelands: the house, the county, the kind of people about, the features\r\nof the country.  Physically unable herself to be regretful under a burden\r\nthree parts enrapturing her, the girl expected her mother to display a\r\nshadowy vexation, with a proud word or two, that would summon her\r\nthrilling sympathy in regard to the fourth part: namely, the aristocratic\r\niciness of country magnates, who took them up and cast them off; as they\r\nhad done, she thought, at Craye Farm and at Creckholt: she remembered it,\r\nof the latter place, wincingly, insurgently, having loved the dear home\r\nshe had been expelled from by her pride of the frosty surrounding people\r\n--or no, not all, but some of them.  And what had roused their pride?\r\n\r\nStriking for a reason, her inexperience of our modern England,\r\nsupplemented by readings in the England of a preceding generation,\r\nhad hit on her father's profession of merchant.  It accounted to her\r\nfor the behaviour of the haughty territorial and titled families.  But\r\ncertain of the minor titles headed City Firms, she had heard; certain of\r\nthe families were avowedly commercial.  'They follow suit,' her father\r\nsaid at Creckholt, after he had found her mother weeping, and decided\r\ninstantly to quit and fly once more.  But if they followed suit in such\r\na way, then Mr. Durance must be right when he called the social English\r\nthe most sheepy of sheep:--and Nesta could not consent to the cruel\r\nverdict, she adored her compatriots.  Incongruities were pacified for\r\nher by the suggestion of her quick wits, that her father, besides being\r\na merchant, was a successful speculator; and perhaps the speculator is\r\nnot liked by merchants; or they were jealous of him; or they did not like\r\nhis being both.\r\n\r\nShe pardoned them with some tenderness, on a suspicion that a quaint old\r\nhigh-frilled bleached and puckered Puritanical rectitude (her thoughts\r\nrose in pictures) possibly condemned the speculator as a description of\r\ngambler.  An erratic severity in ethics is easily overlooked by the\r\nenthusiast for things old English.  She was consciously ahead of them\r\nin the knowledge that her father had been, without the taint of gambling,\r\na beneficent speculator.  The Montgomery colony in South Africa, and his\r\ndealings with the natives in India, and his Railways in South America,\r\nhis establishment of Insurance Offices, which were Savings Banks, and the\r\nStores for the dispensing of sound goods to the poor, attested it.  O and\r\nhe was hospitable, the kindest, helpfullest of friends, the dearest, the\r\nvery brightest of parents: he was his girl's playmate.  She could be\r\ncritic of him, for an induction to the loving of him more justly: yet if\r\nhe had an excessive desire to win the esteem of people, as these keen\r\nyoung optics perceived in him, he strove to deserve it; and no one could\r\naccuse him of laying stress on the benefits he conferred.  Designedly,\r\nfrigidly to wound a man so benevolent, appeared to her as an\r\nincomprehensible baseness.  The dropping of acquaintanceship with him,\r\nafter the taste of its privileges, she ascribed, in the void of any\r\nbetter elucidation, to a mania of aristocratic conceit.  It drove her,\r\ndespite her youthful contempt of politics, into a Radicalism that could\r\nfind food in the epigrams of Mr. Colney Durance, even when they passed\r\nher understanding; or when he was not too distinctly seen by her to be\r\nshooting at all the parties of her beloved England, beneath the wicked\r\nsemblance of shielding each by turns.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman introduced to the Radnor Concert-parties by Lady\r\nGrace Halley as the Hon. Dudley Sowerby, had to bear the sins of his\r\nclass.  Though he was tall, straight-featured, correct in costume,\r\nappearance, deportment, second son of a religious earl and no scandal to\r\nthe parentage, he was less noticed by Nesta than the elderly and the\r\ncommoners.  Her father accused her of snubbing him.  She reproduced her\r\nfamous copy of the sugared acid of Mr. Dudley Sowerby's closed mouth:\r\na sort of sneer in meekness, as of humility under legitimate compulsion;\r\ndeploring Christianly a pride of race that stamped it for this cowled\r\nexhibition: the wonderful mimicry was a flash thrown out by a born\r\nmistress of the art, and her mother was constrained to laugh, and so was\r\nher father; but he wilfully denied the likeness.  He charged her with\r\nencouraging Colney Durance to drag forth the sprig of nobility, in the\r\nnakedness of evicted shell-fish, on themes of the peril to England,\r\npossibly ruin, through the loss of that ruling initiative formerly\r\npossessed, in the days of our glory, by the titular nobles of the land.\r\nColney spoke it effectively, and the Hon.  Dudley's expressive lineaments\r\nshowed print of the heaving word Alas, as when a target is penetrated,\r\ncentrally.  And he was not a particularly dull fellow 'for his class and\r\ncountry,' Colney admitted; adding: 'I hit his thought and out he came.'\r\nOne has, reluctantly with Victor Radnor, to grant, that when a man's\r\ntopmost unspoken thought is hit, he must be sharp on his guard to keep\r\nfrom coming out:--we have won a right to him.\r\n\r\n'Only, it's too bad; it 's a breach of hospitality,' Victor said, both\r\nto Nesta and to Nataly, alluding to several instances of Colney's ironic\r\nhandling of their guests, especially of this one, whom Nesta would\r\nattack, and Nataly would not defend.\r\n\r\nThey were alive at a signal to protect the others.  Miss Priscilla\r\nGraves, an eater of meat, was ridiculous in her ant'alcoholic\r\nexclusiveness and scorn: Mr. Pempton, a drinker of wine, would laud\r\nextravagantly the more transparent purity of vegetarianism.  Dr. Peter\r\nYatt jeered at globules: Dr. John Cormyn mourned over human creatures\r\ntreated as cattle by big doses.  The Rev. Septimus Barmby satisfactorily\r\nsmoked: Mr. Peridon traced mortal evil to that act.  Dr. Schlesien had\r\nhis German views, Colney Durance his ironic, Fenellan his fanciful and\r\nfree-lance.  And here was an optimist, there a pessimist; and the rank\r\nRadical, the rigid Conservative, were not wanting.  All of them were\r\npointedly opposed, extraordinarily for so small an assembly: absurdly,\r\nit might be thought: but these provoked a kind warm smile, with the\r\nexclamation: 'They are dears!'  They were the dearer for their fads\r\nand foibles.\r\n\r\nMusic harmonized them.  Music, strangely, put the spell on Colney\r\nDurance, the sayer of bitter things, manufacturer of prickly balls,\r\nin the form of Discord's apples of whom Fenellan remarked, that he took\r\nto his music like an angry little boy to his barley-sugar, with a growl\r\nand a grunt.  All these diverse friends could meet and mix in Victor's\r\nConcert-room with an easy homely recognition of one another's musical\r\nqualities, at times enthusiastic; and their natural divergencies and\r\noccasional clashes added a salient tastiness to the group of whom Nesta\r\ncould say: 'Mama, was there ever such a collection of dear good souls\r\nwith such contrary minds?'  Her mother had the deepest of reasons for\r\nloving them, so as not to wish to see the slightest change in their\r\nminds, that the accustomed features making her nest of homeliness and\r\nreal peace might be retained, with the humour of their funny silly\r\nantagonisms and the subsequent march in concord; excepting solely as\r\nregarded the perverseness of Priscilla Graves in her open contempt of Mr.\r\nPempton's innocent two or three wine-glasses.  The vegetarian gentleman's\r\npoliteness forbore to direct attention to the gobbets of meat Priscilla\r\nconsumed, though he could express disapproval in general terms; but he\r\nentertained sentiments as warlike to the lady's habit of 'drinking the\r\nblood of animals.'  The mockery of it was, that Priscilla liked Mr.\r\nPempton and admired his violoncello-playing, and he was unreserved in\r\neulogy of her person and her pure soprano tones.  Nataly was a poetic\r\nmatch-maker.  Mr. Peridon was intended for Mademoiselle de Seilles,\r\nNesta's young French governess; a lady of a courtly bearing, with placid\r\nspeculation in the eyes she cast on a foreign people, and a voluble\r\nmuteness shadowing at intervals along the line of her closed lips.\r\n\r\nThe one person among them a little out of tune with most, was Lady Grace\r\nHalley.  Nataly's provincial gentlewoman's traditions of the manners\r\nindicating conduct, reproved unwonted licences assumed by Lady Grace;\r\nwho, in allusion to Hymen's weaving of a cousinship between the earldom\r\nof Southweare and that of Cantor, of which Mr. Sowerby sprang, set her\r\nmouth and fan at work to delineate total distinctions, as it were from\r\nthe egg to the empyrean.  Her stature was rather short, all of it\r\nconversational, at the eyebrows, the shoulders, the finger-tips, the\r\ntwisting shape; a ballerina's expressiveness; and her tongue dashed half\r\nsentences through and among these hieroglyphs, loosely and funnily\r\ncandid.  Anybody might hear that she had gone gambling into the City,\r\nand that she had got herself into a mess, and that by great good luck\r\nshe had come across Victor Radnor, who, with two turns of the wrist,\r\nhad plucked her out of the mire, the miraculous man!  And she had vowed\r\nto him, never again to run doing the like without his approval.\r\n\r\nThe cause of her having done it, was related with the accompaniments;\r\nbrows twitching, flitting smiles, shrugs, pouts, shifts of posture: she\r\nwas married to a centaur; out of the saddle a man of wood, 'an excellent\r\nman.'  For the not colloquial do not commit themselves.  But one wants a\r\nlittle animation in a husband.  She called on bell-motion of the head to\r\ntoll forth the utter nightcap negative.  He had not any: out of the\r\nsaddle, he was asleep:--'next door to the Last Trump,' Colney Durance\r\nassisted her to describe the soundest of sleep in a husband, after wooing\r\nher to unbosom herself.  She was awake to his guileful arts, and sailed\r\nalong with him, hailing his phrases, if he shot a good one; prankishly\r\nexposing a flexible nature, that took its holiday thus in a grinding\r\nworld, among maskers, to the horrification of the prim.  So to refresh\r\nourselves, by having publicly a hip-bath in the truth while we shock our\r\nhearers enough to be discredited for what we reveal, was a dexterous\r\nmerry twist, amusing to her; but it was less a cynical malice than her\r\nnature that she indulged, 'A woman must have some excitement.'  The most\r\ninnocent appeared to her the Stock Exchange.  The opinions of husbands\r\nwho are not summoned to pay are hardly important; they vary.\r\n\r\nColney helped her now and then to step the trifle beyond her stride,\r\nbut if he was humorous, she forgave; and if together they appalled the\r\ndecorous, it was great gain.  Her supple person, pretty lips, the style\r\nshe had, gave a pass to the wondrous confidings, which were for masculine\r\nears, whatever the sex.  Nataly might share in them, but women did not\r\nlead her to expansiveness; or not the women of the contracted class:\r\nMiss Graves, Mrs. Cormyn, and others at the Radnor Concerts.  She had a\r\nspecial consideration for Mademoiselle de Seilles, owing to her exquisite\r\nFrench, as she said; and she may have liked it, but it was the young\r\nFrenchwoman's air of high breeding that won her esteem.  Girls were\r\nspring frosts to her.  Fronting Nesta, she put on her noted smile, or\r\nwood-cut of a smile, with its label of indulgence; except when the girl\r\nsang.  Music she loved.  She said it was the saving of poor Dudley.  It\r\ndistinguished him in the group of the noble Evangelical Cantor Family;\r\nand it gave him a subject of assured discourse in company; and oddly, it\r\ncontributed to his comelier air.  Flute [This would be the German\r\nBlockeflute or our Recorder.  D.W.] in hand, his mouth at the blow-stop\r\nwas relieved of its pained updraw by the form for puffing; he preserved a\r\ngentlemanly high figure in his exercises on the instrument, out of ken of\r\nall likeness to the urgent insistency of Victor Radnor's punctuating\r\ntrunk of the puffing frame at almost every bar--an Apollo brilliancy in\r\nenergetic pursuit of the nymph of sweet sound.  Too methodical one, too\r\nfiery the other.\r\n\r\nIn duets of Hauptmann's, with Nesta at the piano, the contrast of dull\r\nsmoothness and overstressed significance was very noticeable beside the\r\nfervent accuracy of her balanced fingering; and as she could also flute,\r\nshe could criticize; though latterly, the flute was boxed away from lips\r\nthat had devoted themselves wholly to song: song being one of the\r\ndamsel's present pressing ambitions.  She found nothing to correct in Mr.\r\nSowerby, and her father was open to all the censures; but her father\r\ncould plead vitality, passion.  He held his performances cheap after the\r\nvehement display; he was a happy listener, whether to the babble of his\r\n'dear old Corelli,' or to the majesty of the rattling heavens and swaying\r\nforests of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nHis air of listening was a thing to see; it had a look of disembodiment;\r\nthe sparkle conjured up from deeps, and the life in the sparkle, as of a\r\nsoul at holiday.  Eyes had been given this man to spy the pleasures and\r\nreveal the joy of his pasture on them: gateways to the sunny within,\r\nissues to all the outer Edens.  Few of us possess that double\r\nsignificance of the pure sparkle.  It captivated Lady Grace.  She said\r\na word of it to Fenellan: 'There is a man who can feel rapture!'  He had\r\nnot to follow the line of her sight: she said so on a previous evening,\r\nin a similar tone; and for a woman to repeat herself, using the very\r\nemphasis, was quaint.  She could feel rapture; but her features and limbs\r\nwere in motion to designate it, between simply and wilfully; she had the\r\ninstinct to be dimpling, and would not for a moment control it, and\r\ndelighted in its effectiveness: only when observing that winged sparkle\r\nof eyes did an idea of envy, hardly a consciousness, inform her of being\r\nsurpassed; and it might be in the capacity to feel besides the gift to\r\nexpress.  Such a reflection relating to a man, will make women mortally\r\nsensible that they are the feminine of him.\r\n\r\n'His girl has the look,' Fenellan said in answer.\r\n\r\nShe cast a glance at Nesta, then at Nataly.\r\n\r\nAnd it was true, that the figure of a mother, not pretending to the\r\nfather's vividness, eclipsed it somewhat in their child.  The mother gave\r\nrichness of tones, hues and voice, and stature likewise, and the thick\r\nbrown locks, which in her own were threads of gold along the brush from\r\nthe temples: she gave the girl a certain degree of the composure of\r\nmanner which Victor could not have bestowed; she gave nothing to clash\r\nwith his genial temper; she might be supposed to have given various\r\nqualities, moral if you like.  But vividness was Lady Grace's admirable\r\nmeteor of the hour: she was unable to perceive, so as to compute, the\r\nvalue of obscurer lights.  Under the charm of Nataly's rich contralto\r\nduring a duet with Priscilla Graves, she gesticulated ecstasies, and\r\nuttered them, and genuinely; and still, when reduced to meditations,\r\nthey would have had no weight, they would hardly have seemed an apology\r\nfor language, beside Victor's gaze of pleasure in the noble forthroll of\r\nthe notes.\r\n\r\nNataly heard the invitation of the guests of the evening to Lakelands\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nHer anxieties were at once running about to gather provisions for the\r\nbaskets.  She spoke of them at night.  But Victor had already put the\r\nmatter in the hands of Madame Callet; and all that could be done, would\r\nbe done by Armandine, he knew.  'If she can't muster enough at home,\r\nshe'll be off to her Piccadilly shop by seven A.M. Count on plenty for\r\ntwice the number.'\r\n\r\nNataly was reposing on the thought that they were her friends, when\r\nVictor mentioned his having in the afternoon despatched a note to his\r\nrelatives, the Duvidney ladies, inviting them to join him at the station\r\nto-morrow, for a visit of inspection to the house of his building on his\r\nnew estate.  He startled her.  The Duvidney ladies were, to his\r\nknowledge, of the order of the fragile minds which hold together by\r\nthe cement of a common trepidation for the support of things established,\r\nand have it not in them to be able to recognize the unsanctioned.  Good\r\nwomen, unworldly of the world, they were perforce harder than the world,\r\nfrom being narrower and more timorous.\r\n\r\n'But, Victor, you were sure they would refuse!'\r\n\r\nHe answered: 'They may have gone back to Tunbridge Wells.  By the way,\r\nthey have a society down there I want for Fredi.  Sure, do you say, my\r\ndear?  Perfectly sure.  But the accumulation of invitations and refusals\r\nin the end softens them, you will see.  We shall and must have them for\r\nFredi.'\r\n\r\nShe was used to the long reaches of his forecasts, his burning activity\r\non a project; she found it idle to speak her thought, that his ingenuity\r\nwould have been needless in a position dictated by plain prudence, and so\r\nmuch happier for them.\r\n\r\nThey talked of Mrs. Burman until she had to lift a prayer to be saved\r\nfrom darker thoughts, dreadfully prolific, not to be faced.  Part of her\r\nprayer was on behalf of Mrs. Burman, for life to be extended to her, if\r\nthe poor lady clung to life--if it was really humane to wish it for her:\r\nand heaven would know: heaven had mercy on the afflicted.\r\n\r\nNataly heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer.  She had to cease to\r\npray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAN INSPECTION OF LAKELANDS\r\n\r\nOne may not have an intention to flourish, and may be pardoned for a\r\nsemblance of it, in exclaiming, somewhat royally, as creator and owner\r\nof the place: 'There you see Lakelands.'\r\n\r\nThe conveyances from the railway station drew up on a rise of road\r\nfronting an undulation, where our modern English architect's fantasia\r\nin crimson brick swept from central gables to flying wings, over pents,\r\ncrooks, curves, peaks, cowled porches, balconies, recesses, projections,\r\naway to a red village of stables and dependent cottages; harmonious in\r\nirregularity; and coloured homely with the greensward about it, the pines\r\nbeside it, the clouds above it.  Not many palaces would be reckoned as\r\nlarger.  The folds and swells and stream of the building along the roll\r\nof ground, had an appearance of an enormous banner on the wind.  Nataly\r\nlooked.  Her next look was at Colney Durance.  She sent the expected nods\r\nto Victor's carriage.  She would have given the whole prospect for the\r\ncovering solitariness of her chamber.  A multitude of clashing\r\nsensations, and a throat-thickening hateful to her, compelled her to\r\nsummon so as to force herself to feel a groundless anger, directed\r\nagainst none, against nothing, perfectly crazy, but her only resource\r\nfor keeping down the great wave surgent at her eyes.\r\n\r\nVictor was like a swimmer in morning sea amid the exclamations encircling\r\nhim.  He led through the straight passage of the galleried hall, offering\r\ntwo fair landscapes at front door and at back, down to the lake, Fredi's\r\nlake; a good oblong of water, notable in a district not abounding in the\r\ncommodity.  He would have it a feature of the district; and it had been\r\ndeepened and extended; up rose the springs, many ran the ducts.  Fredi's\r\npretty little bathshed or bower had a space of marble on the three-feet\r\nshallow it overhung with a shade of carved woodwork; it had a diving-\r\nboard for an eight-feet plunge; a punt and small row-boat of elegant\r\nbuild hard by.  Green ran the banks about, and a beechwood fringed with\r\nbirches curtained the Northward length: morning sun and evening had a\r\nfair face of water to paint.  Saw man ever the like for pleasing a\r\npoetical damsel?  So was Miss Fredi, the coldest of the party hitherto,\r\nand dreaming a preference of 'old places' like Creckholt and Craye Farm,\r\n'captured to be enraptured,' quite according to man's ideal of his\r\nbeneficence to the sex.  She pressed the hand of her young French\r\ngoverness, Louise de Seilles.  As in everything he did for his girl,\r\nVictor pointed boastfully to his forethought of her convenience and her\r\ntastes: the pine-panels of the interior, the shelves for her books, pegs\r\nto hang her favourite drawings, and the couch-bunk under a window to\r\nconceal the summerly recliner while throwing full light on her book; and\r\nthe hearth-square for logs, when she wanted fire: because Fredi bathed in\r\nany weather: the oaken towel-coffer; the wood-carvings of doves, tits,\r\nfishes; the rod for the flowered silken hangings she was to choose, and\r\nhave shy odalisque peeps of sunny water from her couch.\r\n\r\n'Fredi's Naiad retreat, when she wishes to escape Herr Strauscher or\r\nSignor Ruderi,' said Victor, having his grateful girl warm in an arm;\r\n'and if they head after her into the water, I back her to leave them\r\npuffing; she's a dolphin.  That water has three springs and gets all the\r\ndrainage of the upland round us.  I chose the place chiefly on account of\r\nit and the pines.  I do love pines!'\r\n\r\n'But, excellent man! what do you not love?' said Lady Grace, with the\r\ntimely hit upon the obvious, which rings.\r\n\r\n'It saves him from accumulation of tissue,' said Colney.\r\n\r\n'What does?' was eagerly asked by the wife of the homoeopathic Dr. John\r\nCormyn, a sentimental lady beset with fears of stoutness.\r\n\r\nVictor cried: 'Tush; don't listen to Colney, pray.'\r\n\r\nBut she heard Colney speak of a positive remedy; more immediately\r\neffective than an abjuration of potatoes and sugar.  She was obliged by\r\nher malady to listen, although detesting the irreverent ruthless man, who\r\ncould direct expanding frames, in a serious tone, to love; love\r\neverybody, everything; violently and universally love; and so without\r\nintermission pay out the fat created by a rapid assimilation of\r\nnutriment.  Obeseness is the most sensitive of our ailments: probably as\r\nbeing aware, that its legitimate appeal to pathos is ever smothered in\r\nits pudding-bed of the grotesque.  She was pained, and showed it, and was\r\nashamed of herself for showing it; and that very nearly fetched the tear.\r\n\r\n'Our host is an instance in proof,' Colney said.  He waved hand at the\r\nhouse.  His meaning was hidden; evidently he wanted victims.  Sight of\r\nLakelands had gripped him with the fell satiric itch; and it is a passion\r\nto sting and tear, on rational grounds.  His face meanwhile, which had\r\npoints of the handsome, signified a smile asleep, as if beneath a cloth.\r\nOnly those who knew him well were aware of the claw-like alertness under\r\nthe droop of eyelids.\r\n\r\nAdmiration was the common note, in the various keys.  The station\r\nselected for the South-eastward aspect of the dark-red gabled pile on\r\nits white shell-terrace, backed by a plantation of tall pines, a mounded\r\nand full-plumed company, above the left wing, was admired, in files and\r\nin volleys.  Marvellous, effectively miraculous, was the tale of the vow\r\nto have the great edifice finished within one year: and the strike of\r\nworkmen, and the friendly colloquy with them, the good reasoning, the\r\nunanimous return to duty; and the doubling, the trebling of the number\r\nof them; and the most glorious of sights-0the grand old English working\r\nwith a will! as Englishmen do when they come at last to heat; and they\r\nconquer, there is then nothing that they cannot conquer.  So the\r\nconqueror said.--And admirable were the conservatories running three long\r\nlines, one from the drawing-room, to a central dome for tropical growths.\r\nAnd the parterres were admired; also the newly-planted Irish junipers\r\nbounding the West-walk; and the three tiers of stately descent from the\r\nthree green terrace banks to the grassy slopes over the lake.  Again the\r\nlake was admired, the house admired.  Admiration was evoked for great\r\norchid-houses 'over yonder,' soon to be set up.\r\n\r\nOff we go to the kitchen-garden.  There the admiration is genial,\r\npractical.  We admire the extent of the beds marked out for asparagus,\r\nand the French disposition of the planting at wide intervals; and the\r\nFrench system of training peach, pear, and plum trees on the walls to win\r\nlength and catch sun, we much admire.  We admire the gardener.  We are\r\ninduced temporarily to admire the French people.  They are sagacious in\r\nfruit-gardens.  They have not the English Constitution, you think\r\nrightly; but in fruit-gardens they grow for fruit, and not, as Victor\r\nquotes a friend, for wood, which the valiant English achieve.  We hear\r\nand we see examples of sagacity; and we are further brought round to the\r\nold confession, that we cannot cook; Colney Durance has us there; we have\r\nnot studied herbs and savours; and so we are shocked backward step by\r\nstep until we retreat precipitately into the nooks where waxen tapers,\r\ncarefully tended by writers on the Press, light-up mysterious images of\r\nour national selves for admiration.  Something surely we do, or we should\r\nnot be where we are.  But what is it we do (excepting cricket, of course)\r\nwhich others cannot do?  Colney asks; and he excludes cricket and\r\nfootball.\r\n\r\nAn acutely satiric man in an English circle, that does not resort to the\r\nfist for a reply to him, may almost satiate the excessive fury roused in\r\nhis mind by an illogical people of a provocative prosperity, mainly\r\ntongueless or of leaden tongue above the pressure of their necessities,\r\nas he takes them to be.  They give him so many opportunities.  They are\r\nangry and helpless as the log hissing to the saw.  Their instinct to make\r\nuse of the downright in retort, restrained as it is by a buttoned coat of\r\ncivilization, is amusing, inviting.  Colney Durance allured them to the\r\nquag's edge and plunged them in it, to writhe patriotically; and although\r\nit may be said, that they felt their situation less than did he the venom\r\nthey sprang in his blood, he was cruel; he caused discomfort.  But these\r\ngood friends about him stood for the country, an illogical country; and\r\nas he could not well attack his host Victor Radnor, an irrational man,\r\nhe selected the abstract entity for the discharge of his honest spite.\r\n\r\nThe irrational friend was deeper at the source of his irritation than the\r\nillogical old motherland.  This house of Lakelands, the senselessness of\r\nhis friend in building it and designing to live in it, after experiences\r\nof an incapacity to stand in a serene contention with the world he\r\nchallenged, excited Colney's wasp.  He was punished, half way to frenzy\r\nbehind his placable demeanour, by having Dr. Schlesien for chorus.  And\r\nhere again, it was the unbefitting, not the person, which stirred his\r\nwrath.  A German on English soil should remember the dues of a guest.\r\nAt the same time, Colney said things to snare the acclamation of an\r\nobservant gentleman of that race, who is no longer in his first\r\nenthusiasm for English beef and the complexion of the women.  'Ah, ya,\r\nit is true, what you say: \"The English grow as fast as odders, but they\r\ngrow to corns instead of brains.\"  They are Bull.  Quaat true.'  He\r\nbellowed on a laugh the last half of the quotation.\r\n\r\nColney marked him.  His encounters with Fenellan were enlivening\r\nengagements and left no malice; only a regret, when the fencing passed\r\nhis guard, that Fenellan should prefer to flash for the minute.  He would\r\nhave met a pert defender of England, in the person of Miss Priscilla\r\nGraves, if she had not been occupied with observation of the bearing of\r\nLady Grace Halley toward Mr. Victor Radnor; which displeased her on\r\nbehalf of Mrs. Victor; she was besides hostile by race and class to\r\nan aristocratic assumption of licence.  Sparing Colney, she with some\r\nscorn condemned Mr. Pempton for allowing his country to be ridiculed\r\nwithout a word.  Mr. Pempton believed that the Vegetarian movement was\r\nmore progressive in England than in other lands, but he was at the\r\ndisadvantage with the fair Priscilla, that eulogy of his compatriots\r\non this account would win her coldest approval.  'Satire was never an\r\nargument,' he said, too evasively.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Septimus Barmby received the meed of her smile, for saying in\r\nhis many-fathom bass, with an eye on Victor: 'At least we may boast of\r\nbreeding men, who are leaders of men.'\r\n\r\nThe announcement of luncheon, by Victor's butler Arlington, opportunely\r\nfollowed and freighted the remark with a happy recognition of that which\r\ncomes to us from the hands of conquerors.  Dr. Schlesien himself, no\r\nantagonist to England, but like Colney Durance, a critic, speculated in\r\nview of the spread of pic-nic provision beneath the great glass dome, as\r\nto whether it might be, that these English were on another start out of\r\nthe dust in vigorous commercial enterprise, under leadership of one of\r\ntheir chance masterly minds-merchant, in this instance: and be debated\r\nwithin, whether Genius, occasionally developed in a surprising superior\r\nmanner by these haphazard English, may not sometimes wrest the prize from\r\nMethod; albeit we count for the long run, that Method has assurance of\r\nsuccess, however late in the race to set forth.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was a merry meal, with Victor and Nataly for host and hostess;\r\nFenellan, Colney Durance, and Lady Grace Halley for the talkers.  A gusty\r\nbosom of sleet overhung the dome, rattled on it, and rolling Westward,\r\nbecame a radiant mountain-land, partly worthy of Victor's phrase: 'A\r\nrange of Swiss Alps in air.'\r\n\r\n'With periwigs Louis Quatorze for peaks,' Colney added.\r\n\r\nAnd Fenellan improved on him: 'Or a magnified Bench of Judges at the\r\ntrial of your caerulean Phryne.'\r\n\r\nThe strip of white cloud flew on a whirl from the blue, to confirm it.\r\n\r\nBut Victor and Lady Grace rejected any play of conceits upon nature.\r\nViolent and horrid interventions of the counterfeit, such mad similes\r\nappeared to them, when pure coin was offered.  They loathed the Rev.\r\nSeptimus Barmby for proclaiming, that he had seen 'Chapters of Hebrew\r\nHistory in the grouping of clouds.'\r\n\r\nHis gaze was any one of the Chapters upon Nesta.  The clerical\r\ngentleman's voice was of a depth to claim for it the profoundest which\r\ncan be thought or uttered; and Nesta's tender youth had taken so strong\r\nan impression of sacredness from what Fenellan called 'his chafer tones,'\r\nthat her looks were often given him in gratitude, for the mere sound.\r\nNataly also had her sense of safety in acquiescing to such a voice coming\r\nfrom such a garb.  Consequently, whenever Fenellan and Colney were at\r\nhim, drawing him this way and that for utterances cathedral in sentiment\r\nand sonorousness, these ladies shed protecting beams; insomuch that he\r\nwas inspired to the agreeable conceptions whereof frequently rash\r\nprojects are an issue.\r\n\r\nTouching the neighbours of Lakelands, they were principally enriched\r\nmerchants, it appeared; a snippet or two of the fringe of aristocracy lay\r\nhere and there among them; and one racy-of-the-soil old son of Thames,\r\nhaving the manners proper to last century's yeoman.  Mr. Pempton knew\r\nsomething of this quaint Squire of Hefferstone, Beaves Urmsing by name;\r\na ruddy man, right heartily Saxon; a still glowing brand amid the ashes\r\nof the Heptarchy hearthstone; who had a song, The Marigolds, which he\r\nwould troll out for you anywhere, on any occasion.  To have so near to\r\nthe metropolis one from the centre of the venerable rotundity of the\r\ncountry, was rare.  Victor exclaimed 'Come!' in ravishment over the\r\npicturesqueness of a neighbour carrying imagination away to the founts\r\nof England; and his look at Nataly proposed.  Her countenance was\r\ninapprehensive.  He perceived resistance, and said: 'I have met two or\r\nthree of them in the train: agreeable men: Gladding, the banker;\r\na General Fanning; that man Blathenoy, great billbroker.  But the fact\r\nis, close on London, we're independent of neighbours; we mean to be.\r\nLakelands and London practically join.'\r\n\r\n'The mother city becoming the suburb,' murmured Colney, in report of the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n'You must expect to be invaded, sir,' said Mr. Sowerby; and Victor\r\nshrugged: 'We are pretty safe.'\r\n\r\n'The lock of a door seems a potent security until some one outside is\r\nheard fingering the handle nigh midnight,' Fenellan threw out his airy\r\nnothing of a remark.\r\n\r\nIt struck on Nataly's heart.  'So you will not let us be lonely here,'\r\nshe said to her guests.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Septimus Barmby was mouthpiece for congregations.  Sound of a\r\nsubterranean roar, with a blast at the orifice, informed her of their\r\n'very deep happiness in the privilege.'\r\n\r\nHe comforted her.  Nesta smiled on him thankfully.\r\n\r\n'Don't imagine, Mrs. Victor, that you can be shut off from neighbours,\r\nin a house like this; and they have a claim,' said Lady Grace, quitting\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nFenellan and Colney thought so:\r\n\r\n'Like mice at a cupboard.'\r\n\r\n'Beetles in a kitchen.'\r\n\r\n'No, no-no, no !' Victor shook head, pitiful over the good people likened\r\nto things unclean, and royally upraising them: in doing which, he\r\nscattered to vapour the leaden incubi they had been upon his flatter\r\nmoods of late.  'No, but it's a rapture to breathe the air here!'  His\r\nlifted chest and nostrils were for the encouragement of Nataly to soar\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nShe summoned her smile and nodded.\r\n\r\nHe spoke aside to Lady Grace: 'The dear soul wants time to compose\r\nherself after a grand surprise.'\r\n\r\nShe replied: 'I think I could soon be reconciled.  How much land?'\r\n\r\n'In treaty for some hundred and eighty or ninety acres .  .  .  in all\r\nat present three hundred and seventy, including plantations, lake,\r\nouthouses.'\r\n\r\n'Large enough; land paying as it does--that is, not paying.  We shall be\r\nhaving to gamble in the City systematically for subsistence.'\r\n\r\n'You will not so much as jest on the subject.'\r\n\r\nComing from such a man, that was clear sky thunder.  The lady played\r\nit off in a shadowy pout and shrug while taking a stamp of his\r\nmasterfulness, not so volatile.\r\n\r\nShe said to Nataly: 'Our place in Worcestershire is about half the size,\r\nif as much.  Large enough when we're not crowded out with gout and can\r\nopen to no one.  Some day you will visit us, I hope.'\r\n\r\n'You we count on here, Lady Grace.'\r\n\r\nIt was an over-accentuated response; unusual with this well-bred woman;\r\nand a bit of speech that does not flow, causes us to speculate.  The lady\r\nresumed: 'I value the favour.  We're in a horsey-doggy-foxy circle down\r\nthere.  We want enlivening.  If we had your set of musicians and\r\ntalkers!'\r\n\r\nNataly smiled in vacuous kindness, at a loss for the retort of a\r\ncompliment to a person she measured.  Lady Grace also was an amiable\r\nhostile reviewer.  Each could see, to have cited in the other, defects\r\ncommon to the lower species of the race, admitting a superior personal\r\nquality or two; which might be pleaded in extenuation; and if the apology\r\nproved too effective, could be dispersed by insistence upon it, under an\r\nimplied appeal to benevolence.  When we have not a liking for the\r\ncreature whom we have no plain cause to dislike, we are minutely just.\r\n\r\nDuring the admiratory stroll along the ground-floor rooms, Colney\r\nDurance found himself beside Dr. Schlesien; the latter smoking, striding,\r\nemphasizing, but bearable, as the one of the party who was not\r\nperpetually at the gape in laudation.  Colney was heard to say: 'No\r\ndoubt: the German is the race the least mixed in Europe: it might\r\nchallenge aboriginals for that.  Oddly, it has invented the Cyclopaedia\r\nfor knowledge, the sausage for nutrition!  How would you explain it?'\r\n\r\nDr. Schlesien replied with an Atlas shrug under fleabite to the\r\ninsensately infantile interrogation.\r\n\r\nHe in turn was presently heard.\r\n\r\n'But, my good sir! you quote me your English Latin.  I must beg of you\r\nyou write it down.  It is orally incomprehensible to Continentals.'\r\n\r\n'We are Islanders!' Colney shrugged in languishment.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you do great things .  .  .'  Dr. Schlesien rejoined in kindness,\r\nmaking his voice a musical intimation of the smallness of the things.\r\n\r\n'We build great houses, to employ our bricks'\r\n\r\n'No, Colney, to live in,' said Victor.\r\n\r\n'Scarcely long enough to warm them.'\r\n\r\n'What do you .  .  .  fiddle!'\r\n\r\n'They are not Hohenzollerns !'\r\n\r\n'It is true,' Dr. Schlesien called.  'No, but you learn discipline; you\r\nbuild.  I say wid you, not Hohenzollerns you build!  But you shall look\r\nabove: Eyes up.  Ire necesse est.  Good, but mount; you come to\r\nsomething.  Have ideas.'\r\n\r\n'Good, but when do we reach your level?'\r\n\r\n'Sir, I do not say more than that we do not want instruction from\r\nforeigners.'\r\n\r\n'Pupil to paedagogue indeed.  You have the wreath in Music, in\r\nJurisprudence, Chemistry, Scholarship, Beer, Arms, Manners.'\r\n\r\nDr. Schlesien puffed a tempest of tobacco and strode.\r\n\r\n'He is chiselling for wit in the Teutonic block,' Colney said, falling\r\nback to Fenellan.\r\n\r\nFenellan observed: 'You might have credited him with the finished\r\nsculpture.'\r\n\r\n'They're ahead of us in sticking at the charge of wit.'\r\n\r\n'They've a widening of their swallow since Versailles.'\r\n\r\n'Manners?'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's a tight cravat for the Teutonic thrapple!  But he's off by\r\nhimself to loosen it.'\r\n\r\nVictor came on the couple testily.  'What are you two concocting!\r\nI say, do keep the peace, please.  An excellent good fellow; better up\r\nin politics than any man I know; understands music; means well, you can\r\nsee.  You two hate a man at all serious.  And he doesn't bore with his\r\nknowledge.  A scholar too.'\r\n\r\n'If he'll bring us the atmosphere of the groves of Academe, he may swing\r\nhis ferule pickled in himself, and welcome,' said Fenellan.\r\n\r\n'Yes!' Victor nodded at a recognized antagonism in Fenellan; 'but\r\nColney's always lifting the Germans high above us.'\r\n\r\n'It's to exercise his muscles.'\r\n\r\nVictor headed to the other apartments, thinking that the Rev. Septimus\r\nand young Sowerby, Old England herself, were spared by the diversion of\r\nthese light skirmishing shots from their accustomed victims to the\r\n'masculine people of our time.  His friends would want a drilling to be\r\nof aid to him in his campaign to come.  For it was one, and a great one.\r\nHe remembered his complete perception of the plan, all the elements of\r\nit, the forward whirling of it, just before the fall on London Bridge.\r\nThe greatness of his enterprise laid such hold of him that the smallest\r\nof obstacles had a villanous aspect; and when, as anticipated, Colney and\r\nFenellan were sultry flies for whomsoever they could fret, he was blind\r\nto the reading of absurdities which caused Fredi's eyes to stream and\r\nLady Grace beside him to stand awhile and laugh out her fit.  Young\r\nSowerby appeared forgiving enough--he was a perfect gentleman: but\r\nFredi's appalling sense of fun must try him hard.  And those young\r\nfellows are often more wounded by a girl's thoughtless laughter than\r\nby a man's contempt.  Nataly should have protected him.  Her face had\r\nthe air of a smiling general satisfaction; sign of a pleasure below the\r\nmark required; sign too of a sleepy partner for a battle.  Even in the\r\nwonderful kitchen, arched and pillared (where the explanation came to\r\nNesta of Madame Callet's frequent leave of absence of late, when an\r\ninferior dinner troubled her father in no degree), even there his Nataly\r\nlistened to the transports of the guests with benign indulgence.\r\n\r\n'Mama!' said Nesta, ready to be entranced by kitchens in her bubbling\r\nanimation: she meant the recalling of instances of the conspirator her\r\nfather had been.\r\n\r\n'You none of you guessed Armandine's business!' Victor cried, in a glee\r\nthat pushed to make the utmost of this matter and count against chagrin.\r\n'She was off to Paris; went to test the last inventions:--French brains\r\nare always alert:--and in fact, those kitchen-ranges, gas and coal, and\r\nthe apparatus for warming plates and dishes, the whole of the battery is\r\non the model of the Duc d'Ariane's--finest in Europe.  Well,' he agreed\r\nwith Colney, 'to say France is enough.'\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton spoke to Miss Graves of the task for a woman to conduct a\r\ncommand so extensive.  And, as when an inoffensive wayfarer has chanced\r\nto set foot near a wasp's nest, out on him came woman and her champions,\r\nthe worthy and the sham, like a blast of powder.\r\n\r\nVictor ejaculated: 'Armandine !'  Whoever doubted her capacity, knew not\r\nArmandine; or not knowing Armandine, knew not the capacity in women.\r\n\r\nWith that utterance of her name, he saw the orangey spot on London\r\nBridge, and the sinking Tower and masts and funnels, and the rising of\r\nthem, on his return to his legs; he recollected, that at the very edge of\r\nthe fall he had Armandine strongly in his mind.  She was to do her part:\r\nFenellan and Colney on the surface, she below: and hospitality was to do\r\nits part, and music was impressed--the innocent Concerts; his wealth, all\r\nhis inventiveness were to serve;--and merely to attract and win the\r\ntastes of people, for a social support to Lakelands!  Merely that?  Much\r\nmore:--if Nataly's coldness to the place would but allow him to form an\r\nestimate of how much.  At the same time, being in the grasp of his\r\npresent disappointment, he perceived a meanness in the result, that was\r\nastonishing and afflicting.  He had not ever previously felt imagination\r\nstarving at the vision of success.  Victor had yet to learn, that the man\r\nwith a material object in aim, is the man of his object; and the nearer\r\nto his mark, often the farther is he from a sober self; he is more the\r\narrow of his bow than bow to his arrow.  This we pay for scheming: and\r\nsuccess is costly; we find we have pledged the better half of ourselves\r\nto clutch it; not to be redeemed with the whole handful of our prize!\r\nHe was, however, learning after his leaping fashion.  Nataly's defective\r\nsympathy made him look at things through the feelings she depressed.\r\nA shadow of his missed Idea on London Bridge seemed to cross him from the\r\nclose flapping of a wing within reach.  He could say only, that it would,\r\nif caught, have been an answer to the thought disturbing him.\r\n\r\nNataly drew Colney Durance with her eyes to step beside her, on the\r\ndescent to the terrace.  Little Skepsey hove in sight, coming swift as\r\nthe point of an outrigger over the flood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSKEPSEY IN MOTION\r\n\r\nThe bearer of his master's midday letters from London shot beyond Nataly\r\nas soon as seen, with an apparent snap of his body in passing.  He\r\nsteamed to the end of the terrace and delivered the packet, returning at\r\nthe same rate of speed, to do proper homage to the lady he so much\r\nrespected.  He had left the railway-station on foot instead of taking a\r\nfly, because of a calculation that he would save three minutes; which he\r\nhad not lost for having to come through the raincloud.  'Perhaps the\r\ncontrary,' Skepsey said: it might be judged to have accelerated his\r\ncourse: and his hat dripped, and his coat shone, and he soaped his hands,\r\ncheerful as an ouzel-cock when the sun is out again.\r\n\r\n'Many cracked crowns lately, in the Manly Art?' Colney inquired of him.\r\nAnd Skepsey answered with precision of statement: 'Crowns, no, sir; the\r\nnose, it may happen; but it cannot be said to be the rule.'\r\n\r\n'You are of opinion, that the practice of Scientific Pugilism offers us\r\ncompensation for the broken bridge of a nose?'\r\n\r\n'In an increase of manly self-esteem: I do, sir, yes.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey was shy of this gentleman's bite; and he fancied his defence had\r\nbeen correct.  Perceiving a crumple of the lips of Mr. Durance, he took\r\nthe attitude of a watchful dubiety.\r\n\r\n'But, my goodness, you are wet through!' cried Nataly, reproaching\r\nherself for the tardy compassion; and Nesta ran up to them and heaped a\r\nthousand pities on her 'poor dear Skip,' and drove him in beneath the\r\nglass-dome to the fragments of pic-nic, and poured champagne for him,\r\n'lest his wife should have to doctor him for a cold,' and poured afresh,\r\nwhen he had obeyed her: 'for the toasting of Lakelands, dear Skepsey !'\r\nimpossible to resist: so he drank, and blinked; and was then told, that\r\nbefore using his knife and fork he must betake himself to some fire of\r\nshavings and chips, where coffee was being made, for the purpose of\r\ndrying his clothes.  But this he would not hear of: he was pledged to\r\nbusiness, to convey his master's letters, and he might have to catch a\r\ntrain by the last quarter-minute, unless it was behind the time-tables;\r\nhe must hold himself ready to start.  Entreated, adjured, commanded,\r\nSkepsey commiseratingly observed to Colney Durance, 'The ladies do not\r\nunderstand, sir!'  For Turk of Constantinople had never a more haremed\r\nopinion of the unfitness of women in the brave world of action.  The\r\npersistence of these ladies endeavouring to obstruct him in the course of\r\nhis duty, must have succeeded save that for one word of theirs he had\r\ntwo, and twice the promptitude of motion.  He explained to them, as to\r\ngood children, that the loss of five minutes might be the loss of a Post,\r\nthe loss of thousands of pounds, the loss of the character of a Firm;\r\nand he was away to the terrace.  Nesta headed him and waved him back.\r\nShe and her mother rebuked him: they called him unreasonable; wherein\r\nthey resembled the chief example of the sex to him, in a wife he had at\r\nhome, who levelled that charge against her husband when most she needed\r\ndiscipline: the woman laid hand on the very word legitimately his own\r\nfor the justification of his process with her.\r\n\r\n'But, Skips! if you are ill and we have to nurse you!' said Nesta.\r\n\r\nShe forgot the hospital, he told her cordially, and laughed at the notion\r\nof a ducking producing a cold or a cold a fever, or anything consumption,\r\nwith him.  So the ladies had to keep down their anxious minds and allow\r\nhim to stand in wet clothing to eat his cold pie and salad.\r\n\r\nMiss Priscilla Graves entering to them, became a witness that they were\r\nseductresses for inducing him to drink wine--and a sparkling wine.\r\n\r\n'It is to warm him,' they pleaded; and she said: 'He must be warm from\r\nhis walk'; and they said: 'But he is wet'; and said she, without a show\r\nof feeling: 'Warm water, then'; and Skepsey writhed, as if in the grasp\r\nof anatomists, at being the subject of female contention or humane\r\nconsideration.  Miss Graves caught signs of the possible proselyte in\r\nhim; she remarked encouragingly:\r\n\r\n'I am sure he does not like it; he still has a natural taste.'\r\n\r\nShe distressed his native politeness, for the glass was in his hand, and\r\nhe was fully aware of her high-principled aversion; and he profoundly\r\nbowed to principles, believing his England to be pillared on them; and\r\nthe lady looked like one who bore the standard of a principle; and if we\r\nslap and pinch and starve our appetites, the idea of a principle seems\r\nentering us to support.  Subscribing to a principle, our energies are\r\nrefreshed; we have a faith in the country that was not with us before the\r\nact; and of a real well-founded faith come the glowing thoughts which we\r\nhave at times: thoughts of England heading the nations; when the smell of\r\nan English lane under showers challenges Eden, and the threading of a\r\nLondon crowd tunes discords to the swell of a cathedral organ.  It may\r\nbe, that by the renunciation of any description of alcohol, a man will\r\nstand clearer-headed to serve his country.  He may expect to have a\r\nclearer memory, for certain: he will not be asking himself, unable to\r\ndecide, whether his master named a Mr. Journeyman or a Mr. Jarniman, as\r\nthe person he declined to receive.  Either of the two is repulsed upon\r\nhis application, owing to the guilty similarity of sounds but what we are\r\nto think of is, our own sad state of inefficiency in failing to remember;\r\nwhich accuses our physical condition, therefore our habits.--Thus the\r\nlittle man debated, scarcely requiring more than to hear the right word,\r\nto be a convert and make him a garland of the proselyte's fetters.\r\n\r\nDestructively for the cause she advocated, Miss Priscilla gestured the\r\nputting forth of an abjuring hand, with the recommendation to him, so to\r\nput aside temptation that instant; and she signified in a very ugly jerk\r\nof her features, the vilely filthy stuff Morality thought it, however\r\npleasing it might be to a palate corrupted by indulgence of the sensual\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\nBut the glass had been handed to him by the lady he respected, who looked\r\nangelical in offering it, divinely other than ugly; and to her he could\r\nnot be discourteous; not even to pay his homage to the representative of\r\na principle.  He bowed to Miss Graves, and drank, and rushed forth;\r\nhearing shouts behind him.\r\n\r\nHis master had a packet of papers ready, easy for the pocket.\r\n\r\n'By the way, Skepsey,' he said, 'if a man named Jarniman should call at\r\nthe office, I will see him.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey's grey eyes came out.\r\n\r\nOr was it Journeyman, that his master would not see; and Jarniman that he\r\nwould?\r\n\r\nHis habit of obedience, pride of apprehension, and the time to catch the\r\ntrain, forbade inquiry.  Besides he knew of himself of old, that his\r\npuzzles were best unriddled running.\r\n\r\nThe quick of pace are soon in the quick of thoughts.\r\n\r\nJarniman, then, was a man whom his master, not wanting to see, one day,\r\nand wanting to see, on another day, might wish to conciliate: a case of\r\npolicy.  Let Jarniman go.  Journeyman, on the other hand, was nobody at\r\nall, a ghost of the fancy.  Yet this Journeyman was as important an\r\nindividual, he was a dread reality; more important to Skepsey in the\r\nlight of patriot: and only in that light was he permitted of a scrupulous\r\nconscience and modest mind to think upon himself when the immediate\r\nsubject was his master's interests.  For this Journeyman had not an\r\nexcuse for existence in Mr. Radnor's pronunciation: he was born of the\r\nbuzz of a troubled ear, coming of a disordered brain, consequent\r\nnecessarily upon a disorderly stomach, that might protest a degree of\r\ncomparative innocence, but would be shamed utterly under inspection of\r\nthe eye of a lady of principle.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the value to his country of a servant who could not\r\naccurately recollect his master's words!  Miss Graves within him asked\r\nthe rapid little man, whether indeed his ideas were his own after\r\ndraughts of champagne.\r\n\r\nThe ideas, excited to an urgent animation by his racing trot, were a\r\nquiverful in flight over an England terrible to the foe and dancing on\r\nthe green.  Right so: but would we keep up the dance, we must be red iron\r\nto touch: and the fighter for conquering is the one who can last and has\r\nthe open brain;--and there you have a point against alcohol.  Yes, and\r\nMiss Graves, if she would press it, with her natural face, could be\r\npleasant and persuasive: and she ought to be told she ought to marry, for\r\nthe good of the country.  Women taking liquor: Skepsey had a vision of\r\nhis wife with rheumy peepers and miauly mouth, as he had once beheld the\r\ncreature:--Oh! they need discipline not such would we have for the\r\nmothers of our English young.  Decidedly the women of principle are bound\r\nto enter wedlock; they should be bound by law.  Whereas, in the opposing\r\ncase--the binding of the unprincipled to a celibate state--such a law\r\nwould have saved Skepsey from the necessitated commission of deeds of\r\ndiscipline with one of the female sex, and have rescued his progeny from\r\na likeness to the corn-stalk reverting to weed.  He had but a son for\r\nEngland's defence; and the frame of his boy might be set quaking by a\r\nthump on the wind of a drum; the courage of William Barlow Skepsey would\r\nnot stand against a sheep; it would wind-up hares to have a run at him\r\nout in the field.  Offspring of a woman of principle!  .  .  .  but there\r\nis no rubbing out in life: why dream of it?  Only that one would not have\r\none's country the loser!\r\n\r\nDwell a moment on the reverse--and first remember the lesson of the\r\nCaptivity of the Jews and the outcry of their backsliding and\r\nrepentance:--see a nation of the honourably begotten; muscular men\r\ndisdaining the luxuries they will occasionally condescend to taste,\r\nlike some tribe in Greece; boxers, rowers, runners, climbers; braced,\r\nindomitable; magnanimous, as only the strong can be; an army at word,\r\nwinning at a stroke the double battle of the hand and the heart: men who\r\ncan walk the paths through the garden of the pleasures.  They receive\r\nfitting mates, of a build to promise or aid in ensuring depth of chest\r\nand long reach of arm for their progeny.\r\n\r\nDown goes the world before them.\r\n\r\nAnd we see how much would be due for this to a corps of ladies like Miss\r\nGraves, not allowed to remain too long on the stalk of spinsterhood.  Her\r\nage might count twenty-eight: too long!  She should be taught that men\r\ncan, though truly ordinary women cannot, walk these orderly paths through\r\nthe garden.  An admission to women, hinting restrictions, on a ticket\r\nmarked 'in moderation' (meaning, that they may pluck a flower or fruit\r\nalong the pathway border to which they are confined), speedily, alas,\r\nexhibits them at a mad scramble across the pleasure-beds.  They know not\r\nmoderation.  Neither for their own sakes nor for the sakes of Posterity\r\nwill they hold from excess, when they are not pledged to shun it.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, that their minds cannot conceive the abstract, as men do.\r\n\r\nBut there are grounds for supposing that the example before them of a sex\r\nexercising self-control in freedom, would induce women to pledge\r\nthemselves to a similar abnegation, until they gain some sense of touch\r\nupon the impalpable duty to the generations coming after us thanks to the\r\nvoluntary example we set them.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous task, which had hitherto baffled Skepsey in the course of\r\nconversational remonstrances with his wife;--that of getting the Idea of\r\nPosterity into the understanding of its principal agent, might then be\r\nmastered.\r\n\r\nTherefore clearly men have to begin the salutary movement: it manifestly\r\ndevolves upon them.  Let them at once take to rigorous physical training.\r\nWomen under compulsion, as vessels: men in their magnanimity,\r\npatriotically, voluntarily.\r\n\r\nMiss Graves must have had an intimation for him; he guessed it; and it\r\nplunged him into a conflict with her, that did not suffer him to escape\r\nwithout ruefully feeling the feebleness of his vocabulary: and\r\nconsequently he made a reluctant appeal to figures, and it hung upon\r\nthe bolder exhibition of lists and tables as to whether he was beaten;\r\nand if beaten, he was morally her captive; and this being the case,\r\nnothing could be more repulsive to Skepsey; seeing that he, unable of\r\nhis nature passively or partially to undertake a line of conduct, beheld\r\nhimself wearing a detestable 'ribbon,' for sign of an oath quite\r\nneedlessly sworn (simply to satisfy the lady overcoming him with nimbler\r\ntongue), and blocking the streets, marching in bands beneath banners,\r\nhowling hymns.\r\n\r\nStatistics, upon which his master and friends, after exchanging opinions\r\nin argument, always fell back, frightened him.  As long as they had\r\nno opponents of their own kind, they swept the field, they were\r\nintelligible, as the word 'principle' had become.  But the appearance\r\nof one body of Statistics invariably brought up another; and the strokes\r\nand counterstrokes were like a play of quarter-staff on the sconce,\r\nto knock all comprehension out of Skepsey.  Otherwise he would not\r\nunwillingly have inquired to-morrow into the Statistics of the\r\ncontroversy between the waters of the wells and of the casks, prepared\r\nto walk over to the victorious, however objectionable that proceeding.\r\nHe hoped to question his master some day except that his master would\r\nvery naturally have a tendency to sum-up in favour of wine--good wine,\r\nin moderation; just as Miss Graves for the cup of tea--not so\r\nthoughtfully stipulating that it should be good and not too copious.\r\nStatistics are according to their conjurors; they are not independent\r\nbodies, with native colours; they needs must be painted by the different\r\nhands they pass through, and they may be multiplied; a nought or so\r\ncounts for nothing with the teller.  Skepsey saw that.  Yet they can\r\novercome: even as fictitious battalions, they can overcome.  He shrank\r\nfrom the results of a ciphering match having him for object, and was\r\nashamed of feeling to Statistics as women to giants; nevertheless he\r\nacknowledged that the badge was upon him, if Miss Graves should beat her\r\nmaster in her array of figures, to insist on his wearing it, as she\r\nwould, she certainly would.  And against his internal conviction perhaps;\r\nwith the knowledge that the figures were an unfortified display, and his\r\noath of bondage an unmanly servility, the silliest of ceremonies!  He was\r\nshockingly feminine to Statistics.\r\n\r\nMr. Durance despised them: he called them, arguing against Mr. Radnor,\r\n'those emotional things,' not comprehensibly to Skepsey.  But Mr.\r\nDurance, a very clever gentleman, could not be right in everything.  He\r\nmade strange remarks upon his country.  Dr. Yatt attributed them to the\r\nstate of 'his digestion.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Fenellan had said of Mr. Durance that, as 'a barrister wanting\r\nbriefs, the speech in him had been bottled too long and was an overripe\r\nwine dripping sour drops through the rotten cork.'  Mr. Fenellan said it\r\nlaughing, he meant no harm.  Skepsey was sure he had the words.  He heard\r\nno more than other people hear; he remembered whole sentences, and many:\r\non one of his runs, this active little machine, quickened by motion to\r\nfire, revived the audible of years back; whatever suited his turn of mind\r\nat the moment rushed to the rapid wheels within him.  His master's\r\nbusiness and friends, his country's welfare and advancement, these, with\r\nrecords, items, anticipations, of the manlier sports to decorate, were\r\nhis current themes; all being chopped and tossed and mixed in salad\r\naccordance by his fervour of velocity.  And if you would like a further\r\ndefinition of Genius, think of it as a form of swiftness.  It is the\r\nlively young great-grandson, in the brain, of the travelling force which\r\nmathematicians put to paper, in a row of astounding ciphers, for the\r\nmotion of earth through space; to the generating of heat, whereof is\r\nmultiplication, whereof deposited matter, and so your chaos, your half-\r\nlighted labyrinth, your, ceaseless pressure to evolvement; and then\r\nLight, and so Creation, order, the work of Genius.  What do you say?\r\n\r\nWithout having a great brain, the measure of it possessed by Skepsey was\r\nalive under strong illumination.  In his heart, while doing penance for\r\nhis presumptuousness, he believed that he could lead regiments of men.\r\nHe was not the army's General, he was the General's Lieutenant, now and\r\nthen venturing to suggest a piece of counsel to his Chief.  On his own\r\nparticular drilled regiments, his Chief may rely; and on his knowledge\r\nof the country of the campaign, roads, morasses, masking hills, dividing\r\nrivers.  He had mapped for himself mentally the battles of conquerors in\r\nhis favourite historic reading; and he understood the value of a plan,\r\nand the danger of sticking to it, and the advantage of a big army for\r\nflanking; and he manoeuvred a small one cunningly to make it a bolt at\r\nthe telling instant.  Dartrey Fenellan had explained to him Frederick's\r\noblique attack, Napoleon's employment of the artillery arm preparatory to\r\nthe hurling of the cataract on the spot of weakness, Wellington's\r\nparallel march with Marmont up to the hour of the decisive cut through\r\nthe latter at Salamanca; and Skepsey treated his enemy to the like,\r\ndeferentially reporting the engagement to a Chief whom his modesty kept\r\nin eminence, for the receiving of the principal honours.  As to his men,\r\nof all classes and sorts, they are so supple with training that they\r\nsustain a defeat like the sturdy pugilist a knock off his legs, and up\r\nsmiling a minute after--one of the truly beautiful sights on this earth!\r\nThey go at the double half a day, never sounding a single pair of bellows\r\namong them.  They have their appetites in full control, to eat when they\r\ncan, or cheerfully fast.  They have healthy frames, you see; and as the\r\nhealthy frame is not artificially heated, it ensues that, under any title\r\nyou like, they profess the principles--into the bog we go, we have got\r\nround to it!--the principles of those horrible marching and chanting\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nThen, must our England, to be redoubtable to the enemy, be a detestable\r\ncountry for habitation?\r\n\r\nHere was a knot.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's head dropped lower, he went as a ram.  The sayings of Mr.\r\nDurance about his dear England: that 'her remainder of life is in the\r\nactivity of her diseases'--that 'she has so fed upon Pap of Compromise\r\nas to be unable any longer to conceive a muscular resolution': that\r\n'she is animated only as the carcase to the blow-fly'; and so forth:--\r\ncharged on him during his wrestle with his problem.  And the gentlemen\r\nhad said, had permitted himself to say, that our England's recent history\r\nwas a provincial apothecary's exhibition of the battle of bane and\r\nantidote.  Mr. Durance could hardly mean it.  But how could one answer\r\nhim when he spoke of the torpor of the people, and of the succeeding\r\nGovernments as a change of lacqueys--or the purse-string's lacqueys?\r\nHe said, that Old England has taken to the arm-chair for good, and thinks\r\nit her whole business to pronounce opinions and listen to herself;\r\nand that, in the face of an armed Europe, this great nation is living\r\non sufferance.  Oh!\r\n\r\nSkepsey had uttered the repudiating exclamation.\r\n\r\n'Feel quite up to it?' he was asked by his neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe mover of armed hosts for the defence of the country sat in a third-\r\nclass carriage of the train, approaching the first of the stations on the\r\nway to town.  He was instantly up to the level of an external world, and\r\nfell into give and take with a burly broad communicative man; located in\r\nLondon, but born in the North, in view of Durham cathedral, as he thanked\r\nhis Lord; who was of the order of pork-butcher; which succulent calling\r\nhad carried him down to near upon the borders of Surrey and Sussex, some\r\nmiles beyond the new big house of a Mister whose name he had forgotten,\r\nthough he had heard it mentioned by an acquaintance interested in the\r\ngentleman's doings.  But his object was to have a look at a rare breed of\r\nswine, worth the journey; that didn't run to fat so much as to flavour,\r\nhad longer legs, sharp snouts to plump their hams; over from Spain, it\r\nseemed; and the gentleman owning them was for selling them, finding them\r\nwild past correction.  But the acquaintance mentioned, who was down to\r\nvisit t' other gentleman's big new edifice in workmen's hands, had a\r\nmother, who had been cook to a family, and was now widow of a cook's\r\nshop; ham, beef, and sausages, prime pies to order; and a good specimen\r\nherself; and if ever her son saw her spirit at his bedside, there\r\nwouldn't be room for much else in that chamber--supposing us to keep our\r\nshapes.  But he was the right sort of son, anxious to push his mother's\r\nshop where he saw a chance, and do it cheap; and those foreign pigs,\r\nafter a disappointment to their importer, might be had pretty cheap, and\r\nwere accounted tasty.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's main thought was upon war: the man had discoursed of pigs.\r\n\r\nHe informed the man of his having heard from a scholar, that pigs had\r\nbeen the cause of more bloody battles than any other animal.\r\n\r\nHow so?  the pork-butcher asked, and said he was not much of a scholar,\r\nand pigs might be provoking, but he had not heard they were a cause of\r\nstrife between man and man.  For possession of them, Skepsey explained.\r\nOh! possession!  Why, we've heard of bloody battles for the possession of\r\nwomen!  Men will fight for almost anything they care to get or call their\r\nown, the pork-butcher said; and he praised Old England for avoiding war.\r\nSkepsey nodded.  How if war is forced on us?  Then we fight. Suppose we\r\nare not prepared?--We soon get that up. Skepsey requested him to state\r\nthe degree of resistance he might think he could bring against a pair of\r\nskilful fists, in a place out of hearing of the police.\r\n\r\n'Say, you!' said the pork-butcher, and sharply smiled, for he was a man\r\nof size.\r\n\r\n'I would give you two minutes,' rejoined Skepsey, eyeing him intently and\r\nkindly: insomuch that it could be seen he was not in the conundrum vein.\r\n\r\n'Rather short allowance, eh, master?' said the bigger man.  'Feel here';\r\nhe straightened out his arm and doubled it, raising a proud bridge of\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nSkepsey performed the national homage to muscle.\r\n\r\n'Twice that, would not help without the science,' he remarked, and let\r\nhis arm be gripped in turn.\r\n\r\nThe pork-butcher's throat sounded, as it were, commas and colons,\r\npunctuations in his reflections, while he tightened fingers along the\r\niron lump.  'Stringy.  You're a wiry one, no mistake.'  It was encomium.\r\nWith the ingrained contempt of size for a smallness that has not yet\r\ntaught it the prostrating lesson, he said: 'Weight tells.'\r\n\r\n'In a wrestle,' Skepsey admitted.  'Allow me to say, you would not touch\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'And how do you know I'm not a trifle handy with the maulers myself?'\r\n\r\n'You will pardon me for saying, it would be worse for you if you were.'\r\n\r\nThe pork-butcher was flung backward.  'Are you a Professor, may I\r\ninquire?'\r\n\r\nSkepsey rejected the title.  'I can engage to teach young men, upon a\r\nproper observance of first principles.'\r\n\r\n'They be hanged!' cried the ruffled pork-butcher.  'Our best men never\r\ngot it out of books.  Now, you tell me--you've got a spiflicating style\r\nof talk about you--no brag, you tell me--course, the best man wins, if\r\nyou mean that: now, if I was one of 'em, and I fetches you a bit of a\r\nflick, how then?  Would you be ready to step out with a real Professor?'\r\n\r\n'I should claim a fair field,' was the answer, made in modesty.\r\n\r\n'And you'd expect to whop me with they there principles of yours?'\r\n\r\n'I should expect to.'\r\n\r\n'Bang me!' was roared.  After a stare at the mild little figure with the\r\nfitfully dead-levelled large grey eyes in front of him, the pork-butcher\r\nresumed: 'Take you for the man you say you be, you're just the man for my\r\nfriend Jam and me.  He dearly loves to see a set-to, self the same.  What\r\nprettier?  And if you would be so obliging some day as to favour us with\r\na display, we'd head a cap conformably, whether you'd the best of it,\r\naccording to your expectations, or t' other way:--For there never was\r\nshame in a jolly good licking as the song says: that is, if you take it\r\nand make it appear jolly good.  And find you an opponent meet and fit,\r\nnever doubt.  Ever had the worse of an encounter, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Often, Sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's good.  And it didn't destroy your confidence?'\r\n\r\n'Added to it, I hope.'\r\n\r\nAt this point, it became a crying necessity for Skepsey to escape from\r\nan area of boastfulness, into which he had fallen inadvertently; and he\r\nhastened to apologize 'for his personal reference,' that was intended for\r\nan illustration of our country caught unawares by a highly trained picked\r\nsoldiery, inferior in numbers to the patriotic levies, but sharp at the\r\nedge and knowing how to strike.  Measure the axe, measure the tree; and\r\nwhich goes down first?\r\n\r\n'Invasion, is it?--and you mean, we're not to hit back?' the pork-butcher\r\nbellowed, and presently secured a murmured approbation from an audience\r\nof three, that had begun to comprehend the dialogue, and strengthened him\r\nin a manner to teach Skepsey the foolishness of ever urging analogies of\r\ntoo extended a circle to close sharply on the mark.  He had no longer a\r\nchance, he was overborne, identified with the fated invader, rolled away\r\ninto the chops of the Channel, to be swallowed up entire, and not a rag\r\nleft of him, but John Bull tucking up his shirtsleeves on the shingle\r\nbeach, ready for a second or a third; crying to them to come on.\r\n\r\nWarmed by his Bullish victory, and friendly to the vanquished, the pork-\r\nbutcher told Skepsey he should like to see more of him, and introduced\r\nhimself on a card Benjamin Shaplow, not far from the Bank.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the Terminus, where three shrieks of an engine, sounding\r\nlike merry messages of the damned to their congeners in the anticipatory\r\nstench of the cab-droppings above, disconnected sane hearing; perverted\r\nit, no doubt.  Or else it was the stamp of a particular name on his mind,\r\nwhich impressed Skepsey, as he bored down the street and across the\r\nbridge, to fancy in recollection, that Mr. Shaplow, when reiterating the\r\nwish for self and friend to witness a display of his cunning with the\r\nfists, had spoken the name of Jarniman.  An unusual name yet more than\r\none Jarniman might well exist.  And unlikely that a friend of the pork-\r\nbutcher would be the person whom Mr. Radnor first prohibited and then\r\ndesired to receive.  It hardly mattered:--considering that the Dutch Navy\r\ndid really, incredible as it seems now, come sailing a good way up the\r\nRiver Thames, into the very main artery of Old England.  And what thought\r\nthe Tower of it?  Skepsey looked at the Tower in sympathy, wondering\r\nwhether the Tower had seen those impudent Dutch a nice people at home,\r\nhe had heard.  Mr. Shaplow's Jarniman might actually be Mr. Radnor's,\r\nhe inclined to think.  At any rate he was now sure of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWHEREIN WE BEHOLD THE COUPLE JUSTIFIED OF LOVE HAVING SIGHT OF THEIR\r\nSCOURGE\r\n\r\nFenellan, in a musing exclamation, that was quite spontaneous, had put a\r\npicture on the departing Skepsey, as observed from an end of the\r\nLakelands upper terrace-walk.\r\n\r\n'Queer little water-wagtail it is!'  And Lady Grace Halley and Miss\r\nGraves and Mrs. Cormyn, snugly silken dry ones, were so taken with the\r\npretty likeness after hearing Victor call the tripping dripping creature\r\nthe happiest man in England, that they nursed it in their minds for a\r\nBewick tailpiece to the chapter of a pleasant rural day.  It imbedded the\r\nday in an idea that it had been rural.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted almost for construction to those who will define us\r\nbriefly: we are but scattered leaves to the general comprehension of us\r\nuntil such a work of binding and labelling is done.  And should the\r\ndefinition be not so correct as brevity pretends to make it at one\r\nstroke, we are at least rendered portable; thus we pass into the\r\nconceptions of our fellows, into the records, down to posterity.\r\nAnecdotes of England's happiest man were related, outlines of his\r\npersonal history requested.  His nomination in chief among the\r\ntraditionally very merry Islanders was hardly borne out by the tale of\r\nhis enchainment with a drunken yokefellow--unless upon the Durance\r\nversion of the felicity of his countrymen; still, the water-wagtail\r\ncarried it, Skepsey trotted into memories.  Heroes conducted up Fame's\r\ntemple-steps by ceremonious historians, who are studious, when the\r\nplatform is reached, of the art of setting them beneath the flambeau\r\nof a final image, before thrusting them inside to be rivetted on their\r\npedestals, have an excellent chance of doing the same, let but the\r\nprovident narrators direct that image to paint the thing a moth-like\r\nhumanity desires, in the thing it shrinks from.  Miss Priscilla Graves\r\nnow fastened her meditations upon Skepsey; and it was important to him.\r\n\r\nTobacco withdrew the haunting shadow of the Rev. Septimus Barmby from\r\nNesta.  She strolled beside Louise de Seilles, to breathe sweet-sweet in\r\nthe dear friend's ear and tell her she loved her.  The presence of the\r\nGerman had, without rousing animosity, damped the young Frenchwoman, even\r\nto a revulsion when her feelings had been touched by hearing praise of\r\nher France, and wounded by the subjects of the praise.  She bore the\r\nnational scar, which is barely skin-clothing of a gash that will not heal\r\nsince her country was overthrown and dismembered.  Colney Durance could\r\nexcuse the unreasonableness in her, for it had a dignity, and she\r\ncontrolled it, and quietly suffered, trusting to the steady, tireless,\r\nconcentrated aim of her France.  In the Gallic mind of our time, France\r\nappears as a prematurely buried Glory, that heaves the mound oppressing\r\nbreath and cannot cease; and calls hourly, at times keenly, to be\r\nremembered, rescued from the pain and the mould-spots of that foul\r\nsepulture.  Mademoiselle and Colney were friends, partly divided by her\r\nspeaking once of revanche; whereupon he assumed the chair of the\r\nMoralist, with its right to lecture, and went over to the enemy; his talk\r\nsavoured of a German.  Our holding of the balance, taking two sides, is\r\nincomprehensible to a people quivering with the double wound to body and\r\nsoul.  She was of Breton blood.  Cymric enough was in Nesta to catch any\r\nthrill from her and join to her mood, if it hung out a colour sad or gay,\r\nand was noble, as any mood of this dear Louise would surely be.\r\n\r\nNataly was not so sympathetic.  Only the Welsh and pure Irish are quick\r\nat the feelings of the Celtic French.  Nataly came of a Yorkshire stock;\r\nshe had the bravery, humaneness and generous temper of our civilized\r\nNorth, and a taste for mademoiselle's fine breeding, with a distaste for\r\nthe singular air of superiority in composure which it was granted to\r\nmademoiselle to wear with an unassailable reserve when the roughness of\r\nthe commercial boor was obtrusive.  She said of her to Colney, as they\r\nwatched the couple strolling by the lake below: 'Nesta brings her out of\r\nher frosts.  I suppose it's the presence of Dr. Schlesien.  I have known\r\nit the same after an evening of Wagner's music.'\r\n\r\n'Richard Wagner Germanized ridicule of the French when they were down,'\r\nsaid Colney.  'She comes of a blood that never forgives.'\r\n\r\n'\"Never forgives\" is horrible to think of!  I fancied you liked your\r\n\"Kelts,\" as you call them.'\r\n\r\nColney seized on a topic that shelved a less agreeable one that he saw\r\ncoming.  'You English won't descend to understand what does not resemble\r\nyou.  The French are in a state of feverish patriotism.  You refuse to\r\ntreat them for a case of fever.  They are lopped of a limb: you tell them\r\nto be at rest!'\r\n\r\n'You know I am fond of them.'\r\n\r\n'And the Kelts, as they are called, can't and won't forgive injuries;\r\nlook at Ireland, look at Wales, and the Keltic Scot.  Have you heard them\r\ntalk?  It happened in the year 1400: it's alive to them as if it were\r\nyesterday.  Old History is as dead to the English as their first father.\r\nThey beg for the privilege of pulling the forelock to the bearers of the\r\ntitles of the men who took their lands from them and turn them to the\r\nuses of cattle.  The Saxon English had, no doubt, a heavier thrashing\r\nthan any people allowed to subsist ever received: you see it to this day;\r\nthe crick of the neck at the name of a lord is now concealed and denied,\r\nbut they have it and betray the effects; and it's patent in their\r\nJournals, all over their literature.  Where it's not seen, another\r\nblood's at work.  The Kelt won't accept the form of slavery.  Let him\r\nbe servile, supple, cunning, treacherous, and to appearance time-serving,\r\nhe will always remember his day of manly independence and who robbed him:\r\nhe is the poetic animal of the races of modern men.'\r\n\r\n'You give him Pagan colours.'\r\n\r\n'Natural colours.  He does not offer the other cheek or turn his back to\r\nbe kicked after a knock to the ground.  Instead of asking him to forgive,\r\nwhich he cannot do, you must teach him to admire.  A mercantile community\r\nguided by Political Economy from the ledger to the banquet presided over\r\nby its Dagon Capital, finds that difficult.  However, there 's the secret\r\nof him; that I respect in him.  His admiration of an enemy or oppressor\r\ndoing great deeds, wins him entirely.  He is an active spirit, not your\r\nnegative passive letter-of-Scripture Insensible.  And his faults, short\r\nof ferocity, are amusing.'\r\n\r\n'But the fits of ferocity!'\r\n\r\n'They are inconscient, real fits.  They come of a hot nerve.  He is\r\nmanageable, sober too, when his mind is charged.  As to the French\r\npeople, they are the most mixed of any European nation; so they are\r\npacked with contrasts: they are full of sentiment, they are sharply\r\nlogical; free-thinkers, devotees; affectionate, ferocious; frivolous,\r\ntenacious; the passion of the season operating like sun or moon on these\r\nqualities; and they can reach to ideality out of sensualism.  Below your\r\nlevel, they're above it: a paradox is at home with them!'\r\n\r\n'My friend, you speak seriously--an unusual compliment,' Nataly said,\r\nand ungratefully continued: 'You know what is occupying me.  I want your\r\nopinion.  I guess it.  I want to hear--a mean thirst perhaps, and you\r\nwould pay me any number of compliments to avoid the subject; but let me\r\nhear:--this house!'\r\n\r\nColney shrugged in resignation.  'Victor works himself out,' he replied.\r\n\r\n'We are to go through it all again?'\r\n\r\n'If you have not the force to contain him.'\r\n\r\n'How contain him?'\r\n\r\nUp went Colney's shoulders.\r\n\r\n'You may see it all before you,' he said, 'straight as the Seine chaussee\r\nfrom the hill of La Roche Guyon.'\r\n\r\nHe looked for her recollection of the scene.\r\n\r\n'Ah, the happy ramble that year!' she cried.  'And my Nesta just seven.\r\nWe had been six months at Craye.  Every day of our life together looks\r\nhappy to me, looking back, though I know that every day had the same\r\ntroubles.  I don't think I'm deficient in courage; I think I could meet\r\n....  But the false position so cruelly weakens me.  I am no woman's\r\nequal when I have to receive or visit.  It seems easier to meet the worst\r\nin life-danger, death, anything.  Pardon me for talking so.  Perhaps we\r\nneed not have left Craye or Creckholt .  .  . ?' she hinted an\r\ninterrogation.  'Though I am not sorry; it is not good to be where one\r\ntastes poison.  Here it may be as deadly, worse.  Dear friend, I am so\r\nglad you remember La Roche Guyon.  He was popular with the dear French\r\npeople.'\r\n\r\n'In spite of his accent.'\r\n\r\n'It is not so bad?'\r\n\r\n'And that you'll defend!'\r\n\r\n'Consider: these neighbours we come among; they may have heard .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Act on the assumption.'\r\n\r\n'You forget the principal character.  Victor promises; he may have learnt\r\na lesson at Creckholt.  But look at this house he has built.  How can I--\r\nany woman--contain him!  He must have society.'\r\n\r\n'Paraitre!'\r\n\r\n'He must be in the front.  He has talked of Parliament.'\r\n\r\nColney's liver took the thrust of a skewer through it.  He spoke as in\r\nmeditative encomium: 'His entry into Parliament would promote himself and\r\nfamily to a station of eminence naked over the Clock Tower of the House.'\r\n\r\nShe moaned.  'At the vilest, I cannot regret my conduct--bear what I may.\r\nI can bear real pain: what kills me is, the suspicion.  And I feel it\r\nlike a guilty wretch!  And I do not feel the guilt!  I should do the same\r\nagain, on reflection.  I do believe it saved him.  I do; oh!  I do, I do.\r\nI cannot expect my family to see with my eyes.  You know them--my brother\r\nand sisters think I have disgraced them; they put no value on my saving\r\nhim.  It sounds childish; it is true.  He had fallen into a terrible\r\nblack mood.'\r\n\r\n'He had an hour of gloom.'\r\n\r\n'An hour!'\r\n\r\n'But an hour, with him!  It means a good deal.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, friend, I take your words.  He sinks terribly when he sinks at all.\r\n--Spare us a little while.--We have to judge of what is good in the\r\ncircumstances: I hear your reply!  But the principal for me to study is\r\nVictor.  You have accused me of being the voice of the enamoured woman.\r\nI follow him, I know; I try to advise; I find it is wisdom to submit.\r\nMy people regard my behaviour as a wickedness or a madness.  I did save\r\nhim.  I joined my fate with his.  I am his mate, to help, and I cannot\r\noppose him, to distract him.  I do my utmost for privacy. He must\r\nentertain.  Believe me, I feel for them--sisters and brother.  And now\r\nthat my sisters are married .  .  . My brother has a man's hardness.'\r\n\r\n'Colonel Dreighton did not speak harshly, at our last meeting.'\r\n\r\n'He spoke of me?'\r\n\r\n'He spoke in the tone of a brother.'\r\n\r\n'Victor promises--I won't repeat it.  Yes, I see the house!  There\r\nappears to be a prospect, a hope--I cannot allude to it.  Craye and\r\nCreckholt may have been some lesson to him.  Selwyn spoke of me kindly?\r\nAh, yes, it is the way with my people to pretend that Victor has been the\r\nruin of me, that they may come round to family sentiments.  In the same\r\nway, his relatives, the Duvidney ladies, have their picture of the woman\r\nmisleading him.  Imagine me the naughty adventuress!'--Nataly falsified\r\nthe thought insurgent at her heart, in adding: 'I do not say I am\r\nblameless.'  It was a concession to the circumambient enemy, of whom even\r\na good friend was apart, and not better than a respectful emissary.  The\r\ndearest of her friends belonged to that hostile world.  Only Victor, no\r\nother, stood with her against the world.  Her child, yes; the love of her\r\nchild she had; but the child's destiny was an alien phantom, looking at\r\nher with harder eyes than she had vision of in her family.  She did not\r\nsay she was blameless, did not affect the thought.  She would have wished\r\nto say, for small encouragement she would have said, that her case could\r\nbe pleaded.\r\n\r\nColney's features were not inviting, though the expression was not\r\nrepellent.  She sighed deeply; and to count on something helpful by\r\nmentioning it, reverted to the 'prospect' which there appeared to be.\r\n'Victor speaks of the certainty of his release.'\r\n\r\nHis release!  Her language pricked a satirist's gallbladder.  Colney\r\nrefrained from speaking to wound, and enjoyed a silence that did it.\r\n\r\n'Do you see any possibility?--you knew her,' she said coldly.\r\n\r\n'Counting the number of times he has been expecting the release, he is\r\nbound to believe it near at hand.'\r\n\r\n'You don't?' she asked: her bosom was up in a crisis of expectation for\r\nthe answer: and on a pause of half-a-minute, she could have uttered the\r\nanswer herself.\r\n\r\nHe perceived the insane eagerness through her mask, and despised it,\r\npitying the woman.  'And you don't,' he said.  'You catch at delusions,\r\nto excuse the steps you consent to take.  Or you want me to wear the\r\nblinkers, the better to hoodwink your own eyes.  You see it as well as I:\r\nIf you enter that house, you have to go through the same as at\r\nCreckholt:--and he'll be the first to take fright.'\r\n\r\n'He finds you in tears: he is immensely devoted; he flings up all to\r\nprotect \"his Nataly.\"'\r\n\r\n'No: you are unjust to him.  He would fling up all:'--\r\n\r\n'But his Nataly prefers to be dragged through fire?  As you please!'\r\n\r\nShe bowed to her chastisement.  One motive in her consultation with him\r\ncame of the knowledge of his capacity to inflict it and his honesty in\r\nthe act, and a thirst she had to hear the truth loud-tongued from him;\r\ntogether with a feeling that he was excessive and satiric, not to be read\r\nby the letter of his words: and in consequence, she could bear the lash\r\nfrom him, and tell her soul that he overdid it, and have an unjustly-\r\ntreated self to cherish.--But in very truth she was a woman who loved to\r\nhear the truth; she was formed to love the truth her position reduced her\r\nto violate; she esteemed the hearing it as medical to her; she selected\r\nfor counsellor him who would apply it: so far she went on the straight\r\nway; and the desire for a sustaining deception from the mouth of a\r\ntrustworthy man set her hanging on his utterances with an anxious hope of\r\nthe reverse of what was to come and what she herself apprehended, such as\r\nchecked her pulses and iced her feet and fingers.  The reason being, not\r\nthat she was craven or absurd or paradoxical, but that, living at an\r\nintenser strain upon her nature than she or any around her knew, her\r\nstrength snapped, she broke down by chance there where Colney was\r\nrendered spiteful in beholding the display of her inconsequent if not\r\npuling sex.\r\n\r\nShe might have sought his counsel on another subject, if a paralyzing\r\nchill of her frame in the foreview of it had allowed her to speak: she\r\nfelt grave alarms in one direction, where Nesta stood in the eye of her\r\nfather; besides an unformed dread that the simplicity in generosity of\r\nVictor's nature was doomed to show signs of dross ultimately, under the\r\nnecessity he imposed upon himself to run out his forecasts, and scheme,\r\nand defensively compel the world to serve his ends, for the protection of\r\nthose dear to him.\r\n\r\nAt night he was particularly urgent with her for the harmonious duet in\r\npraise of Lakelands; and plied her with questions all round and about it,\r\nto bring out the dulcet accord.  He dwelt on his choice of costly\r\nmarbles, his fireplace and mantelpiece designs, the great hall, and\r\nsuggestions for imposing and beautiful furniture; concordantly enough,\r\nfor the large, the lofty and rich of colour won her enthusiasm; but\r\noverwhelmingly to any mood of resistance; and strangely in a man who had\r\nof late been adopting, as if his own, a modern tone, or the social and\r\nliterary hints of it, relating to the right uses of wealth, and the duty\r\nas well as the delight of living simply.\r\n\r\n'Fredi was pleased.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she was, dear.'\r\n\r\n'She is our girl, my love.  \"I could live and die here!\"  Live, she may.\r\nThere's room enough.'\r\n\r\nNataly saw the door of a covert communication pointed at in that remark.\r\nShe gathered herself for an effort to do battle.\r\n\r\n'She's quite a child, Victor.'\r\n\r\n'The time begins to run.  We have to look forward now:--I declare, it's\r\nI who seem the provident mother for Fredi!'\r\n\r\n'Let our girl wait; don't hurry her mind to .  .  .  She is happy with\r\nher father and mother.  She is in the happiest time of her life, before\r\nthose feelings distract.'\r\n\r\n'If we see good fortune for her, we can't let it pass her.'\r\n\r\nA pang of the resolution now to debate the case with Victor, which would\r\nbe of necessity to do the avoided thing and roll up the forbidden curtain\r\nopening on their whole history past and prospective, was met in Nataly's\r\nbosom by the more bitter immediate confession that she was not his match.\r\nTo speak would be to succumb; and shamefully after the effort; and\r\nhopelessly after being overborne by him.  There was not the anticipation\r\nof a set contest to animate the woman's naturally valiant heart; he was\r\ntoo strong: and his vividness in urgency overcame her in advance,\r\nfascinated her sensibility through recollection; he fanned an\r\ninclination, lighted it to make it a passion, a frenzied resolve--she\r\nremembered how and when.  She had quivering cause to remember the fateful\r\nday of her step, in a letter received that morning from a married sister,\r\ncontaining no word of endearment or proposal for a meeting.  An\r\nunregretted day, if Victor would think of the dues to others; that is,\r\nwould take station with the world to see his reflected position, instead\r\nof seeing it through their self-justifying knowledge of the honourable\r\ntruth of their love, and pressing to claim and snatch at whatsoever the\r\nworld bestows on its orderly subjects.\r\n\r\nThey had done evil to no one as yet.  Nataly thought that; not-\r\nwithstanding the outcry of the ancient and withered woman who bore\r\nVictor Radnor's name: for whom, in consequence of the rod the woman had\r\nused, this tenderest of hearts could summon no emotion.  If she had it,\r\nthe thing was not to be hauled up to consciousness.  Her feeling was,\r\nthat she forgave the wrinkled Malignity: pity and contrition dissolving\r\nin the effort to produce the placable forgiveness.  She was frigid\r\nbecause she knew rightly of herself, that she in the place of power would\r\nnever have struck so meanly.  But the mainspring of the feeling in an\r\nalmost remorseless bosom drew from certain chance expressions of\r\nretrospective physical distaste on Victor's part;--hard to keep from a\r\nshort utterance between the nuptial two, of whom the unshamed exuberant\r\nmale has found the sweet reverse in his mate, a haven of heavenliness,\r\nto delight in:--these conjoined with a woman's unspoken pleading ideas\r\nof her own, on her own behalf, had armed her jealously in vindication\r\nof Nature.\r\n\r\nNow, as long as they did no palpable wrong about them, Nataly could argue\r\nher case in her conscience--deep down and out of hearing, where women\r\nunder scourge of the laws they have not helped decree may and do deliver\r\ntheir minds.  She stood in that subterranean recess for Nature against\r\nthe Institutions of Man: a woman little adapted for the post of revel;\r\nbut to this, by the agency of circumstances, it had come; she who was\r\ndesigned by nature to be an ornament of those Institutions opposed them\r\nand when thinking of the rights and the conduct of the decrepit\r\nLegitimate--virulent in a heathen vindictiveness declaring itself holy--\r\nshe had Nature's logic, Nature's voice, for self-defence.  It was\r\neloquent with her, to the deafening of other voices in herself, even to\r\nthe convincing of herself, when she was wrought by the fires within to\r\nfeel elementally.  The other voices within her issued of the acknowledged\r\ndues to her family and to the world--the civilization protecting women:\r\nsentences thereanent in modern books and Journals.  But the remembrance\r\nof moods of fiery exaltation, when the Nature she called by name of Love\r\nraised the chorus within to stop all outer buzzing, was, in a perpetual\r\nstruggle with a whirlpool, a constant support while she and Victor were\r\none at heart.  The sense of her standing alone made her sway; and a\r\nthought of differences with him caused frightful apprehensions of the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nLuxuriously she applied to his public life for witness that he had\r\ngoverned wisely as well as affectionately so long; and he might\r\ntherefore, with the chorussing of the world of public men, expect a woman\r\nblindfold to follow his lead.  But no; we may be rebels against our time\r\nand its Laws: if we are really for Nature, we are not lawless.  Nataly's\r\nuntutored scruples, which came side by side with her ability to plead for\r\nher acts, restrained her from complicity in the ensnaring of a young man\r\nof social rank to espouse the daughter of a couple socially insurgent-\r\nstained, to common thinking, should denunciation come.  The Nature\r\nupholding her fled at a vision of a stranger entangled.  Pitiable to\r\nreflect, that he was not one of the adventurer-lords of prey who hunt\r\nand run down shadowed heiresses and are congratulated on their luck in a\r\ntolerating country!  How was the young man to be warned?  How, under the\r\nhappiest of suppositions, propitiate his family!  And such a family,\r\nif consenting with knowledge, would consent only for the love of money.\r\nIt was angling with as vile a bait as the rascal lord's.  Humiliation\r\nhung on the scheme; it struck to scorching in the contemplation of it.\r\nAnd it darkened her reading of Victor's character.\r\n\r\nShe did not ask for the specification of a 'good fortune that might\r\npass'; wishing to save him from his wonted twists of elusiveness, and\r\nherself with him from the dread discussion it involved upon one point.\r\n\r\n'The day was pleasant to all, except perhaps poor mademoiselle,' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'Peridon should have come?'\r\n\r\n'Present or absent, his chances are not brilliant, I fear.'\r\n\r\n'And Pempton and Priscy!'\r\n\r\n'They are growing cooler!'\r\n\r\n'With their grotesque objections to one another's habits at table!'\r\n\r\n'Can we ever hope to get them over it?'\r\n\r\n'When Priscy drinks Port and Pempton munches beef, Colney says.'\r\n\r\n'I should say, when they feel warmly enough to think little of their\r\ndifferences.'\r\n\r\n'Fire smoothes the creases, yes; and fire is what they're both wanting\r\nin.  Though Priscy has Concert-pathos in her voice:--couldn't act a bit!\r\nAnd Pempton's 'cello tones now and then have gone through me--simply from\r\nhis fiddle-bow, I believe.  Don't talk to me of feeling in a couple,\r\nwithin reach of one another and sniffing objections.--Good, then, for a\r\nsuccessful day to-day so far?'\r\n\r\nHe neared her, wooing her; and she assented, with a franker smile than\r\nshe had worn through the day.\r\n\r\nThe common burden on their hearts--the simple discussion to come of the\r\ntask of communicating dire actualities to their innocent Nesta--was laid\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\nAdmiration of an enemy or oppressor doing great deeds\r\nAristocratic assumption of licence\r\nBut what is it we do (excepting cricket, of course)\r\nConsent of circumstances\r\nContinued trust in the man--is the alternative of despair\r\nCritical fashion of intimates who know as well as hear\r\nDespises hostile elements and goes unpunished\r\nDithyrambic inebriety of narration\r\nFeminine; coming when she willed and flying when wanted\r\nFire smoothes the creases\r\nFrankness as an armour over wariness\r\nHalf a dozen dozen left\r\nHard to bear, at times unbearable\r\nHaremed opinion of the unfitness of women\r\nHe neared her, wooing her; and she assented\r\nHe never acknowledged a trouble, he dispersed it\r\nHe prattled, in the happy ignorance of compulsion\r\nHe sinks terribly when he sinks at all\r\nHeathen vindictiveness declaring itself holy\r\nIf we are really for Nature, we are not lawless\r\nIn bottle if not on draught (oratory)\r\nIn the pay of our doctors\r\nIntrusion of hard material statements, facts\r\nKelts, as they are called, can't and won't forgive injuries\r\nMan with a material object in aim, is the man of his object\r\nNature and Law never agreed\r\nNature's logic, Nature's voice, for self-defence\r\nNext door to the Last Trump\r\nObeseness is the most sensitive of our ailments\r\nOnce out of the rutted line, you are food for lion and jackal\r\nOne wants a little animation in a husband\r\nPeople of a provocative prosperity\r\nSelf-deceiver may be a persuasive deceiver of another\r\nShe was not his match--To speak would be to succumb\r\nSlap and pinch and starve our appetites\r\nSmallest of our gratifications in life could give a happy tone\r\nSmothered in its pudding-bed of the grotesque (obesity)\r\nSnuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer\r\nState of feverish patriotism\r\nStatistics are according to their conjurors\r\nSubterranean recess for Nature against the Institutions of Man\r\nTale, which leaves the man's mind at home\r\nThe effects of the infinitely little\r\nThe old confession, that we cannot cook(The English)\r\nThey do not live; they are engines\r\nThey helped her to feel at home with herself\r\nThought of differences with him caused frightful apprehensions\r\nUnshamed exuberant male has found the sweet reverse in his mate\r\nWe cannot relinquish an idea that was ours\r\nWe've all a parlous lot too much pulpit in us\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]",
