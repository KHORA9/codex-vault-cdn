HUBBARD BROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe public favor with which the journalistic writings of the\r\nsubscriber have been received prompted the publication of these\r\nvolumes.  Their object is to give personal details concerning\r\nprominent men and women in social and political life at the National\r\nMetropolis since he has known it.  He has especially endeavored to\r\nportray those who \"in Congress assembled\" have enacted the laws,\r\nand those who have interpreted and enforced the provisions under\r\nwhich the United States has advanced, during the past sixty years,\r\nfrom comparative infancy into the vigor of mature manhood, and has\r\nsuccessfully defended its own life against a vigorous attempt at\r\nits destruction.\r\n\r\nIn chronicling what has transpired within his personal recollection\r\nat the National Metropolis, he has gathered what \"waifs\" he has\r\nfound floating on the sea of chat, in the whirlpools of gossip, or\r\nin the quiet havens of conversation.  Some of these may be personal\r\n--piquantly personal, perhaps--but the mighty public has had an\r\nappetite for gossipings about prominent men and measures ever since\r\nthe time when the old Athenians crowded to hear the plays of\r\nAristophanes.\r\n\r\nThe subscriber is aware that some who write of prominent persons\r\nand political events indulge too much in sycophantic flattery,\r\nwhile others have their brains addled by brooding on some fancied\r\nwrong, or their minds have lost their even poise by dwelling on\r\ninsane reforms or visionary projects.  All this may have its use,\r\nbut the subscriber has preferred to look at things in a more cheerful\r\nway, to pluck roses rather than nettles, and neither to throw filth\r\nnor to blow trumpets.\r\n\r\nWhile the Republic has preserved with commendable pride the histories\r\nof her statesmen and her martial defenders, it is well that the\r\nmemories of those of the gentler sex, who have from time to time\r\ntaken prominent part in shaping the destinies of the nation, should\r\nalso be remembered.  This work will give, it is hoped, an idea of stirring\r\nevents in both political and social life, of the great men and the\r\nfascinating women who have figured in Washington during the past\r\nsix decades.  Those who were too well acquainted with these personal\r\ndetails to think of recording them are fast passing away, and some\r\naccount of them cannot but interest younger generations, while it\r\nwill not fail to profit the older politicians, publicists, and\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty in the compilation of the \"Reminiscences\" has\r\nbeen the selection from the masses of material accumulated in\r\ndiaries, autograph letters, and scrap-books containing published\r\nliterary matter.  To have given a connected political and social\r\nhistory of what has transpired at the National Metropolis during\r\nthe past sixty years would have required a dozen volumes, so the\r\nmost conspicuous features only have been here and there selected.\r\n\r\nConfident of the exact truthfulness of the sketches here given,\r\nthis work is presented, without apologies, to a generous public as\r\nthe result of very extensive observation.\r\n\r\n  BEN: PERLEY POORE.\r\n  INDIAN HILL FARM,\r\n  Near Newburyport, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS BECOMES PRESIDENT.\r\nThe Tenth Presidential Election--A Political Bargain--Election of\r\nPresident--A Scene in the House--Inauguration of J.

I.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS BECOMES PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams was elected President of the United States by\r\nthe House of Representatives on February 9th, 1825.  At the tenth\r\npopular election for President, during the previous autumn, there\r\nhad been four candidates:  Andrew Jackson, then a Senator from\r\nTennessee, who received ninety-nine electoral votes; John Quincy\r\nAdams, of Massachusetts, then Secretary of State under President\r\nMonroe, who received eighty-four electoral votes; William H.\r\nCrawford, of Georgia, then Secretary of the Treasury, who received\r\nforty-one electoral votes, and Henry Clay, of Kentucky, then Speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives, who received thirty-seven electoral\r\nvotes--in all two hundred and sixty-one electoral votes.  As neither\r\ncandidate had received the requisite majority of one hundred and\r\nthirty-one electoral votes, the election of a President devolved\r\nupon the House of Representatives, in which body each State would\r\nhave one vote.  As the Constitution required that the choice of the\r\nHouse be confined to the three highest candidates on the list of those\r\nvoted for by the electors, and as Mr. Clay was not one of the three,\r\nhe was excluded.  Exercising, as he did, great control over his\r\nsupporters, it was within his power to transfer their strength to\r\neither Adams or Jackson, thus deciding the election.  The Legislature\r\nof his State, Kentucky, had to a certain degree instructed him, by\r\npassing a joint resolution declaring its preference for Jackson over Adams,\r\nand Jackson always believed that had he accepted overtures made to\r\nhim, for the promise of the Department of State to Mr. Clay, that\r\nwould have insured his election.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay decided, however, to request his friends to support Mr.\r\nAdams.  To one of them he wrote:  \"Mr. Adams, you well know, I\r\nshould never have selected if at liberty to draw from the whole\r\nmass of our citizens for a President.  But there is no danger of\r\nhis election now or in time to come.  Not so of his competitor, of\r\nwhom I cannot believe that killing two thousand five hundred\r\nEnglishmen at New Orleans qualifies for the various, difficult,\r\nand complicated duties of the Chief Magistracy.\"  Many believed,\r\nhowever, that a bargain was made between Adams and Clay by which\r\nthe latter received, as a consideration for transferring to the\r\nformer the votes of Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, the position of\r\nSecretary of State.  The charge was distinctly made by Mr. George\r\nKremer, a Representative from Pennsylvania, and as positively denied\r\nby Mr. Clay.  General Jackson wrote to Major Lewis:  \"So, you see,\r\nthe Judas of the West has closed the contract and will receive the\r\nthirty pieces of silver.  His end will be the same.  Was there ever\r\nwitnessed such a barefaced corruption in any country before?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate and the House of Representatives met in joint\r\nconvention to count the electoral votes it was found (as every one\r\npresent had known for months) that no one had received the requisite\r\nmajority.  This was formally announced by Vice-President Daniel D.\r\nTompkins, who also declared that John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina,\r\nhad been elected Vice-President.  The Senate, headed by the Vice-\r\nPresident and its Secretary, Charles Cutts, then retired, and the\r\nHouse proceeded to ballot for President.\r\n\r\nThe election was by States.  Each State delegation appointed one\r\nof their number to act as chairman, collect their votes, and report\r\nthe result.  Whoever in each delegation received the most votes\r\nwas reported as the choice of that delegation to the tellers--one\r\nfrom each State--who sat in parties of twelve at two tables.  Daniel\r\nWebster, the teller of Massachusetts, was appointed by the tellers\r\nat one of the tables to announce the result of the ballot, and John\r\nRandolph, the teller of Virginia, was appointed to the same service\r\nat the other table.  The votes of most of the States were matters\r\nof confident calculation, but those of others were in some degree\r\ndoubtful, and there was intense interest manifested as their votes\r\nwere counted.  At last, when the twenty-four States had voted, Mr.\r\nWebster announced, in his deep voice, that thirteen States had\r\nvoted for John Quincy Adams, seven States had voted for Andrew\r\nJackson, and four States had voted for William H. Crawford.  Mr.\r\nSpeaker Clay then announced, in sonorous tones:  \"John Quincy Adams,\r\nhaving received a majority of the votes cast, is duly elected\r\nPresident of the United States for four years, from the 4th of\r\nMarch next ensuing.\"\r\n\r\nA shout arose from the occupants of the galleries, which Mr. McDuffie\r\npromptly asked might be cleared.  The vote was carried, and a young\r\nman, who was Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms, mounting to the broad stone\r\ncornice, which ran around the hall outside of the floor of the\r\ngalleries, but on a level with them, exclaimed, as he walked along:\r\n\"The Speaker orders the galleries to be cleared; all must retire.\r\nClear the galleries!\"  The command was obeyed, to the astonishment\r\nof some of the foreign ministers present, who had been accustomed\r\nto see armed guards at such assemblages, and often to witness their\r\nunsuccessful attempts to move the populace.  The House soon afterward\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\nThat evening President Monroe gave a public reception at the White\r\nHouse, which had just been rebuilt after having been burned by the\r\nBritish army--in 1814.  The two candidates, Mr. Adams, the elect,\r\nand General Jackson, the defeated, accidentally met in the East\r\nRoom.  General Jackson, who was escorting a lady, promptly extended\r\nhis hand, saying pleasantly:  \"How do you do, Mr. Adams?  I give\r\nyou my left hand, for the right, as you see, is devoted to the\r\nfair.  I hope you are very well, sir.\"  All this was gallantly and\r\nheartily said and done.  Mr. Adams took the General's hand, and\r\nsaid, with chilling coldness:  \"Very well, sir; I hope General\r\nJackson is well!\"  The military hero was genial and gracious, while\r\nthe unamiable diplomat was as cold as an iceberg.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of Mr. Adams, on the 4th of March, 1825, was the\r\nmost imposing demonstration ever witnessed at Washington up to that\r\ntime.  President Monroe called for his successor and they rode\r\ntogether to the Capitol, escorted by the District uniformed militia\r\nand by a cavalcade of citizens marshaled by Daniel Carroll, of\r\nDuddington, General John Mason, General Walter Smith, and General\r\nWalter Jones, four prominent residents.  On reaching the Capitol\r\nthe President-elect was received with military honors by a battalion\r\nof the Marine Corps.  He was then escorted by a committee of Senators\r\nto the Senate Chamber, where the oath of office was administered\r\nto the Vice-President-elect, John C. Calhoun.  The dignitaries\r\npresent then moved in procession to the hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on the floor of which were the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps, officers\r\nof the army and navy, and many prominent officials, while the\r\ngalleries were filled with handsomely dressed ladies and gentlemen.\r\nMr. Adams read his inaugural address from the Speaker's desk, after\r\nwhich the oath of office was administered to him by Chief Justice\r\nMarshall.  Salutes were fired from the Navy Yard and the Arsenal,\r\nand the new President was escorted to his house, on F Street, where\r\nhe that evening received his friends, for whom generous supplies\r\nof punch and wines were hospitably provided.\r\n\r\nPresident Adams, although at heart instigated by a Puritan intolerance\r\nof those who had failed to conform with himself, was a true patriot,\r\nand as a public man was moved by the highest moral motives.  He\r\nwas a great statesman in so far as the comprehension of the principles\r\nof government and a mastery of a wide field of information were\r\nconcerned, but he could not practically apply his knowledge.\r\nInstead of harmonizing the personal feuds between the friends of\r\nthose who had been candidates with him, he antagonized each one\r\nwith his Administration at the earliest possible moment, and before\r\nthe expiration of his first year in the White House he had wrecked\r\nthe Republican party left by Monroe, as completely as his father\r\nhad wrecked the Federal party established by Washington.\r\n\r\nThe President, when in London, had married Miss Louisa Catherine\r\nJohnson.  Her father was an American by birth, but just before the\r\nRevolution he went to England, where he resided until after the\r\nindependence of the Colonies had been recognized.  Mrs. Adams was\r\nwell educated, highly accomplished, and well qualified to preside\r\nover the domestic affairs at the White House.  She had four children\r\n--three sons and one daughter--of whom one only, Mr. Charles Francis\r\nAdams, survived her.  It is related, as evidence of her good sense,\r\nthat on one occasion Mrs. Mason, of Analostan Island, called,\r\naccompanied by two or three other ladies belonging to the first\r\nfamilies of Virginia, to enlist Mrs. Adams in behalf of her son-in-\r\nlaw, Lieutenant Cooper (afterward Adjutant-General of the United\r\nStates Army, and subsequently of the Confederate forces), who wanted\r\nto be detailed as an aide-de-camp on the staff of General Macomb.\r\nMrs. Adams heard their request and then replied:  \"Truly, ladies,\r\nthough Madames Maintenon and Pompadour are said to have controlled\r\nthe military appointments of their times, I do not think such\r\nmatters appertain to women; but if they did and I had any influence\r\nwith Mr. Adams, it should be given to Mrs. Scott, with whom I became\r\nacquainted while traveling last summer.\"\r\n&&&\r\nMr. Adams' private secretary was his son, John Adams, who soon made\r\nhimself very obnoxious to the friends of General Jackson.  One\r\nevening Mr. Russell Jarvis, who then edited the Washington _Telegraph_,\r\na newspaper which advocated Jackson's election, attended a \"drawing\r\nroom\" at the White House, escorting his wife and a party of visiting\r\nrelatives from Boston.  Mr. Jarvis introduced them courteously,\r\nand they then passed on into the East Room.  Soon afterward they\r\nfound themselves standing opposite to Mr. John Adams, who was\r\nconversing with the Rev. Mr. Stetson.  \"Who is that lady?\" asked\r\nMr. Stetson.  \"That,\" replied Mr. John Adams, in a tone so loud\r\nthat the party heard it, \"is the wife of one Russell Jarvis, and\r\nif he knew how contemptibly he is viewed in this house they would\r\nnot be here.\"  The Bostonians at once paid their respects to Mrs.\r\nAdams and withdrew, Mr. Jarvis having first ascertained from Mr.\r\nStetson that it was Mr. John Adams who had insulted them.  A few\r\ndays afterward Mr. Jarvis sent a note to Mr. John Adams, demanding\r\nan explanation, by a friend of his, Mr. McLean.  Mr. Adams told\r\nMr. McLean that he had no apology to make to Mr. Jarvis, and that\r\nhe wished no correspondence with him.\r\n\r\nA week later Mr. John Adams went to the Capitol to deliver messages\r\nfrom the President to each house of Congress.  Having delivered\r\nthat addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, he\r\nwas going through the rotunda toward the Senate Chamber, when he\r\nwas overtaken by Mr. Jarvis, who pulled his nose and slapped his\r\nface.  A scuffle ensued, but they were quickly parted by Mr. Dorsey,\r\na Representative from Maryland.  President Adams notified Congress\r\nin a special message of the occurrence, and the House appointed a\r\nselect committee of investigation.  Witnesses were examined and\r\nelaborate reports were drawn up, but neither the majority nor the\r\nminority recommended that any punishment be inflicted upon Mr.\r\nJarvis.\r\n\r\nMr. John Adams was married, while his father occupied the White\r\nHouse, to his mother's niece, Miss Mary Hellen, of Washington.\r\nThe ceremony was performed by Rev. Dr. Hawley, of St. John's Church,\r\nand General Ramsey, who was one of the groomsmen, is authority for\r\nthe statement that the President, usually so grave and unsocial,\r\nunbent for the nonce, and danced at the wedding ball in a Virginia\r\nreel with great spirit.\r\n\r\nThe foreign diplomats were recognized as leaders in Washington\r\nsociety, and one of the Secretaries of Legation created a sensation\r\nby appearing on Pennsylvania Avenue mounted on a velocipede imported\r\nfrom London.  Pennsylvania Avenue was then bordered with scraggy\r\npoplar trees, which had been planted under the direction of President\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams found the furniture of the White House in a dilapidated\r\ncondition.  Thirty thousand dollars had been appropriated by Congress\r\nfor the purchase of new furniture during the Administration of Mr.\r\nMonroe; but his friend, Colonel Lane, Commissioner of Public\r\nBuildings, to whom he had intrusted it, became insolvent, and died\r\nlargely in debt to the Government, having used the money for the\r\npayment of his debts, instead of procuring furniture.  When a\r\nappropriation of fourteen thousand dollars was made, to be expended\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Adams, for furniture, he took charge of\r\nit himself.  This was severely criticised by the Democratic press,\r\nas was the purchase of a billiard table for the White House, about\r\nwhich so much was said that Mr. John Adams finally paid the bill\r\nfrom his own pocket.\r\n\r\nMrs. Adams won popularity at Washington by the graceful manner in\r\nwhich she presided over the hospitalities of the White House.  The\r\nstiff formalities of the \"drawing-rooms\" of Mrs. Washington and\r\nMrs. John Adams, and the free-and-easy \"receptions\" of Mr. Jefferson's\r\ndaughters, had been combined by Mrs. Madison into what she christened\r\n\"levees\", at which all ceremonious etiquette was banished.  Mrs.\r\nMonroe, who had mingled in the fashionable circles of London and\r\nParis, as well as of her native city of New York, had continued\r\nthese evening \"levees,\" and Mrs. Adams, in turn, not only kept up\r\nthe custom, but improved the quality of the refreshments, which\r\nwere handed around on waiters by servants.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams used to rise between four and six o'clock, according to\r\nthe season, and either take a ride on horseback or walk to the\r\nPotomac River, where he bathed, remaining in the water for an hour\r\nor more in the summer.  Returning to the White House, he read two\r\nchapters of the Bible and then glanced over the morning papers\r\nuntil nine, when he breakfasted.  From ten until four he remained\r\nin the Executive Office, presiding over Cabinet meetings, receiving\r\nvisitors, or considering questions of state.  Then, after a long\r\nwalk, or a short ride on horseback, he would sit down to dine at\r\nhalf-past five, and after dinner resume his public duties.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Mr. Adams imperiled his life by attempting to cross\r\nthe Potomac in a small boat, accompanied by his son John and by\r\nhis steward, Michael Antoine Ginsta, who had entered his service\r\nat Amsterdam in 1814.  Intending to swim back, they had taken off\r\nnearly all of their clothes, which were in the boat.  When about\r\nhalf-way across, a gust of wind came sweeping down the Potomac,\r\nthe boat filled with water, and they were forced to abandon it and\r\nswim for their lives to the Virginia Shore.  By taking what garments\r\neach one had on, Antoine managed to clothe himself decently, and\r\nstarted across the bridge to Washington.  During his absence, Mr.\r\nAdams and his son swam in the river, or walked to and fro on the\r\nshore.  At last, after they had been about three hours undressed,\r\nAntoine made his appearance with a carriage and clothing, so they\r\nwere able to return to Washington.  Mr. Adams purchased that day\r\na watch, which he gave Antoine to replace one which he had lost in\r\nthe boat and alluded to the adventure in his journal that night as\r\n\"a humiliating lesson and a solemn warning not to trifle with\r\ndanger.\"  A few weeks later a Revolutionary veteran named Shoemaker,\r\nwent in to bathe at Mr. Adams' favorite spot, the Sycamores, was\r\nseized with cramp, and was drowned.  The body was not recovered\r\nuntil the next morning while Mr. Adams was in the water; but the\r\nincident did not deter him from taking his solitary morning baths,\r\nwhich he regarded as indispensable to health.  Mr. Adams took great\r\ninterest in arboriculture, and was a constant reader of Evelyn.\r\nHe had planted in the grounds of the White House the acorns of the\r\ncork-oak, black walnuts, peach, plum, and cherry stones, apple and\r\npear seeds, and he watched their germination and growth with great\r\ninterest.  A botanic garden was established under his patronage,\r\nand naval officers were instructed to bring home for distribution\r\nthe seeds of such grains and vegetables as it might seem desirable\r\nto naturalize.  The seeds thus collected were carefully distributed\r\nthrough members of Congress, and several important varieties of\r\nvegetables were thus introduced.  Down to the present day the yearly\r\ndistribution of seeds to rural communities is an important item of\r\nCongressional duty.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was the _premier_ and the most important member of Mr.\r\nAdams' cabinet.  He evidently regarded the Department of State as\r\na stepping-stone to the Executive Mansion, and hoped that he would\r\nbe in time promoted, as Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy\r\nAdams.  The foreign policy of the Administration, which encouraged\r\nthe appointment of a Minister to represent the United States in\r\nthe Congress of American Republics at Panama, although in accordance\r\nwith the \"Monroe Doctrine,\" was denounced as Federalism.  Mr. Clay,\r\nwho had never been a Federalist, did not wish to be regarded as a\r\nrestorer of the old Federal party, and he accordingly began to\r\ncreate the Whig party, of which he naturally became the leader.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay made a good Secretary of State, but his place was in\r\nCongress, for he was formed by nature for a popular orator.  He\r\nwas tall and thin, with a rather small head, and gray eyes, which\r\npeered forth less luminously than would have been expected in one\r\npossessing such eminent control of language.  His nose was straight,\r\nhis upper lip long, and his under jaw light.  His mouth, of generous\r\nwidth, straight when he was silent, and curving upward at the\r\ncorners as he spoke or smiled, was singularly graceful, indicating\r\nmore than any other feature the elastic play of his mind.  When he\r\nenchained large audiences, his features were lighted up by a winning\r\nsmile, the gestures of his long arms were graceful, and the gentle\r\naccents of his mellow voice were persuasive and winning.  Yet there\r\nhas never been a more imperious despot in political affairs than\r\nMr. Clay.  He regarded himself as the head-centre of his party--\r\n_L'etat, c'est moi_--and he wanted everything utilized for his\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was meanwhile being brought before the public,\r\nunder the direction of Aaron Burr, Martin Van Buren, and Edward\r\nLivingston, as a \"man of the people.\"  They had persuaded him to\r\nresign his seat in the Senate of the United States, where he might\r\nhave made political mistakes, and retire to his farm in Tennessee,\r\nwhile they flooded the country with accounts of his military exploits\r\nand his social good qualities.  Daniel Webster told Samuel Breck,\r\nas the latter records in his diary, that he knew more than fifty\r\nmembers of Congress who had expended and pledged all they were\r\nworth in setting up presses and employing other means to forward\r\nJackson's election.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two of the three survivors of the\r\nsigners of the Declaration of Independence, passed hence on the\r\nFourth of July, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of their signing\r\nthe Magna Charta of our Republic.  Their names had been inseparably\r\nconnected in the minds and upon the lips of the people, as their\r\nlabors were united in bringing about the events of the Revolution\r\nand its final triumph.  Mr. Jefferson was the writer, Mr. Adams\r\nthe orator, of the Congress of '76.  The one penned the Declaration\r\nof Independence, the other was pronounced \"the pillar of its support\r\nand its ablest advocate and defender.\"  Mr. Jefferson called Mr.\r\nAdams \"the Colossus of the Congress,\" the most earnest, laborious\r\nmember of the body, and its animating spirit.  For the loss of\r\nthese men, though they fell as a ripe shock of corn falleth--both\r\nhaving arrived at an advanced age--Mr. Adams over ninety--the whole\r\nnation clothed itself in mourning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTRAVELING IN \"YE OLDEN TIME.\"\r\n\r\nThe old stage route between Boston and New York, before John Quincy\r\nAdams was President, passed through Worcester, Springfield, Hartford,\r\nand Norwalk.  Passengers paid ten dollars for a seat and were fifty-\r\nsix hours or more on the road.  This gave way about 1825 to the\r\nsteamboat line via Providence, which for five dollars carried\r\npassengers from Boston to New York in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nStage books for the Providence line were kept in Boston at offices\r\nin different parts of the city, where those wishing to go the next\r\nday registered their names.  These names were collected and brought\r\nto the central stage office in the Marlboro Hotel at ten o'clock\r\neach night, where they were arranged into stage-loads, each made\r\nup from those residing in the same part of the city.  At four\r\no'clock in the morning a man started from the stage office in a\r\nchaise to go about and wake up the passengers, that the stage need\r\nnot be kept waiting.  The large brass door knockers were vigorously\r\nplied, and sometimes quite a commotion was caused by \"waking up\r\nthe wrong passenger.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time the stage made its appearance, with its four spirited\r\nhorses, and the baggage was put on.  Trunks, which were diminutive\r\nin size compared with those now used, were put on the rack behind,\r\nsecurely strapped; valises and packages were consigned to the depths\r\nof a receptacle beneath the driver's seat, and bandboxes were put\r\non the top.  The back seat was generally given to ladies and elderly\r\ngentlemen, while young men usually sought a seat on top of the\r\nstage, by the side of the driver.  When the passengers had been\r\n\"picked up,\" the stages returned to the stage office, where they\r\nway-bills were perfected and handed to the drivers.  As the Old\r\nSouth clock was striking five, whips were cracked, and the coaches\r\nstarted at the rate of ten miles an hour, stopping for breakfast\r\nat Timothy Gay's tavern in Dedham, where many of the passengers\r\nvisited the bar to imbibe Holland gin and sugar-house molasses--a\r\npopular morning beverage.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, away the stages went over the good turnpike road\r\nat a rapid pace.  Those who were fellow passengers, even if strangers\r\nto one another, gradually entered into conversation, and generally\r\nsome one of them was able to impart information concerning the\r\nroute.  Occasionally the stage would rattle into a village, the\r\ndriver giving warning blasts upon his long tin horn that he claimed\r\nthe right of way, and then dash up to a wayside inn, before which\r\nwould be in waiting a fresh team of horses to take the place of\r\nthose which had drawn the coach from the previous stopping-place.\r\nTime was always afforded those passengers who desired to partake\r\nof libations at the tavern bar, and old travelers used to see that\r\ntheir luggage was safe.\r\n\r\nProvidence was in due time reached, and the procession of stages\r\nwhirled along the narrow street beneath the bluff, swaying heavily\r\nwith the irregularities of the road.  The steamboats lay at India\r\nPoint, just below the town, where immense quantities of wood were\r\npiled up, for each boat consumed between thirty and forty cords on\r\na trip through Long Island Sound.\r\n\r\nThe stages used to reach India Point about half-past eleven o'clock,\r\nand the boat would start for New York precisely at twelve.  There\r\nwere no state-rooms, the passengers occupying berths, and at the\r\ndinner and supper the captain of the boat occupied the head of the\r\ntable, having seated near him any distinguished passengers.\r\nOccasionally there was an opposition line with sharp rivalries,\r\nand at one time a then rising New Yorker, Cornelius Vanderbilt,\r\ncarried passengers from New York to Boston for one dollar.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at New York, the passengers had to look out for their\r\nluggage, and either engage hacks or hand-cartmen, who for twenty-\r\nfive cents would carry a trunk to any part of the city.  The city\r\nthen, be it remembered, did not reach up Manhattan Island above\r\nthe vicinity of Broome or Spring Streets, although there were beyond\r\nthat the villages of Greenwich, Bloomingdale, Yorkville, and Harlem.\r\nThe City Hotel, on Broadway, just above Trinity Churchyard, Bunker's\r\nHotel, lower down, and the Washington Hotel, which occupied the\r\nsite of the Stewart building above the Park, were the principal\r\npublic houses.  The Boston stages stopped at Hall's North American\r\nHotel, at the corner of Bayard Street and the Bowery, and there\r\nwere many boarding-houses where transient guests were accommodated.\r\n\r\nFrom New York, travelers southward went by steamboat to Elizabethport,\r\nwhere they were transferred to stages, and crossed New Jersey to\r\nBordentown on the Delaware River, where a steamer was in waiting\r\nto transport them to Philadelphia.  This was a long and fatiguing\r\nday's journey, and a majority of travelers remained over a day in\r\nPhiladelphia, where the hotels were excellent and there were many\r\nobjects of attraction.\r\n\r\nLeaving Philadelphia in a steamboat, passengers went down the\r\nDelaware to New Castle, whence they crossed in stages to Frenchtown\r\non the Elk River, and there re-embarked on steamers, which took\r\nthem down and around to Baltimore, another long and fatiguing day's\r\ntrip.  At each change from boat to stage, or from stage to boat,\r\npassengers had to see that their luggage was transferred, and it\r\nwas generally necessary to give a quarter to the porter.  Baggage\r\nchecks and the checking of baggage were then unknown.\r\n\r\nBetween Baltimore and Washington there were opposition lines of\r\nstages and a good turnpike road.  There had been, when I first went\r\nover the road, some daring robberies by \"road agents,\" and the mail\r\ncoaches were protected by a guard, who occupied a perch on the roof\r\nover the boot and was armed with a blunderbuss.  This weapon had\r\na funnel-shaped barrel, a flint lock, took about half a pint of\r\nbuckshot for a charge, and was capable of destroying a whole band\r\nof robbers at once.  In due time the flat, wide dome of the Capitol,\r\nwhich resembled an inverted wash-bowl, was visible, and the stage\r\nwas soon floundering through the broad expanse of mud or of dust\r\nknown as Pennsylvania Avenue, taking passengers to the doors of\r\nthe hotels or boarding-houses which they had previously indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress first met at Washington there was but one hotel there\r\nand one in Georgetown.  Others were, however, soon erected, and\r\nfifty-eight years ago there were half a dozen.  The favorite\r\nestablishment was the Indian Queen Hotel, which occupied the site\r\nof the present Metropolitan Hotel and was designated by a large\r\nswinging sign upon which figured Pocahontas, painted in glaring\r\ncolors.  The landlord, Jesse Brown, who used to come to the curbstone\r\nto \"welcome the coming guests,\" was a native of Havre-de-Grace and\r\nhad served his apprenticeship to tavern-keeping in Hagerstown and\r\nin Alexandria.  A glance at the travelers as they alighted and were\r\nushered by him into the house would enable him mentally to assign\r\neach one to a room, the advantages of which he would describe ere\r\nsending its destined occupant there under the pilotage of a colored\r\nservant.  When the next meal was ready the newly arrived guest was\r\nmet at the door of the dining-room by Mr. Brown, wearing a large\r\nwhite apron, who escorted him to a seat and then went to the head\r\nof the table, where he carved and helped the principal dish.  The\r\nexcellencies of this--fish or flesh or fowl--he would announce as\r\nhe would invite those seated at the table to send up their plates\r\nfor what he knew to be their favorite portions; and he would also\r\ninvite attention to the dishes on other parts of the table, which\r\nwere carved and helped by the guests who sat nearest them.  \"I have\r\na delicious quarter of mutton from the Valley of Virginia,\" Mr.\r\nBrown would announce in a stentorian tone, which could be heard\r\nabove the clatter of crockery and the din of steel knives and forks.\r\n\"Let me send you a rare slice, Mr. A.\"  \"Colonel B., will you not\r\nhave a bone?\"  \"Mrs. C., send up your plate for a piece of the\r\nkidney.\"  \"Mrs. D., there is a fat and tender mongrel goose at the\r\nother end of the table.\"  \"Joe, pass around the sweet potatoes.\"\r\n\"Colonel E., will you help to that chicken-pie before you?\"\r\n\r\nThe expense of living at the Indian Queen was not great.  The price\r\nof board was one dollar and seventy-five cents per day, ten dollars\r\nper week, or thirty-five dollars per month.  Transient guests were\r\ncharged fifty cents for breakfast, the same for supper, and seventy-\r\nfive cents for dinner.  Brandy and whisky were placed on the dinner-\r\ntable in decanters, to be drink by the guests without additional\r\ncharge therefor.  A bottle of real old Madeira imported into\r\nAlexandria was supplied for three dollars; sherry, brandy, and gin\r\nwere one dollar and a half per bottle, and Jamaica rum one dollar.\r\nAt the bar toddies were made with unadulterated liquor and lump\r\nsugar, and the charge was twelve and a half cents a drink.\r\n\r\nOn the Fourth of July, the 22d of February, and other holidays,\r\nlandlord Brown would concoct foaming egg-nogg in a mammoth punch-\r\nbowl once owned by Washington, and the guests of the house were\r\nall invited to partake.  The tavern-desk was behind the bar, with\r\nrows of large bells hanging by circular springs on the wall, each\r\nwith a bullet-shaped tongue, which continued to vibrate for some\r\nminutes after being pulled, thus showing to which room it belonged.\r\nThe barkeeper prepared the \"drinks\" called for, saw that the bells\r\nwere answered, received and delivered letters and cards, and answered\r\nquestions by the score.  He was supposed to know everybody in\r\nWashington, where they resided, and at what hour they could be seen.\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington had then been called by an observing foreigner\r\n\"the city of magnificent distances,\" an appellation which was well\r\nmerited.  There was a group of small, shabby houses around the Navy\r\nYard, another cluster on the river bank just above the Arsenal,\r\nwhich was to have been the business centre of the metropolis, and\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, from the Capitol to Georgetown, with the\r\nstreets immediately adjacent, was lined with tenements--many of\r\nthem with shops on the ground floor.  The Executive Departments\r\nwere located in four brick edifices on the corners of the square,\r\nin the centre of which was the White House.  The imposing building\r\nnow occupied by the Department of the Interior had not been begun\r\nnor had the General Post-Office replaced a large brick structure\r\nintended for a hotel, but which the pecuniary necessities of the\r\nprojector forced him to dispose of in a lottery before it was\r\ncompleted.  The fortunate ticket was held by minors, whose guardian\r\ncould neither sell the building nor finish it, and it remained for\r\nmany years in a dilapidated condition.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol was pronounced completed in 1825.  The two wings, which\r\nwere the only portions of the building finished when the British\r\noccupied Washington, were burned with their contents, including\r\nthe Congressional Library and some works of art.  When Congress\r\nwas convened in special session after the invasion, the two Houses\r\nassembled in the unfinished hotel previously mentioned, but soon\r\noccupied a brick building erected for their temporary use, which\r\nwas afterward known as the Old Capitol Prison.\r\n\r\nThe tympanum of the eastern pediment of the Capitol was ornamented\r\nby a historical group which Mr. John Quincy Adams designed when\r\nSecretary of State.  It was executed in marble by Luigi Persico,\r\nan Italian sculptor, whose work gave such satisfaction to Mr. Adams\r\nthat he secured for him an order for the two colossal statues which\r\nnow flank the central doorway.  War is represented by a stalwart\r\ngymnast with a profuse development of muscle and a benign expression\r\nof countenance, partially encased in ancient Roman armor, while\r\nPeace is a matronly dame, somewhat advanced in life and heavy in\r\nflesh, who carries an olive branch as if she desired to use it to\r\nkeep off flies.\r\n\r\nThe then recently completed _rotunda_ of the Capitol--Mr. Gales\r\ntook pains to have it called _rotundo_ in the _National Intelligencer_\r\n--was a hall of elegant proportions, ninety-six feet in diameter\r\nand ninety-six feet in height to the apex of its semicircular dome.\r\nIt had been decorated with remarkable historical bas-reliefs by\r\nCappellano, Gevelot, and Causici, three Italian artists--two of\r\nthem pupils of Canova.  They undoubtedly possessed artistic ability\r\nand they doubtless desired to produce works of historical value.\r\nBut they failed ignominiously.  Their respective productions were\r\nthus interpreted by Grizzly Bear, a Menominee chief.  Turning to\r\nthe eastern doorway, over which there is represented the landing\r\nof the Pilgrims, he said:  \"There Ingen give hungry white man corn.\"\r\nThen turning to the northern doorway, over which is represented\r\nWilliam Penn making a treaty with the Indians, he said:  \"There\r\nIngen give white man land.\"  Then turning to the western doorway,\r\nover which is represented Pocahontas saving the life of Captain\r\nSmith, he said:  \"There Ingen save white man's life.\"  And then\r\nturning to the Southern doorway, over which is represented Daniel\r\nBoone, the pioneer, plunging his hunting-knife into the heart of\r\na red man while his foot rests on the dead body of another, he\r\nsaid:  \"And there white man kill Ingen.  Ugh!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress was in session, the rotunda presented a busy and\r\nmotley scene every morning prior to the convening of the two houses.\r\nIt was a general rendezvous, and the newspaper correspondents were\r\nalways in attendance to pick up the floating rumors of the day.\r\n\r\nThe visit of General Lafayette to Washington gave a great impetus\r\nto Free-Masonry there.  The corner-stone of a new Masonic Temple\r\nwas laid, and many of the leading citizens had taken the degrees,\r\nwhen the rumored abduction of William Morgan was made the basis of\r\na political and religious anti-Masonic crusade.  It was asserted\r\nthat Morgan, who had written and printed a book which professed to\r\nreveal the secrets of Free-Masonry, had been kidnapped, taken to\r\nFort Niagara, and then plunged into the river, \"with all his\r\nimperfections on his head.\"  Many well-informed persons, however,\r\nare of the opinion that Morgan was hired to go to Smyrna, where he\r\nlived some years, and then died; but his real or supposed assassination\r\nawakened a profound popular indignation.  Some good men who belonged\r\nto the \"mystic tie\" felt it their duty to dissolve their connection\r\nwith it, and the Anti-Masonic party was at once got up by a goodly\r\nnumber of hopeful political aspirants.  As General Jackson and Mr.\r\nClay were both \"Free and Accepted Masons,\" Mr. Adams had at first\r\nsome hopes that he might secure his own re-election as the Anti-\r\nMasonic candidate.\r\n\r\nA small theatre at Washington was occasionally opened by a company\r\nof actors from Philadelphia, who used to journey every winter as\r\nfar south as Savannah, performing in the intermediate cities as\r\nthey went and returned.  The Jeffersons, the Warrens, and the Burkes\r\nbelonged to this company, in which their children were trained for\r\nhistrionic fame, and President Adams first saw the elder Booth when\r\nthat tragedian accompanied one of these dramatic expeditions as\r\nits brightest star.  On another occasion he saw Edwin Forrest, then\r\nunknown to fame, and enjoyed the finished acting of Cooper, as\r\nCharles Surface, in the \"School for Scandal.\"  The popular performance\r\nat that time was \"Tom and Jerry, or Life in London,\" and the flash\r\nsayings of Corinthian Tom and Bob Logic were quoted even in\r\nCongressional debates.\r\n\r\nThe Friends, or Quakers, as \"the world's people\" call them, had a\r\nsociety at Washington formed principally by the clerks of that\r\npersuasion who had come from Philadelphia when the seat of government\r\nwas removed from there.  Their harmony was, however, disturbed in\r\n1827, when a number of the most influential among them left the\r\n\"Orthodox\" or old belief and followed Elias Hicks, of New York,\r\nwho founded what has since been known as Hicksite Friends.  The\r\nFriends believed in a free gospel ministry, and did not recognize\r\neither water-baptism or the ordinance of the Lord's Supper.  At\r\ntheir meetings the elders and preachers occupied a platform at one\r\nend of the meeting-houses, the men sitting on unpainted benches on\r\none side and the women on the other.  The congregation would sit\r\nquietly, often for an hour, until the Spirit moved some preacher,\r\nmale or female, to speak or to offer prayer.  There was no singing,\r\nand often long intervals of silence.  Marriages were solemnized at\r\nthe monthly meetings, the ceremony consisting simply of a public\r\nacknowledgment by the man and woman, after due inquiry of their\r\nright to be united.  After they had stood up in meeting and publicly\r\ntaken one another to be man and wife, a certificate of the ceremony\r\nwas publicly read by one of the elders, and then signed by the\r\ncontracting parties and witnesses.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John Quincy Adams\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS--son of John Adams--was born at Braintree,\r\nMassachusetts, July 11th, 1767; Minister to the Netherlands and\r\nPrussia, 1794-1801; United States Senator, 1803-1808; Professor at\r\nHarvard College, 1808-1809; Minister to Russia, 1809-1817; negotiating\r\nthe treaty of Ghent in 1815; Secretary of State, 1817-1825; President,\r\n1825-1829; Representative in Congress, 1831, until stricken by\r\ndeath in the Capitol, February 23d, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nJOURNALISM IN 1828.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown, now called \"West Washington,\" was originally laid out\r\nas a town in 1751, and settled by the Scotch agents of English\r\nmercantile houses, whose vessels came annually to its wharves.\r\nThey brought valuable freights of hardware, dry goods, and wines,\r\nand they carried back tobacco, raised in the surrounding country,\r\nand furs, brought down the Potomac by Indian traders.  There were\r\nalso lines of brigs and schooners running to New York, Boston,\r\nSalem, Newburyport, and the West Indies.  Two principal articles\r\nof import were sugar and molasses, which were sold at auction on\r\nthe wharves.  Business in these staples has been entirely superseded\r\nby the coal and flour trade.\r\n\r\nThe main street of Georgetown was generally filled every week-day\r\nwith the lumbering Conestoga six-horse wagons, in which the farmers\r\nof Maryland and Central Pennsylvania brought loads of wheat and of\r\ncorn, taking back dry goods, groceries, salt, and, during the\r\nfishing season, fresh shad and herring.  Another source of trade\r\nwas the Potomac River, which was navigable above Georgetown as far\r\nas Cumberland in long, flat-bottomed boats, sharp at both ends,\r\ncalled \"gondolas.\"  These boats were poled down the Potomac to the\r\nGreat Falls, twelve miles above Georgetown, where a canal with\r\nlocks was constructed, running around the falls and back to the\r\nriver.  The same plan of avoiding the rapids was suggested by George\r\nWashington, who was once president of the company.  The canal was\r\nfinished in 1793, but it never yielded a sufficient revenue to pay\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nThe \"gondolas\" brought down considerable quantities of flour, corn,\r\npork, and iron, much of which was shipped at Georgetown to other\r\nports.  During the year 1812 several hundred hogsheads of Louisiana\r\nsugar were brought by way of the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the\r\nPotomac Rivers to Georgetown.  This was a realization of Washington's\r\nidea that the city which he founded and which bore his name would\r\nbecome an _entrepot_ for the products of the Mississippi Valley\r\ndestined for shipment abroad.  He displayed his faith in this belief\r\nby the purchase of wharf lots, which would not to-day bring what\r\nhe paid for them.\r\n\r\nThe Union Tavern at Georgetown was a well-patronized and fashionable\r\ninn during the first quarter of the present century.  Among the\r\ndistinguished men who were its guests were Louis Philippe, Count\r\nVolney, Baron Humboldt, Fulton (the inventor), Talleyrand, Jerome\r\nBonaparte, Washington Irving, General St. Clair, Lorenzo Dow (the\r\neccentric preacher), Francis S. Key (author of the \"Star Spangled\r\nBanner\"), with John Randolph and scores of other Congressmen, who\r\nused to ride to and from the Capitol in a large stagecoach with\r\nseats on the top and called the \"Royal George.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my mother was born in Georgetown, in 1799, the neighbors were\r\nstartled by the repeated firing of a heavily charged musket beneath\r\nthe window of her mother's room.  It was a welcome-into-the-world\r\nsalute fired by \"Old Yarrah,\" a very aged Mahometan, who had been\r\nbrought as a slave from Guinea to Georgetown, where my grandfather\r\nhad shown him some kindness, which he thus acknowledged after the\r\ncustom of his own people.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington used to pass through Georgetown on his journeys\r\nbetween the North and Mount Vernon, and I have heard my grandfather\r\ndescribe the interest which he took when the \"Federal City\" was\r\nlocated.  On one occasion he rode over to visit David Burns, who\r\nowned a farm on which the Executive Mansion and the Departments\r\nnow stand.  Washington agreed with the Commissioners that what is\r\nnow Lafayette Square should be a reservation, but Burns disliked\r\nto donate any more building lots for the public good.  Finally\r\nWashington lost his temper and left, saying, as he crossed the\r\nporch:  \"Had not the Federal City been laid out here, you would\r\nhave died a poor tobacco planter.\"  \"Aye, mon!\" retorted Burns, in\r\nbroad Scotch, \"an' had ye nae married the widow Custis, wi' a' her\r\nnagurs, you would hae been a land surveyor to-day, an' a mighty\r\npoor ane at that.\"  Ultimately, however, the obstinate old fellow\r\ndonated the desired square of ground.\r\n\r\nWhen Major L'Enfant came to Georgetown to lay out the Federal\r\nDistrict he brought a letter of introduction to my grandfather,\r\nwho had a great deal of trouble in endeavoring to adjust the\r\ndifficulties between the fiery French officer and the Commissioners\r\nappointed to govern the infant metropolis.  The Major, who was very\r\nimperious, claimed supreme authority, which the Commissioners would\r\nnot submit to.  On one occasion, a Mr. Carroll had commenced the\r\nerection of a large brick house, which Major L'Enfant found encroached\r\non one of the proposed streets.  Summoning his chain bearers and\r\naxmen, he demolished the trespassing structure and filled up the\r\ncellar, against Mr. Carroll's earnest protests.\r\n\r\nHe was a favorite with Washington, but Jefferson disliked him on\r\naccount of his connection with the Society of the Cincinnati, and\r\navailed himself of his difficulty with the Commissioners to discharge\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Major then became an unsuccessful petitioner before Congress\r\nfor a redress of his real and fancied wrongs, and he was to be seen\r\nalmost every day slowly pacing the rotunda of the Capitol.  He was\r\na tall, thin man, who wore, toward the close of his life, a blue\r\nmilitary surtout coat, buttoned quite to the throat, with a tall,\r\nblack stock, but no visible signs of linen.  His hair was plastered\r\nwith pomatum close to his head, and he wore a napless high beaver\r\nbell-crowned hat.  Under his arm he generally carried a roll of\r\npapers relating to his claim upon the Government, and in his right\r\nhand he swung a formidable hickory cane with a large silver head.\r\nA strict Roman Catholic, he received a home in the family of Mr.\r\nDigges, near Washington, in whose garden his remains were interred\r\nwhen he died.\r\n\r\nNewspaper \"organs\" formed an important feature of the early political\r\nmachinery at Washington.  Railroads, as well as the magnetic\r\ntelegraph, were then unknown, and it took two days or more for the\r\ntransmission of intelligence between the Federal Metropolis and\r\nNew York, while it was a week or two in reaching Portland, St.\r\nLouis, New Orleans, or Savannah.  This made it advisable for each\r\nsuccessive Administration to have a newspaper published at Washington\r\nwhich would reliably inform the subordinate officials what was\r\nbeing done and keep alive a sympathy between them and the President.\r\n\r\nThe _National Intelligencer_ was never devoted to Mr. Adams, as\r\nits proprietor had a kind regard for Mr. Clay, but it was always\r\nhostile to the election of General Jackson.  Mr. Joseph Giles, its\r\neditor, wrote ponderous leaders on the political questions of the\r\nday, and occasionally reported, in short-hand, the speeches of\r\nCongressional magnates.  His partner, Colonel William Winstead\r\nSeaton, was by trade a printer, and his generous hand was ever\r\nready to aid those of his fellow-craftsmen who were in destitute\r\ncircumstances--indeed, the superannuated compositors of the _National\r\nIntelligencer_ always received \"half pay.\"  Coming here when\r\nWashington was only just \"staked out,\" he was honorably identified\r\nwith the growth of Washington City, and his administration as Mayor\r\nis favorably spoken of by the citizens of all classes and parties.\r\n\r\nThe _National Intelligencer_ had been established as a Catholic\r\norgan, with John Agg, an Englishman of great ability, as its editor,\r\nand Richard Houghton, afterward the popular editor of the Boston\r\n_Atlas_, as its Congressional reporter.  In 1825 the paper was\r\npurchased by Peter Force and became the \"hand-organ\" of all the\r\nelements of opposition to General Jackson.  Such abusive articles\r\nand scurrilous remarks as the dignified _National Intelligencer_\r\nwould not publish appeared in the _National Journal_.  Some of\r\nthese articles reflected upon Mrs. Jackson and gave great offense\r\nto her husband, who was persuaded that they were inspired by\r\nPresident Adams.\r\n\r\nMatthew L. Davis, who was probably the most influential of Washington\r\ncorrespondents, was a New York printer.  He had entered political\r\nlife in 1790 and joined the Democratic party, which came into power\r\nby the election of Jefferson as President and Burr as Vice-President.\r\nDavis went to Washington shortly afterward, and was boasting that\r\nthe elevation of Mr. Jefferson was brought about solely by the\r\nmanagement of Tammany Hall.  Mr. Jefferson was a philosopher, and\r\nsoon after caught a very large fly, calling the attention of Mr.\r\nDavis to the remarkable fact of the great disproportion in size of\r\none portion of the insect to its body.  Mr. Davis took the hint,\r\nand left the President, in doubt as to whether Mr. Jefferson intended\r\nthe comparison to apply to New York or to him (Davis) as an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis was at one time wealthy, having cleared over one hundred\r\nthousand dollars in the South American trade; but he became poor,\r\nand for many years he was the correspondent at Washington of the\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, of New York, under the signature of \"The\r\nSpy in Washington.\"  He was also the correspondent of the London\r\n_Times_, under the signature of \"The Genevese Traveler.\"  On one\r\noccasion Mr. Davis was presented to the British Minister at Washington\r\n(Lord Ashburton) as the author of those letters in the _Times_.\r\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" said the Envoy.  \"They are extraordinary\r\nletters.  I have read them with great pleasure.  I hope, sir, that\r\nyou are well paid by the _Times_.  If not, sir, let me know it; I\r\nwill take care that you are paid handsomely.\"  Mr. Davis begged\r\nnot to be misunderstood, and said that he was amply paid by the\r\n_Times_.  He received two guineas for each letter.\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Bennett in 1828, when in his thirtieth year, became\r\nthe Washington correspondent of the New York _Enquirer_, which was\r\nthen on the topmost round of the journalistic ladder.  It is related\r\nof him that during his stay in this position he came across a copy\r\nof _Walpole's Letters_ and resolved to try the effect of a few\r\nletters written in a similar strain.  The truth of this is doubtful.\r\nIt is more probably that the natural talents of the man were now\r\nunfettered, and he wrote without fear of censorship and with all\r\nthe ease which a sense of freedom inspires.  He was naturally witty,\r\nsarcastic and sensible.  These letters were lively, they abounded\r\nin personal allusions, and they described freely, not only Senators,\r\nbut the wives and daughters of Senators, and they established Mr.\r\nBennett's reputation as a light lance among the hosts of writers.\r\n\r\nMajor M. M. Noah was for many years a leading New York journalist,\r\nwho occasionally visited Washington, where he was always welcome.\r\nMajor Noah was born in Philadelphia, where he was apprenticed, as\r\nhe grew up, to learn the carver's trade, but he soon abandoned it\r\nfor political pursuits.  Receiving the appointment of Consul to\r\nTunis, he passed several years in Northern Africa, and on his return\r\nwrote a very clever book containing his souvenirs of travel.  About\r\nthe year 1825 he conceived the idea of collecting the scattered\r\nJews and of rebuilding Jerusalem.  Grand Island, in the Niagara\r\nRiver, above Niagara falls, was designated as the rendezvous, and\r\nMajor Noah's proclamation, which he sent to all parts of the world,\r\ncreated quite a sensation among the Children of Israel.  He\r\nsubsequently was connected with the evening press of New York and\r\nwas then appointed to a Government office by President Jackson.\r\nHe was a man of fine personal appearance and great conversational\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAnother New York journalist, just coming before the public, was\r\nThurlow Weed, a tall man, with an altogether massive person.  His\r\nlarge head was at that time covered with dark hair, and he had\r\nprominent features and gray eyes, which were watchful and overhung\r\nby shaggy eyebrows.  He was a man of great natural strength of\r\ncharacter, deep penetration as regards human nature, and a good\r\nsense, judgment, and cheerfulness in his own characteristics which\r\nconduced to respect and popularity.  He was most happy in his\r\nintercourse with men, for he had, when a mere youth, a geniality\r\nand tact which drew all toward him, and it has been said that he\r\nnever forgot a face or a fact.  There has never been a better\r\nexample of the good old stock of printer-editors, who seemed to\r\nhave an intuitive capacity for public affairs, and never to love\r\npolitical success well enough to leave their newspapers in order\r\nto pursue the glittering attraction of public life.\r\n\r\nAmong the other newspaper men in Washington were William Hayden,\r\nCongressional reporter for the _National Intelligencer_, who\r\nafterward succeeded Mr. Houghton as editor of the Boston _Atlas_;\r\nLund Washington, equally famed as a performer on the violin and\r\nwriter of short-hand; Samuel L. Knapp, a graduate of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, who abandoned the law for journalism and corresponded with\r\nthe Boston _Gazette_, and James Brooks, a graduate of Waterville,\r\nafterward the founder of the New York _Express_ and a Representative\r\nin Congress, who was the correspondent of the Portland _Advertiser_\r\nand other papers.\r\n\r\nProminent as an adopted citizen of Washington and as a personal\r\nfriend of President Adams was Dr. William F. Thornton, Superintendent\r\nof the Patent Office, who had by personal appeals to his conquering\r\ncountrymen, in 1814, saved the models of patents from the general\r\nconflagration of the public buildings.  He was also a devoted lover\r\nof horse-racing, and on one occasion, when he expected that a horse\r\nof his would win the cup, Mr. Adams walked out to the race-course\r\nto enjoy the Doctor's triumph, but witnessed his defeat.  After\r\nthe death of Dr. Thornton and of his accomplished wife, it became\r\nknown that she was the daughter of the unfortunate Dr. Dodd, of\r\nLondon, who was executed for forgery in 1777.  Her mother emigrated\r\nto Philadelphia soon afterward, under the name of Brodeau, and\r\nbrought her infant daughter with her.  In Philadelphia she opened\r\na boarding-school, which was liberally patronized, as she had\r\nbrought excellent letters of recommendation and displayed great\r\nability as a teacher.  The daughter grew up to be a lady remarkable\r\nfor her beauty and accomplishments and married Dr. Thornton, who\r\nbrought her to Washington in 1800.\r\n\r\nCongress had placed on the statute-book stringent penal laws against\r\ngambling, but they were a dead letter, unless some poor dupe made\r\na complaint of foul play, or some fleeced blackleg sought vengeance\r\nthrough the aid of the Grand Jury; then the matter was usually\r\ncompounded by the repayment of the money.  The northern sidewalks\r\nof Pennsylvania Avenue between the Indian Queen Hotel and the\r\nCapitol gate, was lined with faro banks, where good suppers were\r\nserved and well-supplied sideboards were free to all comers.  It\r\nwas a tradition that in one of these rooms Senator Montford Stokes,\r\nof North Carolina, sat down one Thursday afternoon to play a game\r\nof brag with Mountjoy Bailey, then the Sergeant-at-Arms of the\r\nSenate.  That body had adjourned over, as was then its custom, from\r\nThursday until Monday, so the players were at liberty to keep on\r\nwith their game, only stopping occasionally for refreshments.  The\r\ngame was continued Friday night and Saturday, through Saturday\r\nnight and all day Sunday and Sunday night, the players resting for\r\na snatch of sleep as nature became exhausted.  Monday morning the\r\ngame was in full blast, but at ten o'clock Bailey moved an adjournment,\r\nalleging that his official duties required his presence in the\r\nSenate Chamber.  Stokes remonstrated, but the Sergeant-at-Arms\r\npersisted, and rose from the table, the Senator grumbling and\r\ndeclaring that he had supposed that Stokes would have thus prematurely\r\nbroken up the game he would not have sat down to play with him.\r\n\r\nWhist was regularly played at many of the \"Congressional messes,\"\r\nand at private parties a room was always devoted to whist-playing.\r\nOnce when the wife of Henry Clay was chaperoning a young lady from\r\nBoston, at a party given by one of his associates in the Cabinet,\r\nthey passed through the card-room, where Mr. Clay and other gentlemen\r\nwere playing whist.  The young lady, in her Puritan simplicity,\r\ninquired:  \"Is card-playing a common practice here?\"  \"Yes,\" replied\r\nMrs. Clay, \"the gentlemen always play when they get together.\"\r\n\"Don't it distress you,\" said the Boston maiden, \"to have Mr. Clay\r\ngamble?\"  \"Oh! dear, no!\" composedly replied the statesman's wife,\r\n\"he 'most always wins.\"\r\n\r\nThere were only a few billiard-rooms, mostly patronized by the\r\nmembers of the foreign legations or visiting young men from the\r\nNorthern cities.  Ten-pin alleys were abundant, and some of the\r\nmuscular Congressmen from the frontier would make a succession of\r\n\"ten strikes\" with great ease, using the heaviest balls.  Some of\r\nthe English residents organized a cricket club, and used to play\r\non a level spot in \"the slashes,\" near where the British Legation\r\nwas afterward built, but the game was not popular, and no American\r\noffered to join the club.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Your obedt servt.\r\n  William H. Crawford\r\nWilliam Harris Crawford was born in Virginia, February 24th, 1772;\r\nwas United States Senator 1807-1813; Minister to France, 1813-1815;\r\nSecretary of War, 1815-1816; Secretary of the Treasury, 1816-1825;\r\nJudge of the Northern Circuit Court of Georgia, 1827, until he died\r\nat Elberton, Georgia, September 15th, 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nPROMINENT SENATORS OF 1827.\r\n\r\nThe old Senate Chamber, now used by the Supreme Court, was admirably\r\nadapted for the deliberations of the forty-eight gentlemen who\r\ncomposed the upper house of the Nineteenth Congress.  Modeled after\r\nthe theatres of ancient Greece, it possessed excellent acoustic\r\nproperties, and there was ample accommodation in the galleries for\r\nthe few strangers who then visited Washington.  The Senate used to\r\nmeet at noon and generally conclude its day's work by three o'clock,\r\nwhile adjournments over from Thursday until the following Monday\r\nwere frequent.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun was Vice-President of the United States, and\r\nconsequently President of the Senate--a position which was to him\r\nvery irksome, as he was forced to sit and dumbly listen to debates\r\nin which he was eager to participate.  He had been talked of by\r\nsome of the best men in the country as a candidate during the then\r\nrecent Presidential election, but the North had not given him any\r\nsubstantial support.  Regarding each Senator as an Ambassador from\r\na sovereign State, he did not believe that as Vice-President he\r\npossessed the power to call them to order for words spoken in\r\ndebate.  Senator John Randolph abused this license, and one day\r\ncommenced one of his tirades by saying:  \"_Mr. Speaker!  I mean\r\nMr. President of the Senate and would-be President of the United\r\nStates, which God in His infinite mercy avert_,\" and then went on\r\nin his usual strain of calumny and abuse.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was tall, well-formed, without an ounce of superfluous\r\nflesh, with a serious expression of countenance rarely brightened\r\nby a smile, and with his black hair thrown back from his forehead,\r\nhe looked like an arch-conspirator waiting for the time to come\r\nwhen he could strike the first blow.  In his dress Mr. Calhoun\r\naffected a Spartan simplicity, yet he used to have four horses\r\nharnessed to his carriage, and his entertainments at his residence\r\non Georgetown Heights were very elegant.  His private life was\r\nirreproachable, although when Secretary of War under Mr. Monroe,\r\nhe had suffered obloquy because of a profitable contract, which\r\nhad been dishonestly awarded during his absence by his chief clerk\r\nto that official's brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe prime mover of the Senate of that day was Martin Van Buren, of\r\nNew York, who was beginning to reap the reward of years of subservient\r\nintrigues.  Making the friends of Calhoun and of Crawford believe\r\nthat they had each been badly treated by the alliance between Adams\r\nand Clay, he united them in the support of General Jackson, and\r\nyet no one suspected him.  When Mr. Van Buren had first been elected\r\nto Congress, Rufus King, of his State, had said to G. F. Mercer,\r\nalso a member, \"Within two weeks Van Buren will become perfectly\r\nacquainted with the views and feelings of every member, yet no\r\nman will know his.\"\r\n\r\nThis prediction was verified, and Mr. Van Buren soon became the\r\ndirecting spirit among the friends of General Jackson, although no\r\none was ever able to quote his views.  Taking Aaron Burr as his\r\npolitical model, but leading an irreproachable private life, he\r\nrose by his ability to plan and execute with consummate skill the\r\nmost difficult political intrigues.  He was rather under the medium\r\nheight, with a high forehead, a quick eye, and pleasing features.\r\nHe made attitude and deportment a study, and when, on his leaving\r\nthe Senate, his household furniture was sold at auction it was\r\nnoticed that the carpet before a large looking-glass in his study\r\nwas worn and threadbare.  It was there that he had rehearsed his\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nThe \"Father of the Senate\" was Nathaniel Macon, of North Carolina,\r\nwho had served in the ranks during the Revolution, and then in the\r\nSenate of North Carolina.  He was elected to the Second Congress,\r\ntaking his seat in October, 1791, and after having been re-elected\r\neleven times, generally without opposition, he was transferred to\r\nthe Senate in 1815, and re-elected until he declined in 1828, making\r\nthirty-seven years of continuous Congressional service.  At the\r\nvery commencement of his Congressional career he energetically\r\nopposed the financial schemes of Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, and throughout his political career he was a\r\n\"strict, severe, and stringent\" Democrat.  Personally Mr. Macon\r\nwas a genial companion.  He had none of that moroseness at the\r\nfireside which often accompanies political distinction, and it was\r\nsaid that at his home he was the kindest and most beloved of slave-\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Hart Benton, who had earned the military title in\r\nthe army during the war with Great Britain, was a large, heavily\r\nframed man, with black curly hair and whiskers, prominent features,\r\nand a stentorian voice.  He wore the high, black-silk neck-stock\r\nand the double-breasted frock-coat of his youthful times during\r\nhis thirty years' career in the Senate, varying with the seasons\r\nthe materials of which his pantaloons were made, but never the\r\nfashion in which they were cut.  When in debate, outraging every\r\ncustomary propriety of language, he would rush forward with blunt\r\nfury upon every obstacle, like the huge, wild buffaloes then ranging\r\nthe prairies of his adopted State, whose paths, he used to subsequently\r\nassert, would show the way through the passes of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nHe was not a popular speaker, and when he took the floor occupants\r\nof the galleries invariably began to leave, while many Senators\r\ndevoted themselves to their correspondence.  In private life Colonel\r\nBenton was gentleness and domestic affection personified, and a\r\ndesire to have his children profit by the superior advantages for\r\ntheir education in the District of Columbia kept him from his\r\nconstituents in Missouri, where a new generation of voters grew up\r\nwho did not know him and who would not follow his political lead,\r\nwhile he was ignorant of their views on the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nSenator Randolph, of Virginia, attracted the most attention on the\r\npart of strangers.  He was at least six feet in height, with long\r\nlimbs, an ill-proportioned body, and a small, round head.  Claiming\r\ndescent from Pocahontas, he wore his coarse, black hair long, parted\r\nin the middle, and combed down on either side of his sallow face.\r\nHis small, black eyes were expressive in their rapid glances,\r\nespecially when he was engaged in debate, and his high-toned and\r\nthin voice would ring through the Senate Chamber like the shrill\r\nscream of an angry vixen.  He generally wore a full suit of heavy,\r\ndrab-colored English broadcloth, the high, rolling collar of his\r\nsurtout coat almost concealing his head, while the skirts hung in\r\nvoluminous folds about his knee-breeches and the white leather tops\r\nof his boots.  He used to enter the Senate Chamber wearing a pair\r\nof silver spurs, carrying a heavy riding-whip, and followed by a\r\nfavorite hound, which crouched beneath his desk.  He wrote, and\r\noccasionally spoke, in riding-gloves, and it was his favorite\r\ngesture to point the long index finger of his right hand at his\r\nopponent as he hurled forth tropes and figures of speech at him.\r\nEvery ten or fifteen minutes, while he occupied the floor, he would\r\nexclaim in a low voice, \"Tims, more porter!\" and the assistant\r\ndoorkeeper would hand him a foaming tumbler of potent malt liquor,\r\nwhich he would hurriedly drink, and then proceed with his remarks,\r\noften thus drinking three or four quarts in an afternoon.  He was\r\nnot choice in his selection of epithets, and as Mr. Calhoun took\r\nthe ground that he did not have the power to call a Senator to\r\norder, the irate Virginian pronounced President Adams \"a traitor,\"\r\nDaniel Webster \"a vile slanderer,\" John Holmes \"a dangerous fool,\"\r\nand Edward Livingston \"the most contemptible and degraded of beings,\r\nwhom no man ought to touch, unless with a pair of tongs.\"  One day,\r\nwhile he was speaking with great freedom of abuse of Mr. Webster,\r\nthen a member of the House, a Senator informed him in an undertone\r\nthat Mrs. Webster was in the gallery.  He had not the delicacy to\r\ndesist, however, until he had fully emptied the vials of his wrath.\r\nThen he set upon Mr. Speaker Taylor, and after abusing him soundly\r\nhe turned sarcastically to the gentleman who had informed him of\r\nMrs. Webster's presence, and asked, \"Is Mrs. Taylor present also?\"\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was frequently the object of Mr. Randolph's denunciations,\r\nwhich he bore patiently until the \"Lord of Roanoke\" spoke, one day,\r\nof the reported alliance between the President and the Secretary\r\nof State as the \"coalition of Bilfil and Black George--the combination,\r\nunheard of till then, of the Puritan and the blackleg.\"  Mr. Clay\r\nat once wrote to know whether he had intended to call him a political\r\ngambler, or to attach the infamy of such epithets to his private\r\nlife.  Mr. Randolph declined to give any explanation, and a duel\r\nwas fought without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, on another occasion, deliberately insulted Mr. James\r\nLloyd, one of \"the solid men of Boston,\" then a Senator from\r\nMassachusetts, who had, in accordance with the custom, introduced\r\nupon the floor of the Senate one of his constituents, Major Benjamin\r\nRussell, the editor of the _Columbian Sentinel_.  The sight of a\r\nFederal editor aroused Mr. Randolph's anger, and he at once insolently\r\ndemanded that the floor of the Senate be cleared, forcing Major\r\nRussell to retire.  Mr. Lloyd took the first opportunity to express\r\nhis opinion of this gratuitous insult, and declared, in very forcible\r\nlanguage, that, as he had introduced Major Russell on the floor,\r\nhe was responsible therefor.  Mr. Randolph indulged in a little\r\ngasconade, in which he announced that his carriage was waiting at\r\nthe door to convey him to Baltimore, and at the conclusion of his\r\nremarks he left the Senate Chamber and the city.  Mr. Calhoun, who\r\nhad not attempted to check Mr. Randolph, lamented from the chair\r\nthat anything should have happened to mar the harmony of the Senate,\r\nand again declared that he had not power to call a Senator to order,\r\nnor would he for ten thousand worlds look like a usurper.\r\n\r\nSenator Tazewell, Mr. Randolph's colleague, was a first-class\r\nVirginia abstractionist and an avowed hater of New England.  Dining\r\none day at the White House, he provoked the President by offensively\r\nasserting that he had \"never known a Unitarian who did not believe\r\nin the sea-serpent.\"  Soon afterward Mr. Tazewell spoke of the\r\ndifferent kinds of wines, and declared that Tokay and Rhenish wine\r\nwere alike in taste.  \"Sir,\" said Mr. Adams, \"I do not believe that\r\nyou ever drank a drop of Tokay in your life.\"  For this remark the\r\nPresident subsequently sent an apology to Mr. Tazewell, but the\r\nVirginia Senator never forgot or forgave the remark.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison, a tall, spare, gray-haired gentleman, who\r\nhad gone from his Virginia home into the Western wilderness as aid-\r\nde-camp to General Anthony Wayne, had been elected a Senator from\r\nthe State of Ohio, but probably never dreamed that in years to come\r\nhe would be elected President by an immense majority, with John\r\nTyler on the ticket as Vice-President.  Colonel Richard M. Johnson,\r\nof Kentucky, had, however, begun to electioneer for the Democratic\r\nnomination for the Vice-Presidency, basing his claim upon his having\r\nshot Tecumseh at the battle of the Thames, and he was finally\r\nsuccessful.  He was of medium size, with large features, and light\r\nauburn hair, and his private life was attacked without mercy by\r\nhis political opponents.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Eaton, of Tennessee, was General Jackson's henchman,\r\nwho had come to the Senate that he might better electioneer for\r\nhis old friend and commander.  William Hendricks, a Senator from\r\nIndiana, was the uncle of Thomas A. Hendricks, of a subsequent\r\npolitical generation.  The New Hampshire Senators were Levi Woodbury\r\nand John Bell, men of decided ability and moral worth.  Georgia\r\nsupplied a polished and effective orator in J. McPherson Berrien.\r\nVermont was represented by portly and good-looking Dudley Chase,\r\nwho was the uncle of Chief Justice Chase, and by Horatio Seymour,\r\nof Middlebury.  Maine's stalwart, blue-eyed Senator, Albion Keith\r\nParris, was said to have filled more public offices than any other\r\nman of his age, and his colleague, John Holmes, although rude in\r\nspeech and at times vulgar, was the humorous champion of the North.\r\nEver on the watch for some unguarded expression by a Southern\r\nSenator, no sooner would one be uttered than he would pounce upon\r\nit and place the speaker in a most uncomfortable position.  John\r\nTyler one day thought that he could annoy Mr. Holmes, and asked\r\nhim what had become of that political firm once mentioned in debate\r\nby John Randolph as \"James Madison, Felix Grundy, John Holmes, and\r\nthe Devil.\"  Mr. Holmes rose at once.  \"I will tell the gentleman,\"\r\nsaid he, \"what has become of the firm.  The first member is dead,\r\nthe second has gone into retirement, the third now addresses you,\r\nand the last has gone over to the Nullifiers, and is now electioneering\r\namong the gentleman's constituents.  So the partnership is legally\r\ndissolved.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senators were rather exclusive, those from the South assuming\r\nthe control of \"good society,\" which was then very limited in its\r\nextent and simple in its habits.  Few Senators and Representatives\r\nbrought their wives to cheer their Congressional labors, and a\r\nparlor of ordinary size would contain all of those who were accustomed\r\nto attend social gatherings.  The diplomats, with the officers of\r\nthe army and navy stationed at headquarters, were accompanied by\r\ntheir wives, and there were generally a few visitors of social\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThe Washington assemblies were very ceremonious and exclusive.\r\nAdmission was obtained only by cards of invitation, issued after\r\nlong consultations among the Committeemen, and, once inside the\r\nexclusive ring, the beaux and belles bowed beneath the disciplinary\r\nrule of a master of ceremonies.  No gentleman, whatever may have\r\nbeen his rank or calling, was permitted on the floor unless in full\r\nevening dress, with the adornment of pumps, silk stockings, and\r\nflowing cravat, unless he belonged to the army or the navy, in\r\nwhich case complete regimentals covered a multitude of sins.  The\r\nball, commencing with the stroke of eight precisely, opened with\r\na rollicking country dance, and the lady selected for the honor of\r\nopening the festivities was subsequently toasted as the reigning\r\ndivinity of fashion for the hour.  The \"_minuet de la cour_\" and\r\nstately \"quadrille,\" varied by the \"basket dance,\" and, on exceptional\r\noccasions, the exhilarating \"cheat,\" formed the staple for saltatorial\r\nperformance, until the hour of eleven brought the concluding country\r\ndance, when a final squad of roysterers bobbed \"up the middle and\r\ndown again\" to the airs of \"Sir Roger de Coverly\" or \"Money Musk.\"\r\n\r\nThe music was furnished by colored performers on the violin, except\r\non great occasions, when some of the Marine Band played an\r\naccompaniment on flutes and clarinets.  The refreshments were iced\r\nlemonade, ice-cream, port wine negus, and small cakes, served in\r\na room adjoining the dancing-hall, or brought in by the colored\r\ndomestics, or by the cavalier in his own proper person, who ofttimes\r\nappeared upon the dancing-floor, elbowing his way to the lady of\r\nhis adoration, in the one hand bearing well-filled glasses, and in\r\nthe other sustaining a plate heaped up with cake.\r\n\r\nThe costume of the ladies was classic in its scantiness, especially\r\nat balls and parties.  The fashionable ball dress was of white\r\nIndia crape, and five breadths, each a quarter of a yard wide, were\r\nall that was asked for to make a skirt, which only came down to\r\nthe ankles, and was elaborately trimmed with a dozen or more rows\r\nof narrow flounces.  Silk or cotton stockings were adorned with\r\nembroidered \"clocks,\" and thin slippers were ornamented with silk\r\nrosettes and tiny buckles.\r\n\r\nThose gentlemen who dressed fashionably wore \"Bolivar\" frock-coats\r\nof some gay-colored cloth, blue or green or claret, with large\r\nlapels and gilded buttons.  Their linen was ruffled; their \"Cossack\"\r\ntrousers were voluminous in size, and were tucked into high \"Hessian\"\r\nboots with gold tassels.  They wore two and sometimes three\r\nwaistcoats, each of different colors, and from their watch-pockets\r\ndangled a ribbon, with a bunch of large seals.  When in full dress,\r\ngentlemen wore dress-coats with enormous collars and short waists,\r\nwell-stuffed white cambric cravats, small-clothes, or tight-fitting\r\npantaloons, silk stockings, and pumps.\r\n\r\nDuels were very common, and a case of dueling pistols was a part\r\nof the outfit of the Southern and Western Congressmen, who used to\r\nspend more or less time in practicing.  Imported pistols were highly\r\nprized, but the best weapons were made by a noted Philadelphia\r\ngunsmith named Derringer, who gave his name to a short pistol of\r\nhis invention to be carried in the trouser's pocket for use in\r\nstreet fights.  Some of the dueling pistols were inlaid with gold,\r\nand they all had flint-locks, as percussion caps had not been\r\ninvented, nor hair triggers.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Edward Everett.\r\nEDWARD EVERETT.  Born in Massachusetts April 11th, 1794; was a\r\nUnitarian clergyman, and a professor at Harvard College, until\r\nelected a Representative from Massachusetts, 1825-1835; Governor\r\nof Massachusetts, 1836-1840; Minister to Great Britain, 1841-1843;\r\nPresident of Harvard College, 1846-1849; Secretary of State under\r\nPresident Fillmore, 1852-1853; United States Senator from Massachusetts,\r\n1853-1854; died at Boston, January 15th, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nPROMINENT REPRESENTATIVES OF 1827.\r\n\r\nThe Hall of the House of Representatives (now used as a National\r\nGallery of Statuary) was a reproduction of the ancient theatre,\r\nmagnificent in its effect, but so deficient in acoustic properties\r\nthat it was unfit for legislative occupation.  It was there that\r\nHenry Clay, then Speaker of the House, had welcomed General Lafayette\r\nas \"the Nation's Guest.\"  The contrast between the tall and graceful\r\nKentuckian, with his sunny smile and his silver-toned voice, and\r\nthe good old Marquis, with his auburn wig awry, must have been\r\ngreat.  His reply appeared to come from a grateful heart, but it\r\nwas asserted that the Speaker had written both his own words of\r\nwelcome and also Lafayette's acknowledgment of them, and it became\r\na subject of newspaper controversy, which was ended by the publication\r\nof a card signed \"H. Clay,\" in which he positively denied the\r\nauthorship, although he admitted that he had suggested the most\r\neffective sentences.\r\n\r\nLadies had been excluded from the galleries of the House originally,\r\nin accordance with British precedent.  But one night at a party a\r\nlady expressed her regret to Hon. Fisher Ames, of Massachusetts,\r\nthat she could not hear the arguments, especially his speeches.\r\nMr. Ames gallantly replied that he knew of no reason why ladies\r\nshould not hear the debates.  \"Then,\" said Mrs. Langdon, \"if you\r\nwill let me know when next you intend to speak, I will make up a\r\nparty of ladies and we will go and hear you.\"  The notice was given,\r\nthe ladies went, and since then Congressional orators have always\r\nhad fair hearers--with others perhaps not very fair.\r\n\r\nThe House was really occupied, during the administration of John\r\nQuincy Adams, in the selection of his successor.  At first the\r\npolitical outlook was rather muddled, although keen eyes averred\r\nthat they could perceive, moving restlessly to and fro, the indefinite\r\nforms of those shadows which coming events project.  Different\r\nseers interpreted the phantasmal appearances in different fashions,\r\nand either endeavored to form novel combinations, or joined in\r\nraking common sewers for filth wherewith to bespatter those who\r\nwere the rivals of their favorite candidates.  It was then that\r\nCongressional investigating committees became a part of the political\r\nmachinery of the day.  The accounts of President Adams when, in\r\nformer years, he was serving the country in Europe as a diplomatist;\r\nthe summary execution of deserters by order of General Jackson,\r\nwhen he commanded the army in Florida; the bills for refurnishing\r\nthe White House; the affidavits concerning the alleged bargain\r\nbetween the President and his Secretary of State, and the marriage\r\nof General Jackson to Mrs. Robards before she had been divorced\r\nfrom Mr. Robards, were, with many other scandals, paraded before\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster had been recognized in advance as the leader of the\r\nHouse by his appointment as chairman of the committee to inform\r\nMr. Adams that he had been elected President.  This Mr. Webster\r\ndid verbally, but Mr. Adams had prepared a written reply, which\r\nhad been copied by a clerk and bore his autograph signature.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was at that period of his life the embodiment of health\r\nand good spirits.  His stalwart frame, his massive head, crowned\r\nwith a wealth of black hair, his heavy eye-brows, overhanging his\r\ngreat, expressive, and cavernous eyes, all distinguished him as\r\none of the powers of the realm of the intellect--one of the few to\r\nwhom Divinity has accorded a royal share of the Promethian fire of\r\ngenius.  His department was ceremonious, and he made a decided\r\nimpression on strangers.  When Jenny Lind first saw him, she was\r\nmuch impressed by his majestic appearance, and afterward exclaimed,\r\n\"I have seen a man!\"\r\n\r\nHis swarthy complexion gained him the epithet of \"Black Dan.\"  He\r\nwas very proud of his complexion, which he inherited from his\r\ngrandmother, Susannah Bachelder (from whom the poet Whittier also\r\nclaimed descent), and he used to quote the compliment paid by\r\nGeneral Stark, the hero of Bennington, to his father, Colonel\r\nEbenezer Webster:  \"He has the black Bachelder complexion, which\r\nburnt gunpowder will not change.\"  Although majestic in appearance,\r\nMr. Webster was not really a very large man; in height he was only\r\nabout five feet ten inches.  His head looked very large, but he\r\nwore a seven and five-eighth hat, as did Mr. Clay, whose head\r\nappeared much smaller.  His shoulders were very broad and his chest\r\nwas very full, but his hips and lower limbs were small.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had his first great sorrow then.  His eldest, and at\r\nthat time his only, daughter died at Washington, and the next year\r\nher mother followed her to the grave.  This estimable lady, whose\r\nmaiden name was Grace Fletcher, was one year older than Mr. Webster,\r\nand was the daughter of a New Hampshire clergyman.  While on her\r\nway to Washington with her husband, the December after he had been\r\nre-elected United States Senator by a nearly two-thirds vote in\r\neach branch of the \"General Court\" of Massachusetts, she was taken\r\nfatally ill at the house of Mr. Webster's friend, Dr. Perkins,\r\nwhere they were guests.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had begun at that time to be disturbed about his money\r\nmatters, although he should have been in a prosperous pecuniary\r\ncondition.  His professional income could not have been less than\r\ntwenty thousand dollars a year, and he had just received seventy\r\nthousand dollars as his five per cent. fee as counsel for the\r\nclaimants before the Commissioners on Spanish Claims, but he had\r\nbegun to purchase land and was almost always harassed for ready\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nEdward Everett, who was a member of the Massachusetts delegation\r\nin the House, had won early fame as a popular preacher of the\r\ngospel, as a professor at Harvard College, and as the editor of\r\nthe _North American Review_.  Placed by his marriage above want,\r\nhe became noted for his profound learning and persuasive eloquence.\r\nAt times he was almost electrical in his utterances; his reasoning\r\nwas logical and luminous, and his remarks always gave evidence of\r\ncareful study.  As a politician Mr. Everett was not successful.\r\nThe personification of self-discipline and dignity, he was too much\r\nlike an intellectual icicle to find favor with the masses, and he\r\nwas deficient in courage when any bold step was to be taken.\r\n\r\nGeorge McDuffie, who represented the Edgefield District of South\r\nCarolina, had been taken from labor in a blacksmith's shop by Mr.\r\nCalhoun and became the grateful champion of his patron in the House.\r\nHe was a spare, grim-looking man, who was an admirer of Milton,\r\nand who was never known to jest or to smile.  As a debater he had\r\nfew equals in the House, but he failed when, during the discussion\r\nof the Panama Mission question, he opened his batteries upon Mr.\r\nWebster.  The \"expounder of the Constitution\" retorted with great\r\nforce, reminding the gentleman from South Carolina that noisy\r\ndeclamation was not logic, and that he should not apply coarse\r\nepithets to the President, who could not reply to them.  Mr. Webster\r\nthen went on to say that he would furnish the gentleman from South\r\nCarolina with high authority on the point to which he had objected,\r\nand quoted from a speech by Mr. Calhoun which effectively extinguished\r\nMr. McDuffie.\r\n\r\nTristram Burgess, of Rhode Island, who had a snowy head and a Roman\r\nnose, was called \"the bald eagle of the House.\"  Although under\r\nfifty years of age, his white hair and bent form gave him a\r\npatriarchal look and added to the effect of his fervid eloquence\r\nand his withering sarcasm.  A man of iron heart, he was ever anxious\r\nto meet his antagonists, haughty in his rude self-confidence, and\r\nexhaustive in the use of every expletive of abuse permitted by\r\nparliamentary usage.  In debate he resembled one of the old soldiers\r\nwho fought on foot or on horseback, with heavy or light arms, a\r\nbattle-axe or a spear.  The champion of the North, he divided the\r\nSouth and thrashed and slashed as did old Horatius, when with his\r\ngood sword he stood upon the bridge and with his single arm defended\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nGeorge Kremer, of Pennsylvania, was probably the most unpopular\r\nman in the House.  An anonymous letter had appeared just before\r\nthe election of President [Adams] by the Representatives denouncing\r\nan \"unholy coalition\" between Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay, by which the\r\nsupport of the friends of the latter had been transferred to the\r\nformer, \"as the planter does his negroes, or the farmer his team\r\nand horses.\"  Mr. Clay at once published a card, over his signature,\r\nin which he called the writer \"a base and infamous calumniator, a\r\ndastard, and a liar.\"  Mr. Kremer replied, admitting that he had\r\nwritten the letter, but in such a manner that his political friends\r\nwere ashamed of his cowardice, while the admirers of Mr. Clay were\r\nvery indignant--the more so as they suspected that Mr. James Buchanan\r\nhad instigated the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry W. Dwight, of Massachusetts, a good specimen of \"a sound\r\nmind in a sound body,\" gave great attention to the appropriation\r\nbills, and secured liberal sums for carrying on the various\r\ndepartments of the Government.  His most formidable antagonist was\r\na self-styled reformer and physical giant, Mr. Thomas Chilton, of\r\nKentucky, who had been at one period of his life a Baptist preacher.\r\nHe declared on the floor in debate that he was pledged to his\r\nconstituents to endeavor to retrench the expenses of the General\r\nGovernment, to diminish the army and navy, to abridge the number\r\nof civil and diplomatic officials, and, above all, to cut down the\r\npay of Congressmen.  He made speeches in support of all these\r\n\"reforms,\" but did not succeed in securing the discharge of a\r\nsoldier, a sailor, a diplomatist, or a clerk, neither did he reduce\r\nthe appropriations one single cent.  The erratic Mr. David Crockett\r\nwas then a member of the House, but had not attracted public\r\nattention, although the Jackson men were angry because he, one of\r\nOld Hickory's officers in the Creek War, was a devoted adherent of\r\nHenry Clay for the Presidency.  One of his colleagues in the\r\nTennessee delegation was Mr. James K. Polk, a rigid and uncompromising\r\nPresbyterian, a political disciple of Macon, and a man of incorruptible\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\nProminent among the Representatives from the State of New York were\r\nMessrs. Gulian C. Verplanck and Thomas J. Oakley, members of the\r\nlegal profession, who were statesmen rather than politicians.  Mr.\r\nGeorge C. Washington, of Maryland, was the great-nephew of \"the\r\nFather of his country,\" and had inherited a portion of the library\r\nat Mount Vernon, which he subsequently sold to the Boston Athenaeum.\r\nMessrs. Elisha Whittlesey and Samuel Vinton, Representatives from\r\nOhio, were afterwards for many years officers of the Federal\r\nGovernment and residents at Washington.  Mr. Jonathan Hunt, of\r\nVermont, a lawyer of ability, and one of the companions chosen by\r\nMr. Webster, was the father of that gifted artist, William Morris\r\nHunt, whose recent death was so generally regretted.  Mr. Silas\r\nWright, of New York, was then attracting attention in the Democratic\r\nparty, of which he became a great leader, and which would have\r\nelected him President had he not shortened his life by intemperance.\r\nHe was a solid, square-built man, with an impassive, ruddy face.\r\nHe claimed to be a good farmer, but no orator, yet he was noted\r\nfor the compactness of his logic, which was unenlivened by a figure\r\nof speech or a flight of fancy.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court then sat in the room in the basement of the\r\nCapitol, now occupied as a law library.  It has an arched ceiling\r\nsupported by massive pillars that obstruct the view, and is very\r\nbadly ventilated.  But it is rich in traditions of hair-powder,\r\nqueues, ruffled shirts, knee-breeches, and buckles.  Up to that\r\ntime no Justice had ever sat upon the bench in trousers, nor had\r\nany lawyer ventured to plead in boots or wearing whiskers.  Their\r\nHonors, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices, wearing silk\r\njudicial robes, were treated with the most profound respect.  When\r\nMr. Clay stopped, one day, in an argument, and advancing to the\r\nbench, took a pinch of snuff from Judge Washington's box, saying,\r\n\"I perceive that your Honor sticks to the Scotch,\" and then proceeded\r\nwith his case, it excited astonishment and admiration.  \"Sir,\" said\r\nMr. Justice Story, in relating the circumstance to a friends, \"I\r\ndo not believe there is a man in the United States who could have\r\ndone that but Mr. Clay.\"\r\n\r\nChief Justice John Marshall, who had then presided in the Supreme\r\nCourt for more than a quarter of a century, was one of the last\r\nsurvivors of those officers of the Revolutionary Army who had\r\nentered into civil service.  He was a tall, gaunt man, with a small\r\nhead and bright black eyes.  He used to wear an unbrushed long-\r\nskirted black coat, a badly fitting waistcoat, and knee-breeches,\r\na voluminous white cambric cravat, generally soiled, and black\r\nworsted stockings, with low shoes and silver buckles.  When upward\r\nof seventy years of age he still relished the pleasures of the\r\nquoit club or the whist table, and to the last his right hand never\r\nforgot its cunning with the billiard cue.\r\n\r\nNor did the Chief Justice ever lose his relish for a joke, even at\r\nhis own expense.  In the Law Library one day he fell from a step-\r\nladder, bruising himself severely and scattering an armful of books\r\nin all directions.  An attendant, full of alarm, ran to assist him,\r\nbut his Honor drily remarked, \"That time I was completely floored.\"\r\n\r\nBushrod Washington, who had been appointed to the Supreme Court by\r\nPresident John Adams, was by inheritance the owner of Mount Vernon,\r\nwhere his remains now lie, near those of his illustrious uncle,\r\nGeorge Washington.  He was a small, insignificant-looking man,\r\ndeprived of the sight of one eye by excessive study, negligent of\r\ndress, and an immoderate snuff-taker.  He was a rigid disciplinarian\r\nand a great stickler for etiquette, and on one occasion he sat for\r\nsixteen hours without leaving the bench.  He was also a man of rare\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nChristmas was the popular holiday season at Washington sixty years\r\nago, the descendants of the Maryland Catholics joining the descendants\r\nof the Virginia Episcopalians in celebrating the advent of their\r\nLord.  The colored people enjoyed the festive season, and there\r\nwas scarcely a house in Washington in which there was not a well-\r\nfilled punch bowl.  In some antique silver bowls was \"Daniel Webster\r\npunch,\" made of Medford rum, brandy, champagne, arrack, menschino,\r\nstrong green tea, lemon juice, and sugar; in other less expensive\r\nbowls was found a cheaper concoction.  But punch abounded everywhere,\r\nand the bibulous found Washington a rosy place, where jocund mirth\r\nand joyful recklessness went arm in arm to flout vile melancholy,\r\nand kick, with ardent fervor, dull care out of the window.  Christmas\r\ncarols were sung in the streets by the young colored people, and\r\nyule logs were burned in the old houses where the fireplaces had\r\nnot been bricked up.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  With great respect\r\n  I am yrs. v. truly. [?]\r\n  H. Clay\r\nHENRY CLAY, born in Virginia, April 12th, 1777; United States\r\nSenator from Kentucky, 1806-1807, and again 1810-1811; Representative\r\nfrom Kentucky, 1811-1814; negotiator of the treaty of Ghent, 1815;\r\nRepresentative in Congress, 1815-1820, and 1823-1825; Secretary of\r\nState under President Adams, 1825-1829; United States Senator from\r\nKentucky, 1831-1842, and 1844, until he died at Washington City,\r\nJune 29th, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE POLITICAL MACHINE.\r\n\r\nAs the time for another Presidential election approached, the\r\nfriends of General Jackson commenced active operations in his\r\nbehalf.  The prime mover in the campaign was General John Henry\r\nEaton, then a Senator from Tennessee.  He had published in 1818 a\r\nbrief life of the hero of New Orleans, which he enlarged in 1824\r\nand published with the title, \"The Life of Andrew Jackson, Major-\r\nGeneral in the Service of the United States, comprising a History\r\nof the War in the South from the Commencement of the Creek Campaign\r\nto the Termination of Hostilities Before New Orleans.\"  The facts\r\nin it were obtained from General Jackson and his wife, but every\r\nincident of his life calculated to injure him in the public estimation\r\nwas carefully suppressed.  It was, however, the recognized text-\r\nbook for Democratic editors and stump speakers, and although entirely\r\nunreliable, it has formed the basis for the lives of General Jackson\r\nsince published.\r\n\r\nPresident Adams enjoined neutrality upon his friends but some of\r\nthem, acting with Democrats who were opposed to the election of\r\nGeneral Jackson, had published and circulated, as an offset to\r\nGeneral Eaton's book, a thick pamphlet entitled, \"Reminiscences;\r\nor, an Extract from the Catalogue of General Jackson's Youthful\r\nIndiscretions, between the Age of Twenty-three and Sixty,\" which\r\ncontained an account of Jackson's fights, brawls, affrays, and\r\nduels, numbered from one to fourteen.  Broadsides, bordered with\r\nwood-cuts of coffins, and known as \"coffin hand-bills,\" narrated\r\nthe summary and unjust execution as deserters of a number of\r\nmilitiamen in the Florida campaign whose legal term of service had\r\nexpired.  Another handbill gave the account of General Jackson's\r\nmarriage to Mrs. Robards before she had been legally divorced from\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson's friends also had printed and circulated large\r\neditions of campaign songs, the favorite being \"The Hunters of\r\nKentucky,\" which commenced:\r\n\r\n  \"You've heard, I s'pose of New Orleans,\r\n  'Tis famed for youth and beauty,\r\n   There're girls of every hue, it seems,\r\n   From snowy white to sooty,\r\n   Now Packenham had made his brags,\r\n   If he that day was lucky,\r\n   He'd have those girls and cotton-bags\r\n   In spite of old Kentucky.\r\n   But Jackson, he was wide awake,\r\n   And was not scared at trifles,\r\n   For well he knew Kentucky's boys,\r\n   With their death-dealing rifles.\r\n   He led them down to cypress swamp,\r\n   The ground was low and mucky,\r\n   There stood John Bull in martial pomp,\r\n   And here stood old Kentucky.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a political campaign of unprecedented bitterness, General\r\nJackson was elected, receiving one hundred and seventy-eight\r\nelectoral votes against eighty-three cast for John Quincy Adams,\r\nand so a new chapter was commenced in the social as well as the\r\npolitical chronicles of the National Capital.  Those who had known\r\nthe Presidential successors of Washington as educated and cultivated\r\ngentlemen, well versed in the courtesies of private life and of\r\nceremonious statesmanship, saw them succeeded by a military chieftain,\r\nwhose life had been \"a battle and a march,\" thickly studded with\r\npersonal difficulties and duels; who had given repeated evidences\r\nof his disregard of the laws when they stood in the way of his\r\nimperious will; and who, when a United States Senator, had displayed\r\nno ability as a legislator.  His election was notoriously the work\r\nof Martin Van Buren, inspired by Aaron Burr, and with his inauguration\r\nwas initiated a sordidly selfish political system entirely at\r\nvariance with the broad views of Washington and of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that every citizen had his price; that neither virtue\r\nnor genius was proof against clever although selfish corruption;\r\nthat political honestly was a farce; and that the only way of\r\ngoverning those knaves who elbowed their way up through the masses\r\nwas to rule them by cunning more acute than their own and knavery\r\nmore subtle and calculating than theirs.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving his rural home in Tennessee, General Jackson had\r\nbeen afflicted by the sudden death of his wife.  \"Aunt Rachel,\" as\r\nMrs. Jackson was called by her husband's personal friends, had\r\naccompanied him to Washington when he was there as a Senator from\r\nTennessee.  She was a short, stout, unattractive, and uneducated\r\nwoman, though greatly endeared to General Jackson.  While he had\r\nbeen in the army she had carefully managed his plantation, his\r\nslaves, and his money matters, and her devotion to him knew no\r\nbounds.  Her happiness was centered in his, and it was her chief\r\ndesire to smoke her corn-cob pipe in peace at his side.  When told\r\nthat he had been elected President of the United States, she replied,\r\n\"Well, for Mr. Jackson's sake I am glad of it, but for myself I am\r\nnot.\"  A few weeks later she was arrayed for the grave in a white\r\nsatin costume which she had provided herself with to wear at the\r\nWhite House.  After her funeral her sorrow-stricken husband came\r\nto Washington with a stern determination to punish those who had\r\nmaligned her during the preceding campaign.  Having been told that\r\nPresident Adams had sanctioned the publication of the slanders, he\r\ndid not call at the White House, in accordance with the usage, but\r\npaid daily visits to old friends in the War Department.  Mr. Adams,\r\nstung by this neglect, determined not to play the part of the\r\nconquered leader of the inauguration, and quietly removed to the\r\nhouse of Commodore Porter, in the suburbs, on the morning of the\r\n3d of March.\r\n\r\nThe weather on the 4th of March, 1829, was serene and mild, and at\r\nan early hour Pennsylvania Avenue, then unpaved, with a double row\r\nof poplar trees along its centre, was filled with crowds of people,\r\nmany of whom had journeyed immense distances on foot.  The officials\r\nat Washington, who were friends of Mr. Adams, had agreed not to\r\nparticipate in the inaugural ceremonies, and the only uniformed\r\ncompany of light infantry, commanded by Colonel Seaton, of the\r\n_National Intelligencer_, had declined to offer its services as an\r\nescort.  A number of old Revolutionary officers, however, had\r\nhastily organized themselves, and waited on General Jackson to\r\nsolicit the honor of forming his escort to the Capitol, an offer\r\nwhich was cordially accepted.  The General rode in an open carriage\r\nwhich had been placed at his disposal, and was surrounded by these\r\ngallant veterans.  The assembled thousands cheered lustily as their\r\nfavorite passed along, every face radiant with defiant joy, and\r\nevery voice shouting \"Hurrah for Jackson!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the installation of John C. Calhoun as Vice-President in the\r\nSenate Chamber, the assembled dignitaries moved in procession\r\nthrough the rotunda to the east front of the Capitol.  As the tall\r\nfigure of the President-elect came out upon the portico and ascended\r\nthe platform, uplifted hats and handkerchiefs waved a welcome, and\r\nshouts of \"Hurrah for Jackson!\" rent the air.  Looking around for\r\na moment into ten thousand upturned and exultant human faces, the\r\nPresident-elect removed his hat, took the manuscript of his address\r\nfrom his pocket, and read it with great dignity.  When he had\r\nfinished, Chief Justice Marshall administered the oath, and as the\r\nPresident, bending over the sacred Book, touched it with his lips,\r\nthere arose such a shout as was never before heard in Washington,\r\nfollowed by the thunder of cannons, from two light batteries near\r\nby, echoed by the cannon at the Navy Yard and at the Arsenal.  The\r\ncrowd surged toward the platform, and had it not been that a ship's\r\ncable had been stretched across the portico steps would have captured\r\ntheir beloved leader.  As it was, he shook hands with hundreds,\r\nand it was with some difficulty that he could be escorted back to\r\nhis carriage and along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Adams, who had refused to participate in the pageant,\r\nwas taking his usual constitutional horseback exercise when the\r\nthunders of the cannon reached his ears and notified him that he\r\nwas again a private citizen.\r\n\r\nThe broad sidewalks of Pennsylvania Avenue were again packed as\r\nthe procession returned from the Capitol.  \"I never saw such a\r\ncrowd,\" wrote Daniel Webster to a friend.  \"Persons have come five\r\nhundred miles to see General Jackson, and they really seem to think\r\nthat the country is rescued from some dreadful danger.\"  Hunters\r\nof Kentucky and Indian fighters of Tennessee, with sturdy frontiersmen\r\nfrom the Northwest, were mingled in the throng with the more cultured\r\ndwellers on the Atlantic slope.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the White House, the motley crowd clamored for\r\nrefreshments and soon drained the barrels of punch, which had been\r\nprepared, in drinking to the health of the new Chief Magistrate.\r\nA great deal of china and glassware was broken, and the East Room\r\nwas filled with a noisy mob.  At one time General Jackson, who had\r\nretreated until he stood with his back against the wall, was\r\nprotected by a number of his friends, who formed a living barrier\r\nabout him.  Such a scene had never before been witnessed at the\r\nWhite House, and the aristocratic old Federalists saw, to their\r\ndisgust, men whose boots were covered with the red mud of the\r\nunpaved streets standing on the damask satin-covered chairs to get\r\na sight at the President of their choice.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon President Jackson sat down to dinner with\r\nVice-President Calhoun and a party of his personal friends, the\r\ncentral dish on the table being a sirloin from a prize ox, sent to\r\nhim by John Merkle, a butcher of Franklin Market, New York.  Before\r\nretiring that night, the President wrote to the donor:  \"Permit\r\nme, sir, to assure you of the gratification which I felt in being\r\nenabled to place on my table so fine a specimen of your market,\r\nand to offer you my sincere thanks for so acceptable a token of\r\nyour regard for my character.\"  This was the commencement of a\r\nseries of presents which poured in on General Jackson during the\r\neight years of his administration.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic journalists of the country were also well represented\r\nat the inauguration, attracted by this semi-official declaration\r\nin the _Telegraph_:  \"We know not what line of policy General\r\nJackson will adopt.  We take it for granted, however, that he will\r\nreward his friends and punish his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader of this editorial phalanx was Amos Kendall, a native of\r\nDunstable, Massachusetts, who had by pluck and industry acquired\r\nan education and migrated westward in search of fame and fortune.\r\nAccident made him an inmate of Henry Clay's house and the tutor of\r\nhis children; but many months had not elapsed before the two became\r\npolitical foes, and Kendall, who had become the conductor of a\r\nDemocratic newspaper, triumphed, bringing to Washington the official\r\nvote of Kentucky for Andrew Jackson.  He found at the National\r\nmetropolis other Democratic editors, who, like himself, had labored\r\nto bring about the political revolution, and they used to meet\r\ndaily in the house of a preacher-politician, Rev. Obadiah B. Brown,\r\nwho had strongly advocated Jackson's election.  Mr. Brown, who was\r\na stout, robust man, with a great fund of anecdotes, was a clerk\r\nin the Post Office department during the week, while on Sundays he\r\nperformed his ministerial duties in the Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nOrganizing under the lead of Amos Kendall, whose lieutenants were\r\nthe brilliant but vindictive Isaac Hill, of New Hampshire; the\r\nscholarly Nathaniel Greene, of Massachusetts; the conservative\r\nGideon Welles, of Connecticut; the jovial Major Mordecai M. Noah,\r\nof New York, and the energetic Dabney S. Carr, of Maryland, the\r\nallied editors claimed their rewards.  They were not to be appeased\r\nby sops of Government advertising, or by the appointment of publisher\r\nof the laws of the United States in the respective States, but they\r\ndemanded some of the most lucrative public offices in their share\r\nof the spoils.  No sooner did General Jackson reach Washington then\r\nthey made a systematic attack upon him, introducing and praising\r\none another, and reciprocally magnifying their faithful services\r\nduring the canvass so successfully ended.  The result was that soon\r\nafter the inauguration nearly fifty of those editors who had\r\nadvocated his election were appointed to official Federal positions\r\nas rewards for political services rendered.\r\n\r\nUp to that time the national elections in the United States had\r\nnot been mere contests for the possession of Federal offices--there\r\nwas victory and there was defeat; but the quadrennial encounters\r\naffected only the heads of departments, and the results were matters\r\nof comparative indifference to the subordinate official drudges\r\nwhose families depended on their pay for meat and bread.  A few of\r\nthese department clerks were Revolutionary worthies; others had\r\nfollowed the Federal Government from New York or Philadelphia; all\r\nhad expected to hold their positions for life.  Some of these desk-\r\nslaves had originally been Federalists, others Democrats; and while\r\nthere was always an Alexander Hamilton in every family of the one\r\nset, there was as invariably a Thomas Jefferson in every family of\r\nthe other set.  But no subordinate clerk had ever been troubled on\r\naccount of his political faith by a change of the Administration,\r\nand the sons generally succeeded their fathers when they died or\r\nresigned.  Ordinarily, these clerks were good penmen and skillful\r\naccountants, toiling industriously eight hours every week day\r\nwithout dreaming of demanding a month's vacation in the summer, or\r\ninsisting upon their right to go to their homes to vote in the\r\nfall.  National politics was to them a matter of profound indifference\r\nuntil, after the inauguration of General Jackson, hundreds of them\r\nfound themselves decapitated by the Democratic guillotine, without\r\nqualifications for any other employment had the limited trade of\r\nWashington afforded any.  Many of them were left in a pitiable\r\ncondition, but when the _Telegraph_ was asked what these men could\r\ndo to ward off starvation, the insolent reply was, \"Root, hog, or\r\ndie!\"  Some of the new political brooms swept clean, and made a\r\ngreat show of reform, notably Amos Kendall, who was appointed Fourth\r\nAuditor of the Treasury, and who soon after exulted over the\r\ndiscovery of a defalcation of a few hundred dollars in the accounts\r\nof his predecessor, Dr. Tobias Watkins.\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General McLean, of Ohio, who had been avowedly a Jackson\r\nman while he was a member of Mr. Adams' Administration, rebelled\r\nagainst the removal of several of his most efficient subordinates,\r\nbecause of their political action during the preceding Presidential\r\ncampaign.  At last he flatly told General Jackson that if he must\r\nremove those postmasters who had taken an active part in politics,\r\nhe should impartially turn out those who had worked to secure the\r\nelection of General Jackson, as well as those who had labored to\r\nre-elect Mr. Adams.  To his General Jackson at first made no reply,\r\nbut rose from his seat, puffing away at his pipe; and after walking\r\nup and down the floor two or three times, he stopped in front of\r\nhis rebellious Postmaster-General, and said, \"Mr. McLean, will you\r\naccept a seat upon the bench of the Supreme Court?\"  The judicial\r\nposition thus tendered was accepted with thanks, and the Post-Office\r\nDepartment was placed under the direction of Major Barry, who was\r\ninvited to take a seat in the Cabinet (never occupied by his\r\npredecessors), and who not only made the desired removals and\r\nappointments, but soon plunged the finances of the Department into\r\na chaotic state of disorder.\r\n\r\nProminent among those \"Jackson men\" who received lucrative mail\r\ncontracts from Postmaster-General Barry, was \"Land Admiral\" Reeside,\r\nan appellation he owed to the executive ability which he had\r\ndisplayed in organizing mail routes between distant cities.  He\r\nwas a very tall man, well formed, with florid complexion, red hair,\r\nand side whiskers.  Very obligingly, he once had a horse belonging\r\nto a Senator taken from Pittsburg to Washington tied behind a stage,\r\nbecause the owner had affixed his \"frank\" to the animal's halter.\r\nHe was the first mail contractor who ran his stages between\r\nPhiladelphia and the West, by night as well as by day, and Mr.\r\nJoseph R. Chandler, of the United States _Gazette_, said that \"the\r\nAdmiral could leave Philadelphia on a six-horse coach with a hot\r\njohnny-cake in his pocket and reach Pittsburg before it could grow\r\ncold.\"  He used to ridicule the locomotives when they were first\r\nintroduced, and offer to bet a thousand dollars that no man could\r\nbuild a machine that would drag a stage from Washington to Baltimore\r\nquicker than his favorite team of iron-grays.\r\n\r\nMail robberies were not uncommon in those days, although the crime\r\nwas punishable with imprisonment or death.  One day one of Reeside's\r\ncoaches was stopped near Philadelphia by three armed men, who\r\nordered the nine passengers to alight and stand in a line.  One of\r\nthe robbers then mounted guard, while the other two made the\r\nterrified passengers deliver up their money and watches, and then\r\nrifled the mail bags.  They were soon afterward arrested, tried,\r\nconvicted, and one was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary,\r\nwhile the other two were condemned to be hung.  Fortunately for\r\none of the culprits, named Wilson, he had some years previously,\r\nat a horse-race near Nashville, Tennessee, privately advised General\r\nJackson to withdraw his bets on a horse which he was backing, as\r\nthe jockey had been ordered to lose the race.  The General was very\r\nthankful for this information, which enabled him to escape a heavy\r\nloss, and he promised his informant that he would befriend him\r\nwhenever an opportunity should offer.  When reminded of this promise,\r\nafter Wilson had been sentenced to be hanged, Jackson promptly\r\ncommuted the sentence to ten years imprisonment in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nWhen Admiral Reeside was carrying the mails between New York and\r\nWashington, there arose a formidable organization in opposition to\r\nthe Sunday mail service.  The members of several religious\r\ndenominations were prominent in their demonstrations, and in\r\nPhiladelphia, chains, secured by padlocks, were stretched across\r\nthe streets on Sundays to prevent the passage of the mail-coaches.\r\nThe subject was taken up by politicians, and finally came before\r\nthe House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee\r\non Post-Roads, of which Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, was then\r\nthe chairman.  The Rev. Obadiah B. Brown, who had meanwhile been\r\npromoted in the Post-office Department, wrote a report on the\r\nsubject for Colonel Johnson, which gave \"the killer of Tecumseh\"\r\nan extended reputation, and was the first step toward his election\r\nas Vice-President, a few years later.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  J. C. Calhoun\r\nJOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN was born in South Carolina, March 18th, 1782:\r\nwas a Representative in Congress, 1811-1817; Secretary of War, 1817-\r\n1825; Vice-President, 1825-1832; United States Senator, 1833-1843;\r\nSecretary of State, 1844-1845; United States Senator from 1845\r\nuntil his death at Washington City, March 31st, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE KITCHEN CABINET.\r\n\r\nWhen the Twenty-first Congress assembled, on the 7th of December,\r\n1829, General Jackson sent in his first annual message, which\r\nnaturally attracted some attention.  Meeting his old and intimate\r\nfriend, General Armstrong, the next day, the President said, \"Well,\r\nBob, what do the people say of my message?\"  \"They say,\" replied\r\nGeneral Armstrong, \"that it is first-rate, but nobody believes that\r\nyou wrote it.\"  \"Well,\" good-naturedly replied Old Hickory, \"don't\r\nI deserve just as much credit for picking out the man who could\r\nwrite it?\"  Although the words of this and of the subsequent messages\r\nwere not General Jackson's, the ideas were, and he always insisted\r\non having them clearly expressed.  It was in his first message, by\r\nthe way, that he invited the attention of Congress to the fact that\r\nthe charter of the United States bank would expire in 1836, and\r\nasserted that it had \"failed in the great end of establishing a\r\nuniform and sound currency.\"  This was the beginning of that fierce\r\npolitical contest which resulted in the triumph of General Jackson\r\nand the overthrow of the United States Bank.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson rarely left the White House, where he passed the\r\ngreater portion of his time in his office in the second story, smoking\r\na corn-cob pipe with a long reed stem.  He was at the commencement\r\nof his Presidential term sixty-two years of age, tall, spare, with\r\na high forehead, from which his gray hair was brushed back, a\r\ndecisive nose, searching, keen eyes, and, when good-natured, an\r\nalmost childlike expression about his mouth.  A self-reliant,\r\nprejudiced, and often very irascible old man, it was a very difficult\r\ntask to manage him.  Some of his Cabinet advisers made it a point\r\nto be always with him, to prevent others from ingratiating themselves\r\ninto his good will, and they were thus chronicled in a ballad of\r\nthe time:\r\n\r\n  \"King Andrew had five trusty 'squires,\r\n   Whom he held his bid to do;\r\n   He also had three pilot-fish,\r\n   To give the sharks their cue.\r\n   There was Mat and Lou and Jack and Lev,\r\n   And Roger, of Taney hue,\r\n   And Blair, the book,\r\n   And Kendall, chief cook,\r\n   And Isaac, surnamed the true.\"\r\n\r\nMat. Van Buren was Secretary of State, Lou. McLane Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, John Branch was Secretary of the Navy, Lev. Woodbury\r\nwas his successor, and Roger B. Taney was Attorney-General.  Blair,\r\nKendall, and Isaac Hill were also known as \"the kitchen cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThe confidential advisers of General Jackson lost no time in\r\nestablishing a daily newspaper which would speak his sentiments\r\nand sound a key-note for the guidance of his followers.  The\r\n_Washington Globe_ was accordingly started on an immense paying\r\nbasis, as it had the name of every Federal office-holder whose\r\nsalary exceeded one thousand dollars on its subscription list.\r\nThe paper was sent them, and in due time the bill for a year.  If\r\na remittance was made, well and good; if payment was refused, the\r\ndelinquent was told informally that he could pay his subscription\r\nto the _Globe_, or be replaced by some one else who would pay it.\r\nIt was owned and edited by Blair & Rives, Rives attending to the\r\nbusiness department of the establishment.  Mr. Blair had been the\r\npartner of Amos Kendall in the publication of the Frankfort _Argus_,\r\nand they had both deserted Henry Clay when they enlisted in the\r\nmovement which gave the electoral vote of Kentucky to General\r\nJackson, and joined in the cry of \"bargain and corruption\" raised\r\nagainst their former friend.  It is related that the first interview\r\nbetween Clay and Blair after this desertion was a very awkward one\r\nfor the latter, who felt that he had behaved shabbily.  Clay had\r\nridden over on horseback from Lexington to Frankfort, in the winter\r\nseason, on legal business, and on alighting from his horse at the\r\ntavern door he found himself confronting Blair, who was just leaving\r\nthe house.  \"How do you do, Mr. Blair?\" inquired the great commoner,\r\nin his silvery tones and blandest manner, at the same time extending\r\nhis hand.  Blair mechanically took the tendered hand, but was\r\nevidently nonplussed, and at length said, with an evident effort,\r\n\"Pretty well, I thank you, sir.  How did you find the roads from\r\nLexington to here?\"  \"The roads are very bad, Mr. Blair,\" graciously\r\nreplied Clay, \"very bad; and I wish, sir, that you would mend your\r\nways.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blair made it a rule to defend in the columns of the _Globe_\r\nthe acts of Jackson's Administration, right or wrong, and he waged\r\nmerciless warfare against those who opposed them.  When Colonel\r\nWilliam R. King, of Alabama, once begged him to soften an attack\r\nupon an erring Democrat, Mr. Blair replied, \"No! let it tear his\r\nheart out.\"  With all his political insolence, however, he possessed\r\nremarkable kindness, and a more indulgent father was never known\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Washington papers, up to this time, contained very little of\r\nwhat has since been known as local news.  A parade, an inauguration,\r\nor the funeral of a distinguished person would receive brief mention,\r\nbut the pleasant gossip of the day was entirely ignored.  It was\r\nthen necessary for the correspondent of a paper in a northern city\r\nto mail his letter at the post-office before twelve o'clock at\r\nnight to insure its departure by the early morning's mail northward.\r\nLetters written to New York did not, consequently, appear until\r\nthe second day after they were written, while those sent to Boston\r\nrarely appeared before the fourth day.  The people then were better\r\nposted as to what transpired at the Nation's Capital than they are\r\nnow, when dispatches can be sent in a few moments at any time of\r\nday or night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anne Royall began an enterprise in personal literature.  She\r\nmanaged to secure an old Ramage printing-press and a font of battered\r\nlong-primer type, with which, aided by runaway apprentices and\r\ntramping journeymen printers, she published, on Capitol Hill, for\r\nseveral years, a small weekly sheet called the _Huntress_.  Every\r\nperson of any distinction who visited Washington received a call\r\nfrom Mrs. Royall, and if they subscribed for the _Huntress_ they\r\nwere described in the next number in a complimentary manner, but\r\nif they declined she abused them without mercy.  When young she\r\nwas a short, plump, and not bad-looking woman, but as she advanced\r\nin years her flesh disappeared, and her nose seemed to increase in\r\nsize; but her piercing black eyes lost none of their fire, while\r\nher tongue wagged more abusively when her temper was roused.  John\r\nQuincy Adams described her as going about \"like a virago-errant in\r\nenchanted armor, redeeming herself from the cramps of indigence by\r\nthe notoriety of her eccentricities and the forced currency they\r\ngave to her publications.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Royall's tongue at last became so unendurable that she was\r\nformally indicted by the Grand Jury as a common scold, and was\r\ntried in the Circuit Court before Judge Cranch.  His Honor charged\r\nthe jury at length, reviewing the testimony and showing that, if\r\nfound guilty, she must be ducked, in accordance with the English\r\nlaw in force in the District of Columbia.  The jury found her\r\nguilty, but her counsel begged his Honor, the Judge, to weigh the\r\nmatter and not be the first to introduce a ducking-stool.  The plea\r\nprevailed and she was let off with a fine.\r\n\r\nThe first \"Society Letters,\" as they were called, written from\r\nWashington, were by Nathaniel P. Willis, to the New York _Mirror_.\r\nWillis was at that time a foppish, slender young man, with a\r\nprofusion of curly, light hair, and was always dressed in the height\r\nof fashion.  He had, while traveling in Europe, mingled with the\r\naristocratic classes, and he affected to look down upon the masses;\r\nbut with all his snobbishness he had a wonderful faculty for endowing\r\ntrifling occurrences with interest, and his letters have never been\r\nsurpassed.  He possessed a sunny nature, full of poetry, enthusiasm,\r\nand cheerfulness, and was always willing to say a pleasant word\r\nfor those who treated him kindly, and never sought to retaliate on\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\nWillis first introduced steel pens at Washington, having brought\r\nover from England some of those made by Joseph Gillott, at Birmingham.\r\nBefore this goose-quill pens had been exclusively used, and there\r\nwas in each House of Congress and in each Department a penmaker,\r\nwho knew what degree of flexibility and breadth of point each writer\r\ndesired.  Every gentleman had to carry a penknife, and to have in\r\nhis desk a hone to sharpen it on, giving the finishing touches on\r\none of his boots.  Another new invention of that epoch was the\r\nlucifer match-box, which superseded the large tin tinder-box with\r\nits flint and steel.  The matches were in the upper portion of a\r\npasteboard case about an inch in diameter and six inches in length\r\nand in a compartment beneath them was a bottle containing a chemical\r\npreparation, into which the brimstone-coated end of the match was\r\ndipped and thus ignited.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Washington, during a portion of the Jackson Administration,\r\nwas Peter Force, a noble specimen of those who, before the existence\r\nof trades unions, used to serve an apprenticeship to the \"art\r\npreservative of arts,\" and graduate from the printing office\r\nqualified to fill any political position.  Fond of American history,\r\nMr. Force, while printing the _Biennial Register_, better known as\r\nthe Blue Book from the color of its binding, began to collect\r\nmanuscripts, books, and pamphlets, many of which had been thrown\r\naway in the executive departments as rubbish, and were purchased\r\nby him from the dealers in waste paper.  In 1833 he originated the\r\nidea of compiling and publishing a documentary history of the\r\ncountry, under the title of the _American Archives_, and issued a\r\nnumber of large folio volumes, the profits going to the politicians\r\nwho secured the necessary appropriations from Congress.  He was\r\nemphatically a gentleman--tall, stalwart, with bushy black hair,\r\nand large, expressive eyes, which would beam with joy whenever a\r\nfriend brought him a rare autograph or pamphlet.\r\n\r\nAssemblies were held once a week between Christmas Day and Ash\r\nWednesday, to which all of the respectable ladies of the city who\r\ndanced were invited.  It was also customary for those of the Cabinet\r\nofficers and other high officials who kept house to give at least\r\none evening party during each session of Congress, invitations for\r\nwhich were issued.  The guests at these parties used to assemble\r\nat about eight o'clock, and after taking off their wraps in an\r\nupper room they descended to the parlor, where the host and hostess\r\nreceived them.  The older men then went to the punch-bowl to\r\ncriticise the \"brew\" which it contained, while the young people\r\nfound their way to the dining-room, almost invariably devoted to\r\ndancing.  The music was a piano and two violins, and one of the\r\nmusicians called the figures for the cotillions and contra-dances.\r\nThose who did not dance elbowed their way through the crowd,\r\nconversing with acquaintances, the men frequently taking another\r\nglass of punch.  At ten the guests were invited to the supper-table,\r\nwhich was often on the wide back porch which every Washington house\r\nhad in those days.  The table was always loaded with evidences of\r\nthe culinary skill of the lady of the house.  There was a roast\r\nham at one end, a saddle of venison or mutton at the other end,\r\nand some roasted poultry or wild ducks midway; a great variety of\r\nhome-baked cake was a source of pride, and there was never any lack\r\nof punch, with decanters of Madeira.  The diplomats gave champagne,\r\nbut it was seldom seen except at the legations.  At eleven there\r\nwas a general exodus, and after the usual scramble for hats, cloaks,\r\nand over-shoes the guests entered their carriages.  Sometimes a\r\nfew intimate friends of the hostess lingered to enjoy a contra-\r\ndance or to take a parting drink of punch, but by midnight the last\r\nguest departed, and the servants began to blow out the candles with\r\nwhich the house had been illuminated.\r\n\r\nIn Jackson's first Administration the country was shocked by the\r\nappearance of a book entitled, _The Domestic Manners of Americans_,\r\nby Mrs. Frances Trollope.  She was a bright little Englishwoman,\r\nwho had come to this country and established a bazaar at Cincinnati,\r\nwhich proved a failure.  So she sought revenge and wealth by a\r\ncaricature sketch of our pioneer life, founded on fact, but very\r\nunpalatable.  Expectoration was her pet abomination, and she was\r\ninclined to think that this \"most vile and universal habit of\r\nchewing tobacco\" was the cause of a remarkable peculiarity in the\r\nmale physiognomy of Americans, the almost uniform thinness and\r\ncompression of their lips.  So often did Mrs. Trollope recur to\r\nthis habit that she managed to give one the impression that this\r\ncountry was in those days a sort of huge spittoon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trollope first called attention to the fact that American\r\nwomen did not consult the season in either the colors or style of\r\ntheir costumes, never wore boots, and walked in the middle of winter\r\nwith their pretty little feet pinched into miniature slippers\r\nincapable of excluding as much moisture as might bedew a primrose.\r\n\r\nRemovals from office that places might be provided for Jackson men\r\nwere the order of the day, but President Jackson was not disposed\r\nto displace any veteran soldier.  Among other victims designated\r\nfor removal by the politicians was General Solomon Van Rensselaer,\r\nwhose gallant services against Great Britain in the War of 1812\r\nhad been rewarded by an election to the House of Representatives,\r\nfollowed by his appointment as Postmaster of Albany.  He was a\r\ndecided Federalist and the petition for his removal was headed by\r\nMartin Van Buren and Silas Wright.\r\n\r\nVisiting Washington, General Van Rensselaer received a cordial\r\ngreeting from General Jackson at a public reception, and then,\r\ntaking a seat in a corner, he waited until the room was cleared,\r\nwhen he again approached the President, saying:  \"General Jackson,\r\nI have come here to talk to you about my office.  The politicians\r\nwant to take it from me, and they know I have nothing else to live\r\non.\"  The President made no reply, till the aged Postmaster began\r\nto take off his coat in the most excited manner, when Old Hickory\r\nbroke out with the inquiry:  \"What in Heaven's name are you going\r\nto do?  Why do you take off your coat here?\"  \"Well, sir, I am\r\ngoing to show you my wounds, which I received in fighting for my\r\ncountry against the English!\"  \"Put it on at once, sir!\" was the\r\nreply; \"I am surprised that a man of your age should make such an\r\nexhibition of himself,\" and the eyes of the iron President were\r\nsuffused with tears, as, without another word, he bade his ancient\r\nfoe good evening.\r\n\r\nThe next day Messrs. Van Buren and Wright called at the White House\r\nand were shown up into the President's room, where they found him\r\nsmoking a clay pipe.  Mr. Wright soon commenced to solicit the\r\nremoval of General Van Rensselaer, asserting that he had been known\r\nas a very active advocate of John Quincy Adams; that he had literally\r\nforfeited his place by his earnest opposition to the Jackson men,\r\nand that if he were not removed the new Administration would be\r\nseriously injured.  He had hardly finished the last sentence, when\r\nJackson sprang to his feet, flung his pipe into the fire, and\r\nexclaimed with great vehemence, \"I take the consequences, sir; I\r\ntake the consequences.  By the Eternal!  I will not remove the old\r\nman--I cannot remove him.  Why, Mr. Wright, do you not know that\r\nhe carries more than a pound of British lead in his body?\"  That\r\nsettled the question, and General Van Rensselaer remained undisturbed\r\nas Postmaster at Albany through the Jackson Administration, although\r\nMartin Van Buren, when he came into power, promptly \"bounced\" him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson's defiant disposition was manifested when, in a\r\nmessage to Congress, he recommended that a law be passed authorizing\r\nreprisals upon French property in case provision should not be made\r\nfor the payment of the long-standing claims against France at the\r\napproaching session of the French Chambers.  Some of his Cabinet,\r\nhaving deemed this language too strong, had prevailed upon the\r\nPresident's private secretary, Major Donelson, to modify it, and\r\nto make it less irritating and menacing.  No sooner was it discovered\r\nby General Jackson than he flew into a great excitement, and when\r\nMr. Rives entered his private office to obtain it for printing, he\r\nfound the old General busily engaged in re-writing it according to\r\nthe original copy.  \"I know them French,\" said he.  \"They won't\r\npay unless they're made to.\"\r\n\r\nThe French people were indignant when this message reached Paris,\r\nand when the Chamber of Deputies finally provided for the payment\r\nof the claims, a proviso was inserted ordering the money to be\r\nwithheld until the President of the United States had apologized\r\nfor the language used.  This General Jackson flatly refused to do,\r\nand the \"Ancient Allies\" of the Revolution were on the verge of\r\nhostilities, when both nations agreed to submit their differences\r\nto Great Britain.  The affair was speedily arranged, and France\r\npaid five millions of dollars for French spoilations into the\r\nTreasury of the United States, where it has since remained.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Silas Wright Jr.\r\nSILAS WRIGHT, JR., was born at Amherst, Massachusetts, May 24th,\r\n1795; was a Representative from New York in Congress, 1827-1829;\r\nComptroller of New York, 1829-1833; United States Senator, 1833-\r\n1844; Governor of New York, 1844-1846; retired to his farm at\r\nCanton, New York, and died there, August 27th, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nBATTLE OF THE GIANTS.\r\n\r\nAn unimportant resolution concerning the public lands, introduced\r\ninto the Senate early in 1830 by Senator Foote, of Connecticut (the\r\nfather of Admiral Foote), led to a general debate, which has been\r\nsince known as \"the battle of the giants.\"  The discussion embraced\r\nall the partisan issues of the time, especially those of a sectional\r\nnature, including the alleged rights of a State to set the Federal\r\nGovernment at defiance.  The State Rights men in South Carolina,\r\ninstigated by Mr. Calhoun, had been active during the preceding\r\nsummer in collecting material for this discussion, and they had\r\ntaken especial pains to request a search for evidence that Mr.\r\nWebster had shown a willingness to have New England secede from\r\nthe Union during the second war with Great Britain.  The vicinity\r\nof Portsmouth, where he had resided when he entered public life,\r\nwas, to use his own words, \"searched as with a candle.  New Hampshire\r\nwas explored from the mouth of the Merrimack to the White Hills.\"\r\n\r\nNor had Mr. Webster been idle.  He was not an extemporaneous speaker,\r\nand he passed the summer in carefully studying, in his intervals\r\nof professional duties, the great constitutional question which he\r\nafterward so brilliantly discussed.  A story is told at Providence\r\nabout a distinguished lawyer of that place--Mr. John Whipple--who\r\nwas at Washington when Webster replied to Hayne, but who did not\r\nhear the speech, as he was engaged in a case before the Supreme\r\nCourt when it was delivered.  When a report of what Mr. Webster\r\nhad said appeared in print, Mr. Whipple read it, and was haunted\r\nby the idea that he had heard or read it before.  Meeting Mr.\r\nWebster soon afterward, he mentioned this idea to him and inquired\r\nwhether it could possibly have any foundation in fact.  \"Certainly\r\nit has,\" replied Mr. Webster.  \"Don't you remember our conversations\r\nduring the long walks we took together last summer at Newport,\r\nwhile in attendance on Story's court?\"  It flashed across Mr.\r\nWhipple's mind that Mr. Webster had then rehearsed the legal argument\r\nof his speech and had invited criticism.\r\n\r\nAs the debate on the Foote resolution progressed, it revealed an\r\nevident intention to attack New England, and especially Massachusetts.\r\nThis brought Mr. Webster into the arena, and he concluded a brief\r\nspeech by declaring that, as a true representative of the State\r\nwhich had sent him into the Senate, it was his duty and a duty\r\nwhich he should fulfill, to place her history and her conduct, her\r\nhonor and her character, in their just and proper light.  A few\r\ndays later, Mr. Webster heard his State and himself mercilessly\r\nattacked by General Hayne, of South Carolina, no mean antagonist.\r\nThe son of a Revolutionary hero who had fallen a victim to British\r\ncruelty, highly educated, with a slender, graceful form, fascinating\r\ndeportment, and a well-trained, mellifluous voice, the haughty\r\nSouth Carolinian entered the lists of the political tournament like\r\nSaladin to oppose the Yankee Coeur de Lion.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster went to the Senate Chamber to reply to General\r\nHayne, on Tuesday, January 20th, 1830, he felt himself master of\r\nthe situation.  Always careful about his personal appearance when\r\nhe was to address an audience, he wore on that day the Whig uniform,\r\nwhich had been copied by the Revolutionary heroes--a blue dress-\r\ncoat with bright buttons, a buff waistcoat, and a high, white\r\ncravat.  Neither was he insensible to the benefits to be derived\r\nfrom publicity, and he had sent a request to Mr. Gales to report\r\nwhat he was to say himself, rather than to send one of his\r\nstenographers.  The most graphic account of the scene in the Senate\r\nChamber during the delivery of the speech was subsequently written\r\nvirtually from Mr. Webster's dictation.  Perhaps, like Mr. Healy's\r\npicture of the scene, it is rather high-colored.\r\n\r\nSheridan, after his forty days' preparation, did not commence his\r\nscathing impeachment of Warren Hastings with more confidence that\r\nwas displayed by Mr. Webster when he stood up, in the pride of his\r\nmanhood, and began to address the interested mass of talent,\r\nintelligence, and beauty around him.  A man of commanding presence,\r\nwith a well-knit, sturdy frame, swarthy features, a broad, thoughtful\r\nforehead, courageous eyes gleaming from beneath shaggy eyebrows,\r\na quadrangular breadth of jawbone, and a mouth which bespoke strong\r\nwill, he stood like a sturdy Roundhead sentinel on guard before\r\nthe gates of the Constitution.  Holding in profound contempt what\r\nhe termed spread-eagle oratory, his only gesticulations were up-and-\r\ndown motions of his arm, as if he were beating out with sledge-\r\nhammers his forcible ideas.  His peroration was sublime, and every\r\nloyal American heart has since echoed the last words, \"Liberty and\r\nunion--now and forever--one and inseparable!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's speech, carefully revised by himself, was not published\r\nuntil the 23d of February, and large editions of it were circulated\r\nthroughout the Northern States.  The debate was continued, and it\r\nwas the 21st of May before Colonel Benton, who had been the first\r\ndefamer of New England, brought it to a close.  The Northern men\r\nclaimed for Mr. Webster the superiority, but General Jackson praised\r\nthe speech of Mr. Hayne, and deemed his picture worthy to occupy\r\na place in the White House, thus giving expression to the general\r\nsentiment among the Southerners.  This alarmed Mr. Van Buren, who\r\nwas quietly yet shrewdly at work to defeat the further advancement\r\nof Mr. Calhoun, and he lost no time in demonstrating to the imperious\r\nold soldier who occupied the Presidential chair that the South\r\nCarolina doctrine of nullification could but prove destructive to\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was not aware of this intrigue, and, in order to\r\nstrengthen his State Rights policy, he organized a public dinner\r\non the anniversary of Jefferson's birthday, April 13th, 1830.  When\r\nthe toasts which were to be proposed were made public in advance,\r\naccording to the custom, it was discovered that several of them\r\nwere strongly anti-tariff and State Rights in sentiment--so much\r\nso that a number of Pennsylvania tariff Democrats declined to\r\nattend, and got up a dinner of their own.  General Jackson attended\r\nthe dinner, but he went late and retired early, leaving a volunteer\r\ntoast, which he had carefully prepared at the White House, and\r\nwhich fell like a damper upon those at the dinner, while it\r\nelectrified the North, \"The Federal Union--it must and shall be\r\nmaintained!\"  This toast, which could not be misunderstood, showed\r\nthat General Jackson would not permit himself to be placed in the\r\nattitude of a patron of doctrines which could lead only to a\r\ndissolution of the Federal Government.  But the Committee on\r\nArrangements toned it down, so that it appeared in the official\r\nreport of the dinner, \"Our Federal Union--it must be preserved!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a severe blow to Mr. Calhoun, who had labored earnestly\r\nto break down Mr. Adams' Administration, without respect to its\r\nmeasures, that a Democratic party might be built up which would\r\nfirst elect General Jackson, and then recognize Calhoun as legitimate\r\nsuccessor to the Presidential chair.  His discomfiture was soon\r\ncompleted by the publication of a letter from Mr. Crawford, which\r\ninformed the President that Calhoun, when in the Cabinet of Monroe,\r\nproposed that \"General Jackson should be punished in some form\"\r\nfor his high-handed military rule in Florida.  Van Buren secretly\r\nfanned the flames of General Jackson's indignation, and adroitly\r\navailed himself of a \"tempest in a tea-pot\" to complete the downfall\r\nof his rival.\r\n\r\nThe woman used as a tool by Mr. Van Buren for the overthrow of Mr.\r\nCalhoun's political hopes was a picturesque and prominent figure\r\nin Washington society then and during the next fifty years.  The\r\nNational Metropolis in those days resembled, as has been well said,\r\nin recklessness and extravagance, the spirit of the English\r\nseventeenth century, so graphically portrayed in _Thackeray's\r\nHumorist_, rather than the dignified caste of the nineteenth cycle\r\nof Christianity.  Laxity of morals and the coolest disregard possible\r\ncharacterized that period of our existence.\r\n\r\nMrs. General Eaton ruled Andrew Jackson as completely as he ruled\r\nthe Democratic party.  She was the daughter of William O'Neill, a\r\nrollicking Irishman, who was in his day the landlord of what was\r\nthen the leading public house in Washington City.  Among other\r\nCongressmen who were guests here was Andrew Jackson, then a Senator\r\nfrom Tennessee.  It was here he became interested in the landlord's\r\nbrilliant daughter Margaret, called by her friends \"Peg\" O'Neill.\r\nBefore she was sixteen years of age she married a handsome naval\r\nofficer, John Bowie Timberlake.  He died--some say that he committed\r\nsuicide--at Port Mahon, in 1828, leaving his accounts as purser in\r\na very mixed condition.  After the death of Timberlake, Commodore\r\nPatterson ordered Lieutenant Randolph to take the purser's books\r\nand perform the duties of purser.  On the return home of the\r\nConstitution it was discovered that Timberlake or Randolph was a\r\ndefaulter to the Government to a very large amount.  A court of\r\ninquiry was held on Randolph and he was acquitted, but Amos Kendall,\r\nthe Fourth Auditor of the Treasury Department, charged the defalcation\r\nto Randolph.  President Jackson, notwithstanding the decision of\r\nthe court, dismissed Lieutenant Randolph from the Navy, and refused\r\nto give him a hearing.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant, infuriated by his disgrace and pecuniary ruin, in\r\na state of excitement pulled the President's nose in the cabin of\r\na steamboat at the Alexandria wharf.  He was immediately seized\r\nand thrust on shore, the President declaring that he was able to\r\npunish him.  He charged that Jackson dismissed him and sustained\r\nKendall's decision in order to save General Eaton, who was Timberlake's\r\nbondsman, from having to make good the defalcation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eaton, who had boarded with his friend, General Jackson,\r\nat O'Neill's tavern, soon afterward married the Widow Timberlake,\r\nwho was then one of those examples of that Irish beauty, which,\r\nmarked by good blood, so suggests both the Greek and the Spaniard,\r\nand yet at times presents a combination which transcends both.\r\nHer form, of medium height, straight and delicate, was of perfect\r\nproportions.  Her skin was of that delicate white, tinged with red,\r\nwhich one often sees among even the poorer inhabitants of the Green\r\nIsle.  Her dark hair, very abundant, clustered in curls about her\r\nbroad, expressive forehead.  Her perfect nose, of almost Grecian\r\nproportions, and finely curved mouth, with a firm, round chin,\r\ncompleted a profile of faultless outlines.  She was in Washington\r\nCity what Aspasia was in Athens--the cynosure by whose reflected\r\nradiance\r\n\r\n  \"Beauty lent her smile to wit,\r\n   And learning by her star was lit.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson had come to Washington with a sad heart, breathing\r\nvengeance against those who had defamed his wife during the\r\nPresidential canvass, thereby, as he thought, hastening her death.\r\nThis made him the sworn and unyielding foe of all slanderers of\r\nwomen, and when some of the female tabbies of the Capital began to\r\ndrag the name of his old friend \"Peg,\" then the wife of General\r\nEaton, through the mire, he was naturally indignant, and showed\r\nhis respect for her by having her a frequent guest at the White\r\nHouse.  Enchanting, ambitious, and unscrupulous, she soon held the\r\nold hero completely under her influence, and carried her griefs to\r\nhim.  Mr. Van Buren adroitly seconded her, and the gallant old\r\nsoldier swore \"by the Eternal\" that the scandalmongers who had\r\nembittered the last years of his beloved wife, Rachel, should not\r\ntriumph over his \"little friend Peg.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Van Buren's opportunity.  He was a widower, keeping house\r\nat Washington, and as Secretary of State he was able to form an\r\nalliance with the bachelor Ministers of Great Britain and Russia,\r\neach of whom had spacious residences.  A series of dinners, balls,\r\nand suppers was inaugurated at these three houses, and at each\r\nsuccessive entertainment Mrs. Eaton was the honored guest, who led\r\nthe contra-dance, and occupied the seat at table on the right of\r\nthe host.  Some respectable ladies were so shocked by her audacity\r\nthat they would leave a room when she entered it.  She was openly\r\ndenounced by clergymen, and she found herself in positions which\r\nwould have covered almost any other woman in Washington with shame.\r\nMrs. Eaton, who apparently did not possess a scruple as to the\r\npropriety of her course, evidently enjoyed the situation, and used\r\nto visit General Jackson every day with a fresh story of the insults\r\npaid her.  Yet she gave no evidences of diplomacy nor of political\r\nsagacity, but was a mere beautiful, passionate, impulsive puppet,\r\nheld up by General Jackson, while Mr. Van Buren adroitly pulled\r\nthe strings that directed her movements.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun, whose wife was foremost among those ladies who positively\r\nrefused to associate with Mrs. Eaton, said to a friend of General\r\nJackson's, who endeavored to effect a reconciliation, that \"the\r\nquarrels of women, like those of the Medes and Persians, admitted\r\nof neither inquiry nor explanation.\"  He knew well, however, that\r\nit was no women's quarrel, but a political game of chess played by\r\nmen who were using women as their pawns, and he lost the game.\r\nVan Buren and Eaton next tendered their resignations as Cabinet\r\nofficers, which General Jackson refused to accept; whereupon the\r\nCabinet officers whose wives declined to call on Mrs. Eaton resigned,\r\nand their resignations were promptly accepted.  The whole city was\r\nin a turmoil.  Angry men walked about with bludgeons, seeking\r\n\"satisfaction;\" duels were talked of; old friendships were severed;\r\nand every fresh indignity offered his \"little friend Peg\" endeared\r\nher the more to General Jackson, who was duly grateful to Van Buren\r\nfor having espoused her cause.  \"It is odd enough,\" wrote Daniel\r\nWebster to a personal friend, \"that the consequences of this dispute\r\nin the social and fashionable world are producing great political\r\neffects, and may very probably determine who shall be successor to\r\nthe present Chief Magistrate.\"\r\n\r\nJunius Brutus Booth was the delight of the Washington playgoers in\r\nthe Jackson Administration.  His wonderful impersonations of Richard\r\nIII., Iago, King Lear, Othello, Shylock, and Sir Giles Overreach\r\nwere as grand as his private life was intemperate and eccentric.\r\nHe was a short, dumpy man, with features resembling those of the\r\nRoman Emperors, before his nose was broken in a quarrel, and his\r\ndeportment on the stage was imperially grand.  He had a farm in\r\nMaryland, and at one time he undertook to supply a Washington hotel\r\nwith eggs, milk, and chickens, but he soon gave it up.  His instant\r\nand tremendous concentration of passion in his delineations\r\noverwhelmed his audience and wrought it into such enthusiasm that\r\nit partook of the fever of inspiration surging through his own\r\nveins.  He was not lacking in the power to comprehend and portray\r\nwith marvelous and exquisite delicacy the subtle shades of character\r\nthat Shakespeare loved to paint, and his impersonations were a\r\ndelight to the refined scholar as well as the uncultivated backwoodsmen\r\nwho crowded to his performances.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Theatre was not well patronized, but the strolling\r\nproprietors of minor amusements reaped rich harvests of small silver\r\ncoins.  The circus paid its annual visit, to the joy of the rural\r\nCongressmen and the negroes, who congregated around its sawdust\r\nring, applauding each successive act of horsemanship and laughing\r\nat the repetition of the clown's old jokes; a daring rope-dancer,\r\nnamed Herr Cline, performed his wonderful feats on the tight rope\r\nand on the slack wire; Finn gave annual exhibitions of fancy glass-\r\nblowing; and every one went to see \"the living skeleton,\" a tall,\r\nemaciated young fellow named Calvin Edson, compared with whom\r\nShakespeare's starved apothecary was fleshy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson turned a deaf ear to the numerous applications made\r\nto him for charity.  At one time when he was President a large\r\nnumber of Irish immigrants were at work on the Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nCanal in Georgetown, and, the weather being very hot, many of them\r\nwere prostrated by sunstroke and bilious diseases.  They were\r\nwithout medical aid, the necessities of life, or any shelter except\r\nthe shanties in which they were crowded.  Their deplorable condition\r\nled to the formation of a society of Irish-Americans, with the\r\nvenerable Mr. McLeod, a noted instructor, as president.  A committee\r\nfrom this Society waited on the President for aid, and Mr. McLeod\r\nmade known the object of their visit.  General Jackson interrupted\r\nhim by saying that he \"entirely disapproved of the Society; that\r\nthe fact of its existence would induce these fellows to come one\r\nhundred miles to get the benefit of it; that if the treasury of\r\nthe United States were at his disposal it could not meet the demands\r\nthat were daily made upon him, and he would not be driven from the\r\nWhite House by a beggar-man, like old Jim Monroe.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Samuel Swartwout, of Hoboken, was an old personal friend\r\nof General Jackson, and when \"the Hickory Broom\" began to sweep\r\nout the old office-holders, in obedience to the maxim, \"To the\r\nvictors belong the spoils,\" the Colonel was an applicant for the\r\nthen lucrative position of Collector of the Port of New York.  Van\r\nBuren was against him, and used many arguments with Jackson to\r\nprevent the appointment; but after a patient hearing, Old Hickory\r\nclosed the case by bringing his fist down upon the table and\r\nexclaiming, \"By the Eternal!  Sam, Swartwout _shall_ be Collector\r\nof the Port of New York!\"  He was appointed and became the prey of\r\npolitical swindlers, spending the public moneys right regally until\r\nhis accounts were overhauled, and he \"Swartwouted\" (to use a word\r\ncoined at the time) to avoid a criminal prosecution.  He remained\r\nabroad for many years, and I think died in Europe.\r\n\r\nFrancis S. Key was United States Attorney for the district of\r\nWashington during the Jackson Administration.  He was a small,\r\nactive man, having an earnest and even anxious expression of\r\ncountenance, as if care sat heavily upon him.  In composing the\r\nheroic song of the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" after he had witnessed\r\nthe unsuccessful night attack of the British on Fort McHenry, he,\r\nin a measure, associated himself with the glory of his country.\r\nHe was a man of very ardent religious character, and some of the\r\nmost poetic and popular of the hymns used in religious worship were\r\nfrom his pen.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Danl Webster\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER was born at Salisbury, New Hampshire, January 18th,\r\n1782; was a Representative from New Hampshire in Congress, 1813-\r\n1817, and removing to Boston, a Representative from Massachusetts,\r\n1823-1827; United States Senator, 1827-1841; Secretary of State\r\nunder Presidents Harrison and Tyler, 1841-1843; United States\r\nSenator, 1845-1850; Secretary of State under President Fillmore\r\nfrom 1850 until his death at Marshfield, Massachusetts, October\r\n14th, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE STAMPING OUT OF NULLIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the Senate of the nomination of Martin Van Buren\r\nas Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, was an act of\r\nretributive justice, carried out on the very spot where, five years\r\nbefore, he had formed the combination which overthrew the Administration\r\nof John Quincy Adams.  John C. Calhoun, who was the organizer of\r\nthe rejection of Mr. Van Buren, thought that he had obtained pledges\r\nof a sufficient number of votes; but just before the ayes and noes\r\nwere called Mr. Webster left the Senate Chamber, and going down\r\ninto the Supreme Court room remained there until the vote had been\r\ntaken.  Mr. Calhoun consequently found himself one vote short, and\r\nhad to give the casting vote, as President of the Senate, which\r\nrejected the nomination of his rival, who was already in England,\r\nwhere he had been received with marked attention.\r\n\r\nReturning to the United States, Mr. Van Buren was warmly welcomed\r\nat the White House as a victim of Mr. Calhoun's opposition to the\r\nPresident, and he was soon recognized by the Democratic party as\r\ntheir heir-apparent to the Presidency.  His appearance at that time\r\nwas impressive.  He was short, solidly built, with a bald head,\r\nand with bushy side-whiskers, which framed his florid features.\r\nHe added the grace and polish of aristocratic English society to\r\nhis natural courtesy, and it was his evident aim never to provoke\r\na controversy, while he used every exertion to win new friends and\r\nretain old ones.  After he had been elected Vice-President, he sat\r\nday after day in the chair of the Senate, apparently indifferent\r\nalike to the keen thrusts of Calhoun, the savage blows of Webster,\r\nand the gibes of Clay.  He well knew that General Jackson would\r\nregard every assault on him as aimed at the Administration, and\r\nthat his chances for the succession would thereby be strengthened.\r\nCharges of political chicanery were brought against him in shapes\r\nmore varied than that of Proteus and thick as the leaves that strew\r\nthe vale of Valombrosa; but he invariably extricated himself by\r\nartifice and choice management, earning the sobriquet of \"the Little\r\nMagician.\"  He could not be provoked into a loss of temper, and he\r\nwould not say a word while in the chair except as connected with\r\nhis duties as presiding officer, when he spoke in gentle but\r\npersuasive tones, singularly effective from the clearness of his\r\nenunciation and his well-chosen emphasis.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren, who was then a widower, kept house on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, about half way between the White House and Georgetown,\r\nwhere he not only gave dinner parties to his political friends,\r\nbut entertained their wives and daughters at evening whist parties.\r\nGentlemen and ladies were alike used for the advancement of his\r\nschemes for the succession and for retaining his position in the\r\nestimation of General Jackson.  On one occasions he said to Mrs.\r\nEaton that he had been reading much and thinking deeply on the\r\ncharacters of great men, and had come to the conclusion that General\r\nJackson was the greatest man that had ever lived--the only man\r\namong them all who was without a fault.  \"But,\" he added, \"don't\r\ntell General Jackson what I have said.  I would not have him know\r\nit for all the world.\"  Of course, it was not long before Mrs.\r\nEaton repeated the conversation to General Jackson.  \"Ah, madam!\"\r\nsaid Old Hickory, the tears starting in his eyes, \"that man loves\r\nme; he tries to conceal it, but there is always some way fixed by\r\nwhich I can tell my friends from my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren was noted for his willingness to sign applications\r\nfor office, and he used to tell a good story illustrating his\r\nreadiness to oblige those who solicited his aid.  When Governor of\r\nthe State of New York, a lawyer called upon him to get a convict\r\npardoned from the penitentiary, and stated the case, which was a\r\nclear one.  \"Have you the papers?\" he asked.  \"If so, I will sign\r\nthem.\"  \"Here they are,\" said the lawyer, producing a bulky document,\r\nand the Governor indorsed them:  \"Let pardon be granted.  M. Van\r\nBuren.\"  He then left for the office of the Secretary of State,\r\nbut soon returned.  \"Governor,\" said he, \"I made a mistake, and\r\nyou indorsed the wrong paper.\"  He had presented for the official\r\nindorsement the marriage settlement of an Albany belle about to\r\nmarry a spendthrift.\r\n\r\nTo ingratiate himself further with General Jackson, and to strengthen\r\nthe Democratic party, whose votes he relied upon to elevate him to\r\nthe Presidency, Mr. Van Buren organized the war against the United\r\nStates Bank.  General Jackson was opposed to this institution before\r\nhe became President, and it was not a difficult task to impress\r\nupon his mind that the Bank was an unconstitutional monopoly, which\r\ndefied the legislative acts of sovereign States, which was suborning\r\nthe leading newspapers and public men of the country, and which\r\nwas using every means that wealth, political chicanery, and legal\r\ncunning could devise to perpetuate its existence.  All this the\r\nhonest old soldier in time believed, and it was then not difficult\r\nto impress him with a desire to combat this \"monster,\" as he called\r\nthe bank, and to act as the champion of the people in killing the\r\ndragon which was endeavoring to consume their fortunes.  When a\r\ncommittee of wealthy business men from Boston, New York, and\r\nPhiladelphia waited on him with a remonstrance against his financial\r\npolicy, he gave them such a reception that they felt very uncomfortable\r\nand were glad to get away.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic politicians and presses heartily seconded their\r\nchieftain in this war, promising the people \"Benton mint-drops\r\ninstead of rag-money.\"  Jackson clubs were everywhere organized,\r\nhaving opposite to the tavern or hall used as their headquarters\r\na hickory-tree, trimmed of all its foliage except a tuft at the\r\ntop.  Torch-light processions, then organized for the first time,\r\nused to march through the streets of the city or village where they\r\nbelonged, halting in front of the houses of prominent Jackson men\r\nto cheer, while before the residences of leading Whigs they would\r\noften tarry long enough to give six or nine groans.  Editors of\r\nnewspapers which supported the Administration were forced to advocate\r\nits most ultra measures and to denounce its opponents, or they were\r\narraigned as traitors, and if satisfactory excuses could not be\r\nmade, they were read out of the party.  Among these thus excommunicated\r\nwas Mr. James Gordon Bennett, who had edited the Philadelphia\r\n_Pennsylvanian_.\r\n\r\nNicholas Biddle, its president, managed the affairs of the Bank of\r\nthe United States with consummate ability.  His trials in the bitter\r\ncontest waged against him and the institution which he represented\r\nwere almost as manifold as those that tested the patience of Job;\r\nand he bore them with equal meekness so far as temper was concerned,\r\nbut when duty required he never failed to meet his opponents with\r\ndecision and effect.  The Bank had to discount the worthless notes\r\nof a number of Congressmen and editors, whose support, thus purchased,\r\ndid more harm than good.  Mr. Biddle had also incurred the hostility\r\nof Isaac Hill and other influential Jackson men because he would\r\nnot remove the non-partisan presidents and cashiers of the branches\r\nof the Bank in their respective localities, and appoint in their\r\nplaces zealous henchmen of the Administration.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was triumphantly re-elected in November, 1832,\r\nreceiving two hundred and nineteen of the two hundred and eighty-\r\neight electoral votes cast, while Martin Van Buren received one\r\nhundred and eighty-nine electoral votes for Vice-President.\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, and\r\nKentucky cast forty-nine electoral votes for Henry Clay and John\r\nSargent.  Vermont gave her seven electoral votes for the anti-\r\nMasonic candidates, William Wirt and William Ellmaker, while South\r\nCarolina bestowed her eleven electoral votes on John Floyd, of\r\nVirginia, and Henry Lee, of Massachusetts, neither of whom were\r\nnullifiers.  Some of the Jackson newspapers, while rejoicing over\r\nhis re-election, nominated him for a third term, and William Wirt\r\nwrote:  \"My opinion is that he may be President for life if he\r\nchooses.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of re-election having been passed, President Jackson\r\nand his supporters carried out the programme which had before been\r\ndecided upon.  The removal of the Government deposits from the\r\nUnited States Bank gave rise to stormy debates in Congress, and\r\nthe questionable exercise of Executive authority met with a fierce,\r\nunrelenting opposition from the Whigs.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Senate on the Bank and attendant financial\r\nquestions were very interesting, but the audiences were necessarily\r\nsmall.  The circumscribed accommodations of the Senate Chamber were\r\ninsufficient, and while the ladies generally managed to secure\r\nseats, either in the galleries or on the floor, the gentlemen had\r\nto content themselves with uncomfortable positions, leaning against\r\npillars or peeping through doorways.  Mr. Van Buren, as Vice-\r\nPresident, presided with great dignity, and endeavored to conciliate\r\nthose Senators who were his rivals for the succession, but he had\r\noften to hear his political course mercilessly criticised by them.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, who resigned the position of Vice-President that\r\nhe might be elected a Senator from South Carolina, differed from\r\nhis great contemporaries in the possession of a private character\r\nabove reproach.  Whether this arose from the preponderance of the\r\nintellectual over the animal in his nature, or the subjection of\r\nhis passions by discipline, was never determined by those who knew\r\nthe gifted South Carolinian best; but such was the fact.  His\r\nenemies could find no opprobrious appellation for him but \"Catiline,\"\r\ninstead of \"Caldwell,\" which was his middle name--no crime but\r\nambition.  He disregarded the unwritten laws of the Senate, which\r\nrequired Senators to appear in dress suits of black broadcloth,\r\nand asserted his State pride and State independence by wearing,\r\nwhen the weather was warm, a suit of nankeen, made from nankeen\r\ncotton grown in South Carolina.  Mr. Calhoun had a pale and attenuated\r\nlook, as if in bad health; his long black hair was combed up from\r\nhis forehead and fell over the back of his head, and his thin lips\r\nincreased the effect of the acute look with which he always regarded\r\nthose around him.  His personal intercourse with friends was\r\ncharacterized by great gentleness of manner; he was an affectionate\r\nand a devoted husband and father, and Webster truly remarked of\r\nhim that \"he had no recreations, and never seemed to feel the\r\nnecessity of amusement.\"\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his aspirations for the Presidency of the United\r\nStates, Mr. Calhoun conceived the idea of dissolving the Union and\r\nestablishing a Southern Confederacy, of which he would be the Chief\r\nExecutive.  One of his projects, fearing that the success of the\r\nmain plot would be too long delayed for any benefit to inure to\r\nhim, was a proposed amendment to the Constitution, to make two\r\nPresidents exist at the same time--one from the South and the other\r\nfrom the other sections--and no act in regard to the interests of\r\nthe South was to be passed without the consent of the President\r\nfor that section.  Of course, his plan was looked upon as puerile,\r\nif not mischievous, and failed to attract much attention.  His\r\nwhole soul was then bent on his main scheme, and he enlisted warm,\r\nardent, and talented followers in behalf of it; but little headway\r\nwas made in it outside of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson knew well what was going on, and was determined\r\nthat the law should be put into execution, not against misguided\r\nfollowers, but against Calhoun, the chief conspirator.  Calhoun,\r\nhearing that Jackson had resolved upon his prosecution and trial,\r\nand, if convicted, his execution for treason, sent Letcher, of\r\nKentucky, to confer with him and to learn his real intentions.\r\nThe President received Letcher with his usual courtesy; but that\r\nmild blue eye, which at times would fill with tears like that of\r\na woman, was kindled up that night with unwonted fire.  He explained\r\nthe situation to Letcher, and concluded by telling him that if\r\nanother step was taken, \"by the Eternal!\" he would try Calhoun for\r\ntreason, and, if convicted, he would hang him on a gallows as high\r\nas Haman.\r\n\r\nLetcher saw that Jackson was terribly in earnest, and hastened to\r\nthe lodgings of Calhoun, who had retired, but received him sitting\r\nup in bed with his cloak around him.  Letcher detailed all that\r\nhad occurred, giving entire the conversation with Jackson, and\r\ndescribed the old hero as he took that oath.\r\n\r\nThere sat Calhoun, drinking in eagerly every word, and, as Letcher\r\nproceeded, he turned pale as death, and, great as he was in intellect,\r\ntrembled like an aspen leaf, not from fear or cowardice, but from\r\nthe consciousness of guilt.  He was the arch traitor, who like\r\nSatan in Paradise, \"brought death into the world and all our woe.\"\r\nWithin one week he came into the Senate and voted--voted for every\r\nsection of Mr. Clay's bill--and President Jackson was prevailed\r\nupon not to prosecute him for his crime.\r\n\r\nDuring the last days of General Jackson at the Hermitage, while\r\nslowly sinking under the ravages of consumption, he was one day\r\nspeaking of his Administration, and with glowing interest he inquired\r\nof the physician:\r\n\r\n\"What act in my Administration, in your opinion, will posterity\r\ncondemn with the greatest severity?\"\r\n\r\nThe physician replied that he was unable to answer, that it might\r\nbe the removal of the deposits.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no,\" said the General.\r\n\r\n\"Then it may be the specie circular?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you,\" said Jackson, rising in his bed, his eyes kindling\r\nup--\"I can tell you; posterity will condemn me more because I was\r\npersuaded not to hang John C. Calhoun as a traitor than for any\r\nother act in my life.\"\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster's reply to Hayne was made the key-note of the\r\nresistance by the Administration to Jefferson's assertion adopted\r\nby Calhoun, \"Where powers have been assumed which have not been\r\ndelegated, nullification is the rightful remedy.\"  President\r\nJackson's proclamation against this doctrine of nullification--the\r\ngerm of secession--was written by Edward Livingston, his Secretary\r\nof State, and it has been said that it followed, throughout, the\r\ndoctrine maintained by Mr. Webster in his reply to Hayne, in 1830.\r\nSo remarkable was this adoption of Mr. Webster's argument, that\r\npopular opinion at that time regarded it as a manifest, but of\r\ncourse a very excusable, plagiarism.  Mr. Webster, when the\r\nproclamation was issued, was on his way to Washington, ignorant of\r\nwhat had occurred.  At an inn in New Jersey he met a traveler just\r\nfrom Washington.  Neither of them was known to the other.  Mr.\r\nWebster inquired the news.  \"Sir,\" said the gentleman, \"the President\r\nhas issued a proclamation against the nullifiers, taken entirely\r\nfrom Mr. Webster's reply to Hayne.\"  In the course of the ensuing\r\nsession, and not long after Mr. Webster reached the capital it\r\nbecame necessary for the Administration to act.  Mr. Webster was\r\nin the opposition, and, excepting in regard to the integrity of\r\nthe Union and the just power of the Government, there was a wide\r\ngulf between the Administration and him.  He was absent from his\r\nseat for several days when the Force bill was about to be introduced\r\nas an Administration measure.  A portion of General Jackson's\r\noriginal supporters hung back from that issue.  At this juncture\r\nthere was much inquiry among the President's friends in the House\r\nas to where Mr. Webster was.  At length a member of General Jackson's\r\nCabinet went to Mr. Webster's rooms, told him the nature of the\r\nbill about to be introduced, and asked him, as a public duty, to\r\ngo into the Senate and defend the bill and the President.  It is\r\nwell known to the whole country that Mr. Webster did so; and it is\r\nknown to me that General Jackson personally thanked him for his\r\npowerful aid, that many of the President's best friends afterward\r\nsought to make a union between him and Mr. Webster, and that nothing\r\ncontinued to separate them but an irreconcilable difference of\r\nopinion about the questions relating to the currency.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Calhoun was undoubtedly the leading Democrat in the\r\nSenate, after his return to that body, Mr. Benton was the recognized\r\nleader of President Jackson's adherents in that body.  His fierce\r\nopposition to \"Biddle and the Bank,\" with his prediction that the\r\ntime would come when there would be no paper money, but when every\r\nlaboring man would have a knit silk purse, through the meshes of\r\nwhich the gold coin within could be seen, obtained for him the\r\nsobriquet of \"Old Bullion.\"  His greatest triumph was the passage\r\nof a resolution by the Senate \"expunging\" from its journal a\r\nresolution censuring General Jackson for the removal of deposits\r\nfrom the Bank of the United States.  This expunging resolution was\r\nkept before the Senate for nearly three years, and was then passed\r\nby only five majority.  The closing debate was able and exhaustive,\r\nHenry Clay, John J. Crittenden, Thomas Ewing, William C. Rives,\r\nWilliam Hendricks, John M. Niles, Richard H. Bayard, and others\r\nparticipating, while Daniel Webster read a protest signed by himself\r\nand his sturdy colleague, John Davis.  The Democrats had provided\r\na bountiful supply of refreshments in the room of the Committee on\r\nFinance, and several Senators showed by their actions that they\r\nwere not members of the then newly organized Congressional Temperance\r\nSociety, before which Mr. Webster had delivered a brief address.\r\nAfter the final vote--twenty-four years and nineteen nays--had been\r\ntaken, Mr. Benton moved that the Secretary carry into effect the\r\norder of the Senate.  Then the Secretary, Mr. Asbury Dickens,\r\nopening the manuscript journal of 1834, drew broad black lines\r\naround the obnoxious resolution and wrote across its face:  \"Expunged\r\nby order of the Senate, this 16th day of January, in the year of\r\nour Lord 1837.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he concluded than hisses were heard, and Mr. King,\r\nof Alabama, who occupied the chair, ordered the galleries to be\r\ncleared, while Mr. Benton, in a towering rage, denounced the\r\noffenders and demanded their arrest.  \"Here is one,\" said he, \"just\r\nabove me, that may be easily be identified--the bank ruffian.\"\r\nMr. King revoked his order to clear the galleries, but directed\r\nthe arrest of the person pointed out by Mr. Benton, who was soon\r\nbrought before the bar of the Senate.  It was Mr. Lloyd, a practicing\r\nlawyer in Cleveland, Ohio, who was not permitted to say a word in\r\nhis own defense, but was soon discharged, after which the Senate\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Thomas H. Benton\r\nTHOMAS HART BENTON was born near Hillsborough, North Carolina,\r\nMarch 14th, 1782; was United States Senator from Missouri, 1821-\r\n1851; a Representative in Congress from Missouri, 1853-1855; was\r\ndefeated as a candidate for re-election to Congress in 1854, and\r\nas candidate for Governor of Missouri in 1856, and died at Washington\r\nCity, April 10th, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nPROMINENT MEN OF JACKSON'S TIME.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, after his return to the Senate, was the recognized\r\nleader of the Whig Senators, for he would recognize no leader.\r\nHis oratory was persuasive and spirit-stirring.  The fire of his\r\nbright eyes and the sunny smile which lighted up his countenance\r\nadded to the attractions of his unequaled voice, which was equally\r\ndistinct and clear, whether at its highest key or lowest whisper--\r\nrich, musical, captivating.  His action was the spontaneous offspring\r\nof the passing thought.  He gesticulated all over.  The nodding of\r\nhis head, hung on a long neck, his arms, hands, fingers, feet, and\r\neven his spectacles, his snuff-box, and his pocket-handkerchief,\r\naided him in debate.  He stepped forward and backward, and from\r\nthe right to the left, with effect.  Every thought spoke; the whole\r\nbody had its story to tell, and added to the attractions of his\r\nable arguments.  But he was not a good listener, and he would often\r\nsit, while other Senators were speaking, eating sticks of striped\r\npeppermint candy, and occasionally taking a pinch of snuff from a\r\nsilver box that he carried, or from one that graced the table of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Mr. Clay was very imperious and displayed bad temper\r\nin debate.  Once he endeavored to browbeat Colonel Benton, bringing\r\nup \"Old Bullion's\" personal recontre with General Jackson, and\r\ncharging the former with having said that, should the latter be\r\nelected President, Congress must guard itself with pistols and\r\ndirks.  This Colonel Benton pronounced \"an atrocious calumny.\"\r\n\"What,\" retorted Mr. Clay, \"can you look me in the face, sir, and\r\nsay that you never used that language?\"  \"I look,\" said Colonel\r\nBenton, \"and repeat that it is an atrocious calumny, and I will\r\npin it to him who repeats it here.\"  Mr. Clay's face flushed with\r\nrage as he replied:  \"Then I declare before the Senate that you\r\nsaid the very words!\"  \"False! false! false!\" shouted Colonel\r\nBenton, and the Senators interfered, Mr. Tazewell, who was in the\r\nchair, calling the belligerents to order.  After some discussion\r\nof the questions of order, Colonel Benton said:  \"I apologize to\r\nthe Senate for the manner in which I have spoken--but not to the\r\nSenator from Kentucky.\"  Mr. Clay promptly added:  \"To the Senate\r\nI also offer an apology--to the Senator from Missouri, none!\"  Half\r\nan hour afterwards they shook hands, as lawyers often do who have\r\njust before abused each other in court.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, General Smith, of Baltimore, a Revolutionary\r\nhero upward of eighty years of age, who had been a member of Congress\r\nalmost forty years, was one day the object of Henry Clay's wrath.\r\nThe old General, who had fought gallantly in the Revolutionary\r\nstruggle and taken up arms again in the War of 1812, was offensively\r\nbullied by Mr. Clay, who said:  \"The honorable gentleman was in\r\nfavor of manufactures in 1822, but he has turned--I need not use\r\nthe word--he has thus abandoned manufactures.  Thus\r\n\r\n  \"'Old politicians chew on wisdom past\r\n    And totter on, in blunders, to the last.'\"\r\n\r\nThe old General sprang to his feet.  \"The last allusion,\" said he,\r\n\"is unworthy of a gentleman.  Totter, sir, I totter!  Though some\r\ntwenty years older than the gentleman, I can yet stand firm, and\r\nam yet able to correct his errors.  I could take a view of the\r\ngentleman's course, which would show how consistent he has been.\"\r\nMr. Clay exclaimed, angrily:  \"Take it, sir, take it--I dare you!\"\r\nCries of \"Order.\"  \"No, sir,\" said Mr. Smith, \"I will not take it.\r\nI will not so far disregard what is due to the dignity of the\r\nSenate.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Clay was generally imperious in debate, and not overcautious\r\nin his choice of phrases and epithets, he was fond of a joke, and\r\noften indulged, in an undertone, in humorous comments on the remarks\r\nby other Senators.  Sometimes he would be very happy in his\r\nillustrations, and make the most of some passing incident.  One\r\nafternoon, when he was replaying to a somewhat heated opponent, a\r\nsudden squall came up and rattled the window curtain so as to\r\nproduce a considerable noise.  The orator stopped short in the\r\nmidst of his remarks and inquired aloud, what was the matter; and\r\nthen, as if divining the cause of the disturbance, he said:  \"Storms\r\nseem to be coming in upon us from all sides.\"  The observation,\r\nthough trivial as related, was highly amusing under the circumstances\r\nwhich gave rise to it and from the manner in which it was uttered.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry Clay returned to the Senate, Daniel Webster yielded to\r\nhim the leadership of the Whigs in that body, but in no way sacrificed\r\nhis own independence.  \"The Great Expounder of the Constitution,\"\r\nas he was called, was then in the prime of life, and had not began\r\nthose indulgences which afterward exercised such injurious effects\r\nupon him.  He would also occasionally indulge in a grim witticism.\r\nOn one occasion, when a Senator who was jeering another for some\r\npedantry said, \"The honorable gentleman may proceed to quote from\r\nCrabbe's Synonyms, from Walker and Webster\"--\"Not from Walker and\r\nWebster,\" exclaimed the Senator from Massachusetts, \"for the\r\nauthorities may disagree!\"  At another time, when he was speaking\r\non the New York Fire bill, the Senate clock suddenly began to\r\nstrike, and after it had struck continuously for about fourteen or\r\nfifteen times, Mr. Webster stopped, and said to the presiding\r\nofficer, \"The clock is out of order, sir--I have the floor.\"  The\r\noccupant of the chair looking rebukingly at the refractory time-\r\npiece, but in defiance of the officers and rules of the House, it\r\nstruck about forty before the Sergeant-at-Arms could stop it, Mr.\r\nWebster standing silent, while every one else was laughing.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, while Mr. Webster was addressing the Senate\r\nin presenting a memorial, a clerical-looking person in one of the\r\ngalleries arose and shouted:  \"My friends, the country is on the\r\nbrink of destruction!  Be sure that you act on correct principles.\r\nI warn you to act as your consciences may approve.  God is looking\r\ndown upon you, and if you act on correct principles you will get\r\nsafely through.\"  He then deliberately stepped back, and retired\r\nfrom the gallery before the officers of the Senate could reach him.\r\nMr. Webster was, of course, surprised at this extraordinary\r\ninterruption; but when the shrill voice of the enthusiast had\r\nceased, he coolly resumed his remarks, saying, \"As the gentleman\r\nin the gallery has concluded, I will proceed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cuthbert, of Georgia, was much provoked, one day, by a scathing\r\ndenunciation of his State by Mr. Clay for the manner in which she\r\nhad treated the Cherokee Indians.  As the eloquent Kentuckian dwelt\r\nmore in sorrow than in anger upon the wrongs and outrages perpetrated\r\nin Georgia upon the unoffending aborigines within her borders, many\r\nof his hearers were affected to tears, and he himself was obviously\r\ndeeply moved.  No sooner did Mr. Clay resume his seat than Mr.\r\nCuthbert sprang to his feet, and in an insolent tone alluded to\r\nwhat he called the theatrical manner of the speaker.  \"What new\r\npart will Roscius next enact?\" said the Senator from Georgia, coming\r\nforward from his desk and standing in the area of the hall.  He\r\nwas a man of about the ordinary height, with a round face pitted\r\nwith the smallpox, small, dark eyes, and a full forehead.  As he\r\nspoke he twirled his watch-key incessantly with his right hand,\r\nwhile his left was flung about in the most unmeaning and awkward\r\ngestures.  He twisted his body right and left, forward and backward,\r\nas if he were a Chinese mandarin going through a stated number of\r\nevolutions before his emperor; in fact, he had \"all the contortions\r\nof the sybil, without her inspiration.\"  To this display Mr. Clay\r\nseemed entirely oblivious, but after Judge White, of Tennessee,\r\nhad discussed the pending question, Mr. Clay rose, saying, that he\r\nwould reply to this gentleman's remarks as \"they alone were worthy\r\nof notice.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, during the Jackson Administration,\r\nsectional topics were rife, sectional jealousies were high, and\r\npartisan warfare was unrelenting.  Andrew Stevenson, of Virginia,\r\nwho was triumphantly re-elected as Speaker for four successive\r\nterms, understood well how to keep down the boiling caldron, and\r\nto exercise stern authority, tempered with dignity and courtesy,\r\nover heated passions of the fiercest conflicting character.  When\r\nhe was transferred from the Speaker's chair to the Court of St.\r\nJames, John Bell, of Tennessee, an old supporter of General Jackson,\r\nbecame his successor for the remainder of that session, but at the\r\ncommencement of the next Congress Mr. Van Buren secured the election\r\nof James K. Polk.  Mr. Bell, on his next visit to Nashville, threw\r\ndown the gauntlet, in an able speech, and nominated Judge White.\r\nThis was the foundation of the White party, which had, as its\r\neditorial henchman, the Rev. Mr. Brownlow, known as \"the fighting\r\nParson,\" who soon acquired a national reputation by his defiant\r\npersonalities in debate and by his trenchant editorial articles in\r\nthe newspapers of East Tennessee.  Mr. Brownlow was at that time\r\na tall, spare man, with long, black hair, black eyes, and a sallow\r\ncomplexion.  He was devoted to the Methodist Church and to the\r\nWhite--afterward the Whig--party, and the denominational doctrines\r\nof immersion and the political dogmas of emancipation from slavery\r\nwere objects of his intense hatred.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Stevenson was Speaker, General Samuel Houston, who had\r\nbeen residing among the Indians on the Southwestern frontier for\r\nseveral years, came to Washington.  Taking offense at some remarks\r\nmade in debate by Mr. Vance, a representative from Ohio, Houston\r\nassaulted and severely pounded him.  The House voted that Houston\r\nshould be brought before the bar and reprimanded by the Speaker,\r\nwhich was done, although Mr. Stevenson's reprimand was really\r\ncomplimentary.  That night a friend of General Houston, with a\r\nbludgeon and a pistol, attacked Mr. Arnold, of Tennessee, who had\r\nbeen active in securing the reprimand, but the latter soon got the\r\nbest of the encounter.\r\n\r\nThe first man elected to Congress as a representative of the rights\r\nof the laboring classes was Eli Moore, a New York journeyman printer,\r\nwho had organized trades unions and successfully engineered several\r\nstrikes by mechanics against their employers.  He was a thin,\r\nnervous man, with keen, dark hazel eyes, long black hair brushed\r\nback behind his ears, and a strong, clear voice which rang through\r\nthe hall like the sound of a trumpet.  He especially distinguished\r\nhimself in a reply to General Waddy Thompson, of South Carolina,\r\nwho had denounced the mechanics of the North as willing tools of\r\nthe Abolitionists.  With impetuous force and in tones tremulous\r\nwith emotion, he denounced aristocracy and advocated the equality\r\nof all men.  The House listened with attention, and a Southern\r\npolitician exclaimed to one of his old colleagues, \"Why, this is\r\nthe high-priest of revolution singing his war song.\"  What added\r\nto the effect of this remarkable speech was its dramatic termination.\r\nJust as he had entered upon his peroration he grew deathly pale,\r\nhis eyes closed, his outstretched hands clutched at vacancy, he\r\nreeled forward, and fell insensible.  His friends rushed to his\r\nsupport, and his wife, who was in the gallery, screamed with terror.\r\nHis physician positively prohibited his speaking again, and in\r\nsubsequent years, when the Democratic party was in power, he enjoyed\r\nthe positions of Indian Agent under Polk, and of Land Agent under\r\nPierce.\r\n\r\nRansom H. Gillet, of the Ogdensburgh district, was one of the old\r\n\"Jackson Democratic War-Horses.\"  He was a man of commanding\r\npresence, a ready speaker, and a famous manipulator of opinion at\r\nConventions.\r\n\r\nBy birth a North Carolinian, Churchill C. Cambreleng was by adoption\r\na New Yorker, and by strict attention to business he had become\r\none of the merchant princes of the commercial metropolis.  Thirty\r\nyears of age, with a commanding presence, a good voice, a ready\r\ncommand of language, and a practical knowledge of financial matters,\r\nhe made an excellent Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means\r\nand leader of the Jackson men in the House.\r\n\r\nHe carried business habits into Congress, and passed much of his\r\ntime at his desk, laboriously answering every letter addressed to\r\nhim by his constituents or others, or carefully examining papers\r\nreferred to his Committee.  But he was always on the alert, and if\r\nin debate any political opponent let slip a word derogatory to the\r\nAdministration, Mr. Cambreleng was at once on his feet with a\r\npertinent retort or a skillful explanation.  He was noted for his\r\nliberality, and neither the district charities or his needy\r\nconstituents ever appealed to him in vain.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, during the Jackson Administration, made much of David\r\nCrockett, of Tennessee, who was a thorn in the sides of the Democrats,\r\nand they succeeded in having him defeated for one Congress, but he\r\nwas successful at the next election.  He was a true frontiersman,\r\nwith a small dash of civilization and a great deal of shrewdness\r\ntransplanted in political life.  He was neither grammatical nor\r\ngraceful, but no rudeness of language can disguise strong sense\r\nand shrewdness, and a \"demonstration,\" as Bulwer says, \"will force\r\nits way through all perversions of grammar.\"  Some one undertook\r\nto publish his life, but he promptly denied the authenticity of\r\nthe work, and had a true memoir of himself written and published.\r\nThis was a successful literary venture, and he next published a\r\nburlesque life of Van Buren, \"heir apparent to the Government, and\r\nappointed successor of Andrew Jackson,\" which, in the mixture of\r\ntruth, error, wit, sense, and nonsense in about equal parts, has\r\ncertainly the merit even at this day of being entertaining.\r\nCrockett's favorite expression was, \"Be sure you're right, then go\r\nahead.\"  When Texas commenced its struggle for independence he went\r\nthere, and was killed while gallantly fighting at San Antonio.\r\nHis son, John W. Crockett, served two terms in Congress, was Attorney-\r\nGeneral of Tennessee, edited a paper at New Orleans, and died at\r\nMemphis in 1852.\r\n\r\nAmong the other members of the House of Representatives in Jackson's\r\ntime were several who afterward occupied high positions in the\r\nFederal Government.  Franklin Pierce, a courteous gentleman, the\r\nson of a brave Revolutionary soldier, had been sent from New\r\nHampshire by a large majority, and laid the foundation of personal\r\nfriendships upon which he afterward entered the White House as\r\nPresident.  Millard Fillmore, hale and hearty in personal appearance,\r\nrepresented his home at Buffalo.  He soon acquired a reputation\r\nfor performing his committee work with scrupulous fidelity, and\r\nwinning the confidence of his colleagues, while advancing on all\r\nproper occasions the interests of his constituents, who rejoiced\r\nwhen he became President after the death of Taylor.  James Knox\r\nPolk, of Tennessee, a rigid Presbyterian, an uncompromising Democrat,\r\nand a zealous Freemason, was another Representative who subsequently\r\nbecame President.\r\n\r\nThere were several other prominent men in the House:  Richard Mentor\r\nJohnson, a burly and slightly educated Kentucky Indian-fighter,\r\nwho enjoyed the reputation of having killed Tecumseh at the battle\r\nof the Thames, was elected a few years later on the Van Buren ticket\r\nVice-President of the United States, but was defeated in the Harrison\r\ncampaign four years later; and John Bell, a Whig of commanding\r\npresence and great practical sagacity, who was afterward Senator\r\nand Secretary of War, and who was defeated when he ran on the\r\nPresidential ticket of the Constitutional Union party, in 1860.\r\nElisha Whittlesey, of Ohio, who after sixteen years of Congressional\r\nservice became an auditor, and was known as \"the Watch Dog of the\r\nTreasury.\"  Tom Corwin, of the same State, with a portly figure,\r\nswarthy complexion, and wonderful facial expression, and an\r\ninexhaustible flow of wit, who was not a buffoon, but a gentleman\r\nwhose humor was natural, racy, and chaste.  Gulian C. Verplanck\r\nand Thomas J. Oakley, two members of the New York bar, who represented\r\nthat city, were statesmen rather than politicians.  John Chambers,\r\nof Kentucky, a gigantic economist, was ever ready to reform small\r\nexpenditures and willing to overlook large ones.  And then there\r\nwas the ponderous Dixon H. Lewis, of Alabama, the largest man who\r\never occupied a seat in Congress--so large that chairs had to be\r\nmade expressly for his use.\r\n\r\nGeneral James Findlay, who had served creditably in the War of\r\n1812, was a Jackson Democratic Representative in the days of the\r\ncontest between \"Old Hickory\" and \"Biddle's Bank.\"  He was a type\r\nof a gentleman of the old school, and he recalled Washington Irving's\r\npicture of the master of Bracebridge Hall.  The bluff and hearty\r\nmanner, the corpulent person, and the open countenance of the\r\nGeneral, his dress of the aristocratic blue and buff, and his gold-\r\nheaded cane, all tallied with the descriptions of the English\r\ncountry gentleman of the olden time.  He was greatly beloved in\r\nOhio, and several anecdotes are told of his kindness in enforcing\r\nthe claims of the United States, when he was Receiver of the District\r\nLand Office, for lands sold on credit, as was the custom in those\r\ndays.  Upon one occasion there had been a time of general tightness\r\nin money matters, and many farms in the region northeast of Cincinnati\r\nbut partly paid for were forfeited to the Government.  In the\r\ndischarge of his official duty General Findlay attended at the\r\nplace of sale.  He learned, soon after his arrival there, that many\r\nspeculators were present prepared to purchase these lands.  Mounting\r\na stump, he opened the sale.  He designated the lands forfeited,\r\nand said that he was there to offer them to the highest bidder.\r\nHe said that the original purchasers were honest men, but that in\r\nconsequence of the hard times they had failed to meet their\r\nengagements.  It was hard, thus to be forced from their homes\r\nalready partly paid for.  But the law was imperative, and the lands\r\nmust be offered.  \"And now,\" continued he, \"I trust that there is\r\nno gentleman--no, I will not say that, I hope there is no rascal--\r\nhere so mean as to buy his neighbor's home over his head.  Gentlemen,\r\nI offer this lot for sale.  Who bids?\"  There was no forfeited land\r\nsold that day.\r\n\r\nA spirited bronze statue of Jefferson, by his admirer, the French\r\nsculptor, David d'Angers, was presented to Congress by Lieutenant\r\nUriah P. Levy, but Congress declined to accept it, and denied it\r\na position in the Capitol.  It was then reverentially taken in\r\ncharge by two naturalized Irish citizens, stanch Democrats, and\r\nplaced on a small pedestal in front of the White House.  One of\r\nthese worshipers of Jefferson was the public gardener, Jemmy Maher,\r\nthe other was John Foy, keeper of the restaurant in the basement\r\nof the Capitol, and famous for his witty sayings.  Prominent among\r\nhis _bon mots_ was an encomium of Representative Dawson, of Louisiana,\r\nwho was noted for his intemperate habits, the elaborate ruffles of\r\nhis shirts, and his pompous strut.  \"He came into me place,\" said\r\nFoy, \"and after ateing a few oysters he flung down a Spanish dollar,\r\nsaying, 'Niver mind the change, Mr. Foy; kape it for yourself.'\r\nAh! there's a paycock of a gintleman for you.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Richard Johnson\r\nRICHARD MENTOR JOHNSON was born at Bryant's Station, Kentucky,\r\nOctober 17th, 1781; distinguished himself in the second war with\r\nGreat Britain, and in the Indian wars; was a Representative in\r\nCongress from Kentucky, 1807-1813; was a United States Senator,\r\n1820-1829; was again a Representative, 1829-1837; was Vice-President,\r\n1837-1841; died at Frankfort, November 19th, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nSOCIETY IN JACKSON'S TIME.\r\n\r\nThe most elegant estate in Washington in Jackson's time was the\r\nVan Ness mansion, built on the bank of the Potomac, at the foot of\r\nSeventeenth Street.  Mr. John Van Ness, when a member of the House\r\nfrom the State of New York, had married Marcia, the only child of\r\nDavid Burns, one of the original proprietors of the land on which\r\nthe Federal City was located.  At that time every able-bodied man\r\nbetween eighteen and forty-five (with a few exceptions) had to\r\nperform militia duty, and the District Volunteers, organizing\r\nthemselves into a battalion, complimented Mr. Van Ness by electing\r\nhim Major.  The President commissioned him, but so strict were the\r\nCongressmen of those days that the House investigated his case,\r\nand declared that he had forfeited his seat as a Representative by\r\naccepting a commission from the General Government.  For the empty\r\nhonor of wearing a militia uniform three or four times a year, and\r\npaying a large share of the music assessments, Major Van Ness lost\r\nhis seat in Congress.\r\n\r\nDavid Burns died soon after his daughter's marriage, and she\r\ndutifully conveyed to her husband, through the intervention of a\r\ntrustee, her paternal inheritance.  With a portion of the fortune\r\nthus acquired, Major Van Ness built near the old Burns cottage a\r\nvilla which cost thirty thousand dollars, and was a palace fit for\r\na king.  Entertainments the most costly were inaugurated and\r\nmaintained in it; wit and song were heard within it, and elegance\r\nand distinction assembled under its hospitable shelter.  From its\r\ndoor-step one could see ships from Europe moored to the docks of\r\nAlexandria, while gliding by daily on the river beside it were\r\nmerchantmen from the West Indies, laden for the port of Georgetown.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Ness and Marcia Burns lived very happily together and\r\nhad one child, a daughter, who grew into womanhood, married, and\r\ndied a year after her marriage, ere the flowers in her bridal wreath\r\nhad faded.  Mrs. Van Ness loved her daughter with a love that was\r\nidolatry, and with her death she received a blow from which she\r\nnever recovered.  She abandoned all the gayeties of the world, and\r\nlaid aside her sceptre and crown as queen of society.  In the\r\ncharity school and orphan-asylum, by the bedside of the sick and\r\ndying, and in the homes of poverty, relieving its wants, she was\r\nfound to the day of her death.  Her last words to her grief-stricken\r\nhusband and friends assembled about her bedside were:  \"Heaven\r\nbless and protect you; never mind me.\"  The Mayor and City Government\r\npassed appropriate resolutions, and attended her funeral.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Ness erected a mausoleum after the pattern of the Temple\r\nof Vesta, at a cost of thirty-four thousand dollars, and placed\r\nwithin it his wife's remains and those of her father and mother.\r\nThe stately pile stood in a large inclosure for years on H Street,\r\nbeside the orphan asylum which Mrs. Van Ness richly endowed.\r\nFinally the march of improvement, needing all the space available\r\nwithin the city limits, necessitated the removal of the mausoleum\r\nto Oak Hill Cemetery, in Georgetown, where the remains of John\r\nHoward Payne were subsequently re-interred.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Ness himself enjoyed everything that worldly preferment\r\ncould bestow.  By turns he was president of a bank and Mayor of\r\nWashington, yet with his ample fortune he was always short of ready\r\nmoney.  He was never pressed by suit, however, for his good nature\r\nwas as irresistible as the man was fascinating; the dun who came\r\nwith a bill and a frown went away with a smile and--his bill.  He\r\nlived to be seventy-six years of age, when--like the patriarchs of\r\nold--he died, full of honor and greatness, and, leaving no direct\r\nissue, his property passed into the hands of collateral heirs.\r\nThey were sensible heirs, who did not seek to intervention of courts\r\nand lawyers for a distribution of their interests, but wisely and\r\namicably distributed them themselves.  The law, however, was\r\ndetermined not to be entirely shunned.  If the heirs would not go\r\nto law, the law was accommodating--it would come to them, and it\r\ncame with a romance.\r\n\r\nOne day, soon after the death of Major Van Ness, a buxom, matronly\r\nlooking dame, in heavy mourning and with tear-dimmed eyes, came\r\nupon the scene and claimed a share of the estate.  They naturally\r\ninquired her name and address, and she modestly, but firmly, told\r\nthem she was the widow of the deceased by virtue of a clandestine\r\nmarriage which had occurred in Philadelphia.  The heirs mistook\r\nher modesty for an attempt at blackmail, and acted as defendants\r\nin the suit which she instituted.  The trial is one of the celebrated\r\ncases of the District of Columbia.  It lasted upward of a month.\r\nEminent counsel were in it, and many witnesses came to prove the\r\ntruth of opposite facts.  There was no doubt that Van Ness had\r\nknown the widow and had visited her, for love letters were read in\r\ncourt from him to her; there was no doubt that some ceremony,\r\nsanctioned by a minister's presence, had been performed and assisted\r\nat by both together, but the requisite formalities to constitute\r\na valid marriage were not fully proven, and the jury disagreed.\r\nThe matronly dame in heavy mourning did not murmur: luck was against\r\nher, and she accepted her luck.  She left Washington and never\r\npressed her suit to a second trial, nor further harassed the heirs.\r\n\r\nMiss Ann G. Wright, a cousin of Mrs. Van Ness, created a great\r\nsensation in Washington by coming to her house for a home.  She\r\nwas a runaway nun from the Convent of the Visitation in Georgetown,\r\nand had been known in the community as Sister Gertrude.  No one\r\never knew rightly the cause of her sudden departure from the convent.\r\nSome said it was disappointed ambition in not being appointed\r\nsuperioress; others, that it was a case of love; but she never\r\ntold, and the ladies of the convent were just as reticent.  She\r\nbecame an inmate of the elegant Van Ness mansion and was a noted\r\nand brilliant women in society.  It is said that she had written\r\na book, exposing the inner life of the convent, to be published\r\nafter her death, but I have never heard of its appearance.  A few\r\nyears after she left the convent she accompanied the family of the\r\nAmerican Minister to Spain, and resided for some time at Madrid,\r\nwhere she was a great favorite in Court circles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was not cultured or accomplished, but he had a\r\nstrong, well-balanced mind, and he would go through forests of\r\nsophistry and masses of legal opinions straight to the point.\r\nGovernor Wise, who admired him greatly, used to tell a story\r\nillustrative of the rough bark of Old Hickory's character.  During\r\nthe Administration of President Monroe, General Jackson, in command\r\nof some troops, invaded Florida and captured Arbuthnot and Ambrister,\r\ntwo Englishmen, who, it was charged incited the Indians to\r\ndepredations.  He at once ordered a court-martial and had them\r\nhanged, with but little time to prepare for their future place of\r\nabode.  He was arraigned for the offense before the Cabinet of Mr.\r\nMonroe, and Mr. Adams, the Secretary of State, defended him on the\r\nhigh ground of international law as expounded by Grotius, Vattel,\r\nand Puffendorf.  Jackson, who had quarreled with Mr. Monroe, was\r\ndisposed to regard the matter as entirely personal.  \"Confound\r\nGrotius! confound Vattel! confound Puffendorf!\" said he; \"this is\r\na mere matter between Jim Monroe and me.\"\r\n\r\nHaving received a complimentary letter from President Bustamente,\r\nof Mexico, General Jackson sent it to the Department of State with\r\nthis indorsement:  \"Mr. Van Buren will reply to this letter of\r\nGeneral Bustamente with the frankness of a soldier.\"  When this\r\nreached Mr. Van Buren he laughed heartily, as he was neither a\r\nsoldier nor remarkable for frankness, and the clerks could not keep\r\na secret.\r\n\r\nAlthough many old citizens, whose relatives and near friends had\r\nbeen turned out of their pleasant offices by the Jackson Administration,\r\nkept quite aloof from the White House, there was no lack of social\r\nenjoyments at Washington.  Mr. Forsyth, the Secretary of State,\r\ngave a series of balls, and there were large parties at the residences\r\nof Mr. Dickerson, Secretary of the Navy, Major-General Macomb,\r\nGeneral Miller, and other prominent men, each one in numbers and\r\nguests almost a repetition of the other.  Mr. Van Buren was at all\r\nof them, shaking hands with everybody, glad to see everybody, asking\r\nabout everybody's friends, and trusting that everybody was well.\r\nColonel Richard M. Johnson was also to be seen at all public\r\ngatherings, looking, in his scarlet waistcoat and ill-fitting coat,\r\nnot as the killer of Tecumseh, but as the veritable Tecumseh himself.\r\nMr. Webster was seldom seen at public parties, but Messrs. Clay\r\nand Calhoun were generally present, with the foreign Ministers and\r\ntheir suites, who were the only wearers of mustaches in those days.\r\nThere were the magnates of the Senate and the House, each one great\r\nin his own estimation, with the _chevaliers a'industrie_, who lived\r\nas by their wits, upon long credits and new debts, and there were\r\nstrangers congregated from all sections of the country, some having\r\nbusiness before Congress, and others having come to see how the\r\ncountry was governed.  Every one, on his arrival, would take a\r\ncarriage and leave cards for the heads of departments, foreign\r\nMinisters, leading army and navy officers, and prominent members\r\nof Congress.  This would bring in return the cards of these magnates\r\nand invitations to their next party.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay was a good _raconteur_, and always had a story to illustrate\r\nhis opinions advanced in conversation.  One day, when he had been\r\ncomplimented on his neat, precise handwriting, always free from\r\nblots, interlineations, and erasures, he spoke about the importance\r\nof writing legibly, and told an amusing story about a Cincinnati\r\ngrocery-man, who, finding the market short of cranberries, and\r\nunder the impression that the fruit could be purchased cheaply at\r\na little town in Kentucky, wrote to a customer there acquainting\r\nhim with the fact and requesting him to send \"one hundred bushels\r\nper Simmons\" (the wagoner usually sent).  The correspondent, a\r\nplain, uneducated man, had considerable difficulty in deciphering\r\nthe fashionable scrawl common with merchants' clerks of late years,\r\nand the most important word, \"cranberries,\" he failed to make out,\r\nbut he did plainly and clearly read--one hundred bushels persimmons.\r\nAs the article was growing all around him, all the boys in the\r\nneighborhood were set to gathering it, and the wagoner made his\r\nappearance in due time in Cincinnati with eighty bushels, all that\r\nthe wagon body would hold, and a line from the country merchant\r\nthat the remainder would follow the next trip.  An explanation soon\r\nensued, but the customer insisted that the Cincinnati house should\r\nhave written _by_ Simmons and not _per_ Simmons.  Who paid the loss\r\nhistory doth not record.\r\n\r\nOne more of Mr. Clay's stories which he used to tell with dramatic\r\neffect:  As he was coming here one November the stage stopped for\r\nthe passengers to get supper at a little town on the mountain side,\r\nwhere there had been a militia muster that afternoon.  When the\r\nstage was ready to start, the Colonel, in full regimentals, but\r\nsomewhat inebriated, insisted on riding with the driver, thinking,\r\ndoubtless, that the fresh air would restore him.  It was not long,\r\nthough, before he fell off into the mud.  The coach stopped, of\r\ncourse, for the Colonel to regain his seat.  He soon gathered up,\r\nwhen the following colloquy ensued:  \"Well, driver (hic), we've\r\nhad quite a turn (hic) over, haint we?\"  \"No, we have not turned\r\nover at all.\"  \"I say (hic) we have.\"  \"No, you are mistaken, you\r\nonly fell off.\"  \"I say we (hic) _have;_ I'll leave it (hic) to\r\nthe com-(hic)-pany.  Haven't we (hic) had a turn (hic) over,\r\ngentlemen?\"  Being assured they had not, \"Well, driver (hic),\" said\r\nhe, \"if I'd known that (hic) I wouldn't a got out.\"\r\n\r\nThe automaton chess-player and other pieces of mechanism exhibited\r\nby Monsieur Maelzel were very popular at Washington.  The chess-\r\nplayer was the figure of a Turk of the natural size, sitting behind\r\na chest three feet and a-half in height, to which was attached the\r\nwooden seat on which the figure sat.  On the top of the chest was\r\nan immovable chess-board, upon which the eyes of the figure were\r\nfixed.  Its right hand and arm were extended on the chest, and its\r\nleft, somewhat raised, held a pipe.  Several doors in the chest\r\nand in the body of the figure having been opened, and a candle held\r\nwithin the cavities thus displayed, the doors were closed, the\r\nexhibitor wound up the works, placed a cushion under the arm of\r\nthe figure, and challenged any individual of the company present\r\nto play.\r\n\r\nIn playing, the automaton always made choice of the first move and\r\nthe white pieces.  It also played with the left arm--the inventor,\r\nas it was said, not having perceived the mistake till his work was\r\ntoo far advanced to alter it.  The hand and fingers opened on\r\ntouching the piece, which it grasped and conveyed to the proper\r\nsquare.  After a move made by its antagonist, the automaton paused\r\nfor a few moments, as if contemplating the game.  On giving check\r\nto the king, it made a signal with its head.  If a false move was\r\nmade by its antagonist it tapped on the chest impatiently, replaced\r\nthe piece, and claimed the move for itself as an advantage.  If\r\nthe antagonist delayed any considerable time the automaton tapped\r\nsmartly on the chest with the right hand.  At the close of the game\r\nthe automaton moved the knight, with its proper motion, over each\r\nof the sixty-three squares of the board in turn, without missing\r\none, and without a single return to the same square.\r\n\r\nAlthough positive proof was wanting, it was generally believed that\r\nthe movements of the figure were directed by a slender person\r\nadroitly concealed behind what was apparently a mass of machinery.\r\nThis machinery was always exhibited when in a fixed state, but\r\ncarefully excluded from view when in motion.  It was noticed by\r\nanxious observers that no variation ever took place in the precise\r\norder in which the doors were opened, thus giving the concealed\r\nplayer an opportunity to change his position.  In what was apparently\r\nthe winding up of the machine the key always appeared limited to\r\na certain number of revolutions, however different the number of\r\nmoves in the preceding game might have been.  On one occasion sixty-\r\nthree moves were executed without winding up, and once it was\r\nobserved that it was wound up without the intervention of a single\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Maelzel also exhibited an automaton trumpeter, life size,\r\nattired in a full British uniform.  It was rolled out before the\r\naudience and performed several marches and patriotic airs.  A\r\nminiature rope-dancer performed some curious feats, and small\r\nfigures, when their hands were shaken, ejaculated the words, \"Papa!\"\r\nand \"Mamma!\" in a life-like manner.  But the crowning glory of\r\nMonsieur Maelzel's exhibition was a panorama, scenic and mechanical,\r\nof the \"Burning of Moscow.\"  The view of the Russian capital, with\r\nits domes and minarets, was a real work of art.  Then the great\r\nbell of the Kremlin began to toll, and the flames could be seen\r\nmaking their way from building to building.  A bridge in the\r\nforeground was covered with figures, representing the flying citizens\r\nescaping with their household treasures.  They were followed by a\r\nregiment of French infantry, headed by its band, and marching with\r\nthe precision of veterans.  Meanwhile the flames had begun to ascend\r\nthe spires and domes, and the deep tolling of the bells was echoed\r\nby the inspiring strains of martial music.  At last, as the last\r\nplatoon of Frenchmen crossed the bridge, the Kremlin was blown up\r\nwith a loud explosion, and the curtain fell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander Hamilton, the widow of the founder of our financial\r\nsystem, passed a good portion of the latter part of her life at\r\nWashington, and finally died there.  She was the first to introduce\r\nice-cream at the national metropolis, and she used to relate with\r\nrare humor the delight displayed by President Jackson when he first\r\ntasted it.  He liked it much, and swore, \"By the Eternal!\" that he\r\nwould have ices at the White House.  The guests at the next reception\r\nwere agreeably surprised with this delicacy, especially those from\r\nthe rural districts, who, after approaching it suspiciously, melting\r\neach spoonful with their breath before consuming it, expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction by eating all that could be provided.  Mrs.\r\nHamilton was very much troubled by the pamphlet which her husband\r\nhad published when Secretary of the Treasury, in which he avowed\r\nan intrigue with the wife of one of his clerks, to exculpate himself\r\nfrom a charge that he had permitted this clerk to speculate on the\r\naction of the Treasury Department.  Mrs. Hamilton for some years\r\npaid dealers in second-hand books five dollars a copy for every\r\ncopy of this pamphlet which they brought her.  One year the number\r\npresented was unusually large, and she accidentally ascertained\r\nthat a cunning dealer in old books in New York had had the pamphlet\r\nreprinted, and was selling her copies at five dollars each which\r\nhad cost him but about ten cents each.  She possessed a good many\r\nsouvenirs of her illustrious husband, one of which, now in the\r\nwriter's possession, was the copper camp-kettle which General\r\nHamilton had while serving on the staff of the illustrious\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Alexander Stephens\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS was born in Wilkes County, Georgia,\r\nFebruary 11th, 1812; was a member of the House of Representatives,\r\nDecember 4th, 1843 to March 3d, 1859; was Vice-President of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy; was again a member of the United States\r\nCongress, October 15th, 1877, to January 1st, 1882; was Governor\r\nof Georgia, and died at Crawfordsville, Georgia, March 4th, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nJACKSON AND HIS ASSOCIATES.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson's friends celebrated the 8th of January, 1835,\r\nby giving a grand banquet.  It was not only the anniversary of the\r\nbattle of New Orleans, but on that day the last installment of the\r\nnational debt had been paid.  Colonel Benton presided, and when\r\nthe cloth was removed he delivered an exulting speech.  \"The national\r\ndebt,\" he exclaimed, \"is paid!  This month of January, 1835, in\r\nthe fifty-eighth year of the Republic, Andrew Jackson being President,\r\nthe national debt is paid! and the apparition, so long unseen on\r\nearth--a great nation without a national debt!--stands revealed to\r\nthe astonished vision of a wondering world!  Gentlemen,\" he concluded,\r\n\"my heart is in this double celebration, and I offer you a sentiment\r\nwhich, coming direct from my own bosom, will find its response in\r\nyours:  'PRESIDENT JACKSON:  May the evening of his days be as\r\ntranquil and as happy for himself as their meridian has been\r\nresplendent, glorious, and beneficent for his country.'\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, as President Jackson was leaving the Capitol,\r\nwhere he had been to attend the funeral of Representative Davis,\r\nof South Carolina, a man advanced toward him from the crowd, leveled\r\na pistol, and fired it.  The percussion-cap exploded without\r\ndischarging the pistol, and the man, dropping it, raised a second\r\none, which also missed fire.  General Jackson's rage was roused by\r\nthe explosion of the cap, and, lifting his cane, he rushed toward\r\nhis assailant, who was knocked down by Lieutenant Gedney, of the\r\nNavy, before Jackson could reach him.  The man was an English house-\r\npainter named Lawrence, who had been for some months out of work,\r\nand who, having heard that the opposition of General Jackson to\r\nthe United States Bank had paralyzed the industries of the country,\r\nhad conceived the project of assassinating him.  The President\r\nhimself was not disposed to believe that the plot originated in\r\nthe crazy brain of Lawrence, whom he regarded as the tool of\r\npolitical opponents.  A protracted examination, however, failed to\r\nafford the slightest proof of this theory, although General Jackson\r\nnever doubted it for a moment.  He was fortified in this opinion\r\nby the receipt of anonymous letters, threatening assassination,\r\nall of which he briefly indorsed and sent to Mr. Blair for publication\r\nin the _Globe_.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the executive departments, believing that \"to the\r\nvictors belong the spoils,\" did not leave an acknowledged anti-\r\nJackson Democrat in office, either in Washington city or elsewhere,\r\nwith a very few exceptions.  One of these was General Miller,\r\nCollector of the Port of Salem, Massachusetts.  The leading Jackson\r\nDemocrats in Massachusetts petitioned the President for his removal\r\nas incompetent and a political opponent, and they presented the\r\nname of a stanch Jackson Democrat for the position.  The appointment\r\nwas made, and the name of the new Collector was sent to the Senate\r\nfor confirmation.  Colonel Benton, who had been made acquainted\r\nwith the facts, requested that no action be taken until he could\r\nconverse with the President.  Going to the White House the next\r\nmorning, he said to General Jackson, \"Do you know who is the\r\nCollector of Customs at Salem, Mr. President, whom you are about\r\nto remove?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied General Jackson; \"I can't think of\r\nhis name, but Nat. Green and Ben. Hallett have told me that he is\r\nan incompetent old New England Hartford Convention Federalist.\"\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said Colonel Benton, \"the man you propose to turn\r\nout is General Miller, who fought so bravely at the battle of\r\nBridgewater.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed General Jackson, \"not the brave\r\nMiller who, when asked if he could take the British battery,\r\nexclaimed 'I'll try,'\"  \"It is the same man, Mr. President,\"\r\nresponded Benton.  General Jackson rang his bell, and when a servant\r\nappeared, said, \"Tell Colonel Donelson I want him, quick!\"  When\r\nthe private secretary entered, the President said, \"Donelson, I\r\nwant the name of the fellow I nominated for Collector of Salem\r\nwithdrawn instantly.  Then write a letter to General Miller and\r\ntell him that he shall be Collector of Salem as long as Andrew\r\nJackson is President.\"\r\n\r\nLearning that some of the Pension Agents had been withholding\r\nportions of the pensions due to Revolutionary veterans, General\r\nJackson had the charges thoroughly investigated, and a list of the\r\npensioners printed, showing what each one was entitled to receive.\r\nThis disclosed the fact that some of the Pension Agents had been\r\ncontinuing to draw the pensions of deceased soldiers for years\r\nafter their death, besides retaining portions of the pensions of\r\nothers.  Robert Temple, Pension Agent in Vermont, on hearing of\r\nthe proposed investigation, hastened to Washington, where he\r\nendeavored to bribe a clerk to falsify the list made out for the\r\nprinter.  The clerk obtained from him a list of sixty names of\r\ndeceased soldiers whose pensions he had continued to draw, and gave\r\nit to the Secretary of War.  Temple, on learning this, committed\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nThere were a few veteran office-holders at Washington, whose\r\nancestors had been appointed under Federal rule, but who had managed\r\nto veer around into Jackson Democracy.  Mr. Webster, in speaking\r\none day of a Philadelphia family which had thus kept in place, said\r\nthat they reminded him of Simeon Alleyn, Vicar of Bray, in Old\r\nEngland, who steered his bark safely through four conflicting\r\nsuccessive reigns.  A bland gentleman, he was first a Papist, then\r\na Protestant, next a Papist, and lastly a Protestant again.  \"He\r\nmust have been at times,\" said Mr. Webster, \"terribly confused\r\nbetween gowns and robes, and,\" continued the Senator, \"I can fancy\r\nhim listening at his window to the ballad written on him, as trolled\r\nforth by some graceless varlets:\r\n\r\n  \"'To teach my flock I never missed;\r\n    Kings were by God appointed,\r\n    And they are damned who dare resist\r\n    Or touch the Lord's anointed;\r\n    And this in law I will maintain\r\n    Until my dying day, sir,\r\n    That whosoever king shall reign,\r\n    I'll be the Vicar of Bray, sir.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was not only fond of repeating quotations from the old\r\nEnglish poets, but also verses from the old Sternhold and Hopkins\r\nhymn-book, which he had studied in the Salisbury meeting-house when\r\na boy, and sometimes when alone he would sing, or rather chant,\r\nthem in his deep voice, without a particle of melody.  His favorite\r\nverses were the following translation of the xviiith Psalm:\r\n\r\n  \"The Lord descended from above,\r\n   And bow'd the heavens high;\r\n   And underneath His feet He cast\r\n   The darkness of the sky.\r\n\r\n  \"On cherubs and on cherubims\r\n   Full royally He rode,\r\n   And on the wings of all the winds\r\n   Came flying all abroad.\"\r\n\r\nLate in the Jackson Administration, Richard H. Bayard came to\r\nWashington as a Senator from Delaware, to fill a vacancy caused by\r\nthe resignation of Arnold Naudain.  He was the son of James Asheton\r\nBayard, originally a stanch Federalist, who had followed his father-\r\nin-law, Richard Bassett, as a Senator from Delaware, and whose vote\r\nhad made Thomas Jefferson President of the United States instead\r\nof Aaron Burr.  He had afterward been one of the Commission which\r\nnegotiated the treaty of Ghent, and he educated his sons to succeed\r\nhim in the Senate, and in turn to qualify a grandson to represent\r\nhis State in the upper branch of the National Council.  No one\r\nfamily has furnished so many United States Senators, and they have\r\nall been inspired by the knightly courtesy of the Bayard of the\r\nolden time, who was \"without fear and without reproach.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Bayards were antagonized in Jackson's time by the\r\nWhig Claytons, the other Delaware chair in the United States Senate\r\nhaving been occupied since 1829 by John Middleton Clayton.  He was\r\nan accomplished lawyer, and one of the leaders of the Whig party.\r\nUnder his direction Delaware was a Whig State, and had it been a\r\nlarger one, Mr. Clayton would doubtless have been nominated to the\r\nVice-Presidency, if not to the Presidency.  He was zealously devoted\r\nto his party, and when, later in life, a delegation waited on him\r\nto question some of his acts as not in accordance with Whig\r\nprinciples, he rose, and drawing himself up to his full height,\r\nexclaimed:  \"What! unwhig me?  Me, who was a Whig when you gentlemen\r\nwere riding cornstalk horses in your fathers' barnyards?\"  The\r\ndelegation asked his pardon for having doubted his party loyalty,\r\nand at once withdrew.\r\n\r\nJames Alfred Pearce, of Maryland, entered the House of Representatives\r\nduring the Jackson Administration, and was successively re-elected\r\n(with the exception of a single term) until he was transferred to\r\nthe Senate in 1843, and served in that body until his death in\r\n1862.  He was another \"wheel horse\" of the Whig party, although he\r\nshrank from political controversy.  His home friends, who were very\r\nproud of his reputation, brought him forward at one time as a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency.  But he refused to permit his name\r\nto be used, on the ground that the burdens of the White House were\r\ntoo costly a price to pay for its honors.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearce was a devoted friend of the Congressional Library, and\r\nduring his long service on the Committee having it in charge he\r\nselected the books purchased.  In doing this he excluded all works\r\ncalculated in his opinion to engender sectional differences, and\r\nwhen the _Atlantic Monthly_ was established he refused to order it\r\nfor the Library.  He was the founder of the Botanic Garden, and\r\nthe Coast Survey was another object of his especial attention and\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearce's care in the choice of books was my no means a notion\r\nof his own.  From the founding of the Library it was the policy of\r\nmany of its warmest friends to exclude every publication which\r\nwould engender and foster sectional differences.  They went on the\r\nprinciple of concealing difficulties, rather than of facing them\r\nsquarely.  Very different is the broader policy now maintained in\r\nthis great library, on whose shelves every copyrighted book of the\r\nUnited States now finds a place.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearce was a type of the gentleman of the old school.  Tall,\r\nwith a commanding figure, expressive features, blue eyes, and light\r\nhair, he was a brilliant conversationalist and a welcome guest at\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nSenator William C. Preston, of South Carolina, was not only one of\r\nthe foremost orators in the Senate, but a delightful conversationalist,\r\nwith an inexhaustible fund of reminiscence and anecdote.  One of\r\nhis colleagues in the House of Representatives, Mr. Warren R. Davis,\r\nof the Pendleton district, was equally famed as a story-teller,\r\nand when they met at a social board they monopolized the conversation,\r\nto the delight of the other guests, who listened with attention\r\nand with admiration.\r\n\r\nOne evening--as the story is told--at a dinner-party, over the\r\nMadeira and walnuts, which formed the invariable last course in\r\nthose days, Mr. Preston launched forth in a eulogium on the\r\nextraordinary power of condensation, in both thought and expression,\r\nwhich characterized the ancient Greek and Latin languages, beyond\r\nanything of the kind in modern tongues.  On it he literally\r\n\"discoursed eloquent music,\" adorning it with frequent and apt\r\nillustration, and among other examples citing the celebrated\r\nadmonition of the Spartan mother to her warrior son on the eve of\r\nbattle--\"With your shield or upon it!\"  The whole party were\r\ndelighted with the rich tones and the classic teachings of the\r\ngifted colloquist, except his equally gifted competitor for\r\nconversational laurels, who, notwithstanding his enforced admiration,\r\nsat uneasily under the prolonged disquisition, anxiously waiting\r\nfor an opportunity to take his place in the picture.  At length a\r\ntitillation seizing the olfactory nerve of Mr. Preston, he paused\r\nto take a pinch of snuff, and Mr. Davis immediately filled up the\r\n_vacuum_, taking up the line of speech in this wise:\r\n\r\n\"I have listened,\" said he, \"with equal edification and pleasure\r\nto the classic discourse of our friend, sparkling with gems alike\r\nof intellect and fancy, but I differ from him _toto caelo_.  He\r\nmay say what he will as to the supreme vigor and condensation of\r\nthought and speech characteristic of classic Greece and Rome; but,\r\nfor my part, I think there is nothing equal to our own _vernacular_\r\nin these particulars, and I am fortunately able, although from a\r\nhumble source, to give you a striking and conclusive example and\r\nillustration of the fact.\r\n\r\n\"As I was returning home from Congress, some years since, I approached\r\na river in North Carolina which had been swollen by a recent freshet,\r\nand observed a country girl fording it in a merry mood, and carrying\r\na piggin of butter on her head.  As I arrived at the river's edge\r\nthe rustic Naiad emerged from the watery element.  'My girl,' said\r\nI, 'how deep's the water and what's the price of butter?'  'Up to\r\nyour waist and nine pence,' was the prompt and significant response!\r\nLet my learned friend beat that if he can, in brevity and force of\r\nexpression, by aught to be found in all his treasury of classic\r\nlore!\"\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter followed this humorous explosion, and a unanimous\r\nvote in favor of the _vernacular_ awarded the palm to the distinguished\r\nand successful wag over his classical but crest-fallen competitor.\r\n\r\nThe first restaurant established in Washington was by a Frenchman\r\nnamed Boulanger, who was a pupil of the famous Chevet, of the Palais\r\nRoyal at Paris.  His cozy establishment was on G Street, just west\r\nof the War Department, where he used to serve good cheer to General\r\nJackson, Van Buren, Clay, Sir Charles Vaughan, and other notables.\r\nHis soups were gastronomic triumphs, and he was an adept in serving\r\noysters, terrapin, reed-birds, quails, ortolan, and other delicacies\r\nin the first style of culinary perfection.  His brandies, of his\r\nown importation, were of the choicest \"bead and brand,\" and he\r\nobtained from Alexandria some of the choice old Madeira which had\r\nbeen imported before the Revolution in return for cargoes of oak\r\nstaves.  Boulanger did not cherish flattering recollections of\r\nGeneral Jackson's taste, but Mr. Van Buren used to compliment his\r\nsavory repasts and enjoy artistic cheer.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Department, which had been destroyed by fire, was\r\nrebuilt on a plan approved by President Jackson.  The eastern front,\r\nof Virginia sandstone, was a colonnade copied from the Temple of\r\nMinerva Pallas, at Athens, three hundred and thirty-six feet long,\r\nwith thirty Ionic columns.  The artist was Robert Mills, and he\r\nwished to set the building back some fifty feet from the line of\r\nthe street, to give more effect to the architecture, but General\r\nJackson directed him to bring it forward to the building line of\r\nthe street, and stuck his cane in the ground to show where this\r\nwas.  Of course, he was obeyed.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams used to occasionally attend the theatre, and he\r\nwas especially pleased with Hackett as Falstaff.  Hackett looked\r\nthe fat knight well, and his face interpreted many of his remarks\r\nand situations explicitly.  He delivered the soliloquy upon honor\r\nwith fine effect, and the scenes at Gad's Hill with Bardolph and\r\nhis nose, with Mrs. Quickly, and with the Prince when detected in\r\nhis exaggeration, were very humorous and well pointed.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hackett took his benefit it was announced that at the\r\nparticular request of Colonel David Crockett, of Tennessee, the\r\ncomedian would appear on the boards in his favorite character of\r\n\"Nimrod Wildfire,\" in the play called \"The Kentuckian; or, a Trip\r\nto New York.\"  This brought out a house full to overflowing.  At\r\nseven o'clock the Colonel was escorted by the manager through the\r\ncrowd to a front seat reserved for him.  As soon as he was recognized\r\nby the audience they made the very house shake with hurrahs for\r\nColonel Crockett, \"Go ahead!\"  \"I wish I may be shot!\"  \"Music!\r\nlet us have Crockett's March!\"  After some time the curtain rose,\r\nand Hackett appeared in hunting costume, bowed to the audience,\r\nand then to Colonel Crockett.  The compliment was reciprocated by\r\nthe Colonel, to the no small amusement and gratification of the\r\nspectators, and the play then went on.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram Powers came to Washington, on his way to Italy, he was\r\nrather mortified by the remark of a jealous Italian artist, who\r\nsaw in him a rival:  \"When you have been ten years in Italy, you\r\nmay, perhaps, be able to chisel a little;\" before, however, a fourth\r\nof that time had elapsed, Powers had finished, from the rough marble\r\nblock, the admirable bust of Chief Justice Marshall which now graces\r\nthe hall of the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nAmong the visitors to Washington early in 1834 was Charles Sumner,\r\nthen a tall, slim, ungainly young man, twenty-three years of age,\r\nwho was a student at law in Boston, but not admitted to practice.\r\nHe was introduced by his friend, Mr. Justice Story, to Chief Justice\r\nMarshall and Justices Thompson, Duval, and McLean, and was invited\r\nto dine with them.  It is not known whether Justice Story told him\r\n--as he told Edmund Quincy--that the Court was so aesthetic that\r\nthey denied themselves wine, except in wet weather.  \"But,\" added\r\nthe commentator on the Constitution, \"what I say about wine, sir,\r\ngives you our rule, but it does sometimes happen that the Chief\r\nJustice will say to me, when the cloth is removed, 'Brother Story,\r\nstep to the window and see if it does not look like rain.'  If I\r\ntell him that the sun is shining, Judge Marshall will reply:  'All\r\nthe better, for our jurisdiction extends over so large a territory\r\nthat the doctrine of chances makes it certain that it must be\r\nraining somewhere, and it will be safe to take something.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner used to attend the sittings of the Supreme Court, which\r\nwere commenced at eleven and generally lasted until half-past three.\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives met at noon and continued\r\nin session until four and sometimes five o'clock.  The Senate\r\ngenerally adjourned over from Thursday until Monday, and the House\r\nrarely sat on Saturday.\r\n\r\nAmong those with whom young Sumner became acquainted at Washington\r\nwas Dr. Francis Lieber, a well-educated German, who had fought at\r\nWaterloo.  He was for more than twenty years a professor in the\r\nUniversity of South Carolina, vouched for as \"sound on the slavery\r\nquestion,\" but he afterward became a bitter opponent of the South\r\nand of its \"peculiar institution.\"  He was a prolific contributor\r\nto the press, and he never hesitated about enlisting the services\r\nof friends and acquaintances when they could produce materials for\r\nhis use.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  A. Stevenson\r\nANDREW STEVENSON was born in Culpepper County, Virginia, in 1784;\r\nwas a Representative from Virginia in Congress, 1823-1834; was\r\nMinister to Great Britain, 1836-1841; died in Albemarle County,\r\nVirginia, January 25th, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nJACKSON'S LAST YEAR IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren, like his predecessor, Mr. Calhoun, suffered mental\r\nmartyrdom while presiding over the Senate as Vice-President.  His\r\nmanner was bland, as he thumped with his mallet when the galleries\r\nwere out of order, or declared that \"The ayes have it,\" or, \"The\r\nmemorial is referred.\"  He received his fusillade of snubs and\r\nsneers as the ghost of Chreusa received the embraces of AEneas--he\r\nheeded them not.  He leaned back his head, threw one leg upon the\r\nother, and sat as if he were a pleasant sculptured image, destined\r\nfor that niche of his life.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, then in his prime, was the champion of the United States\r\nBank in the Senate.  One day in debate he broke out in the most\r\nviolent appeal to Martin Van Buren, then presiding in the Senate,\r\nto go to the President and represent to him the actual condition\r\nof the country.  \"Tell him,\" said Clay, \"that in a single city more\r\nthan sixty bankruptcies, involving a loss of upward of fifteen\r\nmillions of dollars, have occurred.  Tell him of the alarming\r\ndecline in the value of all property.  Tell him of the tears of\r\nhelpless widows, no longer able to earn their bread, and of unclad\r\nand unfed orphans who have been driven by his policy out of the\r\nbusy pursuits in which but yesterday they were gaining an honest\r\nlivelihood.\"\r\n\r\nThe centennial birthday of George Washington was duly honored in\r\nthe city which he had founded and which bore his name.  Divine\r\nservices were performed at the Capitol, and there was a dinner at\r\nBrown's Hotel, at which Daniel Webster prefaced the first toast in\r\nhonor of the Father of his Country by an eloquent speech of an hour\r\nin length.  In the evening there were two public balls--\"one for\r\nthe gentry at Carusi's saloon, and the other for mechanics and\r\ntradesmen at the Masonic Temple.\"\r\n\r\nCongress had proposed to pay signal homage to the memory of Washington\r\non the centennial anniversary of his birth by removing his remains\r\nto the crypt beneath the dome of the Capitol.  Mr. Custis, the\r\ngrandson of Mrs. Washington, had given his assent, but John A.\r\nWashington, then the owner of Mount Vernon, declined to permit the\r\nremoval of the remains.\r\n\r\nCongress purchased Rembrandt Peale's portrait of Washington, and\r\nthe House ordered a full length picture of him from Vanderlyn, a\r\ncelebrated New York artist.  A commission was also given to Horatio\r\nGreenough for a colossal statue of Washington in a sitting posture,\r\nto be placed on a high pedestal in the centre of the rotunda of\r\nthe Capitol.  The Washington National Monument Association, after\r\nconsultation with men of acknowledged artistic taste, selected from\r\namong the numerous designs submitted a simple obelisk, five hundred\r\nfeet in height, for the erection of which the American people began\r\nat once to contribute.\r\n\r\nWhen \"the solid men of Boston\" ascertained that General Jackson\r\nhad actually signed the order for the removal of the deposits from\r\nthe Bank of the United States while enjoying their hospitalities\r\nthey were very angry.  Not long afterward they learned that the\r\nUnited States frigate Constitution, a Boston-built vessel, which\r\nwas being repaired at the Charlestown Navy Yard, was to be ornamented\r\nwith a full-length figure of General Jackson as a figure-head.\r\nThis was regarded as an insult, and the carver who was at work on\r\nthe figure was requested to stop working on it.  This he declined\r\nto do, and had his half-carved block of wood taken to the Navy\r\nYard, where he completed his task under the protection of a guard\r\nof marines.  When the figure-head was completed it was securely\r\nbolted to the cutwater of the Constitution, which was then hauled\r\nout to her anchorage, and a vessel was stationed on either side of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe Bostonians grew more and more indignant, and finally a daring\r\nyoung mariner from Cape Cod, Captain Samuel Dewey, determined that\r\nhe would decapitate the obnoxious image.  The night which he selected\r\nwas eminently propitious, as a severe rain storm raged, accompanied\r\nby heavy thunder and sharp lightning.  Dewey sculled his boat with\r\na muffled oar to the bow of the frigate, where he made it fast,\r\nand climbed up, protected by the head boards, only placed on the\r\nvessel the previous day.  Then, with a finely tempered saw, he cut\r\noff the head, and returned with it to Boston, where a party of his\r\nfriends were anxiously waiting for him at Gallagher's Hotel.  He\r\nwas at once made a lion of by the Whigs, and Commodore Elliott was\r\nalmost frantic with rage over the insult thus offered to his chief.\r\n\r\nDewey soon afterward went to Washington, where he exhibited the\r\ngrim features of the head to several leading Whigs, and finally\r\ncarried it, tied up in a bandana handkerchief, to the Navy Department.\r\nSending in his card to Mr. Mahlon Dickerson, then the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, he obtained an audience.  He was a short, chunky sailor-\r\nman, with resolute blue-gray eyes, which twinkled as he said, \"Have\r\nI the honor of addressing the Secretary of the Navy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have,\" replied Mr. Dickerson, \"and, as I am very busy, I will\r\nthank you to be brief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dickerson,\" said the Captain, \"I am the man who removed the\r\nfigure-head from the Constitution, and I have brought it here to\r\nrestore it.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Dickerson threw himself back in his chair and looked with\r\nastonishment at the man who had cast such an indignity on the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said he, in an angry tone, \"you are the man who had\r\nthe audacity to disfigure Old Ironsides?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I took the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I will have you arrested immediately,\" and the Secretary\r\nreached toward his bell to summon his messenger.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Mr. Secretary,\" said Captain Dewey; \"you, as a lawyer, know\r\nthat there is no statute against defacing a ship-of-war, and all\r\nyou can do is to sue me for trespass, and that in the county where\r\nthe offense was committed.  If you desire it, I will go back to\r\nMiddlesex County, Massachusetts, and stand my trial.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dickerson reflected a moment and said:  \"You are right; and\r\nnow tell me how you took away the head.\"\r\n\r\nDewey told his story, and the story goes that Secretary Dickerson\r\nasked him to wait while he stepped over to the White House, followed\r\nby a messenger carrying the head.  When General Jackson saw it,\r\nand heard the Secretary's story, he burst into a fit of uncontrollable\r\nlaughter.  \"Why, that,\" he cried at length--\"why, that is the most\r\ninfernal graven image I ever saw.  The fellow did perfectly right.\r\nYou've got him, you say; well, give him a kick and my compliments,\r\nand tell him to saw it off again.\"  Dewey was after this frequently\r\nat Washington, and he finally obtained the appointment of Postmaster\r\nin a small Virginia town.  He used to have on his visiting cards\r\nthe representation of a handsaw, under which was inscribed, \"I\r\ncame, I saw, I conquered.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson always liked the physical excitement of a horse-\r\nrace, where a large assemblage thrills with but one thought from\r\nthe word \"Go!\" until the winning horse reaches the goal, and he\r\nwas always to be seen at the races over the National Course, just\r\nnorth of Washington City.  Delegations of sporting men from the\r\nAtlantic cities crowded into the metropolis during the race weeks;\r\nthere were jockey-club dinners and jockey-club balls; and the course\r\nresounded to the footfalls of noted horses, especially Boston, Sir\r\nCharles, Emily, and Blue Dick.  In 1836 General Jackson had a filly\r\nof his own raising brought from the Hermitage and entered for a\r\nrace by Major Donelson, his private secretary.  Nor did he conceal\r\nhis chagrin when the filly was beaten by an imported Irish colt\r\nnamed Langford, owned by Captain Stockton, of the navy, and he had\r\nto pay lost wagers amounting to nearly a thousand dollars, while\r\nMr. Van Buren and other devoted adherents who had bet on the filly\r\nwere also losers.\r\n\r\nBaillie Peyton, of Tennessee, used to narrate an amusing account\r\nof a visit which he made to the National Race Course with General\r\nJackson and a few others to witness the training of some horses\r\nfor an approaching race.  They went on horseback, General Jackson\r\nriding his favorite gray horse, and wearing his high white fur hat\r\nwith a broad band of black crape, which towered above the whole\r\ngroup.  The General greatly enjoyed the trials of speed, until a\r\nhorse named Busiris began to rear and plunge.  This stirred Old\r\nHickory's mettle, and he rode forward to give some energetic advice\r\nto the jockey, but just then he saw that the Vice-President was\r\nambling along at his side on an easy-going nag.  \"Mr. Van Buren,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"get behind me, sir!  They will run over you, sir!\"\r\nand the Little Magician, with his characteristic diplomacy, which\r\nnever gave offense, gracefully retired to the rear of his chief,\r\nwhich, Mr. Peyton used to say, was his place.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson used to visit his stable every morning, until he\r\nbecame feeble, and he paid especial attention to the manner in\r\nwhich his horses were shod.  He never, after he became President,\r\nplayed cards or billiards, nor did he read anything except the\r\n_Daily Globe_ and his private correspondence.  When he received a\r\nletter that he desired one of his Cabinet to read, he would indorse\r\non the back \"_Sec. of_ ----, A. J.\"  He used to smoke a great deal,\r\nusing either a new clay pipe with a long stem, or a pipe made from\r\na piece of corn-cob, with a reed stem.\r\n\r\nCock-fighting had been one of General Jackson's favorite home\r\namusements, and he had become the possessor of a breed of fowl that\r\nwas invincible in Tennessee.  He had some of these pugnacious birds\r\nbrought to Washington, and one spring morning he rode out toward\r\nBladensburg, with a select party of friends, to see \"a main\" fought\r\nbetween the Hermitage and the Annapolis cocks.  The birds were not\r\nonly trained to fight, but were equipped for their bloody work.\r\nTheir heads and necks were plucked, their tail feathers were closely\r\ntrimmed, and their natural spurs were cut off and replaced by\r\n\"gaffs,\" or sharp blades of finely tempered steel.  Each bird had\r\nhis trainer, ready to administer stimulants and to sponge the blood\r\nfrom the wounds inflicted by the gaffs.  General Jackson was very\r\nconfident that his favorites would again be victorious, but there\r\nwas no fight, to the great disappointment of all present, who\r\ndoubtless possessed what has been called \"the devil's nerve,\" which\r\nthrills with base enjoyment in the visible pain of man, beast, or\r\nbird.  The long confinement in coops on the stages, or some other\r\nunknown cause, appeared to have deprived the Hermitage birds of\r\ntheir wonted pluck, and the Annapolis cocks crowed in triumph.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand wedding at Arlington in Jackson's time, when\r\nLieutenant Robert Edward Lee, fresh from West Point, came up from\r\nFortress Monroe to marry the heiress of the estate, Mary Custis.\r\nOld Mr. Custis was delighted with his soldier son-in-law, whose\r\nfather had said of Washington that he was \"First in war, first in\r\npeace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\"  The Marshalls,\r\nthe Carters, the Fitzhughs, the Taylors, and other \"first families\r\nof Virginia\" were represented at the wedding, and the happy young\r\ncouple went, after the ceremony, to old Fortress Monroe, where they\r\nresided for a while in a casement fitted up as officers' quarters.\r\nThe next year Lieutenant Lee brought his bride back to Arlington,\r\nwhich was their happy home until he was persuaded to enlist under\r\nthe \"stars and bars\" of the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nOne of General Jackson's favorites was Jemmy Maher, an Irishman,\r\nwhom he had appointed public gardener, a position of some responsibility\r\nin those days, when its holder had to look after the gardens at\r\nthe White House, the Capitol, and the Departments.  Jemmy's father\r\nhad been forced to flee to this country to avoid punishment for\r\nparticipation in the Irish rebellion of '98, and the son regarded\r\nall Englishmen as his foes.  General Jackson, who had \"whipped the\r\nBritish\" at New Orleans, was the object of his especial adoration,\r\nespecially as he used to forgive him when the Superintendent of\r\nPublic Buildings occasionally complained that he drank whisky rather\r\ntoo freely.  \"Shure, Mr. President,\" he would say, \"I niver drink\r\nunless I am dry, and it would be mane in me not to invite me frinds\r\nto jine and take a drap with me.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was not fond of the theatre, but he went to see\r\nthe widely heralded performance of Miss Fanny Kemble.  The niece\r\nof Mrs. Siddons, and the daughter of Charles Kemble, she had been\r\ntrained from early childhood to sustain the reputation of her\r\ndistinguished theatrical family.  A good-looking young woman, with\r\nlarge, dark eyes, a profusion of dark hair, a low forehead, and\r\nhealthy strawberry-and-cream complexion, she was personally\r\nattractive, and wonderfully effective.  Every movement, gesture,\r\nand inflection of voice had been carefully studied, and when making\r\nan ordinary remark in conversation she would deliver her words with\r\na deliberate attempt at stage effect.  Her Juliet with her father's\r\nRomeo, was her best character, but they failed signally as Lady\r\nTeazle and Charles Surface in the _School for Scandal_.\r\n\r\nMiss Kemble did not remain long on the American stage, as she became\r\nthe wife of Mr. Pierce Butler, a wealthy slave-owner, in 1834.\r\nThe next year her _Journal_ appeared, in which she criticised what\r\nshe had seen and heard with a free hand, but \"'twas pretty Fanny's\r\nway,\" and no one got angry over her silly twaddle.  One of the fair\r\nauthor's predictions concerning the fate of our polity yet awaits\r\nfulfillment.  \"It is my conviction,\" said she, \"that America will\r\nbe a monarchy before I am a skeleton.\"  Fifty years have passed\r\nsince these words were written, and the prophetess has developed\r\ninto a portly matron, anything but a skeleton, and very unlike the\r\nslender Miss of Jackson's time.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson was President, the agricultural town of Cheshire,\r\nin Western Massachusetts, which had been drilled by its Democratic\r\npastor, named Leland, into the unanimous support of the Sage of\r\nMonticello, determined to present him with the biggest cheese that\r\nhad ever been seen.  So on a given day every cow-owner brought his\r\nquota of freshly made curd to a large cider-press, which had been\r\nconverted into a cheese-press, and in which a cheese was pressed\r\nthat weighted one thousand six hundred pounds.  It was brought to\r\nWashington in the following winter on a sled, under the charge of\r\nParson Leland, and in the name of the people of Cheshire, was\r\nformally presented to President Jefferson in the then unfinished\r\nEast Room.  Jefferson, of course, returned thanks, and after having\r\na great wedge cut from the cheese, to send back to the donors, he\r\ninvited all present to help themselves.  The cheese was variegated\r\nin appearance, owing to so many dairies having contributed the\r\ncurd, but the flavor was pronounced the best ever tasted in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nJackson's admirers thought that every honor which Jefferson had\r\never received should be paid to him, so some of them, residing in\r\na rural district of New York, got up, under the superintendence of\r\na Mr. Meacham, a mammoth cheese for \"Old Hickory.\"  After having\r\nbeen exhibited at New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, it was\r\nkept for some time in the vestibule at the White House, and was\r\nfinally cut at an afternoon reception on the 22d of February, 1837.\r\nFor hours did a crowd of men, women, and boys hack at the cheese,\r\nmany taking large hunks of it away with them.  When they commenced,\r\nthe cheese weighted one thousand four hundred pounds, and only a\r\nsmall piece was saved for the President's use.  The air was redolent\r\nwith cheese, the carpet was slippery with cheese, and nothing else\r\nwas talked about at Washington that day.  Even the scandal about\r\nthe wife of the President's Secretary of War was forgotten in the\r\ntumultuous jubilation of that grand occasion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson received that day for the last time at the White\r\nHouse, and was so feeble that he had to remain seated.  Mrs. Donelson\r\nstood on one side, and on the other was Van Buren, who was inaugurated\r\nas President a fortnight later.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  your obt. sert.\r\n  William R. King\r\nWILLIAM RUFUS KING was born in North Carolina, April 1st, 1786;\r\nwas a Representative in Congress from Alabama from November 4th,\r\n1811, until he resigned to accompany William Pinkney to Russia as\r\nSecretary of Legation, April 23d, 1816; was United States Senator\r\nfrom Alabama from March 4th, 1819, until he resigned to go as\r\nMinister to France, April 9th, 1844; was again United States Senator\r\nfrom December 7th, 1846 to March 4th, 1853; was elected Vice-\r\nPresident on the Pierce ticket in 1852, as a Democrat, receiving\r\ntwo hundred and fifty-four electoral votes, against forty-two\r\nelectoral votes for W. R. Graham, a Whig; having gone to Europe\r\nfor his health, he took the oath of office near Havana, March 4th,\r\n1853; returning to his home at Catawba, Alabama, where he died,\r\nApril 18th, 1853, the day following his arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nVAN BUREN'S STORMY ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the electoral votes for the eighth President of the United\r\nStates were being counted, in the presence of the two Houses of\r\nCongress, Senator Clay remarked to the Vice-President Van Buren,\r\nwith courteous significance, \"It is a cloudy day, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun will shine on the 4th of March, sir!\" was the Little\r\nMagician's confident reply.\r\n\r\nThe prediction was fulfilled, for on Van Buren's inaugural morning,\r\nMarch 4th, 1837, the sun shone brightly, and there was not a cloud\r\nto be seen.  Washington was crowded with strangers from all parts\r\nof the country, and in anticipation of the time set for the ceremony\r\ngreat numbers began to direct their way at an early hour to the\r\nCapitol.  Congregating before the eastern portico of the Capitol,\r\nthe dense mass of humanity reminded those who had traveled abroad\r\nof the assembled multitude in front of St. Peter's on Easter Sunday\r\nwaiting to receive the Papal blessing.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson and President-elect Van Buren were escorted from\r\nthe White House to the Capitol by a volunteer brigade of cavalry\r\nand infantry and by several Democratic political organizations.\r\nGeneral Jackson and his successor rode in an elegant phaeton,\r\nconstructed of oak from the original timber of the frigate\r\nConstitution.  It had been made at Amherst, Massachusetts, and was\r\npresented by sixty admirers.  It had one seat, holding two persons,\r\nand a high box for the driver in front, bordered with a deep hammer-\r\ncloth.  The unpainted wood was highly polished, and its fine grain\r\nwas brought out by a coat of varnish, while on a panel on either\r\nside was a representation of \"Old Ironsides\" under full sail.  The\r\nphaeton was drawn by General Jackson's four iron-grey carriage-\r\nhorses, with elaborate brass-mounted harness.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Capitol, General Jackson and Mr. Van Buren went to\r\nthe Senate Chamber, where they witnessed Colonel Johnson take his\r\noath of office as Vice-President.  They then repaired to a platform\r\nerected over the steps of the eastern portico, followed by the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, the Senators, and the principal executive officers.\r\nA cheer greeted the old hero, who had risen from a sick-bed, against\r\nthe protest of his physician, that he might grace the scene, and\r\na smile of satisfaction lit up his wan, stern features as he stood\r\nleaning on his cane with one hand and holding with the other his\r\ncrape-bound white fur hat, while he acknowledged the compliment\r\npaid him by a succession of bows.  Mr. Van Buren then advanced to\r\nthe front of the platform, and with impressive dignity read in a\r\nclear, distinct voice his inaugural address.  His manner and emphasis\r\nwere excellent, yet the effect upon the multitude was not what\r\nmight have been expected from so great a collection of men devoted\r\nto his support.  When he had concluded Chief Justice Taney administered\r\nthe oath of office, and no sooner had Van Buren kissed the Bible,\r\nas a pledge of his assent, than General Jackson advanced and shook\r\nhim cordially by the hand.  The other dignitaries on the platform\r\nfollowed with their congratulations, the populace cheered, and the\r\nbands played \"Hail to the Chief!\"\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren and ex-President Jackson were then escorted\r\nback to the White House, where for three hours a surging tide of\r\nhumanity swept past the new Chief Magistrate, congratulating him\r\non his inauguration.  The assemblage was a promiscuous one, and\r\nthe reception was as disorderly an affair as could well be imagined.\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon the members of the Diplomatic\r\nCorps called in a body, wearing their court dresses, and Don Calderon\r\nde la Barca, who was their Dean, presented a congratulatory address.\r\nIn his reply, Mr. Van Buren made his only known _lapsus linguae_\r\nby addressing them as the \"Democratic corps.\"  It was not until\r\nafter his attention had been called to the mistake that he corrected\r\nhimself, and stated that he had intended to say \"Diplomatic Corps.\"\r\nIn that evening two inauguration balls were given.\r\n\r\nMany strangers had been unable to find conveyances to take them\r\naway and could not obtain lodging places.  It was interesting,\r\ntoward nightfall, to witness the gathering anxiety in many a good\r\ncitizen's countenance as he went from boarding-house to hotel, and\r\nfrom hotel to private residence, seeking lodgings in vain.  Money\r\ncould indeed procure the most luxurious dishes and the rarest\r\nbeverages; but while the palate could be gratified there was no\r\nrest for weary limbs.  \"Beds! beds! beds!\" was the general cry.\r\nHundreds slept in the market-house on bundles of hay, and a party\r\nof distinguished Bostonians passed the night in the shaving-chairs\r\nof a barber's shop.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson soon left for Tennessee, relieved from the cares\r\nof the Presidential station, and exhibiting an unwonted gaiety of\r\nspirit.  During the previous winter he had not expected to live\r\nuntil the conclusion of his term, and he could but feel buoyant\r\nand happy in finding himself sufficiently recovered to undertake\r\nthe journey, with the prospect of enjoying some years at the\r\nHermitage, in the midst of the agricultural occupations of which\r\nhe was so fond.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren was the first President who had not been born\r\na British subject, yet he was at heart a monarchist, opposed to\r\nuniversal suffrage, and in favor of a strong central government,\r\nalthough he had reached his exalted position by loud professions\r\nof democracy.  He endeavored to establish a personal intimacy with\r\nevery one presented to him, and he ostensibly opened his heart for\r\ninspection.  The tone of his voice was that of a thorough frankness,\r\naccompanied by a pleasant smile, but a fixed expression at the\r\ncorners of his mouth and the searching look of his keen eyes showed\r\nthat he believed, with Talleyrand, that language was given to\r\nconceal thought.  He found himself saddled at the commencement of\r\nhis Administration with national financial embarrassments, bequeathed\r\nas a legacy by his \"illustrious predecessor,\" as he designated\r\nGeneral Jackson in one of his messages.  The destruction of the\r\nUnited States Bank had forced the transfer of the national funds,\r\nwhich it had held on deposit, to the State banks.  They had loaned\r\nthese funds on securities, often of doubtful value or worthless,\r\nand when the day of reckoning came general bankruptcy ensued.\r\nManufacturers were obliged to discharge their workmen; provisions\r\nwere scarce and dear in the Atlantic States, because funds could\r\nnot be obtained for the removal eastward of the Western crops; and\r\nthere was much actual distress in the large cities on the sea coast.\r\n\r\nTo quiet the popular clamor, President Van Buren convened Congress\r\nin an extra session, and in his message to that body on its assembling\r\nhe proposed the establishment of an independent Treasury, with sub-\r\nTreasuries in different cities, for the safe keeping of the public\r\nmoney, entirely separate from the banks.  The Whigs opposed this\r\nindependent Treasury scheme, but, to the surprise of those with\r\nwhom he had of late been politically affiliated, it received the\r\ncordial support of Mr. Calhoun.  When Congress began to discuss\r\nthis measure, he became its champion in the Senate, and soon \"locked\r\nhorns\" with Mr. Clay, who led its opponents.  The debate was\r\ncontinued session after session, and in time Messrs. Clay and\r\nCalhoun passed from their discussion of national finances into an\r\nacrimonious reciprocal review of the acts, votes, and motions of\r\neach other during the preceding thirty years.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate in the House on the bill authorizing the issue\r\nof Treasury notes there was an all-night session.  The Democrats\r\nhad determined in caucus to \"sit out the bill,\" and whenever a Whig\r\nmoved to adjourn his motion was promptly negatived.  As darkness\r\ncame on the lamps were lighted and trimmed, candles were brought\r\ninto the hall, and the older and feebler members \"pairing off,\"\r\ntook their cloaks and hats and left.  The House being in Committee\r\nof the Whole, whenever they found no quorum voting, were obliged\r\nby the parliamentary usage to rise and report that fact to the\r\nHouse.  When this was done, and the House was again in session as\r\na House, behold, a quorum instantly appeared; and then, by the same\r\nlaw, they were obliged to return into Committee again.  This happened\r\nso often that at length gentlemen of the Administration side became\r\nirritated, remonstrated, demanded that members should be counted\r\nin their seats, whether they had voted or no, and at length came\r\nto insist that individuals, by name, be compelled to vote.  Such\r\na motion having been made in one case, a voice cried out in the\r\nconfusion which filled the chamber:  \"How are you going to do it?\"\r\nand the query was succeeded by shouts of laughter, mingled with\r\nsounds of vexation.\r\n\r\nAs midnight approached it was curious to watch the various effects\r\nproduced by the scene on different temperaments.  Some yawned\r\nfearfully; others cursed and swore; others shook their sides with\r\nmerriment; others reasoned and remonstrated with their neighbors;\r\nsome very composedly stretched themselves upon the sofas, having\r\nfirst borrowed chair-cushions enough to support their somnolent\r\nheads; other bivouacked on three chairs, while some, not finding\r\na convenient couch, stretched themselves flat on the floor of the\r\nHouse, with, perhaps, a volume of the Laws of the United States as\r\ntheir pillow.\r\n\r\nAt half-past one a call of the House was ordered, the doors were\r\nclosed, and one hundred and forty-nine members were found to be\r\npresent.  This House went into Committee of the Whole to come out\r\nof it again, and the yeas and nays were called until the clerk grew\r\nhoarse.  Thus rolled the hours away.  Candles burned down to their\r\nsockets, forming picturesque grottoes of spermaceti as they declined;\r\nlamps went out in suffocating fumes.  Some insisted on having a\r\nwindow up, others on having it down.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning light began to dawn through the large south windows\r\nof the Representatives' Hall, it contrasted strongly with the glare\r\nof lights, the smoke of the lamps, and all the crowded tumult\r\nwithin.  At four o'clock the Sergeant-at-Arms arrived with Corwin,\r\nGiddings, and a dozen other captured absentees, who were, one by\r\none, required to account for their absence by the Speaker, who\r\nwould say:  \"Mr. A. B., you have absented yourself from the House\r\nduring its sittings, contrary to law, and without leave of the\r\nHouse; what excuse have you to offer?\"  And then the unfortunate\r\nmen made out the best story they could.  Some had been sick; others\r\nhad a sick wife; others had got a bad headache from the late session;\r\nsome had witnessed such night scenes on former occasions, and did\r\nnot wish to see the like again; one had told the Sergeant that he\r\nwould come if he would send a hack for him, and no hack had been\r\nsent; while one very cavalierly informed the House that the reason\r\nwhy he had been absent was that he had not been there.  Many were\r\nexcused altogether; others discharged from custody on paying their\r\nfines (about two dollars each to the Sergeant for his fee of arrest).\r\nOne batch having thus been disposed of, the officer was dispatched\r\nto make another haul, and in the meantime the old game was continued;\r\nand, as neither party would yield, the unprofitable contest was\r\nprolonged, not till broad daylight merely, but down to eleven\r\no'clock, when, all propositions of compromise having been rejected,\r\nthe debate was regularly renewed.  Finally, at a quarter before\r\nfive o'clock, the House adjourned, quite fagged out.\r\n\r\nAmong other evidences of the bitter and ferocious spirit which\r\ncharacterized political contests in those days was the duel between\r\nRepresentative Cilley, of Maine, and Representative Grimes, of\r\nKentucky, in which the former fell.  Mr. Cilley, in a speech\r\ndelivered in the House of Representatives, criticised a charge of\r\ncorruption brought against some unnamed Congressman in a letter\r\npublished in the New York _Courier and Enquirer_, over the signature\r\nof \"A Spy in Washington,\" and indorsed in the editorial columns of\r\nthat paper.  Mr. James Watson Webb, the editor of the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, immediately visited Washington and sent a challenge to\r\nMr. Cilley by Mr. Graves, with whom he had but a slight acquaintance.\r\nMr. Cilley declined to receive the hostile communication from Mr.\r\nGraves, without making any reflection on the personal character of\r\nMr. Webb.  Mr. Graves then felt himself bound by the unwritten code\r\nof honor to espouse the cause of Mr. Webb, and challenged Mr. Cilley\r\nhimself.  This challenge was accepted, and the preliminaries were\r\narranged between Mr. Henry A. Wise, as the second of Mr. Graves,\r\nand Mr. George W. Jones, as the second of Mr. Cilley.  Rifles were\r\nselected as the weapons, and Mr. Graves found difficulty in obtaining\r\none, but was finally supplied by his friend, Mr. Rives, of the\r\n_Globe_.  The parties met, the ground was measured, and the combatants\r\nwere placed; on the fourth fire Mr. Cilley fell, shot through the\r\nbody, and died almost instantly.  Mr. Graves, on seeing his antagonist\r\nfall, expressed a desire to render him some assistance, but was\r\ntold by Mr. Jones, \"My friend is dead, sir!\"  Mr. Cilley, who left\r\na wife and three young children, was a popular favorite, and his\r\ntragic end caused a great excitement all over the country.  Mr.\r\nWise was generally blamed for having instigated the encounter;\r\ncertainly he did not endeavor to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol had its comedies as well as its tragedies, and the\r\nleading comedian was Thomas Corwin, a Representative from Ohio,\r\nwho was a type of early Western culture and a born humorist.  He\r\nwas a middle-sized, somewhat stout man, with pleasing manners, a\r\nfine head, sparkling hazel eyes, and a complexion so dark that on\r\nseveral occasions--as he used to narrate with great glee--he was\r\nsupposed to be of African descent.  \"There is no need of my working,\"\r\nsaid he, \"for whenever I cannot support myself in Ohio, all I should\r\nhave to do would be to cross the river, give myself up to a Kentucky\r\nnegro-trader, be taken South, and sold for a field hand.\"  He always\r\nhad a story ready to illustrate a subject of conversation, and the\r\ndry manner in which he enlivened his speeches by pungent witticism,\r\nwithout a smile on his own stolid countenance, was irresistible.\r\n\r\nHe was once addressing a Whig mass meeting at Marietta, Ohio, and\r\nwas taking especial pains not to say anything that could offend\r\nthe Abolitionists, who were beginning to throw a large vote.  A\r\nsharp witted opponent, to draw him out asked:  \"Shouldn't niggers\r\nbe permitted to sit at the table with white folks, on steamboats\r\nand at hotels?\"  \"Fellow-citizens,\" exclaimed Corwin, his swarthy\r\nfeatures beaming with suppressed fun, \"I ask you whether it is\r\nproper to ask such a question of a gentleman of my color?\"  The\r\ncrowd cheered and the questioner was silenced.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  M. Van Buren\r\nMARTIN VAN BUREN was born at Kinderhook, New York, December 5th,\r\n1782; was a United States Senator from New York from December 3d,\r\n1821, to December 20th, 1828, when he resigned to accept the office\r\nof Governor of New York; this position he resigned on the 12th of\r\nMarch, 1829, having been appointed by President Jackson Secretary\r\nof State of the United States; this position he resigned August\r\n1st, 1831, having been appointed by President Jackson Minister to\r\nGreat Britain, but the Senate rejected his nomination; was elected\r\nVice-President on the Jackson ticket in 1832; was elected President\r\nin 1836; was defeated as the Democratic candidate for President in\r\n1840; was the candidate of the Anti-Slavery party for President in\r\n1848, and died at Kinderhook, New York, July 24th, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Administration of Mr. Van Buren that the English\r\nAbolitionists first began to propagate their doctrines in the\r\nNorthern States, where the nucleus of an anti-slavery party was\r\nsoon formed.  This alarmed the Southerners, who, under the lead of\r\nMr. Calhoun, threatened disunion if their \"peculiar institution\"\r\nwas not let alone.  The gifted South Carolinian having in January,\r\n1838, paid a high compliment in debate to John Randolph for his\r\nuncompromising hostility to the Missouri Compromise, Mr. Clay said:\r\n\"I well remember the Compromise Act and the part taken in that\r\ndiscussion by the distinguished member from Virginia, whose name\r\nhas been mentioned, and whose death I most sincerely lament.  At\r\nthat time we were members of the other House.  Upon one occasion,\r\nduring a night session, another member from Virginia, through\r\nfatigue and the offensive exhalations from one of the surrounding\r\nlamps, fainted in his seat and was borne to the rear of the\r\nRepresentatives' Hall.  Calling some one to the Speaker's chair,\r\nI left my place to learn the character and extent of his illness.\r\nReturning to the desk, I was met in one of the aisles by Mr.\r\nRandolph, to whom I had not spoken for several weeks.  'Ah, Mr.\r\nSpeaker,' said he, 'I wish you would leave Congress and go to\r\nKentucky.  I will follow you there or anywhere else.'  I well\r\nunderstood what he meant, for at that time a proposition had been\r\nmade to the Southern members, and the matter partly discussed by\r\nthem, of leaving Congress in the possession of the Northern members\r\nand returning home, each to his respective constituents.  I told\r\nMr. Randolph that I could not then speak to him about the matter,\r\nand requested him to meet me in the Speaker's room early the next\r\nmorning.  With his usual punctuality he came.  We talked over the\r\nCompromise Act, he defending his favorite position and I defending\r\nmine.  We were together an hour, but to no purpose.  Through the\r\nwhole he was unyielding and uncompromising to the last.  We parted,\r\nshook hands, and promised to be good friends, and I never met him\r\nagain during the session.  Such,\" continued Mr. Clay, \"was the part\r\nMr. Randolph took in that discussion, and such were his uncompromising\r\nfeelings of hostility to the North and all who did not believe with\r\nhim.  His acts came near shaking this Union to the centre and\r\ndesolating this fair land.  The measures before us now, and the\r\nunyielding and uncompromising spirit are like then, and tend to\r\nthe same sad and dangerous end--dissolution and desolation, disunion\r\nand ruin.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, in 1838, Mr. Webster gave in his opinion that\r\nCongress had the power to abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia.  That power, he said, was granted in the most express,\r\nexplicit, and undoubted terms.  It declared that Congress should\r\nhave \"exclusive jurisdiction over all subjects whatsoever in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\"  Mr. Webster said that he had searched and\r\nlistened for some argument or some law to controvert this position.\r\nhe had read and studied carefully the act of cession of the ten\r\nmiles square from Maryland and Virginia, and he could find nothing\r\nthere, and nowhere else, to gainsay the plain and express letter\r\nof the Constitution.  This inspired the Abolitionists with hope\r\nthat Mr. Webster would become the leader of the crusade against\r\nslavery that they had decided to inaugurate.  At that time he\r\nunquestionably leaned toward emancipation, not only in the District\r\nof Columbia, but everywhere in the United States.  This was noticed\r\nby the Southern leaders, who began to tempt him--with promises of\r\nsupport for the Presidency--promises which were subsequently broken\r\nagain and again that a more subservient and available tool might\r\nbe placed in power.\r\n\r\nBefore allying himself with the South, Mr. Webster endeavored to\r\nidentify himself with the West by investing largely in a city laid\r\nout on paper in a township in Rock Island County, Illinois.  It\r\nwas at the mouth of Rock River, and it was to have borne the name\r\nof Rock Island City.  Fletcher Webster went out there and remained\r\nfor a time, I think, accompanied by his friend, George Curson.\r\nCaleb Cushing was also interested in the embryo city, but somehow\r\nit was not a success.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster had, however, a very vague idea of the \"Great West\" of\r\nhis day.  On one occasion when he was in the Senate a proposition\r\nwas before it to establish a mail-route from Independence, Mo., to\r\nthe mouth of the Columbia River, some three thousand miles, across\r\nplains and mountains, about the extent of which the public then\r\nknew no more than they did of the interior of Tibet.  Mr. Webster,\r\nafter denouncing the measure generally, closed with a few remarks\r\nconcerning the country at large.  \"What do we want?\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"with this vast, worthless area?  This region of savages and wild\r\nbeasts, of deserts of shifting sands and whirlwinds of dust, of\r\ncactus and prairie dogs?  To what use could we ever hope to put\r\nthese great deserts, of those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable\r\nand covered to their very base with eternal snow?  What can we ever\r\nhope to do with the western coast, a coast of three thousand miles,\r\nrock-bound, cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it?  What\r\nuse have we for this country?\"\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce, who had served two terms in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was then elected to the Senate.  He proved a\r\nvaluable recruit for the Southern ranks, as when in the House he\r\nhad risen one day to a question of privilege, and warmly resented\r\nthe reading by Mr. Calhoun in the Senate of an article from the\r\nConcord _Herald of Freedom_, which declared that the Abolitionists\r\nin New Hampshire were as one to thirty.  This journal, Mr. Pierce\r\nsaid, \"was too insignificant, too odious, in the eyes of his\r\nconstituents, to be cited as authority.  No age or country had ever\r\nbeen free from fanatics, and with equal justice might the whole\r\npeople of New York be charged with being followers of Matthias as\r\nthe people of New Hampshire for favoring the designs of the Knapps\r\nand Garrisons and Thompsons.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Smith Prentiss, who came to Washington during the Van\r\nBuren Administration to claim a seat in Congress as a Representative\r\nfrom Mississippi, was the most eloquent speaker that I have ever\r\nheard.  The lame and lisping boy from Maine had ripened, under the\r\nSouthern sun, into a master orator.  The original, ever-varying,\r\nand beautiful imagery with which he illustrated and enforced his\r\narguments impressed Webster, Clay, Everett, and even John Quincy\r\nAdams.  But his forte lay in arraigning his political opponents,\r\nwhen his oratory was \"terrible as an army with banners;\" nothing\r\ncould stand against the energy of his look, gesture, and impassioned\r\nlogic, when once he was fairly under way, in denouncing the tricks\r\nand selfish cunning of mere party management.  The printed reports\r\nof his speeches are mere skeletons, which give but a faint idea of\r\nthem.  Even the few rhetorical passages that are retained have lost\r\nmuch of their original form and beauty.  The professional stenographers\r\nconfessed themselves utterly baffled in the attempt to report him,\r\nand he was quite as unfitted to report himself.  Indeed, he complained\r\nthat he never could reproduce the best thoughts, still less the\r\nexact language, of his speeches.\r\n\r\nThe principal antagonist of Mr. Prentiss, in the courts of Mississippi,\r\nwas Joseph Holt, a young Kentucky lawyer, who had acquired a national\r\nreputation for oratory by a speech which he made in the National\r\nDemocratic Convention of 1836, when he advocated the nomination of\r\nColonel Richard M. Johnson in a speech of great beauty and power.\r\nHis arguments were persuasive, the tones of his voice were melodious,\r\nand he insinuated himself and his cause into the hearts of his\r\naudience, rather than carried them by storm.  Devoted to the South\r\nand its peculiar institution, he was welcomed in the State of\r\nMississippi, and soon took a prominent position at the bar of its\r\nhigher courts.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus King, of Alabama, who was elected President _pro\r\ntempore_ of the Senate while Colonel Johnson was Vice-President,\r\nwas a prim, spare bachelor, known among his friends as \"Miss Nancy\r\nKing.\"  When a young man he had accompanied the Minister to Russia,\r\nWilliam Pinkney, to St. Petersburg, as Secretary of the Legation\r\nof the United States.  Residing there for two years, he acquired\r\nthe formal manners of the Court of the Emperor Alexander, with a\r\ndiplomatic craftiness which he always retained.  He was a courteous\r\npresiding officer, as was thus oddly exemplified while he occupied\r\nthe chair.  The two Senators from the State of Arkansas pronounced\r\nthe name of their State differently.  Mr. King punctiliously observed\r\nthe difference, invariably recognizing one as \"the gentleman from\r\nAr-kan-sas,\" and the other as \"the gentleman from Ark-an-sas.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren was much exercised by a difficulty in the Pennsylvania\r\nLegislature, which the State militia was called out to quell, and\r\nwhich it was thought might result in a demand for the intervention\r\nof United States troops.  Thaddeus Stevens, then an ardent Whig,\r\nwas a leader in the attempt to force eleven illegally elected\r\nmembers into the House at the point of the bayonet, the troops\r\nhaving their muskets loaded with buckshot.  When the enterprise\r\ncollapsed, Stevens jumped from a back window of the Capitol and\r\nran off to Gettysburg, where he remained without claiming his seat\r\nfor about a month, when he came in and offered to take the oath,\r\nbut the House resolved, with great solemnity, that the seat was\r\nvacant, although others who had been out nearly as long were admitted\r\nwithout hesitation.\r\n\r\nA prominent young Virginia lawyer, named William Smith, who practiced\r\nat Culpepper Court-House, became interested in a mail-route between\r\nWashington City and Milledgeville, Georgia, and he grew to be an\r\nextensive contractor.  Many of his mail-routes were but little more\r\nthan bridle-paths, over which the mails were carried on horseback.\r\nWith an eye to the main chance, and with a laudable desire to extend\r\nthe mail facilities of Virginia, Mr. Smith managed to secure a\r\nlarge number of \"expeditions\" through Parson Obadiah Bruin Brown,\r\ncommonly called \"Parson Obadiah Bruin Beeswax Brown,\" the Superintendent\r\nof the contract office of the Post-office Department.  In place of\r\nthe horseback system stage lines would be substituted, and this\r\nservice would be frequently \"expedited\" without much of a view to\r\n\"productiveness,\" from one trip to three or six trips per week.\r\nAll of these \"expeditions\" were noted by stars (* *) at the bottom\r\nof Smith's vouchers, which, interpreted, meant \"extra allowance.\"\r\nSo frequently did these stars appear in the Virginia contractor's\r\naccounts that he soon came to be known in the Post-office Department\r\nas \"Extra Billy\" Smith, and it adhered to him in after life, when\r\nhe became a member of the House of Representatives and afterward\r\nGovernor of Virginia.  He still lives at Warrenton, a hale and\r\nhearty old man.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren had an abundance of political nicknames.  He was \"the\r\nsweet little fellow\" of Mr. Ritchie of the _Richmond Inquirer_,\r\nand \"the Northern man with Southern principles\" of the _Charleston\r\nCourier;_ Mr. Clinton baptized him \"the Political Grimalkin;\" Mr.\r\nCalhoun, \"the Weazel;\" while he helped himself to the still less\r\nflattering name of \"the follower in the footsteps\"--that is, the\r\nsuccessor of his predecessor, a sort of masculine _Madame Blaize_,\r\n\r\n  \"Who strove the neighborhood to please,\r\n   With manners wondrous winning,\r\n   And never followed wicked ways,\r\n   Except when she was sinning.\"\r\n\r\nwho clad all the hungry and naked office-holders \"that left a pledge\r\nbehind\" of supporting him; and, like that good dame, led the way\r\nto all those who came behind her.\r\n\r\nThe Southern nullifiers, who had been \"squelched\" by General Jackson,\r\nbegan to revive under the more genial rule of Mr. Van Buren, and\r\nthey established an \"organ\" called the Washington _Chronicle_.  It\r\nwas edited by Richard K. Cralle, who came from Leesburg, Virginia.\r\nHe was a well-educated gentleman, ultra in his opinions on free\r\ntrade and Southern rights; but those who were enthusiastic in their\r\npraises of his editorials did not subscribe to the _Chronicle_, or\r\nif they did, never condescended to pay their subscriptions.  So\r\nthe paper ruined its printers and then gave up the ghost, Mr.\r\nCalhoun securing a department clerkship for Mr. Cralle.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Tristram Burgess\r\nTRISTRAM BURGESS was born at Rochester, Massachusetts, February\r\n26th, 1770; was a Representative in Congress from Rhode Island from\r\nDecember 1st, 1825, until March 3d, 1835; was defeated as the Whig\r\ncandidate for Congress, and afterward as the Whig candidate for\r\nGovernor, and died at Providence, Rhode Island, October 13th, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren's wife (by birth Miss Hannah Hoes, of Columbia\r\nCounty, New York) had been dead nineteen years when he took possession\r\nof the White House, accompanied by his four sons, and presided over\r\nthe official receptions and dinner parties with his well-known tact\r\nand politeness.  In the November following his inauguration, his\r\neldest son and private secretary, Colonel Abraham Van Buren (who\r\nwas a graduate of the Military Academy at West Point, and who had\r\nserved on the staff of General Worth), was married to Miss Angelica\r\nSingleton, a wealthy South Carolina lady, who had been educated at\r\nPhiladelphia, and who had passed the preceding winter at Washington\r\nin the family of her relative, Senator Preston.  On the New Year's\r\nday succeeding the wedding Mrs. Van Buren, assisted by the wives\r\nof the Cabinet officers, received with her father-in-law, the\r\nPresident.  Her rare accomplishments, superior education, beauty\r\nof face and figure, grace of manner, and vivacity in conversation\r\ninsured social success.  The White House was refurnished in the\r\nmost expensive manner, and a code of etiquette was established\r\nwhich rivaled that of a German principality.\r\n\r\nThe President endeavored to restore the good feeling between the\r\nAdministration and Washington \"society,\" which had been ruptured\r\nduring the political rule of General Jackson.  He gave numerous\r\nentertainments at the White House, and used to attend those given\r\nby his Cabinet, which was regarded as an innovation, as his\r\npredecessors had never accepted social invitations.  Ex-President\r\nAdams, the widow of President Madison, and the widow of Alexander\r\nHamilton each formed the centre of a pleasant coterie, and the\r\nPresident was open in the expression of his desire that the members\r\nof his Cabinet and their principal subordinates should each give\r\na series of dinner-parties and evening receptions during the\r\nsuccessive sessions of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-parties were very much alike, and those who were in\r\nsuccession guests at different houses often saw the same table\r\nornaments, and were served by the same waiters, while the fare was\r\nprepared by the same cook.  The guests used to assemble in the\r\nparlor, which was almost invariably connected with the dining-room\r\nby large folding doors.  When the dinner was ready the doors were\r\nthrown open, and the table was revealed, laden with china and cut-\r\nglass ware.  A watery compound called vegetable soup was invariably\r\nserved, followed by boiled fish, overdone roast beef or mutton,\r\nroast fowl or game in season, and a great variety of puddings,\r\npies, cakes, and ice-creams.  The fish, meat, and fowl were carved\r\nand helped by the host, while the lady of the house distributed\r\nthe vegetables, the pickles, and the dessert.  Champagne, without\r\nice, was sparingly supplied in long, slender glasses, but there\r\nwas no lack of sound claret, and with the dessert several bottles\r\nof old Madeira were generally produced by the host, who succinctly\r\ngave the age and history of each.  The best Madeira was that labeled\r\n\"The Supreme Court\" as their Honors, the Justices, used to make a\r\ndirect importation every year, and sip it as they consulted over\r\nthe cases before them every day after dinner, when the cloth had\r\nbeen removed.  Some rare specimens of this wine can still be found\r\nin Washington wine-cellars.\r\n\r\nAt the evening parties the carpet was lifted from the room set\r\napart for dancing, and to protect the dancers from slipping the\r\nfloor was chalked, usually in colors.  The music was almost invariably\r\na first and second violin, with flute and harp accompaniments.\r\nLight refreshments, such as water-ices, lemonade, negus, and small\r\ncakes were handed about on waiters between every two or three\r\ndances.  The crowning glory of the entertainment, however, was the\r\nsupper, prepared under the supervision of the hostess, aided by\r\nsome of her intimate friends, who also loaned their china and\r\nsilverware.  The table was covered with _a la mode_ beef, cold\r\nroast turkey, duck, and chicken, fried and stewed oysters, blanc-\r\nmange, jellies, whips, floating islands, candied oranges, and\r\nnumerous varieties of tarts and cakes.  Very often the older men\r\nwould linger after the ladies had departed, and even reassemble\r\nwith those, and discuss the wines _ad libitum_, if not _ad nauseam_,\r\nwhile the young men, after having escorted the ladies to their\r\nrespective homes, would meet again at some oyster-house or go out\r\non a lark, in imitation of the young English bloods in the favorite\r\nplay of Tom and Jerry.  Singing, or rather shouting, they would\r\nbreak windows, wrench off knockers, call up doctors, and transpose\r\nsign-boards; nor was there a night watchman to interfere with their\r\nroistering.\r\n\r\nA decided sensation was created at Washington during the Van Buren\r\nAdministration by the appearance there of a handsome and well-\r\neducated Italian lady, who called herself America Vespucci and\r\nclaimed descent from the navigator who gave his name to this\r\ncontinent.  Ex-President Adams and Daniel Webster became her especial\r\nfriends, and she was soon a welcome guest in the best society.  In\r\na few weeks after her arrival she presented a petition to Congress\r\nasking, first, to be admitted to the rights of citizenship; and,\r\nsecondly, to be given \"a corner of land\" out of the public domain\r\nof the country which bore the name of her ancestor.  An adverse\r\nreport, which was soon made, is one of the curiosities of Congressional\r\nliterature.  It eulogized the petitioner as \"a young, dignified,\r\nand graceful lady, with a mind of the highest intellectual culture,\r\nand a heart beating with all our own enthusiasm in the cause of\r\nAmerica and human liberty.\"  The reasons why the prayer of the\r\npetitioner could not be granted were given, but she was commended\r\nto the generosity of the American people.  \"The name of America--\r\nour country's name--should be honored, respected, and cherished in\r\nthe person of the interesting exile from whose ancestor we derive\r\nthe great and glorious title.\"\r\n\r\nA subscription was immediately opened by Mr. Haight, the Sergeant-\r\nat-Arms of the Senate, and Judges, Congressmen, and citizens vied\r\nwith one another in their contributions.  Just then it was whispered\r\nthat Madame Vespucci had borne an unenviable reputation at Florence\r\nand at Paris, and had been induced by a pecuniary consideration to\r\nbreak off an intimacy with the Duke of Orleans, Louis Philippe's\r\noldest son, and come to Washington.  Soon afterward the Duke's\r\nyounger brother, the Prince de Joinville, came to this country,\r\nand refused to recognize her, which virtually excluded her from\r\nreputable society.  For some years subsequently she resided in\r\nluxurious seclusion with a wealthy citizen of New York, in the\r\ninterior of that State, and after his death she returned to Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring the Van Buren Administration James P. Espy came to Washington\r\nto initiate what has grown into the Weather Signal Service.  He\r\nwas a Pennsylvanian by birth, and so poor in early life that when\r\nseventeen years of age he had not been able to learn to read.  He\r\nsubsequently mastered the English language and the classics, and\r\nlong before he knew why began to study the mystery of the moving\r\nclouds and to form his storm theories.  At last he asked of Congress\r\nan appropriation of five thousand dollars a year for five years,\r\nbut he was met with jibes and ridicule.  Senator Preston, of South\r\nCarolina, said Espy was a madman, too dangerous to be at large,\r\nand the Senator would vote a special appropriation for a prison in\r\nwhich to confine him.  Espy was in the Senate gallery at the time.\r\nWounded to the quick, he left the Capital and went to New York,\r\nwhere he delivered a course of lectures with great success.  They\r\nwere repeated in Boston, and he made money enough to enable him to\r\nvisit Europe.\r\n\r\nNot long after reaching Liverpool, January 6th, 1839, a great storm\r\noccurred.  He went to Lloyd's, consulted the newspapers as they\r\narrived, noted the direction of the wind as given at different\r\nplaces, and from these data constructed the first great storm map\r\never prepared, with the hour points marked.  Every line and curve\r\nand point exemplified his theory.  He was at no loss now for\r\naudiences.  He appeared before the British Association of Scientists\r\nat London, at which Sir John Herschel was present, an interested\r\nauditor.  He crossed the channel to Paris, and the Academy of\r\nSciences appointed a committee, composed of the illustrious Arago,\r\n\"to report upon his observations and theory.\"  The effect of this\r\nreport, when it reached Washington, was not much different from\r\nthat which followed, afterward, the announcement of Morse's first\r\ntransmitted message over the wire from Washington to Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAided by General Jackson and the \"machinery\" of the Democratic\r\nparty, engineered by Amos Kendall, Mr. Van Buren secured for himself\r\nthe re-nomination for the Presidency.  But he had great obstacles\r\nto contend with.  The financial condition of the country, deranged\r\nby the absence of the controlling power of the United States Bank,\r\ngrew worse and worse.  There was a total stagnation of business\r\nthroughout the Union, and from every section came tidings of\r\nembarrassment, bankruptcy, and ruin.  There were no available funds\r\nfor the purchase of Western produce and its transportation to the\r\nAtlantic markets, so it remained in the hands of the farmers, who\r\ncould not dispose of it except at great sacrifice.  In Ohio, for\r\nexample, pork was sold at three dollars a hundred pounds, and wheat\r\nat fifty cents per bushel, while the price of agricultural labor\r\nwas but thirty-seven and a-half cents a day.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was carried on with great bitterness in Congress,\r\nwhere the leading Whigs cordially united in a decisive warfare on\r\nthe Democrats.  General Harrison was eulogized as a second Cincinnatus\r\n--plowman, citizen, and general--and the sneering remark that he\r\nresided in a log-cabin was adopted as a partisan watch-word.  The\r\nmost notable speech was by Mr. Ogle, of Pennsylvania, who elaborately\r\nreviewed the expensive furniture, china, and glassware which had\r\nbeen imported for the White House by order of President Van Buren.\r\nHe dwelt on the gorgeous splendor of the damask window curtains,\r\nthe dazzling magnificence of the large mirrors, chandeliers, and\r\ncandelabra; the centre-tables, with their tops of Italian marble;\r\nthe satin-covered chairs, tabourets, and divans; the imperial\r\ncarpets and rugs, and, above all, the service of silver, including\r\na set of what he called gold spoons, although they were of silver-\r\ngilt.  These costly decorations of the White House were described\r\nin detail, with many humorous comments, and then contrasted with\r\nthe log-cabins of the West, where the only ornamentation, generally\r\nspeaking, was a string of speckled birds'-eggs festooned about a\r\nlooking-glass measuring eight by ten inches, and a fringed window\r\ncurtain of white cotton cloth.\r\n\r\nHaving described the furniture and the table service of the White\r\nHouse, as purchased by direction of the President, Mr. Ogle proceeded\r\nto sketch Van Buren's New Year receptions.  \"Instead,\" said he,\r\n\"of weekly receptions, when all the people were at liberty to\r\npartake of the good cheer of the President's house, there had been\r\nsubstituted one cold, stiff, formal, and ceremonious assembly on\r\nthe first day of every year.  At this annual levee, notwithstanding\r\nits pomp and pageantry, no expense whatever is incurred by the\r\nPresident personally.  No fruits, cake, wine, coffee, hard cider,\r\nor other refreshments of any kind are tendered to his guests.\r\nIndeed, it would militate against all the rules of court etiquette,\r\nnow established at the palace, to permit vulgar eating and drinking\r\non this grand gala day.  The Marine Band, however, is always ordered\r\nfrom the Navy Yard and stationed in the spacious front hall, from\r\nwhence they swell the rich saloons of the palace with 'Hail to the\r\nChief!' 'Wha'll be King but Charley?' and other humdrum airs, which\r\nravish with delight the ears of warriors who have never smelt\r\npowder.  As the people's cash, and not his own, pays for all the\r\nservices of the Marine Band, its employment at the palace does not\r\nconflict with the peculiar views of the President in regard to the\r\nobvious difference between public and private economy.\r\n\r\n\"At these 'annual State levees,' the great doors of the 'East Room,'\r\n'Blue Elliptical Saloon,' 'Green Drawing Room,' and 'Yellow Drawing\r\nRoom' are thrown open at twelve o'clock 'precisely' to the anxious\r\nfeet of gayly appareled noblemen, honorable men, gentlemen, and\r\nladies of all the nations and kingdoms of the earth, many of whom\r\nappear ambitiously intent upon securing an early recognition from\r\nthe head of the mansion.  The President, at the 'same instant of\r\ntime,' assumes his station about four feet within the 'Blue Elliptical\r\nSaloon,' and facing the door which looks out upon the spacious\r\nfront hall, but is separated from it, as before remarked, by a\r\nscreen of Ionic columns.  He is supported on the right and left by\r\nthe Marshal of the District of Columbia and by one of the high\r\nofficers of the Government.  The Marine Band having been assigned\r\ntheir position at the eastern end of the hall, with all their fine\r\ninstruments in full tune, 'at the same identical moment' strike up\r\none of our most admired 'national airs;' and forthwith a current\r\nof life flows in at the wide-spread outer door of the palace, and\r\nglides with the smoothness of music through the spacious hall by\r\nthe Ionic screen into the royal presence.  Here (to drop for a\r\nmoment my liquid figure) each and every individual is presented\r\nand received with a gentle shake of the hand, and is greeted with\r\nthat 'smile eternal' which plays over the soft features of Mr. Van\r\nBuren, save when he calls to mind how confoundedly 'Old Tip' chased,\r\ncaught, and licked Proctor and Tecumseh.  Immediately after the\r\nintroduction or recognition the current sets toward the 'East Room'\r\nand thus this stream of living men and women continues to flow and\r\nflow and flow, for about the space of three hours--the 'Democratic\r\nPresident' being the only orb around which all this pomp, pride,\r\nand parade revolve.  To him all these lesser planets turn, 'as the\r\nsunflower turns' to the sun, and feel their colors brightened when\r\na ray of favor or a 'royal smile' falls upon them.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  W. L. Marcy\r\nWILLIAM LEARNED MARCY was born at Sturbridge, Massachusetts, December\r\n12th, 1786; was United States Senator from New York from December\r\n5th, 1831, to July, 1832, when he resigned; was Governor of the\r\nState of New York, 1833-1839; was Secretary of War under President\r\nPolk, March 5th, 1845, to March 3d, 1849; was Secretary of State\r\nunder President Pierce, March 7th, 1853, to March 4th, 1857, and\r\ndied at Ballston Spa, New York, July 4th, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE LOG CABIN AND HARD CIDER CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign of 1840 surpassed in excitement and\r\nintensity of feeling all which had preceded it, and in these respects\r\nit has not since been equaled.  It having been sneeringly remarked\r\nby a Democratic writer that General Harrison lived in a log cabin\r\nand had better remain there, the Whigs adopted the log cabin as\r\none of their emblems.  Log cabins were raised everywhere for Whig\r\nheadquarters, some of them of large size, and almost every voting\r\nprecinct had its Tippecanoe Club with its choristers.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our land the power of song was invoked to\r\naid a Presidential candidate, and immense editions of log cabin\r\nsong-books were sold.  Many of these songs were parodies on familiar\r\nballads.  One of the best compositions, the authorship of which\r\nwas ascribed to George P. Morris, the editor of the New York\r\n_Mirror_, was a parody on the Old Oaken Bucket.  The first verse\r\nran:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! dear to my soul are they days of our glory,\r\n   The time-honored days of our national pride;\r\n   When heroes and statesmen ennobled our story,\r\n   And boldly the foes of our country defied;\r\n   When victory hung o'er our flag, proudly waving,\r\n   And the battle was fought by the valiant and true\r\n   For our homes and our loved one, the enemies braving,\r\n   Oh! then stood the soldier of Tippecanoe--\r\n   The iron-armed soldier, the true-hearted soldier\r\n   The gallant old soldier of Tippecanoe.\"\r\n\r\nMass conventions were held by the Whigs in the larger cities and\r\nin the central towns at the great West.  They were attended by\r\nthousands, who came from the plow, the forge, the counter, and the\r\ndesk, at a sacrifice of personal convenience and often at considerable\r\nexpense, to give a hearty utterance to their deep-felt opposition\r\nto the party in power.  Delegations to these conventions would\r\noften ride in carriages or on horseback twenty-five or thirty miles,\r\ncamping out during the excursion.  They carried banners, and often\r\nhad a small log cabin mounted on wheels, in which was a barrel of\r\nhard cider, the beverage of the campaign.  On the day of the\r\nconvention, and before the speaking, there was always a procession,\r\nin which the delegations sang and cheered as they marched along,\r\nsometimes rolling balls on which were the names of the States,\r\nwhile the music of numerous bands aided in imparting enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe speaking was from a platform, over which floated the national\r\nflag, and on which were seated the invited guests, the local\r\npolitical magnates, the clergymen of the place, and generally a\r\nfew Revolutionary soldiers, who were greeted with loud applause.\r\nThe principal orators during the campaign were Henry Clay, Daniel\r\nWebster, William C. Preston, Henry A. Wise, Thomas Corwin, Thomas\r\nEwing, Richard W. Thompson, and scores of less noted names.  General\r\nHarrison took the stump himself at several of the Western gatherings,\r\nand spoke for over an hour on each occasion.  His demeanor was that\r\nof a well-bred, well-educated, venerable Virginia gentleman,\r\ndestitute of humor and fond of quoting from the classic authors.\r\n\r\nThe favorite campaign document, of which hundreds of thousands were\r\ncirculated through the mails under the franks of the Whig Congressmen,\r\nwas the reply in the House of Representatives by Thomas Corwin, of\r\nOhio, to an attack upon Harrison's military record made by Mr.\r\nIsaac E. Crary.  A native of Connecticut, Mr. Crary had migrated\r\nto Michigan, and was the first and the only Representative from\r\nthat recently admitted State.  Anxious to distinguish himself, he\r\nundertook to criticise the military career of General Harrison with\r\ngreat unfairness and partisan vigor.  Mr. Corwin replied the next\r\nday in one of the most wonderful speeches ever delivered at\r\nWashington.  For vigorous argument and genuine wit the speech has\r\nrarely been equaled.  Those who heard it agree that his defense of\r\nHarrison was overwhelming and the annihilation of Crary complete.\r\nThe House was convulsed with laughter at the richness and originality\r\nof the humor, and at times almost awed by the great dignity and\r\nprofound arguments of the orator.  The pages of history were\r\nransacked for illustrations to sustain the speaker, and all were\r\npoured in rapid profusion upon the head of poor Crary, who sat\r\namazed and stupefied at the storm he had provoked.  As Corwin\r\nproceeded the members left their seats and clustered thickly about\r\nhim, the reporters laid down their pens, and everybody gave themselves\r\nup to the enjoyment of the hour.  As Mr. Corwin painted in mock\r\nheroic style the knowledge of military affairs which the lawyer\r\nmember from Michigan had acquired from reading _Tidd's Practice_\r\nand _Espinasse's Nisi Prius_, studies so happily adapted to the\r\nart of war, the House fairly roared with delight.\r\n\r\nHe drew a mirth-provoking picture of Crary in his capacity of a\r\nmilitia brigadier at the head of his legion on parade day, with\r\nhis \"crop-eared, bushy-tailed mare and sickle hams--the steed that\r\nlaughs at the shaking of the spear, and whose neck was clothed with\r\nthunder,\" and likened Crary to Alexander the Great with his war-\r\nhorse, Bucephalus, at the head of his Macedonian phalanx.\r\n\r\nHe traced all the characteristic exploits of the assembled throng\r\non those old-time mustering occasions.  The wretched diversity in\r\nheight and build of the marshaled hosts; the wild assortment of\r\naccoutrements, from the ancient battle-ax to the modern broom-stick,\r\nthe trooping boys, the slovenly girls, the mock enthusiasm of the\r\nspectators, all were painted with a master's hand.  Finally, after\r\nreciting Crary's deeds of valor and labor during the training day,\r\nCorwin left him and his exhausted troop at a corner grocery assuaging\r\nthe fires of their souls with copious draughts of whisky drank from\r\nthe shells of slaughtered watermelons.  When Mr. Corwin came to\r\ngive the history of General Harrison and defend his military record,\r\nhe rose to the height of pure eloquence, and spoke with convincing\r\nforce and unanswerable logic.  The fate of Crary was sealed.\r\nProbably no such personal discomfiture was ever known from the\r\neffect of a single speech.  He never recovered from the blow, and\r\nwas known at home and abroad as \"the late General Crary.\"  Even at\r\nhome the farmers and the boys, in watermelon season, would always\r\noffer him the fruit with sly jests and jeers and a joke at his\r\nmilitary career; but his public life and usefulness were at an end.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1840, there was received at Washington the initial number\r\nof _The Log Cabin_, a campaign paper published at New York by Horace\r\nGreeley.  It was printed at the office of the _New Yorker_, then\r\nedited by Mr. Greeley, on a thin super-royal sheet, and the price\r\nfor twenty-eight weekly issues was fifty cents for a single copy--\r\nlarger numbers much less.  It contained a few illustrations bearing\r\non the election, plans of General Harrison's battle-grounds, and\r\ncampaign songs set to music.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley's paper was recommended to leading Whigs at Washington\r\nby Thurlow Weed, and he obtained eighty thousand subscribers, the\r\nWhig Congressmen recommending the paper to their constituents.\r\nThe _Log Cabin_ was the foundation of the _Tribune_, and thenceforth\r\nuntil his death Mr. Greeley was well known at the National Capital.\r\nHe was a man of intense convictions and indomitable industry, and\r\nhe wielded an incisive, ready pen, which went straight to the point\r\nwithout circumlocution or needless use of words.  Although he was\r\na somewhat erratic champion of Fourierism, vegetarianism, temperance,\r\nanti-hanging, and abolition, there was a \"method in his madness,\"\r\nand his heretical views were evidently the honest convictions of\r\nhis heart.  Often egotistical, dogmatic, and personal, no one could\r\nquestion his uprightness and thorough devotion to the noblest\r\nprinciples of progressive civilization.  Inspired by that true\r\nphilanthropy that loves all mankind equally and every one of his\r\nneighbors better than himself, he was often victimized by those\r\nwhose stories he believed and to whom he loaned his hard-earned\r\nsavings.  The breath of slander did not sully his reputation, and\r\nhe never engaged in lobbying at Washington for money, although\r\nfriendship several times prompted him to advocate appropriations\r\nfor questionable jobs--the renewal of patents which were monopolies,\r\nand the election of Public Printers who were notoriously corrupt.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay \"sulked in his tent\" until August, when he went to Nashville\r\nand addressed a Whig Convention.  \"Look,\" said he, in conclusion,\r\n\"at the position of Tennessee and Kentucky.  They stood side by\r\nside, their sons fought side by side, at New Orleans.  Kentuckians\r\nand Tennesseans now fight another and a different kind of battle.\r\nBut they are fighting now, as then, a band of mercenaries, the\r\ncohorts of power.  They are fighting a band of office-holders, who\r\ncall General Harrison a coward, an imbecile, an old woman!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, General Harrison is called a coward, but he fought more\r\nbattles than any other General during the last war and never\r\nsustained a defeat.  He is no statesman, and yet he has filled more\r\ncivil offices of trust and importance than almost any other man in\r\nthe Union.\"\r\n\r\nA man in the crowd here cried out, \"Tell us of Van Buren's battles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Clay, \"I will have to use my colleague's language\r\nand tell you of Mr. Van Buren's '_three_ great battles!'  He says,\r\nthat he fought General Commerce and conquered him; that he fought\r\nGeneral Currency and conquered him, and that, with his Cuban allies,\r\nhe fought the Seminoles and got conquered!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kendall came to the aid of President Van Buren, and resigned\r\nthe office of Postmaster-General that he might sustain the\r\nAdministration with his powerful pen.  He thus brought upon himself\r\nmuch malignant abuse, but in the many newspaper controversies in\r\nwhich he was engaged he never failed to vindicate himself and\r\noverwhelm his assailant with a clearness and vigor of argument and\r\na power of style with which few pens could cope.  He was not only\r\nassailed with the rudest violence of newspaper denunciation, but\r\nhe was alluded to by Whig speakers in scornful terms, while\r\ncaricaturists represented him as the Mephistopheles of the Van\r\nBuren Administration, and Log Cabin Clubs roared offensive campaign\r\nsongs at midnight before his house, terrifying his children by the\r\ndischarges of a small cannon.  Defeat stared him in the face, but\r\nhe never quailed, but faced the storm of attack in every direction,\r\nand zealously defended the Democratic banner.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs of Maine led off by electing Edward Kent Governor, and\r\nfive of her eight Congressmen, including William Pitt Fessenden\r\nand Elisha H. Allen, who afterward, when Minister from the Sandwich\r\nIslands to the United States, fell dead at a New Year's reception\r\nat the White House.  Delaware, Maryland, and Georgia soon afterward\r\nfollowed suit, electing Whig Congressmen and State officers.  In\r\nOctober the Ohio Whigs elected Thomas Corwin Governor, by a majority\r\nof nearly twenty thousand over Wilson Shannon, and it was evident\r\nthat the triumphant election of Harrison and Tyler was inevitable.\r\nIn New York William H. Seward was re-elected Governor, but he ran\r\nover seven thousand votes behind General Harrison, owing to certain\r\nlocal issues.\r\n\r\nFor some months before the election the Democrats mysteriously\r\nintimated that at the last moment some powerful engine was to be\r\nput into operation against the Whig cause.  Mr. Van Buren himself\r\nwas reported as having assured an intimate friend, who condoled\r\nwith him on his gloomy prospects, that he \"had a card to play yet\r\nwhich neither party dreamed of.\"  The Attorney-General and the\r\nDistrict Attorneys of New York and Philadelphia were as mysterious\r\nas Delphic oracles, while other Federal officers in those cities\r\nwere profound and significant in their head-shakings and winks in\r\nreference to disclosures which were to be made just before the\r\nPresidential election, and which were to blow the Whigs \"sky high.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the magazine was exploded with due regard to dramatic\r\neffect.  Carefully prepared statements, supported by affidavits,\r\nwere simultaneously published in different parts of the country,\r\nshowing that a man named Glentworth had been employed by some\r\nleading New York Whigs in 1838 to procure illegal votes from\r\nPhiladelphia.  The men were ostensibly engaged in laying pipe for\r\nthe introduction of Croton water.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Grinnell, Blatchford, Wetmore, Draper, and other leading\r\nNew York Whigs implicated promptly published affidavits denying\r\nthat they had ever employed Glentworth to supply New York with Whig\r\nvoters from Philadelphia.  It was proven, however, that he had\r\nreceived money and had taken some thirty Philadelphians to New York\r\nthe day before the election.  There was no evidence, however, that\r\nmore than one of them had voted, and the only effect of the disclosure\r\nwas to add the word \"pipe-laying\" to the political vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs fought their battle to the end with confidence of success,\r\nand displayed an enthusiasm and harmony never witnessed in this\r\ncountry before or since.  Commencing with the harmonious selection\r\nof General Harrison as their candidate, they enlisted Clay and\r\nWebster, his defeated rivals, in his support, and, having taken\r\nthe lead, they kept it right through, really defeating the Democrats\r\nin advance of the campaign.  The South were not satisfied with Mr.\r\nVan Buren's attitude on the admission of Texas, which stood knocking\r\nfor admission at the door of the Union, and \"the Northern man with\r\nSouthern principles\" was not the recipient of many Southern votes:\r\n\r\n  \"Then hurrah for the field where the bald eagle flew,\r\n   In pride o'er the hero of Tippecanoe!\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Tho. Corwin\r\nTHOMAS CORWIN was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, July 29th,\r\n1794; was a Representative in Congress from Ohio from December 5th,\r\n1831, to 1840, when he resigned and was elected Governor of Ohio;\r\nwas defeated for Governor of Ohio in 1842; was a Senator from Ohio\r\nfrom December 1st, 1845, to July 22d, 1850, when he resigned, having\r\nbeen appointed Secretary of the Treasury by President Taylor, and\r\nserved until March 3d, 1853; was again a Representative in Congress\r\nfrom Ohio, December 5th, 1859, to March 3d, 1861; was Minister to\r\nMexico, March 22d, 1861, to September 1st, 1864; died suddenly at\r\nWashington City, December 18th, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nENTER WHIGS--EXIT DEMOCRATS.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 many of the States voted for Presidential electors on\r\ndifferent days, which rendered the contest more exciting as it\r\napproached its close.  There was no telegraphic communication, and\r\nthere were but few lines of railroad, so that it was some time\r\nafter a large State had voted before its complete and correct\r\nreturns could be received.  At last all the back townships had been\r\nheard from and the exultant Whigs were certain that they had elected\r\ntheir candidates by a popular majority of over one hundred thousand!\r\nTwenty States had given Harrison and Tyler two hundred and thirty-\r\nfour electoral votes, while Van Buren and Johnson had received but\r\nsixty electoral votes in six States.  The log cabins were the scenes\r\nof great rejoicing over this unparalleled political victory, and\r\nthe jubilant Whigs sang louder than before:\r\n\r\n  \"Van, Van, Van is a used-up man.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral William Henry Harrison was by birth and education a Virginian.\r\nHis father, Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, was the largest man in the old Congress of the\r\nConfederation, and when John Hancock was elected President of that\r\nbody Harrison seized him and bore him in his arms to the chair.\r\nOn reaching manhood William Henry Harrison migrated to Ohio, then\r\nthe far West, and for forty years was prominently identified with\r\nthe interests, the perils, and the hopes of that region.  Universally\r\nbeloved in the walks of peace, and somewhat distinguished by the\r\nability with which he had discharged the duties of a succession of\r\noffices which he had filled, yet he won his greatest renown in\r\nmilitary service.  But he had never abjured the political doctrines\r\nof the Old Dominion, and his published letters and speeches during\r\nthe Presidential campaign which resulted in his election showed\r\nthat he was a believer in what the Virginians called a strict\r\nconstruction of financial questions, internal improvements, the\r\nveto-power, and the protection of negro slavery.  His intellect\r\nwas enriched with classical reminiscences, which he was fond of\r\nquoting in writing or in conversation.  When he left his residence\r\non the bank of the Ohio for the seat of Government he compared his\r\nprogress to the return of Cicero to Rome, congratulated and cheered\r\nas he passed on by the victorious Cato and his admiring countrymen.\r\n\r\nOn General Harrison's arrival at Washington, on a stormy afternoon\r\nin February, 1841, he walked from the railroad station (then on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue) to the City Hall.  He was a tall, thin, careworn\r\nold gentleman, with a martial bearing, carrying his hat in his\r\nhand, and bowing his acknowledgments for the cheers with which he\r\nwas greeted by the citizens who lined the sidewalks.  On reaching\r\nthe City Hall, the President-elect was formally addressed by the\r\nMayor, Colonel W. W. Seaton, of the _National Intelligencer_, who\r\nsupplemented his panegyric by a complimentary editorial article in\r\nhis newspaper of the next morning.\r\n\r\nBefore coming East General Harrison visited Henry Clay, at Ashland,\r\nand tendered him the position of Secretary of State, which Mr. Clay\r\npromptly declined, saying that he had fully determined not to hold\r\noffice under the new Administration, although he intended cordially\r\nto support it.  General Harrison thanked Mr. Clay for his frankness,\r\nexpressing deep regret that he could not accept the portfolio of\r\nthe Department of State.  He further said that if Mr. Clay had\r\naccepted this position it was his intention to offer the portfolio\r\nof the Treasury Department to Mr. Webster; but since Mr. Clay had\r\ndeclined a seat in the Cabinet, he should not offer one to Mr.\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay objected to this conclusion, and remarked that while Mr.\r\nWebster was not peculiarly fitted for the control of the national\r\nfinances, he was eminently qualified for the management of the\r\nforeign relations.  Besides, the appointment of Mr. Webster as\r\nSecretary of State would inspire confidence in the Administration\r\nabroad, which would be highly important, considering the existing\r\ncritical relations with Great Britain.  General Harrison accepted\r\nthe suggestion, and on his return to North Bend wrote to Mr. Webster,\r\noffering him the Department of State and asking his advice concerning\r\nthe other members of the Cabinet.  The \"solid men of Boston,\" who\r\nhad begun to entertain grave apprehensions of hostilities with\r\nGreat Britain, urged Mr. Webster to accept, and pledged themselves\r\nto contribute liberally to his support.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was it intimated that Mr. Webster was to be the Premier\r\nof the incoming Administration than the Calhoun wing of the Democratic\r\nparty denounced him as having countenanced the abolition of slavery,\r\nand when his letter resigning his seat in the Senate was read in\r\nthat body, Senator Cuthbert, of Georgia, attacked him.  The Georgian's\r\ndeclamation was delivered with clenched fist; he pounded his desk,\r\ngritted his teeth, and used profane language.  Messrs. Clay, Preston,\r\nand other Senators defended Mr. Webster from the attack of the\r\nirate Georgian, and his friends had printed at Washington a large\r\nedition of a speech which he had made a few months before on the\r\nportico of the Capitol at Richmond before a vast assemblage.\r\n\"Beneath the light of an October sun, I say,\" he then declared,\r\n\"there is no power, directly or indirectly, in Congress or the\r\nGeneral Government, to interfere in the slightest degree with the\r\ninstitutions of the South.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, to quiet the cry of \"Abolitionist,\" which had\r\nbeen raised against him as well as Mr. Webster, made a visit to\r\nRichmond prior to his inauguration, during which he availed himself\r\nof every possible occasion to assert his devotion to the rights,\r\nprivileges, and prejudices of the South concerning the existence\r\nof slavery.  On his return he took a daily ride on the picturesque\r\nbanks of Rock Creek, rehearsing portions of his inaugural address.\r\n\r\nThe portfolio of the Treasury Department was given to Thomas Ewing,\r\nof Ohio (familiarly known from his early avocation as \"the Salt\r\nBoiler of the Kanawha\") who was physically and intellectually a\r\ngreat man.  He was of medium height, very portly, his ruddy complexion\r\nsetting off his bright, laughing eyes to the best advantage.  On\r\n\"the stump\" he had but few equals, as in simple language and without\r\napparent oratorical effort he breathed his own spirit into vast\r\naudiences, and swayed them with resistless power.  He resided in\r\na house built by Count de Menou, one of the French Legations, and\r\nhis daughter Ellen, now the wife of General Sherman, attended school\r\nat the academy attached to the Convent of the Sisters of the\r\nVisitation, in Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThe coming Secretary of War was John Bell, of Tennessee, a courtly\r\nJackson Democrat in years past, who had preferred to support Hugh\r\nL. White rather than Martin Van Buren, and had thus drifted into\r\nthe Whig ranks.  He had served as a Representative in Congress\r\nsince 1827, officiating during one term as Speaker, and he was\r\npersonally very popular.\r\n\r\nFor Secretary of the Navy George E. Badger, of North Carolina, was\r\nselected.  He had been graduated from Yale College, but had never\r\nheld other than local offices.  His sailor-like figure and facetious\r\nphysiognomy were very appropriate for the position, and he soon\r\nbecame a decided favorite at the Washington \"messes,\" where he was\r\nalways ready to contribute freely from his fund of anecdotes.\r\n\r\nFrancis Granger, of New York, who was to be Postmaster-General,\r\nwas also a graduate of Yale College.  He had been a member of the\r\nNew York State Legislature and of Congress, and the unsuccessful\r\nWhig candidate for Vice-President in 1836.  He was a genial, rosy-\r\nfaced gentleman, whose \"silver gray\" hair afterward gave its name\r\nto the party in New York which recognized him as its leader.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General was J. J. Crittenden, a Kentuckian, whose\r\nintellectual vigor, integrity of character, and legal ability had\r\nsecured for him a nomination to the bench of the Supreme Court by\r\nPresident Adams, which, however, the Democratic Senate failed to\r\nconfirm.  Kept in the shade by Henry Clay, he became somewhat\r\ncrabbed, but his was one of the noblest intellects of his generation.\r\nHis persuasive eloquence, his sound judgment, his knowledge of the\r\nlaw, his lucid manner of stating facts, and his complete grasp of\r\nevery case which he examined had made him a power in the Senate\r\nand in the Supreme Court, as he was destined to be in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural message had been prepared by General Harrison in\r\nOhio, and he brought it with him to Washington, written in his\r\nlarge hand on one side of sheets of foolscap paper.  When it was\r\nsubmitted to Mr. Webster, he respectfully suggested the propriety\r\nof abridging it, and of striking from it some of the many classical\r\nallusions and quotations with which it abounded.  He found, however,\r\nthat General Harrison was not disposed to receive advice, and that\r\nhe was reluctant to part with any evidence of his classic scholarship.\r\nColonel Seaton used to relate with great gusto how Mr. Webster once\r\ncame late to a dinner party at his house, and said, as he entered\r\nthe dining-room, when the soup was being served:  \"Excuse my\r\ntardiness, but I have been able to dispose of two Roman Emperors\r\nand a pro-Consul, which should be a sufficient excuse.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was inaugurated on Thursday, March 4th, 1841.\r\nThe city had filled up during the preceding night, and the roar of\r\nthe morning salutes was echoed by the bands of the military as they\r\nmarched to take their designated places.  The sun was obscured,\r\nbut the weather was mild, and the streets were perfectly dry.  At\r\nten o'clock a procession was formed, which escorted the President-\r\nelect from his temporary residence, by way of Pennsylvania Avenue,\r\nto the Capitol.  No regular troops were on parade, but the uniformed\r\nmilitia of the District of Columbia, reinforced by others from\r\nPhiladelphia and Baltimore, performed escort duty in a very creditable\r\nmanner.  A carriage presented by the Whigs of Baltimore, and drawn\r\nby four horses, had been provided for the President-elect, but he\r\npreferred to ride on horseback, as the Roman Emperors were wont to\r\npass along the Appian Way.  The old hero made a fine appearance,\r\nmounted, as he was, on a spirited white charger.  At his right,\r\nslightly in the rear, rode Major Hurst, who had been his aid-de-\r\ncamp at the Battle of the Thames; at his left, in a similar position,\r\nrode Colonel Todd, another aid-de-camp at the same battle.  An\r\nescort of assistant marshals, finely mounted, followed.  Although\r\nthe weather was chilly, the General refused to wear an overcoat,\r\nand he rode with his hat in his hand, gracefully bowing acknowledgments\r\nof cheers from the multitudes on the sidewalks, and of the waving\r\nof white handkerchiefs by ladies at the windows on either side.\r\n\r\nBehind the President-elect came Tippecanoe Clubs and other political\r\nassociations, with music, banners, and badges.  The Club from Prince\r\nGeorge County, Maryland, had in its ranks a large platform on\r\nwheels, drawn by six white horses, on which was a power-loom from\r\nthe Laurel Factory, with operatives at work.  Several of the clubs\r\ndrew large log cabins on wheels, decked with suitable inscriptions,\r\ncider-barrels, 'coonskins, and other frontier articles.  A feature\r\nof the procession was the students of the Jesuits' College at\r\nGeorgetown, who appeared in uniform, headed by their faculty, and\r\ncarrying a beautiful banner.\r\n\r\nAn immense crowd had gathered at the Capitol, and at ten o'clock\r\nladies who had tickets were admitted into the gallery of the Senate\r\nChamber, and were provided with comfortable seats.  The east door\r\nleading to the Senate gallery was soon opened, when at least five\r\nthousand persons rushed to that point.  Less than a thousand were\r\nenabled to reach the seats provided.  Soon after the galleries were\r\nfilled, the foreign Ambassadors, wearing the court dresses and\r\ninsignia, were introduced on the floor.  The members of the Senate\r\ntook their seats, after which the Senate was called to order by\r\nthe Clerk, and Senator King was chosen President _pro tem_.  The\r\nnewly elected Senators were sworn, Vice-President Tyler, of Virginia,\r\nentered arm-in-arm with ex-Vice-President Johnson, and after the\r\noath of office had been administered to him he took the chair and\r\ncalled the Senate to order.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect was then ushered into the Senate Chamber by\r\nthe Committee, of which Mr. Preston was chairman.  The Judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, wearing their black silk robes, had taken their\r\nseats in front, below the Speaker's chair.  The President-elect\r\nshook hands cordially with a number of the Senators and Judges,\r\nand appeared much younger than many who were his juniors in years.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve o'clock the signal was given, and the officers\r\nin the Senate Chamber formed in procession and proceeded to the\r\neastern front of the Capitol, where there was a platform some\r\nfifteen feet high and large enough to accommodate an immense crowd.\r\nThe President-elect took his seat in front, Chief Justice Taney\r\nand his associates by his side, the Senators and Ambassadors on\r\nthe left, and the ladies at the sides.  The large area below was\r\nfilled with an immense multitude of probably not less than from\r\nforty to fifty thousand persons.  General Harrison, as \"the observed\r\nof all observers,\" was greeted with prolonged cheers when he rose\r\nto deliver his address.  When the uproar had subsided he advanced\r\nto the front of the platform, and there was a profound stillness\r\nas he read, in a loud and clear voice, his inaugural address.  He\r\nstood bare-headed, without overcoat or gloves, facing the cold\r\nnortheast wind, while those seated on the platform around him,\r\nalthough warmly wrapped, suffered from the piercing blasts.  All\r\nwere astonished at the power and compass of his voice.  He spoke\r\nuntil two P. M.--one and a half hours--with a clearness that was\r\ntruly surprising.  So distinctly were his words heard that he was\r\ncheered at the closing of every sentiment, particularly where he\r\nsaid that he would carry out the pledge that he had made, that\r\nunder no circumstances would he run for another term.  Just before\r\nthe close of the inaugural he turned to Chief Justice Taney, who\r\nheld the Bible, and in a clear and distinct voice repeated the oath\r\nrequired.  It was a singular fact that when the President took the\r\noath this multitude of spectators before him spontaneously uncovered\r\ntheir heads, while the pealing cannon announced to the country that\r\nit had a new Chief Magistrate.  As soon as the ceremony was over\r\nthe immense concourse turned their faces from the Capitol, and\r\nfiled down the various walks to Pennsylvania Avenue.  The procession\r\nformed anew and marched to the White House, cheered as it passed\r\nby the waiting crowds.\r\n\r\nEntering the White House, President Harrison took his station in\r\nthe reception-room, and the multitude entered the front portal,\r\npassed through the vestibule into the reception-room, where they\r\nhad an opportunity to shake hands with the President, then passed\r\ndown the rear steps and out through the garden.  At night there\r\nwere three inauguration balls, the prices of admission suiting\r\ndifferent pockets.  At one, where the tickets were ten dollars for\r\ngentlemen, the ladies being invited guests, there was a representation\r\nfrom almost every State in the Union.  President Harrison,\r\nnotwithstanding the fatigues of the day, remained over an hour,\r\nand was attended by several members of his Cabinet.  Mr. Webster\r\nwas in excellent spirits, and chatted familiarly with Mr. Clay at\r\nthe punch-bowl, where libations were drunk to the success of the\r\nnew Administration.\r\n\r\nThus the new Administration was inaugurated.  The Democrats\r\nsurrendered the power which they had so despotically wielded for\r\ntwelve years, and their opponents, consolidated under the Whig\r\nbanner, took the reins of government.  Passing over Webster and\r\nClay, their recognized leaders, they had elected Harrison as a more\r\navailable candidate, he having been a gallant soldier and having\r\nbut few enemies.  For Vice-President they had elected John Tyler,\r\nfor the sole reason that his Democratic affiliations would secure\r\nthe electoral vote of Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Wm H Harrison\r\nWILLIAM HENRY HARRISON was born in Charles County, Virginia, February\r\n9th, 1773; was Delegate in Congress from the Northwest Territory,\r\nDecember 2d, 1790, to March, 1800; was Governor of Indiana, 1801-\r\n1813; was a Representative in Congress from Ohio, December 2d,\r\n1816, to March 3d, 1819; was United States Senator, December 5th,\r\n1825, to May 20th, 1828; was Minister to Colombia, May 24th, 1828,\r\nto September 26th, 1829; became President of the United States,\r\nMarch 4th, 1841, and died in Washington City, April 4th, 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nHARRISON'S ONE MONTH OF POWER.\r\n\r\nGovernment officials at Washington, nearly all of whom had received\r\ntheir positions as rewards for political services, and many of whom\r\nhad displaced worthy men whose only fault was that they belonged to\r\na different party, were somewhat encouraged by the declarations of\r\nPresident Harrison touching the position of office-holders.  It\r\nwas known from a speech of his at Baltimore, prior to his inauguration,\r\nthat he intended to protect the right of individual opinion from\r\nofficial interference, and in a few days after he became President\r\nhis celebrated civil-service circular was issued by Daniel Webster,\r\nas Secretary of State.  It was addressed to the heads of the\r\nExecutive Departments, and it commenced thus:\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--The President is of the opinion that it is a great abuse to\r\nbring the patronage of the General Government into conflict with\r\nthe freedom of elections; and that this abuse ought to be corrected\r\nwherever it may have been permitted to exist, and to be prevented\r\nfor the future.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been fortunate for the country if these views of\r\nPresident Harrison, so clearly stated by Daniel Webster in this\r\ncircular, could have been honestly carried out; but the horde of\r\nhungry politicians that had congregated at Washington, with racoon-\r\ntails in their hats and packages of recommendations in their pockets,\r\nclamored for the wholesale action of the political guillotine, that\r\nthey might fill the vacancies thereby created.  Whigs and Federalists,\r\nNational Republicans and strict constructionists, bank and anti-\r\nbank men had coalesced under the motto of \"Union of the Whigs for\r\nthe Whigs for the sake of the Union,\" but they had really united\r\n\"for the sake of office.\"  The Administration found itself forced\r\nto make removals that places might be found for this hungry horde,\r\nand to disregard its high position on civil service.  Virginia was\r\nespecially clamorous for places, and Vice-President Tyler became\r\nthe champion of hundreds who belonged to the first families, but\r\nwho were impecunious.\r\n\r\nDirect conflict soon arose between the President and his Cabinet,\r\nhe asserting his right to make appointments and removals, while\r\nthey took the ground that it was simply his duty to take such action\r\nas they chose to dictate.  The Cabinet were sustained by the opinion\r\nof Attorney-General John C. Crittenden, and they also under his\r\nadvice claimed the right to review the President's nominations\r\nbefore they were sent to the Senate.  To the President, who had as\r\nGovernor and as General been in the habit of exercising autocratic\r\ncommand, these attempts to hamper his action were very annoying,\r\nand at times he \"kicked over the traces.\"\r\n\r\nOne day, after a rather stormy Cabinet meeting, Mr. Webster asked\r\nthe President to appoint one of his political supporters, General\r\nJames Wilson, of New Hampshire, Governor of the Territory of Iowa.\r\nPresident Harrison replied that it would give him pleasure to do\r\nso had he not promised the place to Colonel John Chambers, of\r\nKentucky, his former aid-de-camp, who had been acting as his private\r\nsecretary.  The next day Colonel Chambers had occasion to visit\r\nthe Department of State, and Mr. Webster asked him if the President\r\nhad offered to appoint him Governor of Iowa.  \"Yes, sir,\" was the\r\nreply.  \"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Webster with sour sternness, a cloud\r\ngathering on his massive brow, while his unfathomable eyes glowed\r\nwith anger, \"you must not take that position, for I have promised\r\nit to my friend, General Wilson.\"  Colonel Chambers, who had been\r\na member of Congress, and was older than Mr. Webster, was not\r\nintimidated, but replied, \"Mr. Webster, I shall accept the place,\r\nand I tell you, sir, not to undertake to dragoon me!\"  He then left\r\nthe room, and not long afterward Mr. Webster received from the\r\nPresident a peremptory order to commission John Chambers, of\r\nKentucky, as Governor of the Territory of Iowa, which was complied\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay undertook to insist upon some removals, that personal\r\nfriends of his might be appointed to the offices thus vacated, and\r\nhe used such dictatorial language that after he had left the White\r\nHouse President Harrison wrote him a formal note, requesting that\r\nhe would make any further suggestions he might desire to submit in\r\nwriting.  Mr. Clay was very much annoyed, and Mr. King, of Alabama,\r\nmaking some remarks in the Senate soon afterward which might be\r\nconstrued as personally offensive, the great Commoner opened his\r\nbatteries upon him, saying in conclusion that the assertions of\r\nthe Senator from Alabama were \"false, untrue, and cowardly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. King immediately rose and left the Senate Chamber.  Mr. Levin,\r\nof Missouri, was called out, and soon returned, bringing a note,\r\nwhich he handed to Mr. Clay, who read it, and then handed it to\r\nMr. Archer.  Messrs. Levin and Archer immediately engaged in an\r\nearnest conversation, and it was soon known that a challenge had\r\npassed, and they as seconds were endeavoring amicably to arrange\r\nthe affair.  After four days of negotiation, Mr. Preston, of South\r\nCarolina, and other Senators, acting as mediators, the affair was\r\nhonorably adjusted.  Mr. King withdrew his challenge, Mr. Clay\r\ndeclared every epithet derogatory to the honor of the Senator from\r\nAlabama to be withdrawn, and Mr. Preston expressed his satisfaction\r\nat the happy termination of the misunderstanding between the\r\nSenators.  While Mr. Preston was speaking Mr. Clay rose, walked to\r\nthe opposite side of the Senate Chamber, and stopping in front of\r\nthe desk of the Senator from Alabama, said, in a pleasant tone,\r\n\"King, give us a pinch of your snuff?\"  Mr. King, springing to his\r\nfeet, held out his hand, which was grasped by Mr. Clay and cordially\r\nshaken, the Senators and spectators applauding the pacific\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nThe leading Washington correspondent at that time was Dr. Francis\r\nBacon, brother of the Rev. Dr. Leonard Bacon, of New Haven,\r\nConnecticut.  He wrote for the New York _American_, then edited by\r\nCharles King, signing his articles R. M. T. H.--Regular Member\r\nThird House.  Dr. Bacon wielded a powerful pen, and when he chose\r\nso to do could condense a column of denunciation, satire, and\r\nsarcasm in to a single paragraph.  He was a fine scholar, fearless\r\ncensor, and terse writer, giving his many readers a clear idea of\r\nwhat was transpiring at the Federal metropolis.\r\n\r\nA new-comer among the correspondents during the Harrison Administration\r\nwas Mr. Nathan Sargent, whose correspondence to the Philadelphia\r\n_United States Gazette_, over the signature of \"Oliver Oldschool,\"\r\nsoon became noted.  His carefully written letters gave a continuous\r\nnarrative of important events as they occurred, and he was one who\r\naided in making the Whig party, like the Federal party, which had\r\npreceded it, eminently respectable.\r\n\r\nWashington correspondents, up to this time, had been the mediums\r\nthrough which a large portion of the citizens of the United States\r\nobtained their information concerning national affairs.  The only\r\nreports of the debates in Congress appeared in the Washington\r\nnewspapers often several weeks after their delivery.  James Gordon\r\nBennett, who had then become proprietor of the New York _Herald_,\r\nafter publishing President Harrison's call for an extra session of\r\nCongress in advance of his contemporaries, determined to have the\r\nproceedings and debates reported for and promptly published in his\r\nown columns.  To superintend the reporting, he engaged Robert\r\nSutton, who organized a corps of phonographers, which was the\r\nnucleus of the present able body of official reporters of the\r\ndebates.  Sutton was a short, stout, pragmatical Englishman, whose\r\ndesire to obtain extra allowances prompted him to revise, correct,\r\nand polish up reports which should have been verbatim, and thus to\r\ntake the initiative in depriving official reports of debates of a\r\nlarge share of their value.  Since then, Senators and Representatives\r\naddress their constituents through the reports, instead of debating\r\nquestions among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic representative of Great Britain, during the greater\r\npart of the Jackson Administration, was the Right Honorable Charles\r\nRichard Vaughan, who was a great favorite among Congressmen and\r\ncitizens at Washington, many of whom were his guests at the Decatur\r\nMansion, then the British Legation.  He was a well-educated and\r\nwell-informed gentleman, with the courteous manners of the old\r\nschool.  When recalled after ten years' service at Washington, he\r\nwas a jovial bachelor of fifty, fond of old Madeira wine and a\r\nquiet rubber of whist.\r\n\r\nA good story is told of General Roger Weightman, when Mayor of the\r\ncity, who sent by mistake an invitation to Sir Charles Vaughan to\r\nattend a Fourth-of-July dinner, at which speeches were invariably\r\nmade abusive of the British and their Vandalism in the recent war.\r\nSir Charles, who was a finished diplomat, might have construed the\r\ninvitation into an insult, but he wrote a very polite response,\r\nsaying that he thought he should be \"indisposed\" on the Fourth of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nRussia was then represented by the Baron de Krudener, who resided\r\nin a large house built by Thomas Swann, a wealthy Baltimorean.\r\nAmicable relations with \"our ancient ally,\" France, had been\r\ninterrupted by the brusque demand of General Jackson for the payment\r\nof the indemnity.  Monsieur Serruvier was recalled, leaving the\r\nLegation in charge of Alphonso Pageot, the Secretary.  He also was\r\nrecalled, but after the Jackson Administration was sent back as\r\nCharge.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the session of the Twenty-sixth Congress,\r\nwhich terminated on the day of the inauguration of General Harrison,\r\nwould have been followed by a duel between Mr. Edward Stanley, of\r\nNorth Carolina, and Mr. Francis W. Pickens, of South Carolina.\r\nMr. Stanley had been criticised in debate by Mr. Pickens, and he\r\nretorted mercilessly.  \"The gentleman,\" said he, \"compares my speech\r\nto the attempt of a 'savage shooting at the sun.'  It may be so,\r\nsir.  But the Committee will remember that in the remarks I made\r\nI did not address myself to the gentleman who has so unnecessarily\r\ninterposed in this debate.  And why did I not, sir?  Not because\r\nI thought I should be as powerless as he describes me, but because\r\nI had seen him so often so unmercifully kicked and cuffed and\r\nknocked about, so often run over on this floor, that I thought he\r\nwas beneath my notice, and utterly insignificant.  Sir, the gentleman\r\nsays he is reminded by my speech of the 'nursery rhyme,'\r\n\r\n  'Who shot Cock Robin?\r\n  \"I,\" said the Sparrow,\r\n  \"With my bow and arrow,\r\n   I shot Cock Robin.\"'\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I am willing to be the sparrow for this cock robin, this\r\nchivalrous gentleman; and let me tell the gentleman, if he will\r\nnot deem me vain, I feel fully able, with my bow and arrow, to run\r\nthrough a 'cowpen full' of such cock robins as he is.  In conclusion,\r\nI have only to say, sir, to the gentleman from South Carolina, that\r\nthough my arm may be 'pigmy,' though I may be but a sparrow in the\r\nestimation of one 'born insensible to fear,' I am able, sir,\r\nanywhere, as a sparrow from North Carolina, to put down a dozen\r\nsuch cock robins as he is.  'Come one, come all,' ye South Carolina\r\ncock robins, if you dare; I am ready for you.\"  Mr. Pickens wrote\r\na challenge, but friends interposed, and the difficulty was honorably\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Webster became Secretary of State, under President Harrison,\r\nhis friends in Boston and New York raised a purse to enable him to\r\npurchase the Swann House, facing Lafayette Square.  Mr. Webster\r\npreferred, however, to purchase land at Marshfield, and after he\r\nhad occupied the house during the negotiations of the Ashburton\r\nTreaty, the property passed into the hands of Mr. W. W. Corcoran,\r\nwho has since resided there.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was his own purveyor, and was a regular attendant at\r\nthe Marsh Market on market mornings.  He almost invariably wore a\r\nlarge, broad-brimmed, soft felt hat, with his favorite blue coat\r\nand bright buttons, a buff cassimere waistcoat, and black trousers.\r\nGoing from stall to stall, followed by a servant bearing a large\r\nbasket in which purchases were carried home, he would joke with\r\nthe butchers, fish-mongers, and green-grocers with a grave drollery\r\nof which his biographers, in their anxiety to deify him, have made\r\nno mention.  He always liked to have a friend of two at his dinner-\r\ntable, and in inviting them, _sans ceremonie_, he would say, in\r\nhis deep, cheery voice, \"Come and dine with me to-morrow.  I\r\npurchased a noble saddle of Valley of Virginia mutton in market\r\nlast week, and I think you will enjoy it.\"  Or, \"I received some\r\nfine cod-fish from Boston to-day, sir; will you dine with me at\r\nfive o'clock and taste them?\"  Or, \"I found a famous possum in\r\nmarket this morning, sir, and left orders with Monica, my cook, to\r\nhave it baked in the real old Virginia style, with stuffing of\r\nchestnuts and surrounded by baked sweet potatoes.  It will be a\r\ndish fit for the gods.  Come and taste it.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, who was an early riser, used to go to market,\r\nand he invariably refused to wear an overcoat, although the spring\r\nwas cold and stormy.  One morning, having gone to the market thus\r\nthinly attired, he was overtaken by a slight shower and got wet,\r\nbut refused to change his clothes.  The following day he felt\r\nsymptoms of indisposition, which were followed by pneumonia.  At\r\nhis Ohio home he had lived plainly and enjoyed sleep, but at\r\nWashington he had, while rising early, rarely retired before one\r\no'clock in the morning, and his physical powers, enfeebled by age,\r\nhad been overtaxed.  At the same time, the President's mental powers\r\nhad undergone a severe strain, as was evident when he became somewhat\r\ndelirious.  Sometimes he would say, \"My dear madam, I did not direct\r\nthat your husband should be turned out.  I did not know it.  I\r\ntried to prevent it.\"  On other occasions he would say, in broken\r\nsentences, \"It is wrong--I won't consent--'tis unjust!\"  \"These\r\napplications--will they never cease!\"  The last time that he spoke\r\nwas about three hours before his death, when his physicians and\r\nattendants were standing over him.  Clearing his throat, as if\r\ndesiring to speak audibly, and as though he fancied himself addressing\r\nhis successor, or some official associate in the Government, he\r\nsaid:  \"Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the\r\nGovernment.  I wish them carried out.  I ask nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"One little month\" after President Harrison's inauguration multitudes\r\nagain assembled to attend his funeral.  Minute-guns were fired\r\nduring the day, flags were displayed at half staff, and Washington\r\nwas crowded with strangers at an early hour.  The buildings of\r\neither side of Pennsylvania Avenue, with scarcely an exception,\r\nand many houses on the contiguous streets, were hung with festoons\r\nand streamers of black.  Almost every private dwelling had crape\r\nupon its door, and many of the very humblest abodes displayed some\r\nspontaneous signal of the general sorrow.  The stores and places\r\nof business, even such as were too frequently seen open on the\r\nSabbath, were all closed.\r\n\r\nFuneral services were performed in the Executive Mansion, which,\r\nfor the first time, was shrouded in mourning.  The coffin rested\r\non a temporary catafalque in the centre of the East Room.  It was\r\ncovered with black velvet, trimmed with gold lace, and over it was\r\nthrown a velvet pall with a deep golden fringe.  On this lay the\r\nsword of Justice and the sword of State, surmounted by the scroll\r\nof the Constitution, bound together by a funeral wreath, formed of\r\nthe yew and the cypress.  Around the coffin stood in a circle the\r\nnew President, John Tyler, the venerable ex-President, John Quincy\r\nAdams, Secretary Webster, and the other members of the Cabinet.\r\nThe next circle contained the Diplomatic Corps, in their richly\r\ndecorated court-suits, with a number of members of both houses of\r\nCongress, and the relatives of the deceased President.  Beyond this\r\ncircle a vast assemblage of ladies and gentlemen filled up the\r\nroom.  Silence, deep and undisturbed, even by a whisper, prevailed.\r\nWhen, at the appointed hour, the officiating clergyman said, \"I am\r\nthe resurrection and the life,\" the entire audience rose, and joined\r\nin the burial service of the Episcopalian Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the services the coffin was carried to a large funeral car\r\ndrawn by six white horses, each having at its head a black groom\r\ndressed in white, with white turban and sash.  Outside of the grooms\r\nwalked the pall-bearers, dressed in black, with black scarves.\r\nThe contrast made by this slowly moving body of white and black,\r\nso opposite to the strong colors of the military around it, struck\r\nthe eye even from the greatest distance.\r\n\r\nThe funeral procession, with its military escort, was two miles in\r\nlength, and eclipsed the inauguration pageant which had so recently\r\npreceded it.  The remains were escorted to the Congressional Burying-\r\nGround, where they were temporarily deposited in the receiving-\r\nvault, to be taken subsequently to the banks of the Ohio, and there\r\nplaced in an unmarked and neglected grave.  The troops present all\r\nfired their volleys in such a ludicrously straggling manner as to\r\nrecall the dying request of Robert Burns that the awkward squad\r\nmight not fire over his grave.  Then the drums and fifes struck up\r\nmerry strains, the military marched away, and only the scene of\r\nthe public bereavement remained.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  T. Ewing\r\nTHOMAS EWING was born near West Liberty, Virginia, December 28th,\r\n1779; was United States Senator from Ohio, December 5th, 1831, to\r\nMarch 3d, 1837; was Secretary of the Treasury under President\r\nHarrison, March 5th, 1841, to September 13th, 1841; was Secretary\r\nof the Interior under President Taylor, March 7th, 1849, to July\r\n25th, 1850; was again Senator from Ohio, July 27th, 1850, to March\r\n3d, 1851, and died at Lancaster, Ohio, October 26th, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE KING IS DEAD--LONG LIVE THE KING.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler, having found that his position as Vice-President gave\r\nhim no voice in the distribution of patronage, had retired in\r\ndisgust to his estate in Prince William County, Virginia, when Mr.\r\nFletcher Webster brought him a notification, from the Secretary of\r\nState, to hasten to Washington to assume the duties of the President.\r\nMr. Webster reached Richmond on Sunday--the day following General\r\nHarrison's death--chartered a steamboat, and arrived at Mr. Tyler's\r\nresidence on Monday at daybreak.  Soon afterward, Mr. Tyler,\r\naccompanied by his two sons, left with Mr. Webster, and arrived at\r\nWashington early Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet had arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Tyler should be\r\nofficially styled, \"Vice-President of the United States, acting\r\nPresident,\" but he very promptly determined that he would enjoy\r\nall of the dignities and honors of the office which he had inherited\r\nunder the Constitution.  Chief Justice Taney was then absent, so\r\nMr. Tyler summoned Chief Justice Cranch, of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe District of Columbia, to his parlor at Brown's Indian Queen\r\nHotel, and took the oath of office administered to previous\r\nPresidents.  The Cabinet officers were soon made to understand that\r\nhe was Chief Magistrate of the Republic, and the Whig magnates\r\nbegan to fear that their lease of power would soon terminate.  In\r\nconversation with Mr. Nathan Sargent, a prominent Whig correspondent,\r\nsoon after his arrival, Mr. Tyler significantly remarked:  \"If the\r\nDemocrats and myself ever come together, they must come to me; I\r\nshall never go to them.\"  This showed that he regarded his connection\r\nwith the Whigs as precarious.\r\n\r\nThe extra session of Congress, which had been convened by General\r\nHarrison before his death, was not acceptable to his successor,\r\nwho saw that its legislation would be inspired and controlled by\r\nHenry Clay.  When the two houses were organized, he sent them a\r\nbrief message, in which the national bank question was dexterously\r\nhandled, \"with the caution and ambiguity of a Talleyrand.\"  Mr.\r\nClay lost no time in presenting his programme for Congressional\r\naction; and in a few days its first feature, the repeal of the sub-\r\nTreasury Act, was enacted.  That night a thousand or more of the\r\njubilant Washington Whigs marched in procession from Capitol Hill\r\nto the White House, with torches, music, transparencies, and\r\nfireworks, escorting a catafalque on which was a coffin labeled,\r\n\"The sub-Treasury.\"  As the procession moved slowly along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, bonfires were kindled at the intersecting streets, many\r\nhouses were illuminated, and there was general rejoicing.  On the\r\narrival of the procession at the Executive Mansion, President Tyler\r\ncame out and made a few remarks, while Mr. Webster and the other\r\nmembers of the Cabinet bowed their thanks for the cheers given\r\nthem.  The hilarious crowd of mock-mourners then repaired to the\r\nhouse of Mrs. Brown, at the corner of Seventh and D Streets, where\r\nMr. Clay boarded, and received his grateful acknowledgments for\r\nthe demonstration.  The next measure on Mr. Clay's programme, the\r\nbill for the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public\r\nlands among the States, was also promptly enacted and as promptly\r\napproved by the President.  Next came the National Bankrupt Act,\r\nwhich was stoutly opposed by the Democrats, but it finally passed,\r\nand was approved by Mr. Tyler.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress enacted a bill creating a National Bank, however,\r\nand sent it to the President for his approval, he returned it with\r\nhis veto.  This created much discontent among the Whigs, while the\r\nDemocrats were so rejoiced that a considerable number of their\r\nCongressmen called at the Executive Mansion.  The President received\r\nthem cordially, and treated them to champagne, in which toasts were\r\ndrunk not very complimentary to the Whig party, or to its leader,\r\nMr. Clay.  The Kentucky Senator soon saw that it was of no use to\r\ntemporize with his vacillating chieftain, who evidently desired to\r\nbecome his own successor, so he determined to force the Administration\r\ninto a hostile attitude toward the Whigs, while he himself should\r\nstep to the front as their recognized leader.  Haughty and imperious,\r\nMr. Clay was nevertheless so fascinating in his manner when he\r\nchose to be that he held unlimited control over nearly every member\r\nof the party.  He remembered, too, that Tyler had been nominated\r\nfor Vice-President in pursuance of a bargain made by Clay's own\r\nfriends in the Legislature of Virginia, where they had joined the\r\nVan Buren members in electing Mr. Rives to the Senate.  This bargain\r\nMr. Clay had hoped would secure for him the support of the State\r\nof Virginia in the nominating convention, and although Harrison\r\nreceived the nomination for President, Clay's friends were none\r\nthe less responsible for the nomination of Tyler as Vice-President.\r\nHe was consequently very angry when he learned what had taken place\r\nat the White House, and he availed himself of the first opportunity\r\nto speak of the scene in the Senate, portraying the principal\r\npersonages present with adroit sarcasm.\r\n\r\nSome of his descriptions were life-like, especially that of Mr.\r\nCalhoun, \"tall, careworn, with fevered brow, haggard cheek, and\r\neye intensely gazing, looking as if he were dissecting the last\r\nand newest abstraction which sprung from some metaphysician's brain,\r\nand muttering to himself, in half uttered words, 'This is indeed\r\na crisis!'\"  The best word-portrait, however, was that of Senator\r\nBuchanan, whose manner and voice were humorously imitated while he\r\nwas described as presenting his Democratic associates to the\r\nPresident.  Mr. Buchanan pleasantly retorted, describing in turn\r\na caucus of disappointed Whig Congressmen, who discussed whether\r\nit would be best to make open war upon \"Captain Tyler,\" or to resort\r\nto strategem, and, in the elegant language of Mr. Botts, \"head him,\r\nor die.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission to Great Britain had been tendered by President Harrison\r\nto John Sargent, a distinguished Philadelphia lawyer, who had been\r\nthe candidate for Vice-President on the unsuccessful Whig ticket\r\nheaded by Henry Clay in 1836.  Mr. Sargent having declined, President\r\nHarrison appointed Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, who accepted\r\nand his name came before the Senate for confirmation.  Mr. Everett\r\nwas among the most conservative of New England politicians, but he\r\nhad once, in reply to inquiries from Abolitionists, expressed the\r\nopinion that Congress had power to abolish slavery in the District\r\nof Columbia.  When the nomination came before the Senate, it was\r\nopposed by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. King, of Alabama, and advocated by\r\nMr. Choate and Henry Clay.  Mr. King, who would have received the\r\nappointment had Mr. Everett's rejection created a vacancy, concluded\r\na bitter speech by saying that if Mr. Everett, holding views in\r\nopposition to the South, was confirmed, the Union would be dissolved!\r\nMr. Clay sprang to his feet, and pointing his long arm and index\r\nfinger at Mr. King, said:  \"And I tell you, Mr. President, that if\r\na gentleman so pre-eminently qualified for the position of Minister\r\nshould be rejected by the Senate, and for the reason given by the\r\nSenator from Alabama, this Union is dissolved already.\"\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Mr. Everett was confirmed by a vote of twenty-\r\nthree to nineteen.  Every Democrat who voted, and two Southern\r\nWhigs, voted against him, and several Northern Democrats dodged,\r\namong them Pierce, of New Hampshire, Williams, of Maine, and Wright,\r\nof New York.  The Southern Whigs who stood their ground for Mr.\r\nEverett were Clay, Morehead, Berrien, Clayton, Mangum, Merrick,\r\nGraham, and Rives.\r\n\r\nA second fiscal agent bill was prepared in accordance with the\r\nPresident's expressed views, and he said to Mr. A. H. H. Stuart,\r\nthen a Representative from Virginia, holding him by the hand:\r\n\"Stuart, if you can be instrumental in getting this bill through\r\nCongress, I shall esteem you as the best friend I have on earth.\"\r\nAn attempt was made in the Senate to amend it, which Mr. Choate,\r\nwho was regarded as the mouth-piece of Daniel Webster, opposed.\r\nMr. Clay endeavored to make him admit that some member of the\r\nAdministration had inspired him to assert that if the bill was\r\namended it would be vetoed, but Mr. Choate had examined too many\r\nwitnesses to be forced into any admission that he did not choose\r\nto make.  Persisting in his demand, Mr. Clay's manner and language\r\nbecame offensive.  \"Sir,\" said Mr. Choate, \"I insist on my right\r\nto explain what I did say in my own words.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want a direct answer,\" exclaimed Mr. Clay.  \"Mr. President,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Choate, \"the gentleman will have to take my answer as I\r\nchoose to give it to him.\"  Here the two Senators were called to\r\norder, and both of them were requested to take their seats.  The\r\nnext day Mr. Clay made an explanation, which was satisfactory to\r\nMr. Choate.\r\n\r\nThis second bank or fiscal agent bill was passed by Congress without\r\nthe change of a word or a letter, yet the President vetoed it.\r\nWhen the veto message was received in the Senate there were some\r\nhisses in the gallery, which brought Mr. Benton to his feet.\r\nExpressing his indignation, he asked that the \"ruffians\" be taken\r\ninto custody, and one of those who had hissed was arrested, but,\r\non penitently expressing his regret, he was discharged.  Tyler's\r\nCabinet first learned that he intended to veto this bank bill\r\nthrough the columns of a New York paper, and such was their\r\nindignation that all, with the exception of Mr. Webster, resigned.\r\nMr. Ewing, who had been appointed Secretary of the Treasury by\r\nPresident Harrison, and who had been continued in office by Mr.\r\nTyler, published his letter of resignation, which gave all the\r\nfacts in the case.  The Whig Senators and Representatives immediately\r\nmet in caucus and adopted an address to the people.  It was written\r\nby Mr. John P. Kennedy, of Maryland, and it set forth in temperate\r\nlanguage the differences between them and the President, his\r\nequivocations and tergiversations, and in conclusion they repudiated\r\nthe Administration.\r\n\r\nCaleb Cushing, of Newburyport, Massachusetts, then serving his\r\nfourth term in the House, espoused the cause of President Tyler,\r\nand boldly opposed the intolerant action of his Whig associates.\r\nYears afterward Franklin Pierce told his most intimate friend,\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne, that Caleb Cushing had such mental variety\r\nand activity that he could not, if left to himself, keep hold of\r\none view of things, but needed the influence of a more stable\r\njudgment to keep him from divergency.  His fickleness was intellectual,\r\nnot moral.  Mr. Cushing was at that time forty-one years of age,\r\nof medium height, with intellectual features, quick-glancing dark\r\neyes, and an unmusical voice.  He spoke with ease and fluency, but\r\nhis speeches read better than they sounded.  His knowledge was vast\r\nand various, and his style, tempered by foreign travel, was classical.\r\nHe had mastered history, politics, law, jurisprudence, moral science,\r\nand almost every other branch of knowledge, which enabled him to\r\ndisplay an erudition as marvelous in amount as it was varied in\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Representatives, who had regarded Mr. Cushing with\r\nsome apprehension as a possible leader of the coming struggle for\r\nthe abolition of slavery, were well pleased when they saw him\r\nbreaking away from his Northern friends.  When an attempt was made\r\nto depose John Quincy Adams from the Chairmanship of the House\r\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, because he had stood up manfully for\r\nthe right of petition, the irate ex-President asserted in the House\r\nthat the position had been offered to Mr. Cushing, who was also a\r\nmember.  This Mr. Cushing denied, but Mr. Adams, his bald head\r\nturning scarlet, exclaimed:  \"I had the information from the\r\ngentleman himself.\"\r\n\r\nIn this debate, Mr. Adams went to some length into the history of\r\nhis past life, his intercourse and friendship with Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe, during their successive Presidential\r\nterms.  He spoke of their confidence in himself, as manifested by\r\nthe various important offices conferred upon him, alluding to\r\nimportant historical facts in this connection.  He knew that they\r\nall abhorred slavery, and he could prove it, if it were desired,\r\nfrom the testimony of Jefferson, Madison, and Washington themselves.\r\nThere was not an Abolitionist of the wildest character, the ex-\r\nPresident affirmed, but might find in the writings of Jefferson,\r\nat the time of the Declaration of Independence, and during his\r\nwhole life, down to its very last year, a justification for everything\r\ntheir party says on the subject of slavery, and a description of\r\nthe horrors of slavery greater then they had power to express.\r\n\r\nHenry A. Wise had been Mr. Clay's instrument in securing the\r\nnomination of Mr. Tyler as Vice-President, and was the most\r\ninfluential adviser at the White House.  He was then in the prime\r\nof his early manhood, tall, spare, and upright, with large,\r\nlustreless, gray-blue eyes, high cheek bones, a large mouth, a\r\ncomplexion saffron-hued, from his inordinate use of tobacco, and\r\ncoarse, long hair, brushed back from his low forehead.  He was\r\nbrilliant in conversation, and when he addressed an audience he\r\nwas the incarnation of effective eloquence.  No one has ever poured\r\nforth in the Capitol of the United States such torrents of words,\r\nsuch erratic flights of fancy, such blasting insinuations, such\r\nsolemn prayers, such blasphemous imprecations.  Like Jeremiah of\r\nold, he felt the dark shadow of coming events; and he regarded the\r\nYankees as the inevitable foes of the old Commonwealth of Virginia.\r\nHe had hoped that the caucus of Whig Representatives, at the\r\ncommencement of the session, would have nominated him for Speaker.\r\nBut John White, of Kentucky, had received the nomination, Mr. Clay\r\nhaving urged his friends to vote for him, and Mr. Wise, goaded on\r\nby disappointed ambition, sought revenge by endeavoring to destroy\r\nthe Whig party.  He hoped to build on its ruins a new political\r\norganization composed of Whigs and of such Democrats as might be\r\ninduced to enlist under the Tyler banner by a lavish distribution\r\nof the \"loaves and fishes.\"  President Tyler's vanity made it easy\r\nto secure him as a figure-head, and it was an easy task to array\r\nhim in direct opposition to the Clay Whigs, when John M. Botts\r\nwrote an insulting letter, in which he recommended his political\r\nassociates to \"head Captain Tyler, or die.\"\r\n\r\nAs the close of the extra session approached, the breach between\r\nPresident Tyler and the Whig party was widened, and those who had\r\nelected him saw their hopes blasted, and the labors of the campaign\r\nlost, by his ambitious perfidy.  Nearly all of his nominations for\r\noffice were promptly rejected, and those who for place had espoused\r\nhis cause found themselves disappointed.  A few days before the\r\nfinal adjournment, it was announced that Senator Bagby, of Alabama,\r\nwould the next afternoon expose the shortcomings of the Whig party.\r\nHe was a type of the old-school Virginia lawyers, who had removed\r\nto the Gulf States, and there acquired political position and\r\nfortune.  He was a large man, with a bald head, a strong voice,\r\nand a watch-seal dangling from his waistband.\r\n\r\nThe \"Corporal's Guard\" who sustained Mr. Tyler were all on hand\r\nand prominently seated to hear him abuse the Whigs, and they\r\nevidently had great expectations that he might eulogize the President.\r\nUpshur, Cushing, Wise, Gilmer, with the President's sons, Robert\r\nand John, were on the floor of the Senate, and they were evidently\r\ndelighted as the eloquent Alabamian handled the Whig party without\r\ngloves.  He undertook to show that they were for and against a\r\nNational Bank, in favor of and opposed to a tariff, pro-slavery\r\nand anti-slavery, according to their location, but all united by\r\na desire to secure the Federal offices.\r\n\r\nProceeding in a strain of fervid eloquence, he all at once turned\r\nto Senator Smith, of Indiana, who was sitting in front of him, and\r\nasked, in stentorian tones:  \"Why don't you Whigs keep your promises\r\nto the American people?  I pause for an answer!\"  Mr. Smith promptly\r\nreplied:  \"Because _your_ President won't let us.\"  Mr. Bagby stood\r\nstill for a moment and then contemptuously exclaimed:  \"_Our_\r\nPresident!  OUR President!  Do you think that we would go to the\r\nmost corrupt party that was ever formed in the United States, and\r\nthen take for our President the meanest renegade that ever left\r\nthe party?\"  He then went on to castigate Mr. Tyler, while the\r\n\"Corporal's Guard,\" sadly disappointed, one by one, \"silently stole\r\naway,\" and had no more faith in Mr. Bagby.\r\n\r\nJunius Brutus Booth still continued to be the leading star at the\r\nWashington Theatre, and President Tyler used often to enjoy his\r\nmarvelous renderings, especially his \"Sir Giles Overreach,\" \"King\r\nLear,\" \"Shylock,\" \"Othello,\" and \"Richard the Third.\"  Booth, at\r\nthis time, was more than ever a slave to intoxicating drink, so\r\nmuch so that he would often disappoint his audiences, sometimes\r\nwholly failing to appear, yet his popularity remained unabated.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Franklin Pierce\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE was born at Hillsborough, New Hampshire, November\r\n23d, 1804; was a Representative from New Hampshire, December 2d,\r\n1833, to March 3d, 1837; was United States Senator from New Hampshire,\r\nSeptember 4th, 1837 - 1842, when he resigned; declined the position\r\nof Attorney-General, offered him by President Polk in 1846; served\r\nin the Mexican War as brigadier-general; was President of the United\r\nStates, March 4th, 1853, to March 3d, 1857, and died at Concord,\r\nNew Hampshire, October 8th, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nDIPLOMATIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's great work as Secretary of State--indeed, he regarded\r\nit as the greatest achievement of his life--was the negotiation of\r\na treaty with Great Britain adjusting all existing controversies.\r\nTo secure this had prompted Mr. Webster to enter the Cabinet of\r\nGeneral Harrison, and when Mr. Tyler became President Mr. Webster\r\npledged himself to his wealthy friends in Boston and New York not\r\nto resign until the troubles with the mother country had been\r\namicably adjusted.  His position soon became very unpleasant.  On\r\nthe one hand President Tyler, whose great desire was the annexation\r\nof Texas, wanted him to resign; on the other hand, many influential\r\nWhigs began to regard him with distrust for remaining in the enemy's\r\ncamp.  But Mr. Webster kept on, regardless of what was said by\r\nfriend or foe.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Lord Ashburton to represent the British Government\r\nwas especially gratifying to Mr. Webster, who had become personally\r\nacquainted with him when he visited England in 1839.  Lord Ashburton's\r\nfamily name was Alex. Baring.  He had visited Philadelphia when it\r\nwas the seat of the Federal Government as the representative of\r\nhis father's banking house.  Among those to whom he had letters of\r\nintroduction was Mr. John A. Bingham, a wealthy merchant and United\r\nStates Senator, who lived in great style.  Miss Maria Matilda\r\nBingham, the Senator's only daughter, who was but sixteen years of\r\nage, had just been persuaded by the Count de Tilly, a profligate\r\nFrench nobleman, to elope with him.  They were married, but the\r\nCount soon intimated that he did not care for the girl if he could\r\nobtain some of her prospective fortune.  He finally accepted five\r\nthousand pounds in cash and an annuity of six hundred pounds, and\r\nleft for France.  A divorce was obtained, and Senator Bingham was\r\nwell pleased soon afterward when young Mr. Baring wooed and won\r\nhis daughter.  With the fortune her father gave her he was enabled\r\non his return to London to enter the House of Baring Brothers as\r\na partner, and on retiring from business in 1835 he was created a\r\nBaron, with the title of Lord Ashburton.  When appointed on a\r\nspecial mission to Washington Lord Ashburton wrote to Mr. Webster,\r\nasking him to rent a suitable house for the accommodation of himself\r\nand suite.  Mr. Webster accordingly rented the spacious and thoroughly\r\nequipped mansion erected by Matthew St. Clair Clarke, Clerk of the\r\nHouse, in his prosperous days.  The price paid was twelve thousand\r\ndollars rent for ten months, and an additional thousand dollars\r\nfor damages.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, who had received full powers from President Tyler to\r\nconduct the negotiations on the part of the United States, occupied\r\nthe Swann House, near that occupied by Lord Ashburton.  Much of\r\nthe preliminary negotiation was carried on at the dinner-tables of\r\nthe contracting parties, and Congressional guests were alike charmed\r\nby the hospitable attentions of the \"fine old English gentleman\"\r\nand the Yankee Secretary of State.  Lord Ashburton offered his\r\nguests the cream of culinary perfection and the gastronomic art,\r\nwith the rarest wines, while at Mr. Webster's table American\r\ndelicacies were served in American style.  Maine salmon, Massachusetts\r\nmackerel, New Jersey oysters, Florida shad, Kentucky beef, West\r\nVirginia mutton, Illinois prairie chickens, Virginia terrapin,\r\nMaryland crabs, Delaware canvas-back ducks, and South Carolina rice-\r\nbirds were cooked by Monica, and served in a style that made the\r\nbanker diplomat admit their superiority to the potages, sauces,\r\nentremets, ragouts, and desserts of his Parisian white-capped\r\nmanipulator of casse-roles.\r\n\r\nLord Ashburton was about five feet ten inches in height, and was\r\nheavily built, as Mr. Webster was.  He had a large head, a high\r\nforehead, dark eyes, with heavy eyebrows, and a clear red and white\r\ncomplexion.  His principal secretary and adviser was Mr. Frederick\r\nWilliam Adolphus Bruce, then in the Foreign Office, who, after a\r\nbrilliant diplomatic career, was appointed a Knight Commander of\r\nthe Bath, and came again to Washington in 1865 as the British\r\nMinister.  Another secretary was Mr. Stepping, a fair-complexioned\r\nlittle gentleman, who was a great wit, and who made a deal of sport\r\nfor the Congressional guests.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, as finally agreed upon, settled a vexatious quarrel\r\nover our Northeastern boundary, it overthrew the British claim to\r\nexercise the right of search, and it established the right of\r\nproperty in slaves on an American vessel driven by stress of weather\r\ninto a British port.  But the treaty did not settle the exasperating\r\ncontroversy over the fisheries on the North Atlantic coast or the\r\ndisputed Northwestern boundary.  When the treaty finally reached\r\nthe Senate, it was debated for several weeks in executive session,\r\nMr. Benton leading a strong opposition to it.  Near the close of\r\nthe debate Mr. Calhoun made a strong speech in favor of ratification,\r\nin which he praised both Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster.  This\r\nspeech secured the ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded the Ashburton Treaty, Mr. Webster started for New\r\nEngland to enjoy the rural life so dear to him on his farm at\r\nFranklin, New Hampshire, and at Marshfield, Massachusetts.  He\r\nannounced, before he left Washington, that on his arrival at Boston\r\nhe should address his friends in Faneuil Hall, and there was an\r\nintense desire to her what he might have to say on public affairs.\r\nThe leaders of the Whig party hoped that he would announce a\r\nresignation of his office as Secretary of State, denounce the\r\nduplicity of President Tyler, and come gracefully to the support\r\nof Henry Clay, who had imperiously demanded the Presidential\r\nnomination.  But Mr. Webster declined to accept the advice given\r\nhim, and spoke his mind very freely and frankly.  There was--said\r\none who heard the speech--no sly insinuation of innuendo, but a\r\nstraightforward, independent expression of truth, a copious outpouring\r\nof keen reproof, solemn admonition, and earnest entreaty.\r\n\r\nAmong those former home-friends whose behavior was very annoying\r\nto Mr. Webster at this time was Mr. Abbott Lawrence, a Boston\r\nmerchant, who, having amassed a large fortune, coveted political\r\nhonors, and was a liberal contributor to the campaign fund of his\r\nparty.  Astute and observing, he imagined himself a representative\r\nof the merchant-princes of Venice under the Doges and England under\r\nthe Plantagenets, and he spoke in a measured, stately tone, advancing\r\nhis ideas with a positiveness that would not brook contradiction.\r\nOn several occasions he had been one of the \"solid men of Boston\"\r\nwho had contributed considerable sums for the pecuniary relief of\r\nMr. Webster, and this emboldened him to assume a dictatorial tone\r\nin advising the Secretary of State to resign after the Ashburton\r\nTreaty had been negotiated.  The command was treated with sovereign\r\ncontempt, and thenceforth Mr. Lawrence looked upon Mr. Webster as\r\nungrateful, and as standing in the way of his own political\r\nadvancement.  But Mr. Webster defied the would-be cotton-lord,\r\nsaying:  \"I am a Whig--a Faneuil Hall Whig--and if any one undertakes\r\nto turn me out of that communion, let him see to it who gets out\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Webster had been negotiating the Ashburton Treaty, and\r\nafter he had found rest at Marshfield, he displayed the same\r\nsprightly humor and tender sweetness which so endeared him to those\r\nwho were permitted to enjoy intimate social relations with him.\r\nHe always rose with the sun, visiting his farm-yards at Marshfield,\r\nand going to market at Washington, before breakfast, with a visit\r\nat either place to the kitchen, where he would gravely discuss the\r\nculinary programme of the day with Monica, a cook of African descent,\r\nwhose freedom he had purchased.  After breakfast, he would study\r\nor write or fish all day, dressing for a late dinner, after which\r\nhe gave himself up to recreation; sometimes, as Colonel Seaton's\r\ndaughter has pleasantly told us, singing hymns or songs, generally\r\nimpartially to the same tune; or gravely essaying the steps of a\r\n_minuet de la cour_, which he had seen danced in the courtly\r\nMadisonian era; or joining in the jests of the gay circle, magnificent\r\nteeth gleaming, his great, living coals of eyes--\"sleeping furnaces,\"\r\nCarlyle called them--soft as a woman's; or his rare, tender smile\r\nlighting up the dusky grandeur of his face.  Mr. Webster was not,\r\nat that period of his life, an intemperate drinker, although, like\r\nmany other gentlemen of that day, he often imbibed too freely at\r\nthe dinner-table.\r\n\r\nAn amusing account has been given of an after-dinner speech by Mr.\r\nWebster at a gathering of his political friends, when he had to be\r\nprompted by a friend who sat just behind him, and gave him successively\r\nphrases and topics.  The speech proceeded somewhat after this\r\nfashion:  Prompter:  \"Tariff.\"  Webster:  \"The tariff, gentlemen,\r\nis a subject requiring the profound attention of the statesman.\r\nAmerican industry, gentlemen, must be ----\" (nods a little).\r\nPrompter:  \"National Debt.\"  Webster:  \"And, gentlemen, there's\r\nthe national debt--it should be paid (loud cheers, which rouse the\r\nspeaker); yes, gentlemen, it should be paid (cheers), and I'll be\r\nhanged if it sha'n't be--(taking out his pocket-book)--I'll pay it\r\nmyself!  How much is it?\"  This last question was asked of a\r\ngentleman near him with drunken seriousness, and, coupled with the\r\nrecollection of the well-known impecuniosity of Webster's pocket-\r\nbook it excited roars of laughter, amidst which the orator sank\r\ninto his seat and was soon asleep.\r\n\r\nProminent among the Whig Senators was Nathan F. Dixon, of Westerly,\r\nRhode Island.  He was one of the old school of political gentlemen.\r\nHis snow-white hair was tied in a long queue, he had a high forehead,\r\naquiline nose, wide mouth, and dark eyes, which gleamed thorough\r\nhis glasses.  Respecting the body of which he was a member, he used\r\nto appear in a black coat and knee-breeches, with a ruffled shirt,\r\nwhite waistcoat, and white silk stockings.  He was the Chairman of\r\nthe Whig Senatorial caucus, and on the last night of the extra\r\nsession Mr. Clay had complimented him, in rather equivocal language,\r\non the ability with which he had presided.  When the laughter had\r\nsubsided, Senator Dixon rose, and with inimitable humor thanked\r\nthe Senator from Kentucky.  \"I am aware,\" said he, \"that I never\r\nhad but one equal as a presiding officer, and that was the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky.  Some of you may have thought that he was not in\r\nearnest, but did you know him as well as I do, you would credit\r\nany remark he may make before ten o'clock at night--after that,\r\nowing to the strength of his night-caps, there may be doubts.\"\r\nRoars of laughter followed, and the Senate caucus adjourned, as\r\nthe Senate had done, _sine die_.\r\n\r\nPresident Tyler had great faith in the power of the newspaper press,\r\nand he secured, at an early period of his Administration, by a\r\nlavish distribution of the advertising patronage of the Executive\r\nDepartments, an \"organ\" in nearly every State.  The journals thus\r\nrecompensed for their support of the Administration were generally\r\nwithout political influence, but Mr. Tyler prized their support,\r\nand personally looked after their interests.  Alluding to them in\r\na letter to a friend, he said:  \"Their motives may be selfish, but\r\nif I reject them for that, who among the great mass of office-\r\nholders can be trusted?  They give one all the aid in their power,\r\nand I do not stop to inquire into motives.\"  In another letter he\r\ncomplains of an official at New Orleans, saying:  \"I have felt no\r\nlittle surprise at the fact that he should have thrown into the\r\n_Bee_ [a most abusive paper] advertisements of great value, and\r\nrefused to give them to the _Republican_, a paper zealous and able\r\nin the cause of the Administration.\"  The central \"organ,\" from\r\nwhich the others were to take their cues, was the _Madisonian_,\r\noriginally established by Thomas Allen.  He disposed of it after\r\nhe married the handsome and wealthy Miss Russell, of Missouri,\r\nwhose tiara and necklace of diamonds had been the envy of all the\r\nladies at Washington.  John B. Johnson, the author of _Wild Western\r\nScenes_, then became the editor, and wrote ponderous editorials\r\nadvocating \"Justice to John Tyler,\" which the minor organs all over\r\nthe country were expected to copy.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Rufus Choate\r\nRUFUS CHOATE was born at Ipswich, Massachusetts, October 1st, 1819;\r\nwas a Representative in Congress from Massachusetts, 1831-1834;\r\nwas United States Senator, 1841-1845, and died at Halifax, Nova\r\nScotia, July 13th, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE CAPITOL AND THE DRAWING-ROOM.\r\n\r\nWhen the Twenty-seventh Congress met in December, 1841, it was\r\nevident that there could be no harmonious action between that body\r\nand the President, but he was not disposed to succumb.  Writing to\r\na friend, he said the coming session was \"likely to prove as\r\nturbulent and fractious as any since the days of Adam.  But [he\r\nadded] I have a firm grip on the reins.\"  In this he was mistaken,\r\nor, rather, he had been deceived by the sycophants around him.\r\nNeither House paid any attention to the recommendations which he\r\nmade in his messages, and only a few of his nominations were\r\nconfirmed.  The Whigs, who had elected the President, repudiated\r\nall responsibility for his acts and treated him as a traitor, and\r\nthe Democrats, while they accepted offices from him, generally\r\nspoke of him with contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Senate contained at that time many able men.  Henry Clay was\r\nin the pride of his political power, but uneasy and restive as a\r\ncaged lion.  John C. Calhoun was in the full glory of his intellectual\r\nmagnificence and purity of personal character.  Preston's flexible\r\nvoice and graceful gestures invested his eloquence with resistless\r\neffect over those whom it was intended to persuade, to encourage,\r\nor to control.  Barrow, of Louisiana, the handsomest man in the\r\nSenate, spoke with great effect.  Phelps, of Vermont, was a somewhat\r\neccentric yet forcible debater.  Silas Wright, Levi Woodbury, and\r\nRobert J. Walker were laboring for the restoration of the Democrats\r\nto power.  Benton stood sturdily, like a gnarled oak-tree, defying\r\nall who offered to oppose him.  Allen, whose loud voice had gained\r\nfor him the appellation of \"the Ohio gong,\" spoke with his usual\r\nvehemence.  Franklin Pierce was demonstrating his devotion to the\r\nslave-power, while Rufus Choate poured forth his wealth of words\r\nin debate, his dark complexion corrugated by swollen veins, and\r\nhis great, sorrowful eyes gazing earnestly at his listeners.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives there were unusually brilliant and\r\nable men.  John Quincy Adams, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs, was the recognized leader.  Mr. Fillmore, of New York, a\r\nstalwart, pleasant-featured man, with a remarkably clear-toned\r\nvoice, was Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.  Henry A.\r\nWise, Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, was able to secure\r\na large share of patronage for the Norfolk Navy Yard.  George N.\r\nBriggs (afterward Governor of Massachusetts), who was an earnest\r\nadvocate of temperance, was Chairman of the Postal Committee.\r\nJoshua R. Giddings, who was a sturdy opponent of slavery at that\r\nearly day, was Chairman of the Committee on Claims.  John P. Kennedy,\r\nof Maryland, an accomplished scholar and popular author, was Chairman\r\nof the Committee on Commerce; Edward Stanley, of North Carolina,\r\nwas Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs; Leverett\r\nSaltonstall, of the Committee on Manufactures; indeed, there was\r\nnot a Committee of the House that did not have a first-class man\r\nas its chairman.\r\n\r\nBut the session soon became a scene of sectional strife.  Mr. Adams,\r\nin offering his customary daily budget of petitions, presented one\r\nfrom several anti-slavery citizens of Haverhill, Massachusetts,\r\npraying for a dissolution of the Union, which raised a tempest.\r\nThe Southern Representatives met that night, in caucus, and the\r\nnext morning Mr. Marshall, of Kentucky, offered a series of\r\nresolutions deploring the presentation of the obnoxious petition\r\nand censuring Mr. Adams for having presented it.  An excited and\r\nacrimonious debate, extending over several days, followed.  The\r\nprincipal feature of this exciting scene was the venerable object\r\nof censure, then nearly four-score years of age, his limbs trembling\r\nwith palsy, his bald head crimson with excitement, and tears dropping\r\nfrom his eyes, as he for four days stood defying the storm and\r\nhurling back defiantly the opprobrium with which his adversaries\r\nsought to stigmatize him.  He was animated by the recollection that\r\nthe slave-power had prevented the re-election of his father and of\r\nhimself to the Presidential chair, and he poured forth the hoarded\r\nwrath of half a century.  Lord Morpeth, who was then in Washington,\r\nand who occupied a seat in the floor of the House near Mr. Adams\r\nduring the entire debate, said that \"he put one in mind of a fine\r\nold game-cock, and occasionally showed great energy and power of\r\nsarcasm.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wise became the prosecutor of Mr. Adams, and asserted that both\r\nhe and his father were in alliance with Great Britain against the\r\nSouth.  Mr. Adams replied with great severity, his shrill voice\r\nringing through the hall.  \"Four or five years ago,\" said he, \"there\r\ncame to this house a man with his hands and face dripping with the\r\nblood of murder, the blotches of which are yet hanging upon him,\r\nand when it was proposed that he should be tried by this House for\r\nthe crime I opposed it.\"  After this allusion to the killing of\r\nMr. Cilley in a duel, Mr. Adams proceeded to castigate Mr. Wise\r\nwithout mercy.\r\n\r\nAt the spring races, in 1842, over the Washington Course, Mr.\r\nStanly, of North Carolina, accidentally rode so close to the horse\r\nof Mr. Wise as to jostle that gentleman, who gave him several blows\r\nwith a cane.  Mr. Stanly at once sent a friend to Mr. Wise with an\r\ninvitation to meet him at Baltimore, that they might settle their\r\ndifficulty, and then left for that city.  Mr. Wise remained in\r\nWashington, where he was arrested the next day, under the anti-\r\ndueling law, and placed under bonds to keep the peace.  Mr. Stanly\r\nremained at Baltimore for several days, expecting Mr. Wise.  He\r\nwas the guest of Mr. Reverdy Johnson, under whose instruction he\r\npracticed with dueling-pistols, firing at a mark.  One morning Mr.\r\nJohnson took a pistol himself and fired it, but the ball rebounded\r\nand struck him in the left eye, completely destroying it.  Mr.\r\nStanly returned the next day to Washington, where mutual friends\r\nadjusted the difficulty between Mr. Wise and himself.\r\n\r\nThe vaulted arches of the old Supreme Court room in the basement\r\nof the Capitol (now the Law Library) used to echo in those days\r\nwith the eloquence of Clay, Webster, Choate, Sargent, Binney,\r\nAtherton, Kennedy, Berrien, Crittenden, Phelps, and other able\r\nlawyers.  Their Honors, the Justices, were rather a jovial sort,\r\nespecially Judge Story, who used to assert that every man should\r\nlaugh at least an hour during each day, and who had himself a great\r\nfund of humorous anecdotes.  One of them, that he loved to tell,\r\nwas of Jonathan Mason, of whom he always spoke in high praise.  It\r\nset forth that at the trial of a Methodist preacher for the alleged\r\nmurder of a young girl, the evidence was entirely circumstantial,\r\nand there was a wide difference of opinion concerning his guilt.\r\nOne morning, just before the opening of the court, a brother preacher\r\nstepped up to Mason and said:  \"Sir, I had a dream last night, in\r\nwhich the angel Gabriel appeared and told me that the prisoner was\r\nnot guilty.\"  \"Ah!\" replied Mason, \"have him subpoenaed immediately.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens first visited Washington in 1842.  He was then a\r\nyoung man.  The attentions showered upon the great progenitor of\r\nDick Swiveller turned his head.  The most prominent men in the\r\ncountry told him how they had ridden with him in the _Markis of\r\nGranby_, with old Weller on the box and Samivel on the dickey; how\r\nthey had played cribbage with the Marchioness and quaffed the rosy\r\nwith Dick Swiveller; how they had known honest Tim Linkwater and\r\nangelic Little Nell, ending with the welcome words of Sir John\r\nFalstaff, \"D'ye think we didn't know ye?  We knew ye as well as\r\nHim that made ye.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster gave a party on the night of January 26th, 1842, which\r\nwas the crowning entertainment of the season.  Eight rooms of his\r\ncommodious house were thrown open to the guests, and were most\r\ndazzlingly lighted.  There had not been in two Administrations so\r\nlarge and brilliant an assemblage of female beauty and political\r\nrank.  Among the more distinguished guests were the President, Lord\r\nMorpeth, Mr. Fox, the British Minister, M. Bacourt, the French\r\nMinister, Mr. Bodisco, the Russian Minister, and most of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps attached to the several legations, besides several\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court and many members of Congress.  The\r\nhonorable Secretary received his numerous guests with that dignity\r\nand courtesy which was characteristic of him, and seemed to be in\r\nexcellent spirits.  There no dancing, not even music.  There was,\r\nhowever, plenty of lively conversation, promenades, eating of ices,\r\nand sipping of rich wines, with the usual spice of flirtation.\r\n\r\nPresident Tyler's last reception of the season of 1842, on the\r\nnight of the 15th of March, gathered one of the greatest crowds\r\never assembled in the White House.  There was every variety of the\r\nAmerican citizen _et citoyenne_ present--those of every form, shape,\r\nlength, breadth, complexion, and dress.  There were old ladies\r\ndecked in the finery of their youthful days, and children in their\r\nnurses' arms.  \"Boz\" was the lion of the evening, and he stood like\r\nPatience on a monument.  He totally eclipsed Washington Irving,\r\nwho was then at Washington to receive his instructions as Minister\r\nto Spain.  The President's Cabinet, Foreign Ministers, some of the\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court, a sprinkling of Senators, two or three\r\nscores of Representatives, and fifteen hundred man, women, and\r\nchildren, in every costume, and from every nook and corner of the\r\ncountry, made up the remainder of the medley.\r\n\r\nA children's fancy ball was given at the White House by President\r\nTyler, in honor of the birthday of his eldest granddaughter.\r\nDressed as a fairy, with gossamer wings, a diamond star on her\r\nforehead, and a silver wand, she received her guests.  Prominent\r\namong the young people was the daughter of General Almonte, the\r\nMexican Minister, arrayed as an Aztec Princess.  Master Schermerhorn,\r\nof New York, was beautifully dressed as an Albanian boy, and Ada\r\nCutts, as a flower-girl, gave promise of the intelligence and beauty\r\nwhich in later years led captive the \"Little Giant\" of the West.\r\nThe boys and girls of Henry A. Wise were present, the youngest in\r\nthe arms of its mother, and every State in the Union was\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nAfter old Baron Bodisco's marriage to the young and beautiful Miss\r\nWilliams, the Russian Legation at Georgetown became the scene of\r\nbrilliant weekly entertainments, given, it was asserted, by especial\r\ndirection of the Emperor Nicholas, who had a special allowance made\r\nfor table-money.  At these entertainments there was dancing, an\r\nexcellent supper, and a room devoted to whist.  Mr. Webster, Mr.\r\nClay, General Scott, and several of the Diplomatic Corps were\r\ninvariably to be seen handling \"fifty-two pieces of printed\r\npasteboard,\" while the old Baron, though not a good player, as the\r\nhost of the evening, was accustomed to take a hand.  One night he\r\nsat down to play with those better acquainted with the game, and\r\nhe lost over a thousand dollars.  At the supper-table he made the\r\nfollowing announcement, in a sad tone:  \"Ladies and gentlemens:\r\nIt is my disagreeable duty to make the announce that these receptions\r\nmust have an end, and to declare them at an end for the present,\r\nbecause why?  The fund for their expend, ladies and gentlemens, is\r\nexhaust, and they must discontinue.\"\r\n\r\nOle Bull, the renowned violinist, then gave a concert at Washington,\r\nwhich was largely and fashionably attended.  In the midst of one\r\nof his most exquisite performances, while every breath was suspended,\r\nand every ear attentive to catch the sounds of his magical instrument,\r\nthe silence was suddenly broken and the harmony harshly interrupted\r\nby the well-known voice of General Felix Grundy McConnell, a\r\nRepresentative from the Talladega district of Alabama, shouting,\r\n\"None of your high-falutin, but give us Hail Columbia, and bear\r\nhard on the treble!\"  \"Turn him out,\" was shouted from every part\r\nof the house, and the police force in attendance undertook to remove\r\nhim from the hall.  \"Mac,\" as he was called, was not only one of\r\nthe handsomest men in Congress, but one of the most athletic, and\r\nit was a difficult task for the policemen to overpower him, although\r\nthey used their clubs.  After he was carried from the hall, some\r\nof his Congressional friends interfered, and secured his release.\r\n\r\nThe publication of verbatim reports of the proceedings of Congress\r\nwas systematically begun during Polk's Administration by John C.\r\nRives, in the _Congressional Globe_, established a few years\r\npreviously as an offshoot from the old Democratic organ.  This\r\nunquestionably had a disastrous effect upon the eloquence of\r\nCongress, which no longer hung upon the accents of its leading\r\nmembers, and rarely read what appeared in the report of the debates.\r\nImitating Demosthenes and Cicero, Chatham and Burke, Mirabeau and\r\nLamartine, the Congressmen of the first fifty years of the Republic\r\npoured forth their breathing thoughts and burning words in polished\r\nand elegant language, and were listened to by their colleagues and\r\nby spectators so alive to the beauties of eloquence that they were\r\nentitled to the appellation of assemblages of trained critics.\r\nThe publication of verbatim reports of the debates put an end to\r\nthis, for Senators and Representatives addressed their respective\r\nconstituents through the _Congressional Globe_.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Felix Grundy\r\nFELIX GRUNDY was born in Berkeley County, Virginia (now West\r\nVirginia), September 11th, 1777; was a Representative from Tennessee,\r\n1811-1814; was United States Senator, 1829-1838; was Attorney-\r\nGeneral under President Van Buren, 1838-1840; was again elected\r\nSenator in 1840, and died at Nashville, December 19th of the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nLIGHTS AND SHADOWS.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler, who was fifty-one years of age when he took possession\r\nof the Executive Mansion, was somewhat above the medium height,\r\nand of slender figure, with long limbs and great activity of\r\nmovement.  His thin auburn hair turned white during his term of\r\noffice, his nose was large and prominent, his eyes were of a bluish-\r\ngray, his lips were thin, and his cheeks sunken.  His manners were\r\nthose of the old school of Virginia gentlemen, and he was very\r\ncourteous to strangers.  The ceremonious etiquette established at\r\nthe White House by Van Buren vanished, and the President lived\r\nprecisely as he had on his plantation, attended by his old family\r\nslaves.  He invariably invited visitors with whom he was acquainted,\r\nor strangers who were introduced to him, to visit the family dining-\r\nroom and \"take something\" from a sideboard well garnished with\r\ndecanters of ardent spirits and wines, with a bowl of juleps in\r\nthe summer and of egg-nog in the winter.  He thus expended nearly\r\nall of his salary, and used to regret that it was not larger, that\r\nhe might entertain his guests more liberally.\r\n\r\nOne day President Tyler joked Mr. Wise about his little one-horse\r\ncarriage, which the President styled \"a candle-box on wheels,\" to\r\nwhich the Representative from the Accomac district retorted by\r\ntelling Mr. Tyler that he had been riding for a month in a second-\r\nhand carriage purchased at the sale of the effects of Mr. Paulding,\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy under Mr. Van Buren, and having the\r\nPaulding coat-of-arms emblazoned on the door-panels.  The President\r\nlaughed at the sally, and gave orders at once to have the armorial\r\nbearings of the Pauldings painted over.  Economy also prompted the\r\npurchase of some partly worn suits of livery at the sale of the\r\neffects of a foreign Minister, and these were afterward worn by\r\nthe colored waiters in state dinners.\r\n\r\n\"Beau\" Hickman, as he called himself, made his appearance at\r\nWashington toward the close of the Tyler Administration.  He was\r\nof middle size, with long hair, and an inoffensive, cadaverous\r\ncountenance.  It was his boast that he was born among the slashes\r\nof Hanover County, Virginia, and he was to be seen lounging about\r\nthe hotels, fashionably, yet shabbily, dressed, generally wearing\r\nsoiled white kid gloves and a white cravat.  It was considered the\r\nproper thing to introduce strangers to the Beau, who thereupon\r\nunblushingly demanded his initiation fee, and his impudence sometimes\r\nsecured him a generous sum.  He was always ready to pilot his\r\nvictims to gambling-houses and other questionable resorts, and for\r\na quarter of a century he lived on the blackmail thus levied upon\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most agreeable homes in Washington was that of Colonel\r\nBenton, the veteran Senator from Missouri, whose accomplished and\r\ngraceful daughters had been thoroughly educated under his own\r\nsupervision.  He was not willing, however, that one of them, Miss\r\nJessie, should receive the attentions of a young second lieutenant\r\nin the corps of the Topographical Engineers, Mr. Fremont, and the\r\nyoung couple, therefore, eloped and were married clandestinely.\r\nThe Colonel, although terribly angry at first, accepted the situation,\r\nand his powerful support in Congress afterward enabled Mr. Fremont\r\nto explore, under the patronage of the General Government, the vast\r\ncentral regions beyond the Rocky Mountains, and to plant the national\r\nflag on Wind River Peak, upward of thirteen thousand feet above\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nA very different wedding was that of Baron Alexander de Bodisco,\r\nthe Russian Minister Plenipotentiary, and Miss Harriet Williams,\r\na daughter of the chief clerk in the office of the Adjutant-General.\r\nThe Baron was nearly fifty years of age, with dyed hair, whiskers,\r\nand moustache, and she a blonde schoolgirl of \"sweet sixteen,\"\r\ncelebrated for her clear complexion and robust beauty.  The ceremony\r\nwas performed at her father's house on Georgetown Heights, and was\r\na regular May and December affair throughout.  There were eight\r\ngroomsmen, six of whom were well advanced in life, and as many\r\nbridesmaids, all of them young girls from fourteen to sixteen years\r\nof age, wearing long dresses of white satin damask, donated by the\r\nbridegroom.  The question of precedence gave the Baron much trouble,\r\nas he could not determine whether Mr. Fox, then the British Minister\r\nand Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, or Senator Buchanan, who had been\r\nMinister to Russia, should be the first groomsman.  This important\r\nquestion was settled by having the groomsmen and bridesmaids stand\r\nin couples, four on either side of the bridegroom and bride.  The\r\nceremony was witnessed at the bride's residence by a distinguished\r\ncompany, and the bridal party then went in carriages to the Russian\r\nLegation, where an elegant entertainment awaited them, and where\r\nsome of the many guests got gloriously drunk in drinking the health\r\nof the happy couple.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria's diplomatic representative at Washington at that\r\ntime, the Honorable Henry Stephen Fox, was a son of General Fox,\r\nof the British Army, who fought at the battle of Lexington in 1775,\r\nand a nephew of the eminent statesman, Charles James Fox.  He had\r\nserved in the British Diplomatic Corps for several years, and was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with his duties, but he held the least possible\r\nintercourse with the Department of State and rarely entered a\r\nprivate house.  He used to rise about three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nand take his morning walk on Pennsylvania Avenue an hour or two\r\nlater.  Miss Seaton says that a gentleman on one occasion, meeting\r\nhim at dusk in the Capitol grounds, urged him to return with him\r\nto dinner, to which Mr. Fox replied that \"he would willingly do\r\nso, but his people were waiting breakfast for him.\"  On the occasion\r\nof the funeral of a member of the Diplomatic Corps, turning to the\r\nwife of the Spanish Minister, he said:  \"How very old we all look\r\nby daylight!\" it being the first time he had seen his colleagues\r\nexcept by candle-light.  He went to bed at daylight, after watering\r\nhis plants, of which he was passionately fond.\r\n\r\nJohn Howard Payne visited Washington to solicit from President\r\nTyler a foreign consulate.  He was then in the prime of life,\r\nslightly built, and rather under the medium height.  His finely\r\ndeveloped head was bald on the top, but the sides were covered with\r\nlight brown hair.  His nose was large, his eyes were light blue,\r\nand he wore a full beard, consisting of side-whiskers and a moustache,\r\nwhich were always well-trimmed.  He was scrupulously neat in his\r\ndress, and usually wore a dark brown frock coat and a black vest,\r\nwhile his neck was covered with a black satin scarf, which was\r\narranged in graceful folds across his breast.  Despite his unpretending\r\nmanner and his plain attire, there was something about his appearance\r\nwhich never failed to attract attention.  His voice was low and\r\nmusical, and when conversing on any subject in which he was deeply\r\ninterested he spoke with a degree of earnestness that enchained\r\nthe attention and touched the hearts of his listeners.  After much\r\nsolicitation by himself and his friends, he obtained the appointment\r\nof United States Consul at Tunis, and left for his post, where he\r\ndied, his remains being finally brought to the Capital and buried\r\nin Oak Hill Cemetery.\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of Washington about this time was the studio\r\nof Messrs. Moore & Ward, in one of the committee-rooms at the\r\nCapitol, where likenesses were taken--as the advertisement read--\r\n\"with the Daguerreotype, or Pencil of Nature.\"  The \"likenesses,\r\nby diffused light, could be taken by them in any kind of weather\r\nduring the daytime, and sitters were not subjected to the slightest\r\ninconvenience or unpleasant sensation.\"  The new discovery gradually\r\nsupplanted the painting of miniatures on ivory in water-colors,\r\nand the cutting of silhouettes from white paper, which were shown\r\non a black ground.  Another novel invention was the electric, or,\r\nas it was then called, the magnetic telegraph.  Mr. Morse had a\r\nmodel on exhibition at the Capitol, and the beaux and belles used\r\nto hold brief conversations over the mysterious wire.  At last the\r\nHouse considered a bill appropriating twenty-five thousand dollars,\r\nto be expended in a series of experiments with the new invention.\r\n\r\nIn the brief debate on the bill, Mr. Cave Johnson undertook to\r\nridicule the discovery by proposing that one-half of the proposed\r\nappropriation be devoted to experiments with mesmerism, while Mr.\r\nHoughton thought that Millerism (a religious craze then prevalent)\r\nshould be included in the benefits of the appropriation.  To those\r\nwho thus ridiculed the telegraph it was a chimera, a visionary\r\ndream like mesmerism, rather to be a matter of merriment than\r\nseriously entertained.  Men of character, men of erudition, men\r\nwho, in ordinary affairs, had foresight, were wholly unable to\r\nforecast the future of the telegraph.  Other motions disparaging\r\nto the invention were made, such as propositions to appropriate\r\npart of the sum to a telegraph to the moon.  The majority of Congress\r\ndid not concur in this attempt to defeat the measure by ridicule,\r\nand the bill was passed by the close vote of eighty-nine to eighty-\r\nthree.  A change of three votes, however, would have consigned the\r\ninvention to oblivion.  Another year witnessed the triumphant\r\nsuccess of the test of its practicability.  The invention vindicated\r\nits character as a substantial reality; it was no longer a chimera,\r\na visionary scheme to extort money from the public coffers.  Mr.\r\nMorse was no more subjected to the suspicion of lunacy, nor ridiculed\r\nin the Halls of Congress, but he had to give large shares of its\r\nprofits to Amos Kendall and F. O. J. Smith before he could make\r\nhis discovery of practical value.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Tribune_ was first published during the Tyler\r\nAdministration by Horace Greeley, who had very successfully edited\r\nthe _Log Cabin_, a political newspaper, during the preceding\r\nPresidential campaign.  The _Tribune_, like the New York _Herald_\r\nand _Sun_ was then sold at one cent a copy, and was necessarily\r\nlittle more than a brief summary of the news of the day.  But it\r\nwas the germ of what its editor lived to see it become--a great\r\nnewspaper.  It soon had a good circulation at Washington, where\r\nthe eminently respectable _National Intelligencer_ and the ponderous\r\n_Globe_ failed to satisfy the reading community.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster remained in the Cabinet until the spring of 1843, when\r\nthe evident determination of President Tyler to secure the annexation\r\nof Texas made it very desirable that Webster should leave, so he\r\nwas \"frozen out\" by studied reserve and coldness.  By remaining in\r\nthe Cabinet he had estranged many of his old political associates,\r\nand Colonel Seaton, anxious to bring about a reconciliation, gave\r\none of his famous \"stag\" supper-parties, to which he invited a\r\nlarge number of Senators and members of the House of Representatives.\r\nThe convivialities had just commenced when the dignified form of\r\nWebster was seen entering the parlor, and as he advanced his big\r\neyes surveyed the company, recognizing, doubtless, some of those\r\nwho had become partially alienated from him.  On the instant, up\r\nsprang a distinguished Senator from one of the large Southern\r\nStates, who exclaimed:  \"Gentlemen, I have a sentiment to propose\r\n--the health of our eminent citizen, the negotiator of the Ashburton\r\nTreaty.\"  The company enthusiastically responded.  Webster instantly\r\nreplied:  \"I have also a sentiment for you,--The Senate of the\r\nUnited States, without which the Ashburton Treaty would have been\r\nnothing, and the negotiator of that treaty less than nothing.\"\r\nThe quickness and fitness of this at once banished every doubtful\r\nor unfriendly feeling.  The company clustered around the magnate,\r\nwhose sprightly and edifying conversation never failed to excite\r\nadmiration, and the remainder of the evening was spent in a manner\r\nmost agreeable to all.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the resignation of Mr. Webster the Cabinet was\r\nreconstructed, but a few months later the bursting of a cannon on\r\nthe war-steamer Princeton, while returning from a pleasure excursion\r\ndown the Potomac, killed Mr. Upshur, the newly appointed Secretary\r\nof State, Mr. Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy, with six others, while\r\nColonel Benton narrowly escaped death and nine seamen were injured.\r\nThe President had intended to witness the discharge of the gun,\r\nbut was casually detained in the cabin, and so escaped harm.  This\r\nshocking catastrophe cast a gloom over Washington, and there was\r\na general attendance, irrespective of party, at the funeral of the\r\ntwo Cabinet officers, who were buried from the White House.\r\n\r\nOne of those killed by the explosion on the Princeton was Mr.\r\nGardiner, a New York gentleman, whose ancestors were the owners of\r\nGardiner's Island, in Long Island Sound.  His daughter Julia, a\r\nyoung lady of fine presence, rare beauty, and varied accomplishments,\r\nhad for some time been the object of marked attention from President\r\nTyler, although he was in his fifty-fifth year and she but about\r\ntwenty.  Soon after she was deprived of her father they were quietly\r\nmarried in church at New York, and President Tyler brought his\r\nyoung bride to the White House.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lydia Dickinson, wife of Daniel F. Dickinson, a Senator from\r\nNew York, was the recognized leader of Washington society during\r\nthe Administration of President Tyler.  She was the daughter of\r\nDr. Knapp, and, when a school girl, fell in love with Dickinson,\r\nthen a smart young wool-dresser, and discerning his talents, urged\r\nhim to study law and to fit himself for a high political position\r\nin life.  She was gratified by his unexampled advancement, and when\r\nhe came here a United States Senator, she soon took a prominent\r\npart in the social life of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  CCushing\r\nCALEB CUSHING was born at Salisbury, Massachusetts, January 7th,\r\n1800; was a Representative in Congress from Massachusetts, 1835-\r\n1843; was Commissioner to China, 1843-1845; served in the Mexican\r\nWar as Colonel and Brigadier-General, 1847-1848; was Attorney-\r\nGeneral of the United States under President Pierce, 1853-1857;\r\nwas counsel for the United States before the Geneva tribunal of\r\narbitration on the Alabama claims, 1871; was Minister to Spain,\r\n1874-1877, and died at Newburyport, Massachusetts, January 2d, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nHOW TEXAS BECAME A STATE.\r\n\r\nPresident Tyler was encouraged in his desire to have Texas admitted\r\nas a State of the Union by Henry A. Wise, his favorite adviser,\r\nand by numerous holders of Texan war scrip and bonds.  Before the\r\nvictims of the Princeton explosion were shrouded, Mr. Wise called\r\nupon Mr. McDuffie, a member of the Senate, who represented Mr.\r\nCalhoun's interests at Washington, and informed him that the\r\ndistinguished South Carolinian would be appointed Secretary of\r\nState.  Mr. Wise urged the Senator to write to Mr. Calhoun at once,\r\nbegging him not to decline the position should he be nominated and\r\nconfirmed.  Mr. McDuffie did not ask Mr. Wise if he spoke by Mr.\r\nTyler's authority, but evidently believed that he was so authorized,\r\nand promised to write to Mr. Calhoun by that afternoon's mail.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise then went to the Executive Mansion, where he found Mr.\r\nTyler in the breakfast room, much affected by the account of the\r\nawful catastrophe of the previous day.  Mr. Wise told him rather\r\nabruptly that it was no time for grief, as there were vacancies in\r\nthe Cabinet to be filled, in order that urgent matters then under\r\nhis control might be disposed of.  \"What is to be done?\" asked\r\nPresident Tyler.  Mr. Wise had an answer ready:  \"Your most important\r\nwork is the annexation of Texas, and the man for that work is John\r\nC. Calhoun, as Secretary of State.  Send for him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir!\" replied the President, rather coldly.  \"The annexation\r\nof Texas is important, but Mr. Calhoun is not the man of my choice.\"\r\nThis was rather a damper on Mr. Wise, but he resolutely insisted\r\non Mr. Calhoun's appointment, and finally the President yielded.\r\nThe nomination was sent to the Senate and confirmed without\r\nopposition.  Mr. Calhoun came to Washington, and was soon installed\r\nas Secretary of State.  It took him only from February 28th to\r\nApril 12th to conclude the negotiation which placed the \"Lone Star\"\r\nin the azure field of the ensign of the Republic.  The treaty of\r\nannexation was signed and sent to the Senate for ratification, but\r\nafter a protracted discussion it was rejected by a vote of sixteen\r\nyeas to thirty-five nays.  Stephen A. Douglas, who had just entered\r\nCongress as one of the seven Representatives from Illinois, came\r\nto the front at that time as the principal advocate for the remission\r\nof a fine which had been imposed upon General Jackson by Judge Hall\r\nat New Orleans twenty-five years before.\r\n\r\nThis was the first move made by Mr. Douglas in his canvass for the\r\nPresidency, but he was soon prominent in that class of candidates\r\nof whom Senator William Allen, of Ohio, said, \"Sir! they are going\r\nabout the country like dry-goods drummers, exhibiting samples of\r\ntheir wares.\"  Always on the alert to make new friends and to retain\r\nold ones, he was not only a vigorous hand-shaker, but he would\r\nthrow his arms fondly around a man, as if that man held the first\r\nplace in his heart.  No statement was too chary of truth in its\r\ncomposition, no partisan manoeuvre was too openly dishonest, no\r\npolitical pathway was too dangerous, if it afforded an opportunity\r\nfor making a point for Douglas.  He was industrious and sagacious,\r\nclothing his brilliant ideas in energetic and emphatic language,\r\nand standing like a lion at bay when opposed.  He had a herculean\r\nframe, with the exception of his lower limbs, which were short and\r\nsmall, dwarfing what otherwise would have been a conspicuous figure,\r\nand he was popularly known as \"the Little Giant.\"  His large, round\r\nhead surmounted a massive neck, and his features were symmetrical,\r\nalthough his small nose deprived them of dignity.  His dark eyes,\r\npeering from beneath projecting brows, gleamed with energy, mixed\r\nwith an expression of slyness and sagacity, and his full lips were\r\ngenerally stained at the corners of his mouth with tobacco juice.\r\nHis voice was neither musical nor soft, and his gestures were not\r\ngraceful.  But he would speak for hours in clear, well-enunciated\r\ntones, and the sharp Illinois attorney soon developed into the\r\nstatesman at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, at that period, could boast of more\r\nability than the Senate.  Among the most prominent members were\r\nthe accomplished Robert C. Winthrop, who so well sustained the\r\nreputation of his distinguished ancestors; Hamilton Fish, the\r\nrepresentative Knickerbocker from the State of New York; Alexander\r\nRamsey, a worthy descendant of the Pennsylvania Dutchmen; the\r\nloquacious Garrett Davis, of Kentucky; the emaciated Alexander H.\r\nStephens of Georgia, who apparently had not a month to live, yet\r\nwho rivaled Talleyrand in political intrigue; John Wentworth, a\r\ntall son of New Hampshire, transplanted to the prairies of Illinois;\r\nAndrew Johnson, of Tennessee, a born demagogue and self-constituted\r\nchampion of the people; John Slidell, of New Orleans; Robert Dale\r\nOwen, the visionary communist from Indiana; Howell Cobb, of Georgia,\r\nand Jacob Thompson, of Mississippi, who were busily laying the\r\nfoundations for the Southern Confederacy, \"with slavery as its\r\ncorner-stone;\" the brilliant Robert C. Schenck, of Ohio, and the\r\ngenial Isaac E. Holmes, of South Carolina, who softened the asperities\r\nof debate by many kindly comments made in an undertone.\r\n\r\nOne of General Schenck's stories was told by him to illustrate the\r\n\"change of base\" by those Whigs who had enlisted in the Tyler guard,\r\nyet declared that they had not shifted their position.  \"Many years\r\nprevious,\" he said, \"when silk goods were scarce and dear, an old\r\nlady in Ohio purchased a pair of black silk stockings.  Being very\r\nproud of this addition to her dress, she wore them frequently until\r\nthey became quite worn out; as often, however, as a hole appeared\r\nin these choice articles, she very carefully darned it up; but for\r\nthis purpose, having no silk, she was obliged to use white yarn.\r\nShe usually appropriated Saturday evenings to this exercise.\r\nFinally, she had darned them so much that not a single particle of\r\nthe original material or color remained.  Yet such was the force\r\nof habit with her that as often as Saturday evening came she would\r\nsay to her granddaughter, 'Anny, bring me my black silk stockings.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign of 1844 was very exciting.  Mr. Van\r\nBuren's friends did not entertain a shade of a doubt that he would\r\nbe nominated, and his opponents in the Democratic ranks had almost\r\nlost hope of defeating him in the nominating convention, when, at\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Calhoun, he was adroitly questioned on the\r\nannexation of Texas in a letter written to him by Mr. Hamett, a\r\nRepresentative from Mississippi.  Mr. Van Buren was too sagacious\r\na politician not to discover the pit thus dug for him, and he\r\nreplied with great caution, avowing himself in favor of the annexation\r\nof Texas when it could be brought about peacefully and honorably,\r\nbut against it at that time, when it would certainly be followed\r\nby war with Mexico.  This was what the Southern conspirators wanted,\r\nand their subsequent action was thus narrated in a letter written\r\na few years afterward by John Tyler, which is here published for\r\nthe first time:\r\n\r\n\"Texas,\" wrote Mr. Tyler, \"was the great theme that occupied me.\r\nThe delegates to the Democratic Convention, or a very large majority\r\nof them, had been elected under implied pledges to sustain Van\r\nBuren.  After his letter repudiating annexation, a revulsion had\r\nbecome obvious, but how far it was to operate it was not possible\r\nto say.  A majority of the delegates at least were believed still\r\nto remain in his favor.  If he was nominated the game to be played\r\nfor Texas was all over.  What was to be done?\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" Mr. Tyler went on to say, \"advised me to remain at\r\nrest, and take my chances in the Democratic Convention.  It was\r\nimpossible to do so.  If I suffered my name to be used in that\r\nConvention, then I became bound to sustain the nomination, even if\r\nMr. Van Buren was the nominee.  This could not be.  I chose to run\r\nno hazard, but to raise the banner of Texas, and convoke my friends\r\nto sustain it.  This was but a few weeks before the meeting of the\r\nConvention.  To my surprise, the notice which was thus issued\r\nbrought together a thousand delegates, and from every State in the\r\nUnion.  Many called on me on their way to Baltimore to receive my\r\nviews.  My instructions were, 'Go to Baltimore, make your nomination,\r\nthen go home, and leave the thing to work its own results.'  I said\r\nno more, and was obeyed.  The Democratic Convention felt the move.\r\nA Texan man or defeat was the choice left, and they took a Texan\r\nman.  My withdrawal at a suitable time took place, and the result\r\nwas soon before the world.  I acted to insure the success of a\r\ngreat measure, and I acted not altogether without effect.  In so\r\ndoing I kept my own secrets; to have divulged my purposes would\r\nhave been to have defeated them.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Whig Convention assembled at Baltimore, and Henry Clay\r\nwas nominated with great enthusiasm, ex-Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen,\r\nof New Jersey, being nominated as Vice-President.  The next day a\r\nhundred thousand Whigs, from every section of the Republic, met in\r\nmass convention at Baltimore, with music, banners, and badges, to\r\nratify the ticket.  Mr. Webster, with true magnanimity, was one of\r\nthe speakers, and advocated the election of Clay and Frelinghuysen\r\nwith all the strength of his eloquence.  The Whigs were jubilant\r\nwhen their chosen leader again took the field, and the truants\r\nflocked back to the standard which they had deserted to support\r\nJohn Tyler.  Harmony once more prevailed among the leaders and in\r\nthe ranks, and the Whig party was again in good working order.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the National Democratic Convention met in Baltimore\r\nand remained in session three days.  A majority of the delegates\r\nadvocated the nomination of ex-President Van Buren, but he was\r\ndefeated by permitting his opponents to pass the two-thirds rule,\r\nand on the third day James K. Polk was nominated.  Silas Wright\r\nwas nominated as Vice-President, but he positively declined, saying\r\nto his friends that he did not propose to ride behind on the black\r\npony [slavery] at the funeral of his slaughtered friend, Mr. Van\r\nBuren.  Mr. George M. Dallas, of Pennsylvania, was then nominated.\r\n\r\nGovernor Fairfield, of Maine, on his return from Philadelphia on\r\nthe first of June, 1844, whither he had gone as Chairman of a\r\nCommittee of the Democratic Convention to inform Mr. Dallas of his\r\nnomination as Vice-President, gave an amusing account of the scene.\r\nThe Committee reached Philadelphia about three o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and were piloted to Mr. Dallas' house by his friend,\r\nSenator Robert J. Walker.  Loud knocks at the door brought Mr.\r\nDallas to his chamber window.  Recognizing Mr. Walker, and fearing\r\nthat his daughter, who was in Washington, was ill, he hastened down-\r\nstairs, half dressed and in slippers, when, to his utter amazement,\r\nin walked sixty or more gentlemen, two by two, with the tread of\r\nsoldiers, passing him by and entering his front parlor, all\r\nmaintaining the most absolute silence.  Mr. Dallas, not having the\r\nslightest conception of their object, stood thunderstruck at the\r\nscene.  Mr. Walker then led him into the back parlor.  \"My dear\r\nWalker,\" said he, in amazement, \"what is the matter?\"  \"Wait, one\r\nmoment, if you please, Dallas, wait one moment, if you please.\"\r\nIn a few moments the folding-doors connecting the parlors were\r\nthrown back, and in the front parlor (which had meanwhile been\r\nlighted up) Mr. Dallas saw a semi-circle of gentlemen, who greeted\r\nhim with applause.  Governor Fairfield then stepped forward, and\r\nbriefly informed Mr. Dallas what the action of the convention had\r\nbeen.  The candidate for Vice-President, who had recovered from\r\nhis momentary surprise, eloquently acknowledged the compliment paid\r\nhim, and promised to more formally reply by letter.  He then opened\r\nhis sideboard, and all joined in pledging \"success to the ticket.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay unfortunately wrote a Texas letter, which fell like a wet\r\nblanket upon the Whigs, and enabled the Democratic managers to\r\ndeprive him of the vote of New York by organizing the Liberty party,\r\nwhich nominated James G. Birney, of Michigan, as President, and\r\nThomas Morris, of Ohio, as Vice-President.  This nomination received\r\nthe support of the anti-slavery men, of many disappointed adherents\r\nof Mr. Van Buren, and of the anti-Masonic and anti-rent factions\r\nof the Whig party of New York.  The consequence was that over sixty\r\nthousand votes were thrown away on Birney, nine-tenths of them\r\nbeing drawn from the Whig ranks, thus securing a complete triumph\r\nfor the Democrats.\r\n\r\nAt the \"birthnight ball,\" on the 22d of February, 1845, President\r\nTyler was accompanied by President-elect Polk.  Mrs. Madison also\r\nwas present with Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, and the members of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps wore their court uniforms.  A few nights afterward\r\nPresident Tyler gave a \"parting ball\" at the White House, his young\r\nand handsome wife receiving the guests with distinguished grace.\r\nMr. Polk was prevented from attending by the indisposition of his\r\nwife, but the Vice-President-elect, Mr. Dallas, with his splendid\r\ncrown of white hair, towered above all other guests except General\r\nScott and \"Long John\" Wentworth.  There was dancing in the East\r\nRoom, Mrs. Tyler leading off in the first set of quadrilles with\r\nMr. Wilkins, the Secretary of War, as her partner.  This entertainment\r\nconcluded the \"Cavalier\" reign within the White House, which was\r\nsoon ruled with Puritan austerity by Mr. Polk.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the session of Congress with which the Administration\r\nof John Tyler terminated, a joint resolution legislating Texas into\r\nthe Union was introduced.  When it had been passed by the House\r\nafter determined resistance, it was discussed, amended, and passed\r\nby the Senate.  It reached the President on the 2d of March, received\r\nhis immediate approval, and the next day a messenger was started\r\nfor Texas, to have it accepted, and thus secure annexation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of March, 1845, Mr. Tyler left the White\r\nHouse, not caring to assist in the inauguration of his successor.\r\nAs the Potomac steamer was about to swing away from the wharf,\r\nwhich was crowded with people who were glad to see the ex-President\r\ndepart, he came along with his family, a squadron of colored\r\nservants, and a great lot of luggage.  As they alighted from their\r\ncarriages at the head of the wharf the whistle sounded, the boat's\r\nbell rang, and she began slowly to move away.  Some one in the\r\ncrowd sang out, \"Hello! hello! Captain, hold on there, ex-President\r\nTyler is coming.  Hold on!\"  The captain, an old Clay Whig, standing\r\nnear the stern of the boat on the upper deck, looked over the rail,\r\nsaw the Presidential crowd coming, but pulled his engine bell\r\nviolently and shouted, \"Ex-President Tyler be dashed! let him stay!\"\r\nThis scene was lithographed and copies hung for years in many of\r\nthe saloons and public houses of Washington.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  S. A. Douglas\r\nSTEPHEN ARNOLD DOUGLAS was born at Brandon, Vermont, April 23d,\r\n1813; was a Representative in Congress from Illinois, 1843-1847;\r\nwas United States Senator from 1847 until his death at Chicago,\r\nJune 3d, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nRESTORATION OF THE DEMOCRATS.\r\n\r\nJames Knox Polk was inaugurated as the eleventh President of the\r\nUnited States on the 4th of March, 1845, a rainy, unpleasant day.\r\nHad any method of contesting a Presidential election been provided\r\nby the Constitution or the laws, the fraudulent means by which his\r\nelection was secured, would have been brought forward to prevent\r\nhis taking his seat.  But the Constitution had made no such provision,\r\nand Congress had not been disposed to interfere; so Mr. Polk was\r\nduly inaugurated with great pomp, under the direction of the dominant\r\nparty.  A prominent place was assigned in the inaugural procession\r\nfor the Democratic associations of Washington and other cities.\r\nThe pugilistic Empire Club from New York, led by Captain Isaiah\r\nRynders, had with it a small cannon, which was fired at short\r\nintervals as the procession advanced.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Marshal of the procession having issued orders that no\r\ncarriages should enter the Capitol grounds, the diplomats were\r\nforced to alight at a side gate in the rain, and to walk through\r\nthe mud to the Senate entrance, damaging their feathered chapeaux\r\nand their embroidered uniforms, to their great displeasure.\r\nConspicuous in the group around the President was Vice-President\r\nDallas, tall, erect, and dignified, with long, snow-white hair\r\nfalling over his shoulders.  The President-elect read his inaugural,\r\nwhich few heard, and when he had concluded Chief Justice Taney\r\nadministered the oath of office.  As Mr. Polk reverentially kissed\r\nthe Bible, the customary salutes boomed forth at the Navy Yard and\r\nat the Arsenal.  The new President was then escorted to the White\r\nHouse, the rain having made Pennsylvania Avenue so slippery with\r\nmud that not a few of the soldiers fell ingloriously on the march.\r\n\r\nThe cry, \"Who is James K. Polk?\" raised by the Whigs when he was\r\nnominated, was unwarranted, for he was not an unknown man.  He had\r\nbeen a member of the House from 1825 to 1839, Speaker from 1835 to\r\n1837, and chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means during a\r\nportion of his membership.  He had been a Jackson leader in the\r\nHouse, and as such he had manifested not only zeal and skill as a\r\nparty manager, but also substantial qualities of a respectable\r\norder.  It seems certain that Polk was selected by the Southern\r\nDemocracy some time before the Convention met in 1844, and that he\r\nwas heartily in sympathy with the movement for conquering a portion\r\nof Mexico to be made into slave States.  Polk entered heartily into\r\nthis business, and worked harmoniously with the instigators of\r\nconquest, except that he became self-willed when his vanity was\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk was a spare man, of unpretending appearance and\r\nmiddle stature, with a rather small head, a full, angular brow,\r\npenetrating dark gray eyes, and a firm mouth.  His hair, which he\r\nwore long and brushed back behind his ears, was touched with silver\r\nwhen he entered the White House and was gray when he left it.  He\r\nwas a worthy and well-qualified member of the fraternity of the\r\nFreemasons, and a believer in the creed of the Methodists, although,\r\nout of deference to the religious opinions of his wife, he attended\r\nworship with her at the First Presbyterian Church.  Calm, cold,\r\nand intrepid in his moral character, he was ignorant of the beauty\r\nof moral uprightness in the conduct of public affairs, but was\r\nambitious of power and successful in the pursuit of it.  He was\r\nvery methodical and remarkably industrious, always finding time to\r\nlisten patiently to the stories of those who came to him as\r\npetitioners for patronage and place.  But his arduous labors impaired\r\nhis health and doubtless shortened his life.  Before his term of\r\noffice had half expired his friends were pained to witness his\r\nshortened and enfeebled step, and the air of languor and exhaustion\r\nwhich sat upon him.\r\n\r\nThere were two inauguration balls in honor of the new President's\r\naccession to power--one at ten dollars a ticket, and the other at\r\ntwo dollars.  The ten-dollar ball was at Carusi's saloon, and was\r\nattended by the leaders of Washington society, the Diplomatic Corps,\r\nand many officers of the Army and Navy.  Madame de Bodisco, wife\r\nof the Russian Minister, in a superb court dress, which she had\r\nworn while on her bridal visit to St. Petersburg, attracted much\r\nattention and contrasted strongly with Mrs. Polk, whose attire was\r\nvery plain.  The ball at the National Theatre was more democratic,\r\nand was attended by an immense crowd, whose fight for the supper\r\nwas emblematical of the rush and scramble about to be made for the\r\nloaves and fishes of office.  When the guests began to depart, it\r\nwas found that the best hats, cloaks, and canes had been taken\r\nearly in the evening, and there was great grumbling.  Commodore\r\nElliot had his pocket picked at the White House on inauguration\r\nday, the thief depriving him of his wallet, which contained several\r\nvalued relics.  One was a letter from General Jackson, congratulating\r\nhim on his restoration to his position in the service, and containing\r\na lock of \"Old Hickory's\" hair; another was a letter from Mrs.\r\nMadison, inclosing a lock of Mr. Madison's hair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Polk was a strict Presbyterian, and she shunned what she\r\nregarded as \"the vanities of the world\" whenever it was possible\r\nfor her to do so.  She did not possess the queenly grace of Mrs.\r\nMadison or the warm-hearted hospitality of Mrs. Tyler, but she\r\npresided over the White House with great dignity.  She was of medium\r\nheight and size, with very black hair, dark eyes and complexion,\r\nand formal yet graceful deportment.  At the inauguration of her\r\nhusband she wore a black silk dress, a long black velvet cloak with\r\na deep cape, trimmed with fringe and tassels, and a purple velvet\r\nbonnet, trimmed with satin ribbon.  Her usual style of dress was\r\nrich, but not showy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Polk would not permit dancing at the White House, but she did\r\nall in her power to render the Administration popular.  One morning\r\na lady found her reading.  \"I have many books presented to me by\r\ntheir writers,\" said she, \"and I try to read them all; at present\r\nthis is not possible; but this evening the author of this book\r\ndines with the President, and I could not be so unkind as to appeared\r\nwholly ignorant and unmindful of his gift.\"  At one of her evening\r\nreceptions a gentleman remarked, \"Madame, you have a very genteel\r\nassemblage to-night.\"  \"Sir,\" replied Mrs. Polk, with perfect good\r\nhumor, but very significantly, \"I have never seen it otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. James Buchanan, the newly appointed Secretary of State, was at\r\nthis time in the prime of life, and his stalwart frame, fair\r\ncomplexion, light blue eyes, courtly manners, and scrupulously neat\r\nattire prompted an English visitor, Mrs. Maury, to say that he\r\nresembled a British nobleman of the past generation, when the grave\r\nand dignified bearing of men of power was regarded as an essential\r\nattribute of their office.  Although a bachelor, he kept house on\r\nF Street next to the abode of John Quincy Adams, where his accomplished\r\nniece presided at his hospitable board.  He faithfully carried out\r\nthe foreign policy of President Polk, but never let pass an\r\nopportunity for advancing, with refreshing humility, his own claims\r\nto the succession.  In a letter written to a friend he alluded to\r\na prediction that he would be the next President, and went on to\r\nsay:  \"I or any other man may disappear from the political arena\r\nwithout producing a ripple upon the surface of the deep and strong\r\ncurrent which is sweeping the country to its destiny.  Nothing has\r\nprevented me from removing myself from the list of future candidates\r\nfor the Presidency, except the injury this might do to the Democratic\r\ncause in Pennsylvania.  On this subject I am resolved, and whenever\r\nit may be proper I shall make known my resolution.  Nothing on\r\nearth could induce me again to accept a Cabinet appointment.\"  Yet\r\nnever did a wily politician more industriously plot and plan to\r\nsecure a nomination than Mr. Buchanan did, in his still-hunt for\r\nthe Presidency.\r\n\r\nWilliam Learned Marcy, the Secretary of War, was the \"wheel-horse\"\r\nof President Polk's Cabinet.  Heavily built, rather sluggish in\r\nhis movements, and always absorbed with some subject, he was not\r\nwhat is generally termed \"companionable,\" and neither bores nor\r\noffice-seekers regarded him as an amiable man.  He used to write\r\nhis most important dispatches in the library of his own house.\r\nWhen thus engaged he would at once, after breakfast, begin his work\r\nand write till nearly noon, when he would go to the Department,\r\nreceive calls, and attend to the regular routine duties of his\r\nposition.  During hours of composition he was so completely engrossed\r\nwith the subject that persons might enter, go out, or talk in the\r\nsame room without in the least obtaining his notice.  He usually\r\nsat in his dressing-gown, with an old red handkerchief on the table\r\nbefore him, and one could judge of the relative activity of his\r\nmind by the frequency of his application to the snuff-box.  In\r\ntruth, he was an inveterate snuff-taker, and his immoderate\r\nconsumption of that article appeared to have injuriously affected\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk, anxious to placate his defeated rival, Mr. Van\r\nBuren, tendered the appointment of Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nSilas Wright.  He declined it, having been elected Governor of the\r\nState of New York, but recommended for the position Mr. A. C. Flagg.\r\nGovernor Marcy objected to the appointment of Mr. Flagg, then to\r\nthe appointment of Mr. George Bancroft, the historian, and finally\r\naccepted himself the place of Secretary of War.  Mr. Robert J.\r\nWalker, a Pennsylvanian by birth and a Mississippian by adoption,\r\nwho had in the United States Senate advocated the admission of\r\nTexas and opposed the protection of American industries by a high\r\ntariff, was made Secretary of the Treasury.  Mr. George Bancroft\r\nwas appointed Secretary of the Navy, and Cave Johnson, of Tennessee,\r\nPostmaster-General.\r\n\r\nMr. John Y. Mason, who had been the Secretary of the Navy in Tyler's\r\nCabinet, was retained by Polk as his Attorney-General, having made\r\nearnest appeals that he might not be disturbed.  He wrote to an\r\ninfluential friend at Washington that he desired to remain in office\r\non account of his financial wants.  \"Imprudence amounting to\r\ninfatuation,\" he went on to say, \"while in Congress, embarrassed\r\nme, and I am barely recovering from it.  The place is congenial to\r\nmy feelings, and the salary will assist Virginia land and negroes\r\nin educating six daughters.  Although I still own a large estate,\r\nand am perfectly temperate in my habits, I have felt that the folly\r\nof my conduct in another respect may have led to the report that\r\nI was a sot--an unfounded rumor, which originated with a Richmond\r\npaper.\"  Governor Marcy used to joke Mr. Mason a good deal on the\r\nforwardness of the Old Dominion, the mother of Presidents, in urging\r\nthe claims of her children for Federal office--a propensity which\r\nwas amusingly illustrated at a private dinner where they were both\r\nin attendance.  \"How strange it is, Mason,\" said he, \"that out of\r\nthe thousands of fat appointments we have had to make, there is\r\nnot one that Virginia does not furnish a candidate for, and that\r\nevery candidate is backed up by the strongest testimonials that he\r\nwas expressly educated for that particular post!\"  Mason bore the\r\njoke very well, contenting himself with the observation that the\r\npeople of the United States seemed to know where to look for great\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Polk had been elected President on the platform of \"the whole\r\nof Oregon or none\" and \"54 deg. 40', or fight.\"  But Mr. McLean, who\r\nwas sent to England, negotiated a treaty fixing the boundary at 49 deg.,\r\nand \"54 deg. 40'\" was abandoned without the promised fight.  Another\r\ntroublesome legacy inherited by John Tyler was not so easily\r\narranged, and the Mexican War was inaugurated.  To the more\r\nintelligent portion of the Northern Whigs the contest was repulsive,\r\nand the manner in which it was used for the advancement of Democratic\r\npoliticians was revolting.  But few forgot their allegiance to this\r\ncountry in the face of the enemy.  Congress, repeatedly appealed\r\nto by the President, voted men and money without stint to secure\r\nthe national success and to maintain the national honor.  Whig\r\nStates which, like Massachusetts, had no sympathy for the war,\r\ncontributed the bravest of their sons, many of whom, like a son of\r\nDaniel Webster, fell victims to Mexican malaria or Mexican bullets.\r\n\r\nWhile President Polk endeavored to gratify each of the component\r\nfactions of the Democratic party in the composition of his Cabinet,\r\nhe ruthlessly deposed the veteran Francis P. Blair from the editorship\r\nof the _Globe_ to gratify the chivalry of South Carolina, who made\r\nit the condition upon which he could receive the electoral vote of\r\ntheir State, then in the hands of the General Assembly, and controlled\r\nby the politicians.  Blair & Rives had loaned ten thousand dollars\r\nto General Jackson, who was very indignant when he learned that\r\nhis old friends were to be shelved, but the Nullifiers were\r\ninexorable.  The _Globe_ ceased to be the editorial organ of the\r\nAdministration, and \"Father Ritchie,\" who had for many years edited\r\nthe Richmond _Inquirer_, was invited to Washington, where he\r\nestablished the _Union_, which became the mouthpiece of President\r\nPolk.  \"The _Globe_,\" says Colonel Benton, \"was sold and was paid\r\nfor; it was paid for out of public money--the same fifty thousand\r\ndollars which were removed to the village bank at Middletown, in\r\nthe interior of Pennsylvania.  Three annual installments made the\r\npayment, and the Treasury did not reclaim the money for three\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe first congressional assembly attended by President Polk was\r\ngraced by the presence of General Felix Grundy McConnell, of Alabama,\r\nwho appeared arrayed in a blue swallow-tailed coat, light cassimere\r\npantaloons, and a scarlet waistcoat.  His female acquaintances at\r\nWashington not being very numerous, he had invited to accompany\r\nhim two good-looking French milliner girls from a shop in the lower\r\nstory of the house in which he boarded.  The young women were\r\ndressed as near to the Parisian style of ball dress as their means\r\nwould permit, and the trio attracted much attention as they promenaded\r\nthe hall.  When the President arrived, the General marched directly\r\nto him, and exclaimed in his stentorian voice:  \"Mr. Polk, allow\r\nme the honor of introducing to you my beautiful young friend,\r\nMamselle--Mamselle--Mamselle--_parley vous Francais_--whose name\r\nI have forgotten!\"  Then, turning to the other lady, he asked,\r\n\"Will you introduce your friend?\"  The President, seeing General\r\nMac's embarrassment, relived him by shaking hands cordially with\r\neach of the young ladies.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  James K. Polk\r\nJAMES KNOX POLK was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina,\r\nNovember 2d, 1795; was a Representative in Congress from Tennessee,\r\n1825-1839; was Governor of Tennessee, 1839; was President of the\r\nUnited States, 1845-1849, and died at Nashville, Tennessee, June\r\n15th, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nDEATH OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis was not very gay during the latter portion of Mr.\r\nPolk's Administration.  There were the usual receptions at the\r\nWhite House, and at several of the foreign legations the allowance\r\nof \"table money\" was judiciously expended, but there were not many\r\nlarge evening parties or balls.  One notable social event was the\r\nmarriage of Colonel Benton's daughter Sarah to Mr. Jacob, of\r\nLouisville.  The bridegroom's family was related to the Taylors\r\nand the Clays, so Henry Clay, who had been re-elected to the Senate,\r\nwas present, and escorted the bride to the supper-table.  There\r\nwas a large attendance of Congressmen, diplomats, and officials,\r\nbut the absence of officers of the army and navy, generally so\r\nprominent at a Washington entertainment, was noticeable.  They were\r\nin Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting entertainment was given by Colonel Seaton, at\r\nhis mansion on E Street, to the Whig members of Congress and the\r\njournalists.  The first homage of nearly all, as they entered, was\r\npaid to John Quincy Adams, who sat upon a sofa, his form slightly\r\nbowed by time, his eyes weeping, and a calm seriousness in his\r\nexpression.  Daniel Webster was not present, having that day received\r\nintelligence of the death of his son Edward, who was major of a\r\nMassachusetts regiment, and died in Mexico of camp-fever.  Henry\r\nClay, however, was there, with kind words and pleasant smiles for\r\nall his friends.  Crittenden, Corwin, and other Whig Senatorial\r\npaladins were present, and Mr. Speaker Winthrop, that perfect\r\ngentleman and able presiding officer, headed a host of talented\r\nRepresentatives.  Commodore Stockton and General Jones represented\r\nthe Army and Navy, while Erastus Brooks and Charles Lanman appeared\r\nfor the press.  There was a sumptuous collation, with much drinking\r\nof healths and many pledges to the success of the Whig cause.\r\n\r\nThe reunion at Colonel Seaton's was on Friday night, February 18th,\r\n1848.  The following Sunday John Quincy Adams attended public\r\nworship at the Capitol, and on Monday, the 21st, he was, as usual,\r\nin his seat when the House was called to order.  During the\r\npreliminary business he was engaged in copying a poetical invocation\r\nto the muse of history for one of the officials, and he appeared\r\nto be in ordinarily good health.  A resolve of thanks to the generals\r\nof the Mexican War came up, and the clerk had read, \"Resolved by\r\nthe House that\"--when he was arrested by the cry of \"Look to Mr.\r\nAdams!\"  Mr. David Fisher, of Ohio, who occupied the desk on Mr.\r\nAdams' right, saw him rise as if he intended to speak; then clutch\r\nhis desk with a convulsive effort, and sink back into his chair.\r\nMr. Fisher caught him in his arms, and in an instant Dr. Fries and\r\nDr. Nes, both members, were at his side.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn moment, for a cry went from more than one, \"Mr.\r\nAdams is dying!\"  It was thought that, like Pitt, he would give up\r\nthe ghost \"with harness on,\" on the spot which his eloquence had\r\nhallowed.  \"Stand back!\"  \"Give him air!\"  \"Remove him!\"  Every\r\none seemed panic-stricken except Mr. Speaker Winthrop, who quietly\r\nadjourned the House, and had his insensible colleague removed on\r\na sofa--first into the rotunda, and then into the Speaker's room.\r\nCupping, mustard poultices, and friction were resorted to, and\r\nabout an hour after his attack Mr. Adams said, \"This is the last\r\nof earth, but I am content.\"  He then fell into a deep slumber,\r\nfrom which he never awoke.  Mrs. Adams and other relatives were\r\nwith him, and among the visitors was Henry Clay, who stood for some\r\ntime with the old patriarch's hand clasped in his, and gazed intently\r\non the calm but vacant countenance, his own eyes filled with tears.\r\nMr. Adams lingered until the evening of the 23d of February, when\r\nhe breathed his last.  The funeral services were very imposing,\r\nand a committee of one from each State accompanied the remains to\r\nBoston, where they lay in state at Faneuil Hall, and were then\r\ntaken to Quincy for interment.  The Committee returned to Washington\r\nenthusiastic over the hospitalities extended to them while they\r\nwere in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was a member of the last Congress during the Polk\r\nAdministration.  He made no mark as a legislator, but he established\r\nhis reputation as a story-teller, and he was to be found every\r\nmorning in the post-office of the House charming a small audience\r\nwith his quaint anecdotes.  Among other incidents of his own life\r\nwhich he used to narrate was his military service in the Black Hawk\r\nWar, when he was a captain of volunteers.  He was mustered into\r\nservice by Jefferson Davis, then a lieutenant of dragoons, stationed\r\nat Fort Dixon, which was near the present town of Dixon, Illinois,\r\nand was under the command of Colonel Zachary Taylor.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nserved only one term, and before its expiration he began to take\r\nsteps for appointment as Commissioner of the General Land-office,\r\ntwo years afterward, should the Whigs then come into power.  A\r\nnumber of prominent Whig Senators and Representatives indorsed his\r\napplication, but he was not successful.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis was a Representative from Mississippi until he\r\nresigned to accept the command of a regiment of riflemen, with\r\nwhich he rendered gallant services at Buena Vista, under his father-\r\nin-law, General Taylor, with whom he was not at that time on speaking\r\nterms.  In appearance his erect bearing recalled his service as an\r\nofficer of dragoons, while his square shoulders and muscular frame\r\ngave proof of a training at West Point.  His high forehead was\r\nshaded by masses of dark hair, in which the silvery threads began\r\nto show; his eyes were a bluish-gray, his cheekbones prominent,\r\nhis nose aquiline, and he had a large, expressive mouth.  He was\r\nan ardent supporter of State sovereignty and Southern rights, and\r\nhe was very severe on those Congressmen from the slave-holding\r\nStates, who were advocates of the Union, especially Mr. A. H.\r\nStephens, whom he denounced as \"the little pale star from Georgia.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic National Convention met at Baltimore on the 22d of\r\nMay, 1848.  There was a prolonged contest over the rival claims of\r\ndelegates from New York, terminated by the admission of the \"hards.\"\r\nGeneral James M. Commander, the solitary delegate from South\r\nCarolina, was authorized to cast the nine votes of that State.\r\nThe two-thirds rule was adopted, and on the fourth day of the\r\nconvention, Lewis Cass, of Michigan, was nominated on the fourth\r\nballot, defeating James Buchanan and Levi Woodbury.  Having nominated\r\na Northern candidate, a Southern platform was adopted, which covered\r\nthe entire ground of non-interference with the rights of slave-\r\nholders, either in the States or Territories.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass was then in the sixty-sixth year of his age, and had\r\npassed forty years in the public service.  His knowledge was ample\r\nbut not profound.  He was ignorant on no subject, and was deeply\r\nversed on none.  The world to him was but a playhouse, and that\r\ndrama with him was best which was best performed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Whig National Convention met at Philadelphia, on the 7th\r\nof June, there was a bitter feeling between the respective friends\r\nof Webster and Clay, but they were all doomed to disappointment.\r\nThe Northern delegates to the Whig National Convention might have\r\nnominated either Webster, Clay, Scott, or Corwin, as they had a\r\nmajority of fifty-six over the delegates from the Southern States,\r\nand cast twenty-nine votes more than was necessary to choose a\r\ncandidate.  But they refused to unite on any one, and on the fourth\r\nballot sixty-nine of them voted with the Southern Whigs and secured\r\nthe nomination of Zachary Taylor.  While the friends of Mr. Clay\r\nmade a desperate rally in his behalf, knowing that it was his last\r\nchance, some of those who had smarted under the lash which he\r\nwielded so unsparingly in the Senate rejoiced over his defeat.\r\n\"Thank Providence!\" exclaimed ex-Senator Archer, of Virginia, \"we\r\nhave got rid of the old tyrant at last.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Whig National Convention had adjourned without passing a\r\nsingle declaration of the party's principles, General Taylor's\r\nletter of acceptance was awaited with intense interest.  It was\r\nbelieved that he would outline some policy which would be accepted\r\nand which would unite the Whig party.  A month elapsed, and no\r\nletter of acceptance was received by Governor Morehead, who had\r\npresided over the Convention, but the Postmaster at Baton Rouge,\r\nwhere General Taylor lived, addressed the Postmaster-General a\r\nletter, saying that with the report for the current quarter from\r\nthat office, two bundles of letters were forwarded for the Dead-\r\nLetter Office, they having been declined on account of the non-\r\npayment of the postage by the senders.  It was in the ten-cent and\r\nnon-prepayment time.  Of the forty-eight letters thus forwarded to\r\nthe Dead-Letter Office, the Baton Rouge Postmaster said a majority\r\nwere addressed to General Taylor, who had declined to pay the\r\npostage on them and take them out of the office, because his mail\r\nexpenses had become burdensome.  The General had since become aware\r\nthat some of the letters were of importance, and asked for their\r\nreturn.  In due course, the letters were sent back to Baton Rouge,\r\nand among them was Governor Morehead's letter notifying the General\r\nof the action of the Philadelphia Convention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor's letter of acceptance was thus dated a month and\r\nfive days after the letter of notification had been written.  It\r\nwas \"short and sweet.\"  He expressed his thanks for the nomination,\r\nsaid he did not seek it, and that he were elected President, for\r\nwhich position he did not think he possessed the requisite\r\nqualifications, he would do his best.  He discussed nothing, laid\r\ndown no principles, and gave no indications of the course he would\r\npursue.  Thurlow Weed was not satisfied with this letter, and sent\r\nthe draft of another one, more explicit, and indorsed by Mr.\r\nFillmore.  This General Taylor had copied, and signed it as a letter\r\naddressed to his kinsman, Captain Allison.  In it he pledged himself\r\nfully to Whig principles, and it was made the basis of an effective\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, who at first denounced the nomination as one \"not fit\r\nto be made,\" was induced, by the payment of a considerable sum of\r\nmoney, to make a speech in favor of the ticket.  Nathaniel P. Willis\r\nwrote a stirring campaign song, and at the request of Thurlow Weed,\r\nthe writer of these reminiscences wrote a campaign life of the\r\nGeneral, large editions of which were published at Boston and at\r\nAlbany for gratuitous distribution.  It ignored the General's views\r\non the anti-slavery question.  Meanwhile, the Massachusetts\r\nAbolitionists and ultra-Webster men, with the Barn-burner wing of\r\nthe Democratic party in New York, and several other disaffected\r\nfactions, met in convention at Buffalo.  They there nominated Martin\r\nVan Buren for President and Mr. Charles Francis Adams for Vice-\r\nPresident, and adopted as a motto, \"Free Speech, Free Soil, Free\r\nLabor, and Free Men.\"  This party attracted enough votes from the\r\nDemocratic ticket in the State of New York to secure the triumph\r\nof the Whigs, and Martin Van Buren, who had been defeated by the\r\nSouthern Democrats, had in return the satisfaction of effecting\r\ntheir defeat.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun, soured by his successive failures, but not instructed\r\nby them, sought revenge.  \"The last days of Mr. Polk's Administration,\"\r\nsays Colonel Benton, \"were witness to an ominous movement, nothing\r\nless than nightly meetings of large numbers of members from the\r\nslave States to consider the state of things between the North and\r\nthe South, to show the aggressions and encroachments (as they were\r\ncalled) of the former upon the latter, to show the incompatibility\r\nof their union, and to devise measures for the defense and protection\r\nof the South.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  H. S. Foote\r\nHENRY STUART FOOTE was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, September\r\n20th, 1800; commenced the practice of law at Tuscumbia, Alabama,\r\nand removed to Mississippi; was United States Senator, 1847-1852;\r\nwas Governor of Mississippi, 1852-1854, and died May 29th, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nMAKING THE MOST OF POWER.\r\n\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor was, of all who have filled the Presidential\r\nchair by the choice of the people, the man least competent to\r\nperform its duties.  He had been placed before his countrymen as\r\na candidate in spite of his repeated avowals of incapacity,\r\ninexperience, and repugnance to all civil duties.  Although sixty-\r\nfour years of age, he had never exercised the right of suffrage,\r\nand he was well aware that he was elected solely because of his\r\nmilitary prowess.  But no sooner did he learn that he had been\r\nchosen President than he displayed the same invincible courage,\r\npractical sense, and indomitable energy in the discharge of his\r\nnew and arduous civil duties which had characterized his military\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect was fortunate in having as a companion, counselor,\r\nand friend Colonel William Wallace Bliss, who had served as his\r\nchief of staff in the Mexican campaign, and who became the husband\r\nof his favorite daughter, Miss Betty.  Colonel Bliss was the son\r\nof Captain Bliss, of the regular army, and after having been reared\r\nin the State of New York he was graduated at West Point, where he\r\nserved afterward as acting professor of mathematics.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Washington from his Louisiana plantation, General\r\nTaylor visited Frankfort, and personally invited Mr. John J.\r\nCrittenden, then Governor of Kentucky, to become his Secretary of\r\nState.  Governor Crittenden declined, and General Taylor then\r\ntelegraphed to Mr. John M. Clayton, of Delaware, tendering him the\r\nposition, which that gentleman promptly accepted.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbott Lawrence, of Boston, solicited the appointment of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and was offered the Navy Department,\r\nwhich he declined.  Mr. Robert Toombs, supported by Representative\r\nStephens and Senator Dawson, succeeded in having Mr. George W.\r\nCrawford, of Georgia, appointed Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMr. William M. Meredith, of Pennsylvania, was rather forced upon\r\nGeneral Taylor as Secretary of the Treasury by Mr. Clayton and\r\nother Whigs, partly on account of his acknowledged talents, but\r\nchiefly to exclude objectionable Pennsylvanians, among them Mr.\r\nJosiah Randall, who, more than any other, had contributed to the\r\nnomination and election of the General.  A contest between Messrs.\r\nCorwin and Vinton, of Ohio, for a seat in the Cabinet was settled\r\nby the appointment of Mr. Thomas Ewing, of that State, as Secretary\r\nof the Interior.  Mr. Jacob Collamer, of Vermont, who had been an\r\nunsuccessful competitor with Mr. Upham for a seat in the Senate,\r\nand had been recommended by the Legislature of his state as Attorney-\r\nGeneral, was made Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor came to Washington impressed with the idea that he\r\nwas politically indebted to George Lunt, of Massachusetts, and\r\nWilliam Ballard Preston, of Virginia.  He appointed Mr. Lunt District\r\nAttorney for the district of Massachusetts, and it was soon understood\r\nthat he proposed to invite Mr. Preston to a seat in his Cabinet as\r\nAttorney-General.  The Whig Senators remonstrated, urging Preston's\r\nlack of great legal ability and learning, but all to no purpose.\r\nFinally Senator Archer, of Virginia, called and asked if there was\r\nany foundation for the report that his friend Preston was to be\r\nmade Attorney-General.  \"Yes!\" answered General Taylor, \"I have\r\ndetermined on that appointment.\"  \"Are you aware, General,\" said\r\nthe Senator, \"that the Attorney-General must represent the Government\r\nin the Supreme Court?\"  \"Of course!\" responded the General.  \"But\r\ndid you know that he must there meet Daniel Webster, Reverdy Johnson,\r\nand other leading lawyers?\"  \"Certainly.  What of it?\"  \"Nothing,\r\nGeneral, except that they will make a blank fool of your Attorney-\r\nGeneral.\"  The Virginia Senator then took his leave, and the next\r\nmorning's papers contained the announcement that the President had\r\ndecided to appoint Mr. Preston Secretary of the Navy, and Mr.\r\nReverdy Johnson Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nMrs. Taylor regretted the election of her husband, and came to\r\nWashington with a heavy heart.  She was a native of Calvert County,\r\nMaryland, and was born on the estate where the father of Mrs. John\r\nQuincy Adams had formerly resided.  Her father, Mr. Walter Smith,\r\nwas a highly respectable farmer, and her brother, Major Richard\r\nSmith, of the Marine Corps, was well remembered at Washington for\r\nhis gallant bearing and his social qualities.  The eldest daughter\r\nof General Taylor had married Mr. Jefferson Davis.  A second daughter\r\nwas the wife of Dr. Wood, of the army, who was at that time stationed\r\nat Baltimore, as was General Taylor's brother, Colonel Taylor.\r\nMrs. Taylor, with her younger daughter, Mrs. Bliss, went directly\r\nfrom Louisiana to Baltimore some weeks prior to the inauguration.\r\nThey broke up housekeeping at Baton Rouge, and took with them\r\nWilliam Oldham, a faithful colored man, who had been the body-\r\nservant of General Taylor for many years, the parade horse, \"Old\r\nWhitey,\" which he had ridden in the Mexican campaign, and a favorite\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor was inaugurated on Monday, March 5th.  He was escorted\r\nfrom Willard's Hotel by an imposing procession, headed by twelve\r\nvolunteer companies.  The President-elect rode in an open carriage\r\ndrawn by four gray horses, and he was joined at the Irving House\r\nby President Polk, who sat at his right hand.  One hundred young\r\ngentlemen, residents of the District of Columbia, mounted on spirited\r\nhorses, formed a body-guard, and kept the crowd from pressing around\r\nthe President's carriage.  Then came the \"Rough-and-Ready\" clubs\r\nof Washington, Georgetown, Alexandria, and Baltimore, with banners,\r\nbadges, and music, while the students of the Georgetown College\r\nbrought up the rear.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of General Taylor as he read his inaugural\r\naddress from a platform erected in front of the eastern portico of\r\nthe Capitol was not imposing.  His figure was somewhat portly, and\r\nhis legs were short; his thin, gray hair was unbrushed; his whiskers\r\nwere of the military cut then prescribed; his features were weather-\r\nbronzed and care-furrowed; and he read almost inaudibly.  It was\r\nevident, however, that he was a popular favorite, and when he had\r\nconcluded the vociferous cheering of the assembled thousands was\r\nanswered by the firing of cannon and the music of the bands.  His\r\npraises were on all lips, and his soubriquets of \"Rough and Ready\"\r\nand \"Old Zach.\" were sounded with all honor.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural message showed that General Taylor regarded the Union\r\nas in danger, and that he intended to use every possible exertion\r\nfor its preservation.  Mr. Calhoun had requested, through Mr.\r\nClayton, that nothing should be said in the inaugural on this\r\nsubject, which had prompted the addition of a paragraph, in which\r\nthe incoming President declared that a dissolution of the Union\r\nwould be the greatest of calamities, and went on to say:  \"Whatever\r\ndangers may threaten it, I shall stand by it, and maintain it in\r\nits integrity, to the full extent of the obligations imposed and\r\nthe power conferred upon me by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1849, when Congress assembled, the President aroused\r\nthe violent opposition of Southern members by recommending, in his\r\nmessage, that California be admitted as a free State, and that the\r\nremaining Territories be allowed to form Constitutions to suit\r\nthemselves.  So indignant were some of the Southerners that the\r\ndissolution of the Union was openly threatened.  To allay this\r\nagitation Clay's compromise measures were proposed, but Taylor did\r\nnot live to see the bill passed.\r\n\r\nThe horde of office-seekers which invaded Washington after the\r\ninauguration of President Taylor recalled the saying of John\r\nRandolph, when it was asserted that the patronage of the Federal\r\nGovernment was overrated:  \"I know,\" said the sarcastic Virginian,\r\n\"that it may be overrated; I know that we cannot give to those who\r\napply offices equal to their expectations; and I also know that\r\nwith one bone I can call five hundred dogs.\"  The Democratic motto,\r\nthat \"To the victors belong the spoils,\" was adopted by the Taylor\r\nAdministration.  Unexceptionable men were removed from office, that\r\ntheir places might be filled with officers of Rough and Ready clubs\r\nor partisan orators.  Veterans like General Armstrong and even the\r\ngifted Hawthorne, were \"rotated\" without mercy from the offices\r\nwhich they held.  In the Post-Office Department alone, where Mr.\r\nFitz Henry Warren, as Assistant Postmaster-General, worked the\r\npolitical guillotine, there were three thousand four hundred and\r\nsix removals during the first year of the Taylor Administration,\r\nbesides many hundred clerks and employees in the post-offices of\r\nthe larger cities.\r\n\r\nIn the dispensation of \"patronage\" there was a display of shameless\r\nnepotism.  A brother-in-law of Senator Webster was made Navy Agent\r\nat New York.  Sons of Senators Crittenden, Clay, and Davis received\r\nimportant appointments abroad, and the son-in-law of Senator Calhoun\r\nwas retained in the diplomatic service.  Two sons-in-law of Senator\r\nBenton were offered high places.  A nephew of Senator Truman Smith\r\nwas made one of the United States Judges in Minnesota, and a nephew\r\nof Secretary Clayton was made purser at the Washington Navy Yard.\r\nThe assurance of the President that he had \"no friends to reward\"\r\nwas apparently forgotten, and he was hedged in by a little circle\r\nof executive councilors, who ruled all things.\r\n\r\nWhile the Administration was profligate in this abuse of patronage,\r\nthe conduct of several of the Secretaries was such as to give the\r\nPresident great uneasiness as he became acquainted with what was\r\ngoing on.  Old claims were revived, approved by the Secretaries,\r\nand paid.  Prominent among them was the Galphin claim, the Chickasaw\r\nclaim, the De la Francia claim, the Gardiner claim, and many others.\r\nFrom the Galphin claim Mr. Crawford, Secretary of War, received as\r\nhis share one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars.  The lawyers\r\nin Congress declared that the Secretary acted professionally, but\r\nothers censured him severely.  Judge Cartter, then a Representative\r\nfrom Ohio, was severe in his comments on the monstrous corruption\r\nof the allowance of interest, the payment of which he said that he\r\ndisliked \"both as an exaction of the part of the capitalists, and\r\non account of its origin with the Jews, who killed the Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Taylor, although a Southerner by birth and a slave-owner,\r\ntook prompt steps to thwart the schemes of Mr. Calhoun and his\r\nfellow-conspirators.  Military officers were ordered to California,\r\nUtah, and New Mexico, which had no governments but lynch law; and\r\nthe people of the last-named province, which had been settled two\r\nhundred years before Texas asserted her independence, were assured\r\nthat her domain would be guaranteed by the United States against\r\nthe claim of the Lone Star State.\r\n\r\nSocially, President Taylor enjoyed himself, and he used to take\r\nmorning walks through the streets of Washington, wearing a high\r\nblack silk hat perched on the back of his head, and a suit of black\r\nbroadcloth, much too large for him, but made in obedience to his\r\norders, that he might be comfortable.  Mrs. Taylor used to sit\r\npatiently all day in her room, plying her knitting-needles, and\r\noccasionally, it was said, smoking her pipe.  Mrs. Bliss was an\r\nexcellent housekeeper, and the introduction of gas into the Executive\r\nMansion, with new furniture and carpets, enabled her to give it a\r\nmore creditable appearance.  It was said that she did the honors\r\nof the establishment \"with the artlessness of a rustic belle and\r\nthe grace of a duchess.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor found it difficult to accustom himself to the\r\netiquette and the restraint of his new position.  One day when the\r\nbachelor ex-Secretary of State called with a number of fair\r\nPennsylvania friends to present them to the President, General\r\nTaylor remarked:  \"Ah! Mr. Buchanan, you always pick out the\r\nprettiest ladies!\"  \"Why, Mr. President,\" was the courtly reply,\r\n\"I know that your taste and mine agree in this respect.\"  \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid General Taylor, \"but I have been so long among Indians and\r\nMexicans that I hardly know how to behave myself, surrounded by so\r\nmany lovely women.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  ZTaylor\r\nZACHARY TAYLOR was born in Orange County, Virginia, November 24th,\r\n1784; never cast a vote or held a civil office until he was\r\ninaugurated as President, March 5th, 1849; died at the White House,\r\nafter a few days' illness, July 9th, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE GREAT COMPROMISE DEBATE.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-first Congress, which met on the first Monday in the\r\nDecember following the inauguration of President Taylor, contained\r\nmany able statesmen of national prominence.  The organization of\r\nthe House was a difficult task, nine \"free-soil\" or anti-slavery\r\nWhigs from the North and six \"State-rights\" or pro-slavery Whigs\r\nfrom the South, refusing to vote for that accomplished gentleman,\r\nMr. Robert C. Winthrop, who was the Whig candidate for Speaker.\r\nOn the first ballot, Howell Cobb, of Georgia, had one hundred and\r\nthree votes, against ninety-six votes for Robert C. Winthrop, eight\r\nvotes for David Wilmot, six votes for Meredith P. Gentry, two votes\r\nfor Horace Mann, and a number of scattering votes.  The tellers\r\nannounced that these was no choice, and the balloting was continued\r\nday after day, amid great and increasing excitement.  After the\r\nthirty-ninth ballot, Mr. Winthrop withdrew from the contest,\r\nexpressing his belief that the peace and the safety of the Union\r\ndemanded that an organization of some sort should be effected\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Whigs who had opposed Mr. Winthrop were vehement and\r\npassionate in their denunciation of the North.  \"The time has come,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Toombs, his black, uncombed hair standing out from his\r\nmassive head, as if charged with electricity, his eyes glowing like\r\ncoals of fire, and his sentences rattling forth like volleys of\r\nmusketry--\"the time has come,\" said he, \"when I shall not only\r\nutter my opinions, but make them the basis of my political action\r\nhere.  I do not, then, hesitate to avow before this House and the\r\ncountry, and in the presence of the living God, that if, by your\r\nlegislation, you seek to drive us from the Territories of California\r\nand New Mexico, and to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia,\r\nI am for disunion; and if my physical courage be equal to the\r\nmaintenance of my convictions of right and duty, I will devote all\r\nI am and all I have on earth to its consummation.\"\r\n\r\nSuch inflammatory remarks provoked replies, and after a heated\r\ndebate Mr. Duer, of New York, remarked that he \"would never, under\r\nany circumstances, vote to put a man in the Speaker's chair who\r\nwould, in any event, advocate or sanction a dissolution of the\r\nUnion.\"  This brought a dozen Southerners to their feet, with angry\r\nexclamations, and Mr. Bayly, of Virginia, who was near Mr. Duer,\r\nsaid \"There are no disunionists.\"  \"There are!\" exclaimed Mr. Duer.\r\n\"Name one!\" shouted Mr. Bayly.  At that moment Mr. Meade, of\r\nVirginia, rose and passed directly before Mr. Duer, who pointed to\r\nhim and shouted, \"There's one!\"  \"It is false!\" replied Mr. Meade,\r\nangrily.  \"You lie, sir!\" responded Mr. Duer, in tones which rang\r\nthrough the hall; and, drawing himself up, he stood unmoved, while\r\nhis political friends and foes clustered angrily about him, every\r\nman of them talking and gesticulating most furiously.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Nathan Sergeant (known as a newspaper correspondent\r\nover the signature of Oliver Oldschool), who was the Sergeant-at-\r\nArms of the House, was in his seat at the Speaker's right hand.\r\nSeizing the \"mace,\" which represents the Roman fasces, or bundle\r\nof rods, bound by silver bands and surmounted by an eagle with\r\noutstretched wings, which is the symbol of the authority of the\r\nHouse, he hastened to Mr. Duer and stood at his side, as if to\r\nprotect him.  His official interposition was immediately respected\r\nby all concerned in the disorder, and even the most tumultuous\r\nbegan at once to subside, so that no forcible measures were needed\r\nto prevent further violence.\r\n\r\nQuiet was restored, and the excited Representatives, one by one,\r\nobeyed the sharp raps of the Speaker's gavel, accompanied by the\r\nperemptory order, \"Gentlemen will take their seats.\"  Mr. Duer,\r\nwho had recovered his usual composure, then addressed the Chair,\r\nand having been recognized, apologized to the House for having been\r\nprovoked into the use of the unparliamentary expression, but\r\njustified himself by referring to a speech which Mr. Meade had just\r\nmade and printed, which contained disunion sentiments.  Mr. Meade\r\npromptly challenged Mr. Duer, who showed no indisposition to fight,\r\nbut with some difficulty friends secured an amicable settlement of\r\nthe quarrel.\r\n\r\nFinally, after three weeks of angry recriminations, it was voted\r\nthat a plurality should elect, and on the sixty-second ballot Mr.\r\nHowell Cobb, of Georgia, having received one hundred and two votes\r\nagainst one hundred votes for Mr. Winthrop, was declared the Speaker\r\nof the House.  He did not have that sense of personal dignity and\r\nimportance which belonged to Sir John Falstaff by reason of his\r\nknighthood, but he displayed the same rich exuberance of animal\r\nenjoyment, the same roguish twinkle of the eye, and the same\r\nindolence which characterized the fat Knight.\r\n\r\nPresident Taylor's first and only message to Congress was transmitted\r\non the Monday following the organization of the House, December\r\n24th, and the printed copies first distributed contained the\r\nsentence, \"We are at peace with all the nations of the world and\r\nthe rest of mankind.\"  A revised edition was soon printed, in which\r\nthe corrected sentence read, \"We are at peace with all the nations\r\nof the world, and seek to maintain our cherished relations of amity\r\nwith them.\"  The blunder caused much diversion among the Democrats,\r\nand greatly annoyed Colonel Bliss, who, as the President's private\r\nsecretary, had superintended the publication of the message.  The\r\nmessage contained no allusion to the slavery question, but the\r\nPresident had declared himself in favor of the untrammeled admission\r\nof California into the Union, while, on the other hand, he did not\r\napprove the \"higher law\" doctrine which Mr. Seward was advocating\r\nas a nucleus for a new political party in the North.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Henry Clay had reappeared at Washington as a Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, and occupied his old quarters at the National Hotel,\r\na large stockholder in which, Mr. Calvert, of Maryland, was one of\r\nClay's many friends.  Although in his seventy-third year, Mr. Clay\r\nwas apparently hale and hearty, but showed his age.  His head, bald\r\non the top, was fringed with long, iron-gray hair, his cheeks were\r\nsomewhat sunken, his nose had a pinched look, but his wide mouth\r\nwas, as in years past, wreathed in genial smiles.  He always was\r\ndressed in black, and from a high black satin stock, which enveloped\r\nhis long neck, emerged a huge white shirt collar, which reached to\r\nhis ears.  He mingled in society, generally kissed the prettiest\r\ngirls wherever he went, and enjoyed a quiet game of cards in his\r\nown room, with a glass of toddy made from Bourbon County whisky.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the session Mr. Clay requested that he might\r\nbe excused from service on any of the standing committees of the\r\nSenate, and his wish was granted.  It was not long, however, before\r\nhe evinced a desire to re-enter the arena of debate as a leader of\r\nthe Whig party, but not as a follower of President Taylor.  Presenting\r\na series of resolutions which would consolidate the settlement of\r\nthe eight different questions involving slavery, then before\r\nCongress, into what he expected would prove a lasting compromise,\r\nhe moved their reference to a select committee of thirteen, with\r\ninstructions to report them in one bill.  The Committee was\r\nauthorized, but not without opposition, and Mr. Webster's vote\r\nsecured for Mr. Clay the chairmanship.  A general compromise bill\r\nwas speedily prepared, and the \"battle of the giants\" was recommenced,\r\nClay, Webster, and Calhoun engaging for the last time in a gladitorial\r\nstrife, which exhibited the off-hand genial eloquence of the\r\nKentuckian, the ponderous strength of the Massachusetts Senator,\r\nand the concentrated energies of South Carolina's favorite son.\r\nMr. Clay was the leader in the debate, which extended over seven\r\nmonths, and during that time he was ever on the alert, sometimes\r\ndelivering a long argument, sometimes eloquently replying to other\r\nSenators, and sometimes suggesting points to some one who was to\r\nspeak on his side.  Indignant at the treatment which he had received\r\nfrom the Whig party he stood unsubdued, and so far from retreating\r\nfrom those who had deserted him, he intended to make the Taylor\r\nAdministration recall its pledges, break its promises, and become\r\nnational, or pro-slavery, Whigs.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was equally grieved and saddened by the faithlessness\r\nof Massachusetts men who had in years past professed friendship\r\nfor him, but of whose machinations against him he had obtained\r\nproof during the preceding autumn.  He also ascertained that, to\r\nuse the words of Mr. Choate, \"the attention of the public mind\r\nbegan to be drawn a little more directly to the great question of\r\nhuman freedom and human slavery.\"  If he responded to the beatings\r\nof the New England heart, and resisted the aggressions and usurpations\r\nof the slave power, he would have to follow the lead of the\r\nAbolitionists, for whom he had always expressed a profound contempt.\r\nDejected and depressed, Mr. Webster would at that time have been\r\nglad to take the mission to England, and thus terminate his career\r\nof public service; but he was defeated by the claims of Mr. Abbott\r\nLawrence, who, having been recently disappointed in not receiving\r\nthe appointment of Secretary of the Treasury, refused to be comforted\r\nunless he could be the successor of George Bancroft at the Court\r\nof St. James.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens and Joshua R. Giddings asserted, after the decease\r\nof Mr. Webster, that he prepared a speech, the manuscript of which\r\nthey had read, which was a powerful exposition and vindication of\r\nNorthern sentiment upon the compromise measures, especially the\r\nfugitive-slave bill.  If this was true, he was doubtless induced\r\nto \"change front\" by pledges of Southern support for the Presidency;\r\nbut he is reported by Theodore Parker as having said to a fellow\r\nSenator, on the morning of the 7th of March, \"I have my doubts that\r\nthe speech I am going to make will ruin me.\"  He should have\r\nremembered that he himself said of the Emperor Napoleon, \"His\r\nvictories and his triumphs crumbled to atoms, and moldered to dry\r\nashes in his grasp, because he violated the general sense of justice\r\nof mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Webster's far-seeing mind was doubtless troubled by\r\nthe prospects of a bloody civil war, with the breaking up of the\r\nUnion he loved so well.  He stood by the old compromises rather\r\nthan bring on a sectional conflict, and in his opinion there was\r\nno sacrifice too great to avert a fratricidal contest.  \"I speak\r\nto-day,\" said he, \"for the preservation of the Union!\"  His words\r\nwere in after years the key-notes of many appeals for the protection\r\nand the preservation of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun's health had gradually failed, and at last he was\r\nsupported into the Senate Chamber wrapped in flannels, like the\r\ngreat Chatham, and requested that his friend, Senator Mason, might\r\nread some remarks which he had prepared.  The request was, of\r\ncourse, granted, and while Mr. Mason read the defiant pronunciamento\r\nits author sat wrapped in his cloak, his eyes glowing with meteor-\r\nlike brilliancy as he glanced at Senators upon whom he desired to\r\nhave certain passages make an impression.  When Mr. Mason had\r\nconcluded, Mr. Calhoun was supported from the Senate and went back\r\nto his lodgings at Mr. Hill's boarding-house, afterward known as\r\nthe Old Capitol, to die.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson Davis aspired to the leadership of the South after\r\nthe death of Mr. Calhoun, and talked openly of disunion.  \"Let the\r\nsections,\" said he, in the Senate Chamber, \"part, like the patriarchs\r\nof old, and let peace and good-will subsist among their descendants.\r\nLet no wound be inflicted which time cannot heal.  Let the flag of\r\nour Union be folded up entire, the thirteen stripes recording the\r\noriginal size of our family, untorn by the unholy struggles of\r\ncivil war, its constellation to remain undimmed, and speaking to\r\nthose who come after us of the growth and prosperity of the family\r\nwhilst it remained united.  Unmutilated, let it lie among the\r\narchives of the Republic, until some future day, when wiser counsels\r\nshall prevail, when men shall have been sobered in the school of\r\nadversity, again to be unfurled over the continent-wide Republic.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Hale, who, with Salmon P. Chase, was not named on any of\r\nthe committees of the Senate, was a constant target for the attacks\r\nof the Southerners, but the keenest shafts of satire made no more\r\nimpression upon him than musket-balls do upon the hide of a\r\nrhinoceros.  One day when Senator Clemens had asserted that the\r\nUnion was virtually dissolved, Mr. Hale said, \"If this is not a\r\nmatter too serious for pleasant illustration, let me give you one.\r\nOnce in my life, in the capacity of Justice of the Peace--for I\r\nheld that office before I was Senator--I was called on to officiate\r\nin uniting a couple in the bonds of matrimony.  They came up, and\r\nI made short work of it.  I asked the man if he would take the\r\nwoman whom he held by the hand to be his wedded wife; and he replied,\r\n'To be sure I will.  I came here to do that very thing.'  I then\r\nput the question to the lady whether she would have the man for\r\nher husband.  And when she answered in the affirmative, I told them\r\nthey were man and wife then.  She looked up with apparent astonishment\r\nand inquired, 'Is that all?'  'Yes,' said I, 'that is all.'  'Well,'\r\nsaid she, 'it is not such a mighty affair as I expected it to be,\r\nafter all!'  If this Union is already dissolved, it has produced\r\nless commotion in the act than I expected.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Robt. C. Winthrop\r\nROBERT CHARLES WINTHROP was born at Boston, Massachusetts, May\r\n12th, 1809; was a Representative in Congress from Massachusetts\r\nfrom December 5th, 1842, to July 30th, 1850, when, having been\r\nappointed a United States Senator from Massachusetts, he took his\r\nseat in the Senate, serving until February 7th, 1851; was Speaker\r\nof the House during the Thirtieth Congress, and a part of the Thirty-\r\nfirst Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nPROMINENT STATESMEN AND DIPLOMATS.\r\n\r\nA prominent figure at Washington during the Taylor Administration\r\nwas General Sam Houston, a large, imposing-looking man, who generally\r\nwore a waistcoat made from the skin of a panther, dressed with the\r\nhair on, and who generally occupied himself during the sessions of\r\nthe Senate in whittling small sticks of soft pine wood, which the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms provided for him.  His life had been one of romantic\r\nadventure.  After having served with distinction under General\r\nJackson in the Creek War, he had become a lawyer, and then Governor\r\nof the State of Tennessee.  Soon after his inauguration he had\r\nmarried an accomplished young lady, to whom he one day intimated,\r\nin jest, that she apparently cared more for a former lover than\r\nshe did for him.  \"You are correct,\" said she, earnestly, \"I love\r\nMr. Nickerson's little finger better than I do your whole body.\"\r\nWords ensued, and the next day Houston resigned his Governorship,\r\nwent into the Cherokee country, west of the Arkansas River, adopted\r\nthe Indian costume, and became an Indian trader.  He was the best\r\ncustomer supplied from his own whisky barrel, until one day, after\r\na prolonged debauch, he heard from a Texas Indian that the Mexicans\r\nhad taken up arms against their revolted province.  A friend agreeing\r\nto accompany him, he cast off his Indian attire, again dressing\r\nlike a white man, and never drank a drop of any intoxicating beverage\r\nafterward.  Arriving in Texas at a critical moment, his gallantry\r\nwas soon conspicuous, and in due time he was sent to Washington as\r\nUnited States Senator.  His strong points, however, were more\r\nconspicuous on the field than in the Senate.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward entered the Senate when General Taylor was\r\ninaugurated as President, and soon became the directing spirit of\r\nthe Administration, although Colonel Bullit, who had been brought\r\nfrom Louisiana to edit the _Republic_, President Taylor's recognized\r\norgan, spoke of him only with supercilious contempt.  Senator Foote\r\nsought reputation by insulting him in public, and was himself\r\ntaunted by Mr. Calhoun with the inconsistent fact of intimacy with\r\nhim in private.  The newly elected Senator from New York persisted\r\nin maintaining amicable relations with his revilers, and quietly\r\ncontrolled the immense patronage of his State, none of which was\r\nshared by the friends of Vice-President Fillmore.  He was not at\r\nheart a reformer; he probably cared but little whether the negro\r\nwas a slave or a freeman; but he sought his own political advancement\r\nby advocating in turn anti-Masonry and abolitionism, and by\r\npolitically coquetting with Archbishop Hughes, of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, and Henry Wilson, a leading Know-Nothing.  Personally he\r\nwas honest, but he was always surrounded by intriguers and tricksters,\r\nsome of whose nests he would aid in feathering.  The most unscrupulous\r\nlobbyists that have ever haunted the Capitol were well known as\r\ndevoted adherents of William H. Seward, and he swayed them as a\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nMr. James Buchanan had not shed many tears over the defeat of his\r\nrival, General Cass, and when the Whigs came into power he retired\r\nfrom the Department of State to his rural home, called Wheatland,\r\nnear Lancaster, Pa.  He used to visit Washington frequently, and\r\nwas always welcomed in society, where he made an imposing appearance,\r\nalthough he had the awkward habit of carrying his head slightly to\r\none side, like a poll-parrot.  He always attempted to be facetious,\r\nespecially when conversing with young ladies, but when any political\r\nquestion was discussed in his presence, he was either silent, or\r\nexpressed himself with great circumspection.  From his first entry\r\ninto the House of Representatives, in 1821, he had entertained\r\nPresidential aspirations, and had sought to cultivate friendships\r\nthat would be of service to him in obtaining the object of his\r\nambition, protesting all the while that he was indifferent on the\r\nsubject.  After his retreat to Wheatland he began to secure strength\r\nfor the coming National Democratic Convention of 1851, industriously\r\ncorresponding with politicians in different sections of the country,\r\nand he was especially attentive to Mr. Henry A. Wise, with whose\r\naid he hoped to secure the votes of the delegates from Virginia in\r\nthe next National Democratic Convention.\r\n\r\nMr. Wise, recalling the time when he was a power behind the throne\r\nof John Tyler, encouraged Mr. Buchanan to bid for Southern support,\r\nand intimated a readiness to \"coach\" him so as to make him a favorite\r\nin the slave States.  His counsels were kindly taken and in return\r\nMr. Buchanan wrote to the fiery \"Lord of Accomac,\" in his most\r\nprecise handwriting:  \"Acquire more character for prudence and\r\nmoderation, and under the blessing of Heaven you may be almost\r\nanything in this country which you desire.  There is no man living\r\nwhose success in public and in private life would afford me more\r\nsincere pleasure than your own.  You have every advantage.  All\r\nyou have to do is to go straight ahead, without unnecessarily\r\ntreading upon other people's toes.  I know you will think, if you\r\ndon't say, 'What impudence it is for this childless old bachelor\r\nof sixty years of age to undertake to give me advice!  Why don't\r\nhe mind his own business?'  General Jackson once told me that he\r\nknew a man in Tennessee who had got rich by minding his own business;\r\nbut still I urged him, and at last with success, which he never\r\nregretted.\"\r\n\r\nThe free distribution of plants and seeds to Congressmen for their\r\nfavored constituents has made it an equally easy matter for the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture to obtain liberal appropriations for\r\nhis Department and the publication of enormous editions of his\r\nReports.  Indeed, the Bureau of Agriculture has grown under these\r\nfostering influences to one of immense magnitude, and its beautiful\r\nbuilding, erected in Lincoln's time, is one of the ornaments of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Agricultural Reports was issued by Edmund Burke,\r\nwhile he was commissioner of Patents during the Polk Administration.\r\nOn the incoming of the Taylor Administration Mr. Burke was succeeded\r\nby Thomas Ewbank, of New York City, and Congress made an appropriation\r\nof three thousand five hundred dollars for the collection of\r\nagricultural statistics.  When Mr. Ewbank's report appeared the\r\nSouthern Congressmen were (to quote the words used by Senator\r\nJefferson Davis, in debate) amazed to find that it was preceded by\r\nwhat he termed \"an introduction by Horace Greeley, a philosopher\r\nand philanthropist of the strong Abolition type.\"  \"The simple\r\nfact,\" he continued, \"that Mr. Greeley was employed to write the\r\nintroduction is sufficient to damn the work with me, and render it\r\nworthless in my estimation.\"  This view was held by many other\r\nSoutherners.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this fierce denunciation, however, the public\r\nappreciated just such work as had been undertaken, and so rapid\r\nwas the growth of interest in this direction that the Department\r\nof Agriculture was fully organized in 1862.  It has continued to\r\nissue immense numbers of Reports, which are standing objects of\r\njest and complaint, but the fact still remains that they contain\r\nsplendid stores of valuable information.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria accredited as her Minister Plenipotentiary to\r\nPresident Tyler the Right Honorable Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, an\r\naccomplished diplomat, slender, and apparently in ill health.  He\r\nwas afterward, for many years, the British Minister at Constantinople,\r\nwhere he defeated the machinations of Russia, and held in cunning\r\nhand the tangled thread of that delicate puzzle, the Eastern\r\nQuestion.  His private secretary while he was at Washington was\r\nhis nephew, Mr. Robert Bulwer (a son of the novelist), who has\r\nsince won renown as Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India, and as the author\r\n--Owen Meredith.\r\n\r\nThe bitter political discussions at the Capitol during the first\r\nsix months of 1850 prevented much social enjoyment.  There were\r\nthe customary receptions at the White House, and \"hops\" at the\r\nhotels, but few large parties were given.  Tea-parties were numerous,\r\nat which a succession of colored waiters carried trays heaped with\r\ndifferent varieties of home-made cakes and tarts, from which the\r\nbeaux supplied the belles, and at the same time ministered to their\r\nown wants, balancing a well-loaded plate on one knee, while they\r\nheld a cup and saucer, replete with fragrant decoctions from the\r\nChinese plant \"which cheers, but not inebriates.\"\r\n\r\nThe reigning belles were the queen-like widow Ashley, of Missouri,\r\nwho afterward married Senator Crittenden, and her beautiful daughter,\r\nwho became the wife of Mr. Cabell, of Florida.  Mrs. Fremont and\r\nher sisters made the home of their father, Colonel Benton, very\r\nattractive; General Cass's daughter, who afterward married the\r\nDutch Minister, had returned from Paris with many rare works of\r\nart, and the proscribed Free-soilers met with a hearty welcome at\r\nthe house of Dr. Bailey, editor of the _New Era_, where Miss Dodge\r\n(Gail Hamilton), passed her first winter in Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 4th of July, 1850, a large reception was\r\ngiven by ex-Speaker Winthrop to his gentlemen friends, without\r\ndistinction of party or locality.  At the supper-table Mr. Winthrop\r\nhad at his right hand Vice-President Fillmore, and at his left hand\r\nMr. Speaker Cobb.  Webster and Foote, Benton and Horace Mann, the\r\nmembers elect from California, with Clingman and Venable, who were\r\ntrying to keep them out, were seen in genial companionship.  Most\r\nof the Cabinet and the President's private secretary, Colonel Bliss,\r\nwere there, side by side with those who proposed to impeach them.\r\nThe only drawback to the general enjoyment of the occasion was the\r\nunderstanding that it was the farewell entertainment of Mr. Winthrop,\r\nwho had given so many evidences of his unselfish patriotism and\r\neminent ability, and whose large experience in public affairs should\r\nhave entitled him to the continued confidence of the people of\r\nMassachusetts.  President Taylor was absent, and Colonel Bliss\r\napologized for his non-attendance, saying that he was somewhat\r\nindisposed.\r\n\r\nThe old hero had that day sat in the sun at the Washington Monument\r\nduring a long spread-eagle address by Senator Foote, with a tedious\r\nsupplementary harangue by George Washington Parke Custis.  While\r\nthus exposed to the midsummer heat for nearly three hours, he had\r\ndrank freely of ice-water, and on his return to the White House he\r\nhad found a basket of cherries, of which he partook heartily,\r\ndrinking at the same time several goblets of iced milk.  After\r\ndinner he still further feasted on cherries and iced milk against\r\nthe protestations of Dr. Witherspoon, who was his guest.  When it\r\nwas time to go to Mr. Winthrop's he felt ill, and soon afterward\r\nhe was seized with a violent attack of cholera morbus.  This was\r\non Thursday, but he did not consider himself dangerously ill until\r\nSunday, when he said to his physician, \"In two days I shall be a\r\ndead man.\"  Eminent physicians were called in, but they could not\r\narrest the bilious fever which supervened.  His mind was clear,\r\nand on Tuesday morning he said to one of the physicians at his\r\nbedside, \"You have fought a good fight, but you cannot make a\r\nstand.\"  Soon afterward he murmured, \"I have endeavored to do my\r\nduty,\" and peacefully breathed his last.  His sudden death was\r\nimmediately announced by the tolling of the bell in the Department\r\nof State, and in a few moments the funereal knell was echoed from\r\nevery church steeple in the district.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  William H. Seward\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD was born at Florida, New York, May 16th, 1801;\r\nwas Governor of New York, 1838-1842; was United States Senator from\r\nNew York from March 4th, 1849, until he entered the Cabinet of\r\nPresident Lincoln as Secretary of State, March 5th, 1861; remained\r\nSecretary of State under President Johnson until March 3d, 1869;\r\ntraveled around the world in 1870-1871, and died at Auburn, New\r\nYork, October 10th, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nFILLMORE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of July, 1850, the day after the death of General\r\nTaylor, Mr. Fillmore appeared in the Representatives' Hall at the\r\nCapitol, where both houses of Congress had met in joint session,\r\ntook the oath of office, and immediately left.  The new President\r\nwas then fifty years of age, of average height, florid features,\r\nwhite hair, shrewd, gray eyes, and dignified yet courteous manners.\r\nHe had risen from the humble walks of life, by incessant toil, to\r\nthe highest position in the Republic.  Always animated by an\r\nindomitable spirit and by that industry and perseverance which are\r\nthe sure guarantees of success, he was undoubtedly a man of ability,\r\nbut his intellect seemed, like that of Lord Bacon, to lack to\r\ncomplement of heart.  A blank in his nature, where loyalty to the\r\npublic sentiment of the North should have been, made him a willing\r\ninstrument to crush out the growing determination north of Mason\r\nand Dixon's line that freedom should be national, slavery sectional.\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore had given satisfaction to the Senators by the impartial\r\nmanner in which he had presided as Vice-President over their\r\ndeliberations.  They had, by a unanimous vote, approved of his\r\nruling, which reversed the decision of Mr. Calhoun, twenty-three\r\nyears before, that the Vice-President had no right to call a Senator\r\nto order for words spoken in debate, and they had ordered his\r\nexplanatory remarks to be entered upon the journal.  By Mr. Seward\r\nand Mr. Weed, however, he was treated with marked contempt, and\r\nunder their direction the Taylor Administration had given him the\r\ncold shoulder.  Even his requests that two of his personal friends\r\nshould be appointed Collector of the Port and Postmaster at Buffalo\r\nhad been formally refused, and the places had been given to partisans\r\nof Mr. Seward.  The unexpected death of General Taylor was an\r\nelement which even Mr. Seward had never taken into account, and\r\nthe first consequence was undisguised confusion among the supporters\r\nof the Administration.  The members of the Cabinet promptly tendered\r\ntheir resignations, and it was plainly visible that the sudden\r\nremoval of the President had checkmated the plans so carefully\r\nmade, and forced the chief player to feel the bitterness of political\r\ndeath.  Mr. Fillmore was known to be amiable in private life, but\r\nit was evident that he would show little regard for those who had\r\nsnubbed and slighted him in his less powerful position.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the deceased President lay in state for several days\r\nin the East Room at the White house, and were then interred with\r\ngreat pomp.  Religious services were held at the White House, where\r\nthe distinguished men of the nation were grouped around the coffin.\r\nAt the funeral there was a large military escort of regulars and\r\nvolunteers, commanded by General Scott, who was mounted on a spirited\r\nhorse and wore a richly embroidered uniform, with a high chapeau\r\ncrowned with yellow plumes.  The ponderous funeral car was drawn\r\nby eight white horses.  Behind the car was led \"Old Whitey,\" the\r\ncharger ridden by General Taylor in Mexico.  He was a well-made\r\nhorse, in good condition, and with head erect, as if inspired by\r\nthe clang of martial music, he followed to the grave the remains\r\nof him whom he had so often borne to victory.  When the artillery\r\nand infantry fired the parting salute at the cemetery, the old war-\r\nhorse pricked up his ears and looked around for his rider.\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore tendered the Secretary of State's portfolio to Mr.\r\nWebster, who promptly accepted it.  He had been assured that if he\r\nwould advocate the compromises he would create a wave of popular\r\nsentiment that would float him into the White House in 1856, against\r\nall opposition, and that no Democratic aspirant would stand in his\r\nway.  Believing all this, Mr. Webster had committed himself in his\r\n7th of March speech, and had found that many of his life-long\r\nfriends and constituents refused to follow his lead.  Faneuil Hall\r\nhad been closed to him, and he was glad to escape from the Senate\r\nChamber into the Department of State.  Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, and Martin Van Buren had found that Department\r\na convenient stepping-stone to the Presidential chair, and why\r\nshould not he?\r\n\r\nMr. Webster was a great favorite in the Department of State, for\r\nhe made no removals, and his generous and considerate treatment of\r\nthe clerks won their affection.  His especial favorite was Mr.\r\nGeorge J. Abbott, a native of New Hampshire, who had been graduated\r\nat Exeter and Cambridge, and had then come to Washington to take\r\ncharge of a boys' school.  He was an accomplished classical scholar,\r\nand he used to hunt up Latin quotations applicable to the questions\r\nof the day, which Mr. Webster would commit to memory and use with\r\neffect.  His private secretary was Mr. Charles Lanman, a young\r\ngentleman of literary and artistic tastes, who was a devoted disciple\r\nof Isaak Walton.  Mr. Webster and he would often leave the Department\r\nof State for a day of piscatorial enjoyment at the Great Falls of\r\nthe Potomac, when the Secretary would throw off public cares and\r\npersonal pecuniary troubles to cast his lines with boyish glee,\r\nand to exult loudly when he succeeded in hooking a fish.  Another\r\nclerk in the Department who enjoyed Mr. Webster's esteem was Mr.\r\nZantzinger, the son of a purser in the Navy, who possessed rare\r\naccomplishments.  Whenever Mr. Webster visited his estates in New\r\nHampshire or Massachusetts, he was accompanied by one of these\r\ngentlemen, who had the charge of his correspondence, and who, while\r\nenjoying his fullest confidence, contributed largely to his personal\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's Washington home was a two-story brick house on\r\nLouisiana Avenue, next to the Unitarian Church.  His dining-room\r\nwas in the basement story, and it was seldom that he had not friends\r\nat his hospitable table.  Monica, the old colored woman, continued\r\nto be his favorite cook, and her soft-shell crabs, terrapin, fried\r\noysters, and roasted canvas-back ducks have never been surpassed\r\nat Washington, while she could make a regal Cape Cod chowder, or\r\nroast a Rhode Island turkey, or prepare the old-fashioned New\r\nHampshire \"boiled dinner,\" which the \"expounder of the Constitution\"\r\nloved so well.  Whenever he had to work at night, she used to make\r\nhim a cup of tea in an old britannia metal teapot, which had been\r\nhis mother's and he used to call this beverage his \"Ethiopian\r\nnectar.\"  The teapot was purchased of Monica after Mr. Webster's\r\ndeath by Henry A. Willard, Esq., of Washington, who presented it\r\nto the Continental Museum at Indian Hill Farm, the author's\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the new Administration, Congress passed the\r\nseveral compromise measures in Mr. Clay's bill as separate acts.\r\nThe debate on each one was marked by acrimony and strong sectional\r\nexcitement, and each one was signed by President Fillmore amid\r\nenergetic protests from the Northern Abolitionists and the Southern\r\nSecessionists.  The most important one, which provided for the\r\nrendition of fugitive slaves, he referred to Attorney-General\r\nCrittenden before signing it, and received his opinion that it was\r\nconstitutional.  When it was placed on the statute book, the Union\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives organized a serenade to\r\nPresident Fillmore and his Secretary of State, Daniel Webster.\r\nThe President bowed his acknowledgments from a window of the\r\nExecutive Mansion, but Mr. Webster came out on the broad doorstep\r\nof his home, with a friend on either side of him holding a candle,\r\nand, attired in a dressing gown, he commenced a brief speech by\r\nsaying, \"Now is the summer--no!  Now is the winter of our discontent\r\nmade glorious summer by this son of York.\"  This ended the speech\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe wife of President Fillmore was the daughter of the Rev. Lemuel\r\nPowers, a Baptist clergyman.  She was tall, spare, and graceful,\r\nwith auburn hair, light blue eyes, and a fair complexion.  Before\r\nher marriage she had taught school, and she was remarkably well-\r\ninformed, but somewhat reserved in her intercourse with strangers.\r\nShe did not come to Washington until after her husband became\r\nPresident, and her delicate health prevented her mingling in society,\r\nthough she presided with queenly grace at the official dinner-\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThe President's father, \"Squire Fillmore,\" as he was called, visited\r\nhis son at the White House.  He was a venerable-looking man, tall,\r\nand not much bowed by his eighty years, his full gray hair and\r\nintelligent face attracting much attention.  When he was about to\r\nleave, a gentleman asked him why he would not remain a few days\r\nlonger.  \"No, no!\" said the old gentleman, \"I will go.  I don't\r\nlike it here; it isn't a good place to live; it isn't a good place\r\nfor Millard; I wish he was at home in Buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nThe corner-stone of one of the \"extensions\" of the Capitol was laid\r\non the seventy-sixth anniversary of our national independence, July\r\n4th, 1851, by the fraternity of Free Masons in \"due and ample form.\"\r\nPresident Fillmore, the Cabinet, the Diplomatic Corps, several\r\nGovernors of States, and other distinguished personages occupied\r\nseats on a temporary platform, which overlooked the place where\r\nthe corner-stone was laid, Major B. B. French, Grand Master of the\r\nMasons of the District of Columbia, officiating.  Mr. Webster was\r\nthe orator of the day, and delivered an eloquent, thoughtful, and\r\npatriotic address, although he was evidently somewhat feeble, and\r\nwas forced to take sips of strong brandy and water to sustain him\r\nas he proceeded.  Among the vast audience were three gentlemen who\r\nhad, fifty-eight years previously, seen General Washington aid his\r\nbrother Free Masons in laying the corner-stone of the original\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nLater in that year, the large hall which contained the library of\r\nCongress, occupying the entire western side of the centre of the\r\nCapitol, was destroyed by fire, with almost all of its valuable\r\ncontents.  The weather was intensely cold, and, had not the firemen\r\nand citizens (including President Fillmore) worked hard, the entire\r\nCapitol would have been destroyed.  Congress soon afterward made\r\nliberal appropriations, not only for reconstructing the library of\r\ncast-iron, but for the purchase of books, so that the library soon\r\nrose, phoenix-like, from its ashes.  But the purchases were made\r\non the old plan, under the direction of the Congressional Joint\r\nCommittee on the Library, the Chairman of which then, and for\r\nseveral previous and subsequent sessions, was Senator Pearce, of\r\nMaryland, a graduate of Princeton College.  There was not in the\r\nLibrary of Congress a modern encyclopaedia, or a file of a New York\r\ndaily newspaper, or of any newspaper except the venerable daily,\r\n_National Intelligencer_, while _DeBow's Review_ was the only\r\nAmerican magazine taken, although the London _Court Journal_ was\r\nregularly received, and bound at the close of each successive year.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind created a great sensation at Washington, and at her\r\nfirst concert Mr. Webster, who had been dining out, rose majestically\r\nat the end of her first song and made an imposing bow, which was\r\nthe signal for enthusiastic applause.  Lola Montez danced in her\r\npeculiar style to an audience equally large, but containing no\r\nladies.  Charlotte Cushman appeared as _Meg Merrilies_, Parodi and\r\nDempster sang in concerts, Burton and Brougham convulsed their\r\nhearers with laughter, Booth gave evidence of the undiminished glow\r\nof his fiery genius by his masterly delineation of the \"wayward\r\nand techy\" _Gloster_, and Forrest ranted in _Metamora_, to the\r\ndelight of his admirers.  Colonel John W. Forney told a good story\r\nabout a visit which he paid with Forrest to Henry Clay soon after\r\nthe passage of the compromise measure.  The Colonal unguardedly\r\ncomplimented a speech made by Senator Soule, which made Clay's eyes\r\nflash, and he proceeded to criticise him very severely, ending by\r\nsaying:  \"He is nothing but an actor, sir--a mere actor!\"  Then,\r\nsuddenly recollecting the presence of the tragedian, he dropped\r\nhis tone, and turning toward Mr. Forrest, said, with a graceful\r\ngesture, \"I mean, my dear sir, a mere French actor!\"  The visitors\r\nsoon afterward took their leave, and as they descended the stairs,\r\nForrest turned toward Forney and said, \"Mr. Clay has proved by the\r\nskill with which he can change his manner, and the grace with which\r\nhe can make an apology, that he is a better actor than Soule.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Millard Fillmore\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE was born at Summer Hill, New York, January 7th,\r\n1800; was a Representative in Congress from New York, 1837-1843;\r\nwas defeated as a Whig candidate for Governor of New York, 1844;\r\nwas elected State Comptroller, 1847; was elected Vice-President on\r\nthe Whig ticket headed by Z. Taylor in 1848, receiving one hundred\r\nand thirty-six electoral votes, against one hundred and twenty-\r\nseven electoral votes for W. O. Butler; served as President of the\r\nUnited States from July 9th, 1850 to March 3d, 1853; was defeated\r\nas the National American candidate for President in 1856; and died\r\nat Buffalo, New York, March 8th, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nARRAIGNMENT OF DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nMr. Clayton, when Secretary of State, had received a proposition\r\nfrom August Belmont, as the agent of the Rothschilds, to pay the\r\nMexican indemnity in drafts, for which four per cent. premium would\r\nbe allowed.  Then Mr. Webster became Secretary of State, and he\r\nentered into an agreement with an association of bankers, composed\r\nof the Barings, Corcoran & Riggs, and Howland & Aspinwall, for the\r\nnegotiation of the drafts by them at a premium of three and a-half\r\nper cent.  The difference to the Government was about forty thousand\r\ndollars, but the rival sets of bankers had large interests at stake,\r\nbased on their respective purchases of Mexican obligations at\r\ndepreciated values, and a war of pamphlets and newspaper articles\r\nensued.  The dispute was carried into Congress, and during a debate\r\non it in the House, Representative Cartter, of Ohio, afterward\r\nChief Justice of the Courts in the District of Columbia, was very\r\nemphatic in his condemnation of all the bankers interested.  \"I\r\nwant the House to understand,\" said he, with a slight impediment\r\nin his speech, \"that I take no part with the house of Rothschild,\r\nor of Baring, or of Corcoran & Riggs.  I look upon their scramble\r\nfor money precisely as I would upon the contest of a set of blacklegs\r\naround a gaming-table over the last stake.  They have all of them\r\ngrown so large in gormandizing upon money that they have left the\r\nwork of fleecing individuals, and taken to the enterprise of fleecing\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Allen, of the Worcester district of Massachusetts,\r\navailed himself of the opportunity offered by this debate on the\r\npayment of the Mexican indemnity to make a long-threatened malignant\r\nattack on Daniel Webster.  He asserted that he would not intrust\r\nMr. Webster with the making of arrangements to pay the three millions\r\nof Mexican indemnity.  He stated that it was notorious that when\r\nhe was called to take the office of Secretary of State he entered\r\ninto a negotiation by which twenty-five thousand dollars was raised\r\nfor him in State Street, Boston, and twenty-five thousand dollars\r\nin Wall Street, New York.  Mr. Allen trusted that the Democratic\r\nparty had yet honor enough left to inquire into the matter, and\r\nthat the Whigs even, would not palliate it, if satisfied of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nMr. George Ashmun, Representative from the Springfield district,\r\nretorted that Mr. Allen had eaten salt with Mr. Webster and received\r\nbenefits from him, and that he was the only one who dared thus\r\nmalignantly to assail him.  Mr. Ashmun alluded to a letter from\r\nWashington, some time previously published in the Boston _Atlas_,\r\nstating that a member of the House had facts in his possession upon\r\nwhich to found a resolution charging a high officer with \"corruption\r\nand treason,\" and he traced a connection between that letter and\r\nMr. Allen's insinuations.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry W. Hilliard, of Alabama, followed Mr. Ashmun with a\r\nglowing eulogy of Mr. Webster, in which he declared that, although\r\nMassachusetts might repudiate him, the country would take him up,\r\nfor he stood before the eyes of mankind in a far more glorious\r\nposition than he could have occupied but for the stand which he\r\nhad taken in resisting the legions which were bearing down against\r\nthe rights of the South.  This elicited a bitter rejoinder from\r\nMr. Allen, who alluded to the fact that Mr. Hilliard was a clergyman,\r\nand said that he had found out how to serve two masters.  Mr.\r\nAshmun, asking Mr. Allen if he had not published confidential\r\nletters addressed to him by Mr. Charles Hudson, received as a reply,\r\n\"No, sir! no, sir!  You are a scoundrel if you say that I did!\"\r\nThe debate between Messrs. Ashmun and Allen finally became so bitter\r\nthat Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, and other Representatives objected\r\nto its continuance, and refused to hear another word from either\r\nof them.  The next day Mr. Lewis, of Philadelphia, improved an\r\nopportunity for eulogizing Mr. Webster, provoking a scathing reply\r\nfrom Mr. Joshua Giddings.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this debate, Mr. Ashmun wrote to Mr. Hudson to\r\ninquire whether the statement was true or false, and received the\r\nfollowing telegraphic dispatch:\r\n\r\n\"BOSTON, March 3d, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"HON. GEORGE ASHMUN:  I wrote a confidential letter to Hon. Charles\r\nAllen just before the Philadelphia Convention in 1848.  He read\r\nthe letter in a public meeting at Worcester and published it in\r\nthe Worcester _Spy_.  (Signed)  CHARLES HUDSON.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmun declared on the floor of the House, by the authority of\r\nMr. Webster, that the statement of Mr. Allen was \"false in all its\r\nlength and breadth, and in all its details,\" but there was doubtless\r\na foundation for the statement.  The friends of Mr. Webster admitted\r\nthat a voluntary contribution had been tendered him as a compensation\r\nfor the sacrifices he had made in abandoning his profession to\r\naccept the office of Secretary of State, and they justified his\r\nacceptance of the money on the ground that after having devoted\r\nthe labors of a long life to his profession, and attained in it a\r\nhigh rank, which brought large fees, he should not be asked to\r\nrelinquish those professional emoluments without, in justice to\r\nhis obligations to his family, accepting an equivalent.  Without\r\nindorsing this State-Street view of the case, it is to be regretted\r\nthat the charges were made, to trouble Mr. Webster's spirit and\r\nsour his heart.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster often sought consolation in his troubles from the grand\r\nold poetry of the Hebrew Bible, which awakened peaceful echoes in\r\nhis own poetic soul.  His chosen \"crony\" in his latter years, though\r\nmuch younger than himself, was Charles Marsh, a New Hampshire man.\r\nWell educated, polished by travel, and free from pecuniary hamper,\r\nMarsh was a most delightful companion, and his wit, keen as Saladin's\r\ncimeter, never wounded.  Fletcher Webster was also a great favorite\r\nwith his father, for he possessed what Charles Lever called \"the\r\nlost art of conversation.\"  Sometimes, when Mr. Webster's path had\r\nbeen crossed, and he was black as night, Marsh and Fletcher would,\r\nby humorous repartees and witticisms, drive the clouds away, and\r\ngradually force him into a conversation, which would soon become\r\nenlivened by the \"inextinguishable laughter of the gods.\"\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Webster felt keenly the attacks upon him was undeniable,\r\nand atonement could not afterward be made by eulogizing him.  It\r\nhas been well said, that if charity is to be the veil to cover a\r\nmultitude of sins in the dead as well as in the living, cant should\r\nnot lift that veil to swear that those sins were virtues.  Mr.\r\nWebster was sorely troubled by the attitude taken by many Massachusetts\r\nmen at a time when he needed their aid to secure the Presidency,\r\nwhich he undoubtedly believed would be tendered him by the Southern\r\nWhigs, seconded by many Southern Democrats.  He lost flesh, the\r\ncolor faded from his cheeks, the lids of his dark eyes were livid,\r\nand he was evidently debilitated and infirm.  At times he would be\r\napparently unconscious of those around him, then he would rally,\r\nand would display his wonderful conversational qualities.  Yet it\r\nwas evident to those who knew him best that he was \"stumbling down,\"\r\nas Carlyle said of Mirabeau, \"like a mighty heathen and Titan to\r\nhis rest.\"\r\n\r\nOne pleasant afternoon in March, Mr. Brown, of Mississippi, delivered\r\na long speech in the House upon the politics of that State, in\r\nwhich he defended the State Rights party and ridiculed the Union\r\nmovement as un-necessary, no one then being in favor of either\r\ndisunion or secession.  This, one of his colleagues, Mr. Wilcox,\r\ndenied.  \"Do you mean,\" said Mr. Brown, \"to assert that what I have\r\nsaid is false?\"  \"If you say,\" bravely responded Mr. Wilcox, \"that\r\nthere was no party in Mississippi at the recent election in favor\r\nof secession or disunion, you say what is false!\"  The last word\r\nwas echoed by a ringing slap from Brown's open hand on the right\r\ncheek of Wilcox, who promptly returned the blow, and then the two\r\nmen clinched each other in a fierce struggle.  Many of the members,\r\nleaving their seats, crowded around the combatants, while Mr.\r\nSeymour, of Connecticut, who temporarily occupied the chair, pounded\r\nwith his mallet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"Order! order!\"\r\nThe Sergeant-at-Arms was loudly called for, but he was absent, and\r\nbefore he could be found the parties had been separated.  The\r\nSpeaker resumed the chair, and in a few moments the contestants,\r\nstill flushed, apologized to the House--not to each other.  A duel\r\nwas regarded as inevitable, but mutual friends intervened, and the\r\nnext day it was formally announced in the House that the difficulty\r\n\"had been adjusted in a manner highly creditable to both parties,\r\nwho again occupied the same position of friendship which had existed\r\nbetween them previous to the unpleasant affair of the day before.\"\r\nThus easily blew over the terrific tempests of honorable members.\r\n\r\nMr. Leutze, a talented artist, petitioned Congress to commission\r\nhim to paint for the Capitol copies of his works, \"Washington\r\nCrossing the Delaware,\" and \"Washington Rallying his Troops at\r\nMonmouth,\" but without success.  Mr. Healy was equally unsuccessful\r\nwith his proposition to paint two large historical paintings for\r\nthe stairways of the extension of the Capitol, one representing\r\nthe \"Destruction of the Tea in Boston Harbor,\" and the other the\r\n\"Battle of Bunker Hill;\" but subsequently he received an order to\r\npaint the portraits of the Presidents which now grace the White\r\nHouse.  Mr. Martin, a marine artist of recognized ability, also\r\nproposed in vain to paint two large pictures, one representing the\r\nfamous action between the Constitution and the Guerriere, and the\r\nother the night combat between the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis.\r\nIndeed, there have been scores of meritorious works of art offered\r\nto and declined by Committees of Congress, which have expended\r\nlarge sums in the purchase of daubs disgraceful to the Capitol of\r\nthe nation.  The recognition refused these painters at Washington\r\nwas freely accorded elsewhere, however.  Leutze's \"Columbus Before\r\nthe Council at Salamanca\" is justly deemed one of the gems of the\r\nOld World, and has given him an imperishable name.  Among the really\r\ngreat works of our own country is Healy's painting, \"Webster's\r\nReply to Hayne,\" now in Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nSo with sculpture.  Hiram Powers endeavored, without success, to\r\nobtain an order for his colossal statue of America, which was highly\r\ncommended by competent judges, while Mr. Mills was liberally\r\nremunerated for his effigy of General Jackson balancing himself on\r\na brass rocking-horse.  Powers wrote:  \"I do not complain of\r\nanything, for I know how the world goes, as the saying is, and I\r\ntry to take it calmly and patiently, holding out my net, like a\r\nfisherman, to catch salmon, shad, or pilchards, as they may come.\r\nIf salmon, why, then, we can eat salmon; if shad, why, then, the\r\nshad are good; but if pilchards, why, then, we can eat them, and\r\nbless God that we have a dinner at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe honors secured for Colonel Fremont by his father-in-law, Mr.\r\nBenton, for his path-findings across the Rocky Mountains, inspired\r\nother young officers of the army, and some civilians, with a desire\r\nto follow his example.  Returning to Washington, each one had\r\nwonderful tales of adventure to relate.  Even the old travelers,\r\nwho saw the phoenix expire in her odoriferous nest, whence the\r\nchick soon flew forth regenerated, or who found dead lions slain\r\nby the quills of some \"fretful porcupine,\" or who knew that the\r\nstare of the basilisk was death--even those who saw unicorns graze\r\nand who heard mermaids sing--were veracious when compared with the\r\nexplorers of railroad routes across the continent.  Senator Jefferson\r\nDavis did much to encourage them by having their reports published\r\nin quarto form, with expensive illustrations, and Cornelius Wendell\r\nlaid the foundation of his fortune by printing them as \"Pub. Docs.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National Era_, edited by Dr. Gamaliel Bailey, was a source of\r\ngreat annoyance to the pro-slavery men, and one occasion they\r\nexcited an attack on his house by a drunken mob.  Dr. Bailey was\r\na small, slender man, with a noble head, and a countenance on which\r\nthe beautiful attributes of his character were written.  Taking\r\nhis life in his hands, he went to his door-way, attended by his\r\nwife, and bravely faced the infuriated crowd.  He denied that he\r\nhad any agency in a recent attempt to secure the escape of a party\r\nof slaves to the North, and then called the attention of his hearers\r\nto the fact that at a public meeting of the citizens of Washington,\r\nnot very long before that night, resolutions had been passed\r\ndenouncing the French Government for having fettered the press,\r\nyet they were proposing to do in his case what their fellow-citizens\r\nhad condemned when done by others.  His remarks produced an effect,\r\nbut the leaders of the mob raised the cry, \"Burn the _Era_ office!\"\r\nand a movement was made toward that building, when Dan Radcliffe,\r\na well-known Washington lawyer with Southern sympathies, sprang\r\nupon Dr. Bailey's doorstep and made a eloquent appeal in behalf of\r\na free press, concluding with a proposition that the assemblage go\r\nto the house of the Mayor of Washington and give him three cheers.\r\nThis was done, Radcliffe's good nature prevailing, and the mob\r\ndispersed peacefully.\r\n\r\nDr. Bailey was, however, no novice in dealing with mobs.  Ten years\r\nbefore he came to Washington he resided in Cincinnati, where, in\r\nconjunction with James G. Birney, he published _The Philanthropist_,\r\na red-hot anti-slavery sheet.  During his first year in this\r\nenterprize his office was twice attacked by a mob, and in one of\r\ntheir raids the office was gutted and the press thrown into the\r\nriver.  These lively scenes induced a change of base and settled\r\nthe good Doctor in the national metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe ablest newspaper correspondent at Washington during the Fillmore\r\nAdministration was Mr. Erastus S. Brooks, one of the editors and\r\nproprietors of the New York _Express_.  He was then in the prime\r\nof life, rather under the average height, with a large, well-balanced\r\nhead, bright black eyes, and a swarthy complexion.  What he did\r\nnot know about what was going on in political circles, before and\r\nbehind the scenes, was not worth knowing.  His industry was\r\nproverbial, and he was one of the first metropolitan correspondents\r\nto discard the didactic and pompous style which had been copied\r\nfrom the British essayists, and to write with a vigorous, graphic,\r\nand forcible pen.  Washington correspondents in those days were\r\nneither eaves-droppers nor interviewers, but gentlemen, who had a\r\nrecognized position in society, which they never abused.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  R. J. Walker\r\nROBERT J. WALKER was born at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, July\r\n19th, 1801; removed to Mississippi in 1826, and commenced the\r\npractice of law; was United States Senator from Mississippi, 1836-\r\n1845; was Secretary of the Treasury under President Polk, 1845-\r\n1849; was appointed, by President Buchanan, Governor of Kansas in\r\n1857, but soon resigned, and died at Washington City, November\r\n11th, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nFOREIGN INFLUENCE AND KNOW-NOTHINGISM.\r\n\r\nThe forcible acquisition of territory was the means by which the\r\npro-slavery leaders at the South hoped to increase their territory,\r\nand they defended this scheme in the halls of Congress, in their\r\npulpits, and at their public gatherings.  Going back into sacred\r\nand profane history, they would attempt to prove that Moses, Joshua,\r\nSaul, and David were \"filibusters,\" and so were William the Conqueror,\r\nCharlemagne, Gustavus Adolphus, and Napoleon.  Walker simply followed\r\ntheir example, except that they wore crowns on their heads, while\r\nhe, a new man, only carried a sword in his hand.  Was it right,\r\nthey asked, when a brave American adventurer, invited by the\r\ndespairing victims of tyranny in Cuba or of anarchy in Central\r\nAmerica, threw himself boldly, with a handful of comrades, into\r\ntheir midst to sow the seeds of civilization and to reconstruct\r\nsociety--was it right for the citizens of the United States,\r\nthemselves the degenerate sons of filibustering sires, to hurl at\r\nhim as a reproach what was their ancestors' highest merit and glory?\r\n\r\nGeneral Walker, the \"gray-eyed man of destiny,\" was the leading\r\nnative filibuster, but foremost among the foreign adventurers--the\r\nDugald Dalgettys of that epoch--who came here from unsuccessful\r\nrevolutions abroad to seek employment for their swords, was General\r\nHeningen.  He had served with Zumala-Carreguy, in Spain, with\r\nSchamyl, in the Caucasus, and with Kossuth, in Hungary, chronicling\r\nhis exploits in works which won him the friendship of Wellington\r\nand other notables.  Going to Central America, he fought gallantly,\r\nbut unsuccessfully, at Grenada, and he then came to Washington,\r\nwhere he was soon known as an envoy of \"Cuba Libre.\"  He married\r\na cultivated woman, and his tall, soldier-like figure was to be\r\nseen striding along on the sunny sidewalk of Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nevery pleasant morning, until in later years he went South to \"live\r\nor die in Dixie.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Tyler having sent Mr. Dudley Mann as a confidential agent\r\nto Hungary to obtain reliable information concerning the true\r\ncondition of affairs there, the Austrian Government instructed its\r\ndiplomatic representative at Washington, the Chevalier Hulsemann,\r\nto protest against this interference in its internal affairs, as\r\noffensive to the laws of propriety.  This protest was communicated\r\nto Mr. Webster after he became Secretary of State, and in due time\r\nthe Chevalier received an answer which completely extinguished him.\r\nIt carefully reviewed the case, and in conclusion told the protesting\r\nChevalier in plain Anglo-Saxon that nothing would \"deter either\r\nthe Government or the people of the United States from exercising,\r\nat their own discretion, the rights belonging to them as an\r\nindependent nation, and of forming and expressing their own opinion\r\nfreely and at all times upon the great political events which might\r\ntranspire among the civilized nations of the earth.\"  The paternity\r\nof this memorable letter was afterward ascribed to Edward Everett.\r\nIt was not, however, written either by Mr. Webster or Mr. Everett,\r\nbut by Mr. William Hunter, then the Chief Clerk of the Department\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Kossuth had been released from his imprisonment within\r\nthe dominion of the Sublime Porte, by request of the Government of\r\nthe United States, and taken to England in the war steamer Mississippi.\r\nIn due time the great Behemoth of the Magyar race arrived at\r\nWashington, where he created a marked sensation.  The distinguished\r\nrevolutionist wore a military uniform, and the steel scabbard of\r\nhis sword trailed on the ground as he walked.  He was about five\r\nfeet eight inches in height, with a slight and apparently not\r\nstrongly built frame, and was a little round-shouldered.  His face\r\nwas rather oval; a pair of bluish-gray eyes gave an animated and\r\nintelligent look to his countenance.  His forehead, high and broad,\r\nwas deeply wrinkled, and time had just begun to grizzle a head of\r\ndark, straight hair, a heavy moustache, and whiskers which formed\r\na beard beneath his chin.  Whether from his recent captivity or\r\nfrom constitutional causes, there was an air of lassitude in his\r\nlook to which the fatigues of his voyage not improbably contributed.\r\nAltogether, he gave one the idea of a visionary or theoretical\r\nenthusiast rather then of a great leader or soldier.\r\n\r\nKossuth was the guest of Congress at Brown's Hotel, but those\r\nSenators and Representatives who called to pay their respects found\r\nmembers of his retinue on guard before the door of his apartments,\r\narmed with muskets and bayonets, while his anteroom was crowded\r\nwith the members of his staff.  They had evidently been reared in\r\ncamps, as they caroused all day and then tumbled into their beds\r\nbooted and spurred, furnishing items of liquors, wines, cigars,\r\nand damaged furniture for the long and large hotel bill which\r\nCongress had to pay.  Mr. Seward entertained the Hungarian party\r\nat an evening reception, and a number of Congressmen gave Kossuth\r\na subscription dinner at the National Hotel, at which several of\r\nthe known aspirants for the Presidency spoke.  Mr. Webster was, as\r\nbecame the Secretary of State, carefully guarded in his remarks,\r\nand later in the evening, when the champagne had flowed freely, he\r\nindulged in what appeared to be his impromptu individual opinions,\r\nbut he unluckily dropped at his seat a slip of paper on which his\r\ngushing sentences had been carefully written out.  General Houston\r\nmanaged to leave the table in time to avoid being called upon to\r\nspeak, and General Scott, who regarded Kossuth as a gigantic humbug,\r\nhad escaped to Richmond.  Kossuth was invited to dine at the White\r\nHouse, and on New Year's day he held a reception, but he failed in\r\nhis attempt to secure Congressional recognition or material aid.\r\n\r\nA number of the leading public men at Washington were so disgusted\r\nby the assumption and arrogance displayed by Kossuth, and by the\r\ntoadyism manifested by many of those who humbled themselves before\r\nhim, that they organized a banquet, at which Senator Crittenden\r\nwas the principal speaker.  \"Beware,\" said the eloquent Kentuckian,\r\nin the words of Washington, \"of the introduction or exercise of a\r\nforeign influence among you!  We are Americans!  The Father of our\r\nCountry has taught us, and we have learned, to govern ourselves.\r\nIf the rest of the world have not learned that lesson, how shall\r\nthey teach us?  We are the teachers, and yet they appear here with\r\na new exposition of Washington's Farewell Address.  For one, I do\r\nnot want this new doctrine.  I want to stand _super antiquas vias_\r\n--upon the old road that Washington traveled, and that every\r\nPresident from Washington to Fillmore has traveled.\"\r\n\r\nThe main effect of Kossuth's visit to the United States was an\r\nextraordinary impetus given to \"The Order of United Americans,\"\r\nfrom which was evolved that political phenomenon, the American, or\r\nKnow-Nothing, party.  The mysterious movements of this organization\r\nattracted the curiosity of the people, and members of the old\r\npolitical organizations eagerly desired to learn what was carefully\r\nconcealed.  Secretly-held lodges, with their paraphernalia, pass-\r\nwords, and degrees, grips, and signs, tickled the popular fancy,\r\nand the new organization became fashionable.  Men of all religions\r\nand political creeds fraternized beneath the \"stars and stripes,\"\r\nand solemnly pledged themselves to the support of \"our country,\r\nour whole country, and nothing but our country.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaders of this Know-Nothing movement, who in the delirium of\r\nthe hour were intrusted with dictatorial authority, were in no way\r\ncalculated to exercise a permanent, healthful control.  They were\r\ngenerally without education, without statesmanship, without knowledge\r\nof public affairs, and, to speak plainly, without the abilities or\r\ngenius which might enable them to dispense with experience.  Losing\r\nsight of the cardinal principle of the American Order, that only\r\nthose identified with the Republic by birth or permanent residence\r\nshould manage its political affairs, these leaders fell back upon\r\na bigoted hostility to the Church of Rome, to which many of their\r\noriginal members in Louisiana and elsewhere belonged.  The result\r\nwas that the mighty organization had begun to decay before it\r\nattained its growth, and that the old political leaders became\r\nmembers that they might elbow the improvised chieftains from power\r\nwhen the effervescence of the movement should subside.  A number\r\nof Abolitionists, headed by Henry Wilson and Anson Burlingame, of\r\nMassachusetts, sought admission into the lodges, knelt at the\r\naltars, pledged themselves by solemn oaths to support the \"Order,\"\r\nand then used it with great success for the destruction of the Whig\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAnother noted person who visited Washington early in the Administration\r\nof Mr. Fillmore was William M. Tweed, of New York, who came as\r\nforeman of the Americus Engine Company, Number Six, a volunteer\r\nfire organization.  Visiting the White House, the company was\r\nushered into the East Room, where President Fillmore soon appeared,\r\nand Tweed, stepping out in front of his command, said:  \"These are\r\nBig Six's boys, Mr. President!\"  He then walked along the line with\r\nMr. Fillmore, and introduced each member individually.  As they\r\nwere leaving the room, a newspaper reporter asked Tweed why he had\r\nnot made a longer speech.  \"There was no necessity,\" replied the\r\nfuture pillager of the city treasury of New York, \"for the Company\r\nis as much grander than any other fire company in the world as\r\nNiagara Falls is grander than Croton dam.\"  Two years afterward,\r\nTweed, profiting by a division in the Whig ranks in the Fifth\r\nDistrict of New York, returned to Washington as a Representative\r\nin Congress.  He was a regular attendant, never participating in\r\nthe debates, and always voting with the Democrats.  Twice he read\r\nspeeches which were written for him, and he obtained for a relative\r\nthe contract for supplying the House with chairs for summer use,\r\nwhich were worthless and soon disappeared.\r\n\r\nSenator Andrew Pickens Butler was a prominent figure at the Capitol\r\nand in Washington society.  He was a trifle larger round at the\r\nwaistband than anywhere else, his long white hair stood out as if\r\nhe were charged with electric fluid, and South Carolina was legibly\r\nwritten on his rubicund countenance.  The genial old patriarch\r\nwould occasionally take too much wine in the \"Hole in the Wall\" or\r\nin some committee-room, and then go into the Senate and attempt to\r\nbully Chase or Hale; but every one liked him, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThen there was Senator Slidell, of Louisiana, a New Yorker by birth,\r\nwith a florid face, long gray hair, and prominent eyes, forming a\r\nstriking contrast in personal appearance with his dapper little\r\ncolleague, Senator Benjamin, whose features disclosed his Jewish\r\nextraction.  General Taylor had wished to have Mr. Benjamin in his\r\nCabinet, but scandalous reports concerning Mrs. Benjamin had reached\r\nWashington, and the General was informed that she would not be\r\nreceived in society.  Mr. Benjamin then rented a house at Washington,\r\nfurnished it handsomely, and entertained with lavish hospitality.\r\nHis gentlemen friends would eat his dinners, but they would not\r\nbring their wives or daughters to Mrs. Benjamin's evening parties,\r\nand she, deeply mortified, went to Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of December, 1851, Henry Clay spoke in the Senate\r\nfor the last time, and General Cass presented the credentials of\r\nCharles Sumner, who had been elected by one of the coalitions\r\nbetween the anti-slavery Know-Nothings and the Democrats, which\r\ngave the latter the local offices in New York, Ohio, and Massachusetts,\r\nand elected Seward, Chase, and Sumner to the United States Senate.\r\nSoon after Mr. Sumner took his seat in the arena which had been\r\nmade famous by the political champions of the North, the South,\r\nand the West, Mr. Benton said to him, with a patronizing air, \"You\r\nhave come upon the stage too late, sir.  Not only have our great\r\nmen passed away, but the great issues have been settled also.  The\r\nlast of these was the National Bank, and that has been overthrown\r\nforever.  Nothing is left you, sir, but puny sectional questions\r\nand petty strifes about slavery and fugitive-slave laws, involving\r\nno national interests.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner had but two coadjutors in opposing slavery and in\r\nadvocating freedom when he entered the Senate, but before he died\r\nhe was the recognized leader of more than two-thirds of that body.\r\nHe was denounced by a leading Whig newspaper of Boston when he left\r\nthat city to take his seat as \"an agitator,\" and he was refused a\r\nplace on any committee of the Senate, as being \"outside of any\r\nhealthy political organization,\" but he lived to exercise a\r\ncontrolling influence in Massachusetts politics and to be Chairman\r\nof the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.  He had learned from\r\nJudge Story the value of systematic industry, and while preparing\r\nlong speeches on the questions before the Senate he also applied\r\nhimself sedulously to the practical duties of a Senator, taking\r\nespecial pains to answer every letter addressed to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker Linn Boyd used to preside with great dignity, sitting\r\non an elevated platform beneath a canopy of scarlet curtains.\r\nSeated at his right hand, at the base of the platform beside the\r\n\"mace,\" was Andrew Jackson Glossbrenner, the Sergeant-at-Arms, and\r\non the opposite side was Mr. McKnew, the Doorkeeper.  Mr. John W.\r\nForney officiated at the Clerk's table, having been elected by a\r\ndecided majority.  His defeat two years previous had been very\r\nannoying to his Democratic friends at the North, who were expected\r\nto aid the Southern wing of the party with their votes, and yet\r\nwere often deserted when they desired offices.  \"It is,\" said one\r\nof them, \"paying us a great compliment for our principles, or great\r\ncontempt for our pliancy.\"  Mr. Buchanan wrote to a Virginia\r\nDemocratic leader, \"Poor Forney deserves a better fate than to be\r\nwounded 'in the house of his friends,' and to vote for a Whig in\r\npreference to him was the unkindest cut of all.  It will, I am\r\nconfident, produce no change in his editorial course, but I dread\r\nits effect.\"  Mr. Forney did not permit his desertion to influence\r\nhis pen, and his loyalty to the party was rewarded by his election,\r\ntwo years after this defeat, as Clerk of the House.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  [illegible]\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS was born in Christian County, Kentucky, June 3d,\r\n1808; graduated at West Point in 1828; was an officer in the United\r\nStates Army, 1828-1835; was a Representative from Mississippi,\r\nDecember 1st, 1845 to June, 1846, when he resigned to command the\r\nFirst Regiment of Mississippi Riflemen in the war with Mexico; was\r\nUnited States Senator, December 4th, 1847, to November 1851; was\r\ndefeated as the Secession candidate for Governor of Mississippi in\r\n1851 by H. S. Foote, Union candidate; was Secretary of War under\r\nPresident Pierce, March 7th, 1853, to March 3d, 1857; was again\r\nUnited States Senator, March 4th, 1857, until he withdrew, January\r\n21st, 1861; was President of the Confederate States; was captured\r\nby the United States troops, May 10th, 1865, imprisoned two years\r\nat Fortress Monroe, and then released on bail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nPLOTTING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Thirty-second Congress, which began on\r\nthe 1st of August, 1852, was characterized by sectional strife,\r\nand was devoted to President-making.  President Fillmore, who had\r\ntraveled in the Northern States during the preceding summer, felt\r\nconfident that he would receive the Whig nomination, and so did\r\nMr. Webster, who \"weighed him down\"--so Charles Francis Adams wrote\r\nHenry Wilson--\"as the Old Man of the Sea did Sinbad.\"  Meanwhile\r\nMr. Seward and his henchman, Mr. Weed, were very active, and the\r\nlatter afterward acknowledged that he had himself intrigued with\r\nthe Democratic leaders for the nomination of Governor Marcy, who\r\nwould be sure to carry the State of New York, and thus secure the\r\ndefeat of the Whig candidate.  \"Holding President Fillmore and his\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Webster, responsible for a temporary\r\noverthrow of the Whig party,\" says Mr. Weed, \"I desired to see\r\nthose gentlemen left to reap what they had sown.  In other words,\r\nI wanted either Mr. Fillmore or Mr. Webster to be nominated for\r\nPresident upon their own issues.  I devoted several weeks to the\r\nremoval of obstacles in the way of Governor Marcy's nomination for\r\nPresident by the Democratic National Convention.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass, Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Buchanan were equally active in\r\nthe Democratic ranks, and their respective friends became so angry\r\nwith each other that it was an easy matter to win the nomination\r\nwith what the politicians call \"a dark horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe sessions of the National Democratic Convention were protracted\r\nand stormy, and on the thirty-fifth ballot the name of General\r\nFranklin Pierce was brought forward, for the first time, by the\r\nVirginia delegation.  Several other States voted for the New\r\nHampshire Brigadier, but it did not seem possible that he could be\r\nnominated, and the next day, on the forty-eighth ballot, Virginia\r\ngave her vote for Daniel S. Dickinson, of New York.  It was received\r\nwith great applause, but Mr. Dickinson, who was a delegate pledged\r\nto the support of Cass, was too honorable a man to accept what he\r\nthought belonged to his friend.  Receiving permission to address\r\nthe Convention, he eloquently withdrew his own name and pleaded so\r\nearnestly for the nomination of General Cass, that he awakened the\r\nenthusiasm of the audience, and received a shower of bouquets from\r\nthe ladies in the galleries, to which he gracefully alluded \"as a\r\nrose-bud in the wreath of his political destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThe Convention at last, on the forty-ninth ballot, nominated General\r\nPierce (Purse, his friends called him) a gentleman of courteous\r\ntemper, highly agreeable manners, and convivial nature.  He had\r\nserved in the recent war with Mexico; he had never given a vote or\r\nwritten a sentence that the straightest Southern Democrat could\r\nwish to blot; and he was identified with the slave-power, having\r\ndenounced its enemies as the enemies of the Constitution.  William\r\nR. King, at the time president _pro tempore_ of the Senate, was\r\nnominated for Vice-President, receiving every vote except the eleven\r\ngiven by the delegation from Illinois, which were for Jefferson\r\nDavis.  Cass and Douglas were at first much provoked by the action\r\nof the Convention, but Buchanan gracefully accepted the situation.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster felt and asserted that he was entitled to receive\r\nthe Whig nomination.  More than thirty years of public service had\r\nmade him the ablest and the most conspicuous member of his party\r\nthen on the stage, and neither Fillmore nor Scott could compare\r\nwith him in the amount and value of public services rendered.  He\r\nhad worked long, assiduously, and faithfully to deserve the honors\r\nof his party and to qualify himself for the highest distinction\r\nthat party could bestow upon him.  He must receive its nomination\r\nnow or never, as he was then upward of sixty years of age, and his\r\nvigorous constitution had shown signs of decay.  He engaged in the\r\ncampaign, however, with the hope ad the vigor of youth, writing\r\nletters to his friends, circulating large pamphlet editions of his\r\nlife and of his speeches, and entertaining at his table those\r\nthrough whose influence he hoped to receive the Southern support\r\nnecessary to secure his success.  No statesman ever understood the\r\nvalue of printers' ink better than did Mr. Webster, and he always\r\ntook care to have a record of what he did and said placed before\r\nthe country.  Unfortunately for his printers, much of his last\r\ncampaign work was done on credit, and never was paid for.\r\n\r\nPresident Fillmore, meanwhile, was quietly but steadily using the\r\npatronage of the Federal Government to secure the election of\r\ndelegates to the Whig National Convention friendly to his own\r\nnomination.  Mr. Webster counted on the support of the President's\r\nfriends, but he never received from Mr. Fillmore any pledges that\r\nit would be given.  On the contrary, the leading office-holders\r\nasserted, weeks prior to the assembling of the Convention, that\r\nthe contest had already been narrowed down to a question between\r\nFillmore and Scott.  Mr. Seward's friends were of the same opinion,\r\nand urged the support of Scott as the only way to defeat the\r\nnomination of Fillmore.  Horace Greeley wrote from Washington to\r\nThurlow Weed:  \"If Fillmore and Webster will only use each other\r\nup, we may possibly recover--but our chance is slim.  There is a\r\npowerful interest working hard against Douglas; Buchanan will have\r\nto fight hard for his own State; if he gets it he may be nominated;\r\nCass is nowhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig National Convention, the last one held by that party, met\r\nin Baltimore on Wednesday, the 16th of June, 1852.  Two days were\r\nspent in effecting an organization and in preparing a \"platform,\"\r\nafter which, on proceeding to ballot for a Presidential candidate,\r\nGeneral Scott had one hundred and thirty-four votes, Mr. Fillmore\r\none hundred and thirty-three, and Mr. Webster twenty-nine, every\r\none of which was cast by a Northern delegate.  Not a Southern vote\r\nwas given to him, despite all the promises made, but Mr. Fillmore\r\nreceived the entire Southern strength.  The balloting was continued\r\nuntil Saturday afternoon without any change, and even the eloquence\r\nof Rufus Choate failed to secure the vote of a single Southern\r\ndelegate for his cherished friend.  After the adjournment of the\r\nConvention from Saturday until Monday, Mr. Choate visited Washington,\r\nhoping to move Mr. Fillmore; but the President \"made no sign,\" and\r\nMr. Webster saw that the Presidency, to which he had so long aspired,\r\nwas to pass beyond his reach.  He was saddened by the disappointment,\r\nand especially wounded when he was informed that Mr. Clay had\r\nadvised the Southern delegates to support Mr. Fillmore.\r\n\r\nA nomination was finally made on the fifty-third ballot, when twenty-\r\neight delegates from Pennsylvania changed their votes from Fillmore\r\nto General Scott.  That evening a party of enthusiastic Whigs at\r\nWashington, after serenading President Fillmore, marched to the\r\nresidence of Mr. Webster.  The band performed several patriotic\r\nairs, but some time elapsed before Mr. Webster appeared, wearing\r\na long dressing-gown, and looking sad and weary.  He said but a\r\nfew words, making no allusion to General Scott, and when, in\r\nconclusion, he said that, for one, he should sleep well and rise\r\nwith the lark the next morning, and bade them good-night, the\r\nserenaders retired as if they had had a funeral sermon preached to\r\nthem.  Thenceforth Mr. Webster was a disappointed, heart-stricken\r\nman, and he retired to Marshfield profoundly disgusted with the\r\ninsincerity of politicians.\r\n\r\nThe noisy rejoicings by the Whigs at Washington over the nomination\r\nof General Scott disturbed Henry Clay, who lay on his death-bed at\r\nthe National Hotel, attended only by one of his sons, Thomas Hart\r\nClay, and a negro servant.  The \"Great Commoner\" was very feeble,\r\nand a few days later he breathed his last, as a Christian philosopher\r\nshould die.  His hope continued to the end, though true and real,\r\nto be tremulous with humility rather than rapturous with assurance.\r\nOn the evening previous to his departure, sitting an hour in silence\r\nby his side, the Rev. Dr. Butler heard him, in the slight wanderings\r\nof his mind to other days and other scenes, murmuring the words,\r\n\"My mother! mother! mother!\" and saying \"My dear wife,\" as if she\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\n\"Broken with the storms of life,\" Henry Clay gave up the ghost,\r\nand his remains were escorted with high funeral honors to his own\r\nbeloved Commonwealth of Kentucky, where they rest beneath an imposing\r\nmonument.  Twice a candidate for the Presidency, and twice defeated,\r\nhis death was mourned by an immense number of attached personal\r\nfriends, and generally regretted by the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were greatly embarrassed by General Scott, who persisted\r\nin making campaign speeches, some of which did him great harm.\r\nTheir mass meetings proved failures, notably one on the battleground\r\nof Niagara, but they endeavored to atone for these discouraging\r\nevents by a profuse distribution of popular literature.  They\r\ncirculated large editions of a tract by Horace Greeley, entitled,\r\n\"Why am I a Whig?\" and of campaign lives of \"Old Chapultepec,\"\r\npublished in English, French, and German.  Mr. Buchanan was unusually\r\nactive in his opposition to the Whig ticket.  \"I should regard\r\nScott's election,\" he wrote to a friend, \"as one of the greatest\r\ncalamities which could befall the country.  I know him well, and\r\ndo not doubt either his patriotism or his integrity; but he is vain\r\nbeyond any man I have ever known, and, what is remarkable in a vain\r\nman, he is obstinate and self-willed and unyielding.  His judgment,\r\nexcept in conducting a campaign in the field, is perverse and\r\nunsound; and when, added to all this, we consider that, if elected\r\nat all, it will be under the auspices of Seward and his Abolition\r\nassociates, I fear for the fate of this Union.\"  General Scott was\r\nmercilessly abused by the Democratic orators and writers also, who\r\neven ridiculed the establishment of the Soldiers' Home at Washington,\r\nwith the contribution levied on the City of Mexico when captured\r\nby him, as the creation of an aristocratic body of military paupers.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party, forgetting all previous differences, rallied\r\nto the support of their candidate.  A campaign life of him was\r\nwritten by his old college friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and eloquent\r\nspeakers extolled his statesmanship, his military services, and\r\nhis devotion to the compromise measures which were to avert the\r\nthreatened civil war.  A good estimate of his character was told\r\nby the Whig speakers, as having been given to an itinerant lecturer\r\nby the landlord of a New Hampshire village inn.  \"What sort of a\r\nman is General Pierce?\" asked the traveler.  \"Waal, up here, where\r\neverybody knows Frank Pierce,\" was the reply, \"and where Frank\r\nPierce knows everybody, he's a pretty considerable fellow, I tell\r\nyou.  But come to spread him out over this whole country, I'm afraid\r\nthat he'll be dreadful thin in some places.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr. Webster aided the Democratic candidate.  The broken-\r\ndown and disappointed statesman died at his loved rural home on\r\nthe sea-shore, where, by his request, his cattle were driven beneath\r\nhis window so that he could gaze on them once more before he left\r\nthem forever.  He wrestled with the great Destroyer, showing a\r\nreluctance to abandon life, and looking into the future with\r\napprehension rather than with hope.  When Dr. Jeffries repeated to\r\nhim the soothing words of Sacred Writ, \"Thy rod and Thy staff they\r\ncomfort me,\" the dying statesman exclaimed, \"Yes; that is what I\r\nwant, Thy rod; Thy staff!\"  He was no hypocrite, and although he\r\nprayed often and earnestly, he did not pretend that he felt that\r\npeace \"which passeth all understanding,\" but he did exhibit a\r\ndevoted submission and a true reliance on Almighty God.  Craving\r\nstimulants, he heard Dr. Jeffries tell an attendant, \"Give him a\r\nspoonful of brandy in fifteen minutes, another in half an hour,\r\nand another in three quarters of an hour, if he still lives.\"\r\nThese directions were followed with exactness until the arrival of\r\nthe time last mentioned, when the attendants were undecided about\r\nadministering another dose.  It was in the midst of their doubts\r\nthat the dying statesman, who had been watching a clock in the\r\nroom, partly raised his head and feebly remarked:  \"I still live.\"\r\nThe brandy was given to him, and he sank into a state of tranquil\r\nunconsciousness, from which he never rallied.\r\n\r\nThose who attended the funeral at Marshfield saw Mr. Webster's\r\nremains lying in an open iron coffin, beneath the shade of a large\r\nelm tree before the house.  The body was dressed in a blue coat\r\nwith gilt buttons, white vest, cravat, pantaloons, gloves, and\r\nshoes with dark cloth gaiters.  His hand rested upon his breast,\r\nand his features wore a sad smile familiar to those who had known\r\nhim in his later years.  The village pastor conducted the services,\r\nafter which the upper half of the coffin was put on, and on a low\r\nplatform car, drawn by two black horses, it was taken to the burial-\r\nground on the estate.  On either side of the remains walked the\r\npall-bearers selected by the deceased--six sturdy, weather-bronzed\r\nfarmer-fishermen, who lived in the vicinity--while General Pierce,\r\nthe Mayor of Boston, Edward Everett, Rufus Choate, and other\r\ndistinguished personages followed as they best could.  There were\r\nmany evidences of grief among the thousands of Mr. Webster's friends\r\npresent, and yet death was for him a happy escape from trouble.\r\nHe was painfully aware that he had forfeited the political confidence\r\nof the people of Massachusetts and gained nothing by so doing; he\r\nhad found that he could not receive a nomination for the Presidency,\r\neven from the party which he had so long served, and his pecuniary\r\nembarrassments were very annoying.  Neither could he, under the\r\ncircumstances, have continued to hold office under Mr. Fillmore,\r\nwho, after Webster's funeral, appointed Edward Everett as his\r\nsuccessor in the Department of State.\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth Presidential election was held, General Scott\r\nreceived only the electoral votes of Massachusetts, Vermont,\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee; Pierce and King received two hundred and\r\nfifty-four votes against forty-two votes for Scott and Graham.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  JJCrittenden\r\nJOHN JORDAN CRITTENDEN  was born in Woodford County, Kentucky,\r\nSeptember 10th, 1786; was United States Senator from Kentucky,\r\nDecember 1st, 1817, to March 3d, 1819, and again December 7th,\r\n1835, to March 3d, 1841; was Attorney-General under President\r\nHarrison, March 5th, 1841, to September 13th, 1841; was again United\r\nStates Senator, March 31st, 1842 - 1848; was Governor of Kentucky,\r\n1848-1850; was Attorney-General under President Fillmore, July\r\n20th, 1850, to March 3d, 1853; was again United States Senator,\r\nDecember 3d, 1855, to March 3d, 1861; was a Representative in\r\nCongress, July 4th, 1861, to March 3d, 1863, and died at Frankfort,\r\nKentucky, July 26th, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nPIERCE AT THE HELM.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pierce received a severe blow after his election, a railroad\r\naccident in Massachusetts depriving him of his only child, a\r\npromising boy, to whom he was devotedly attached.  A week before\r\nthe inauguration he escorted his sorrow-stricken wife to Baltimore,\r\nwhere he left her, and then went to Washington, accompanied by his\r\nprivate secretary, Mr. Sidney Webster.  President Fillmore invited\r\nthem to dine socially at the White House, and in the evening they\r\nwere present at a numerously attended public reception in the East\r\nRoom.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of General Pierce attracted crowds from the cities\r\non the Atlantic coast, with some from the western slope of the\r\nAlleghanies.  It was a cold, raw day, and the President-elect rode\r\nin a carriage with President Fillmore, surrounded by a body-guard\r\nof young gentlemen, mounted on fine horses, and serving for that\r\nday as Deputy United States Marshals.  There was a military escort,\r\ncomposed of the Marine Corps, the uniformed militia of the District,\r\nand visiting companies from Baltimore and Alexandria.  Behind the\r\nPresident's carriage marched several political associations and\r\nthe mechanics at the Navy Yard, with a full-rigged miniature vessel.\r\n\r\nAs William R. King, the Vice-President elect, was in Cuba, hoping\r\nto benefit his health, the Senate elected David J. Atchison, of\r\nMissouri, President _pro tempore_.  The Senate, accompanied by the\r\nDiplomatic Corps and officers of the army and of the navy, all in\r\nfull uniform, then moved in procession to the east front of the\r\nCapitol.  When the cheers with which the President-elect was received\r\nhad subsided, he advanced to the front of the platform and delivered\r\nhis inaugural address, which he had committed to memory, although\r\nhe held the manuscript in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of General Pierce was dignified and winning,\r\nif not imposing, although he was but five feet nine inches high,\r\nslenderly built, and without that depth of chest or breadth of\r\nshoulder which indicate vigorous constitutions.  His complexion\r\nwas pale and his features were thin and care-worn, but his deportment\r\nwas graceful and authoritative.  It was evident that he belonged\r\nto that active, wiry class of men capable of great endurance and\r\nphysical fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural was a plain, straightforward document, intensely\r\nnational in tone, and it stirred the hearts of the vast audience\r\nwhich heard it like the clarion notes of a trumpet.  The new\r\nPresident had an abiding confidence in the stability of our\r\ninstitutions.  Snow began to fall before he had concluded his\r\naddress and taken the oath of office, which was administered by\r\nChief Justice Taney.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus King took the oath of office as Vice-President on\r\nthe 4th of March, 1853, at a plantation on the highest of the hills\r\nthat surround Matanzas, with the luxuriant vegetation of Cuba all\r\naround, the clear, blue sky of the tropics overhead, and a delicious\r\nsea breeze cooling the pure atmosphere.  The oath was administered\r\nby United States Consul Rodney, and at the conclusion of the\r\nceremonies the assembled creoles shouted, \"_Vaya vol con Dios!_\"\r\n(God will be with you), while the veteran politician appeared calm,\r\nas one who had fought the good fight and would soon lay hold of\r\neternal light.  Reaching his home at Cahaba, Ala., on the 17th of\r\nApril, he died the following day, and his remains were buried on\r\nhis plantation, known as the \"Pine Hills.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce formed a Cabinet of remarkable ability.  He had\r\nwanted Caleb Cushing as his Secretary of State, but the old anti-\r\nslavery utterances of the Massachusetts Brigadier had not been\r\nforgotten, and Pierce could make him only his Attorney-General.\r\nGovernor Marcy was placed at the head of the Department of State,\r\nand he invited Mr. George Sumner, a brother of the Senator, to\r\nbecome Assistant Secretary of State, but the invitation was declined.\r\nJames Guthrie, a stalwart, clear-headed Kentuckian, was made\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, with Peter G. Washington, a veteran\r\nDistrict politician, as Assistant Secretary.  Jefferson Davis\r\nsolicited and received the position of Secretary of War, James C.\r\nDobbin, of North Carolina, was made Secretary of the Navy; Robert\r\nMcClelland, of Michigan, was designated by General Cass for Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and James Campbell, of Pennsylvania, was appointed\r\nPostmaster-General, with thirty thousand subordinate places to be\r\nfilled, its progressive improvements to be looked after, and a\r\ngeneral desire on the part of the public for a reduction of postage.\r\nAn abler Cabinet never gathered around the council-table at the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, the Secretary of War, entertained more than any\r\nof his associates.  His dinner-parties, at which six guests sat\r\ndown with the host and hostess, were very enjoyable, and his evening\r\nreceptions, which were attended by the leading Southerners and\r\ntheir Northern allies, were brilliant affairs with one exception.\r\nOn that occasion, owing, it was to said, to a defect in the gas\r\nmeter, every light in the house suddenly ceased to burn.  It was\r\nlate, and with great difficulty lamps and candles were obtained to\r\nenable the guests to secure their wraps and make their departure.\r\n\r\nNo other President ever won the affections of the people of Washington\r\nso completely as did General Pierce.  Such was the respect entertained\r\nfor him by citizens of all political creeds, that when he took his\r\ncustomary \"constitutional\" walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the\r\nCapitol and back one could mark his progress by the uplifting of\r\nhats as he passed along.  He and Mrs. Pierce, disregarding the\r\netiquette of the White House, used to pay social visits to the\r\nfamilies of New Hampshire friends holding clerkships, and to have\r\nthem as guests at their family dinner-table.  The President's\r\nfascinating courtesy and kindness were irresistible.\r\n\r\nRoger A. Pryor first figured at Washington in the spring of 1853.\r\nHe was an editorial contributor to the Washington _Union_, the\r\nDemocratic organ, and he wrote a scathing review of _The War of\r\nOrmuzd and Ahriman_, by Henry Winter Davis, of Baltimore, which\r\nset for the United States and Russia as the respective champions\r\nof the principles of liberty and of despotism, and claimed to\r\nforesee in the distant future a mighty and decisive conflict between\r\nthese persistent combatants.  This Mr. Pryor pronounced impossible,\r\nasserting that \"in every element of national strength and happiness\r\nRussia is great and prosperous beyond any other country in Europe,\"\r\nand that the United States and Russia, instead of becoming enemies,\r\n\"will consolidate and perpetuate their friendly relations by the\r\nsame just and pacific policy which has regulated their intercourse\r\nin times past.\"  This article was very distasteful to the Democratic\r\nreaders of the _Union_, and the editor denounced it.  Mr. Pryor\r\ncame back at him in the _Intelligencer_, declaring that he was not\r\nthe eulogist of the Russian Empire, but setting forth at great\r\nlength the good-will of Russia toward the United States, and\r\nespecially announcing that \"in Russia the maudlin, mock philanthropy\r\nof _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ is an unknown disease.\"  It was the general\r\nbelief in Washington that Mr. Pryor had been inspired by some one\r\nconnected with the Russian Legation.\r\n\r\nOld Madeira wine has always been very popular in Washington,\r\nespecially on the tables of their Honors the Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt.  For many years supplies were obtained from the old mercantile\r\nhouses in Alexandria, which had made direct importations prior to\r\nthe Revolution.  During the Fillmore Administration many Washington\r\ncellars were replenished at the sale of the private stock of wines\r\nand liquors of the late Josiah Lee, of Baltimore.  Fifty demijohns\r\nof various brands of Madeira were sold at prices ranging from twenty-\r\nfour dollars to forty-nine dollars per gallon; and one lot of twenty-\r\ntwo bottles commanded the extreme price of fifteen dollars and\r\nfifty cents per bottle, which at five bottles to the gallon is at\r\nthe rate of seventy-seven dollars and fifty cents per gallon.\r\n\r\nMr. Brady came from New York and opened a \"daguerrean saloon\" at\r\nWashington, and the dim portraits produced on burnished metal were\r\nregarded with silent astonishment.  Up to that time the metropolis\r\nhad been visited every winter by portrait and miniature painters,\r\nbut their work required long sittings and was expensive.  The\r\ndaguerreotypes, which could be produced in a few moments and at a\r\ncomparatively small cost, became very popular, and Brady's gallery\r\nwas thronged every morning with distinguished visitors.  Mr. Brady\r\nwas a man of slight figure, well proportioned, with features somewhat\r\nresembling the portraits of Vandyke.  He possessed wonderful\r\npatience, artistic skill, and a thorough acquaintance with the\r\nmechanical and chemical features of sun-painting.  For the next\r\nthirty years he took portraits of almost all the prominent persons\r\nwho visited Washington City, and in time his reminiscences of them\r\nbecame very interesting.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Washington enjoyed a rare treat when Thackeray came\r\nto deliver his lectures on the English essayists, wits, and humorists\r\nof the eighteenth century.  Accustomed to the spread-eagle style\r\nof oratory too prevalent at the Capitol, they were delighted with\r\nthe pleasing voice and easy manner of the burly, gray-haired, rosy-\r\ncheeked Briton, who made no gestures, but stood most of the time\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, as if he were talking with friends\r\nat a cozy fireside.  He did not deal, like Cervantes, with the\r\nridiculous extravagance of a fantastic order, nor, like Washington\r\nIrving, with the faults and foibles of men, but he struck at the\r\nvery heart of the social life of his countrymen's ancestors with\r\ncaustic and relentless satire.  Some of the more puritanical objected\r\nto the moral tendencies of Thackeray's lectures, and argued that\r\nthe naughty scapegraces of the British court should not have been\r\nthus exhumed for the edification of an American audience.\r\n\r\nThackeray made himself at home among the working journalists at\r\nWashington, and was always asking questions.  He was especially\r\ninterested in the trial of Herbert, a California Congressman, who\r\nhad shot dead at a hotel table a waiter who had not promptly served\r\nhim, and he appeared to study old Major Lane, a \"hunter from\r\nKentucky,\" \"half horse and half alligator,\" but gentlemanly in his\r\nmanners, and partial to rye-whisky, ruffled shirts, gold-headed\r\ncanes, and draw-poker.  The Major had fought--so he said--under\r\nJackson at New Orleans, under Houston at San Jacinto, and under\r\nZach. Taylor at Buena Vista, and he was then prosecuting a claim\r\nbefore Congress for his services as an agent among the Yazoo Indians.\r\nIt was better than a play to hear him talk, and to observe Thackeray\r\nas he listened.\r\n\r\nRembrandt Peale visited Washington during the Pierce Administration,\r\nand greatly interested those who met him with his reminiscences.\r\nHis birth took place while his father, Charles Wilson Peale, was\r\nin camp at Valley Forge.  After the War of the Revolution, and\r\nwhile Washington was a resident of Philadelphia, Charles Wilson\r\nPeale painted several portraits of him.  Young Rembrandt used to\r\npass much of his time in the studio, and in 1786, when the best of\r\nthe portraits was painted, he stood at the back of his father's\r\nchair watching the operation.  In 1795, when he was but seventeen\r\nyears of age, he had himself become a good painter, and Washington\r\nthen honored him with three sittings of three hours each.  The\r\nyoung artist, who was naturally timid and nervous in such a presence\r\nand at such a work, got his father to begin a portrait at the same\r\ntime, and to keep the General in conversation while the work went\r\non.  The study of Washington's head then painted by Rembrandt Peale\r\nserved as the basis of the famous portrait of him which he afterward\r\npainted, and which was pronounced by contemporaries of Washington\r\nhis best likeness.  It was exhibited to admiring crowds in Europe\r\nand the United States, and in 1832 was purchased for two thousand\r\ndollars by the Federal Government, to be hung in the Capitol.\r\n\r\nRev. Charles W. Upham, who represented the Essex district of\r\nMassachusetts in Congress, was at one time a victim to our copyright\r\nlaws.  He had compiled with care a life of George Washington, from\r\nhis own letters, which was, therefore, in some sense, an autobiography.\r\nThe holders of copyright in Washington's letters, including, if I\r\nam not mistaken, Judge Washington and Dr. Sparks, considered the\r\npublication of this book by Marsh, Capen & Lyons, of Boston, who\r\nhad no permission from them, as an infringement of their copyright.\r\nThe curious question thus presented was tried before Judge Story,\r\nwho held that it was an infringement, and granted an injunction\r\nagainst the sale of the book.  The plates, thus becoming worthless\r\nhere, were sold to an English house, which printed them.\r\n\r\nJullien, the great musician, gave two concerts at the National\r\nTheatre, Washington, in the fall of 1853, with his large orchestra\r\nand a galaxy of glorious stars.  The effect of many of their\r\nperformances was overpowering, and the enraptured multitude often\r\nfor a moment appeared to forget their accustomed restraints, and\r\narose to wave their scarfs or hats in triumph, or blended their\r\nshouts of applause with the concluding strains of the \"Quadrille\r\nNationale,\" and other entrancing pieces.  The solos were all\r\nmagnificent and the entire performance was a triumphant success.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Thaddeus Stevens\r\nTHADDEUS STEVENS was born at Peacham, Vermont, April 4th, 1792;\r\nwas a Representative from Pennsyvlania, December 3d, 1849, to March\r\n1st, 1853, and again December 5th, 1859, to August 11th, 1868, when\r\nhe died at Washington City.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nCHIVALRY, AT HOME AND ABROAD.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce, seconded by Secretary Marcy, made his foreign\r\nappointments with great care.  Mr. Buchanan was sent as Minister\r\nto the Court of St. James, a position for which he was well qualified,\r\nand John Y. Mason, of Virginia, was accredited to France.  The\r\nsupport given to the Democratic party by the adopted citizens of\r\nthe Republic was acknowledged by the appointment of Mr. Soule, a\r\nFrenchman, who had been expelled from his native land as a\r\nrevolutionist, as Minister to Spain; Robert Dale Owen, an Englishman,\r\nnoted for his agrarian opinions, as Minister to Naples, and Auguste\r\nBelmont, Austrian born, Minister to the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe civil appointments, of every official grade, large in their\r\nnumber and extended in their influence upon various localities and\r\ninterests, were made with distinguished ability and sagacity, and\r\nwere received with general and widespread satisfaction.  The\r\nPresident's thorough knowledge of men, his intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the relations of sections heretofore temporarily separated\r\nfrom the great mass of the Democracy, and his quick perception of\r\nthe ability and character essential to the faithful performance of\r\nduty were active throughout, and he kept constantly in sight his\r\navowed determination to unite the Democratic party upon the principles\r\nby which he won his election.  Where so many distinguished names\r\nwere presented for his consideration, and where disappointment was\r\nthe inevitable fate of large numbers, a degree of complaint was\r\nunavoidable.  But no sooner was the fund of Executive patronage\r\nwell-nigh exhausted than might be heard, \"curses, not loud but\r\ndeep.\"  Presently, as the number of disappointed place-hunters\r\nincreased, the tide of indignation began to swell, and the chorus\r\nof discontent grew louder and louder, until the whole land was\r\nfilled with the clamors of a multitudinous army of martyrs.  For\r\nthe first three months after the inauguration the Democratic party\r\nwas a model of decorum, harmony, and contentment.  All was delight\r\nand enthusiasm.  Frank Pierce was the man of the time; his Cabinet\r\nwas an aggregation of the wisdom of the country; his policy the\r\nvery perfection of statesmanship.  Even the Whigs did not utter\r\none word of discontent.  Frank Pierce was still President, his\r\nCabinet unchanged, his policy the same, but all else, how changed!\r\nBut it was no fault of his.  He had but fifty thousand offices to\r\ndispense, which, in the nature of things, could go but a short way\r\nto appease the hunger of two hundred thousand applicants.  For\r\nevery appointment there were two disappointments, for every friend\r\nsecured he made two enemies.  A state of universal satisfaction\r\nwas succeeded by a state of violent discontent, and the Administration,\r\nwithout any fault of its own, encountered the opposition of those\r\nwho but a few weeks previously were loudest in its praise.\r\n\r\nIn order to re-enlist public favor and to reunite the Democratic\r\nparty, Messrs. Buchanan, Mason, and Soule, United States Ministers\r\nrespectively to England, France, and Spain, were ordered by the\r\nPresident, through Mr. Marcy, to meet at Ostend.  There, after\r\nmature deliberations, and in obedience to instruction from Washington,\r\nthey prepared, signed, and issued a brief manifesto, declaring that\r\nthe United States ought to purchase Cuba with as little delay as\r\npossible.  Political, commercial, and geographical reasons therefor\r\nwere given, and it was asserted in conclusion that \"the Union can\r\nnever enjoy repose, nor possess reliable security, so long as Cuba\r\nis not embraced within its boundaries.\"  This was carrying out the\r\nviews of Mr. Buchanan, who, when Secretary of State, in June, 1848,\r\nhad, under the instructions of President Polk, offered Spain one\r\nhundred million of dollars for the island.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan had accepted the mission to England, that he might\r\nfrom a distance pull every available wire to secure the nomination\r\nin 1856, coyly denying all the time that he wanted to be President.\r\nIn a heretofore unpublished letter of his, dated September 5th,\r\n1853, which is in my collection of autographs, he says:  \"You\r\npropounded a question to me before I left the United States which\r\nI have not answered.  I shall now give it an answer in perfect\r\nsincerity, without the slightest mental reservation.  I have neither\r\nthe desire nor the intention again to become a candidate for the\r\nPresidency.  On the contrary, this mission is tolerable to me alone\r\nbecause it will enable me gracefully and gradually to retire from\r\nan active participation in party politics.  Should it please\r\nProvidence to prolong my days and restore me to my native land, I\r\nhope to pass the remnant of my life at Wheatland, in comparative\r\npeace and tranquillity.  This will be most suitable both to my age\r\n(now past sixty-two) and my inclinations.  But whilst these are\r\nthe genuine sentiments of my heart, I do not think I ought to say\r\nthat in no imaginable state of circumstances would I consent to be\r\nnominated as a candidate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan was greatly exercised over the court costume which he\r\nwas to wear, and finally compromised by adopting a black evening\r\ndress suit, with the addition of a small sword, which distinguished\r\nhim from the servants at the royal palace.  He had always been\r\njealous of Governor Marcy, then Secretary of State, and instead of\r\naddressing his despatches to the Department of State, as is customary\r\nfor foreign Ministers, he used to send them directly to the President.\r\nIt is said that General Pierce rather enjoyed seeing his chief\r\nCabinet officer thus snubbed, and that he used to answer Mr.\r\nBuchanan's communications himself.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and to\r\nadmit Kansas and Nebraska as States, with or without slavery, as\r\ntheir citizens might respectively elect, gave rise to exciting\r\ndebates.  The North was antagonistic to the South, and the champions\r\nof freedom looked defiantly at the defenders of slavery.  One of\r\nthe most exciting scenes in the House of Representatives was between\r\nMr. John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Mr. Francis B. Cutting,\r\na New York lawyer, who had defeated Mr. James Brooks, who then was\r\neditor of the _Express_.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting was advocating the passage of the Senate bill, and\r\ncomplaining that the friends of the Administration not only wanted\r\nto consign it to the Committee of the Whole--that tomb of the\r\nCapulets--but they had encouraged attacks in their organs upon him\r\nand those who stood with him.  Mr. Breckinridge interrupted him\r\nwhile he was speaking, to ask if a remark made was personal to\r\nhimself, but Mr. Cutting said that it was not.  Mr. Breckinridge,\r\ninterrupting Mr. Cutting a second time, said that while he did not\r\nwant to charge the gentleman from New York with having intentionally\r\nplayed the part of an assassin, he had said, and he could not now\r\ntake it back, that the act, to all intents, was like throwing one\r\narm around it in friendship, and stabbing it with the other--to\r\nkill the bill.  As to a statement by the gentleman that in the hour\r\nof his greatest need the \"Hards\" of New York had come to his\r\nassistance, he could not understand it, and asked for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\"I will give it,\" replied Mr. Cutting.  \"When, during the last\r\nCongressional canvass in Kentucky, it was intimated that the friends\r\nof the honorable Representative from the Lexington district needed\r\nassistance to accomplish his election, my friends in New York made\r\nup a subscription of some fifteen hundred dollars and transmitted\r\nit to Kentucky, to be employed for the benefit of the gentleman,\r\nwho is now the peer of Presidents and Cabinets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" exclaimed Mr. Breckinridge, springing to his feet, \"and\r\nnot only the peer of Presidents and Cabinets, but the peer of the\r\ngentleman from New York, fully and in every respect.\"\r\n\r\nA round of applause followed this assertion, and ere it had subsided\r\nthe indomitable Mike Walsh availed himself of the opportunity to\r\ngive his colleague a rap.  \"When [he said] we came here we protested\r\nagainst the Administration interfering in the local affairs of the\r\nState of New York, and now my colleague states that a portion of\r\nhis constituents have been guilty of the same interference in the\r\naffairs of the people of Kentucky.\"  \"Is that all,\" said Mr. Cutting,\r\nin a sneering tone, \"that the gentleman from New York rose for?\"\r\n\"That's all,\" replied Mr. Walsh, \"but I will by on hand by and by,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Breckinridge, his eyes flashing fire, remarked in measured\r\ntones that the gentleman from New York should have known the truth\r\nof what he uttered before he pronounced it on the floor.  He (Mr.\r\nB.) was not aware that any intimations were sent from Kentucky that\r\nfunds were needed to aid in his election, nor was he aware that\r\nthey were received.  He did not undertake to say what the fact\r\nmight be in regard to what the gentleman had said, but he had no\r\ninformation whatever of that fact.  He (Mr. B.) came to Congress\r\nnot by the aid of money, but against the use of money.  The gentleman\r\ncould not escape by any subtlety or by any ingenuity a thorough\r\nand complete exposure of any ingenious device to which he might\r\nresort for the purpose of putting gentlemen in a false position,\r\nand the sooner he stopped that game the better.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutting, who was also very much excited, made an angry reply,\r\nin which he stated \"that he had given the gentleman an opportunity\r\nof indulging in one of the most violent, inflammatory, and personal\r\nassaults that had ever been known upon this floor; and he would\r\nask how could the gentleman disclaim any attack upon him.  The\r\nwhole tenor and scope of the speech of the gentleman from Kentucky\r\nwas an attack upon his motives in moving to commit the bill.  It\r\nwas in vain for the gentleman to attempt to escape it by disclaiming\r\nit; the fact was before the Committee.  But he would say to the\r\ngentleman that he scorned his imputation.  How dare the gentleman\r\nundertake to assert that he had professed friendship for the measure\r\nwith a view to kill it, to assassinate it by sending it to the\r\nbottom of the calendar?  And then, when he said that the Committee\r\nof the Whole had under its control the House bill upon this identical\r\nsubject, which the Committee intended to take up, discuss, amend,\r\nand report to the House, the gentleman skulked behind the Senate\r\nbill, which had been sent to the foot of the calendar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Skulked!\" hissed Mr. Breckinridge.  \"I ask the gentleman to withdraw\r\nthat word!\"\r\n\r\n\"I withdraw nothing!\" replied Mr. Cutting.  \"I have uttered what\r\nI have said in answer to one of the most violent and most personal\r\nattacks that has ever been witnessed upon this floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Breckinridge, \"when the gentleman says I skulked,\r\nhe says what is false!\"  The Southern members began to gather around\r\nthe excited Kentuckian, and the Speaker, pounding with his gavel,\r\npronounced the offensive remark out of order.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman,\" quietly remarked Mr. Cutting, \"I do not intend upon\r\nthis floor to answer the remark which the gentleman from Kentucky\r\nhas thought proper to employ.  It belongs to a different region.\r\nIt is not ere that I will desecrate my lips with undertaking to\r\nretort in that manner.\"\r\n\r\nThis settled the question, and a duel appeared to be inevitable.\r\nThe usual correspondence followed, but President Pierce and other\r\npotent friends of the would-be belligerents interfered, and the\r\ndifficult was amicably adjusted, under \"the code of honor,\" without\r\nrecourse to weapons.\r\n\r\nGovernor Marcy, President Pierce's Secretary of State, was a great\r\ncard-player, and Mr. Labouchere tells a good story which happened\r\nwhen he was Secretary of the British Legation at Washington.  \"I\r\nwent,\" said he, \"with the British Minister, to a pleasant watering-\r\nplace in Virginia, where we were to meet Mr. Marcy, the then United\r\nStates Secretary of State, and a reciprocity treaty between Canada\r\nand the United States was to be quietly discussed.  Mr. Marcy, the\r\nmost genial of men, was as cross as a bear.  He would agree to\r\nnothing.  'What on earth is the matter with your chief?' I said to\r\na secretary who accompanied him.  'He does not have his rubber of\r\nwhist,' answered the secretary.  After this every night the Minister\r\nand I played at whist with Mr. Marcy and his secretary, and every\r\nnight we lost.  The stakes were very trifling, but Mr. Marcy felt\r\nflattered by beating the Britishers at what he called their own\r\ngame.  His good humor returned, and every morning when the details\r\nof the treaty were being discussed we had our revenge, and scored\r\na few points for Canada.\"  A true account of the money designedly\r\nlost at Washington by diplomats, heads of departments, and Congressmen\r\nwould give a deep insight into the secret history of legislation.\r\nWhat Representative could vote against the claim of a man whose\r\nmoney he had been winning, in small sums, it is true, all winter?\r\n\r\nGeneral John A. Thomas, of New York, who was Assistant Secretary\r\nof State during a part of President Pierce's Administration, was\r\na fine, soldierly looking man, very gentlemanly in his deportment.\r\nHe was a native of Tennessee, and was for several years an officer\r\nin the United States Army, commanding at one time the corps of\r\ncadets.  He married a Miss Ronalds, who belonged to an old New York\r\nfamily, and he took her with him when he went abroad as Solicitor\r\nto the Board of Commissioners appointed by the President to adjust\r\nthe claims of American citizens upon the British Government.  Mr.\r\nBuchanan was the American Minister at the Court of St. James, and\r\nMr. Sickles Secretary of Legation.  Mrs. Thomas having expressed\r\na wish to be presented at court, Mr. Buchanan assented, and, when\r\nthe day for presentation arrived, requested Mrs. Thomas to place\r\nherself under the charge of Mrs. Sickles, who would accompany her\r\nto the palace of St. James.  This arrangement Mrs. Thomas decidedly\r\ndeclined, and by so doing gave so much offense to Mr. Buchanan that\r\nshe was never presented at court at all.  Nor did the matter end\r\nhere.  When Mr. Buchanan came to the Presidency he found General\r\nThomas filling the office of Assistant Secretary of State.  From\r\nthis office he immediately ejected him, for the old grudge he bore\r\nMrs. Thomas for refusing to go to court with Mrs. Sickles, as\r\nGeneral Thomas declared to his friends.  Mr. Buchanan was always\r\nvery fond of Mr. Sickles and his wife, and it was said that he\r\nnarrowly escaped being in the Sickles' house when Barton Key was\r\nshot down after coming from it.\r\n\r\nThe Amoskeag Veterans, of Manchester, New Hampshire, a volunteer\r\ncorps which wore the Continental uniform and marched to the music\r\nof drums and fifes, came to Washington to pay their respects to\r\nthe President, who received them with lavish hospitality.  They\r\nvisited Mount Vernon under escort of a detachment of volunteer\r\nofficers, and were escorted by the venerable G. W. P. Custis around\r\nthe old home of his illustrious relative.  At a ball given in the\r\nevening the \"old man eloquent\" wore the epaulettes originally\r\nfastened on his shoulders by him who was \"first in war, first in\r\npeace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\"  The sword given\r\nhim by General Washington Mr. Custis had presented to his son-in-\r\nlaw, Captain Robert E. Lee, of the Engineer Corps, during the\r\nMexican campaign.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John Tyler\r\nJOHN TYLER was born in Charles County, Virginia, March 29th, 1790;\r\nwas a Representative in Congress from Virginia, December 17th,\r\n1816, to March 3d, 1821; was United States Senator from Virginia,\r\nDecember 3d, 1827, to February 28th, 1836; was elected Vice-President\r\non the Harrison ticket in 1840; became President, after the death\r\nof President Harrison, April 4th, 1841; was a delegate to the Peace\r\nConvention of 1861, and its President; was a delegate to the\r\nProvisional Congress of the Confederate States, which assembled at\r\nRichmond in July, 1861; was elected a Representative from Virginia\r\nin the first Confederate Congress, but died at Richmond, Virginia,\r\nbefore taking his seat, January 17th, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nCRYSTALLIZATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise and the enactment of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law re-opened the flood-gates of sectional controversy.\r\nThe Native American organization was used at the North by the\r\nleading Abolitionists for the disintegration of the Whigs, and they\r\nfounded a new political party, with freedom inscribed upon its\r\nbanners.  The Free-Soil Democrats who had rebelled against Southern\r\nrule, with the Liberty Whigs, and those who were more openly arrayed\r\nagainst slavery, united, and were victorious at the Congressional\r\nelections in the Northern States in the autumn of 1854.  \"The moral\r\nidea became a practical force,\" and the \"Irrepressible Conflict\"\r\nwas commenced.  \"As Republicans,\" said Charles Sumner, \"we go forth\r\nto encounter the oligarchs of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe great contest was opened by a struggle in the House of\r\nRepresentatives over the Speakership.  Nathaniel Prentiss Banks,\r\na Democrat, who had joined the Know-Nothings, was the Northern\r\ncandidate, although Horace Greeley, with Thurlow Weed and William\r\nSchouler as his aides-de-camp, endeavored to elect Lewis D. Campbell,\r\nan Ohio American.  The Southern Know-Nothings voted at one time\r\nfor Henry M. Fuller, of Pennsylvania, but they dropped him like a\r\nhot potato when they learned that he had accepted a place on the\r\nRepublican Committee of his State.  William Aiken, a large slaveholder\r\nin South Carolina, was the favorite Southern candidate, although\r\nthe vote of the solid South was successively given to several\r\nothers.  Meanwhile, as day after day passed, the President's message\r\nwas withheld, and all legislation was at a dead-lock.  The Sergeant-\r\nat-Arms, Colonel Glossbrenner, an ex-member of the House, obtained\r\na loan of twenty thousand dollars from a bank in Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich enabled him to make advances to impecunious members of both\r\nparties, and thus to insure his re-election.\r\n\r\nEarly in January an attempt was made to \"sit it out,\" and all night\r\nthe excited House seethed like a boiling cauldron; verdant novices\r\nwere laughed down as they endeavored to make some telling point,\r\nwhile sly old stagers lay in ambush to spring out armed with \"points\r\nof order.\"  Emasculate conservatives were snubbed by followers of\r\nnew prophets; belligerent Southrons glared fiercely at phlegmatic\r\nYankees; one or two intoxicated Solons gabbled sillily upon every\r\nquestion, and sober clergymen gaped, as if sleepy and disgusted\r\nwith political life.  Banks, unequaled in his deportment, was as\r\ncool as a summer cucumber; Aiken, his principal opponent, was\r\ncourteous and gentlemanlike to all; Giddings wore a broad-brimmed\r\nhat to shield his eyes from the rays of the gas chandelier; Stephens,\r\nof Georgia, piped forth his shrill response, and Senator Wilson\r\nwent busily about \"whipping-in.\"  Soon after midnight the South\r\nAmericans began to relate their individual experience in true camp-\r\nmeeting style, the old-line Democrats were rampant, the few Whigs\r\nwere jubilant, and the bone of Catholicism was pretty will picked\r\nby those who had been peeping at politics through dark-lanterns,\r\nand who were \"know-nothings\" about what they had done.  In short,\r\nevery imaginable topic of discussion, in order or out of order,\r\nwas lugged in to kill time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the supply of ham at the eating-counter below-stairs was\r\nexhausted, the oysters were soon after minus, and those who had\r\nbrought no lunch had to mumble ginger-cakes.  It was remarked by\r\ngood judges that as the morning advanced the coffee grew weaker,\r\nsuggesting a possibility that the caterer could not distinguish\r\nbetween cocoa and cold water, and only replenished his boiler with\r\nthe latter.  There were more questions of order, more backing people\r\nup to vote, and an increase of confusion.  Men declared that they\r\nwould \"stick,\" while they entreated others to shift, and as daylight\r\nstreamed in upon the scene, the political gamesters had haggard\r\nand careworn countenances.  The result of the night's work was no\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nAt last, after nine long, tedious weeks, the agony was over, and\r\nMassachusetts furnished the Thirty-fourth Congress with its Speaker.\r\nAlthough what was termed \"Americanism\" played an important though\r\nconcealed part in the struggle, the real battle was between the\r\nNorth and the South--the stake was the extension of slavery.  When\r\nthe decisive vote was reached the galleries were packed with ladies,\r\nwho, like the gentle dames in the era of chivalry, sat interested\r\nlookers-on as the combating parties entered the arena.  On the one\r\nside was Mr. Aiken, a Representative from the chivalric, headstrong\r\nState of South Carolina, the son of an Irishman, the inheritor of\r\nan immense wealth, and the owner of eleven hundred slaves.  Opposed\r\nto him was Mr. Banks, of Massachusetts, a State which was the very\r\nantipodes of South Carolina in politics, who, by his own exertions,\r\nunaided by a lineage or wealth or anything save his own indomitable\r\nwill, had conquered a position among an eminently conservative\r\npeople.  Voting was commenced, and each minute seemed to be an age,\r\nas some members had to explain their votes, but at length the\r\ntellers began to \"foot up.\"  It had been agreed that the result\r\nshould be announced by the teller belonging to the party of the\r\nsuccessful candidate, and when the sheet was handed to Mr. Benson,\r\nof Maine, the \"beginning of the end\" was known.  Radiant with joy,\r\nhe announced that Nathaniel P. Banks, Jr., had received one hundred\r\nand three votes; William Aiken, one hundred; H. M. Fuller, six; L.\r\nD. Campbell, four; and Daniel Wells, Jr., of Wisconsin, one.  The\r\nelection was what a Frenchman would call an \"accomplished fact,\"\r\nand hearty cheers were heard on all sides.\r\n\r\nMagnanimity is not a prominent ingredient in political character,\r\nand some factious objections were made, by Mr. Aiken soon put a\r\nstop to them.  Rising with that dignity peculiar to wealthy and\r\nportly gentlemen of ripe years, he requested permission to conduct\r\nthe Speaker-elect to the chair.  This disarmed opposition, and\r\nafter some formalities, he was authorized, by a large majority\r\nresolve, to perform the duty, accompanied by Messrs. Fuller and\r\nCampbell.  Cheer after cheer, with waving of hats and ladies'\r\nhandkerchiefs, announced that on the one hundred and thirty-third\r\nvote the Speaker's chair was occupied.  The mace, emblem of the\r\nSpeaker's authority, was brought from its resting-place and elevated\r\nat his side.  The House was organized.\r\n\r\nThe address of Mr. Banks, free from all cant, and delicately alluding\r\nto those American principles to which he owed his office, was\r\nhappily conceived and admirably delivered.  Then old Father Giddings,\r\nstanding beneath the large chandelier, with his silvery locks\r\nflowing picturesquely around his head, held up his hand and\r\nadministered the oath of office.  The authoritative gavel was handed\r\nup by Colonel Forney, who was thanked by a resolution complimenting\r\nhim for the ability with which he had presided during the protracted\r\ncontest, and then the House adjourned.\r\n\r\nIt then became necessary to divide the spoils, and after an exciting\r\ncontest, Cornelius Wendell, a Democratic nominee, was elected\r\nPrinter of the House by Republican votes, in consideration of\r\ncertain percentages of his profits paid to designated parties.\r\nThe House binding was given to Mr. Williams, editor of the Toledo\r\n_Blade_, a lawyer by profession, who had never bound a book in his\r\nlife.  Mr. Robert Farnham paid him a considerable sum for his\r\ncontract, and the work was done by Mr. Tretler, a practical\r\nbookbinder.  Mr. Simon Hanscomb, who had been efficient in bringing\r\nabout the nomination of Mr. Banks, received a twelve-hundred dollar\r\nsinecure clerkship, and others who had aided in bringing about the\r\nresult were cared for.  One Massachusetts Representative had his\r\nyoung son appointed a page by the doorkeeper, but when Speaker\r\nBanks learned of it, he ordered the appointment to be canceled.\r\nLuckily for the lad, the father was enabled to secure for him an\r\nappointment as a cadet at West Point, and he became a gallant\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Thirty-fourth Congress was protracted\r\nuntil the 18th of August, 1856, and it was distinguished by\r\nacrimonious debate.  The most remarkable speaker was Mr. Stephens,\r\nof Georgia, of whom it might be said, as of St. Paul, \"his bodily\r\npresence is weak,\" while his shrill, thin voice, issuing as it were\r\nby jerks from his narrow chest, recalled John Randolph.  Contrasting\r\nwidely in size was the burly Humphrey Marshall, of Kentucky, who\r\nhad won laurels in the Mexican War, as had the gallant General\r\nQuitman, a Representative from Mississippi.  Henry Winter Davis,\r\nof Baltimore, and Anson Burlingame, of Boston, were the most eloquent\r\nand enthusiastic of those who had been washed into Congress by the\r\nKnow-Nothing wave, and with them had come some ignorant and bigoted\r\nfellows.  Equally prominent, but better qualified, on the other\r\nside was John Kelly, who had defeated the candidates brought out\r\nby \"Sam\" and \"Sambo\" to oppose him.  The venerable Joshua R.\r\nGiddings, of Ohio, who led the abolition forces, was as austerely\r\nbitter as Cato was in ancient Utica when he denounced the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, under the operations of which many runaway slaves were\r\ncaptured at the North and returned to their Southern masters.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Mr. Clingman, who represented North Carolina, was\r\nalternately enlivened by epigrammatic wit or envenomed by scorching\r\nreply.  Mr. Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont, was commencing a long\r\nand useful Congressional career.  Mr. Schuyler Colfax, an editor-\r\npolitician, represented an Indiana district.  The veteran Mr.\r\nCharles J. Faulkner, with his choleric son-in-law, Mr. Thomas S.\r\nBocock, and the erratic and chivalrous Judge Caskie, represented\r\nVirginia districts.  Mr. Elihu B. Washburne, of Illinois, sat near\r\nhis brother, Israel D. Washburne, of Maine.  Mr. Lyman Trumbull,\r\nof Illinois, was then an ardent Republican, and so was Mr. Francis\r\nE. Spinner, of New York, whose wonderful autograph afterward graced\r\npublic securities.\r\n\r\nMr. Albert Rust, one of the Representatives from Arkansas, won some\r\nnotoriety by attacking Horace Greeley at his hotel.  The next day\r\nhe was brought before Justice Morsell, and gave bonds to appear at\r\nthe next session of the Criminal Court.  He appeared to glory in\r\nwhat he had done.  Mr. Greeley was evidently somewhat alarmed, and\r\nduring the remainder of his sojourn at Washington his more stalwart\r\nfriends took care that he should not be unaccompanied by a defender\r\nwhen he appeared in public.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Utah was represented in the House by Mr. John N.\r\nBurnhisel, a small, dapper gentleman, who in deportment and tone\r\nof voice resembled Robert J. Walker.  It was very rarely that he\r\nparticipated in debate, and his forte was evidently taciturnity.\r\nIn private conversation he was fluent and agreeable, defending the\r\npeculiar domestic institutions of his people.  The delegate from\r\nOregon was Mr. Joseph Lane, who had served bravely in the Mexican\r\nwar, gone to Oregon as its first Governor, and been returned as\r\nits first Territorial Delegate.  He was a keen-eyed, trimly built\r\nman, of limited education, but the possessor of great common sense.\r\nHenry M. Rice, the first Delegate from the Territory of Minnesota,\r\nhad been for years an Indian trader in connection with the American\r\nFur Company, and was thoroughly acquainted with the people he\r\nrepresented, and whose interests he faithfully served.  New Mexico,\r\nthen a _terra incognita_, was represented by Don Jose Manuel\r\nGallegos, a native of the Territory, who had been educated in the\r\nCatholic schools of Mexico, and who was devoted to the Democratic\r\nparty.  He had as a rival Don Miguel A. Otero, also a native of\r\nNew Mexico, who had been educated at St. Louis, and whose Democracy\r\nwas of the more liberal school.  He successfully contested the seat\r\nof Mr. Gallegos in the Thirty-fourth Congress, and secured his re-\r\nelection in the two ensuing ones.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was behind the House in entering into the \"irrepressible\r\nconflict.\"  The death of Vice-President King having left the chair\r\nof the presiding officer vacant, it was filled _pro tempore_ by\r\nMr. Jesse D. Bright, of Indiana.  He was a man of fine presence,\r\nfair abilities, and a fluent speaker, thoroughly devoted to the\r\nDemocratic party as then controlled by the South.  He regarded the\r\nanti-slavery movement as the offspring of a wanton desire to meddle\r\nwith the affairs of other people, and to grasp political power, or\r\n--to use the words of one who became an ardent Republican--as the\r\nproduct of hypocritical selfishness, assuming the mask and cant of\r\nphilanthropy merely to rob the South and to enrich New England.\r\nThe rulings of the Chair, while it was occupied by Senator Bright,\r\nwere all in favor of the South and of the compromises which had\r\nbeen entered into.  The Secretary of the Senate, its Sergeant-at-\r\nArms, its door-keepers, messengers, and even its little pages, were\r\nsubservient to the South.\r\n\r\nMr. James Murray Mason, a type of the old patrician families of\r\nVirginia, was one of the few remaining polished links between the\r\nstatesmen of those days and of the past.  His first ancestor in\r\nVirginia, George Mason, commanded a regiment of cavalry in the\r\nCavalier army of Charles Stuart (afterward Charles II) in the\r\ncampaign against the Roundhead troops of Oliver Cromwell.  After\r\nthe defeat of the royal forces at the battle of Worcester, Colonel\r\nMason escaped to Virginia, and soon afterward established a plantation\r\non the Potomac, where his lineal descendants resided generation\r\nafter generation.  The future Senator was educated at Georgetown,\r\nin the then infant days of the Federal city, and the society of\r\nsuch statesmen as then sat in the councils of the republic was in\r\nitself an education.  He possessed a stalwart figure, a fine,\r\nimposing head covered with long gray hair, a pleasing countenance,\r\nand a keen eye.  No Senator had a greater reverence for the peculiar\r\ninstitutions of the South, or a more thorough contempt for the\r\nAbolitionists of the North.  His colleague, Mr. Robert M. T. Hunter,\r\nwas of less aristocratic lineage, but had received a more thorough\r\neducation.  He had served in the Twenty-sixth Congress as Speaker\r\nof the House, and he was thoroughly acquainted with parliamentary\r\nlaw and usages.  He had also paid great attention to finance and\r\nto the tariff questions.  Solidly built, with a massive head and\r\na determined manner, he was very impressive in debate, and his\r\nspeeches on financial questions were listened to with great\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Hale was a prominent figure in the Senate, and never failed\r\nto command attention.  The keen shafts of the Southerners, aimed\r\nat him, fell harmlessly to his feet, and his wonderful good nature\r\ndisarmed malicious opposition.  Those who felt that he had gone\r\nfar astray in his political opinions did not accuse him of selfish\r\nmotives, sordid purposes, or degraded intrigues.  His was the\r\n\"chasseur\" style of oratory--now skirmishing on the outskirts of\r\nan opponent's position, then rallying on some strange point, pouring\r\nin a rattling fire, standing firm against a charge, and ever\r\ndisplaying a perfect independence of action and a disregard of\r\npartisan drill.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce felt very unkindly toward Mr. Hale.  At an evening\r\nreception, when the Senator from New Hampshire approached, escorting\r\nhis wife and daughters, the President spoke to the ladies, but\r\ndeliberately turned his back upon Mr. Hale.  This action by one so\r\ncourteous as was General Pierce created much comment, and was the\r\nsubject of earnest discussion in drawing-rooms as well as at the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Lewis Cass\r\nLEWIS CASS was born at Exeter, New Hampshire, October 9th, 1782;\r\ncrossed the Allegheny Mountains on foot when seventeen years of\r\nage to Ohio, where he commenced the practice of law; was colonel\r\nof the Third Ohio Volunteers, which was a part of General Hull's\r\narmy, surrendered at Detroit, August 16th, 1812; was Governor of\r\nMichigan Territory, 1813-1831; was Secretary of War under President\r\nJackson, 1831-1836; was Minister to France, October 4th, 1836, to\r\nNovember 12th, 1842; was United States Senator from Michigan,\r\nDecember 1st, 1845, to May 29th, 1848; was defeated as the Democratic\r\ncandidate for President in the fall of 1848; was elected to fill\r\nthe vacancy in the Senate, occasioned by his own resignation,\r\nDecember 3d, 1849, to March 3d, 1857; was Secretary of State under\r\nPresident Buchanan, March 4th, 1857, to December 17th, 1860, when\r\nhe resigned; retired to Detroit, Michigan, where he died, June\r\n17th, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nPOLITICAL STORM AND SOCIAL SUNSHINE.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner had not spoken on the slavery question immediately\r\non taking his seat in the Senate, and some of his abolition friends\r\nin Boston had began to fear that he, too, had been enchanted by\r\nthe Circe of the South.  Theodore Parker said, in a public speech:\r\n\"I wish he had spoken long ago, but it is for him to decide, not\r\nus.  'A fool's bolt is soon shot,' while a wise man often reserves\r\nhis fire.\"  But Senator Seward, who had been taught by experience\r\nhow far a Northern man could go in opposition to the slave-power,\r\nadvised him that \"retorted scorn\" would be impolitic and perhaps\r\nunsafe.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner, however, soon began to occupy the floor of the Senate\r\nChamber when he could get an opportunity.  His speeches were able\r\nand exhaustive disquisitions, polished and repolished before their\r\ndelivery, and arraigning the South in stately and measured sentences\r\nwhich contained stinging rebukes.  The boldness of his language\r\nsoon attracted public attention, and secured his recognition as\r\nthe chosen champion of Freedom.  One afternoon, while he was\r\nspeaking, Senator Douglas, walking up and down behind the President's\r\nchair in the old Senate Chamber and listening to him, remarked to\r\na friend:  \"Do you hear that man?  He may be a fool, but I tell\r\nyou that man has pluck.  I wonder whether he knows himself what he\r\nis doing?  I am not sure whether I should have the courage to say\r\nthose things to the men who are scowling around him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was at that time strikingly prepossessing in his\r\nappearance:\r\n\r\n  \"Not that his dress attracted vulgar eyes,\r\n   With Fashion's gewgaws flauntingly display'd;\r\n   He had the bearing of the gentleman;\r\n   And nobleness of mind illumined his mien,\r\n   Winning at once attention and respect.\"\r\n\r\nHe was over six feet in stature, with a broad chest and graceful\r\nmanners.  His features, though not perhaps strictly regular, were\r\nclassical, and naturally of an animated cast; his hazel eyes were\r\nsomewhat inflamed by night-work; he wore no beard, except a small\r\npair of side-whiskers, and his black hair lay in masses over his\r\nhigh forehead.  I do not remember to have ever seen two finer-\r\nlooking men in Washington than Charles Sumner and Salmon P. Chase,\r\nas they came together to a dinner-party at the British Legation,\r\neach wearing a blue broadcloth dress-coat with gilt buttons, a\r\nwhite waistcoat, and black trowsers.\r\n\r\nThe conservative Senators soon treated Mr. Sumner as a fanatic\r\nunfit to associate with them, and they refused him a place on any\r\ncommittee, as \"outside of any political organization.\"  This\r\nstimulated him in the preparation of a remarkable arraignment of\r\nthe slave-power, which he called the \"crime against Kansas.\"  It\r\nwas confidentially printed before its delivery that advance copies\r\nmight be sent to distant cities, and nearly every one permitted to\r\nread it, including Mr. William H. Seward, advised Mr. Sumner to\r\ntone down its offensive features.  But he refused.  He was not, as\r\nhis friend Carl Schurz afterward remarked, \"conscious of the stinging\r\nforce of the language he frequently employed, . . . and he was not\r\nunfrequently surprised, greatly surprised, when others found his\r\nlanguage offensive.\"  He delivered the speech as it had been written\r\nand printed, occupying two days, and he provoked the Southern\r\nSenators and their friends beyond measure.\r\n\r\nPreston S. Brooks, a tall, fine-looking Representative from South\r\nCarolina, who had served gallantly in the Mexican war, was incited\r\nto revenge certain phrases used by Mr. Sumner, which he was told\r\nreflected upon his uncle, Senator Butler.  Entering the Senate\r\nChamber one day after the adjournment, he went up to Mr. Sumner,\r\nwho sat writing at his desk, with his head down, and dealt him\r\nseveral severe blows in the back of his head with a stout gutta-\r\npercha cane as he would have cut at him right and left with a\r\ndragoon's broadsword.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's long legs were stretched beneath his desk, so that he\r\nwas pinioned when he tried to rise, and the blood from his wound\r\non his head blinded him.  In his struggle he wrenched the desk from\r\nthe floor, to which it had been screwed, but before he could gain\r\nhis feet his assailant had gratified his desire to punish him.\r\nSeveral persons had witnessed this murderous assault without\r\ninterfering, and when Mr. Sumner, stunned and bleeding, was led to\r\na sofa in the anteroom, Mr. Brooks was congratulated on what he\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nFor two years Mr. Sumner was a great sufferer, but the people of\r\nMassachusetts, recognizing him as their champion, kept his empty\r\nchair in the Senate ready for him to occupy again when he became\r\nconvalescent.  A chivalrous sympathy for him as he endured the\r\ncruel treatment prescribed by modern science contributed to his\r\nfame, and he became the leading champion of liberty in the impending\r\nconflict for freedom.  Mr. Seward regarded the situation with a\r\ncomplacent optimism, Mr. Hale good-naturedly joked with the Southern\r\nSenators, and Mr. Chase drifted along with the current, all of them\r\nadorning but not in any way shaping the tide of events.  With Mr.\r\nSumner it was different, for he possessed that root of statesmanship\r\n--the power of forethought.  Although incapacitated for Senatorial\r\nduties, his earnest words, like the blast of a trumpet, echoed\r\nthrough the North, and he was recognized as the martyr-leader of\r\nthe Republican party.  The injury to his nervous system was great,\r\nbut the effect of Brooks' blows upon the slave-holding system was\r\nstill more injurious.  Before Mr. Sumner had resumed his seat both\r\nSenator Butler and Representative Brooks had passed away.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House of Representatives on a resolution censuring\r\nMr. Brooks for his murderous attack (followed by his resignation\r\nand unanimous re-election) was marked by acrimonious altercations,\r\nwith threats of personal violence by the excited Southerners, who\r\nfound themselves on the defensive.  Henry Wilson and other Northern\r\nCongressmen went about armed with revolvers, and gave notice that\r\nwhile they would not fight duels, they would defend themselves if\r\nattacked.  Mr. Anson Burlingame, who had come from Michigan to\r\ncomplete his studies at Harvard College, married the daughter of\r\na wealthy Boston merchant, and had been elected to Congress by the\r\nKnow-Nothings and Abolitionists, accepted a challenge from Mr.\r\nBrooks.  He selected the Clifton House, on the Canadian shore of\r\nNiagara Falls, as the place of meeting, which the friends of Mr.\r\nBrooks declared was done that the duel could not take place, as\r\nMr. Brooks could not pass through the Northern States, where he\r\nwas so universally hated.  Mr. Lewis D. Campbell, who was Mr.\r\nBurlingame's second, repelled this insinuation, and was confident\r\nthat his principal \"meant business.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of President Pierce, Congress created\r\nthe rank of Lieutenant-General, and General Scott received the\r\nappointment.  He established his head-quarters at Washington, and\r\nappeared on several occasions in full uniform riding a spirited\r\ncharger.  Colonel Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War, and \"Old\r\nChapultepec,\" as Scott was familiarly called by army officers, did\r\nnot get along harmoniously, and the President invariably sided with\r\nhis Secretary of War.  Mr. Seward, meanwhile, busily availed himself\r\nof the opportunity to alienate General Scott from his Southern\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWhile the Northern and Southern politicians \"bit their thumbs\" at\r\neach other, the followers and the opponents of Senator Douglas in\r\nthe Democratic ranks became equally hostile, and in some instances\r\nbelligerent.  I was then the associate editor of the _Evening Star_,\r\na lively local sheet owned and edited by Mr. Douglas Wallach.\r\nWalking along Pennsylvania Avenue one afternoon, I saw just before\r\nme Mr. Wallach engaged in an excited controversy with an elderly\r\ngentleman, who I afterward learned was Mr. \"Extra Billy\" Smith, an\r\nex-Representative in Congress, who had grown rich by the extra\r\nallowances made to him as a mail contractor.  Each was calling the\r\nother hard names in a loud tone of voice, and as I reached them\r\nthey clinched, wrestled for a moment, and then Smith threw Wallach\r\nheavily to the sidewalk.  Sitting on his prostrate foe, Smith began\r\nto pummel him, but at the first blow Wallach got one of his\r\nantagonist's thumbs into his mouth, where he held it as if it were\r\nin a vise.  Smith roared, \"Let go my thumb! you are eating it to\r\nthe bone!\"  Just then up came Mr. Keitt, of South Carolina, and\r\nMr. Bocock, of Virginia, who went to the rescue of Smith, Keitt\r\nsaying:  \"This is no way for gentlemen to settle their disputes,\"\r\nas he forced Wallach's jaws apart, to release the \"chawed-up\" thumb.\r\nWallach was uninjured, but for several weeks he went heavily armed,\r\nexpecting that Smith would attack him.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. McMullen, of Virginia, in advocating the passage of a\r\nbill, alluded to some previous remarks of the gentleman from Ohio,\r\nnot the one (Mr. Giddings) \"who bellowed so loudly,\" he said, \"but\r\nto his sleek-headed colleague\" (Mr. Taylor).  Mr. Taylor, who was\r\nentering the hall just as this allusion was made to him, replied\r\nthat the would rather have a sleek head than a blockhead.\r\n\r\nMr. McMullen then said:  \"I intended nothing personally offensive,\r\nwhich no one ought to have known better than the gentleman himself.\r\nI made use of the remark at which the gentleman exhibited an undue\r\ndegree of excitement to produce a little levity; neither of us\r\nought to complain of our heads.  If united, there would not be more\r\nbrains than enough for one common head.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Jones, of Tennessee, generally called \"Lean Jimmy Jones,\"\r\nwas the only Democrat who ever tried to meet Mr. John P. Hale with\r\nhis own weapons--ridicule and sarcasm.  One day, after having been\r\nworsted in a verbal tilt, Mr. Jones sought revenge by telling a\r\nstory as illustrating his opponent's adroitness.  There was a\r\nKentuckian, he said, whose name was Sam Wilson, who settled on the\r\nmargin of the Mississippi River.  He had to settle upon high lands,\r\nnear swamps from ten to twenty miles wide.  The swamps were filled\r\nwith wild hogs, which were considered a species of public property\r\nthat every man had a right to shoot, but they did not have a right\r\nthereby to shoot tame ones.\r\n\r\nSam had a very large family, and was known to entertain a mortal\r\naversion to work.  Yet he always lived well and had plenty of meat.\r\nIt was inquired how Sam had always so much to eat?  Nobody saw him\r\nwork.  He used to hunt and walk about, and he had plenty of bacon\r\nconstantly on hand.  People began to suspect that Sam was not only\r\nshooting wild hogs, but sometimes tame ones; so they watched him\r\na good deal to see whether they could not catch him.  Sam, however,\r\nwas too smart for them, and always evaded, just (said Mr. Jones)\r\nas the honorable Senator from New Hampshire does.  Finally, old\r\nman Bailey was walking out one day looking after his hogs at the\r\nedge of the swamp, and he saw Sam going along quietly with his gun\r\non his shoulder.  Presently Sam's rifle was fired.  Bailey walked\r\non to the cane-brake, as he knew he had a very fine hog there, and\r\nlooking over he found Sam in the act of drawing out his knife to\r\nbutcher it.  Old man Bailey, slapping Sam on the shoulder, said,\r\n\"I have caught you at last.\"  \"Caught thunder!\" said Sam; \"I will\r\nshoot all your blasted hogs that come biting at me in this way.\"\r\n\"That is the way,\" Senator Jones went on to say, \"that the Senator\r\nfrom New Hampshire gets out of his scrapes.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierce came to the White House sorrow-stricken by the sad\r\ndeath of her only child, but she bravely determined not to let her\r\nprivate griefs prevent the customary entertainments.  During the\r\nsessions of Congress there was a state dinner once a week, to which\r\nthirty-six guests were invited, and on other week-days half-a-dozen\r\nguests partook of the family dinner, at which no wine was served.\r\nThere was also a morning and an evening reception every week in\r\nthe season, at which Mrs. Pierce, dressed in deep mourning, received\r\nwith the President.\r\n\r\nThe evening receptions, which were equivalent to the drawing-rooms\r\nof foreign courts, were looked forward to with great interest by\r\nstrangers and the young people, taxing the busy fingers of mantua-\r\nmakers, while anxious fathers reluctantly loosened their purse-\r\nstrings.  Carriages and camelias were thenceforth in demand; white\r\nkid gloves were kept on the store counters; and hair-dressers wished\r\nthat, like the fabulous monster, they could each have a hundred\r\nhands capable of wielding the curling-tongs.  When the evening\r\narrived, hundreds of carriages might be seen hastening toward the\r\nspacious portico of the White House, under which they drove and\r\nsat down their freights.  In Europe, it would have required at\r\nleast a battalion of cavalry to have preserved order, but in\r\nWashington the coaches quietly fell into the file, and patiently\r\nawaited their turn.  At the door, the ladies turned into the private\r\ndining-room, used as a dressing-room, from whence they soon emerged,\r\nnearly all of them in the full glory of evening toilet and radiant\r\nwith smiles.  Falling into line, the visitors passed into the\r\nparlors, where they were received by President Pierce and his wife.\r\nBetween the President and the door stood District Marshal Hoover\r\nand one of his deputies, who inquired the name of each unknown\r\nperson, and introduced each one successively to the President.\r\nThe names of strangers were generally misunderstood, and they were\r\nre-baptized, to their annoyance, but President Pierce, with winning\r\ncordiality, shook hands with each one, and put them directly at\r\nease, chatting pleasantly until some one else came along, when he\r\nintroduced them to his wife.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Presidential group and traversing the beautiful Green\r\nDrawing-room, the guests entered the famed East Room, which was\r\nfilled with the talent, beauty, and fashion of the metropolis.\r\nHundreds of either sex occupied the middle of the room or congregated\r\naround its walls, which enshrined a maelstrom of beauty, circling\r\nand ever changing, like the figures in a kaleidoscope.  A prominent\r\nfigure in these scenes was Edward Everett, cold-blooded and\r\nimpassible, bright and lonely as the gilt weather-cock over the\r\nchurch in which he officiated ere he became a politician.  John\r\nVan Buren--\"Prince John\"--he was called--was another notable, his\r\nconversation having the double charm of seeming to be thoroughly\r\nenjoyed by the speaker and at the same time to delight the hearer.\r\nGeneral Scott, in full uniform, was the beau ideal of a military\r\nhero, and with him were other brave officers of the army and of\r\nthe navy, each one having his history ashore or afloat.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Diplomatic Corps were marked by the crosses and\r\nribbons which they wore at their buttonholes.  Mr. Crampton, who\r\nrepresented Queen Victoria, was a noble specimen of the fine old\r\nEnglish gentleman, personally popular, although he did not get\r\nalong well with Secretary Marcy.  The Count de Sartiges, who had\r\nrecently married Miss Thorndike, of Boston, was an embodiment of\r\nFrench character, as Baron Von Geroldt was of the Prussian, and\r\nthe little Kingdom of Belgium had its diplomatist in the august\r\nperson of Monsieur Henri Bosch Spencer.  Senor Don Calderon de la\r\nBarca, the Spanish Minister, was very popular, as was his gifted\r\nwife, so favorably known to American literature.  As for the South\r\nAmerican Republics, their representatives were generally well\r\ndressed and able to put a partner through a polka in a manner\r\ngratifying to her and to her anxious mamma.\r\n\r\nThen there were the office-seekers, restless, anxious, yet confident\r\nof obtaining some place of profit; the office-holders, many of whom\r\nsaw in passing events the handwriting on the wall which announced\r\ntheir dismissal; the verdant visitors who had come to Washington\r\nto see how the country was governed; and generally a score of\r\nIndians with gay leggings, scarlet blankets, pouches worked with\r\nporcupine quills, and the full glory of war paint.  The Marine Band\r\ndiscoursed sweet music, but no refreshments were offered, so, many\r\nof the gentlemen, after having escorted the ladies to their homes,\r\nrepaired to the restaurants, where canvas-back ducks, wild turkeys,\r\nand venison steaks were discussed, with a running fire of champagne\r\ncorks and comments on the evening.\r\n\r\nSecretary McClelland's series of evening receptions were thronged\r\nwith the elite of the South, and at Secretary Guthrie's one could\r\nsee the majestic belles of Kentucky.  The finest diplomatic\r\nentertainment was given by the Brazilian Minister, in honor of the\r\nbirthday of his imperial master, and the evenings when Madame\r\nCalderon de la Barca was \"at home\" always found her attractive\r\ndrawing-rooms crowded.  General Almonte, the Mexican Minister, was\r\nnoted for his breakfast-parties, as was Senor Marcoleta, of Nicaragua,\r\nwho was trying hard to have an interoceanic canal cut through his\r\ncountry.  Among the Congressmen, Governor Aiken, of South Carolina,\r\ngave the most elegant entertainments, at which the supper-table\r\nwas ornamented with a silver service, \"looted\" in after years by\r\nsoldiers, with the exception of a large solid silver waiter, which\r\nwas found in a swamp, propped up on four stones, and with a fire\r\nunder it, some deserters having used it to fry bacon in.  A gloom\r\nwas cast over this gay society, however, by the sad fate of the\r\nwife of Mr. Justice Daniels, of the Supreme Court, whose clothes\r\naccidentally took fire, and burned her so terribly that she survived\r\nbut a few hours.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Gš:Washington\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON was born February 22d, 1732, in Westmoreland\r\nCounty, Va.; was public Surveyor when sixteen years of age; when\r\nnineteen was Military Inspector of one of the districts of Virginia;\r\nparticipated in the French and Indian war, 1753; Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Colonial forces in 1755; married Mrs. Martha Custis, 1759;\r\nmember of the Continental Congress, 1774; Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Continental forces, 1775; resigned command, December 23d, 1783;\r\nPresident of the United States, April 30th, 1789, to March 4th,\r\n1797; died at Mount Vernon, December 14th, 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nGROWTH OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing conceived the idea of getting up a difficulty with\r\nGreat Britain, as likely to advance the prospects of President\r\nPierce for re-election, and to divert the attention of the people\r\nfrom the anti-slavery question.  The pretext was the recruiting in\r\nthe United States, under the direction of the British diplomatic\r\nand consular representatives of the Crown, of men for the regiments\r\nengaged in the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nMr. Crampton, the British Minister, was a large, well-built man,\r\nwith white hair and side whiskers, courtly manners and great\r\nconversational powers.  His father had been a celebrated surgeon\r\nin Ireland, from whom he afterward inherited considerable property.\r\nHe lived at Carolina Place, on Georgetown Heights, in good style,\r\nentertained liberally, rather cultivated the acquaintance of American\r\nartists and journalists, and was often seen going on an angling\r\nexpedition to the Great Falls of the Potomac.  He undoubtedly\r\ndirected the objectionable recruiting without the slightest diplomatic\r\nskill.  He seemed to go to work in the roughest and rudest manner\r\nto violate our laws, as if he did not care a copper whether he was\r\ndiscovered or not, and to comment in coarse terms upon our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nMr. Marcy, as Secretary of State, sent all the facts to Great\r\nBritain, his dispatch closing with a peremptory demand for the\r\nrecall of Mr. Crampton and the British Consuls at New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Cincinnati.  Accompanying the despatch was an\r\nelaborate opinion by Attorney-General Cushing, who cited numerous\r\nprecedents, and declared that the demand for the recall of those\r\nwho had been accomplices in the violation of municipal and\r\ninternational laws should not be taken as a cause of offense by\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Sartiges, the French Minister, undertook to mediate\r\nbetween Mr. Crampton and Secretary Marcy.  Calling at the Department\r\nof State, he represented that the continuance of peaceful relations\r\nbetween England and the United States was the earnest wish of his\r\nmaster, the Emperor, who, after his accession to the throne of\r\nFrance, had personally, and through his representatives, evinced\r\non every possible occasion a friendship to the Union.  Mr. Marcy\r\nexpressed satisfaction at the assurance given, and remarked that\r\nit did not correspond with other official statements which the\r\nUnited States had received from parties of reputable standing in\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nThe Minister promptly interposed and denied in the firmest manner\r\nthe truth of any report adverse to the one which he had just made.\r\nThe scene at this moment, according to representation, must have\r\nbeen one of interest, for Mr. Marcy, rising from his seat, excused\r\nhis absence for a moment.  He returned in a short time from an\r\nadjoining room with an original despatch in his hand, addressed to\r\nthe Secretary of War, Mr. Davis, which he opened, and by permission\r\nof M. Sartiges, commenced reading extracts.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Marcy, closing the document, \"what I have just read\r\nto you is from a report of an army commission which was sent out\r\nby this Government for the benefit of science, and am I to understand\r\nfrom the free assurance that you have given, that his Majesty, the\r\nEmperor, was ignorant of the language used by his War Secretary to\r\nthe officers of this mission, to whom he only declined extending\r\nthe courtesies solicited, but added to the refusal an expression\r\nhoping 'that when they met it might be at the cannon's mouth'?\"\r\nMr. Marcy continued:  \"This language is further corroborated by a\r\ndespatch to this department from our Minister at Paris.\"\r\n\r\nDe Sartiges took a hurried leave, but sought revenge by making\r\nhimself generally disagreeable.  He had a row with Mr. Barney, a\r\nvenerable ex-member of the House and a gentleman of the old school.\r\nAt evening parties before leaving he would enter the drawing-room\r\nwhere ladies and gentlemen were assembled, with his hat on and a\r\ncigar in his mouth, which he would light by the chandelier.  He\r\nalso persisted in firing at cats and rats from the back windows of\r\nhis house, thus endangering the lives of persons in the adjacent\r\nback yards.\r\n\r\nMr. Crampton was recalled and received a diplomatic promotion,\r\ngoing to St. Petersburg as Sir John Crampton.  While there, in\r\n1861, he married a young daughter of Balfe, who afterward procured\r\na divorce, after a curious suit at law, tried before \"a jury of\r\nmatrons.\"\r\n\r\nEngland was forced to admit that Mr. Crampton's conduct was\r\n\"notoriously at war with the rights of neutrality and national\r\nhonor.\"  This was not altogether pleasant to some of the old Nestors\r\nof the Senate, who wanted once more to sound the war tocsin.\r\nGeneral Cass, who had had a bad fall on the outside steps of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, was \"eager for the fray;\" the valiant\r\nClayton, of Delaware, saw an opportunity to wipe out the stigma\r\ncast upon his treaty; and although the patriarchal Butler (owner\r\nof men-servants and maid-servants, flocks and herds) displayed the\r\nlily flag of peace in the Senatorial debate, it was as eccentric\r\nas were his weird-like white locks.  Lord Clarendon had then his\r\nhands full, but his successors took their revenge in 1862, when\r\nattempts were made to obtain recruits in Ireland for the Union\r\nArmy.  Mr. Cushing's elaborate arguments against enlistments for\r\na foreign power were copied and sent back to the Department of\r\nState at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic representatives of Queen and Czar, Emperor and\r\nKaiser, were greatly troubled during the Crimean and other European\r\nwars, and it would not answer for them to be seen in friendly\r\nrelations with each other.  These foreign diplomats delude themselves\r\nwith the belief that they play an important political part at\r\nWashington.  So they do in the opinion of the marriageable damsels,\r\nwho are flattered with their flirtations, and in the estimation of\r\nsnobbish sojourners, who glory in writing home that they have shaken\r\nhands with a lord, had a baron to dine with them, or loaned an\r\n_attache_ a hundred dollars.  But, in reality, they are the veriest\r\nsupernumeraries in the political drama now being performed on the\r\nWashington stage.  Should any difficulty arise with the foreign\r\npowers they represent, special Ministers would be appointed to\r\narrange it, and meanwhile the _Corps Diplomatique_ \"give tone to\r\nsociety,\" and is a potent power--in its own estimation.\r\n\r\nThe various legations all exhibit their national characteristics.\r\nThe British attaches represent the Belgravian of the London magazines;\r\ntheir hair parted just a line off the exact centre, their soft eye\r\nonly one degree firmer than those of their sisters', while their\r\nbeautiful, long side-whiskers are wonderful to behold.  The Spanish\r\ngentlemen one recognizes by their close-shorn black heads and smooth\r\nfaces, all courtesy, inevitable pride and secretiveness, eyes that,\r\nlike those of their women, betray a hundred intrigues, because they\r\nseek to conceal so much.  The exquisite politeness of the South\r\nAmericans make you wonder if you rally can be dust and ashes after\r\nthis perfect deference, and their manners are marked by more vivacity\r\nthan those of the Spanish people.  The Russian diplomatists have\r\ngenerally been on the most friendly terms with Congressmen and\r\ncitizens generally, while the Prussians and the Frenchmen have had\r\nseveral little difficulties with the Department of State and with\r\nthe residents of Washington.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Marcy was unwilling to cater for the favor of the\r\npress to the extent which characterized the conduct of many other\r\npublic men, he generally had a good word for the reporters and\r\ncorrespondents whom he met.  \"Well, Mr. ----,\" he would say, as he\r\nwalked up the steps of his office in the morning, to some member\r\nof the press, who affected or had a great acquaintance with the\r\nsecrets of State--\"Well, what is the news in the State Department?\r\nYou know I have always to go to the newspaper men to find out what\r\nis going on here.\"  At another time he would suggest a paragraph\r\nwhich, he would quizzically intimate, might produce an alarm in\r\npolitical circles, improvising, for example, at a party of Senator\r\nSeward's, some story in the ordinary letter-writer style about\r\nSeward and Marcy being seen talking together, and ending with\r\nominous speculations as to an approaching coalition, etc., in doing\r\nwhich he would happily hit off the writers for the press.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing was more accommodating.  He would converse freely with\r\nthose correspondents in whom he had confidence, and permit them to\r\ncopy his opinions in advance of their delivery upon their pledges\r\nthat they should not be printed before they were officially made\r\npublic.  He wrote a great many editorials, somewhat ponderous and\r\nverbose, for the Washington _Union_, and the elaborate statements\r\non executive matters made by the correspondents who enjoyed his\r\nfavor were often dictated by him.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan, removed from the intrigues of home politics, kept up\r\nan active correspondence with his friends.  \"I expected,\" he wrote\r\nto Mr. Henry A. Wise, \"ere this to have heard from you.  You ought\r\nto remember that I am now a stranger in a strange land, and that\r\nthe letters of so valued a friend as yourself would be to me a\r\nsource of peculiar pleasure.  I never had any heart for this mission,\r\nand I know that I shall never enjoy it.  Still, I am an optimist\r\nin my philosophy, and shall endeavor to make my sojourn here as\r\nuseful to my country and as agreeable to myself as possible.\r\n\r\n\"I have been in London,\" Mr. Buchanan went on to say, \"long enough\r\nto form an opinion that the English people generally are not friendly\r\nto the United States.  They look upon us with jealous eyes, and\r\nthe public journals generally, and especially the Leviathan _Times_,\r\nspeak of us in terms of hostility.  The _Times_ is particularly\r\nmalignant, and as it notoriously desires to be the echo of public\r\nopinion, its language is the more significant.  From all I can\r\nlearn, almost every person denounces what they are pleased to call\r\nthe crime of American slavery, and ridicules the idea that we can\r\nbe considered a free people whilst it shall exist.  They know\r\nnothing of the nature and character of slavery in the United States,\r\nand have no desire to learn.  Should any public opportunity offer,\r\nI am fully prepared to say my say upon this subject, as I have\r\nalready done privately in high quarters.\"\r\n\r\nThe first hotel in the District of Columbia was Suter's Tavern, a\r\nlong, low wooden building in Georgetown, kept by John Suter.  Next\r\ncame the Union Hotel there, kept by Crawford.  The National Hotel\r\nin Washington was for some years under the management of Mr. Gadsby,\r\nwho had previously been a noted landlord in Alexandria, and what\r\nwas afterward the Metropolitan Hotel was the Indian Queen, kept by\r\nthe Browns, father and sons.  Another hotel was built nearer the\r\nWhite House by Colonel John Tayloe, and was inherited by his son,\r\nMr. B. Ogle Tayloe.  It was not, however, pecuniarly successful,\r\nas it was thought to be too far up-town.  Mrs. Tayloe, who was born\r\nat the North, used to visit her childhood's home every summer, and\r\nin traveling on one of those floating palaces, the day-boats on\r\nthe Hudson River, she was struck with the business energy and desire\r\nto please everybody manifested by the steward.  On her return\r\nColonel Tayloe mentioned the want of success which had attended\r\nhis hotel, and she remarked that if he could get Mr. Willard, the\r\nsteward of the Albany steamer, as its landlord, there would be no\r\nfear as to its success.  Mr. Tayloe wrote to Mr. Willard, a native\r\nof Westminster, Vermont, who came to Washington, and was soon, in\r\nconnection with his brother, F. D. Willard, in charge of Mr. Tayloe's\r\nhotel, then called the City Hotel.  The Willards gave to this\r\nestablishment the same attention which had characterized their\r\nlabors on board of the steamboat.  They met their guests as they\r\nalighted from the stages in which they came to Washington.  They\r\nstood at the head of their dinner-tables, wearing white linen\r\naprons, and carved the joints of meat, the turkeys, and the game.\r\nThey were ever ready to courteously answer questions, and to do\r\nall in their power to make a sojourn at the City Hotel homelike\r\nand agreeable.\r\n\r\nSuccess crowned these efforts to please the public, and the City\r\nHotel soon took the first rank among the _caravanserais_ of the\r\nnational metropolis.  Mr. E. D. Willard retired, and Mr. Henry A.\r\nWillard took into partnership with him Mr. Joseph C. Willard, while\r\nanother brother, Mr. Caleb C. Willard, became the landlord of the\r\npopular Ebbitt House.  In time it was determined to rebuild the\r\nhotel, which was done under the superintendence of Mr. Henry Willard,\r\nwho was designed by nature for an architect.  When the house was\r\ncompleted it was decided that it should be called henceforth\r\nWillard's Hotel, and about one hundred gentlemen were invited to\r\na banquet given at its opening.  After the cloth was removed, the\r\nhealth of the Messrs. Willard was proposed as the first toast, and\r\nthen Mr. Edward Everett was requested to make a reply.  He spoke\r\nwith his accustomed ease, saying that there are occasions when\r\ndeeds speak louder than words, and this was one of them.  Instead\r\nof Mr. Willard returning thanks to the company present, it was the\r\ncompany that was under obligations to him.  In fact, he thought\r\nthat in paying their respects to Mr. Willard, they were but doing\r\na duty, though certainly a duty most easily performed.  \"There are\r\nfew duties in life,\" said Mr. Everett, \"that require less nerve\r\nthan to come together and eat a good dinner.  There is very little\r\nself-denial in that.  Indeed, self-denial is not the principle\r\nwhich generally carries us to a hotel, although it sometimes happens\r\nthat we have to practice it while there.\"  Mr. Everett went on to\r\nsay that under the roof which sheltered them he had passed a winter\r\nwith John Quincy Adams, Chief Justice Marshall, Judge Story, Mr.\r\nCalhoun, Mr. Clay, and Mr. Webster.  These were all gone, but with\r\nthem he could name another now living, and not unworthy to be\r\nassociated with them, Washington Irving.  \"Think of men like these\r\ngathered together at the same time around the festive board under\r\nthis roof!  That was, indeed, the feast of reason, not merely the\r\nflash of merriment, which set the table in a roar, but that gushing\r\nout of convivial eloquence; that cheerful interchange of friendly\r\nfeeling in which the politician and the partisan are forgotten.\r\nYes, gentlemen,\" Mr. Everett went on to say, \"there were giants in\r\nthose days; giants in intellect, but in character and spirit they\r\nwere gentlemen, and in their familiar intercourse with each other\r\nthey had all the tenderness of brethren.\"\r\n\r\nThe new hall of the House of Representatives was finished about\r\nthis time.  It was throughout gayly decorated, and its ceiling\r\nglittered with gilding, but it was walled in from all direct\r\ncommunication with fresh air and sunlight.  Captain Meigs, of the\r\nEngineer Corps, who had been intrusted by Secretary Davis with the\r\nerection of the wings, had added to the architect's plans an\r\nencircling row of committee-rooms and clerical offices.  Instead\r\nof ventilating the hall by windows, a system was adopted patterned\r\nafter that tried in the English House of Commons, of pumping in\r\nair heated in the winter and cooled in the summer, and Captain\r\nMeigs had thermometers made, each one bearing his name and rank,\r\nin which the mercury could only ascend to ninety degrees and only\r\nfall to twenty-four degrees above zero.  He thought that by his\r\nsystem of artificial ventilation it would never be hotter or colder\r\nthan their limits; but he was woefully mistaken, and immense sums\r\nhave since been expended in endeavoring to remedy the deficient\r\nventilation.  The acoustic properties of the new hall were superior\r\nto those of the classic and grand old hall, but with that exception,\r\nthe gaudily embellished new hall was less convenient, not so well\r\nlighted and ventilated, and far inferior in dignified appearance\r\nto the old one.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Abbott Lawrence\r\nABBOTT LAWRENCE was born at Groton, Massachusetts, December 16th,\r\n1792; was a Representative in Congress from Massachusetts, 1835-\r\n1837, and 1839-1840; was Minister to Great Britain, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nTHE NORTHERN CHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of William Pitt Fessenden into the Senate Chamber was\r\ngraphically sketched years afterward by Charles Sumner.  \"He came,\"\r\nsaid the Senator from Massachusetts, \"in the midst of that terrible\r\ndebate on the Kansas and Nebraska bill, by which the country was\r\nconvulsed to its centre, and his arrival had the effect of a\r\nreinforcement on a field of battle.  Those who stood for freedom\r\nthen were few in numbers--not more than fourteen--while thirty-\r\nseven Senators in solid column voted to break the faith originally\r\nplighted to freedom, and to overturn a time-honored landmark,\r\nopening that vast Mesopotamian region to the curse of slavery.\r\nThose anxious days are with difficulty comprehended by a Senate\r\nwhere freedom rules.  One more in our small number was a sensible\r\naddition.  We were no longer fourteen, but fifteen.  His reputation\r\nat the bar, and his fame in the other House, gave assurance which\r\nwas promptly sustained.  He did not wait, but at once entered into\r\nthe debate with all those resources which afterward became so\r\nfamous.  The scene that ensued exhibited his readiness and courage.\r\nWhile saying that the people of the North were fatigued with the\r\nthreat of disunion, that they considered it as 'mere noise and\r\nnothing else,' he was interrupted by Mr. Butler, of South Carolina,\r\nalways ready to speak for slavery, exclaiming, 'If such sentiments\r\nas yours prevail I want a dissolution, right away'--a characteristic\r\nintrusion doubly out of order.  To which the newcomer rejoined,\r\n'Do not delay it on my account; do not delay it on account of\r\nanybody at the North.'  The effect was electric; but this incident\r\nwas not alone.  Douglas, Cass, and Butler interrupted only to be\r\nworsted by one who had just ridden into the lists.  The feelings\r\non the other side were expressed by the Senator from South Carolina,\r\nwho, after one of the flashes of debate which he had provoked,\r\nexclaimed:  'Very well, go on; I have no hope of you!'  All this\r\nwill be found in the _Globe_ precisely as I give it, but the _Globe_\r\ncould not picture the exciting scene--the Senator from Maine, erect,\r\nfirm, immovable as a jutting promontory, against which the waves\r\nof ocean tossed and broke in a dissolving spray.  There he stood.\r\nNot a Senator, loving freedom, who did not feel on that day that\r\na champion had come.\"\r\n\r\nA most extraordinary claim was presented at Washington during the\r\nPierce Administration by Mr. Francis B. Hayes, a respectable\r\nattorney, who had Reverdy Johnson as his legal adviser.  It was\r\nfrom the heirs of Sir William Alexander, the Earl of Stirling, who\r\nwas regarded as the most brilliant man in the courts of James VI.\r\nand of Charles I.  He received from these monarchs grants of an\r\nimmense domain in North America, including, in addition to Nova\r\nScotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward's Island, and Canada, a\r\nconsiderable portion of Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin, together\r\nwith a strip of land reaching from the headwaters of Lake Superior\r\nto the Gulf of California, and \"the lands and bounds adjacent to\r\nthe said Gulf on the west and south, whether they be found a part\r\nof the continent or mainland, or an island,\" as it was thought they\r\nwere, which was commonly called and distinguished by the name of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of this land-claim was sufficient to defeat it, and\r\nit was asserted that the claimant, whose father had established\r\nhis title to the Earldom of Stirling in the Scotch courts, was a\r\npretender, and that the most important papers substantiating the\r\nclaim were forgeries.  Just then there appeared in _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_ an elaborate article of more than sixty pages, showing\r\nup the worthlessness of the claim, and the _North American Review_\r\npublished a reply, in which it said:  \"If the present claimant is\r\nindeed (as we believe him to be) the legal representative of the\r\nfirst Earl, there can be no doubt that he is, morally speaking,\r\nentitled to the principal and interest of the debt secured by royal\r\nbond to his ancestor, and that it would not be unworthy the\r\nmagnanimity of both the British Government and our own to tender\r\nhim some honorable consideration for the entire loss to his family,\r\nthrough the fortunes of war, of revenue and benefit from the _bona\r\nfide_ and, for the times, immense outlay of his ancestor in the\r\ncolonization of the Western wilderness.\"  No capitalists were found,\r\nhowever, who were willing to advance the funds for the prosecution\r\nof the claim, and Lord Stirling finally accepted a department\r\nclerkship, which he creditably filled.\r\n\r\nThe last winter of President Pierce's Administration was a very\r\ngay one at Washington.  In addition to the official and public\r\nentertainments at the White House, Secretaries McClelland and Davis,\r\nand several of the foreign Ministers, gave elegant evening parties,\r\nthe Southern element predominating in them.  Senator Seward and\r\nSpeaker Banks also gave evening receptions, and the leading\r\nRepublicans generally congregated at the pleasant evening tea-\r\nparties at the residence of Mr. Bailey, the editor of the _Era_,\r\nwhere Miss Dodge, afterward known in literature as \"Gail Hamilton,\"\r\nenlivened the cozy parlors with her sparkling conversation.\r\n\r\nThe wedding of Judge Douglas was a social event.  His first wife\r\nhad been Miss Martin, a North Carolina lady, who was the mother of\r\nhis two young sons, who inherited from her a plantation which had\r\nbelonged to her father in Lawrence County, Mississippi, on which\r\nthere were upward of a hundred slaves.  The \"Little Giant's\" second\r\nwife was Miss Ada Cutts, a Washington belle, the daughter of Richard\r\nCutts, who was for twelve years a Representative from Maine when\r\nit was a district of Massachusetts, and afterward Comptroller of\r\nthe Treasury.  Miss Cutts was tall, very beautiful, and well\r\nqualified by education and deportment to advance her husband's\r\npolitical interests.  She was a devout Roman Catholic, and they\r\nwere married in a Roman Catholic Church, where the bridegroom did\r\nnot seem at home.  She had no children, and after having been for\r\nsome years a widow, she was married a second time to Colonel\r\nWilliams, of the Adjutant General's Department of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe last session under the Pierce Administration was a stormy one.\r\nVice-President Breckinridge delivered an eloquent address when the\r\nSenate removed into its new chamber, which was followed by angry\r\ndebates on the tariff, the Pacific Railroad, the fish bounties,\r\nthe admission of Minnesota, and the submarine telegraph to England.\r\n\r\nIn the House Mr. Banks won laurels as Speaker, displaying a thorough\r\nacquaintance with the intricacies of parliamentary rules and prompt\r\naction in those cases when excited Representatives sought to set\r\nprecedence at defiance.  There was an investigation into a charge\r\nof bribery and corruption, made by Mr. Simonton, the correspondent\r\nof the New York _Times_, and he was kept in the custody of the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms for not giving the facts upon which he had based\r\nhis charges.  It was evident to all, however, that Mr. Simonton\r\nwas correct when he stated that \"a corrupt organization of Congressmen\r\nand certain lobby-agents existed.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few favored ones, the officers of the army\r\nwere glad when the termination of the term of service of Colonel\r\nJefferson Davis as Secretary of War approached.  He had acted as\r\nthough he was Commander-in-Chief, treating the heads of bureaus as\r\nif they were his orderlies, and directing everything, from a review\r\ndown to the purchase of shoe-blacking.  He also changed the patterns\r\nof uniforms, arms, and equipments several times, and it was after\r\none of these changes that he received a communication from Lieutenant\r\nDerby, well known in literary circles as John Phoenix, suggesting\r\nthat each private have a stout iron hook projecting from a round\r\nplate, to be strongly sewed on the rear of his trousers.  Illustrations\r\nshowed the uses to which this hook could be put.  In one, a soldier\r\nwas shown on the march, carrying his effects suspended from this\r\nhook; in another, a row of men were hung by their hooks on a fence,\r\nfast asleep; in a third, a company was shown advancing in line of\r\nbattle, each man having a rope attached to his hook, the other end\r\nof which was held by an officer in the rear, who could restrain\r\nhim if he advanced too rapidly, or haul him back if he was wounded.\r\nWhen Secretary Davis received this he was in a towering rage, and\r\nhe announced that day at a Cabinet meeting that he intended to have\r\nLieutenant Derby tried before a court-martial \"organized to convict\"\r\nand summarily dismissed.  But the other Secretaries, who enjoyed\r\nthe joke, convinced him that if the affair became public he would\r\nbe laughed at, and he abandoned the prosecution of the daring artist-\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nMr. Healy came to Washington in the last winter of the Pierce\r\nAdministration, and painted several capital portraits.  Mr. Ames,\r\nof Boston, who exhibited a life-like portrait of Daniel Webster,\r\nand Mr. Powell also set up their easels, to execute orders.  Captain\r\nEastman, of the army, was at work on the sketches for the illustrations\r\nof Schoolcraft's great work on the Indians, and Mr. Charles Lanman,\r\nthe author-artist, added to his already well-filled portfolios of\r\nlandscapes.  Mr. George West, known to fame as a painter of Chinese\r\nlife, was engaged by Captain Meigs to paint prominent naval events\r\nin spaces in the elaborate frescoing on the walls of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Naval Affairs, but after he had completed two he\r\nrefused to submit to the military rule of Meigs, and stopped work.\r\nWhat he had done was then painted out.  An Italian fresco-painter,\r\nMr. Brimidi, was more obedient to orders and willing to answer the\r\nroll-calls, so he was permitted to cover the interior walls of the\r\nnew Capitol with his work--allegorical, historical, diabolical,\r\nand mythological.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce was the most popular man personally that ever\r\noccupied the Presidential chair.  When, in 1855, the Orange and\r\nAlexandria Railroad was completed to Culpepper Court-House, Virginia,\r\nJohn S. Barbour, president of the road, invited a number of gentlemen\r\nto inspect it and partake of a barbecue.  President Pierce, Mr.\r\nBodisco, the Russian Minister, and other distinguished officials\r\nwere of the invited guests.  The party went to Alexandria by steamer,\r\nand on landing there found a train awaiting them, with a baggage-\r\ncar fitted up as a lunch-room.  The President was in excellent\r\nspirits, and when the excursionists reached the place where the\r\nbarbecue was held, he enjoyed a succession of anecdotes told by\r\nthe best story tellers of the party.  The feast of barbecued meats\r\nwas afterward enjoyed, and early in the afternoon the party again\r\ntook the cars to return.  On the return trip a gentleman with an\r\nenormous beard, having imbibed very freely, leaned his head on the\r\nback of the seat and went to sleep.  A blind boy got in at one of\r\nthe stations, and moving along the aisle of the car, his hand came\r\nin contact with the man's beard, which he mistook for a lap-dog,\r\nand began to pat, saying \"Pretty puppy, pretty puppy.\"  This\r\nattention disturbed the sleeper, who gave a loud snort, when the\r\nboy jumped back and said, \"You wouldn't bite a blind boy, would\r\nyou?\"  President Pierce was much amused with this occurrence, and\r\noften spoke of it when he met those who had witnessed it with him.\r\n\r\nMr. George W. Childs, then a courteous and genial book publisher\r\nin Philadelphia, endeavored to obtain from Congress an order for\r\nan edition of Dr. Kane's work on the Arctic regions.  The House\r\npassed the requisite resolution, but the Senate refused to concur,\r\nalthough it had ordered the publication of several expensive accounts\r\nof explorations at the far West.  The Congressional _imprimatur_\r\nwas also refused to the report of the Hon. J. R. Bartlett, who was\r\nthe civilian member of the Joint Commission which had established\r\nthe new boundary between the United States and Mexico.  He had\r\nrefused to bow down and worship the \"brass coats and blue buttons\"\r\nof his military associates, so his valuable labors were ignored,\r\nwhile an enormous sum was expended in illustrating and publishing\r\nthe work of Major Emory, the ranking army officer on the Commission.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Nathl P. Banks\r\nNATHANIEL PRENTISS BANKS was born at Waltham, Massachusetts, January\r\n30th, 1816; was a Representative in Congress, December 5th, 1853,\r\nto December 4th, 1857, when he resigned, having served as Speaker\r\nin the Thirty-fourth Congress; was Governor of Massachusetts,\r\nJanuary 1858, to January, 1861; served throughout the war as major-\r\ngeneral of volunteers; was a Representative in Congress, December\r\n4th, 1865, to March 3d, 1873, and again December 6th, 1875, to\r\nMarch 3d, 1877; was appointed United States Marshal for the district\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nEXCITING PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the Presidential election of 1856 approached, the\r\nDemocrats, thoroughly alarmed by the situation, determined to make\r\na last struggle for Southern supremacy, and Washington was agitated\r\nby the friends of the prominent candidates for the Democratic\r\nnomination for months before the National Convention at Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce earnestly desired a renomination, and had distributed\r\n\"executive patronage\" over the country in a way which he hoped\r\nwould secure him a majority of the delegates.  He had done all in\r\nhis power to promote the interests of the South, but success had\r\nnot crowned his efforts, and he was ungratefully dropped, as Daniel\r\nWebster had been before him.\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan, then in the sixty-fifth year of his age, had started\r\nin public life as a Federalist, and in 1819 had united in a call\r\nfor a public meeting to protest against the admission of Missouri\r\nas a slave State.  But he had become converted to pro-slavery\r\nDemocracy, and although he had been defeated three times in Democratic\r\nConventions as a candidate for the Presidential nomination, he was\r\nregarded as the most \"available\" candidate by those who had been\r\nin past years identified with the Whigs.  His political views are\r\nsummed up in the following extract from one of his speeches in\r\nCongress:  \"If I know myself, I am a politician neither of the West\r\nnor the East, of the North nor of the South.  I therefore shall\r\nforever avoid any expressions the direct tendency of which must be\r\nto create sectional jealousies, and at length disunion--that worst\r\nof all political calamities.\"  That he endeavored in his future\r\ncareer to act in accordance with this uncertain policy no candid\r\nmind can doubt.\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas' doctrine of \"squatter sovereignty\" was repudiated\r\nby the Southern Democrats with but few exceptions.  Bold, dashing,\r\nand energetic in all that he undertook, with almost superhuman\r\npowers of physical endurance, he even forced the admiration of men\r\nwho did not agree with his opinions.  No man ever lived in this\r\ncountry who could go before the masses \"on the stump,\" and produce\r\nsuch a marked effect, and his personal magnetism won him many\r\nfriends.  One day the \"Little Giant,\" going up to Beverly Tucker,\r\na prominent Virginia politician, threw his arm on his shoulder,\r\nand said, in his impulsive way, \"Bev., old boy, I love you.\"\r\n\"Douglas,\" says Tucker, \"will you _always_ love me?\"  \"Yes,\" says\r\nDouglas, \"I will.\"  \"But,\" persisted Tucker, \"will you love me when\r\nyou get to be President?\"  \"If I don't, may I be blanked!\" says\r\nDouglas.  \"What do you want me to do for you?\"  \"Well,\" says Tucker,\r\n\"when you get to be President, all I want you to do for me is to\r\npick some public place, and put your arm around my neck, just as\r\nyou are doing now, and _call me Bev.!_\"  Douglas was much amused,\r\nand used to relate the circumstance with great glee.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass had a few faithful friends, and Henry A. Wise, of\r\nVirginia, who was a blatant Buchanan man, was not without hope that\r\nhe himself might receive the nomination.\r\n\r\nMany of the delegates to the Cincinnati Convention passed some time\r\nin Washington City.  Massachusetts sent Charles Gordon Greene, the\r\nveteran editor of the Boston _Post;_ Benjamin F. Butler, then known\r\nas a smart Lowell lawyer, and the old anti-Mason, Ben. F. Hallet,\r\nthen United States District Attorney.  Among the Kentuckians were\r\nthe gallant John C. Breckinridge, the pugnacious Charles A. Wickliffe,\r\nJ. W. Stevenson, and T. C. McCreery, afterward Governors and\r\nSenators, and the courteous William C. Preston, afterward Minister\r\nto Spain.  From Louisiana were Senators Slidell and Benjamin,\r\nprominently connected with the Rebellion a few years later, and\r\nPierre Soule.  Florida was to be represented by Senator Yulee, of\r\nIsraelitish extraction, who in early life spelled his name L-e-v-i.\r\nThen there were Vallandingham, of Ohio; Captain Isaiah Rynders,\r\nof New York; James S. Green, of Missouri; James A. Bayard, of\r\nDelaware, and other party magnates, who all expressed their desire\r\nto sink all personal grievances to secure victory.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats met in Convention at Cincinnati, where the friends\r\nof each candidate had their headquarters, that of Mr. Douglas being\r\ngraced by Dan Sickles, Tom Hyer, Isaiah Rynders, and other New York\r\npoliticians, while at a private house leased by Mr. S. M. Barlow,\r\nthe claims of Buchanan were urged by Senators Bayard, Benjamin,\r\nBright, and Slidell.  General Pierce had few friends beyond the\r\nholders of Federal offices, and General Cass received a cold support\r\nfrom a half-dozen old friends.\r\n\r\nThe first two days were occupied in settling the claims of contestants\r\nto seats.  The anti-Benton delegates from Missouri were admitted,\r\nand the New York wrangle was finally settled by adopting the minority\r\nreport of the Committee on Credentials, which admitted both the\r\n\"Hards\" and the \"Softs,\" giving each half a vote.  On the first\r\nballot, Buchanan had one hundred and thirty-five votes, Pierce one\r\nhundred and twenty-three, Douglas thirty-three, and Cass five.\r\nThe balloting was continued during four days, when, on the sixteenth\r\nballot (the name of Pierce having been withdrawn), Buchanan received\r\none hundred and sixty-eight votes, Douglas one hundred and twenty-\r\none, and Cass four and a half.  Mr. Richardson, of Illinois, then\r\nwithdrew the name of Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Buchanan was unanimously\r\nnominated.  The Convention then balloted for a candidate for Vice-\r\nPresident, and on the second ballot John C. Breckinridge was\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans and the Republicans flattered themselves that\r\nthe Democratic party had been reduced to a mere association of men,\r\nwhose only aim was the spoils of victory.  Indeed, Mr. Lewis D.\r\nCampbell, of Ohio, asserted in a public speech that \"were President\r\nPierce to send out all his force of marshals and deputy marshals\r\nto find such a party, each one provided with a national search-warrant,\r\nthey would fail to discover the fugitive!  It, too, has departed!\r\nHis marshals would have to make returns upon their writs similar\r\nto that of the Kentucky constable.  A Kentucky fight once occurred\r\nat a tavern on 'Bar Grass!'  One of the combatants broke a whisky\r\nbottle over the head of his antagonist.  The result was a State's\r\nwarrant.  The defendant fled through a corn-field, over the creek,\r\ninto a swamp, and there climbed a stump.  Seating himself in the\r\nfork, he drew his 'bowie,' and as the constable approached in\r\npursuit, he addressed him:\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Mr. Constable, you want to take me, and I give you fair\r\nwarning that if you attempt to climb this stump, by the Eternal!\r\nI'll take you!'  The constable, who had been about the court-house\r\nenough to learn some of the technical terms used in returning writs,\r\nwent back to the 'Squire's office, and indorsed upon the warrant:\r\n'Non est inventus! through fieldibus, across creekum, in swampum,\r\nup stumpum, non comeatibus!'  So it is with the old Jackson Democratic\r\nparty--'non comeatibus!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party, however, was in a better condition than its\r\nopponents imagined.  President Pierce entered heartily into the\r\ncampaign, Jefferson Davis and Stephen A. Douglas worked shoulder\r\nto shoulder, and Mr. Buchanan proved to be a model candidate.  When\r\nhis old friend, Mr. Nahum Capen, of Boston, sent to him a campaign\r\nlife for his indorsement he declined, saying:  \"After reflection\r\nand consultation, I stated in my letter of acceptance substantially\r\nthat I would make no issues beyond the platform, and have, therefore,\r\navoided giving my sanction to any publications containing opinions\r\nwith which I might be identified and prove unsatisfactory to some\r\nportions of the Union.  I must continue to stand on this ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governors of the Southern States were satisfied with the\r\nnomination of Mr. Buchanan, although the leading secessionists\r\navowed their intention to avail themselves of the opportunity for\r\norganizing a rebellion which they hoped would prove a revolution.\r\nOfficers of the army and navy, born at the South, or who had married\r\nSouthern wives, were appealed to stand by the States to which they\r\nfirst owed allegiance, and accessions to those willing to desert\r\nthe Union when their States called for their services were announced.\r\nProminent among those officers who intimated that their intention\r\nwas to serve Virginia rather than the Federal Government was Colonel\r\nRobert E. Lee.  A Virginian by birth, he had married the only child\r\nof George Washington Parke Custis, and when not on duty away from\r\nWashington he resided at \"Arlington.\"  On Sundays he worshiped in\r\nChrist Church, at Alexandria, occupying the family pew in which\r\nGeorge Washington used to sit.\r\n\r\nThe National American Convention had met at Philadelphia on the\r\n19th of February, and (after an exciting discussion of the slavery\r\nquestion, followed by the withdrawal of the Abolitionists) nominated\r\nFillmore and Donelson.  This ticket was adopted at an eminently\r\nrespectable convention of the Whig leaders, then without followers,\r\nheld at Baltimore on the 17th of September.\r\n\r\nSome of Mr. Seward's friends desired to have him nominated by the\r\nRepublicans at their National Convention, to be held at Philadelphia\r\non the 17th of June, but Thurlow Weed saw that he could not receive\r\nas many votes as were cast for Scott in 1852, and advocated the\r\nnomination of John C. Fremont, the \"Pathfinder,\" whose young and\r\npretty daughter might be seen every pleasant afternoon riding on\r\nhorseback on Pennsylvania Avenue with her old grandfather, Colonel\r\nThomas H. Benton.  \"Old Blair, of the _Globe_,\" and his two sons,\r\nPreston King, of New York, John Van Buren, and David Wilmot, with\r\nother distinguished and disgruntled Democrats, with several clever\r\nyoung journalists, created a great enthusiasm for Colonel Fremont.\r\nMr. Bailey, of the Washington _Era_, with a few old Whigs, advocated\r\nthe nomination of Judge McLean, while Burlingame, at the head of\r\nthe \"Young America,\" or Know-Nothing branch of the party, endeavored\r\nto get up enthusiasm for Mr. Speaker Banks, \"the bobbin-boy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican National Convention met there were self-styled\r\ndelegates from Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Virginia, but it\r\nwas, in fact, a convention of nearly a thousand delegates from the\r\nfree States.  An informal ballot showed that Fremont had a large\r\nmajority and he was unanimously nominated.  Mr. Dayton, of New\r\nJersey, was nominated as Vice-President, defeating Nathaniel P.\r\nBanks, Abraham Lincoln, Charles Sumner, and David Wilmot.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans endeavored to revive the excitements of the Log\r\nCabin campaign, and a considerable zeal was manifested by the\r\nAmericans, the Democrats, and the Whigs, but Mr. Buchanan received\r\nthe electoral votes of five large free States, and of every Southern\r\nState with the exception of Maryland, which gave its vote for Mr.\r\nFillmore.  Colonel Fremont received the vote of every Northern\r\nState with the exception of California, Illinois, Indiana, New\r\nJersey, and Pennsylvania.  Mr. Buchanan was astonished at the large\r\nvote which he had received, and he regarded this as a proof that\r\nwhat he called \"Abolition fanaticism\" had at last been checked.\r\n\r\nThe electoral votes for President and Vice-President were counted,\r\nin accordance with the established custom, in the Hall of the House\r\nof Representatives.  The Senators went there in procession, advanced\r\nup the middle aisle, and took seats provided for them in the area\r\nin front of the Speaker's chair, the Representatives receiving them\r\n\"standing and in silence.\"  Mr. Speaker Banks handed his \"gavel\"\r\nto Judge Mason, President of the Senate _pro tempore_, and the\r\nvenerable old fogies took arm-chairs in the area before the table.\r\nSenator Bigler, of Pennsylvania, with Messrs. Jones, of Tennessee,\r\nand Howard, of Ohio duly appointed tellers, then took possession\r\nof the clerk's desk, and the proceedings commenced.  State by State,\r\nthe Chairman took the packages, broke the seals, and handed the\r\ndocuments to the tellers, by one of whom they were read.  Maine\r\nled off with \"Fremont and Dayton,\" and for awhile it was all that\r\nway.  But the Pathfinder stuck in the sands of New Jersey, and then\r\n\"Old Buck\" began to make a showing, varied by the Maryland vote\r\nfor Millard Fillmore.  Everything went along \"beautiful,\" and the\r\nvote had been announced by the tellers, when objection was made to\r\nthe vote of Wisconsin, which was one day late, owing to a snow\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nA regular scene of confusion ensued, in which their high mightinesses,\r\nthe Senators, became intensely aroused.  The great Michigander\r\ngrowled like an angry bear, and old Judge Butler became terribly\r\nexcited, his long hair standing out in every direction, like that\r\nof a doll charged with electric fluid.  At last he led the van,\r\nand the Senators withdrew in great dudgeon, to cool off as they\r\npassed through the Rotunda.  In due time they returned, however,\r\nand after a little talk the vote was officially announced.  The\r\nSenate then retired, the House adjourned, and the country turned\r\nits expectant eyes toward the coming Administration.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Winfield Scott\r\n    Lieut Genl U. S.\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT was born at Petersburg, Virginia, June 13th, 1786;\r\nreceived a liberal education; was admitted to the bar and practiced\r\na few years; entered the army in 1808 as a captain of light artillery;\r\ncommanded on the northern frontier and won the battles of Chippewa\r\nand Lundy's Lane in 1814; defeated Black Hawk in 1812; commanded\r\nin the Mexican campaign, which resulted in the capture of the City\r\nof Mexico in September, 1847; was defeated as the Whig candidate\r\nfor President in 1852; was commissioned as Lieutenant-General in\r\n1855, and died at New York, May 29th, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nMISS LANE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of Mr. Buchanan, his home at Lancaster, \"Wheatland,\"\r\nwas a political Mecca, to which leading Democrats from all sections\r\nmade pilgrimages.  Mr. Buchanan, who was experienced in public\r\naffairs, appointed his nephew, Mr. J. Buchanan Henry, a well-informed\r\nyoung gentleman, recently admitted to the Philadelphia bar, as his\r\nprivate secretary, and made him indorse brief statements of their\r\ncontents on each of the numerous letters of recommendation for\r\noffice which he received.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before his inauguration, Mr. Buchanan visited Washington,\r\nthat he might confer with his leading political friends.  He\r\nentertained a large party of them at dinner at the National Hotel,\r\nafter which nearly all of those present suffered from the effects\r\nof poison taken into their systems from an impure water supply,\r\nand some of them never recovered.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan was accompanied, when he left his home to be inaugurated,\r\nby Miss Harriet Lane, his niece, a graceful blonde with auburn hair\r\nand violet eyes, who had passed a season in London when her uncle\r\nwas the American Minister there, and who was as discreet as she\r\nwas handsome, amiable, and agreeable.  With her, to aid in keeping\r\nhouse in the Executive Mansion, was \"Miss Hetty\" Parker, who had\r\nfor years presided over Mr. Buchanan's bachelor's-hall, and his\r\nprivate secretary, Mr. J. Buchanan Henry.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Washington, Mr. Buchanan was taken to a suite of\r\nrooms prepared for him at the National Hotel, but he soon after\r\nwent to the house of Mr. W. W. Corcoran, the generous founder of\r\nthe Corcoran Gallery of Art, where he remained until his inauguration.\r\nOn the morning after his arrival, the _National Intelligencer_ gave\r\nthe following as the probable composition of his Cabinet:  Secretary\r\nof State, Lewis Cass, of Michigan; Secretary of the Treasury, Howell\r\nCobb, of Georgia; Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, of Virginia;\r\nSecretary of the Navy, Aaron V. Brown, of Tennessee; Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, J. Thompson, of Mississippi; Postmaster-General, J.\r\nGlancy Jones, of Pennsylvania; Attorney-General, Isaac Toucey, of\r\nConnecticut.  It was also said that Mr. Jones had declined, and\r\nthat the position of Postmaster-General had been tendered to W. C.\r\nAlexander, of New Jersey.  This programme, arranged by Mr. Buchanan\r\nbefore he had left his home, was but slightly changed.  Mr. Toucey\r\nwas made Secretary of the Navy, Aaron V. Brown, Postmaster-General,\r\nand Jere Black was brought in as Attorney-General.  But these\r\ncarefully made arrangements failed to beget confidence.  Republicans\r\nwere defiant, as were men of the dominant party, and everywhere\r\nthere were apprehensions.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural message had been written at Wheatland, where Mr. J.\r\nBuchanan Henry had copied Mr. Buchanan's drafts and re-copied them\r\nwith alterations and amendments, until the document was satisfactory.\r\nIt met the approval of the selected Cabinet when read to them at\r\nWashington, the only change being the insertion of a clause shadowing\r\nthe forthcoming Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court as one\r\nthat would dispose of a vexed and troublesome topic by the highest\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt was also arranged that Mr. Buchanan's friend, Mr. John Appleton,\r\nwho had represented the Portland district in Congress, and had\r\nserved as Minister to Bolivia and as Secretary of Legation at Paris,\r\nshould edit the Washington _Union_, which was to be the \"organ\" of\r\nthe new Administration.  Mr. Appleton's salary, with the other\r\nexpenses of the paper above its receipts, were to be paid by Mr.\r\nCornelius Wendell, as a consideration for the printing and binding\r\nfor the Executive Departments.\r\n\r\nMajor Heiss, who had made sixty thousand dollars on the public\r\nprinting, and then lost forty thousand dollars in publishing the\r\nNew Orleans _Delta_, established a paper called _The States_, which\r\nwas to be the organ of the filibusters and the secessionists.  He\r\nwas aided by Major Harris, a son-in-law of General Armstrong, who\r\nhad made his fortune while Senate Printer, other parties doing the\r\nwork for about half of what was paid for it.  Mr. Henri Watterson,\r\nwho had been born at Washington, while his father represented a\r\nTennessee district in the House, commenced his brilliant editorial\r\ncareer as a reporter on _The States_.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on the third of March, the fine band of P. S. Gilmore,\r\nwhich had accompanied the Charlestown City Guard to Washington,\r\nformed in front of Mr. Corcoran's house, beneath the windows of\r\nthe chamber occupied by Mr. Buchanan, and played \"Hail to the\r\nChief,\" followed by the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and \"Hail Columbia.\"\r\nThe city was filled that night with strangers, many of whom could\r\nnot find sleeping-places.  Every hotel was crammed, every boarding-\r\nhouse was crowded, private houses were full, and even the circus\r\ntent was turned into a dormitory at fifty cents a head.\r\n\r\nCongress was in session all night, and the Capitol was crowded.\r\nJust prior to the final adjournment of the House, the newspaper\r\ncorrespondents, who had received many courtesies from Mr. Speaker\r\nBanks, united in writing him a letter of thanks.  In his reply he\r\nsaid:  \"The industry and early intelligence which gave value to\r\nyour labors are often the subject of commendation, and to this I\r\nam happy to add that, so far as I am able to judge, you have been\r\nguided as much by a desire to do justice to individuals as to\r\npromote the public weal.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun rose in a fog and was greeted by a salute from the Navy\r\nYard and the Arsenal, while the rattling notes of the \"reveille\"\r\nwere heard on all sides, and hundreds of large American flags were\r\ndisplayed from public and private buildings.  The streets were\r\nfilled with soldiers, firemen, badge-bedecked politicians, and\r\ndelighted negroes.  Well-mounted staff officers and marshals galloped\r\nto and fro, directing military and civic organizations to their\r\npositions in the procession.  The departments were closed, and the\r\nclerks were anxiously discussing the probability of a rotation in\r\noffice which would force them to seek other employment.\r\n\r\nAs noon approached, carriages conveyed the privileged few to the\r\nCapitol, where, at \"high twelve,\" the gallant and gifted John C.\r\nBreckinridge solemnly swore to protect and defend the Constitution.\r\nHe then administered the same oath to Jefferson Davis and other\r\nnew Senators.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that gallant Mexican War veteran, General Quitman, who\r\ncommanded the military, had been formally received, and had given\r\nthe word \"March!\"  Colonel W. W. Selden, the Chief Marshal, had at\r\nleast thirty gentlemen as aides, all finely mounted and handsomely\r\nattired, with uniform sashes and saddlecloths, forming a gallant\r\ntroop.  At the head of the column was the Light Battery K, of the\r\nFirst Regular Artillery, commanded by Major William H. French.\r\nNext came a battalion of marines, headed by the full Marine Band,\r\nin their showy scarlet uniforms.  Twenty-four companies of volunteer\r\nmilitia followed, prominent among them the Albany Burgess Corps,\r\nwith Dodworth's Band; the Charlestown City Guard, with Gilmore's\r\nBand; the Lancaster Fencibles; the Willard Guard, from Auburn, New\r\nYork; the Law Grays, and a German Rifle Company, from Baltimore.\r\n\r\nFollowing the escort, in an open carriage drawn by two fine gray\r\nhorses, sat President Pierce and President-elect Buchanan.  Flowers\r\nwere thrown into the carriage as it passed along, and cheers drowned\r\nthe music of the bands.  The carriage was followed by political\r\nclubs from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Lancaster, each\r\nhaving its band and banners.  The Washington Democratic Association\r\nhad a decorated car, drawn by six horses, from which rose a liberty\r\npole seventy feet high, carrying a large American flag.  This and\r\na full-rigged miniature ship-of-war were gotten up at the Washington\r\nNavy Yard.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Capitol, Mr. Buchanan was escorted to the Senate\r\nChamber.  Mr. Breckinridge had been sworn in as Vice-President,\r\nand a procession was soon formed with him at its head, which moved\r\nto the platform erected in the usual place over the steps of the\r\neastern portico.  As he came out, dressed with his habitual precision\r\nin a suit of black, and towering above the surrounding throng, the\r\nthoughtful gravity of his features hushed the impatient crowd.\r\nThere was a second of intense quiet, then cheer after cheer rent\r\nthe air.  Soon he was surrounded by the magnates of the land, civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval, with the Diplomatic Corps and a number of\r\nelegantly dressed ladies.  Advancing to the front of the platform\r\nhe read his inaugural address from manuscript in a clear, distinct\r\ntone, and when he had concluded, reverentially took the oath of\r\noffice, which, as with several of his predecessors, was administered\r\nby the venerable Chief Justice Taney.  The cheers of the multitude\r\nwere echoed by a President's salute, fired by the Light Artillery\r\nnear by, and repeated at the Navy Yard and at the Arsenal.  The\r\nprocession was then re-formed and escorted the President to the\r\nWhite House, where he held an impromptu reception.\r\n\r\nAs there was no hall in Washington large enough to contain more\r\nthan six hundred people, a temporary annex to the City Hall was\r\nerected by the managers of the Inauguration Ball.  The interior\r\nwas decorated with the flags of all nations, and the ceiling was\r\nof white cloth, studded with golden stars, which twinkled as they\r\nwere moved in unison with the measure of the dancers below, and\r\nreflected the blaze of light from large gas chandeliers.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan arrived about eleven o'clock, accompanied by Miss\r\nLane, and was received by Major Magruder, who very discreetly spared\r\nhim the infliction of a speech.  Miss Lane wore a white dress\r\ntrimmed with artificial flowers, similar to those which ornamented\r\nher hair, and clasping her throat was a necklace of many strands\r\nof sea pearls.  She was escorted by Senator Jones and the venerable\r\nGeneral Jessup in full uniform.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful among the many ladies present was the wife of\r\nSenator Douglas, who was dressed in bridal white, with a cluster\r\nof orange-blossoms on her classically formed head.  Senators Cameron\r\nand Dixon, with their wives, were the only Republican members of\r\nthe upper house present, but there was no lack of those from sunnier\r\nclimes, with their ladies, among whom Mrs. Slidell, who was something\r\nof an oracle in political circles, was conspicuous.  Mrs. Senator\r\nThompson, of New Jersey, dressed in white, with silver ornaments,\r\nwas much admired.  The ladies of the Diplomatic Corps were elegantly\r\nattired, especially Madame de Sartiges, the wife of the French\r\nMinister.  President Buchanan and suite were first admitted, with\r\nthe Committee, to the supper-table.  Dancing was kept up until\r\ndaylight, and although the consumption of punch, wines, and liquors\r\nwas great, there were no signs of intoxication.\r\n\r\nTwo days after Mr. Buchanan was inaugurated Chief Justice Taney,\r\nof the Supreme Court, gave a decision in the Dred Scott case, in\r\nwhich he virtually declared that \"negroes have no rights which\r\nwhite men are bound to respect.\"  Dred Scott had been a slave in\r\nMissouri, belonging to Dr. Emerson, a surgeon in the United States\r\nArmy, who had taken him, in the performance of his official duties,\r\nto Illinois, and thence to Minnesota.  Returning with him to\r\nMissouri, Dred Scott was whipped, and claiming that he had secured\r\nhis freedom by a residence in a free State and a free Territory,\r\nhe brought suit for assault and battery.  Meanwhile Dr. Emerson\r\ndied, leaving to his widow and to his only daughter a considerable\r\nslave property, among them Dred Scott.  Mrs. Emerson afterward\r\nmarried Dr. Calvin C. Chaffee, who came into Congress on the Know-\r\nNothing wave and afterward became a Republican.  The suit brought\r\nby Dred Scott was defended by the administrator of the Emerson\r\nestate, on behalf and with the consent of the wife of Dr. Chaffee\r\nand the daughter, who were the heirs-at-law.  The final decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court that Dred Scott was not a citizen of the United\r\nStates and could not sue in the United States Court remanded him\r\nand his family to the chattelhood of Mrs. Chaffee.  This decision\r\nwas a great victory for the South, as it not only reduced all\r\npersons of African descent to a level with inanimate property, but\r\nasserted that a slave-holder could go to any part of the country,\r\ntaking his slaves and preserving his ownership in them.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice B. R. Curtis, who had been appointed by President\r\nFillmore on the recommendation of Daniel Webster, dissented.  He\r\nfurnished a copy of his dissenting opinion for publication in the\r\nnewspapers, but the majority opinion was not forthcoming, and the\r\nclerk of the court said that the Chief Justice had forbidden its\r\ndelivery.  Shortly afterward, Judge Curtis, having heard that\r\nextensive alterations had been made in the majority opinion, sent\r\nfrom Boston to Washington, being himself then in Massachusetts,\r\nfor a copy.  He was refused.  A long and bitter correspondence\r\nensued between him and Judge Taney.  He claimed the right, which\r\nhe undoubtedly possessed, to consult the record for the further\r\ndischarge of his official duties.  Judge Taney denied the right,\r\nand obtained an order of court forbidding anybody to see the opinion\r\nbefore its official publication in the Reports.  The clerk of the\r\ncourt finally offered to supply manuscript copies of the decision\r\nat seven hundred and fifty dollars each, but the indefatigable\r\nCornelius Wendell succeeded in obtaining a copy and printed a large\r\nedition in pamphlet form for gratuitous distribution.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John B. Floyd\r\nJOHN BUCHANAN FLOYD was born in Montgomery County, Va., in 1805;\r\nwas Governor of Virginia, 1850-1853; was Secretary of War under\r\nPresident Buchanan, 1857-1860; was a Confederate brigadier-general,\r\n1861-1863; died at Abingdon, Va., August 26th, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nDIPLOMACY, SOCIETY, AND CIVIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan was virtually his own Secretary of State, although\r\nhe had courteously placed his defeated rival, General Cass, at the\r\nhead of the State Department.  Nearly all of the important diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, however, was dictated by Mr. Buchanan, who had,\r\nlike Jefferson and John Quincy Adams, served as Secretary of State,\r\nand who was thoroughly versed in foreign relations.  General Thomas,\r\nthe Assistant Secretary of State, was soon dismissed, and Mr. John\r\nAppleton was persuaded to leave the editorial chair of the Washington\r\n_Union_ and take his place.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, which had pleasant personal recollections\r\nof Mr. Buchanan, promptly sent Lord Napier as Minister Plenipotentiary,\r\nno successor to the dismissed Sir John Crampton having being\r\naccredited during the Administration of President Pierce.  The new\r\nMinister was a Scotchman by birth, slender in figure, with light\r\nhair and blue eyes, and thoroughly trained in British diplomacy.\r\nHe was an especial protege of Lord Palmerston, and Lord Clarendon\r\nhad placed the olive-branch in his hand with his instructions.\r\nThe press of England proclaimed that he had instructions to render\r\nhimself acceptable to the Government and the people of the United\r\nStates, and to do all in his power to promote kind feelings between\r\nthe two countries.  Soon after he landed at New York he made a\r\nspeech at the annual dinner of the St. George's Society, in which\r\nhe repudiated the previous distrustful and vexatious policy of the\r\nBritish Foreign Office towards the United States, and declared that\r\nthe interests of the two countries were so completely identified\r\nthat their policy should never be at variance.\r\n\r\nThe claim by Great Britain of the right to search vessels belonging\r\nto the United States which her naval officers might suspect to be\r\nslave-traders, and the establishment of a British protectorate over\r\nthe Mosquito coast, in defiance of the Monroe Doctrine, were knotty\r\nquestions.  Lord Napier, evidently, was not capable of conducting\r\nthe negotiations on them in a manner satisfactory to Lord Palmerston,\r\nwho sent to Washington as his adviser Sir William Gore Ouseley, a\r\nveteran diplomat.  He was not in any way accredited to the United\r\nStates Government, but was named Special Minister to Central America,\r\nand stopped at Washington on his way there, renting the Madison\r\nHouse, on Lafayette Square, and entertaining there with great\r\nliberality.\r\n\r\nSir William Gore Ouseley, who was a Knight Commander of the Bath,\r\nhad resided at Washington as an attache to the British Legation\r\nforty years previously, while Mr. Vaughan was Minister, and had\r\nthen entered personally into a treaty of permanent peace and amity\r\nwith the United States by marrying the daughter of Governor Van\r\nNess, of Vermont.  Miss Van Ness was a young lady of great beauty,\r\nresiding at the metropolis with her uncle, General Van Ness, at\r\none time the Mayor of Washington.  Sir William afterward visited\r\nPersia as the historian of the embassy of his uncle, Sir Gore\r\nOuseley, and his published work contained much new information in\r\nrelation to that then almost unknown portion of the world.  He had\r\nafterward been connected with the British Legations in Spain,\r\nBrazil, and Buenos Ayres, and his acquaintance with the Spanish\r\nrace, language, and literature was probably equal, if not superior,\r\nto that of any other Englishman.  He was the author of a valuable\r\nwork on the United States, and also of an expensive and illustrated\r\nvolume on the scenery of Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless due to considerations such as there, the special\r\nacquaintanceship of this veteran diplomat with the character,\r\ncircumstances, and views of the several nationalities involved in\r\nthe difficulties to be arranged, which had prevailed over mere\r\npolitical affinities and induced his selection by Lord Palmerston\r\nfor the errand on which he came to Washington.  His personal\r\nrelations with Lord Napier were very friendly, and Mr. Buchanan\r\nwas the friend of both, having known Lady Ouseley before her\r\nmarriage.  For some months the Ouseleys were prominent in Washington\r\nsociety.  Lady Ouseley frequently had the honor of being escorted\r\nby the President in her afternoon walks, sometimes attended by her\r\ndaughter, who wore the first crimson balmoral petticoat seen in\r\nWashington.  When President Buchanan and Miss Lane took their summer\r\nflight for Bedford Springs, the Ouseleys were their traveling\r\ncompanions, sharing their private table, and their entertainments\r\nat Washington were numerous and expensive.\r\n\r\nAt one of these, Lady Ouseley wore a rich, blue brocade trimmed\r\nwith Honiton lace, with a wreath of blue flowers upon her hair,\r\nfastened at each side by a diamond brooch; Miss Lane, the President's\r\nniece, wore a dress of black tulle, ornamented with bunches of gold\r\nleaves, and a head-dress of gold grapes; Miss Cass, the stately\r\ndaughter of the Premier of the Administration, was magnificently\r\nattired in pearl-colored silk, with point-lace flounces but wore\r\nno jewelry of any kind; Mrs. Brown, the wife of the Postmaster-\r\nGeneral, wore a rich pink silk dress, with pink roses in her hair;\r\nMrs. Thompson, the wife of the Secretary of the Interior, wore a\r\npink silk dress with lace flounces, and a head-dress of pink flowers;\r\nMadame Sartiges, the wife of the French Minister, wore a rich chene\r\nsilk, and was accompanied with her niece, dressed in pink tarlatan;\r\nMadame Stoeckl, the wife of the Russian Minister, looked as stately\r\nas a queen and beautiful as a Hebe in a dress of white silk, with\r\nblack lace flounces, cherry-colored flowers, and gold beads; Miss\r\nSchambaugh, of Philadelphia, who was called the handsomest woman\r\nin the United States, wore a white-flounced tarlatan dress trimmed\r\nwith festoons of dark chenille, with a head-dress of red japonicas;\r\nMrs. Pendleton, the wife of the Representative from the Cincinnati\r\nDistrict, wore a white silk skirt with a blue tunic trimmed with\r\nbright colors; Mrs. McQueen, the wife of a South Carolina\r\nRepresentative, wore a rich black velvet, and Mrs. Boyce, from the\r\nsame State, wore a lilac silk dress trimmed with black illusion;\r\nMrs. Sickles, wife of the Representative from New York, wore a blue\r\nsilk dress, with rich point lace flowers, and was accompanied by\r\nher mother, who wore a lavender brocade dress, woven with gold and\r\nsilver flowers, and Miss Woodbury, a daughter of the late Judge\r\nWoodbury, wore a black tarlatan dress over black silk, with a head-\r\ndress of gilt beads.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen present were Lord Napier, Edward Everett,\r\nSecretary Thompson, Senator Mason, Representatives Keitt, Miles,\r\nBoyce, McQueen, Clingman, and Ward; Captains Ringgold and Goldsborough,\r\nof the navy; General Harney and Colonel Hardee, of the army, and\r\na number of others.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of Mr. Buchanan's Administration was distinguished\r\nby the number of social entertainments given in Washington.  It\r\nwas then as in Paris just before the Revolution of 1830, when\r\nTalleyrand said to the crafty Louis Philippe, at one of his Palais\r\nRoyal balls:  \"We are dancing on a volcano.\"  The hidden fires of\r\ncoming revolution were smoldering at the Capitol; but in the drawing-\r\nrooms of the metropolis the Topeka Guelphs cordially fraternized\r\nwith the Lecompton Ghibellines night after night, very much as the\r\nlawyers of Western circuits who, after having abused each other\r\nall day in bad English, met at night in the judge's room to indulge\r\nin libations of bad liquor.  Even when Lent came, instead of going\r\nto church, in obedience to the chimes of consecrated bells, society\r\nkept on with its entertainments.\r\n\r\nAmong the most prominent houses were those of the Postmaster-General,\r\nMr. Aaron V. Brown, whose wife was assisted by the daughter of her\r\nfirst marriage, Miss Narcissa Sanders.  At Secretary Thompson's a\r\nfull-length portrait of \"Old Hickory,\" by Sully, kept watch and\r\nward of the refreshment table.  The connected houses occupied by\r\nSecretary Cass, afterward the Arlington Hotel, were adorned with\r\nmany rare works of art, brought by him from the Old World.  Senators\r\nGwin, of California, Thompson, of New Jersey, and Clay, of Alabama,\r\nwith Governor Aiken, of South Carolina, also entertained frequently\r\nand generously.  At the supper-tables wild turkeys, prairie-hens,\r\npartridges, quails, reed birds, chicken and lobster salads, terrapin,\r\noysters, ice-creams and confectionery were furnished in profusion,\r\nwhile champagne, sherry, and punch were always abundant.\r\n\r\nAmong choice bits of scandal then afloat was one at the expense of\r\na lady who prided herself on the exclusiveness of the society which\r\ngraced her _salons_.  A _double-distilled-F.-F.-V._, no one could\r\nobtain invitations to her parties whose _ecusson_ did not bear the\r\nquartering of some old family, and thus these entertainments were\r\naccused of resembling the tournaments of ancient times, to which\r\nthe guests were led, not from any prospect of amusement, but merely\r\nto prove their right to _ennuyer_ themselves _en bonne compagnie_.\r\nForeigners, however, were always welcome, and one of the \"pets,\"\r\na romantic looking young Frenchman, who was quite handsome and made\r\na great sensation in fashionable society, avoided the Legation as\r\nrepresenting a usurper, and therefore quite unworthy the attention\r\nof one like himself, of the \"vielle roche.\"  The young man, enveloping\r\nhimself somewhat in mystery, assumed the dignity of Louis Quatorze\r\nin his earlier days, and his decisions on all fashionable matters\r\nwere law.  Where he lived no one exactly knew, as his letters were\r\nleft in Willard's card-basket, but his aristocratic protector\r\npersuaded Gautier to let her look at the furnaces of his restaurant-\r\nkitchen, and there--must it be said?--she found M. le Compte, in\r\nwhite apron and paper cap, constructing a _mayonnaise_.  \"This\r\nyoung man is my best cook,\" said Gautier, but the lady did not wait\r\nto receive his salutation.\r\n\r\nThe wild hunt after office was kept up during the summer and fall\r\nafter Mr. Buchanan's inauguration, fortunate men occasionally\r\ndrawing place-prizes in the Government lottery.  One of the best\r\njokes about applicants for office was told at the expense of a\r\nBostonian, who presented, among other papers, a copy of a letter\r\nto Mr. Buchanan from Rufus Choate, with a note stating that he sent\r\na copy because he knew that the President could never decipher the\r\noriginal, and he had left blanks for some words which he could not\r\nhimself transcribe.\r\n\r\nGovernor Geary had returned from Kansas, disgusted with the condition\r\nof things there, and had been replaced as Governor by Robert J.\r\nWalker, who was expected to play the part of \"wrong's redresser,\"\r\nas the Prince did in Verona when called to settle the difficulties\r\nbetween the Montagues and the Capulets.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Peter Force\r\nPETER FORCE was born at Passaic Falls, N. J., November 26th, 1790;\r\nbecame a printer and journalist at Washington; collected and\r\npublished many volumes of American documentary history; was Mayor\r\nof Washington, 1836-1840; died at Washington, D. C., January 23d,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nPRELUDE TO THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas J. Rusk, United States Senator from Texas, who had\r\nfought bravely at the battle of San Jacinto, had committed suicide\r\nduring the summer.  He had been elected President _pro tempore_ of\r\nthe Senate, and the Senate elected as his successor Senator\r\nFitzpatrick, of Alabama, a tall, fine-looking man, whose wife was\r\na great favorite in Washington society.  He received twenty-eight\r\nvotes, Mr. Hamlin receiving nineteen votes, and voting himself for\r\nMr. Seward, which showed the Republican strength in the Senate to\r\nbe twenty.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Southern forces in the Senate was Mr. John Slidell,\r\nwho was born in New York, but found his way, when young, to New\r\nOrleans, where he soon identified himself with the Creole population\r\nand became noted as a political manager.  His organization of the\r\ncolonization of Plaquemine Parish, by a steamboat load of roughs\r\nfrom New Orleans, secured the defeat of Henry Clay in Louisiana\r\nand virtually prevented his election as President.  Wealthy, and\r\nwithout conscientious scruples on political matters he was well-\r\nfitted for the leading position in the formation of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, which he obtained; but President Davis took good care\r\nto send him abroad, knowing that if he could not rule the Confederacy\r\nhe would take the first occasion to ruin it.  What he lacked in\r\npositive intellect he more than made up in prudence, industry, and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the session Mr. Douglas gave notice that he\r\nwould the next afternoon define his position on the Kansas question.\r\nThe announcement brought crowds to the Senate Chamber.  Every\r\nSenator was in his seat; every past or present dignitary who could\r\nclaim a right \"to the floor\" was there, and the galleries were\r\npacked with spectators, Mrs. Douglas prominent among the fairer\r\nportion of them.  The \"Little Giant\" was neatly dressed in a full\r\nsuit of black, and rose to speak at his seat, which was about in\r\nthe middle of the desks on the right of the President's chair,\r\nwhere the Democrats sat.  He spoke boldly and decidedly, though\r\nwith a studied courtesy toward the President.  There was a great\r\ndifference between the question of popular sovereignty as advocated\r\nby Mr. Douglas, and the great question of human freedom for which\r\nMr. Sumner and other Representatives of Northern sentiments were\r\nstoutly battling.  After Mr. Douglas had concluded, Mr. Brown, of\r\nMississippi, congratulated Mr. Henry Wilson on the \"new Republican\r\nally,\" and many other bitter things were said about him by the\r\nSouthrons, but the _bon mot_ of the day was by Senator Wade:\r\n\"Never,\" said he, \"have I seen a slave insurrection before.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a large attendance at the organization of the House, when\r\nthe roll-call showed that two hundred and twenty-five were present.\r\nThen Mr. Phelps gracefully moved that the House proceed to the\r\nelection of a Speaker, thereby showing that he was not a candidate.\r\nMr. Jones nominated James L. Orr of South Carolina; Governor Banks\r\nnominated Galusha A. Grow; and H. W. Davis was nominated but\r\nwithdrawn.  The election was then commenced _viva voce_, the clerk\r\ncalling the roll.  Colonel Orr had one hundred and twenty-eight\r\nvotes, and was declared elected.\r\n\r\nGovernor Banks and A. H. Stephens were appointed a committee to\r\nconduct the Speaker-elect to the chair.  He then delivered a brief,\r\nsensible address, after which he was approached by the patriarchal\r\nGiddings, who handed him a small Bible and administered the oath\r\nof office, which duty devolves on the oldest Representative.  The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms elevated his mace--that \"bauble\" of authority so\r\ndistasteful to the Puritans--and the Speaker began to swear in the\r\nmembers State by State.\r\n\r\nAmong investigations ordered was one into an alleged attempt at\r\nbribery by Lawrence, Stone, & Co., when the tariff bill was under\r\nconsideration, which disclosed the fact that they had paid fifty-\r\neight thousand dollars to Colonel Wolcott, who came to Washington\r\nas a representative of the Massachusetts manufacturers.  Colonel\r\nWolcott, when brought before the House, declined to make the desired\r\nrevelations, and he was locked up in the Washington Jail--a miserable\r\nold building.  Those Representatives who were believed to have\r\nreceived some of this money were naturally uneasy, and undertook\r\nto intimate that the Colonel had pocketed the whole of it.  He\r\nphilosophically submitted to the decree of the House, occupying\r\nthe jailer's sitting-room--a cheerful apartment, with a good fire,\r\nbright sunshine coming in at the windows.  He had numerous visitors,\r\nhis meals were sent him from a restaurant, and he certainly did\r\nnot appear to suffer seriously from his martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIn the exciting debates on the admission of Kansas, Senators Sumner,\r\nWilson, Fessenden, and Seward were positive in their denunciation\r\nof the use of Federal troops for the enforcement of the laws, which\r\nencouraged the Southern Senators in their belief that the secession\r\nof a State would not be forcibly opposed.  \"The Senate,\" said Henry\r\nWilson, \"insists that the President shall uphold this usurpation--\r\nthese enactments--with the bayonet.  Let us examine the acts of\r\nthese usurpers which Senators will not repeal; which they insist\r\nshall be upheld and enforced by the sabres of the dragoons.\"  Said\r\nWilliam H. Seward:  \"When you hear me justify the despotism of the\r\nCzar of Russia over the oppressed Poles, or the treachery by which\r\nLouis Napoleon rose to a throne over the ruins of the Republic in\r\nFrance, on the ground that he preserves domestic peace among his\r\nsubjects, then you may expect me to vote supplies of men and money\r\nto the President that he may keep the army in Kansas.\"  Ben Wade\r\nwas equally severe on the use of the army, declaring \"that the\r\nhonorable business of a soldier had been perverted to act as a\r\npetty bailiff and constable to arrest and tyrannize over men.\"\r\n\r\nThe racket in the House of Representatives commenced with a struggle\r\nas to whether the President's Message on the Lecompton Constitution\r\nof Kansas should be referred to the Democratic Committee on\r\nTerritories or to a select committee of fifteen.  The session was\r\nprotracted into the night, and after midnight but few spectators\r\nremained in the galleries.  Those Representatives who could secure\r\nsofas enjoyed naps between the roll-calls, while others visited\r\ncommittee-rooms, in which were private supplies of refreshments.\r\nAbout half-past-one, Mr. Grow, of Pennsylvania, then standing on\r\nthe Democratic side of the House, objected to General Quitman's\r\nmaking any remarks.  \"If you are going to object,\" shouted Mr.\r\nKeitt, of South Carolina, \"return to your own side of the hall.\"\r\nMr. Grow responded:  \"This is a free hall, and every man has a\r\nright to be where he pleases.\"  Mr. Keitt then came up to Mr. Grow\r\nand said:  \"I want to know what you mean by such an answer as that.\"\r\nMr. Grow replied:  \"I mean just what I say; this is a free hall,\r\nand a man has the right to be where he pleases.\"  \"Sir,\" said Mr.\r\nKeitt, \"I will let you know that you are a black Republican puppy.\"\r\n\"Never mind,\" retorted Mr. Grow, \"I shall occupy such place in this\r\nhall as I please, and no negro-driver shall crack his whip over\r\nme.\"  The two then rushed at each other with clinched fists.  A\r\ndozen Southerners at once hastened to the affray, while as many\r\nanti-Lecompton men came to the rescue, and Keitt received--not from\r\nGrow, however, a blow that knocked him down.  Mr. Potter, of\r\nWisconsin, a very athletic, compactly built man, bounded into the\r\ncentre of the excited group, striking right and left with vigor.\r\nWashburne, of Illinois, and his brother, of Wisconsin, also were\r\nprominent, and for a minute or two it seemed as though we were to\r\nhave a Kilkenny fight on a magnificent scale.  Barksdale had hold\r\nof Grow, when Potter stuck him a severe blow, supposing that he\r\nwas hurting that gentleman.  Barksdale, turning around and supposing\r\nit was Elihu Washburne who struck him, dropped Grow, and stuck out\r\nat the gentleman from Illinois.  Cadwallader Washburne, perceiving\r\nthe attack upon his brother, also made a dash at Mr. Barksdale,\r\nand seized him by the hair, apparently from the purpose of drawing\r\nhim \"into chancery\" and pommeling him to greater satisfaction.\r\nHorrible to relate, Mr. Barksdale's wig came off in Cadwallader's\r\nleft hand, and his right fist expended itself with tremendous force\r\nagainst the unresisting air.  This ludicrous incident unquestionably\r\ndid much toward resorting good nature subsequently, and its effect\r\nwas heightened not a little by the fact that in the excitement of\r\nthe occasion Barksdale restored his wig wrong-side foremost.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker shouted and rapped for order without effect.  The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms stalked to the scene of the battle, mace in hand,\r\nbut his \"American eagle\" had no more effect than the Speaker's\r\ngavel.  Owen Lovejoy and Lamar, of Mississippi, were pawing each\r\nother at one point, each probably trying to persuade the other to\r\nbe still.  Mr. Mott, the gray-haired Quaker Representative from\r\nOhio, was seen going here and there in the crowd.  Reuben Davis,\r\nof Mississippi, got a severe but accidental blow from Mr. Grow,\r\nand various gentlemen sustained slight bruises and scratches.  A\r\nVirginia Representative, who thought Montgomery, of Pennsylvania\r\nwas about to \"pitch in,\" laid his hand upon his arm, to restrain\r\nhim, and was peremptorily ordered to desist or be knocked down.\r\nMr. Covode, of Pennsylvania, caught up a heavy stone-ware spittoon,\r\nwith which to \"brain\" whoever might seem to deserve it, but\r\nfortunately did not get far enough into the excited crowd to find\r\nan appropriate subject for his vengeance; and all over the hall\r\neverybody was excited for the time.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it did not last long, and no weapons were openly\r\ndisplayed.  When order was restored several gentlemen were found\r\nto present an excessively tumbled and disordered appearance, but\r\nthere remained little else to recall the excitement.  Gentlemen of\r\nopposite parties crossed over to each other to explain their pacific\r\ndispositions, and that they got into a fight when their only purpose\r\nwas to prevent a fight.  Mutual explanations and a hearty laugh at\r\nthe ludicrous points of the drama were followed by quiet and a\r\nreturn to business.  It was finally agreed, about half-past six\r\no'clock on Sunday morning, that the Democrats would permit a vote\r\nto be taken on Monday without further debate, delay, or dilatory\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Orr's mallet rapped the House to order at noon on Monday,\r\nonly six of the two hundred and thirty-four Representatives were\r\nabsent, and the galleries were packed like boxes of Smyrna figs.\r\nRev. Dr. Sampson made a conciliatory prayer, the journal was read,\r\ntwo enrolled bills were presented, and then the Speaker, in an\r\nunusually earnest tone, stated the question.  Tellers had been\r\nordered, and he appointed Messrs. Buffington, of Massachusetts,\r\nand Craige, of North Carolina.  \"Is the demand for the previous\r\nquestion seconded?\"\r\n\r\nThe imposing form of Buffington was soon seen making his way down\r\nto the area before the Speaker's table, where Craige met him.  The\r\ntwo shook hands, and there was then a quick obedience to the\r\nSpeaker's request that gentlemen in favor of the motion would pass\r\nbetween the tellers.  Father Giddings, crowned with silvery locks,\r\nled the Republican host down to be counted.  Burlingame followed,\r\nand among others who filed along were Henry Winter Davis, General\r\nSpinner, John Sherman, General Bingham, Frank Blair, the trio of\r\nWashburnes, Gooch, Schuyler Colfax, John Covode, Governor Fenton,\r\nSenator Cragin, and burly Humphrey Marshall.  When all had passed\r\nbetween the tellers Buffington wheeled about and reported to the\r\nSpeaker, who announced the result rather hesitatingly:  \"One hundred\r\nand ten in the affirmative.  Those opposed will now pass between\r\nthe tellers.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Southern Democrats, with their Northern allies, came\r\ntrooping down, headed by the attenuated Stephens.  Dan Sickles and\r\nJohn Cochrane, who were afterward generals in the Union armies,\r\nwere then allied with Zollicoffer, Keitt, and others, who fell in\r\nthe Confederate ranks, and there were so many of them that the\r\nresult appeared doubtful.  At last it was Mr. Craige's turn to\r\nreport, and then all was silent as the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker's usually loud, clear voice hesitated as he at last\r\nannounced:  \"One hundred and four in the negative.  The ayes have\r\nit, and the demand for the previous question is seconded.  Shall\r\nthe main question be now put?\"  The main question was next put,\r\nand the vote by ayes and nays on a reference of the Kansas question\r\nto the Committee on Territories, was ayes, 113; nays, 114.  Then\r\ncame the vote on the reference to a select committee of fifteen,\r\nand Speaker Orr had to announce the result, ayes, 114; nays 113.\r\nThe North was at last victorious.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Howell Cobb\r\nHOWELL COBB was born at Cherry Hill, Ga., September 7th, 1815;\r\ngraduated at Franklin College, 1834; was Representative from Georgia,\r\n1843-1851 and 1855-1860; was chosen Speaker, 1849; was Governor of\r\nGeorgia, 1851; was President of the Confederate Congress, 1861;\r\ndied in New York city, October 9th, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nPOLITICIANS, AUTHORS, AND HUMORISTS.\r\n\r\nBluff Ben Wade, a Senator from Ohio, was the champion of the North\r\nin the upper house during the prolonged debates on the Kansas-\r\nNebraska Bill.  Dueling had long been regarded as a lost art in\r\nthe Northern States, but Mr. Wade determined that he would accept\r\na challenge should one be sent him, or defend himself should he be\r\nattacked.  But no one either assaulted or challenged him, although\r\nhe gave his tongue free license.\r\n\r\nOne day Senator Badger spoke plaintively of slavery from a Southern\r\npoint of view.  In his childhood, he said, he was nursed by an old\r\nnegro woman, and he grew to manhood under her care.  He loved his\r\n\"old black mammy,\" and she loved him.  But if the opponents of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill were triumphant, and he wished to go to either\r\nof those Territories, he could not take his \"old black mammy\" with\r\nhim.  Turning to Mr. Wade, he exclaimed:  \"Surely, you will not\r\nprevent me from taking my old black mammy with me?\"  \"It is not,\"\r\nremarked the Senator from Ohio, dryly, \"that he cannot take his\r\nold black mammy with him that troubles the mind of the Senator,\r\nbut that if we make the Territories free, he cannot sell the old\r\nblack mammy when he gets her there.\"\r\n\r\nThe future leader of the Great Rebellion, Senator Jefferson Davis,\r\nhad then assumed the leadership of the Southern Senators and their\r\nNorthern allies.  His best friends were forced to admit that his\r\nbearing, even toward them, had become haughty, and his manners\r\nimperious.  His thin, spare figure, his almost sorrowful cast of\r\ncountenance, composed, however, in an invariable expression of\r\ndignity, gave the idea of a body worn by the action of the mind,\r\nan intellect supporting in its prison of flesh the pains of\r\nconstitutional disease, and triumphing over physical confinement\r\nand affliction.  His carriage was erect--there was a soldierly\r\naffectation, of which, indeed, the hero of Buena Vista gave evidence\r\nthrough his life, having the singular conceit that his genius was\r\nmilitary and fitter for arms than for the council.  He had a precise\r\nmanner, and an austerity that was at first forbidding; but his\r\nvoice was always clear and firm.  Although not a scholar in the\r\npedantic sense of the term, and making no pretensions to the doubtful\r\nreputation of the sciolist, his reading was classical and varied,\r\nhis fund of illustration large, and his resources of imagery\r\nplentiful and always apposite.\r\n\r\nSenator Robert W. Johnson--\"Bob Johnson,\" every one called him--\r\nhad made many friends while a member of the House, and was one of\r\nthe most popular Senators.  He was a man of generous feeling,\r\nhonorable impulses, and a cheerful humor, which had endeared him\r\nto the homely backwoodsmen of his State.  He was a fine speaker,\r\npouring forth fact and argument with an earnestness that riveted\r\nattention, and lighting up the dull path of logic with the glow of\r\nhis captivating fancy, while he spiced his remarks with the\r\nidiosyncrasies of frontier oratory, familiar and quaint illustrations,\r\nand blunt truth.  At heart he loved the Union, but he could not\r\nstand up against the public sentiment of his State.\r\n\r\nHenry Bowen Anthony was the first Republican Senator who had not\r\nbeen identified with the Abolitionists.  Before he had been a week\r\nin the Senate, he was graciously informed that the Southern Senators\r\nrecognized him as a gentleman, and proposed to invite him to their\r\nhouses.  \"I can enter no door,\" sturdily replied the man of Quaker\r\nancestry, \"which is closed against any Northern Senator.\"  Mr.\r\nAnthony was at that time a very handsome man, with jet black hair,\r\nblue eyes, and a singularly sweet expression of countenance.  His\r\neditorial labors on the Providence _Journal_ had given him a rare\r\ninsight into men and politics, which qualified him for Senatorial\r\nlife.  He was soon a favorite in Washington society, wit and general\r\ninformation embellishing his brilliant conversation, while his\r\nsocial virtues gave to his life a daily beauty.\r\n\r\nOstensibly to negotiate a postal treaty, but really to see what\r\ncould be done about an international copyright between Great Britain\r\nand the United States, came Anthony Trollope, Esq.  He was a short,\r\nstout old gentleman, with a round, rosy face and snow-white hair,\r\nwho loved to talk, and who talked well.  His mother, Mrs. Frances\r\nTrollope, had written a cruelly sarcastic book on the manners and\r\ncustoms of Americans in 1830, and he was somewhat dogmatic in his\r\ncriticisms of what he saw and heard.  He shone especially at\r\ngentlemen's evening parties, at which he narrated anecdotes about\r\nMacaulay, Dickens, and Thackeray, and of his own exploits in\r\n\"'unting,\" which he regarded as the noblest of all pastimes.\r\n\r\nMike Walsh was not only a demagogue, but an incorrigible joker.\r\nHe used frequently to visit Washington after the expiration of his\r\nCongressional term, and was in the city after the close of the\r\nsummer session of the Thirty-fifth Congress.  Judge Douglas was\r\nalso there, busily engaged in advancing his Presidential prospects.\r\nOne evening, as Walsh was sitting in front of the Kirkwood House,\r\nhe remarked that the weather looked threatening, but that he hoped\r\nit would prove good on account of the serenade that was to be given\r\nto Judge Douglas that night.  The thing took at once, and he visited\r\nall the hotels, and in casual conversations broached the serenade,\r\nand the fact that the Marine Band had been engaged for the occasion.\r\nWhen ten o'clock P. M. came there were not less than six or seven\r\nhundred people in front of Judge Douglas's new residence; and as\r\nthe streets had been newly opened and were still unpaved, the mud\r\nwas ankle deep.  There were also some thirty or forty hacks and a\r\nnumber of private carriages; and as the Judge and his beautiful\r\nand accomplished wife had heard of the intended ovation, they had\r\nprepared for the emergency by taking up the parlor carpets and\r\nsetting out a collation for the sovereigns.  But, alas! no Marine\r\nBand appeared; and as eleven o'clock came and no music, the crowd\r\nbegan slowly to thin out, until at last it got whispered around\r\nthat Mike Walsh had something to do with the getting up of the\r\nserenade, when, amid curses and loud guffaws, there was a general\r\nstampede of the crowd.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the stormy debates at the Capitol, there was an\r\nentertainment where men of both sections fraternized.  It was a\r\n\"wake\" at the house of Mr. John Coyle, the cashier of the _National\r\nIntelligencer_, whose Milesian blood had prompted him to pay\r\nHibernian honors to the memory of one who had often been his guest.\r\nThe funereal banquet had been postponed, however, in true Irish\r\nstyle, when it had been ascertained that the deceased was not dead,\r\nand in due time the guests were again invited, to honor him whom\r\nthey had mourned--Albert Pike, of Arkansas.  There he was, with\r\nstalwart form, noble features, waving hair, and a patriarchal beard\r\n--at once the Kit North and the Koerner of America.\r\n\r\nAfter a neat welcome by the host, uprose the erudite dignitary of\r\nthe State Department, and he read, in deep, full tones, an obituary\r\nsketch of the supposed deceased, which he had prepared upon the\r\nreceipt of the sad news.  Pike's remarks, in reply, were touchingly\r\nbeautiful, especially when he expressed his delight at having read\r\nkind notices of himself from those whom he had feared were his\r\nenemies, and his hopes that all enmity between him and his fellow-\r\nmen might remain buried in that tomb to which he had been consigned.\r\nJack Savage then sang a song (to the tune of \"Benny Havens, O!\"),\r\ndescribing a forced visit of \"the fine Arkansas gentleman\" to the\r\nStygian shore, where he craved permission of Pluto to return to\r\nearth for one night at Coyle's:\r\n\r\n  \"'Are you not dead?' the King then said.\r\n   'Well, what of that? said he,\r\n   'If I am dead, I've not been waked, and buried dacently.'\r\n   'And why,' the monarch cried,\r\n   'Desire again to share life's toils?'\r\n   'For the sake of one good frolic more,\r\n   'Even at Johnny Coyle's.'\r\n   One spree at Johnny Coyle's; one spree at Johnny Coyle's;\r\n   And who would not be glad to join a spree at Johnny Coyle's?\"\r\n\r\nPluto then enumerated the good cheer and good company, and \"Horace\r\nand Anacreon in vain would have him stay.\"  But the gentleman from\r\nArkansas demonstrated that they were all surpassed at Johnny Coyle's.\r\nThe recital of the genial qualities of various gentlemen named\r\nenlisted Proserpine, who urged Pluto to let him go, that he might\r\nreturn, bringing his friends with him.\r\n\r\n  \"And so the Queen at last prevailed, as women always do,\r\n   And thus it comes that once again this gentleman's with you;\r\n   He's under promise to return, but that he means to brake,\r\n   And many another spree to have besides the present wake.\r\n   One spree at Johnny Coyle's, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThis song was followed by a story, and that story by a song, and\r\nit was nearly daylight in the morning before the guests separated.\r\n\r\nThe Sons of Malta, a secret order which sprang into existence during\r\nMr. Buchanan's Administration, was a remarkable institution.  The\r\noriginal object of the organization was the capture of Cuba, and\r\nmany prominent military men of the South were the leading spirits\r\nin the movement; but the filibustering was soon abandoned, and a\r\nnewspaper man, who had been initiated, conceived the idea of making\r\n\"some fun for the boys.\"  The whole business of initiation, etc.,\r\nwas transformed into a series of the most stupendous practical\r\njokes and outrageously comical proceedings ever dreamed of.  The\r\nOrder spread rapidly all over the Union.  At Washington the lodge\r\nfitted up Marini's Hall in luxurious style, with carpets, cushioned\r\nseats, and an expensive paraphernalia.  Many Senators and\r\nRepresentatives who had been initiated at their respective homes\r\nwere regular attendants, and there was no lack of candidates, until\r\na sedate citizen, enraged by the disclosure of his domestic\r\ninfidelity, denounced the whole affair as a gigantic \"sell.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Order was on the high tide of prosperity Mr. Buchanan\r\nwas asked if he would receive a delegation of the Sons of Malta,\r\nrepresenting twenty different States.  Mr. Buchanan was a zealous\r\nFreemason--having gone up into the Royal Arch degree--and thinking\r\nthat the institution resembled Freemasonry, he named an hour for\r\nthe visit.  The members of the delegation were promptly on hand,\r\nand after they had taken their position along one side of the East\r\nRoom, Mr. Buchanan entered.  The spokesman addressed him in a short\r\nspeech, in which he eulogized the Order as composed of Union-loving\r\ncitizens, associated for charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan listened attentively, and said in reply:  \"Gentlemen\r\nof the Sons of Malta, I feel grateful for the honor you have done\r\nme in making this visit.  I do not know much about the Order, but\r\nI have no doubt of its charitable objects and its patriotism.  In\r\nyour praiseworthy object of charity I would say, God speed you in\r\nso noble an enterprise.  We are told that Faith, Hope, and Charity\r\nare the links that bind us together in social Union.  Faith and\r\nHope may pass away, but Charity endures forever.  I do not feel\r\nthat there is any danger of the dissolution of the Union by the\r\noppression of one portion of our country upon another; for should\r\nthat period unhappily arrive, the people, who made it, will preserve\r\nit.  Again, allow me cordially to thank you for this visit, and I\r\nwould be most happy to take each one of you by the hand as\r\nrepresentatives of the Sons of Malta from all parts of the Union.\"\r\nSo solemn was the scene that several portly delegates were evidently\r\nconvulsed with emotion (or secret laughter), and the Union was\r\nregarded as safe.  Owners of ships, stocks, States, and the Order\r\ntook courage.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Geo.

II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nFOREIGN COMPLICATIONS AND DOMESTIC TROUBLES.\r\n\r\nWhile President Buchanan was anxiously awaiting information from\r\nCentral America, he received from Mr. Dallas, the Minister at\r\nLondon, notes of a conversation between himself and the Earl of\r\nMalmesbury, in which the English Minister said:  \"Lord Napier has\r\ncommunicated to the President the treaty negotiated by Sir William\r\nGore Ouseley with the Minister from Nicaragua.\"  It was believed\r\nthat no objection had been expressed to its provisions.  One of\r\nits objects was to terminate the Mosquito Protectorate.  Now, this\r\nwas virtually the relinquishment on the part of England of her\r\nconstruction of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and, of course, was very\r\ndesirable news to Mr. Buchanan, yet Lord Napier had withheld it.\r\nHe either was disgusted at this settlement of the long-talked-of\r\ndifficulty without his aid, or his devotion to a fair Southern\r\nwidow had made him stupidly inattentive to what was going on.  A\r\nhint to the English Government was thereupon given by Mr. Buchanan\r\nthat his Lordship had better be transferred to some other post,\r\nand he was transferred accordingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward had endeavored to introduce Lord Napier into Republican\r\nsociety instead of that which Southerners had made so agreeable,\r\nand when he was recalled was mainly instrumental in getting up a\r\nsubscription ball in his honor.  It was given at Willard's Hotel,\r\nin the long dining-room, which had been decorated for the occasion\r\nwith flags of all nations, mirrors, and chandeliers.  At one end\r\nof the room, beneath full-length portraits of General Washington\r\nand Queen Victoria, was a raised dais, on which Lord and Lady Napier\r\nreceived the company.  He wore a blue dress-coat with gilt diplomatic\r\nbuttons, white waistcoat, and blue trousers, and looked the \"canny\"\r\nScotchman and Napier that he was.  Lady Napier wore a white silk\r\nball-dress, with three flounces of white tulle, puffed and trimmed\r\nwith black Brussels lace, a corsage, and a head-dress of scarlet\r\nvelvet with pearls and white ostrich feathers.  After the presentations\r\nthe ball was opened with a quadrille, in which Lord Napier danced\r\nwith Madame Limburgh, a daughter of General Cass, Mr. Ledyard and\r\nMrs. Seward, Jr., being their vis-a-vis.  In the same quadrille\r\nwas Senator Seward and the beautiful Mrs. Conrad, of Georgia, having\r\nas their vis-a-vis Mr. Danby Seymour, M. P., and the niece of\r\nSenator Dixon, of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nSupper was served at eleven o'clock.  Mr. Speaker Orr escorted Lady\r\nNapier to the table, followed by Lord Napier escorting the Countess\r\nde Sartiges.  It was a bountiful repast, with a profusion of\r\nchampagne.  Dancing was kept up until a late hour.  A few days\r\nafterward Lord Napier embarked on an English war-steamer for his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nElegant entertainments were given during Mr. Buchanan's Administration\r\nby the members of his Cabinet, the receptions at the house of\r\nPostmaster-General Brown, graced by his daughter-in-law, Miss\r\nNarcissa Sanders, surpassing all others in elegance.  Mrs. Gwin's\r\nfancy ball was far above any similar entertainment ever given at\r\nWashington.  Charles Francis Adams, then a Representative from\r\nMassachusetts, entertained very hospitably; Mr. Seward gave numerous\r\ndinner-parties, and his parlors were open every Friday evening to\r\nall who chose to visit him; the Blairs kept open house for the new\r\nRepublican party; Mr. John Cochrane gave a great dinner-party to\r\nthe correspondents of the leading newspapers; Mrs. Fanny Kemble\r\nButler had fashionable audiences to hear her readings, and was much\r\nmade of in society, but she terrified the waiters at her hotel by\r\nher imperious manners.  On all sides gayety abounded.\r\n\r\nA large party of Democrats, after enjoying a dinner on the anniversary\r\nof the battle of New Orleans, went, at past eleven o'clock, to the\r\nWhite House to honor the President.  They evidently disturbed him\r\nfrom his sleep, for he appeared in a dressing-gown, and as if he\r\nhad just arisen from his bed.  Mr. Buchanan was an exceedingly\r\namiable and courteous politician, and showed it on this occasion\r\nby getting up at that unseemly hour to address these gentlemen,\r\nwho were full of supper, wine, and patriotism.  He, however, naively\r\nremarked to them, in concluding his remarks, \"that in bidding them\r\ngood-night he hoped they would retire to rest, and that to-morrow\r\nall of them would be better prepared for the discharge of their\r\nrespective duties.\"  Evidently Mr. Buchanan, while appreciating\r\nthe motive and feelings of these gentlemen, manifested a little\r\ncharacteristic waggishness about their going to rest and getting\r\nup refreshed for their duties.\r\n\r\nThe murder, one bright Sunday morning in February, of Philip Barton\r\nKey, the District Attorney of the District of Columbia, by Mr.\r\nDaniel E. Sickles, a member of the House of Representatives from\r\nNew York, created a great sensation.  Mr. Sickles, although a young\r\nman, had been for some years prominently connected with New York\r\npolitics.  He had taken from her boarding-school and married the\r\nhandsome young daughter of Madame Bagioli, who had, with her husband,\r\nacquired some celebrity in New York as Italian music teachers.\r\nSoon after the marriage Mr. Sickles had received the appointment\r\nof Secretary of Legation at London (Mr. Appleton having been unable\r\nto accompany Mr. Buchanan), and Mrs. Sickles thus made her _debut_\r\nas the presiding lady of the bachelor Minister's establishment.\r\nIn 1857 Mr. Sickles entered Congress, and rented the \"Woodbury\r\nHouse,\" on Lafayette Square, where he lived in elegant style.  His\r\ncoaches, dinners, and parties were irreproachable, and Mrs. Sickles\r\nwas noted for her magnificent jewelry and beautiful toilettes.\r\nMr. Buchanan was a frequent visitor at their house, and was to have\r\nbeen godfather at the christening of Mr. Sickles' infant daughter,\r\nwith Mrs. Slidell as godmother, but an attack of whooping-cough\r\npostponed the ceremony.\r\n\r\nProminent among gentlemen \"in society\" at that time was District\r\nAttorney Key.  His father, in years past, had been a leading member\r\nof the Maryland Bar, practicing in Georgetown, and the family had\r\nalways been highly respected.  It was, however, as the author of\r\nthe \"Star Spangled Banner\" that the elder Mr. Key acquired a national\r\nfame.  One of his daughters, Mrs. Ellen Key Blunt, inherited her\r\nfather's poetical genius, and had, since her widowhood, become\r\nprominent as a reader in public.  Another daughter married Mr.\r\nGeorge Pendleton, then a Representative from Ohio.  Daniel, a son,\r\nwas killed in a duel by a Mr. May; and Philip Barton, having become\r\nsomewhat popular as a politician and a lawyer, received from Franklin\r\nPierce the appointment of District Attorney.  About that time he\r\nwas appointed Captain of the \"Montgomery Guards\" also, and looked\r\ngallantly in his green and gold uniform.  He married Miss Swann,\r\nof Baltimore, who died a few years afterward, leaving young children,\r\nand from that time Mr. Key's health had been very feeble.  The\r\nprevious winter (Mr. Buchanan having guaranteed him against rotation)\r\nhe went to Cuba, but was not at all benefitted.  Tall, slender,\r\nwith rather a sad yet handsome face, he was just the man to win a\r\nwoman's heart.  He was somewhat foppish, too, in his attire, riding\r\non horseback in white leather tights and high boots.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before Mr. Key was shot, he said to a young lady,\r\nwhom he joined on her way home from church:  \"I am despondent about\r\nmy health, and very desperate.  Indeed, I have half a mind to go\r\nout on the prairies and try buffalo hunting.  The excursion would\r\neither cure me or kill me, and, really, I don't care much which.\"\r\nSoon afterward, he saw, from the windows of his club-house, a signal\r\ndisplayed at the window of the residence of Mr. Sickles, across\r\nthe square, which informed him that Mrs. Sickles desired to see\r\nhim.  He had hardly left the club-house, however, when he was met\r\nby Mr. Sickles, who, without warning, drew a pistol and shot him\r\ndown like a dog.  He was taken into the club-house, which he had\r\nso recently left, and died in a few moments.  Mr. Sickles surrendered\r\nhimself at once and was imprisoned in the jail, where he enjoyed\r\nthe comforts of the keeper's room, and received the visits of many\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nMr. Sickles' trial came off in a few weeks before Judge Crawford,\r\nan old gentleman, whose intellect appeared to be somewhat clouded,\r\nbut who endeavored to conceal a lack of capacity by a testy,\r\nquerulous manner not especially imposing.  The prosecution was\r\nconducted by District Attorney Ould, prominent afterward in the\r\nConfederate service as having the charge of the exchange of prisoners.\r\nHe was educated for the Baptist ministry, and spoke with a somewhat\r\nclerical air.  It was not to be supposed that he would show\r\ningratitude to Mr. Buchanan for his appointment by over-exerting\r\nhimself to secure the punishment of one who was known to be a\r\nfavorite at the White House.  Mr. Carlisle, retained soon after\r\nthe murder by Mr. Key's friends to aid in the prosecution, was by\r\nmany regarded as the Choate of the District Bar.  Nervous in manner,\r\nyet cold at heart, crammed with the tricks of the law, and gifted\r\nwith a flow of language wherewith to cloak them, he brought with\r\nequal felicity the favorable points of his client's case into\r\nprominence, and showed great acuteness in suppressing or glossing\r\nover whatever might be prejudicial to his interest.  He was not,\r\nhowever, permitted to use much evidence touching the morality of\r\nthe prisoner and the manner in which the victim had been lured to\r\nhis tomb.\r\n\r\nThe defense was conducted by Edwin M. Stanton, previously known at\r\nWashington as a patent lawyer, and as having concluded successfully\r\nan important California land case for the Government.  He had a\r\nhead which Titian would have loved to paint, so massive were its\r\nproportions, and so sweeping were its long locks and beard.  He\r\nstood like a sturdy sentinel on guard before his client, pleading\r\nthe \"higher law\" in justification, and mercilessly attacking the\r\ncounsel on the other side whenever they sought to introduce damaging\r\nevidence.  He had as his aids-de-camp Messrs. Phillips, Chilton,\r\nand Radcliff, of the District Bar, each knowing well his Honor the\r\nJudge and the rest of the court.\r\n\r\nThen there were David R. Graham and James T. Brady, prominent New\r\nYork lawyers, who brought their eloquence to bear upon the jury,\r\nand were aided by T. F. Meagher, a glorious specimen of a rollicking\r\nIrish barrister.\r\n\r\nMr. Sickles sat in the dock, which was for all the world like the\r\nold-fashioned, square, high church pews.  He looked exactly as one\r\nwould imagine a successful New York city politician would look--\r\napparently affable, yet bent on success, and unrelenting in his\r\nopposition to those who sought to impede his progress.  When the\r\nverdict of acquittal came, there was a scene of tumultuous disorder\r\nin the court-room.   Mr. Stanton called in a loud tone for cheers,\r\nand rounds of them were given again and again.  President Buchanan\r\nwas delighted with the acquittal of \"Dan,\" as he familiarly called\r\nhim, and his friends gave him a round of supper-parties.\r\n\r\nAnson Burlingame, who was prominent in political and social circles\r\nat that eventful epoch, had transplanted the Western style of\r\noratory to Massachusetts, where he had married the daughter of a\r\nleading Whig, and entered political life through the \"Know-Nothing\"\r\ndoor.  He did not have much to say on the floor of the House, but\r\nhe was an indefatigable organizer, and rendered the Republican\r\nparty great service as, what is called in the English House of\r\nCommons, a \"whipper-in.\"  He prided himself on being recognized as\r\na man who would chivalrously defend himself if attacked, but he\r\nshowed no desire for fighting when hostilities became inevitable.\r\nHe then went abroad in a diplomatic capacity.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John Adams.\r\nJOHN ADAMS was born at Braintree, now Quincy, Mass., October 19th,\r\n1735; removed to Boston, 1768; was Delegate to first Congressional\r\nCongress, September, 1774; assisted in the Treaty of Peace, January,\r\n1783; was United States Minister to England, 1785-1788; was Vice-\r\nPresident with Washington, 1789-1797; was President of the United\r\nStates, 1797-1801; died July 4th, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nVISITS FROM DISTINGUISHED FOREIGNERS.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Embassy arrived in Washington on the 14th of May,\r\n1860, in the steamer Philadelphia, which brought them up the Potomac\r\nfrom the United States frigate Roanoke, on which they had come from\r\nJapan.  They were received at the Navy Yard with high honors, and\r\nescorted by the district militia to their quarters at Willard's\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nThe entire party numbered seventy-one.  The three Ambassadors were\r\nrather tall and thin in form, with long and sharp faces.  They had\r\njet-black hair, so far as any was left by the barber.  In dressing\r\nthe hair the men expended as much care as women, and took as much\r\npride and pleasure in its neat and fashionable adjustment.  It was\r\nshaved off to the very skin, except around the temples and low down\r\nin the back of the neck, from which it was brought up on all sides\r\nto the top of the head and fastened by a string.  It was then\r\ncarried forward, well stiffened with pomatum, in a queue about four\r\ninches long, and of the size of one's finger, and pointed over the\r\nfront part of the head, which was left completely denuded of all\r\nhair.  They dressed in silk robes, and wore two swords at their\r\nsides, according to universal usage with the higher classes of\r\ntheir land.  When they went in state to see the President they had\r\nlittle hats tied on the tops of their heads, and some of them had\r\nwater-proof hats along, but they generally went bare-headed, carrying\r\nfans to keep the sun's rays away from their eyes.  When not using\r\nthese fans they stuck them down back of their necks into their\r\nrobes.  They used the folds of cotton cloth swathed around them in\r\nplace of pockets.  President Buchanan entertained the eight highest\r\ndignitaries of the Embassy at a dinner-party, at which ladies were\r\npresent, and they attended evening parties given by Mrs. Slidell\r\nand by Madame Von Limburg, arriving at eight and leaving at nine.\r\nThey paid one visit to the Capitol, where they went in on the floor\r\nof the Senate by virtue of their diplomatic position, and after a\r\nshort stay crossed the rotunda to the House, where they took seats\r\nin the gallery set apart for the Diplomatic Corps.  A special\r\ncommittee, with John Sherman as Chairman, waited upon the three\r\nAmbassadors and invited them to take seats on the floor.  On the\r\nway they stopped to pay their respects to Mr. Speaker, in his\r\ngorgeous apartment, where they took a glass of champagne with him.\r\nThey then went on the floor and took seats at the right of the\r\nSpeaker's platform, where the members crowded around them.  Some\r\nchildren attracted their attention, and Master Dawes was taken on\r\nthe knee of the Japanese chief Ambassador while he was a guest of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of the mission of the Embassy was to get an\r\nEnglish copy of the treaty between Japan and the United States,\r\nsigned by the President.  The original was burned in the great fire\r\nat Jeddo in 1858.  The copy in Japanese was saved.  This they\r\nbrought with them, and a copy of it not signed, and a letter from\r\nthe Tycoon to the President.  The box containing these documents\r\nwas looked upon by them as almost sacred.  It was called the \"treaty\r\nbox,\" and was never allowed to be out of their sight.  It was a\r\nbox three feet long, twenty-six inches in depth, and eighteen inches\r\nwide, covered with red morocco leather, and neatly sewed around\r\nthe edges.  There were three japanned boxes placed together, and\r\nthen covered.  Around the box was a light framework, and when\r\ncarried was borne on a pole which rested on the shoulders of two\r\nstalwart policemen, closely followed by a Japanese with two swords\r\nin his girdle.\r\n\r\nSome of the caricatures sketched by the Japanese were excellent,\r\nand there was no mistaking Mr. Buchanan as they portrayed him.\r\nThey would not, however, sell one of these productions, even when\r\nfabulous prices were offered, replying:  \"_Mi sogo Miphon_\"--I will\r\ntake it to Japan.\r\n\r\nWhen President Buchanan learned that the Prince of Wales intended\r\nto visit Canada, he hastened to write to Queen Victoria, tendering\r\nto her son a cordial welcome should he extend his visit to the\r\nUnited States.  The invitation was accepted, and the Prince, who\r\ntraveled under the name of Lord Renfrew, with the gentlemen of his\r\nsuite, became the guests of Mr. Buchanan at the White House.  The\r\nheir-apparent, who was then rather stout and phlegmatic, appeared,\r\nlike Sir Charles Coldstream, to be \"used up,\" but he philosophically\r\nwent the rounds of the public buildings and was the honored guest\r\nat a public reception and at a diplomatic dinner.  He apparently\r\nenjoyed a visit, with Miss Lane, to a fashionable boarding-school\r\nfor young ladies, where he rolled several games of nine-pins with\r\nthe pupils, but he could not be induced to remain on the White\r\nHouse balcony at night in a drizzling rain watching fire-works that\r\nwould not always ignite.  Indeed, it was rumored that his Lordship\r\nhad slipped away from his guardian and visited some of the haunts\r\nof metropolitan dissipation.\r\n\r\nThe British party was taken to Mount Vernon on the revenue cutter\r\n\"Harriet Lane,\" accompanied by President Buchanan, Miss Lane, nearly\r\nall of the Diplomatic Corps, and the leading army, navy, and civil-\r\nservice officials.  President Buchanan escorted his guests to\r\nWashington's tomb, and the great-grandson of George III. planted\r\na tree near the grave of the arch-rebel against that monarch's\r\nrule.  That evening the Prince dined at the British Legation, where\r\nLord Lyons had invited the Diplomatic Corps to meet him, and the\r\nnext morning he left for Richmond.  When President Buchanan learned\r\nthat the expenses of the trip to Mount Vernon were to be paid from\r\na contingent fund at the Treasury Department, he objected, and\r\nwished to pay the bills himself, but Secretary Cobb finally paid\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan's courteous civility toward the Prince of Wales, and\r\nthe demonstrations made toward him in the Northern States, evidently\r\nmade a deep impression on Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort,\r\nwho also doubtless felt chagrined by the inhospitable manner in\r\nwhich the young traveler was treated in Virginia.  In the darkest\r\nhours of the Civil War which followed, when so many leading British\r\nstatesmen espoused the cause of the Confederates, Queen Victoria\r\nand Prince Albert were always friends of the Union.  Their restraining\r\ninfluence, at a period when there were many causes of alienation,\r\nundoubtedly prevented a recognition of the belligerent rights of\r\nthe Confederate States, which would have been followed by an alliance\r\nwith them as an established government.  Commercially this would\r\nhave been desirable for Great Britain, as it would have enabled\r\nher merchants to have obtained possession of the cotton crop, and\r\nto have paid for it with manufactured articles--British shipping\r\nenjoying the carrying trade.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan was very industrious, and gave personal attention\r\nto his official duties.  Rising early, he breakfasted, read the\r\nnewspapers, and was in his office every week-day morning at eight\r\no'clock.  There Mr. J. Buchanan Henry, his private secretary, laid\r\nbefore him the letters received by that morning's mail, filed and\r\nbriefed with the date, the writer's name, and a condensed statement\r\nof the contents.  Letters of a purely personal nature the President\r\nanswered himself, and he gave Mr. Henry instructions as to the\r\nreply to, or the reference of the others.  An entry was made in a\r\nbook of the brief on each letter, and the disposition of it if it\r\nwas referred to a Department.  This system enabled the President\r\nto ascertain what had been done with any letter addressed to him\r\nby reference to Mr. Henry's books.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan remained in his office, receiving such visitors\r\nas called, until one o'clock, when he went to luncheon.  Returning\r\nto his desk, he rarely left it before five o'clock, when, with few\r\nexceptions, he took a hour's walk.  He did not use his carriage a\r\ndozen times a year, except when he resided, during the summer, at\r\nthe Soldiers' Home, and drove in to the White House in the morning\r\nand back in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nOn his return from his daily \"constitutional\" walk, Mr. Buchanan\r\ndined, at six o'clock, with the members of his household.  He kept\r\nup the established etiquette of not accepting dinner invitations,\r\nand rarely attended evening parties or receptions, on the ground\r\nthat universal acceptance would have been impossible, and any\r\ndiscrimination would have given offense.  Once a week some of the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, accompanied by their wives, dined at the\r\nWhite House \"en famille,\" and, as there was no ceremony these were\r\nregarded as pleasant entertainments.\r\n\r\nA series of State dinners was given during each session of Congress,\r\nthe table in the large dining-room accommodating forty guests.\r\nThe first of these dinners, annually, was given to the Justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court and the law officers, the next to the Diplomatic\r\nCorps, and then to the Senators and Representatives in turn,\r\naccording to official seniority, except in a very few cases where\r\nindividuals had by discourtesy rendered such an invitation improper.\r\nMiss Lane and Mr. Henry issued the invitations and assigned seats\r\nto those who accepted them in order of precedence, which was rather\r\na delicate task.  Mr. Henry had also, in the short interval between\r\nthe arrival of the guests in the parlor and procession into the\r\ndining-room, to ascertain the name of each gentleman and tell him\r\nwhat lady he was to take in--probably introducing then to each\r\nother.  It was, he used to say, a very _mauvais quart d'heure_ to\r\nhim, as he was pretty sure to find at the last moment, when the\r\nPresident was leading the procession to the table, that some male\r\nguest, perhaps not accustomed to such matters, had strayed away\r\nfrom his intended partner, leaving the lady standing alone and much\r\nembarrassed.  He had then to give them a fresh start.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry, as private Secretary, was charged with the expenditure\r\nof the library fund, the payment of the steward, messengers, and\r\nalso with the expenditures of the household, which were paid out\r\nof the President's private purse.  These latter expenditures\r\ngenerally exceeded the President's salary in the winter months,\r\nbecause President Buchanan enjoyed entertaining and entertained\r\nliberally from inclination.  In summer, the social entertaining\r\nbeing much less, and the President being at the Soldiers' Home,\r\nthe expenses were much less.  The President's annual salary, then\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars, did not defray the actual household\r\nexpenses of the Executive Mansion.  Other Presidents had saved a\r\nconsiderable part of their salaries, but Mr. Buchanan had to draw\r\nupon his private means, not only for his expenses, but for his\r\ngenerous charities.  He also made it a rule, which other Presidents\r\nhad neglected, not to accept presents of any value, even from his\r\nmost intimate friends or political supporters, and it was a part\r\nof the duty of his private secretary, Mr. Henry, to return any\r\ngifts at once with the thanks of the President.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  James Buchanan\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN was born in Franklin County, Pa., April 22d, 1791;\r\nentered the Legislature of Pennsylvania when twenty-three years of\r\nage; was elected to Congress, 1820, where he served five terms;\r\nwas Minister to St. Petersburg, 1831-1833; was United States Senator,\r\n1833-1845; was Secretary of State under Polk, 1845-1849; was Minister\r\nto England, 1853-1856; was President of the United States, 1857-\r\n1861; died June 1st, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE GATHERING TEMPEST.\r\n\r\nThe clouds which had long been hovering portentously in our skies\r\nnow began to spread and to blacken all around the heavens.  This\r\nwas greatly intensified on all sides by the daring raid of John\r\nBrown, of Ossawattomie, Kansas.  Locating on a farm near Harper's\r\nFerry, Va., he organized a movement looking toward a general slave\r\ninsurrection.  Seizing the Armory of the United States Arsenal\r\nbuildings, all of which were destroyed during the war, he inaugurated\r\nhis scheme, and for a few hours had things his own way.  But troops\r\nwere rapidly concentrated; Brown's outside workers were captured\r\nor shot; the Arsenal building was fired into; one of his sons was\r\nkilled, another mortally wounded, and when the doors were forced\r\nBrown was found kneeling between their bodies.  His arrest, trial,\r\nand execution were speedily accomplished, but all the thunders of\r\na coming storm henceforth rolled all around the heavens.\r\n\r\nAt the South, the leaders used the excitement created by this affair\r\nto consolidate public opinion in their section and to cast opprobrium\r\non the Republicans at the North.  They saw that their ascendancy\r\nin the national councils was hastening to a close, and that if they\r\nwere to carry out their cherished plans for a dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and for the establishment of a Southern Confederacy, they\r\nmust strike the blow during the Administration of Mr. Buchanan.\r\nMeanwhile Washington ran riot with costly entertainments in society\r\nand secret suppers, at which the Abolitionists of the North and\r\nthe Secessionists of the South, respectively, plotted and planned\r\nfor the commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nOne of the neutral grounds, where men of both parties met in peace,\r\nwas the superbly furnished gambling-house of Pendleton, on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, known to its frequenters as \"The Hall of the Bleeding\r\nHeart,\" though he preferred the appellation, \"The Palace of Fortune.\"\r\nPendleton belonged to one of the first families of Virginia, and\r\nhis wife, a most estimable lady, was the daughter of Robert Mills,\r\nthe architect of the Treasury.  His rooms were hung with meritorious\r\npictures, and the art of wood-carving was carried to great perfection\r\nin the side-boards, secretaries, and tables, which served the\r\nvarious purposes of the establishment.  The dining and supper tables\r\nwere loaded with plate of pure metal.  The cooking would not have\r\nshamed the genius of Soyer, and it was universally admitted that\r\nthe wines were such as could have been selected only by a connoisseur.\r\nThis incomparable provider had ten thousand dollars invested in\r\nhis cellar and his closet.\r\n\r\nThe people who nightly assembled to see and to take part in the\r\nentertainments of the house consisted of candidates for the\r\nPresidency, Senators and Representatives, members of the Cabinet,\r\neditors and journalists, and the master workmen of the third house,\r\nthe lobby.  Pendleton's, in its palmiest days, might have been\r\ncalled the vestibule of the lobby.  Its most distinguished professors\r\nmight be found there.  They lent money to their clients when the\r\n\"animal scratched too roughly,\" that is to say, when the play ran\r\nagainst them, and they became \"broke,\" as they sometimes did.\r\nPendleton himself was an operator in the lobby.  His professional\r\nposition gave him great facilities.  He assisted in the passage of\r\nmany useful bills of a private nature, involving considerable sums\r\nof money.  A broker in parliamentary notes is an inevitable retainer\r\nof broker votes.\r\n\r\nIn the outer parlors, as midnight approached, might have been seen\r\nleading members of Congress, quietly discussing the day's proceedings,\r\nthe prospects of parties, and the character of public men.  A few\r\nofficers of the army added to the number and variety of the groups\r\nwhich occupied this apartment.  Here all were drinking, smoking,\r\nand talking, generally in a bright and jocose vein.  Servants were\r\ngliding about with cigars, toddies, cocktails, and \"whisky-straights\"\r\non little silver trays.  Among them were two \"old Virginny\" darkies,\r\nvery obliging and popular, who picked up many quarters and halves,\r\nand not a few \"white fish,\" representing one dollar each.\r\n\r\nBut the third room was the haunt of the tiger!  The company around\r\nthe faro table would be playing mostly with counters of red, circular\r\npieces of ivory, called fish, or chips, each of which represented\r\nfive dollars.  A few who were nearly \"broke\" would be using the\r\nwhite ones of one-fifth the value.  The players were silent as the\r\ngrave, because some of them were \"in great luck,\" and large piles\r\nof red chips were standing upon different cards to abide the event\r\nof the deal, but, alas! the close of the deal was unfavorable, and\r\nbefore the little silver box, from which the cards were drawn,\r\nyielded the last of the pack, the most of the red piles had been\r\ndrawn to the bank side.  But some of them had doubled, and the\r\nowners drew them down as capital for the chances of the next deal.\r\nIf one had great good fortune and some prudence, while possessor\r\nof the red piles before named, he would leave the house with his\r\nfew hundreds or thousands of dollars; but the chances were that\r\nbetween midnight and dawn the gamesters would all retire minus the\r\nmoney they had brought into the place, and all they had been able\r\nto borrow from friends.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, exceptions.  The largest amount ever won from\r\nthe proprietor at Pendleton's was twelve hundred dollars, for a\r\nstake of one hundred dollars.  When Humphrey Marshall was appointed\r\nMinister to China by President Pierce, in 1852, he lost his \"outfit\"\r\nand six months' pay, and was forced to accept a loan from Pendleton\r\nto enable him to reach the scene of his diplomatic labors.  When\r\nPendleton died, Mr. Buchanan attended his funeral, and several\r\nleading Democratic Congressmen were among his pall-bearers.  His\r\neffects, including the furniture of his gambling-house, were sold\r\nat auction, attracting crowds of the most fashionable people in\r\nWashington, and probably for the first time since the descent of\r\nProserpine, the gates of Hades were passed by troops of the fair\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nVice-President Breckinridge turned his back on the Union with marked\r\nregret.  One night, as a supper-party at Colonel Forney's, Mr.\r\nKeitt, of South Carolina, undertook to ridicule the Kentucky horse\r\nraisers.  Breckinridge stood it for awhile, but Keitt persisted in\r\nreturning to the blue-grass region for a location to his stories,\r\nand finally Breckinridge retorted.  He described a recent visit to\r\nSouth Carolina, and his meeting there with several of the original\r\nSecessionists.  One of them, who was a militia officer in Keitt's\r\nown district, had just returned from a muster arrayed in faded\r\nregimentals of blue jeans, with a dragoon's sword trailing at his\r\nside and a huge fore-and-aft chapeau surmounted with a long feather.\r\nHe was full of enthusiasm for the cause and descanted with particular\r\neloquence upon what he called the wrongs of the South.  \"'I tell\r\nyou, sah,' said he,\" continued Breckinridge, \"'we cannot stand it\r\nany longer; we intend to fight; we are preparing to fight; it is\r\nimpossible, sah, that we should submit, sah, not for a single hour,\r\nsah.'  I asked him, 'What are you suffering from?' and he replied:\r\n'Why, sah, we are suffering under the oppression of the Federal\r\nGovernment.  We have been suffering under it for twenty-five years\r\nand more, and we will stand it no longer.'\"  Breckinridge then\r\nturned toward Keitt, and continued, \"I advise my young friend here\r\nfrom South Carolina to visit some of his constituents before\r\nundertaking to go to war with the North, and advise them to go\r\nthrough the Northern states to learn what an almighty big country\r\nthey will have to whip before they get through.\"  Breckinridge was\r\nsincere in this remark, yet not many months had elapsed before he\r\nwas forced into secession by the agitators.\r\n\r\nThe re-opening of the slave-trade, by which negroes could be imported\r\nand sold for very low prices, was one of the allurements held out\r\nto the poor whites of the South.  A cargo was actually brought in\r\na yacht called the Wanderer, commanded by Captain Corrie, who\r\nobtained the requisite capital for the enterprise by obtaining the\r\npassage of a large claim for the military services of a South\r\nCarolina organization in the War of 1812.  Marshal Rynders suspected\r\nthe destination of the Wanderer when she was about to leave New\r\nYork, but he was persuaded to let her go.  A few months later she\r\nlanded near Brunswick, in Georgia, three hundred and fifty negroes,\r\nwho were speedily distributed over the Gulf States.  One or two\r\nwere seized by United States Marshals, but they were soon taken\r\nfrom them.  The experiment was a success.\r\n\r\nWhile the two House of Congress were convulsed by sectional strife\r\nthere was no cessation in the presentation of jobs, some of which\r\nwere disgraceful schemes for plundering the Treasury.  The most\r\nactive advocates of these swindles, and of some more meritorious\r\nlegislation which they were paid to advocate, were the lady lobbyists.\r\nSome of them were the widows of officers of the army or navy, others\r\nthe daughters of Congressmen, and others had drifted from home\r\nlocalities where they had found themselves the subjects of scandalous\r\ncomments.  The parlors of some of these dames were exquisitely\r\nfurnished with works of art and bric-a-brac, donated by admirers.\r\nEvery evening they received, and in the winter their blazing wood\r\nfires were surrounded by a distinguished circle.  Some would treat\r\nfavored guests to a game of euchre, and as midnight approached\r\nthere was always an adjournment to the dining-room, where a choice\r\nsupper was served.  A cold duck, a venison pie, broiled oysters,\r\nor some other exquisitely cooked dish with salads and cheese,\r\ngenerally constituted the repast, with iced champagne or Burgundy\r\nat blood-heat.  Who could blame the Congressman for leaving the\r\nbad cooking of his hotel or boarding-house, with an absence of all\r\nhome comforts, to walk into the parlor web which the adroit spider\r\nlobbyist had cunningly woven for him.\r\n\r\nWashington was enlivened during the recess of Congress by a visit\r\nfrom the \"Chicago Zouaves,\" a volunteer organization which had been\r\ncarefully trained by its young commander, Captain E. E. Ellsworth,\r\nin a novel drill based on the quick movements of the Moors.  The\r\nstaid old military organizations were magnetized by the rapid,\r\ntheatrical manner in which the Zouaves executed the manual and\r\nseveral gymnastic company movements.  Their uniform was loose\r\nscarlet trousers, gaiter boots, and buff-leather leggings, a blue\r\njacket trimmed with orange-colored braid, and a red cap with orange\r\ntrimmings; their scarlet blankets were rolled on the top of their\r\nknapsacks.  They drilled as light infantry, and moved like electric\r\nclocks.  The entire drill lasted nearly three hours, including\r\nstoppages for rest, a few moments each time, and, although performed\r\nunder a scorching sun on the hot sand, and comprising a series of\r\nvigorous exercises, the men stood it well, and attended strictly\r\nto their business.\r\n\r\nThe step of the Zouaves was in itself a peculiarity and strongly\r\nsuggestive of thorough pedestrian and gymnastic preparation.  The\r\ndiminutive stature of the men and their precision in accomplishing\r\nthe allotted length of the step, gave to it something of a steady\r\n_loping_ movement, but yet so firm and springy that the effect was\r\nmost animated.  Another feature in the general excellence of the\r\nZouaves was noted in their method of handling their arms, which,\r\ninstead of the inanimate and gingerly treatment so observable even\r\namong finely drilled companies when executing the manual, were\r\ngrasped with a nervous energy of action and shifted with a spirit\r\nwhich was thrillingly suggestive of a will, as well as the power,\r\nto act.  The visitors were quite boyish in appearance, and mostly\r\nof small stature, falling even below the ordinary size of short\r\nmen in our cities.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ellsworth was in appearance the most youthful of his corps,\r\nbut he had a finely marked countenance and a self-reliant manner.\r\nThe corps visited Mount Vernon, and was received at the White House\r\nby President Buchanan and Miss Lane.  After witnessing an exhibition\r\nof their performance, the President made a patriotic and prophetic\r\nlittle speech to Captain Ellsworth, concluding by the remark:  \"We\r\nwish you prosperity and happiness in peace--should war come, I know\r\nwhere you will be.\"  Within a short year the gallant officer lay\r\nin a soldier's grave.\r\n\r\nOwen Lovejoy, a Representative from Illinois, was one of the\r\nprominent Republican orators.  He was a man of considerable brains\r\nand a good deal of body, and his style of utterance was of the\r\nhyper-intense school.  On one occasion he begun his speech at the\r\ntop of a voice of most prodigious compass, and kept on in the same\r\nstrain, which, mildly described, might be characterized as a roar.\r\nWhen some waggish member on the Southern side cried, \"Louder!\" the\r\neffect upon the audience was convulsing.  There stood Lovejoy, with\r\nhis coat off and his collar open, his big, bushy head thrown back\r\nlike a lion at bay, and brandishing his arms aloft, while his whole\r\nbody rocked and quivered with excitement, hurling his denunciations\r\nnot at the slave-power this time, but at the Secessionists.  His\r\ntremendous voice rang through the hall like the peal of a trumpet,\r\nand when he described the insults to the old flag he was truly\r\neloquent.\r\n\r\nThe Southern conspirators endeavored to secure the co-operation of\r\nthe Indians, and delegations from several tribes were successively\r\nbrought to Washington, where they \"went the grand rounds\" of the\r\nhaunts of dissipation.  They were dirty, disgusting-looking fellows,\r\nwithout one particle of the romance about them with which Cooper\r\nhas invested the Indian character.  Several tribes joined the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, and fought desperately against the Union,\r\nwhich had for years before paid them liberal annuities.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Th. Jefferson\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON was born at Shadwell, Albemarle County, Va., April\r\n2d, 1743; was a member of the Virginia Legislature, 1769; was\r\nDelegate to the Continental Congress, 1775; re-entered the Virginia\r\nLegislature, 1777; was member of Congress, 1783; was Secretary of\r\nState under Washington, 1789-1793; was Vice-President with Adams,\r\n1797-1801; was President of the United States, 1801-1809; died July\r\n4th, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nLINCOLN'S ELECTION INAUGURATES REBELLION.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was elected President by the people on the 6th of\r\nNovember, 1860.  Three days afterward, Horace Greeley wrote to the\r\n_Tribune_ as follows:  \"If the Cotton States shall become satisfied\r\nthat they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist on\r\nletting them go in peace.\"  Less than a week after the election\r\nMr. Yancey said, in a public address, in Montgomery, his home, \"I\r\nhave good reason to believe that the action of any State will be\r\npeaceable--will not be resisted--under the present or any probable\r\nprospective condition of Federal affairs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met, the Senate occupied its new chamber.  The Southern\r\nconspirators in both Houses were outspoken and truculent, while\r\nthe Abolitionists were defiant and exasperating.  The message of\r\nPresident Buchanan was a non-committal document, showing that he\r\nwas perplexed and overwhelmed by what he had not the courage to\r\ncontrol.  Encouraged by his declaration that the Executive possessed\r\nno constitutional power to use the army and navy for the preservation\r\nof the life of the Republic, the Southern Senators at Washington,\r\nwho directed the movements of the Secessionists, were emboldened\r\nto direct them to withdraw from the Union and organize a Confederacy.\r\nMeanwhile some of them were to remain in Congress to defeat all\r\nhostile legislation.\r\n\r\nSenator Seward, who assumed the leadership of the Republicans in\r\nCongress, had been correctly described by Henry Clay as \"a man of\r\nno convictions.\"  He had not that magnetic mind which could\r\nsubordinate others, or the mental courage to take the helm in the\r\nhour of victory, but he relied upon the pecuniary operations of an\r\nunscrupulous lobby, which had followed him from Albany, and sought\r\nto fill its military chest with the spoils of the public printing\r\nand binding.  After long announcement the Senate Chamber was crowded\r\nto hear what he would have to say on the political situation.\r\nPolitical friends and political foes, the most conservative and\r\nthe most ultra, the Abolitionist from Vermont and the fire-eater\r\nfrom Mississippi, all looked upon that pale, slight figure in a\r\ngray frock coat--so calm, so self-possessed, so good-natured--as\r\nthe man who had but to speak the word and the country would be\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe speech had been carefully composed and elaborated, as was\r\neverything which emanated from that source.  It was in type before\r\nit was pronounced.  The manuscript lay before the Speaker on the\r\ndesk, but it was delivered almost entirely through the power of\r\nhis wonderful memory.  Senators gathered closely around him, and\r\nanxiously caught every syllable as it fell from his lips.  The\r\nspeaker seemed the only tranquil Senator there.  It appeared\r\nincredible that any man could present an exterior of such coolness\r\nand quietude, and apparently smiling unconcern, amid anxiety and\r\nexcitement so deep and intense.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward was not a graceful orator, but there was a certain\r\nimpressive manner corresponding with the importance of what he had\r\nto say which arrested the hearer's regard, and when he was evolving\r\nsome weighty maxim of political philosophy, and particularly during\r\nhis vivid delineations of the grandeur and power of the Union, and\r\nof the calamities which might follow its dissolution, every eye\r\nwas fixed upon him.  There were several quite dramatic passages in\r\nthe speech which roused the orator to more than usual animation.\r\nSuch were the allusions to the gray-headed Clerk of the Senate,\r\nthe contrast of the man-of-war entering a foreign port before and\r\nafter the dissolution of the Union, and the episode, where,\r\nenumerating by name the great men who had added glory to the\r\nRepublic, he said:  \"After all these have performed their majestic\r\nparts, let the curtain fall.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was an ingenious piece of literary composition, which\r\nhad been foreshadowed by a series of able editorials in the Albany\r\n_Evening Journal_, published as feelers of public opinion, and to\r\nprepare the way for this speech.  It was the hand of Weed, writing,\r\nbut the ideas were from the brain of Seward.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States soon began to secede, and their Senators and\r\nRepresentatives to leave the capital.  Jefferson Davis made a long\r\nfarewell speech, at the commencement of which he said:  \"Tears are\r\nnow trickling down the stern face of man, and those who have bled\r\nfor the flag of their country and are willing now to die for it,\r\nstand powerless.\"  As he proceeded he referred to the possession\r\nof Fort Sumter, and said that he had heard it said, by a gallant\r\ngentleman, that the great objection to withdrawing the garrison\r\nwas an unwillingness to lower the flag.  \"Can there,\" said he with\r\ndramatic effect, \"be a point of pride against laying upon that\r\nsacred soil to-day the flag for which our fathers died?  My pride,\r\nSenators, is different.  My pride is that that flag shall not set\r\nbetween contending brothers; and that, when it shall no longer be\r\nthe common flag of the country, it shall be folded up and laid\r\naway, like a vesture no longer used; that is shall be kept as a\r\nsacred memento of the past, to which each of us can make a pilgrimage\r\nand remember the glorious days in which we were born.\"  In concluding\r\nhis remarks, Mr. Davis invoked the Senators so to act that \"the\r\nAngel of Peace might spread her wings, through it be over divided\r\nStates; and the sons of the sires of the Revolution might still go\r\non in the friendly intercourse with each other, ever renewing the\r\nmemories of a common origin; the sections by the diversity of their\r\nproducts and habits, acting and reacting beneficially, the commerce\r\nof each might swell the prosperity of both, and the happiness of\r\nall be still interwoven together.  If there cannot be peace,\" he\r\nsaid, \"Mississippi's gallant sons will stand like a wall of fire\r\naround their State, and I go hence, not in hostility to you, but\r\nin love and allegiance to her, to take my place among her sons, be\r\nit for good or for evil.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Clingman, of North Carolina, who was one of the last to\r\nleave, compared the seceders to representative of the \"ten tribes\r\nof Israel!\"  Senator Hale, that genial hard-hitter, replied:  \"Ten\r\ntribes,\" said he, \"did go out from the kingdom of Israel, but the\r\nark of the living God remained with the tribe of Judah!\"  This was\r\nloudly applauded by the Republicans in the Senate galleries, and\r\nthe presiding officer had to pound lustily with his mallet to secure\r\norder.  Then Mr. Hale proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"I think the galleries ought to be excused for applauding a reference\r\nmade to the Scriptures.  I say, there is where the ark of the\r\ncovenant remained.  What became of the ten tribes?  They have gone,\r\nGod only knows where, and nobody else.  It is a matter of speculation,\r\nwhat became of them--whether they constitute the Pottawatomies or\r\nsome other tribe of savages.  But the suggestion of the Senator\r\nfrom North Carolina is full of meaning.  There were ten tribes went\r\nout, and remember, they went out wandering.  They left the ark and\r\nthe empire behind them.  They went, as I said before, God only\r\nknows where.  But, sir, I do hope and pray that this comparison,\r\nso eloquent and instructive, suggested by the honorable Senator,\r\nmay not be illustrated in the fate of these other tribes that are\r\ngoing out from the household of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nLate in January, 1861, the Legislature of Virginia proposed the\r\nappointment of commissioners, by each State, to meet at Washington\r\non the 4th day of February, and devise, if practicable, a plan for\r\nsettling the pending difficulties between the slave-holding and\r\nnon-slave-holding States.  This was at first met with a howl of\r\nopposition from the Northern Abolitionists, who feared that it\r\nmight lead to another compromise, but they soon changed front, and\r\nurged the Governors of their respective States to send pronounced\r\nanti-slavery delegations.  Twenty-one States were represented by\r\ngentlemen who had nearly all filled high political stations, and\r\nwho possessed ripe experience, wisdom, dignity, and weight of\r\ncharacter.  John Tyler was elected president, and the \"Peace\r\nCongress,\" as the organization styled itself, sat with great\r\nformality in the old Presbyterian Church, which had been converted\r\ninto a hall attached to Willard's Hotel.  A long series of resolutions\r\nwas discussed and adopted, but they were not of as much value as\r\nthe paper on which they were written.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Captain Stone, on the staff of General Scott, had\r\norganized the militia of the District of Columbia, and as the\r\nbirthday of Washington approached, they made arrangements for a\r\nparade, with two batteries of light artillery stationed at the\r\nArsenal.  Against this parade Mr. Tyler protested, and wrote a\r\nletter to the President, sharply rebuking him for having permitted\r\nthe parade.  Mr. Buchanan excused himself, saying that he \"found\r\nit impossible to prevent two or three companies of regulars from\r\njoining in the procession with the volunteers without giving\r\noffense to the tens of thousands of people who had assembled to\r\nwitness the parade.\"  Mr. Seward adroitly availed himself of the\r\nreverence for the \"old flag\" which had been awakened by Daniel\r\nWebster in his speeches in defense of the Union, and, in accordance\r\nwith his suggestion, the \"stars and stripes\" were freely displayed,\r\nevoking that love of country which is so vital a principle in the\r\nAmerican heart.\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the Southern members of the Cabinet had\r\ncompelled Mr. Buchanan to fill their places, General John A. Dix,\r\nthe new Secretary of the Treasury, sent Mr. W. Hemphill Jones, a\r\namiable old clerk, who wore a sandy wig, to New Orleans, with\r\ninstructions to secure, if possible, the bullion in the United\r\nStates Mint there.  Soon after Mr. Jones had arrived at New Orleans,\r\nhe informed the Secretary that Captain Brushwood, who commanded\r\nthe United States revenue cutter there, had refused to obey his\r\norders as a special agent of the Department, and mediated going\r\nover to the Secessionists.  Whereupon the Secretary telegraphed to\r\nJones to take possession of the revenue cutter, adding, \"If any\r\none attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.\"\r\nThis message never reached New Orleans, but it was made public,\r\nand received by the Northern people as an assurance that the Union\r\nwould be defended.  To those who knew the estimable old gentleman\r\nto whom the message was sent, the idea of his shooting down Captain\r\nBrushwood, or any one else, was simply ridiculous.  Indeed, he\r\nthanked his stars that he was able to get back to Washington\r\nunharmed.\r\n\r\nThe electoral votes for President and Vice-President were counted\r\nin the hall of the House on Wednesday, the 13th of February, 1861.\r\nVice-President Breckinridge presided over the two Houses \"in Congress\r\nassembled,\" and announced the result.\r\n\r\nAs the year advanced the alienation of the sections increased, and\r\nthe spirit of fraternity was so far extinguished as to close the\r\nminds and hearts of the people at the North and at the South to\r\nthe admission of any adjustment which would be honorable and\r\nsatisfactory to all conservative citizens.  The Government of the\r\nConfederate States was formally inaugurated at Montgomery, Alabama,\r\nwith Jefferson Davis as its President, and Alexander H. Stephens\r\nas its Vice-President.  Throughout the old South the new flag was\r\nflung to the breeze, and the old flag was as generally rejected.\r\nThe State Sovereignty, about which so much had been said, thenceforth\r\nstood in abeyance to the supreme authority of the new Government,\r\nwhich was clothed with all the powers of peace and war and of civil\r\nadministration.  Hostilities had virtually been declared, for, as\r\nthe States seceded, the Confederates had seized the arsenals, the\r\nnavy yards, the mints, the custom-houses, and the post-offices,\r\nwhile many officials--civil, military, and naval--had unceremoniously\r\nleft the service of the United States to enter that of the Confederate\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John PHale\r\nJOHN PARKER HALE was born at Rochester, New Hampshire, March 31st,\r\n1806; was a Representative from New Hampshire 1843-1845; was United\r\nStates Senator, 1847-1853, and again, 1855-1865; was Minister to\r\nSpain, 1865-1869; and died at Dover, New Hampshire, November 18th,\r\n1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nMR. LINCOLN AT THE HELM.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected arrival of Mr. Lincoln at Willard's Hotel early on\r\nthe morning of Saturday, February 23d, 1861, created quite a\r\nsensation when it became known in Washington.  It was not true, as\r\nasserted, that he came in disguise, although he wore a traveling\r\ncap and shawl which had been loaned him, and which very materially\r\nchanged his appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln felt confident that an attempt was to have been made\r\nto assassinate him as he passed through Baltimore.  Among other\r\nstatements which confirmed him in this opinion was one by Mr.\r\nChittenden, of Vermont, afterward Register of the Treasury.  Mr.\r\nChittenden was a delegate from the State of Vermont to the Peace\r\nCongress, then in session, one of the leading Southern members of\r\nwhich expressed great surprise on learning of Mr. Lincoln's arrival,\r\nand said, \"How in the mischief did he get through Baltimore?\"\r\nSenator Sumner was also one those who believed that the President-\r\nelect was in danger of assassination, and he wrote him after his\r\narrival, cautioning him about going out at night.  \"Sumner,\" said\r\nMr. Lincoln, \"declined to stand up with me, back to back, to see\r\nwhich was the taller man, and made a fine speech about this being\r\nthe time for uniting our fronts against the enemy and not our backs.\r\nBut I guess he was afraid to measure, though he is a good piece of\r\na man.  I have never had much to do with Bishops where I live, but,\r\ndo you know, Sumner is my idea of a Bishop.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, after eating his breakfast, made a formal call on\r\nPresident Buchanan at the White House, accompanied by Mr. Seward.\r\nHe then received the members of the Peace Congress, who had formed\r\nin procession in the hall where they met, and moved to the reception\r\nparlor of the hotel.  Ex-President Tyler and Governor Chase led\r\nthe van.  The latter did the honors, first introducing Mr. Tyler.\r\nMr. Lincoln received him with all the respect due to his position.\r\nThe several delegates were then presented by Governor Chase in the\r\nusual manner.  The greatest curiosity was manifested to witness\r\nthis, Mr. Lincoln's first reception in Washington.  The most\r\nnoticeable thing that occurred was the manifestation by Mr. Lincoln\r\nof a most wonderful memory.  It will be remembered that the Convention\r\nwas composed of many men, who, although distinguished in their\r\ntime, had not of late been very much known.  Each member was\r\nintroduced by his surname, but in nine cases out of ten, Mr. Lincoln\r\nwould promptly recall their entire name, no matter how many initials\r\nit contained.  In several instances he recited the historical\r\nreminiscences of families.  When the tall General Doniphan, of\r\nMissouri, was introduced, Mr. Lincoln had to look up to catch\r\nDoniphan's eye.  He immediately inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Is this Doniphan, who made that splendid march across the plains\r\nand swept the swift Comanches before him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I commanded the expedition across the plains,\" modestly replied\r\nthe General.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have come up to the standard of my expectation,\" rejoined\r\nMr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rives, of Virginia, was introduced, Mr. Lincoln said:  \"I\r\nalways had an idea that you were a much taller man.\"  He received\r\nJames B. Clay, son of the Kentucky statesman, with marked attention,\r\nsaying to him:  \"I was a friend of your father.\"  The interchange\r\nof greetings with Mr. Barringer, of North Carolina, who was his\r\ncolleague in Congress, was very cordial.  When Reverdy Johnson was\r\npresented, he expressed great rejoicing, remarking to him:\r\n\r\n\"I had to bid you good-bye just at the time when our intimacy had\r\nripened to a point for me to tell you my stories.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern Commissioners freely expressed their gratification at\r\nhis affability and easy manner, and all joined in expressing\r\nagreeable disappointment at his good looks in contrast to his\r\npictures.  Nothing was said to any one in regard to the condition\r\nof the country or the national troubles.  After the reception of\r\nthe Peace Congress was concluded, a large number of citizens were\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nA large number of ladies then passed in review, each being introduced\r\nby the gentleman who accompanied her, and Mr. Lincoln underwent\r\nthe new ordeal with much good humor.  All that day the hotel was\r\ncrowded with members of Congress and others, anxious to see the\r\nPresident-elect, of whom they had heard so much, and among them\r\nwere several newspaper corespondents, who had known him while he\r\nwas a member of the House of Representatives.  One of the correspondents\r\nwho talked with him about his forthcoming message received,\r\nconfidentially, the following account of it:\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln had written his message at his Springfield home, and\r\nhad had it put in type by his friend, the local printer.  A number\r\nof sentences had been re-constructed several times before they were\r\nentirely satisfactory, and then four copies had been printed on\r\nfoolscap paper.  These copies had been locked up in what Mr. Lincoln\r\ncalled a \"grip-sack,\" and intrusted to his oldest son, Robert.\r\n\"When we reached Harrisburg,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"and had washed\r\nup, I asked Bob where the message was, and was taken aback by his\r\nconfession that in the excitement caused by the enthusiastic\r\nreception he believed he had let a waiter take the grip-sack.  My\r\nheart went up into my mouth, and I started down-stairs, where I\r\nwas told that if a waiter had taken the article I should probably\r\nfind it in the baggage-room.  Hastening to that apartment, I saw\r\nan immense pile of grip-sacks and other baggage and thought that\r\nI had discovered mine.  The key fitted it, but on opening there\r\nwas nothing inside but a few paper collars and a flask of whisky.\r\nTumbling the baggage right and left, in a few moments I espied my\r\nlost treasure, and in it the all-important document, all right;\r\nand now I will show it to you--on your honor, mind!\"  The inaugural\r\nwas printed in a clear-sized type, and wherever Mr. Lincoln had\r\nthought that a paragraph would make an impression upon his audience,\r\nhe had preceded it with a typographical fist--\".\r\n\r\nOne copy of this printed draft of the inaugural message was given\r\nto Mr. Seward, and another to the venerable Franics P. Blair, with\r\nthe request that they would read and criticise.  A few unimportant\r\nchanges were made, and Mr. Nicolay, who was to be the President's\r\nprivate secretary, made the corrected copy in a fair hand, which\r\nMr. Lincoln was to read.  Mr. Nicolay corrected another copy, which\r\nwas furnished to the press for publication and is now in my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward had, from the moment that his offered services as\r\nSecretary of State were accepted, acted as chief of the incoming\r\nAdministration, and undertook to have a voice in the appointment\r\nof his associates.  Mr. Lincoln, however, was determined to make\r\nhis own selections.  The great contest was for the Treasury\r\nDepartment, the Pennsylvania Republicans urging the appointment of\r\nSimon Cameron, while Eastern and New York Republicans preferred\r\nSalmon P. Chase.  Ohio was not united in the support of Mr. Chase,\r\nbut he finally received the appointment, Mr. Cameron going into\r\nthe War Department, and Mr. Gideon Welles, of Connecticut, receiving\r\nthe Navy Department on the recommendation of Vice-President Hannibal\r\nHamlin, who was requested to select some one for that position.\r\nThe Blair interest was recognized by the appointment of Montgomery\r\nBlair as Postmaster-General, while Edward Bates, of Missouri, whose\r\nname had been mentioned as the Presidential candidate in opposition\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, was made Attorney-General.  The Interior Department\r\nwas given to Caleb W. Smith, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln were of an\r\nunusual character.  Many believed that an attempt would be made on\r\nthat day by the Secessionists to obtain possession of the Government,\r\nand great precautions against this were taken,  The ostensible\r\ndirector was General Scott, who had his head-quarters at a restaurant\r\nnear the War Department, and who rode about the city in a low coupe\r\ndrawn by a powerful horse.  But the real director of the military\r\noperations was Colonel Stone, of the regular army, who had been\r\norganizing the military of the District, and who had a very\r\nrespectable force at his command.  He had a battalion of the United\r\nStates Engineer Corps directly in the rear of the President's\r\ncarriage, and sharp-shooters belonging to a German company were\r\nposted on buildings all along the route, with orders to keep a\r\nvigilant watch as the President's carriage approached, and to fire\r\nat any one who might aim a weapon at the President.  There was also\r\na large force of detectives stationed along the route and at the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nThe procession was a very creditable one, the United States troops\r\nand the District Militia making a fine show, with the Albany Burgess\r\nCorps, and a few organizations from a distance.  Mr. Lincoln rode\r\nwith President Buchanan, and, on arriving at the Capitol, entered\r\nthe Senate Chamber leaning on the old gentleman's arm.  After Mr.\r\nHamlin had taken his oath of office as Vice-President, and several\r\nnew Senators had been sworn in, a procession was formed, as usual,\r\nwhich repaired to the platform erected over the steps of the eastern\r\nportico of the Capitol.  When Mr. Lincoln came out he was easily\r\ndistinguished as his tall, gaunt figure rose above those around him.\r\n\r\nHis personal friend, Senator Baker, of Oregon, introduced him to\r\nthe assemblage, and as he bowed acknowledgments of the somewhat\r\nfaint cheers which greeted him the usual genial smile lit up his\r\nangular countenance.  He was evidently somewhat perplexed, just\r\nthen, to know what to do with his new silk hat and a large gold-\r\nheaded cane.  The cane he put under the table, but the hat appeared\r\nto be too good to place on the rough boards.  Senator Douglas saw\r\nthe embarrassment of his old friend, and, rising, took the shining\r\nhat from its bothered owner and held it during the delivery of the\r\ninaugural address.  Mr. Lincoln was listened to with great eagerness.\r\nHe evidently desired to convince the multitude before him rather\r\nthan to bewilder or dazzle them.  It was evident that he honestly\r\nbelieved every word that he spoke, especially the concluding\r\nparagraphs, one of which I copy from the original print:\r\n\r\n\"\"I am loth to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must\r\nnot be enemies.  Though passion may be strained, it must not break\r\nour bonds of affection.  \"The mystic chords of memory which stretch\r\nfrom every battle-field and patriot grave to every loved heart and\r\nhearthstone, all over our broad land, will yet swell the chorus of\r\nthe Union when again touched, as they surely will be, by the better\r\nangels of our nature.\"\r\n\r\nHaving closed his address, Mr. Lincoln was escorted to the White\r\nHouse, where he received the public for an hour, after which the\r\ndoors were closed.  The new Administration was thus successfully\r\nlaunched, and the Secretaries went to work to see what remained in\r\nthe National coffers, arsenals, navy yards, and armories.  The most\r\nimportant public measures were decided by Mr. Lincoln and one or\r\ntwo of his Cabinet officers without consultation with the others.\r\nIndeed, as hostilities approached, each member of the Cabinet was\r\ntoo busily engaged with his own official duties to discuss those\r\nof his colleagues, and Mr. Seward never wanted any criticism on\r\nhis management of diplomatic affairs, any more than Mr. Cameron or\r\nMr. Welles tolerated interference with the conduct of the war.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Your friend as ever\r\n  A. Lincoln\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN was born in Hardin County, Kentucky, February 12th,\r\n1809; was in early life a farmer, a boatman, and a land surveyor,\r\nafter which he studied law and practiced at Springfield, Illinois;\r\nwas a Representative from Illinois to Congress, 1847-1849; was an\r\nunsuccessful candidate for United States Senator, in opposition to\r\nStephen A. Douglas, in 1858; was elected President of the United\r\nStates in 1860 as a Republican, and was inaugurated March 4th,1861;\r\nissued the first call for troops April 15th, 1861, and the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation January 1st, 1863; was re-elected President in\r\n1864, and was again inaugurated March 4th, 1865; was assassinated\r\nApril 14th, and died April 15th, 1865; he was buried at Springfield,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE STORM BURSTS.\r\n\r\nWashington City presented a strange spectacle during the first\r\nmonth after the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln.  Many of the Southern\r\nsojourners had gone to their respective States, while others, some\r\nof them holding important civil, military, and naval positions,\r\nremained, truculent and defiant, to place every obstacle in the\r\nway of coercion by the Federal Government.  The North sent an army\r\nof office-seekers to the metropolis, and Mr. Lincoln was forced to\r\nlisten to the demands of men who had made political speeches, or\r\nwho had commanded companies of \"Wide-Awakes,\" and who now demanded\r\nlucrative offices in return.\r\n\r\nAmong other officers of the army who resigned their commissions\r\nwas Colonel Robert E. Lee, who was sent for by General Scott, and\r\nasked point-blank whether he intended to resign with those officers\r\nwho proposed to take part with their respective states, or to remain\r\nin the service of the Union.  Colonel Lee made no reply, whereupon\r\n\"Old Chapultepec\" came directly to the point, saying, \"I suppose\r\nyou will go with the rest.  If your purpose is to resign, it is\r\nproper you should do so at once.  Your present attitude is an\r\nequivocal one.\"  \"General,\" Colonel Lee then answered, \"the property\r\nbelonging to my children, all that they possess, lies in Virginia.\r\nThey will be ruined if they do not go with their State.  I cannot\r\nraise my hand against my children.\"  General Scott then signified\r\nthat he had nothing further to say.  Colonel Lee, with a respectful\r\nbow, withdrew, and the next morning tendered his resignation, which\r\nwas accepted five days afterward.  Between the interview and the\r\nacceptance of Colonel Lee's resignation, General Shiras was sitting\r\nin the room of Adjutant-General Lorenzo Thomas, when Colonel Lee\r\ncame in and walked up to the side of the table opposite to that at\r\nwhich General Thomas was sitting, saying:  \"General Thomas, I am\r\ntold you said I was a traitor.\"  General Thomas arose, and looking\r\nhim in the eye, replied, \"I have said so; do you wish to know on\r\nwhat authority?\"  \"Yes,\" said Colonel Lee.  \"Well, on the authority\r\nof General Scott.\"  Colonel Lee muttered, \"There must be some\r\nmistake,\" turned on his heel, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe long expected crisis came at last.  Seven thousand armed\r\nConfederates attacked the seventy Union soldiers who garrisoned\r\nFort Sumter, and forced them to haul down the stars and stripes on\r\nthe 11th of April, 1861.  Four days afterward President Lincoln\r\nissued his proclamation, calling for seventy-five thousand militiamen,\r\n\"to maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our\r\nNational Government, and to redress wrongs already long enough\r\nendured.\"  This proclamation was flashed over the wires throughout\r\nthe Northern States, like the fiery cross of Rhoderick Dhu, which\r\nsummoned his clansmen to their rendezvous, and it was everywhere\r\nreceived with the beating of drums and the ringing notes of the\r\nbugle, calling the defenders of the capital to their colors.  Every\r\ncity and hamlet had its flag-raising, while its enthusiasm was\r\nunbounded.  Here and there a newspaper ventured to apologize for\r\nthe South, but the editor would soon be forced by a mob to display\r\nthe stars and stripes, amid the cheers and the shouts of those\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThe North proved itself ready for the emergency.  The arguments of\r\nDaniel Webster against the right of secession, which, when delivered\r\nby him, were regarded by many as mere topics for the display of\r\npolitical eloquence, had fixed the opinion of the North, and there\r\nwas a general uprising for the defense of the capital and the old\r\nflag.  Even the Abolitionists, who had denounced the Union, the\r\nConstitution, the national ensign, and its martial defenders,\r\nseriously entered into the military movements, as they saw in the\r\nexercise of the war power the long desired panacea for the faults\r\nof slavery.  Those who had jeered at the Southern threats of disunion\r\nas empty bluster, and at the Northern conservatives as cowardly\r\ndoughfaces, became zealous Union men, although it must be confessed\r\nthat very few of them took their lives in their hands and actually\r\nwent to the front.  The raising of troops went forward with a bound,\r\nand the wildest excitement and enthusiasm attended the departure\r\nof regiments for the seat of war.  The seriousness of the emergency\r\nwas not overlooked, but high above that consideration rose the tide\r\nof patriotic feeling, and swept all obstacles before it.\r\n\r\nThe first troops to arrive at the National Capital were four\r\ncompanies of unarmed and ununiformed Pennsylvanians, who came from\r\nthe mining districts, expecting to find uniforms, arms, and equipments\r\non their arrival at Washington.  Stones were thrown at them as they\r\nmarched through Baltimore to take the cars for Washington, where\r\nthey were received at the station by Captain McDowell, of the\r\nAdjutant-General's department, who escorted them to the Capitol,\r\nwhere arrangements had been made for quartering them temporarily\r\nin the hall of the House of Representatives.  The sun was just\r\nsetting over the Virginia hills as the little column ascended the\r\nbroad steps of the eastern portico and entered the rotunda, through\r\nwhich they marched.  With one of the companies was the customary\r\ncolored attendant, whose duty it was on parade to carry the target\r\nor a pail of ice-water.  He had been struck on the head in Baltimore,\r\nand had received a scalp wound, over which he had placed his\r\nhandkerchief, and then drawn his cap down tight over it.  When Nick\r\nBiddle (for that was his name), entered the rotunda, he appeared\r\nto think he was safe, and took off his cap, with the handkerchief\r\nsaturated with blood, which dripped from it and marked his path\r\ninto the hall of the House of Representatives.  It was the first\r\nblood of the war.\r\n\r\nThe next day came the old Massachusetts Sixth, which had been shot\r\nat and stoned as it passed through Baltimore, and which returned\r\nthe fire with fatal effect.  The Sixth was quartered in the Senate\r\nwing of the Capitol.  Colonel Jones occupied the Vice-President's\r\nchair in the Senate Chamber, his colors hanging over his head from\r\nthe reporters' gallery.  At the clerk's desk before him, Adjutant\r\nFarr and Paymaster Plaisted were busy with their evening reports,\r\nwhile Major Watson, with Quartermaster Munroe were seeing that the\r\ncompanies were distributed in the various corridors and obtaining\r\ntheir rations.  After a four-and-twenty hours' fast the men had\r\neach one ration of bacon, bread, and coffee, which they had to\r\nprepare at the furnace fires in the basements.  The moment hunger\r\nwas appeased the cushioned seats in the galleries were occupied by\r\nthose fortunate enough to obtain such luxurious sleeping accommodations,\r\nwhile others \"bunked\" on the tile floors, with their knapsacks for\r\npillows, and wrapped in their blankets.  Stationery was provided\r\nfrom the committee-rooms, and every Senator's desk was occupied by\r\na \"bould sojer boy,\" inditing an epistle to his friends.\r\n\r\nThat night the censorship of the press was exercised for the first\r\ntime at the telegraph office.  Colonel Stone had seized the steamers\r\nwhich ran between Washington and Aquia Creek, and another steamer,\r\nthe St. Nicholas, which had been loaded with flour and other stores,\r\nostensibly for Norfolk, but which he believed would have gone no\r\nfurther down the river than Alexandria, where they would have been\r\nturned over to the Confederate quartermaster's department.  Colonel\r\nStone, believing that this seizure should be kept quiet, obtained\r\nfrom Secretary Cameron an order to seize the telegraph and to\r\nprevent the transmission of any messages which were not of a strictly\r\nprivate nature.  When the correspondents wished to telegraph the\r\nlists of the dead and wounded of the Massachusetts Sixth they found\r\na squad of the National Rifles in possession of the office, with\r\norders to permit the transmission of no messages.  Hastening to\r\nhead-quarters, they found Colonel Stone, but he told them that he\r\nhad no discretion in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe correspondents then drove to the house of Secretary Seward.\r\nThe Secretary of State received them very cordially, and would\r\nneither admit nor deny that he had advised the censorship of the\r\npress.  He said, however, in his semi-jocular way, \"The affair at\r\nBaltimore to-day was only a local outbreak, for which the regimental\r\nofficers, who had ridden through the city in a car, leaving some\r\nof the companies to follow on foot without a commander, were\r\nresponsible.  To send your accounts of the killed and wounded,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Seward, \"would only influence public sentiment, and be an\r\nobstacle in the path of reconciliation.\"  Then, having offered his\r\nvisitors refreshments, which were declined, he bowed them out.\r\nThey returned to the telegraph office, where their wrath was\r\nmollified by learning that the wires had all been cut in Baltimore.\r\nIt was nearly a week before telegraphic communication was re-\r\nestablished between Washington and the loyal North, but thenceforth,\r\nuntil the close of the war, a censorship of press dispatches was\r\nkept up, at once exasperating and of little real use.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a general uprising was going on.  Young Ellsworth, who\r\nhad accompanied Mr. Lincoln from Springfield, in the hope of being\r\nplaced at the head of a bureau of militia in the War Department,\r\nhad gone to New York and raised, in an incredibly small space of\r\ntime, a regiment composed almost exclusively of the members of the\r\nVolunteer Fire Department, which stimulated the organization of\r\nother commands.  Rhode Island sent a regiment, under the command\r\nof Colonel Burnside, composed of skilled mechanics, gentlemen\r\npossessing independent fortunes, and active business men, all\r\nwearing plain service uniforms.\r\n\r\nCommunication with Washington was re-opened by General Butler, who,\r\nfinding that the bridges between the Susquehanna River and the city\r\nof Baltimore had been burned, went on the steam ferry-boat from\r\nHavre de Grace around to Annapolis at the head of the Massachusetts\r\nEighth.  On their arrival at Annapolis it was found that the\r\nsympathizers with secession had partially destroyed the railroad\r\nleading to Washington, and had taken away every locomotive with\r\nthe exception of one, which they had dismantled.  It so happened\r\nthat a young mechanic, who had aided in building this very engine,\r\nwas in the ranks of the Massachusetts Eighth, and he soon had it\r\nin running order, while the regiment, advancing on the railroad,\r\nfished up from the ditches on either side the rails which had been\r\nthrown there, and restored them to their places.  They thus rebuilt\r\nthe road and provided it with an engine, so that when the New York\r\nSeventh arrived it was a comparative easy matter for it to proceed\r\nto the national metropolis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Washington City had been for several days without hearing\r\nfrom the loyal North.  At night the camp-fires of the Confederates,\r\nwho were assembling in force, could be seen on the southern bank\r\nof the Potomac, and it was not uncommon to meet on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue a defiant Southerner openly wearing a large Virginia or\r\nSouth Carolina secession badge.  The exodus of clerks from the\r\ndepartment continued, and they would not say good-bye, but _au\r\nrevoir_, as they confidently expected that they would be back again\r\ntriumphant within a month.  An eloquent clergyman, who was among\r\nthose who went to Richmond, left behind him, in the cellar of his\r\nhouse, a favorite cat, with what he judged would be a three weeks'\r\nsupply of water and provisions, so confident was he that President\r\nDavis would, within that time, occupy the White House.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest, the best equipped, and the best drilled of the\r\nvolunteer regiments that came pouring into Washington when the\r\ncommunication was re-opened was the New York Fire Zouaves, commanded\r\nby Colonel Ellsworth.  A hardy set of fellows, trained to fight\r\nfire, they professed great anxiety to meet the Confederates in\r\nhostile array, and they were very proud of their boyish commander.\r\nPresident Lincoln took a great interest in Colonel Ellsworth, and\r\nwhen Virginia formally seceded, he obtained from Secretary Cameron\r\nan order for the New York Fire Zouaves and the First Michigan\r\nInfantry to occupy Alexandria.  They went on the ferry-boats, very\r\nearly in the morning on Friday, May 24th, escorted by the war\r\nsteamer Pawnee, and occupied the old borough without opposition.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the troops on shore, than Colonel Ellsworth, taking\r\nhalf a dozen of his men, went to the Marshall House, over the roof\r\nof which floated a large Confederate flag, which had been visible\r\nwith a glass from the window of Mr. Lincoln's private office.\r\nEntering the public room of the hotel, he inquired of a man there\r\nwhether he was the proprietor, and being answered in the negative,\r\nhe took one private with him, and ran up-stairs.  Going out on the\r\nroof, Ellsworth secured the flag, and as he was descending, James\r\nWilliam Jackson, the proprietor of the hotel, came from his room,\r\narmed with a double-barreled shot-gun.  \"I have the first prize,\"\r\nsaid Ellsworth, to which Jackson responded, \"And I the second,\" at\r\nthe same time firing at him with fatal effect.  Before he could\r\nfire the second barrel, Private Brownell shot him dead, and as he\r\nfell, pinned him to the floor with the sword-bayonet on his rifle.\r\nColonel Ellsworth's remains were taken to Washington, where President\r\nLincoln visited them, exclaiming, as he gazed on the lifeless\r\nfeatures:  \"My boy! my boy! was it necessary this sacrifice should\r\nbe made!\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  E. E. Ellsworth\r\nEPHRAIM ELMER ELLSWORTH, born at Mechanicsville, Saratoga County,\r\nNew York, in 1837; removed to Chicago before he was of age, and\r\nstudied law; in 1859, organized his Zouave corps, noted for the\r\nexcellence of its discipline, and gave exhibition drills in the\r\nchief Eastern cities.  On the opening of hostilities, raised a\r\nregiment, known as the New York Fire Zouaves; was sent to Alexandria\r\non Friday morning, May 24th, 1861, when he was killed in the Marshall\r\nHouse.  He was buried in the cemetery of his native place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\"ON TO RICHMOND.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln having called a special session of Congress, the two\r\nHouses met on the 4th of July, 1861.  There were many vacant seats,\r\nbut some of those who sympathized with the South lingered that they\r\nmight throw obstacles before any attempt at coercion.  Meanwhile\r\nthe Abolitionists, who feared a compromise and a reconciliation,\r\nechoed the shout \"On to Richmond!\"  The \"Grand Army of the Union,\"\r\nhastily organized into brigades and divisions, was placed under\r\nthe command of General Irwin McDowell, a gallant soldier, entirely\r\ndestitute in the experience of handling large bodies of men.  The\r\ntroops thus brigaded had never even been manoeuvred together, nor\r\nhad their commander any personal knowledge of many of the officers\r\nor men.  But the politicians at the Capitol insisted on an immediate\r\nadvance.  They saw with admiration the gallant appearance of the\r\nwell-equipped regiments that were to compose the advancing column,\r\nand they believed, or professed to believe, that it could easily\r\nmarch \"On to Richmond!\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, July 21st, 1861, the \"Grand Army of the Union\" began\r\nits forward march.  The sun rose in a cloudless sky, and the\r\nadvancing columns of Union soldiers, with glistening bayonets and\r\ngay flags, moved with measured tread through the primeval forests\r\nof the Old Dominion, apparently as resistless as the sweep of\r\ndestiny.  Meanwhile there drove out from Washington to General\r\nMcDowell's headquarters a crowd of Congressmen, correspondents,\r\ncontractors, and camp-followers, who had come in a variety of\r\nvehicles to witness the fight, as they would have gone to see a\r\nhorse-race or to witness a Fourth of July procession.  The Congressmen\r\ndid not hesitate to intrude themselves upon General McDowell, and\r\nto offer him their advice.  Others, unpacking baskets of provisions,\r\nenjoyed their lunches after the cannonading had commenced.\r\n\r\nThere was brave fighting on both sides in the Bull Run Valley,\r\nwhich became like a boiling crater, from which arose dense clouds\r\nof dust and smoke.  At one time General Bee, well-nigh overwhelmed,\r\ngreeted General Thomas J. Jackson with the exclamation, \"General,\r\nthey are beating us back!\"  To which the latter replied promptly,\r\n\"Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\"  General Bee immediately\r\nrallied his over-tasked troops, saying \"There is Jackson with his\r\nVirginians, standing like a stone wall.  Let us determine to die\r\nhere, and we will conquer.\"  From that day General Jackson was\r\nknown by the soldiers on both sides as \"Stonewall\" Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the force commanded by General Joe Johnston, which\r\nGeneral Patterson had failed to hold in check, and the presence of\r\nPresident Jefferson Davis, inspired the Confederate troops with\r\nsuperhuman courage, while the Union regiments, badly officered,\r\nfollowed the example of the New York Zouaves, and fled in wild\r\ndisorder.  The panic became general, and disorder soon degenerated\r\ninto a disgraceful retreat.  The Confederates, however, found\r\nthemselves in no condition to follow up the victory which they had\r\ngained, and to press on to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe rout of Bull Run, while it was a severe rebuke to the politicians\r\nwho had forced it, secured the support of every loyal man in the\r\nNorthern States for the Union cause, whatever his previous political\r\nconvictions might have been.  Practical issues were presented, and\r\nevery man able to bear arms or to contribute money was animated by\r\nthe sentiment uttered by Stephen A. Douglas in his last public\r\nspeech, when he said:  \"The conspiracy is now known; armies have\r\nbeen raised; war is levied to accomplish it.  There are only two\r\nsides to the question: every man must be for the United States or\r\nagainst it.  There can be no neutrals in this war--only Republicans\r\nor traitors.\"\r\n\r\nThe week after the Battle of Bull Run, Senator Breckinridge, who\r\nhad retained his seat, made an appeal for the cessation of hostilities,\r\nspeaking eloquently of the horrors of war, the cost of maintaining\r\narmies, the dangers of military despotism, and the impossibility\r\nof ever subjugating the South.  He pleaded for peace with the\r\nrebels, and from the event of the great battle near Manassas he\r\ndrew an augury of defeat to the cause of the Government on future\r\nbattlefields.\r\n\r\nSenator Baker was on the floor of the Senate for the first time in\r\nmany days, having just come to Washington with his California\r\nRegiment, whom he had been busily engaged in organizing in Philadelphia\r\nand elsewhere, and at whose head he fell.  The white-haired but\r\nvigorous and active Senator listened attentively to the sentiments\r\nand predictions of Breckinridge, pacing the Senate floor back and\r\nforth with his eyes fastened on him, and now and then chafing with\r\nvisible impatience to reply.  At length Breckinridge ceased, and\r\nBaker took the floor, and proceeded, with a skillful and unsparing\r\nhand, to dissect the sophistry and falsehood of the treason that\r\nhad just been uttered.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he in conclusion, \"it is not a question of men or of\r\nmoney.  All the money, all the men, are, in our judgment, well\r\nbestowed in such a cause.  Knowing their value well, we give them\r\nwith the more pride and the more joy.  But how could we retreat?\r\nHow could we make peace?  Upon what terms?  Where is to be your\r\nboundary line?  Where the end of the principles we shall have to\r\ngive up?  What will become of public liberties?  What of past\r\nglories?  What of future hopes?  Shall we sink into the insignificance\r\nof the grave--a degraded, defeated, emasculated people, frightened\r\nby the results of one battle, and scared at the vision raised by\r\nthe imagination of the Senator from Kentucky upon the floor?  No,\r\nsir! a thousand times, no, sir!  We will rally the people--the\r\nloyal people of the whole country.  They will pour forth their\r\ntreasure, their money, their men, without stint, without measure.\r\nShall one battle determine the fate of empire, or a dozen--the loss\r\nof one thousand men or twenty thousand, or one hundred million or\r\nfive hundred millions of dollars?  In a year's peace--in ten years,\r\nat most, of peaceful progress--we can restore them all.  There will\r\nbe some graves reeking with blood, watered by the tears of affection.\r\nThere will be some privation; there will be some loss of luxury;\r\nthere will be somewhat more need for labor to procure the necessaries\r\nof life.  When that is said, all is said.  If we have the country,\r\nthe whole country, the Union, the Constitution--free government--\r\nwith these there will return all the blessings of well-ordered\r\ncivilization; the path of the country will be a career of greatness\r\nand of glory, such as, in the olden time, our fathers saw in the\r\ndim visions of years yet to come, and such as would have been ours\r\nnow, to-day, if it had not been for the treason for which the\r\nSenator too often seeks to apologize.\"  The orator took his seat\r\nafter this lofty and impassioned appeal, little dreaming that he\r\nwould be one of the first to fulfill his own prophecy.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the war were now made in good earnest.  Regiments\r\nwere recruited for three years, and, on their arrival at Washington,\r\nwere carefully inspected and organized into brigades and divisions,\r\nand officered by men of ability and military experience.  Other\r\nforces were organized at the West, and the Administration of\r\nPresident Lincoln displayed remarkable energy in equipping the\r\narmies which were to act in different sections of the country, and\r\nin raising money for their support.\r\n\r\nGeneral George B. McClellan, when he assumed command of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, was the beau ideal of a dragoon leader.  His legs,\r\nlike those of General Taylor, were short in proportion to his body,\r\nso that he appeared to be small in stature when on foot, but, when\r\nmounted on his favorite charger, he looked as tall, if not taller,\r\nthan those around him.  He possessed a good head, firmly planted\r\non a sturdy neck, upon ample shoulders.  He wore his hair cut short\r\nand his cheeks and massive jaw-bones shaven clean, while a well-\r\nshapen moustache gave dignity to his features.  His complexion was\r\nruddy, his eyes blue, and the lines of his mouth indicated good-\r\nhumor and firmness in about equal proportions.  His dress was plain,\r\nwith the least possible insignia of rank, and his headquarters at\r\nthe residence of Commodore Wilkes, long occupied by Mrs. Madison,\r\nwas always thronged with visitors.  His confidential aides were\r\nregular officers trained in many a hard campaign, and he had at\r\nhis side, in his father-in-law, Colonel R. B. Marcy, of the army,\r\nan experienced military counselor.\r\n\r\nWhen Lieutenant-General Scott, after having resigned his command,\r\nwas about to leave Washington for West Point, his young successor\r\ncalled upon him to say good-bye, and they had a long conference.\r\nAt its conclusion the old hero of three wars, said:  \"General, do\r\nnot allow yourself to be entangled by men who do not comprehend\r\nthis question.  Carry out your own ideas, act upon your own judgment,\r\nand you will conquer, and the Government will be vindicated.  God\r\nbless you!\"  General McClellan, who was then eulogized as a second\r\nNapoleon, soon found himself \"embarrassed\" by men who feared that\r\nhe might become President if he conquered peace.  He was also\r\nimpressed with this Presidential idea by pretended friends who had\r\nfastened themselves upon him, and \"between two stools he fell to\r\nthe ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Mason and Slidell to the English Government, after\r\ntheir capture by one of our war vessels, was a sad sacrifice, and\r\nmany at Washington were of the opinion that they should have been\r\nretained at every hazard.  Some suggested an international arbitration,\r\nbut President Lincoln, fortified by the advice of Charles Sumner\r\nand Caleb Cushing, saw plainly that the submission of the case to\r\narbitration would be equivalent to a surrender.  Secretary Seward,\r\nin his communication to Lord Lyons, the British Minister, which\r\nthe President revised before it was sent, said, in the most emphatic\r\nterms, that international law, particularly the American intent of\r\nit, as recorded in all our policy that has become historic, was\r\nagainst us.  He said:  \"This Government could not deny the justice\r\nof the claim presented.  We are asked to do by the British nation\r\njust what we have always insisted of nations before to do to us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner came gallantly to Mr. Seward's rescue, and made a long\r\nspeech in the Senate before crowded galleries, showing that the\r\nseizure of Mason and Slidell on board of a neutral ship could not\r\nbe justified according to our best American precedents.  \"Mr.\r\nPresident,\" said he, in his deep-toned voice, \"let the rebels go.\r\nTwo wicked men, ungrateful to their country, are let loose with\r\nthe brand of Cain upon their foreheads.  Prison doors are opened,\r\nbut principles are established which will help to free other men,\r\nand to open the gates of the sea.  Amidst all present excitement,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Sumner, in conclusion, \"amidst all present trials, it only\r\nremains for us to uphold the constant policy of the Republic, and\r\nstand fast on the ancient ways.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General McClellan was organizing the large forces sent\r\nfor the defense of Washington, and several distinguished foreigners,\r\nwho in turn visited the metropolis, expressed great surprise and\r\nadmiration at the wonderful rapidity with which so many men and so\r\nmuch _materiel_ had been collected, affording striking evidence of\r\nthe martial capabilities of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate engagement at Ball's Bluff, where Colonel Baker\r\nand many brave Union officers and soldiers were killed, while others\r\nwere sent as prisoners to Richmond, had rather a dispiriting effect\r\non the President.  Mr. Lincoln and Colonel Baker had attended the\r\nsame school, joined in the same boyish sports, and when they had\r\ngrown to manhood their intimacy had ripened into ardent friendship.\r\nMr. Lincoln had watched with admiration the success of his friend\r\nBaker at the Illinois bar, as a Whig Representative in Congress,\r\nas an officer in the Mexican War, and then--transplanted to the\r\nPacific coast--as a deliverer of a panegyric over the body of the\r\nmurdered Broderick, that was one of the greatest exhibitions of\r\nfervid eloquence ever seen or heard on this continent.\r\n\r\nComing to Washington as United States Senator from Oregon, Colonel\r\nBaker gave a powerful support to the Union cause and to the Lincoln\r\nAdministration.  He was one of the first Northern politicians to\r\ntake the field, and he was promised by President Lincoln a high\r\nmilitary command if he could, by winning a victory, demonstrate\r\nhis ability as a general.  He entered upon his new military career\r\nwith his characteristic energy, but Mr. Lincoln, instead of promoting\r\nhim, was soon called upon to mourn his untimely death.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  H Hamlin\r\nHANNIBAL HAMLIN was born at Paris, Maine, August 27th, 1809; was\r\na Representative from Maine, 1843-1847; was United States Senator,\r\n1848-1857, when he resigned to act as Governor; was again United\r\nStates Senator, 1857-1861, when he resigned, having been elected\r\nVice-President on the ticket with Abraham Lincoln; was Collector\r\nof the Port of Boston, 1865-1866, when he resigned; was again United\r\nStates Senator, 1869-1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nWASHINGTON A VAST GARRISON.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met on the first Monday in December, 1861, Washington\r\nwas a vast citadel.  A cordon of forts completely encircled it on\r\nthe commanding heights, each one armed, provisioned, and garrisoned.\r\nOn the large plain east of the Capitol and on the south side of\r\nthe Potomac were encamped large bodies of troops.  Regiments were\r\nconstantly on the march through the city.  Long wagon trains laden\r\nwith provisions or ammunition were dragged through the mud of the\r\nthen unpaved streets.  Mounted orderlies galloped to and fro,\r\nbearing returns, requisitions, and despatches.  The old flag was\r\nhoisted in every direction at sunrise, and lowered when the evening\r\ngun was fired, while the music of bands and the shrill notes of\r\ndrums and fifes rang forth the \"music of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing sight was frequently enjoyed when newly formed regiments\r\narrived.  They usually came with the glowing colors of new equipments,\r\nand the vigorous zeal of newly organized drum and fife corps, if\r\nnot, indeed, of a full band.  A richly dressed drum-major generally\r\nmarched at the head of these displays, and his gaudy uniform,\r\nbearskin shako with its plume, glittering baton, with its incessant\r\ntwirling and rhythmical movement, excited the greatest enthusiasm\r\nand admiration among the throngs of observing negroes.  To them\r\nthe _tambour major_ was by far the greatest soldier of the day.\r\n\r\nFor miles in every direction the country was picketed, and martial\r\nlaw was rigidly enforced.  All persons going toward the front must\r\nbe provided with passes, which were very closely scrutinized at\r\nevery picket-post.  In times of special peril those moving northward\r\nunderwent the same ordeal.  War, with all its severities and horrors,\r\nwas continually at the doors of those who dwelt in Washington.\r\n\r\nCongress, for the first time since the seat of Government was\r\nremoved to Washington from Philadelphia, occupied an entirely\r\nsubordinate position, and it might well be said the \"_inter arma\r\nsilent leges_\"--laws are silent in the midst of armies.  It was\r\nnot long, however, before the Senators and Representatives reasserted\r\ntheir authority.  Simon Cameron's report as Secretary of War, as\r\noriginally prepared, printed, and sent over the country for\r\npublication, took advanced ground on the slavery question.  He\r\nadvocated the emancipation of the slaves in the rebel States, the\r\nconversion to the use of the National Government of all property,\r\nwhether slave or otherwise, belonging to the rebels, and the resort\r\nto every military means of suppressing the Rebellion, even the\r\nemployment of armed negroes.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, at the instance of Secretary Seward and General\r\nMcClellan, declined to accept these anti-slavery views from his\r\nsubordinate, and ordered the return of the advance copies distributed\r\nfor revision and amendment.  It happened, however, that several\r\nnewspapers had published the report as originally written.  When\r\nthey republished it, as modified, the public had the benefit of\r\nboth versions.  The President struck out all that Secretary Cameron\r\nhad written on the slavery question, and substituted a single\r\nparagraph which was self-evidently from the Presidential pen.  The\r\nspeculations of the Secretary as to the propriety of arming the\r\nnegroes were canceled, and we were simply told that it would be\r\nimpolitic for the escaped slaves of rebels to be returned again to\r\nbe used against us.  Secretary Chase sustained Secretary Cameron,\r\nbut Secretary Seward, the former champion of higher law and\r\nabolitionism, was so conservative at this crisis of the great\r\nstruggle between freedom and slavery, as to disgruntle many ardent\r\nsupporters of the principles of which he had once assumed to be\r\nthe champion.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled there were many vacant seats at either end\r\nof the Capitol.  In the Senate Chamber ten States of the thirty-\r\nsix were unrepresented, and the Virginia nominally represented was\r\nthat portion of the Old Dominion within the range of Union cannon.\r\nVice-President Hamlin, who presided, was one of the Democrats who\r\nhad gone into the Republican camp.  Of medium height, with a massive\r\nhead, dark complexion, cleanly shaven face, he was ever prompt and\r\ndiligent in the transaction of business.  At all seasons of the\r\nyear he wore a suit of black, with a dress-coat, and could never\r\nbe persuaded to wear an overcoat, even in the coldest weather.  He\r\nwas noted for his fidelity to political friends, and at Washington\r\nhe always had their interests at heart.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt Fessenden, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance,\r\nwas really the leader of the Republican party in the Upper House.\r\nHe was a statesman of great power and comprehensiveness, who\r\npossessed mental energies of the very highest order, and whose\r\nlogic in debate was like a chain, which his hearers often hated to\r\nbe confined with, yet knew not how to break.  To courage and power\r\nin debate he united profound legal knowledge and a very extraordinary\r\naptitude for public business.  Originally an ardent Whig, his whole\r\npolitical life had been spent in earnestly opposing the men and\r\nmeasures of the Democratic party, nor did he possess that adaptability\r\nof opinion so characteristic of modern politicians.  Born and reared\r\nin the days when the \"giants of the Republic\" were living, and to\r\nsome extent, a contemporary actor in the leading events of the\r\ntimes, he had learned to think for himself, and prefer the\r\nindividuality of conscientious conviction to the questionable\r\nsubservience of partisan policy.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner regarded his position as Chairman of the Committee\r\non Foreign Relations as superior to all others in Congress, while\r\nhe was unquestionably the leader of the Abolition wing of the\r\nRepublican party.  Having been abroad himself, he knew the necessity\r\nfor having, especially at that time, the country represented by\r\neducated gentlemen, and Mr. Seward often found it a difficult matter\r\nto persuade him to consent to the appointment of some rural politician\r\nto a place of diplomatic importance.  Objection was made to one\r\nnomination, on the ground that the person was a drunkard, and a\r\nleading Senator came one morning before the Committee to refute\r\nthe charge.  He made quite an argument, closing by saying:  \"No,\r\ngentlemen, he is not a drunkard.  He may, occasionally, as I do\r\nmyself, take a glass of wine, but I assure you, on the honor of a\r\ngentleman, he never gets drunk.\"  Upon this representation the\r\nappointment was favorably reported upon and confirmed by the Senate,\r\nbut it was soon evident that the person was an incorrigible sot,\r\nand when it became absolutely necessary to remove him, it leaked\r\nout that he had retained and paid the Senator for vouching for his\r\ntemperate habits.\r\n\r\nSenator Wilson, who wielded enormous power as Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Military Affairs, had been, before the war, a brigadier-\r\ngeneral of militia in Massachusetts.  He had raised a three-years'\r\nregiment, which he had brought to Washington, but not wishing to\r\ntake the field, he had resigned the command, and had solicited from\r\nGeneral McClellan a position on his staff.  When he reported for\r\nduty he was ordered to appear the next morning mounted, and\r\naccompanied by two other staff officers, in a tour of inspection\r\naround the fortifications.  Unaccustomed to horsemanship, the ride\r\nof thirty miles was too much for the Senator, who kept his bed for\r\na week, and then resigned his staff position.  He performed herculean\r\nlabors on his Committee, and examined personally the recommendations\r\nupon which thousands of appointments had been made.  That at times\r\nhe was prejudiced against those who were opposed to emancipation\r\ncould not be denied, but he honestly endeavored to have the Union\r\narmy well officered, well fed, and promptly paid.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Naval Committee was Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, who\r\nmastered the wants and became acquainted with the welfare of that\r\nbranch of the service, and who urged liberal appropriations for it\r\nin a lucid, comprehensive, and vigorous manner.  An enemy of all\r\nshams, he was a tower of strength for the Administration in the\r\nSenate.  Then there was bluff Ben Wade, of Ohio, whose honestly\r\nwas strongly tinged by ambition, and who looked at the contest with\r\nthe merciless eyes of a gladiator about to close in a death-grip.\r\nJohn Sherman had just been transplanted from the House, Secretary\r\nChase having urged him to remain in the Senate, rather than resign\r\nand take the field, as he had wished to.  Nye, of Nevada, who sat\r\nnext to Mr. Sumner, was a native wit of \"infinite jest\" and most\r\n\"excellent fancy,\" who enlivened the Senate with his _bon mots_\r\nand genial humor.  Trumbull, Harlan, Pomeroy, Lot Morrill, Zach.\r\nChandler, Daniel Clark, Ira Harris, Jacob Collamer, Solomon Foote,\r\nLafayette S. Foster, and David Wilmot were all men of ability.\r\nIndeed, the Republican Senators, as a whole, were men of remarkable\r\nintelligence, while the fourteen or fifteen Democratic Senators,\r\ndeprived of their associates who had seceded, found it difficult\r\nto make a respectable showing of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe House, where there were also many vacant seats, elected Galusha\r\nA. Grow, of Pennsylvania, Speaker.  He was a thorough politician\r\nand a good presiding officer, possessing the tact, the quickness\r\nof perception, and the decision acquired by editorial experience.\r\nThaddeus Stevens was the despotic ruler of the House.  No Republican\r\nwas permitted by \"Old Thad\" to oppose his imperious will without\r\nreceiving a tongue-lashing that terrified others if it did not\r\nbring the refractory Representative back into party harness.  Rising\r\nby degrees, as a telescope is pulled out, until he stood in a most\r\nungraceful attitude, his heavy black hair falling down over his\r\ncavernous brows, and his cold little eyes twinkling with anger, he\r\nwould make some ludicrous remark, and then, reaching to his full\r\nheight, he would lecture the offender against party discipline,\r\nsweeping at him with his large, bony right hand, in uncouth gestures,\r\nas if he would clutch him and shake him.  He would often use\r\ninvectives, which he took care should never appear printed in the\r\nofficial reports, and John Randolph in his braggart prime was never\r\nso imperiously insulting as was Mr. Stevens toward those whose\r\npolitical action he controlled.  He was firm believer in the old\r\nmaxim ascribed to the Jesuits, \"The end justifies the means,\" and,\r\nwhile he set morality at defiance, he was an early and a zealous\r\nchampion of the equality of the black and the white races.\r\n\r\nThere were many able men among the Republican Representatives.\r\nDawes, of Massachusetts, had acquired a deserved reputation for\r\nhonesty, sincerity, and untiring industry.  Elihu B. Washburne was\r\nan experienced politician and a practical legislator.  Sam Hooper\r\nwas a noble specimen of the Boston merchant, who had always preserved\r\nhis reputation for exact dealings, and whose liberal charities\r\neclipsed his generous hospitalities.  Roscoe Conkling, who had just\r\nentered upon the theatre of his future fame, commanded attention\r\nby his superb choice of words in debate and by his wonderful felicity\r\nof expression and epigrammatic style.  Alexander H. Rice reflected\r\nhonor upon his Boston constituents.  John B. Alley was a true\r\nrepresentative of the industrial interests and anti-slavery sentiments\r\nof old Essex.  William D. Kelley was on the threshold of a long\r\ncareer of parliamentary usefulness, and Edward McPherson, a man of\r\nfacts and figures, blindly devoted to his party, was ever ready to\r\nspring some ingenious parliamentary trap for the discomfiture of\r\nits opponents.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic opposition was not strong.  Among Kentucky's\r\nRepresentatives were the veteran John J. Crittenden, who had so\r\nlong been kept under the shadow of the representation of Henry\r\nClay, and Charles A. Wickliffe, portly in figure and florid in\r\nfeatures, who clung to the ruffled-bosom shirt of his boyhood.\r\nDaniel Voorhees, the \"Tall Sycamore of the Wabash,\" would occasionally\r\nlaunch out in a bold strain of defiance and invective against the\r\nmeasures for the restoration of the Union, in which he would be\r\nseconded by Clement L. Vallandingham, of Ohio, and by the facetious\r\nS. S. Cox, who then represented an Ohio district.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War was a\r\nmischievous organization, which assumed dictatorial powers.\r\nSummoning generals before them, and having a phonographer to record\r\nevery word uttered, they would propound very comprehensive questions.\r\nThe first question put by them was generally about identical with\r\nthat which the militia captain, who fell into the cellar-way after\r\nan arduous attempt to drill his company, asked a benevolent Quaker\r\nlady who rushed forward to express her sympathy, as he struggled\r\nto extricate himself:  \"What do you know about war?\"  If the general\r\nin hand was a political brigadier or major-general, who had been\r\nin the habit before the war of saving his country on the stump, he\r\nwould proceed to discuss the origin and cure of the Rebellion,\r\ngreatly to the satisfaction of the Committee, and they would\r\nascertain at once that so far as his principles were concerned,\r\nthe ought to have commanded the Army of the Potomac.  If the general\r\ncalled and questioned happened to be one of the numerous class who\r\nhad formed the acquaintance of the green-eyed monster, he entertained\r\nthe Committee with shocking stories of his superior officers.  He\r\nscolded and carped and criticised and caviled, told half truths\r\nand solid lies, and the august and astute Committee listened with\r\nopen ears, and the phonographer dotted down every word.  So the\r\nmeanest gossip and slang of the camp was raked into a heap and\r\npreserved in official form.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  BenjWade\r\nBENJAMIN F. WADE was born at Feeding Hills Parish, near Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, October 17th, 1800; removed to Ohio; was United\r\nStates Senator, 1851-1869, and died at Jefferson, Ohio, March 2d,\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE METROPOLIS IN TIME OF WAR.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had a bright, spring-like day for his first New\r\nYear's reception, and the dignitaries who in turn paid their respects\r\nfound such a crowd around the door of the White House that they\r\nexperienced some little inconvenience in reaching the interior.\r\nLord Lyons, of England, and M. Mercier, of France, were prominent\r\namong the diplomats, and General McDowell headed the army officers,\r\nGeneral McClellan being ill.  At noon the public were admitted,\r\norder being maintained by the police, who appeared for the first\r\ntime in uniform.  Passing on to the reception-room, the people met\r\nand shook hands with the President, near whom stood Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nwho was attended by the United States Marshal of the District,\r\nColonel Lamon, Captain Darling, chief of the Capitol police, and\r\nthe President's secretaries.  The visitors thence passed to the\r\ngreat East Room, where it was apparent they were unusually numerous,\r\nmore strangers being present in Washington at the time, perhaps,\r\nthan ever before.  The crowd, indeed, as looked upon by old residents,\r\nappeared to present new faces almost entirely.  The general scene\r\nwas brilliant and animating, and the whole was enlivened, as usual,\r\nby strains of the Marine Band, which was stationed in the vestibule.\r\nBy two o'clock the promenaders generally had departed by means of\r\na platform for egress, constructed through one of the large windows\r\nat the front of the mansion.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists were greatly disappointed because there had not\r\nbeen any insurrectionary movements among the slaves at the South,\r\nwhich had been looked for at the Christmas holidays, and they then\r\nincreased their exertions to make Mr. Lincoln issue a proclamation\r\nabolishing slavery.  At the twenty-ninth annual meeting of the\r\nMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, held at Boston, in January,\r\n1862, Wendell Phillips, with a sneer, expressed himself thus:  \"Mr.\r\nSeward had predicted that the war would be over in ninety days,\r\nbut he didn't believe, as things were going, it would be over in\r\nninety years.  He believed Lincoln was honest, but as a pint-pot\r\nmay be full, and yet not be so full as a quart, so there is a vast\r\ndifference between the honesty of a small man and the honesty of\r\na statesman.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an imposing parade through the streets of a new arm of\r\nthe military service, a battalion or regiment of mounted lancers.\r\nThe men carried lances about twelve feet long, held upright as they\r\nrode, and having black staffs and bright spear heads, something\r\nlike the sword bayonet, though only about half as long.  This corps\r\nwas under the command of Colonel Rush, of Pennsylvania.  Each\r\nhorseman bore a small red flag on the top of his lance, and the\r\nnovelty of the display attracted much attention, though the\r\nspectators, not greatly impressed with the effectiveness of the\r\nweapon with which the corps was armed, gave them the sobriquet\r\n\"Turkey Drivers,\" which stuck to them ever afterward.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln had a pet scheme during the war for establishing\r\na colony of contrabands at the Chiriqui Lagoon, with a new transit\r\nroute across the Isthmus to the harbor of Golfito, on the Pacific.\r\nThe first company of emigrants, composed of freeborn negroes and\r\nliberated slaves, was organized, under President Lincoln's personal\r\nsupervision, by Senator Pomeroy, of Kansas, and would have started,\r\nbut the diplomatic representative of Costa Rica protested.  Negro\r\nsettlers, he said, would be welcomed in the province of Chiriqui,\r\nbut such a colony as it was proposed to establish would necessarily\r\nbe under the protection of the United States, and grave difficulties\r\nmight ensue.  Besides, such a colony would almost invite an attack\r\nfrom the Confederates, then quite powerful, who would seek their\r\nslaves, and who would regard a negro colony with especial aversion.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln regretted this fiasco, as negro colonization was his\r\nfavorite panacea for the national troubles.  He again and again\r\ndeclared that the continuance of the African race in the United\r\nStates could but be injurious to both blacks and whites, and that\r\nthe expatriation and colonization of the negro was a political\r\nnecessity.  Those who had zealously opposed slavery and who had\r\nregarded the war as securing the freedom of the negroes, combated\r\nthe President's scheme. They insisted that the blacks had a right\r\nto remain in the land of their birth, and declared that expatriation,\r\nas a measure of political economy, would be fatal to the prosperity\r\nof the country, for it would drive away a large amount of productive\r\nlabor.  A colony was subsequently taken to one of the West India\r\nIslands, but it was a miserable failure, and the colonists, after\r\ngreat suffering, were brought back.\r\n\r\nThe scandals concerning army contracts enabled the Abolitionists\r\nto secure the transfer of Simon Cameron from the War Department to\r\nthe Russian Mission, and the appointment of Edwin M. Stanton in\r\nhis place.  It should not be forgotten that Mr. Cameron is entitled\r\nto great credit for the energy and skill with which he managed the\r\nWar Office from March, 1861, until February, 1862.  He laid the\r\nfoundation of that military organization which eventually, under\r\nthe leadership of Grant and Sherman, crushed the Rebellion and\r\nrestored the Union.  One of the regiments which came to Washington\r\nfrom New York, the Seventy-ninth Highlanders, becoming wretchedly\r\ndisorganized, he detailed his brother, Colonel James Cameron, to\r\ncommand it.  This settled all differences, the Scotchmen remembering\r\nthe proverb that \"The Camerons of Lochiel never proved false to a\r\nfriend or a foe.\"  In a few weeks, however, Colonel Cameron was\r\nkilled at the Battle of Bull Run while bravely leading his men\r\nagainst the enemy.  The weight of this great calamity fell upon\r\nSecretary Cameron at a time when the utmost powers of his mind were\r\nbeing exerted to save Washington from capture.  For a brief period\r\nit crushed him, but the dangers then surrounding the national cause\r\nwere too numerous and too threatening to admit of anything but\r\nredoubled exertions to avert them.  Summoning, therefore, all his\r\nfortitude and energy, he for the moment suppressed his intense\r\ngrief and recommenced his labors.  New armies were organized as if\r\nby magic, and Washington was saved.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton's strong will was relied upon by the Abolitionists for\r\nthe control of General McClellan, who had given some indications\r\nof his willingness to restore the Union \"as it was,\" with slavery\r\nlegalized and protected.  While \"Little Mac\" had become the idol\r\nof the rank and file of the Army of the Potomac, which he had\r\nthoroughly organized and equipped, he had also provoked the opposition\r\nof those in his rear from whom he should have received encouragement\r\nand support.  Naturally cautious, he hesitated about moving when\r\nhe knew that if successful he would immediately be crippled by the\r\nwithdrawal of a portion of his command.  A prominent politician,\r\nmore outspoken than some of them around him, is quoted by General\r\nCuster as having said:  \"It is not on our books that McClellan\r\nshould take Richmond.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton had witnessed so much treason while he was a member of\r\nBuchanan's Cabinet, that he determined to know exactly what was\r\ndone by every officer of the army, and one of his first acts was\r\nto have news sent over the wires pass through the War Department.\r\nEvery wire in the country was \"tapped\" and its contents made a\r\nmatter of record.  Every telegram sent by President Lincoln or the\r\nmembers of his Cabinet to the generals in the field, or received\r\nby them from those generals, was put on record at Washington, as\r\nwere all cipher despatches, deciphered by General Eckert.  On one\r\noccasion a despatch from General Rufus Ingalls to Senator Nesmith\r\npuzzled every one at the War Department except Quartermaster-General\r\nMeigs, who was positive that it was Bohemian.  Finally an officer\r\nwho had served on the Pacific coast recognized it as \"Chinook,\" a\r\ncompound of the English, Chinese, and Indian languages used by the\r\nwhites in trading with the Chinook Indians.  The despatch was a\r\nharmless request from General Ingalls to his old friend \"Nes.\" to\r\ncome and witness an impeding engagement.\r\n\r\nA detective system of espionage had been organized by Mr. Seward\r\nfor the protection of the United States Government against the\r\nadherents of the Confederate cause.  The reports made by this corps\r\nof detectives to the Department of State showed the daring acts of\r\nthe Southern sympathizers, several of whom were ladies of wealth\r\nand fashion.  How they watched and waited at official doors till\r\nthey had bagged the important secret of state they wanted; how they\r\nstole military maps from the War Department; how they took copies\r\nof official documents; how they smuggled the news of the Government's\r\nstrength in the linings of honest-looking coats; and how they hid\r\narmy secrets in the meshes of unsuspected crinoline--all these\r\nbecame familiar facts, almost ceasing to excite remark or surprise.\r\nThe head of this branch of the service was General Lafayette S.\r\nBaker.\r\n\r\nOf this band of active and useful plotters, who were constantly\r\nengaged playing into the hands of the Confederates under the very\r\nshadow of the Capitol, some of the women of Washington were the\r\nbusiest.  The intriguing nature of these dames appears to have\r\nfound especial delight in forwarding the schemes of the leaders in\r\nthe movement to overthrow the Washington Government.  It mattered\r\nnot that most of them owed all they possessed of fortune and position\r\nto that Federal Government, and to the patronage which, directly\r\nor indirectly, they had received from it.  This very fact lent a\r\nspice of daring to the deed, while an irresistible attraction was\r\nfurnished in the fact that they were plotting the ruin of a Government\r\nwhich had fallen into the hands of that Northern majority whom,\r\nwith all the lofty scorn of \"patrician\" blood, they despised and\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose O. H. Greenhow was the most adroit of the Confederate\r\nemissaries.  The sister of Mrs. Cutts, mother of Mrs. Douglas, and\r\nthe widow of a clerk in the State Department, who had written a\r\nvaluable work on Oregon, her social position gave her remarkable\r\nfacilities for obtaining information.  Just before the battle of\r\nBull Run she contrived to convey to the enemy news obtained from\r\na New England Senator with regard to the intended movements of the\r\nFederals.  This communication, in her own opinion, decided the\r\nbattle.  In return she received this despatch from the Confederate\r\nAdjutant-General:  \"Our President and our General direct me to\r\nthank you.  We rely upon you for further information.  The Confederacy\r\nowes you a debt.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenhow's house was finally used as a prison for female spies.\r\nThe windows looking on the street were boarded up, and a special\r\nmilitary guard occupied tents pitched in the garden.  Mrs. Greenhow\r\nand her pretty daughter Rose were the presiding deities.  Then there\r\nwas Mrs. Phillips, daughter of J. C. Levy, of Charleston, S. C.,\r\nwhere she married Philip Phillips, who afterward removed to Mobile\r\nand was elected thence to the Thirty-third Congress.  Declining a\r\nre-election, he remained at Washington City, where he had a lucrative\r\npractice before the Supreme Court.  Mrs. Phillips, although the\r\nmother of nine children, found time to obtain and transmit information\r\nto General Beauregard, and after having been closely guarded for\r\nawhile, she was permitted to go South on her parole and that of\r\nher father, that she would not give \"aid or comfort to the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Baxley, Mrs. Hasler, Miss Lilly A. Mackel, Mrs. Levy, and\r\nother lady prisoners had all been more or less prominent in Southern\r\nsociety at Washington, and had made trips over the underground\r\nrailroad between Alexandria and Richmond.  Also an English lady,\r\nMrs. Ellena Low, who had been arrested at Boston, with her son,\r\nwho had crossed the ocean bearing a commission in the Confederate\r\narmy.  Miss E. M. Poole, alias Stewart, had been very successful\r\nin carrying contraband information and funds between the two camps,\r\nand when arrested the last time there were found concealed on her\r\nperson seven thousand five hundred dollars of unexpended funds.\r\n\r\nAnother devoted friend of the Confederates, who resided just outside\r\nof the Union lines in Virginia, managed to fascinate General\r\nStoughton, a young West Point cavalry officer, and one evening\r\nwhile he was enjoying her society, during a serenade by a regimental\r\nband, he, with his band and orderlies, was surprised and captured,\r\nand they were sent as prisoners-of-war to Richmond.  \"I do not mind\r\nlosing the brigadier,\" said Mr. Lincoln, in talking about the\r\ncapture, \"for they are easily made, but there were some twenty\r\nhorses taken, and they cost one hundred and twenty-five dollars\r\napiece.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  SimonCameron\r\nSIMON CAMERON was born at Waynesborough, Pennsylvania, March 3d,\r\n1799; learned the art of printing; was Secretary of War under\r\nPresident Lincoln, in 1861, resigning when appointed Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary to Russia, in 1862; was United States Senator from\r\nPennsylvania, 1845-1849, 1857-1861, and 1867-1877, when he resigned,\r\nand was succeeded by his son.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nFASHION, LITERATURE, AND ART.\r\n\r\nWashington \"society\" refused to be comforted.  Those within its\r\ncharmed circle would not visit the White House, or have any\r\nintercourse with the members of the Administration.  This gave\r\ngreat annoyance to Mr. Seward, who used diplomatic and consular\r\nappointments, commissions, and contracts unsparingly for the purchase\r\nof a friendly feeling.  At his urgent solicitation the President\r\nconsented to an evening reception at the White House, by invitation.\r\n\"I don't fancy this pass business,\" said the President, good-\r\nnaturedly, but the metropolitan practicians could not refrain from\r\napplying for them.  The evening of February 5th, 1862, found the\r\ncourt-yard of the White House filled with carriages and ambulances\r\nbringing \"fair women and brave men.\"\r\n\r\nThe President and Mrs. Lincoln received their guests in the East\r\nRoom, where he towered above all around him, and had a pleasant\r\nword for those he knew.  Mrs. Lincoln was dressed in a white satin\r\ndress with a low neck and short sleeves.  It was trimmed with black\r\nlace flounces, which were looped up with knots of ribbon, and she\r\nwore a floral head-dress, which was not very becoming.  Near her\r\nwas her eldest son, Mr. Robert Lincoln (known as the Prince of\r\nRails), and Mr. John Hay, the President's intellectual private\r\nsecretary.  In addition to the East Room, the Red, Green, and Blue\r\nParlors (so named from the color of their paper-hangings and the\r\nfurniture) were open, and were ornamented with a profusion of rare\r\nexotics, while the Marine Band, stationed in the corridor, discoursed\r\nfine music.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward was in his element, escorting, as in duty bound, the\r\nladies of the Diplomatic Corps.  Mr. Chase, the dignified and\r\nstatesman-like Secretary of the Treasury, seemed to have forgotten\r\nfor the moment that his coffers were \"short.\"  Mr. Stanton, vigorous\r\nand thoughtful, was the object of much attention, and the patriarchal\r\nlocks and beard of the not over-scintillant Secretary of the Navy\r\nwere, of course, a feature.  The other members of the Cabinet were\r\npresent, as were Justices Clifford, Wayne, and Grier, of the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner, as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations,\r\nwas the centre of a diplomatic circle, where all of the \"great\r\npowers,\" and some of the smaller ones, were represented.  Ladies\r\nfrom the rural districts were disappointed in not seeing the gorgeous\r\ncourt costumes, having forgotten that our court-dress is the\r\nundertaker-like suit of black broadcloth so generally worn.  But\r\nthey gazed with admiration upon the broad ribbons and jeweled badges\r\nworn on the breasts of the Chevaliers of the Legion of Honor,\r\nKnights of the Bath, etc., \"with distinguished consideration.\"\r\nVice-President Hamlin might have called the Senate to order and\r\nhad more than a quorum of members present, who, like himself, had\r\ntheir wives here to cheer their labors.  Mr. Speaker Grow could\r\nnot see around him so large a proportion of the \"Lower House,\" but\r\nthere was--so a Kentucky lady said--\"a right smart chance of\r\nRepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, in full uniform, looked finely.  Among his staff\r\nofficers were the French Princes, each wearing a captain's uniform.\r\nThe Comte de Paris was tall and very handsome, while the Duc du\r\nChartres was taller, thinner, less handsome than his brother.  Both\r\nwere remarkably cordial and affable, and, as they spoke English\r\nperfectly, they enjoyed the gay scene.  General Fremont, in a plain\r\nundress suit, seemed rather downcast, although his devoted wife,\r\n\"Jessie,\" more than made up for his moodiness by her animated and\r\nvivacious conversation.  There were, besides Generals McDowell,\r\nStone, Heintzelman, Blenker, Hancock, Hooker, Keyes, Doubleday,\r\nCasey, Shields, and Marcy, with Captain Dahlgren and the Prince\r\nSalm-Salm.  Of those present many fought, and some fell, on the\r\nvarious fields of the next three dreadful years.  There were others\r\nwho were destined to do their duty and yet be mistaken and defrauded\r\nof their just inheritance of glory.  Such was the fortune of war.\r\n\r\nAn incident of the evening was the presentation of General Fremont\r\nto General McClellan by President Lincoln.  General Fremont was in\r\nthe hall, evidently about to leave, as Mrs. Fremont had her shawl\r\non, and Senator Sumner was escorting her toward the door, when the\r\nPresident went after them, and soon turned toward the East Room,\r\nwith the Pathfinder at his side, Senator Sumner and Mrs. Fremont\r\nfollowing.  The presentation was made, and a few remarks were\r\nexchanged by the Generals, two men who were destined to exert a\r\nmarked influence on the future destiny of the nation.\r\n\r\nA magnificent supper had been provided in the state dining-room by\r\nMaillard, of New York, but when the hour of eleven came, and the\r\ndoor should have been opened, the flustered steward had lost the\r\nkey, so that there was a hungry crowd waiting anxiously outside\r\nthe unyielding portal.  Then the irrepressible humor of the American\r\npeople broke forth--that grim humor which carried them through the\r\nsubsequent misery.  \"I am in favor of a forward movement!\" one\r\nwould exclaim.  \"An advance to the front is only retarded by the\r\nimbecility of commanders,\" said another, quoting a speech just made\r\nin Congress.  To all this General McClellan, himself modestly\r\nstruggling with the crowd, laughed as heartily as anybody.  Finally\r\nthe key was found, the door opened, and the crowd fed.\r\n\r\nThe table was decorated with large pieces of ornamental confectionery,\r\nthe centre object representing the steamer \"Union,\" armed and\r\nbearing the \"Stars and Stripes.\"  On a side table was a model of\r\nFort Sumter, also in sugar, and provisioned with game.  After supper\r\npromenading was resumed, and it was three o'clock ere the guests\r\ndeparted.  The entertainment was pronounced a decided success, but\r\nit was compared to the ball given by the Duchess of Richmond, at\r\nBrussels, the night before Waterloo.  People parted there never to\r\nmeet again.  Many a poor fellow took his leave that night of\r\nfestivity forever, the band playing, as he left, \"The Girl I Left\r\nBehind Me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists throughout the country were merciless in their\r\ncriticisms of the President and Mrs. Lincoln for giving this\r\nreception when the soldiers of the Union were in cheerless bivouacs\r\nor comfortless hospitals, and a Philadelphia poet wrote a scandalous\r\node on the occasion, entitled \"The Queen Must Dance.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no dancing, nor was it generally known that after the\r\ninvitations had been issued Mrs. Lincoln's children sickened, and\r\nshe had been up the two nights previous to the reception watching\r\nwith them.  Both the President and Mrs. Lincoln left the gay throng\r\nseveral times to go up and see their darling Willie, who passed\r\naway a fortnight afterward.  He was a fine-looking lad, eleven\r\nyears of age, whose intelligence and vivacity made him a general\r\nfavorite.  Some of his exercises in literary composition had been\r\nso creditable that his father had permitted their publication.\r\nThis bereavement made Mr. Lincoln and his wife very indulgent toward\r\ntheir youngest son, who thenceforth imperiously ruled at the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWashington City profited by its encircling garrison of one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand men, and its population of civilians increased\r\nwonderfully.  Previously the crowds of people who had flooded\r\nWashington at inauguration ceremonies, or during the sessions of\r\nCongress, had been of the quick-come, quick-go character almost\r\nexclusively.  They had added nothing to the general business of\r\nthe city, stopping altogether at hotels, and making no investments\r\nin the way of purchases.  Even Congressmen had latterly very seldom\r\nbrought their families to the Federal capital.  But the representatives\r\nof the military power formed another class of citizens entirely.\r\nUnlike the representatives of the legislative power, who had treated\r\ntheir quarters in Washington as mere \"tents of a night,\" the army\r\nhad taken all the vacant houses in Washington.  The fears of a\r\nbombardment by the rebels on the Potomac had the effect of keeping\r\nup prices of provisions and everything else.  The residents of\r\nWashington experienced the evils of living in a non-manufacturing\r\nand non-producing country.  The single-track railway to Baltimore\r\nwas over-loaded by the army, and the freight depot in the city was\r\ncrammed and piled with stuff of every description that it presented\r\nthe appearance of about five hundred Noah's arks suddenly tumbled\r\ninto a conglomerated heap.\r\n\r\nWith the army and its camp-followers, there came a number of\r\n_literati_ to accept clerical positions in the Departments.  At\r\nthe Treasury one could see the veteran Dr. Pierpont, George Wood,\r\nO'Connor, Piatt, Chilton, and Dr. Elder, all hopefully engaged in\r\nsigning, cutting, or recording Government notes and bonds.  Entering\r\nthe library of the State Department, one saw J. C. Derby, so long\r\nin the front rank of New York publishers, then Mr. Seward's librarian.\r\nOn Pennsylvania Avenue was Fred Cozzens' store, to which Mr.\r\nSparrowgrass had transported his Catawbas and Cabanas.  At the\r\nWhite House one would perhaps meet N. P. Willis in the reception-\r\nroom, and in Mr. Nicolay's up-stairs sanctum was John Hay, whose\r\n_Atlantic_ papers were written with such purity of style and feeling\r\nat his desk as under-secretary to the President.  Then, among women\r\nwriters, there were Mesdames Don Piatt, Squier, Olmstead, and\r\nKirkland.   The Vermont sculptor, Larkin Meade, had his \"Green\r\nMountain Boy\" on exhibition at a popular bookstore on the Avenue.\r\n\r\nWith this importation of Northern brains came a desire to hear\r\nlectures from prominent men, and Professor Henry was reluctantly\r\ninduced to grant the use of the lecture hall of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, with a promise that it should be announced that the\r\nInstitution was not to be held responsible for what might be said.\r\nWhen the first lecture was given, the Rev. John Pierpont, after\r\nintroducing the lecturer, added:  \"I am requested by Professor\r\nHenry, to announce that the Smithsonian Institution is not responsible\r\nfor this course of lectures.  I do so with pleasure, and desire to\r\nadd that the Washington Lecture Association is not responsible for\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution.\"  The satire was appreciated and\r\nreceived with applause.  Throughout the course Mr. Pierpont repeated\r\nhis announcement before each weekly lecture, and no sooner would\r\nhe say, \"I am requested,\" then the large audience would applaud.\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton, of Philadelphia, was placed at the head of the\r\nAgricultural Bureau of the Patent Office, by President Lincoln,\r\nand in due time he became the head of the newly created Department\r\nof Agriculture.  He was an ignorant, credulous old gentleman, quite\r\nrotund around the waistband, with snow-white hair and a mild blue\r\neye.  Educated a Quaker, he had accumulated some property by keeping\r\nan ice-cream saloon in Philadelphia, and he then established a\r\nfarm, from which he obtained his supplies of cream.  At Washington\r\nhe was known as \"Sir Isaac,\" and many anecdotes were told at his\r\nexpense.  One year, when the expenditures of his department had\r\nbeen very great, and the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture\r\ncalled on him to ascertain how he had used up so much money, Sir\r\nIsaac spluttered and talked learnedly, and at last concluded by\r\nsaying:  \"Yes, sir; the expenses have been very great, exorbitant;\r\nindeed, sir, they have exceeded my most sanguine expectations.\"\r\nThe Chairman was not satisfied.  Looking over Sir Isaac's estimate\r\nfor the year, it was found he had made requisition for five thousand\r\ndollars to purchase two hydraulic rams.  \"Them, gentlemen,\" said\r\nSir Isaac, \"are said to be the best sheep in Europe.  I have seen\r\na gentleman who knows all about them, and we should by all means\r\nsecure the breed.\"  Some wag had been selling Sir Isaac, and, much\r\nto his disgust, the Committee struck out the five-thousand-dollar\r\nitem.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  S.P.Chase\r\nSALMON PORTLAND CHASE was born at Cornish, New Hampshire, January\r\n13th, 1808; graduated at Dartmouth College in 1826; studied law at\r\nWashington with William Wirt, supporting himself by teaching school;\r\ncommenced practice at Cincinnati in 1830; was United States Senator\r\nfrom Ohio, 1849-1853; was Governor of Ohio, 1855-1859; was again\r\nUnited States Senator, March 4th, 1861, and resigned the next day\r\nto become Secretary of the Treasury under President Lincoln, which\r\nposition he held until he resigned in September, 1864; was appointed\r\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court, December 6th, 1864; presided\r\nat the impeachment trial of President Johnson in 1866, and died at\r\nNew York, May 7th, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE FORTUNES OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWith the war came the army correspondents.  Dickens had previously\r\nintroduced Martin Chuzzlewit to \"our war correspondent, sir, Mr.\r\nJefferson Brick,\" several years previously, but the warlike\r\nexperiences of the redoubtable Mr. Brick were of a purely sedentary\r\ncharacter, and his epistles were written at the home office.  But\r\nWashington was now invaded by a corps of quick-witted, plucky young\r\nfellows, able to endure fatigue, brave enough to be under fire,\r\nand sufficiently well educated to enable them to dash off a\r\ngrammatical and picturesque description of a skirmish.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, one of them, by eulogizing a general in command, was\r\nenabled to go to the front as a gentleman, but generally they were\r\nproscribed and hunted out from camps like spies.  Secretary Stanton\r\nbullied them, established a censorship at Washington, and occasionally\r\nimprisoned one, or stopped the publication of the paper with which\r\nhe corresponded.  Halleck denounced them as \"unauthorized hangers-\r\non,\" who should be compelled to work on the entrenchments if they\r\ndid not leave his lines.  General Meade was unnecessarily severe\r\nin his treatment of correspondents whose letters were not agreeable\r\nto him, although they contained \"the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth.\"  The result was that the correspondents\r\nwere forced to hover around the rear of the armies, gathering up\r\nsuch information as they could, and then ride in haste to the\r\nnearest available telegraph station to send off their news.  There\r\nwere honorable and talented exceptions, but the majority of those\r\nwho called themselves \"war correspondents\" were mere news-\r\nscavengers.\r\n\r\nThe Washington press was despotically governed during the war.\r\nThe established censorship was under the direction of men wholly\r\nunqualified, and on several occasions the printed editions of\r\ninfluential journals--Republican or Democratic--were seized by\r\nSecretary Stanton for having published intelligence which he thought\r\nshould have been suppressed.  Bulletins were issued by the War\r\nDepartment, but they were often incorrect.  It was known that the\r\nWashington papers, full of military information, were forwarded\r\nthrough the lines daily, yet the censors would not permit paragraphs\r\nclipped from those papers to be telegraphed to Boston or Chicago,\r\nwhere they could not appear sooner than they did in the Richmond\r\npapers.  The declaration, \"I am a newspaper correspondent,\" which\r\nhad in former years carried with it the imposing force of the\r\nfamous, \"I am a Roman citizen,\" no longer entitled one to the same\r\nproud prerogatives, and journalists were regarded as spies and\r\nsneaks.\r\n\r\nColonel John W. Forney, Secretary of the United States Senate and\r\neditor of the Philadelphia _Press_, established the _Sunday Chronicle_\r\nat Washington, and in time made it the _Daily Chronicle_.  When in\r\nWashington, he was constantly dictating letters for the _Press_\r\nand editorials for the _Chronicle_.  When in Philadelphia, he\r\ndictated editorials for the _Press_ and letters for the _Chronicle_.\r\nEach paper copied his letters from the other.  When in New York,\r\nhe dictated editorial letters to his papers alternately, and they\r\nwere signed \"J. W. F.\"  His Washington letters to the _Press_ and\r\nhis Philadelphia letters to the _Chronicle_ were signed, \"Occasional,\"\r\nthough the most remarkable thing about them was their regularity.\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Chronicle_ received editorial and other contributions\r\nfrom some of the ablest writers in the country.  Editorials on\r\nforeign topics were supplied by Dr. R. Shelton Mackenzie, of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_.  Robert J. Walker wrote a series of powerful\r\narticles on the desirableness of Secretary Seward's pet project,\r\nthe acquisition of Alaska, and Caleb Cushing was a frequent editorial\r\ncontributor.  It had a large circulation, the Army of the Potomac\r\ntaking ten thousand copies a day, and the lucrative advertising of\r\nthe Department was given to it.\r\n\r\nIndependence Day, 1862, was not joyously celebrated at Washington.\r\nThe martial pageant with which the day had been glorified in years\r\npast had been replaced by the stern realities of war, and the\r\nhospitals were crowded with the sick, the wounded, and the dying.\r\nThe week previous General McClellan, after a campaign of great\r\nseverity in the Peninsula, and having been in sight of Richmond,\r\nhad been so crippled by the failure of Secretary Stanton to send\r\nhim more troops that he had been forced to retreat from Chickahominy,\r\nand seek the shelter of the gunboats on the River James.  The\r\nPresident, at the request of the Governors of the loyal States,\r\npromptly called into the service an additional force of three\r\nhundred thousand men.  Those who had advocated the arming of the\r\nnegroes availed themselves of the occasion to urge their enlistment;\r\nbut the Secretary of War, in conversation with conservatives,\r\nopposed it.  Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky, stated on the floor of the\r\nHouse (and his statement was never contradicted) that, having\r\nbusiness at the War Department, Mr. Stanton called him back, and,\r\nfolding over the date and signature of a letter, showed him that\r\nan officer had asked authority to raise a regiment of blacks.  The\r\nSecretary inquired what answer ought to be given, to which he\r\n(Mallory) replied, \"If you allow me to dictate an answer, I would\r\nsay, emphatically, No!\"  The Secretary rejoined that he had not\r\nonly done that, but had ordered the officer's arrest.\r\n\r\nThe people responded gloriously to the demand for more troops, and\r\nby the middle of August, 1862, they were pouring into Washington\r\nat the rate of a brigade a day.  The regiments, on their arrival,\r\nwere marched past the White House, singing, \"We are coming, Father\r\nAbraham, three hundred thousand more.\"  And \"Father Abraham\" often\r\nkindled their highest enthusiasm by coming to the front entrance\r\nand in person reviewing the passing hosts.  The troops then crossed\r\nthe Potomac, where the hills were whitened with the tents of camps\r\nof instruction, where an army of reserves was soon produced.  Mr.\r\nGreeley, however, was not satisfied with the military preparations,\r\nand he published an insolent letter to President Lincoln, in which\r\nhe charged him with being \"disastrously remiss in enforcing the\r\nlaws.\"  Mr. Lincoln replied, calmly but positively:  \"I would save\r\nthe Union.  I would save it in the shortest way, under the\r\nConstitution.  If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves\r\nI would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I\r\nwould do it, and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving\r\nothers alone I would also do that.  What I do about slavery and\r\nthe colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union,\r\nand what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would\r\nhelp to save the Union.  I shall do less whenever I shall believe\r\nthat what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever\r\nI believe doing more will help the cause.  I shall try to correct\r\nerrors when shown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast\r\nas they shall appear to be true views.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln finally found that he could not sustain General\r\nMcClellan any longer, and offered General Burnside the command of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, which was promptly and peremptorily\r\ndeclined.  General McClellan was soon virtually deposed, and General\r\nHalleck placed in command, while a large portion of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac was organized as the Army of Virginia, and placed under\r\nthe command of Major-General John Pope, who boasted that he was\r\nfresh from a campaign in the West, where he had \"seen only the\r\nbacks of rebels.\"  The result was that the new commander was not\r\ncordially supported, and the Army of Virginia was wrecked beyond\r\ncompare, and driven back upon Washington, which was threatened by\r\nthe victorious Confederates.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside was, for the second time, invited to take command,\r\nbut he refused, urging President Lincoln to restore General McClellan.\r\nThis was undoubtedly the wish of a large majority of the surviving\r\nofficers and soldiers, and of many leading members of Congress and\r\njournalists.  The recall of General McClellan to command, and his\r\nvictory at Antietam, were like a romance.  Sitting one day in his\r\ntent near Alexandria, with only his body-guard of a hundred men\r\nunder his command, he was called to save the capital from the vast\r\nhosts of enemies that were pouring on it in resistless columns.\r\nTo save his native State from the invasion that threatened it, and\r\nMaryland from the grasp of a soldiery that would wrest it from the\r\nUnion, he was offered an army shattered by disaster, and legions\r\nof new recruits who had never handled a musket or heard the sound\r\nof a hostile cannon.  The responsibility was greater than had ever\r\nbeen reposed on the shoulders of one man since the days of Washington.\r\nWith a rapidity never equaled in history, he gathered together the\r\narmy, arranged its forces, made up his corps, chose his generals,\r\nand sent them in vigorous pursuit, through Washington and on\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had crossed into Maryland, and were having a triumphant\r\nmarch through that State toward the Pennsylvania line.  They issued\r\na sounding proclamation to the people, offering them what they\r\ncalled liberty from oppression, and they acted out the theory of\r\ntheir mad invasion, which was that they were victors and had come\r\nto reap, on loyal grounds, the fruit of their victories.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the gallant men of the Union Army were on them.  They\r\nwere swept over the South Mountains with the besom of destruction.\r\nOn Monday, astonished to meet McClellan, when they had expected to\r\nmeet those whom they less feared, they called their hosts over the\r\nPotomac and prepared for battle.  McClellan had previously arranged\r\nhis strategic plans, and these undoubtedly would have resulted\r\ndifferently but for the inexplicable surrender of Harper's Ferry,\r\nleaving our army with little hope of cutting off the retreat of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday McClellan engaged them in a long and\r\nfurious contest, the night of Wednesday closing in on them defeated,\r\ndispirited, and broken; and when Thursday morning showed the\r\ndisposition of our army, and the inevitable defeat that awaited\r\nthem, they left the field, abandoned their wounded, and fled into\r\nVirginia, pursued and routed by the army of the Union.  Having\r\ngloriously performed this great work, General McClellan's stubborn\r\ninaction returned, and President Lincoln determined to place General\r\nBurnside in command of the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside reluctantly accepted the command when it was for\r\nthe third time tendered him, and lost no time in putting its\r\ndivisions in motion for a rapid advance upon Fredericksburg.  Had\r\nhe found the pontoon train there, as he had expected, he could have\r\nthrown a heavy force across the Rappahannock before the enemy could\r\nhave concentrated to resist his crossing, and he then could have\r\ncommenced an active, vigorous campaign against Richmond.  But before\r\nthe pontoons had arrived the Confederates had strengthened their\r\nforces, and the result was two unsuccessful attacks, with a large\r\nloss of men.  The country howled with wrath against the Washington\r\nofficials, who had delayed sending the pontoons, but General Burnside\r\nstood up squarely and said, in his open, honest manner, \"For the\r\nfailure in the attack I am responsible.\"\r\n\r\nLearning that Generals Hooker, Newton, Franklin, Cochrane, and\r\nothers had been intriguing against him and urging his dismissal,\r\nGeneral Burnside promptly issued an order dismissing them from the\r\nservice of the Union.  President Lincoln would not consent to this\r\nand permit the dismissal of these demoralized officers, whose\r\npartisan prejudices had overshadowed their loyalty to their commander.\r\nGeneral Burnside then resigned, General Hooker was appointed his\r\nsuccessor, and the Army of the Potomac went into winter quarters\r\non the north bank of the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  A.E.Burnside\r\nAMBROSE EVERETT BURNSIDE was born at Liberty, Indiana, May 23d,\r\n1824; graduated at West Point in 1847; served in the Mexican and\r\nIndian Wars, and in the War for the Suppression of the Rebellion;\r\nwas Governor of Rhode Island, 1866-1868; was United States Senator\r\nfrom March 4th, 1875, until his death at his residence in Bristol,\r\nRhode Island, September 13th, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nSOCIAL LIFE OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1862, many Republicans were despondent.\r\nThe Administration ticket had been defeated in the elections of\r\nthe preceding month in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\r\nand Illinois, while in other loyal States the majorities had fallen\r\noff--the total returns showing the election of fifty-nine Republican\r\nRepresentatives against forty Democratic Representatives.  This\r\nencouraged the Abolitionists to urge the emancipation of the slaves,\r\nwhile the conservatives protested against it, but Mr. Lincoln\r\ncontented himself by saying:  \"You must not expect me to give up\r\nthe Government without playing my last card.\"\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of Emancipation, issued by President Lincoln on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1863, marked an era in the history, not only\r\nof the war, but of the Republic and the civilized world.  Four\r\nmillions of human beings, who had been kept in slavery under the\r\nprotection of the Federal Government, were promised their freedom\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief of the army, as a \"military necessity,\"\r\nand the pledge was gloriously redeemed.  In commemoration of this\r\nevent the colossal group entitled \"Emancipation,\" located in Lincoln\r\nPark, was erected by contributions solely from emancipated persons,\r\nand was dedicated April 14th, 1876, Frederick Douglass being the\r\norator of the occasion.  The entire work is twenty-two feet high,\r\nand the bronze work alone cost seventeen thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day was fair and the walking dry, which made it an\r\nagreeable task to keep up the Knickerbocker practice of calling on\r\nofficials and lady friends.  The President, members of the Cabinet,\r\nand other Government functionaries received a large number of\r\nvisitors during the day.  At eleven o'clock all officers of the\r\narmy in the city assembled at the War Department, and, headed by\r\nAdjutant-General Thomas and General Halleck, proceeded to the White\r\nHouse, where they were severally introduced to the President.  The\r\nofficers of the navy assembled at the Navy Department at the same\r\ntime, and, headed by Secretary Welles and Admiral Foote, also\r\nproceeded to the President's.  The display of general officers in\r\nbrilliant uniforms was an imposing sight, and attracted large\r\ncrowds.  The foreign Ministers, in accordance with the usual custom,\r\nalso called on the President, and at twelve o'clock the doors were\r\nopened to the public, who marched through the hall and shook hands\r\nwith Mr. Lincoln, to the music of the Marine Band, for two or three\r\nhours.  Mrs. Lincoln also received ladies in the same parlor with\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nWith the Emancipation Proclamation Washington was treated to a\r\nvolume of the published diary of Count Gurowski, who had been\r\nemployed as a translator in the Department of State and as a purveyor\r\nof news for Mr. Greeley.  His book was one prolonged growl from\r\nbeginning to end.  Even those whom its author seemed inclined to\r\nworship at the commencement found their share of abuse before they\r\nfinished.  Introducing the Blairs, of Missouri, with frequent\r\ncomplimentary allusions in his opening chapters, about the middle\r\nof his work Gurowski packed them off to Hades with the rest, and\r\nleft the reader in despair at the prospects of a nation governed\r\nby such a set of imbeciles and rogues as our public men were\r\nrepresented to be by the amiable Pole.  As he assailed everybody,\r\nthose who read the book were sure to find the particular object of\r\ntheir individual dislike soundly rated with the rest.\r\n\r\nThe author of this production was a singular-looking old man, small\r\nin stature, stout of figure, ugly in feature, and disfigured by a\r\npair of green goggles.  Gurowski was unsparing in his criticisms.\r\nHe set down Seward as writing too much; Sumner as a pompous, verbose\r\ntalker; Burnside as a swaggering West Pointer, and Hooker as a\r\ncasual hero.  He became so offensive to Mr. Sumner that one morning,\r\nafter listening to a torrent of his abuse, the Senator arose from\r\nhis desk, went to the door of his library, opened it, and said to\r\nthe astonished Pole, \"Go!\"  In vain were apologies proffered.  Mr.\r\nSumner, thoroughly incensed, simply repeated the word \"Go!\" and at\r\nlast the astute Gurowski went.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac, in comfortable quarters on the north bank\r\nof the Rappahannock, received generous contributions of holiday\r\ncheer.  The marching hosts of Israel were jubilant over a supply\r\nof quails, but the Army of the Potomac had showered upon it (by\r\nexpress, paid) a deluge of turkeys, geese, ducks, mince-pies,\r\npickles, and preserves.  Of course, the inexorable provost marshal\r\nseized all spirituous liquors, but there were ways and means by\r\nwhich this Maine law was evaded.  In many a tent there were\r\ncylindrical glass vessels, the contents of which would have been\r\npronounced whisky were not that fluid \"contraband,\" with many a\r\nquaintly shaped flask of Rhenish wines.\r\n\r\nNor was it forgotten that there was encircling the metropolis a\r\nscore of hospitals, in which thousands and thousands who had fought\r\nthe good fight were being nursed into health, or lay tossing on\r\nbeds of pain, sooner or later to fall into that sleep that knows\r\nno waking.  These brave patients were not forgotten.  The same\r\nspirit which prompted the wise men of the East to carry at Christmas-\r\ntide present of \"gold, frankincense, and myrrh\" to the infant Jesus,\r\n\"God's best gift to humanity,\" inspired the Union men and women at\r\nWashington with a desire to gladden the hearts of the maimed and\r\nscarred and emaciated men who had periled their lives that the\r\nRepublic might live.  Not only did \"maidens fair and matrons grave\"\r\ntoil that the hospital patients might enjoy holiday cheer, but\r\nSenator Sumner and other leading Republicans used to go from hospital\r\nto hospital, from ward to ward, from bedside to bedside, encouraging\r\nby kind words those who were the martyrs of the war.  In the Campbell\r\nHospital, under the charge of Surgeon J. H. Baxter, of Vermont,\r\nthere was a theatre, in which performances were given every night\r\nto cheer those who were convalescent.\r\n\r\nHenry Wikoff, having admitted before a Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives that he had filed at the telegraph office, for\r\ntransmission to the New York _Herald_, portions of the President's\r\nmessage, he was asked how he obtained it.  This he declined to\r\nstate, saying that he was \"under an obligation of strict secrecy.\"\r\nThe House accordingly directed the Sergeant-at-Arms to hold Wikoff\r\nin close custody, and he was locked up in a room hastily furnished\r\nfor his accommodation.  It was generally believed that Mrs. Lincoln\r\nhad permitted Wikoff to copy those portions of the message that he\r\nhad published, and this opinion was confirmed when General Sickles\r\nappeared as his counsel.  The General vibrated between Wikoff's\r\nplace of imprisonment, the White House, and the residence of Mrs.\r\nLincoln's gardener, named Watt.  The Committee finally summoned\r\nthe General before them, and put some home questions to him.  He\r\nreplied sharply, and for a few minutes a war of words raged.  He\r\nnarrowly escaped Wikoff's fate, but finally, after consulting\r\nnumerous books of evidence, the Committee concluded not to go to\r\nextremities.  While the examination was pending, the Sergeant-at-\r\nArms appeared with Watt.  He testified that he saw the message in\r\nthe library, and, being of a literary turn of mind, perused it;\r\nthat, however, he did not make a copy, but, having a tenacious\r\nmemory, carried portions of it in his mind, and the next day repeated\r\nthem word for word to Wikoff.  Meanwhile, Mr. Lincoln had visited\r\nthe Capitol and urged the Republicans on the Committee to spare\r\nhim disgrace, so Watt's improbable story was received and Wikoff\r\nwas liberated.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, when a Congressman came to bore him for an\r\nappointment or with a grievance, had a pleasant way of telling a\r\nsuccession of stories, which left his visitor no chance to state\r\nhis case.  One day, a Representative, who had been thus silenced,\r\nstated from experience as follows:  \"I've been trying for the last\r\nfour days to get an audience with the President.  I have gone to\r\nthe White House every morning and waited till dark, but could not\r\nget a chance to speak to him until to-day, when I was admitted to\r\nhis presence.  I told him what I wanted, and supposed I was going\r\nto get a direct answer, when, what do you think?  Why, he started\r\noff with, 'Do you know, I heard a good thing yesterday about the\r\ndifference between an Amsterdam Dutchman and any other \"dam\"\r\nDutchman.'  And then he commenced telling his stories.  I was mad\r\nenough to knock the old fellow down.  But the worst of the whole\r\nthing was that just as he got through with the last story in came\r\nSecretary Seward, who said he must have a private conference with\r\nhim immediately.  Mr. Lincoln cooly turned to me and said, 'Mr.\r\n----, can you call again?'  Bother his impudence, I say, to keep me\r\nlistening to his jokes for two hours, and then ask me to call\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was quite ill that winter, and was not inclined\r\nto listen to all the bores who called at the White House.  One day,\r\njust as one of these pests had seated himself for a long interview,\r\nthe President's physician happened to enter the room, and Mr.\r\nLincoln said, holding out his hands:  \"Doctor, what are these\r\nblotches?\"  \"That's varioloid, or mild small-pox,\" said the Doctor.\r\n\"They're all over me.  It is contagious, I believe?\" said Mr.\r\nLincoln.  \"Very contagious, indeed,\" replied the Esculapian attendant.\r\n\"Well, I can't stop, Mr. Lincoln; I just called to see how you\r\nwere,\" said the visitor.  \"Oh! don't be in a hurry, sir,\" placidly\r\nremarked the Executive.  \"Thank you, sir; I'll call again,\" replied\r\nthe visitor, executing a masterly retreat from a fearful contagion.\r\n\"Do, sir,\" said the President.  \"Some people said they could not\r\ntake very well to my proclamation, but now, I am happy to say, I\r\nhave something that everybody can take.\"  By this time the visitor\r\nwas making a desperate break for Pennsylvania Avenue, which he\r\nreached on the double-quick and quite out of breath.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d and 3d of May, 1863, General Hooker was most disastrously\r\ndefeated at Chancellorsville.  Several weeks later, when General\r\nLee had moved northward into Pennsylvania, exacting contributions\r\nfrom towns, and destroying manufacturing establishments, and when\r\nthe Army of the Potomac had hurried across Maryland to attack him,\r\nGeneral Hooker resigned almost on the eve of the battle of Gettysburg.\r\nGeneral Meade was placed in command, and his gallant conduct on\r\nthat occasion gave great satisfaction to President Lincoln, although\r\nhe was sadly disappointed that the invaders had not been followed\r\nand annihilated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General Grant was besieging Vicksburg, which had been\r\nwell called \"the Gibraltar of the Mississippi,\" and the people,\r\nwho had become heart-sick of military engineering, began to lose\r\ncourage.  At one time President Lincoln actually determined to\r\nsupersede General Grant by General Banks, but the latter, on arriving\r\nat the scene of hostilities, saw that everything had been done that\r\ncould be done, and that the end was near at hand.  On the 4th of\r\nJuly, General Pemberton asked for a proposition of terms, and\r\nGeneral Grant replied:  \"Unconditional surrender.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, 1863, President Lincoln, accompanied by\r\nhis Cabinet, Vice-President Hamlin, the Governors of several States,\r\nand a brilliant staff of officers, attended the dedication of the\r\nNational Cemetery at Gettysburg.  The address was delivered by\r\nEdward Everett, whose head was whitened with the snows of seventy\r\nwinters, but whose form was as erect, his complexion as clear, and\r\nhis voice as musical as it was when he had been a Representative\r\nin Congress years before.  He had then said that he would buckle\r\non his knapsack in defense of slavery; now he eulogized those who\r\nhad laid down their lives in the work of its destruction.  But his\r\nwell memorized and finely rounded sentences were eclipsed by\r\nPresident Lincoln's few words, read in an unmusical treble voice,\r\nand concluding with the sublime assertion, \"that the nation shall,\r\nunder God, have a new birth of freedom, and that governments of\r\nthe people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Geo. G. Meade\r\nGEORGE GORDON MEADE, born December 30th, 1815, at Cadiz, Spain,\r\nwhere his father was located in the United States service; graduated\r\nat West Point in 1835; entered the artillery service and was engaged\r\nin the Seminole and Mexican Wars, and in August 1861, was made\r\nBrigadier-General of Volunteers; Major-General, 1862; Commander-in-\r\nChief of the Army of the Potomac, June 28th, 1863; won the Battle\r\nof Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863; continued to command the Army of\r\nthe Potomac until the close of the war.  Died at Philadelphia,\r\nNovember 6th, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nCIVIL AND MILITARY INTRIGUES.\r\n\r\nSchuyler Colfax was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nWhen Congress met on the 7th of December, 1863, among the new\r\nmembers sworn in were Generals Garfield and Schenck, of Ohio, and\r\nDeming, of Connecticut, who had seen service; Mr. James G. Blaine,\r\nwho had been the editor of the Portland _Advertiser_, and Mr. James\r\nG. Brooks, who had for many years edited the New York _Express_,\r\nwith Brutus J. Clay, of Kentucky; George S. Boutwell and Oakes\r\nAmes, of Massachusetts, and other prominent men.  One of the first\r\nacts of Congress was to vote a medal of thanks to General Grant\r\nfor the victories which he had won at Missionary Ridge and at\r\nChattanooga.  On one side of this medal was his profile, surrounded\r\nby a wreath of laurel, with his name, the date and authority of\r\nthe presentation, and, on the encircling work, a star for each\r\nState.  On the reverse was a figure of Fame, seated in the heavens\r\nwith emblems of prosperity and power; while upon various parts of\r\nthe work the names of Grant's chief victories were inscribed.\r\n\r\nAt the New Year's reception Mr. Lincoln was in excellent spirits,\r\ngiving each passer-by a cordial greeting and a warm shake of the\r\nhand, while for some there was a quiet joke.  Mrs. Lincoln stood\r\nat his right hand, wearing a purple silk dress trimmed with black\r\nvelvet and lace, with a lace necktie fastened with a pearl pin;\r\nher head-dress was ornamented with a white plume.  Secretary Seward\r\nwas there, sphinx-like and impassible.  Governor Chase seemed\r\nsomewhat perplexed, balancing, perhaps, between the succession to\r\nthe Presidency or the Chief Justiceship; Secretary Wells' patriarchal\r\nform towered above the crowd, and there were a few Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, a majority of either House being, _on dit_, enjoying\r\nthe hospitalities of New York.  But the army officers, as they came\r\nin from the War Department, headed by General Halleck, presented\r\nan imposing display, some with epaulettes and feathers, but a\r\nmajority in battle attire.  The naval officers, headed by Admiral\r\nDavis, also presented a fine appearance.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock, the portals were thrown open, and in poured the\r\npeople in a continuous stream.  For two hours did they pass steadily\r\nalong, a living tide, which swept in, eddied around the President\r\nand his wife, and then surged into the East Room, which was a\r\nmaelstrom of humanity, uniforms, black coats, gay female attire,\r\nand citizens generally.\r\n\r\nVice-President Hamlin kept open house at his residence on F Street,\r\nand the Secretaries were all at their homes.  At Governor Seward's,\r\nMrs. Fred Seward did the honors, assisted by Miss Seward and a\r\nfriend from Auburn, while at Governor Chase's his recently married\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Senator Sprague, and Miss Chase welcomed many friends.\r\nMayor Wallach entertained his visitors with old Virginia hospitality,\r\nand at many private residences there were the traditionary bowls\r\nof egg-nog and of apple-toddy.\r\n\r\nThe friends of General Grant in Congress urged the passage of a\r\nbill to revive the grade of Lieutenant-General of the army.  It\r\nmet with some opposition, especially from General Garfield, who\r\nopposed the bill mainly on the ground that it would be improper at\r\nthat stage of the war to determine and award the greatest prize of\r\nthe conflict in the way of military preferment to any one of the\r\ndistinguished Generals of the army.  It would, he thought, be far\r\nmore fitting for Congress to wait until war was over, and see whose\r\nhead towered above the rest in the army, and then give this crown\r\nto the one whose head had risen highest.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this opposition, the bill was passed by both Houses,\r\napproved by the President on the 1st day of March, 1864, and the\r\nnext day he sent to the Senate the nomination of Ulysses S. Grant,\r\nwhich was confirmed immediately, and General Grant was summoned to\r\nWashington in person.  He wore a plain, undress uniform and a felt\r\nhat of the regulation pattern, the sides of the top crushed together.\r\nHe generally stood or walked with his left hand in his trousers\r\npocket, and had in his mouth an unlighted cigar, the end of which\r\nhe chewed restlessly.  His square-cut features, when at rest,\r\nappeared as if carved from mahogany, and his firmly set under-jaw\r\nindicated the unyielding tenacity of a bulldog, while the kind\r\nglances of his gray eyes showed that he possessed the softer traits.\r\nHe always appeared intensely preoccupied, and would gaze at any\r\none who approached him with an inquiring air, followed by a glance\r\nof recollection and a grave nod of recognition.  It was not long\r\nafter his arrival before Secretary Stanton realized that he was no\r\nlonger supreme, and the Army of the Potomac, which had virtually\r\ndictated to its successive commanders, found that the time had come\r\nwhen obedience was imperative, no matter what the loss of life\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant called on the President, he met with a hearty\r\nreception, and Mr. Lincoln, taking him into a private room, repeated\r\nto him a story from a comic article by Orpheus C. Kerr, satirically\r\ncriticising the conduct of the war.  It was a story about Captain\r\nBob Shorty and the Mackerel Brigade and the Anaconda Policy--\r\nsomething about generals in the field being hampered by a flood of\r\norders.  When he had finished his story, he told General Grant that\r\nhe did not care to know what he wanted to do, only to know what\r\nwas wanted.  He wished him to beat Lee.  How he did it was his own\r\nlookout.  He said he did not wish to know his plans or exercise\r\nany scrutiny over his operations.  So long as he beat the rebel\r\narmy he was satisfied.  The formal presentation of the new commission\r\nas Lieutenant-General was made in the presence of Cabinet officers\r\nand other distinguished guests, and was in all respects a notable\r\nhistoric scene.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, General Grant ordered a forward movement, and\r\nGeneral Meade crossed the Rappahannock with the Army of the Potomac\r\none hundred and seventeen thousand strong.  It was understood that\r\nsoon after the forward movement was commenced, General Meade\r\nhesitated about crossing the stream, under a heavy fire, but General\r\nGrant peremptorily ordered him to move forward.  This was alluded\r\nto in a letter sent to a Philadelphia newspaper by Mr. Edward\r\nCrapsey, a native of Cincinnati, who had been reputably connected\r\nwith several leading journals.  He said in his correspondence:\r\n\"History will record, but newspapers cannot, that on one eventful\r\nnight during the present campaign Grant's presence saved the army\r\nand the nation, too.  Not that General Meade was on the point of\r\ncommitting a great blunder, unwittingly, but his devotion to his\r\ncountry made him loath to lose her last army of what he deemed a\r\nlast chance.  Grant assumed the responsibility, and we are still\r\n'On to Richmond!'\"  When the newspaper containing this paragraph\r\nreached the Army of the Potomac, General Meade issued an order that\r\nMr. Crapsey be arrested, paraded through the lines of the army,\r\nwith a placard marked \"Libeler of the Press,\" and then be put\r\nwithout the lines and not be permitted to return.  This humiliating\r\npunishment was carried out in the most offensive manner possible,\r\nand Mr. Crapsey, after having been escorted through the camp on\r\nhorseback, bearing the offensive label, was sent back to Washington.\r\nThe terrific battle of the Wilderness followed, and General Grant\r\ntelegraphed for recruits, saying, \"We have ended this sixth day of\r\nvery heavy fighting.  The result at this time is very much in our\r\nfavor.  Our losses have been heavy, as well as those of the enemy.\r\nI propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, wishing to force General Grant back to the defense of\r\nWashington, ordered a corps under General Early to attack the Union\r\ncapital, which was thought to be guarded only by a few regiments\r\nof heavy artillery and by a home brigade of quartermasters' clerks,\r\nimprovised by Quartermaster-General Meigs.  On the 12th of July,\r\n1864, the advance-guard of the Confederates, commanded by General\r\nBreckinridge, came within the defenses of Washington, where they\r\nwere, to their great surprise, confronted by the veteran Sixth\r\nCorps, under General Wright, and after a few volleys had been\r\nexchanged they precipitously retreated, and hurriedly recrossed\r\nthe Potomac.  This brief engagement was witnessed from the parapet\r\nof Fort Stevens by President Lincoln, who would not retire until\r\nan officer was shot down within a few feet of him, when he reluctantly\r\nstepped below.  Sheltered from the sharp-shooters' fire, Cabinet\r\nofficers and a group of society ladies watched the fortunes of the\r\nfight.  It was no mock-battle that they witnessed on the outskirts\r\nof the national metropolis.  Stretchers soon conveyed the dying\r\nand wounded to the hospital in the rear of the fort, and the graves\r\nremain there of those who fought and fell, with the President of\r\nthe United States and his competitor at the preceding election on\r\nopposite sides, interested spectators of the scene.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Chase, provoked because the President overruled him,\r\nhad resigned his position as Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr.\r\nFessenden had been appointed in his place.  Mr. Chase desired the\r\nPresidential nomination, and an organization was formed with Senator\r\nPomeroy, of Kansas, at its head to secure the election of Chase\r\ndelegates to the next National Republican Convention.  Meanwhile\r\nChief Justice Taney died in October, 1864, and Mr. Sumner immediately\r\nurged the President to appoint Mr. Chase as his successor.  There\r\nwas then much dissatisfaction with Mr. Lincoln's Administration,\r\nand the friends of Mr. Chase were openly and secretly urging his\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sumner came to Washington he renewed his request that Mr.\r\nChase be appointed, and he had several interviews with Mr. Lincoln\r\non the subject.  One day Mr. Lincoln proposed to send for Mr. Chase\r\nand frankly tell him that he wanted to nominate him as Chief Justice,\r\nthat he would make the greatest and best Chief Justice the country\r\nhad ever had, and that he would do so if he would only give up all\r\nidea of being elected President.  Mr. Sumner replied that such a\r\nstatement, however frank it might be, would never answer, as it\r\nwould not only expose the President to criticism as attempting to\r\npurchase an opponent, but it would be offensive to Mr. Chase, as\r\nan attempt to extort from him a pledge that he would never be a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency.  Mr. Lincoln, who was quick-witted,\r\nsaw the force of Mr. Sumner's argument, and pleasantly said:  \"Well,\r\ntake this card and write on it the name of the man you desire to\r\nhave appointed.\"  Mr. Sumner wrote \"Salmon P. Chase,\" and Salmon\r\nP. Chase was promptly nominated on the 6th of December, 1864.  Mr.\r\nSumner urged the immediate confirmation of the appointment, and\r\nhaving carried it, hastened from the Senate Chamber to congratulate\r\nthe new Chief Justice.  As he came out of the room in which he\r\nconveyed the news he met Mrs. Kate Sprague, who shook her index\r\nfinger at him and said:  \"And you, too, Mr. Sumner?  Are you in\r\nthe business of shelving papa?  But never mind, I will defeat you\r\nall!\"  Mr. Sumner used to relate this incident as showing how he\r\nhad been rewarded for what he regarded as one of the most praiseworthy\r\nacts of his life.  Besides, Mr. Lincoln was not the only candidate\r\nfor the Presidential chair who would lose a rival by the appointment\r\nof Judge Chase.  Mr. Sumner had strong aspirations in that direction,\r\nbut I doubt if he regarded the bench of the Supreme Court as a\r\nstepping-stone to the White House.  Had the Senate found Mr. Johnson\r\nguilty on the impeachment charges, and had Ben Wade thus become\r\nPresident, Mr. Sumner would have been his Secretary of State, and\r\nI am not sure that this did not influence Mr. Fessenden in his vote\r\nof \"Not guilty.\"  Had General Grant offered Mr. Sumner the same\r\nposition it would have been accepted with the understanding that\r\nhe was to direct the foreign policy of the country untrammeled.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Joseph Hooker\r\nJOSEPH HOOKER, born at Hadley, Mass., November 13th, 1813; graduated\r\nat West Point, 1837; served in the Mexican War; resigned, but re-\r\nentered the service as Brigadier-General, May, 1861; Major-General,\r\n1862; Corps Commander, September, 1862; Division Commander, December,\r\n1862; Commander of the Army of the Potomac, January, 1863; transferred\r\nto the West and served from Lookout Mountain to Atlanta; commanded\r\nthe Northern Department, September, 1864, to July, 1865; retired\r\nOctober 15th, 1868; died, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nEVENTS BOTH SAD AND JOYOUS.\r\n\r\nTo gratify Mr. Seward, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, had been placed\r\non the Republican ticket and elected Vice-President.  Mr. Lincoln's\r\nre-inauguration took place under circumstances widely different\r\nfrom those which attended his inauguration in 1861.  Then seven\r\nStates had seceded from the Union, and the President had taken the\r\noath of office surrounded by enemies whose disposition to assassinate\r\nwas stronger than their courage to execute.  At the re-inauguration\r\nthe Federal Government was a substance as well as a name, controlling\r\ngreat armies and navies, and having nearly conquered the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March, 1865, was rainy and unpleasant, while the streets\r\nand sidewalks were encrusted with from two to ten inches of muddy\r\npaste, through which men and horses plodded wearily.  The procession\r\nwas a very creditable one, including the model of a monitor on\r\nwheels, and drawn by four white horses.  It had a revolving turret\r\ncontaining a small cannon, which was frequently fired as the\r\nprocession moved.  There was a large delegation of Philadelphia\r\nfiremen, the Washington City Fire Department, the colored Grand\r\nLodge of Odd Fellows, and the Typographical Society, with a press\r\non a car from which a programme was printed and distributed.  Many\r\nother civic bodies joined the demonstration, and added to its\r\nimmensity and impressiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate Chamber there was the usual attendance of the Diplomatic\r\nCorps, the Supreme Court, those officers of the army and navy who\r\nhad received the thanks of Congress, and a number of prominent\r\ncitizens.  Mr. Lincoln, on his arrival at the Capitol, was shown\r\nto the President's room, where, as is customary during the closing\r\nhour of a session, he signed several bills.  Mr. Johnson was escorted\r\nto the Vice-President's room opposite, where he was welcomed by\r\nMr. Hamlin, the retiring Vice-President.  There was nothing unusual\r\nin his appearance, except that he did not seem in robust health.\r\nThe usual courtesies being exchanged, the conversation proceeded\r\non ordinary topics for a few moments, when Mr. Johnson asked Mr.\r\nHamlin if he had any liquor in his room, stating that he was sick\r\nand nervous.  He was told that there was none, but it could be sent\r\nfor.  Brandy being indicated, a bottle was brought from the Senate\r\nrestaurant by one of the pages.  It was opened, a tumbler provided,\r\nand Mr. Johnson poured it about two-thirds full.  Mr. Hamlin said,\r\nin telling it, that if Mr. Johnson ordinarily took such drinks as\r\nthat he must be able to stand a great deal.  After a few minutes\r\nthe bottle was placed in one of the book-cases out of sight.  When,\r\nnear twelve o'clock, the Sergeant-at-Arms, Mr. Brown, came to the\r\ndoor and suggested that the gentlemen get ready to enter the Senate\r\nChamber, Mr. Hamlin arose, moved to the door, near which the Sergeant-\r\nat-Arms stood, and suggested to Mr. Johnson to come also.  The\r\nlatter got up and walked nearly to the door, when, turning to Mr.\r\nHamlin, he said:  \"Excuse me a moment,\" and walked back hastily to\r\nwhere the bottle was deposited.  Mr. Hamlin saw him take it out,\r\npour as large a quantity as before into the glass, and drink it\r\ndown like water.  They then went into the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of everybody, the Vice-President, when called on\r\nto take the oath of office, made a maudlin, drunken speech.  He\r\naddressed the Diplomatic Corps and the heads of departments in the\r\nmost incoherent, and in some instances offensive, manner.  The\r\nRepublican Senators were horror-stricken, and Colonel Forney vainly\r\nendeavored to make him conclude his harangue; but he would not be\r\nstopped; the brandy had made him crazily drunk, and the mortifying\r\nscene was prolonged until he was told that it was necessary to go\r\nwith the President to the eastern front of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's inaugural was delivered before the assembled multitude\r\nin front of the Capitol in a full, clear tone of voice.  He went\r\non to say:  \"Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would\r\n_make_ war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would\r\n_accept_ war rather than let it perish.  And the war came.\"  Then\r\nthere arose a deafening shout, for the people felt that the case\r\nhad been well stated, and they were all disposed to _accept_ war\r\nrather than let the nation perish.\r\n\r\nAs the President closed his address Chief Justice Chase arose and\r\nstood facing him.  The oath of office was then administered, Mr.\r\nLincoln exhibiting by his manner and gestures the full concurrence\r\nof mind and heart with the intent of the obligation.  As he concluded\r\nthe ceremony by taking from the Chief Justice the Bible upon which\r\nhe had been sworn, and reverently pressing his lips to it, there\r\nwas a marked sensation through the vast audience, followed by a\r\nresponsive cheer.  Then the cannon near by thundered forth the\r\nannouncement that the President of the people's choice had been\r\ninaugurated, the bands struck up the national airs, and there were\r\nhearty rounds of cheers.\r\n\r\nThe ball on the evening of Mr. Lincoln's re-inauguration was held\r\nin a large hall of the Department of the Interior, which had just\r\nbeen completed.  It was brilliantly lighted and dressed with flags.\r\nMr. Lincoln and Speaker Colfax entered together, followed by Mrs.\r\nLincoln upon the arm of Charles Sumner.  Mr. Lincoln wore a full\r\nblack suit, with white kid gloves, and Mrs. Lincoln was attired in\r\nwhite silk, with a splendid overdress of rich lace, point lace\r\nbertha and puffs of silk, white fan and gloves.  Her hair was\r\nbrushed back smoothly, falling in curls upon the neck, while a\r\nwreath of jasmines and violets encircled her head.  Her ornaments\r\nwere of pearl.  Having promenaded the entire length of the room,\r\nthey mounted the few steps leading to the seats placed for them\r\nupon the dais, while the crowd gathered densely in front of them.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy were well represented, adding greatly to the\r\nbeauty of the scene in the bright uniforms that everywhere flashed\r\nbefore the eyes.  Admiral Farragut, General Banks, and General\r\nHooker shone conspicuously, as did also General Halleck, who stood,\r\nsmiling and happy, to receive greetings from his friends.  The\r\nmembers of the Cabinet assumed the seats upon the dais reserved\r\nfor them, and up to twelve o'clock the crowd continued to pour into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock the door was opened for supper, and the crowd\r\nwhich had been gathered about it for half an hour rushed forward.\r\nSuch a crush and scramble as there was!  Little screams, broken\r\nexclamations, and hurried protestations against the rush were heard\r\nupon all sides, but no one heeded or cared for anything but to find\r\na place at the table, at one end of which stood the President, Mrs.\r\nLincoln, and their suite.\r\n\r\nThe supper scene was one never to be forgotten.  Aside from its\r\nluxury and splendor, there was so much that was ridiculously\r\nlaughable connected with it, one naturally looks back upon it in\r\nkeen amusement.  The tables having been instantly filled up, all\r\nthe spaces between the large glass cases containing the office\r\nproperty were soon crowded to their utmost capacity.  Many a fair\r\ncreature dropped upon the benches with exclamations of delight,\r\nwhile their attendants sought to supply them from the table, to\r\nwhich they had to fight their way.  Those who could not get seats\r\nstood around in groups, or sank down upon the floor in utter\r\nabandonment from fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to sit and watch the crowd, to hear the gay laugh,\r\nthe busy hum of conversation, and the jingle of plates, spoons,\r\nand glasses; to see hands uplifted, bearing aloft huge dishes of\r\nsalads and creams, loaves of cake and stores of candies, not\r\ninfrequently losing plentiful portions on the way.  Many an elegant\r\ndress received its donation of cream, many a tiny slipper bore away\r\ncrushed sweets and meats, and lay among fragments of glass and\r\nplates upon the floor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was \"thundering all around the heavens,\" and every\r\nnight General Grant, in his humble headquarters at City Point, knew\r\nexactly what had been done.  In his midnight despatches to President\r\nLincoln which were telegraphed all over the loyal States, he narrated\r\nthe day's success, giving full credit, when necessary, to the\r\noriginal genius of Sherman, the daring pluck of Sheridan, the cool\r\ndetermination of Thomas, the military ability of Terry, and the\r\nsagacious gallantry of Schofield, but never alluding to himself as\r\nhaving directed these subordinates on their respective paths to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee and his brave army saw that the end was at hand.  They\r\ncould no longer be deceived by the verbose platitudes of politicians\r\nabout foreign intervention or strategic purposes, and they saw the\r\nstars and stripes approaching on every hand.  For four long years\r\nthey had fought for their hearths and homes with a bravery that\r\nhad elicited the admiration of their opponents, but steady, ceaseless\r\nfighting had thinned their ranks and there were no more men to take\r\ntheir places.  They had been out-manoeuvred, out-marched, and out-\r\ngeneraled, while hard knocks and repeated blows were daily diminishing\r\ntheir commands.  At length, Richmond was captured, and General Lee\r\nformally surrendered at Appomattox Court-House, ending the greatest\r\ncivil war recorded in history.\r\n\r\nAs the Union armies advanced, thousands of unemployed and impecunious\r\ncolored people sought refuge in the District of Columbia.  Gathering\r\nup their scanty chattels, they made their way from the houses of\r\ntheir masters to Washington, the Mecca of their imaginations, with\r\na firm belief that they would there find freedom and plenty.  It\r\nwas a leap in the dark, but they imagined it a leap from darkness\r\ninto light, and when they reached the national metropolis, with\r\nits public buildings and its busy throng, they believed that at\r\nlast they had entered the promised land.  Free from care at the\r\nfirst, they loitered and lounged and slept and laughed in sunny\r\nplaces.  But no feast was offered them; they were invited to no\r\nhospitable homes; the men were no longer offered a few new Treasury\r\nnotes of small value if they would enlist, and be counted on the\r\nquota of some Northern town, which would pay the agents five hundred\r\nor six hundred dollars for each recruit thus obtained.  They were\r\nstrangers in a strange land, despised by their own people who were\r\nresidents, and crowded into stable lofts and rude hovels, where\r\nmany of them, before they had fairly tasted the blessings of freedom,\r\nsickened and suffered and died.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Thursday, the 13th of April, 1865, Mr. Lincoln made\r\nhis last address to the people who loved him so well.  Richmond\r\nhad fallen, Davis had fled, Lee had surrendered, and on the previous\r\nday the formal laying down of arms had taken place.  The White\r\nHouse was illuminated, as were the other public buildings, and\r\ndeafening shouts arose from the crowds assembled outside, jubilant\r\nover the glorious victories.  Mr. Lincoln had written out some\r\nremarks, knowing well that great importance would be attached to\r\nwhatever he said.  These he read to the rejoicing throng from loose\r\nsheets, holding a candle in his hand as he read.  As he finished\r\neach page he would throw it to the ground, where it was picked up\r\nby Master Thad, who was at his father's side, and who occasionally\r\nshouted, \"Give me another paper!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln had concluded his speech, he said:  \"Now I am\r\nabout to call upon the band for a tune that our adversaries over\r\nthe way have endeavored to appropriate.  But we fairly captured it\r\nyesterday and the Attorney-General gave me his legal opinion that\r\nit is now our property.  So I ask the band to play 'Dixie!'\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  your obtservt\r\n  R ELee\r\nROBERT EDWARD LEE, born at Stratford, Westmoreland County, Virginia,\r\nJanuary 19th, 1807; graduated with first honors at West Point in\r\n1829; served in the Mexican War; resigned in 1861, and was, early\r\nin 1862, appointed commander of the armies about Richmond; early\r\nin 1865 was made Commander-in-Chief of all the Confederate forces;\r\nsurrendered at Appomattox, April 9th, 1865; became President of\r\nWashington College at Lexington, Virginia, where he died October\r\n12th, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nPLUNGED INTO SORROW.\r\n\r\nWashington City was delirious with gladness when General Grant\r\n\"came marching home,\" and the telegraph wires from every part of\r\nthe country recently in rebellion vibrated with the tidings of\r\nvictory and submission.  Orders from the War Department went out\r\nover the loyal North proclaiming the absolute overthrow of the\r\nRebellion, the return of peace, the stopping of recruiting, the\r\nraising of the blockade, the reduction of national expenditures,\r\nand the removal of all military restrictions upon trade and commerce,\r\nso far as might be consistent with public safety.  Drafting had\r\nbeen one of the most grievous burdens of the war, but it had been\r\nrigorously pressed in all States which had not otherwise furnished\r\ntheir quotas of troops.  When the surrender occurred, the dread\r\nwheel was in operation in many places, and drawn men were in custody\r\nof the proper officials preparing to go to the front.  But all this\r\nwas stopped, and none were happier than those who involuntarily\r\nhad been held thus for military duty, but who now became free.\r\n\r\nThe 13th of April was a day of general rejoicing at the metropolis.\r\nThe stars and stripes waved over the public and many of the private\r\nbuildings, business was suspended, and men went about in groups\r\nindulging in libations to the return of peace.  As night came on\r\nthe departments and many private houses were illuminated, bonfires\r\nblazed in the streets, and fireworks lit up the sky.  In the forts\r\nand camps around the city blazed huge bonfires, while the heavy\r\nsiege guns thundered their joyful approval of peace.\r\n\r\nIt was announced in the newspapers of that day that President\r\nLincoln, accompanied by General Grant, would attend Ford's Theatre\r\nthe next night.  The President did extend an invitation to his\r\nvictorious commander to accompany him, but General Grant, always\r\nadverse to public demonstrations, declined, that he might go at\r\nonce to Burlington, New Jersey, with Mrs. Grant, to \"see the\r\nchildren.\"  The Presidential party consequently was only four in\r\nnumber--President Lincoln, his wife, Miss Harris, and Major Rathbone.\r\nOnly one of the two stage-boxes which had been decorated for the\r\nparty was occupied.  When the President appeared, about a quarter\r\nbefore nine o'clock, the play was stopped, the orchestra played\r\n\"Hail to the Chief,\" and the crowded audience gave a succession of\r\nvociferous cheers.\r\n\r\nThe play proceeded.  Mr. Lincoln and his party were in fine spirits,\r\nintently watching the performance, when a pistol-shot was heard,\r\nand the first impression of every one was that it was fired on the\r\nstage.  So thought Major Rathbone, until, looking around, he saw\r\nsmoke and a man with a drawn dagger in his hand.  The truth\r\nindistinctly flashed into his mind; he arose and seized the unknown\r\nman with both hands.  A momentary scuffle ensued, in which the\r\nassassin made a thrust at the Major, grazing his breast and piercing\r\nhis left arm near the shoulder.  Something seemed to give way about\r\nthe man's coat collar, and he disappeared.  The smoke prevented\r\nthe Major or Miss Harris from getting a fair view of the fellow,\r\nand Mrs. Lincoln did not see him until he leaped out of the box.\r\nHer first impression was that it was her husband who leaped out.\r\n\r\nMeantime the assassin appeared on the edge of the box, crying \"_Sic\r\nSemper Tyrannis!_\" and flourishing a dagger, he leaped to the stage.\r\nHe crossed the stage rapidly, exclaiming, \"Revenge!\" and, again\r\nflourishing his dagger, disappeared, saying \"I have done it!\"\r\nThough quickly pursued, it was too late.  Leaving the theatre by\r\na back door, he mounted his horse in waiting there and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe President was seen to turn in his seat, and persons leaped upon\r\nthe stage and clambered up to the box.  His clothes were stripped\r\nfrom his shoulders but no wound was at first found.  He was entirely\r\ninsensible.  Further search revealed the fact that he had been shot\r\nin the head, and he was carried to the nearest house, immediately\r\nopposite.  Mrs. Lincoln, in a frantic condition, was assisted in\r\ncrossing the street with the President, at the same time uttering\r\nheart-rending shrieks.  Surgeons were soon in attendance, but it\r\nwas evident that the wound was mortal.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of terror.  The long roll was beaten in the distant\r\ncamps, and the soldiers throughout the encircling fortifications\r\nstood to their arms; mounted men patrolled the streets in every\r\ndirection; the tolling of the church-bells fell heavily on the ear\r\nand entered deep into all hearts, and it was not only President\r\nLincoln, but it was reported that Mr. Seward and other members of\r\nthe Cabinet had been assassinated.  Mr. Seward was indeed murderously\r\nassaulted upon his sick-bed, but he escaped with his life.  Amid\r\nthese terrors the sleepless citizens fell from their heights of\r\njoy to the depths of gloom.\r\n\r\nWith the morning came the President's death at an early hour.  As\r\nthe bells tolled his departure, the bloom of the national colors\r\nwas shrouded in black, and the weather was cheerless, cold, and\r\ndamp.  If ever nature sympathized with man since the time when the\r\nsun was darkened and the dead walked the streets of Jerusalem, it\r\ncertainly seemed to do so on the memorable 15th of April, which\r\nushered in the saddest news that ever fell upon the ears of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nIt was known, beyond a doubt, before Mr. Lincoln breathed his last,\r\nthat his assassin was John Wilkes Booth, a son of the great tragedian,\r\nthen twenty-seven years of age.  He had played stock parts at\r\nWashington and other Southern and Western cities, where he had\r\ngiven unmistakable evidence of genuine dramatic talent.  He had,\r\nadded to his native genius, the advantage of a voice musically full\r\nand rich; a face almost classic in outline; features highly\r\nintellectual; a piercing, black eye, capable of expressing the\r\nfiercest and the tenderest passion and emotion, and a commanding\r\nfigure and impressive stage address.  In his transition from the\r\nquiet and reflective passages of a part to fierce and violent\r\noutbreaks of passion, his sudden and impetuous manner had in it\r\nsomething of that electrical force and power which made the elder\r\nBooth so celebrated, and called up afresh to the memory of men of\r\nthe preceding generation the presence, voice, and manner of his\r\nfather.  Convivial in his habits, sprightly and genial in conversation,\r\nJohn Wilkes Booth made many friends among the young men of his own\r\nage, and he was a favorite among the ladies at the National Hotel,\r\nwhere he boarded.\r\n\r\nThe funeral honors paid to President Lincoln at Washington, on the\r\n19th of April, were a fitting tribute to the illustrious dead.\r\nThe dawn that was ushered in by the heavy booms of salutes of minute-\r\nguns from the fortifications surrounding the city never broke purer\r\nor brighter or clearer than on this morning.  The day that followed\r\nwas the loveliest of the season.  The heavens were undimmed by even\r\none passing cloud.\r\n\r\nAt a very early hour people began to assemble in the vicinity of\r\nthe Executive Mansion, which was almost entirely draped in crape,\r\nas were also the buildings, public and private, in the neighborhood.\r\nAll over the city public houses and private residences were closed.\r\nAt twelve o'clock the ceremonies commenced in the East Room, whose\r\nceilings were draped, and whose resplendent mirrors were hung on\r\nthe borders with emblems of mourning and white drapery, which gave\r\nthe room a dim light that was adapted to the solemnity of the\r\nmournful scene.  All that remained of Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth\r\nPresident of the United States, lay on the grand and gloomy\r\ncatafalque, which was relieved, however, by choice flowers.\r\n\r\nThe spectators of the sorrowful scene were not merely the\r\nrepresentatives of our people in Congress and of state, but the\r\nexecutive officers and Cabinet Ministers, the Chief Justice of the\r\nUnited States and his associates on the bench of that venerated\r\ntribunal, chieftains who protected our homes by service in the\r\nfield and on the ocean, the clergy, and multitudes in various\r\npositions in the affairs of state and from private life, and an\r\nimposing array of Ambassadors, with their less elevated attaches,\r\nwith gorgeous decorations.  Perhaps the most touching grief, and\r\nthe one which moved all present, was that of little Thaddeus Lincoln,\r\na favorite son.  He and his elder brother, Robert, were the only\r\nmourners of the family present.\r\n\r\nDuring the service President Johnson stood beside the remains of\r\nhis predecessor, and during the oration, General Grant sat at the\r\nhead of the corpse.  The Rev. Dr. L. Hall, rector of the Church of\r\nthe Epiphany, rose and read portions of the service for the burial\r\nof the dead.  Bishop Simpson offered a prayer, in which he fervently\r\nalluded to the emancipation and other deeds performed by President\r\nLincoln.  The Rev. Dr. Gurley then read a funeral oration.  At two\r\nP. M. the funeral procession started, all of the bells in the city\r\ntolling, and minute-guns firing from all the forts.  Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, from the Treasury to the Capitol, was entirely clear from\r\ncurb to curb.  Preceding the hearse was the military escort, over\r\none mile long, the arms of each officer and man being draped with\r\nblack.  At short intervals bands discoursed dirges and drums beat\r\nmuffled sounds.  After the artillery came the civic procession,\r\nheaded by Marshal Lamon, the Surgeon-General, and physicians who\r\nattended the President.  At this point the hearse appeared, and\r\nthe thousands, as it passed, uncovered their heads.\r\n\r\nThe funeral car was large.  The lower base was fourteen feet long\r\nand seven feet wide, and eight feet from the ground.  The upper\r\nbase, upon which the coffin rested, was eleven feet long and five\r\nfeet below the top of the canopy.  The canopy was surmounted by a\r\ngilt eagle, covered with crape.  The hearse was entirely covered\r\nwith cloth, velvet, crape, and alpaca.  The seat was covered with\r\ncloth, and on each side was a splendid lamp.  The car was fifteen\r\nfeet high, and the coffin was so placed as to afford a full view\r\nto all spectators.  It was drawn by six gray horses, each attended\r\nby a groom.\r\n\r\nThe pall-bearers were, on the part of the Senate, Foster, of\r\nConnecticut; Morgan, of New York; Johnson, of Maryland; Yates, of\r\nIllinois; Wade, of Ohio, and Conness, of California.  On the part\r\nof the House, Davis, of Massachusetts; Coffroth, of Pennsylvania;\r\nSmith, of Kentucky; Colfax, of Indiana; Worthington, of Nevada,\r\nand Washburne, of Illinois.  On the part of the army, Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral Grant, Major-General Halleck, and Brigadier-General Nichols.\r\nOn the part of the navy, Vice-Admiral Farragut, Rear-Admiral\r\nShubrick, and Colonel Jacob Ziellen, of the Marine Corps.  Civilians,\r\nO. H. Browning, George P. Ashmun, Thomas Corwin, and Simon Cameron.\r\n\r\nAfter the hearse came the family, consisting only of Robert Lincoln\r\nand his little brother and their relatives.  Mrs. Lincoln did not\r\ngo out.  Next was President Johnson, riding in a carriage with\r\nGeneral Auger on the right, and General Slough on the left, mounted.\r\nFollowing him were the Cabinet, Chief Justice Chase and the Supreme\r\nBench, and the Diplomatic Corps, who were then succeeded by Senators\r\nand Representatives.  The procession then reached two miles more,\r\nand was composed of public officers, delegations from various cities\r\nand members of civic societies, together with another large display\r\nof military.  Some five thousand colored men were a prominent\r\nfeature toward the end.\r\n\r\nThe procession was two hours and ten minutes in passing a given\r\npoint, and was about three miles long.  The centre of it had reached\r\nthe Capitol and was returning before the rear had left Willard's.\r\nIn one single detachment were over six thousand civil employees of\r\nthe Government.  Arriving at the Capitol, the remains were placed\r\nin the centre of the rotunda, beneath the mighty dome, which had\r\nbeen draped in mourning inside and out.  The Rev. Dr. Gurley, in\r\nthe presence of hundreds, impressively pronounced the burial\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's remains were taken from the rotunda at six\r\no'clock on the morning of April 21st, and escorted to the train\r\nwhich was to convey them to Springfield.  The remains of little\r\nWillie Lincoln, who died in February, 1862, and which had been\r\nplaced in the vault at Oak Hill Cemetery, were removed to the depot\r\nabout the same time, and placed in the same car with the remains\r\nof his lamented father.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Andrew Johnson\r\nANDREW JOHNSON was born at Raleigh, North Carolina, December 29th,\r\n1808; was a Representative in Congress from Tennessee, 1843-1853;\r\nwas Governor of Tennessee, 1853-1857; was a United States Senator\r\nfrom Tennessee from December 7th, 1857, until he was appointed\r\nMilitary Governor of that State; was elected Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States on the Republican ticket with Abraham Lincoln and\r\nwas inaugurated March 4th, 1865; became President after the\r\nassassination of President Lincoln, April 15th, 1865; was impeached\r\nand acquitted, May 26th, 1868; was again elected United States\r\nSenator from Tennessee, serving at the Special Session of 1875,\r\nand died in Carter County, Tennessee, July 31st, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY TRIAL--THE GRAND REVIEWS.\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson took the oath of office as President of the United\r\nStates, administered to him by Chief Justice Chase, at his room in\r\nthe Kirkwood House.  He sent word to Mrs. Lincoln to occupy the\r\nWhite House so long as might be agreeable to her, and he accepted\r\nthe hospitality of Mr. Sam Hooper, a merchant prince, who then\r\nrepresented a Boston district in the House of Representatives, and\r\noccupied his own comfortable house at the corner of Fourteenth and\r\nH Streets.\r\n\r\nEvery morning President Johnson went to the Treasury Department,\r\nwhere he received scores of delegations, and his speeches to them\r\nforeshadowed a reconstruction policy which would deal severely with\r\nthe leading Secessionists.  In response to Governor Andrew, who\r\ncalled at the head of a delegation of citizen of Massachusetts,\r\nand assured him of the support of the Old Bay State, he made a long\r\nspeech, he defined crimes, saying:  \"It is time the American people\r\nshould be taught to understand that treason is a crime--not in\r\nrevenge, not in anger--but that treason is a crime, and should be\r\nesteemed as such, and punished as such.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson went on to say that he wished \"to discriminate between\r\ncriminals guilty of treason.  There are,\" he said, \"well educated,\r\nintelligent traitors, who concert schemes of treason and urge others\r\nto force numbers of ignorant people to carry them.\"\r\n\r\nMoney was lavishly expended in securing the arrest of those who\r\nhad conspired with Booth to assassinate President Lincoln, Vice-\r\nPresident Johnson, Secretary Seward, and General Grant.  In a\r\nfortnight the prisoners had been arrested (with the exception of\r\nBooth, who having been tracked to a barn, and refusing to come out,\r\nhad been shot) and a military commission had been organized for\r\ntheir trial in the old penitentiary near the Arsenal, where they\r\nwere confined.  It was clearly shown before the Commission, of\r\nwhich General David Hunter was President and General Joseph Holt\r\nthe Judge Advocate, that leading Secessionists in Canada had supplied\r\nBooth with funds for the abduction of President Lincoln, but there\r\nwas no proof that they were privy to the assassination.\r\n\r\nBooth squandered the money received by him in coal-oil speculations,\r\nand in his attention to an estimable young lady, whose photograph\r\nwas found in his pocket-book after his death, but whose name was\r\nhonorably kept a secret.  Mrs. Surratt naturally attracted the most\r\nattention as she entered the room where the Military Commission\r\nwas held every morning, the iron which connected her ankles clanking\r\nas she walked.  She was rather a buxom-looking woman, dressed in\r\ndeep black, with feline gray eyes, which watched the whole proceedings.\r\nThe evidence showed that she had been fully aware of the plot.\r\nHer house was used by Booth, Payne, Atzerott, and Harold as a\r\nmeeting place.  Her son went to Richmond and then to Canada with\r\ninformation, and he had only returned immediately before the\r\nassassination.  He was in Washington that day and night, and four\r\ndays later had reached Montreal.  She took the arms to Surrattsville,\r\nto the tavern which she owned, and the day of the assassination\r\nrode out with a team Booth had furnished money to hire, to say that\r\nthe arms she had left and the field-glass she took would be wanted\r\nthat night.  Payne, after attacking Secretary Seward, and vainly\r\nattempting to escape, had called at her house in the night, and\r\nsought admittance, but an officer was in charge, and Payne, not\r\nhaving a plausible explanation of his unseasonable call, was\r\narrested.  Mrs. Surratt was clearly shown to have been an actor in\r\nthe plot, but many doubted whether she should have been hung, and\r\nregretted that neither her confessor nor her daughter was permitted\r\nto see President Johnson and ask his clemency.\r\n\r\nThe male prisoners, heavily ironed, were seated side by side in a\r\ndock interspersed with officers.  Sam Arnold was of respectable\r\nappearance, about thirty years of age, with dark hair and beard\r\nand a good countenance.  Spangler, the stage-carpenter, was a\r\nchunky, light-haired, rather bloated and whisky-soaked looking man.\r\nAtzerott had a decided lager beer look, with heavy blue eyes, light\r\nhair, and sallow complexion.  O'Laughlin might have been taken for\r\nnative of Cuba, short and slender, with luxuriant black locks, a\r\ndelicate moustache and whiskers, and vivacious black eyes.  Payne\r\nwas the incarnation of a Roman gladiator, tall, muscular, defiant,\r\nwith a low forehead, large blue eyes, thin lips, and black, straight\r\nhair, with much of the animal and little of the intellectual.  Dave\r\nHarold was what the ladies call a pretty little man, with cherry\r\ncheeks, pouting lips, an incipient beard, dark hazel eyes, and\r\ndark, long hair.  Last on the bench was Dr. Mudd, whose ankles and\r\nwrists were joined by chains instead of the unyielding bars which\r\njoined the bracelets and anklets of the others.  He was about sixty\r\nyears of age, with a blonde complexion, reddish face, and blue eyes.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were allowed counsel and such witnesses as they\r\ndesired to have summoned.  The Commission concluded its labors on\r\nthe 30th of June.  On the 5th of July the President approved the\r\nfinding and sentence, and ordered the hanging of Mrs. Surratt,\r\nHarold, Atzerott, and Payne to take place on the 7th.  The sentence\r\nof execution was carried into effect, and Arnold, Mudd, Spangler,\r\nand O'Laughlin were sent to the Military Prison on the Dry Tortugas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the victorious armies of the Union had been congregated\r\nat Washington, where they passed in review before President Johnson\r\nand General Grant, and then marched home and into history.  On the\r\n23d of May the \"Army of the Potomac,\" and on the 24th the \"Division\r\nof the Mississippi,\" swept through the metropolis for hours, the\r\nsuccessive waves of humanity crested with gleaming sabres and\r\nburnished bayonets, while hundreds of bands made the air ring with\r\npatriotic music.  Loyal voices cheered and loyal hands applauded\r\nas the heroic guardians of the national ark of constitutional\r\nliberty passed along.  Neither did the legions of imperial Rome,\r\nreturning in triumph along the Appian Way, or the conquering hosts\r\nof Napoleon the Great, when welcomed back from their Italian campaign\r\nby the Parisians, or the British Guards, when they returned from\r\nthe Crimea, receive a more heartfelt ovation than was awarded to\r\nthe laurel-crowned \"Boys in Blue.\"\r\n\r\nGreat expectation concerning this review was indulged throughout\r\nthe nation.  This home-coming of the \"Boys in Blue\" was a matter\r\ninteresting every hamlet of the North and almost every home.  But\r\nmore than the welcome was clustering about the scene.  These grand\r\narmies and their famous leaders had become historic, and worthily\r\nso, for they had endured and achieved, and victory now was theirs.\r\nThe newspapers proclaimed the grandeur of the coming event; the\r\nrailroads extended their best accommodations to travelers, and the\r\npeople responded in immense numbers.  With the soldiery and the\r\ncivilians, Washington was densely packed, but cheerful enthusiasm\r\nappeared on every side.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred thousand veteran troops, trained on a hundred battlefields,\r\nand commanded by the leading Generals of the service, were there\r\nto be reviewed by the Lieutenant-General who commanded them all,\r\nby the President of the United States, by his Cabinet, by the\r\ndignitaries of our own and other nations, and by the innumerable\r\nthrong of private citizens whose homes had been saved, and whose\r\nhearts now beat with grateful joy.\r\n\r\nIn those proud columns were to march the Army of the Potomac, the\r\nArmy of the James, the Army of Georgia, the Army of the Tennessee,\r\nand the cavalry led by the indomitable Phil. Sheridan.  To behold\r\nsuch a spectacle men came from every portion of the North; fathers\r\nbrought their sons to see this historic pageant, while historians,\r\npoets, novelists, and painters thronged to see the unparalleled\r\nsight and there to gather material and inspiration for their future\r\nworks.  In that great display were to march heroes whose names will\r\nlive while history endures.\r\n\r\nThe night before the review of the Army of the Potomac was wet and\r\ndreary enough, but as day dawned the clouds disappeared, and the\r\nscene in Maryland Avenue, between the Long Bridge and the Capitol,\r\nand on the large plain east of that building, was warlike and\r\ninteresting.  Brigades marching at route step, bivouac fires, around\r\nwhich groups were eating their breakfast, orderly sergeants insisting\r\nin very naughty yet impressive language on the use of sand paper\r\non muskets already bright, musicians rehearsing some new march,\r\nlittle boys bracing up drums half as high as themselves, important\r\nadjutants riding to and fro to hurry up the formation of their\r\nrespective regiments, elegantly attired aides-de-camp galloping\r\nlike mad and endeavoring to avoid mud puddles, batteries thundering\r\nalong, as if eager to unlimber and fire at some enemy--in short,\r\nit was fifty acres, more or less, of uniforms, horses, flags, and\r\nbayonets, in apparently inextricable confusion.  Yet one man ran\r\nthe machine.  A few words from him reduced confusion to order, and\r\nthe apparent snarl of humanity and horses began to be unraveled in\r\na single, unbroken line, when General Meade gave the single word,\r\n\"Forward!\"  Exactly as the watches marked nine the head of the\r\ncolumn moved from the Capitol toward the reviewing stand along\r\nPennsylvania Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe reviewing stand, erected on the sidewalk in front of the White\r\nHouse, was a long pavilion, with a tight roof, decorated with flags\r\nand bearing the names of the principal victories won.  In this\r\npavilion were seated the assistant secretaries and heads of bureaus\r\nand Diplomatic Corps.  President Johnson occupied the central chair\r\nin a projection from the centre of the front, with Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral Grant, Major-General Sherman, and the members of the Cabinet\r\nat his right and left hand.\r\n\r\nThe reviewing pavilion was flanked by two long stands, occupied by\r\nofficials, ladies, and wounded soldiers.  Opposite the reviewing\r\npavilion was another on the north sidewalk for Congressional and\r\nState officials, and on the flanks of this pavilion were others,\r\nerected at private expense, for the families of officers on parade\r\nand for the citizens of Ohio, New Jersey, Connecticut, and\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac was six hours in passing the reviewing\r\nstand.  As each brigade commander saluted, President Johnson would\r\nrise and lift his hat.  General Grant sat during the whole time\r\nimmovable, except that he would occasionally make some commendatory\r\ncomment as a gallant officer or brave regiment passed.  The foreign\r\nMinisters appeared deeply impressed by the spectacle.\r\n\r\nIt was the subject of general regret in the Army of the Potomac\r\nthat President Lincoln was not there to review those who idolized\r\nhim.  For four long years they had guarded him at the Federal\r\nmetropolis, often fighting desperately under generals whose ability\r\nto command was doubtful.  Meanwhile the dandies of McClellan's\r\nforce had become veteran campaigners, accustomed to the exposure\r\nof the bivouac, the fatigue of the march, the poor comfort of hard-\r\ntack, the storm of battle, and the suffering of sickness and wounds.\r\nThey had watched on many a picket line the movements of a wily foe;\r\nthey paced their weary rounds on guard on many a wet and cheerless\r\nnight; they had gone through the smoke and breasted the shock and\r\nturned the tide of many a hard-fought field.\r\n\r\nThe Division of the Mississippi, which had swept like a cyclone\r\n\"from Atlanta to the sea,\" was reviewed the next day.  General\r\nSherman, by granting amnesty to Joe Johnson's army, had incurred\r\nthe displeasure of Secretary Stanton, who had intended that he\r\nshould not have headed his victorious legions; but he was not to\r\nbe separated from his \"boys.\"  As he passed along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue the multitude of spectators sent up shouts that must have\r\nmade his heart leap, and the enthusiasm increased as he approached\r\nthe Presidential stand.  He \"rode up with the light of battle in\r\nhis face,\" holding his hat and his bridle-rein in his left hand,\r\nand saluting with the good sword in his right hand, his eyes fixed\r\nupon his Commander-in-Chief.  His horse, decked with flowers, seemed\r\nto be inspired with the spirit of the occasion, and appeared anxious\r\nto \"keep step to the music of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAfter passing the President, General Sherman wheeled to the left,\r\ndismounted, and joined the reviewing party, where he was greeted\r\nby Governor Dennison.  He shook hands cordially with President\r\nJohnson and General Grant, but when Secretary Stanton advanced with\r\noutstretched hand he remarked, \"I do not care to shake hands with\r\nclerks,\" and turned away.  Never was there a more complete \"cut\r\ndirect\" than was given by the central figure of that grand pageant,\r\nwhose brain and hand had guided this vast multitude of stalwart\r\nbraves, leading them to victory, glory, and final triumph.\r\n\r\nThe troops displayed a fine physique, and had apparently profited\r\nfrom their foraging among the fat turkeys of Georgia.  Their faces\r\nwere finely bronzed, and they marched with a firm, elastic step\r\nthat seemed capable of carrying them straight to Canada, or by a\r\nflank movement to Mexico, in a short space of time.\r\n\r\nAny representation of Sherman's army would have been incomplete\r\nwhich omitted the notorious \"Bummers.\"  At the end of each corps\r\nappeared the strangest huddle of animation, equine, canine, bovine,\r\nand human, that ever civilian beheld--mules, asses, horses, colts,\r\ncows, sheep, pigs, goats, raccoons, chickens, and dogs led by\r\nnegroes blacker then Erebus.  Every beast of burden was loaded to\r\nits capacity with tents, baggage, knapsacks, hampers, panniers,\r\nboxes, valises, kettles, pots, pans, dishes, demijohns, bird-cages,\r\ncradles, mirrors, fiddles, clothing, pickaninnies, and an occasional\r\nblack woman.\r\n\r\nIn effect Sherman gave a sample of his army as it appeared on the\r\nmarch through the Carolinas.  Some of the negroes appeared to have\r\nthree days' rations in their ample pouches, and ten days' more on\r\nthe animals they led.  The fraternity was complete; the goats,\r\ndogs, mules, and horses were already veterans in the field, and\r\ntrudged along as if the brute world were nothing but a vast march\r\nwith a daily camp.  Thus were we shown how Sherman was enabled to\r\nlive upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Yours truly\r\n  John A. Logan\r\nJOHN A. LOGAN was born in Jackson County, Illinois, February 9th,\r\n1826; studied and practiced law; was a member of the State Legislature;\r\nwas a Representative from Illinois, 1859-1861; was commissioned in\r\nSeptember, 1861, Colonel of the Thirty-first Illinois Volunteers;\r\nwas promoted to Brigadier-General in 1862, and Major-General in\r\n1863, especially distinguishing himself at Belmont, Fort Donelson,\r\nPittsburgh Landing, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and as commander\r\nof the Army of the Tennessee; was Congressman-at-Large from Illinois,\r\n1867-1871; was United States Senator from Illinois, 1871-1877,\r\nagain in 1883, and was re-elected in 1885, for six years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nPRESIDENT JOHNSON SURRENDERS.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson was by nature and temperament squarely disposed\r\ntoward justice and the right, but he could not resist the concerted\r\nappeals made to him by the dominant whites at the South.  Early in\r\nMay, rules were issued governing trade with the States lately in\r\nrebellion, but in June these restrictions were removed, and there\r\nrapidly followed executive orders restoring Virginia to her federal\r\nrelations, establishing provisional governments in the Southern\r\nStates, and granting a general amnesty to all persons engaged in\r\nthe Rebellion, except certain classes, who could receive pardon by\r\nspecial application.  These acts speedily alienated the President\r\nfrom the party whose votes elected him, but he was always \"sure he\r\nwas right, even in his errors.\"\r\n\r\nAndrew Johnson's daily life as President was a very simple one.\r\nHe arose promptly at six o'clock in the morning, read the newspapers,\r\nand breakfasted with his family at eight.  Going into the executive\r\noffice at nine, he remained there until four in the afternoon,\r\ndevoting himself to conferences with Cabinet officers, his official\r\ncorrespondence, and the reception of visitors when he had leisure.\r\nAt four o'clock he went into his family sitting-room, dined at\r\nfive, and after dinner took a walk or a carriage-drive.  From nine\r\nuntil eleven he received visitors, and then retired for the night.\r\nHe had a few favorites who went into his room without being\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nProminent among them was Mr. S. P. Hanscom, of Massachusetts, who\r\nhad been in early life a prominent Abolitionist and temperance\r\nlecturer.  During the Johnson Administration Mr. Hanscom edited\r\nthe Washington _Republican_, and obtained office for applicants\r\nfor a pecuniary consideration.  When Mr. Buffington refused to pay\r\nthe stipulated fee for his appointment, Mr. Hanscom published a\r\nhandbill, in which he unblushingly related the circumstances and\r\ndenounced the ex-Congressman for breach of faith.  Mr. Hanscom\r\nspent the large income which he received for office brokerage very\r\nfreely.  He was kind to the poor and a generous friend, but he\r\ndied a few years afterward in reduced circumstances.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, the leader of the conquered Confederacy, had been\r\nbrought from Georgia, where he was captured, and imprisoned at\r\nFortress Monroe.  He occupied the inner apartment of a casemate,\r\nwith a guard in the outer apartment and sentries posted on the\r\noutside at the porthole and at the door.  He became naturally\r\nsomewhat irascible, and orders having been sent to put him in irons\r\nif he gave any provocation, he one day gave it by throwing a tin\r\nplate of food which he did not fancy into the face of the soldier\r\nwho had served him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Titlow, who was especially charged with the custody of Mr.\r\nDavis, and who is the authority for this statement, was accordingly\r\nordered by the Commandant of the fort to place his prisoner in\r\nirons.  Summoning a blacksmith who was in the habit of riveting\r\nirons on soldiers sentenced by court-martial to wear them, the\r\nCaptain went to the casemate, accompanied by the blacksmith carrying\r\nthe fetters and his tools.  They found Mr. Davis seated on his cot,\r\nthere being no other furniture besides but a stool and a few articles\r\nof tinware.  When he glanced at the blacksmith and comprehended\r\nthe situation, he exclaimed:  \"My God! this indignity to be put on\r\nme!  Not while I have life.\"  At first he pleaded for opportunity\r\nto inquire of Secretary Stanton.  Then his excitement rose to fury\r\nas he walked the cell, venting himself in almost incoherent ravings.\r\nThe Captain at length calmly reminded him that as a soldier he must\r\nbe aware that however disagreeable the duty assigned, it must be\r\nperformed, and that, as in duty bound, he should perform it.\r\n\r\n\"None but a dog would obey such orders,\" replied Mr. Davis,\r\nemphasizing his determination never to be manacled alive by grasping\r\nthe stool and aiming a very vicious blow.  The sentries rushed\r\nforward to disarm him, but were ordered back into their places.\r\nCaptain Titlow explained that such demonstrations of self-defense\r\nwere foolish and useless, and that it would be much better for Mr.\r\nDavis to submit to the inevitable necessity.  But while receiving\r\nthis advice, Davis took the opportunity of grasping the musket of\r\none of the sentries, and in the furious endeavor to wrest it from\r\nhim, quite a scuffle ensued.\r\n\r\nThat ended, the Captain took the precaution of clapping his hand\r\non his sword-hilt, as he perceived Mr. Davis' eye was upon it, and\r\nat once ordered the corporal of the guard to send into the casemate\r\nfour of his strongest men without side arms, as he feared they\r\nmight get into the wrong possession and cause damage.  They were\r\nordered to take the prisoner as gently as possible, and, using no\r\nunnecessary force, to lay him upon the cot and there hold him down.\r\nIt proved about as much as four men could do, the writhings and\r\nupheavings of the infuriated man developing the strength of a\r\nmaniac, until it culminated in sheer exhaustion.  When the unhappy\r\ntask was done Mr. Davis, after lying still for awhile, raised\r\nhimself and sat on the side of the bed.\r\n\r\nAs his feet touched the floor and the chain clanked he was utterly\r\novercome; the tears burst out in a flood.  When he became calm he\r\napologized in a manly way to the Captain for the needless trouble\r\nhe had caused him, and they afterward maintained mutual relations\r\nof personal esteem and friendliness.  The indignity had, however,\r\nsuch an effect upon Mr. Davis that the physician called in insisted\r\non the removal of the irons.  Permission to do this was reluctantly\r\nobtained from Washington, and the same man who had put on the\r\nfetters took them off.\r\n\r\nThis act did much to restore the deposed leader of the Rebellion\r\nto the foremost place, which he had forfeited, in the hearts of\r\nthose who had rebelled.   The imperious manner in which Mr. Davis\r\nhad dictated the military operations of the Confederacy, placing\r\nhis personal favorites in command, and his inglorious flight from\r\nRichmond, which was burned and plundered by the Confederates, while\r\nthe fugitive \"President\" carried away a large sum in gold, had\r\nincreased the feeling of dissatisfaction which had always existed\r\nin \"Dixie\" with Mr. Davis.  But when he was ironed and otherwise\r\nsubjected to harsh treatment, the Southern heart was touched, and\r\nevery white man, woman, and child felt that they were, through him,\r\nthus harshly dealt with.  The manacling of Mr. Davis delayed the\r\nwork of reconstruction for years, and did much to restore the\r\nfeeling of sectional hatred which fair fighting had overcome.\r\n\r\nJohn Pierpont, the veteran parson-poet, came to Washington as the\r\nchaplain to Henry Wilson's regiment, but he found himself unable\r\nto endure the hardships of camp life, and Senator Sherman obtained\r\na clerkship in the Treasury for him.  When he reached his eightieth\r\nbirthday, in 1866, he was told in the evening that a few friends\r\nhad called, and on entering the parlor to greet them he was entirely\r\nsurprised.  One presented him with a gold watch, another with a\r\nvaluable cane, and another with a large photograph-album containing\r\nthe portraits of old Boston friends and parishioners.  But the most\r\nvaluable gift was a large portfolio filled with autograph letters\r\nof congratulation in poetry and prose from Sumner, Wilson, Mr.\r\nSigourney, Whittier, Wood, Dana, Holmes, Whipple, and other prominent\r\nauthors, with other letters signed Moses Williams, Gardner Brewer,\r\nWilliam W. Clapp, and other \"solid men of Boston.\"  All old\r\ndifferences of opinion were forgotten and due honor was paid to\r\nthe poet, the priest, the emancipationist, and the temperance\r\nreformer of \"Auld Lang Syne.\"\r\n\r\nThose who were encouraging the President in his opposition to the\r\nreconstruction policy of Congress, with others who had received or\r\nwho expected to obtain Federal offices, got up at Philadelphia what\r\nwas known as the \"Bread and Butter Convention,\" at which the Union\r\n\"as it was\" was advocated.  Soon afterward, President Johnson with\r\nSecretaries Seward and Welles, with General Grant and others, set\r\nout for Chicago to attend the ceremonies of laying the corner-stone\r\nof the monument to Stephen A. Douglas.  It was this political\r\npilgrimage that gave rise to the well-known expression, \"swinging\r\nround the circle.\"  The President spoke very freely of his policy\r\nin the different places on the route, openly denouncing Congress\r\nand saying many things that were decidedly inconsistent with the\r\ndignity of his position, and unquestionably injurious to him.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner was married at Boston on the 17th of October, 1866,\r\nby Bishop Eastman, to Mrs. Alice Hooper, a daughter of Jonathan\r\nMason and the widow of Samuel Sturges Hooper, only son of Representative\r\nSam Hooper.  Mr. Sumner was then in the fifty-sixth year of his\r\nage, and had never before been a victim to the tender passion.\r\nAlmost every day through the preceding session Mrs. Hooper had\r\noccupied a seat in the gallery directly behind him, and had appeared\r\nengrossed in his words and actions.  They saw a good deal of each\r\nother at Mrs. Hooper's, where Mr. Sumner became a daily visitor,\r\nand on the last day of the session he announced his engagement to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nThe newly married couple passed their honeymoon at Newport,\r\naccompanied by the bride's young daughter.  He finished a letter\r\nthere to a friend by quoting from the _Spectator_, and saying:  \"I\r\nshall endeavor to live hereafter suitably to a man in my station,\r\nas a prudent head of a family, a good husband, a careful father\r\n(when it shall so happen), and as your most sincere friend,\r\nC. SUMNER.\"\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom little thought that these dreams of domestic happiness\r\nwould never be realized, and that in a few months his life would\r\nbe embittered by his great family trouble, which the world never\r\nguessed, much less knew, but which turned his love for his wife\r\ninto hatred, and his hopes for handing his name to posterity into\r\nunforgiving anger.  Senator and Mrs. Sumner, when they came to\r\nWashington after their marriage, occupied a handsomely furnished\r\nhouse on I Street.  Mrs. Sumner at once manifested a fondness for\r\n\"society,\" often insisting on remaining at receptions until a late\r\nhour, when he had unfinished Senatorial work on his desk that would\r\nhave to be completed on his return home.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson suffered by his undue kindness to pardon-brokers,\r\nprominent among whom as a good-looking young woman named Mrs. Cobb.\r\nShe was a constant visitor at the White House, and boasted that\r\nshe could obtain pardons in six hours for a proper pecuniary\r\nconsideration.  Detective Baker worked up a fictitious case for\r\nthe purpose of entrapping her.  She agreed, in writing, for three\r\nhundred dollars, to obtain the pardon of a Captain Hine, receiving\r\none hundred dollars cash down, the rest to be paid when the pardon\r\nwas delivered.  After the pardon was signed by President Johnson,\r\nDetective Baker laid the papers before him, upon which the President\r\ngrew very angry, and finally ordered Detective Baker from the White\r\nHouse.  Mrs. Cobb and her friends insisted that it was a \"put-up\"\r\njob, and the Grand Jury indicted Detective Baker, but the case was\r\nnever brought to trial.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1866, Representative James M. Ashley,\r\nof the Toledo district of Ohio, commenced operations as chief\r\nimpeacher of President Johnson.  He had begun life at an early age\r\nas a clerk on a trading-boat on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers,\r\ndriving sharp bargains with the plantation darkies on the banks,\r\nin the exchange of cheap jewelry and gay calicoes for cotton and\r\neggs.  Next he undertook to learn the art and mystery of printing,\r\nstudying law meanwhile, and finally located at Toledo as the editor\r\nof a Democratic paper.  He was not a success as an editor, and went\r\nfrom the sanctum into a drug-store, where he put up prescriptions\r\n\"at all hours of the night.\"  Joining the Republican party in its\r\ninfancy, he obtained an election to Congress, but failed to create\r\nany sensation until he mounted the hobby of impeachment, which\r\nenabled him to advertise himself extensively, and without expense.\r\nHe was a rather short, fat man, with a clean-shaven face, and a\r\nlarge shock of bushy, light hair, which he kept hanging over his\r\nforehead like a frowsy bang threatening to obstruct his vision.\r\nHe passed much of his time in perambulating the aisles of the House,\r\nholding short conferences with leading Republicans, and casting\r\nfrequent glances into the ladies' gallery.  A man of the lightest\r\nmental calibre and most insufficient capacity, he constituted\r\nhimself the chief impeacher, and assumed a position that should\r\nhave been held by a strong-nerved, deep-sighted, able man.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court, on the last day of 1866, presented to the Radicals\r\nan unacceptable New Year's present in the shape of a decision on\r\nthe legality of military commissions.  The case was that of Lamden\r\nP. Milligan, who had been sentenced to death, and on whose appeal\r\nfor setting aside his trial there had been a division of opinion\r\nbetween the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for\r\nthe District of Indiana.  The Supreme Court was unanimous in deciding\r\nthat no authority existed in the State of Indiana for the trial of\r\nMilligan by a Military Commission, and that he was entitled to the\r\ndischarge prayed for in his petition, his case coming within the\r\nstrict letter of the law of Congress, passed in 1863, authorizing\r\nthe suspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_.  On the question\r\nwhether Congress had a right to legalize military commissions in\r\nStates where the authority and action of the established courts\r\nwas unimpeded for the trial of civilians, there was a disagreement.\r\nFive of the judges held the affirmative, and four the negative.\r\nThis decision made the leading Radicals very angry, and Thad.\r\nStevens undertook to prepare a bill to remodel the court.  Public\r\nopinion generally rejoiced at the suppression of unjust tribunals\r\n\"organized to convict.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Edwin MStanton\r\n  SecofWar\r\nEDWIN McMASTERS STANTON was born at Steubenville, Ohio, December\r\n19th, 1814; was graduated at Kenyon College in 1834; practiced law\r\nat Steubenville and afterward at Pittsburg; was Attorney-General\r\nunder President Buchanan, December, 1860 - March, 1861; was Secretary\r\nof War under President Lincoln and Johnson, January, 1860 - May,\r\n1868; was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court by\r\nPresident Grant, and the appointment was promptly confirmed by the\r\nSenate, but before the commission was issued he died, December\r\n24th, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nWASHINGTON CELEBRITIES.\r\n\r\nWhen President Johnson occupied the White House he was joined by\r\nthe ladies of his family.  Mrs. Johnson had been an invalid for\r\ntwenty years, and although she could not go into society on account\r\nof her ill-health, her pride was amply gratified in the advancement\r\nof her husband, whom she had taught to read when he was a village\r\ntailor and had won her heart.  Her only appearance in public at\r\nthe White House was at a party given to her grand-children.  She\r\nthen remained seated, and as the young guests were presented to\r\nher she would say, \"My dears, I am an invalid,\" which was fully\r\nproven by her careworn, pale face, and her sunken eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Patterson, the President's eldest daughter, was the wife of\r\nDavid T. Patterson, who was elected United States Senator from\r\nTennessee soon after Mr. Johnson became President.  She had been\r\neducated where so many daughters of the South have been, at the\r\nAcademy of the Visitation in Georgetown, and while her father was\r\nin the Senate she had remained there, spending her weekly holidays\r\nwith President Polk's family in the White House.  There she met\r\nMrs. Madison, the Blairs, Lees, and other old families of Washington,\r\nmany of whom, in later years, gladly welcomed her return to\r\nWashington.  She was thus early introduced into Washington social\r\nlife, and the people who imagined that Andrew Johnson's family were\r\nto prove a millstone about his neck forgot that Martha Patterson\r\nwas his daughter.  When some of the leaders of Washington society\r\nundertook to call at the White House and tender their patronage,\r\nMrs. Patterson quietly remarked to them:  \"We are a plain people\r\nfrom the mountains of East Tennessee, called here for a short time\r\nby a national calamity, but we know our position and shall maintain\r\nit.\"  Mrs. Storer was President Johnson's other daughter, and the\r\nwidowed mother of young children.  A son, Robert Johnson was very\r\ndear to his father, but Mrs. Patterson was his favorite child, as\r\nshe possessed his mental characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn the great struggle which ensued between the President and\r\nCongress, the Senate was really under the leadership of Roscoe\r\nConkling, although Sumner, Fessenden, and Wade, each regarded\r\nhimself as the head of the Republicans in the Upper House.  Mr.\r\nConkling was at that time a type of manly beauty.  Tall, well made,\r\nwith broad shoulders and compact chest and an erect carriage, he\r\nwas always dressed with scrupulous neatness, wearing a dark frock-\r\ncoat, light-colored vest and trousers, with gaiters buttoned over\r\nhis shoes.  His nose was large and prominent, his eyes of a bluish-\r\ngray hue, surmounted by heavy dark auburn eyebrows, his side whiskers\r\ncurled closely, and his hair ran down with a sharp point into the\r\nmiddle of his broad, bald forehead, where it rose in a curl.  His\r\nlanguage was elegant, and when he spoke on the floor every word\r\nwas clearly enunciated, while slow and deliberate gestures lent\r\neffect to what he said.  At times, when his features would light\r\nup with animation, his deep nostrils would quiver and lengthen into\r\nthe expression of scorn, which would often lash an opponent into\r\nfury.  His manner toward strangers was at times dictatorial, but\r\nhis personal friends worshiped him, and they have never thrown off\r\ntheir allegiance.\r\n\r\nOliver P. Morton, the \"War Governor\" of Indiana, entered the Senate\r\nin time to take a prominent part in resisting the arrogant claims\r\nof President Johnson.  He had found it difficult to ascend from\r\nthe vale of poverty, but with indomitable energy he had overcome\r\nall obstacles.  The promptness, the vigor, and thorough manner with\r\nwhich he discussed every question upon which he took hold soon won\r\nhim the respect of his associates, to which was added their sympathy,\r\ncaused by his physical condition.  Possessed of an extraordinary\r\nphysique and an iron constitution, he gradually lost the use of\r\nhis lower limbs without a murmur, and after he was hopelessly\r\ncrippled he moved about on his canes with a herculean effort.  He\r\nspoke with great power, his penetrating eyes flashing with patriotism\r\nas he plead the cause of the emancipated, or flashing with anger\r\nas with withering denunciation and sarcasm he denounced their\r\noppressors.  His mind was especially utilitarian and his speeches\r\nwere more remarkable for common sense than for the flowers of\r\nrhetoric or the brilliancy or oratory.  With indomitable perseverance\r\nand pluck he possessed a large heart, and his charities were freely\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Edmunds, of Vermont, was another Senator who took his\r\nseat in time to participate in the great contest with President\r\nJohnson, in which the fruits of the war were at stake.  He was not\r\na college graduate, yet few men have acquired a broader culture\r\nfrom contact with men and the study of books.  Tall and spare in\r\nfigure, his bald head and flowing white beard gave him a resemblance\r\nto the classic portrait of St. Jerome, but, unlike that portrait,\r\nhis head is dome-shaped, symmetrical, while his temples are wide\r\napart and full between.  He debates a question in a clear, half-\r\nconversational manner, occasionally indulging in a dash of sarcasm\r\nwhich makes those Senators who are the objects of it wince.  What\r\nhe says goes into the _Congressional Record_ without any revision\r\nor correction, although many other members of Congress pass a deal\r\nof time in revising, polishing, and correcting the reports of their\r\nremarks.  Invaluable in opposition and almost irresistible in\r\nassault, Senator Edmunds has always been regarded by the Republicans\r\nin the Senate as their \"tower of strength\" when the political\r\nhorizon was overcast.\r\n\r\nZach Chandler, the merchant-Senator from Michigan, who was attaining\r\nhigh rank in the Republican councils, was justly proud of his\r\nbusiness standing as a dry-goods dealer in Detroit, and he used to\r\nnarrate how, when almost every business man there failed, in 1837,\r\nhe could not see his way clear to the settlement of his own\r\nliabilities.  He made a statement of his affairs, and, taking what\r\nmoney he could raise, went to New York and proposed to his creditors\r\nthere to make an assignment.  His principal creditor said to him:\r\n\"You are too straightforward a man and too honest and enterprising\r\na merchant to go under.  You can take your own time for payment,\r\nand we will furnish you with a new stock of goods.\"  The young\r\nmerchant accepted the extension of time, and, going home, went to\r\nwork again and was soon able to pay all his debts in full.\r\n\r\nSenator Anthony, of Rhode Island, was a model Senator.  Endowed by\r\nnature with a gracious presence, integrity, and good sense, what\r\nhe had to say on any question was always listened to with attention\r\non both sides of the Senate Chamber.  He excelled in the felicitous\r\neulogies which he was called upon to deliver over departed associates.\r\n\"The shaft of Death, Mr. President,\" said he on one of these\r\noccasions, \"has been buried in this Chamber of late with fearful\r\nfrequency, sparing neither eminence nor usefulness nor length of\r\nservice.  No one can predict where it will next strike, whose seat\r\nwill next be vacated.  With our faces to the setting sun, we tread\r\nthe declining path of life, and the shadows lengthen and darken\r\nbehind us.  The good, the wise, the brave fall before our eyes,\r\nbut the Republic survives.  The stream of events flows steadily\r\non, and the agencies that seemed to direct and control its current,\r\nto impel or to restrain its force, sink beneath its surface, which\r\nthey disturb scarcely by a ripple.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Nye, of Nevada--Jim Nye--sat for years at the right hand\r\nof Charles Sumner in the United States Senate, and used to delight\r\nin making comments on what transpired in language that was not\r\nagreeable to the fastidious Senator from Massachusetts, who would\r\nlisten in a stately embarrassment which was delightful to Nye to\r\nwitness, not wishing to show any offense, and yet thoroughly\r\ndisgusted.  Nye wasn't particularly witty in debate, and the speeches\r\nof Proctor Knott, McCreery, or Sam Cox were funnier than his;\r\nneither had he any Senatorial dignity whatever.  He had, in its\r\nplace, a vast store of humor and genial humanity--better articles,\r\nthat brought him in love all that he lost in respect.  He had more\r\nhumor than wit, although many of his good things possessed the\r\nsharp scintillations of the last-mentioned article, as when Horace\r\nGreeley sat down on the Senator's new hat, and Nye, picking up the\r\ncrushed stove-pipe, said, gravely, \"I could have told you it wouldn't\r\nfit before trying it on.\"  He had little or no literary culture,\r\nread few books, and never troubled others with his convictions, if\r\nhe had any, which was doubtful.  He was a Falstaff of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and it could be said of him, as Prince Hal said of his\r\nboon companion, \"We could better spare a better man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Elihu B. Washburne was the \"Father of the House,\" and the man\r\nwho had brought forward General Grant at a time when the Republic\r\nwas sorely in need of such a man.  Thad Stevens ruled the weak-\r\nkneed Republicans with a rod of iron, and never hesitated about\r\nengaging in a political intrigue that would benefit the party, as\r\nhe understood its mission.  Benjamin F. Butler was another power\r\nin the House, who delighted to engage in a debate, with copious\r\ninvective interlinings, and who was more feared on the Republican\r\nside of the House than on the Democratic.  And then there was Oakes\r\nAmes, a blunt, honest man, whose perceptions of right and wrong\r\nwere not cloaked, but who placed his \"Credit Mobilier\" shares \"where\r\nthey would do the most good.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker Colfax presided in\r\nrather a slap-dash-knock-'em-down-auctioneer style, greatly at\r\nvariance with the decorous dignity of his predecessors, and he was\r\never having an eye to the nomination for Vice-President in 1869.\r\nThe most popular man in the House was unquestionably James G.\r\nBlaine, who exercised a fascination over all, and whose occasional\r\nspeeches were marked by their purity of style, their terseness,\r\nand the strength of their arguments.  His then graceful as well as\r\npowerful figure, his strong features, glowing with health, and his\r\nhearty, honest manner, made him an attractive speaker and an esteemed\r\nfriend.  Whatever might be said about some of his railroad\r\nspeculations, no one ever lisped a syllable against his private\r\ncharacter, nor was there in Washington a more devoted husband, a\r\nmore affectionate father, or a kinder friend.\r\n\r\nOnce, when Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, was addressing the House, Mr.\r\nBlaine rose and questioned him concerning the accuracy of his\r\nstatements.  Mr. Tucker's reply implied that he doubted Mr. Blaine's\r\nability to pass correct judgment on legal subjects, as that gentleman\r\nwas not a lawyer.  Blaine's memory enabled him to rejoin by reminding\r\nthe distinguished member from Virginia of some egregious blunder\r\ncommitted by Mr. Tucker when filling the Attorney-Generalship of\r\nthe Old Dominion, and he concluded by saying that if the commission\r\nof such a mistake was the result of being a lawyer, he, at least,\r\ncongratulated himself on not belonging to the legal fraternity.\r\nMr. Tucker thereupon said that his honorable friend from Maine\r\nreminded him of the Pharisee in the parable, apparently thanking\r\nhis Deity for having created him unlike--\"You,\" broke in Mr. Blaine,\r\nwho had seated himself in the semicircle immediately in front of\r\nMr. Tucker's desk.  This telling interruption was greeted with\r\nroars of laughter, which completely drowned further remarks from\r\nthe Virginian, most noted as a constitutional lawyer and as a wit.\r\n\r\nA high tribute to Mr. Blaine's personal ability and popularity was\r\npaid in his election as Speaker of three successive Congresses,\r\ncovering a period from March 4th, 1869, to March 4th, 1875.  On\r\nthe latter date, when by party changes it had become evident that\r\na Democratic Speaker would succeed him, Mr. Blaine made a neat\r\nvaledictory in adjourning the session, and as he declared the\r\nadjournment and dropped his gavel, a scene of tumultuous enthusiasm\r\nensued.  The crowded assemblage, floor and galleries, rose and\r\ngreeted him with repeated salvos of applause, running in waves from\r\nside to side, with almost delirious cheering, clapping of hands,\r\nand waving of handkerchiefs.  Fully five minutes, it seemed, he\r\nwas detained, bowing and acknowledging with emotion, this tribute\r\nto the record he had made, and for full half an hour afterward\r\nthere poured toward his standing place, at the clerk's desk, a\r\nconstant stream of members and citizens anxious to press his hand\r\nand express in words the admiration already shown in signs.  None\r\nwho were there can forget the impression made by this scene.\r\n\r\nFernando Wood, of New York, was the best known man on the Democratic\r\nside of the House, nor was there a bureau official in the War\r\nDepartment who had such a military deportment.  Tall, spare, erect,\r\nwith clothes of faultless fit and closely buttoned to the chin,\r\nhis hair cut short and his face cleanly shaven, with the exception\r\nof a heavy white moustache, he was the beau ideal of a colonel of\r\nthe Old Guard.  His manners were as courtly as were those of Lord\r\nChesterfield, while his features were as immovable and emotionless\r\nas were those of Talleyrand.  In his earlier days \"Fernandy Wud\"\r\nwas identified with the lowest element of New York politics, and\r\nhis political reputation was so unsavory that his own party twice,\r\nwhen opportunity offered, refused to elect him Speaker, a place to\r\nwhich he was entitled by seniority.  On several occasions he was\r\ndenounced virulently in debate, but he stood up \"like a little man\"\r\nand faced his assailants with features as imperturbable as if they\r\nwere carved from marble.  Mr. Wood's ambition was to be chosen\r\nSpeaker when the revolutions of Fortune's wheel would again give\r\nthe Democratic party the ascendency.  This prompted him to entertain\r\nvery liberally, and he used to receive many promises of support,\r\nbut when the caucus was held, he never received over half a dozen\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  HBAnthony\r\nHENRY BOWEN ANTHONY was born at Coventry, Rhode Island, April 1st,\r\n1815; was editor of _The Providence Journal_; was Governor of Rhode\r\nIsland, 1849-1850; was United States Senator, 1859, until his death\r\nat Providence, Rhode Island, September 2d, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nCEREMONIALS AT THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nThe New Year's reception at the White House, at the opening of\r\n1866, was marked by the absence of volunteer officers in uniform,\r\nwho had, since the breaking out of the war, always been present in\r\nlarge numbers.  The East Room was not thrown open, but the suite\r\nof drawing-rooms, which had been re-decorated and newly furnished,\r\nwere much admired.  The traditional colors of scarlet, blue, and\r\ngreen had been preserved, but the walls had been painted with gilt\r\nmoldings, and the furniture was far more elegant than was that\r\nwhich it had replaced.  There was also a profusion of rare flowers\r\nfrom the conservatory.\r\n\r\nThe President received in the Blue Drawing-room, and it was a\r\nsubject of general remark that age and official perplexities were\r\nevidently leaving their traces on his features, but he had lost\r\nnone of his determined, defiant looks.  During the more ceremonious\r\npart of the reception his two daughters stood near him.  Mrs. Stover\r\nwore a rich black silk dress, with a basque of the same material,\r\nboth being embroidered with violet-colored wreaths and trimmed with\r\nbugles.  Mrs. Patterson wore a similar dress and basque, embroidered\r\nin white.  Both ladies wore lace collars and had natural flowers\r\nin their hair.\r\n\r\nThe privileged guests began to arrive at eleven o'clock, the\r\nDiplomatic Corps taking precedence.  They wore the official costumes\r\nof their respective courts, with the exception of Mr. De Romero,\r\nthe Mexican Envoy, who was attired in a plain black suit.  Sir\r\nFrederick Bruce and Mr. De Berthemy, the bachelor representatives\r\nof Great Britain and of France, were naturally objects of attraction\r\nto the ladies.  M. Tassara, the Spanish Minister, and Baron Von\r\nGeroldt, the Prussian Minister, were accompanied by their wives,\r\nas was young M. De Bodisco, who represented Russia as Charge\r\nd'Affaires.  The South Americans were famously bedizened with\r\nembroideries, and nearly all of the Ministers, Secretaries, and\r\nattaches wore the broad ribbons of some order of merit across their\r\nright shoulders, or crosses upon their breasts.  Some of them\r\nsported at least a dozen of these honorary decorations.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet officers with their ladies next entered, and after them\r\ncame the commanding figure of Chief Justice Chase, followed by the\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court and the local Judges.  Members of\r\nCongress came next in order, but there were not many present.\r\nAssistant Secretaries, heads of bureaus, and chief clerks followed;\r\nand then, the band striking up the \"Red, White, and Blue,\" Admiral\r\nRadford entered with a large party of naval officers, among them\r\nAdmirals Davis and Stribling, with Colonel Ziellen and the other\r\nofficers of marines stationed in Washington, all in full uniform.\r\n\r\n\"Hail to the Chief\" announced General Grant, who was attended by\r\nAdjutant-General Thomas, Quartermaster-General Meigs, Paymaster-\r\nGeneral Brice, Surgeon-General Barnes, and some fifty or sixty\r\nofficers of lower grade, all in full uniform, and many of them who\r\nonly performed bureau duty were arrayed in epaulettes and embroidery\r\nof the most stunning description.  This comprised the official\r\npresentations, and many of those above named were accompanied by\r\nladies, elegantly attired in full morning costumes, some of which,\r\nworn by the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps, were very elegant.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock the officials took their leave, and the people\r\nwere admitted.  For two hours did a living tide of humanity surge\r\nthrough the rooms, each man, woman, and child being presented and\r\nshaking hands with the President as they passed him.  There was\r\nalmost every conceivable variety of dress, and every part of the\r\ncountry, with many foreign lands, was represented.  A more promiscuous\r\ncompany had never yet attended a White House reception, than that\r\nwhich gathered on this occasion.  But one colored man sought an\r\nintroduction to the \"Moses\" of his race, and he was civilly treated\r\nby the President and those in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe reception at the house of General Grant was crowded.  Among\r\nthe other visitors was Hon. Sam Hooper, the merchant Representative\r\nfrom Boston, who handed the General a letter signed by himself and\r\nforty-nine other \"solid men of Boston,\" presenting a library of\r\nwell-selected books, which had cost five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft's eulogy on Abraham Lincoln attracted crowds to\r\nthe hall of the House of Representatives.  The occasion was indeed\r\na memorable one, equaled only by the exercises in the old hall on\r\nthe last day of 1834, when that \"Old Man Eloquent\" of Massachusetts,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, occupied nearly three hours in the delivery of\r\nhis grand oration on Lafayette, which covered the history of the\r\npreceding half century.  Henry Clay, who was on that occasion\r\nChairman of the Joint Committee of Arrangements on the part of the\r\nSenate, had ten years before, as Speaker of the House, welcomed\r\nLafayette as the nation's guest.  Mr. Adams, in eloquently alluding\r\nto this impressive scene, said that few of those who received\r\nLafayette were alive to shed the tear of sorrow upon his departure\r\nfrom this earthly scene.  Neither was there a member of Congress\r\nwho joined in the memorial exercises to Lafayette to pay a farewell\r\nto Lincoln.  There were a few present who heard the orator eulogize\r\nJackson, and a few more who were present at the impressive funeral\r\nservices of John Quincy Adams, who had fallen at his post in that\r\nglorious old hall, in which his voice, like that of John the Baptist,\r\nhad proclaimed\r\n\r\n  \"The coming of the glory of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nAn incessant rain did not detract in the least from an immense\r\nattendance at the Capitol, although no one was admitted without a\r\nticket.  Notwithstanding the precautions taken, over three hundred\r\ntickets were issued beyond the utmost capacity of the House galleries,\r\nwhich were literally packed long before the ceremonies commenced.\r\nThe audience, seemingly, was as select as it was large, and the\r\nattendance of many ladies gave to the occasion as brilliant and\r\nfascinating an interest as did the distinguished guests on the\r\nfloor of the House.  The hall was appropriately draped in mourning\r\nover the Speaker's chair and at other points.\r\n\r\nProminent on the front seats of the ladies' gallery were Mrs.\r\nGeneral Grant, Mrs. Patterson and Mrs. Stover (the President's\r\ndaughters), Mrs. Daniel Webster, Mrs. Admiral Dahlgren, and others\r\nequally famed in society.  The floor of the House was divided into\r\nsections for the reception of the distinguished guests.  All of\r\nthe dignitaries were duly announced by the Sergeant-at-Arms as they\r\nappeared in a body at the main door of the hall.  The House rose\r\nin compliment as they entered, and remained standing until the\r\nguests were duly seated.  The Diplomatic Corps, with the exception\r\nof the French Minister and the Mexican Minister, were present in\r\nfull force.  Sir Frederick Bruce, the Spanish Minister, and the\r\nRussian Minister, occupied the front row of seats of the section\r\nassigned to the Diplomatic Corps.  Lieutenant-General Grant sat in\r\ncompany with Admiral Shubrick, in front of the large delegation\r\nfrom the army and navy.  There was a buzz in the hall and a quiet\r\nlaugh as General Butler entered and unconsciously took a seat\r\nimmediately behind General Grant; neither greeted the other.  In\r\nthe rear of General Butler General John A. Logan was sandwiched\r\nwith General Holt and John Minor Botts.\r\n\r\nAt noon Sergeant-at-Arms Ordway entered bearing the official mace,\r\nand he was followed by Mr. Speaker Colfax.  A rap from the Speaker's\r\ngavel brought the assembly to order, and a solemn and very appropriate\r\nprayer was offered by Mr. Chaplain Boynton.  The journal of the\r\nlast day's session was then read, followed by a letter from Secretary\r\nSeward apologizing for his absence.\r\n\r\nThe hum of conversation again echoed around the galleries, with\r\nthe craning of fair necks and the peering of bright, curious eyes\r\nas the ladies sought to see who were there and what was worn.  At\r\nten minutes after twelve the doorkeeper announced the Senate of\r\nthe United States.  Mr. Speaker Colfax repeated the announcement\r\nwith the familiar raps of the gavel, which on this occasion brought\r\nall on the floor to their feet.  Sergeant-at-Arms Brown led the\r\nway, then came Mr. Foster, President _pro tempore_, with Chief\r\nClerk McDonald, and then came the Senators, two and two, who took\r\nseats on either side of the main aisle.\r\n\r\nThe inner half-circle of chairs was as yet unoccupied.  President\r\nFoster, receiving the gavel from Speaker Colfax, said:  \"Please be\r\nseated,\" and a rap was again obeyed.  A few moments elapsed, during\r\nwhich the occupants of the galleries had time to scan the countenances\r\nof the eloquent guardians of the Union and champions of freedom,\r\nwhose voices had been and might again be heard as a battle-cry in\r\nthe dark days of our eventful history.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States was announced, and the audience\r\nrose to receive the Chief Magistrate.  He was attired in simple\r\nblack, and as he passed between the Senators down to the front seat\r\nreserved for him, escorted by Senator Foote, he reminded one of\r\nWebster and of Douglas, so immovable was the expression of his\r\nmassive, resolute, determined features.  The President took his\r\nseat directly opposite the Speaker, and the seats at his right hand\r\nwere occupied by Secretaries McCulloch, Stanton, Welles, Harlan,\r\nPostmaster-General Dennison, and Attorney-General Speed.  Secretary\r\nSeward's health was so precarious that it did not permit him to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft entered with the President and was escorted to the\r\nclerk's table, on which a reading-desk had been placed for his use.\r\nBefore taking his seat he shook hands with President Foster and\r\nMr. Speaker Colfax, who sat side by side at the Speaker's table,\r\ndirectly behind the orator.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court was next announced, and all rose to pay homage\r\nto the majesties of the law.  They wore their silk robes and took\r\nthe front row of seats on the President's left hand in the following\r\norder:  Chief Justice Chase, Justices Wayne, Nelson, Clifford,\r\nSwayne, Miller, Davis, and Fields.  Justice Grier's recent family\r\nbereavement kept him away.\r\n\r\nJust after the Supreme Court was seated the President and Justice\r\nClifford rose, advanced toward each other, and cordially shook\r\nhands.  This made it twenty minutes past twelve, and, as all were\r\npresent, Major French, the Commissioner of Public Buildings, gave\r\na signal, and the Marine Band performed, with impressive effect,\r\nthe _Miserere_, from the opera \"Il Trovatore.\"  The Chaplain of\r\nthe House, Rev. Dr. Boynton, made a most orthodox and righteous\r\nintroductory prayer, after with Hon. Lafayette S. Foster, in a\r\nbrief but eloquent address, introduced the orator of the day.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft was received, on rising, with hearty applause, and he\r\ncommenced the delivery of his address in a clear, loud, and distinct\r\ntone of voice, heard in every part of the hall.  He held his printed\r\naddress in his left hand, and his sincerity and ability compensated\r\nfor the absence of oratorical grace.  His was the simplicity of\r\nfaith rather than the simplicity of art, and by easy and rapid\r\ntransitions it occasionally rose to bold and manly enthusiasm.\r\nThe oration occupied two hours and thirty minutes, and at certain\r\npoints was most rapturously applauded.  The allusions by the orator\r\nto Great Britain's harboring rebel vessels during the war, and to\r\nthe insignificance of Palmerston in comparison to Lincoln, did not\r\nseem to be well received by the British Minister, and his uneasiness\r\nwas very manifest when the House thundered with repeated applause\r\nat the mention of the names of John Bright and Richard Cobden.  On\r\nthe other hand, the Russian Minister blushed at the continued\r\napplause and the thousands of eyes bent on him as Bancroft alluded\r\nto the unwavering sympathy of Russia with the United States during\r\nthe late war.  Baron Stoeckel congratulated the orator after the\r\nceremonies were over.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bancroft had concluded, and the President and the Senate,\r\nwith other invited guests, had retired, Mr. Washburne offered a\r\njoint resolution of thanks to Mr. Bancroft, copied almost _verbatim_\r\nfrom that passed when John Quincy Adams delivered the oration on\r\nLafayette.  When the address was printed Mr. Bancroft insisted on\r\nhaving the title-page state that it had been delivered before \"the\r\nCongress of America,\" instead of \"the Congress of the United States\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Winfd S. Hancock\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT HANCOCK, born near Norristown, Pa., February 14th,\r\n1824; graduated at West Point in 1844; served on the frontier, in\r\nthe Mexican and Florida Wars, and in California; Brigadier-General\r\nof Volunteers, September 23d, 1861; Major-General of Volunteers,\r\nNovember 20th, 1862; commander of Second Corps, May, 1863; wounded\r\nat Gettysburg, July 3d, 1863; returned to his command and fought\r\nto the end of the war; Major-General of the regular army, July,\r\n1866; commanded various military divisions; candidate for Presidency\r\nof the United States, 1880; died at Governor's Island, New York,\r\nFebruary 9th, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE GREAT IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nThe gulf between President Johnson and Congress gradually widened\r\nafter the reconstruction bill was passed over his veto, although\r\nhis friends announced that while he opposed the act and had resisted\r\nits passage, it was the law of the land, and he would fairly execute\r\nit.  He appointed Generals Sheridan, Sickles, and Pope to carry\r\nout its provisions, and he was regarded as an obstinate man\r\npatriotically performing an unpleasant duty.  Then he began to\r\ndoubt, and Attorney-General Stanbery, aided by Judge Jere Black,\r\ndeclared that the Reconstruction Act was not legal, and that the\r\nmilitary commanders at the South were merely policemen.  Congress\r\nmet in midsummer and made the act more stringent in its provisions.\r\nThe President's advisers then counseled him to change those who\r\nwere executing the provisions of the act at the South.  Stanton\r\nwas removed from the War Department and Grant appointed in his\r\nplace, Sheridan was replaced by Hancock, and Sickles and Pope were\r\nrelieved from duty.  When the Senate met, it overruled the deposition\r\nof Mr. Stanton, and General Grant gracefully retired that the \"War\r\nSecretary\" might assume the duties of his office.  This made\r\nPresident Johnson very angry.  He had wanted to use General Grant\r\nas a cat's-paw for keeping Stanton out of the War Department, and\r\nhad hoped at the same time to injure Grant in the estimation of\r\nthe people.  He raised a question of veracity with the General\r\ncommanding, but Congress and the people speedily decided between\r\nthe soldier, whose reputation for veracity was untarnished, and\r\nthe President, who had broken his promises and had betrayed his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Bruce, the British Minister to the United States,\r\ndied suddenly at a hotel in Boston, on the 19th of September, 1867.\r\nHe had been attacked with diphtheria at Narragansett Pier, and had\r\ngone to Boston for medical advice, but he arrived too late.  He\r\nrecognized Senator Sumner, who hastened to his bedside, but was\r\nunable to speak to him.  Sir Frederick was the younger brother of\r\nLord Elgin.  He was born in 1814, was educated at Christ's Church\r\nCollege, Oxford, and subsequently was called to the bar at Lincoln's\r\nInn.  Educated for the diplomatic service, he began his career in\r\nLord Ashburton's suite, when he came to Washington in 1842, on his\r\nspecial mission regarding the north-eastern boundary question.  At\r\nthis time Rufus Choate said of him that he was \"the Corinthian part\r\nof the British Legation.\"  He was then employed in the diplomatic\r\nservice until he was appointed in 1865 to succeed Lord Lyons as\r\nBritish Minister in Washington, and was presented to President\r\nJohnson immediately after the funeral of President Lincoln.  While\r\nin China his official relations with the Hon. Anson Burlingame\r\nripened into personal intimacy, and on the visit of the latter home\r\nthere were reciprocated between these gentlemen the most cordial\r\nexpressions of respect and friendship.  He lived in excellent style\r\nin Washington, was very hospitable to his acquaintances and friends,\r\nwhom he frequently entertained at his well-spread table, and was\r\nnoted for that love of horses which has almost become a passion\r\nwith Englishmen.  To the public in general the deceased wore that\r\nstiff and formal appearance which characterizes the class of his\r\ncountrymen to which he belonged, but in private life he is said to\r\nhave been very social, conversational, and entertaining.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln created an excitement in the autumn of 1867 by offering\r\nfor sale, in a small up-stairs room on Broadway, in New York, what\r\npurported to be her wardrobe while she was at the White House.\r\nLadies who inspected it said that the object of this exhibition\r\ncould not have been to realize money from the sale of the collection.\r\nWith the exception of some lace and camel's-hair shawls, and a few\r\ndiamond rings, there was nothing which any lady could wear, or\r\nwhich would not have been a disgrace to a second-hand clothes shop;\r\nthe dresses--those that had been made up and worn--were crushed,\r\nold-fashioned, and trimmed without taste.  The skirts were too\r\nshort for any but a very short person, and of the commonest muslins,\r\ngrenadines, and bareges; all were made extremely low in the neck,\r\nand could not be available for any purpose.  There were some brocaded\r\nsilk skirts in large, heavy patterns, which had been made but not\r\nworn, but these were unaccompanied by any waists, while the price\r\nput upon them and the other articles was exorbitant.  The opinion\r\nwas that the exhibition was intended to stimulate Congress to make\r\nMrs. Lincoln a large appropriation.  Those Republicans who had\r\nsubscribed to the fund of one hundred thousand dollars paid to Mrs.\r\nLincoln after the death of her lamented husband were very angry.\r\nThe general opinion was that the exhibition was an advertising\r\ndodge which some of Mrs. Lincoln's indiscreet friends had persuaded\r\nher to adopt.\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed created a decided sensation by taking up the cudgels\r\nin defense of his party, and published a letter stating that the\r\nRepublicans, through Congress, \"would have made proper arrangements\r\nfor the maintenance of Mrs. Lincoln had she so deported herself as\r\nto inspire respect.\"  He further intimated \"that no President's\r\nwife ever before accumulated such valuable effects, and that those\r\naccumulations are suggestive of 'fat contracts and corrupt disposal\r\nof patronage.'\"  He continued, that \"eleven of Mr. Lincoln's new\r\nlinen shirts were sold\" almost before the remains, which were\r\nshrouded in the twelfth, had started \"for the bourne from whence\r\nno traveler returns.\"  Not only was Mr. Weed censured in this\r\ncountry, but in England.  The London _Telegraph_ said:  \"To attack\r\nMrs. Lincoln is to insult the illustrious memory of Abraham Lincoln,\r\nand to slander a gentle lady.  Far and wide she has been known as\r\nan admirable and charitable woman, an irreproachable wife, and a\r\ndevoted mother.  She is entitled to more than 'respect' from the\r\nAmerican people.  They owe her reverence for her very name's sake.\r\nIf fifty thousand swords were to have leapt from their scabbards\r\nto avenge the slightest insult offered to Marie Antoinette, a\r\nmillion of American hearts and hands would be quick to relieve the\r\nwants of the widow of the Emancipator; and if this deplorable tale\r\ncould be true, which we decline to believe, the American public\r\nwants no stimulus from abroad to take such an incident at once from\r\nthe evil atmosphere of electioneering, and to deal with the\r\nnecessities of Abraham Lincoln's family in a manner befitting the\r\nnational dignity.\"\r\n\r\nThe impeachment of President Johnson was loudly demanded by Wade,\r\nButler, Thad. Stevens, and other ultra radicals when Congress met\r\nin December, 1867.  \"Why,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"I'll take that man's\r\nrecord, his speeches, and his acts before any impartial jury you\r\ncan get together, and I'll make them pronounce him either a knave\r\nor a fool, without the least trouble.\"  He continued:  \"My own\r\nimpression is that we had better put it on the ground of insanity\r\nor whisky or something of that kind.  I don't want to hurt the\r\nman's feelings by telling him that he is a rascal.  I'd rather put\r\nit mildly, and say he hasn't got off that inauguration drunk yet,\r\nand just let him retire to get sobered.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson, with an equally unfortunate want of reticence,\r\ndenounced Congress, and finally again issued an order removing Mr.\r\nStanton and appointing Adjutant-General Thomas Secretary of War.\r\nSenator Sumner at once telegraphed to Mr. Stanton, \"Stick,\" and\r\nmany believed that a scene of violence would soon be witnessed at\r\nthe War Department.\r\n\r\nWhat did occur, however, was simply ludicrous.  General Thomas went\r\nto Mr. Stanton's office, we are told by Adjutant-General Townsend,\r\nand formally announced that he was Secretary of War, to which Mr.\r\nStanton replied, \"You will attempt to act as Secretary of War at\r\nyour peril.\"  General Thomas then went into General Shriver's room,\r\nand Mr. Stanton soon followed him there.  Resuming the colloquy,\r\nMr. Stanton said, in a laughing tone, to General Thomas:  \"So you\r\nclaim to be here as Secretary of War, and refuse to obey my orders,\r\ndo you?\"  General Thomas replied, seriously, \"I do so claim.  I\r\nshall require the mails of the War Department to be delivered to\r\nme, and shall transact all the business of the Department.\"  Seeing\r\nthat the General looked as if he had had no rest the night before,\r\nMr. Stanton, playfully running his fingers up through the General's\r\nhair, as he wearily leaned back in his chair, said:  \"Well, old\r\nfellow, have you had any breakfast this morning?\"  \"No,\" said\r\nThomas, good-naturedly.  \"Nor anything to drink?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then\r\nyou are as badly off as I am, for I have had neither.\"  Mr. Stanton\r\nthen sent out for some refreshments, and while the two were sharing\r\nthe refection they engaged in very pleasant conversation, in the\r\ncourse of which, however, Mr. Stanton suddenly and with seeming\r\ncarelessness inquired when General Thomas was going to give him\r\nthe report of an inspection, which he had lately made, of the newly\r\ncompleted national cemeteries.  Mr. Stanton said if it was not soon\r\nrendered it would be too late for the printers, and he was anxious\r\nto have it go forth as a credible work of the Department.  The\r\nquestion had apparently no especial point, and General Thomas\r\nevidently saw none, for he answered, pleasantly, that he would work\r\nat the report that night and give it to the Secretary.  \"This struck\r\nme,\" said General Townsend, \"as a lawyer's _ruse_ to make Thomas\r\nacknowledge Stanton's authority as Secretary of War, and that Thomas\r\nwas caught by it.  I some time after asked Mr. Stanton if that was\r\nhis design.  He made no reply, but looked at me with a mock expression\r\nof surprise at my conceiving such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate at once declared that the President had exceeded his\r\nauthority, and the House of Representatives passed a resolution--\r\n126 yeas to 47 nays--that he be impeached for high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.  The House agreed to the articles of impeachment\r\nMarch 3d, 1868, and the Senate received them two days later.  They\r\nspecified his removal of Secretary Stanton, his publicly expressed\r\ncontempt for the Thirty-ninth Congress, and his hindrances to the\r\nexecution of its measures, as acts calling for his impeachment.\r\nThe trial began in the Senate, sitting as a high court of impeachment,\r\non March 23d.  The managers of the trial on the part of the accusation\r\nwere Thaddeus Stevens, B. F. Butler, John H. Bingham, George S.\r\nBoutwell, J. F. Wilson, T. Williams, and John A. Logan, all members\r\nof the House; for the President, appeared Attorney-General Henry\r\nStanbery, Benjamin R. Curtis, Jeremiah S. Black, William M. Evarts,\r\nand Thomas A. R. Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe formulated charges were eleven in number, but only three were\r\nvoted upon, two of these concerning that one item of Secretary\r\nStanton's attempted removal and the other concerning the President's\r\nexpressed contempt of Congress.  The latter charge was based on\r\nlanguage used by Mr. Johnson in a public speech in which Congress\r\nwas characterized as a Congress of only part of the States, and\r\nnot a constitutional Congress, with intent, as was charged, of\r\ndenying that its legislation was obligatory upon him, or that it\r\nhad any power to propose amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe trial from its very inception to a great extent assumed a party\r\ncharacter, the Republican party having strongly condemned the action\r\nand utterances complained of, while the Democratic party approved\r\nand defended them.  On the final issue, however, seven of the\r\nRepublican Senators refused to vote for conviction, and an acquittal\r\nfollowed.  A question of importance on the trial was, whether the\r\nPresident _pro tem._ of the Senate, who in the event of a conviction\r\nwould become President, had a right to vote; but he claimed and\r\nexercised the right.  Many members, however, handled the entire\r\nsubject very delicately, feeling that the precedents were not very\r\nsafe and sure.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Chase presided with great dignity, but the Senators\r\nretained their comfortable arm-chairs, instead of being ranged on\r\na judicial bench, and were often engaged in letter-writing during\r\nthe arguments.  The managers occupied seats at a table on one side\r\nof the area before the table of the presiding officer, and the\r\naccused's counsel had a table on the other side.  Seats were provided\r\nfor the Representatives in the rear of the Senators.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable argument on either side was that of Mr. Evarts,\r\none of the counsel retained by the President's friends, who raised\r\na large sum of money by subscription to secure his acquittal.  Mr.\r\nEvarts was then fifty years of age, and his three days' speech was\r\nan oration rather than an argument.  Tall, slender, with a high,\r\nround head, expressive eyes, and long, slender arms, he spoke\r\nwithout any emotion, continually indulging in fearfully long\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nEven his review of Mr. Manager Boutwell's astronomical proposition\r\nof a \"hole in the sky,\" though it provoked shouts of laughter, was\r\noverdone.  The subject was so good that he kept piling sentence\r\nupon sentence on it, and his phrase, \"the honorable and astronomical\r\nmanager,\" never failed to excite merriment.  Boutwell bore it well,\r\nthough disturbed.  Like other men of logical habit of mind, when\r\nproposing to ornament his production with something imaginative,\r\nhe struck upon the extravagant, and, feeling that he was doing a\r\nfantastic thing, gave rein to fancy.\r\n\r\nAn amusing feature of Mr. Evarts' argument was his illustration of\r\n\"the proprieties of speech, as shown by the official report of the\r\ndebates.\"  He read from the _Congressional Globe_ that Senator\r\nSumner had called Andrew Johnson an \"enemy of his country,\" and\r\nhad been called to order.  Senator Anthony, in the chair, said that\r\nit was usual and proper to call the President an enemy of his\r\ncountry, and Senator Sherman scouted the idea that Senator Sumner\r\nwas out of order, saying that he had heard such language in the\r\nSenate fifty times.  Senators were a good deal amused at this\r\nexhibition of their record.  Then Mr. Evarts turned to the record\r\nof the House as to the propriety of speech, and there was a general\r\nstir and smile, as if to say, \"Here's richness.\"  The celebrated\r\npassage between Bingham and Butler, about murdering Mrs. Surratt,\r\nand Fort Fisher, and the bottle and spoons, was recited, and there\r\nwas almost universal merriment.  Bingham smiled and squirmed,\r\nlooking, when his remarks about Butler were given, both puzzled\r\nand pleased.  Butler had fixed himself in an easy position, his\r\nright elbow upon the manager's table, and his head leaning upon\r\nhis hand, and he was as still as a wooden image until Evarts was\r\nthrough with the matter of decorum.  Members of the House who were\r\npresent, seemed greatly edified, and Garfield and Colfax talked it\r\nover, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\nAt last came the verdict.  The votes on the two articles were taken\r\nMay 16th and 26th, standing, in each case, thirty-five guilty and\r\nnineteen not guilty, which acquitted the President, as a two-thirds\r\nvote is required to convict.  Mr. Stanton at once resigned, and\r\nGeneral Schofield was made Secretary of War.  The fact that had\r\nMr. Johnson been found guilty Mr. Wade would have been President\r\nof the United States doubtless had great weight with several Senators\r\nwho voted \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nWithin thirty minutes after the first vote was taken, which resulted\r\nin acquittal, a Congressional Committee of Inquiry was instituted\r\nby Republicans in regard to the conduct of the disagreeing members\r\nof the Senate.  Witnesses were summoned, and volumes of testimony\r\nwere taken and ingeniously exhausted in the vain endeavor to fix\r\na stain upon a single Senator, but the Committee had to give up\r\nthe matter in disgust, being quite unable to accomplish the ends\r\nthey so zealously pursued.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Mr. Johnson's Presidential career was not especially\r\nnoteworthy.  On the 25th of December, 1868, he issued a full pardon\r\nto everybody who had taken part in the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  J. S. Black\r\nJEREMIAH SULLIVAN BLACK, born in The Glades, Somerset County, Pa.,\r\nJune 10th, 1810; studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1831;\r\nin 1851 was chosen Judge of the Supreme Court of the State, and\r\nbecame its Chief Justice; was Attorney-General under President\r\nBuchanan, 1857-1861; resumed private practice at law; defended\r\nPresident Johnson in the Impeachment trial; died near York, Pa.,\r\nAugust 19th, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nA NEW PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for the selection of a candidate by the\r\nRepublicans, Ohio presented four names.  General Grant, the conqueror\r\nof the Rebellion, who was without experience, qualifications, or\r\ncapacity as a civil ruler, was evidently the choice of the loyal\r\npeople of the North.  The old Abolitionists and the national banks\r\nfavored Chief Justice Chase, who possessed brains, personal dignity,\r\nand ability to perform the duties of the Executive.  Stanton was\r\nthe martyr-candidate of the contractors, an unscrupulous man of\r\naction and decision, bold, audacious, and unshrinking; and the\r\nWestern Reserve brought forward bluff Ben Wade, feigning fanaticism\r\nand stoical virtue, but a mere mouther of strong words and profane\r\nepithets.  A few spoke of a fifth Ohio candidate for the nomination\r\nin General Sheridan, but, \"like a little man,\" he promptly sat down\r\non every demonstration in his behalf.  It soon became evident that\r\nGeneral Grant would be nominated.  State Republican Conventions,\r\nUnion Clubs, and newspapers of all political shades declared their\r\npreferences for him, the New York _Herald_ finally coming out for\r\nthe \"Conqueror of the Rebellion,\" with these lines, by General\r\nHalpine (Miles O'Reilly), as a text.  They afterward became\r\nhistoric:\r\n\r\n  \"So, boys, a final bumper,\r\n   While we all in chorus chant,\r\n   For next President we nominate\r\n   Our own Ulysses Grant.\r\n\r\n  \"And if asked what State he hails from,\r\n   This our sole reply shall be,\r\n   From near Appomattox Court-House,\r\n   And its famous apple tree.\r\n\r\n  \"For 'twas there to our Ulysses\r\n   That Lee gave up the fight;\r\n   Now, boys, to Grant for President,\r\n   And God defend the right.\"\r\n\r\nChief Justice Chase was treated with less favor by another poet,\r\nwho thus described his visit to Ohio to rally his followers:\r\n\r\n  \"Says Salmon P.\r\n   Chase, says he,\r\n  'I'll fish, by Jupiter Ammon!'\r\n   He went to Ohio,\r\n   And threw in his fly--oh!\r\n   But never a sign of a Salmon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice was a prominent candidate for the Democratic\r\nnomination.  His eldest daughter, Mrs. Kate Chase Sprague, was in\r\nNew York when the Democratic Convention was held there, and her\r\nparlor was the head-quarters of her father's friends.  Mr. Frederick\r\nAiken, a lawyer-journalist, who had appeared at the trial of the\r\nconspirators as the defender of Mrs. Surratt, was her master of\r\nceremonies, and introduced the delegates from the rural districts\r\nto Mrs. Sprague, but she failed to capture a majority.  The Chief\r\nJustice saw plainly that the star of Grant was in the ascendant,\r\nand that his life-cherished hope of being President was doomed to\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was very positive in demanding that all officers of\r\nthe Confederate army should enjoy their liberty.  Among those of\r\nthem who had been imprisoned by order of the Secretary of War was\r\nGeneral Clement C. Clay, an ex-United States Senator from Alabama.\r\nHe was taken ill in prison with asthma, and his wife came to\r\nWashington to solicit his release.  She went to President Johnson,\r\nand he gave her the necessary order, which she took back to Secretary\r\nStanton.  Stanton read the order, and, looking her in the face,\r\ntore it up without a word and pitched it into his waste-basket.\r\nThe lady arose and retired without speaking; nor did Stanton speak\r\nto her.  She was filled with despair.  She saw her husband, in whom\r\nher life was wrapped up, dying in prison, and she was unable to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward she was advised to call on General Grant, who\r\nascertained by consulting his roster of the Confederate army that\r\nher husband was a Brigadier-General, and then wrote an order\r\ndirecting his release, under the Appomattox parole, on giving the\r\nrequired bond, and added:  \"I shall see that this order is carried\r\nout.\"  Having signed the order, he gave it to Mrs. Clay, who the\r\nnext day presented it to the Secretary of War.  Mr. Stanton read\r\nit, then touched his bell, and when an officer appeared, handed\r\nhim the order, saying, \"Have that man discharged.\"\r\n\r\nThe extensions of the Treasury Department were completed during\r\nthe Administration of President Johnson under the efficient direction\r\nof Mr. A. B. Mullett, supervising architect.  The entire building\r\nis four hundred and sixty feet long and two hundred and sixty-four\r\nfeet wide.  The new portions are constructed of granite, and the\r\nentire cost of this elegantly finished structure was about eight\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nSenator Ben Wade, of Ohio, as President _pro tempore_ of the Senate,\r\nenjoyed the privilege of appointing the keeper of the Senate\r\nrestaurant.  That establishment, elegantly fitted up in the basement\r\nstory of the Senate wing of the Capitol, brilliantly lighted and\r\nsupplied with coal and ice, was enjoyed rent free by the person\r\nfortunate enough to obtain it.  It was customary, however, for him\r\nto send a good lunch every day to the Vice-President's room without\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nOne day the restauranteur, hearing that he was to be superseded by\r\na caterer from Cincinnati, called on Mr. Wade and said obsequiously,\r\n\"I am the keeper of the Senate restaurant, Senator.\"  \"Oh! yes,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Wade, \"you run the cook-shop down-stairs, don't you?\"\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the reply, with a low bow.  \"Well,\" said Mr. Wade,\r\n\"what can I do for you? what do you want?\"  \"I have called to\r\nexpress my wish, sir, that I may continue to keep the restaurant,\r\nand anything you want, sir, you have only to send a page down-stairs\r\nand it shall be furnished quick as a flash, without costing you a\r\ncent, sir.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Mr. Wade appeared to recollect something, and looking\r\nthe man directly in the eye, said:  \"Oh! I don't want you to feed\r\nme; when I do I will pay you for what I eat, like other people.\r\nBut, listen:  complaint has been made to me that you don't treat\r\nthe little pages fairly or kindly.  They complain that they can't\r\nget anything to eat except expensive things, for which they have\r\nto pay a large price.  Now, sir, just remember that these pages\r\nare our boys, and you had better overcharge Senators, who are able\r\nto pay, than these little chaps, who want to save all of their\r\nwages that they can for their mothers.  You must be civil and kind\r\nto these pages, sir, or I'll have you moved out of your cook-shop\r\nand put in some one there who will treat the boys well.\"  The\r\nrestauranteur promised that he would do so, and bowed his way out.\r\nMr. Wade after this made inquiry of the pages from time to time,\r\nand found that they were civilly treated, and that lunches of\r\nreasonable cost were provided for them.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's enemies circulated a statement that his great speech\r\non Alaska was prepared at the Department of State, and there\r\npublished at Government expense.  This was an unmitigated falsehood.\r\nMr. Sumner obtained the materials for his speech by a careful\r\nexamination of all the available works in the Congressional and\r\nother libraries at Washington in which reference is made to Alaska,\r\nand by conversing with officers of the navy and of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution who had been there.  Everything supplied from the\r\nDepartment of State was a brief correspondence between Mr. Stoeckel\r\nand Secretary Seward, which made a quarter of a printed page.  Mr.\r\nSumner's speech, written in his own hand, made nearly one hundred\r\nfoolscap pages, and the manuscript, which he gave me, is now in my\r\ncollection of autographs.  He had it printed at the _Congressional\r\nGlobe_ office at his own expense, and an expensive job it was.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Seward asked and received permission to have a\r\nsmall extra edition struck off, before the type was distributed,\r\nfor the use of the Department of State, and with these copies was\r\nbound a coast survey chart, for which Mr. Sumner had supplied much\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, although at times annoyed by his relations with the\r\nPresident, passed the happiest period of his eventful life at\r\nWashington during the Johnson Administration.  He occupied a large\r\nhouse which had been built by Judge Douglas, in what was known as\r\nMinnesota Row.  A devoted wife, Mrs. Grant was also an affectionate\r\nmother, and the happy pair enjoyed the society of their children\r\nas they grew up.  Fred, the eldest son, who had shared some of his\r\nfather's later campaigns, was being prepared for admission to West\r\nPoint.  The General's pet was his only daughter, Nellie, who was\r\nbright and beautiful, and whose girlish prattle was far more\r\nattractive to him than the compliments of Congressmen or the praises\r\nof politicians.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant used generally to walk to and from his \"head-quarters,\"\r\nwhich were in a two-story house on Seventeenth Street, opposite\r\nthe War Department, and he was often seen trudging along on a stormy\r\nday, his only protection from the rain being an army cloak and a\r\nslouch hat.  There was nothing to indicate that he was the Commander-\r\nin-Chief of the army, and he was always alone in the morning when\r\nhe went to the Department.  His route was through I Street to\r\nMassachusetts and New York Avenues, to Fifteenth Street, and thence\r\nby the broad-flagged pavement on Pennsylvania Avenue to the War\r\nDepartment.  Even the children along this route knew General Grant,\r\nand would frequently salute him as he passed, silently smoking his\r\ncigar.  General Grant was very fond of walking about Washington,\r\nand even after he became President nothing was more agreeable to\r\nhim than a stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue.  Frequently in these\r\nwalks he would meet going in an opposite direction Sir Edward\r\nThornton, then the British Minister.  Sir Edward was a good\r\npedestrian, and took long strolls every day, and would go springing\r\nalong like a boy out for a holiday.  On the other hand, General\r\nGrant walked slowly and deliberately, and would invariably return\r\nevery salutation, no matter how humble the person saluting might be.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's evening receptions at his house on Minnesota Row\r\nwere the social feature of Washington.  Cabinet officers, diplomatists,\r\nJudges, Congressmen, officers of the army and navy, residents, and\r\nthe strangers within their gates made up the throng that good-\r\nhumoredly jostled and crowded each other in futile attempts to move\r\nthrough the parlors and hall.  When General Grant had issued cards\r\nof invitation to his first reception, hundreds who had received\r\nnone went, all the same, so he afterward announced through the\r\nnewspapers that he would be \"happy to see his friends.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant received all those who could get near him in his\r\nusual stoical manner, his eyes lighting up when he took an old\r\nfriend or comrade by the hand.  He wore his undress uniform, with\r\nthe four golden stars glistening on his shoulder-straps, while Mrs.\r\nGrant, who stood at his side, wore a plain, high-necked, long-\r\nsleeved, pink silk gown, with a Honiton black lace shawl thrown\r\nover her shoulders.  The wives of Senators Chandler and Morgan vied\r\nwith each other in the richness of their toilets and the splendor\r\nof their diamonds, but the observed of all observers was Mrs.\r\nCharles Sumner, on the Senator's arm, wearing a becoming dress of\r\nblack velvet, with a white lace shawl, and a flexible golden serpent\r\nwoven among her dark tresses.\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward hovered around the host nearly all the evening,\r\nanxious to conciliate him and to secure his support of \"our\r\nAdministration.\"  Mr. Speaker Colfax was in excellent spirits, and\r\nso were the scores of Congressmen and placemen present, each one\r\nanxious to say a word to the next President.  Lieutenant-General\r\nSherman was grim and epigrammatic, while Generals Sheridan and Ord\r\nappeared delighted at their deliverance from the troublesome duties\r\nof reconstruction, and there was much soldier-talk among the many\r\nbrave men present who had stood shoulder to shoulder on hard-fought\r\nfields.  Receptions were given by President Johnson, Speaker Colfax,\r\nChief Justice Chase, Governor Morgan, Admiral Dalhgren, and other\r\ndignitaries, but those at the house of General Grant eclipsed them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. Sam Ward began to operate in the lobby at Washington toward\r\nthe close of the war.  He was a short, compactly built, round-headed\r\ngentleman, well educated, with an inexhaustible fund of anecdote\r\nand great gastronomic knowledge, which enabled him to give marvelously\r\ngood dinners.  Besides all this, he was a \"good witness,\" and\r\nconsequently a reliable friend.  He said of himself, just after\r\nbeing examined by General Butler, during the Andrew Johnson\r\nimpeachment investigation, that he had \"been before that d----d\r\nstrabismal inquisition, and that his evidence wasn't worth half\r\nhis mileage.\"  It should be known that his mileage was twenty cents,\r\nten cents per mile each way from Willard's Hotel to the Capitol,\r\nand that, as his street-car fare only cost him twelve, he sent\r\neight cents to the Treasury as conscience money.  So powerful a\r\nlegislative manipulator was Mr. Ward that he claimed for himself\r\nthe title, \"King of the Lobby,\" nor was his claim seriously\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens again came to Washington to lecture during President\r\nJohnson's last official winter.  He had rooms at Welcker's restaurant\r\non Fifteenth Street.  He used to walk out every fine day, accompanied\r\nby his friend and adviser, Mr. Osgood, the Boston publisher, and\r\nMr. Dolby, his financial agent.  They would often tramp eight or\r\nten miles before dinner.  Simon Hanscom, the journalist, secured\r\nhim an interview with President Johnson, who impressed him, as he\r\nafterward wrote, as \"a man of very remarkable appearance--indeed,\r\nof tremendous firmness of purpose, not to be trifled with.\"  The\r\nonly invitation to dine that he accepted was one from Senator\r\nSumner, on a Sunday afternoon, when Secretary Stanton was in the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, as elsewhere, Mr. Dickens' lectures and readings\r\nwere to him a mine of pecuniary profit, and to hundreds of the most\r\nintelligent and cultured citizens of the metropolis they furnished\r\na treat of the highest intellectual character.  His audiences were\r\nsuch as must have highly flattered him, and his entertainments were\r\nsuch as greatly delighted him.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Charles Sumner\r\nCHARLES SUMNER was born at Boston, Massachusetts, January 6th,\r\n1811; received a classical education, graduating at the Cambridge\r\nLaw School in 1834; practiced in Boston; traveled in Europe 1837-\r\n1840; was United States Senator from Massachusetts from December\r\n1st, 1851, until his death at Washington City, March 11th, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nGENERAL GRANT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, having been elected President by a majority of nearly\r\none million and a-half of votes, was inaugurated on Thursday, the\r\n4th of March, 1869.  The national metropolis was crowded with those\r\nwho had come to witness the historic event, many of them veterans\r\nwho rejoiced in the elevation of their Old Commander to the highest\r\ncivic office in the gift of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe military escort was composed of regulars and volunteers, several\r\ncompanies of the latter being colored men.  Then came President\r\nJohnson and the President-elect in an open landau, drawn by four\r\nwhite horses, Mr. Johnson looking soured and sad, while General\r\nGrant, displaying no signs of elation, waved his hat in response\r\nto the cheers with which he was greeted all the way from the White\r\nHouse to the Capitol.  Next came the Vice-President-elect, Mr.\r\nColfax, in a carriage with a member of the Senatorial Committee of\r\nArrangements, and the civic associations followed.  There were the\r\nTanners, the Invincibles, the Wide Awakes, the Grant and Colfax\r\nClubs, and the Colored Republicans, each organization with its\r\nband, its banners, and its badges.  The Washington Fire Department,\r\ntheir brightly polished engines drawn by spirited horses, brought\r\nup the rear.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Capitol, the President and President-elect and\r\nthe Vice-President-elect were escorted to the Senate Chamber, where,\r\nfour years previously, Mr. Johnson had disgraced himself by his\r\ndrunken harangue.  The Supreme Court was already there, with the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, gorgeously arrayed in their court costumes, and\r\na number of prominent army and navy officers in full uniform.  In\r\nthe galleries were ladies gayly dressed, whose opera-glasses had\r\nbeen turned on the distinguished personages below as they had\r\nsuccessively entered, and who kept up such a buzzing chat that it\r\nwas almost impossible for the Senators to transact the closing\r\nbusiness of the expiring session.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock Mr. Colfax was sworn in as Vice-President, and\r\nafterward administered the oath to the new Senators.  Some of those\r\napplying, however, had served in the Confederate army, and were\r\nnot able to take what was known as the \"iron-clad oath.\"  A procession\r\nwas then formed of those present on the floor of the Senate, which\r\nmoved through the rotunda to the east front of the Capitol, where\r\nthe President-elect was hailed by hearty cheers.  He advanced to\r\nthe front of the platform, and the oath of office was administered\r\nby Chief Justice Chase, followed by an artillery salute from a\r\nlight battery near by, while the whistles of the steam fire-engines\r\njoined in the clangor, the band played, and thousands of voices\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nWhen silence was restored, President Grant drew from his coat pocket\r\nsix or seven pages of foolscap, adjusted his glasses, and with\r\ngreat deliberation read in a conversational tone his message to\r\nthe citizens of the Republic and to the world, a plain, practical,\r\ncommon-sense document, in which he declared that he should on all\r\nsubjects have a policy of his own to recommend, but none to enforce\r\nagainst the will of the people.  Soon after he began to read his\r\nmessage his little daughter, somewhat alarmed by the clamor and\r\nthe throng, ran from her mother to his side, and took hold of his\r\nhand, which she held until a chair was placed for her, when she\r\nsat down, seemingly assured that no harm could reach her.  When\r\nthe President had concluded he shook hands with his wife, and\r\nafterward received the congratulations of many official and unofficial\r\npersons, who crowded around and greeted him, before he could return\r\nto his carriage and start, escorted as when he came, to the White\r\nHouse.  The interest taken in this occasion by the President's old\r\ncomrades in arms was something wonderful.  Every soldier hailed\r\nhis election as a compliment to the army.\r\n\r\nThat night General Grant and wife attended the inauguration ball,\r\nwhich was held in the north wing of the new Treasury Department,\r\nthen just completed.  There was a great crowd, and the single flight\r\nof stairs proved insufficient for those who wished to pass up or\r\ndown, causing great dissatisfaction, especially on the part of\r\nHorace Greeley and others, who found that the best hats and coats\r\nhad been taken from the improvised cloak-rooms early in the evening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had kept the formation of his Cabinet a profound\r\nsecret, and their names were not known until he sent their nominations\r\nto the Senate on the day after his inauguration.  The nomination\r\nof Elihu B. Washburne, of Illinois, as Secretary of State, created\r\nsome surprise, as it had been understood that he was to be sent to\r\nFrance as Minister Plenipotentiary.  It was soon known, however,\r\nthat Mr. Washburne only desired to preside over the Department of\r\nState for a few days, ostensibly for the prestige it would give\r\nhim in diplomatic circles abroad, but really that he might appoint\r\nsome of his political henchmen to profitable consulates.  At the\r\nend of six days' service, Mr. Hamilton Fish was nominated and\r\nconfirmed as his successor.  Mr. Fish was of orthodox Knickerbocker\r\nstock, and the services of his father, Colonel Nicholas Fish, gave\r\nhim a hereditary right to belong to the Society of the Cincinnati,\r\nover the central organization of which he presided as Captain-\r\nGeneral.  He had served acceptably in the United States Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives, and as a War Governor of the State of\r\nNew York he had displayed considerable executive talent.  He was\r\nrather a large, British-looking man, with leg-of-mutton side-\r\nwhiskers, a stout nose, and a pleasant expression of countenance,\r\nespecially when he was chuckling over his success in humbugging\r\nsome verdant news-gatherer on diplomatic matters.\r\n\r\nIt was the especial social duty of Secretary Fish to entertain the\r\nforeign diplomats in Washington, to settle their little disputes\r\non questions of etiquette, and to make them reasonably happy.\r\nEvery winter he dined and wined them, and, although his dining-room\r\nin the Morgan House was of goodly size, he was forced to make a\r\nthree days' job of it.  So on Monday he had the Envoys Extraordinary,\r\non Tuesday the Ministers Resident, and on Wednesday the Charge\r\nd'Affaires, with a few personal friends to fill up the gaps.  The\r\nSenate and House Foreign Committees were next entertained at dinner,\r\nand then the leading members of either House expected to put their\r\nCongressional legs under the Fish mahogany.  Meanwhile Mrs. and\r\nMiss Fish had to go the grand rounds to leave their cards on the\r\nwives and daughters of Senators and Representatives, and to be \"at\r\nhome\" every Wednesday to receive visits from them and the rest of\r\nsociety in turn.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State is considered the \"Premier\" of the\r\nAdministration, but General Grant regarded the Secretaryship of\r\nthe Treasury as the most important position in his Cabinet.  The\r\nRepublic was at peace with other nations, and the military and\r\nnaval forces, which had grown to such enormous proportions during\r\nthe war, had been economically reduced, but the Treasury was an\r\nimmense, overgrown organization, with its collections of customs\r\nand of internal revenue duties, its issues of interest-bearing\r\nbonds and of national bank-notes, the coinage of money, the revenue\r\nmarine service, the coast survey, and the life-saving stations,\r\nall of which had been expanded during the war until the clerks and\r\nemployees were numbered by thousands.  General Grant wished to\r\nplace at the head of this establishment a business man who could\r\nprune off its excrescences and reform its abuses.  The place was\r\noffered to the millionaire merchant, Mr. A. T. Stewart, of New\r\nYork, who accepted it with pleasure, and at once had a suite of\r\nrooms in the Ebbitt House, with a private entrance, fitted up for\r\nhis occupancy until he could go to housekeeping.  A few days before\r\nthe 4th of March he came to Washington and occupied these rooms,\r\nwith Judge Hilton as his companion and adviser.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the inauguration Mr. Stewart was nominated by\r\nGeneral Grant, but Senator Sumner, who had not been consulted as\r\nto the formation of the Cabinet, interposed his objection to the\r\nimmediate consideration of Mr. Stewart's nomination.  Late in the\r\nafternoon of that day a rumor got abroad that there was a law,\r\nunderstood really to have been written by Alexander Hamilton while\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, prohibiting an importer in active business\r\nfrom holding the position of Secretary of the Treasury.  A newspaper\r\ncorrespondent obtained this law and carried to General Butterfield,\r\nwho conveyed it to Mr. Stewart and his legal adviser, Judge Hilton.\r\nThey consulted Chief Justice Chase, and he confirmed the view which\r\nhad been taken of the law by those who first brought it to Mr.\r\nStewart's attention.  Mr. Stewart then proposed to retire from\r\nbusiness and devote the entire profits that might accrue during\r\nthe time that he should hold the office of Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto charitable objects.  But this was decided to be something which\r\nwould not be proper either for him to carry out or for the Government\r\nto accept.\r\n\r\nImmediately after seeing Chief Justice Chase, Mr. Stewart and Judge\r\nHilton drove to the White House, and laid the facts and the opinions\r\nbefore the President, who, on the next day, wrote a message to the\r\nSenate asking that the law of 1788 be set aside so as to enable\r\nthe candidate to hold the office.  This the Senate declined to do.\r\nIt was a very natural ambition for a man of Mr. Stewart's tastes\r\nand training to desire to be at the head of the Treasury, and it\r\nis not unlikely that the disappointment was a very severe one.\r\nThis was the beginning of the \"unpleasantness\" between President\r\nGrant and Senator Sumner, which finally resulted in open rupture.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in not having the services of Mr. Stewart, General\r\nGrant appointed George S. Boutwell, ex-Governor of Massachusetts,\r\nwho had had great legislative experience, as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury; General John A. Rawlins, who had been his chief of staff\r\nand military adviser, was made Secretary of War; Adolph E. Borie,\r\na retired Philadelphia merchant, Secretary of the Navy; J. D. Cox,\r\nan Ohio lawyer, with a good military record, Secretary of the\r\nInterior; John A. J. Creswell, an ex-Senator from Maryland, Postmaster-\r\nGeneral, and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, a gifted Massachusetts lawyer,\r\nendowed with keen wit, but possessed of most unpopular manners,\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet was regarded as a strong one.  In Congress, Vice-\r\nPresident Colfax presided over the Senate, and James G. Blaine was\r\nSpeaker of the House.  Every State was again represented, and the\r\nRepublican Administration had the support of a decided majority at\r\neither end of the Capitol.  It was hoped by the Republicans that\r\ntheir party was about to enter upon a new career of usefulness.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant carried with him into the White House his army habits\r\nof regularity and two of his staff officers, Generals Porter and\r\nBabcock.  He used to rise in the morning about seven o'clock, read\r\nthe Washington papers, and breakfast at half-past eight with his\r\nfamily.  He would then light a cigar and take a short stroll,\r\nwalking slowly, with his left hand behind him, and sometimes holding\r\nhis cigar in his right hand.  Ten o'clock found him in his office,\r\nready for the reception of visitors and the transaction of executive\r\nbusiness.  On Thursdays and Fridays the Cabinet met, and members\r\nof Congress always had precedence over other visitors.  He would\r\nlisten attentively to all that was said to him by those who called,\r\nbut he was silent or non-committal in his replies.  As the day\r\nadvanced his secretaries would bring him letters which required\r\nanswers, and would receive instructions as to what replies should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the official business of the day was ended, and\r\nGeneral Grant almost invariably visited the White House stables,\r\nfor he was very fond of his horses.  Among them were \"Cincinnatus,\"\r\nhis dark bay charger; \"St. Louis\" and \"Egypt,\" two carriage-horses\r\nof fine action; a buggy horse named \"Julia;\" Master Jesse's Shetland\r\nponies, \"Billy Button\" and \"Reb;\" \"Jeff Davis,\" a natural pacer;\r\n\"Mary,\" Miss Nellie's saddle-horse; \"Jennie,\" a brood mare, and\r\nthree Hambletonian colts.  Five vehicles were in the carriage house\r\n--a landau, a barouche, a light road-wagon, a top-buggy, and a pony-\r\nphaeton for the children.\r\n\r\nFrom the stable, if the weather was pleasant and the walking good,\r\nGeneral Grant would often take a stroll along the north sidewalk\r\nof Pennsylvania Avenue, occasionally stopping to exchange a few\r\nwords with an old comrade.  He returned all salutations, as had\r\nbeen his custom before becoming Chief Magistrate, and always lifted\r\nhis hat when bowing to lady acquaintances.\r\n\r\nDinner was served at the White House promptly at five o'clock, and\r\nevery member of the family was expected to be punctual.  General\r\nGrant's favorite dishes were rare roast beef, boiled hominy, and\r\nwheaten bread, but he was always a light eater.  Pleasant chat\r\nenlivened the meal, with Master Jesse as the humorist, while Grandpa\r\nDent would occasionally indulge in some conservative growls against\r\nthe progress being made by the colored race.  After coffee, the\r\nGeneral would light another cigar and smoke while he glanced over\r\nthe New York papers.  About nine o'clock, a few chosen friends\r\nwould often call, sometimes by appointment, but business matters\r\nwere generally forbidden, and offices were not to be mentioned.\r\nThe children retired at nine o'clock, Mrs. Grant followed them\r\nabout ten, and between ten and eleven General Grant sought his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  U. S. Grant\r\nULYSSES S. GRANT was born at Point Pleasant, Clermont County, Ohio,\r\nApril 27th, 1822; graduated from the Military Academy at West Point\r\nin 1843, and was commissioned as a Brevet Second Lieutenant in the\r\nFourth United States Infantry; served in the Mexican war, receiving\r\nthe brevets of First Lieutenant and Captain; resigned his commission\r\nin 1854; carried on a farm near St. Louis; was commissioned Colonel\r\nof the Twenty-first Regiment of Illinois Volunteers, June 16th,\r\n1861; was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General, May 17th,\r\n1861; of Major-General, February 17th, 1862; of Lieutenant-General,\r\nMarch 1st, 1864, and as Commander of the Armies of the United\r\nStates, March 24th, 1864; received the surrender of General Lee at\r\nAppomattox Court-House, April 9th, 1865; was inaugurated as President\r\nof the United States, March 4th, 1869; was again inaugurated March\r\n4th, 1873; traveled around the world with his family, May 17th,\r\n1877 - December 16th, 1879; died at Mount McGregor, July 23d, 1885,\r\nand was buried in the city of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nRECONSTRUCTION OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, soon after his election to the Presidential chair,\r\nturned his attention to the improvement of the National Capital,\r\nwhich was then unworthy of the American people.  The streets\r\ngenerally were wagon tracks, muddy in the winter and dusty in the\r\nsummer, while the numerous public reservations were commons overgrown\r\nwith weeds.  The growth of the city had been slow and labored, the\r\nreal estate being generally in the hands of a few old fogies who\r\nmanifested no disposition to improve or to sell.  For many years\r\nthe metropolis had been petted and spoiled by the general Government,\r\nwhich had doled out small annual appropriations, and the residents\r\nhad been exempted from many of the ordinary burdens of municipal\r\ngovernment and local improvement.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, with his great knowledge of men, found the right\r\nperson to place at the head of the regeneration of the city.  It\r\nwas Alexander R. Shepherd, a native of Washington, born poor and\r\nwithout friends, who went from the public schools into the shop of\r\na gas-fitter and plumber, where he learned the trade and became,\r\nin a short time, by honesty, industry, and ability, a leading\r\nbusiness man.  The Territorial Government was organized with Henry\r\nD. Cooke, the banker, as Governor, a Legislature, and Delegate to\r\nrepresent the District in Congress.  Shepherd, as Chairman of the\r\nBoard of Public Works, commenced with his immense energy and\r\ninvincible determination, to transform a slovenly and comfortless\r\nsleepy old town into the great and beautiful metropolis which\r\nL'Enfant had planned and which Washington approved before it received\r\nhis name.  The grandest systems of municipal improvement ever\r\nconceived were carried out regardless of expense.  The whole city\r\nwas placed upon an even and regular grade, the low places filled\r\nup, and the elevations cut down.  Some ninety miles of the three\r\nhundred miles of half-made streets and avenues were graded and\r\npaved, some with wood and others with asphaltum.  The public grounds\r\nand parks were made and ornamented with grass plats, shrubbery,\r\nand fountains, the sewerage and drainage were made perfect, and\r\nhealth, beauty, and comfort were permanently secured.\r\n\r\nWashington, thanks to Governor Shepherd (he having in time succeeded\r\nGovernor Cooke) became a metropolis worthy of the Republic.  By\r\nreducing the width of the streets a front yard was given to each\r\nhouse, planted with trees or flowers, and where the old canal yawned\r\nthrough the heart of the city, a muddy receptacle for dead dogs\r\nand filth, arose a broad avenue, while the small reservations dotted\r\nover the city were graded and ornamented with trees, fountains,\r\nand flowers.\r\n\r\nAll of this cost a great deal of money.  Congress appropriated five\r\nmillion dollars in cash, and several millions more were raised on\r\nbonds.  Much of this money was disbursed by Governor Shepherd, and\r\nhe undoubtedly was disposed to give profitable contracts to his\r\nfriends, and to the henchmen of those members of Congress whose\r\nvotes secured him liberal appropriations.  Newspaper correspondents\r\nreceived in several instances contracts for paving, which they\r\ndisposed of to those engaged in that business, and realized handsome\r\nsums, but close investigation failed to show that Governor Shepherd\r\nhad enriched himself or had added to the value of his own property\r\nas distinguished from the property of others.  His ambition was\r\nmore than a merely selfish one, and it was shown clearly that his\r\nability was equaled by his honesty.  A few years later he became\r\nfinancially embarrassed, and was forced to exile himself to Mexico,\r\nhoping to repair in its silver mines his shattered fortune.  General\r\nGrant never lost confidence in him, and as his improvements became\r\nperfected, Alexander R. Shepherd was regarded as the regenerator\r\nof the National Metropolis.\r\n\r\nAnother man who did much for the ornamentation of Washington City\r\nwas A. B. Mullett, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury.\r\nAfter having finished that magnificent structure, the extended\r\nTreasury Building, he planned and commenced the great State, War,\r\nand Navy Building, the cost of which is about twelve millions of\r\ndollars.  His professional advice was followed by Governor Shepherd,\r\nand it is not altogether creditable to our institutions that after\r\nhaving honestly disbursed millions on the public buildings in almost\r\nevery section of the country, as well as on those at Washington\r\nCity, Mr. Mullett was removed from his position on political grounds,\r\nand was obliged, after having given the best years of his life to\r\nhis country, to commence anew the practice of his profession for\r\na livelihood.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was much embarrassed early in his Presidential career\r\nby the attempts of some of those around him to engage in speculations\r\nfor their private benefit.  Always willing to bestow offices, or\r\nto dispense profitable favors to his numerous relatives by blood\r\nand by marriage, and to advance the interests of those who had\r\nserved him faithfully during the war, he could not understand the\r\ndesperate intrigues which speculation had led some of them into.\r\nAmong his proteges was Abel R. Corbin, who had been known at\r\nWashington as the clerk of a House committee, a correspondent, and\r\na lobbyist, and who had afterward removed to New York, where he\r\nhad added to his means by successful speculation.  Marrying General\r\nGrant's sister, who was somewhat advanced in years, he conceived\r\nthe idea of using his brother-in-law for a gigantic speculation in\r\ngold, and in order to obtain the requisite capital entered into a\r\npartnership with Jay Gould and James Fisk, Jr.  By adroit management,\r\nthese operators held on the first of September, 1869, \"calls\" for\r\none hundred million dollars of gold, and as there were not more\r\nthan fifteen millions of the precious metal in New York outside of\r\nthe Sub-Treasury, they were masters of the situation.  The only\r\nobstacle in the way of their triumphant success would be the sale\r\nof gold from the Sub-Treasury at a moderate price, by direction of\r\nGeneral Grant.  Corbin assured his co-conspirators that he could\r\nprevent this interference, and wrote a letter to the President\r\nurging him not to order or permit sales from the Sub-Treasury.  He\r\nostensibly sent this letter by special messenger, but, in fact,\r\nsubstituted for it an ordinary letter on family matters.  General\r\nGrant's suspicions were aroused by the receipt of this unimportant\r\nepistle, and at his request Mrs. Grant wrote to Mrs. Corbin, saying\r\nthat the General had learned with regret that her husband was\r\nengaged in gold speculations, and he had better give them up.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant returned to Washington on the 23d of September, 1869.\r\nThe next day, \"Black Friday,\" the conspirators put up the price of\r\ngold, and a wild panic ensured.  Leading men of all parties in the\r\ncity of New York telegraphed the President and the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, urging their interference as the only way of preventing\r\na financial crash, which would have extended over the whole country.\r\nAbout eleven o'clock Secretary Boutwell went to the White House,\r\nand after a brief conference General Grant expressed his wish that\r\nthe desired relief should be given, and Secretary Boutwell promptly\r\ntelegraphed to Sub-Treasurer Butterfield, at New York, to give\r\nnotice that he would sell four millions of gold.  This collapsed\r\nthe speculation.  \"I knew,\" said Jim Fisk, afterward, \"that somebody\r\nhad run a sword right into us.\"  It was not without difficulty that\r\nCorbin, Gould, and Fisk escaped from the fury of their victims.\r\nThe conspiracy was subsequently investigated by a committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and a report was made by James A. Garfield,\r\ncompletely exonerating General Grant, and declaring that by laying\r\nthe strong hand of Government upon the conspirators and breaking\r\ntheir power he had treated them as enemies of the credit and business\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was known to advocate the speediest practical return\r\nto specie payment, but the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nchanged the current of financial operations by declaring that the\r\nact of Congress of 1864, making \"greenback\" notes a legal tender,\r\nwas unconstitutional.  It is a curious fact, that while the community\r\nevery now and then is thrown into a condition of great excitement\r\nabout political rights and duties, and about who shall be President\r\nand who member of Congress, nine elderly gentlemen, wearing silk\r\ngowns, sitting in a quiet room in the Capitol, are deciding questions\r\nof direct and immediate political concern, taking laws from the\r\nstatute books, and nullifying the action of the executive and\r\nlegislative departments of the Government, yet not one in a thousand\r\nof the busy, restless citizens of the country knows or cares what\r\nthe decisions of this arch-tribunal are.\r\n\r\nThis high tribunal holds its sessions in the chamber of the Capitol\r\nwhich was originally constructed for and occupied by the Senate of\r\nthe United States.  The Supreme Court began its sessions here in\r\n1860.  The Court is in session from the second Monday in October\r\nto early in May of each year.  It usually sits five days each week,\r\nreserving Saturday for consultations on the cases in hand.  Positions\r\non this bench are deemed eminently desirable, as they are for life,\r\nor \"during good behavior.\"  The salaries are not to be despised\r\neither, being ten thousand dollars each per annum, with an additional\r\nfive hundred dollars to the Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe Credit Mobilier made a deal of talk, although comparatively\r\nfew people knew what it really was.  Under various acts of Congress\r\ngranting aid to the Union Pacific Railroad, that corporation was\r\nto receive twelve thousand eight hundred acres of land to the mile,\r\nor about twelve million acres in all, and Government six per cent.\r\nbonds to the amount of twelve thousand dollars per mile for one\r\nportion of the road, thirty-two thousand dollars per mile for\r\nanother portion, and forty-eight thousand dollars per mile for\r\nanother.  In addition to these subsidies, the company was authorized\r\nto issue its own first mortgage bonds to an amount equal to the\r\nGovernment bonds, and to organize with a capital stock not to exceed\r\none hundred million dollars.  All this constituted a magnificent\r\nfund, and it soon became evident that the road could be built for\r\nat least twenty million dollars less than the resources thus\r\nfurnished.  Of course, the honest way would have been to build the\r\nroad as economically as possible, and give the Government the\r\nbenefit of the saving, but this was not thought of.  The directors\r\nset themselves at work to concoct a plan by which they could\r\nappropriate the whole amount, and, after building the road, divide\r\nthe large surplus among themselves.  The plan hit upon was for the\r\ndirectors to become contractors, in other words, to hire themselves\r\nto build the road.  To consummate this fraud without exciting public\r\nattention, and to cover all traces of the transaction, was no easy\r\nmatter, but the directors employed an eminent attorney skilled in\r\nthe intricacies of railroad fraud, and with his aid and advice the\r\nmachinery for the transaction was finally arranged to the satisfaction\r\nof all concerned.  This attorney was Samuel J. Tilden.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid personal liability and give their movement the\r\nsemblance of legality, the directors purchased the charter of the\r\n\"Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency,\" and changed its name to the \"Credit\r\nMobilier of America.\"  At this time (1864) two million dollars of\r\nstock had been subscribed to the railroad company, and two hundred\r\nand eighteen thousand dollars paid in.  Samuel J. Tilden had\r\nsubscribed twenty thousand dollars.  The first thing the Credit\r\nMobilier did was to buy in all of this stock and bring the railroad\r\ncompany and Credit Mobilier under one management and the same set\r\nof officers.  Then the directors of the railroad company, through\r\ncertain middle-men, awarded the contract for building the road to\r\nthe Credit Mobilier, in other words, to themselves, for from twenty\r\nthousand dollars to thirty thousand dollars per mile more than it\r\nwas worth.  Evidence which afterward came to light in the Congressional\r\ninvestigations showed that the Credit Mobilier made a cash profit\r\nin the transaction of over twenty-three million dollars, besides\r\ngobbling up the stock of the road at thirty cents on the dollar,\r\nwhen the law plainly provided that it should not be issued at less\r\nthan par.\r\n\r\nOakes Ames, a sturdy Massachusetts mechanic, who had acquired a\r\nfortune by the manufacture of shovels, had been persuaded to embark\r\nin the construction of the Pacific Railroad.  Finding legislation\r\nnecessary, and knowing how difficult it was to secure the attention\r\nof Congressmen to schemes which did not benefit them or their\r\nconstituents, he distributed shares of this Credit Mobilier, to\r\nuse his own words, \"where it would do the most good.\"  Some of the\r\nrecipients kept it and pocketed the profits, while others endeavored\r\nto get rid of it when public attention was called to it, and they\r\nungratefully tried to make Mr. Ames their scapegoat.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  James Monroe\r\nJAMES MONROE was born in Westmoreland County, Va., April 28th,\r\n1758; served honorably in the Revolution; entered the Virginia\r\nLegislature when twenty-three years of age; entered Congress when\r\ntwenty-four; chosen United States Senator, 1789; was Minister to\r\nFrance, 1794-1796; was Governor of Virginia, 1799-1802; re-elected\r\nGovernor in 1811; resigned and became Secretary of State under\r\nMadison, 1811-1817; was President of the United States, 1817-1825;\r\ndied July 4th, 1831, in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nRESTORATION OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States had again returned to their allegiance, and in\r\nthe third session of the Forty-first Congress every State in the\r\nUnion was represented.  Vice-President Colfax presided over sixty-\r\none Republican and thirteen Democratic Senators, and Speaker Blaine\r\nover one hundred and seventy-two Republican and seventy-one Democratic\r\nRepresentatives.  The Republican party had preserved the Union,\r\nconquered peace, and was at the height of its power.  The \"carpet-\r\nbaggers\" from the South were gradually being replaced by ante-bellum\r\npoliticians and \"Southern brigadiers.\"  Many Northern men regretted\r\nthat the North had not sent more of its heroes to Congress, feeling\r\nthat men who had honorably faced each other on hard-fought battle-\r\nfields would have a mutual respect and a mutual desire to co-operate\r\ntogether for the national welfare.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident, however, that the Southern Democrats were\r\nabout to exercise an important influence in national politics, that\r\nthey possessed in common some very clearly defined purposes, and\r\nthat they were not likely to permit their allegiance to their party\r\nto interfere with their efforts to obtain what they called \"justice\r\nfor the South.\"  They went in without reserve for the old flag,\r\nbut they also went in for an appropriation--in fact, several\r\nappropriations.  They honestly thought that they were only asking\r\nsimple justice in demanding that the Government should spend nearly\r\nas much for the development of their material resources as it did\r\nfor the suppression of the Rebellion.  All their cherished ideas\r\nof State Rights vanished when money was to be expended at the South,\r\nand the honesty of their intentions made their influence far more\r\nto be dreaded than that of adepts in legislative corruption, who\r\nare always distrusted.\r\n\r\nThe number of Southern Representatives was greatly increased by\r\nthat change in the Constitution which abolished the fractional\r\nrepresentation of colored people and made all men equal.  It soon\r\nbecame evident, too, that the whites were determined, by a well-\r\ndisciplined legion, known as the Ku-Klux Klan, whose members\r\npretended to be the ghosts of the Confederate dead, to intimidate\r\nthe colored voters, and intimidation was often supplemented by\r\nviolence and murder.  The grossest outrages by this secret body\r\nwent unpunished and Congress finally passed a law which enabled\r\nthe President to eradicate the evil.\r\n\r\nThe \"Joint High Commission,\" for the adjustment of all causes of\r\ndifference between the United States and Great Britain, including\r\nthe depredations of Rebel cruisers fitted out in British ports and\r\nthe disputed fisheries in North American waters, assembled in\r\nWashington in the spring of 1871.  The \"High Joints,\" as they were\r\nfamiliarly termed, took the furnished house of Mr. Philp, on Franklin\r\nSquare, where they gave a series of dinner-parties, with several\r\nevening entertainments.  In return numerous entertainments were\r\ngiven to them, including a banquet by the leading Freemasons in\r\nWashington, some of them members of Congress, to the Earl De Gray\r\n(then Grand Master of Masons in England), and Lord Tenterden, who\r\nwas also a prominent member of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons for believing that the British were induced\r\nto gracefully make the concessions involved in the Alabama treaty\r\nby the knowledge that General Grant had taken into consideration\r\nthe expediency of seizing Canada as a compensation for damages\r\ninflicted upon the United States ships by Confederate cruisers\r\nfitted out in English ports.  This was a favorite idea of General\r\nJohn A. Rawlins, who was the brain of General Grant's staff and\r\nhis Secretary of War until death removed him.  General Rawlins was\r\nin full accord with the hope that Stephen A. Douglas's aspirations\r\nfor an ocean-bound Republic might be realized, and it was understood\r\nthat he was warmly seconded by General Pryor, of Virginia, ex-\r\nLieutenant Governor Reynolds, of Missouri, and others.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was indirectly opposed by Monsieur de Catacazy, the\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary of the Emperor of Russia to the United\r\nStates, who endeavored to prejudice Senators against its ratification,\r\nand inspired the correspondent of a New York paper to write against\r\nit.  This prompted Secretary Fish to request the Minister's recall,\r\nand there was also much scandal circulated by Madame de Catacazy,\r\na beautiful woman, who had been at Washington--so the gossips say\r\n--fifteen years before, when she had eloped from her husband under\r\nthe protection of Monsieur de Catacazy, then Secretary of the\r\nRussian Legation.  The Emperor of Russia, on receiving complaint\r\nagainst his Envoy, directed the Minister of Foreign Affairs to ask\r\nin his name that the President \"would tolerate Monsieur de Catacazy\r\nuntil the coming visit of his third son, the Grand Duke Alexis,\r\nwas concluded.\"  To this personal appeal General Grant assented.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke soon afterward arrived at Washington, and was welcomed\r\nat the Russian Legation by Madame de Catacazy, who wore a dress of\r\ngold-colored silk, with a flowing train, elaborately trimmed with\r\ngold-colored satin.  On her right arm she wore a double bracelet,\r\none band being on the wrist and the other above the elbow, the two\r\njoined together by elaborately wrought chains.  Her other ornaments\r\nwere of plain gold, and above them was a wealth of golden hair.\r\nAs the Grand Duke entered the Legation, Madame de Catacazy carried\r\na silver salver, on which was placed a round loaf of plain black\r\nbread, on the top of which was imbedded a golden salt-cellar.  The\r\nPrince took the uninviting loaf, broke and tasted of it, in accordance\r\nwith the old Russian custom.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke was cordially welcomed at the White House, but\r\nMonsieur de Catacazy was treated with studied coolness.  It was\r\nopenly intimated that there was a little Frenchwoman at Washington,\r\nyoung, sprightly, and accomplished, who had won the way into the\r\nCatacazy's household through the sympathies of its handsome mistress.\r\nShe was made a companion of, advised with, and intrusted with\r\nwhatever the house or Legation contained, confidential and otherwise.\r\nAll the public or private letters, papers, and despatches passed\r\nunder they eyes of this bright little woman, all that was said went\r\ninto her sharp ears, and every day she made a written report of\r\nwhat she had heard and seen, which was privately sent to the\r\nDepartment of State, and for which she was handsomely remunerated\r\nfrom the Secret Service Fund.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner purchased (before it was completed) an elegant\r\ndwelling-house between the Arlington Hotel and Lafayette Square,\r\nbut when he occupied it at the commencement of the next session,\r\nhe was alone.  The energetic reporters at once began to intimate\r\nthat the Senator's marriage had not been a happy one, and from that\r\ntime until the great Senator passed over the dark river this painful\r\nsubject was, as it were, a base of supplies from which a great\r\nvariety of theories were drawn and sustained.  One was sure that\r\nthe attentions of a diplomat had troubled the Senator, another\r\ndeclared that he was too arrogant, another that he was too exacting\r\n--in short, there was not an editorial paragraphist who did not\r\nsooner or later give a conjectural solution of Mr. Sumner's domestic\r\ninfelicity.  They were divorced, and he lived alone for several\r\nyears in his sumptuous house, which he adorned with superb works\r\nof art.  Here he hospitably entertained personal friends and\r\ndistinguished strangers.  Unforgiving and implacable, his smile\r\ngrew sadder, the furrows on his face deepened, and he lost his\r\nformer _bonhomie_.  He was a Prometheus Vinctus, bound to the\r\ndesolate rock of a wrecked life, but heroically refraining from\r\nrevenging his great wrong by attacking a woman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's difficulty with Mr. Sumner began when the President\r\ndid not consult the Senator about the formation of his Cabinet.\r\nThe breach was gradually widened, and thorough it the Senator\r\nfinally became completely estranged from his old friend and associate\r\nin the Senate, Secretary Fish.  When Mr. Motley was removed from\r\nthe English mission, Mr. Sumner insisted upon regarding it as a\r\npersonal insult, which he sought to repay by opposition to the\r\nacquisition of San Domingo.  General Grant endeavored to appease\r\nthe offended Senator, and on the evening of the day on which the\r\nSan Domingo treaty was to be sent to the Senate he called at Mr.\r\nSumner's house.  General Grant found the Senator at his dinner-\r\ntable with Colonel Forney and the writer, and was invited to take\r\na seat with them.  After some preliminary conversation, General\r\nGrant began to talk about San Domingo, but he did not have the\r\ntreaty or any memorandum of it with him.  He dwelt especially upon\r\nthe expenditures of General Babcock at San Domingo of a large sum\r\ntaken from the secret service fund for promoting intercourse with\r\nthe West India Islands, which Mr. Seward, when Secretary of State,\r\nhad prevailed on Representative Thad Stevens to have inserted in\r\nan appropriation bill during the war.  The President impressed Mr.\r\nSumner with the idea that he looked for an attack in Congress on\r\nthe manner in which much of that money had been spent.  Mr. Sumner\r\nunquestionably thought that General Grant had come to enlist his\r\nservices in defending the expenditure by General Babcock of one\r\nhundred thousand dollars in cash, and fifty thousand dollars for\r\na light battery purchased at New York.  The President meant, as\r\nColonel Forney and the writer thought, the treaty for the acquisition\r\nof the Dominican Republic.  The President and the Senator misunderstood\r\neach other.  After awhile General Grant promised to send General\r\nBabcock to the Senator the next day with copies of the papers, and\r\nthen left.  While escorting the President to the door, Mr. Sumner\r\nassured him that he was a Republican and a supporter of the Republican\r\nAdministration, and that he should sustain the Administration in\r\nthis case if he possibly could, after he had examined the papers.\r\nHe meant the expenditure of General Babcock, but the President\r\nmeant the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe next morning General Babcock called on Senator Sumner with a\r\ncopy of the treaty, which he began to read, but he had not gotten\r\nbeyond the preamble, in which Babcock was styled \"aid-de-camp of\r\nHis Excellency General Ulysses S. Grant,\" before Mr. Sumner showed\r\nsigns of disapprobation.  When General Babcock proceeded and read\r\nthe stipulation that \"His Excellency General Grant, President of\r\nthe United States, promises perfectly to use all his influence in\r\norder that the idea of annexing the Dominican Republic to the United\r\nStates may acquire such a degree of popularity among the members\r\nof Congress as will be necessary for its accomplishment,\" Senator\r\nSumner became the enemy of the whole scheme.  He did not believe\r\nthat the President of the United States should be made a lobbyist\r\nto bring about annexation by Congress.  Some of Mr. Sumner's friends\r\nused to tell him that he should have gone at once to General Grant\r\nand have told him of his purpose to oppose the treaty, and that he\r\nhad declared his hostility to it to General Babcock in unmistakable\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThis was the time when well-meaning friends of both of these great\r\nmen might have secured satisfactory mutual explanation, although\r\nno living power could have made Senator Sumner a supporter of the\r\nacquisition of the port of Samana in San Domingo.  In the Senate\r\nsycophants who \"carried water on both shoulders,\" and men who always\r\ndelight in fomenting quarrels, embittered Mr. Sumner against the\r\nPresident.  One had served his country well in the camp, while the\r\nother had performed equally valuable services in the Senate; one\r\nwas a statesman, the other was a soldier.  What did not appear to\r\nbe wrong to the General, the Senator regarded as criminal.  Conscious\r\nof the value of his services in saving the Union, General Grant\r\naccepted with gratitude the voluntary offerings of grateful citizens;\r\nbut Senator Sumner, who had seen so much of political life and of\r\npoliticians, knew too well that those who make gifts to public men\r\nexpect favors in return, and that every public man should be\r\ninflexibly opposed to the reception of presents.  Remarks by him\r\nabout the President, and remarks by the President about him were\r\ncarried to and fro by mischief-makers, like the shuttle of a loom,\r\nand Mr. Sumner directly found himself placed at the head of a clique\r\nof disappointed Republicans, who were determined to prevent, if\r\npossible, the re-election of General Grant to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, when Vice-President of the United States, endeavored\r\nto restore harmony, and said, in a letter to General Grant:  \"Your\r\nAdministration is menaced by great opposition, and it must needs\r\npossess a unity among the people and in Congress.  The head of a\r\ngreat party, the President of the United States has much to forget\r\nand forgive, but he can afford to be magnanimous and forgiving.\r\nI want to see the President and Congress in harmony and the Republican\r\nparty united and victorious.  To accomplish this, we must all be\r\njust, charitable, and forgiving.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  SchuylerColfax\r\nSCHUYLER COLFAX was born at New York City March 23d, 1823; was a\r\nRepresentative from Indiana, 1855-1869, serving as Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives six years; was elected Vice-President of\r\nthe United States on the ticket with General Grant, serving 1869-\r\n1873, and died at Mankato, Minnesota, January 13th, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nINTRIGUES AND INTRIGUERS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, when elected President of the United States, had\r\nendeavored to elevate his views beyond the narrow sphere of party\r\ninfluences, and had consolidated in his own mind a scheme of policy\r\nwhich he had before shadowed out for the complete reconstruction\r\nof the Union, and for the reform of abuses which had crept into\r\nthe Federal Government during the war.  The qualities which insured\r\nhis success as a soldier had not enabled him to succeed as a\r\nstatesman, but he displayed the same fortitude under apparent\r\ndisaster and courage at unexpected crises when he found himself\r\nagain passing \"the wilderness,\" darkened, not with the smoke of\r\nbattle, but with detraction and denunciation.  Again, in the old\r\nspirit he exclaimed, \"I will fight it out on this line if it takes\r\nall summer.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition to General Grant's re-election was hydra-headed,\r\nand no less than seven candidates were in the field against him.\r\nThe contest of 1824 had been called \"the scrub-race for the\r\nPresidency,\" and to that of 1872 was given the name of \"Go as you\r\nplease.\"  The watchword of the factions was \"Anything to beat\r\nGrant;\" their points of union were the greed of office and the\r\nthirst for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe only serious opposition to General Grant was that of the combined\r\nLiberal Republican and Democratic parties, which nominated as their\r\ncandidate Horace Greeley.  It was deeply to be regretted that\r\npolitical ambition tempted the only equal of \"Benjamin Franklin,\r\njourneyman printer,\" to become a politician.  Better informed than\r\nany other man on American politics, courageous, free from small\r\nvices, and the embodiment of common sense and justice, with a kind\r\nand charitable heart, he was a man of the people and for the people.\r\nHe was made supremely ridiculous by Nast's caricatures, and by his\r\nown record as collated from the files of the great newspaper which\r\nhe had founded and continued to edit.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley, after his double nomination at Cincinnati and at\r\nBaltimore, showed that he was not content with being a \"good printer,\r\na respectable publisher, and an honest editor,\" which he had\r\npreviously avowed was the height of his ambition.  The unnatural\r\npolitical alliance with those whom he had denounced for a quarter\r\nof a century led him into all sorts of inconsistencies and\r\ncontradictions, and displayed his insatiable thirst for public\r\noffice.  All the sympathies of the Democratic party had been his\r\nantipathies, all their hates his loves, and many of their leaders\r\nspoke of him publicly with contempt.  Indeed, his campaign would\r\nhave been a farce had not his untimely death made it a tragedy.\r\nRidicule killed him politically, and his political failure was the\r\nimmediate cause of his sad physical death.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner, endeavoring with the aid of Senator Schurz to\r\nconnect General Grant or some of the officers near him with the\r\nFrench \"arms scandal,\" prepared with great care, and read in the\r\nSenate on the 31st of May, 1872, a fierce philippic against the\r\nPresident.  Ancient and modern history had been ransacked for\r\nprecedents, which were quoted and then applied to General Grant,\r\nto show his unworthiness, his incompetency, his nepotism, and his\r\nambition.  The long tirade was an erudite exhibition of most intense\r\npartisanship, having as a motto from Shakespeare, \"We will have\r\nrings and things and fine array.\"  A few weeks later Mr. Sumner\r\nsailed for Europe, and did not return until after the election.\r\n\r\nAt the Republican National Convention, which was held at Philadelphia,\r\non Wednesday, the 5th of June, 1872, General Grant was renominated\r\nby acclamation as President and Henry Wilson as Vice-President.\r\nThe defeat of Mr. Colfax for renomination was attributable to the\r\nbitter hostility of some of the Washington newspaper correspondents,\r\nand to the free use of money among the delegates from the Southern\r\nStates, under the pretense that it was to be used for the establishment\r\nof newspapers and for campaign expenses.  Mr. Wilson had sent from\r\nWashington all the money that he could raise, and he had been\r\nliberally aided by Mr. Buffington, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Colfax was badly served by his own immediate friends and\r\nadvocates.  The Indiana delegation were at first quite immoderate\r\nin their mode of demanding their favorite statesman's renomination.\r\nOne gentleman, himself an editor, was especially bitter at the\r\nactivity of Mr. Wilson's newspaper friends, and declared he would\r\nmark them all in his paper.  Such declarations made what begun in\r\ngood feeling toward Mr. Wilson, and a considerable share of a fun-\r\nloving spirit, a strong and determined contest.  Then in the New\r\nYork and other delegations there were gentlemen who represented\r\nlarge employing and moneyed interests, as Mr. Orton, of the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company, Mr. Shoemaker, of Adams Express, and Mr.\r\nFranchot, familiarly known as \"Goat Island Dick,\" the principal\r\nattorney of the California Central Pacific for legislative favors\r\nfrom Congress.  These and other gentlemen identified with great\r\ncorporate interests were at first even bitterly hostile to Mr.\r\nWilson's candidacy, and to the last urged that of Mr. Colfax.\r\nThere was considerable fun in the conflict, which was, in the main,\r\nconducted with good-nature on both sides.  Mr. Colfax was by no\r\nmeans without newspaper friends.  Mr. Bowles, though a Greeley man,\r\ndid him quiet but continuous service.  Messrs. Jones and Jennings,\r\nof the New York _Times_, were present, and were understood to have\r\nexerted themselves for the Vice-President's renomination.  Mr.\r\nHolloway, of the Indianapolis _Journal_, was very active.  Colonel\r\nForney pronounced for Mr. Colfax through the _Press_, though his\r\nson, the managing editor, shared in the good feeling of the Washington\r\ncorrespondents toward the Senator.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was a very earnest one, and every citizen had to listen\r\nto campaign speeches, attend ward meetings and conventions, subscribe\r\nfor the expenses of torchlight processions, if he did not march\r\ntherein, and thus fortify his intellect and strengthen his conscience\r\nfor the quadrennial tilt with his friends over the relative merits\r\nof candidates and the proper elucidation of issues involved.  For\r\nthe first time civil-service reform was advocated by the Republicans,\r\nin accordance with the recommendations of General Grant in his\r\nmessage, and was opposed by those who (to paraphrase Brinsley\r\nSheridan) believed that \"there is no more conscience in politics\r\nthan in gallantry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1872, General Grant made the gratifying\r\nannouncement that the differences between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain had been settled by the tribunal of arbitration,\r\nwhich had met at Geneva, in a manner entirely satisfactory to the\r\nGovernment of the United States.  He also congratulated the country\r\non the coming Centennial celebration at Philadelphia, the completion\r\nof the ninth census, the successful working of the Bureau of\r\nEducation, the operations of the Department of Agriculture, and\r\nthe civil-service reform which Congress had been so reluctant to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe New Year's reception at the commencement of 1873 was a crowded\r\naffair.  Mrs. Grant wore a dress of pearl-gray silk, flounced and\r\ntrimmed with silk of a darker hue and with point lace.  Mrs. Fish\r\nwore an elaborately trimmed dress of Nile-green silk, and was\r\naccompanied by her young daughter, in blue silk.  Mrs. Boutwell\r\nwore a black velvet dress trimmed with white lace, and her daughter\r\na pale-blue silk dress trimmed with black lace, and Mrs. Attorney-\r\nGeneral Williams wore a dress of Nile-green silk, trimmed with\r\nValenciennes lace.  Lady Thornton wore a dress of royal purple\r\nvelvet, elegantly trimmed, and the bride of the Minister from\r\nEcuador wore a dress of sage-green silk, with a sleeveless velvet\r\njacket, and a velvet hat of the same shade.\r\n\r\nThe army, the navy, the Diplomatic Corps, and the judiciary were\r\nout in full force.  There were nice people, questionable people,\r\nand people who were not nice at all in the crowd.  Every state,\r\nevery age, every social class, both sexes, and all human colors\r\nwere represented.  There were wealthy bankers, and a poor, blind,\r\nblack beggar led by a boy; men in broadcloth and men in homespun;\r\nmen with beards and men without beards; members of the press and\r\nof the lobby; contractors and claim agents; office-holders and\r\noffice-seekers; there were ladies from Paris in elegant attire,\r\nand ladies from the interior in calico; ladies whose cheeks were\r\ntinged with rouge, and others whose faces were weather-bronzed by\r\nout-door work; ladies as lovely as Eve, and others as naughty as\r\nMary Magdalene; ladies in diamonds, and others in dollar jewelry;\r\nchambermaids elbowed countesses, and all enjoyed themselves.  After\r\nthe official reception at the White House the Secretaries and other\r\ndignitaries hurried to their respective homes, there in their turn\r\nto receive visits.  The foreign diplomats did not receive, but with\r\nthe army and navy men and the citizens \"generally\" went \"the grand\r\nrounds.\"  The older citizens had hospitable spreads, including hot\r\ncanvas-back ducks, terrapin, and well-filled punch-bowls, and\r\nveteran callers got in the work as ususal, but at most houses\r\nintoxicating drinks were dispensed with, and there were no such\r\nexhibitions of drunkenness as had disgraced former years.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner, who had left the Presidential contest and gone to\r\nEurope returned to his Senatorial duties and \"accepted the situation.\"\r\nEarly in the session he introduced a bill prohibiting the future\r\npublication of names of Union victories in the Army Register or\r\ntheir inscription on the regimental colors of the army.  This step\r\ntoward an oblivion of past difficulties was highly acceptable to\r\nGeneral Grant, who conveyed to Mr. Sumner his appreciation of the\r\nolive branch thus extended.  Others were not disposed to regard\r\nhis movement with a friendly eye, and the Legislature of Massachusetts\r\npassed a resolution censuring him.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner survived a few months only, when, after a very brief\r\nillness, he died at his house in Washington.  When he was gone,\r\nmen of all political parties joined heartily in eulogizing the\r\ndeceased statesman.  A mourning nation paid homage to his pure\r\nheart, to his sense of duty and right, to his courageous willingness\r\nto bear obloquy, to his unwearied industry--in short, to that rare\r\nunion of qualities which impart such grandeur to his memory.  Even\r\nthe jealousies and schemes of the living were restrained, as the\r\nsecond-rate heroes of ancient days postponed their contest for the\r\narmor of Achilles until last honors had been paid to the memory of\r\nthe illustrious departed.  In Doric Hall in the State House at\r\nBoston his remains finally lay in state amid a lavish display of\r\nfloral tokens, which were sent from all classes and localities,\r\nMassachusetts thus emphatically indorsing her son, whom she had so\r\nlately censured.\r\n\r\nSenator Sumner left behind him a few printed copies of a speech\r\nwhich he had prepared for delivery in the Senate before the then\r\nrecent Presidential election, each copy inscribed in his own\r\nhandwriting, \"private and confidential.\"  He had written it when\r\ninspired with the belief that with the Administration he was a\r\nproscribed man; but his friends convinced him that it would not be\r\nbest for him to throw down this gauntlet of defiance.  He had,\r\ntherefore, decided not to make public the indictment which he had\r\nprepared, and the few copies of it which had been given to friends\r\nwas not, as was asserted, the report of a \"posthumous speech.\"\r\nIts publication after his death by those to whom copies had been\r\nintrusted in confidence was an unpardonable breach of trust.\r\n\r\nThe great Massachusetts Senator had for years stood before the\r\ncountry with a strong individuality which had separated him from\r\nthe machine politicians, and placed him among the statesmen of the\r\nRepublic.  Before the roll of the Northern drums was heard in the\r\nSouth, he had defiantly denounced the slave-holders in the Capitol,\r\nand when the thunder of artillery drowned the voice of oratory, he\r\nearnestly labored to have the war overthrow and eradicate slavery.\r\nJust as his hopes were realized, and as he was battling for civil\r\nrights for the enfranchised race, his life, for which his friends\r\nanticipated a long twilight, was unexpectedly brought to a close.\r\nYet there is something so melancholy in the slow decline of great\r\nmental powers, that those who loved him the best felt a sort of\r\nrelief that he had suddenly thrown off his load of domestic sorrow\r\nand passed across the dark stream into the unknown land while still\r\nin the possession of his energies.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Yours truly\r\n  H. Wilson\r\nHENRY WILSON, born at Framington, N. H., February 16th, 1812; member\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives, 1840, and served four years\r\nin the State Senate, being twice its presiding officer; United\r\nStates Senator, 1855-1871; Vice-President, March 4th, 1873 - November\r\n22d, 1875, when he died.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA NEW TERM BEGUN.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's second inauguration on Tuesday, March 4th, 1873,\r\nwas shorn of its splendor by the intense cold weather.  The wind\r\nblew in a perfect gale from the southwest, sweeping away the flags\r\nand other decorations from private houses and making it very\r\ndisagreeable for the, nevertheless, large crowds of spectators.\r\nWhen the procession started from the White House, so intense was\r\nthe cold that the breath of the musicians condensed in the valves\r\nof their instruments, rendering it impossible for them to play,\r\nand many of the cadets and soldiers had to leave the ranks half\r\nfrozen, while the customary crowds of civilians were completely\r\nrouted by the cutting blasts.  The procession was headed by the\r\nregulars, followed by a battalion of half frozen West Point cadets\r\nin their light gray parade uniforms, and another of midshipmen from\r\nthe Annapolis Naval School in dark blue.  A division of gayly\r\nuniformed citizen-soldiers followed, including the Boston Lancers\r\nin their scarlet coats, with pennons fluttering from their lances,\r\nand the First Troop of the Philadelphia City Cavalry, which had\r\nescorted almost every preceding President, and which carried its\r\nhistoric flag, which was the first bearing thirteen stripes, and\r\nwhich was presented to the Troop in 1775.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, with a member of the Congressional Committee, rode\r\nin his own open barouche, drawn by four bay horses.  In the next\r\ncarriage was Henry Wilson, Vice-President, escorted by another\r\nmember of the Committee, and the President's family followed.\r\nAfter the military came political clubs in citizens' attire, with\r\nbands and banners, the Washington Fire Department bringing up the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Senate had closed the labors of the Forty-second\r\nCongress, and chairs were placed in the chamber for the dignitaries,\r\nwho soon began to arrive.  The members of the Diplomatic Corps wore\r\ntheir court dresses and were resplendent with gold lace and\r\nembroidery.  Chief Justice Chase, who came in at the head of the\r\nSupreme Court, looked well, although strangely changed by his full\r\ngray beard, which concealed all the lines of his face.  General\r\nSherman had been persuaded by his staff to appear in the new uniform\r\nof his rank, but, to their disgust, he wore with it a pair of bright\r\nyellow kid gloves.  There were other high officers of the army and\r\nnavy, with the heads of the executive departments, on the floor of\r\nthe Senate, and the members of the defunct House of Representatives,\r\nwho came trooping in after their adjournment, formed a background\r\nfor the scene.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock, Vice-President Colfax delivered a brief valedictory\r\naddress, and then Henry Wilson, Vice-President-elect, delivered\r\nhis salutatory, took the prescribed oath, and swore in the Senators-\r\nelect.  A procession was then formed, which slowly wended its way\r\nthrough the rotunda to the customary platform over the steps of\r\nthe eastern portico.  When General Grant appeared hearty cheers\r\nwere given by the vast crowd, estimated at not less then twenty\r\nthousand in number, packed behind the military escort on the plaza\r\nbefore the Capitol.  Chief Justice Chase again administered the\r\noath of office, and the President advanced, uncovered, to the front\r\nof the platform, and read his re-inaugural address.  The wind blew\r\na tempest at times, nearly wrenching the manuscript from his hands.\r\nNo sooner had he finished reading than the salute from a neighboring\r\nlight battery was echoed by the guns in the Navy Yard, the Arsenal,\r\nand at two or three forts on the Virginia side of the Potomac,\r\nwhich had not yet been dismantled.  Before the echoes of the salutes\r\nhad fairly died away, the procession started to escort President\r\nGrant back to the White House, the bleak wind making nearly every\r\none tremble and shiver.\r\n\r\nThe city was illuminated in the early evening, and the new wooden\r\npavement on Pennsylvania Avenue, cleared of all vehicles by the\r\npolice, was covered by the throng of shivering men, women, and\r\nchildren.  The light in the tholus over the great dome of the\r\nCapitol shone like a beacon far above the rows of colored lanterns\r\nwhich were hung in festoons from the trees among the sidewalks.\r\nCalcium lights added to the brilliancy of the scene, and many\r\nprivate houses and stores were illuminated with gas or candles.\r\nAt nine o'clock there was a display of fireworks on the park south\r\nof the White House, the rockets shooting comet-like across the\r\nclear, star-dotted sky, dropping showers of colored fire in their\r\nflight.  All the while the wind blew fiercely, and the cold was\r\nintensified, but the crowd seemed oblivious to the wintry blast.\r\n\r\nAt the inauguration ball, held in an immense temporary building,\r\nwhich had no heating apparatus, the ladies were compelled to wear\r\ntheir wrappings, and the gentlemen kept on their overcoats and hats\r\nas they endeavored to keep warm by vigorous dancing.  Mrs. Grant,\r\nwho wore a white silk dress trimmed with black Chantilly lace,\r\nshivered as she stood by the side of her husband on the dais, and\r\nthe members and the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps remained but a\r\nfew moments.  The supper, which had been prepared at a large expense,\r\nwas emphatically a cold repast.  The ornamental devices in ice-\r\ncream were frozen into solid chunks, and the champagne and punch\r\nwere forsaken for hot coffee and chocolate, the only things warm\r\nin the building.  The guests, each one of whom had paid twenty\r\ndollars for a ticket, were frozen out before midnight.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Chase never appeared in public after this inauguration,\r\nbut died on the 7th of May following.  An effort was made to have\r\nJustice Miller promoted, but President Grant positively declined\r\ndoing so, on the ground that to raise any Associate Justice over\r\nhis brothers would be to deepen jealousies not wholly invisible\r\nthere, so he tendered the important position to Roscoe Conkling,\r\nthen a United States Senator from New York, whose great intellectual\r\npowers especially qualified him to be the successor of Marshall\r\nand of Taney.  Some of Mr. Conkling's friends urged him to accept\r\nthe place, while others, who desired to see him President of the\r\nUnited States, prevailed on him to remain in political life and to\r\ndecline the President's offer.  General Grant then nominated as\r\nChief Justice his Attorney-General, George H. Williams, of Oregon,\r\nbut this awakened the jealousies of Justice Miller, whose son-in-\r\nlaw, Colonel Corkhill, commenced a vigorous attack upon the nomination\r\nin the Washington _Chronicle_, which he then edited.  There were\r\nalso some grave scandals in Washington society about a number of\r\nanonymous letters which had been written, it was intimated, by Mrs.\r\nWilliams.  When the Senate met it soon became apparent that the\r\nnomination of Mr. Williams could not be confirmed, and it was\r\nwithdrawn at his own request.  Having come to him without his own\r\nagency, he lost nothing in letting it go except some unpleasant\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThe President then nominated Caleb Cushing, who was more objectionable\r\nto the Court than Mr. Williams had been.  The _Chronicle_ boiled\r\nwith rage, and other journals admitted that even if Mr. Cushing\r\nhad caught the spirit of the age and taken a long stride out of\r\nhis old errors of opinion, he was not a man to be placed on the\r\nbench of the Supreme Court, when full civil rights had not been\r\naccorded to the negro and many important questions connected with\r\nthe war had not been settled.  On the other hand, Senators Sumner\r\nand Boutwell, of Massachusetts, vouched for Mr. Cushing's Republican\r\nrecord, and his loyalty and soundness on the measures of the war\r\nand reconstruction.  He would have been confirmed beyond doubt had\r\nit not been for a letter written by him at the breaking out of the\r\nRebellion, to Jefferson Davis, commending a clerk in the Attorney-\r\nGeneral's office, who considered it his duty to join his relatives\r\nat the South, for a position in the Confederate civil service.\r\nThe publication of this letter, which really contained nothing\r\nobjectionable beyond the fact that Mr. Cushing had recommended a\r\nfaithful clerk to an old personal friend as an honest and industrious\r\nman, was made the most of.  It was published by Colonel Corkhill\r\nin large type with flaming headlines, as evidence of a secret\r\nunderstanding between Mr. Cushing and the leader of the Rebellion.\r\nSenator Sargent, who was hostile to Mr. Cushing, his townsman, read\r\nthis letter in a Republican caucus, and it fell upon the Senators\r\nassembled like a heavy clap of thunder, while Senator Brownlow\r\n(more extensively known as Parson Brownlow) keenly said that he\r\nthought the caucus had better adjourn, convene the Senate in open\r\nsession, and remove Mr. Cushing's political disabilities.  Mr.\r\nCushing, learning what had transpired, immediately wrote a letter\r\nto the President requesting him to withdraw his nomination.  In\r\nthis letter he reviewed his acts since the commencement of the war\r\nand declared, in conclusion, that whatever might have been said,\r\neither honestly or maliciously, to his prejudice, it was his right\r\nto reaffirm that he had \"never done an act, uttered a word, or\r\nconceived a thought of disloyalty to the Constitution or the Union.\"\r\nThe President next nominated Morrison R. Waite, of Ohio, who had\r\nbeen connected with the Alabama Claims Conference at Geneva, and\r\nwho was a men of eminent legal abilities, conscientious, and of\r\ngreat purity of character.  No objection could be offered to the\r\nconfirmation of his nomination, and it was unanimously made.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin M. Stanton had previously been appointed a Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court through the exertions of Senator Wade, of Ohio.\r\n\"The War Secretary\" had left the department over which he had\r\nenergetically presided, and was suffering from heart disease.  He\r\ndeemed himself a neglected man and rapidly sunk into a listless\r\ncondition, with no action in it, but with occasional spells of\r\nenergetic sickness.  Mr. Wade came on from Ohio about this time,\r\nand went to see his friend.  Just then there was considerable talk\r\nthat Associate Justice Grier was about to retire from the Supreme\r\nCourt.  Mr. Wade deemed his friend neglected, and also thought it\r\nunintentional on the part of the President.  It conversation he\r\ndrew from Mr. Stanton the admission that he would like to be\r\nappointed to the Supreme Bench.  Just before leaving Wade said he\r\nmeant to ask Grant for the position, in the event of Grier's\r\nretirement.  Mr. Stanton forbade the action, but Wade declined to\r\nbe as modest as was the organizer of victorious armies and their\r\nadministration.  He went direct to the White House, and at the door\r\nfound the President going for a drive in his phaeton.  He was\r\ninvited to go along, and at once availed himself of the opportunity.\r\nDuring the ride he spoke about Mr. Stanton.  The President listened\r\ncarefully and said he had promised to consider Mr. Strong's name,\r\nand had supposed Mr. Stanton would not take the position even if\r\noffered to him.  Mr. Wade gave the conversation he had had with\r\nMr. Stanton.  There the matter ended.  Mr. Wade went home.  Mr.\r\nStanton remained quietly at his home.\r\n\r\nFinally Judge Grier resigned, and, to the surprise of most persons,\r\nEdwin M. Stanton was tendered and accepted the position.  He\r\nqualified by taking the oath of office, but never sat in that high\r\ntribunal to try a case.  One cannot help wondering what might have\r\nresulted from his presence there.  But he never had the opportunity\r\nof proving that the man who was so fierce and implacable as a War\r\nMinister could have been as calm and judicially impartial on the\r\nbench as Story himself.  There are many at Washington who believe\r\nthat Mr. Stanton committed suicide by cutting his throat with a\r\nrazor.  Caleb Cushing was positive that he did, and investigated\r\nthe matter so far as he could, but Hon. E. D. McPherson, of\r\nPennsylvania, for years the efficient clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, procured from the attendant physician a statement\r\nthat it was not so, but that Mr. Stanton died a natural death.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of General Grant's only and much-loved daughter, Ellen\r\nWrenshall Grant, to Algernon Charles Frederic Sartoris, at the\r\nWhite House, on the 21st of May, 1874, was a social event in\r\nWashington.  It was no secret that General Grant had not approved\r\nof the engagement between his daughter, not then nineteen years of\r\nage, and the young Englishman who had enlisted her affection on\r\nthe steamer while she was returning from abroad.  But when the fond\r\nfather found that her heart was set on the match he yielded, although\r\nit was a hard struggle to have her leave home and go abroad among\r\nstrangers.  The ceremony was performed in the East Room by the Rev.\r\nDr. O. H. Tiffany.  There were eight bridesmaids, and Colonel Fred\r\nGrant was the bridegroom's best man.\r\n\r\nThe bride wore a white satin dress, trimmed with point lace, a\r\nbridal veil which completely enveloped her, with a wreath of white\r\nflowers and green leaves interspersed with orange blossoms.  The\r\neight bridesmaids wore dresses of white corded silk, alike in every\r\nparticular, with overdresses of white illusion, sashes of white\r\nsilk arranged in a succession of loops from the waist downward,\r\nforming graceful drapery.  Mrs. Grant, who was in mourning, wore\r\na mauve-colored silk dress, trimmed with a deeper shade of the\r\nsame, with ruffles and puffs of black illusion, lavender-colored\r\nribbon, and bunches of pansies.  The banquet was served in the\r\nstate dining-room, with the bride's cake in the centre of the\r\nelaborately decorated table.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  M. R. Waite\r\n  Chief Justice\r\nMORRISON REMICH WAITE was born at Lynn, Connecticut, December 29th,\r\n1816; was graduated at Yale College when twenty-two years of age;\r\nstudied law; went to Ohio in 1838, and was there admitted to the\r\nbar in 1839; settled at Toledo; was a member of the State Legislature\r\nin 1843; was defeated as a Republican candidate for Congress in\r\n1862; was counsel for the United States before the Geneva Award\r\nCommission in 1871, and was presiding over the State Constitutional\r\nConvention of Ohio when he was appointed Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates, in January, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nCORRUPTION IN OFFICIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, having secured possession of the House of Representatives,\r\norganized upward of fifty committees of investigation, which cast\r\ntheir drag-nets over every branch of the administration, hoping to\r\nfind some evidence of corruption in which the President had shared;\r\nbut he most searching investigation failed to connect the name or\r\nfame of General Grant with any of this traditional \"picking and\r\nstealing.\"  Witnesses were summoned by the score, reams of paper\r\nwere covered with short-hand notes of testimony, and some of the\r\ncommittees traveled far and wide in search of the evidence they\r\ndesired.  They found nothing, but they reminded Massachusetts men\r\nof old Captain Starbuck, of Nantucket, a philosophical old sea-dog,\r\nwho never permitted bad luck to dampen his faith or his good spirits.\r\nReturning home from a three years' whaling voyage, with an empty\r\nhold, he was boarded by the pilot, an old acquaintance, who asked:\r\n\r\n\"Waal, Cap'n Starbuck, how many bar'ls?  Had a good v'yage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not 'zackly,\" responded the Captain, \"I haint got a bar'l of ile\r\naboard, but I'll tell ye, I've had a mighty good sail.\"\r\n\r\nJust as they were about to give up in despair, a jealous woman\r\nrevealed the fact that Caleb P. Marsh, of New York, had received\r\nthe appointment of post-trader at Fort Sill through the endeavors\r\nof his wife with the wife of the Secretary of War, General Belknap.\r\nMarsh made a contract with the trader already there, permitting\r\nhim to continue, in consideration of twelve thousand dollars of\r\nthe annual profits, divided in quarterly installments.  The money\r\nthus received was divided with the Secretary of War for two years\r\nby remittances to Mrs. Belknap, but subsequently a reduced amount\r\nof six thousand dollars a year, agreed on with the post-trader,\r\nwas similarly divided by remittances direct to the Secretary.\r\n\r\nWhen General Belknap was transplanted from a revenue collector's\r\noffice in Iowa to the Department of War, he brought his wife with\r\nhim to Washington, and they occupied the house just before vacated\r\nby Secretary Seward.  Other Cabinet officers gave parties, and so\r\ndid the Belknaps, but they had been too liberal with their invitations,\r\nespecially to the young officers just fresh from army life, and\r\nthere was a great deal of disorder, with accompanying damage to\r\ncurtains, carpets, and furnishings.  The result was that the Belknaps\r\nwere either obliged to retire from society and inhabit a cheap\r\nboarding-house, or replenish the family coffers.  Alas! the tempting\r\nMarsh appeared on the stage, and the temptation could not be\r\nresisted.  Mrs. Belknap died not long afterward, but her sister,\r\nthe widow of Colonel Bowers, of the Confederate service, inherited\r\nher \"spoils of war,\" was a mother to her child, and in due time\r\nbecame the wife of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of time required by decorum Mrs. Bowers traveled\r\nin Europe, accompanied by Mrs. Marsh and escorted by George H.\r\nPendleton, of Ohio.  Returning home, Mrs. Bowers was married to\r\nGeneral Belknap on the 11th of December, 1875, Mr. Pendleton giving\r\nthe bride away.  A handsomer or an apparently happier couple never\r\ncame to Washington in their honeymoon, and they were at once\r\nrecognized among the leaders of society.  Her dresses and jewels\r\nwere among the favorite themes of the industrious lady journalists\r\nwho get up marvelous accounts of Washington entertainment, and they\r\nwere worthy of comment.  I well remember having seen her one night\r\nwearing one of Worth's dresses, of alternate stripes of white satin\r\nembroidered with ivy leaves, and green satin embroidered with golden\r\nears of wheat, with a sweeping train of green satin bordered with\r\na heavy embroidered garland of ivy and wheat.  A cluster of these\r\nin gold and emerald was in her black hair, and she wore a full set\r\nof large emeralds, set in Etruscan gold.  The costume was faultless,\r\nand fitted to adorn the queenlike woman.\r\n\r\nNo one who had seen Mrs. Belknap wondered at the fascination she\r\nexercised over her husband, or thought it strange that he who seemed\r\nso sternly scrupulous about the expenditure of public money, should\r\nhave sacrificed his reputation that she might be known as the best-\r\ndressed woman in Washington society.  Perhaps, too, it was remembered\r\nthat he had brought from the camp one of its legacies.  Few post\r\ncommanders refused the original delicacies for the mess-table at\r\nhead-quarters from the post sutler who desired to keep on the right\r\nside of those in authority.  Why, then, could not the Secretary of\r\nWar permit his wife to receive a _douceur_ from one of those\r\ncormorants, who always grow rich, and who may without harm be made\r\nto lay down a fraction of their extortionate gains?\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln, it was well known, had accepted a shawl worth one\r\nthousand dollars from A. T. Stewart when he was supplying large\r\namounts of clothing and blankets to the arms, and she had also been\r\nliberally remembered by those who had sold a steamer at an exorbitant\r\nprice to the Government.  General Grant had been the recipient of\r\nmany presents, and the epoch had been styled by Charles Sumner one\r\nof \"gift enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Belknap had promptly resigned, but it became politically\r\nnecessary that he should be impeached.  He had as his counsel three\r\nable lawyers whose personal appearance was very dissimilar.  Ex-\r\nSenator Carpenter, who was leading counsel, was a man of very\r\nelegant presence, though his short neck and high shoulders made it\r\nimpossible for him to be classed as a handsome man.  His fine head,\r\nwith abundant iron-gray hair, tossed carelessly back from his\r\nforehead, his keen eyes and expressive mouth, shaded by a black\r\nmoustache, made up a very noticeable portrait, and his voice was\r\nso musical and penetrating that it lent a charm to the merest trifle\r\nthat he uttered.  Judge Jeremiah S. Black was a tall, broad-shouldered\r\nman, with a clean-shaven, rugged face, a bright-brown wig, and a\r\nsharp pair of eyes that flashed from under snow-white brows, which\r\nmade the brown wig seem still more brown.  He chewed tobacco\r\nconstantly, and the restless motion of his jaws, combined with the\r\nequally restless motion of his eyes made his a remarkable countenance.\r\nMontgomery Blair was a plain-looking man, as \"lean as a racer,\"\r\nand evidently as eager for the work before him, though his manner\r\nwas very quiet, and his bearing had none of the keen intentness\r\nthat characterized his associates.  The trio carried General Belknap\r\nsafely through his troubles.  The evidence was very remarkable and\r\ngave a curious picture of \"Vanity Fair.\"  The bargain made by Marsh\r\nwith the first wife; the huckstering and business matters growing\r\nout of it, talked about and discussed over her coffin; the marriage\r\nof the Secretary soon after with the sister of the then dead wife;\r\nthe frequent and enormous sums paid by Marsh to him; the ominous\r\nhints whispered about the mysterious interviews at the Arlington;\r\nthe hurried exposure; the frantic efforts to avoid it; the malignant\r\ngratification shown by the Marshses, \"we built the foundation on\r\nwhich they grew; we'll hurl them from it into a quicksand from\r\nwhich they will never emerge;\" the admissions of guilt made by the\r\nunhappy Secretary at a moment when, as it had been suggested, he\r\nwas contemplating suicide; the imprisonment in his own house; their\r\nstyle of living; the fact of their appearance at a large dinner-\r\nparty at the Freeman Mansion, adjoining the Arlington, where, the\r\nvery day after the testimony of the Marshes had been taken, their\r\nhaggard looks and nervous manner excited general comment, which\r\nwas not entirely silenced by their early departure on the plea of\r\nindisposition; the first effort of manliness on the part of the\r\nfallen Secretary, begging that the women might be spared, and he\r\nalone be allowed to assume the responsibility; his appearance one\r\nday at a Cabinet meeting and the next day held as a prisoner in\r\nthe dock of the police court, waiting for five long hours the\r\nappearance of friends to bail him out;--all these presented elements\r\nof such a character as to give the case a singular and sad peculiarity\r\nwhich we look for in vain in that of any other known to our records\r\nof criminal jurisprudence.  Nor was all this palliated in any way\r\nby the conduct and manner of the alleged criminal.  He saw the\r\npoint and smiled sympathetically at every effort of his counsel to\r\nbe witty and amusing, while another party at home claimed sympathy\r\nfrom her friends by the strange announcement that \"it was such a\r\nshame that the politicians should be allowed to prosecute such a\r\nman as General B. in such a manner; the President ought to interfere\r\nand prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Whisky Ring\" was the creation of Cornelius Wendell and other\r\nnoted Washington lobbyists.  It became necessary to raise money at\r\nthe time of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, and the revenue\r\nofficers, having been called on to contribute, conceived the idea\r\nof making the distillers pay a percentage on their ill-gotten gains.\r\nSecretary Bristow's efforts to break up these fraudulent and unlawful\r\ntransactions showed the immensity of the combination of capital\r\nand ingenuity employed in cheating the Government.  The weekly\r\npayments to the Ring amounted to millions, and for some years some\r\nof the participants pocketed four or five hundred dollars a week\r\nas their share.\r\n\r\nSenator Henderson, of Missouri, who had become provoked against\r\nPresident Grant, having been retained as counsel for the prosecution\r\nof some of the Missouri distillers, reported that General O. E.\r\nBabcock, who had served on General Grant's staff during the closing\r\nyears of the war, and had since been one of the private secretaries\r\nat the White House, was deeply implicated.  The result was that\r\nGeneral Babcock was tried before the United States Court for the\r\nEastern District of Missouri.  The trial showed that General Babcock\r\nhad had more intimate relations with the Whisky Ring in St. Louis\r\nthan any political necessity could justify, and the correspondence\r\nrevealed an almost culpable indiscretion in one occupying a high\r\nposition near the President.  The trial occupied fourteen days.\r\nNo portion of the evidence was kept back from the jury, and the\r\nverdict of \"not guilty\" under such circumstances was as complete\r\nan exoneration from the charge of conspiring to defraud the Government\r\nas the most ardent friends of General Babcock could have desired.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Matt H.Carpenter\r\nMATTHEW H. CARPENTER was born at Moretown, Vermont, in 1824; was\r\nat the Military Academy, at West Point, 1843-1845; studied law with\r\nRufus Choate; was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice at\r\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1848; was a United States Senator from\r\nWisconsin, March 4th, 1869 - March 3d, 1875, and again March 18th,\r\n1879, until his death at Washington City, February 24th, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE CENTENNIAL GLORY.\r\n\r\nThe Centennial year of the Republic was ushered in at Washington\r\nwith unusual rejoicings, although the weather was damp and foggy.\r\nThere were nocturnal services in several of the Episcopal churches\r\nand watch meetings at the Methodist churches.  Several of the\r\ntemperance organizations continued in session until after midnight,\r\nand there was much social visiting.  Just before twelve o'clock,\r\nthe chime of bells of the Metropolitan Methodist church played\r\n\"Pleyel's Hymn.\"  The fire-alarm bells then stuck 1-7-7-6 a few\r\nmoments later, and as the Observatory clock sounded the hour of\r\ntwelve, the fire-alarm bells struck 1-8-7-6; at the same moment\r\nthe brilliant light in the tholus which surmounts the dome of the\r\nCapitol was lighted by electricity, casting its beams over the\r\nentire metropolis.  A battery of light artillery, stationed on the\r\nArmory lot, thundered forth a national salute of thirty-seven guns.\r\nThe Metropolitan bells chimed a national centennial march, introducing\r\nthe favorite tunes of this and other nations, and there was general\r\nringing of bells, large and small, with firing of pistols and\r\nblowing of horns.  There were similar demonstrations at Alexandria\r\nand at Georgetown, and the ceremonies at the White House were in\r\naccordance with time-honored usage.\r\n\r\nThe first entertainment ever given in Washington to an Emperor and\r\nEmpress was at the British Legation, early in June, 1876, when Sir\r\nEdward and Lady Thornton entertained Dom Pedro and Donna Teresa,\r\nof Brazil.  The spacious hall, the grand staircase, and the drawing-\r\nrooms of the Legation were profusely ornamented with flowers, a\r\nlife-sized portrait of Victoria I, Empress of India and Queen of\r\nEngland, which faced the staircase, apparently welcoming the guests.\r\nMany of those invited had been on an excursion to Mount Vernon and\r\ndid not arrive until eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe ladies' dresses were very elaborate.  The Empress wore a vert\r\nd'eau silk trained skirt and basque high at the back and cut V-\r\nshape in front, the sleeves long; the rarest point lace nearly\r\ncovered both skirt and basque, set on in successive rows, headed\r\nwith plaits of the material; a broad black velvet ribbon, from\r\nwhich depended a pendant thickly studded with large diamonds,\r\nencircled her throat.  She wore large diamond ear-rings, and her\r\nlight-brown hair was combed down on her face, parted through the\r\nmiddle, and covering her ears, a Grecian knot confining her hair\r\nat the back of her head.\r\n\r\nLady Thornton wore a white satin trained skirt and basque, trimmed\r\nwith puffings of tulle, held in place by bands and bows of the\r\ndarkest shade of ruby velvet, interspersed with fine white flowers.\r\nThe Misses Thornton wore charming gowns of Paris muslin and\r\nValenciennes lace, relieved with bows of pink gros grain ribbons.\r\nMme. Borges, the wife of the Brazilian Minister, wore a mauve silk\r\ngown, trimmed with lace, and very large diamonds.  Countess Hayas,\r\nthe wife of the Austrian Minister, wore Paris muslin and Valenciennes\r\nlace over pale blue silk, which was very becoming to her blonde\r\ncomplexion and youthful face and form, and a profusion of diamonds.\r\nThe lately arrived Minister from Sweden, Count Lewenhaupt, was\r\npresent with his wife, whose dress of the thickest, most lustrous\r\nsatin of a peach-blossom tint, covered with deep falls of point\r\nlace, was very elegant.  Mrs. Franklin Kinney wore a rich mauve\r\nsatin beneath point applique lace.  Mme. Berghmann wore black silk,\r\nembroidered in wreaths of invisible purple, and trimmed with Brussels\r\nlace.  Mrs. Field wore a very becoming vert d'eau silk, handsomely\r\nmade and trimmed.  Mrs. Willis, the wife of the New York Representative,\r\nwore white muslin and Valenciennes lace.  Her sister, Mrs. Godfrey,\r\nwore a similar toilet, and the two ladies attracted universal\r\nattention by their beauty and grace.  Mrs. Sharpe was very becomingly\r\ndressed in white muslin, trimmed with Valenciennes lace and worn\r\nover a colored silk.  Miss Dodge (Gail Hamilton), over ivory-tinted\r\nsilk wore the same tint of damasquine.\r\n\r\nSupper was served at midnight, and afterward many of the guests\r\nwere presented to Dom Pedro and Donna Teresa in an informal manner,\r\nfor the Emperor was, according to his usual custom, wandering about\r\ntalking to whom he pleased, and the Empress, not being very strong,\r\nsat upon a sofa and talked pleasantly with all who were introduced\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial party had rooms at the Arlington Hotel, and the Emperor\r\nproved himself to be an indefatigable sight-seer, keeping on the\r\nmove from morning until night.  He would not permit his dinner to\r\nbe served in courses, but had everything put on the table at the\r\nsame time, as he could devote only thirty minutes to his repast.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the National Republican Convention, at Cincinnati,\r\nhad naturally been regarded with deep interest at Washington, and\r\nthe excitement was intense when, on the Sunday prior to the meeting,\r\nit was announced that Mr. Blaine had been stricken by illness on\r\nhis way to church.  He became unconscious, and on being carried\r\nhome was for some hours in an apparently critical condition, at\r\ntimes hardly able to breathe and unable to take the restoratives\r\nadministered by his physicians.  His condition was pronounced one\r\nof simple cerebral depression, produced primarily by great mental\r\nstrain, and, secondarily, by the action of excessive heat.  There\r\nwas no apoplectic congestion or effusion, nor any symptoms of\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nThe news of Mr. Blaine's illness was telegraphed to Cincinnati,\r\nand undoubtedly had an unfavorable effect upon the Convention.\r\nMr. Blaine, nevertheless, had gradually gained votes, until on the\r\nsecond day of the Convention he was within a few votes of the\r\ncoveted prize.  The shadows were settling down on the excited crowd,\r\nthe tellers found it getting too dark to do their work, and gas\r\nwas demanded.  The Blaine men, in an ungovernable frenzy, were\r\ndetermined to resist every effort at adjournment, while the combined\r\nopposition were equally bent on postponement in order to kill off\r\nBlaine.  Then it was that a well-known citizen of Cincinnati sprang\r\nto the platform, waved his hat at the Chairman, and during a moment's\r\nlull in the fearful suspense made the crushing statement that the\r\nbuilding was not supplied with gas.  Candles were asked for, but\r\nthe anti-Blainites had received their cue, and before the Blaine\r\nlines could be reformed they carried an adjournment by stampede.\r\nPolitical lies in this country are presumably white lies, but they\r\nare seldom followed with such tremendous results.  Delay enabled\r\nthe opposition to mass its forces against the favorite, and Hayes,\r\ninstead of Blaine, passed the next four years in the White House.\r\nNothing could have been more certain in this world than the nomination\r\nof Blaine on that eventful evening, if the same gas which burned\r\nbrightly enough twenty-four hours later for a Hayes' jubilee meeting\r\nhad not been choked off at a more critical time.\r\n\r\nWashington was wild with excitement immediately after the Presidential\r\nelection.  The returns received late on Tuesday night indicated\r\nthe election of Mr. Tilden, and even the Republican newspapers\r\nannounced on the following morning the result as doubtful.  Senator\r\nChandler, who was at New York, was the only confident Republican,\r\nand he telegraphed to the Capitol, \"Hayes has one hundred and eighty-\r\nfive votes and is elected.\"  He also telegraphed to General Grant\r\nrecommending the concentration of United States troops at the\r\nSouthern capitals to insure a fair count.  General Grant at once\r\nordered General Sherman to instruct the commanding generals in\r\nLouisiana and Florida to be vigilant with the forces at their\r\ncommand to preserve peace and good order, and to see that the proper\r\nand legal boards of canvassers were unmolested in the performance\r\nof their duties.  \"Should there be,\" said he, \"any grounds of\r\nsuspicion of fraudulent count on either side, it should be reported\r\nand denounced at once.  No man worthy of the office of President\r\nshould be willing to hold it if counted in or placed there by fraud.\r\nEither party can afford to be disappointed by the result.  The\r\ncountry cannot afford to have the result tainted by the suspicion\r\nof illegal or false returns.\"\r\n\r\nSome were disposed to wait, with as much patience and good-humor\r\nas they could command, the news from the pivotal States, while\r\nothers shouted frantically about fraud.  A number of leading\r\npoliticians were sent by each party to the State capitals, where\r\nthe National interest was concentrated, and the telegraph wires\r\nvibrated with political despatches, many of them in cipher.  Senator\r\nMorrill was requested by the Rothschilds to telegraph them who was\r\nelected President at as early a time as was convenient.  He replied\r\non Wednesday that the canvass was close, with the chances in favor\r\nof Tilden; but on Friday he telegraphed again that Hayes was probably\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nThe political telegrams sent over the Western Union wires during\r\nthe Tilden-Hayes campaign were subsequently surrendered by President\r\nOrton, of that company, to the Senate Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections.  It was asserted that those likely to prove prejudicial\r\nto Republicans were destroyed, and those damaging to Democrats were\r\nclandestinely conveyed to a New York paper for publication.  These\r\npolitical telegrams showed that the intimate friends of Mr. Tilden\r\nwere guilty of an attempt to secure the Presidential elections in\r\nseveral States by the use of money.  The translation of these\r\ncryptogramic messages by a working journalist, and their publication\r\nin the New York _Tribune_, was a great success, as it made clear\r\nwhat had previously been unintelligible.  When a Committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives undertook to investigate these cipher\r\ntelegrams, the principal witness was Colonel Pelton, the nephew\r\nand private secretary of Mr. Tilden.  His testimony was given in\r\nan apparently frank and straightforward manner, though he occasionally\r\nseemed perplexed, pondered, and hesitated.  He had a loud, hard,\r\nand rather grating voice, and delivered his answers with a quick,\r\njerky, nervous utterance, which often jumbled his words so as to\r\nrender them partially inaudible.  Colonel Pelton's tone in reply\r\nto the questions propounded to him during the examination-in-chief\r\nwas loud and emphatic, as though he wanted all the world to understand\r\nthat he was perfectly ready to answer every question put by the\r\nCommittee.  He sat easily, either throwing one leg over the other,\r\nfacing the Chairman, or picking his teeth, or blinking his eyes\r\nhard, which was one of his peculiar habits, as he kept examining\r\nthe photo-lithographed copies of the cipher telegrams and the\r\n_Tribune_ compilation before him.  Sometimes Colonel Pelton's blunt\r\nconfessions were of such astounding frankness as to elicit an\r\naudible whisper and commotion, what the French call a \"sensation,\"\r\namong the listeners.\r\n\r\nColonel Pelton's loud voice sank very low, and his easy, nonchalant\r\nattitude changed very perceptibly, when Messrs. Reed and Hiscock,\r\nthe Republican members, took him in hand and subjected him to one\r\nof the most merciless cross-examinations ever heard in a committee\r\nroom.  The two keen cross-questioners evidently started out with\r\nthe determined purpose to tear Colonel Pelton's testimony to pieces,\r\nand to literally not leave a shred behind worthy of credibility.\r\nThe respective \"points\" scored by the Republicans and the Democratic\r\nmembers of the Committee elicited such loud applause on the part\r\nof the auditors as to turn for the time the cross-examination into\r\na regular theatrical exhibition.  The cipher despatches confirmed\r\nthe opinion at Washington that Mr. Tilden spent a great deal of\r\nmoney to secure his nomination, and much more during and after the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nDisappointed politicians and place-hunters among the Democrats\r\ntalked wildly about inaugurating Mr. Tilden by force, while some\r\nRepublicans declared that General Grant would assume to hold over\r\nuntil a new election could be ordered.  General Grant made no secret\r\nof his conviction that Mr. Hayes had been lawfully elected, and he\r\nwould undoubtedly have put down any revolutionary movement against\r\nhis assuming the Chief Magistracy on the 4th of March, but there\r\nis no evidence that he intended to hold over.  Neither did the\r\nRepublican leaders in the Senate and House intend that he should\r\nhold over, in any contingency.  There were Republican Congressmen,\r\nhowever, who intended to elect Senator Morton President _pro tempore_\r\nof the Senate, and, in the event of a failure to have a formal\r\ndeclaration of Mr. Hayes' election in the joint Convention, to have\r\nhad Senator Morton declared President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was positively asserted, and never authoritatively\r\ndenied, that a compact had been entered into between representatives\r\nof Southern Congressmen and the authorized friends of Mr. Hayes at\r\nWormley's Hotel, in Washington, by which it was agreed that the\r\nUnion troops were to be withdrawn from the South in consideration\r\nof the neutrality of the Southern vote in Congress on all questions\r\ninvolving the inauguration of Mr. Hayes as President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  JamesGBlaine\r\nJAMES GILLESPIE BLAINE was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania,\r\nJanuary 31st, 1830; adopted the editorial profession; was a member\r\nof the Maine Legislature, 1859-1862; was a Representative from\r\nMaine, 1863-1876; was United States Senator from Maine, 1876-1880;\r\nwas Secretary of State under Presidents Garfield and Arthur, March\r\n5th, 1881 - December 12th, 1881; was nominated for President by\r\nthe Republican Convention, at Chicago, June 3d-6th, 1884, and was\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nTHE ELECTORAL COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission was a cunningly devised plan for declaring\r\nMr. Hayes legally elected President.  In the then feverish condition\r\nof parties at the Capitol, with no previously arranged plan for\r\nadjusting controverted questions, it was evident that some plan\r\nshould be devised for a peaceful solution of the difficulty.\r\nRepublicans conceived the idea of an Electoral Commission, to be\r\ncomposed of five Senators, five Representatives, and five Associate\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court.  No sooner had Mr. Tilden and his\r\nconservative friends agreed to the Commission, in which he would\r\nhave had one majority, than Judge David Davis, of the Supreme Court,\r\nwas elected a United States Senator.  This made it necessary to\r\nselect Judge Bradley as the man who was to hold the balance of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate on the bill establishing the Electoral\r\nCommission was deeply interesting, as several of those who participated\r\nwere prominent candidates for the Presidency.  There was an especial\r\ndesire to hear Senator Conkling, who had \"sulked in his tent\" since\r\nthe Cincinnati Convention, and the galleries were crowded with\r\nnoted men and women, diplomats, politicians, soldiers and journalists\r\nfrom all sections of the Republic.\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling took the floor late in the afternoon.  Tall, well\r\nproportioned, with his vest opening down to the waist and displaying\r\nhis full chest and broad shoulders to the best advantage, his hair\r\ntossed back from his massive brow with studied carelessness, his\r\nwhite and slender hands set off by spotless linen, he looked every\r\ninch a Senator.  Before him, on the desk, were his notes, daintily\r\ninscribed on gilt-edged, cream-tinted paper; but he did not refer\r\nto them, having committed his remarks so thoroughly that many\r\nbelieved them to have been extemporaneous.  His speech was pronounced\r\nby good judges as the greatest specimen of \"the art which conceals\r\nart\" that has ever been delivered in this country.  With apparent\r\ncandor, good nature, and disinterested statesmanship, he adroitly\r\nstated his side of the case, reviewing what had been done at previous\r\nPresidential elections, and showing that he had given the subject\r\ncareful study.  As dinner-time approached, Senator Edmunds stated\r\nthat Mr. Conkling was not physically able to finish his speech,\r\nand moved that the Senate go into the consideration of executive\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Senator from New York was not present, and after\r\na recess had been taken for ten minutes, in the hope that he would\r\narrive, Senator Sargent, of California, took the floor.  Mr. Conkling\r\nfinally came in, and when he began to speak, appeared to be in\r\nbetter health than on the day previous, and he again uttered his\r\nwell-rounded sentences as if without premeditation.  Once he forgot\r\nhimself, when, to give additional emphasis to a remark, he advanced\r\nacross the aisle toward Senator Morton.  The Senator from Indiana\r\nretreating, Mr. Conkling exclaimed, in the most dramatic tone, \"I\r\nsee that the Senator retreats before what I say!\"  \"Yes,\" replied\r\nSenator Morton, in his blunt way, \"I retreated as far as I could\r\nfrom the false doctrine taught by the gentleman from New York.\"\r\n\"Mr. President,\" said Senator Conkling, evidently disconcerted,\r\n\"the honorable Senator observes that he has retreated as far as he\r\ncould.  That is the command laid on him by the common law.  He is\r\nbound to retreat to the wall before turning and rending an\r\nadversary.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Dawes reminded the Senator that the Commission should be\r\nmade as exact as it would in the State of Massachusetts, he replied\r\nthat it would not be possible.  \"The Queen of Sheba,\" said Mr.\r\nConkling, \"said that she never realized the glory of Solomon until\r\nshe entered the inner Temple.  The idea that the Representatives\r\nof other States could breathe the upper air, or tread the milky\r\nway, never entered into the wildest and most presumptuous flight\r\nof the imagination.  Oh! no, Mr. President.  Whenever the thirty-\r\nseven other States attain to the stature of the grand old Commonwealth,\r\nthe time will come when no problem remains to be solved, and when\r\neven contested Presidential votes will count themselves.  Then, in\r\nevery sphere and orbit, everything will move harmoniously, by\r\nundeviating and automatic processes.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was prolonged into the night, and it was after midnight\r\nbefore Senator Morton spoke, pale, trembling in every limb, and\r\nwith his forehead beaded with great drops of perspiration.  He\r\nspoke sitting in his chair, and for upward of an hour hurled argument\r\nafter argument at the bill, evidently speaking from deep conviction.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, who had been sworn in the day previous, followed Mr.\r\nMorton, and created quite a sensation by opposing the bill.  The\r\nnight dragged on, and it was seven o'clock ere the final vote on\r\nthe passage of the bill was reached.  It was passed by a vote of\r\nforty-seven ayes against seventeen nays, ten Senators being absent\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, after a somewhat stormy session,\r\nwhich lasted seven hours, passed the Electoral Commission Bill by\r\none hundred and ninety-one ayes against eighty-six nays.  Five-\r\nsixths of those voting in favor of the bill were Democrats, and\r\nfour-fifths of those voting against it were Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission, which commenced its sessions on Wednesday,\r\nJanuary 31st, was a grand legal exhibition.  It occupied the Supreme\r\nCourt room, which had been made historic when the Senate Chamber\r\nby the great debates in which Webster, Clay, Calhoun, and other\r\nfamous statesmen had participated.  The fifteen Commissioners,\r\nsitting on the lengthened bench of the Supreme Court, listened in\r\nturn to the intricate propositions of constitutional law presented\r\nby Mr. Evarts, with his acuteness and dispassionate eloquence; to\r\nthe partisan harangues of Charles O'Conor, who had risen like one\r\nfrom the grave; to the tirades of David Dudley Field; to the\r\nponderous yet effective reasoning of Joseph McDonald; to the\r\ningenious reasoning of Senator Howe; to the forcible style and\r\nflippant wit of Matt. Carpenter; to the polished sentences of Mr.\r\nStoughton; to the graceful and powerful argument of the venerable\r\nJudge Campbell, of Louisiana, who had in '61 gone South from the\r\nBench of the Supreme Court, with a number of others.\r\n\r\nThe counting of the electoral vote on the 2d of February, 1877,\r\nattracted crowds to the House of Representatives.  Even the diplomats\r\ncame out in force, and for once their gallery was full.  On the\r\nfloor of the House were many distinguished men, including George\r\nBancroft, Mr. Stoughton, of New York, crowned with a mass of white\r\nhair; General Sherman, William M. Evarts, Jere. Black, and Lyman\r\nTrumbull.  At one o'clock the Senate came over in solemn procession,\r\npreceded by the veteran Captain Basset, who had in charge two\r\nmahogany boxes, in which were locked the votes upon which the fate\r\nof the nation depended.  Next came President _pro tem._ Ferry and\r\nSecretary Gorham, followed by the paired Senators.  Roscoe Conkling,\r\ntall and distinguished in appearance, was arm in arm with Aaron\r\nSargent, the California printer; Bruce, the colored Mississippian,\r\nwas with Conover, the Florida carpet-bagger; the fair Anglo-Saxon\r\ncheeks of Jones, of Nevada, contrasted strongly with the Indian\r\nfeatures of General Logan, and finally along came Oliver P. Morton,\r\nof Indiana.\r\n\r\nPresident _pro tem._ Ferry, in a theatrical bass voice, called the\r\nConvention to order, and, after stating what it was convened for,\r\nopened one of the boxes and handed an envelope to Senator Allison,\r\nwith a duplicate to Mr. Stone.  It was from the State of Alabama,\r\nand on being opened, ten votes were recorded for Samuel J. Tilden,\r\nof New York.  State after State was thus counted until Florida was\r\nreached, when the majestic Dudley Field arose and objected to the\r\ncounting thereof.  A brief discussion ensued, and the vote of\r\nFlorida was turned over to the Electoral Commission.  The Senate\r\nthen returned to its chamber, preceded by the locked boxes, then\r\nnearly empty.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted by those who should have known that Judge Bradley,\r\nwho had been substituted for Judge Davis, came near, in the discussion\r\non the Florida votes, turning the result in favor of Tilden.  After\r\nthe argument upon the Florida case before the Commission, Judge\r\nBradley wrote out his opinion and read it to Judge Clifford and\r\nJudge Field, who were likewise members of the Commission.  It\r\ncontained, first, an argument, and, secondly, a conclusion.  The\r\nargument was precisely the same as that which appears in the public\r\ndocument; but Judge Bradley's conclusion was that the votes of the\r\nTilden electors in Florida were the only votes which ought to be\r\ncounted as coming from the State.  This was the character of the\r\npaper when Judge Bradley finished it and when he communicated it\r\nto his colleagues.  During the whole of that night Judge Bradley's\r\nhouse in Washington was surrounded by the carriages of Republican\r\nvisitors, who came to see him apparently about the decision of the\r\nElectoral Commission, which was to be announced next day.  These\r\nvisitors included leading Republicans, as well as persons deeply\r\ninterested in the Texas Pacific Railroad scheme.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commission assembled the next morning, and when the judgment\r\nwas declared, Judge Bradley gave his voice in favor of counting\r\nthe votes of the Hayes electors in Florida!  The argument he did\r\nnot deliver at the time; but when it came to be printed subsequently,\r\nit was found to be precisely the same as the argument which he had\r\noriginally drawn up, and on which he had based his first conclusion\r\nin favor of the Tilden electors.\r\n\r\nDisputed State after disputed State was disposed of, and Washington\r\nwas stirred with feverish excitement.  Every day or two some rumor\r\nwas started, and those who heard it were elated or depressed, as\r\nthey happened to hope.  But the great mass listened with many grains\r\nof allowance, knowing how easy it is at all times for all sorts of\r\nstories, utterly without foundation, to get into the public mouth.\r\nThe obstructionists found that they could not accomplish their\r\npurpose to defeat the final announcement, but their persistence\r\nwas wonderful.  They were desperate, reckless, and relentless.\r\nFernando Wood headed, in opposition to them, the party of settlement\r\nand peace, his followers being composed in about equal parts of\r\nRepublicans and of ex-Confederates who turned their backs on the\r\nDemocratic filibusters.  Finally the count was ended, and President\r\n_pro tem._ Ferry announced one hundred and eighty-four votes for\r\nSamuel J. Tilden and one hundred and eighty-five votes for Rutherford\r\nB. Hayes.\r\n\r\nFew personages in Washington during this period were more sought\r\nafter by visitors than Francis E. Spinner, who, under Lincoln,\r\nJohnson, and Grant, held the office of Treasurer of the United\r\nStates for fourteen successive years.  Whether the verdant visitors\r\nsupposed that his high office enabled him to distribute greenbacks\r\nat pleasure to all who came, or whether his remarkable signature,\r\nwhich all the land knew, made him seem a remarkable man, matters\r\nlittle; the fact remains that he was flooded with callers, whom he\r\nreceived with genial cordiality, making all feel that they too had\r\nan interest in the money makers of the land.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, having passed eight years in the army and eight more\r\nin the White House, retired to private life without regret.  His\r\nform had become more rotund while he was President, his weight had\r\nincreased from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty-five\r\npounds, his reddish-brown hair and beard had become speckled with\r\ngray, and he had to use eye-glasses in reading.  His features had\r\nsoftened, perhaps, in their determined expression, but his square,\r\nmassive jaws always gave him a resolute look.  He loved to listen\r\nbetter than to talk, but when with friends he would always take\r\npart in the conversation, often spicing his sententious remarks\r\nwith humorous comments.  His sentences, at times epigrammatic, were\r\nthose of \"a plain, blunt soldier,\" but his vigorous economy of\r\nwords lent additional force to what he said, and he would not only\r\nhold his own in a discussion with Senators learned in the law, but\r\nwould convince his opponents by merely saying his say, and meaning\r\nwhat he said.  He was never known while in Washington to tell an\r\nindelicate story or to use a profane word, although when slightly\r\nexcited he would sometimes say, \"Dog on it!\" to give emphasis to\r\nhis assertion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's Administration was not an unalloyed success.  The\r\nstrength of the Republican party, which might, with a careful,\r\neconomical, and strictly honest administration, have been maintained\r\nfor a generation, was frittered away and its voters alienated by\r\ncauses that need not be recapitulated here.  The once noble party,\r\nwhich had its genesis twenty years previous in the great principle\r\nof the restriction of human slavery, which had gone from triumph\r\nto triumph until slavery was not only restricted but utterly\r\ndestroyed, the party which had added the salvation of the Union to\r\nits fame as the emancipator of a race, had sunk under the combined\r\neffects of political money making, inflated currency, whisky rings,\r\nrevenue frauds, Indian supply steals, and pension swindles.  General\r\nGrant, though himself honest, appeared unable to discern dishonesty\r\nin others, and suffered for the sins of henchmen who contrived to\r\nattach to the Republican party an odium which should have attached\r\nwholly to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"It was my fortune or misfortune,\" said General Grant in his last\r\nand eighth annual message to Congress, \"to be called to the office\r\nof the Chief Executive without any previous political training.\"\r\nA great and successful soldier, he knew absolutely nothing of civil\r\ngovernment.  His natural diffidence was strangely mingled with the\r\nhabit of authority, and he undertook all the responsibilities of\r\ncivil power without any of the training which is essential to its\r\nwise exercise, as if his glory as General would more than atone\r\nfor his deficiencies as President.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  F. E. Spinner\r\nFRANCIS E. SPINNER was born at German Flats, New York, January\r\n21st, 1802; was cashier of the Mohawk Valley Bank for twenty years;\r\nwas a Representative in Congress from New York, December 3d, 1855\r\n- March 3d, 1861; was appointed by President Lincoln Treasurer of\r\nthe United States March 16th, 1861; was successively re-appointed\r\nby Presidents Johnson and Grant; resigned July 1st, 1875, when he\r\nretired to private life, passing his winters in Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nINAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT HAYES.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hayes, having been notified by friends at Washington that\r\nthe electoral count would declare his election as President, left\r\nColumbus for the national capital on the afternoon of the first of\r\nMarch.  Very early the next morning he was informed by a telegraph\r\noperator that the count had been peacefully completed, and that\r\nSenator Ferry, the President _pro tem._ of the Senate, had announced\r\nthat Rutherford B. Hayes had been duly elected President, and\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler Vice-President.  This announcement was Mr. Hayes'\r\nonly notification.\r\n\r\nArriving at Washington at ten o'clock on the morning of the second\r\nof March, in a heavy rain-storm, Governor Hayes and his wife were\r\nreceived by Senator Sherman and his brother, General Sherman, who\r\nescorted them under umbrellas to a carriage, in which they were\r\ndriven to the residence of the Senator.  After having breakfasted,\r\nthe President-elect, accompanied by General Sherman and ex-Governor\r\nDennison, went to pay their respects to the President at the\r\nExecutive Mansion.  They were received by General Grant in his\r\nprivate office, and the outgoing and incoming President held a\r\nbrief conversation on general topics, without, however, alluding\r\nto anything of a political character.  Subsequently, the members\r\nof General Grant's Cabinet came into the room and were introduced\r\nto the President-elect.  The stay at the White House occupied less\r\nthan half an hour, and from there the party drove to the Capitol\r\nand were ushered into the Vice-President's room, adjoining the\r\nSenate Chamber.  Here the President-elect held quite a levee,\r\nlasting nearly two hours.  All of the Republican and most of the\r\nDemocratic Senators paid their respects to him, those who had no\r\nprevious acquaintance being introduced by ex-Governor Dennison.\r\nThe presence of the new President in the Capitol soon became known\r\nin the House of Representatives, and a stampede of members followed,\r\nthronging the Senate reception room and all the surrounding lobbies.\r\nThe Georgia delegation paid their respects in a body, and among\r\nthe callers were many Democrats from other Southern States.\r\n\r\nBetween this time and the next afternoon there were several important\r\npolitical consultations on the situation, the Cabinet, and the\r\ninaugural, with much speculation as to whether Mr. Tilden would\r\ntake the oath of office as President of the United States upon the\r\nfollowing day, March 4th, which fell this year upon Sunday.  It\r\nwas finally decided that the oath should be administered to Governor\r\nHayes on Saturday evening.  He was one of a party which had been\r\ninvited to dine at the Executive Mansion, and while the guests were\r\nassembling, Governor and Mrs. Hayes, with two or three friends,\r\nstepped into the Red Parlor with General Grant, where the Governor\r\ntook the oath of office, by which he became _de jure_ and _de facto_\r\nChief Magistrate of the United States.  The proceeding was temporarily\r\nkept secret, even from the other guests at the dinner.\r\n\r\nMonday, March 5th, was a rainy and cloudy day.  Despite the prolonged\r\nuncertainty as to the result of the Presidential election, and the\r\nshort time given for arrangements, the city was crowded.  It was\r\nestimated that thirty thousand persons left New York for Washington\r\non Saturday and Sunday.  Pennsylvania Avenue was gayly attired in\r\nwaving bunting, the striking features being pyramids or arches\r\ncomposed of flags and streamers of variegated colors, suspended\r\nacross the avenue by strong cords.  The decorations were not so\r\nextensive as would have been the case had longer time been afforded\r\nfor preparation.\r\n\r\nThe procession was under the direction of Major Whipple, of the\r\narmy, as Chief Marshal.  It was escorted by the United States\r\ntroops, which had been concentrated at Washington, the Marines,\r\nthe District Volunteer Militia, the Philadelphia State Fencibles,\r\nand the Columbus Cadets.  Governor Hayes rode with General Grant\r\nin the latter's carriage, and they were followed by the Grand Army\r\nof the Republic, Veteran Associations from Philadelphia and Baltimore,\r\nlocal political associations, and the steam fire engines.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate Chamber there was the usual assemblage of dignitaries,\r\nwith crowds of ladies in the galleries.  Vice-President Wheeler\r\nwas sworn in and delivered a brief address, after which he administered\r\nthe oath to the new Senators.  The customary procession was formed,\r\nand moved to the platform erected over the eastern entrance to the\r\nrotunda.  Governor Hayes was greeted with loud cheers from the\r\nassembled multitude, and when silence had been restored he read\r\nhis inaugural in a clear voice.  When he had concluded the oath of\r\noffice was formally administered to him by Chief Justice Waite,\r\nand the new President returned to the White House, amid cheers of\r\nthe multitude and salutes of artillery.\r\n\r\nAt the White House Mrs. Grant had provided a handsome collation,\r\nwhich was enjoyed by the members of the retiring Administration\r\nand a few personal friends of the incoming official.  President\r\nHayes was warmly congratulated on having received, through the\r\nagency of the Electoral Commission, a title to office that no one\r\nwould dare to dispute openly.  Reckless friends of Mr. Tilden, who\r\nhad hoped to plunge the country into the turmoil and uncertainty\r\nof another election, found that their chief had tamely accepted\r\nthe situation, and they quietly submitted.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a Cabinet was not fully determined upon until\r\nafter President Hayes had arrived in Washington.  Before he came\r\nGeneral Burnside and other Republicans who had served in the Union\r\narmy urged the appointment of General Joseph E. Johnston as Secretary\r\nof War, but after much discussion the intention was reluctantly\r\nabandoned.  When President Hayes had been inaugurated the names of\r\nseveral Southerners were presented to him, including ex-Senator\r\nAlcorn, Governor John C. Born, and General Walthall, a gallant\r\nsoldier and an able lawyer.  President Hayes finally decided to\r\ngive the position of Postmaster-General to \"Dave\" Key.\r\n\r\nJudge Key had just before served in the Senate for a year, by\r\nappointment of the Governor of Tennessee, as the successor of Andrew\r\nJohnson, and his known popularity in that body rendered it certain\r\nthat his nomination would be confirmed.  At the close of the war\r\nthe Judge had found himself in North Carolina very poorly off for\r\nclothes, surrounded by his wife and six children, also poor in\r\nraiment, without a dollar of money that would buy a rasher of bacon\r\nor a pint of cornmeal.  He had a few dollars of Confederate money,\r\nbut that was not worth the paper it was printed upon.  Nearly\r\neverybody about him was as poor as himself, and the suffering\r\nthrough the section in which he found himself was very great.  He\r\nowned nothing in the world but a half-starved mule that had been\r\nhis war-horse for many months.  This was before the days of the\r\nCommune, and he didn't know that mule meat was good; besides, he\r\ndid not want to kill his war-horse that had carried him through so\r\nmany deadly breaches.  Before Judge Key and his family had reached\r\nthat point when prayers take the place of hunger, however, relief\r\ncame.  An old resident of North Carolina heard of Key's necessities,\r\nand helped him out.  He gave him seed to sow, a shanty to live in,\r\nand some land to till, also a small supply of bacon and cornmeal.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then went to work.  He beat his sword into a plowshare\r\nand his fiery charger into a plow-horse.  He worked with his little\r\nfamily and lived scantily the whole summer long.  There was no\r\nfancy farming about it.  When the corn was sold the Judge had eighty\r\ndollars in despised Yankee greenbacks.  He then applied to President\r\nAndrew Johnson, who was announcing that \"treason is a crime and\r\nmust be punished,\" for leave to return to Tennessee, and he awaited\r\na reply with a good deal of apprehension.  It came in due course\r\nof mail, a very kind, brotherly letter, inclosing a pardon.  Judge\r\nKey had not asked for this, and was quite overwhelmed.  It was\r\nstated in the Senate in open session on the day of his confirmation\r\nthat he had voted for Tilden, but he loyally sustained the Hayes\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the Cabinet were well-known Republicans.\r\nWilliam M. Evarts, who had so successfully piloted Mr. Hayes through\r\nthe Electoral Commission, was very properly made Secretary of State.\r\nTall, without the slightest tendency toward rotundity, and with an\r\nintellectual head set firmly on his shoulders, Mr. Evarts displayed\r\ngreat energy of character, unswerving integrity, and devotion to\r\nhis clients.  Great in positive intellect, he rendered it available,\r\nas an able general manoeuvres for position and arranges strategic\r\nmovements, and was ready to meet his adversaries in a rhetorical\r\nstruggle with volleys of arguments framed in sentences of prodigious\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman, the Secretary of the Treasury, was a financial tower\r\nof strength, whose honesty, patriotism, and ability had endeared\r\nhim to the people, while Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nwas a man of great tact, invariable good temper, and superior\r\neducation, whose personal appearance was very like that of\r\nMephistopheles, except that Schurz wore glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Dick Thompson,\" although he knew nothing about the navy\r\ncommitted to his charge, was a silver-tongued Indiana stump speaker.\r\nThe gallant General Devens, of Massachusetts, was to have been\r\nSecretary of War, and ex-Representative G. W. McCrary was to have\r\nbeen Attorney-General.  But this was not satisfactory to the agents\r\nof the New Idria Company, as Mr. McCrary had on one occasion\r\nexpressed a favorable opinion on the claim of William McGarrahan\r\nto the quicksilver mine of which the New Idria had obtained\r\npossession.  So a pressure was brought to bear upon the President,\r\nthe result of which was the transposition of Devens and McCrary.\r\nThe soldier was made Attorney-General, and the country lawyer,\r\nignorant of military matters, was made Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet met on Tuesdays and Fridays.  The members dropped in\r\none by one, but they were all on hand by \"high twelve,\" each bringing\r\nhis portfolio containing matters to be submitted.  President Hayes\r\nsat at the head of the table and Secretary Schurz at the foot; on\r\nthe right, next to the President, was the Secretary of State, next\r\nto him the Secretary of War, and beyond him the Postmaster-General.\r\nOn the left, next to the President, was the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, the next to him the Secretary of the Navy, and next to\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, on that side, the Attorney-General.\r\nAfter the Cabinet met it was ten or fifteen minutes before the\r\nmembers got to work.  That ten minutes was taken up in greetings\r\nand off-hand talk, in which the spirit of fun and humor cropped\r\nout a good deal.  When out of official harness, the members of the\r\nCabinet were all men with a sunny, fun-loving side.  Judge Key was,\r\nperhaps, the jolliest, though the Attorney-General pushed him hard\r\nfor that distinction.  Secretary Thompson was a proverbial lover\r\nof a pleasant joke, while Secretary Schurz was hardly equalled in\r\ntelling one.  Secretary McCrary was a good story-teller.  Secretary\r\nSherman did not indulge in humor often, but when he did it was, on\r\naccount of its unexpected character, the more enjoyable.  Secretary\r\nEvarts was a quiet humorist, and his fund of dry humor and wit was\r\ninexhaustible.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet jokes always found their way into public circulation\r\nand provoked many hearty laughs.  It was intimated that Attorney-\r\nGeneral Devens delighted in joking the \"Ancient Mariner\" of the\r\nNavy Department.  One day Secretary Thompson presented to the\r\nCabinet a list of midshipmen who had passed their examinations.\r\nThe Secretary called attention to them, and said he would like to\r\nhave their nominations for promotion to ensigns sent to the Senate\r\nas soon as possible, \"as they are worthy young men who have thoroughly\r\nearned their spurs.\"  \"Mr. Thompson,\" interrupted Mr. Devens, \"how\r\nlong since have they been wearing spurs in the navy?\"  After ten\r\nminutes of so of boy's play before school, the President would call\r\nthe meeting to order.  The Secretary of State would present his\r\nbudget, and when disposed of he would be followed by the other\r\nmembers of the Cabinet in their order of precedence.  The meetings\r\ngenerally occupied about two hours, and the business was conducted\r\nin a conversational way.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Mr. Hayes that he felt obliged to appoint\r\nas his private secretary Mr. Rodgers, of Minnesota.  It was understood\r\nat Washington that he had been unsuccessful in several business\r\noperations, and he certainly was a failure as private secretary.\r\nInstead of smoothing down the variety of little grievances that\r\narose between the President and the politicians, he invariably made\r\nmatters worse.  The consequence was that the President was often\r\nseen in an unfavorable light by Congressmen, correspondents, and\r\nothers whose good opinions he merited.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Sincerely\r\n  R.B.Hayes\r\nRUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES was born at Delaware, Ohio, October 4th,\r\n1822; studied law, and commenced practice at Cincinnati; served in\r\nthe Union Army receiving promotion from the rank of Major to that\r\nof Brigadier-General, 1862-1865; was a Representative in Congress\r\nfrom Ohio from December 4th, 1865, to December, 1867, when he\r\nresigned, having been elected Governor of Ohio, serving 1868-1872,\r\nand again 1876-1877; was elected President of the United States on\r\nthe Republican ticket in 1876, and was inaugurated March 5th, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nA NEW ERA IN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nRutherford B. Hayes had not entered upon his fifty-fifth year when\r\nhe was inaugurated as President.  He was a well-built man, of\r\nstalwart frame, with an open countenance ruddy with health, kind\r\nblue eyes, a full, sandy beard in which there were a few silver\r\nthreads, a well-shaped mouth, and a smile on his lips.  He had\r\nserved gallantly in the army and creditably in Congress, without\r\nhaving contracted any bad habits or made any personal enemies.\r\nHis manners were courteous; he bore himself with dignity, yet was\r\naffable to all; quick in speech, but open as the day.  Politicians\r\ndid not always obtain the places which they imperiously demanded\r\nfor themselves or for their henchmen, and he refused to acknowledge\r\nthat some who had busied themselves about the Southern electoral\r\nvotes had claims on him which he was to repay by appointments to\r\noffice.  Impassive, non-committal, and always able to clothe his\r\nthoughts in an impenetrable garment of well-chosen words, applicants\r\nfor place rarely obtained positive assurances that their prayers\r\nwould be granted, but they hoped for the best, thinking that\r\n\r\n  \"The King is kind, and, well we know, the King\r\n   Knowest what time to promise, when to pay.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes exercised a greater influence over public affairs than\r\nany lady had since Dolly Madison presided over the White House.\r\nTall, robust, and with a dignified figure, the whole expression of\r\nher face, from the broad forehead, which showed below her hair,\r\nworn in the old-fashioned style, to the firm mouth and modest chin,\r\nbespoke the thoughtful, well-balanced, matronly woman.  She had\r\nsuch a bright, animated face that nothing seemed lacking to complete\r\nthe favorable impression she made upon every one who came under\r\nthe influence of her radiant smile.  That smile was the reflection\r\nof a sunny disposition and a nature at rest with itself.  She and\r\nher husband looked like a couple who lay down at night to peaceful\r\nslumbers, undisturbed by nervous dreams of ambition, and awoke in\r\nthe morning refreshed and well prepared for the duties of the new\r\nday, which never found them fretted or flurried.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes brought with her from her rural home what was known as\r\n\"the Ohio idea\" of total abstinence from intoxicating drinks, and\r\nshe enforced it at the White House, somewhat to the annoyance of\r\nMr. Evarts, who, as Secretary of State, refused to permit the\r\nDiplomatic Corps to be invited to their customary annual dinner\r\nunless wine could be on the table.  This Mrs. Hayes refused to\r\nallow, and all of the state dinners served while she presided over\r\nthe hospitalities of the White House were ostensibly strictly\r\ntemperance banquets, although the steward managed to gratify those\r\nfond of something stronger than lemonade.  True, no wine glasses\r\nobtruded themselves, no popping of champagne corks was heard, no\r\nodor of liquor tainted the air fragrant with the perfume of innocent,\r\nbeautiful flowers.  The table groaned with delicacies; there were\r\nmany devices of the confectioner which called forth admiration.\r\nMany wondered why oranges seemed to be altogether preferred, and\r\nthe waiters were kept busy replenishing salvers upon which the\r\ntropical fruit lay.  Glances telegraphed to one another that the\r\nmissing link was found, and that, concealed within the oranges,\r\nwas delicious frozen punch, a large ingredient of which was strong\r\nold Santa Croix rum.  Thenceforth (without the knowledge of Mrs.\r\nHayes, of course) Roman punch was served about the middle of the\r\nstate dinners, care being taken to give the glasses containing the\r\nstrongest mixture to those who were longing for some potent beverage.\r\nThis phase of the dinner was named by those who enjoyed it \"the\r\nLife-Saving Station.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Grant had always denounced the White House as not suitable\r\nfor a President's residence, Mrs. Hayes was charmed with it.  She\r\nonce took an old friend through it, showed him the rooms, and\r\nexclaimed:  \"No matter what they build, they will never build any\r\nmore rooms like these!\"  She had the lumber rooms ransacked, and\r\nold china and furniture brought out and renovated, and, when it\r\nwas possible, ascertained its history.  Every evening after dinner\r\nshe had an informal reception, friends dropping in and leaving at\r\ntheir will, and enjoying her pleasant conversation.  Often her rich\r\nvoice would be heard leading the song of praise, while the deep,\r\nclear bass notes of Vice-President Wheeler rounded up the melody.\r\nShe almost always had one or two young ladies as her guests, and\r\nshe carried out the official programme of receptions to the letter.\r\n\r\nWhile the President was earnestly endeavoring to restore peace at\r\nthe South and to reform political abuses at the North, Mrs. Hayes\r\nwas none the less active in inaugurating a new social policy.  One\r\nof the evils attendant upon the \"gilded era\" of the war and the\r\nflush times that followed was the universal desire of every one in\r\nWashington to be in \"society.\"  The maiden from New Hampshire, who\r\ncounted currency in the Treasury Department for nine hundred dollars\r\na year; the young student from Wisconsin, who received twelve\r\nhundred dollars per annum for his services as a copyist in the\r\nGeneral Land Office; the janitor of the Circumlocution Bureau, and\r\nthe energetic correspondent of the _Cranberry Centre Gazette_, each\r\nand all thought that they should dine at the foreign legations,\r\nsup with the members of the Cabinet, and mingle in the mazes of\r\nthe \"German\" with the families of the Senators.  The discrepancy\r\nin income or education made no difference in their minds, and to\r\nadmit either would be to acknowledge a social inferiority that\r\nwould have been unsupportable.  But while some of them, by their\r\npersistency, wriggled into \"society,\" the stern reality remained\r\nthat their compensations did not increase, because their owners\r\nsillily diminished them in what they called, maintaining their\r\nsocial position.  \"Vanity Fair\" no longer existed, and the shoddy\r\nmagnates no longer furnished champagne and terrapin suppers for\r\nfashionable crowds, regardless as to who composed those crowds;\r\nthe strugglers for social position retired into modest quietude,\r\nand no longer aspired to be ranked among those in \"society.\"\r\n\r\nThe people one met at the White House and in society, after the\r\ninauguration of President Hayes, were an improvement on those who\r\nhad figured there since the war.  One seldom saw those shoddy and\r\nveneer men and women who had neither tradition nor mental culture\r\nfrom which to draw the manner and habit of politeness.  They lacked\r\nthe sturdy self-respect of the New England mechanic, the independent\r\ndignity of the Western farmers, or the business-like ease of the\r\nNew York merchants, but they evidently felt that their investments\r\nshould command them respect, and they severely looked down upon\r\n\"them literary fellers,\" and others with small bank accounts.  In\r\nthe place of these upstarts there were cultivated gentlemen and\r\nladies, who could converse sensibly upon the topics of the day,\r\nand if there were neither punch-bowls nor champagne glasses on the\r\nsupper-table, there were fewer aching heads the next day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes, while blessed with worldly abundance, showed no desire\r\nto initiate the extravagances or the follies of European aristocracy.\r\nThe example she set was soon followed, and her pleasant expression\r\nand manners, retaining the ready responsiveness of youth, while\r\nadding the wide sympathies of experience, won for her the respect\r\nof even those devotees of fashion who at first laughed about her\r\nplainly arranged hair and her high-neck black silk dresses.  Lofty\r\nstructures of paupers' hair, elaborately frizzled, were seldom seen\r\non sensible women's heads, nor were the party dresses cut so\r\nshamefully low in the neck as to generously display robust maturity\r\nor scraggy leanness.  It cannot be denied that fear of women and\r\nnot love of man makes the fair sex submit to the tyranny of the\r\nfashions, and Mrs. Hayes having emancipated herself, the emancipation\r\nsoon became general.  While, however, \"the first lady of the land\"\r\ndiscarded the vulgar extravagances which had become common at\r\nWashington, she by no means held herself superior to the obligation\r\nof dress, and of the pleasant little artificial graces belonging\r\nto high civilization.  Some of her evening dresses were elegant,\r\nthe colors harmonizing, and the style picturesque and becoming.\r\nIf she had the good taste not to disfigure her classically-shaped\r\nhead, or to load herself with flashy jewelry, so much the better.\r\n\r\nProminent among the festivities at the White House during the Hayes\r\nAdministration was the silver-wedding of the President and his\r\nwife, which was the first celebration of the kind that had ever\r\noccurred there.  The vestibule, the halls, and the state apartments\r\nwere elaborately trimmed with bunting and running vines.  In the\r\nEast Room, at the doors, and in the corners and alcoves tropical\r\nplants were clustered in profusion.  The mantles were banked with\r\nbright-colored cut flowers, smilax was entwined in the huge glass\r\nchandeliers, and elsewhere throughout the room were stands of potted\r\nplants.  Over the main entrance was the National coat-of-arms, and\r\njust opposite two immense flags, hanging from ceiling to floor,\r\ncompletely covered the large window.  The Green, the Red, and the\r\nBlue Parlors were similarly decorated, the flowers used being\r\nchiefly azalias, hyacinths, and roses.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet and their families were the only official\r\npersonages invited to this celebration, and with them were a few\r\nold friends from Ohio connected with the President's past life and\r\npursuits.  A delegation of the regiment which he commanded, the\r\nTwenty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, brought a beautiful silver\r\noffering.  Among the President's schoolmates was Mr. Deshla, of\r\nColumbus, who said:  \"I knew him when we called him 'Rud,' when he\r\nwas called 'Mr. Hayes,' then 'Colonel Hayes,' and 'General Hayes,'\r\nthen 'Governor Hayes,' and now that he is President we are equally\r\ngood friends.\"  The guests promenaded through the parlors, and\r\nengaged in conversation, the Marine Band playing at intervals.\r\n\r\nPrecisely at nine o'clock the band struck Mendelssohn's Wedding\r\nMarch, and President Hayes, with his wife on his arm, came down-\r\nstairs, followed by members of the family and the special guests,\r\ntwo by two.  The procession passed through the inner vestibule into\r\nthe East Room, where the President and Mrs. Hayes stationed\r\nthemselves, with their backs to the flag-draped central window,\r\nand there remained until the invited guests had paid their\r\ncongratulations.  Mrs. Mitchell, the daughter of the President's\r\nsister, Mrs. Platt, stood next Mrs. Hayes and clasped her hand, as\r\nshe did when a little child, during the marriage ceremony twenty-\r\nfive years back.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes wore a white silk dress, with draperies of white brocade,\r\neach headed with two rows of tasseled fringe, and with a full\r\nplaiting at the sides and bottom of the front breadth; the heart-\r\nshaped neck was filled in with tulle, and the half-long sleeves\r\nhad a deep ruching of lace.  Her hair, in plain braids, was knotted\r\nat the back and fastened with a silver comb, while long white kid\r\ngloves and white slippers completed the bridal array.  On the day\r\nprevious, which was the actual anniversary, Mrs. Hayes had worn\r\nher wedding dress, making no alterations save in letting out the\r\nseams.  It was a flowered satin, made when ten or twelve breadths\r\nof silk were put in a skirt, and there was no semblance of a train\r\nappended thereto.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. McCabe, who had married Mr. Hayes and Miss Webb twenty-\r\nfive years before, was present, with Mrs. Herron, who was at the\r\nwedding, and who was a guest at the White House.  She had an infant\r\ndaughter, six weeks old, with her, which was christened on the day\r\nprevious Lucy Hayes.  After the happy couple had been congratulated,\r\nthe President and Mrs. Hayes led the way into the state dining-\r\nroom, which had been elaborately decked for the occasion with cut\r\nflowers and plants.  The table was adorned with pyramids of\r\nconfectionery, fancy French dishes and ices in molds, the bill of\r\nfare including every delicacy in the way of eatables, but no beverage\r\nexcept coffee.  At midnight, when the guns announced the birth of\r\na new year, congratulations and good wishes were exchanged, and\r\nthen the company dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe gossips had much to say about the petition of the venerable ex-\r\nSenator Christiancy for a divorce from a young Washington woman,\r\nwho was a clerk in the Treasury Department when he married her.\r\nThe irascible, jealous old man magnified trifling circumstances\r\ninto startling facts, and deliberately attempted to brand his young\r\nwife with infamy.  She may have been foolish, she may have said or\r\ndone what was not wise, but those who knew her well asserted that\r\nshe had given no cause for the terrible accusations brought against\r\nher by the man who persuaded her to become his wife, and who proved\r\nthe truth of the proverb, that \"There is no fool like an old fool.\"\r\nHis resignation of his seat in the Senate to accept a diplomatic\r\nappointment, that Mr. Zach. Chandler might return to it, was said\r\nto have been anything but creditable to him, although profitable.\r\n\r\nWashington society was also kept in hot water by the young secretaries\r\nand attaches of foreign legations, who prided themselves on their\r\nsuccess in breaking hearts.  There were two classes of these foreign\r\nlady-killers.  Those of the Castilian type had closely cropped,\r\ncoal-black hair, smooth faces, with the exception of a moustache,\r\nand flashing eyes that betrayed an intriguing disposition.  The\r\nSaxons (including the British, the Germans, and the Russians) were\r\ntall, slender fellows, with their hair parted in the middle, soft\r\neyes, and downy side-whiskers.  Both sets were exquisitely polite,\r\ncourteous in their deportment, and very deferential to those with\r\nwhom they conversed.  They stigmatized a residence in Washington\r\nafter their sojourn at the various capitals of Europe as unendurable;\r\nthey intimated that the women of America were \"incomplete\" and\r\n\"fastidious,\" but their criticisms were so courteous that no one\r\ncould muster heart to contradict them.  Every year or two, though,\r\nsome poor girl was captivated by the glitter of their small talk,\r\nand got more or less scorched before she could be extricated.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  W. M. Evarts\r\nWILLIAM MAXWELL EVARTS was born at Boston, February 6th, 1818; was\r\ngraduated at Yale College in 1837; studied in the Harvard Law\r\nSchool, and was admitted to the bar in New York in 1841; was Attorney-\r\nGeneral of the United States, July 15th, 1868 - March 3d, 1869;\r\nwas counsel for President Johnson on his trial upon his impeachment\r\nin 1868; was counsel for the United States before the Alabama Claims\r\nTribunal at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1872; was counsel for President\r\nHayes in behalf of the Republican party before the Electoral\r\nCommission; was Secretary of State of the United States, March\r\n12th, 1877 - March 3d, 1881; and was a United States Senator from\r\nMarch 4th, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nLEADERS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\nFourteen years after the surrender of Appomattox, the Republicans\r\nsurrendered in the Capitol at Washington and passed into the\r\nminority.  President Grant having failed in his severe Southern\r\npolicy, President Hayes tried conciliation.  Never did a President\r\nenter upon his duties with more sincere good-will for every section.\r\nThere was displayed in every act of the incoming Administration a\r\nkindliness toward Southern men and Southern interests that almost\r\naroused a jealousy in the North.  It was not an affectation on the\r\npart of the President, but a true and honest sentiment.  The good-\r\nwill experiment was not quickly made.  It took a long time to\r\ndetermine results, and even after the uncompromising spirit of the\r\nSouthern Democrats had become apparent President Hayes was slow to\r\npronounce the plan a failure.  It had seemed to him the only hope\r\nof making the South peaceful and prosperous, and he had determined\r\nto give it a full trial.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Democrats would have in the Senate of the\r\nForty-sixth Congress that majority that had passed from them in\r\nthat body when many of its curule chairs were vacated by those who\r\nwent into the Rebellion.  The Democrats in the House of the Forty-\r\nfifth Congress, by refusing to make the necessary appropriation\r\nfor the support of the army, rendered an extra session necessary.\r\nWhen Congress met, on the 18th of March, 1879, the Democrats had\r\na majority of ten in the Senate, and over twenty in the House.\r\n\r\nAllen G. Thurman, of Ohio, was recognized by the Democrats in the\r\nSenate as their leader.  He was a broad-shouldered, sturdily built\r\nman, with a large square head and ruddy complexion, gray hair and\r\nbeard, and a positive manner that commanded respect.  Earnest,\r\noutspoken, and free in his criticisms of men and manners, he would\r\nwave his red bandana pocket handkerchief like a guidon, give his\r\nnose a trumpet-blast, take a fresh pinch of snuff, and dash into\r\nthe debate, dealing rough blows, and scattering the carefully\r\nprepared arguments of his adversaries like chaff.  When he sat down\r\nhe would signal to a Republican friend, and they would leave the\r\nSenate Chamber by different doors and meet in a committee-room,\r\nwhere there was a supply of old Bourbon whisky.\r\n\r\nSenator Bayard, of Delaware, who was also prominent in the Democratic\r\nranks, never forgot that he was the descendant of a long line of\r\neminent statesmen.  Tall and straight, his movements were graceful,\r\nand his cleanly shaven face and iron-gray hair were classic in\r\nbeauty.  Broad in intellect, he was patient and courteous in debate,\r\nrarely losing his dignity or his temper.\r\n\r\nSenator Beck, of Kentucky, enjoyed the rare advantage of being\r\nineligible to the Presidential chair, and he did not consequently\r\nfeel hampered by what he might add in debate to his \"record.\"  He\r\nwas a stalwart, farmer-like looking man, with that overcharged\r\nbrain which made his tongue at times falter because he could not\r\nutter what his furious, fiery eloquence prompted.  Entirely different\r\nin personal appearance and manner was Senator Pendleton, of Ohio,\r\nwhose courteous deportment had won him the appellation of \"Gentleman\r\nGeorge,\" and who adorned every subject on which he spoke.  Senator\r\nSaulsbury, of Delaware, a spare, grim, uncompromising bachelor,\r\nwith a tall, slender figure like that of Thomas Jefferson, would\r\nhave made a glorious Puritan leader, and Senator Pinckney Whyte,\r\nof Maryland, a gentleman by birth and education, was evidently\r\nrestive at times under the political restraint of the party \"bosses\"\r\nin his State.\r\n\r\nSenator Cockrell, of Missouri, was an able lawyer, who had the good\r\nsense not to parade his gallant services in the Confederate army,\r\nand who was ever on the watch for some extravagant appropriation.\r\nHe, with Ransom, of North Carolina, and other Confederate brigadiers,\r\nsaw opposite to them, as their equal, Senator Bruce, of Mississippi,\r\nround-faced, bright-eyed, and sepia-hued, the emancipated slave\r\nwho had reached the full stature of citizenship through the flame\r\nof battle that discomfited them.\r\n\r\nAnother eloquent debater was Senator Lamar, of Mississippi, whose\r\ninfluence in molding public opinion at the South had been as healthy\r\nas it had been powerful.  Senator Vest, youthful in appearance,\r\nwas a fiery speaker, and always ready for a tilt with an opponent.\r\nThe swarthy features of Senator Logan, of Illinois, with his long,\r\ncoal-black hair and moustache, stood out like a charcoal sketch\r\nagainst the gilded wall of the Senate, and he seemed as ready to\r\nmeet his political opponents as he had been at the head of his\r\nbrigade to charge the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Senate Chamber the _pater Senatus_ was\r\nGovernor Anthony, of Rhode Island, a man of gracious presence and\r\nkind heart, whose eyes were dimmed, but who had not lost the fire\r\nand brilliancy which had characterized his early editorial and\r\nSenatorial life.  Senator Hamlin, of Maine, was the eldest in years\r\non the floor, and yet he did not display the first sign of the\r\nweakness of advancing age.  Tall, slightly round-shouldered, always\r\nwearing a black dress coat, and never an overcoat, he was a remarkably\r\nwell-preserved man.  His forehead was somewhat wrinkled, his black\r\neyes gleamed with vigorous vitality, and his large mouth, with its\r\nmassive under jaw, was not concealed by a moustache or beard.  He\r\nrarely spoke, but when he took the floor he always had something\r\nto say worth hearing, and he was always listened to.\r\n\r\nSenator Edmunds, of Vermont, was an able man and a good lawyer,\r\nremarkably well posted in the current literature of the day.\r\nAnother man learned in the law was the ponderous Senator Davis, of\r\nIllinois, who had left the Supreme Court for the Senate, thinking\r\nit was the better avenue to the White House, and whose political\r\nviews were bounded by his personal ambition.\r\n\r\nSenator Conkling, of New York, was then at the height of his\r\nbrilliant Congressional career.  Able, high-bred, and stately, he\r\nhad defeated his home rival, Fenton, and he now claimed the disposal\r\nof the New York patronage that he might use it to secure the re-\r\nelection of General Grant, to be followed by his own elevation to\r\nthe Presidential chair.  The words, \"conciliation of enemies,\" were\r\nnot in his vocabulary, yet no Senator had so many tried and trusty\r\nfriends.  Another prominent lawyer was Matt. Carpenter, of Wisconsin,\r\none side of whom as described by Charles Sumner when he called him\r\na \"jester,\" while Mr. Edmunds, by a ready pun, as aptly described\r\nthe other side of him by declaring that the Senator from Massachusetts\r\nprobably meant a \"sug-gester.\"  Retaining the dragoon swagger,\r\nwhich he had acquired at West Point, a jovial nature, indifferent\r\nto the decorum of public life, he seemed to have been tossed into\r\nthe Senate, where other people had with difficulty found their way\r\nby hard climbing or by costly purchase.\r\n\r\nSenator Ingalls, of Kansas, whose remarks were a stream of epigram,\r\neloquence, and euphony, delicately flavored with sarcasm, often\r\nshowed a keen appreciation of the ridiculous.  Remarkably well\r\ninformed, and able to command the information in the storehouse of\r\nhis brain, he never ranted, rarely gesticulated, and his ceremoniously\r\npolite excoriations of opponents were like dropping hot lead upon\r\nsore places.  Very different was Senator Burnside, of Rhode Island,\r\nwho was known as the \"Kaiser William,\" and whose martial aspect\r\nindicated his straightforward honesty of purpose.  He was at times\r\nrestive under the trammels of parliamentary rule, and would speak\r\nhis mind, no matter who was troubled thereby.\r\n\r\nSenator Dawes, of Massachusetts, with clean-shaven cheeks and\r\npuritanical earnestness, had been transplanted from the House of\r\nRepresentatives with Senator Allison, of Iowa, a man of rare\r\nfinancial ability, who afterward took a prominent part in the\r\nproceedings of the Senate.  Then there was Senator Plumb, of Kansas,\r\nearnest and straightforward, of whom it was said that he was \"Western\r\nfrom the hem of his short pantaloons to the comfortable slouch of\r\nhis hat.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Blaine, of Maine, was one of the youngest Senators, yet\r\nwhen he rose to speak all listened.  Compactly and strongly built,\r\nwith a commanding figure, prominent features, watchful, gray-hazel\r\neyes, and a rich, manly voice, he was very ready in debate.  When\r\nthe army bill was up, and it was argued that the South was in danger\r\nof intimidation, he showed the absurdity of such a position by\r\ngiving the exact numbers of troops then stationed in each State:\r\n\"And the entire South has eleven hundred and fifty-five soldiers\r\nto intimidate, overrun, oppress, and destroy the liberties of\r\nfifteen million people!  In the Southern States there are twelve\r\nhundred and three counties.  If you distribute the soldiers evenly\r\nthere is not quite one for each county; when I give the counties,\r\nI give them from the census of 1870.  If you distribute them\r\nterritorially, there is one for every seven hundred square miles\r\nof territory, so that if you make a territorial distribution, I\r\nwould remind the honorable Senator from Delaware, if I saw him in\r\nhis seat, that the quota of his State would be three, 'one ragged\r\nsergeant and two abreast,' as the old song has it.  That is the\r\nforce ready to destroy the liberties of Delaware!\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives that sturdy Democratic champion,\r\nSamuel J. Randall, of Philadelphia, was elected Speaker, receiving\r\none hundred and forty-three votes against one hundred and twenty-\r\nfive votes for James A. Garfield, and thirteen votes for Hendrick\r\nB. Wright.  The Democrats were ably led by Carlisle and Blackburn,\r\nof Kentucky; by Morrison and Sparks, of Illinois; by Reagan and\r\nMills, of Texas; by the stately Fernando Wood, of New York, and by\r\nMr. Sam. Cox, who reminded one of those jocular festivities of\r\nmediaeval times, when the Abbot of Misrule took possession of his\r\nmasters and issued his merry orders superciliously to those with\r\nwhose insults his ears were still tingling.\r\n\r\nOn the Republican side were Aldrich, Conger, Frye, Hawley, and\r\nLapham, qualifying themselves for service in the Senate; the burly\r\nRobeson, ready to defend his acts as Secretary of the Navy; Judge\r\nKelley, of Philadelphia, who had come down from a former generation;\r\nRainey and Smalls, emancipated men and brethren; the witty Tom.\r\nReed, of Maine, who was always happy in his sarcasms; the able and\r\neffective Frank Hiscock, of New York, the effective Ben. Butterworth,\r\nof Ohio, with others known to fame, constituting a strong House,\r\nfresh from the people, and bringing their latest will.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Congress again attached to the bill making appropriations\r\nfor the support of the army an irrelevant piece of legislation\r\naimed directly at the purity of the ballot, thinking that the\r\nPresident, who had so evidently desired to conciliate the South,\r\nwould not dare to offend it by refusing his official approval.  To\r\ntheir surprise, he returned the bill to Congress with a veto message,\r\nso dispassionate, yet so entirely covering the case, that it threw\r\nthe Democratic majorities in Congress into confusion, and forced\r\nthem to abandon the programme they had marked out.  They consoled\r\nthemselves by turning out nearly all of the officers of the Senate,\r\nmany of whom were old and faithful servants, and dividing the places\r\nthus made vacant among their relatives and henchmen.\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes, by his succession of vetoes, restored _l'entente\r\ncordiale_ between himself and the greater portion of the Republican\r\nmembers of Congress.  His pure patriotism, his high rectitude of\r\nintention, and his personal virtues had never been doubted, and\r\nwhen he was again found acting in accord with the party that elected\r\nhim, it was believed that he would be carried pleasantly through\r\nhis embarrassing duties, and that his civil success would match\r\nhis exploits in arms.\r\n\r\nThe opera of \"Pinafore\" became all the rage at Washington, as\r\nelsewhere.  It was performed at theatres by church choirs, by\r\namateurs, by a colored company, and finally by some juvenile\r\nvocalists belonging to the very first families at the West End.\r\nGenerally speaking, vocalists, especially of the feminine persuasion,\r\nhave scruples about giving their ages, but on the programmes of\r\nthis company the ages of the performers were printed opposite to\r\ntheir names.  Sir Joseph Porter was personated by Aleck McCormick,\r\na son of Commissioner McCormick, aged twelve; Miss Betty Ordway,\r\naged eleven, was Josephine; Miss Mary Wilson, aged ten, was charming\r\nas Little Buttercup; Willie Wilson, aged eleven, was Captain\r\nCorcoran; Dick Wallack, aged eleven, was a good Ralph Rackstraw,\r\nand Daisy Ricketts, demurely attired as Aunt Ophelia, was primly\r\n\"splendid.\"  The sisters, the cousins, and the aunts, the sailors,\r\nand especially the marine guard, were all represented.  The singing\r\nwas tolerable and the acting generally bad, but the performance\r\nwas nevertheless enjoyed by the crowded audience.  The little people\r\neclipsed the colored choir, and were equal to at least half of the\r\nprofessional combinations.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  RoscoeConkling\r\nROSCOE CONKLING was born at Albany, New York, October 30th, 1829;\r\nstudied law and commenced practice at Utica in 1846; was Mayor of\r\nUtica in 1858; was a Representative in Congress, December 5th, 1859\r\n- March 3d, 1867; was a United States Senator from March 3d, 1867,\r\nuntil his resignation on the 16th of May, 1881; removed to New York\r\nCity, and entered upon the practice of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nTILTS IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the King of Spain was celebrated at Washington by\r\nSenor Mantilla, the Spanish Minister, who gave a magnificent\r\nentertainment at Wormley's Hotel, where he was residing.  The\r\nparlors were decorated with the Minister's own furniture and\r\npaintings, and with a profusion of rare plants and flowers.  The\r\nDiplomatic Corps wore their court costumes, while the officers of\r\nour army and navy appeared in full uniform.  Madame Mantilla was\r\nan Andalusian, and had the clear, creamy complexion, the large,\r\ndark eyes, the black hair, and the fine form which characterizes\r\nthat section of Spain.  The waist of her satin dress was cut square,\r\nbefore and behind, and was very low.  The entire front of her long\r\nskirt of white satin was covered with a network of pearls.  A vest\r\nof similar network trimmed the front of the basque.  Folds of satin\r\nwent across the front of the waist and over the short sleeves, and\r\nat the back fell from the waist in sash ends, edged with pearl\r\nfringe and tassels.  Around her throat she wore a band of dark red\r\nvelvet, studded alternately with diamonds and pearls.  Below,\r\nfalling loosely on the neck, were three strands of pearls with a\r\nmagnificent pendant, composed of an enormous pearl and clusters of\r\ndiamonds.  In her hair sparkled a superb diadem, formed of sprays\r\nof diamonds, presented to the lady by her husband when they were\r\nmarried.  Lace stockings and white satin slippers completed her\r\ntoilet.\r\n\r\nThe supper-table was set along three sides of the room, forming a\r\nhollow square.  In the centre was a mound composed of myrtle, in\r\nwhose bright, green leaves were arranged large and beautifully\r\ncolored California pears and luscious bunches of Malaga grapes and\r\noranges.  A tall silver epergne surmounted the mound, in the centre\r\nof which was a cut-glass basket, holding fruits, and on the sides\r\nvases of flowers.  On the table were numerous silver candelabra\r\nholding lighted wax candles, and, alternating with plants, pyramids\r\nof bonbons, ices, and other dainties.  The table linen, china, and\r\nglass all bore the crest of the hostess.\r\n\r\nMuch ill-breeding had been shown by seekers after invitations, and\r\nthere was a sad exhibition of bad manners at the supper-table.\r\nThe lace on ladies' dresses was torn by the trappings of the\r\ndiplomats and officers, while terrapin and champagne were recklessly\r\nscattered.  With this exception everything passed off very smoothly,\r\nand the hundreds of guests present heartily congratulated the host\r\nand hostess.  President Hayes and his wife declined departing from\r\ntheir rule not to accept hospitalities, but the White House was\r\nwell represented by Mr. Webb Hayes and five young ladies, who were\r\nat that time his mother's guests.\r\n\r\nWith the return of the Democrats to power in Congress came one of\r\nthose great moral struggles which convulses a nation with an\r\nagitation only surpassed by a physical contest between hostile\r\narmies.  The approach of the Presidential contest added to the\r\nacerbity of the debates, although some of the participants evidently\r\nadopted as their motto the Quaker apothegm, \"Treat your enemy as\r\nif you thought he might some day become your friend, and your friend\r\nas though he might become your enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThose who occasionally engaged in criminations and recriminations\r\ndid it in a parliamentary and mild-mannered way, and a few hours\r\nafterward they might have been seen meeting as guests at the same\r\nsocial board, with every mark of reciprocal cordiality and success.\r\nThis was doubtless owing, in many instances, to the legal training\r\nof the gentlemen who had been accustomed to bandy epithets and to\r\nbully their adversaries before juries, and having thus earned their\r\nfees, to leave the court, arm in arm, to dine harmoniously together.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting tilts in the Senate was between Matt.\r\nCarpenter and James G. Blaine, on the Geneva Award question.  Mr.\r\nCarpenter was then approaching death's door, and his feeble voice\r\nwas at times inaudible in the galleries, but his argument sustained\r\nhis reputation as an advocate and as a Senator.  Looking at everything\r\nfrom a judicial standpoint, and manifesting (if he did not express\r\nit) a profound contempt for non-professional men who discuss legal\r\nquestions, he displayed great ingenuity and persuasive eloquence\r\nin the presentation of his views.  He had evidently studied his\r\ncase carefully, but he did not hesitate to make strong assertions\r\ntake the place of authorities, and to base his arguments on those\r\nassertions.  The entire speech was peppered with cutting allusions\r\nto Blaine, who sat unmoved, occasionally joining in the laugh\r\nprovoked at his expense.  Carpenter concluded with an eloquent\r\nallusion to General Grant, as one first in war, first in peace,\r\nfirst in the hearts of his countrymen and of all mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen Blaine finally took the floor it was soon evident that he had\r\nstudied the weak points in what Carpenter had said, and was ready\r\nto let fly a volley of satire-tipped arrows with deadly aim.  His\r\nsentences were terse, crisp, strong, and entirely without ornamentation,\r\nbut every one told.  He began by alluding to his having been often\r\nreminded in the debate that he was not a lawyer.  The wit would\r\nhave been brighter and the thrust would have been keener had it\r\nbeen stated that when he set out on the vast sea of adventure he\r\nhad studied law for two years.\r\n\r\nAfter elaborately reviewing the case and citing many authorities,\r\nhe concluded by alluding to a proposition that the balance of the\r\naward be retained in the Treasury.  \"This,\" he said, \"would disgrace\r\nus in the eyes of the civilized world, by virtually admitting that\r\nour legitimate claims did not amount to anything approaching the\r\nsum which we demanded and obtained.  The excuse made for the\r\nnotoriously unjust Halifax award was that we had obtained a large\r\nsum under false pretenses, and that an offset should be made.  Pass\r\naround the hat, ask alms if you will, but don't acknowledge that\r\nwe received this Geneva award under false pretenses.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of Mr. Blaine's remarks his well-modulated\r\nvoice assumed a conversational tone, tinged with sarcastic bitterness\r\nas he occasionally indulged in bantering allusions to his lack of\r\nlegal education.  As he proceeded he became more impressive in\r\nwords and action, and before he had concluded he had advanced\r\nbetween the desks into the centre aisle, where, with head erect\r\nand sweeping gestures, he poured forth a flood of stirring eloquence,\r\neliciting repeated applause.\r\n\r\nMr. Carpenter attempted to reply and to criticize humorously some\r\nof Mr. Blaine's assertions, but he was not very successful.  He\r\nsaid that his long training at the bar had taught him never to\r\nprovoke a quarrel, and never to leave one unless successful.  The\r\nSenator from Maine began this, and he should follow it.  The Senator\r\nwill never be able to say he has piped to me and I have not danced.\r\nMr. Blaine made a happy retort, speaking of General Grant in the\r\nhighest terms, and rivaling Mr. Carpenter in his eulogiums of him.\r\nThis prompted Mr. Thurman, who next took the floor to say:  \"The\r\nSenators have both indorsed the third term,\" which provoked such\r\nrounds of applause that the presiding officer threatened to have\r\nthe galleries cleared.\r\n\r\nA more serious personal altercation occurred in an executive session,\r\nbetween General Gordon, of Georgia, then the personal defender of\r\nPresident Hayes, and Senator Conkling.  General Gordon felt sore\r\nbecause he had failed to secure the entire Democratic vote of the\r\nSenate for the confirmation of some important New York nomination,\r\nand he regarded Senator Conkling as having defeated this scheme.\r\nThe Senator from New York could not brook the interference of\r\nGeneral Gordon in what he considered a family quarrel, and the two\r\nhad not regarded each other for some days with looks of love.\r\nTrouble was brewing evidently.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate was in executive session one Friday afternoon,\r\nGovernor Anthony occupying the chair, there was a warm discussion\r\nover the nomination of Ward, a Georgia internal revenue collector,\r\nin which some allusions were made to the New York case.  When this\r\nhad been disposed of, General Gordon interrupted the calendar to\r\ncall for a report on the nomination of Smith, Collector of the\r\nCustoms at Mobile, and while he was speaking, Senator Conkling,\r\nlooking up from his letter writing, called out loudly, \"Go on with\r\nthe calendar.\"  Gordon immediately said:  \"Mr. President, the\r\nSenator from New York is not in the chair, but he orders the Chair\r\nto go on with the calendar.\"  Several names had been called for\r\naction when Gordon made this remark.  Conkling was busy reading at\r\nthe moment, and did not hear it, but his attention was called to\r\nit by a Senator who sat near him.  Springing to his feet, Conkling\r\nasked what the Senator from Georgia had said concerning him.  Gordon\r\nimmediately repeated the language.  Conkling said:  \"If the Senator\r\nfrom Georgia says I ordered the Chair to go on with the calendar\r\nhe states what is not true.\"  Gordon replied:  \"Very well, we will\r\nsettle that hereafter.\"  Conkling retorted:  \"We will settle it\r\nhere,\" and repeated what he said before.  Mr. Gordon then again\r\nsaid:  \"We will not settle it here, but elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed that Senators Hamlin and Howe, as friends of\r\nMr. Conkling, and Senators Ransom and McDonald, as friends of\r\nGeneral Gordon, should endeavor to adjust the difficulty.  The\r\nquartette sat in deliberation until one o'clock on Friday night,\r\nand met again at ten o'clock on Saturday morning, finally agreeing\r\nin the afternoon upon the adroitly drawn up statement made public,\r\nafter which \"all was quiet upon the Potomac.\"  It is not true that\r\nany communication passed between the parties, although it is known\r\nthat Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi, counseled General Gordon, and that\r\nSenator Jones, of Nevada, and General Phil. Sheridan were the\r\nadvisers of Senator Conkling.\r\n\r\nA more dramatic incident occurred in a debate, when Senator Voorhees,\r\nof Indiana, upbraided Senator Mahone, of Virginia, for acting with\r\nthe Republicans.  When he had concluded the Virginian calmly said\r\nthat this denunciation of him must stop, and asked whether the\r\nSenator from Indiana adopted the phrase, \"renegade Democrat,\" in\r\na document which he had caused to be read as a part of his speech.\r\n\"Mr. President,\" retorted Mr. Voorhees, with a defiant air and a\r\ncontemptuous gesture, \"I indorse every sentiment and word in that\r\narticle.  I make it my speech.  I indorse the word 'renegade' in\r\nit.  I indorse every criticism on the course of the Senator from\r\nVirginia.  He need waste no time in putting words into my mouth.\r\nHe said this must stop.  No one can stop me.  That is cheap--very\r\ncheap.\"  A profound stillness had fallen upon the chamber when\r\nMahone first arose.  The silence became painful now.  Mahone had\r\nremained standing, calmly waiting for Voorhees' reply, the Indiana\r\nSenator towering over his Virginia antagonist like a giant, when\r\nMahone, in a low voice that could be heard in the remotest corners\r\nof the chamber, said:  \"That is an assertion that no brave or\r\nhonorable man would make.  I denounce it as such.  Let him take\r\nthat and wear it.\"  The preliminary conditions of the code were\r\nsatisfied.  The insult had been offered by Voorhees.  The challenging\r\nwords had been spoken by Mahone.  The incident ended there, and\r\nthe Senate, taking a long breath after its eight hours of strife\r\nand passion, adjourned until the following Monday.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes, instead of frittering away the liberal appropriations\r\nmade by Congress for the domestic wants of the White House, expended\r\na large share of them in the purchase of a state dinner service of\r\nnearly one thousand pieces, illustrating the fauna and flora of\r\nthe United States.  The designs were executed by Mr. Theodore R.\r\nDavis, who had fished in the rivers of the East and West and in\r\nthe sea, hunted fowl and wild game in the forests, the swamps, and\r\nthe mountains, shot the buffalo on the plains and visited the\r\nhistoric haunts of the Indians in the East, met the Indians in\r\ntheir wigwams and studied their habits on the prairies of the far\r\nWest.  The designs were made in water colors, and although in nearly\r\nevery instance they were bold and striking, they were difficult to\r\nreproduce perfectly upon porcelain with hard mineral colors, and\r\nto accomplish this successfully it was necessary to invent new\r\nmethods and to have recourse to peculiar mechanical appliances,\r\nbut the effort was successful and the set was produced.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  John Sherman\r\nJOHN SHERMAN was born at Lancaster, Ohio, May 10th, 1823; studied\r\nlaw; was admitted to the bar, May 11th, 1844; was a Representative\r\nin Congress, December 3d, 1855 - March 3d, 1861; was United States\r\nSenator from Ohio, March 4th, 1861 to March 8th, 1877, when he\r\nresigned; was Secretary of the Treasury under President Hayes,\r\nMarch 9th, 1877 - March 4th, 1881; was again United States Senator,\r\nMarch 4th, 1881; and was elected President _pro tempore_ of the\r\nSenate after the death of Vice-President Hendricks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION.\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant returned from his trip around the world, the\r\nBlaine newspapers, while they filled their columns with adulatory\r\nnotices of the \"Old Commander,\" also discovered in the \"Plumed\r\nKnight\" qualities which inspired them with enthusiasm and admiration.\r\nThe friends of General Grant were not, however, to be placed in an\r\nattitude of antagonism toward Blaine.  They remembered, however,\r\nthat when Grant retired from the political contest in 1876, and\r\nhis friends turned toward Blaine, they found confronting them,\r\narmed with the poisoned arrows of detraction, the same editors who\r\nhad for years been opposing and vilifying Grant.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was then made by Mr. Blaine's friends to place General\r\nGrant at the head of a scheme for the construction of a ship canal\r\nacross the Isthmus as an American enterprise.  They enlisted one\r\nof Grant's most devoted friends, Read Admiral Daniel Ammen, and he\r\nattempted to organize a company, of which General Grant was to be\r\nthe president.  The charter to be granted by Congress was to\r\nrecognize the national character of the work, and to pledge the\r\nUnited States to oppose any foreign interference, like that of\r\nDeLesseps and his Darien Canal.  General Grant became interested\r\nin the scheme, and affixed his name a few months later to an\r\nelaborate magazine article on inter-oceanic canals, every word of\r\nwhich was written by Dr. George B. Loring, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSenator Blaine developed great personal popularity as the campaign\r\nprogressed, even among those who regarded General Grant as a\r\n\"military necessity.\"  Henry Clay, in his palmiest days, never had\r\na more devoted and enthusiastic following, and many of the stanchest\r\nand most stalwart Republicans in Congress were openly for Blaine,\r\nwhile others secretly advocated his claims.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman had also a powerful following, and while the respective\r\nfriends of Grant and Blaine began to indulge in recrimination, the\r\ncause of the Ohio Senator was quietly pushed without giving offense.\r\nMr. Sherman's unswerving persistence had, in years past, all the\r\neffective energy and the successful result of force.  General\r\nGarfield was at the head of the Ohio delegation, pledged to the\r\nsupport of Sherman, and he was chosen to make the speech nominating\r\nhim in the Convention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield having been requested to give his views as to what\r\nshould be the course of the Ohio Republicans in reference to the\r\nPresidential nomination, wrote a letter in which he said:  \"I have\r\nno doubt that a decisive majority of our party in Ohio favor the\r\nnomination of John Sherman.  He has earned his recognition at their\r\nhands by twenty-five years of conspicuous public service, a period\r\nwhich embraces nearly the whole life of the Republican party.  He\r\ndeserves the especial recognition of the nation for the great\r\nservice he has rendered in making the resumption law a success,\r\nand placing the national finances on a better basis.  I am aware\r\nof the fact that some Republicans do not indorse all his opinions,\r\nbut no man who has opinions can expect the universal concurrence\r\nof his party in all his views, and no man without opinions is worthy\r\nof the support of a great party.  I hope the Republicans of Ohio\r\nwill make no mistake on other candidates; they should fairly and\r\ngenerously recognize the merits of all; but I think they ought to\r\npresent the name of Mr. Sherman to the National Convention and give\r\nhim their united and cordial support.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Wharton Baker, of Philadelphia, General Garfield wrote:\r\n\"It is becoming every day more apparent that the friends of the\r\nleading Presidential candidates are becoming embittered against\r\neach other to such an extent that, whichever of the three may be\r\nnominated, there would be much hostility of feeling in the conduct\r\nof the campaign.  It will be most unfortunate if we go into the\r\ncontest handicapped by the animosity of the leading politicians.\r\nI shall be glad to see you on your arrival in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield's influence was politically omnipotent in his own\r\ndistrict, yet when the Convention of that district was held to\r\nelect delegates to the Chicago Convention, controlled by Garfield's\r\nfriends and confidential advisers, it surprised the country by\r\nelecting Blaine delegates.  It was then whispered that General\r\nGarfield, while ostensibly working for Sherman, would advocate his\r\nown nomination, and also that he would have the support of the\r\nfriends of Mr. Blaine.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was a remarkable one.  The combined anti-Grant men,\r\nwith cunning parliamentary strategy, carried their points on the\r\nunit rule and the credentials.  When the names of the candidates\r\nwere successively presented by their friends, a tumultuous scene\r\nof wild applause followed the nominations of James G. Blaine and\r\nUlysses S. Grant, the rival hosts on the floor and in the galleries\r\nbeing animated by paroxysms of enthusiasm never before witnessed\r\non this continent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield rose when the State of Ohio was called, and said\r\nthat he had witnessed the extraordinary scenes of the Convention\r\nwith great solicitude.  The assemblage had seemed to him like a\r\nhuman ocean in a tempest.  He had seen the sea lashed into fury\r\nand tossed into spray, and its grandeur moves the soul of the\r\ndullest man; but he remembered that it was not the billows, but\r\nthe calm level of the sea, from which all heights and depths are\r\nmeasured.  When the enthusiasm should have passed away, the calm\r\nlevel of public opinion would be found, from which the thoughts of\r\na mighty people would be measured.  Not at Chicago in the heat of\r\nJune, but at the ballot-boxes in the quiet of November, would the\r\nquestion be settled.  \"And now, gentlemen of the Convention,\" said\r\nhe, \"what do we want?\"  \"We want Garfield,\" said a clear voice;\r\nand from that moment it was evident who the \"dark horse\" was, and\r\nhis cold, studied eulogium of John Sherman was really little more\r\nthan a presentation of himself.\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-six ballots which ensued, three hundred and six of\r\nthe delegates cast their votes for General Grant.  During the first\r\ntwenty-eight ballotings, James A. Garfield generally received one\r\nvote, and sometimes two.  His strength was then gradually increased\r\nas the friends of Mr. Blaine and of Mr. Sherman rallied to his\r\nsupport, and on the thirty-eighth ballot he received three hundred\r\nand ninety-nine votes, Ulysses S. Grant, three hundred and six;\r\nJames G. Blaine, twelve; Elihu B. Washburne, five, and John Sherman,\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nChester A. Arthur was nominated on the first ballot for Vice-\r\nPresident, receiving four hundred and sixty-eight votes.  General\r\nGrant gave the Chicago ticket his hearty support, and persuaded\r\nSenator Conkling to accompany him to Ohio, where they addressed\r\npublic meetings.  They also addressed large popular gatherings in\r\nthe State of New York, and it was asserted that they carried that\r\nState for Garfield and Arthur.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant visited Washington in December, 1880, and had a most\r\nenthusiastic welcome.  He was received by the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic, and as the train entered the railroad station, the chimes\r\nof the Metropolitan Church rang out \"Home Again,\" while the field-\r\npieces of the artillery company thundered a salute of seventeen\r\nguns.  The General was escorted to the house of his friend, Colonel\r\nBeale, by the Grand Army, headed by the Marine Band, and as the\r\ncolumn passed up Pennsylvania Avenue the dense crowd cheered\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward General Grant went to the Capitol, and for\r\nthe first time an ex-President successively visited the two Houses\r\nof Congress while they were in session.  In the Senate, when General\r\nGrant came in on the floor (to which he had a right, having received\r\nthe thanks of Congress), Senator Edmunds moved that a recess of\r\nten minutes be taken.  The Senators then left their seats and\r\nflocked around General Grant, the Confederate brigadiers leading\r\nthe Democrats, who shook hands cordially with their old chief\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nFrom the Senate Chamber General Grant went to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where an adjournment was immediately carried.\r\nSpeaker Randall then left the chair and invited General Grant to\r\nwalk down to the area before the reporter's desk.  The Representatives\r\nwere there presented in turn, and then the pages enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of shaking the General's hand, which they greatly enjoyed,\r\nand which he too seemed to enjoy as heartily as they.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had been the hero of unparalleled ovations, extending\r\nover years of time and through his tour around the world.  In his\r\nown land, city after city had vied with each other in efforts to\r\ndo him honor, but no receptions were ever more hearty than these\r\nin the two houses of Congress.  And General Grant appreciated it\r\nhighly.  To be thus greeted by political advocate and antagonist,\r\nby his former subordinates on the field and by those who stood\r\nagainst him, was enough to awaken a nature far less sensitive to\r\nappreciation than his.  He was gratified, and was in one of his\r\nmost genial moods, his sunshine melting out any remaining iciness\r\nin those about him.  The fact that he was now regarded as \"out of\r\npolitics\" went far to allay suspicions and open up the channels of\r\ngood-will and friendliness which all admitted were his due in view\r\nof distinguished services rendered by him in the crisis of the\r\nnation's history.  It was a memorable occasion at the Capitol,\r\nwhere so many have occurred.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day of 1881 was the coldest that had been known in\r\nWashington for a quarter of a century, the mercury having fallen\r\nin the morning to ten degrees below zero.  As it was the last\r\nreception of President and Mrs. Hayes, the White House was the\r\ncentre of attraction.  The state apartments were decorated with\r\nflowers, and the Marine Band played in the large entrance hall.\r\nThe long, central corridor was festooned with flags, and further\r\ndecorated with flowers and potted plants.  The parlors were also\r\nadorned with cut flowers and hot-house plants.  At eleven A. M.\r\nthe President and Mrs. Hayes entered the Blue Parlor, preceded by\r\nMajor Farquhar, of the engineer corps, and followed by the Vice-\r\nPresident and Miss Mills, of San Francisco, who afterward became\r\nMrs. Whitelaw Reid.  They took their stations in the centre of the\r\nroom.  The young ladies who were visiting Mrs. Hayes stood back of\r\nher and on her right.  Colonel Casey made the introductions to the\r\nPresident, and Mr. Webb Hayes to his mother.  Mrs. Hayes' dress,\r\nof creamy white ribbed silk, very soft and fine, was trimmed very\r\nelegantly with white cream-tinted satin and pearl passamenteries.\r\nShe wore a silver comb in her dark hair and no jewels.  Miss Lucy\r\nCook wore a cream-colored brocaded satin, combined with plain silk\r\nof the same shade, trimmed with pearls.  Miss Dora Scott, of New\r\nOrleans, wore an elegant costume of Spanish blonde over satin,\r\ntrimmed with field daisies, pond-lilies, and strands of pearls.\r\nThe Attorney-General's niece, Miss Agnes Devens, a bright young\r\nschool-girl, wore a heliotrope cashmere, trimmed with royal purple\r\nvelvet.  Little Miss Fannie Hayes' bright face and perfect complexion\r\nappeared in a child-like dress of white summer camel's hair, trimmed\r\nwith white satin ribbons.  Mrs. Hayes invited Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nThompson, the philanthropist, of New York, to pass the day with\r\nher.  She wore a superb black velvet trimmed with white ostrich\r\nplumes.  Her ornaments were pearls.  This lady had given away in\r\ncharity over half a million dollars.  The gentlemen of the Cabinet\r\nand ladies entered from the Red Parlor, Secretary Evarts and his\r\nfamily immediately preceding the Diplomatic Corps.  All the gentlemen\r\nof the foreign legations, as was customary, wore court dresses,\r\nexcept those who represented republics.  These wore citizens' dress\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\nSecretary Evarts made the presentation of the members of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps to the President.  Sir Edward Thornton, as the\r\nDean of the Corps, and the British Legation took precedence of any\r\nother Foreign Minister then in Washington.  All his family were\r\nwith him, including his tall, fine-looking son, the third Edward\r\nThornton in a direct line of his family who had been attached to\r\nthe British Legation in Washington.  The Russian Minister and his\r\nwife were conceded to be the handsomest and most distinguished-\r\nlooking couple seen in the throng of noted men and fine-looking\r\nladies in the Blue Room.\r\n\r\nThe attendance of army and navy officers was large, including\r\nGeneral Hazen and others recently promoted, from the President's\r\nnative State, of whom, it was reported, Private Secretary Rodgers\r\nused to sing:\r\n\r\n  \"He might have been a Bostonian,\r\n   Or else a Baltimorian,\r\n   Or a Chicago man;\r\n   In spite of all temptation--remained true to his nation,\r\n   And he's an Ohio man.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield's selection of Mr. Blaine as Secretary of State\r\nwas known to the public soon after the Presidential election, but\r\nthere was much speculation as to who else would be invited into\r\nthe Cabinet.  Many prominent public men went to Mentor, where they\r\nfound General Garfield ready to listen, but unwilling to make any\r\npledge.  He impressed one of these visitors as evincing a desire\r\nto bring about the fusion of all the various elements.  He would\r\nmake an honest attempt to give each element proper recognition,\r\nand not allow himself to be involved in any controversy with his\r\nown party.  He recognized the truth of the claim that had not\r\nGeneral Grant and Senator Conkling gone into the campaign when they\r\ndid, he would probably have been defeated, and this visitor was\r\nled to believe that the President-elect would treat the Grant wing\r\nwith consideration.\r\n\r\nAs to particular persons and sections, General Garfield was so\r\nguarded that he gave no impression as to the States that would be\r\nrepresented, except that Iowa should have a place in the Cabinet.\r\nAs to whether it was to be Mr. Wilson or Mr. Allison, or some one\r\nelse, the President-elect dropped no hint.  The name of Robert\r\nLincoln was talked over, and General Garfield indicated an intention\r\nto give him some fitting recognition in his Administration, not\r\nonly because he considered Mr. Lincoln a bright young man, but\r\nbecause he should take pleasure in making so graceful a tribute to\r\nthe memory of his father.  He did not intimate, however, that it\r\nwould be by offering the son a seat in the Cabinet, nor did he say\r\nit would not be done in that way.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  EBWashburne\r\nELIHU B. WASHBURNE, one of five brothers who have occupied prominent\r\npositions under the National Government, was born at Livermore,\r\nMaine, September 23d, 1816; studied law and commenced practice at\r\nGalena, Illinois; was a Representative from Illinois, 1853-1869;\r\nwas appointed by President Grant Secretary of State, and after\r\nserving a few days, Minister to France, serving 1869-1877; returned\r\nto Galena and afterward settled at Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nTHE GARFIELD INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of James Abram Garfield as the twentieth President\r\nof the United States was a grand historical pageant, although its\r\neffect was marred by the chilly, snowy, and wet weather.  All the\r\nnight previous the shrill blasts of the storm-king were varied by\r\nthe whistles of the locomotives and steamboats, which were bringing\r\nthousands from the North, the West, and the South.  Drenched and\r\ndraggled people perambulated Pennsylvania Avenue and the adjacent\r\nstreets, while occasional memories of the war would be revived as\r\na well-equipped regiment or company with its full brass band would\r\nmarch past to its quarters.   The hotels were emphatically full,\r\nand the last comers were glad to be able to secure one of the\r\nhundreds of cots made up in the parlors.  Many swarmed into the\r\ntheatres, the concert halls, or the Capitol, yet there was no\r\ndrunkenness or rowdyism, but every on appeared to take a Mark Tapley-\r\nlike view of the storm, and be as jolly as was possible under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nLong before the morning guns boomed from the Arsenal and the Navy\r\nYard, thousands of noses flattened against window-glass in the\r\nanxiety of the owners to see if the heavens were propitious; but\r\nthere was no sign of sunshine.  As the day advanced there were some\r\nbright streaks in the dull gray of the leaden sky, and the excellence\r\nof concrete pavements was shown, as they were free from mud, and\r\nthe slosh was soon trodden into water, which ran off in the gutters.\r\nThe flags, which had clung to the staffs, began to dry and flutter\r\nin the breeze.  Nearly every house was decked with bunting, while\r\nupon many the most artistic designs of decorative art were displayed.\r\nUpon the broad sidewalks of Pennsylvania Avenue a living tide of\r\nhumanity--men, women, and children--flowed toward the Capitol,\r\npausing now and then to gaze at some passing regiment or political\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman, who was Chief Marshal, had made such arrangements\r\nthat the procession moved with the precision of clock-work when\r\nthe signal gun was fired.  The escort was composed of twelve\r\ncompanies of regular artillery, armed and equipped as infantry,\r\nwith six companies of marines.  Then came President Hayes and\r\nPresident-elect Garfield, with Senators Bayard and Anthony of the\r\nSenate Committee, in a four-horse carriage, with the Columbia\r\nCommandery of Knights Templar, of which General Garfield was a\r\nmember, as a guard of honor.  General Arthur, escorted by Senator\r\nPendleton, followed in a four-horse carriage.  After them marched\r\nthe well-drilled battalion of Cleveland Grays, the Utica Veterans,\r\nin their Continental uniforms; the Utica Citizens' Corps, the\r\nMaryland Fifth, the Boston Fusileers, a company of Pennsylvania\r\nvolunteers, the Grand Army, the naval cadets, the local militia\r\ncompanies, the Signal Corps, and a colored pioneer club.\r\n\r\nAs the carriages passed down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol,\r\nthe occupants were greeted with continuous cheers.  General Garfield\r\nlooked somewhat jaded, but doffed his stovepipe hat in response to\r\nthe shouts, and bowed to the right and left.  The crowd all along\r\nthe line was dense, and it was with difficulty that it could be\r\nkept back to make way for the procession.  The house windows were\r\nall occupied, and presented a varied scene of beautiful women,\r\nstaid men, fluttering handkerchiefs, uplifted hats, and bright\r\nbunting.  An armed guard had been posted about the Capitol, and it\r\ngave mortal offense to some of the Representatives who tried to\r\nforce their way in.\r\n\r\nAs the Senate Chamber is the scene of the swearing in of the Vice-\r\nPresident, and as the galleries hold only about twelve hundred\r\npersons, the tickets were in great demand.  When the doors were\r\nopened at half-past ten there was a rush made for the front seats,\r\nand the entire galleries were soon filled.  A large majority of\r\nthe occupants were ladies, fashionably dressed, whose moving fans\r\ngave animation to the general effect.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes escorted General Garfield's venerable mother and Mrs.\r\nGarfield to the gallery seats reserved for them.  Mrs. Hayes wore\r\na magnificent sealskin dolman and a black brocaded silk dress, with\r\na white uncut velvet bonnet and ostrich feathers.  She carried a\r\nbouquet of lilies of the valley.  \"Mother Garfield,\" as she was\r\nfamiliarly called, was a white-haired, venerable-looking lady, who\r\nwore on that day a black silk bonnet, a black silk dress, and a\r\nsilk cloak trimmed with a band of silver fox fur.  Mrs. General\r\nGarfield wore a suit of dark green velvet trimmed with chenille\r\nfringe, and a bonnet to match.  She carried a bunch of roses.  Miss\r\nMollie Garfield wore a plum-colored woolen suit trimmed with plush,\r\nand a broad-brimmed gypsy hat, tied down over her ears.  Miss Fannie\r\nHayes wore a purple plush suit striped with yellow, and a white\r\nfelt hat.  Officials entitled to admission on the floor of the\r\nSenate began to make their appearance and to occupy the vacant\r\nchairs, the Senators having doubled up on one side of the Chamber.\r\n\r\nWhen General Hancock, the \"superb soldier,\" entered in full uniform,\r\nescorted by Senator Blaine, he was greeted with applause, which\r\ncontinued as he passed around the rear of the Democratic seats to\r\nthe main aisle, the Senators all being seated on the Republican\r\nside.  For a few minutes he held a sort of general levee, and was\r\nthen escorted to a seat in front of and left of the Vice-President,\r\nbeing again greeted with applause.  General Sheridan, when he\r\nentered, was also applauded.  The two Generals sat side by side\r\nand each was accompanied by his staff.  Sir Edward Thornton headed\r\nthe Diplomatic Corps, which came in a body, nearly all wearing the\r\nresplendent court dresses of their respective nations, and decked\r\nwith their ribbons, stars, and other insignia of knighthood.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States was announced, and all rose as\r\nMr. Hayes entered, escorting General Garfield.  The General wore\r\na suit of black cloth, with a black neck-tie, over which his collar\r\nwas turned down.  They were shown to seats in the centre of the\r\nChamber.  Mr. Wheeler presented Mr. Arthur, who made a well-worded\r\nspeech, and was then sworn in by Mr. Wheeler, who in turn made a\r\nfew remarks, alluding to the good feeling that had always been\r\nshown toward him and returning his thanks therefor.  His last\r\nofficial act was performed in declaring the Senate of the Forty-\r\nsixth Congress adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Randall then entered, followed by the Representatives, who\r\nfilled up what vacant room remained.  The Chaplain invoked the\r\nblessings of Divine Providence upon the incoming Administration,\r\nand asked that prosperity, health, and happiness might attend those\r\nwhose connection with the Government had ceased.  While this prayer\r\nwas being offered both Mr. Hayes and Mr. Garfield rose and remained\r\nstanding.  President Hayes' proclamation convening a special session\r\nof the Senate was read by the Secretary.  The roll of the new Senate\r\nwas then called, and the newly elected Senators were sworn in.\r\nAnnouncement was made that the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the\r\ninvited spectators would proceed to the east portico of the Capitol\r\nto participate in the ceremonies of the inauguration.  The greater\r\nportion of those in the Senate Chamber, however, did not wait, but\r\nstarted in a most undignified manner for the platform.\r\n\r\nThis was erected over the lower flight of steps leading up into\r\nthe eastern portico.  In the front and centre was a raised stage,\r\non which was the chair once used by Washington.  General Garfield\r\noccupied this seat of honor, with President Hayes on his right and\r\nChief Justice Waite on his left.\r\n\r\nIt was an impressive scene.  Behind, as a background, rose the\r\nCapitol in its sublime grandeur and with its many memories; all\r\naround were the dignitaries of the country, with many ladies, whose\r\nribbons and flowers gave brilliancy to the scene; and in front was\r\nan immense sea of upturned faces with lines of bristling bayonets,\r\nflags, plumes, and bright uniforms.  When silence had been secured\r\nGeneral Garfield rose, took off his overcoat, advanced to the front\r\nof the stand, and delivered his inaugural address in clear tones\r\nand with ringing accents.  His face was stronger in those traits\r\nthat indicate mental power than in classical outlines, and the\r\nlikeness between him and his mother was noticeable as the evidently\r\ndelighted old lady sat listening to him.  She was the first mother\r\nwho had heard her son deliver his inaugural as President of the\r\nUnited States.  When General Garfield had concluded and the applause\r\nhad somewhat subsided, the Chief Justice advanced toward him, and\r\nthe two stood facing each other.  The Chief Justice then administered\r\nthe prescribed oath, which was reverentially taken, and then\r\nPresident Garfield received the plaudits of the people.  While the\r\ninaugural was being delivered the sun had shone brightly.  President\r\nGarfield's first act was to kiss his mother and his wife.  He then\r\nreceived the congratulations of those around him, and after waiting\r\na few moments for this purpose, was escorted again to his carriage,\r\nwhich was driven to the reviewing stand in front of the White House.\r\n\r\nHere General Garfield witnessed the long procession pass in review,\r\nthe bands playing patriotic airs and the officers saluting.  The\r\nexcellent marching and well-dressed ranks of the passing military\r\nwas the theme of great praise from the prominent officers and\r\ndistinguished civilians before whom they passed, and the thousands\r\nof spectators who occupied the stands and sidewalks opposite\r\napplauded often and loudly.  Division after division, brigade after\r\nbrigade, regiment after regiment, company after company, marched\r\nproudly past, forming the finest military display ever witnessed\r\nat Washington since the great war reviews, \"when Johnny came marching\r\nhome.\"  Pennsylvania contributed the largest body of troops.  The\r\nNew York Ninth, although late to arrive, was much complimented,\r\nand so was the Maryland Fifth; the Boston Fusileers also attracted\r\nmarked attention.  General Sherman was proud of his procession,\r\nand he had reason to be.  The numerous military commands and civil\r\norganizations, the excellent bands, the prancing steeds, the waving\r\nplumes and flags, the bright swords and bayonets, and the public\r\nspirit which animated the long array, all combined to render the\r\nscene a stirring one.  It was five o'clock before the military had\r\nall passed the reviewing stand, and some of the political organizations\r\nwhich had to leave Washington did not pass in review.  Going from\r\nthe reviewing stand to the White House, President Garfield was\r\nwelcomed by his aged mother and his family.  He then lunched with\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hayes, who soon afterward left for Secretary Sherman's,\r\nwhere they passed the night.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for those who wished to indulge in the time-honored\r\ncustom of dancing at an inauguration ball that the Government had\r\njust completed an immense building for a national museum, which\r\nwas fitted up for the occasion.  Wooden floors were laid by the\r\nacre and carefully waxed, and the building was simply yet tastefully\r\ndecorated.  A heroic statue of \"Liberty,\" which stood in the central\r\nrotunda of the building, holding aloft a beacon torch, was the\r\nfirst object that struck the visitors on entering.  Flags were\r\nlavishly displayed, and the high, arched ceiling was almost hidden\r\nby a network of evergreens and flowers.\r\n\r\nPresident and Mrs. Garfield arrived at the building about nine\r\no'clock and were received by the Committee, Hon. George Bancroft\r\nescorting the President.  Mrs. Garfield was dressed with great\r\ntaste.  She wore a dress of light heliotrope satin, elaborately\r\ntrimmed with point lace, a cluster of pansies at her neck, and no\r\njewelry.  Mrs. Hayes, who was escorted by Hon. John Alley, wore a\r\ncream-colored satin dress trimmed with ermine.\r\n\r\nThe supper was served in a temporarily constructed \"annex,\" where\r\npreparations were made for seating five hundred persons at a time.\r\nThe caterer provided fifteen hundred pounds of turkey, one hundred\r\ngallons of oysters, fifty hams, three hundred and fifty pounds of\r\nbutter, seven hundred loaves of bread, two thousand biscuits, one\r\nthousand rolls, two hundred gallons of chicken salad, fifteen\r\nthousand cakes, one hundred and fifty gallons of ice-cream, fifty\r\ngallons of jelly, fifty gallons of water ices, two hundred and\r\nfifty gallons of coffee, and other delicacies in proportion.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  J.A.Garfield\r\nJAMES ABRAM GARFIELD was born at Orange, Ohio, November 19th, 1831;\r\nserved in the Union Army as Colonel, Brigadier-General, and Major-\r\nGeneral, 1861-1863; was a Representative from Ohio, 1863-1881; was\r\nPresident of the United States from March 4th, 1881, until having\r\nbeen assassinated on the morning of Saturday, July 2d, he, after\r\nweary weeks of torture, died at Elberton, N. J., on the seashore,\r\nSeptember 19th, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nCHANGES AND DISSENSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, which met in executive session when General Garfield\r\nwas inaugurated, showed many changes.  Vice-President Wheeler, who\r\nhad served in Congress long and well, was replaced by General\r\nArthur, whose war record in the State of New York had won him many\r\nfriends.  Senators Allen Thurman and Matt. Carpenter were missed\r\nby their legal friends, but among the new Senators was the ponderous\r\nDavid Davis, \"learned in the law.\"  General Hawley replaced Mr.\r\nEaton, and with him there came from the House Messrs. Conger,\r\nMitchell, and Hale.  One of the silver kings of the Pacific slope,\r\nMr. Fair, of Nevada, was naturally an object of attention.\r\n\r\nAs chosen, the Republicans had a majority in the Senate, but the\r\ntransfer of Messrs. Blaine, Windom, and Kirkwood to the Cabinet\r\ngave the Democrats a temporary ascendency.  The arrival of Mr.\r\nFrye, elected as the successor of Mr. Blaine, and of Mr. McDill,\r\nappointed as the successor of Mr. Kirkwood, secured a tie, and the\r\ncasting vote of Vice-President Arthur enabled the Republicans to\r\nsecure the control of the committees.  The caucus of Republican\r\nSenators nominated Senator Anthony for President _pro tempore_ when\r\nthe Vice-President should vacate the chair; George C. Gorham for\r\nSecretary, and Harrison H. Riddleberger, Sergeant-at-Arms.  The\r\nDemocratic Senators refused to permit the election of Messrs. Gorham\r\nand Riddleberger, and as seven Senators could at any time prevent\r\naction by motions to adjourn, a dead-lock ensued, which lasted from\r\nMarch 23d until May 10th, when the Republicans gracefully surrendered,\r\npermitting the Democratic officers of the Senate to retain their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was trouble among the Republican Senators, caused\r\nby the rival factions in the State of New York.  Early in March\r\nseveral nominations of men who were ostensibly supporters of Mr.\r\nConkling were made unexpectedly to him, and a day or two later the\r\nSenate was treated to a genuine surprise in the nomination of W. H.\r\nRobertson to be Collector of the Port of New York.  The astonishment\r\ncould not have been greater if the name of Samuel J. Tilden had\r\nbeen sent in.  No intimation of such an intention had leaked out.\r\nNeither Arthur, Conkling, nor Platt dreamed of such a thing.  It\r\nwas a square blow at Conkling, at the very time when he and his\r\nfriends were congratulating themselves as being on top.  When Vice-\r\nPresident Arthur opened the list of nominations in the Senate, his\r\neye lit first upon the name of Robertson for Collector.  He turned\r\nthe paper down so as to leave that name uppermost, and sent it to\r\nSenator Conkling.  The latter, upon glancing at it, walked rapidly\r\nover to Senator Platt, showed it to him, and they held a whispered\r\nconference.  After the Senate adjourned, it was learned that the\r\nnomination was especially objectionable to them.\r\n\r\nIt was subsequently stated that in New York city the preceding\r\nsummer, at Mentor the previous February, and at the White House on\r\nthe Sunday night before the Wednesday on which Judge Robertson's\r\nnomination was sent to the Senate, General Garfield had agreed not\r\nto make any appointments for New York unless they were satisfactory\r\nto the Republican organization of that State, and that they were\r\nto be submitted to the Vice-President and the two Senators from\r\nthat State.  At the interview held on the Sunday night previous to\r\nthe nomination of Judge Robertson, Senator Conkling had especially\r\nobjected to having him in the New York Custom House, yet if the\r\nPresident should nominate him to a foreign mission, he would go\r\nout in the lobby and hold his nose while the Senate confirmed him.\r\n\r\nThe objectionable nomination was, however, made, and it was\r\nimmediately evident that it meant war between the Garfield\r\nAdministration and Senator Conkling.  The next day, while the Senate\r\nwas in executive session, the President's secretary appeared at\r\nthe door with a communication, which was handed to the Vice-President,\r\nand by him to the Executive Clerk, and read.  When it arrived\r\nConkling was sitting at his own desk, buried in a voluminous letter.\r\nHe never raised his eyes from his letter, nor moved a muscle of\r\nhis face or body while the Clerk monotonously read the momentous\r\nmessage, withdrawing, not Robertson, but all the nominations of\r\nmen for the leading New York offices who were acceptable to the\r\nSenator.  The arrow went home, of course, but the wounded one\r\nbetrayed no sign of pain.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was referred to the Committee on Commerce, of which\r\nMr. Conkling was chairman, and was there pigeon-holed until issue\r\non it was squarely made in the Senate and in the Republican party.\r\nRepublican Senators, who visited the White House or the Departments\r\nin search of offices for their henchmen, were plainly told that\r\ntheir votes in favor of the confirmation of Judge Robertson's\r\nnomination would be expected.  The Democratic Senators were also\r\nlooked after, and among other means resorted to in order to disarm\r\ntheir opposition was a letter signed by every Democratic member of\r\nthe New York Legislature, addressed to Senator Pendleton, chairman\r\nof the Senatorial caucus, urging the confirmation of Judge Robertson.\r\nIt would make an Administration and an anti-Administration faction\r\nin New York Republicanism, and would secure the State to the\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nSenator Conkling was not idle, and he appealed to the \"Senatorial\r\ncourtesy\" of those around him to defeat the obnoxious nomination,\r\nbut in vain.  Senator Jones, of Nevada, and a half-dozen Democrats\r\nwere all the strength that he could command, and the nomination of\r\nJudge Robertson was confirmed.  Senator Conkling immediately left\r\nthe Senate, taking his colleague, Senator Platt, with him, and they\r\nappealed to the Legislature of the State of New York, expecting\r\nthat they would be triumphantly re-elected, and, thus indorsed,\r\nwould return to the Senate with flying colors, conquering and to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nThe exodus of Senators Conkling and Platt left the Republican\r\nSenators again in a minority, and as it was evident that Senator\r\nDavis would not aid in electing Senator Anthony President _pro\r\ntem._, Vice-President Arthur did not vacate the chair prior to the\r\nclose of the session, and thus render it necessary to elect a\r\ntemporary presiding officer.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable event of the executive session was a three\r\nhours' speech by Senator Mahone, of Virginia, in reply to bitter\r\npersonal attacks that had been made on him by the Democrats since\r\nhe had acted with the Republicans.  No speech for years had attracted\r\na greater audience, even the diplomatic gallery being crowded.\r\nProminent among the many ladies present were Mrs. Secretary Blaine\r\nand Mrs. Kate Chase Sprague, accompanied by her three young daughters.\r\nThe Supreme Court was present in a body, having adjourned on account\r\nof the funeral in the family of Justice Field.  Representatives,\r\nstill hunting for office, abandoned the White House for once, while\r\neach Senator seemed to have a score of secretaries, so many persons\r\nbeing admitted upon secretaries' cards.  The Speaker was surrounded\r\nby Anthony, Morrill, Allison, Conger, and other leading Republicans.\r\nOn the opposite side was Davis, of West Virginia, with a snowy\r\nwhite spot on his dark chin beard.  Wade Hampton's military waxed\r\nmoustache and haughty countenance was beside the genial face of\r\nSenator Pendleton, and next came the sagacious round head of Senator\r\nBeck, with close-cut, curling hair.  Ingalls, of Kansas, a tall,\r\nslim collegian--\"the bluejay of the plains\"--clad in blue from head\r\nto foot, and with a bright blue ribbon encircling his slender\r\nthroat, stood somewhat back of the seats.  Senator Voorhees' form\r\ntowered in the shadow of the cloak-room.  Senator Conkling, who\r\nhad not yet left the Senate, \"_Fier d'etre moi_,\" sat in the middle\r\naisle, dressed in a mixed brown business suit, with a bit of red\r\nhandkerchief showing above the breast pocket.\r\n\r\nSenator Mahone was just recovering from a temporary indisposition,\r\nand his voice was faint and thin, but his bearing was defiant as\r\nhe rose, with his pointed beard streaming over his breast, and\r\nadjusted his gold-rimmed eye-glasses.  A mass of public documents\r\nand newspapers were piled on his desk, with an ominous display of\r\ncut lemons, showing that he expected to be compelled to strengthen\r\nhis voice.  His weight at that time was but ninety pounds, and\r\nthose ninety pounds must have been composed of brain and voice and\r\nsinew, for, notwithstanding his evident feebleness, he spoke calmly\r\nand earnestly for three hours.  As for the speech, those who came\r\nexpecting to witness a renewal of the outburst of passion and\r\ninvective which characterized his first appearance in the Senate,\r\nwhen he made his impromptu, eloquent reply to the savage assaults\r\nof Senator Ben. Hill, of Georgia, went away disappointed.  There\r\nwas very little that was personal in his speech, but there was\r\nenough to show that the Virginia Senator intended on all occasions\r\nto take care of himself, and that it would be wise for the Bourbons\r\nto forego personalities in their future debates with him.  Those\r\nwho came to hear a careful explanation of the debt question in\r\nVirginia, as it was understood by the Refunders, and to listen to\r\nan exposition of the opposition to Bourbonism, of which General\r\nMahone was a leader, went away enlightened, if not fully satisfied.\r\nThe speech was not intended as a philippic; it was designed as a\r\ncareful exposition of the Virginia debt question, as an argument\r\nin support of the Readjuster party, and an arraignment of the\r\nBourbons.  It was one of the old style, solid political speeches,\r\ncustomary with Southern orators, which were much sought and generally\r\nread in the cross-roads counties of the Old Dominion, where the\r\ntelegraph and the newspapers had usurped the ancient functions of\r\nthe _Congressional Record_.\r\n\r\nSenator Mahone indicated, possibly, a line for future aggressive\r\ndebate in the Senate when he called upon the leaders of the different\r\nschools of finance and tariff in the Democratic party to stand up\r\nand tell him who was the leader of the party.  He was unable to\r\nsay whether it was the stalwart Greenbacker, Mr. Voorhees, the\r\nstalwart hard-money man, Mr. Bayard, or the author of the Ohio\r\nidea, Mr. Pendleton, and he called upon Mr. Voorhees, whose silver\r\neloquence, he said, he had heard could make the water of the Wabash\r\nrun backward, to answer the inquiry at his leisure.  The general\r\nassaults upon him personally Senator Mahone repelled by a disclaimer\r\nand the Scotch quotation ending,\r\n\r\n  \"If thou sayest I am not peer,\r\n   To any lord of Scotland here,\r\n   Highland or Lowland, far or near,\r\n   Lord Angus, thou hast lied.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Senator Mahone declared to him and to those who\r\nsupported him the Solid South had become a mere geographical\r\nexpression, that he and they stood for the right of freemen, and\r\nthat he, in the name of the brave men who stood behind him, would\r\nguarantee to the North that thereafter in Virginia there should be\r\na full and free ballot and an honest count.\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield's first appearance in public after his inauguration\r\nwas at the unveiling of the statue of Farragut, which was the work\r\nof his protege, Mrs. Vinnie Ream Hoxie.  A procession was formed\r\nat the Capitol, and was headed by Commodore Baldwin, as Grand\r\nMarshal, with the Naval School Cadets as an escort.  The naval\r\ndivision, commanded by Captain Meade, included the battalion of\r\nmarines and band, two infantry battalions of sailors and bands,\r\nand a battalion of naval light artillery, dragging their howitzers.\r\nThe army division, commanded by Colonel Pennington, included the\r\nSecond Artillery band, four batteries of artillery armed and equipped\r\nas infantry, and a light battery.  The militia division, commanded\r\nby Colonel Webster, included the volunteer infantry companies of\r\nWashington, white and colored, with a battery of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe procession marched to the statue, where seats had been provided\r\nfor invited guests.  When the troops had been massed near by, Rev.\r\nArthur Brooks offered prayer, and the canvas covering was then\r\nremoved from the statue by Quartermaster Knowles, of the navy, who\r\nwas ordered by the executive officer of the Hartford to follow\r\nFarragut up the shrouds during the engagement in Mobile Bay, and\r\nto lash him to the rigging, which he did.  Bartholomew Diggins,\r\nwho was captain of Farragut's barge, then hoisted the Admiral's\r\nflag on a mast planted near the pedestal, the drums beat four\r\nruffles, the trumpets sounded four flourishes, the Marine Band\r\nplayed a march, and an Admiral's salute of seventeen guns was fired\r\nfrom a naval battery, the troops presenting arms at the first gun\r\nand coming to a \"carry\" at the last.\r\n\r\nBrief addresses were then delivered in turn by President Garfield,\r\nHorace Maynard, and Senator Voorhees.  The Marine Band played \"Hail\r\nto the Chief,\" and was followed by an Admiral's salute of seventeen\r\nguns, during which the troops presented arms, drums beat, trumpets\r\nsounded, and bands played, and at last gun the Admiral's flag was\r\nhauled down.  The column then re-formed and marched in review before\r\nthe President at the Executive Mansion.\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield, later in the spring, conferred the degrees at\r\nthe College for Deaf Mutes at Kendall Green, just north of Washington.\r\nThe graduates delivered addresses in sign language, while one of\r\nthe College professors read their remarks from manuscript, very\r\nfew of the audience understanding the gestured speech.  The President\r\nconcluded a neat little address by saying:  \"During many years of\r\npolitical life in one way or another, I always looked upon this\r\nplace as a neutral ground, where we all, no matter what the political\r\ndifferences were, could meet, all trying to make this institution\r\nworthy the capital, and I hope to see this unchanged by any political\r\nvicissitudes that can happen.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield showed deep practical interest in all educational\r\nmeasures.  He had learned by his own experiences how rough the road\r\nto literary eminence may be.  He had received for himself when a\r\nboy the slender aid of a winter school in a country district; he\r\nhad fed his early mental cravings with the narrow store of borrowed\r\nbooks in a rural section; but he had studied diligently and worked\r\nhard to enter college and to graduate, and his subsequent life for\r\nmany years was one of unintermitted mental toil.  No wonder,\r\ntherefore, that institutions of learning received his constant\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  DavidDavis\r\nDAVID DAVIS was born in Cecil County, Maryland, March 9th, 1815;\r\nwas graduated from Kenyon College in 1832; studied law at the New\r\nHaven Law School; was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice\r\nat Bloomington, Illinois, in 1836; was Judge of an Illinois Circuit\r\nCourt, 1848-1862; was appointed by President Lincoln a Judge of\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in October, 1862, and served\r\nuntil March 5th, 1877, when he resigned to take his seat as United\r\nStates Senator from Illinois; when Vice-President Arthur became\r\nPresident he was chosen President _pro tempore_ of the Senate, and\r\nserved until March 3d, 1883, and died at Bloomington, Illinois,\r\nJune 26th, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nTHE ASSASSINATION.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield was a singularly domestic man, and his life while\r\nhe was a Representative, at his pleasant home on I Street was a\r\nhappy one.  Believing in the power of steady and sincere labor, he\r\nhad mastered language, science, literature, and the fine arts.\r\nArtists found in him a zealous advocate for their employment and\r\nremuneration by Congress, and he was thoroughly acquainted with\r\nthe works of the old masters.  He was a great lover of scrap-books,\r\nand he had in his library a shelf full of them, containing articles\r\nand paragraphs relating to the subjects lettered on their back.\r\nIn this work Mrs. Garfield rendered him valuable aid, cutting and\r\nsorting the scraps which he would mark in newspapers, and then\r\npasting them into the scrap-books.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry was very dear to General Garfield, who was a regular\r\nattendant on the meetings of the lodge, chapter, and encampment\r\nwith which he was affiliated.  He was the President of a literary\r\nassociation, the meetings of which he used to attend with great\r\nregularity.  Occasionally he went to the theatre or to a concert,\r\nand I well remember the delight which he manifested when attending\r\nthe \"readings\" of Charles Dickens.  When the \"Christmas Carol\" was\r\nread, as Mr. Dickens pronounced the words, \"Bless his heart, it's\r\nFezziwig alive yet,\" a dog, with some double bass vocalism, stirred,\r\nperhaps, by some ghostly impulse, responded:  \"Bow! wow! wow!\" with\r\na repetition that not only brought down the house wildly, but threw\r\nMr. Dickens himself into such convulsions of humor that he could\r\nnot proceed with his readings.  \"Bow! wow! wow!\" was General\r\nGarfield's favorite greeting for months afterward when he met any\r\none whom he knew to have been at the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe White House, during the short time that General Garfield was\r\npermitted to occupy it, was a continued scene of domestic enjoyment.\r\n\"Mother\" Garfield had an honored place at the family table at her\r\nson's right hand, and was always waited on first, whoever else\r\nmight be present.  On the other side of the President sat Jamie,\r\nwho was his father's pet.  Harry, the oldest boy, always sat next\r\nhis mother, and then Miss Mollie, who was approaching womanhood,\r\nIrwin, and little Abram, who was but nine years of age.  Mrs.\r\nGarfield was a believer in good fare, and there was always an\r\nabundance of wholesome, nutritious food, with good coffee, tea,\r\nand milk.  Flowers from the conservatory adorned the table at every\r\nmeal.  After dinner President Garfield used to indulge in a game\r\nof billiards, having promptly restored to its place the billiard-\r\ntable banished by Mrs. Hayes.  Occasionally he would indulge in a\r\ncigar, and he was not averse to a glass of champagne or Rhine wine\r\nor lager beer, although he drank temperately and without hypocrisy.\r\nHe liked, as night came on, to take a gallop on horseback, and he\r\nwas a fearless rider.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield displayed the advantage of having been regularly\r\n\"trained\" for his Presidential position.  He heard the stories of\r\nall with a sympathetic manner that inspired confidence.  He knew\r\nhow to free himself from those who attempted to monopolize too much\r\nof his time, and he never gave place-hunters reason to believe that\r\ntheir prayers would be granted when he knew that it would not be\r\nso.  There was not, after all, such a crowd of office-seekers as\r\nmight have been expected at the commencement of a new Administration.\r\nSome members of the Cabinet had scores of political mortgages out,\r\nwhich they were called upon to redeem, and which gave the President\r\na great deal of trouble.  Then came the rejection of a Solicitor-\r\nGeneral by the Senate, whose appointment was not acceptable to the\r\npragmatical Attorney-General, New York troubles, the forced exposure\r\nof the Star-route scandals, and other antagonisms, rivalries, and\r\ndissensions.  The Garfield Administration was on the verge of\r\ndissolution within four months after its creation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Garfield, familiarly called by her husband \"Crete,\" held four\r\nsuccessive receptions of invited guests immediately after the\r\ninauguration, at which her deportment and dress met with the\r\nheartiest commendation of \"society.\"  Lady-like, sweet-voiced,\r\nunruffled, well informed, and always appropriately dressed, she\r\nwas eminently fitted to be \"the first lady in the land,\" and she\r\nquietly yet firmly repelled any patronizing attempts to direct her\r\nmovements.  She had a natural aversion to publicity, but was anxious\r\nto entertain the thousands who flocked to the White House.  To a\r\nstranger she appeared reticent and rather too retiring to make him\r\nfeel at home, but the second and third time he saw her he began to\r\nappreciate her sterling, womanlike qualities, and to like her.\r\n\r\nDuring the Presidential campaign Mrs. Garfield had been under a\r\nmental strain, and when installed in the White House the struggle\r\nbetween the contending New York factions gave her great uneasiness,\r\nfor she possessed a complete mastery of politics.  At last she was\r\ntaken ill, and called in a lady physician, a responsible middle-\r\naged woman, homoeopathic in practice, who had sometimes attended\r\nthe children.  When she grew worse they summoned Dr. Pope, a\r\nhomoeopath of skill and reputation, and gave the case into his\r\nhands, retaining the lady as nurse.  Last of all, as the physician\r\nwished consultation, they sent for Dr. Boynton, of Cleveland, a\r\ncousin of the President and a physician of good local practice.\r\nIt was decided that Mrs. Garfield should seek change of air, and\r\nshe left Washington and her husband for Long Branch, little dreaming\r\nthat she should never see him again in health.\r\n\r\nThen came the fatal morning of Saturday, July 2d, when--as we are\r\ntold by Mr. Blaine, who accompanied him--General Garfield was a\r\nhappy man, feeling that trouble lay behind him and not before him,\r\nthat he was soon to meet his beloved wife, recovered from an illness\r\nthat had disquieted him, and that he was going to his Alma Mater\r\nto renew the most cherished association of his early manhood.  Thus\r\ngladsome, he entered the station of the Baltimore and Potomac\r\nRailroad, strong, healthy, and happy.  There was a succession of\r\npistol-shots, and he fell helpless, doomed to weary weeks of torture\r\nas he slowly descended through the martyr-gate into his grave.\r\n\r\nThe nation was inexpressibly shocked as the news of the assassination\r\nspread over the wires, and the deep anxiety which pervaded the\r\npopular mind showed the warm and intense love felt for their\r\nPresident, who was the incarnation of their own institutions.  A\r\nspecial train carried Mrs. Garfield to Washington, bearing up under\r\nthe weight of her sorrow with true womanly fortitude, and on her\r\narrival she had the satisfaction of finding her husband alive and\r\nable to converse with her.  There were hopes that with his heroic\r\nand cheerful courage, and his naturally strong constitution, he\r\nmight struggle back to vigorous life.  The bulletins issued twice\r\na day by the physicians in attendance gave hopes, generally, of\r\nthe ultimate recovery of the suffering patient, but there are good\r\nreasons for believing that these bulletins did not give a correct\r\nstatement of the sufferer's condition.  The President's family\r\nphysician, Dr. J. H. Baxter, was not allowed to see him, and eminent\r\nsurgeons, while they believed that death was inevitable, asserted\r\nthat the entire diagnosis of the case was wrong from the beginning\r\nto the end.  Meanwhile the patient endured pain with the calmness\r\nof a martyr, and he gazed on death with the eye of a philosopher.\r\n\"I am not afraid to die,\" said he, \"but I will try to live.\"  He\r\nwas finally taken to the seaside, and there he breathed his last.\r\n\r\nHis remains were conveyed to Washington, attended by his bereaved\r\nfamily, President Arthur, General Grant, and other distinguished\r\npersons, and escorted to the Capitol by the Knights Templar and\r\nthe military.  Twenty-nine weeks previous, when General Garfield\r\nhad gone in state, in the strength of his manhood, along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, the _Via Sacra_ of our Republic, to assume the responsible\r\nduties of Chief Magistrate, the bands had played patriotic airs,\r\nand he had received the loud acclaims of his fellow-citizens.  Now,\r\nas his mortal remains passed over the same route in a hearse drawn\r\nby six white horses, the lively music was replaced by the solemn\r\nstrains of funeral marches, and sorrow appeared to fill every\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nThe casket was laid in state beneath the great dome of the Capitol,\r\nwithin a short distance of the spot where, on the 4th of March\r\nprevious, the occupant had pronounced his inaugural address.  For\r\ntwo days thousands of citizens, of all classes, conditions, and\r\nnationalities, reverentially filed past the coffin and gazed upon\r\nthe wasted form and pallid lineaments of the deceased.  On Friday\r\nthe afflicted widow took the last look at the face of the dead,\r\nand after she had left the impressive funeral ceremonies were\r\nperformed.  The remains were then escorted by the military, their\r\narms reversed, their flags shrouded, and their bands wailing dirges,\r\nto the depot where the assassination took place, where they were\r\nplaced on a railroad train to be conveyed to Cleveland with his\r\nfamily and a large number of distinguished mourners.\r\n\r\nThe funeral train arrived at Cleveland on the afternoon of September\r\n24th, and on the 26th the remains of the nation's second martyr-\r\nPresident were consigned to their last resting-place, amid the\r\nflashing lightning and the rolling thunder of a severe storm.  The\r\nday was consecrated all over the country to manifestation of respect\r\nfor the memory of the dead, and messages of condolence were flashed\r\nbeneath the Atlantic from the leading foreign powers of the Old\r\nWorld, expressing their regard for the memory of a ruler who had\r\nendeared himself to the wide world by the heroism of humanity.  As\r\nthe muffled bells in fifty thousand steeples tolled the burial\r\nhour, the hearts of fifty millions of people beat in homage to the\r\ndeceased President, whose remains were being entombed on the shore\r\nof Lake Erie.  Public and private edifices were lavishly decorated\r\nin black, there were processions in the Northern cities, and funeral\r\nservices in many congregations, eliciting the remark that the\r\nprayers of Christian people in all quarters of the globe \"following\r\nthe sun and keeping company with the hours,\" had circled the earth\r\nwith an unbroken strain of mourning and sympathy.  Criticism was\r\nsilenced, faults were forgotten, and nothing but good was spoken\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\nCharles Guiteau, the cowardly wretch who assassinated General\r\nGarfield, was a native of Chicago, thirty-six years of age, short\r\nin stature, and with a well-knit, stout frame.  He had led a vagabond\r\nlife, and had come to Washington after the inauguration of General\r\nGarfield, seeking appointment to a foreign consulate, and when he\r\nfound himself disappointed, his morbid imagination sought revenge.\r\nAttorney-General MacVeagh, who was then bent on making political\r\nmischief by the Star-route prosecutions, made himself ridiculous\r\nwhen General Garfield died by asserting that the United States had\r\njurisdiction over the cottage in which the President died, and\r\nendeavoring to exclude the New Jersey authorities.  He then appeared\r\nto take no interest in the prosecution of Guiteau, and although he\r\nhad employed eminent legal talent in the Star-route and Howgate\r\ncases, he gave District Attorney Corkhill no aid in the trial of\r\nthe assassin until President Arthur gave peremptory instructions\r\nthat Messrs. Porter and Davidge should be employed.  They came in\r\nto the case at a late day, and were forced to depend almost wholly\r\nupon the District-Attorney for bearings.\r\n\r\nColonel George A. Corkhill, the District Attorney, was a native of\r\nOhio, then forty-four years of age.  After graduating from the Iowa\r\nWesleyan University he entered Harvard Law School, where he remained\r\nover a year, when, at the breaking out of the Rebellion, he entered\r\nthe army, serving faithfully until the close of the war.  After\r\nhaving practiced at St. Louis, he married a daughter of Justice\r\nMiller, of the Supreme Court, and came to Washington in 1872 as\r\neditor of the _Daily Chronicle_.  In January, 1880, President Hayes\r\nappointed him District Attorney.\r\n\r\nFrom the day on which General Garfield was shot, Colonel Corkhill\r\nbegan industriously to \"work up the case.\"  He obtained the evidence,\r\nstudied precedents, hunted up witnesses, and, unaided by any other\r\ncounsel, had Guiteau indicted and arraigned.  The admirable\r\npreparation of the case, the spirit of justice, the fairness so\r\nliberally extended to the prisoner and his counsel, and the judicious\r\nand effective conduct of the trial to a just and satisfactory\r\nconclusion were mainly due to him.  His management of the case from\r\nthe start was beyond all praise.  From his opening speech he\r\ndisplayed great good sense, added to a perfect understanding of\r\nthe facts, a marked talent for criminal practice, thorough judgment\r\nof men, and an extraordinary dignity of bearing.  With admirable\r\ntemper and self-control, he submitted to indignity and insult in\r\nthe court-house, which the judge was unable to restrain, and to\r\nunmerited obloquy, without arousing misapprehension and misconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted eleven weeks, but it could not be said to have\r\nbeen a wearying or tiresome exhibition.  On the contrary, none of\r\nthe sensational plays that had been in vogue for years past had\r\nbeen crowded with more dramatic situations and unexpected displays.\r\n\r\nThis most remarkable of criminal trials came at last to an end,\r\nand the promptitude of the jury in rendering a verdict of \"guilty,\"\r\nconveyed a sharp rebuke to the lawyers who spent so many wearisome\r\ndays in summing up the case.  In due time atonement for the great\r\ncrime was made on the scaffold, so far, at least, as human laws\r\ncan go.  The nation then rested easier and breathed freer, happy\r\nin the fact that the meanest of cowardly knaves had passed to his\r\nlong account.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Leut Genl P.H. Sheridan\r\nPHILIP HENRY SHERIDAN was born at Somerset, Ohio, March 6th, 1831;\r\nwas graduated from the Military Academy at West Point, and commissioned\r\nas Brevet Second Lieutenant July 1st, 1853; served on the Pacific\r\ncoast, and at the outbreak of the War for the Suppression of the\r\nRebellion was Chief Quartermaster of the Army of Missouri;\r\ndistinguished himself as a cavalry commander; he was made Brigadier\r\nand then Major-General of Volunteers, and received the commission\r\nof Major-General in the regular army for his gallantry at Cedar\r\nCreek, October 19th, 1864, when he achieved a brilliant victory\r\nfor the third time in pitched battle within thirty days; was promoted\r\nto the rank of Lieutenant-General March 4th, 1869, and became\r\nCommander of the Army on the retirement of General Sherman, February\r\n8th, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nVICE-PRESIDENT ARTHUR BECOMES PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nWhen President Garfield was assassinated Vice-President Arthur was\r\non his way from Albany to New York, on a steamboat, and received\r\nthe intelligence on landing.  That night he went to Washington,\r\nwhere he was the guest of Senator Jones, who then occupied the\r\nlarge granite house directly south of the Capitol, erected a few\r\nyears previously by General Butler.  On the evening of July 4th,\r\nwhen the President's death seemed imminent, Secretary Blaine visited\r\nMr. Arthur and said:  \"The end is at hand; the President is dying;\r\nyou must prepare to assume the responsibilities which the Constitution\r\nplaces upon you in such an event.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur, sick with sorrow, reluctantly accepted as true the\r\nstatement respecting the President's condition, and replied that\r\nwhen the Cabinet and Justice Field, the senior Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court, then in Washington, should call upon him, he would\r\nbe ready to take the oath of office.  Soon afterward, while waiting\r\nin sorrowful expectation that the next moment might bring him the\r\nsad news that the President had died, the door-bell was rung\r\nviolently, and an orderly handed in a message from Secretary Blaine,\r\nwhich the Vice-President eagerly snatched, opened, and read.  \"Thank\r\nGod!\" he said, handing it to Senator Jones.\r\n\r\nIt announced that with the rising of the cool breeze, the President's\r\ncondition had changed for the better.  No apprehension of his\r\nimmediate death was entertained.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a correspondent who called on the Vice-President\r\nalluded to editorials in a Democratic paper at Louisville, and a\r\nRepublican paper at New York, connecting his name and that of\r\nSenator Conkling with Guiteau's crime.  The Vice-President seemed\r\ndeeply moved by these insinuations.  \"No one,\" he said, \"deplores\r\nthe calamity more than Senator Conkling and myself.  These reports\r\nare so base and so unfounded that I cannot believe they will be\r\ncredited.  They do not affect Senator Conkling and myself as much\r\nas they do the entire country.  They are a slur upon our institutions,\r\nan attack upon the integrity of republican government.  Good God!\r\nif such a thing were possible, then liberty is impossible.  Such\r\na calamity as this should be treated as national, not only by every\r\ncitizen, but by the entire press of the country.  Party and faction\r\nshould be forgotten in the general grief.\"\r\n\r\nAfter condemning the perpetrator of the crime in the strongest\r\nterms, the Vice-President said:  \"If it were possible for me to be\r\nwith the President, I would not only offer him my sympathy, I would\r\nask that I might remain by his bedside.  All personal considerations\r\nand political views must be merged in the national sorrow.  I am\r\nan American among millions of Americans grieving for their wounded\r\nchief.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President remained at Washington until the President was\r\ntaken to Long Beach.  He continued to experience great mental\r\nanguish, never even alluding to the chances of his becoming President\r\nof the United States.  He went from Washington to his own home in\r\nNew York, where he received news of the President's death on the\r\nevening of its occurrence.  It had been determined between Vice-\r\nPresident Arthur and the members of the Cabinet that in the event\r\nof the President's death his successor should be sworn in without\r\ndelay.  Justice Brady was sent for, and the oath was administered\r\nin the presence of eight persons.  At its conclusion the President,\r\nwho had stood with uplifted hand, said, impressively, \"So help me,\r\nGod, I do!\"  A few moments afterward his son, Alan, approached,\r\nand laying one hand on his father's shoulder, kissed him.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur repeated the oath of office in the Vice-President's\r\nroom at the Capitol on the twenty-second of September.  The members\r\nof General Garfield's Cabinet, who had been requested by his\r\nsuccessor to continue for the present in charge of their respective\r\ndepartments, were then present, with General Sherman in full uniform,\r\nex-Presidents Hayes and Grant, and Chief Justice Waite, in his\r\njudicial robes, escorted by Associate Justices Harlan and Matthews.\r\nThere were also present Senators Anthony, Sherman, Edmunds, Hale,\r\nBlair, Dawes, and Jones, of Nevada, and Representatives Amos\r\nTownsend, McCook, Errett, Randall, Hiscock, and Thomas.  Ex-Vice-\r\nPresident Hamlin, of Maine, and Speaker Sharpe, of New York, were\r\nalso present.\r\n\r\nWhen President Arthur entered the room, escorted by General Grant\r\nand Senator Jones, he advanced to a small table, on which was a\r\nBible, and behind which stood the Chief Justice, who raised the\r\nsacred volume, opened it, and presented it to the President, who\r\nplaced his right hand upon it.  Chief Justice Waite then slowly\r\nadministered the oath, and at its conclusion the President kissed\r\nthe book, responding \"I will, so help me God!\"  He then read a\r\nbrief but eloquent inaugural address.\r\n\r\nAs President Arthur read his inaugural address his voice trembled,\r\nbut his manner was impressive, and the eyes of many present were\r\nmoistened with tears.  The first one to congratulate him when he\r\nhad concluded was Chief Justice Waite, and the next was Secretary\r\nBlaine.  After shaking him by the hand, those present left the\r\nroom, which was closed to all except the members of the Cabinet,\r\nwho there held their first conference with the President.  At this\r\nCabinet meeting a proclamation was prepared and signed by President\r\nArthur, designating the following Monday as a day of fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur soon showed his appreciation of the responsibilities\r\nof his new office.  Knowing principles rather than persons, he\r\nsubordinated individual preferences and prejudices to a well-defined\r\npublic policy.  While he was, as he always had been, a Republican,\r\nhe had no sympathy for blind devotion to party; he had \"no friends\r\nto reward, no enemies to punish,\" and he was governed by those\r\nprinciples of liberty and equality which he inherited.  His messages\r\nto Congress were universally commended, and even unfriendly critics\r\npronounced them careful and well-matured documents.  Their tone\r\nwas more frank and direct that was customary in such papers, and\r\ntheir recommendations, extensive and varied as they were, showed\r\nthat he had patiently reviewed the field of labor so sadly and so\r\nunexpectedly opened before him, and that he was not inclined to\r\nshirk the constitutional duty of aiding Congress by his suggestions\r\nand advice.  An honest man, who believed in his own principles,\r\nwho followed his own convictions, and who never hesitated to avow\r\nhis sentiments, he gave his views in accordance with his deliberate\r\nideas of right.\r\n\r\nThe foreign relations of the United States were conducted by\r\nSecretary Frelinghuysen, under the President's direction, in a\r\nfriendly spirit, and, when practicable, with a view to mutual\r\ncommercial advantages.  He took a conservative view of the management\r\nof the public debt, approving all the important suggestions of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and recognizing the proper protection of\r\nAmerican industry.  He was in favor of the great interests of labor,\r\nand opposed to such tinkering with the tariff as would make vain\r\nthe toil of the industrious farmer, paralyze the arm of the sturdy\r\nmechanic, strike down the hand of the hardy laborer, stop the\r\nspindle, hush the loom, extinguish the furnace fires, and degrade\r\nall independent toilers to the level of the poor in other lands.\r\nThe architect of his own fortune, he had a strong and abiding\r\nsympathy for those bread-winners who struggle against poverty.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the civil service met with President Arthur's earnest\r\nsupport, and his messages showed that every department of the\r\nGovernment had received his careful administration.  Following the\r\nexample of Washington, he had personally visited several sections\r\nof the United States, and had especially made himself thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the great and complicated problem of Indian\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's Administration was characterized by an elevated\r\ntone at home and abroad.  All important questions were carefully\r\ndiscussed at the council table, at which the President displayed\r\nunusual powers of analysis and comprehension.  The conflicting\r\nclaims of applicants for appointments to offices in his gift were\r\ncarefully weighed, and no action was taken until all parties\r\ninterested had a hearing.  The President had a remarkable insight\r\ninto men, promptly estimating character with an accuracy that made\r\nit a difficult matter to deceive him, or to win his favor either\r\nfor visionary schemes, corrupt attacks upon the Treasury, or\r\nincompetent place-hunters.\r\n\r\nPossessing moral firmness and a just self-reliance, President Arthur\r\ndid not hesitate about vetoing the \"Chinese Bill,\" and the \"Bill\r\nmaking Appropriations for Rivers and Harbors,\" for reasons which\r\nhe laid before Congress in his veto messages.  The wisdom and\r\nsagacity which he displayed in his management of national affairs\r\nwas especially acceptable to the business interests of the country.\r\nThey tested his administration by business principles, and they\r\nfelt that so long as he firmly grasped the helm of the ship of\r\nstate, she would pursue a course of peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur convened the Senate for the transaction of executive\r\nbusiness on the 10th of October, 1881.  The galleries of the Senate\r\nChamber were filled at an early hour on that day, and those who\r\nhad the privilege of the floor availed themselves of it.  Roscoe\r\nConkling's absence was, of course, noticed by those who had seen\r\nhim occupying a seat in the very centre of the Senate Chamber during\r\nthe past fourteen years.  That seat was occupied by Angus Cameron,\r\nof Wisconsin, a gray-haired, tall, spare man, who lacked only the\r\nkilt and plaid to make him a perfect Scotchman.  General Burnside's\r\nseat was occupied by Eugene Hale, a graceful and ready debater,\r\nwhile in the place of Mr. Blaine was Senator Frye, his successor.\r\nSenator Edmunds returned rejuvenated, and although he appeared to\r\nmiss his old friend and antagonist, Senator Thurman, he gave potent\r\nevidence during the afternoon of his ability as an intellectual\r\ngladiator, strong in argument, ready in retort, and displaying\r\ngreat parliamentary keenness and knowledge of affairs.\r\n\r\nSenator Anthony, the Republican nominee for the President of the\r\nSenate _pro tempore_, sat a quiet observer of the contest, and\r\naround him were Allison, Sherman, Dawes, Ingalls, Hoar, Logan, and\r\nthe other Republican war-horses, with the more recent comers,\r\nincluding Hale, Mitchell, and Conger.  With them, if not of them,\r\nwas General Mahone, with the delicate frame of a woman, a large\r\nhead covered with flowing brown hair, sharp, piercing eyes, a\r\nflowing beard, and a manner which showed his revolutionary\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nMr. Pendleton, portly and gentlemanly, was the central figure on\r\nthe Democratic side, as their caucus Chairman.  At the commencement\r\nof the session, the Democratic nominee for the Presidency--Bayard\r\n--sat by his side to give him counsel.  Senator Harris, of Tennessee,\r\nwho would have liked himself to be President _pro tem._, was a\r\nbetter parliamentarian, to whom the rules and the manual were as\r\nfamiliar as \"household words.\"  Senator Jones, of Florida, the best\r\nConstitutional lawyer in the body, had some volumes of debates on\r\nhis desk, and was examining the precedents.  Senator Ben. Hill sat\r\nleaning back in his chair apparently rather dejected, but his\r\ncountenance lighted up as he gave Edmunds a cordial greeting.\r\nSenators Lamar and Butler, and Ransom and Hampton, were all in\r\ntheir seats, and on the sofa behind them were ex-Senators Gordon\r\nand Withers, and a dozen or more Democratic Representatives.\r\n\r\nAfter prayer had been offered and the President's proclamation had\r\nbeen read, Senator Pendleton offered a resolution declaring Mr.\r\nBayard President _pro tem_.  Senator Edmunds adroitly endeavored\r\nto secure the admission of Messrs. Lapham, Miller, and Aldrich,\r\nbut in vain.  At first, Senator Davis voted with the Republicans\r\nin a low and undecided tone, but when the final vote came he did\r\nnot vote at all.  This was interpreted to mean that he would not\r\nvote, after the three Senators had been admitted, to oust Mr.\r\nBayard, and without his vote it could not be done.\r\n\r\nThe next day Senators Lapham and Miller, of New York, and Aldrich,\r\nof Rhode Island, were duly qualified, and the Republicans reversed\r\nthe election of the preceding day by electing Senator David Davis\r\nPresident _pro tem_.  He was not willing to aid in the election of\r\nSenator Anthony as presiding officer and he voted to oust Senator\r\nBayard from the chair, but abstained from voting when his own name\r\nwas presented by Senator Logan.  Senator Davis, then in his sixty-\r\nseventh year, was a genial gentleman, and moved about with great\r\nactivity, considering that he weighed some three hundred and fifty\r\npounds.  On that day he was more carefully dressed than usual,\r\nwearing a black broadcloth coat, light trousers and vest, a white\r\ncravat, and low-quartered shoes.  He knew what was in store for\r\nhim, and a placid smile showed his satisfaction.  It was as good\r\nas a play to see him, his broad countenance wreathed in smiles,\r\nescorted to the President's chair by Senator Bayard, who had been\r\ndeposed by his vote, and by Senator Anthony, who would have been\r\nelected if Davis would have voted for him.  In a brief speech he\r\naccepted the position as a tribute to the independent ground which\r\nhe claimed to have long occupied in the politics of the country.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Chester A. Arthur\r\nCHESTER ALAN ARTHUR was born at Fairfield, Vt., October 5th, 1830;\r\nwas graduated from Union College in 1845; studied law and commenced\r\npractice in New York city; was appointed by President Grant Collector\r\nof the Port of New York in November, 1871; was elected Vice-President\r\non the Garfield ticket, and inaugurated, March 4th, 1881; on the\r\ndeath of President Garfield, September 19th, 1881, he became\r\nPresident, serving until March 4th, 1885; died in New York, November\r\n18th, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nTHE CENTENNIAL OF YORKTOWN.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur was a man of gracious presence, of good education,\r\nof extensive reading, and of courteous manners, refined by his\r\nhaving mingled in New York society.  He was always well dressed,\r\nusually wearing in his office a Prince Albert coat, buttoned closely\r\nin front, with a flower in the upper button-hole, and the corner\r\nof a colored silk handkerchief visible from a side pocket.  Dignified,\r\nas became his exalted station, he never slapped his visitors'\r\nshoulders, or called them by their Christian names, but he treated\r\nthem as entitled to his consideration without that stilted courtesy\r\nwhich rebuffs even when veneered with formal civility.  He was a\r\ngood listener and he conversed freely, although he carefully avoided\r\ncommitting himself upon political questions, and never indulged in\r\ncriticisms of those arrayed in opposition to him.  The code of\r\netiquette first adopted by General Washington on the recommendation\r\nof General Hamilton, from which there had been departures in recent\r\nyears, was re-established, except that President Arthur occasionally\r\naccepted invitations to dinner.  He devotedly cherished the memory\r\nof his deceased wife, before whose picture in the White House a\r\nvase of fresh flowers was placed daily, and he was affectionately\r\nwatchful over his son Alan, a tall student at Princeton College,\r\nand his daughter Nellie, who was just entering into womanhood.\r\n\r\nSoon after the commencement of the October session of Congress,\r\nWashington was enlivened by the official reception of the French\r\nand German officers, who came as the nation's guests to witness\r\nthe dedication of a national monument at Yorktown on the centennial\r\nof the victory which those nations helped the revolutionary colonists\r\nto win.  The day was bright and sunny, and there was a general\r\ndisplay of flags, those of France and Germany mingling with the\r\nstars and stripes.  There were nearly forty of the guests, all\r\nwearing the uniforms of their respective positions.  The Frenchmen\r\nregarded the Germans with manifest hatred, while the latter evidently\r\nremembered that their comrades had recently triumphantly occupied\r\nthe French capital.\r\n\r\nThe guests, under the escort of the French and German Ministers,\r\nwere first driven to the Department of State.  There, Assistant-\r\nSecretary Hitt received them at the foot of the staircase and led\r\nthe way to the diplomatic reception-room.  There they were cordially\r\nreceived by Secretary Blaine, to whom each one was presented, and\r\nhe then presented them to the other members of the Cabinet.  Many\r\ncomplimentary remarks were interchanged, but there were no set\r\nspeeches; and after remaining a quarter of an hour or so the guests\r\nre-entered their carriages and were escorted to the Capitol.\r\nPennsylvania Avenue presented an animated appearance, the gay and\r\nvaried dresses of the ladies at the windows and on the sidewalks\r\nforming a kaleidoscopic framework for the column of citizen soldiers.\r\nThe District militiamen never looked better nor stepped more proudly,\r\nand five companies of colored men marched with the swinging gait\r\nof veterans.  The civic portion of the procession was a failure,\r\nbut this was atoned for by the well-organized Fire Department with\r\nits apparatus.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, those fortunate in having received invitations congregated\r\nin the rotunda of the Capitol, which was still heavily draped in\r\nblack in honor of the last assassinated President, whose remains\r\nhad lain in state there but a few days previously.  Among the\r\ngentlemen and ladies who had been asked to witness the welcome\r\nextended by the Chief Magistrate to the representatives of our\r\nancient allies were General Sherman, wearing his showy gala uniform,\r\na score or more of other military and naval officers, Senator Dawes\r\nand wife, Commissioner Loring and wife, nearly all of the Senators,\r\nand a few Representatives.\r\n\r\nAt last the nation's guests entered from the eastern portico,\r\npreceded by Secretary Blaine and the French Minister, and walking\r\nby twos, according to their respective ranks.  Passing around the\r\nsoutheastern wall, the head of the column halted before the door\r\nleading to the House of Representatives.  The gay uniforms worn by\r\nthe greater portion of them relieved the sombreness of the black\r\nsuits of their civilian associates.  Monsieur Outrey, the French\r\nMinister, wore a black dress suit, while Herr von Scholzer, the\r\ndiplomatic representative of Germany, appeared in a gold-embroidered\r\ncourt dress.  The French army officers all wore red trousers, with\r\nthe exception of one in white breeches and high boots, and their\r\nuniforms and equipments were very handsome.  The Germans had a more\r\nsoldier-like appearance, as if they meant business and not show.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur, who had not removed from \"Castle Butler\" to the\r\nWhite House, came over, and for the first time occupied the\r\nPresident's room adjacent to the Senate Chamber.  Secretary Blaine\r\nwent there for him, and advanced with him to where the French\r\nMinister stood in the rotunda.  President Arthur was attired in a\r\nfull suit of black, with black cravat and gloves.  The French\r\nMinister introduced the President to the French guests, and then\r\nthe German Minister introduced him to the German guests.  Secretary\r\nLincoln then passed along the line with the army officers, and then\r\ncame Secretary Hunt with the naval officers.  Pleasant little\r\nspeeches were exchanged, and there was no end of bowing and hand-\r\nshaking.\r\n\r\nAs the hour of three approached, the Senators gradually returned\r\nto their desks in the Senate Chamber, and they found the galleries,\r\nwhich they had left empty, filled with ladies, whose bright attire\r\nwas equal to the variegated hues of a bed of blooming tulips.  Some\r\nroutine business was transacted, and then the nation's guests, who\r\nhad been accorded the privilege of the floor, came in, escorted by\r\nMr. Blaine, and took a row of seats which encircled the chamber\r\nbehind the desks.  Senator Bayard then rose, and in an eloquent\r\nand graceful little speech alluded to the presence of the distinguished\r\ncitizens of our sister Republic of France and the Empire of Germany,\r\nwho had come here to join in celebrating the victory of Yorktown.\r\nHe concluded by asserting that he spoke the sentiments of the\r\nAmerican Senate by saying that they were most welcome, and moved\r\na recess of half an hour, that the Senators might individually pay\r\ntheir respects to them.  The motion was carried amid loud applause,\r\nand then the visitors were presented to President David Davis and\r\nthe Senators.  When the introductions were over, the guests were\r\nshown to their carriages and driven back to the Arlington.\r\n\r\nAs the evening approached and the twilight deepened crowds flocked\r\nto the White House grounds and vicinity to witness the display of\r\nfireworks.  Pennsylvania Avenue was brilliant with electric and\r\ncalcium lights and myriads of paper lanterns.  The fireworks were\r\nvery excellent, and several of the pieces were loudly applauded.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur and his Cabinet, with many Senators and Representatives,\r\nofficers of the army and navy, and their ladies went with the\r\nnation's guests to Yorktown on a fleet of steamboats.  There the\r\nGovernors of the original States, each with a militia escort, with\r\na military and naval force of regulars, joined in the centennial\r\nexercises.  Virginia hospitality was dispensed on the Congressional\r\nsteamer by Senator Johnston, Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements,\r\nwho exceeded the liberal appropriation some twenty thousand dollars,\r\nmuch of which was for liquors and champagne.  Congress finally\r\nvoted the necessary amount without the filing of detailed vouchers.\r\n\r\nSecretary Blaine's entertainment to the nation's guests, at Wormley's\r\nHotel, was the most sumptuous and enjoyable evening party ever\r\ngiven at Washington.  The doors connecting the parlors and those\r\nleading into the hall had been removed, and in their places were\r\ncurtains of gray damask, bordered with cardinal red.  The stars\r\nand stripes were conspicuously displayed, and there was a lavish\r\ndisplay of rare plants, variegated foliage, and vines.  From the\r\nkeystones of the arches which divided the rooms were suspended\r\nfloral globes, and the chandeliers were festooned with garlands.\r\nIn the hall was the full Marine Band, in evening dress, with their\r\nstring and reed instruments.\r\n\r\nA few moments before ten o'clock Secretary and Mrs. Blaine arrived,\r\nand took their position in the outside parlor, near the entrance.\r\nMr. Blaine was in excellent health and spirits, displaying that\r\n_bonhomie_ for which he is so justly famed.  Mrs. Blaine wore an\r\nevening dress of white brocaded satin, with a long train, trimmed\r\nwith lace and pearls.\r\n\r\nAn usher, who knew every one, and who could pronounce the names\r\nand give the rank of the numerous foreigners, announced the guests\r\nas they entered.  The French were the first to arrive, followed by\r\nthe Germans, and after they had paid their respects they were ranged\r\nnext to Mr. Blaine, and the other guests, as they arrived, were\r\nalso presented to them.  The French and German officers wore their\r\nrespective uniforms, with their decorations of various orders of\r\nknighthood, and the civilians were in full evening dress, many\r\nwearing decorations.  Madame la Marquise de Rochambeau wore an\r\nevening dress of royal purple, moire antique silk, trimmed with\r\nheliotrope plush and a profusion of rare lace.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Corps was out in force, and several of the Foreign\r\nMinisters were accompanied by their wives.  Madame Outrey, wife of\r\nthe French Minister, wore a white brocade with a sweeping train,\r\ntrimmed with lace, and a rare set of diamonds.  Madame Bartholomei,\r\nwife of the Russian Minister, wore a court dress of black satin\r\nbrocade, trimmed with jet, and a magnificent set of emeralds and\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nThe army was well represented, headed by General Sherman in his\r\ngala uniform, with its golden baldric, and there were Admirals and\r\nCommodores enough to man a vessel.  The foreigners were much\r\ninterested in Admiral Worden, who commanded the Monitor in the\r\ncritical iron-clad fight.\r\n\r\nA quorum of the Senate was present, with their burly President,\r\nDavid Davis, and there were not a few Representatives, including\r\nMessrs. Kasson and Hiscock, the rival candidates for the Speakership.\r\nSenators Cameron, Bayard, Voorhees, and Butler were accompanied by\r\ntheir daughters.  Chief Justice Waite and nearly all of the Associate\r\nJustices were present, and also the members of the Cabinet, with\r\nthe exception of Attorney-General MacVeagh, who, of course, stayed\r\naway.  The journalists invited, several of them accompanied by\r\ntheir wives, showed that Mr. Blaine never forgot his original\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\nThe supper-table extended the whole length of the dining-room, and\r\nit was laid with exquisite taste.  The ware was the finest Dresden\r\nchina, much of the silver was gilded, and the glass was of the\r\nnewest patterns.  A profusion of roses in low mounds set off these\r\nappointments to great advantage.  As for the _menu_, it comprised\r\nterrapin, canvas-backs, oysters, and saddles of mutton, with all\r\nthe recognized masterpieces of French culinary art.  Even the young\r\nFrench and German officers, who had scowled at each other as they\r\nhad bowed salutations with formal politeness earlier in the evening,\r\nfraternized at the supper-table.  I saw a young Frenchman look\r\napprovingly on as a stalwart German Captain effected an entrance\r\ninto a Strasburg pie and dealt out its toothsome contents, and the\r\nTeutons, whose favorite tipple had been beer, kept up a fusillade\r\nof champagne corks as they filled the glasses of their fair partners.\r\nAfter the supper, the guests returned to the spacious parlors, where,\r\nto the witching strains of the Marine Band, the merry dancers chased\r\nthe hours with flying feet until long after the midnight stars had\r\nstruggled through the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe next night, while the Von Steubens were at Baltimore enjoying\r\nthe torchlight procession and the Fatherland songs of their\r\ncountrymen, Mr. Blaine treated the French guests to a sight of the\r\nCapitol, brilliantly lighted up from dome to basement.  The effect\r\nwhen seen from without was fairy-like, and within the noble\r\nproportions of the rotunda, the legislative halls, and the long\r\ncorridors were disclosed to great advantage.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening Monsieur Max Outrey, the Minister of France,\r\ngave a reception in honor of his visiting countrymen.  It was\r\nnoticeable that this _fete_ had been postponed until after the\r\ndeparture of the Germans, but Monsieur Outrey took care to mention\r\nthat they had been invited, but had sent \"a very sweet letter of\r\nregret.\"  The home guests invited were generally those who were at\r\nSecretary Blaine's reception the night previous, but the ladies of\r\nthe Legations were rather more handsomely dressed.  Monsieur Outrey\r\nwas enthusiastic in his praises of the liberal hospitality extended\r\nto his countrymen, who had, he said, drank more champagne since\r\nthey had been in Washington then they ever drank in all their lives\r\nat home, and who were really getting fatigued with their ceaseless\r\nround of entertainments.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  W. T. Sherman\r\n  General, 1885.\r\nWILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN was born in Lancaster County, Ohio, February\r\n8th, 1820; was graduated at the West Point Military Academy, June\r\n30th, 1840; served in Florida and California, 1840-1851; was\r\nPresident of the Louisiana State Military College, 1859-1861; served\r\nin the Union Army from 1861, receiving the appointment of Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral in July, 1866, and of General in March, 1869; went on the\r\nretired list in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nPRESIDENT ARTHUR'S ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Forty-seventh Congress, which was commenced\r\non the 5th of December, 1881, and prolonged until the 8th of August,\r\n1882, found the Republicans again in the possession of the Federal\r\nGovernment.  In the Senate, where the elephantine David Davis\r\npresided in his pleasant way, often disregarding parliamentary\r\nrules, there was a Republican majority of two, and in the House,\r\nwhich had elected as its Speaker that gallant, burly, impulsive\r\nson of Ohio, General J. Warren Keifer, there was a majority of ten.\r\nThese small majorities made the game of legislation the more\r\ninteresting, as every move had to be carefully studied before it\r\nwas made.  The proposed revision of the customs tariff and the\r\nInternal Revenue Tax Bill interested every member, as each had one\r\nor more pet industries belonging to favorite constituents, on which\r\nhe wanted the high war taxes or duties retained, while he boldly\r\nadvocated sweeping reductions on everything else.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's appointments of Judge Folger to the Treasury\r\nDepartment, of Mr. Frelinghuysen to the State Department, of Mr.\r\nBrewster to the Department of Justice, and of Mr. Howe to the Post-\r\nOffice Department were all predicted and expected, but no one looked\r\nfor Mr. Conkling's appointment to the vacant place on the bench of\r\nthe Supreme Court, as it was well known that he had only a few\r\nyears previous refused the Chief Justiceship.  The appointment gave\r\nMr. Conkling's enemies an opportunity to talk about his theatrical,\r\noverbearing manner, but his appointment met general approbation;\r\nsome, doubtless, feeling a relief that his political career would\r\nthus be ended.  The Senate confirmed the nomination, but Mr. Conkling\r\ndeclined the honor thus tendered.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the Forty-seventh Congress was the\r\nappointment of a joint committee of eight Senators and a Representative\r\nfor every State, to whom was referred so much of the message of\r\nPresident Arthur as related to the decease of General Garfield,\r\nwith instructions to report by what token of respect and affection\r\nCongress could express the deep grief of the nation.  The Committee\r\nreported, condoling with the widow of the deceased, and providing\r\nfor an oration on his life and character, to be pronounced before\r\nthe two houses of Congress and the high officials of Government,\r\nby the Hon. James G. Blaine.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the Hall of the House of Representatives on the 27th\r\nof February, when the Garfield Memorial services were held, would\r\nhave kindled the spark of oratorical fire in a less gifted man than\r\nMr. Blaine.  As he stood there at the Clerk's desk, looking over\r\nthe great assemblage before him, his glance must first have fallen\r\nupon the calm features and dignified presence of the President of\r\nthe United States, who was seated in the chair of honor, directly\r\nin front of his late Secretary of State.  Then Mr. Blaine must have\r\nmet the glance of his late associates in President Arthur's Cabinet\r\n--Folger, of impressive manner; Lincoln, to whom the proceedings\r\nof the day rekindled the saddest of recollections; Brewster,\r\nnoticeable by the quaintness of his dress; Kirkwood, of plain,\r\nhomely ways and dress, and the Creole-like Hunt.  By the side of\r\nthese Mr. Blaine saw his own successor in the Cabinet, Frelinghuysen\r\nand with him Postmaster-General Howe.  A little to the left,\r\nresplendent in gilt trappings and buttons, sat General Sherman,\r\nwith his weather-beaten and kindly face, and by his side plucky\r\nPhil. Sheridan, now gray and demure, and Hancock, of stately bearing.\r\nThere, too were Admiral Porter and Rear-Admiral Worden of the navy,\r\nmen of fame.\r\n\r\nIn another direction sat the Justices of the Supreme Court, clad\r\nin their flowing robes of office.  States were there represented\r\nby their Governors, and their Senators, and their Representatives,\r\nthrowing aside for the nonce the strife and partisanship incidental\r\nto legislative warfare, gave testimony by their respectful silence\r\nto the esteem in which they held the memory of the man, who, prior\r\nto the Chicago Convention, enjoyed the friendship of all his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nStill further back an area of sheen and color marked the position\r\nof the Diplomatic Corps, with its variety of costumes and decorations.\r\nYet further back were Fred. Douglass, conspicuous from his long\r\nwhite hair and strong features, and General Schenck, with hale,\r\nfirmly set face.  The orator's glance must have noted the venerable\r\nhistorian Bancroft, himself the orator of the day like this when\r\nLincoln's eulogy was pronounced, and by the side of Bancroft the\r\nphilanthropist, Corcoran, and next him, and to the President's\r\nleft, Cyrus W. Field.  As Mr. Blaine's glance was raised to the\r\ngalleries he must have been struck with the uniform sombreness of\r\nthe appearance of the embanked multitude of ladies, whose dark\r\nattire was peculiarly appropriate, forming, as it did, a kind of\r\nmourning frame around the living picture which was presented on\r\nthe floor.  In the President's gallery the orator could see the\r\nrefined lineaments of George William Curtis, or the English-like\r\nface of Henry James, Jr.  Such were the salient features of the\r\naudience to whom Mr. Blaine was to speak of Garfield.\r\n\r\nIt looked to some who knew Mr. Blaine well as if he felt tempted\r\nto cast aside the pile of manuscript heavily bordered with black,\r\nwhich he placed before himself, and to speak as inspiration suggested,\r\nso long did he stand before that remarkable audience before beginning.\r\nTo the audience the orator was second in interest only to the\r\nsubject of the oration.  Expectation was great respecting Mr.\r\nBlaine's treatment of the subject.  He was the dead man's closest\r\nfriend, and he was looked upon as the representative of one wing\r\nor division of a party within which was great bitterness.  To\r\nseparate his duty to the dead from due consideration for the living\r\nand balance the two was difficult, but he held the scales with such\r\nan even, steady hand, that neither the lovers of the dead President\r\nand his acts were disappointed or dissatisfied, nor the friends of\r\nthe living President offended.  He merely performed the duty assigned\r\nhim in a simple, earnest, manly, truthful, conscientious, becoming\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was not the \"plumed knight\" of political debate, impetuous\r\nand enthusiastic, but he read page after page with patient enunciation,\r\nhis resonant voice only faltering when for a moment it quivered\r\nwith emotion as he described the boyish joy of General Garfield as\r\nhe breathed the fresh morning air on the fatal day when he went\r\nforth to meet his doom.  The personal pronoun did not once occur\r\nin the whole eulogy, and not one single allusion was made that\r\ncould be thought of as referring to the speaker.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Blaine had finished there was a reverential silence.\r\nPresident Arthur, who seemed to have been deeply impressed, made\r\nno movement to go.  The immense audience was motionless.  It was\r\nthe most impressive moment of the day.  At length there was a faint\r\nstir.  Then President Arthur arose, and, with his Cabinet, silently\r\nleft the great hall.  The Supreme Court followed, and then the\r\ngreat assemblage quietly dissolved.  The last public ceremonial\r\nover the death of Garfield was finished.  It was just one year\r\nprevious that he had quitted his home at Mentor to come to Washington\r\nand be inaugurated as President of the United States.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur wore mourning for his predecessor six months,\r\ndressing in black, using writing paper with a broad black border,\r\ndeclining all invitations to theatrical performances, and giving\r\nno state entertainments at the White House.  At first he endeavored\r\nto bring about a millennium of political forces, but the \"stalwart\"\r\nlions refused to lie down with the \"half-breed\" lambs, and his\r\nhonest attempts to secure a reconciliation only provoked the enmity\r\nof both factions.  Before the burial of General Garfield a series\r\nof personal attacks was begun on his constitutional successor at\r\nthe White House, which were industriously kept up.  With a low\r\ncunning that generally concealed its malignancy, about once a\r\nfortnight some ingenious paragraph was started, ostensibly stating\r\nsome fact connected with the Federal Government, but really stabbing\r\nat President Arthur.  Unable to condemn his administration of\r\nnational affairs, his enemies sought by innuendo and misrepresentation\r\nto render him ridiculous and neglectful of the public interest.\r\nBut it so happened that President Arthur's Scotch-Irish character\r\ndisplayed itself in a practical utility never before known at the\r\nWhite House.  His extensive knowledge of State politics was constantly\r\ncalled into requisition in making appointments, while in his messages\r\nto Congress he made statements and suggestions with a strenuous\r\nconviction of their truth, as he stood like a sturdy sentinel before\r\nthe gates of the Constitution.  He \"made haste slowly\" and he made\r\nbut few blunders.\r\n\r\nThe President's daily life was very simple, although pains were\r\ntaken to make him out a _bon vivant_.  He usually rose about half-\r\npast nine, took a cup of coffee and a roll while dressing, and went\r\ninto his office, where he read his private letters, dictated replies\r\nto official communications, and courteously received Congressional\r\nand other place-hunters.  At noon he ate a light breakfast--no\r\nmeat, but oatmeal, fish, and fruit--and then returned to his desk,\r\nwhere he remained until four o'clock in the afternoon.  He then\r\ntook a drive or a ride on horseback, sometimes accompanied by his\r\ndaughter.  His family dinner hour was six, when his favorite repast\r\nwas a mutton-chop, with a glass of Bass' ale, or a slice of rare\r\nroast beef, with a glass of claret, hot baked potatoes, and the\r\nfruits of the season.  After dinner he returned to his work, reading\r\nthe many papers submitted to him by the heads of departments, and\r\nnot leaving his desk until the \"wee sma' hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Star-route\" trials were inaugurated by Attorney-General MacVeagh\r\nto bring reproach upon the Administrations of Grant and Hayes.\r\nThis system of \"extra allowances\" for carrying the United States\r\nmails dated back, however, to the days of William Taylor Barry,\r\nPostmaster-General under President Jackson.  A Democratic Committee\r\nof Congress which investigated the mismanagement of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, ascribed much of the rascality to \"the large disbursements\r\nof money under the name of extra allowances.  It is a puzzling\r\nproblem to decide whether this discretionary power, throughout its\r\nwhole existence, has done most mischief in the character of impostor\r\nupon the Department, or seducer to contractors.  It has, doubtless,\r\nbeen an evildoer in both guises.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Star-route\" system of plunder was, however, handed down from\r\nAdministration to Administration, and the contractors who were\r\nthereby enriched were called upon at each successive Presidential\r\nelection to contribute to the campaign fund.  This had been done\r\nin the Garfield and Hancock contest just concluded.  Mr. Jay A.\r\nHubbell, who was the custodian of the Republican campaign fund,\r\napplied to Assistant Postmaster-General Brady, who negotiated the\r\n\"Star-route\" contracts, for pecuniary aid, and was told that it\r\nshould be forthcoming, provided he could have a letter from General\r\nGarfield to exhibit to the contractors to spur them up to make\r\nliberal contributions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garfield wrote, on the 23d of August, 1880, not to Brady,\r\nbut to Hubbell:  \"Yours of the 19th received and contents noted.\r\nPlease say to Brady I hope he will give us all the assistance\r\npossible.  Please tell me how the Departments are doing.  As ever,\r\nyours.\"  The letter from Hubbell, to which this was a reply, was\r\nnever published, and General Garfield's friends afterward maintained\r\nthat he had not alluded to the \"Star-route\" contractors.  The\r\nletter, they maintained, was simply the expression of a hope that\r\nBrady, a citizen of Indiana, who was reputed to have made an immense\r\nfortune in \"Bell Telephone stock,\" would respond from his ample\r\nmeans in aid of his party in the life-and-death struggle then going\r\non in his own State.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General made a great display in his prosecution of\r\nsome of those who had enriched themselves by \"Star-route\" contracts,\r\nretaining eminent counsel, and bringing witnesses to Washington at\r\na great expense.  There was much rascality developed, and some\r\nreputations were smirched, but the disagreement of juries prevented\r\nany punishment of the offenders.  They regarded themselves as\r\npolitical victims and felt deeply wronged because of their prosecution\r\nby an Administration which they had certainly helped into power.\r\n\r\nThe people believed that the Star-route scandals, like the whisky\r\nfrauds, the bogus quarter-master's claims, the public-land seizures,\r\nand the steamship subsidy schemes, were \"ring\" relics of the war,\r\nwith their profligacy and corruption, on each one of which Colonel\r\nMulberry Sellers would have remarked:  \"There's millions in it.\"\r\nYet the lobbyists and schemers enriched by these plunder schemes,\r\nwho bore the brand of \"swindler\" in scarlet letters of infamy upon\r\ntheir foreheads, did not lose their places in Washington society.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  David D Porter\r\nDAVID D.

The foreign Ministers and the\r\nGovernment dignitaries go in state to pay their respects to the\r\nPresident, after which the old Knickerbocker custom of visiting\r\nfriends generally is kept up.  One is certain to see at the White\r\nHouse on New Year's Day all the prominent people of both sexes in\r\nWashington.  Then, too, it is the only place in the metropolis\r\nwhere the ladies can pass in review all of the new toilets, and\r\nsee what the leaders of fashion have designed since last season.\r\nIt is the only place where there is room for a large crowd to move\r\nabout easily and where the full effect of brilliant dressing can\r\nbe displayed.  The ladies invited to receive with the President,\r\nwith many others, are in evening costume, although walking-costumes\r\nare not uncommon.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's first New Year's reception was a brilliant\r\naffair.  Mrs. Frelinghuysen accompanied the President into the Blue\r\nRoom, and stood next to his sister, Mrs. McElroy, at his right\r\nhand, with the wives of the other ministers of the Cabinet.  When\r\nhis daughter and niece came in, he welcomed them with a happy smile\r\nand bent down and kissed them.  Their simple white ribbon sashes\r\nwere in refreshing contrast with the gorgeous costumes of the\r\ndiplomats.\r\n\r\nBrilliant as were the diamonds of Madame de Struve, the wife of\r\nthe Russian Minister, and effective as was the bronze golden silk\r\ndress, trimmed with gold beads, of the wife of Attorney-General\r\nBrewster, the \"observed of all observers\" was Dr. Mary Walker, who\r\ncame tripping in with elastic step, shook hands with President\r\nArthur, and was profusely poetical in wishing him the compliments\r\nof the season.  She wore a black broadcloth frock coat and pantaloons,\r\nand carried a high black silk hat in her left hand, while in her\r\nright she flourished a slender cane.  After leaving the President,\r\nshe passed along the line of ladies who received with him, giving\r\nto each a sweeping bow, and then went into the East Room, where\r\nshe was carefully scrutinized by the ladies.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar gave a most enjoyable dinner to a party of gentlemen\r\ninvited by him to meet Mr. Justice Gray, after his appointment to\r\nthe bench of the Supreme Court.  It was given at the hotel of Mr.\r\nWormley, the friend of Charles Sumner, and the guests assembled in\r\na parlor containing much of the furniture which adorned the house\r\nof the great Senator.  The guests met about seven o'clock, and\r\nafter an exchange of salutations, the large doors which form one\r\nside of the room were thrown open, and Senator Hoar informally\r\ninvited those present to gather around the magnificently furnished\r\ntable which presented itself.  Covers were laid for thirty-six\r\npersons, and the china, the silver, and the glassware were all rare\r\nand of beautiful design.  A belt of flowers encircled the table in\r\nfront of the plates, and within this inclosure were mounds of rare\r\nexotics and quaintly constructed ornaments of confectionery.  The\r\nplace of each guest was marked by a card, on which his name was\r\nprinted, and on this was an exquisite button-hole bouquet.  The\r\nbills of fare were on large sheets of cardboard, handsomely engraved,\r\nand the succession of thirteen courses, beginning with oysters and\r\nending with coffee, was an epicurean treat.  In accordance with\r\nWashington etiquette, President Arthur sat at the host's right\r\nhand, and on his right sat Judge Gray.  At the left of the host\r\nsat Chief Justice Waite; directly opposite sat Senator Dawes; at\r\nthe right hand end of the long table was George Bancroft, and at\r\nthe left hand end was Representative Harris.  There was not, of\r\ncourse, any speech-making or drinking of healths, but after the\r\ndessert had been served, gentlemen left their seats and sat in\r\nlittle groups around the table, chatting pleasantly until after\r\nmidnight.  Taken as a whole, dinner and guests, it was the finest\r\nentertainment that I have ever seen in Washington--and I have seen\r\na great many.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's first state dinner was given in honor of General\r\nand Mrs. Grant.  The parlors and the East Room were profusely\r\ndecorated with flowers, and in the dining-room were palm trees and\r\nother exotics massed in the corners, while the mantels were banked\r\nwith cut flowers.  There were thirty-four plates on the long table,\r\nin the centre of which was a plateau mirror, on which were roses\r\nand lilies of the valley.  On either side of it were tall gilt\r\ncandelabra bearing eleven wax lights each, and beyond these large\r\ngilt epergnes overflowing with Marechal Niel roses.  At the end of\r\nthe mirror were pairs of silver candelabra bearing shaded wax lights\r\nand oval cushions of white camelias set with roses and orchids.\r\nAt the extreme ends were round pieces of bon silene roses and lilies\r\nof the valley.  Around this elaborate centre decoration were ranged\r\ncrystal compotes and cut-glass decanters.  Large, flat corsage\r\nbouquets of roses, tied with satin ribbons, were laid at each lady's\r\nplate, and small _boutonnieres_ of rosebuds were provided for the\r\ngentlemen.  The cards were of heavy gilt-edge board, embossed with\r\nthe national coat-of-arms in gold, below which the name of each\r\nguest was written.  The Marine Band performed selections from\r\npopular operatic music.\r\n\r\nThe guests were received by President Arthur in the East Room.  At\r\neight o'clock dinner was announced, and the guests repaired to the\r\ndining-room in the following order, each lady taking a seat at the\r\nright hand of the gentleman who escorted her:  President Arthur,\r\nescorting Mrs. Grant, who wore a white satin dress with low neck\r\nand long train deeply flounced with lace, and a profusion of\r\ndiamonds; General Grant, escorting Mrs. Frelinghuysen, who wore a\r\nblack velvet dress with flowing train, opening in front, and showing\r\na petticoat of plaited black satin; Secretary Frelinghuysen,\r\nescorting Mrs. Lincoln, who wore a black velvet dress with sweeping\r\ntrain and rich jet trimmings; General Sherman, escorting Miss Beale,\r\nwho wore a white satin dress with a train of silver brocade, trimmed\r\nat the neck and sleeves with Valenciennes lace; Admiral Porter,\r\nescorting Miss Coleman, who wore a dress of terra-cotta satin\r\ntrimmed with flowered brocade and lace; Senator Anthony, escorting\r\nMrs. Logan, who wore a magnificent dress of wine-colored velvet\r\ntrimmed with Pompadour brocade; Senator Miller, escorting Mrs.\r\nKinsley, who wore a ball-dress of cardinal satin trimmed with\r\nbrocade; Senator Jones, of Nevada, escorting Mrs. Beale, who wore\r\na white satin dress trimmed with lace; Senator Cameron, of\r\nPennsylvania, escorting Mrs. John Davis, who wore a ball-dress of\r\nwhite satin trimmed with lace; General Beale, escorting Miss\r\nFrelinghuysen, who wore a dress of marine-blue velvet, with a long\r\ntrain trimmed with iridescent bugles; Secretary Folger, escorting\r\nMiss Cutts, who wore white satin trimmed with lace; Secretary\r\nLincoln, escorting Mrs. Secretary Chandler, who wore an exquisite\r\ndress of pale blue surah and crape; Postmaster-General Howe,\r\nescorting Mrs. Teller, who wore a dress of white satin; Attorney-\r\nGeneral Brewster, escorting Mrs. Cameron, who wore a pink satin\r\ndress elaborately trimmed with ruffles of rare lace; Secretary\r\nChandler, escorting Mrs. Brewster, who wore a dress of cardinal\r\nsatin with a court train embroidered with gold in large figures;\r\nSecretary Teller, escorting Miss Totten, who wore white satin\r\ntrimmed with white ruchings.\r\n\r\nDinner was served in fourteen courses, with which there were served\r\neight varieties of wines, each variety having its appropriate wine-\r\nglass.  The guests were two hours at the table, and the menu was\r\neulogized, especially the terrapin, which was highly commended by\r\nthe epicures who enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine was a prominent figure in Washington society, both social\r\nand political, after he left the Department of State, and there\r\nwas always a great desire to know his opinions on passing events.\r\nHis heath was excellent, and he never appeared to greater advantage.\r\nTall and portly, yet graceful in movement, his wealth of white hair\r\nset off his mobile, expressive features, with their never-quiet\r\ndark eyes.\r\n\r\nThe new house built by Mr. Blaine in the northwestern part of\r\nWashington was an imposing structure, covering an area of about\r\nseventy by seventy-five feet, and it was solid and substantial from\r\nits steep roof to its roomy basement.  The spacious halls and\r\nstairways were wainscoted, finished, and ceiled in oak; the drawing-\r\nroom, the dining-room, and the library were furnished in solid\r\nmahogany; and the chambers were finished in poplar and pine.  The\r\ngreat charm of the house was that each and every room, large and\r\nsmall, had its open fire-place, some of them surrounded by beautiful\r\nmantel-pieces, with carved wood and mirrors.  It was, indeed, an\r\nEnglish house, with its comforts set off by many Yankee contrivances.\r\n\r\nIn this house, on a bright morning of early spring, Colonel John\r\nT. Coppinger, of the United States army, was married to Miss Alice\r\nStanwood Blaine.  President Arthur adjourned the regular meeting\r\nof the Cabinet that he and his constitutional advisers might attend.\r\nThe Speaker of the House, with the Maine Senators and Representatives,\r\nleft their Congressional duties in order to be present.  The\r\nDiplomatic Corps, doubtless remembering the courtesies which they\r\nreceived from Mr. Blaine when Secretary of State, was out in full\r\nforce.  The army and navy were largely represented, the elite of\r\nfashionable society was present, and there was a good representation\r\nof the press.  All had congregated to show their good wishes toward\r\nthe family of the young bride.\r\n\r\nColonel Coppinger, who belongs to an old Roman Catholic family in\r\nIreland, served gallantly in the Papal Army, and coming to this\r\ncountry in 1861, was commissioned in the Fourteenth Infantry.  He\r\nreceived two brevets for \"gallant and meritorious services\" in a\r\nscore of engagements, and after having displayed great energy in\r\ncommand of troops operating against the Indians, he was made Acting\r\nInspector-General on the staff of General Pope, a position only\r\ngiven to those thoroughly versed in the manual, the drill, the\r\nequipment, and the discipline of the army.  He was forty-nine years\r\nof age, tall, erect, with clear, hazel eyes, gray hair and whiskers,\r\nand a martial deportment.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock, noon, was the hour fixed for the ceremony, and soon\r\nafter that time conversation was suddenly hushed, as the Rev. Dr.\r\nChapelle, of St. Matthew's Church, took his assigned position.  He\r\nwore a black robe with a cape, and carried a small prayer-book,\r\nfrom which he subsequently read the brief service used when a Roman\r\nCatholic is wedded to one not belonging to that Church.  A moment\r\nlater Mrs. Blaine came down the broad staircase on the arm of her\r\neldest son, Mr. Walker Blaine.  She wore a high-necked corsage of\r\nwine-colored velvet, with a satin dress and train of the same color,\r\ntrimmed with lace.\r\n\r\nSoon the bride came down the staircase leaning on the arm of her\r\nfather, who appeared somewhat impressed by the solemnity of the\r\noccasion.  She wore a dress of white satin with a sweeping train\r\ntrimmed with crystal, while an ample veil partially concealed her\r\nyouthful features and slight form.  She carried a bouquet of roses\r\nand lilies-of-the-valley.  Behind her came her only attendant, her\r\nyoung sister, Miss Hattie Blaine, who was dressed in white.  Mr.\r\nBlaine's other two sons and Miss Abigail Dodge, of Hamilton,\r\nMassachusetts, followed.\r\n\r\nAt the improvised altar, Colonel Coppinger, attended by Lieutenant\r\nEmmet, of the Ninth Cavalry, advanced to claim his bride.  As the\r\nhappy pair knelt before the altar, Mr. and Mrs. Blaine and Miss\r\nHattie stood at their right, and President Arthur, George Bancroft,\r\nand Miss Dodge stood at their left.  The service was quickly\r\nperformed, and after the parents, President Arthur was the first\r\nto salute the bride.  The guests were then presented seriatim to\r\nColonel and Mrs. Coppinger, and if good wishes could have been\r\nregarded as an augury of their future, there could have been no\r\ndoubt of their good fortunes.\r\n\r\nAfter congratulations had been offered, President Arthur escorted\r\nthe bride to the large dining-room.  There a table was bountifully\r\nspread, while on a sideboard were boxes of wedding-cake to be sent\r\nto friends at a distance.  It was not long before the bridegroom\r\nand bride left the festive scene to array themselves for their\r\njourney, and they quietly departed from the house to take the train\r\nfor Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Taken as a whole, the wedding\r\nsurpassed any similar festal scene ever witnessed at Washington,\r\nand was a hearty manifestation of good feeling toward the happy\r\ncouple and the parents of the bride.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming houses in Washington was that occupied\r\nfor some years by the British Legation, and which Admiral Porter\r\nrebuilt and refurnished with a portion of the large sum of prize-\r\nmoney received by him during the war.  It was a model of good taste\r\nand luxury, elegant without display, and perfect in all its\r\nappointments.  The square hall, with tessellated marble floor, led\r\ninto a suite of three parlors, opening into each other by arched-\r\nways, heavily draped with satin damask.  The central parlor was\r\nupholstered in crimson velvet, that on the right in drab, and that\r\non the left in blue.  The hangings and furniture were of colors to\r\nmatch.  The marble mantels were decorated with articles of virtu,\r\nand rare painting adorned the walls.  Leading from the crimson\r\nparlor was a long, wide ball-room, with waxed and polished floor,\r\nand rows of seats for the accommodation of dancers and spectators.\r\nNumberless crystal chandeliers emitted a flood of softened light,\r\nwhile flowers bloomed everywhere in pots, vases, and baskets in\r\nindescribable profusion.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Robert T.

Senator Anthony, who had been elected to a fifth term,\r\ncould not be sworn in as a Senator until after the commencement of\r\nthat term, and was consequently ineligible.  So Senator Edmunds\r\naccepted the position with the understanding that he would vacate\r\nit as soon as his friend from Rhode Island, by qualifying as a\r\nSenator, should be eligible for election.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate met, Senator Anthony was recovering from a severe\r\nillness, and it was not until the following week that he was able\r\nto appear in the Senate Chamber.  He entered leaning on the arm of\r\nhis colleague, Senator Aldrich, and as he took his accustomed seat,\r\nhis attention was attracted by a large bouquet of flowers, bearing\r\nthe name of a lady clerk who had been retained in place by his kind\r\noffices.  The Senators soon crowded around him with their\r\ncongratulations on his convalescence, and among the first were\r\nGeneral Butler, of South Carolina, maimed in the Confederate cause,\r\nand General Miller, of California, who lost his right eye in the\r\nUnion army at Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers and the reading of the journal, Senator Aldrich rose,\r\nand was recognized by the Chair as the \"senior Senator from Rhode\r\nIsland.\"  He announced the presence of his colleague, the Senator-\r\nelect, whose credentials had been filed, and asked that the oath\r\nof office might be administered to him.  The presiding officer\r\ninvited the Senator-elect to receive the oaths, and when Governor\r\nAnthony stood before him, he administered the regular oath of 1789,\r\nfirst taken by the parliamentary veteran in 1859, with the \"iron-\r\nclad oath\" that had been adopted in 1862.  As the good old man\r\nstood with uplifted hand, every other member of the Senate rose,\r\nand stood until the obligation had been administered--a merited\r\ncompliment to the _Pater Senatus_.  No other man, save Thomas Hart\r\nBenton, had ever been sworn in five consecutive times as Senator.\r\n\r\nClosing the book from which he had read the oaths, Senator Edmunds\r\nwas first to shake his old friend's hand.  Senator Anthony then\r\nresumed his seat, and nearly every Senator came to greet him,\r\nfollowed by the veteran officers of the Senate, who had always\r\nfound in him a true friend.  A few weeks later, Senator Edmunds\r\nresigned, and Senator Anthony was elected President _pro tem._,\r\nbut the precarious state of his health forced him, in a speech\r\nprompted by a heart overflowing with gratitude, to decline the\r\nhonor, and Senator Edmunds was recalled to the post of honor.\r\n\r\nSenator Anthony had twice before been chosen President _pro tem._\r\nof the Senate, and he had for a number of years past been the\r\nPresident in the caucus of Republican Senators.  It is in the caucus\r\nof the dominant party that legislation is shaped, and unanimity of\r\naction in open Senate secured.  Governor Anthony's tact and skill\r\nas a presiding officer had, doubtless, exercised a potent influence\r\nin harmonizing opposing views entertained by Republican Senators,\r\nand there was no Senator who could fill the chair, either in open\r\nSenate, in executive session, or in caucus, with more dignity and\r\nimpartiality than he.\r\n\r\nGeneral McCook, an Ohio soldier, and an ex-Representative from New\r\nYork city, was elected Secretary of the Senate, defeating George\r\nC. Gorham, who had been the candidate of the Republican caucus.\r\nThe Republican nominee for Sergeant-at-Arms, Mr. Riddleberger, was\r\nalso dropped, and Colonel Wm. P. Canaday, of North Carolina, was\r\nchosen.  At the commencement of the next session, Mr. Riddleberger\r\ntook his seat as a Senator from Virginia.\r\n\r\nA Democratic tidal wave had swept over the country at the preceding\r\nfall elections, and the Democrats had a considerable majority in\r\nthe House of Representatives.  John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, who\r\nwas elected Speaker, was a tall, well-made man, with a studious\r\nlook in his eyes, and the winning manners of Henry Clay.  He had\r\na sweet voice, and his expositions of parliamentary law in the\r\npreceding sessions had elevated him to the front rank of statesmanship\r\nin the opinion of the House.  His impartiality as a presiding\r\nofficer was recognized by all parties, and his firmness of purpose\r\ncould not be moved by corrupt intriguers or brawling sycophants.\r\nHe was also fortunate in having a devoted wife, tall and graceful,\r\nwhose attractive personal appearance was equaled by her well-balanced\r\nmind and her practical common sense.  As Mrs. Edmunds was at that\r\ntime absent from Washington, on the New Year's Day after her\r\nhusband's election as Speaker Mrs. Carlisle was \"the first lady in\r\nthe land,\" and stood at President Arthur's right hand during the\r\nofficial reception.\r\n\r\nWashington society was very gay during the closing year of President\r\nArthur's Administration.  The receptions to which invitations were\r\ngiven and those open to the public at the White House were largely\r\nattended, while there was a succession of balls, German masquerades,\r\nand receptions at the residences of diplomats, housekeeping Senators,\r\nofficials, and citizens.  Several entertainments were given \"for\r\ncharity's sake,\" which realized considerable sums, and the theatres\r\nalso were unusually well attended.\r\n\r\nThe world-weary rejoiced when the matin chimes of Lent announced\r\nthat the gay season was ended, but although gayety arrayed itself\r\nin sackcloth and sprinkled ashes broadcast, the sackcloth moved in\r\nthe waltz as its wearer tripped over the ashes.  There were successions\r\nof informal dancing parties, lunch parties, and card parties during\r\nthe penitential forty days, and then came the post-Lenten\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\nThe giving of good dinners was, however, the distinguishing feature\r\nof Washington society during the Arthur Administration.  The example\r\nwas set at the White House, where, instead of dinners supplied by\r\na caterer at two dollars a plate, with cheap wines of doubtful\r\norigin, a gastronomic artist served the delicacies of the season,\r\ncooked in the latest Parisian style, while the wines were of the\r\nrarest vintages, embodying the fervor of long Gascon summers, the\r\nwarmth of Burgundian suns, and the delicate flavor of Xeres.  Never\r\nhad epicures so enjoyed themselves at Washington, and they rejoiced\r\nwhen they contrasted his dispensation with the barbaric repasts of\r\nformer years, when \"hog and hominy\" was the principal dish, and\r\ntangle-foot whisky punch was the fashionable table beverage.\r\n\r\nWashington City was greatly improved during President Arthur's\r\nAdministration.  The National Museum was completed and opened to\r\nvisitors, the northern wing of the stupendous pile, the State, War,\r\nand Navy Department Building, was occupied, and that hideous\r\narchitectural monstrosity, the Pension Office, was built.  At the\r\nWest End scores of elegant private houses were erected, varying in\r\nsize from the palatial mansion built by Mr. Blaine to the rustic\r\ncabin of Joaquin Miller, and the small Queen Anne cottages, now so\r\npopular, and some of which are models of convenience and beauty.\r\nMany avenues and streets were repaved, others were planted with\r\nbordering lines of shade trees, and several of the large reservations\r\nwere adorned with statues and fountains.  The previously unfinished\r\ncity, which Governor Shepherd had \"lifted from out of the mud,\"\r\nbecame a national metropolis, in which the people of the country\r\ncould take pride.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the Washington National Monument, on the 22d of\r\nFebruary, 1885, was a fit conclusion to President Arthur's official\r\ncareer.  This work had been long in progress, as its record, engraved\r\non its aluminum tip, shows.  It is as follows:  \"Corner-stone laid\r\non bed of foundation, July 4, 1848.  First stone at height of 152\r\nfeet laid August 7, 1880.  Capstone set December 6, 1884.\"  The\r\nlaying of the capstone was duly celebrated.  The wind, at the top\r\nof the monument, was blowing at the rate of sixty miles an hour,\r\nand thousands of eye-glasses were pointed toward the little party\r\non the scaffoldings at the summit.  All on the upper platform, five\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the ground, spread a portion of the\r\ncement, and the capstone, weighing three thousand three hundred\r\npounds, was lowered into place.  The tip was then fitted and the\r\nwork was done, which fact was duly announced by flying the flag at\r\nthe top of the monument, and by the answering boom of cannon from\r\nvarious points below.\r\n\r\nThe day of final dedication was clear and cold, the ground around\r\nthe base of the majestic shaft was covered with encrusted snow,\r\nand the keen wind that came sweeping down the Potomac made it rather\r\nuncomfortable for those who were assembled there.  The regular\r\ntroops and the citizen soldiery were massed in close columns around\r\nthe base of the monument, the Freemasons occupied their allotted\r\nposition, and in the pavilion which had been erected were the\r\ninvited guests, the executive, legislative, and judicial officers;\r\nofficers of the army, the navy, the marine corps, and the volunteers;\r\nthe Diplomatic Corps, eminent divines, jurists, scientists, and\r\njournalists, and venerable citizens representing former generations,\r\nthe Washington National Monument Society, and a few ladies who had\r\nbraved the Arctic weather.  After addresses had been delivered by\r\nSenator Sherman, W. W. Corcoran, and Colonel Casey, the chief\r\nengineer, President Arthur made a few well-chosen remarks, and\r\nconcluded by declaring the monument dedicated from that time forth\r\n\"to the immortal name and memory of George Washington.\"  The cost\r\nof the structure has been nearly two millions of dollars, about\r\nhalf of which the Government has paid, the remainder having been\r\nsecured by the Monument Association.  After the exercises at the\r\nmonument, a procession was formed headed by Lieutenant-General\r\nSheridan, which marched along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol.\r\nThe President's special escort was the Ancient and Honorable\r\nArtillery Company of Massachusetts, chartered in 1638, which had\r\ncome to participate in the exercises of the day.  Two addresses\r\nwere delivered in the House of Representatives at the Capitol--one\r\n(which was read by ex-Governor Long) by Hon. Robert C. Winthrop,\r\nof Boston, who had delivered the address when the corner-stone was\r\nlaid in 1848, and the other by Hon. John W. Daniel, of Virginia.\r\nIn the evening the Ancient and Honorable Artillery attended a\r\nspecial reception at the White House, reciprocatory of courtesies\r\nextended by the corps to President Arthur, one of its honorary\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had been a Presidential campaign.  The National\r\nRepublican Convention met at Chicago on June 3d; on the 6th, James\r\nG. Blaine, of Maine, was nominated for President on the fourth\r\nballot, receiving five hundred and forty-one of the eight hundred\r\nand nineteen votes cast, and General John A. Logan, of Illinois,\r\nwas nominated for Vice-President without opposition.  The National\r\nDemocratic Convention met at Chicago on July 6th, and on the 11th\r\nHon. Grover Cleveland, of New York, was nominated for President on\r\nthe second ballot, receiving six hundred and eighty-four of the\r\neight hundred and twenty votes cast, and Thomas A. Hendricks, of\r\nIndiana, was nominated for Vice-President without opposition.  The\r\nNational Prohibition Convention met at Pittsburg on July 23d, and\r\nnominated for President ex-Governor St. John, of Kansas, and for\r\nVice-President William Daniel, of Maryland.  The National Greenback\r\nConvention met at Indianapolis on May 29th, and nominated for\r\nPresident General B. F. Butler, of Massachusetts, and for Vice-\r\nPresident A. M. West, of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential contest was disgracefully personal.  The private\r\ncharacters of the two prominent candidates were mercilessly assailed,\r\nand political principles were apparently forgotten in the degrading\r\ndesire to defame the nominees.  The result turned upon the vote in\r\nthe State of New York, which was very close.  The shrewdest political\r\nmanipulators were sent over the State to correct pretended\r\nirregularities, but it soon became evident that the Democrats had\r\nchosen the Cleveland electors by a decisive plurality.  The official\r\ncount showed five hundred and sixty-three thousand one hundred and\r\nfifty-four votes for Cleveland, against five hundred and sixty-two\r\nthousand and five votes for Blaine, twenty-five thousand and six\r\nvotes for St. John, and seventeen thousand and four votes for\r\nButler.  The total vote in the United States was four million nine\r\nhundred and thirteen thousand two hundred and forty-seven votes\r\nfor Cleveland, four million eight hundred and forty thousand eight\r\nhundred and twenty-five votes for Blaine, one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand one hundred and thirty-four votes for St. John, and one\r\nhundred and thirty-four thousand and twenty-eight votes for Butler.\r\n\r\n[ Cleveland 563,154 in New York, 4,913,247 overall\r\n  Blaine    562,005              4,840,025\r\n  St. John   25,006                150,134\r\n  Butler     17,004                134,028        ]\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur's numerous friends contemplated his departure from\r\nthe White House without regret, and were confident that his\r\nAdministration would present a creditable appearance on the pages\r\nof impartial history.  Utility to the country had been the rule of\r\nhis official life, and he attained that high standard of official\r\nexcellence which prevailed in the early days of the Republic, when\r\nhonesty, firmness, and patriotism were the characteristics of public\r\nmen.  He saw himself deserted by influential early associates\r\nbecause he would not avenge their political grievances, while those\r\nwhom he protected ungratefully repaid him by defeating the election\r\nof his friend, Judge Folger, as Governor of the State of New York\r\n--a treacherous demonstration of partisan bigotry, which killed\r\nthe Judge as certain as the assassin's bullet killed Garfield.\r\nUnder President Arthur's lead, the Republican party, disorganized\r\nand disheartened when he came into power, became gradually strengthened\r\nand united before the Presidential election, in which it was very\r\nnear being victorious.\r\n\r\nPresident Arthur, in his desire to administer his inherited duties\r\nimpartially, made himself enemies among those who should have been\r\nhis friends.  Before President Garfield was interred, General Grant\r\nasked that his own personal friend, General Beale, might be appointed\r\nSecretary of the Navy, and he never forgave President Arthur for\r\nnot complying with his request.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Judge Robertson from the New York Custom House would\r\ndoubtless have been acceptable to Roscoe Conkling, but it was not\r\nmade, and the ex-Senator, after refusing the tendered appointment\r\nof a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nturned his back on his former friend.  Appointments which had been\r\npromised by Mr. Blaine, when President Garfield's Secretary of\r\nState, were invariably made, although the recipients had personally\r\nabused President Arthur, yet the \"Garfield Avengers,\" as the\r\nofficious friends of the martyr President chose to style themselves,\r\nnever alluded to his successor except as the man who had profited\r\nby the assassination.  Slander, calumny, and falsehood were resorted\r\nto by the press to deceive the people by giving them an untrue idea\r\nof their Chief Magistrate.  His private life was invaded, his social\r\nrelations were violated, his most patriotic actions were sneered\r\nat, and he was made the object of obloquy and vituperation by that\r\nfaction of the Republican party opposed to his policy.\r\n\r\nI well remember with what sadness and indignation he referred to\r\nthe manner in which he had been treated when I had been selected\r\nby him to write a campaign life of him, which was to have been\r\npublished by his friends had he been nominated for the Presidency\r\nin 1884.  There were several matters about which he had been\r\nmercilessly abused for which I found ample explanations exonerating\r\nhim.  One was his going to Albany in 1881, when he was Vice-President,\r\nto labor for the re-election of Messrs. Conkling and Platt.  I had\r\nascertained that he had done this in return for a visit made to\r\nOhio during the preceding campaign by Mr. Conkling to speak in\r\nfavor of the election of General Garfield.  This had been on the\r\npersonal solicitation of Mr. Arthur, and it would have been ungrateful\r\nfor him to have declined an appeal to aid Mr. Conkling in an hour\r\nof need by a visit to Albany.  When President Arthur read what I\r\nhad written on this subject he said pleasantly:  \"That is all true,\r\nbut I must ask you not to publish it.\"  Never have I seen a public\r\nman so determined not to criminate others, even in self-\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nDuring his Presidential term Mr. Arthur did what friends and fortune\r\ncan do for no man, and what neither friends nor foes could take\r\nfrom him.  \"He won a fame for which he himself fought, and from\r\nwhich no man's censure could detract.\"  While he was emphatically\r\n\"the first gentleman in the land,\" giving unequaled receptions,\r\ndinners, and evening entertainments with lavish hospitality, he\r\nwas, as he used to cheerily remark, \"a night-bird,\" and his favorite\r\nenjoyment was to have two or three personal friends eat a late\r\nsupper with him, and then chat with them far into the \"wee sma'\r\nhours.\"  His thorough knowledge of prominent men and politics during\r\nthe preceding quarter of a century enabled him to entertain his\r\nlisteners with graphic descriptions of remarkable scenes, piquant\r\nbut never indelicate anecdotes, keen sketches of men and women,\r\nand interesting statements about the workings of political machinery,\r\nespecially in the State of New York.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, President Arthur, before he left the White House,\r\nbecame impressed with the idea that the people had misunderstood\r\nhis official conduct, and that his sacrifices of friends and of\r\nfortune in the Administration of the General Government had not\r\nbeen appreciated.  When he was at last relieved from executive\r\ncares his robust constitution had been undermined, the ruddy look\r\nof health left his cheeks, and his stalwart form wasted away, until\r\n(as this work is passing through the press) his sad heart found\r\nits peace, and his remains were laid, without pomp, by the side of\r\nthose of his beloved wife in a rural cemetery near Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\nAn appreciative and elegant biographer of this lamented ex-President\r\nwrites thus:  \"_Flos Regum Arthur_ the Laureate heads the noble\r\ndedication of his Arthurian legends to the manes of Albert.  Not\r\n'flower of kings' shall history call this Arthur of ours, and yet\r\nmust she accord him some attributes of his mythic namesake--a high\r\nand noble courtesy to all men, small and great; an unflinching,\r\nuncomplaining loyalty to friends who turned too often ingrate; a\r\nsplendid presence, a kindly heart, a silent courage, and an even\r\nmind.  These things go no small way toward the making of America's\r\nfirst gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  W.W. Corcoran\r\nWILLIAM W. CORCORAN was born at Georgetown, D. C., December 27th,\r\n1798; he engaged in mercantile pursuits, and then in banking,\r\nbecoming the Government banker during the Mexican War.  Since he\r\nretried from business in 1854 he has founded and endowed the Louise\r\nHome for gentlewomen in reduced circumstances, the Corcoran Art\r\nGallery, and the Oak Hill Cemetery, on Georgetown Heights, while\r\nhe has contributed liberally to the Columbian College, the University\r\nof Virginia, the William and Mary College, and the churches and\r\norphan asylums of Washington, besides numerous private charities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nPRESIDENT CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of Grover Cleveland as the twenty-second President\r\nof the United States, on the 4th of March, 1885, restored the\r\nexecutive power of the Federal Government to the Democrats, after\r\nit had been enjoyed by the Republicans for twenty years.  The throng\r\nof visitors was great, the railroads leading into Washington having\r\nbrought nearly half a million of passengers during the week, while\r\nseveral thousand more came by the Potomac River steamboats.  The\r\nhotels and boarding-houses were full, yet there was always room\r\nfor late arrivals, and the military were quartered in the spacious\r\nhalls of the Departments.\r\n\r\nThe day was spring-like, with breeze enough to display the flags\r\nwhich floated from nearly every building.  Pennsylvania Avenue and\r\nother thoroughfares were elaborately decorated.  The procession\r\nwas the largest of its kind that ever passed along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, and the military escort was exceeded only by the great\r\nreviews of 1865.  General H. W. Slocum was Chief Marshal, efficiently\r\naided by General Albert Ordway, his chief of staff.  The United\r\nStates troops, commanded by Major-General Ayres, headed the escort.\r\nPresident Arthur and President-elect Cleveland rode with two Senators\r\nin an open carriage drawn by four bay horses, and next came Vice-\r\nPresident-elect Hendricks, with a Senator, in a carriage drawn by\r\nfour white horses.  As the carriages passed along the occupants\r\nwere loudly cheered, especially Vice-President Hendricks, who was\r\nwell known in Washington and personally popular.\r\n\r\nThe militia organizations which came next presented a fine appearance,\r\nparticularly a division of the National Guard of Pennsylvania,\r\ncommanded by Major-General John F. Hartranft.  The Southern troops\r\nwere commanded by Major-General Fitzhugh Lee, of Virginia, a nephew\r\nof the great Confederate war-leader, who received a rousing ovation\r\nthe whole length of the route.  Prominent among the military\r\norganizations were the New York Sixty-ninth, \"wearing the green;\"\r\nthe Grenadiers Rochambeau, of New York; the Jackson Corps, of\r\nAlbany; the Continentals, of Schenectady; the Fifth Maryland\r\nInfantry, the Meagher Guards, of Providence; the Busch Zouaves, of\r\nSt. Louis, and several companies of colored men from the South.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the procession, however, was the civic portion,\r\nwhich included organizations representing many States in the Union.\r\nEach one had its band, its banner, and its badges, while nearly\r\nall of them were uniformly dressed and carried canes.  The Society\r\nof Tammany, of New York, one thousand strong, marched in an inaugural\r\nprocession for the first time in its long history, its officers\r\ncarrying Indian tomahawks.  Nearly a hundred other political\r\norganizations followed; and in the ranks of one of them from the\r\ncity of New York there was a body of men wearing the old Knickerbocker\r\ncostume and carrying long canes, with which they beat time on the\r\npavements as they marched along in a grotesque manner, creating\r\nmuch merriment.\r\n\r\nA distinguished audience had gathered in the Senate Chamber,\r\nincluding the Supreme Court, the Diplomatic Corps, many prominent\r\nofficials, and those officers of the army and navy who had received\r\nthe thanks of Congress.  Shortly after twelve o'clock President\r\nArthur entered the Chamber, and was escorted to his seat.  The\r\ndeputy Sergeant-at-Arms then announced the \"President-elect of the\r\nUnited States,\" and the entire assemblage rose as Mr. Cleveland\r\npassed down the aisle and took a seat at the side of President\r\nArthur.  Vice-President-elect Hendricks then entered and advanced\r\nto the desk of the presiding officer, where Senator Edmunds,\r\nPresident _pro tempore_, administered to him the oath of office as\r\nVice-President of the United States.  Senator Edmunds then delivered\r\na brief valedictory address, at the conclusion of which he declared\r\nthe Senate adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nVice-President Hendricks took the chair, called the Senate to order,\r\ndelivered a short address, and administered the oath to the new\r\nSenators.  When the Senate had been thus organized, a procession\r\nwas formed by those in the Senate Chamber, which moved through the\r\nrotunda to the platform erected before the eastern portico.  On\r\nthe large plaza in front of the Capitol were gathered at least two\r\nhundred thousand people, while behind them as a framework were the\r\nmilitary and civic organizations, with waving banners, gay uniforms,\r\nand gleaming bayonets.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Cleveland came to the front of the platform, he was received\r\nwith tumultuous applause; after it had subsided, he delivered his\r\ninaugural address in such a clear voice that it was heard by nearly\r\nall of those before him.  When he had finished, he turned to Chief\r\nJustice Waite, bowed, and said  \"I am now prepared to take the oath\r\nprescribed by law.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice, holding in his left hand a small open Bible,\r\nwhich had been given to Mr. Cleveland by his mother when he had\r\nstarted to seek his fortune in the world, raised his right hand\r\nand recited the oath:  \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully\r\nexecute the office of President of the United States, and will, to\r\nthe best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\"  Mr. Cleveland, whose right hand had rested\r\non the Bible, responded:  \"I swear,\" and raising the book to his\r\nlips, kissed it.  His lips touched verses 5-10 inclusive, of the\r\n112th Psalm.\r\n\r\nThose on the platform congratulated the President; the assembled\r\nmultitude cheered; over a hundred bands played \"Hail to the Chief,\"\r\nand the cannon at the Navy Yard and the Arsenal thundered forth a\r\nPresidential salute.  The procession was then re-formed, and moved\r\nup Pennsylvania Avenue.  When the head of the column reached the\r\nTreasury Building, a brief halt was made, that President Cleveland\r\nmight go to the reviewing stand in front of the White House.  There\r\nhe witnessed the procession pass in review, which occupied three\r\nhours, and it was after five o'clock when he entered the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening there was a display of fireworks, which\r\nattracted much attention; then came the inauguration ball, held in\r\nthe interior court-yard of the unfinished Pension Building, which\r\nwas covered by a temporary roof.  The waxed dance-floor was three\r\nhundred and sixteen feet long and one hundred and sixteen feet\r\nwide, surrounded by reception-rooms, supper-rooms, and telegraph\r\noffices.  The decorations were very effective, and electric lamps\r\nsupplied a bright, clear light.  Nearly ten thousand people were\r\npresent and the receipts from the sale of tickets amounted to forty\r\nthousand dollars.  President Cleveland and Vice-President Hendricks\r\nwere present for an hour, and the ball was regarded as a fitting\r\nclose to the ceremonies of the day.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland's Cabinet gave general satisfaction to the Democrats\r\nat Washington.  The selection of Senator Bayard for Secretary of\r\nState was in deference to the national sentiment of the party that\r\nhad twice asserted itself in presenting him for the Presidency,\r\nand that had made him Mr. Cleveland's chief competitor at Chicago.\r\nSenator Bayard, when first summoned to Albany and invited to become\r\nthe Premier of the incoming Administration, had frankly told Mr.\r\nCleveland that he might consider himself absolved from all obligation\r\nto bestow his chief Cabinet honor upon him, and that he would prefer\r\nto remain in the Senate.  He finally consented, however, to accept\r\nthe portfolio of State, to the delight of the Diplomatic Corps,\r\nwho were acquainted with his accomplished wife and daughters, and\r\nwho looked forward to the enjoyment of their hospitality.  He took\r\nan early opportunity to publicly declare that he was heartily in\r\nfavor of civil service reform, and he followed the traditions of\r\nthe Department of State by retaining the experienced clerks.  Mr.\r\nBayard has no appreciation of humor or fondness for political\r\nintrigue, and department drudgery would be intolerable to him were\r\nit not for his passionate fondness for out-door exercise.  A bold\r\nhorseman, an untiring pedestrian, and enthusiastic angler, and a\r\ngood swimmer, he preserves his health, and gives close attention\r\nto the affairs of his Department.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel Manning, who was appointed Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nhad been graduated in boyhood from a printing office, that best of\r\ncolleges, and had gradually become a reporter, a sub-editor, and\r\nfinally the sole manager and principal owner of the Albany _Argus_.\r\nDevoting all his energies to his business, he was richly rewarded\r\npecuniarily, and under his direction the time-honored \"organ\" of\r\nthe Democracy of the Empire State challenged admiration by the\r\nboldness and the success of its editorial management.  His sagacity\r\nas a politician attracted the notice of Mr. Tilden, whose champion\r\nhe became, and subsequently his untiring efforts in the columns of\r\nhis paper and at the Chicago Convention did much to secure for Mr.\r\nCleveland the Presidential nomination.  His financial experience\r\nas President of a national bank was favorably regarded in Wall\r\nStreet, and his views coincided with those entertained by Mr.\r\nCleveland.  Old stagers have detected in him a striking personal\r\nresemblance to that sturdy New York Democrat of a former generation,\r\nWilliam L. Marcy, except that he wears a moustache, fiercely\r\nupturned.\r\n\r\nMr. William C. Endicott, a representative of the worth and intelligence\r\nof New England, was appointed Secretary of War.  A lawyer by\r\nprofession, he had been forced by ill health to resign his seat on\r\nthe State Supreme Bench, and his defeat as the Democratic nominee\r\nfor Governor of the Bay State gave him a claim on the party for\r\nits honors.  Prominent in cordially welcoming those who had renounced\r\ntheir party allegiance to vote for Mr. Cleveland, he was the pledged\r\nadvocate of civil service reform.  He is a very handsome man, with\r\nlong brown hair and moustache, slightly silvered by time.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy, Mr. William C. Whitney, is the son of\r\na famous old Massachusetts \"War Horse,\" who entered upon the practice\r\nof law at New York city.  He made his professional mark while he\r\nwas City Corporation Attorney in the prosecution of \"Boss Tweed,\"\r\nbut his large fortune is the result of successful railroad operations.\r\nHe is rather youthful in appearance for a man forty-five years of\r\nage, rather slenderly built, quick of movement, and with the air\r\nof courageous self-reliance that marks a successful and experienced\r\nbusiness operator.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucius Quintius Curtius Lamar, the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nhad taken broader views since the war on national questions than\r\nany other Southern leader.  The possessor of a well-balanced and\r\nhighly cultivated intellect, a thorough acquaintance with the\r\ntheories of Federalism and State Rights, and a varied civil and\r\nmilitary experience, Mr. Lamar may well be called a successful\r\nmolder of public opinion.  Some used to regard him as ideal rather\r\nthan practical, but the business-like manner in which he directed\r\nhis subordinates dispelled that mistaken idea.  His studious habits\r\nare shown by his rounded shoulders, and his grizzled long hair,\r\nbeard, and moustache impart a leonine character to his features.\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General William F. Vilas is a native of Vermont, who\r\nwent to Wisconsin when a lad, became a successful lawyer there,\r\nand served gallantly in the Union army during the war.  He is\r\nprobably better versed in the machinery of American politics than\r\nany other member of the Cabinet, and he is slowly but surely\r\nreplacing the Republican incumbents of fifty thousand offices with\r\nDemocrats.  He is a man of showy, brilliant manners, vigorous\r\neloquence, fascinating conversational powers, and an attractive\r\npersonal appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Augustus H. Garland, the Attorney-General of the new Administration,\r\ntook with him from the Senate a high legal and social reputation.\r\nHis Roman features are clean shaven, his jet black eyes sparkle\r\nwith intelligence, and his manners are polished, although he rarely\r\nmingles in society.\r\n\r\nNot of the Cabinet, but the President's confidential adviser, is\r\nColonel Daniel S. Lamont, who, like the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nreceived his political education in the office of the Albany _Argus_.\r\nColonel Lamont left his editorial chair to become the private\r\nsecretary of Mr. Cleveland when he became Governor of the State of\r\nNew York, and has since been his devoted adherent.  Slender, with\r\nintellectual features and a dark red moustache, which lights up\r\nhis pale face, Colonel Lamont has the mouth of a man who is silent\r\nand the ears of a man who listens, while the quick glances of his\r\neyes take in what there is to be seen.  The possessor of great\r\npersonal urbanity, always clear-headed, and very reticent, especially\r\nconcerning the President, he is emphatically \"the right man in the\r\nright place.\"  He keeps up his Albany habit of calling Mr. Cleveland\r\n\"Governor,\" while the President familiarly calls him \"Dan.\"  There\r\nis no \"Kitchen Cabinet\" to act as office-brokers and to secure the\r\nExecutive approval of measures \"for a consideration.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet meeting held at the Executive Mansion, the President\r\nsits at the head of the Council table, and the members occupy\r\npositions as indicated in the accompanying diagram.  The Cabinet\r\nhas no legal existence.  Any other official or any individual not\r\nholding official position can be called upon by the President to\r\nmeet with him as a member of his Cabinet, and to consult him on\r\nthe days in the week designated by him for that purpose.  In some\r\nAdministrations--notably those of Presidents Taylor and Pierce--\r\nthe members of the Cabinet assumed a power equal to that of the\r\nVenetian oligarchy.  But Mr. Cleveland has not chosen to act the\r\npart of King Log, and right autocratically has he exercised his\r\nprerogative.\r\n\r\nThis habit of personally assuming responsibility has ever characterized\r\nMr. Cleveland.  When Mayor of Buffalo and when Governor of New\r\nYork, he was open to suggestions from those whose judgment he\r\nvalued, but he was always ready to carry his own full share of\r\nresponsibility, as he now does in his relations with his chosen\r\nadvisers of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Fascimile]\r\n  Grover Cleveland\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND was born at Caldwell, Essex County, New Jersey,\r\nMarch 18th, 1837; studied law at Buffalo and commenced practice\r\nthere; was Mayor of Buffalo, 1882, 1883; was Governor of the State\r\nof New York, 1883-1885; was elected President of the United States\r\non the Democratic ticket, November 4th, 1884, and was inaugurated\r\non the 4th of March, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nOFFICIAL AND SOCIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland is emphatically a working man.  Possessing a\r\nstrong physique, he industriously devotes his time and his energies\r\nto the duties of his office.  Gentle in his strength, unobtrusive\r\nin his modesty, and unswerved by partisan clamor, he endeavors to\r\ndo what he--from his personal and political standpoint--regards as\r\nright.  He is above medium height, quite stout, and rather sluggish\r\nin his movement.  He is of the Teutonic type--blonde, with ruddy\r\ncolor.  His head is large, with a broad forehead, deeply set blue\r\neyes, a large, straight nose, with vigorous nostrils, and a firm\r\nmouth, partly shaded by a drooping light mustache.  He generally\r\nwears a frock coat, buttoned up so high that only an inch or so of\r\nhis shirt bosom is visible, with a slight black cravat encircling\r\na standing collar.  In conversing with strangers, he generally\r\nstands with his hands clasped behind him, and when he thinks that\r\nhe has heard enough from the person addressing him he brings his\r\nhands forward.\r\n\r\nThe President rises early, shaves himself, dresses without assistance,\r\nand then reads the newspapers until breakfast time.  From the\r\nbreakfast-table he goes to the library, an oval-shaped room in the\r\nsecond story of the White House, with large windows at one end\r\ncommanding a fine southern view, with Alexandria and Arlington in\r\nthe background.  The room is partially lined with book-cases, and\r\nthe furniture is upholstered with red leather, while in the centre\r\nof the room, near the windows, is the President's desk.  It was\r\npresented by Queen Victoria, and was made from the oaken timbers\r\nof the Resolute, which was sent to the Arctic regions by the British\r\nGovernment in search of Sir John Franklin, abandoned in the ice,\r\nsaved by American whalers, and restored to the British Government\r\nby the United States.  On this desk the many papers before the\r\nPresident are methodically arranged, and he never has to waste time\r\nin hunting for mislaid letters.\r\n\r\nThe morning mail first passes through the hands of Colonel Lamont,\r\nwho lays before the President such letters as require instructions\r\nas to the replies to be made.  Mr. Cleveland answers many of his\r\nprivate letters himself, writing with great rapidity and not always\r\nvery legibly.  At ten o'clock visitors begin to arrive, Senators\r\nand Representatives claiming precedence over all others.  A few of\r\nthe Congressmen escort constituents who merely desire to pay their\r\nrespects, but the greater portion of them--Republicans as well as\r\nDemocrats--have some \"axe to grind,\" some favor to ask, or some\r\nappointment to urge.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock the President goes down-stairs to lunch, and on his\r\nway to the private dining-room passes through the East Room to see\r\nthe sovereign people congregated there.  There are queer mosaics\r\nof humanity at these daily impromptu receptions, generally including\r\na few persistent place-hunters, who are invariably referred to the\r\nheads of Departments; several bridal couples in new clothes; an\r\nold Bourbon in a shiny black dress-coat, who \"has voted for every\r\nDemocratic President, sir, since the days of Jackson;\" half a dozen\r\ncommercial drummers--travelers, I mean--with their pockets full of\r\nsamples, and three or four fond mothers, whose children invariably\r\nforget to speak the complimentary little piece taught them.  The\r\nPresident wastes no time, but goes along the line like an old-\r\nfashioned beau dancing the grand right and left figure in a cotillion,\r\nand then goes to his luncheon.\r\n\r\nTwo days in the week, when there is a Cabinet meeting, the reception\r\nin the East Room is held at noon, or omitted.  After luncheon, the\r\nPresident returns to his desk and works there steadily until five\r\no'clock, unless some one calls who cannot be refused an audience.\r\nNone of his predecessors have ever weighed the qualifications and\r\nclaims of candidates for Federal appointment with such painstaking\r\ncare as has Mr. Cleveland.  He has carefully read the recommendations\r\nin every case, and, after such investigation as it has been possible\r\nfor him to make into the character and antecedents of the rival\r\napplicants, he has made his appointments.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock the President takes a drive, although the carriage\r\nis often sent back to the stable that the examination of the papers\r\nin some case may be finished that day.  Dinner is served at seven,\r\nand by half-past eight the President is at work again, often\r\nremaining at his desk until midnight.  But then he leaves his cares\r\nbehind him.  When asked if he ever carried the work to bed with\r\nhim, as many men of a nervous organization would do, he replied:\r\n\"No!  I generally fall asleep without any difficulty.  I generally\r\nam asleep as soon as I am fairly in bed, and never wake until\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rose Elizabeth Cleveland, one of the President's sisters,\r\npresided over the domestic arrangements of the White House after\r\nthe inauguration of Mr. Cleveland.  She is a lady of literary\r\ntastes, and under her direction the routine of receptions and\r\ndinners was carefully continued.  On these occasions the floral\r\ndecorations were remarkably elegant, and there was a profusion of\r\npalms, India rubber plants, roses, azalias, tulips, hyacinths, and\r\ngrowing orchids.\r\n\r\nThe first state dinner was given in honor of the Cabinet.  At each\r\nend of the long table were ornaments of white wax.  At the eastern\r\nend the figures upholding three fancy molds of jellied _pate de\r\nfoie gras_ were white swans, with outspread wings, under the shelter\r\nof which rested a brood of snowy young ones.  At the opposite end\r\nof the table the figures were those of eagles, while the _pates de\r\nfoie gras_ arranged above on horseshoes were little square blocks,\r\nattached to the horseshoes by means of silver skewers, with ornamental\r\nhilts.  Interspersed the length of the board were glass and silver\r\nstands of conserves, bonbons, and salted almonds.  The service used\r\nat the first course was that especially decorated for the White\r\nHouse during the Hayes Administration.  At each plate were set six\r\nBohemian wine-glasses, a cut-glass carafe, tumbler, and champagne\r\nglass.  Salt-sellers of cut-glass, with golden shovels, and silver\r\npepper-stands were beside these.  On each plate was folded a large\r\ndamask napkin, on the top of which rested a bouquet of roses and\r\nferns, tied with a broad white satin ribbon, on one end of which,\r\nrunning bias, were painted the colors of the Union.  On the other\r\nend was an etching in black and white of the White House and\r\nsurrounding shrubbery, while underneath, in gilt lettering, was\r\n\"Jan. 14, 1886.\"  Gilt bullet-headed pins, to attach the bouquet\r\nto the corsage, lay beside these, while above lay a large white\r\ncard bearing the name of the guest assigned to the seat.  Above\r\nthe name of the guests, blazoned in gold, was the American eagle,\r\nabove whose head, through a cluster of stars, was the motto, \"E\r\nPluribus Unum.\"  At the plates laid for the gentlemen were\r\n_boutonnieres_ of green, with a single Bon Silene rosebud.  Miss\r\nCleveland had a corsage bouquet of pink roses; Miss Bayard, who\r\noccupied the seat to the right of the President, Perie du Jardin\r\nroses, and Mrs. Manning, who sat to the left, lilies of the valley\r\nand ferns.\r\n\r\nThe guests assembled in the East Room, and when dinner was announced\r\nas served, passed down the corridor, the Marine Band performing\r\nselections from the \"Mikado,\" and entered the state dining-room in\r\nthe following order:  President Cleveland and Miss Bayard, who wore\r\na trained dress of pink silk, the front of which was white lace;\r\nSecretary Whitney and Mrs. Vilas, who wore a blue silk dress;\r\nSenator Edmunds and Mrs. McCullough, who wore cream satin and lace;\r\nSenator Harris and Mrs. Edward Cooper, who wore white satin, with\r\nside panels embroidered in gold and silver; General Sheridan and\r\nMrs. Endicott, who wore a court train of black velvet over a pink\r\nsatin petticoat, with point lace flounces; Secretary Bayard and\r\nMrs. Whitney, who wore white cut velvet, trimmed with clusters of\r\nostrich tips.  Postmaster-General Vilas and Mrs. Sheridan, who wore\r\nsky-blue silk, with front brocaded in roses; Mr. Speaker Carlisle\r\nand Mrs. Edmunds, who wore black velvet; Mr. McCullough and Miss\r\nWeddell, who wore white brocaded satin; Secretary Lamar and Mrs.\r\nCarlisle, who wore gold-flowered brocade, with front of network of\r\niridescent beading; Admiral Rogers and Mrs. D. Willis James, who\r\nwore cardinal velvet with court train, over a white satin and lace\r\npetticoat; Hon. Edward Cooper, of New York, and Miss Love, who wore\r\nwhite satin, with black velvet train; Mrs. D. Willis James, of New\r\nYork, and Mrs. Utley, who wore white satin brocade; Secretary\r\nManning and Miss Cleveland, who wore a gown of white satin, with\r\ncourt train of white plush.\r\n\r\nMiss Cleveland had her afternoon receptions, and she also gave\r\nseveral luncheon parties to ladies, at which her temperance principles\r\nwere exemplified.  At the first of these luncheon parties Miss\r\nCleveland graciously received her guests in a morning dress of pink\r\nsurah silk, with a high-necked bodice and panels of ruby velvet,\r\ntrimmed with white lace, and Miss Van Vechten, an inmate of the\r\nWhite House, wore a walking-dress of dark blue velvet, with a vest\r\nof light blue silk, trimmed with blue steel beads.  Nearly all of\r\nthe ladies wore walking-dresses and bonnets, although a few were\r\nin the evening attire that they would have worn to a dinner-party.\r\nMrs. Warner Miller wore a bronze-green Ottoman silk with panels of\r\ncardinal plush; Mrs. Potter (the amateur actress) wore a bright\r\ngreen Ottoman silk short dress, with a tight-fitting jacket of\r\nscarlet cloth, richly embroidered; Mrs. John A. Logan wore a dress\r\nof peacock-blue satin, trimmed with blue brocade; Mrs. Marshal\r\nRoberts wore a brown velvet dress, and Mrs. Van Rensselaer a black\r\nsatin dress trimmed with jet.  The repast was an abbreviated dinner,\r\ndaintily served, but in the place of seven kinds of wine there were\r\nserved iced Potomac water, Apollinaris water and lemonade.\r\n\r\nMiss Cleveland talks very much as she writes, and those who have\r\nenjoyed her _Summer Hours_ can imagine the bright staccato strain\r\nof her conversation.  She seemed when in the White House to be\r\nalways longing for what she used to call her \"little old house on\r\nthe Holland Patent, with the village on the one side and the hills\r\non the other.\"  She remarked one day to a lady visitor:  \"I wish\r\nthat I could observe Washington life in its political phase; but\r\nI suppose I am too near the centre to get an accurate perspective\r\non that.  Those who live on Mount Athos do not see Mount Athos.\"\r\n\r\nSociety was saddened early in the fashionable season of 1886 by\r\nthe sudden death of Secretary Bayard's eldest daughter, a young\r\nlady whose personal attractions, gifted intellect, and quick wit\r\nendeared her to a large circle of devoted friends.  A fortnight\r\nlater, the bereaved father was deprived by death of his wife, a\r\nlady of gracious presence and refined disposition, who was the\r\nmother of twelve children, eight of whom survived her.  These sad\r\nevents closed the pleasant home of the _Premier_ on Highland Terrace,\r\ngreatly to the regret of the diplomats and others, who loved to\r\ncongregate there.\r\n\r\nProminent among the wives of the members of the Cabinet was Mrs.\r\nWhitney, the only daughter of Senator Harry B. Payne, of Ohio,\r\nwhose unstinted expenditures have made her house in Washington,\r\nlike her other residences, noted for their hospitality.  The\r\nresidence of Secretary Manning, with its drawing-room fitted up in\r\nthe Louis XVI. style, is palatial, while those who visit the home\r\nof the Secretary of War admire the quiet style of its furniture\r\nand the rare old family silver on its table.\r\n\r\nThe death of Vice-President Hendricks removed an official around\r\nwhom the disaffected Democrats could have crystallized into a\r\nformidable opposition.  Believing as he did, that he had been\r\ndefrauded of the office of Vice-President by the Electoral Commission\r\nin 1876, he regarded his election in 1884 as a triumphant vindication\r\nof his rights, and he was not disposed to have the position longer\r\nregarded as \"like the fifth wheel of a coach.\"  He made no secret\r\nof his opposition to civil service reform and to his Indiana rival,\r\nex-Senator McDonald, against whose appointment to a place in the\r\nCabinet he formally protested.  Perhaps a social antagonism between\r\nMrs. McDonald and Mrs. Hendricks had something to do with this.\r\n\r\nVice-President Hendricks was slightly lame, from a singular cause.\r\nHe spoke in public a great deal in the Presidential campaign of\r\n1882, and while speaking he was in the habit of bending forward on\r\nthe tip of his right foot, resting his entire weight upon it.  From\r\nthe pressure of his right shoe a swelling arose on one of his toes,\r\nshortly after he reached home after making a speech at Newcastle,\r\nIndiana.  In twenty-four hours erysipelas developed, and it was\r\nonly after an illness of six months that he recovered.  But he\r\nalways afterward was somewhat lame, especially when he was fatigued.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  T. A. Hendricks\r\nTHOMAS ANDREWS HENDRICKS was born in Muskingum County, Ohio,\r\nSeptember 7th, 1849; was taken when three years of age to Indiana,\r\nwhere he studied law and practiced; was a Representative in Congress\r\nfrom Indiana, 1851-1855; was Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice, 1855-1859; was United States Senator from Indiana, 1863-\r\n1869; was Governor of Indiana, 1872-1877; was nominated for Vice-\r\nPresident on the Democratic ticket at St. Louis in 1876, and was\r\ndefeated; was again nominated for Vice-President on the Democratic\r\nticket at Chicago in 1884, and was elected; was inaugurated March\r\n4th, 1885, and died at Indianapolis, November 25th, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nTHE FORTY-NINTH CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Forty-ninth Congress was commenced on the\r\n7th of December, 1885.  The Republicans had a majority in the\r\nSenate, but it was understood that they would not oppose the\r\nAdministration in a factious way, but would insist upon having the\r\nreasons for the removals of Republican officials and the appointment\r\nof Democrats in their places.  The President, on the other hand,\r\nintimated that he should assert all his prerogatives.  A number of\r\nthe Democratic Senators were not happy, and asked each other whether\r\nthey had dragged their weary way out of the wilderness to the top\r\nof a civil service Mount Pisgah only to gaze upon the promised\r\nland, there to see the pleasant pastures and shady groves of official\r\nlife, without being permitted to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nJohn Sherman was elected President _pro tempore_ of the Senate.\r\nAlthough he had twice lost the Republican nomination for the\r\nPresidency by the treachery of Ohio politicians, he had not \"sulked\r\nin his tent,\" but had done all in his power to carry that State\r\nfor Garfield and then for Blaine.  It was understood that Senator\r\nEdmunds had resigned in his favor all claims to the Presidency of\r\nthe Senate, and he was elected by the full party vote, thirty-four\r\nagainst twenty-nine.  He stated in his brief inaugural speech that\r\nhe should endeavor to enforce the rules with impartiality,\r\nascertaining, if possible, the sense of the majority, and giving\r\nto the minority its full constitutional rights and protection.\r\n\r\nThere was a prolonged and acrimonious debate in the Senate, called\r\nthe third battle of Bull Run, as it related to the conduct of Fitz\r\nJohn Porter in the second battle.  One day Senator Plumb, of Kansas,\r\ndeclared that the attempt to reinstate Porter was the beginning of\r\nan attempt to re-write the history of the Union army, and to put\r\nthat which was disloyal and unfaithful above that which was loyal\r\nand faithful.  \"This,\" said Mr. Plumb, \"was our quarrel, if quarrel\r\nit was, and the other side ought to refrain from voting on it.\"\r\n\r\nThis roused Senator Butler, of South Carolina, who had served as\r\na Brigadier-General in the Confederate army, and he, in sharp tones,\r\nprotested against what Mr. Plumb had said, denouncing it as\r\n\"absolutely and entirely and unqualifiedly untrue.  And, sir,\" he\r\nwent on to say, \"if it were in another form I would pronounce it\r\nas false and cowardly.\"  He concluded by declaring that he did not\r\nbelieve Fitz John Porter was a traitor.  He did not believe that\r\nhe deserted his colors, and believing that, he should vote to\r\nreinstate him.  \"Ah!\" quietly remarked Mr. Plumb, \"I knew all that\r\nbefore the Senator arose.\"  \"Then,\" retorted Mr. Butler, \"I hope\r\nthe Senator will stop his insinuations.\"  To this Mr. Plumb replied,\r\n\"As the Senator has not restrained himself from making a somewhat\r\nlively speech here, I hope he will not feel under any restraint\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Butler was by that time thoroughly enraged, and, advancing\r\ntoward the Senator from Kansas, he exclaimed:  \"I can say this to\r\nthe Senator, that if he were to indulge in just such sentiments\r\nand expressions elsewhere as he has, he would be very likely to\r\nhear from me.\"  \"Oh! Mr. President,\" cooly remarked Mr. Plumb, \"we\r\nhear a great many things in these days.  There are signs and\r\nportents, and all that sort of thing.  It is just what the Senator\r\nhas said that I was commenting upon; that, while the men who served\r\nin the Union army and the Northern people were divided to some\r\nextent on this question affecting the honor, the good name, the\r\nfaithfulness, and the loyalty of one of their own soldiers, no\r\nConfederate soldier had any doubt upon the subject, but voted _nem.\r\ncon._ that he was not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later, Mr. Plumb said he has just been informed that\r\nthe President had vetoed a bill giving a pension of fifty dollars\r\na month to the widow of Major-General Hunter, who had been presiding\r\nofficer of the court-martial that had tried Fitz John Porter.  That\r\nseemed a fitting accompaniment for the passage of the Fitz John\r\nPorter Bill.  But the loyal people of the country would see to it\r\nthat Mrs. Hunter did not suffer.  The debate then lagged, and in\r\na few minutes the vote was reached and the bill was passed.\r\n\r\nThe champion of President Cleveland in the Senate was Arthur P.\r\nGorman, of Maryland, the son of a respectable citizen of Washington\r\nand the grandson of an Irishman.  Educated at the public schools\r\nin Howard County, Maryland, he was appointed, when thirteen years\r\nof age, a page in the Senate of the United States.  Prompt, truthful,\r\nand attentive to whatever was entrusted to him, he was gradually\r\npromoted until he became the Senate Postmaster.  Among his warmest\r\nfriends was Andrew Johnson, and when he was removed from office\r\nbecause he always spoke well of the President, Mr. Johnson appointed\r\nhim Collector of Internal Revenue for the Fifth District of Maryland,\r\nwhich place he held until the Grant Administration came into power.\r\nEntering into Maryland politics, and thoroughly acquainted with\r\nparliamentary law, he was elected Speaker of the House of Delegates,\r\nand afterward State Senator.  When forty years of age he was elected\r\nUnited States Senator, defeating William Pinckney Whyte, who was\r\nthe representative of the aristocratic element in Maryland.  This\r\nelement at once commenced a merciless warfare against Mr. Gorman,\r\nbut he was in no wise daunted, and he has been re-elected by a\r\nlarge majority.  He is rather an under-sized, squarely built man,\r\nwith jet-black hair, a Roman nose, a clean-shaven face, very dark\r\nblue eyes, and a decisive manner.  He is noted for his fidelity to\r\nhis friends, and at the same time he often forgives those who have\r\nshamefully treated him, but who come to ask favors of him.  He did\r\nmuch toward securing the election of Mr. Cleveland as President,\r\nand he has had the satisfaction of seeing that what he did has been\r\nfully appreciated at the White House.\r\n\r\nSenator Kenna, of West Virginia, another stanch defender of President\r\nCleveland, was the youngest Senator when he took his seat, but he\r\nhad served three terms in the House of Representatives and was\r\nchosen for a fourth term when he was elected to the seat formerly\r\noccupied by Henry G. Davis.  He is a tall, thick-set man, with a\r\nfull, clean-shaven face, blue eyes, chestnut hair, rather inclined\r\nto curl.  He is negligent in his dress and rather slow in the\r\nutterance of his sentences, as he speaks extemporaneously, what he\r\nsays, however, is always to the point at issue.\r\n\r\nGeneral Charles F. Manderson is one of the ablest among the younger\r\nSenators on the Republican side of the Chamber.  A native of\r\nPennsylvania, he commenced the practice of law in Ohio, but went\r\ninto the Union army, where he fought gallantly, receiving severe\r\nwounds.  After peace was declared he migrated to the young State\r\nof Nebraska, whose interests he carefully looks after while he\r\nparticipates in general legislation, especially military affairs\r\nand printing.  He is of medium height, compactly built, with bright\r\neyes and a well-modulated voice.\r\n\r\nSenator Spooner, of Wisconsin, is the young orator of the Senate.\r\nSlender in form, and not of commanding presence, he has a well-\r\nmodulated voice, and his words are always well chosen.  Whatever\r\nhe says is characterized by depth of reflection and purity of style,\r\nand he is fearlessly independent in the expression of his ideas.\r\n\r\nGeneral McCook, the Secretary of the Senate, taking a wife, it\r\nbecame necessary, in accordance with the traditions of that body,\r\nto make him a wedding present.  The Quaker Senator, Jonathan Chace,\r\nof Rhode Island, was one of a committee appointed to collect the\r\ncontributions for a gift to General McCook, and he began to solicit\r\ndonations while the Senate was in session, which made it necessary\r\nfor him to speak low, and, perhaps, somewhat indistinctly.  No\r\nsooner had be interviewed Mr. Dolph, of Oregon, than that Senator,\r\nleaving his seat, went out into the cloak-room, where sat several\r\nof the upper house, enjoying their cigars and a chat.  \"Well,\" said\r\nMr. Dolph, as he joined them, \"I have been called upon, since I\r\nhave been in public life, to contribute to all sorts of enterprises\r\nand for all sorts of purposes, but I just had a request that beats\r\nany demand I have ever had made upon my pocket-book.\"  \"What was\r\nit?\" asked the Senators, in a body.  \"Why,\" replied Mr. Dolph,\r\n\"Friend Chace just came to me, and in a mysterious way said that\r\nhis cook was about to be married, and that he wanted to have me\r\nsubscribe to a testimonial to her.  What in--\" but here his auditors\r\nbroke out in roars of laughter, in which Mr. Dolph joined when he\r\nsaw his mistake.  It was not the cook of Friend Chace who was to\r\nreceive a wedding testimonial, but handsome Aaron McCook, the\r\nSecretary of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, in which the Democrats had a good\r\nworking majority, re-elected Mr. Speaker Carlisle, with nearly all\r\nof the old officers.  The only real contest was over the Chaplainship.\r\nMr. Morrison, of Illinois, presented as his candidate the Rev. W.\r\nH. Milburn, known as the blind preacher, who received ninety votes\r\nagainst eighty-two for all the other candidates, and was elected.\r\n\r\nJohn Griffin Carlisle, Speaker of the House, is a thorough\r\nparliamentarian, who rises above party lines in his rulings and is\r\nthe model of courtesy in the chair.  The clearness and the fairness\r\nwith which he states a question to the House has never been equaled,\r\nand his ready recollection of precedents is wonderfully accurate.\r\nHe is the fourth Kentuckian who has wielded the Speaker's gavel,\r\nHenry Clay having been elected again and again, while Linn Boyd,\r\na veteran Representative, occupied the Speaker's chair for four\r\nyears.  John White, of Kentucky, was also Speaker for one term,\r\nbut when it was ascertained that an eloquent address delivered by\r\nhim at the close of a session had been pirated from one delivered\r\nby Aaron Burr on vacating the chair of the Senate, he was mercilessly\r\nridiculed and committed suicide.\r\n\r\nAnother able Kentuckian in the House is William C. P. Breckinridge,\r\nof Lexington, who has inherited the brilliant oratorical powers of\r\nhis father, the Rev. Dr. Robert C. Breckinridge, and of his uncle,\r\nVice-President John C. Breckinridge.  He is a model of venerable,\r\nmanly beauty, his snow-white hair and beard bringing out in strong\r\nrelief his ruddy complexion, while his large blue eyes gleam with\r\nforensic fire.\r\n\r\nIn the \"gift enterprise\" of seats, a New York Representative, Mr.\r\nStahlnecker, drew the first prize and selected a seat in the third\r\nrow from the front.  Mr. Hiscock, who is always observed by all\r\nobservers, had, with Mr. Hewitt, to content themselves with seats\r\nin the outside row.  The seat of the patriarchal Judge Kelley was\r\nprotected by his hat, and no one appropriated it until his name\r\nwas called, when he again resumed his old place.  General Robert\r\nSmalls, the coal-black Representative from South Carolina, was the\r\nobject of much interest as he stepped forward to select his seat,\r\nand all necks were craned to get a view of New York's Republican\r\nstandard-bearer when a scholarly, refined-looking gentleman responded\r\nto the name of Ira Davenport.  Of course, all strangers wanted to\r\nsee the indefatigable Randall, the economical Holman, the free-\r\ntrader Morrison, the Greenback Weaver and the argentive Bland, the\r\neloquent McKinley, the sarcastic Reed, the sluggish Hiscock, and\r\nthe caustic-tongued Butterworth.  Old stagers who remembered the\r\nshrunken, diminutive form of Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia,\r\ncould but smile when they saw his successor, Major Barnes, who\r\nweighs at least three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe lobby is a quiet but efficient part of Congressional machinery.\r\nScores of bills are considered and passed during every session,\r\neach involving thousands of dollars, and those having them in charge\r\ndo not feel like turning a deaf ear to any one who can promise\r\nsupport.  An occasional investigation reveals the work of ex-\r\nCongressmen, who hover about the Capitol like birds of prey, and\r\nof correspondents so scantily paid by the journals with which they\r\nare connected that they are forced to prostitute their pens.  But\r\nthe most adroit lobbyists belong to the gentler sex.  Some of them\r\nare the widows of officers of the army or navy, other the daughters\r\nof Congressmen of a past generation, and others have drifted from\r\nhome localities, where they have found themselves the subjects of\r\nscandalous comments.  They are retained with instructions to exert\r\ntheir influence with designated Congressmen.  Sometimes the\r\nCongressmen are induced to vote aye on a certain measure; sometimes\r\nto vote no, and it often occurs that where the lobbyist cannot make\r\nan impression on them, one way or the other, they will endeavor to\r\nkeep them away from the House when the roll is called.\r\n\r\nTo enable them to do their work well, they have pleasant parlors,\r\nwith works of art and bric-a-brac donated by admirers.  Every\r\nevening they receive, and in the winter their blazing wood fires\r\nare often surrounded by a distinguished circle.  Some treat favored\r\nguests to a game of euchre, and as midnight approaches there is\r\nalways an adjournment to the dining-room, where a choice supper is\r\nserved.  A cold game pie, broiled oysters, charmingly mixed salad,\r\nand one or two light dishes generally constitute the repast, with\r\niced champagne or Burgundy at blood heat.  Who can blame the\r\nCongressman for leaving the bad cooking of his hotel or boarding-\r\nhouse, with the absence of all home comforts, to walk into the\r\nparlor web which the cunning spider-lobbyist weaves for him?\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  Fredk T. Frelinghuysen\r\nFREDERICK T. FRELINGHUYSEN was born at Millstown, New Jersey, August\r\n4th, 1817; graduated at Rutgers College in 1836; was Attorney-\r\nGeneral of the State of New Jersey, 1861-1866; was United States\r\nSenator, 1866-1869, and again 1871-1877; was Secretary of State\r\nunder President Arthur, December 12th, 1881 - March 4th, 1885; died\r\nat Newark, N. J., May 20th, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S WEDDING.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland was married at the White House at seven o'clock\r\non the 2d of June, 1886, to Miss Frances Folsom, the daughter of\r\nhis former law partner.  Since the historic mansion had been occupied\r\nthere had been eight marriages within its walls, but for the first\r\ntime a President of the United States was the bridegroom.  The day\r\nhad been unpleasant, but in the afternoon it cleared off, and the\r\nsunbeams flittered through the foliage of the trees.  Only a few\r\nrelatives of the bride and high officials were invited, but a large\r\ncrowd assembled around the door of the White House, where they\r\ncould only hear the music of the Marine Band when the ceremony was\r\ncommenced.  At the same time a Presidential salute was fired from\r\nthe Arsenal, and the church-bells chimed merry peals.\r\n\r\nThe state apartments at the White House were profusely decked with\r\nflowers, nodding palms, and tropical grasses.  The crystal chandeliers\r\npoured a flood of light upon the scene, and the warm and glowing\r\ncolors of the masses of scarlet begonias and jacqueminot roses\r\nmingled with the bright tints of the frescoed walls and ceilings.\r\nThe open fire-places were filled with colias and small pink flowers,\r\nwhile on the mantels were large plaques of pansies bearing appropriate\r\nmottoes.\r\n\r\nPrecisely at seven o'clock the Marine Band struck up Mendelssohn's\r\nWedding-March, and the President came slowly down the staircase\r\nwith his bride leaning on his arm.  They were unaccompanied--even\r\nthe bride's mother awaited her coming.  The bride wore a train four\r\nyards in length.  Attached to the lower side of the train on the\r\nleft was a scarf of soft, white India silk, looped high, and forming\r\nan overskirt, which was bordered on the edge with orange-blossoms.\r\nAcross the bodice were full folds of muslin, edged with orange-\r\nblossoms.  Long gloves were worn to meet the short sleeves.  The\r\nbridal veil was of white silk tulle, five yards in length, fastened\r\non the head with orange-blossoms, and falling to the end of the\r\nbeautiful train, which, as the bride stood with bowed head beside\r\nthe President, lay far behind her on the floor.  Her only jewelry\r\nas a superb diamond necklace, the President's wedding present, and\r\nan engagement-ring containing a sapphire and two diamonds.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland wore an evening dress of black, with a small\r\nturned-down collar, and a white lawn necktie; a white rose was\r\nfastened to the lapel of his coat.  The bridal couple turned to\r\nthe right as they entered the Blue Parlor from the long hall, and\r\nfaced the officiating clergyman, Rev. Dr. Sunderland, who immediately\r\ncommenced the ceremony in accordance with the usages of the\r\nPresbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the couple had pledged their troth the President placed a\r\nwedding-ring upon the bride's finger, and Dr. Sunderland then\r\npronounced them man and wife, with the injunction:  \"Whom God hath\r\njoined together let no man put asunder.\"  The Rev. Mr. Cleveland,\r\na brother of the bridegroom, then stepped forward and concluded\r\nthe ceremony with an invocation of blessing upon the pair.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony the bride's mother, Mrs. Folsom,\r\nwas the first to tender her congratulations.  She was followed by\r\nMiss Cleveland and the other relatives and friends in turn.  Then\r\nthe band struck up the march from Lohengrin, and the President and\r\nhis wife led the way through the East Room to the family dining-\r\nroom, where the wedding supper was served.  The decorations were\r\nof an elaborate character.  A mirror in the centre of the table\r\nrepresented a lake, on which was a full-rigged ship, made of pinks,\r\nroses, and pansies.  The national colors floated over the mainmast,\r\nand small white flags, with the monogram \"C. F.\" in golden letters,\r\nhung from the other masts.  The guests were not seated, but stood\r\nup and enjoyed the croquets, game, salads, ices, and creams.  The\r\nhealth of the bride and bridegroom was pledged in iced champagne.\r\nEach guest received a box of cardboard, containing a white satin\r\nbox filled with wedding cake five inches long by two broad and two\r\ndeep.  On the cover the date was hand-painted in colors, and a card\r\naffixed bore the autograph signature of Grover Cleveland and Frances\r\nFolsom, which they had written the previous afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter-past eight the President and his wife left the supper-\r\nroom and soon reappeared in traveling dress.  He wore his usual\r\nblack frock business suit, and she a traveling dress of deep gray\r\nsilk, with a large gray hat lined with velvet and crowned with\r\nostrich feathers.  They left the back door of the White House amid\r\na shower of rice and old slippers, and were driven to the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio Railroad, where they took a special train for Deer Park.\r\n\r\n[Facsimile]\r\n  B. Sunderland\r\nBYRON SUNDERLAND was born at Shoreham, Vermont, November 22d, 1819;\r\nwas graduated from Middlebury College in the class of '38; taught\r\nschool for two years at Port Henry, New York; was a student at the\r\nUnion Theological Seminary for two years and a half; was licensed\r\nto preach and was ordained in 1848 pastor of the Presbyterian church\r\nat Batavia, New York, where he remained for eight years; received\r\na call to the Park Church at Syracuse, and was its pastor until\r\nthe close of 1852; became pastor of the First Presbyterian Church\r\nat Washington in 1853, and has occupied its pulpit since, except\r\nfrom August, '64, to January, '86, when he was temporarily absent\r\nin charge of the American Chapel at Paris, France.  From 1861 to\r\n1864 he was Chaplain of the United States Senate, and resigned on\r\naccount of failing health.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nA SUMMING-UP OF SIXTY YEARS.\r\n\r\nThe progress of Washington City during the past sixty years--1827-\r\n1887--has been phenomenal.  The United States of America, then\r\ntwenty-four in number, now number thirty-eight, bound together by\r\niron bands, then unknown, while the telegraph and the telephone\r\nadd their usefulness to that of the railroads.  Domestic rebellion\r\nshowed itself, to be overthrown only after a struggle in which the\r\ncourage and endurance of the North and the South were equally\r\ndemonstrated.  The teeming population of Europe has overflowed into\r\nevery section of the Republic where wealth is to be won by enterprise\r\nand industry.  The fertile prairies of the far West not only supply\r\nthe inhabitants of the Eastern States with food, but they export\r\nlarge quantities of meat and of grain.  The workshops and factories\r\nresound with the whir of wheels and the hum of well-paid labor,\r\nwhich, in turn, furnishes a market for agricultural and horticultural\r\nproducts.  There has been of late a fomentation of ill-feeling and\r\njealously between classes dependent upon each other, and both\r\nequally valuable to the nation.  But, on the whole, it is impossible\r\nto deny that the United States is a free, a prosperous, and a happy\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe national metropolis has, during these past sixty years, enjoyed\r\npeaceful progress.  In 1827 the population of the entire District\r\nof Columbia was less than seventy-five thousand, of whom sixty-one\r\nthousand were inhabitants of the city of Washington; now the\r\npopulation of the District is two hundred and three thousand, and\r\nthat of Washington is about one hundred and fifty thousand.  The\r\nincrease of wealth has been even greater than the increase of\r\npopulation.  Then there was not a paved street, and it was often\r\ndifficult to extract carriages from mud-holes in the principal\r\nthoroughfares; now there are many miles of stone and asphalt street\r\npavements, shaded by thousands of forest trees.  Then there were\r\ntwenty-four churches, now there are over two hundred.  Then there\r\nwere no public schools for white children that amounted to much,\r\nand it was forbidden by law to teach colored children, now there\r\nare scores of schools, with their hundreds of teachers, and twenty-\r\nsix thousand six hundred and ninety-six pupils in the white schools,\r\nand eleven thousand six hundred and forty pupils in the colored\r\nschools--thirty-eight thousand three hundred and thirty-six pupils\r\nin all.  The streets, then dark at night when the moon did not\r\nshine, are now illuminated by electricity and gas.  The public\r\nreservations are ornamented with shrubs and flowers, while numerous\r\nstatues of the heroes and the statesmen of the country are to be\r\nseen in different parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThat the tone of society has been wonderfully improved during the\r\npast sixty years the earlier chapters of this book bear testimony.\r\nDuels and personal encounters are no longer witnessed at the\r\nnational metropolis, and yet our legislators have not grown craven-\r\nhearted, nor do they lack indomitable energy and sound judgment.\r\nNeither is it true that Congress has become demoralized by railroad\r\nspeculations, or degraded by the influence of shoddy, although the\r\nwar subjected its members greatly to these influences, and some\r\nsuccumbed to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver-toned trumpets of peace proclaimed the close of\r\nhostilities, Washington suffered from the laxity of morals and\r\ncorruption attendant upon the presence of a great army of soldiers\r\nand a more unscrupulous legion of contractors.  \"I have seen,\" said\r\nSenator Hoar, on the impeachment of Secretary Belknap before the\r\nSenate, \"the Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs in the\r\nHouse, rise in his place and demand the expulsion of four of his\r\nassociates for making sale of their official privilege of selecting\r\nthe youths to be educated at our military school.  When the greatest\r\nrailroad of the world, binding together the continent and uniting\r\nthe two great seas which wash our shores was finished, I have seen\r\nour national triumph and exultation turned to bitterness and shame\r\nby the unanimous reports of the three Committees of Congress, two\r\nof the House and one here, that every step of that mighty enterprise\r\nhad been taken in fraud.  I have heard in the highest places the\r\nshameless doctrine avowed by men grown old in public offices that\r\nthe true way by which power should be gained in the Republic is to\r\nbribe the people with the offices created for their service, and\r\nthe true end for which it should be used when gained is the promotion\r\nof selfish ambition and the gratification of personal revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe time was when the \"Rex Vestiari,\" as the King of the Lobby\r\nstyled himself, on a silver cup which he impudently presented to\r\na retiring Speaker, had no difficulty in assembling the leading\r\nCongressmen and prominent diplomats around his table to enjoy his\r\nexquisite repasts.  But there has come a more vigorous code of\r\nmorality, and society is now rarely disgraced by the presence of\r\nthese scoundrels.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the political newspapers of the country has greatly\r\nchanged since the Democratic organ at Philadelphia, then the seat\r\nof Government, thanked God, on the morning of Washington's retirement\r\nfrom the Presidential chair, that the country was now rid of the\r\nman who was the source of all its misfortunes.  The Federal newspapers\r\nat Washington City denounced President Jefferson for his degraded\r\nimmorality, and copied the anathemas hurled against him from the\r\nNew England pulpits as an atheist and a satyr.  The letters written\r\nfrom Washington to newspapers in other cities used often to be\r\nvehicles of indecent abuse, and once one of the caused a duel\r\nbetween two Representatives, which resulted in the death of Mr.\r\nCilley, of Maine.  While there is less vituperation and vulgar\r\npersonal abuse by journalists of those \"in authority,\" the pernicious\r\nhabit of \"interviewing\" is a dangerous method of communication\r\nbetween our public men and the people.  The daily and weekly press\r\nof Washington will compare favorably with that of any other city\r\nin the Union.\r\n\r\nA sad feature of Washington life is the legion of Congressional\r\nclaimants, who come here session after session, and too often grow\r\nold and destitute while unsuccessfully prosecuting before Congress\r\na claim which is just, but in some respects irregular.  These ruined\r\nsuitors, threadbare and slipshod, begging or borrowing their daily\r\nbread, recall Charles Dickens' portraiture of the Jarndyce _vs_.\r\nJarndyce Chancery suite, which had become so complicated that no\r\none alive knew what it meant.  The French spoilation claims that\r\nwere being vigorously prosecuted in 1827 are yet undetermined in\r\n1886.  None of the original claimants survive, but they have left\r\nheirs and legatees, executors and assignees, who have perennially\r\npresented their cases, and who are now indulging in high hopes of\r\nsuccess.  Government, after more than fourscore years of unjustifiable\r\nprocrastination, is at last having the claims adjudicated, and in\r\ntime the heirs of the long-suffering holders will be paid.\r\n\r\nUp to the commencement of the great Rebellion, Washington was\r\nsocially a Southern city, and although there have since been\r\nimmigrations from the Northeast and the Northwest, with the\r\nintermediate regions, the foundation layer sympathizes with those\r\nwho have returned from \"Dixie\" to control society and direct American\r\npolitics.  Many of those known as the \"old families\" lost their\r\nproperty by the emancipation of their slaves, and are rarely seen\r\nin public, unless one of the Virginia Lees or the daughter of\r\nJefferson Davis comes to Washington, when they receive the\r\nrepresentatives of \"the Lost Cause\" with every possible honor.\r\nThere are but few large cities at the South, and intelligent people\r\nfrom that section enjoy the metropolis, where they are more at home\r\nthan in the bustling commercial centres of the North, and where\r\ntheir provincialisms and customs are soon replaced by the quiet\r\nconventialities and courtesies of modern civilization.  There are\r\na few of the old camp-followers here who perfected their vices\r\nwhile wearing \"the blue\" or \"the gray,\" and they occasionally\r\nindulge in famous revels, when, to use one of their old army phrases,\r\nthey \"paint the town red.\"\r\n\r\nWashington society does not all centre around the Capitol, or in\r\nthe legal circle that clusters around the Supreme Court, on in the\r\nBureaucracy, where vigor of brains atones for a lack of polish, or\r\namong the diplomats, worshiped by the young women and envied by\r\nthe young men.  Vulgar people who amass fortunes by successful\r\ngambling in stocks, pork, or grain can attain a great deal of cheap\r\nnewspaper notoriety for their social expenditures here, and some\r\nmen of distinction can be attracted to their houses by champagne\r\nand terrapin, but their social existence is a mere sham, like their\r\nveneered furniture and their plated spoons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Washington, from a new settlement of provincial\r\ninsignificance, has become the scientific and literary, as well as\r\nthe political capital of the Union.  Unfitted by its situation or\r\nits surroundings for either commerce or manufactures, the metropolis\r\nis becoming, like ancient Athens, a great school of philosophy,\r\nhistory, archaeology, and the fine arts.  The nucleus of scientific\r\nand literary operations is the Smithsonian Institution, which,\r\nunder the direction of Professor Spencer F. Baird, reflects high\r\nhonor upon its generous founder, and is in fact what he intended\r\nit should be--an institution \"to increase and diffuse knowledge\r\namong men.\"\r\n\r\nIn the National Museum there is a judicious admixture of the past\r\nand present, and still more, happily blending with these, are not\r\nonly the wonders of the vegetable and floral kingdom, but of those\r\ngeological, zoological, and ethnological marvels which it is the\r\nprivilege of this age to have brought to light and classified.  It\r\nis not only the storehouse of the results of scientific expeditions\r\nfitted out by the United States, but the depository of the\r\ncontributions of foreign nations, which added so much to the\r\nCentennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876.  The work of the\r\nUnited States Fish Commission is too well known to require description,\r\nand is of itself well worth a journey to Washington.  Then there\r\nare the museums of the State, the War, and the Navy Departments,\r\nwith that of the Department of Agriculture and the Army Medical\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory, with its magnificent instruments for astronomical\r\npurposes, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the Naval Hydrographic\r\nBureau, each with its stores of maps and charts; the Bureau of\r\nEducation, the Indian Office, the General Land Office, and the\r\nGeological Survey are all scientific institutions of acknowledged\r\nposition.  The Corcoran Art Gallery, and the Roman Catholic and\r\nthe Protestant Colleges, with their law and medical schools, add\r\nto the scientific and artistic attractions of the capital, while\r\nthe facilities afforded by the Congressional and other libraries\r\nfor study and research are of such a superior character that many\r\nmen engaged in scientific pursuits have been attracted here from\r\nother sections.\r\n\r\nThere are also in Washington the Philosophical, the Anthropological,\r\nand the Biological Societies, devoted to general scientific\r\ninvestigation, and at the Cosmos Club the scientists develop the\r\nsocial side of their natures.  The house long occupied by Mrs.\r\nMadison has been fitted up by the Club, the membership of which\r\nincludes about all of the prominent scientific men in the city,\r\nand it is said that there are more men of distinction in science\r\nin Washington than in any other city in the country.\r\n\r\nL'ENVOI\r\n\r\nIt is not without regret that I lay down my pen, and cease work on\r\nthe Reminiscences of Sixty Years, of my life.  As I remarked in\r\nthe Preface, my great difficulty has been what to select from the\r\nmasses of literary material concerning the national metropolis that\r\nI have accumulated during the past six decades, and put away in\r\ndiaries, scrap-books, correspondence with the press, and note-books.\r\nMany important events have been passed over more lightly than their\r\nimportance warranted, while others have been wholly ignored.  But\r\nI trust that I have given my readers a glance at the most salient\r\nfeatures of Life in Washington, as I have actually seen it, without\r\nindulging in sycophantic flattery of men, or glossing over the\r\nunpleasant features of events.  \"Paint me as I am,\" said Cromwell,\r\nand I have endeavored to portray the Federal Metropolis as I have\r\nseen it.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX [omitted]",
