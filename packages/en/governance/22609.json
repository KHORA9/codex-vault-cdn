Endowed with irresponsible power, tempted by passions\r\nwhose existence in himself he had never suspected, and betrayed by the\r\npolitical necessities of his position, he became gradually guilty of\r\nall the crimes and the luxury which had seemed so hideous to him in his\r\nhermitage over a dish of water-cresses.\r\n\r\nThe American Tract Society from small beginnings has risen to be the\r\ndispenser of a yearly revenue of nearly half a million. It has become a\r\ngreat establishment, with a traditional policy, with the distrust of\r\nchange and the dislike of disturbing questions (especially of such as\r\nwould lessen its revenues) natural to great establishments. It had been\r\npoor and weak; it has become rich and powerful. The hermit has become\r\nking.\r\n\r\nIf the pious men who founded the American Tract Society had been told\r\nthat within forty years they would be watchful of their publications,\r\nlest, by inadvertence, anything disrespectful might be spoken of the\r\nAfrican Slave-trade,--that they would consider it an ample equivalent\r\nfor compulsory dumbness on the vices of Slavery, that their colporteurs\r\ncould awaken the minds of Southern brethren to the horrors of St.\r\nBartholomew,--that they would hold their peace about the body of Cuffee\r\ndancing to the music of the cart-whip, provided only they could save\r\nthe soul of Sambo alive by presenting him a pamphlet, which he could\r\nnot read, on the depravity of the double shuffle,--that they would\r\nconsent to be fellow members in the Tract Society with him who sold\r\ntheir fellow members in Christ on the auction block, if he agreed with\r\nthem in condemning Transubstantiation (and it would not be difficult\r\nfor a gentleman who ignored the real presence of God in his brother man\r\nto deny it in the sacramental wafer),--if those excellent men had been\r\ntold this, they would have shrunk in horror, and exclaimed, \"Are thy\r\nservants dogs, that they should do these things?\"\r\n\r\nYet this is precisely the present position of the Society.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of evading the responsibility of such inconsistency.\r\nThe first is by an appeal to the Society's Constitution, and by\r\nclaiming to interpret it strictly in accordance with the rules of law\r\nas applied to contracts, whether between individuals or States. The\r\nsecond is by denying that Slavery is opposed to the genius of\r\nChristianity, and that any moral wrongs are the necessary results of\r\nit. We will not be so unjust to the Society as to suppose that any of\r\nits members would rely on this latter plea, and shall therefore confine\r\nourselves to a brief consideration of the other.\r\n\r\nIn order that the same rules of interpretation should be considered\r\napplicable to the Constitution of the Society and to that of the United\r\nStates, we must attribute to the former a solemnity and importance\r\nwhich involve a palpable absurdity. To claim for it the verbal accuracy\r\nand the legal wariness of a mere contract is equally at war with common\r\nsense and the facts of the case; and even were it not so, the party to\r\na bond who should attempt to escape its ethical obligation by a legal\r\nquibble of construction would be put in coventry by all honest men. In\r\npoint of fact, the Constitution was simply the minutes of an agreement\r\namong certain gentlemen, to define the limits within which they would\r\naccept trust funds, and the objects for which they should expend them.\r\n\r\nBut if we accept the alternative offered by the advocates of strict\r\nconstruction, we shall not find that their case is strengthened.\r\nClaiming that where the meaning of an instrument is doubtful, it should\r\nbe interpreted according to the contemporary understanding of its\r\nframers, they argue that it would be absurd to suppose that gentlemen\r\nfrom the Southern States would have united to form a society that\r\nincluded in its objects any discussion of the moral duties arising from\r\nthe institution of Slavery. Admitting the first part of their\r\nproposition, we deny the conclusion they seek to draw from it. They are\r\nguilty of a glaring anachronism in assuming the same opinions and\r\nprejudices to have existed in 1825 which are undoubtedly influential in\r\n1858. The Anti-slavery agitation did not begin until 1831, and the\r\ndebates in the Virginia Convention prove conclusively that six years\r\nafter the foundation of the Tract Society, the leading men in that\r\nState, men whose minds had been trained and whose characters had been\r\ntempered in that school of action and experience which was open to all\r\nduring the heroic period of our history, had not yet suffered such\r\ndistortion of the intellect through passion and such deadening of the\r\nconscience through interest, as would have prevented their discussing\r\neither the moral or the political aspects of Slavery, and precluded\r\nthem from uniting in any effort to make the relation between master and\r\nslave less demoralizing to the one and less imbruting to the other.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is claimed that the words of the Constitution are conclusive,\r\nand that the declaration that the publications of the Society shall be\r\nsuch as are \"satisfactory to all Evangelical Christians\" forbids by\r\nimplication the issuing of any tract which could possibly offend the\r\nbrethren in Slave States. The Society, it is argued, can publish only\r\non topics about which all Evangelical Christians are agreed, and must,\r\ntherefore, avoid everything in which the question of politics is\r\ninvolved. But what are the facts about matters other than Slavery?\r\nTracts have been issued and circulated in which Dancing is condemned as\r\nsinful; are all Evangelical Christians agreed about this? On the\r\nTemperance question, against Catholicism,--have these topics never\r\nentered into our politics? The simple truth is that Slavery is the only\r\nsubject about which the Publishing Committee have felt Constitutional\r\nscruples. Till this question arose, they were like men in perfect\r\nhealth, never suspecting that they had any constitution at all; but\r\nnow, like hypochondriacs, they feel it in every pore, at the least\r\nbreath from the eastward.\r\n\r\nIf a strict construction of the words \"all Evangelical Christians\" be\r\ninsisted on, we are at a loss to see where the committee could draw the\r\ndividing line between what might be offensive and what allowable. The\r\nSociety publish tracts in which the study of the Scriptures is enforced\r\nand their denial to the laity by Romanists assailed. But throughout the\r\nSouth it is criminal to teach a slave to read; throughout the South no\r\nbook could be distributed among the servile population more incendiary\r\nthan the Bible, if they could only read it. Will not our Southern\r\nbrethren take alarm? The Society is reduced to the dilemma of either\r\ndenying that the African has a soul to be saved, or of consenting to\r\nthe terrible mockery of assuring him that the way of life is to be\r\nfound only by searching a book which he is forbidden to open.\r\n\r\nIf we carry out this doctrine of strict construction to its legitimate\r\nresults, we shall find that it involves a logical absurdity. What is\r\nthe number of men whose outraged sensibilities may claim the\r\nsuppression of a tract? Is the _taboo_ of a thousand valid? Of a\r\nhundred? Of ten? Or are tracts to be distributed only to those who will\r\nfind their doctrine agreeable, and are the Society's colporteurs to be\r\ninstructed that a Temperance essay is the proper thing for a\r\ntotal-abstinent infidel, and a sermon on the Atonement for a distilling\r\ndeacon? If the aim of the Society be only to convert men from sins they\r\nhave no mind to, and to convince them of errors to which they have no\r\ntemptation, they might as well be spending their money to persuade\r\nschoolmasters that two and two make four, or geometricians that there\r\ncannot be two obtuse angles in a triangle. If this be their notion of\r\nthe way in which the gospel is to be preached, we do not wonder that\r\nthey have found it necessary to print a tract upon the impropriety of\r\nsleeping in church.\r\n\r\nBut the Society are concluded by their own action; for in 1857 they\r\nunanimously adopted the following resolution: \"That those moral duties\r\nwhich grow out of the existence of Slavery, as well as those moral\r\nevils and vices which it is known to promote and which are condemned in\r\nScripture, and so much deplored by Evangelical Christians, undoubtedly\r\ndo fall within the province of this Society, and can and ought to be\r\ndiscussed in a fraternal and Christian spirit.\" The Society saw clearly\r\nthat it was impossible to draw a Mason and Dixon's line in the world of\r\nethics, to divide Duty by a parallel of latitude. The only line which\r\nChrist drew is that which parts the sheep from the goats, that great\r\nhorizon-line of the moral nature of man, which is the boundary between\r\nlight and darkness. The Society, by yielding (as they have done in\r\n1858) to what are pleasantly called the \"objections\" of the South\r\n(objections of so forcible a nature that we are told the colporteurs\r\nwere \"forced to flee\") virtually exclude the black man, if born to the\r\nsouthward of a certain arbitrary line, from the operation of God's\r\nprovidence, and thereby do as great a wrong to the Creator as the\r\nEpiscopal Church did to the artist when without public protest they\r\nallowed Ary Scheffer's _Christus Consolator_, with the figure of the\r\nslave left out, to be published in a Prayer-Book.\r\n\r\nThe Society is not asked to disseminate Anti-slavery doctrines, but\r\nsimply to be even-handed between master and slave, and, since they have\r\nrecommended Sambo and Toney to be obedient to Mr. Legree, to remind him\r\nin turn that he also has duties toward the bodies and souls of his\r\nbondmen. But we are told that the time has not yet arrived, that at\r\npresent the ears of our Southern brethren are closed against all\r\nappeals, that God in his good time will turn their hearts, and that\r\nthen, and not till then, will be the fitting occasion to do something\r\nin the premises. But if the Society is to await this golden opportunity\r\nwith such exemplary patience in one case, why not in all? If it is to\r\ndecline any attempt at converting the sinner till after God has\r\nconverted him, will there be any special necessity for a tract society\r\nat all? Will it not be a little presumptuous, as well as superfluous,\r\nto undertake the doing over again of what He has already done? We fear\r\nthat the studies of Blackstone, upon which the gentlemen who argue thus\r\nhave entered in order to fit themselves for the legal and\r\nconstitutional argument of the question, have confused their minds, and\r\nthat they are misled by some fancied analogy between a tract and an\r\naction of trover, and conceive that the one, like the other, cannot be\r\nemployed till after an actual conversion has taken place.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions reported by the Special Committee at the annual meeting\r\nof 1857, drawn up with great caution and with a sincere desire to make\r\nwhole the breach in the Society, have had the usual fate of all\r\nattempts to reconcile incompatibilities by compromise. They express\r\nconfidence in the Publishing Committee, and at the same time impliedly\r\ncondemn them by recommending them to do precisely what they had all\r\nalong scrupulously avoided doing. The result was just what might have\r\nbeen expected. Both parties among the Northern members of the Society,\r\nthose who approved the former action of the Publishing Committee and\r\nthose who approved the new policy recommended in the resolutions, those\r\nwho favored silence and those who favored speech on the subject of\r\nSlavery, claimed the victory, while the Southern brethren, as usual,\r\nrefused to be satisfied with anything short of unconditional\r\nsubmission. The word Compromise, as far as Slavery is concerned, has\r\nalways been of fatal augury. The concessions of the South have been\r\nlike the \"With all my worldly goods I thee endow\" of a bankrupt\r\nbridegroom, who thereby generously bestows all his debts upon his wife,\r\nand as a small return for his magnanimity consents to accept all her\r\npersonal and a life estate in all her real property. The South is\r\nwilling that the Tract Society should expend its money to convince the\r\nslave that he has a soul to be saved so far as he is obedient to his\r\nmaster, but not to persuade the master that he has a soul to undergo a\r\nvery different process so far as he is unmerciful to his slave.\r\n\r\nWe Americans are very fond of this glue of compromise. Like so many\r\nquack cements, it is advertised to make the mended parts of the vessel\r\nstronger than those which have never been broken, but, like them, it\r\nwill not stand hot water,--and as the question of slavery is sure to\r\nplunge all who approach it, even with the best intentions, into that\r\nfatal element, the patched-up brotherhood, which but yesterday was\r\nwarranted to be better than new, falls once more into a heap of\r\nincoherent fragments. The last trial of the virtues of the Patent\r\nRedintegrator by the Special Committee of the Tract Society has ended\r\nlike all the rest, and as all attempts to buy peace at too dear a rate\r\nmust end. Peace is an excellent thing, but principle and pluck are\r\nbetter; and the man who sacrifices them to gain it finds at last that\r\nhe has crouched under the Caudine yoke to purchase only a contemptuous\r\ntoleration, that leaves him at war with his own self-respect and the\r\ninvincible forces of his higher nature.\r\n\r\nBut the peace which Christ promised to his followers was not of this\r\nworld; the good gift he brought them was not peace, but a sword. It was\r\nno sword of territorial conquest, but that flaming blade of conscience\r\nand self-conviction which lightened between our first parents and their\r\nlost Eden,--that sword of the Spirit that searcheth all things,--which\r\nsevers one by one the ties of passion, of interest, of self-pride, that\r\nbind the soul to earth,--whose implacable edge may divide a man from\r\nfamily, from friends, from whatever is nearest and dearest,--and which\r\nhovers before him like the air-drawn dagger of Macbeth, beckoning him,\r\nnot to crime, but to the legitimate royalties of self-denial and\r\nself-sacrifice, to the freedom which is won only by surrender of the\r\nwill. Christianity has never been concession, never peace; it is\r\ncontinual aggression; one province of wrong conquered, its pioneers are\r\nalready in the heart of another. The mile-stones of its onward march\r\ndown the ages have not been monuments of material power, but the\r\nblackened stakes of martyrs, trophies of individual fidelity to\r\nconviction. For it is the only religion which is superior to all\r\nendowment, to all authority,--which has a bishopric and a cathedral\r\nwherever a single human soul has surrendered itself to God. That very\r\nspirit of doubt, inquiry, and fanaticism for private judgment, with\r\nwhich Romanists reproach Protestantism, is its stamp and token of\r\nauthenticity,--the seal of Christ, and not of the Fisherman.\r\n\r\nWe do not wonder at the division which has taken place in the Tract\r\nSociety, nor do we regret it. The ideal life of a Christian is possible\r\nto very few, but we naturally look for a nearer approach to it in those\r\nwho associate together to disseminate the doctrines which they believe\r\nto be its formative essentials, and there is nothing which the enemies\r\nof religion seize on so gladly as any inconsistency between the conduct\r\nand the professions of such persons. Though utterly indifferent to the\r\nwrongs of the slave, the scoffer would not fail to remark upon the\r\nhollowness of a Christianity which was horror-stricken at a dance or a\r\nSunday drive, while it was blandly silent about the separation of\r\nfamilies, the putting asunder whom God had joined, the selling\r\nChristian girls for Christian harems, and the thousand horrors of a\r\nsystem which can lessen the agonies it inflicts only by debasing the\r\nminds and souls of the race on which it inflicts them. Is your\r\nChristianity, then, he would say, a respecter of persons, and does it\r\ncondone the sin because the sinner can contribute to your coffers? Was\r\nthere ever a simony like this,--that does not sell, but withholds, the\r\ngift of God for a price?\r\n\r\nThe world naturally holds the Society to a stricter accountability than\r\nit would insist upon in ordinary cases. Were they only a club of\r\ngentlemen associated for their own amusement, it would be very natural\r\nand proper that they should exclude all questions which would introduce\r\ncontroversy, and that, however individually interested in certain\r\nreforms, they should not force them upon others who would consider them\r\na bore. But a society of professing Christians, united for the express\r\npurpose of carrying both the theory and the practice of the New\r\nTestament into every household in the land, has voluntarily subjected\r\nitself to a graver responsibility, and renounced all title to fall back\r\nupon any reserved right of personal comfort or convenience.\r\n\r\nWe say, then, that we are glad to see this division in the Tract\r\nSociety; not glad because of the division, but because it has sprung\r\nfrom an earnest effort to relieve the Society of a reproach which was\r\nnot only impairing its usefulness, but doing an injury to the cause of\r\ntruth and sincerity everywhere. We have no desire to impugn the motives\r\nof those who consider themselves conservative members of the Society;\r\nwe believe them to be honest in their convictions, or their want of\r\nthem; but we think they have mistaken notions as to what conservatism\r\nis, and that they are wrong in supposing it to consist in refusing to\r\nwipe away the film on their spectacle-glasses which prevents their\r\nseeing the handwriting on the wall, or in conserving reverently the\r\nbarnacles on their ship's bottom and the dry-rot in its knees. We yield\r\nto none of them in reverence for the Past; it is there only that the\r\nimagination can find repose and seclusion; there dwells that silent\r\nmajority whose experience guides our action and whose wisdom shapes our\r\nthought in spite of ourselves;--but it is not length of days that can\r\nmake evil reverend, nor persistence in inconsistency that can give it\r\nthe power or the claim of orderly precedent. Wrong, though its\r\ntitle-deeds go back to the days of Sodom, is by nature a thing of\r\nyesterday,--while the right, of which we became conscious but an hour\r\nago, is more ancient than the stars, and of the essence of Heaven. If\r\nit were proposed to establish Slavery to-morrow, should we have more\r\npatience with its patriarchal argument than with the parallel claim of\r\nMormonism? That Slavery is old is but its greater condemnation; that we\r\nhave tolerated it so long, the strongest plea for our doing so no\r\nlonger. There is one institution to which we owe our first allegiance,\r\none that is more sacred and venerable than any other,--the soul and\r\nconscience of Man.\r\n\r\nWhat claim has Slavery to immunity from discussion? We are told that\r\ndiscussion is dangerous. Dangerous to what? Truth invites it, courts\r\nthe point of the Ithuriel-spear, whose touch can but reveal more\r\nclearly the grace and grandeur of her angelic proportions. The\r\nadvocates of Slavery have taken refuge in the last covert of desperate\r\nsophism, and affirm that their institution is of Divine ordination,\r\nthat its bases are laid in the nature of man. Is anything, then, of\r\nGod's contriving endangered by inquiry? Was it the system of the\r\nuniverse, or the monks, that trembled at the telescope of Galileo? Did\r\nthe circulation of the firmament stop in terror because Newton laid his\r\ndaring finger on its pulse? But it is idle to discuss a proposition so\r\nmonstrous. There is no right of sanctuary for a crime against humanity,\r\nand they who drag an unclean thing to the horns of the altar bring it\r\nto vengeance, and not to safety.\r\n\r\nEven granting that Slavery were all that its apologists assume it to\r\nbe, and that the relation of master and slave were of God's appointing,\r\nwould not its abuses be just the thing which it was the duty of\r\nChristian men to protest against, and, as far as might be, to root out?\r\nWould our courts feel themselves debarred from interfering to rescue a\r\ndaughter from a parent who wished to make merchandise of her purity, or\r\na wife from a husband who was brutal to her, by the plea that parental\r\nauthority and marriage were of Divine ordinance? Would a police-justice\r\ndischarge a drunkard who pleaded the patriarchal precedent of Noah? or\r\nwould he not rather give him another month in the House of Correction\r\nfor his impudence?\r\n\r\nThe Anti-slavery question is not one which the Tract Society can\r\nexclude by triumphant majorities, nor put to shame by a comparison of\r\nrespectabilities. Mixed though it has been with politics, it is in no\r\nsense political, and springing naturally from the principles of that\r\nreligion which traces its human pedigree to a manger, and whose first\r\napostles were twelve poor men against the whole world, it can dispense\r\nwith numbers and earthly respect. The clergyman may ignore it in the\r\npulpit, but it confronts him in his study; the church-member, who has\r\nsuppressed it in parish-meeting, opens it with the pages of his\r\nTestament; the merchant, who has shut it out of his house and his\r\nheart, finds it lying in wait for him, a gaunt fugitive, in the hold of\r\nhis ship; the lawyer, who has declared that it is no concern of his,\r\nfinds it thrust upon him in the brief of the slave-hunter; the\r\nhistorian, who had cautiously evaded it, stumbles over it at Bunker\r\nHill. And why? Because it is not political, but moral,--because it is\r\nnot local, but national,--because it is not a test of party, but of\r\nindividual honesty and honor. The wrong which we allow our nation to\r\nperpetrate we cannot localize, if we would; we cannot hem it within the\r\nlimits of Washington or Kansas; sooner or later, it will force itself\r\ninto the conscience and sit by the hearthstone of every citizen.\r\n\r\nIt is not partisanship, it is not fanaticism, that has forced this\r\nmatter of Anti-slavery upon the American people; it is the spirit of\r\nChristianity, which appeals from prejudices and predilections to the\r\nmoral consciousness of the individual man; that spirit elastic as air,\r\npenetrative as heat, invulnerable as sunshine, against which creed\r\nafter creed and institution after institution have measured their\r\nstrength and been confounded; that restless spirit which refuses to\r\ncrystallize in any sect or form, but persists, a Divinely commissioned\r\nradical and reconstructor, in trying every generation with a new\r\ndilemma between ease and interest on the one hand, and duty on the\r\nother. Shall it be said that its kingdom is not of this world? In one\r\nsense, and that the highest, it certainly is not; but just as certainly\r\nChrist never intended those words to be used as a subterfuge by which\r\nto escape our responsibilities in the life of business and politics.\r\nLet the cross, the sword, and the arena answer, whether the world, that\r\nthen was, so understood its first preachers and apostles. Caesar and\r\nFlamen both instinctively dreaded it, not because it aimed at riches or\r\npower, but because it strove to conquer that other world in the moral\r\nnature of mankind, where it could establish a throne against which\r\nwealth and force would be weak and contemptible. No human device has\r\never prevailed against it, no array of majorities or respectabilities;\r\nbut neither Caesar nor Flamen ever conceived a scheme so cunningly\r\nadapted to neutralize its power as that graceful compromise which\r\naccepts it with the lip and denies it in the life, which marries it at\r\nthe altar and divorces it at the church-door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all of us have been watching, with that admiring sympathy which\r\nnever fails to wait on courage and magnanimity, the career of the new\r\nTimoleon in Sicily; while we have been reckoning, with an interest\r\nscarcely less than in some affair of personal concern, the chances and\r\nchanges that bear with furtherance or hindrance upon the fortune of\r\nunited Italy, we are approaching, with a quietness and composure which\r\nmore than anything else mark the essential difference between our own\r\nform of democracy and any other yet known in history, a crisis in our\r\ndomestic policy more momentous than any that has arisen since we became\r\na nation. Indeed, considering the vital consequences for good or evil\r\nthat will follow from the popular decision in November, we might be\r\ntempted to regard the remarkable moderation which has thus far\r\ncharacterized the Presidential canvass as a guilty indifference to the\r\nduty implied in the privilege of suffrage, or a stolid unconsciousness\r\nof the result which may depend upon its exercise in this particular\r\nelection, did we not believe that it arose chiefly from the general\r\npersuasion that the success of the Republican party was a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIn a society like ours, where every man may transmute his private\r\nthought into history and destiny by dropping it into the ballot-box, a\r\npeculiar responsibility rests upon the individual. Nothing can absolve\r\nus from doing our best to look at all public questions as citizens, and\r\ntherefore in some sort as administrators and rulers. For though during\r\nits term of office the government be practically as independent of the\r\npopular will as that of Russia, yet every fourth year the people are\r\ncalled upon to pronounce upon the conduct of their affairs.\r\nTheoretically, at least, to give democracy any standing-ground for an\r\nargument with despotism or oligarchy, a majority of the men composing\r\nit should be statesmen and thinkers. It is a proverb, that to turn a\r\nradical into a conservative there needs only to put him into office,\r\nbecause then the license of speculation or sentiment is limited by a\r\nsense of responsibility; then for the first time he becomes capable of\r\nthat comparative view which sees principles and measures, not in the\r\nnarrow abstract, but in the full breadth of their relations to each\r\nother and to political consequences. The theory of democracy\r\npresupposes something of these results of official position in the\r\nindividual voter, since in exercising his right he becomes for the\r\nmoment an integral part of the governing power.\r\n\r\nHow very far practice is from any likeness to theory, a week's\r\nexperience of our politics suffices to convince us. The very government\r\nitself seems an organized scramble, and Congress a boy's debating-club,\r\nwith the disadvantage of being reported. As our party-creeds are\r\ncommonly represented less by ideas than by persons (who are assumed,\r\nwithout too close a scrutiny, to be the exponents of certain ideas) our\r\npolitics become personal and narrow to a degree never paralleled,\r\nunless in ancient Athens or mediaeval Florence. Our Congress debates and\r\nour newspapers discuss, sometimes for day after day, not questions of\r\nnational interest, not what is wise and right, but what the Honorable\r\nLafayette Skreemer said on the stump, or bad whiskey said for him, half\r\na dozen years ago. If that personage, outraged in all the finer\r\nsensibilities of our common nature, by failing to get the contract for\r\nsupplying the District Court-House at Skreemeropolisville City with\r\nrevolvers, was led to disparage the union of these States, it is seized\r\non as proof conclusive that the party to which he belongs are so many\r\nCat_a_lines,--for Congress is unanimous only in misspelling the name of\r\nthat oft-invoked conspirator. The next Presidential Election looms\r\nalways in advance, so that we seem never to have an actual Chief\r\nMagistrate, but a prospective one, looking to the chances of reelection,\r\nand mingling in all the dirty intrigues of provincial politics with an\r\nunhappy talent for making them dirtier. The cheating mirage of the\r\nWhite House lures our public men away from present duties and\r\nobligations; and if matters go on as they have gone, we shall need a\r\nCommittee of Congress to count the spoons in the public plate-closet,\r\nwhenever a President goes out of office,--with a policeman to watch\r\nevery member of the Committee. We are kept normally in that most\r\nunprofitable of predicaments, a state of transition, and politicians\r\nmeasure their words and deeds by a standard of immediate and temporary\r\nexpediency,--an expediency not as concerning the nation, but which, if\r\nmore than merely personal, is no wider than the interests of party.\r\n\r\nIs all this a result of the failure of democratic institutions? Rather\r\nof the fact that those institutions have never yet had a fair trial,\r\nand that for the last thirty years an abnormal element has been acting\r\nadversely with continually increasing strength. Whatever be the effect\r\nof slavery upon the States where it exists, there can be no doubt that\r\nits moral influence upon the North has been most disastrous. It has\r\ncompelled our politicians into that first fatal compromise with their\r\nmoral instincts and hereditary principles which makes all consequent\r\nones easy; it has accustomed us to makeshifts instead of statesmanship,\r\nto subterfuge instead of policy, to party-platforms for opinions, and\r\nto a defiance of the public sentiment of the civilized world for\r\npatriotism. We have been asked to admit, first, that it was a necessary\r\nevil; then that it was a good both to master and slave; then that it\r\nwas the corner-stone of free institutions; then that it was a system\r\ndivinely instituted under the Old Law and sanctioned under the New.\r\nWith a representation, three fifths of it based on the assumption that\r\nnegroes are men, the South turns upon us and insists on our\r\nacknowledging that they are things. After compelling her Northern\r\nallies to pronounce the \"free and equal\" clause of the preamble to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence (because it stood in the way of enslaving\r\nmen) a manifest absurdity, she has declared, through the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, that negroes are not men in the ordinary meaning\r\nof the word. To eat dirt is bad enough, but to find that we have eaten\r\nmore than was necessary may chance to give us an indigestion. The\r\nslaveholding interest has gone on step by step, forcing concession\r\nafter concession, till it needs but little to secure it forever in the\r\npolitical supremacy of the country. Yield to its latest demand,--let it\r\nmould the evil destiny of the Territories,--and the thing is done past\r\nrecall. The next Presidential Election is to say _Yes_ or _No_.\r\n\r\nBut we should not regard the mere question of political preponderancy\r\nas of vital consequence, did it not involve a continually increasing\r\nmoral degradation on the part of the Non-slaveholding States,--for Free\r\nStates they could not be called much longer. Sordid and materialistic\r\nviews of the true value and objects of society and government are\r\nprofessed more and more openly by the leaders of popular outcry,--for\r\nit cannot be called public opinion. That side of human nature which it\r\nhas been the object of all lawgivers and moralists to repress and\r\nsubjugate is flattered and caressed; whatever is profitable is right;\r\nand already the slave-trade, as yielding a greater return on the\r\ncapital invested than any other traffic, is lauded as the highest\r\nachievement of human reason and justice. Mr. Hammond has proclaimed the\r\naccession of King Cotton, but he seems to have forgotten that history\r\nis not without examples of kings who have lost their crowns through the\r\nfolly and false security of their ministers. It is quite true that\r\nthere is a large class of reasoners who would weigh all questions of\r\nright and wrong in the balance of trade; but we cannot bring ourselves\r\nto believe that it is a wise political economy which makes cotton by\r\nunmaking men, or a far-seeing statesmanship which looks on an immediate\r\nmoney-profit as a safe equivalent for a beggared public sentiment. We\r\nthink Mr. Hammond even a little premature in proclaiming the new\r\nPretender. The election of November may prove a Culloden. Whatever its\r\nresult, it is to settle, for many years to come, the question whether\r\nthe American idea is to govern this continent, whether the Occidental\r\nor the Oriental theory of society is to mould our future, whether we\r\nare to recede from principles which eighteen Christian centuries have\r\nbeen slowly establishing at the cost of so many saintly lives at the\r\nstake and so many heroic ones on the scaffold and the battle-field, in\r\nfavor of some fancied assimilation to the household arrangements of\r\nAbraham, of which all that can be said with certainty is that they did\r\nnot add to his domestic happiness.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this election is a turning-point in our history; for,\r\nalthough there are four candidates, there are really, as everybody\r\nknows, but two parties, and a single question that divides them. The\r\nsupporters of Messrs. Bell and Everett have adopted as their platform\r\nthe Constitution, the Union, and the enforcement of the Laws. This may\r\nbe very convenient, but it is surely not very explicit. The cardinal\r\nquestion on which the whole policy of the country is to turn--a\r\nquestion, too, which this very election must decide in one way or the\r\nother--is the interpretation to be put upon certain clauses of the\r\nConstitution. All the other parties equally assert their loyalty to\r\nthat instrument. Indeed, it is quite the fashion. The removers of all\r\nthe ancient landmarks of our policy, the violators of thrice-pledged\r\nfaith, the planners of new treachery to established compromise, all\r\ntake refuge in the Constitution,--\r\n\r\n    \"Like thieves that in a hemp-plot lie,\r\n    Secure against the hue and cry.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way the first Bonaparte renewed his profession of faith in\r\nthe Revolution at every convenient opportunity; and the second follows\r\nthe precedent of his uncle, though the uninitiated fail to see any\r\nlogical sequence from 1789 to 1815 or 1860. If Mr. Bell loves the\r\nConstitution, Mr. Breckinridge is equally fond; that Egeria of our\r\nstatesmen could be \"happy with either, were t' other dear charmer\r\naway.\" Mr. Douglas confides the secret of his passion to the\r\nunloquacious clams of Rhode Island, and the chief complaint made\r\nagainst Mr. Lincoln by his opponents is that he is _too_ Constitutional.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the only point in which voters are interested is, What do\r\nthey mean by the Constitution? Mr. Breckinridge means the superiority\r\nof a certain exceptional species of property over all others; nay, over\r\nman himself. Mr. Douglas, with a different formula for expressing it,\r\nmeans practically the same thing. Both of them mean that Labor has no\r\nrights which Capital is bound to respect,--that there is no higher law\r\nthan human interest and cupidity. Both of them represent not merely the\r\nnarrow principles of a section, but the still narrower and more selfish\r\nones of a caste. Both of them, to be sure, have convenient phrases to\r\nbe juggled with before election, and which mean one thing or another,\r\nor neither one thing nor another, as a particular exigency may seem to\r\nrequire; but since both claim the regular Democratic nomination, we\r\nhave little difficulty in divining what their course would be after the\r\nfourth of March, if they should chance to be elected. We know too well\r\nwhat regular Democracy is, to like either of the two faces which each\r\nshows by turns under the same hood. Everybody remembers Baron Grimm's\r\nstory of the Parisian showman, who in 1789 exhibited the _royal_ Bengal\r\ntiger under the new character of _national_, as more in harmony with\r\nthe changed order of things. Could the animal have lived till 1848,\r\nhe would probably have found himself offered to the discriminating\r\npublic as the _democratic_ and _social_ ornament of the jungle. The\r\nPro-slavery party of this country seeks the popular favor under even\r\nmore frequent and incongruous _aliases_: it is now _national_, now\r\n_conservative_, now _constitutional_; here it represents\r\nSquatter-Sovereignty, and there the power of Congress over the\r\nTerritories; but, under whatever name, its nature remains unchanged,\r\nand its instincts are none the less predatory and destructive.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's position is set forth with sufficient precision in the\r\nplatform adopted by the Chicago Convention; but what are we to make of\r\nMessrs. Bell and Everett? Heirs of the stock in trade of two defunct\r\nparties, the Whig and Know-Nothing, do they hope to resuscitate them?\r\nor are they only like the inconsolable widows of Pere la Chaise, who,\r\nwith an eye to former customers, make use of the late Andsoforth's\r\ngravestone to advertise that they still carry on business at the old\r\nstand? Mr. Everett, in his letter accepting the nomination, gave us\r\nonly a string of reasons why he should not have accepted it at all; and\r\nMr. Bell preserves a silence singularly at variance with his\r\npatronymic. The only public demonstration of principle that we have\r\nseen is an emblematic bell drawn upon a wagon by a single horse, with a\r\nman to lead him, and a boy to make a nuisance of the tinkling symbol as\r\nit moves along. Are all the figures in this melancholy procession\r\nequally emblematic? If so, which of the two candidates is typified in\r\nthe unfortunate who leads the horse?--for we believe the only hope of\r\nthe party is to get one of them elected by some hocus-pocus in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. The little boy, we suppose, is intended to\r\nrepresent the party, which promises to be so conveniently small that\r\nthere will be an office for every member of it, if its candidate should\r\nwin. Did not the bell convey a plain allusion to the leading name on\r\nthe ticket, we should conceive it an excellent type of the hollowness\r\nof those fears for the safety of the Union, in case of Mr. Lincoln's\r\nelection, whose changes are so loudly rung,--its noise having once or\r\ntwice given rise to false alarms of fire, till people found out what it\r\nreally was. Whatever profound moral it be intended to convey, we find\r\nin it a similitude that is not without significance as regards the\r\nprofessed creed of the party. The industrious youth who operates upon\r\nit has evidently some notion of the measured and regular motion that\r\nbefits the tongues of well-disciplined and conservative bells. He does\r\nhis best to make theory and practice coincide; but with every jolt on\r\nthe road an involuntary variation is produced, and the sonorous\r\npulsation becomes rapid or slow accordingly. We have observed that the\r\nConstitution was liable to similar derangements, and we very much doubt\r\nwhether Mr. Bell himself (since, after all, the Constitution would\r\npractically be nothing else than his interpretation of it) would keep\r\nthe same measured tones that are so easy on the smooth path of\r\ncandidacy, when it came to conducting the car of State over some of the\r\nrough places in the highway of Manifest Destiny, and some of those\r\npassages in our politics which, after the fashion of new countries, are\r\nrather _corduroy_ in character.\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately, we are not left wholly in the dark as to the aims of\r\nthe self-styled Constitutional party. One of its most distinguished\r\nmembers, Governor Hunt of New York, has given us to understand that its\r\nprime object is the defeat at all hazards of the Republican candidate.\r\nTo achieve so desirable an end, its leaders are ready to coalesce, here\r\nwith the Douglas, and there with the Breckinridge faction of that very\r\nDemocratic party of whose violations of the Constitution, corruption,\r\nand dangerous limberness of principle they have been the lifelong\r\ndenouncers. In point of fact, then, it is perfectly plain that we have\r\nonly two parties in the field: those who favor the extension of\r\nslavery, and those who oppose it,--in other words, a Destructive and a\r\nConservative party.\r\n\r\nWe know very well that the partisans of Mr. Bell, Mr. Douglas, and Mr.\r\nBreckinridge all equally claim the title of conservative: and the fact\r\nis a very curious one, well worthy the consideration of those foreign\r\ncritics who argue that the inevitable tendency of democracy is to\r\ncompel larger and larger concessions to a certain assumed communistic\r\npropensity and hostility to the rights of property on the part of the\r\nworking classes. But the truth is, that revolutionary ideas are\r\npromoted, not by any unthinking hostility to the _rights_ of property,\r\nbut by a well-founded jealousy of its usurpations; and it is Privilege,\r\nand not Property, that is perplexed with fear of change. The\r\nconservative effect of ownership operates with as much force on the man\r\nwith a hundred dollars in an old stocking as on his neighbor with a\r\nmillion in the funds. During the Roman Revolution of '48, the beggars\r\nwho had funded their gains were among the stanchest reactionaries, and\r\nleft Rome with the nobility. No question of the abstract right of\r\nproperty has ever entered directly into our politics, or ever\r\nwill,--the point at issue being, whether a certain exceptional kind of\r\nproperty, already privileged beyond all others, shall be entitled to\r\nstill further privileges at the expense of every other kind. The\r\nextension of slavery over new territory means just this,--that this one\r\nkind of property, not recognized as such by the Constitution, or it\r\nwould never have been allowed to enter into the basis of\r\nrepresentation, shall control the foreign and domestic policy of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nA great deal is said, to be sure, about the rights of the South; but\r\nhas any such right been infringed? When a man invests money in any\r\nspecies of property, he assumes the risks to which it is liable. If he\r\nbuy a house, it may be burned; if a ship, it may be wrecked; if a horse\r\nor an ox, it may die. Now the disadvantage of the Southern kind of\r\nproperty is--how shall we say it so as not to violate our Constitutional\r\nobligations?--that it is exceptional. When it leaves Virginia, it is a\r\nthing; when it arrives in Boston, it becomes a man, speaks human\r\nlanguage, appeals to the justice of the same God whom we all\r\nacknowledge, weeps at the memory of wife and children left behind,--in\r\nshort, hath the same organs and dimensions that a Christian hath, and\r\nis not distinguishable from ordinary Christians, except, perhaps, by a\r\nsimpler and more earnest faith. There are people at the North who\r\nbelieve that, beside _meum_ and _tuum_, there is also such a thing as\r\n_suum_,--who are old-fashioned enough, or weak enough, to have their\r\nfeelings touched by these things, to think that human nature is older\r\nand more sacred than any claim of property whatever, and that it has\r\nrights at least as much to be respected as any hypothetical one of our\r\nSouthern brethren. This, no doubt, makes it harder to recover a\r\nfugitive chattel; but the existence of human nature in a man here and\r\nthere is surely one of those accidents to be counted on at least as\r\noften as fire, shipwreck, or the cattle-disease; and the man who\r\nchooses to put his money into these images of his Maker cut in ebony\r\nshould be content to take the incident risks along with the advantages.\r\nWe should be very sorry to deem this risk capable of diminution; for we\r\nthink that the claims of a common manhood upon us should be at least as\r\nstrong as those of Freemasonry, and that those whom the law of man\r\nturns away should find in the larger charity of the law of God and\r\nNature a readier welcome and surer sanctuary. We shall continue to\r\nthink the negro a man, and on Southern evidence, too, so long as he is\r\ncounted in the population represented on the floor of Congress,--for\r\nthree fifths of perfect manhood would be a high average even among\r\nwhite men; so long as he is hanged or worse, as an example and terror\r\nto others,--for we do not punish one animal for the moral improvement\r\nof the rest; so long as he is considered capable of religious\r\ninstruction,--for we fancy the gorillas would make short work with a\r\nmissionary; so long as there are fears of insurrection,--for we never\r\nheard of a combined effort at revolt in a menagerie. Accordingly, we do\r\nnot see how the particular right of whose infringement we hear so much\r\nis to be made safer by the election of Mr. Bell, Mr. Breckinridge, or\r\nMr. Douglas,--there being quite as little chance that any of them would\r\nabolish human nature as that Mr. Lincoln would abolish slavery. The\r\nsame generous instinct that leads some among us to sympathize with the\r\nsorrows of the bereaved master will always, we fear, influence others\r\nto take part with the rescued man.\r\n\r\nBut if our Constitutional Obligations, as we like to call our\r\nconstitutional timidity or indifference, teach us that a particular\r\ndivinity hedges the Domestic Institution, they do not require us to\r\nforget that we have institutions of our own, worth maintaining and\r\nextending, and not without a certain sacredness, whether we regard the\r\ntraditions of the fathers or the faith of the children. It is high time\r\nthat we should hear something of the rights of the Free States, and of\r\nthe duties consequent upon them. We also have our prejudices to be\r\nrespected, our theory of civilization, of what constitutes the safety\r\nof a state and insures its prosperity, to be applied wherever there is\r\nsoil enough for a human being to stand on and thank God for making him\r\na man. Is conservatism applicable only to property, and not to justice,\r\nfreedom, and public honor? Does it mean merely drifting with the\r\ncurrent of evil times and pernicious counsels, and carefully nursing\r\nthe ills we have, that they may, as their nature it is, grow worse?\r\n\r\nTo be told that we ought not to agitate the question of Slavery, when\r\nit is that which is forever agitating us, is like telling a man with\r\nthe fever and ague on him to stop shaking, and he will be cured. The\r\ndiscussion of Slavery is said to be dangerous, but dangerous to what?\r\nThe manufacturers of the Free States constitute a more numerous class\r\nthan the slaveholders of the South: suppose they should claim an equal\r\nsanctity for the Protective System. Discussion is the very life of free\r\ninstitutions, the fruitful mother of all political and moral\r\nenlightenment, and yet the question of all questions must be tabooed.\r\nThe Swiss guide enjoins silence in the region of avalanches, lest the\r\nmere vibration of the voice should dislodge the ruin clinging by frail\r\nroots of snow. But where is our avalanche to fall? It is to overwhelm\r\nthe Union, we are told. The real danger to the Union will come when the\r\nencroachments of the Slave-Power and the concessions of the Trade-Power\r\nshall have made it a burden instead of a blessing. The real avalanche\r\nto be dreaded,--are we to expect it from the ever-gathering mass of\r\nignorant brute force, with the irresponsibility of animals and the\r\npassions of men, which is one of the fatal necessities of slavery, or\r\nfrom the gradually increasing consciousness of the non-slaveholding\r\npopulation of the Slave States of the true cause of their material\r\nimpoverishment and political inferiority? From one or the other source\r\nits ruinous forces will be fed, but in either event it is not the Union\r\nthat will be imperilled, but the privileged Order who on every occasion\r\nof a thwarted whim have menaced its disruption, and who will then find\r\nin it their only safety.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the \"irrepressible conflict\"--for we accept Mr.\r\nSeward's much-denounced phrase in all the breadth of meaning he ever\r\nmeant to give it--is to take place in the South itself; because the\r\nSlave System is one of those fearful blunders in political economy\r\nwhich are sure, sooner or later, to work their own retribution. The\r\ninevitable tendency of slavery is to concentrate in a few hands the\r\nsoil, the capital, and the power of the countries where it exists, to\r\nreduce the non-slaveholding class to a continually lower and lower\r\nlevel of property, intelligence, and enterprise,--their increase in\r\nnumbers adding much to the economical hardship of their position and\r\nnothing to their political weight in the community. There is no\r\nhome-encouragement of varied agriculture,--for the wants of a slave\r\npopulation are few in number and limited in kind; none of inland trade,\r\nfor that is developed only by communities where education induces\r\nrefinement, where facility of communication stimulates invention and\r\nvariety of enterprise, where newspapers make every man's improvement in\r\ntools, machinery, or culture of the soil an incitement to all, and\r\nbring all the thinkers of the world to teach in the cheap university of\r\nthe people. We do not, of course, mean to say that slaveholding States\r\nmay not and do not produce fine men; but they fail, by the inherent\r\nvice of their constitution and its attendant consequences, to create\r\nenlightened, powerful, and advancing communities of men, which is the\r\ntrue object of all political organizations, and is essential to the\r\nprolonged existence of all those whose life and spirit are derived\r\ndirectly from the people. Every man who has dispassionately endeavored\r\nto enlighten himself in the matter cannot but see, that, for the many,\r\nthe course of things in slaveholding States is substantially what we\r\nhave described, a downward one, more or less rapid, in civilization and\r\nin all those results of material prosperity which in a free country\r\nshow themselves in the general advancement for the good of all, and\r\ngive a real meaning to the word Commonwealth. No matter how enormous\r\nthe wealth centred in the hands of a few, it has no longer the\r\nconservative force or the beneficent influence which it exerts when\r\nequably distributed,--even loses more of both where a system of\r\nabsenteeism prevails so largely as in the South. In such communities\r\nthe seeds of an \"irrepressible conflict\" are surely if slowly ripening,\r\nand signs are daily multiplying that the true peril to their social\r\norganization is looked for, less in a revolt of the owned labor than in\r\nan insurrection of intelligence in the labor that owns itself and finds\r\nitself none the richer for it. To multiply such communities is to\r\nmultiply weakness.\r\n\r\nThe election in November turns on the single and simple question,\r\nWhether we shall consent to the indefinite multiplication of them; and\r\nthe only party which stands plainly and unequivocally pledged against\r\nsuch a policy, nay, which is not either openly or impliedly in favor of\r\nit,--is the Republican party. We are of those who at first regretted\r\nthat another candidate was not nominated at Chicago; but we confess\r\nthat we have ceased to regret it, for the magnanimity of Mr. Seward\r\nsince the result of the Convention was known has been a greater\r\nornament to him and a greater honor to his party than his election to\r\nthe Presidency would have been. We should have been pleased with Mr.\r\nSeward's nomination, for the very reason we have seen assigned for\r\npassing him by,--that he represented the most advanced doctrines of his\r\nparty. He, more than any other man, combined in himself the moralist's\r\noppugnancy to Slavery as a fact, the thinker's resentment of it as a\r\ntheory, and the statist's distrust of it as a policy,--thus summing up\r\nthe three efficient causes that have chiefly aroused and concentrated\r\nthe antagonism of the Free States. Not a brilliant man, he has that\r\nbest gift of Nature, which brilliant men commonly lack, of being always\r\nable to do his best; and the very misrepresentation of his opinions\r\nwhich was resorted to in order to neutralize the effect of his speeches\r\nin the Senate and elsewhere was the best testimony to their power. Safe\r\nfrom the prevailing epidemic of Congressional eloquence as if he had\r\nbeen inoculated for it early in his career, he addresses himself to the\r\nreason, and what he says sticks. It was assumed that his nomination\r\nwould have embittered the contest and tainted the Republican creed with\r\nradicalism; but we doubt it. We cannot think that a party gains by not\r\nhitting its hardest, or by sugaring its opinions. Republicanism is not\r\na conspiracy to obtain office under false pretences. It has a definite\r\naim, an earnest purpose, and the unflinching tenacity of profound\r\nconviction. It was not called into being by a desire to reform the\r\npecuniary corruptions of the party now in power. Mr. Bell or Mr.\r\nBreckinridge would do that, for no one doubts their honor or their\r\nhonesty. It is not unanimous about the Tariff, about State-Rights,\r\nabout many other questions of policy. What unites the Republicans is a\r\ncommon faith in the early principles and practice of the Republic, a\r\ncommon persuasion that slavery, as it cannot but be the natural foe of\r\nthe one, has been the chief debaser of the other, and a common resolve\r\nto resist its encroachments everywhen and everywhere. They see no\r\nreason to fear that the Constitution, which has shown such pliant\r\ntenacity under the warps and twistings of a forty-years' pro-slavery\r\npressure, should be in danger of breaking, if bent backward again\r\ngently to its original rectitude of fibre. \"All forms of human\r\ngovernment,\" says Machiavelli, \"have, like men, their natural term, and\r\nthose only are long-lived which possess in themselves the power of\r\nreturning to the principles on which they were originally founded.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in a moral aversion to slavery as a great wrong that the chief\r\nstrength of the Republican party lies. They believe as everybody\r\nbelieved sixty years ago; and we are sorry to see what appears to be an\r\ninclination in some quarters to blink this aspect of the case, lest the\r\nparty be charged with want of conservatism, or, what is worse, with\r\nabolitionism. It is and will be charged with all kinds of dreadful\r\nthings, whatever it does, and it has nothing to fear from an upright\r\nand downright declaration of its faith. One part of the grateful work\r\nit has to do is to deliver us from the curse of perpetual concession\r\nfor the sake of a peace that never comes, and which, if it came, would\r\nnot be peace, but submission,--from that torpor and imbecility of faith\r\nin God and man which have stolen the respectable name of Conservatism.\r\nA question which cuts so deep as that which now divides the country\r\ncannot be debated, much less settled, without excitement. Such\r\nexcitement is healthy, and is a sign that the ill humors of the body\r\npolitic are coming to the surface, where they are comparatively\r\nharmless. It is the tendency of all creeds, opinions, and political\r\ndogmas that have once defined themselves in institutions to become\r\ninoperative. The vital and formative principle, which was active during\r\nthe process of crystallization into sects, or schools of thought, or\r\ngovernments, ceases to act; and what was once a living emanation of the\r\nEternal Mind, organically operative in history, becomes the dead\r\nformula on men's lips and the dry topic of the annalist. It has been\r\nour good fortune that a question has been thrust upon us which has\r\nforced us to reconsider the primal principles of government, which has\r\nappealed to conscience as well as reason, and, by bringing the theories\r\nof the Declaration of Independence to the test of experience in our\r\nthought and life and action, has realized a tradition of the memory\r\ninto a conviction of the understanding and the soul. It will not do for\r\nthe Republicans to confine themselves to the mere political argument,\r\nfor the matter then becomes one of expediency, with two defensible\r\nsides to it; they must go deeper, to the radical question of right and\r\nwrong, or they surrender the chief advantage of their position. What\r\nSpinoza says of laws is equally true of party platforms,--that those\r\nare strong which appeal to reason, but those are impregnable which\r\ncompel the assent both of reason and the common affections of mankind.\r\n\r\nNo man pretends that under the Constitution there is any possibility of\r\ninterference with the domestic relations of the individual States; no\r\nparty has ever remotely hinted at any such interference; but what the\r\nRepublicans affirm is, that in every contingency where the Constitution\r\ncan be construed in favor of freedom, it ought to be and shall be so\r\nconstrued. It is idle to talk of sectionalism, abolitionism, and\r\nhostility to the laws. The principles of liberty and humanity cannot,\r\nby virtue of their very nature, be sectional, any more than light and\r\nheat. Prevention is not abolition, and unjust laws are the only serious\r\nenemies that Law ever had. With history before us, it is no treason to\r\nquestion the infallibility of a court; for courts are never wiser or\r\nmore venerable than the men composing them, and a decision that\r\nreverses precedent cannot arrogate to itself any immunity from\r\nreversal. Truth is the only unrepealable thing.\r\n\r\nWe are gravely requested to have no opinion, or, having one, to\r\nsuppress it, on the one topic that has occupied caucuses, newspapers,\r\nPresidents' messages, and Congress for the last dozen years, lest we\r\nendanger the safety of the Union. The true danger to popular forms of\r\ngovernment begins when public opinion ceases because the people are\r\nincompetent or unwilling to think. In a democracy it is the duty of\r\nevery citizen to think; but unless the thinking result in a definite\r\nopinion, and the opinion lead to considerate action, they are nothing.\r\nIf the people are assumed to be incapable of forming a judgment for\r\nthemselves, the men whose position enables them to guide the public\r\nmind ought certainly to make good their want of intelligence. But on\r\nthis great question, the wise solution of which, we are every day\r\nassured, is essential to the permanence of the Union, Mr. Bell has no\r\nopinion at all, Mr. Douglas says it is of no consequence which opinion\r\nprevails, and Mr. Breckinridge tells us vaguely that \"all sections have\r\nan equal right in the common Territories.\" The parties which support\r\nthese candidates, however, all agree in affirming that the election of\r\nits special favorite is the one thing that can give back peace to the\r\ndistracted country. The distracted country will continue to take care\r\nof itself, as it has done hitherto, and the only question that needs an\r\nanswer is, What policy will secure the most prosperous future to the\r\nhelpless Territories, which our decision is to make or mar for all\r\ncoming time? What will save the country from a Senate and Supreme Court\r\nwhere freedom shall be forever at a disadvantage?\r\n\r\nThere is always a fallacy in the argument of the opponents of the\r\nRepublican party. They affirm that all the States and all the citizens\r\nof the States ought to have equal rights in the Territories.\r\nUndoubtedly. But the difficulty is that they cannot. The slaveholder\r\nmoves into a new Territory with his _institution_, and from that moment\r\nthe free white settler is virtually excluded. _His_ institutions he\r\ncannot take with him; they refuse to root themselves in soil that is\r\ncultivated by slave-labor. Speech is no longer free; the post-office is\r\nAustrianized; the mere fact of Northern birth may be enough to hang\r\nhim. Even now in Texas, settlers from the Free States are being driven\r\nout and murdered for pretended complicity in a plot the evidence for\r\nthe existence of which has been obtained by means without a parallel\r\nsince the trial of the Salem witches, and the stories about which are\r\nas absurd and contradictory as the confessions of Goodwife Corey.\r\nKansas was saved, it is true; but it was the experience of Kansas that\r\ndisgusted the South with Mr. Douglas's panacea of \"Squatter\r\nSovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThe claim of _equal_ rights in the Territories is a specious fallacy.\r\nConcede the demand of the slavery-extensionists, and you give up every\r\ninch of territory to slavery, to the absolute exclusion of freedom. For\r\nwhat they ask (however they may disguise it) is simply this,--that\r\ntheir _local law_ be made the law of the land, and coextensive with the\r\nlimits of the General Government. The Constitution acknowledges no\r\nunqualified or interminable right of property in the labor of another;\r\nand the plausible assertion, that \"that is property which the law makes\r\nproperty\" (confounding _a_ law existing anywhere with _the_ law which\r\nis binding everywhere), can deceive only those who have either never\r\nread the Constitution, or are ignorant of the opinions and intentions\r\nof those who framed it. It is true only of the States where slavery\r\nalready exists; and it is because the propagandists of slavery are well\r\naware of this, that they are so anxious to establish by positive\r\nenactment the seemingly moderate title to a right of existence for\r\ntheir institution in the Territories,--a title which they do not\r\npossess, and the possession of which would give them the oyster and\r\nthe Free States the shells. Laws accordingly are asked for to protect\r\nSouthern property in the Territories,--that is, to protect the\r\ninhabitants from deciding for themselves what their frame of government\r\nshall be. Such laws will be passed, and the fairest portion of our\r\nnational domain irrevocably closed to free labor, if the on-slaveholding\r\nStates fail to do their duty in the present crisis.\r\n\r\nBut will the election of Mr. Lincoln endanger the Union? It is not a\r\nlittle remarkable that, as the prospect of his success increases, the\r\nmenaces of secession grow fainter and less frequent. Mr. W. L. Yancey,\r\nto be sure, threatens to secede; but the country can get along without\r\nhim, and we wish him a prosperous career in foreign parts. But Governor\r\nWise no longer proposes to seize the Treasury at Washington,--perhaps\r\nbecause Mr. Buchanan has left so little in it. The old Mumbo-Jumbo is\r\noccasionally paraded at the North, but, however many old women may be\r\nfrightened, the pulse of the stock-market remains provokingly calm.\r\nGeneral Cushing, infringing the patent-right of the late Mr. James, the\r\nnovelist, has seen a solitary horseman on the edge of the horizon. The\r\nexegesis of the vision has been various, some thinking that it means a\r\nMilitary Despot,--though in that case the force of cavalry would seem\r\nto be inadequate,--and others the Pony Express. If it had been one\r\nrider on two horses, the application would have been more general and\r\nless obscure. In fact, the old cry of Disunion has lost its terrors, if\r\nit ever had any, at the North. The South itself seems to have become\r\nalarmed at its own scarecrow, and speakers there are beginning to\r\nassure their hearers that the election of Mr. Lincoln will do them no\r\nharm. We entirely agree with them, for it will save them from\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTo believe any organized attempt by the Republican party to disturb the\r\nexisting internal policy of the Southern States possible presupposes a\r\nmanifest absurdity. Before anything of the kind could take place, the\r\ncountry must be in a state of forcible revolution. But there is no\r\npremonitory symptom of any such convulsion, unless we except Mr.\r\nYancey, and that gentleman's throwing a solitary somerset will hardly\r\nturn the continent head over heels. The administration of Mr. Lincoln\r\nwill be conservative, because no government is ever intentionally\r\notherwise, and because power never knowingly undermines the foundation\r\non which it rests. All that the Free States demand is that influence in\r\nthe councils of the nation to which they are justly entitled by their\r\npopulation, wealth, and intelligence. That these elements of prosperity\r\nhave increased more rapidly among them than in communities otherwise\r\norganized, with greater advantages of soil, climate, and mineral\r\nproductions, is certainly no argument that they are incapable of the\r\nduties of efficient and prudent administration, however strong a one it\r\nmay be for their endeavoring to secure for the Territories the single\r\nsuperiority that has made themselves what they are. The object of the\r\nRepublican party is not the abolition of African slavery, but the utter\r\nextirpation of dogmas which are the logical sequence of attempts to\r\nestablish its righteousness and wisdom, and which would serve equally\r\nwell to justify the enslavement of every white man unable to protect\r\nhimself. They believe that slavery is a wrong morally, a mistake\r\npolitically, and a misfortune practically, wherever it exists; that it\r\nhas nullified our influence abroad and forced us to compromise with our\r\nbetter instincts at home; that it has perverted our government from its\r\nlegitimate objects, weakened the respect for the laws by making them\r\nthe tools of its purposes, and sapped the faith of men in any higher\r\npolitical morality than interest or any better statesmanship than\r\nchicane. They mean in every lawful way to hem it within its present\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nWe are persuaded that the election of Mr. Lincoln will do more than\r\nanything else to appease the excitement of the country. He has proved\r\nboth his ability and his integrity; he has had experience enough in\r\npublic affairs to make him a statesman, and not enough to make him a\r\npolitician. That he has not had more will be no objection to him in the\r\neyes of those who have seen the administration of the experienced\r\npublic functionary whose term of office is just drawing to a close. He\r\nrepresents a party who know that true policy is gradual in its\r\nadvances, that it is conditional and not absolute, that it must deal\r\nwith facts and not with sentiments, but who know also that it is wiser\r\nto stamp out evil in the spark than to wait till there is no help but\r\nin fighting fire with fire. They are the only conservative party,\r\nbecause they are the only one based on an enduring principle, the only\r\none that is not willing to pawn to-morrow for the means to gamble with\r\nto-day. They have no hostility to the South, but a determined one to\r\ndoctrines of whose ruinous tendency every day more and more convinces\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe encroachments of Slavery upon our national policy have been like\r\nthose of a glacier in a Swiss valley. Inch by inch, the huge dragon\r\nwith its glittering scales and crests of ice coils itself onward, an\r\nanachronism of summer, the relic of a by-gone world where such monsters\r\nswarmed. But it has its limit, the kindlier forces of Nature work\r\nagainst it, and the silent arrows of the sun are still, as of old,\r\nfatal to the frosty Python. Geology tells us that such enormous\r\ndevastators once covered the face of the earth, but the benignant\r\nsunlight of heaven touched them, and they faded silently, leaving no\r\ntrace, but here and there the scratches of their talons, and the gnawed\r\nboulders scattered where they made their lair. We have entire faith in\r\nthe benignant influence of Truth, the sunlight of the moral world, and\r\nbelieve that slavery, like other worn-out systems, will melt gradually\r\nbefore it. \"All the earth cries out upon Truth, and the heaven blesseth\r\nit; ill works shake and tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteous\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE PLURIBUS UNUM\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that any government--no, not the Rump Parliament on\r\nits last legs--ever showed such pitiful inadequacy as our own during\r\nthe past two months. Helpless beyond measure in all the duties of\r\npractical statesmanship, its members or their dependants have given\r\nproof of remarkable energy in the single department of peculation; and\r\nthere, not content with the slow methods of the old-fashioned\r\ndefaulter, who helped himself only to what there was, they have\r\ncontrived to steal what there was going to be, and have peculated in\r\nadvance by a kind of official post-obit. So thoroughly has the credit\r\nof the most solvent nation in the world been shaken, that an\r\nadministration which still talks of paying a hundred millions for Cuba\r\nis unable to raise a loan of five millions for the current expenses of\r\ngovernment. Nor is this the worst: the moral bankruptcy at Washington\r\nis more complete and disastrous than the financial, and for the first\r\ntime in our history the Executive is suspected of complicity in a\r\ntreasonable plot against the very life of the nation.\r\n\r\nOur material prosperity for nearly half a century has been so\r\nunparalleled that the minds of men have become gradually more and more\r\nabsorbed in matters of personal concern; and our institutions have\r\npractically worked so well and so easily that we have learned to trust\r\nin our luck, and to take the permanence of our government for granted.\r\nThe country has been divided on questions of temporary policy, and the\r\npeople have been drilled to a wonderful discipline in the manoeuvres\r\nof party tactics; but no crisis has arisen to force upon them a\r\nconsideration of the fundamental principles of our system, or to arouse\r\nin them a sense of national unity, and make them feel that patriotism\r\nwas anything more than a pleasant sentiment,--half Fourth of July and\r\nhalf Eighth of January,--a feeble reminiscence, rather than a living\r\nfact with a direct bearing on the national well-being. We have had long\r\nexperience of that unmemorable felicity which consists in having no\r\nhistory, so far as history is made up of battles, revolutions, and\r\nchanges of dynasty; but the present generation has never been called\r\nupon to learn that deepest lesson of polities which is taught by a\r\ncommon danger, throwing the people back on their national instincts,\r\nand superseding party-leaders, the peddlers of chicane, with men\r\nadequate to great occasions and dealers in destiny. Such a crisis is\r\nnow upon us; and if the virtue of the people make up for the imbecility\r\nof the Executive, as we have little doubt that it will, if the public\r\nspirit of the whole country be awakened in time by the common peril,\r\nthe present trial will leave the nation stronger than ever, and more\r\nalive to its privileges and the duties they imply. We shall have\r\nlearned what is meant by a government of laws, and that allegiance to\r\nthe sober will of the majority, concentrated in established forms and\r\ndistributed by legitimate channels, is all that renders democracy\r\npossible, is its only conservative principle, the only thing that has\r\nmade and can keep us a powerful nation instead of a brawling mob.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the best government is that which governs least seems\r\nto have been accepted literally by Mr. Buchanan, without considering\r\nthe qualifications to which all general propositions are subject. His\r\ncourse of conduct has shown up its absurdity, in cases where prompt\r\naction is required, as effectually as Buckingham turned into ridicule\r\nthe famous verse,--\r\n\r\n    \"My wound is great, because it is so small,\"\r\n\r\nby instantly adding,--\r\n\r\n    \"Then it were greater, were it none at all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan seems to have thought, that, if to govern little was to\r\ngovern well, then to do nothing was the perfection of policy. But there\r\nis a vast difference between letting well alone and allowing bad to\r\nbecome worse by a want of firmness at the outset. If Mr. Buchanan,\r\ninstead of admitting the right of secession, had declared it to be, as\r\nit plainly is, rebellion, he would not only have received the unanimous\r\nsupport of the Free States, but would have given confidence to the\r\nloyal, reclaimed the wavering, and disconcerted the plotters of treason\r\nin the South.\r\n\r\nEither we have no government at all, or else the very word implies the\r\nright, and therefore the duty, in the governing power, of protecting\r\nitself from destruction and its property from pillage. But for Mr.\r\nBuchanan's acquiescence, the doctrine of the right of secession would\r\nnever for a moment have bewildered the popular mind. It is simply\r\nmob-law under a plausible name. Such a claim might have been fairly\r\nenough urged under the old Confederation; though even then it would\r\nhave been summarily dealt with, in the case of a Tory colony, if the\r\nnecessity had arisen. But the very fact that we have a National\r\nConstitution, and legal methods for testing, preventing, or punishing\r\nany infringement of its provisions, demonstrates the absurdity of any\r\nsuch assumption of right now. When the States surrendered their power\r\nto make war, did they make the single exception of the United States,\r\nand reserve the privilege of declaring war against them at any moment?\r\nIf we are a congeries of mediaeval Italian republics, why should the\r\nGeneral Government have expended immense sums in fortifying points\r\nwhose strategic position is of continental rather than local\r\nconsequence? Florida, after having cost us nobody knows how many\r\nmillions of dollars and thousands of lives to render the holding of\r\nslaves possible to her, coolly proposes to withdraw herself from the\r\nUnion and take with her one of the keys of the Mexican Gulf, on the\r\nplea that her slave-property is rendered insecure by the Union.\r\nLouisiana, which we bought and paid for to secure the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, claims the right to make her soil French or Spanish, and\r\nto cork up the river again, whenever the whim may take her. The United\r\nStates are not a German Confederation, but a unitary and indivisible\r\nnation, with a national life to protect, a national power to maintain,\r\nand national rights to defend against any and every assailant, at all\r\nhazards. Our national existence is all that gives value to American\r\ncitizenship. Without the respect which nothing but our consolidated\r\ncharacter could inspire, we might as well be citizens of the\r\ntoy-republic of San Marino, for all the protection it would afford us.\r\nIf our claim to a national existence was worth a seven years' war to\r\nestablish, it is worth maintaining at any cost; and it is daily\r\nbecoming more apparent that the people, so soon as they find that\r\nsecession means anything serious, will not allow themselves to be\r\njuggled out of their rights, as members of one of the great powers of\r\nthe earth, by a mere quibble of Constitutional interpretation.\r\n\r\nWe have been so much accustomed to the Buncombe style of oratory, to\r\nhearing men offer the pledge of their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor\r\non the most trivial occasions, that we are apt to allow a great\r\nlatitude in such matters, and only smile to think how small an advance\r\nany intelligent pawnbroker would be likely to make on securities of\r\nthis description. The sporadic eloquence that breaks out over the\r\ncountry on the eve of election, and becomes a chronic disease in the\r\ntwo houses of Congress, has so accustomed us to dissociate words and\r\nthings, and to look upon strong language as an evidence of weak\r\npurpose, that we attach no meaning whatever to declamation. Our\r\nSouthern brethren have been especially given to these orgies of\r\nloquacity, and have so often solemnly assured us of their own courage,\r\nand of the warlike propensities, power, wealth, and general superiority\r\nof that part of the universe which is so happy as to be represented by\r\nthem, that, whatever other useful impression they have made, they\r\ninsure our never forgetting the proverb about the woman who talks of\r\nher virtue. South Carolina, in particular, if she has hitherto failed\r\nin the application of her enterprise to manufacturing purposes of a\r\nmore practical kind, has always been able to match every yard of\r\nprinted cotton from the North with a yard of printed fustian, the\r\nproduct of her own domestic industry. We have thought no harm of this,\r\nso long as no Act of Congress required the reading of the\r\n\"Congressional Globe.\" We submitted to the general dispensation of\r\nlong-windedness and short-meaningness as to any other providental\r\nvisitation, endeavoring only to hold fast our faith in the divine\r\ngovernment of the world in the midst of so much that was past\r\nunderstanding. But we lost sight of the metaphysical truth, that,\r\nthough men may fail to convince others by a never so incessant\r\nrepetition of sonorous nonsense, they nevertheless gradually persuade\r\nthemselves, and impregnate their own minds and characters with a belief\r\nin fallacies that have been uncontradicted only because not worth\r\ncontradiction. Thus our Southern politicians, by dint of continued\r\nreiteration, have persuaded themselves to accept their own flimsy\r\nassumptions for valid statistics, and at last actually believe\r\nthemselves to be the enlightened gentlemen, and the people of the Free\r\nStates the peddlers and sneaks they have so long been in the habit of\r\nfancying. They have argued themselves into a kind of vague faith that\r\nthe wealth and power of the Republic are south of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline; and the Northern people have been slow in arriving at the\r\nconclusion that treasonable talk would lead to treasonable action,\r\nbecause they could not conceive that anybody should be so foolish as to\r\nthink of rearing an independent frame of government on so visionary a\r\nbasis. Moreover, the so often recurring necessity, incident to our\r\nsystem, of obtaining a favorable verdict from the people has fostered\r\nin our public men the talents and habits of jury-lawyers at the expense\r\nof statesmanlike qualities; and the people have been so long wonted to\r\nlook upon the utterances of popular leaders as intended for immediate\r\neffect and having no reference to principles, that there is scarcely a\r\nprominent man in the country so independent in position and so clear of\r\nany suspicion of personal or party motives that they can put entire\r\nfaith in what he says, and accept him either as the leader or the\r\nexponent of their thoughts and wishes. They have hardly been able to\r\njudge with certainty from the debates in Congress whether secession\r\nwere a real danger, or only one of those political feints of which they\r\nhave had such frequent experience.\r\n\r\nEvents have been gradually convincing them that the peril was actual\r\nand near. They begin to see how unwise, if nothing worse, has been the\r\nweak policy of the Executive in allowing men to play at Revolution till\r\nthey learn to think the coarse reality as easy and pretty as the\r\nvaudeville they have been acting. They are fast coming to the\r\nconclusion that the list of grievances put forward by the secessionists\r\nis a sham and a pretence, the veil of a long-matured plot against\r\nrepublican institutions. And it is time the traitors of the South\r\nshould know that the Free States are becoming every day more united in\r\nsentiment and more earnest in resolve, and that, so soon as they are\r\nthoroughly satisfied that secession is something more than empty\r\nbluster, a public spirit will be aroused that will be content with no\r\nhalf-measures, and which no Executive, however unwilling, can resist.\r\n\r\nThe country is weary of being cheated with plays upon words. The United\r\nStates are a nation, and not a mass-meeting; theirs is a government,\r\nand not a caucus,--a government that was meant to be capable, and is\r\ncapable, of something more than the helpless _please don't_ of a\r\nvillage constable; they have executive and administrative officers that\r\nare not mere puppet-figures to go through the motions of an objectless\r\nactivity, but arms and hands that become supple to do the will of the\r\npeople so soon as that will becomes conscious and defines its purpose.\r\nIt is time that we turned up our definitions in some more trustworthy\r\ndictionary than that of avowed disunionists and their more dangerous\r\nbecause more timid and cunning accomplices. Rebellion smells no sweeter\r\nbecause it is called Secession, nor does Order lose its divine\r\nprecedence in human affairs because a knave may nickname it Coercion.\r\nSecession means chaos, and Coercion the exercise of legitimate\r\nauthority. You cannot dignify the one nor degrade the other by any\r\nverbal charlatanism. The best testimony to the virtue of coercion is\r\nthe fact that no wrongdoer ever thought well of it. The thief in jail,\r\nthe mob-leader in the hands of the police, and the murderer on the drop\r\nwill be unanimous in favor of this new heresy of the unconstitutionality\r\nof constitutions, with its Newgate Calendar of confessors, martyrs, and\r\nsaints. Falstaff's famous regiment would have volunteered to a man for\r\nits propagation or its defence. Henceforth let every unsuccessful\r\nlitigant have the right to pronounce the verdict of a jury sectional,\r\nand to quash all proceedings and retain the property in controversy by\r\nseceding from the court-room. Let the planting of hemp be made penal,\r\nbecause it squints toward coercion. Why, the first great secessionist\r\nwould doubtless have preferred to divide heaven peaceably, would have\r\nbeen willing to send commissioners, must have thought Michael's\r\nproceedings injudicious, and could probably even now demonstrate the\r\nillegality of hell-fire to any five-year-old imp of average education\r\nand intelligence. What a fine world we should have, if we could only\r\ncome quietly together in convention, and declare by unanimous\r\nresolution, or even by a two-thirds vote, that edge-tools should\r\nhereafter cut everybody's fingers but his that played with them; that,\r\nwhen two men ride on one horse, the hindmost shall always sit in front;\r\nand that, when a man tries to thrust his partner out of bed and gets\r\nkicked out himself, he shall be deemed to have established his title to\r\nan equitable division, and the bed shall be thenceforth his as of\r\nright, without detriment to the other's privilege in the floor!\r\n\r\nIf secession be a right, then the moment of its exercise is wholly\r\noptional with those possessing it. Suppose, on the eve of a war with\r\nEngland, Michigan should vote herself out of the Union and declare\r\nherself annexed to Canada, what kind of a reception would her\r\ncommissioners be likely to meet in Washington, and what scruples should\r\nwe feel about coercion? Or, to take a case precisely parallel to that\r\nof South Carolina, suppose that Utah, after getting herself admitted to\r\nthe Union, should resume her sovereignty, as it is pleasantly called,\r\nand block our path to the Pacific, under the pretence that she did not\r\nconsider her institutions safe while the other States entertained such\r\nunscriptural prejudices against her special weakness in the patriarchal\r\nline. Is the only result of our admitting a Territory on Monday to be\r\nthe giving it a right to steal itself and go out again on Tuesday? Or\r\ndo only the original thirteen States possess this precious privilege of\r\nsuicide? We shall need something like a Fugitive Slave Law for runaway\r\nrepublics, and must get a provision inserted in our treaties with\r\nforeign powers, that they shall help us catch any delinquent who may\r\ntake refuge with them, as South Carolina has been trying to do with\r\nEngland and France. It does not matter to the argument, except so far\r\nas the good taste of the proceeding is concerned, at what particular\r\ntime a State may make her territory foreign, thus opening one gate of\r\nour national defences and offering a bridge to invasion. The danger of\r\nthe thing is in her making her territory foreign under any\r\ncircumstances; and it is a danger which the government must prevent, if\r\nonly for self-preservation. Within the limits of the constitution two\r\nsovereignties cannot exist; and yet what practical odds does it make,\r\nif a State may become sovereign by simply declaring herself so? The\r\nlegitimate consequence of secession is, not that a State becomes\r\nsovereign, but that, so far as the general government is concerned, she\r\nhas outlawed herself, nullified her own existence as a State, and\r\nbecome an aggregate of riotous men who resist the execution of the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nWe are told that coercion will be civil war; and so is a mob civil war,\r\ntill it is put down. In the present case, the only coercion called for\r\nis the protection of the public property, and the collection of the\r\nfederal revenues. If it be necessary to send troops to do this, they\r\nwill not be sectional, as it is the fashion nowadays to call people who\r\ninsist on their own rights and the maintenance of the laws, but federal\r\ntroops, representing the will and power of the whole Confederacy. A\r\ndanger is always great so long as we are afraid of it; and mischief\r\nlike that now gathering head in South Carolina may soon become a\r\ndanger, if not swiftly dealt with. Mr. Buchanan seems altogether too\r\nwholesale a disciple of the _laissez-faire_ doctrine, and has allowed\r\nactivity in mischief the same immunity from interference which is true\r\npolicy only in regard to enterprise wisely and profitably directed. He\r\nhas been naturally reluctant to employ force, but has overlooked the\r\ndifference between indecision and moderation, forgetting the lesson of\r\nall experience, that firmness in the beginning saves the need of force\r\nin the end, and that forcible measures applied too late may be made to\r\nseem violent ones, and thus excite a mistaken sympathy with the\r\nsufferers by their own misdoing. The feeling of the country has been\r\nunmistakably expressed in regard to Major Anderson, and that not merely\r\nbecause he showed prudence and courage, but because he was the first\r\nman holding a position of trust who did his duty to the nation. Public\r\nsentiment unmistakably demands that, in the case of Anarchy _vs._\r\nAmerica, the cause of the defendant shall not be suffered to go by\r\ndefault. The proceedings in South Carolina, parodying the sublime\r\ninitiative of our own Revolution with a Declaration of Independence\r\nthat hangs the franchise of human nature on the kink of a hair, and\r\nsubstitutes for the visionary right of all men to the pursuit of\r\nhappiness the more practical privilege of some men to pursue their own\r\nnegro,--these proceedings would be merely ludicrous, were it not for\r\nthe danger that the men engaged in them may so far commit themselves as\r\nto find the inconsistency of a return to prudence too galling, and to\r\nprefer the safety of their pride to that of their country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Major Anderson_]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too distinctly stated or too often repeated that the\r\ndiscontent of South Carolina is not one to be allayed by any\r\nconcessions which the Free States can make with dignity or even safety.\r\nIt is something more radical and of longer standing than distrust of\r\nthe motives or probable policy of the Republican party. It is neither\r\nmore nor less than a disbelief in the very principles on which our\r\ngovernment is founded. So long as they practically retained the\r\ngovernment of the country, and could use its power and patronage to\r\ntheir own advantage, the plotters were willing to wait; but the moment\r\nthey lost that control, by the breaking up of the Democratic party, and\r\nsaw that their chance of ever regaining it was hopeless, they declared\r\nopenly the principles on which they have all along been secretly\r\nacting. Denying the constitutionality of special protection to any\r\nother species of property or branch of industry, and in 1832\r\nthreatening to break up the Union unless their theory of the\r\nConstitution in this respect were admitted, they went into the late\r\nPresidential contest with a claim for extraordinary protection to a\r\ncertain kind of property already the only one endowed with special\r\nprivileges and immunities. Defeated overwhelmingly before the people,\r\nthey now question the right of the majority to govern, except on their\r\nterms, and threaten violence in the hope of extorting from the fears of\r\nthe Free States what they failed to obtain from their conscience and\r\nsettled convictions of duty. Their quarrel is not with the Republican\r\nparty, but with the theory of Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina politicians have hitherto shown themselves adroit\r\nmanagers, shrewd in detecting and profiting by the weaknesses of men;\r\nbut their experience has not been of a kind to give them practical\r\nwisdom in that vastly more important part of government which depends\r\nfor success on common sense and business habits. The members of the\r\nSouth Carolina Convention have probably less knowledge of political\r\neconomy than any single average Northern merchant whose success depends\r\non an intimate knowledge of the laws of trade and the world-wide\r\ncontingencies of profit and loss. Such a man would tell them, as the\r\nresult of invariable experience, that the prosperity of no community\r\nwas so precarious as that of one whose very existence was dependent on\r\na single agricultural product. What divinity hedges cotton, that\r\ncompetition may not touch it,--that some disease, like that of the\r\npotato and the vine, may not bring it to beggary in a single year, and\r\ncure the overweening conceit of prosperity with the sharp medicine of\r\nIreland and Madeira? But these South Carolina economists are better at\r\nvaporing than at calculation. They will find to their cost that the\r\nfigures of statistics have little mercy for the figures of speech,\r\nwhich are so powerful in raising enthusiasm and so helpless in raising\r\nmoney. The eating of one's own words, as they must do, sooner or later,\r\nis neither agreeable nor nutritious; but it is better to do it before\r\nthere is nothing else left to eat. The secessionists are strong in\r\ndeclamation, but they are weak in the multiplication-table and the\r\nledger. They have no notion of any sort of logical connection between\r\ntreason and taxes. It is all very fine signing Declarations of\r\nIndependence, and one may thus become a kind of panic-price hero for a\r\nweek or two, even rising to the effigial martyrdom of the illustrated\r\npress; but these gentlemen seem to have forgotten that, if their\r\nprecious document should lead to anything serious, they have been\r\nsigning promises to pay for the State of South Carolina to an enormous\r\namount. It is probably far short of the truth to say that the taxes of\r\nan autonomous palmetto republic would be three times what they are now.\r\nTo speak of nothing else, there must be a military force kept\r\nconstantly on foot; and the ministers of King Cotton will find that the\r\ncharge made by a standing army on the finances of the new empire is\r\nlikely to be far more serious and damaging than can be compensated by\r\nthe glory of a great many such \"spirited charges\" as that by which\r\nColonel Pettigrew and his gallant rifles took Fort Pinckney, with its\r\ngarrison of one engineer officer and its armament of no guns. Soldiers\r\nare the most costly of all toys or tools. The outgo for the army of the\r\nPope, never amounting to ten thousand effective men, in the cheapest\r\ncountry in the world, has been half a million of dollars a month. Under\r\nthe present system, it needs no argument to show that the\r\nnon-slaveholding States, with a free population considerably more than\r\ndouble that of the slaveholding States, and with much more generally\r\ndistributed wealth and opportunities of spending, pay far more than the\r\nproportion predicable on mere preponderance in numbers of the expenses\r\nof a government supported mainly by a tariff on importations. And it is\r\nnot the burden of this difference merely that the new Cotton Republic\r\nmust assume. They will need as large, probably a larger, army and navy\r\nthan that of the present Union; as numerous a diplomatic establishment;\r\na postal system whose large yearly deficit they must bear themselves;\r\nand they must assume the main charges of the Indian Bureau. If they\r\nadopt free trade, they will alienate the Border Slave States, and even\r\nLouisiana; if a system of customs, they have cut themselves off from\r\nthe chief consumers of foreign goods. One of the calculations of the\r\nSouthern conspirators is to render the Free States tributary to their\r\nnew republic by adopting free trade and smuggling their imported goods\r\nacross the border. But this is all moonshine; for, even if smuggling\r\ncould not be prevented as easily as it now is from the British\r\nProvinces, how long would it be before the North would adapt its tariff\r\nto the new order of things? And thus thrown back upon direct taxation,\r\nhow many years would it take to open the eyes of the poorer classes of\r\nSecessia to the hardship of their position and its causes? Their\r\nignorance has been trifled with by men who cover treasonable designs\r\nwith a pretence of local patriotism. Neither they nor their misleaders\r\nhave any true conception of the people of the Free States, of those\r\n\"white slaves\" who in Massachusetts alone have a deposit in the Savings\r\nBanks whose yearly interest would pay seven times over the four hundred\r\nthousand dollars which South Carolina cannot raise.\r\n\r\nBut even if we leave other practical difficulties out of sight, what\r\nchance of stability is there for a confederacy whose very foundation is\r\nthe principle that any member of it may withdraw at the first\r\ndiscontent? If they could contrive to establish a free trade treaty\r\nwith their chief customer, England, would she consent to gratify\r\nLouisiana with an exception in favor of sugar? Some of the leaders of\r\nthe secession movement have already become aware of this difficulty,\r\nand accordingly propose the abolition of all State lines,--the first\r\nstep toward a military despotism; for, if our present system have one\r\nadvantage greater than another, it is the neutralization of numberless\r\nindividual ambitions by adequate opportunities of provincial\r\ndistinction. Even now the merits of the Napoleonic system are put\r\nforward by some of the theorists of Alabama and Mississippi, who\r\ndoubtless have as good a stomach to be emperors as ever Bottom had to a\r\nbottle of hay, when his head was temporarily transformed to the\r\nlikeness of theirs,--and who, were they subjects of the government that\r\nlooks so nice across the Atlantic, would, ere this, have been on their\r\nway to Cayenne, a spot where such red-peppery temperaments would find\r\nthemselves at home.\r\n\r\nThe absurdities with which the telegraphic column of the newspapers has\r\nbeen daily crowded, since the vagaries of South Carolina finally\r\nsettled down into unmistakable insanity, would give us but a poor\r\nopinion of the general intelligence of the country, did we not know\r\nthat they were due to the necessities of \"Our Own Correspondent.\" At\r\none time, it is Fort Sumter that is to be bombarded with floating\r\nbatteries mounted on rafts behind a rampart of cotton-bales; at\r\nanother, it is Mr. Barrett, Mayor of Washington, announcing his\r\nintention that the President-elect shall be inaugurated, or Mr.\r\nBuchanan declaring that he shall cheerfully assent to it. Indeed! and\r\nwho gave them any choice in the matter? Yesterday, it was General Scott\r\nwho would not abandon the flag which he had illustrated with the\r\ndevotion of a lifetime; to-day, it is General Harney or Commodore\r\nKearney who has concluded to be true to the country whose livery he has\r\nworn and whose bread he has eaten for half a century; to-morrow, it\r\nwill be Ensign Stebbins who has been magnanimous enough not to throw up\r\nhis commission. What are we to make of the extraordinary confusion of\r\nideas which such things indicate? In what other country would it be\r\nconsidered creditable to an officer that he merely did not turn traitor\r\nat the first opportunity? There can be no doubt of the honor both of\r\nthe army and navy, and of their loyalty to their country. They will do\r\ntheir duty, if we do ours in saving them a country to which they can be\r\nloyal.\r\n\r\nWe have been so long habituated to a kind of local independence in the\r\nmanagement of our affairs, and the central government has fortunately\r\nhad so little occasion for making itself felt at home and in the\r\ndomestic concerns of the States, that the idea of its relation to us as\r\na power, except for protection from without, has gradually become vague\r\nand alien to our ordinary habits of thought. We have so long heard the\r\nprinciple admitted, and seen it acted on with advantage to the general\r\nweal, that the people are sovereign in their own affairs, that we must\r\nrecover our presence of mind before we see the fallacy of the\r\nassumption, that the people, or a bare majority of them, in a single\r\nState, can exercise their right of sovereignty as against the will of\r\nthe nation legitimately expressed. When such a contingency arises, it\r\nis for a moment difficult to get rid of our habitual associations, and\r\nto feel that we are not a mere partnership, dissolvable whether by\r\nmutual consent or on the demand of one or more of its members, but a\r\nnation, which can never abdicate its right, and can never surrender it\r\nwhile virtue enough is left in the people to make it worth retaining.\r\nIt would seem to be the will of God that from time to time the manhood\r\nof nations, like that of individuals, should be tried by great dangers\r\nor by great opportunities. If the manhood be there, it makes the great\r\nopportunity out of the great danger; if it be not there, then the great\r\ndanger out of the great opportunity. The occasion is offered us now of\r\ntrying whether a conscious nationality and a timely concentration of\r\nthe popular will for its maintenance be possible in a democracy, or\r\nwhether it is only despotisms that are capable of the sudden and\r\nselfish energy of protecting themselves from destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party has thus far borne itself with firmness and\r\nmoderation, and the great body of the Democratic party in the Free\r\nStates is gradually being forced into an alliance with it. Let us not\r\nbe misled by any sophisms about conciliation and compromise.\r\nDiscontented citizens may be conciliated and compromised with, but\r\nnever open rebels with arms in their hands. If there be any concessions\r\nwhich justice may demand on the one hand and honor make on the other,\r\nlet us try if we can adjust them with the Border Slave States; but a\r\ngovernment has already signed its own death-warrant, when it consents\r\nto make terms with law-breakers. First re-establish the supremacy of\r\norder, and then it will be time to discuss terms; but do not call it a\r\ncompromise, when you give up your purse with a pistol at your head.\r\nThis is no time for sentimentalisms about the empty chair at the\r\nnational hearth; all the chairs would be empty soon enough, if one of\r\nthe children is to amuse itself with setting the house on fire,\r\nwhenever it can find a match. Since the election of Mr. Lincoln, not\r\none of the arguments has lost its force, not a cipher of the statistics\r\nhas been proved mistaken, on which the judgment of the people was made\r\nup. Nobody proposes, or has proposed, to interfere with any existing\r\nrights of property; the majority have not assumed to decide upon any\r\nquestion of the righteousness or policy of certain social arrangements\r\nexisting in any part of the Confederacy; they have not undertaken to\r\nconstitute themselves the conscience of their neighbors; they have\r\nsimply endeavored to do their duty to their own posterity, and to\r\nprotect them from a system which, as ample experience has shown, and\r\nthat of our present difficulty were enough to show, fosters a sense of\r\nirresponsibleness to all obligation in the governing class, and in the\r\ngoverned an ignorance and a prejudice which may be misled at any moment\r\nto the peril of the whole country.\r\n\r\nBut the present question is one altogether transcending all limits of\r\nparty and all theories of party policy. It is a question of national\r\nexistence; it is a question whether Americans shall govern America, or\r\nwhether a disappointed clique shall nullify all government now, and\r\nrender a stable government difficult hereafter; it is a question, not\r\nwhether we shall have civil war under certain contingencies, but\r\nwhether we shall prevent it under any. It is idle, and worse than idle,\r\nto talk about Central Republics that can never be formed. We want\r\nneither Central Republics nor Northern Republics, but our own Republic\r\nand that of our fathers, destined one day to gather the whole continent\r\nunder a flag that shall be the most august in the world. Having once\r\nknown what it was to be members of a grand and peaceful constellation,\r\nwe shall not believe, without further proof, that the laws of our\r\ngravitation are to be abolished, and we flung forth into chaos, a\r\nhurlyburly of jostling and splintering stars, whenever Robert Toombs or\r\nRobert Rhett, or any other Bob of the secession kite, may give a flirt\r\nof self-importance. The first and greatest benefit of government is\r\nthat it keeps the peace, that it insures every man his right, and not\r\nonly that, but the permanence of it. In order to this, its first\r\nrequisite is stability; and this once firmly settled, the greater the\r\nextent of conterminous territory that can be subjected to one system\r\nand one language and inspired by one patriotism, the better. That there\r\nshould be some diversity of interests is perhaps an advantage, since\r\nthe necessity of legislating equitably for all gives legislation its\r\nneedful safeguards of caution and largeness of view. A single empire\r\nembracing the whole world, and controlling, without extinguishing,\r\nlocal organizations and nationalities, has been not only the dream of\r\nconquerors, but the ideal of speculative philanthropists. Our own\r\ndominion is of such extent and power, that it may, so far as this\r\ncontinent is concerned, be looked upon as something like an approach to\r\nthe realization of such an ideal. But for slavery, it might have\r\nsucceeded in realizing it; and in spite of slavery, it may. One\r\nlanguage, one law, one citizenship over thousands of miles, and a\r\ngovernment on the whole so good that we seem to have forgotten what\r\ngovernment means,--these are things not to be spoken of with levity,\r\nprivileges not to be surrendered without a struggle. And yet while\r\nGermany and Italy, taught by the bloody and bitter and servile\r\nexperience of centuries, are striving toward unity as the blessing\r\nabove all others desirable, we are to allow a Union, that for almost\r\neighty years has been the source and the safeguard of incalculable\r\nadvantages, to be shattered by the caprice of a rabble that has out-run\r\nthe intention of its leaders, while we are making up our minds what\r\ncoercion means! Ask the first constable, and he will tell you that it\r\nis the force necessary for executing the laws. To avoid the danger of\r\nwhat men who have seized upon forts, arsenals, and other property of\r\nthe United States, and continue to hold them by military force, may\r\nchoose to call civil war, we are allowing a state of things to gather\r\nhead which will make real civil war the occupation of the whole country\r\nfor years to come, and establish it as a permanent institution. There\r\nis no such antipathy between the North and the South as men ambitious\r\nof a consideration in the new republic, which their talents and\r\ncharacter have failed to secure them in the old, would fain call into\r\nexistence by asserting that it exists. The misunderstanding and dislike\r\nbetween them is not so great as they were within living memory between\r\nEngland and Scotland, as they are now between England and Ireland.\r\nThere is no difference of race, language, or religion. Yet, after a\r\ndissatisfaction of near a century and two rebellions, there is no part\r\nof the British dominion more loyal than Scotland, no British subjects\r\nwho would be more loath to part with the substantial advantages of\r\ntheir imperial connection than the Scotch; and even in Ireland, after a\r\nlonger and more deadly feud, there is no sane man who would consent to\r\nsee his country irrevocably cut off from power and consideration to\r\nobtain an independence which would be nothing but Donnybrook Fair\r\nmultiplied by every city, town, and village in the island. The same\r\nconsiderations of policy and advantage which render the union of\r\nScotland and Ireland with England a necessity apply with even more\r\nforce to the several States of our Union. To let one, or two, or half a\r\ndozen of them break away in a freak of anger or unjust suspicion, or,\r\nstill worse, from mistaken notions of sectional advantage, would be to\r\nfail in our duty to ourselves and our country, would be a fatal\r\nblindness to the lessons which immemorial history has been tracing on\r\nthe earth's surface, either with the beneficent furrow of the plough,\r\nor, when that was unheeded, the fruitless gash of the cannon ball.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of coercion, we do not mean violence, but only the\r\nassertion of constituted and acknowledged authority. Even if seceding\r\nStates could be conquered back again, they would not be worth the\r\nconquest. We ask only for the assertion of a principle which shall give\r\nthe friends of order in the discontented quarters a hope to rally\r\nround, and the assurance of the support they have a right to expect.\r\nThere is probably a majority, and certainly a powerful minority, in the\r\nseceding States, who are loyal to the Union; and these should have that\r\nsupport which the prestige of the General Government can alone give\r\nthem. It is not to the North nor to the Republican party that the\r\nmalcontents are called on to submit, but to the laws and to the benign\r\nintentions of the Constitution, as they were understood by its framers.\r\nWhat the country wants is a permanent settlement; and it has learned,\r\nby repeated trial, that compromise is not a cement, but a wedge. The\r\nGovernment did not hesitate to protect the doubtful right of property\r\nof a Virginian in Anthony Burns by the exercise of coercion, and the\r\nloyalty of Massachusetts was such that her own militia could be used to\r\nenforce an obligation abhorrent, and, as there is reason to believe,\r\nmade purposely abhorrent, to her dearest convictions and most venerable\r\ntraditions; and yet the same Government tampers with armed treason, and\r\nlets _I dare not_ wait upon _I would_, when it is a question of\r\nprotecting the acknowledged property of the Union, and of sustaining,\r\nnay, preserving even, a gallant officer whose only fault is that he has\r\nbeen too true to his flag. While we write, the newspapers bring us the\r\ncorrespondence between Mr. Buchanan and the South Carolina \"Commissioners;\"\r\nand surely never did a government stoop so low as ours has done, not\r\nonly in consenting to receive these ambassadors from Nowhere, but in\r\nsuggesting that a soldier deserves court-martial who has done all he\r\ncould to maintain himself in a forlorn hope, with rebellion in his\r\nfront and treachery in his rear. Our Revolutionary heroes had\r\nold-fashioned notions about rebels, suitable to the straightforward\r\ntimes in which they lived,--times when blood was as freely shed to\r\nsecure our national existence as milk-and-water is now to destroy it.\r\nMr. Buchanan might have profited by the example of men who knew nothing\r\nof the modern arts of Constitutional interpretation, but saw clearly\r\nthe distinction between right and wrong. When a party of the Shays\r\nrebels came to the house of General Pomeroy, in Northampton, and asked\r\nif he could accommodate them,--the old soldier, seeing the green sprigs\r\nin their hats, the badges of their treason, shouted to his son, \"Fetch\r\nme my hanger, and I'll _accommodate_ the scoundrels!\" General Jackson,\r\nwe suspect, would have accommodated rebel commissioners in the same\r\nperemptory style.\r\n\r\nWhile our Government, like Giles in the old rhyme, is wondering whether\r\nit is a government or not, emissaries of treason are cunningly working\r\nupon the fears and passions of the Border States, whose true interests\r\nare infinitely more on the side of the Union than of slavery. They are\r\nluring the ambitious with visionary promises of Southern grandeur and\r\nprosperity, and deceiving the ignorant into the belief that the\r\nprinciples and practice of the Free States were truly represented by\r\nJohn Brown. All this might have been prevented, had Mr. Buchanan in his\r\nMessage thought of the interests of his country instead of those of his\r\nparty. It is not too late to check and neutralize it now. A decisively\r\nnational and patriotic policy is all that can prevent excited men from\r\ninvolving themselves so deeply that they will find \"returning as\r\ntedious as go o'er,\" and be more afraid of cowardice than of\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nSlavery is no longer the matter in debate, and we must beware of being\r\nled off upon that side-issue. The matter now in hand is the\r\nreestablishment of order, the reaffirmation of national unity, and the\r\nsettling once for all whether there can be such a thing as a government\r\nwithout the right to use its power in self-defence. The Republican\r\nparty has done all it could lawfully do in limiting slavery once more\r\nto the States in which it exists, and in relieving the Free States from\r\nforced complicity with an odious system. They can be patient, as\r\nProvidence is often patient, till natural causes work that conviction\r\nwhich conscience has been unable to effect. They believe that the\r\nviolent abolition of slavery, which would be sure to follow sooner or\r\nlater the disruption of our Confederacy, would not compensate for the\r\nevil that would be entailed upon both races by the abolition of our\r\nnationality and the bloody confusion that would follow it. More than\r\nthis, they believe that there can be no permanent settlement except in\r\nthe definite establishment of the principle, that this Government, like\r\nall others, rests upon the everlasting foundations of just\r\nAuthority,--that that authority, once delegated by the people, becomes\r\na common stock of Power to be wielded for the common protection, and\r\nfrom which no minority or majority of partners can withdraw its\r\ncontribution under any conditions,--that this power is what makes us a\r\nnation, and implies a corresponding duty of submission, or, if that be\r\nrefused, then a necessary right of self-vindication. We are citizens,\r\nwhen we make laws; we become subjects, when we attempt to break them\r\nafter they are made. Lynch-law maybe better than no law in new and\r\nhalf-organized communities, but we cannot tolerate its application in\r\nthe affairs of government. The necessity of suppressing rebellion by\r\nforce may be a terrible one, but its consequences, whatever they may\r\nbe, do not weigh a feather in comparison with those that would follow\r\nfrom admitting the principle that there is no social compact binding on\r\nany body of men too numerous to be arrested by a United States marshal.\r\n\r\nAs we are writing these sentences, the news comes to us that South\r\nCarolina has taken the initiative, and chosen the arbitrament of war.\r\nShe has done it because her position was desperate, and because she\r\nhoped thereby to unite the Cotton States by a complicity in blood, as\r\nthey are already committed by a unanimity in bravado. Major Anderson\r\ndeserves more than ever the thanks of his country for his wise\r\nforbearance. The foxes in Charleston, who have already lost their tails\r\nin the trap of Secession, wished to throw upon him the responsibility\r\nof that second blow which begins a quarrel, and the silence of his guns\r\nhas balked them. Nothing would have pleased them so much as to have one\r\nof his thirty-two-pound shot give a taste of real war to the boys who\r\nare playing soldier at Morris's Island. But he has shown the discretion\r\nof a brave man. South Carolina will soon learn how much she has\r\nundervalued the people of the Free States. Because they prefer law to\r\nbowie-knives and revolvers, she has too lightly reckoned on their\r\ncaution and timidity. She will find that, though slow to kindle, they\r\nare as slow to yield, and that they are willing to risk their lives for\r\nthe defence of law, though not for the breach of it. They are beginning\r\nto question the value of a peace that is forced on them at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, and is to be obtained only by an abandonment of rights and\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the courage and power of the Free States, we do not\r\nwish to be understood as descending to the vulgar level of meeting brag\r\nwith brag. We speak of them only as among the elements to be gravely\r\nconsidered by the fanatics who may render it necessary for those who\r\nvalue the continued existence of this Confederacy as it deserves to be\r\nvalued to kindle a back-fire, and to use the desperate means which God\r\nhas put into their hands to be employed in the last extremity of free\r\ninstitutions. And when we use the term coercion, nothing is farther\r\nfrom our thoughts than the carrying of blood and fire among those whom\r\nwe still consider our brethren of South Carolina. These civilized\r\ncommunities of ours have interests too serious to be risked on a\r\nchildish wager of courage,--a quality that can always be bought cheaper\r\nthan day-labor on a railway-embankment. We wish to see the Government\r\nstrong enough for the maintenance of law, and for the protection, if\r\nneed be, of the unfortunate Governor Pickens from the anarchy he has\r\nallowed himself to be made a tool of by evoking. Let the power of the\r\nUnion be used for any other purpose than that of shutting and barring\r\nthe door against the return of misguided men to their allegiance. At\r\nthe same time we think legitimate and responsible force prudently\r\nexerted safer than the submission, without a struggle, to unlawful and\r\nirresponsible violence.\r\n\r\nPeace is the greatest of blessings, when it is won and kept by manhood\r\nand wisdom; but it is a blessing that will not long be the housemate of\r\ncowardice. It is God alone who is powerful enough to let His authority\r\nslumber; it is only His laws that are strong enough to protect and\r\navenge themselves. Every human government is bound to make its laws so\r\nfar resemble His that they shall be uniform, certain, and\r\nunquestionable in their operation; and this it can do only by a timely\r\nshow of power, and by an appeal to that authority which is of divine\r\nright, inasmuch as its office is to maintain that order which is the\r\nsingle attribute of the Infinite Reason that we can clearly apprehend\r\nand of which we have hourly example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PICKENS-AND-STEALIN'S REBELLION\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\nHad any one ventured to prophesy on the Fourth of March that the\r\nimmediate prospect of Civil War would be hailed by the people of the\r\nFree States with a unanimous shout of enthusiasm, he would have been\r\nthought a madman. Yet the prophecy would have been verified by what we\r\nnow see and hear in every city, town, and hamlet from Maine to Kansas.\r\nWith the advantage of three months' active connivance in the cabinet of\r\nMr. Buchanan, with an empty treasury at Washington, and that reluctance\r\nto assume responsibility and to inaugurate a decided policy, the common\r\nvice of our politicians, who endeavor to divine and to follow popular\r\nsentiment rather than to lead it, it seemed as if Disunion were\r\ninevitable, and the only open question were the line of separation. So\r\nassured seemed the event that English journalists moralized gravely on\r\nthe inherent weakness of Democracy. While the leaders of the Southern\r\nRebellion did not dare to expose their treason to the risk of a popular\r\nvote in any one of the seceding States, _The Saturday Review_, one\r\nof the ablest of British journals, solemnly warned its countrymen to\r\nlearn by our example the dangers of an extended suffrage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the conduct of the people of the Free States, during all\r\nthese trying and perilous months, had proved, if it proved anything,\r\nthe essential conservatism of a population in which every grown man\r\nhas a direct interest in the stability of the national government.\r\nSo abstinent are they by habit and principle from any abnormal\r\nintervention with the machine of administration, so almost\r\nsuperstitious in adherence to constitutional forms, as to be for a\r\nmoment staggered by the claim to a _right_ of secession set up by all\r\nthe Cotton States, admitted by the Border Slave States, which had the\r\neffrontery to deliberate between their plain allegiance and their\r\nsupposed interest, and but feebly denied by the Administration then in\r\npower. The usual panacea of palaver was tried; Congress did its best to\r\nadd to the general confusion of thought; and, as if that were not\r\nenough, a Convention of Notables was called simultaneously to thresh\r\nthe straw of debate anew, and to convince thoughtful persons that men\r\ndo not grow wiser as they grow older. So in the two Congresses the\r\nnotables talked,--in the one those who ought to be shelved, in the\r\nother those who were shelved already,--while those who were too\r\nthoroughly shelved for a seat in either addressed Great Union Meetings\r\nat home. Not a man of them but had a compromise in his pocket, adhesive\r\nas Spalding's glue, warranted to stick the shattered Confederacy\r\ntogether so firmly that, if it ever broke again, it must be in a new\r\nplace, which was a great consolation. If these gentlemen gave nothing\r\nvery valuable to the people of the Free States, they were giving the\r\nSecessionists what was of inestimable value to them,--Time. The latter\r\nwent on seizing forts, navy-yards, and deposits of Federal money,\r\nerecting batteries, and raising and arming men at their leisure; above\r\nall, they acquired a prestige, and accustomed men's minds to the\r\nthought of disunion, not only as possible, but actual. They began to\r\ngrow insolent, and, while compelling absolute submission to their\r\nrebellious usurpation at home, decried any exercise of legitimate\r\nauthority on the part of the General Government as _Coercion_,--a new\r\nterm, by which it was sought to be established as a principle of\r\nconstitutional law, that it is always the Northern bull that has gored\r\nthe Southern ox.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, the Border Slave States, and especially Virginia,\r\nwere playing a part at once cowardly and selfish. They assumed the\r\nright to stand neutral between the government and rebellion, to\r\ncontract a kind of morganatic marriage with Treason, by which they\r\ncould enjoy the pleasant sin without the tedious responsibility, and to\r\nbe traitors in everything but the vulgar contingency of hemp. Doubtless\r\nthe aim of the political managers in these States was to keep the North\r\namused with schemes of arbitration, reconstruction, and whatever other\r\nfine words would serve the purpose of hiding the real issue, till the\r\nnew government of Secessia should have so far consolidated itself as to\r\nbe able to demand with some show of reason a recognition from foreign\r\npowers, and to render it politic for the United States to consent to\r\npeaceable separation. They counted on the self-interest of England and\r\nthe supineness of the North. As to the former, they were not wholly\r\nwithout justification,--for nearly all the English discussions of the\r\n\"American Crisis\" which we have seen have shown far more of the\r\nshop-keeping spirit than of interest in the maintenance of free\r\ninstitutions; but in regard to the latter they made the fatal mistake\r\nof believing our Buchanans, Cushings, and Touceys to be representative\r\nmen. They were not aware how utterly the Democratic party had divorced\r\nitself from the moral sense of the Free States, nor had they any\r\nconception of the tremendous recoil of which the long-repressed\r\nconvictions, traditions, and instincts of a people are capable.\r\n\r\nNever was a nation so in want of a leader; never was it more plain\r\nthat, without a head, the people \"bluster abroad as beasts,\" with\r\nplenty of the iron of purpose, but purpose without coherence, and with\r\nno cunning smith of circumstance to edge it with plan and helve it with\r\ndirection. What the country was waiting for showed itself in the\r\nuniversal thrill of satisfaction when Major Anderson took the\r\nextraordinary responsibility of doing his duty. But such was the\r\ngeneral uncertainty, so doubtful seemed the loyalty of the Democratic\r\nparty as represented by its spokesmen at the North, so irresolute was\r\nthe tone of many Republican leaders and journals, that a powerful and\r\nwealthy community of twenty millions of people gave a sigh of relief\r\nwhen they had been permitted to install the Chief Magistrate of their\r\nchoice in their own National Capital. Even after the inauguration of\r\nMr. Lincoln, it was confidently announced that Jefferson Davis, the\r\nBurr of the Southern conspiracy, would be in Washington before the\r\nmonth was out; and so great was the Northern despondency that the\r\nchances of such an event were seriously discussed. While the nation was\r\nfalling to pieces, there were newspapers and \"distinguished statesmen\"\r\nof the party so lately and so long in power base enough to be willing\r\nto make political capital out of the common danger, and to lose their\r\ncountry, if they could only find their profit. There was even one man\r\nfound in Massachusetts, who, measuring the moral standard of his party\r\nby his own, had the unhappy audacity to declare publicly that there\r\nwere friends enough of the South in his native State to prevent the\r\nmarch of any troops thence to sustain that Constitution to which he had\r\nsworn fealty in Heaven knows how many offices, the rewards of almost as\r\nmany turnings of his political coat. There was one journal in New York\r\nwhich had the insolence to speak of _President_ Davis and _Mister_\r\nLincoln in the same paragraph. No wonder the \"dirt-eaters\" of the\r\nCarolinas could be taught to despise a race among whom creatures might\r\nbe found to do that by choice which they themselves were driven to do\r\nby misery.\r\n\r\nThus far the Secessionists had the game all their own way, for their\r\ndice were loaded with Northern lead. They framed their sham\r\nconstitution, appointed themselves to their sham offices, issued their\r\nsham commissions, endeavored to bribe England with a sham offer of low\r\nduties and Virginia with a sham prohibition of the slave-trade,\r\nadvertised their proposals for a sham loan which was to be taken up\r\nunder intimidation, and levied real taxes on the people in the name of\r\nthe people whom they had never allowed to vote directly on their\r\nenormous swindle. With money stolen from the Government, they raised\r\ntroops whom they equipped with stolen arms, and beleaguered national\r\nfortresses with cannon stolen from national arsenals. They sent out\r\nsecret agents to Europe, they had their secret allies in the Free\r\nStates, their conventions transacted all important business in secret\r\nsession;--there was but one exception to the shrinking delicacy\r\nbecoming a maiden government, and that was the openness of the\r\nstealing. We had always thought a high sense of personal honor an\r\nessential element of chivalry; but among the _Romanic_ races, by which,\r\nas the wonderful ethnologist of _De Bow's Review_ tells us, the\r\nSouthern States where settled, and from which they derive a close\r\nentail of chivalric characteristics, to the exclusion of the vulgar\r\nSaxons of the North, such is by no means the case. For the first time\r\nin history the deliberate treachery of a general is deemed worthy of a\r\ncivic ovation, and Virginia has the honor of being the first State\r\nclaiming to be civilized that has decreed the honors of a triumph to a\r\ncabinet officer who had contrived to gild a treason that did not\r\nendanger his life with a peculation that could not further damage his\r\nreputation. Rebellion, even in a bad cause, may have its romantic side;\r\ntreason, which had not been such but for being on the losing side, may\r\nchallenge admiration; but nothing can sweeten larceny or disinfect\r\nperjury. A rebellion inaugurated with theft, and which has effected its\r\nentry into national fortresses, not over broken walls, but by breaches\r\nof trust, should take Jonathan Wild for its patron saint, with the run\r\nof Mr. Buchanan's cabinet for a choice of sponsors,--godfathers we\r\nshould not dare to call them.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's Inaugural Speech was of the kind usually called \"firm,\r\nbut conciliatory,\"--a policy doubtful in troublous times, since it\r\ncommonly argues weakness, and more than doubtful in a crisis like ours,\r\nsince it left the course which the Administration meant to take\r\nambiguous, and, while it weakened the Government by exciting the\r\ndistrust of all who wished for vigorous measures, really strengthened\r\nthe enemy by encouraging the conspirators in the Border States. There\r\nmight be a question as to whether this or that attitude were expedient\r\nfor the Republican party; there could be none as to the only safe and\r\ndignified one for the Government of the Nation. Treason was as much\r\ntreason in the beginning of March as in the middle of April; and it\r\nseems certain now, as it seemed probable to many then, that the country\r\nwould have sooner rallied to the support of the Government, if the\r\nGovernment had shown an earlier confidence in the loyalty of the\r\npeople. Though the President talked of \"repossessing\" the stolen forts,\r\narsenals, and custom-houses, yet close upon this declaration followed\r\nthe disheartening intelligence that the cabinet were discussing the\r\npropriety of evacuating not only Fort Sumter, which was of no strategic\r\nimportance, but Fort Pickens, which was the key to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand to abandon which was almost to acknowledge the independence of the\r\nRebel States. Thus far the Free States had waited with commendable\r\npatience for some symptom of vitality in the new Administration,\r\nsomething that should distinguish it from the piteous helplessness of\r\nits predecessor. But now their pride was too deeply outraged for\r\nendurance; indignant remonstrances were heard from all quarters, and\r\nthe Government seemed for the first time fairly to comprehend that it\r\nhad twenty millions of freemen at its back, and that forts might be\r\ntaken and held by honest men as well as by knaves and traitors. The\r\nnettle had been stroked long enough; it was time to try a firm grip.\r\nStill the Administration seemed inclined to temporize, so thoroughly\r\nwas it possessed by the notion of conciliating the Border States. In\r\npoint of fact, the side which those States might take in the struggle\r\nbetween Law and Anarchy was of vastly more import to them than to us.\r\nThey could bring no considerable reinforcement of money, credit, or\r\narms to the rebels; they could at best but add so many mouths to an\r\narmy whose commissariat was already dangerously embarrassed. They could\r\nnot even, except temporarily, keep the war away from the territory of\r\nthe seceding States, every one of which had a sea-door open to the\r\ninvasion of an enemy who controlled the entire navy and shipping of the\r\ncountry. The position assumed by Eastern Virginia and Maryland was of\r\nconsequence only so far as it might facilitate a sudden raid on\r\nWashington, and the policy of both these States was to amuse the\r\nGovernment by imaginary negotiations till the plans of the conspirators\r\nwere ripe. In both States men were actively recruited and enrolled to\r\nassist in attacking the capital. With them, as with the more openly\r\nrebellious States, the new theory of \"Coercion\" was ingeniously\r\narranged like a valve, yielding at the slightest impulse to the passage\r\nof forces for the subversion of legitimate authority, closing\r\nimperviously, so that no drop of power could ooze through in the\r\nopposite direction. Lord De Roos, long suspected of cheating at cards,\r\nwould never have been convicted but for the resolution of an adversary,\r\nwho, pinning his hand to the table with a fork, said to him blandly,\r\n\"My Lord, if the ace of spades is not under your Lordship's hand, why,\r\nthen, I beg your pardon!\" It seems to us that a timely treatment of\r\nGovernor Letcher in the same energetic way would have saved the\r\ndisasters of Harper's Ferry and Norfolk,--for disasters they were,\r\nthough six months of temporizing had so lowered the public sense of\r\nwhat was due to the national dignity that people were glad to see the\r\nGovernment active at length, even if only in setting fire to its own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means inclined to criticise the Administration, even if\r\nthis were the proper time for it; but we cannot help thinking that\r\nthere was great wisdom in Napoleon's recipe for saving life in dealing\r\nwith a mob,--\"First fire grape-shot _into_ them; after that, over their\r\nheads as much as you like.\" The position of Mr. Lincoln was already\r\nembarrassed when he entered upon office, by what we believe to have\r\nbeen a political blunder in the leaders of the Republican party.\r\nInstead of keeping closely to the real point, and the only point, at\r\nissue, namely, the claim of a minority to a right of rebellion when\r\ndispleased with the result of an election, the bare question of\r\nSecession, pure and simple, they allowed their party to become divided,\r\nand to waste themselves in discussing terms of compromise and\r\nguaranties of slavery which had nothing to do with the business in\r\nhand. Unless they were ready to admit that popular government was at an\r\nend, those were matters already settled by the Constitution and the\r\nlast election. Compromise was out of the question with men who had gone\r\nthrough the motions, at least, of establishing a government and\r\nelecting an anti-president. The way to insure the loyalty of the Border\r\nStates, as the event has shown, was to convince them that disloyalty\r\nwas dangerous. That revolutions never go backward is one of those\r\ncompact generalizations which the world is so ready to accept because\r\nthey save the trouble of thinking; but, however it may be with\r\nrevolutions, it is certain that rebellions most commonly go backward\r\nwith disastrous rapidity, and it was of the gravest moment, as\r\nrespected its moral influence, that Secession should not have time\r\nallowed it to assume the proportions and the dignity of revolution; in\r\nother words, of a rebellion too powerful to be crushed. The secret\r\nfriends of the secession treason in the Free States have done their\r\nbest to bewilder the public mind and to give factitious prestige to a\r\nconspiracy against free government and civilization by talking about\r\nthe _right_ of revolution, as if it were some acknowledged principle of\r\nthe Law of Nations. There is a right and sometimes a duty of rebellion,\r\nas there is also a right and sometimes a duty of hanging men for it;\r\nbut rebellion continues to be rebellion until it has accomplished its\r\nobject and secured the acknowledgment of it from the other party to the\r\nquarrel, and from the world at large. The Republican Party in the\r\nNovember elections had really effected a peaceful revolution, had\r\nemancipated the country from the tyranny of an oligarchy which had\r\nabused the functions of the Government almost from the time of its\r\nestablishment, to the advancement of their own selfish aims and\r\ninterests; and it was this legitimate change of rulers and of national\r\npolicy by constitutional means which the Secessionists intended to\r\nprevent. To put the matter in plain English, they resolved to treat the\r\npeople of the United States, in the exercise of their undoubted and\r\nlawful authority, as rebels, and resorted to their usual policy of\r\nintimidation in order to subdue them. Either this magnificent empire\r\nshould be their plantation, or it should perish. This was the view even\r\nof what were called the moderate slaveholders of the Border States; and\r\nall the so-called compromises and plans of reconstruction that were\r\nthrown into the caldron where the hell-broth of anarchy was brewing had\r\nthis extent, no more,--What terms of _submission_ would the people make\r\nwith their natural masters? Whatever other result may have come of the\r\nlong debates in Congress and elsewhere, they have at least convinced\r\nthe people of the Free States that there can be no such thing as a\r\nmoderate slaveholder,--that moderation and slavery can no more coexist\r\nthan Floyd and honesty, or Anderson and treason.\r\n\r\nWe believe, then, that conciliation was from the first impossible,--that\r\nto attempt it was unwise, because it put the party of law and loyalty\r\nin the wrong,--and that, if it was done as a mere matter of policy in\r\norder to gain time, it was a still greater mistake, because it was the\r\nrebels only who could profit by it in consolidating their organization,\r\nwhile the seeming gain of a few days or weeks was a loss to the\r\nGovernment, whose great advantage was in an administrative system\r\nthoroughly established, and, above all, in the vast power of the\r\nnational idea, a power weakened by every day's delay. This is so true\r\nthat already men began to talk of the rival governments at Montgomery\r\nand Washington, and Canadian journals to recommend a strict neutrality,\r\nas if the independence and legitimacy of the mushroom despotism of New\r\nAshantee were an acknowledged fact, and the name of the United States\r\nof America had no more authority than that of Jefferson Davis and\r\nCompany, dealers in all kinds of repudiation and anarchy. For more than\r\na month after the inauguration of President Lincoln there seemed to be\r\na kind of interregnum, during which the confusion of ideas in the\r\nBorder States as to their rights and duties as members of the \"old\"\r\nUnion, as it began to be called, became positively chaotic. Virginia,\r\nstill professing neutrality, prepared to seize the arsenal at Harper's\r\nFerry and the navy-yard at Norfolk; she would prevent the passage of\r\nthe United States' forces \"with a serried phalanx of her gallant sons,\"\r\ntwo regiments of whom stood looking on while a file of marines took\r\nseven wounded men in an engine-house for them; she would do everything\r\nbut her duty,--the gallant Ancient Pistol of a commonwealth. She\r\n\"resumed her sovereignty,\" whatever that meant; her Convention passed\r\nan ordinance of secession, concluded a league offensive and defensive\r\nwith the rebel Confederacy, appointed Jefferson Davis commander-in-chief\r\nof her land-forces and somebody else of the fleet she meant to steal at\r\nNorfolk, and then coolly referred the whole matter back to the people\r\nto vote three weeks afterwards whether they _would_ secede three weeks\r\nbefore. Wherever the doctrine of Secession has penetrated, it seems to\r\nhave obliterated every notion of law and precedent.\r\n\r\nThe country had come to the conclusion that Mr. Lincoln and his cabinet\r\nwere mainly employed in packing their trunks to leave Washington, when\r\nthe \"venerable Edward Ruffin of Virginia\" fired that first gun at Fort\r\nSumter which brought all the Free States to their feet as one man. That\r\nshot is destined to be the most memorable one ever fired on this\r\ncontinent since the Concord fowling-pieces said, \"That bridge is ours,\r\nand we mean to go across it,\" eighty-seven Aprils ago. As these began a\r\nconflict which gave us independence, so that began another which is to\r\ngive us nationality. It was certainly a great piece of good-luck for\r\nthe Government that they had a fort which it was so profitable to lose.\r\nThe people were weary of a masterly inactivity which seemed to consist\r\nmainly in submitting to be kicked. We know very well the difficulties\r\nthat surrounded the new Administration; we appreciate their reluctance\r\nto begin a war the responsibility of which was as great as its\r\nconsequences seemed doubtful; but we cannot understand how it was hoped\r\nto evade war, except by concessions vastly more disastrous than war\r\nitself. War has no evil comparable in its effect on national character\r\nto that of a craven submission to manifest wrong, the postponement of\r\nmoral to material interests. There is no prosperity so great as\r\ncourage. We do not believe that any amount of forbearance would have\r\nconciliated the South so long as they thought us pusillanimous. The\r\nonly way to retain the Border States was by showing that we had the\r\nwill and the power to do without them. The little Bopeep policy of\r\n\r\n    \"Let them alone, and they'll all come home\r\n      Wagging their tails behind them\"\r\n\r\nwas certainly tried long enough with conspirators who had shown\r\nunmistakably that they desired nothing so much as the continuance of\r\npeace, especially when it was all on one side, and who would never have\r\ngiven the Government the great advantage of being attacked in Fort\r\nSumter, had they not supposed they were dealing with men who could not\r\nbe cuffed into resistance. The lesson we have to teach them now is,\r\nthat we are thoroughly and terribly in earnest. Mr. Stephens's theories\r\nare to be put to a speedier and sterner test than he expected, and we\r\nare to prove which is stronger,--an oligarchy built _on_ men, or a\r\ncommonwealth built _of_ them. Our structure is alive in every part with\r\ndefensive and recuperative energies; woe to theirs, if that vaunted\r\ncorner-stone which they believe patient and enduring as marble should\r\nbegin to writhe with intelligent life!\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt of the issue. We believe that the strongest battalions\r\nare always on the side of God. The Southern army will be fighting for\r\nJefferson Davis, or at most for the liberty of self-misgovernment,\r\nwhile we go forth for the defence of principles which alone make\r\ngovernment august and civil society possible. It is the very life of\r\nthe nation that is at stake. There is no question here of dynasties,\r\nraces, religions, but simply whether we will consent to include in our\r\nBill of Rights--not merely as of equal validity with all other rights,\r\nwhether natural or acquired, but by its very nature transcending and\r\nabrogating them all--the Right of Anarchy. We must convince men that\r\ntreason against the ballot-box is as dangerous as treason against a\r\nthrone, and that, if they play so desperate a game, they must stake\r\ntheir lives on the hazard. The one lesson that remained for us to teach\r\nthe political theorists of the Old World was, that we are as strong to\r\nsuppress intestine disorder as foreign aggression, and we must teach it\r\ndecisively and thoroughly. The economy of war is to be tested by the\r\nvalue of the object to be gained by it. A ten years' war would be cheap\r\nthat gave us a country to be proud of, and a flag that should command\r\nthe respect of the world because it was the symbol of the enthusiastic\r\nunity of a great nation.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however slow it may have been to accept the war which\r\nMr. Buchanan's supineness left them, is acting now with all energy and\r\ndetermination. What they have a right to claim is the confidence of the\r\npeople, and that depends in good measure on the discretion of the\r\npress. Only let us have no more weakness under the plausible name of\r\nConciliation. We need not discuss the probabilities of an\r\nacknowledgment of the Confederated States by England and France; we\r\nhave only to say, \"Acknowledge them at your peril.\" But there is no\r\nchance of the recognition of the Confederacy by any foreign\r\ngovernments, so long as it is without the confidence of the brokers.\r\nThere is no question on which side the strength lies. The whole tone of\r\nthe Southern journals, so far as we are able to judge, shows the\r\ninherent folly and weakness of the secession movement. Men who feel\r\nstrong in the justice of their cause, or confident in their powers, do\r\nnot waste breath in childish boasts of their own superiority and\r\nquerulous depreciation of their antagonists. They are weak, and they\r\nknow it. And not only are they weak in comparison with the Free States,\r\nbut we believe they are without the moral support of whatever deserves\r\nthe name of public opinion at home. If not, why does their Congress, as\r\nthey call it, hold council always with closed doors, like a knot of\r\nconspirators? The first tap of the Northern drum dispelled many\r\nillusions, and we need no better proof of which ship is sinking than\r\nthat Mr. Caleb Cushing should have made such haste to come over to the\r\nold Constitution, with the stars and stripes at her mast-head.\r\n\r\nWe cannot think that the war we are entering on can end without some\r\nradical change in the system of African slavery. Whether it be doomed\r\nto a sudden extinction, or to a gradual abolition through economical\r\ncauses, this war will not leave it where it was before. As a power in\r\nthe state, its reign is already over. The fiery tongues of the\r\nbatteries in Charleston harbor accomplished in one day a conversion\r\nwhich the constancy of Garrison and the eloquence of Phillips had\r\nfailed to bring about in thirty years. And whatever other result this\r\nwar is destined to produce, it has already won for us a blessing worth\r\neverything to us as a nation in emancipating the public opinion of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN'S REPORT\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can conceive of no object capable of rousing deeper sympathy than a\r\ndefeated commander. Though the first movement of popular feeling may be\r\none of wrathful injustice, yet, when the ebb of depression has once\r\nfairly run out, and confidence begins to set back, hiding again that\r\nmuddy bed of human nature which such neap-tides are apt to lay bare,\r\nthere is a kindly instinct which leads all generous minds to seek every\r\npossible ground of extenuation, to look for excuses in misfortune\r\nrather than incapacity, and to allow personal gallantry to make up, as\r\nfar as may be, for want of military genius. There is no other kind of\r\nfailure which comes so directly home to us, none which appeals to so\r\nmany of the most deeply rooted sentiments at once. Want of success in\r\nany other shape is comparatively a personal misfortune to the man\r\nhimself who fails; but how many hopes, prides, sacrifices, and heroisms\r\nare centred in him who wields the embattled manhood of his country! An\r\narmy is too multitudinous to call forth that personal enthusiasm which\r\nis a necessity of the heart. The imagination needs a single figure\r\nwhich it can invest with all those attributes of admiration that become\r\nvague and pointless when divided among a host. Accordingly, we\r\nimpersonate in the general, not only the army he leads, but whatever\r\nqualities we are proud of in the nation itself. He becomes for the\r\nmoment the ideal of all masculine virtues, and the people are eager to\r\nlavish their admiration on him. His position gives him at a bound what\r\nother men must spend their lives in winning or vainly striving to win.\r\nIf he gain a battle, he flatters that pride of prowess which, though it\r\nmay be a fault of character in the individual man, is the noblest of\r\npassions in a people. If he lose one, we are all beaten with him, we\r\nall fall down with our Caesar, and the grief glistens in every eye, the\r\nshame burns on every cheek. Moralize as we may about the victories of\r\npeace and the superiority of the goose-quill over the sword, there is\r\nno achievement of human genius on which a country so prides itself as\r\non success in war, no disgrace over which it broods so inconsolably as\r\nmilitary disaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _General McClellan_]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more touching than the sight of a nation in search of\r\nits great man, nothing more beautiful than its readiness to accept a\r\nhero on trust. Nor is this a feeble sentimentality. It is much rather a\r\nnoble yearning of what is best in us, for it is only in these splendid\r\nfigures which now and then sum up all the higher attributes of\r\ncharacter that the multitude of men can ever hope to find their blind\r\ninstinct of excellence realized and satisfied. Not without reason are\r\nnations always symbolized as women, for there is something truly\r\nfeminine in the devotion with which they are willing to give all for\r\nand to their ideal man, and the zeal with which they drape some\r\nimprovised Agamemnon with all the outward shows of royalty from the\r\nproperty-room of imagination. This eagerness of loyalty toward\r\nfirst-rate character is one of the conditions of mastery in every\r\nsphere of human activity, for it is the stuff that genius works in.\r\nHeroes, to be sure, cannot be made to order, yet with a man of the\r\nright fibre, who has the stuff for greatness in him, the popular\r\nenthusiasm would go far toward making him in fact what he is in fancy.\r\nNo commander ever had more of this paid-up capital of fortune, this\r\nfame in advance, this success before succeeding, than General\r\nMcClellan. That dear old domestic bird, the Public, which lays the\r\ngolden eggs out of which greenbacks are hatched, was sure she had\r\nbrooded out an eagle-chick at last. How we all waited to see him stoop\r\non the dove-cote of Richmond! Never did nation give such an example of\r\nfaith and patience as while the Army of the Potomac lay during all\r\nthose weary months before Washington. Every excuse was invented, every\r\npalliation suggested, except the true one, that our chicken was no\r\neagle, after all. He was hardening his seres, he was waiting for his\r\nwings to grow, he was whetting his beak; we should see him soar at last\r\nand shake the thunder from his wings. But do what we could, hope what\r\nwe might, it became daily clearer that, whatever other excellent\r\nqualities he might have, this of being aquiline was wanting.\r\n\r\nDisguise and soften it as we may, the campaign of the Peninsula was a\r\ndisastrous failure,--a failure months long, like a bad novel in weekly\r\ninstalments, with \"To be continued\" grimly ominous at the end of every\r\npart. So far was it from ending in the capture of Richmond that nothing\r\nbut the gallantry of General Pope and his little army hindered the\r\nRebels from taking Washington. And now comes Major-General George B.\r\nMcClellan, and makes affidavit in one volume[1] octavo that he is a\r\ngreat military genius, after all. It should seem that this genius is of\r\ntwo varieties. The first finds the enemy, and beats him; the second\r\nfinds him, and succeeds in getting away. General McClellan is now\r\nattempting a change of base in the face of public opinion, and is\r\nendeavoring to escape the consequences of having escaped from the\r\nPeninsula. For a year his reputation flared upward like a rocket,\r\nculminated, burst, and now, after as long an interval, the burnt-out\r\ncase comes down to us in this Report.\r\n\r\n      [1] _Letter of the Secretary of War, transmitting Report on the\r\n      Organization of the Army of the Potomac, and of the Campaigns in\r\n      Virginia and Maryland under the Command of Major-General George\r\n      B. McClellan, from July 26, 1861, to November 7, 1862._\r\n      Washington: Government Printing-Office. 1864. 8vo, pp. 242.\r\n\r\nThere is something ludicrously tragic, as our politics are managed, in\r\nseeing an Administration compelled to print a campaign document (for\r\nsuch is General McClellan's Report in a double sense) directed against\r\nitself. Yet in the present case, had it been possible to escape the\r\npenance, it had been unwise, for we think that no unprejudiced person\r\ncan read the volume without a melancholy feeling that General McClellan\r\nhas foiled himself even more completely than the Rebels were able to\r\ndo. He should have been more careful of his communications, for a line\r\ntwo hundred and forty-two pages long is likely to have its weak points.\r\nThe volume before us is rather the plea of an advocate retained to\r\ndefend the General's professional character and expound his political\r\nopinions than the curt, colorless, unimpassioned statement of facts\r\nwhich is usually so refreshing in the official papers of military men,\r\nand has much more the air of being addressed to a jury than to the War\r\nDepartment at Washington. It is, in short, a letter to the people of\r\nthe United States, under cover to the Secretary of War. General\r\nMcClellan puts himself upon the country, and, after taking as much time\r\nto make up his mind as when he wearied and imperilled the nation in his\r\ncamp on the Potomac, endeavors to win back from public opinion the\r\nvictory which nothing but his own over-caution enabled the Rebels to\r\nsnatch from him before Richmond. He cannot give us back our lost time\r\nor our squandered legions; but how nice it would be if we would give\r\nhim back his reputation, which has never been of any great use to us,\r\nand yet would be so convenient for him! It was made for him, and\r\naccordingly fits him better than it would any one else. But it is\r\naltogether too late. There is no argument for the soldier but success,\r\nno wisdom for the man but to acknowledge defeat and be silent under it.\r\nThe Great Captain on his sofa at Longwood may demonstrate how the\r\nRussian expedition might, could, would, and should have ended\r\notherwise; but meanwhile its results are not to be reasoned with,--the\r\nBourbons are at the Tuileries, and he at St. Helena. There is hardly\r\nanything that may not be made out of history by a skilful manipulator.\r\nCharacters may be white-washed, bigotry made over into zeal, timidity\r\ninto prudence, want of conviction into toleration, obstinacy into\r\nfirmness; but the one thing that cannot be theorized out of existence,\r\nor made to look like anything else, is a lost campaign.\r\n\r\nWe have had other unsuccessful generals, but not one of them has ever\r\nbeen tempted into the indecorum of endeavoring to turn a defeat in the\r\nfield to political advantage. Not one has thought of defending himself\r\nby imputations on his superiors. Early in the war General McDowell set\r\nan example of silence under slanderous reproach that won for him the\r\nsympathy and respect of whoever could be touched by self-reliant\r\nmanliness. It is because General McClellan has seen fit to overstep the\r\nbounds of a proper official reserve, because, after more than a year\r\nfor reflection, he has repeated charges of the grossest kind against\r\nthose under whose orders he was acting, and all this from a political\r\nmotive, that we think his Report deserving of more than usual\r\nattention. It will be no fault of his if he be not put in nomination\r\nfor the Presidency, and accordingly it becomes worth our while to\r\nconsider such evidences of character and capacity as his words and\r\ndeeds afford us.\r\n\r\nWe believe that General McClellan has been ruined, like another general\r\nwhose name began with Mac, by the \"All hail hereafter\" of certain\r\npolitical witches, who took his fortunes into their keeping after his\r\ncampaign in Western Virginia. He had shown both ability and decision in\r\nhandling a small force, and he might with experience have shown similar\r\nqualities in directing the operations of a great army, had not the\r\npromise of the Presidency made him responsible to other masters than\r\nmilitary duty and unselfish patriotism. Thenceforward the soldier was\r\nlost in the politician. He thought more of the effect to be produced by\r\nhis strategy on the voters behind him than on the enemy in his front.\r\nWhat should have been his single object--the suppression of the\r\nrebellion for the sake of the country--was now divided with the desire\r\nof merely ending it by some plan that should be wholly of his own\r\ncontrivance, and should redound solely to his own credit and\r\nadvancement. He became giddy and presumptuous, and lost that sense of\r\npresent realities, so essential to a commander, in contemplating the\r\nmirage that floated the White House before his eyes. At an age\r\nconsiderably beyond that of General Bonaparte when he had triumphantly\r\nclosed his first Italian campaign, he was nick-named \"the _young_\r\nNapoleon,\" and from that time forth seems honestly to have endeavored,\r\nlike Toepffer's Albert, to resemble the ideal portrait which had been\r\ndrawn for him by those who put him forward as their stalking-horse. And\r\nit must be admitted that these last managed matters cleverly, if a\r\nlittle coarsely. They went to work deliberately to Barnumize their\r\nprospective candidate. No _prima donna_ was ever more thoroughly\r\nexploited by her Hebrew _impresario_. The papers swarmed with\r\nanecdotes, incidents, sayings. Nothing was too unimportant, and the new\r\ncommander-in-chief pulled on his boots by telegram from Maine to\r\nCalifornia, and picked his teeth by special despatch to the Associated\r\nPress. We had him warm for supper in _the very latest_ with three\r\nexclamation marks, and cold for breakfast in _last evening's\r\ntelegraphic news_ with none. Nothing but a patent pill was ever so\r\nsuddenly famous.\r\n\r\nWe are far from blaming General McClellan for all this. He probably\r\nlooked upon it as one of the inevitable discomforts of distinction in\r\nAmerica. But we think that it insensibly affected his judgment, led him\r\nto regard himself as the representative of certain opinions, rather\r\nthan as a general whose whole duty was limited to the army under his\r\ncommand, and brought him at last to a temper of mind most unfortunate\r\nfor the public interests, in which he could believe the administration\r\npersonally hostile to himself because opposed to the political\r\nprinciples of those who wished to profit by his \"availability.\" It was\r\nonly natural, too, that he should gradually come to think himself what\r\nhis partisans constantly affirmed that he was,--the sole depositary of\r\nthe country's destiny. We form our judgment of General McClellan solely\r\nfrom his own Report; we believe him to be honest in his opinions, and\r\npatriotic so far as those opinions will allow him to be; we know him to\r\nbe capable of attaching those about him in a warm personal friendship,\r\nand we reject with the contempt they deserve the imputations on his\r\ncourage and his military honor; but at the same time we consider him a\r\nman like other men, with a head liable to be turned by a fame too\r\neasily won. His great misfortune was that he began his first important\r\ncampaign with a reputation to save instead of to earn, so that he was\r\nhampered by the crowning disadvantage of age in a general without the\r\nexperience which might neutralize it. Nay, what was still worse, he had\r\ntwo reputations to keep from damage, the one as soldier, the other as\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nHe seems very early to have misapprehended the true relation in which\r\nhe stood to the government. By the operation of natural causes, as\r\npoliticians would call them, he had become heir presumptive to the\r\nchair of state, and felt called on to exert an influence on the policy\r\nof the war, or at least to express an opinion that might go upon record\r\nfor future convenience. He plunged into that Dismal Swamp of\r\nconstitutional hermeneutics, in which the wheels of government were\r\nstalled at the outbreak of our rebellion, and from which every\r\nuntrained explorer rises with a mouth too full of mud to be\r\nintelligible to Christian men. He appears to have thought it within the\r\nsphere of his duty to take charge of the statesmanship of the President\r\nno less than of the movements of the army, nor was it long before there\r\nwere unmistakable symptoms that he began to consider himself quite as\r\nmuch the chief of an opposition who could dictate terms as the military\r\nsubordinate who was to obey orders. Whatever might have been his\r\ncapacity as a soldier, this divided allegiance could not fail of\r\ndisastrous consequences to the public service, for no mistress exacts\r\nso jealously the entire devotion of her servants as war. A mind\r\ndistracted with calculations of future political contingencies was not\r\nto be relied on in the conduct of movements which above all others\r\ndemand the constant presence, the undivided energy, of all the\r\nfaculties, and the concentration of every personal interest on the one\r\nobject of immediate success. A general who is conscious that he has an\r\narmy of one hundred and fifty thousand voters at his back will be\r\nalways weakened by those personal considerations which are the worst\r\nconsequence of the elective system. General McClellan's motions were\r\nencumbered in every direction by a huge train of political baggage.\r\nThis misconception of his own position, or rather his confounding the\r\ntwo characters of possible candidate and actual general, forced the\r\ngrowth of whatever egotism was latent in his nature. He began erelong\r\nto look at everything from a personal point of view, to judge men and\r\nmeasures by their presumed relation to his own interests, and at length\r\nfairly persuaded himself that the inevitable results of his own want of\r\ninitiative were due to the hostile combination against him of Mr.\r\nLincoln, Mr. Stanton, and General Halleck. Regarding himself too much\r\nin considering the advantages of success, he regards others too little\r\nin awarding the responsibility of failure.\r\n\r\nThe intense self-consciousness of General McClellan and a certain aim\r\nat effect for ulterior and unmilitary purposes show themselves early.\r\nIn October, 1861, addressing a memorial to Mr. Cameron, then Secretary\r\nof War, he does not forget the important constituency of Buncombe. \"The\r\nunity of this nation,\" he says, \"the preservation of our institutions,\r\nare so dear to me that I have willingly sacrificed my private happiness\r\nwith the single object of doing my duty to my country. When the task is\r\naccomplished, I shall be glad to retire to the obscurity from which\r\nevents have drawn me. Whatever the determination of the government may\r\nbe, I will do the best I can with the Army of the Potomac, and will\r\nshare its fate, whatever may be the task imposed upon me.\" Not to speak\r\nof taste, the utter blindness to the true relations of things shown in\r\nsuch language is startling. What sacrifice had General McClellan made\r\nwhich had not been equally made by every one of the hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men of his army? Educated at the expense of the country, his\r\nservices were a debt due on demand. And what was the sacrifice of which\r\na soldier speaks so pathetically? To be raised from the management of a\r\nrailway to one of the most conspicuous and inspiring positions of\r\nmodern times, to an opportunity such as comes rarely to any man, and\r\nthen only as the reward of transcendent ability transcendently\r\ndisplayed! To step from a captaincy of engineers to the command in\r\nchief of a great nation on fire with angry enthusiasm, spendthrift of\r\nmen, money, devotion, to be the chosen champion of order, freedom, and\r\ncivilization,--this is indeed a sacrifice such as few men have been\r\ncalled upon to make by their native land! And of what is General\r\nMcClellan thinking when he talks of returning to obscurity? Of what are\r\nmen commonly thinking when they talk thus? The newspapers would soon\r\ngrow rich, if everybody should take to advertising what he did not\r\nwant. And, moreover, to what kind of obscurity can a successful general\r\nreturn? An obscurity made up of the gratitude and admiration of his\r\ncountrymen, a strange obscurity of glory! Nor is this the only occasion\r\non which the General speaks of his willingness to share the fate of his\r\narmy. What corporal could do less? No man thoroughly in earnest, and\r\nwith the fate of his country in his hands and no thought but of that,\r\ncould have any place in his mind for such footlight phrases as these.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan's theory from the first seems to have been that a\r\nlarge army would make a great general, though all history shows that\r\nthe genius, decision, and confidence of a leader are the most powerful\r\nreinforcement of the troops under his command, and that an able captain\r\nmakes a small army powerful by recruiting it with his own vigor and\r\nenthusiasm. From the time of his taking the command till his removal,\r\nhe was constantly asking for more men, constantly receiving them, and\r\nconstantly unable to begin anything with them after he got them. He\r\ncould not move without one hundred and fifty thousand pairs of legs,\r\nand when his force had long reached that number, the President was\r\nobliged by the overtaxed impatience of the country to pry him up from\r\nhis encampment on the Potomac with a special order. What the army\r\nreally needed was an addition of one man, and that at the head of it;\r\nfor a general, like an orator, must be moved himself before he can move\r\nothers. The larger his army, the more helpless was General McClellan.\r\nLike the magician's _famulus_, who rashly undertook to play the\r\npart of master, and who could evoke powers that he could not control,\r\nhe was swamped in his own supplies. With every reinforcement sent him\r\non the Peninsula, his estimate of the numbers opposed to him increased.\r\nHis own imagination faced him in superior numbers at every turn. Since\r\nDon Quixote's enumeration of the armies of the Emperor Alifanfaron and\r\nKing Pentapolin of the Naked Arm, there has been nothing like our\r\nGeneral's vision of the Rebel forces, with their ever-lengthening list\r\nof leaders, gathered for the defence of Richmond. His anxiety swells\r\ntheir muster-roll at last to two hundred thousand. We say his anxiety,\r\nfor no man of ordinary judgment can believe that with that number of\r\nmen the Rebel leaders would not have divided their forces, with one\r\narmy occupying General McClellan, while they attempted the capital he\r\nhad left uncovered with the other.\r\n\r\nThe first plan proposed by General McClellan covered operations\r\nextending from Virginia to Texas. With a main army of two hundred and\r\nseventy-three thousand he proposes \"not only to drive the enemy out of\r\nVirginia and occupy Richmond, but to occupy Charleston, Savannah,\r\nMontgomery, Pensacola, Mobile, and New Orleans; in other words, to move\r\ninto the heart of the enemy's country and crush the rebellion in its\r\nvery heart.\" We do not say that General McClellan's ambition to be the\r\none man who should crush the rebellion was an unworthy one, but that\r\nhis theory that this was possible, and in the way he proposed, shows\r\nhim better fitted to state the abstract problems than to apprehend the\r\ncomplex details of their solution when they lie before him as practical\r\ndifficulties. For when we consider the necessary detachments from this\r\nforce to guard his communications through an enemy's country, as he\r\nwishes the President to do, in order to justify the largeness of the\r\nforce required, we cannot help asking how soon the army for active\r\noperations would be reduced to a hundred and fifty thousand. And how\r\nlong would a general be in reaching New Orleans, if he is six months in\r\nmaking up his mind to advance with an army of that strength on the\r\ninsignificant fortifications of Manassas, manned, according to the best\r\ninformation, with forty thousand troops? At the same time General\r\nMcClellan assigns twenty thousand as a force adequate for opening the\r\nMississippi. This plan, to be sure, was soon abandoned, but it is an\r\nillustration of the want of precision and forethought which\r\ncharacterizes the mind of its author. A man so vague in his conceptions\r\nis apt to be timid in action, for the same haziness of mind may,\r\naccording to circumstances, either soften and obscure the objects of\r\nthought, or make them loom with purely fantastic exaggeration. There is\r\na vast difference between clearness of head on demand and the power of\r\nframing abstract schemes of action, beautiful in their correctness of\r\noutline and apparent simplicity. It is a perception of this truth, we\r\nbelieve, which leads practical men always to suspect plans supported by\r\nstatistics too exquisitely conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt was on precisely such a specious basis of definite misinformation\r\nthat General McClellan's next proposal for the campaign by way of the\r\nPeninsula rested,--precise facts before he sets out turning to\r\nsomething like precise no-facts when he gets there,--beautiful\r\ncompleteness of conception ending in hesitation, confusion, and\r\nfailure. Before starting, \"the roads are passable at all seasons of the\r\nyear, the country much more favorable for offensive operations than\r\nthat in front of Washington, much more level, the woods less dense, the\r\nsoil more sandy\" (p. 47). After arriving, we find \"the roads\r\nimpassable,\" \"very dense and extensive forests, the clearings being\r\nsmall and few;\" and \"the comparative flatness of the country and the\r\nalertness of the enemy, everywhere in force, rendered thorough\r\nreconnoissances slow, dangerous, and difficult\" (p. 79). General\r\nMcClellan's mental constitution would seem to be one of those, easily\r\nelated and easily depressed, that exaggerate distant advantages and\r\ndangers near at hand,--minds stronger in conception than perception,\r\nand accordingly, as such always are, wanting that faculty of swift\r\ndecision which, catching inspiration from danger, makes opportunity\r\nsuccess. Add to this a kind of adhesiveness (we can hardly call it\r\nobstinacy or pertinacity) of temper, which can make no allowance for\r\nchange of circumstances, and we think we have a tolerably clear notion\r\nof the causes of General McClellan's disasters. He can compose a good\r\ncampaign beforehand, but he cannot improvise one out of the events of\r\nthe moment, as is the wont of great generals. Occasion seldom offers\r\nher forelock twice to the grasp of the same man, and yet General\r\nMcClellan, by the admission of the Rebels themselves, had Richmond at\r\nhis mercy more than once.\r\n\r\nHe seems to attribute his misfortunes mainly to the withdrawal of\r\nGeneral McDowell's division, and its consequent failure to cooperate\r\nwith his own forces. But the fact is patent that the campaign was lost\r\nby his sitting down in front of Yorktown, and wasting a whole month in\r\na series of approaches whose scientific propriety would have delighted\r\nUncle Toby, to reduce a garrison of eight thousand men. Without that\r\ndelay, which gave the Rebels time to send Jackson into the Shenandoah\r\nvalley, General McDowell's army would have been enabled to come to his\r\nassistance. General McClellan, it is true, complains that it was not\r\nsent round by water, as he wished; but even if it had been, it could\r\nonly have been an addition of helplessness to an army already too\r\nunwieldy for its commander; for he really made the Rebel force double\r\nhis own (as he always fancied it) by never bringing more than a quarter\r\nof his army into action at once. Yet during the whole campaign he was\r\ncalling for more men, and getting them, till his force reached the\r\nhighest limit he himself had ever set. When every available man, and\r\nmore, had been sent him, he writes from Harrison's Bar to Mr. Stanton,\r\n\"To accomplish the great task of capturing Richmond and putting an end\r\nto this rebellion, reinforcements should be sent to me _rather much\r\nover than less than one hundred thousand men_.\" This letter General\r\nMcClellan has not seen fit to include in his Report. Was the government\r\nto be blamed for pouring no more water into a sieve like this?\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a great mistake on Mr. Lincoln's part to order General\r\nMcDowell off on a wild-goose chase after Jackson. The cooperation of\r\nthis force might have enabled General McClellan even then to retrieve\r\nhis campaign, and we do not in the least blame him for feeling bitterly\r\nthe disappointment of wanting it. But it seems to us that it was mainly\r\nhis own fault that there was anything to retrieve, and the true\r\noccasion to recover his lost ground was offered him after his bloody\r\nrepulse of the enemy at Malvern Hill, though he did not turn it to\r\naccount. For his retreat we think he would deserve all credit, had he\r\nnot been under the necessity of making it. It was conducted with great\r\njudgment and ability, and we do not love that partisan narrowness of\r\nmind that would grudge him the praise so fairly earned. But at the same\r\ntime it is not ungenerous to say that the obstinate valor shown by his\r\narmy under all the depression of a backward movement, while it proves\r\nhow much General McClellan had done to make it an effective force,\r\nmakes us regret all the more that he should have wanted the decision to\r\ntry its quality under the inspiration of attack. It is impossible that\r\nthe spirit of the army should not have been affected by the doubt and\r\nindecision of their general. They fought nobly, but they were always on\r\nthe defensive. Had General McClellan put them at once on the\r\naggressive, we believe his campaign would have been a triumphant one.\r\nWith truly great generals resolve is instinctive, a deduction from\r\npremises supplied by the eye, not the memory, and men find out the\r\nscience of their achievements afterwards, like the mathematical law in\r\nthe Greek column. The stiffness rather than firmness of mind, the\r\nsurrender of all spontaneous action in the strait-waistcoat of a\r\npreconceived plan, to which we have before alluded, unfitted him for\r\nthat rapid change of combinations on the great chess-board of battle\r\nwhich enabled General Rosecrans at Murfreesboro to turn defeat into\r\nvictory, an achievement without parallel in the history of the war.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan seems to have considered the President too careful of\r\nthe safety of the capital; but he should measure the value of\r\nWashington by what he himself thought of the importance of taking\r\nRichmond. That, no doubt, would be a great advantage, but the loss of a\r\nrecognized seat of government, with its diplomatic and other\r\ntraditions, would have been of vastly more fatal consequence to us than\r\nthe capture of their provisional perch in Virginia would have been to\r\nthe Rebel authorities. It would have brought foreign recognition to the\r\nRebels, and thrown Maryland certainly, and probably Kentucky, into the\r\nscale against us. So long as we held Washington, we had on our side the\r\ntwo powerful sentiments of permanence and tradition, some insensible\r\nportions of which the Rebels were winning from us with every day of\r\nrepose allowed them by General McClellan. It was a clear sense of this\r\nthat both excited and justified the impatience of the people, who saw\r\nthat the insurrection was gaining the coherence and prestige of an\r\nestablished power,--an element of much strength at home and abroad.\r\nThat this popular instinct was not at fault, we have the witness of\r\nGeneral Kirby Smith, who told Colonel Fremantle \"that McClellan might\r\nprobably have destroyed the Southern army with the greatest ease during\r\nthe first winter, and without much risk to himself, as the Southerners\r\nwere so much over-elated by their easy triumph at Manassas, and their\r\narmy had dwindled away.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said that General McClellan's volume is rather a plea in\r\nabatement of judgment than a report. It was perfectly proper that he\r\nshould endeavor to put everything in its true light, and he would be\r\nsure of the sympathy of all right-minded men in so doing; but an _ex\r\nparte_ statement at once rouses and justifies adverse criticism. He\r\nhas omitted many documents essential to the formation of a just\r\nopinion; and it is only when we have read these also, in the Report of\r\nthe Committee on the Conduct of the War, that we feel the full weight\r\nof the cumulative evidence going to show the hearty support in men and\r\nconfidence that he received from the Administration, and, when there\r\nwere no more men to be sent, and confidence began to yield before\r\nirresistible facts, the prolonged forbearance with which he was still\r\nfavored. Nothing can be kinder or more cordial than the despatches and\r\nletters both of the President and Mr. Stanton, down to the time when\r\nGeneral McClellan wrote the following sentences at the end of an\r\nofficial communication addressed to the latter: \"If I save this army\r\nnow, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you, or to any other\r\npersons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this\r\narmy.\" (28th June, 1862.) We shall seek no epithet to characterize\r\nlanguage like this. All but the most bigoted partisans will qualify it\r\nas it deserves. We have here a glaring example of that warping of good\r\nsense and good feeling which the consciousness of having a political\r\nstake at risk will produce in a gallant soldier and a courteous\r\ngentleman. Can General McClellan, after a year to grow cool in, either\r\nhimself believe, or expect any one else to believe, that the President\r\nand the Secretary of War would \"do their best to sacrifice\" an army of\r\na hundred and fifty thousand brave men, in order to lessen his possible\r\nchances as a candidate for the Presidency? It was of vastly more\r\nimportance to them than to him that he should succeed. The dignified\r\ngood temper of Mr. Lincoln's answer to this wanton insult does him\r\nhonor: \"I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed\r\nreinforcements; I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did\r\nnot send them as fast as I could. I feel any misfortune to you and your\r\narmy quite as keenly as you feel it yourself.\" Mr. Stanton could only\r\nbe silent; and whatever criticisms may be made on some traits of his\r\ncharacter, he is quite safe in leaving the rebuke of such an imputation\r\nto whoever feels that earnestness, devotion, and unflagging purpose are\r\nhigh qualities in a public officer.\r\n\r\nIf General McClellan had been as prompt in attacking the enemy as he\r\nshowed himself in this assault on his superiors, we think his campaign\r\nin the Peninsula would have ended more satisfactorily. We have no doubt\r\nthat he would conduct a siege or a defence with all the science and all\r\nthe proprieties of warfare, but we think he has proved himself\r\nsingularly wanting in the qualities which distinguish the natural\r\nleaders of men. He had every theoretic qualification, but no ardor, no\r\nleap, no inspiration. A defensive general is an earthen redoubt, not an\r\nensign to rally enthusiasm and inspire devotion. Caution will never\r\nmake an army, though it may sometimes save one. We think General\r\nMcClellan reduced the efficiency and lowered the tone of his soldiers\r\nby his six months' dose of prudence. With every day he gave the enemy,\r\nhe lessened his chances of success, and added months to the duration of\r\nthe war. He never knew how to find opportunity, much less to make it.\r\nHe was an accomplished soldier, but lacked that downright common sense\r\nwhich is only another name for genius with its coat off for actual work\r\nin hand.\r\n\r\nWere General McClellan's Report nothing more than a report, were the\r\nGeneral himself nothing more than an officer endeavoring to palliate a\r\nfailure, we should not have felt called on to notice his plea, unless\r\nto add publicity to any new facts he might be able to bring forward.\r\nBut the Report is a political manifesto, and not only that, but an\r\nattack on the administration which appointed him to the command,\r\nsupported him with all its resources, and whose only fault it was not\r\nsooner to discover his incapacity to conduct aggressive movements.\r\nGeneral McClellan is a candidate for the Presidency, and as he has had\r\nno opportunity to show his capacity in any civil function, his claim\r\nmust rest on one of two grounds,--either the ability he has shown as a\r\ngeneral, or the specific principles of policy he is supposed to\r\nrepresent. Whatever may be the success of our operations in the field,\r\nour Chief Magistracy for the next four years will demand a person of\r\ngreat experience and ability. Questions cannot fail to arise taxing\r\nprudence of the longest forecast and decision of the firmest quality.\r\nHow far is General McClellan likely to fulfill these conditions? What\r\nare the qualities of mind of which both his career and his Report give\r\nthe most irrefragable evidence?\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan's mind seems to be equally incapable of appreciating\r\nthe value of time as the material of action, and its power in changing\r\nthe relations of facts, and thus modifying the basis of opinion. He is\r\na good maker of almanacs, but no good judge of the weather. Judging by\r\nthe political counsel which he more than once felt called upon to offer\r\nthe President, and which, as he has included it in his Report, we must\r\npresume to represent his present opinions, he does not seem even yet to\r\nappreciate the fact that this is not a war between two nations, but an\r\nattempt at revolution within ourselves, which can be adequately met\r\nonly by revolutionary measures. And yet, if he were at this moment\r\nelevated to the conduct of our affairs, he would find himself\r\ncontrolled by the same necessities which have guided Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nmust either adopt his measures, or submit to a peace dictated by the\r\nSouth. No side issue as to how the war shall be conducted is any longer\r\npossible. The naked question is one of war or submission, for\r\ncompromise means surrender; and if the choice be war, we cannot afford\r\nto give the enemy fifty in the game, by standing upon scruples which he\r\nwould be the last to appreciate or to act upon. It is one of the most\r\nterrible features of war that it must be inexorable by its very nature.\r\n\r\nGreat statesmanship and great generalship have been more than once\r\nshown by the same man, and, naturally enough, because they both result\r\nfrom the same qualities of mind, an instant apprehension of the demand\r\nof the moment, and a self-confidence that can as instantly meet it, so\r\nthat every energy of the man is gathered to one intense focus. It is\r\nthe faculty of being a present man, instead of a prospective one; of\r\nbeing ready, instead of getting ready. Though we think great injustice\r\nhas been done by the public to General McClellan's really high merits\r\nas an officer, yet it seems to us that those very merits show precisely\r\nthe character of intellect to unfit him for the task just now demanded\r\nof a statesman. His capacity for organization may be conspicuous; but,\r\nbe it what it may, it is one thing to bring order out of the confusion\r\nof mere inexperience, and quite another to retrieve it from a chaos of\r\nelements mutually hostile, which is the problem sure to present itself\r\nto the next administration. This will constantly require precisely that\r\njudgment on the nail, and not to be drawn for at three days' sight, of\r\nwhich General McClellan has shown least.\r\n\r\nIs our path to be so smooth for the next four years that a man whose\r\nleading characteristic is an exaggeration of difficulties is likely to\r\nbe our surest guide? If the war is still to be carried on,--and surely\r\nthe nation has shown no symptoms of slackening in its purpose,--what\r\nmodifications of it would General McClellan introduce? The only\r\ninformation that is vouchsafed us is, that he is to be the\r\n\"conservative\" candidate, a phrase that may mean too little or too\r\nmuch. As well as we can understand it, it is the convenient formula by\r\nwhich to express the average want of opinions of all who are out of\r\nplace, out of humor, or dislike the dust which blinds and chokes\r\nwhoever is behind the times. Sometimes it is used as the rallying-cry\r\nof an amiable class of men, who still believe, in a vague sort of way,\r\nthat the rebels can be conciliated by offering them a ruler more\r\n_comme il faut_ than Mr. Lincoln, a country where a flatboat-man\r\nmay rise to the top, by virtue of mere manhood, being hardly the place\r\nfor people of truly refined sensibilities. Or does it really mean\r\nnothing more nor less than that we are to try to put slavery back again\r\nwhere it was before (only that it is not quite convenient just now to\r\nsay so), on the theory that teleologically the pot of ointment was made\r\nto conserve the dead fly?\r\n\r\nIn the providence of God the first thoughtless enthusiasm of the nation\r\nhas settled to deep purpose, their anger has been purified by trial\r\ninto a conviction of duty, and they are face to face with one of those\r\nrare occasions where duty and advantage are identical. The man who is\r\nfit for the office of President in these times should be one who knows\r\nhow to advance, an art which General McClellan has never learned. He\r\nmust be one who comprehends that three years of war have made vast\r\nchanges in the relative values of things. He must be one who feels to\r\nthe very marrow of his bones that this is a war, not to conserve the\r\nforms, but the essence, of free institutions. He must be willing to\r\nsacrifice everything to the single consideration of success, because\r\nsuccess means truth and honor; to use every means, though they may\r\nalarm the fears of men who are loyal with a reservation, or shock the\r\nprejudices of would-be traitors. No middle course is safe in troubled\r\ntimes, and the only way to escape the dangers of revolution is by\r\ndirecting its forces and giving it useful work to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REBELLION: ITS CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the popular theory that nothing is so fallacious as\r\ncircumstantial evidence, there is no man of observation who would not\r\ndeem it more trustworthy than any human testimony, however honest,\r\nwhich was made up from personal recollection. The actors in great\r\naffairs are seldom to be depended on as witnesses, either to the order\r\nof events or their bearing upon results; for even where selfish\r\ninterest is not to be taken into account, the mythic instinct erelong\r\nbegins to shape things as they ought to have been, rather than as they\r\nwere. This is true even of subjects in which we have no personal\r\ninterest, and not only do no two men describe the same street-scene in\r\nthe same way, but the same man, unless prosaic to a degree below the\r\nfreezing-point of Tupper, will never do it twice in the same way. Few\r\nmen, looking into their old diaries, but are astonished at the\r\ncontrast, sometimes even the absolute unlikeness, between the matters\r\nof fact recorded there and their own recollection of them. Shortly\r\nafter the battle of Lexington it was the interest of the Colonies to\r\nmake the British troops not only wanton, but unresisted, aggressors;\r\nand if primitive Christians could be manufactured by affidavit, so\r\nlarge a body of them ready to turn the other cheek also was never\r\ngathered as in the minute-men before the meeting-house on the 19th of\r\nApril, 1775. The Anglo-Saxon could not fight comfortably without the\r\nlaw on his side. But later, when the battle became a matter of local\r\npride, the muskets that had been fired at the Redcoats under Pitcairn\r\nalmost rivalled in number the pieces of furniture that came over in the\r\nMayflower. Indeed, whoever has talked much with Revolutionary\r\npensioners knows that those honored veterans were no less remarkable\r\nfor imagination than for patriotism. It should seem that there is,\r\nperhaps, nothing on which so little reliance is to be placed as facts,\r\nespecially when related by one who saw them. It is no slight help to\r\nour charity to recollect that, in disputable matters, every man sees\r\naccording to his prejudices, and is stone-blind to whatever he did not\r\nexpect or did not mean to see. Even where no personal bias can be\r\nsuspected, contemporary and popular evidence is to be taken with great\r\ncaution, so exceedingly careless are men as to exact truth, and such\r\npoor observers, for the most part, of what goes on under their eyes.\r\nThe ballad which was hawked about the streets at the execution of\r\nCaptain Kidd, and which was still to be bought at street-stalls within\r\na few years, affirms three times in a single stanza that the pirate's\r\nname was Robert. Yet he was commissioned, indicted, convicted, and\r\nhanged as William Kidd. Nor was he, as is generally supposed, convicted\r\nof piracy, but of murder. The marvels of Spiritualism are supernatural\r\nto the average observer, who is willing to pay for that dulness from\r\nanother world which he might have for nothing in this, while they seem\r\nmere legerdemain, and not of the highest quality, to the trained organs\r\nof scientific men.\r\n\r\nHistory, we are told, is philosophy teaching by example. But how if the\r\nexample does not apply? Le Verrier discovers Neptune when, according to\r\nhis own calculations, the planet should not have been in the place\r\nwhere his telescope found it. Does the example redound to the credit of\r\nluck or of mathematics? The historian may give a thoroughly false view\r\nof an event by simply assuming that _after_ means _in consequence of_,\r\nor even by the felicitous turn of a sentence. Style will find readers\r\nand shape convictions, while mere truth only gathers dust on the shelf.\r\nThe memory first, and by degrees the judgment, is enslaved by the\r\nepigrams of Tacitus or Michelet. Our conception of scenes and men is\r\noutlined and colored for us by the pictorial imagination of Carlyle.\r\nIndeed, after reading history, one can only turn round, with Montaigne,\r\nand say, _What know I?_ There was a time when the reputation of Judas\r\nmight have been thought past mending, but a German has whitewashed him\r\nas thoroughly as Malone did Shakespeare's bust, and an English poet\r\nmade him the hero of a tragedy, as the one among the disciples who\r\nbelieved too much. Call no one happy till he is dead? Rather call no\r\none safe, whether in good repute or evil, after he has been dead long\r\nenough to have his effigy done in historical wax-work. Only get the\r\nreal clothes, that is, only be careful to envelop him in a sufficiently\r\nprobable dressing of facts, and the public will be entirely satisfied.\r\nWhat's Hecuba to us, or we to Hecuba? Or is Thackeray's way any nearer\r\nthe truth, who strips Louis the Great of all his stage-properties, and\r\nshows him to us the miserable forked radish of decrepitude?\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of writing what is called history. The earliest and\r\nsimplest was to record in the form of annals, without investigating,\r\nwhatever the writer could lay hold of, the only thread of connection\r\nbeing the order of time, so that events have no more relation to each\r\nother than so many beads on a string. Higher then this, because more\r\npicturesque, and because living men take the place of mere names, are\r\nthe better class of chronicles, like Froissart's, in which the scenes\r\nsometimes have the minute vividness of illumination, and the page seems\r\nto take life and motion as we read. The annalist still survives, a kind\r\nof literary dodo, in the \"standard\" historian, respectable,\r\nimmitigable,--with his philosophy of history, and his stereotyped\r\nphrase, his one Amurath succeeding another, so very dead, so unlike\r\nanything but historical characters, that we can scarce believe they\r\never lived,--and only differing from his ancient congener of the\r\nmonastery by his skill in making ten words do the duty of one. His are\r\nthe fatal books without which no gentleman's library can be complete;\r\nhis the storied pages which ingenuous youth is invited to turn, and is\r\napt to turn four or five together. With him something is still always\r\nsure to transpire in the course of these negotiations, still the\r\ntraditional door is opened to the inroad of democratic innovation,\r\nstill it is impossible to interpret the motives which inspired the\r\nconduct of so-and-so in this particular emergency. So little does he\r\nhimself conceive of any possible past or future life in his characters\r\nthat he periphrases death into a disappearance from the page of\r\nhistory, as if they were bodiless and soulless creatures of pen and\r\nink; mere names, not things. Picturesqueness he sternly avoids as the\r\nDelilah of the philosophic mind, liveliness as a snare of the careless\r\ninvestigator; and so, stopping both ears, he slips safely by those\r\nSirens, keeping safe that sobriety of style which his fellow-men call\r\nby another name. Unhappy books, which we know by heart before we read\r\nthem, and which a mysterious superstition yet compels many unoffending\r\npersons to read! What has not the benevolent reader had to suffer at\r\nthe hands of the so-called impartial historian, who, wholly\r\ndisinterested and disinteresting, writes with as mechanic an industry\r\nand as little emotion as he would have brought to the weaving of calico\r\nor the digging of potatoes, under other circumstances! Far truer, at\r\nleast to nature and to some conceivable theory of an immortal soul in\r\nman, is the method of the poet, who makes his personages luminous from\r\nwithin by an instinctive sympathy with human motives of action, and a\r\nconception of the essential unity of character through every change of\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nOf late years men have begun to question the prescriptive right of this\r\n\"great gyant Asdryasdust, who has choked many men,\" to choke them also\r\nbecause he had worked his wicked will on their fathers. It occurred to\r\nan inquiring mind here and there that if the representation of men's\r\naction and passion on the theatre could be made interesting, there was\r\nno good reason why the great drama of history should be dull as a\r\nmiracle-play. Need philosophy teaching by example be so tiresome that\r\nthe pupils would rather burst in ignorance than go within earshot of\r\nthe pedagogue? Hence the historical romance, sometimes honestly called\r\nso, and limited by custom in number of volumes; sometimes not called\r\nso, and without any such limitation. This latter variety admits several\r\nstyles of treatment. Sometimes a special epoch is chosen, where one\r\nheroic figure may serve as a centre round which events and subordinate\r\ncharacters group themselves, with no more sacrifice of truth than is\r\nabsolutely demanded by artistic keeping. This may be called the epic\r\nstyle, of which Carlyle is the acknowledged master. Sometimes a period\r\nis selected, where the facts, by coloring and arrangement, may be made\r\nto support the views of a party, and history becomes a political\r\npamphlet indefinitely prolonged. Here point is the one thing\r\nneedful,--to be attained at all hazards, whether by the turn of a\r\nsentence or the twisting of a motive. Macaulay is preeminent in this\r\nkind, and woe to the party or the man that comes between him and his\r\nepigrammatic necessity! Again, there is the new light, or perhaps, more\r\nproperly, the forlorn-hope method, where the author accepts a brief\r\nagainst the _advocatus diaboli_, and strives to win a reverse of\r\njudgment, as Mr. Froude has done in the case of Henry VIII. The latest\r\nfashion of all is the _a priori_, in which a certain dominant principle\r\nis taken for granted, and everything is deduced from _x_, instead of\r\nserving to prove what _x_ may really be. The weakness of this heroic\r\ntreatment, it seems to us, is in allowing too little to human nature as\r\nan element in the problem. This would be a fine world, if facts would\r\nonly be as subservient to theory in real life as in the author's\r\ninkstand. Mr. Buckle stands at the head of this school, and has just\r\nfound a worthy disciple in M. Taine, who, in his _Histoire de la\r\nLitterature Anglaise_, having first assumed certain ethnological\r\npostulates, seems rather to shape the character of the literature to\r\nthe race than to illustrate that of the race by the literature.\r\n\r\nIn short, whether we consider the incompetence of men in general as\r\nobservers, their carelessness about things at the moment indifferent,\r\nbut which may become of consequence hereafter (as, for example, in the\r\ndating of letters), their want of impartiality, both in seeing and\r\nstating occurrences and in tracing or attributing motives, it is plain\r\nthat history is not to be depended on in any absolute sense. That\r\nsmooth and indifferent quality of mind, without a flaw of prejudice or\r\na blur of theory, which can reflect passing events as they truly are,\r\nis as rare, if not so precious, as that artistic sense which can hold\r\nthe mirror up to nature. The fact that there is so little historical or\r\npolitical prescience, that no man of experience ventures to prophesy,\r\nis enough to prove, either that it is impossible to know all the terms\r\nof our problem, or that history does not repeat itself with anything\r\nlike the exactness of coincidence which is so pleasing to the\r\nimagination. Six months _after_ the _coup d'etat_ of December, 1851,\r\nMr. Savage Landor, who knew him well, said to us that Louis Napoleon\r\nhad ten times the political sagacity of his uncle; but who foresaw or\r\nforetold an Augustus in the dull-eyed frequenter of Lady Blessington's,\r\nthe melodramatic hero of Strasburg and Bologne, with his cocked hat and\r\nhis eagle from Astley's? What insurance company would have taken the\r\nrisk of his hare-brained adventure? Coleridge used to take credit to\r\nhimself for certain lucky vaticinations, but his memory was always\r\ninexact, his confounding of what he did and what he thought he meant to\r\ndo always to be suspected, and his prophecies, when examined, are\r\nhardly more precise than an ancient oracle or a couplet of Nostradamus.\r\nThe almanac-makers took the wisest course, stretching through a whole\r\nmonth their \"about this time expect a change of weather.\"\r\n\r\nThat history repeats itself has become a kind of truism, but of as\r\nlittle practical value in helping us to form our opinions as other\r\nsimilar labor-saving expedients to escape thought. Sceptical minds see\r\nin human affairs a regular oscillation, hopeful ones a continual\r\nprogress, and both can support their creeds with abundance of pertinent\r\nexample. Both seem to admit a law of recurrence, but the former make it\r\nact in a circle, the latter in a spiral. There is, no doubt, one\r\nconstant element in the reckoning, namely, human nature, and perhaps\r\nanother in human nature itself,--the tendency to reaction from all\r\nextremes; but the way in which these shall operate, and the force they\r\nshall exert, are dependent on a multitude of new and impredicable\r\ncircumstances. Coincidences there certainly are, but our records are\r\nhardly yet long enough to furnish the basis for secure induction. Such\r\nparallelisms are merely curious, and entertain the fancy rather than\r\nsupply precedent for the judgment. When Tacitus tells us that\r\ngladiators have not so much stomach for fighting as soldiers, we\r\nremember our own roughs and shoulder-hitters at the beginning of the\r\nwar, and are inclined to think that Macer and Billy Wilson illustrated\r\na general truth. But, unfortunately, Octavius found prize-fighters of\r\nanother metal, not to speak of Spartacus. Perhaps the objections to our\r\nmaking use of colored soldiers (_hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane,\r\ncaveto_) will seem as absurd one of these days as the outcry that Caesar\r\nwas degrading the service by enlisting Gauls; but we will not hazard a\r\nprophecy. In the alarm of the Pannonian revolt, his nephew recruited\r\nthe army of Italy by a conscription of slaves, who thereby became free,\r\nand this measure seems to have been acquiesced in by the unwarlike\r\ncitizens, who preferred that the experiment of death should be made _in\r\ncorpore vili_ rather than in their own persons.\r\n\r\nIf the analogies between past and present were as precise as they are\r\nsometimes represented to be, if Time really dotes and repeats his old\r\nstories, then ought students of history to be the best statesmen. Yet,\r\nwith Guizot for an adviser, Louis Philippe, himself the eyewitness of\r\ntwo revolutions, became the easy victim of a third. Reasoning from what\r\nhas been to what will be is apt to be paralogistic at the best. Much\r\ninfluence must still be left to chance, much accounted for by what\r\npagans called Fate, and we Providence. We can only say, _Victrix\r\ncausa diis placuit_, and Cato must make the best of it. What is\r\ncalled poetical justice, that is, an exact subservience of human\r\nfortunes to moral laws, so that the actual becomes the liege vassal of\r\nthe ideal, is so seldom seen in the events of real life that even the\r\ngentile world felt the need of a future state of rewards and\r\npunishments to make the scale of Divine justice even, and satisfy the\r\ncravings of the soul. Our sense of right, or of what we believe to be\r\nright, is so pleased with an example of retribution that a single\r\ninstance is allowed to outweigh the many in which wrong escapes\r\nunwhipped. It was remarked that sudden death overtook the purchasers of\r\ncertain property bequeathed for pious uses in England, and sequestered\r\nat the Reformation. Fuller tells of a Sir Miles Pateridge, who threw\r\ndice with the king for Jesus' bells, and how \"the ropes after catched\r\nabout his neck,\" he being hanged in the reign of Edward VI. But at\r\nleast a fifth of the land in England was held by suppressed\r\nmonasteries, and the metal for the victorious cannon of revolutionary\r\nFrance once called to the service of the Prince of Peace from\r\nconsecrated spires. We err in looking for a visible and material\r\npenalty, as if God imposed a fine of mishap for the breach of his\r\nstatutes. Seldom, says Horace, has penalty lost the scent of crime,\r\nyet, on second thought, he makes the sleuth-hound lame. Slow seems the\r\nsword of Divine justice, adds Dante, to him who longs to see it smite.\r\nThe cry of all generations has been, \"How long, O Lord?\" Where crime\r\nhas its root in weakness of character, that same weakness is likely to\r\nplay the avenger; but where it springs from that indifference as to\r\nmeans and that contempt of consequences which are likely to be felt by\r\na strong nature, intent upon its end, it would be hardy to reckon on\r\nthe same dramatic result. And if we find this difficulty in the cases\r\nof individual men, it is even more rash to personify nations, and deal\r\nout to them our little vials of Divine retribution, as if we were the\r\ngeneral dispensaries of doom. Shall we lay to a nation the sins of a\r\nline of despots whom it cannot shake off? If we accept too blindly the\r\ntheory of national responsibility, we ought, by parity of reason, to\r\nadmit success as a valid proof of right. The moralists of fifty years\r\nago, who saw the democratic orgies of France punished with Napoleon,\r\nwhose own crimes brought him in turn to the rock of Prometheus, how\r\nwould they explain the phenomenon of Napoleon III.? The readiness to\r\ntrace a too close and consequent relation between public delinquencies\r\nand temporal judgments seems to us a superstition holding over from the\r\ntime when each race, each family even, had its private and tutelary\r\ndivinity,--a mere refinement of fetichism. The world has too often seen\r\n\"captive good attending captain ill\" to believe in a providence that\r\nsets man-traps and spring-guns for the trespassers on its domain, and\r\nChristianity, perhaps, elevated man in no way so much as in making\r\nevery one personally, not gregariously, answerable for his doings or\r\nnot-doings, and thus inventing conscience, as we understand its\r\nmeaning. But just in proportion as the private citizen is enlightened\r\ndoes he become capable of an influence on that manifold result of\r\nthought, sentiment, reason, impulse, magnanimity, and meanness which,\r\nas Public Opinion, has now so great a share in shaping the destiny of\r\nnations. And in this sense does he become responsible, and out of the\r\naggregate of such individual responsibilities we can assume a common\r\ncomplicity in the guilt of common wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nBut surely the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth; and though we do not\r\nbelieve in his so immediate interference in events as would satisfy our\r\nimpatience of injustice, yet he achieves his ends and brings about his\r\ncompensations by having made Good infinitely and eternally lovely to\r\nthe soul of man, while the beauty of Evil is but a brief cheat, which\r\ntheir own lusts put upon the senses of her victims. And it is surely\r\nfixed as the foundations of the earth that faithfulness to right and\r\nduty, self-sacrifice, loyalty to that service whose visible reward is\r\noften but suffering and baffled hope, draw strength and succor from\r\nexhaustless springs far up in those Delectable Mountains of trial which\r\nthe All-knowing has set between us and the achievement of every noble\r\npurpose. History teaches, at least, that wrong can reckon on no\r\nalliance with the diviner part of man, while every high example of\r\nvirtue, though it led to the stake or the scaffold, becomes a part of\r\nthe reserved force of humanity, and from generation to generation\r\nsummons kindred natures to the standard of righteousness as with the\r\nsound of a trumpet. There is no such reinforcement as faith in God, and\r\nthat faith is impossible till we have squared our policy and conduct\r\nwith our highest instincts. In the loom of time, though the woof be\r\ndivinely foreordained, yet man supplies the weft, and the figures of\r\nthe endless web are shaped and colored by our own wisdom or folly. Let\r\nno nation think itself safe in being merely right, unless its captains\r\nare inspired and sustained by a sense thereof.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that history supplies any trustworthy data for\r\ncasting the horoscope of our war. America is something without\r\nprecedent Moreover, such changes have been going on in the social and\r\nmoral condition of nations as to make the lessons of even comparatively\r\nrecent times of little import in forming conclusions on contemporary\r\naffairs. Formerly a fact, not yet forgetful of its etymology, was a\r\nthing done, a deed, and in a certain sense implied, truly enough, the\r\npredominance of individual actors and prevailing characters. But\r\npowerful personalities are becoming of less and less account, when\r\nfacility of communication has given both force and the means of\r\nexerting it to the sentiment of civilized mankind, and when commerce\r\nhas made the banker's strong-box a true temple of Janus, the shutting\r\nor opening of which means peace or war. Battles are decisive now not so\r\nmuch by the destruction of armies as by the defeat of public spirit,\r\nand a something that has actually happened may be a less important\r\nfact, either in conjecturing probabilities or determining policy, than\r\nthe indefinable progress of change, not marked on any dial, but\r\ninstinctively divined, that is taking place in the general thought.\r\n\r\nThe history of no civil war can be written without bias, scarcely\r\nwithout passionate prejudice. It is always hard for men to conceive the\r\nhonesty or intelligence of those who hold other opinions, or indeed to\r\nallow them the _right_ to think for themselves; but in troubled\r\ntimes the blood mounts to the head, and colors the judgment, giving to\r\nsuspicions and fancies the force of realities, and intensifying\r\npersonal predilections, till they seem the pith and substance of\r\nnational duties. Even where the office of historian is assumed in the\r\nfairest temper, it is impossible that the narrative of events whose\r\nbearing is so momentous should not insensibly take somewhat the form of\r\nan argument,--that the political sympathies of the author should not\r\naffect his judgment of men and measures. And in such conflicts, far\r\nmore than in ordinary times, as the stake at issue is more absorbing\r\nand appeals more directly to every private interest and patriotic\r\nsentiment, so men, as they become prominent, and more or less\r\nidentified with this or that policy, at last take the place of\r\nprinciples with the majority of minds. To agree with us is to be a\r\ngreat commander, a prudent administrator, a politician without private\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the works of Mr. Pollard[2] and Mr. Greeley[3] is\r\nvery striking. Though coincident in design, they are the antipodes of\r\neach other in treatment. Mr. Greeley, finding a country beyond measure\r\nprosperous suddenly assailed by rebellion, is naturally led to seek an\r\nadequate cause for so abnormal an effect. Mr. Pollard, formerly an\r\noffice-holder under the United States, and now the editor of a Richmond\r\nnewspaper, is struck by the same reflection, and, unwilling to state\r\nthe true cause, or unable to find a plausible reason, is driven to hunt\r\nup an excuse for what strikes ordinary people as one of the greatest\r\ncrimes in history. The difference is instructive.\r\n\r\n      [2] _The Southern History of the War. The First Year of the\r\n      War._ By Edward A. Pollard.\r\n\r\n      [3] _The American Conflict._ By Horace Greeley. Vol. I.\r\n\r\nMr. Pollard's book, however, is well worth reading by those who wish to\r\nlearn something of the motives which originally led the Southern States\r\ninto rebellion, and still actuate them in their obstinate resistance.\r\nTo any one familiar with the history of the last thirty years, it would\r\nalmost seem that Mr. Pollard's object had been to expose the futility\r\nof the pretences set up by the originators of Secession, so utterly\r\ndoes he fail in showing any adequate grounds for that desperate\r\nmeasure. As a history, the book is of little value, except as giving us\r\nhere and there a hint by which we can guess something of the state of\r\nmind prevailing at the South. In point of style it is a curious jumble\r\nof American sense and Southern _highfaluting_. One might fancy it\r\nwritten by a schoolmaster, whose boys had got hold of the manuscript,\r\nand inserted here and there passages taken at random from the _Gems\r\nof Irish Oratory_. Mr. Pollard's notions of the \"Yankees,\" and the\r\ncondition of things among them, would be creditable to a Chinaman from\r\npretty well up in the back country. No society could hold together for\r\na moment in the condition of moral decay which he attributes to the\r\nNorthern States. Before writing his next volume he should read Charles\r\nLamb's advice \"to those who have the framing of advertisements for the\r\napprehension of offenders.\" We must do him the justice to say, however,\r\nthat he writes no nonsense about difference of races, and that, of all\r\n\"Yankees,\" he most thoroughly despises the Northern snob who professes\r\na sympathy for \"Southern institutions\" because he believes that a\r\nslaveholder is a better man than himself.\r\n\r\nIn narrating the causes which brought about the present state of\r\nthings, Mr. Pollard arranges matters to suit his own convenience,\r\nconstantly reversing the relations of cause and effect, and forgetting\r\nthat the order of events is of every importance in estimating their\r\nmoral bearing. The only theoretic reason he gives for Secession is the\r\ndesire to escape from the tyranny of a \"numerical majority.\" Yet it was\r\nby precisely such a majority, and that attained by force or fraud, that\r\nthe seceding States were taken out of the Union. We entirely agree with\r\nMr. Pollard that a show of hands is no test of truth; but he seems to\r\nforget that, except under a despotism, a numerical majority of some\r\nsort or other is sure to govern. No man capable of thought, as Mr.\r\nPollard certainly is, would admit that a majority was any more likely\r\nto be right under a system of limited than under one of universal\r\nsuffrage, always provided the said majority did not express his own\r\nopinions. The majority always governs in the long run, because it comes\r\ngradually round to the side of what is just and for the common\r\ninterest, and the only dangerous majority is that of a mob unchecked by\r\nthe delay for reflection which all constitutional government\r\ninterposes. The constitutions of most of the Slave States, so far as\r\nwhite men are concerned, are of the most intensely democratic type.\r\nWould Mr. Pollard consolidate them all under one strong government, or\r\ndoes he believe that to be good for a single State which is bad for\r\nmany united? It is curious to see, in his own intense antipathy to a\r\nslaveholding aristocracy, how purely American he is in spite of his\r\ntheories; and, bitterly hostile as he is to the Davis administration,\r\nhe may chance on the reflection that a majority is pretty much the same\r\nthing in one parallel of latitude as another. Of one thing he may be\r\nassured,--that we of the North do not understand by republic a\r\ngovernment of the better and more intelligent class by the worse and\r\nmore ignorant, and accordingly are doing our best by education to\r\nabolish the distinction between the two.\r\n\r\nThe fact that no adequate reasons for Secession have ever been brought\r\nforward, either by the seceding States at the time, or by their\r\napologists since, can only be explained on the theory that nothing more\r\nthan a _coup d'etat_ was intended, which should put the South in\r\npossession of the government. Owing to the wretched policy (if\r\nsupineness deserve the name) largely prevalent in the North, of sending\r\nto the lower house of Congress the men who needed rather than those who\r\nought to go there,--men without the responsibility or the independence\r\nwhich only established reputation, social position, long converse with\r\ngreat questions, or native strength of character can give,--and to the\r\nhabit of looking on a seat in the national legislature more as the\r\nreward for partisan activity than as imposing a service of the highest\r\nnature, so that representatives were changed as often as there were new\r\npolitical debts to pay or cliques to be conciliated,--owing to these\r\nthings, the South maintained an easy superiority at Washington, and\r\nlearned to measure the Free States by men who represented their\r\nweakest, and sometimes their least honorable, characteristics. We doubt\r\nif the Slave States have sent many men to the Capitol who could be\r\nbought, while it is notorious that from the north of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline many an M.C. has cleared, like a ship, for Washington and a\r\nmarket. Southern politicians judge the North by men without courage and\r\nwithout principle, who would consent to any measure if it could be\r\nbecomingly draped in generalities, or if they could evade the pillory\r\nof the yeas and nays. The increasing drain of forensic ability toward\r\nthe large cities, with the mistaken theory that residence in the\r\ndistrict was a necessary qualification in candidates, tended still more\r\nto bring down the average of Northern representation. The \"claims\" of a\r\nsection of the State, or even part of a district, have been allowed to\r\nhave weight, as if square miles or acres were to be weighed against\r\ncapacity and experience. We attached too little importance to the\r\nsocial prestige which the South acquired and maintained at the seat of\r\ngovernment, forgetting the necessary influence it would exert upon the\r\nindependence of many of our own members. These in turn brought home the\r\nnew impressions they had acquired, till the fallacy gradually became\r\nconviction of a general superiority in the South, though it had only so\r\nmuch truth in it as this, that the people of that section sent their\r\nmen of character and position to Washington, and kept them there till\r\nevery year of experience added an efficiency which more than made up\r\nfor their numerical inferiority. Meanwhile, our thinking men allowed,\r\nwhether from timidity or contempt, certain demagogic fallacies to\r\nbecome axioms by dint of repetition, chief among which was the notion\r\nthat a man was the better representative of the democratic principle\r\nwho had contrived to push himself forward to popularity by whatever\r\nmeans, and who represented the average instead of the highest culture\r\nof the community, thus establishing an aristocracy of mediocrity, nay,\r\neven of vulgarity, in some less intelligent constituencies. The one\r\ngreat strength of democracy is, that it opens all the highways of power\r\nand station to the better man, that it gives every man the chance of\r\nrising to his natural level; and its great weakness is in its tendency\r\nto urge this principle to a vicious excess, by pushing men forward into\r\npositions for which they are unfit, not so much because they deserve to\r\nrise, or because they have risen by great qualities, as because they\r\nbegan low. Our quadrennial change of offices, which turns public\r\nservice into a matter of bargain and sale instead of the reward of\r\nmerit and capacity, which sends men to Congress to represent private\r\ninterests in the sharing of plunder, without regard to any claims of\r\nstatesmanship or questions of national policy, as if the ship of state\r\nwere periodically captured by privateers, has hastened our downward\r\nprogress in the evil way. By making the administration prominent at the\r\ncost of the government, and by its constant lesson of scramble and\r\nvicissitude, almost obliterating the idea of orderly permanence, it has\r\ntended in no small measure to make disruption possible, for Mr.\r\nLincoln's election threw the weight of every office-holder in the South\r\ninto the scale of Secession. The war, however, has proved that the core\r\nof Democracy was sound; that the people, if they had been neglectful of\r\ntheir duties, or had misapprehended them, had not become corrupt.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley's volume is a valuable contribution to our political\r\nhistory. Though for many years well known as an ardent politician, and\r\nassociated by popular prejudice with that class of untried social\r\ntheories which are known by the name of _isms_, his tone is\r\nsingularly calm and dispassionate. Disfigured here and there by a\r\nvulgarism which adds nothing to its point, while it detracts from its\r\npurity, his style is clear, straightforward, and masculine,--a good\r\nbusiness style, at once bare of ornament and undiluted with eloquence.\r\nMr. Greeley's intimate knowledge of our politics and instinctive\r\nsympathy with the far-reaching scope of our institutions (for, as\r\nBeranger said of himself, he is _tout peuple_) admirably fitted\r\nhim for his task. He is clear, concise, and accurate, honestly striving\r\nafter the truth, while his judicious Preface shows that he appreciates\r\nfully the difficulties that beset whoever seeks to find it. If none of\r\nhis readers will be surprised to find his work that of an able man,\r\nthere are many who would not expect it to be, as it is, that of a\r\nfair-minded one. He writes without passion, making due allowance for\r\nhuman nature in the South as well as the North, and does not waste his\r\nstrength, as is the manner of fanatics, in fighting imaginary giants\r\nwhile a real enemy is in the field. Tracing Secession to its twin\r\nsources in slavery and the doctrine of State Rights, and amply\r\nsustaining his statements of fact by citations from contemporary\r\ndocuments and speeches, he has made the plainest, and for that very\r\nreason, we think, the strongest, argument that has been put forth on\r\nthe national side of the question at issue in our civil war. Above all,\r\nhe is ready to allow those virtues in the character of the Southern\r\npeople whose existence alone makes reunion desirable or possible. We\r\nshould not forget that the Negro is at least no more our brother than\r\nthey, for if he have fallen among thieves who have robbed him of his\r\nmanhood, they have been equally enslaved by prejudice, ignorance, and\r\nsocial inferiority.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little singular that, while slavery has been for nearly\r\neighty years the one root of bitterness in our politics, the general\r\nknowledge of its history should be so superficial. Abolitionism has\r\nbeen so persistently represented as the disturbing element which\r\nthreatened the permanence of our Union, that mere repetition has at\r\nlast become conviction with that large class of minds with which a\r\nconclusion is valuable exactly in proportion as it saves mental labor.\r\nMr. Greeley's chronological narrative is an excellent corrective of\r\nthis delusion, and his tough little facts, driven firmly home, will\r\nserve to spike this parrot battery, and render it harmless for the\r\nfuture. A consecutive statement of such of the events in our history as\r\nbear directly on the question of slavery, separated from all secondary\r\ncircumstances, shows two things clearly: first, that the doctrine that\r\nthere was any national obligation to consider slaves as merely\r\nproperty, or to hold our tongues about slavery, is of comparatively\r\nrecent origin; and, second, that there was a pretty uniform ebb of\r\nanti-slavery sentiment for nearly sixty years after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, the young flood beginning to set strongly in again after\r\nthe full meaning of the annexation of Texas began to be understood at\r\nthe North, but not fairly filling up again even its own deserted\r\nchannels till the Southern party succeeded in cutting the embankment of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise. Then at last it became evident that the real\r\ndanger to be guarded against was the abolition of Freedom, and the\r\nreaction was as violent as it was sudden.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Republic, slavery was admitted to be a social\r\nand moral evil, only to be justified by necessity; and we think it more\r\nthan doubtful if South Carolina and Georgia could have procured an\r\nextension of the slave-trade, had there not been a general persuasion\r\nthat the whole system could not long maintain itself against the growth\r\nof intelligence and humanity. As early as 1786 a resident of South\r\nCarolina wrote: \"In countries where slavery is encouraged, the ideas of\r\nthe people are of a peculiar cast; the soul becomes dark and narrow,\r\nand assumes a tone of savage brutality.... The most elevated and\r\nliberal Carolinians abhor slavery; they will not debase themselves by\r\nattempting to vindicate it.\" In 1789 William Pinckney said, in the\r\nMaryland Assembly: \"Sir, by the eternal principles of natural justice,\r\nno master in the State has a right to hold his slave in bondage for a\r\nsingle hour.\" And he went on to speak of slavery in a way which, fifty\r\nyears later, would have earned him a coat of tar and feathers, if not a\r\nhalter, in any of the Slave States, and in some of the Free. In 1787\r\nDelaware passed an act forbidding the importation of \"negro or mulatto\r\nslaves into the State for sale or otherwise;\" and three years later her\r\ncourts declared a slave, hired in Maryland and brought over the border,\r\nfree under this statute. In 1790 there were Abolition societies in\r\nMaryland and Virginia. In 1787 the Synod of the Presbyterian Church\r\n(since called the General Assembly), in their pastoral letter,\r\n\"strongly recommended the abolition of slavery, with the instruction of\r\nthe negroes in literature and religion.\" We cite these instances to\r\nshow that the sacredness of slavery from discussion was a discovery of\r\nmuch later date. So also was the theory of its divine origin,--a\r\ntheological slough in which, we are sorry to say, Northern men have\r\nshown themselves readiest to bemire themselves. It was when slave labor\r\nand slave breeding began to bring large and rapid profits, by the\r\nextension of cotton-culture consequent on the invention of Whitney's\r\ngin, and the purchase of Louisiana, that slavery was found to be\r\nidentical with religion, and, like Duty, a \"daughter of the voice of\r\nGod.\" Till it became rich, it had been content with claiming the\r\nmunicipal law for its parent, but now it was easy to find heralds who\r\ncould blazon for it a nobler pedigree. Men who looked upon dancing as\r\nsinful could see the very beauty of holiness in a system like this! It\r\nis consoling to think that, even in England, it is little more than a\r\ncentury since the divine right of kings ceased to be defended in the\r\nsame way, by making the narrative portions of Scripture doctrinal. Such\r\nstrange things have been found in the Bible that we are not without\r\nhope of the discovery of Christianity there, one of these days.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Southern States in the national politics was due\r\nmainly to the fact of their having a single interest on which they were\r\nall united, and, though fond of contrasting their more chivalric\r\ncharacter with the commercial spirit of the North, it will be found\r\nthat profit has been the motive to all the encroachments of slavery.\r\nThese encroachments first assumed the offensive with the annexation of\r\nTexas. In the admission of Missouri, though the Free States might\r\njustly claim a right to fix the political destiny of half the\r\nterritory, bought with the common money of the nation, and though\r\nevents have since proved that the compromise of 1820 was a fatal\r\nmistake, yet, as slavery was already established there, the South\r\nmight, with some show of reason, claim to be on the defensive. In one\r\nsense, it is true, every enlargement of the boundaries of slavery has\r\nbeen an aggression. For it cannot with any fairness be assumed that the\r\nframers of the Constitution intended to foreordain a perpetual balance\r\nof power between the Free and the Slave States. If they had, it is\r\nmorally certain that they would not so have arranged the basis of\r\nrepresentation as to secure to the South an unfair preponderance, to be\r\nincreased with every addition of territory. It is much more probable\r\nthat they expected the Southern States to fall more and more into a\r\nminority of population and wealth, and were willing to strengthen this\r\nminority by yielding it somewhat more than its just share of power in\r\nCongress. Indeed, it was mainly on the ground of the undue advantage\r\nwhich the South would gain, politically, that the admission of Missouri\r\nwas distasteful to the North.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after the Southern politicians had firmly established\r\ntheir system of governing the country by an alliance with the\r\nDemocratic party of the Free States, on the basis of a division of\r\noffices, that they dreamed of making their \"institution\" the chief\r\nconcern of the nation. As we follow Mr. Greeley's narrative, we see\r\nthem first pleading for the existence of slavery, then for its\r\nequality, and at last claiming for it an absolute dominion. Such had\r\nbeen the result of uniform concession on the part of the North for the\r\nsake of Union, such the decline of public spirit, that within sixty\r\nyears of the time when slaveholders like George Mason of Virginia could\r\ndenounce slavery for its inconsistency with the principles on which our\r\nRevolution had triumphed, the leaders of a party at the North claiming\r\na kind of patent in the rights of man as an expedient for catching\r\nvotes were decrying the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence as\r\nvisionary and impracticable. Was it the Slave or the Free States that\r\nhad just cause to be alarmed for their peculiar institutions? And,\r\nmeanwhile, it had been discovered that slavery was conservative! It\r\nwould protect a country in which almost every voter was a landholder\r\nfrom any sudden frenzy of agrarianism! In the South it certainly\r\nconserved a privileged class, and prevented a general debauch of\r\neducation; but in the North it preserved nothing but political\r\ncorruption, subserviency, cant, and all those baser qualities which\r\nunenviably distinguish man from the brutes.\r\n\r\nThe nation had paid ten millions for Texas, an extension of the area of\r\nfreedom, as it was shamelessly called, which was to raise the value of\r\nslaves in Virginia, according to Mr. Upshur, and did raise it, fifty\r\nper cent. It was next proposed to purchase Cuba for one hundred\r\nmillions, or to take it by force if Spain refused to sell. And all this\r\nfor fear of abolition. This was paying rather dearly for our\r\nconservative element, it should seem, especially when it stood in need\r\nof such continual and costly conservation. But it continued to be plain\r\nto a majority of voters that democratic institutions absolutely\r\ndemanded a safeguard against democracy, and that the only insurance was\r\nsomething that must be itself constantly insured at more and more\r\nruinous rates. It continued to be plain also that slavery was purely a\r\nmatter of local concern, though it could help itself to the national\r\nmoney, force the nation into an unjust war, and stain its reputation in\r\nEurope with the buccaneering principles proclaimed in the Ostend\r\nManifesto. All these were plainly the results of the ever-increasing\r\nand unprovoked aggressions of Northern fanaticism. To be the victims of\r\nsuch injustice seemed not unpleasing to the South. Let us sum up the\r\nitems of their little bill against us. They demanded Missouri,--we\r\nyielded; they could not get along without Texas,--we _re_-annexed it;\r\nthey must have a more stringent fugitive-slave law,--we gulped it; they\r\nmust no longer be insulted with the Missouri Compromise,--we repealed\r\nit. Thus far the North had surely been faithful to the terms of the\r\nbond. We had paid our pound of flesh whenever it was asked for, and\r\nwith fewer wry faces, inasmuch as Brother Ham underwent the incision.\r\nNot at all. We had only surrendered the principles of the Revolution;\r\nwe must give up the theory also, if we would be loyal to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nWe entirely agree with Mr. Greeley that the quibble which would make\r\nthe Constitution an anti-slavery document, because the word _slave_ is\r\nnot mentioned in it, cannot stand a moment if we consider the speeches\r\nmade in Convention, or the ideas by which the action of its members was\r\nguided. But the question of slavery in the Territories stands on wholly\r\ndifferent ground. We know what the opinions of the men were who drafted\r\nthe Constitution, by their own procedure in passing the Ordinance of\r\n1787. That the North should yield all claim to the common lands was\r\ncertainly a new interpretation of constitutional law. And yet this was\r\npractically insisted on by the South, and its denial was the more\r\nimmediate occasion of rupture between the two sections. But, in our\r\nopinion, the real cause which brought the question to the decision of\r\nwar was the habit of concession on the part of the North, and the\r\ninability of its representatives to say _No_, when policy as well as\r\nconscience made it imperative. Without that confidence in Northern\r\npusillanimity into which the South had been educated by their long\r\nexperience of this weakness, whatever might have been the secret wish\r\nof the leading plotters, they would never have dared to rush their\r\nfellow-citizens into a position where further compromise became\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nInextricably confused with the question of Slavery, and essential to an\r\nunderstanding of the motives and character of the Southern people as\r\ndistinguished from their politicians, is the doctrine of State Rights.\r\nOn this topic also Mr. Greeley furnishes all the data requisite to a\r\nfull understanding of the matter. The dispute resolves itself\r\nsubstantially into this: whether the adoption of the Constitution\r\nestablished a union or a confederacy, a government or a league, a\r\nnation or a committee. This also is a question which can only be\r\ndetermined by a knowledge of what the Convention of 1787 intended and\r\naccomplished, and the States severally acceded to,--it being of course\r\nunderstood that no State had a right, or at the time pretended any\r\nright, to accept the Constitution with mental reservations. On this\r\nsubject we have ample and unimpeachable testimony in the discussions\r\nwhich led to the calling of the Convention, and the debates which\r\nfollowed in the different conventions of the States called together to\r\ndecide whether the new frame of government should be accepted or\r\nrejected. The conviction that it was absolutely necessary to remodel\r\nthe Articles of Confederation was wrought wholly by an experience of\r\nthe inadequacy of the existing plan (under which a single State could\r\noppose its veto to a law of Congress), from, the looseness of its\r\ncohesion and its want of power to compel obedience. The principle of\r\ncoercive authority, which was represented as so oppressively\r\nunconstitutional by the friends of Secession in the North as well as\r\nthe South four years ago, was precisely that which, as its absence had\r\nbrought the old plan to a dead-lock, was deemed essential to the new.\r\nThe formal proposal for a convention, originated by Hamilton, was\r\nseconded by one State after another. Here is a sample of Virginian\r\npublic sentiment at that time, from the \"instructions to their\r\nrepresentatives,\" by several constituencies: \"Government without\r\ncoercion is a proposition at once so absurd and self-contradictory that\r\nthe idea creates a confusion of the understanding; it is form without\r\nsubstance, at best a body without a soul.\" Oliver Ellsworth, advocating\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution in the Convention of Connecticut,\r\nsays: \"A more energetic system is necessary. The present is merely\r\nadvisory. It has no coercive power. Without this, government is\r\nineffectual, or rather is no government at all.\" Earlier than this\r\nMadison had claimed \"an implied right of coercion\" even for the\r\nConfederate Congress, and Jefferson had gone so far as to say that they\r\npossessed it \"by the law of nature.\" The leading objections to the new\r\nConstitution were such as to show the general belief that the State\r\nsovereignties were to be absorbed into the general government in all\r\nmatters of national concern. But the unhappy ingenuity of Mr. Jefferson\r\nafterwards devised that theory of strict construction which would\r\nenable any State to profit by the powers of the Constitution so long as\r\nit was for her interest or convenience, and then, by pleading its want\r\nof powers, to resolve the helpless organization once more into the\r\nincoherence of confederacy. By this dexterous legerdemain, the Union\r\nbecame a string of juggler's rings, which seems a chain while it\r\npleases the operator, but which, by bringing the strain on the weak\r\npoint contrived for the purpose, is made to fall easily asunder and\r\nbecome separate rings again. An adroit use of this theory enabled the\r\nSouth to gain one advantage after another by threatening disunion, and\r\nled naturally, on the first effective show of resistance, to secession.\r\nBut in order that the threat might serve its purpose without the costly\r\nnecessity of putting it in execution, the doctrine of State Rights was\r\ncarefully inculcated at the South by the same political party which\r\nmade belief in the value of the Union a fanaticism at the North. On one\r\nside of Mason and Dixon's line it was lawful, and even praiseworthy, to\r\nsteal the horse; on the other, it was a hanging matter to look over the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nBut in seeking for the cause of the rebellion, with any fairness toward\r\nthe Southern people, and any wish to understand their motives and\r\ncharacter, it would be unwise to leave out of view the fact that they\r\nhave been carefully educated in the faith that secession is not only\r\ntheir right, but the only safeguard of their freedom. While it is\r\nperfectly true that the great struggle now going on is intrinsically\r\nbetween right and privilege, between law and license, and while on the\r\npart of its leaders the Southern revolt was a conspiracy against\r\npopular government, and an attempt to make a great Republic into a mere\r\nconvenient drudge for Slavery, yet we should despair of our kind did we\r\nbelieve that the rank and file of the Confederate armies were\r\nconsciously spending so much courage and endurance on behalf of\r\nbarbarism. It is more consoling, as it is nearer the truth, to think\r\nthat they are fighting for what they have been taught to believe their\r\nrights, and their inheritance as a free people. The high qualities they\r\nhave undoubtedly shown in the course of the war, their tenacity,\r\npatience, and discipline, show that, under better influences, they may\r\nbecome worthy to take their part in advancing the true destinies of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is yet too early to speculate with much confidence on the remote\r\nconsequences of the war. One of its more immediate results has already\r\nbeen to disabuse the Southern mind of some of its most fatal\r\nmisconceptions as to Northern character. They thought us a trading\r\npeople, incapable of lofty sentiment, ready to sacrifice everything for\r\ncommercial advantage,--a heterogeneous rabble, fit only to be ruled by\r\na superior race. They are not likely to make that mistake again, and\r\nmust have learned by this time that the best blood is that which has in\r\nit most of the iron of purpose and constancy. War, the sternest and\r\ndearest of teachers, has already made us a soberer and older people on\r\nboth sides. It has brought questions of government and policy home to\r\nus as never before, and has made us feel that citizenship is a duty to\r\nwhose level we must rise, and not a privilege to which we are born. The\r\ngreat principles of humanity and politics, which had faded into the\r\ndistance of abstraction and history, have been for four years the theme\r\nof earnest thought and discussion at every fireside and wherever two\r\nmen met together. They have again become living and operative in the\r\nheart and mind of the nation. What was before a mighty population is\r\ngrown a great country, united in one hope, inspired by one thought, and\r\nwelded into one power. But have not the same influences produced the\r\nsame result in the South, and created there also a nation hopelessly\r\nalien and hostile? To a certain extent this is true, but not in the\r\nunlimited way in which it is stated by enemies in England, or\r\npoliticians at home, who would gladly put the people out of heart,\r\nbecause they themselves are out of office. With the destruction of\r\nslavery, the one object of the war will have been lost by the Rebels,\r\nand its one great advantage gained by the government. Slavery is by no\r\nmeans dead as yet, whether socially in its relation of man to man, or\r\nmorally in its hold on public opinion and its strength as a political\r\nsuperstition. But there is no party at the North, considerable in\r\nnumbers or influence, which could come into power on the platform of\r\nmaking peace with the Rebels on their own terms. No party can get\r\npossession of the government which is not in sympathy with the temper\r\nof the people, and the people, forced into war against their will by\r\nthe unprovoked attack of pro-slavery bigotry, are resolved on pushing\r\nit to its legitimate conclusion. War means now, consciously with many,\r\nunconsciously with most, but inevitably, abolition. Nothing can save\r\nslavery but peace. Let its doom be once accomplished, or its\r\nreconstruction (for reconstruction means nothing more) clearly seen to\r\nbe an impossibility, and the bond between the men at the South who were\r\nwilling to destroy the Union, and those at the North who only wish to\r\nsave it, for the sake of slavery, will be broken. The ambitious in both\r\nsections will prefer their chances as members of a mighty empire to\r\nwhat would always be secondary places in two rival and hostile nations,\r\npowerless to command respect abroad or secure prosperity at home. The\r\nmasses of the Southern people will not feel too keenly the loss of a\r\nkind of property in which they had no share, while it made them\r\nunderlings, nor will they find it hard to reconcile themselves with a\r\ngovernment from which they had no real cause of estrangement. If the\r\nwar be waged manfully, as becomes a thoughtful people, without insult\r\nor childish triumph in success, if we meet opinion with wiser opinion,\r\nwaste no time in badgering prejudice till it become hostility, and\r\nattack slavery as a crime against the nation, and not as individual\r\nsin, it will end, we believe, in making us the most powerful and\r\nprosperous community the world ever saw. Our example and our ideas will\r\nreact more powerfully than ever on the Old World, and the consequence\r\nof a rebellion, aimed at the natural equality of all men, will be to\r\nhasten incalculably the progress of equalization over the whole earth.\r\nAbove all, Freedom will become the one absorbing interest of the whole\r\npeople, making us a nation alive from sea to sea with the consciousness\r\nof a great purpose and a noble destiny, and uniting us as slavery has\r\nhitherto combined and made powerful the most hateful aristocracy known\r\nto man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN OR LINCOLN?\r\n\r\n1864\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of an opposition waiting patiently during several months\r\nfor its principles to turn up would be amusing in times less critical\r\nthan these. Nor was this the worst. If there might be persons malicious\r\nenough to think that the Democratic party could get along very well\r\nwithout principles, all would admit that a candidate was among the\r\nnecessaries of life. Now, where not only immediate policy, but the very\r\ncreed which that policy is to embody, is dependent on circumstances,\r\nand on circumstances so shifting and doubtful as those of a campaign,\r\nit is hard to find a representative man whose name may, in some\r\npossible contingency, mean enough, without, in some other equally\r\npossible contingency, meaning too much. The problem was to hunt up\r\nsomebody who, without being anything in particular, might be anything\r\nin general, as occasion demanded. Of course, the professed object of\r\nthe party was to save their country, but which _was_ their country, and\r\nwhich it would be most profitable to save, whether America or Secessia,\r\nwas a question that Grant or Sherman might answer one way or the other\r\nin a single battle. If only somebody or something would tell them\r\nwhether they were for war or peace! The oracles were dumb, and all\r\nsummer long they looked anxiously out, like Sister Anne from her tower,\r\nfor the hero who should rescue unhappy Columbia from the Republican\r\nBluebeard. Did they see a cloud of dust in the direction of Richmond or\r\nAtlanta? Perhaps Grant might be the man, after all, or even Sherman\r\nwould answer at a pinch. When at last no great man would come along, it\r\nwas debated whether it might not be better to nominate some one without\r\na record, as it is called, since a nobody was clearly the best exponent\r\nof a party that was under the unhappy necessity of being still\r\nuncertain whether it had any recognizable soul or not. Meanwhile, the\r\ntime was getting short and the public impatience peremptory.\r\n\r\n    \"Under which king, bezonian? Speak, or die!\"\r\n\r\nThe party found it alike inconvenient to do the one or the other, and\r\nended by a compromise which might serve to keep them alive till after\r\nelection, but which was as far from any distinct utterance as if their\r\nmouths were already full of that official pudding which they hope for\r\nas the reward of their amphibological patriotism. Since it was not safe\r\nto be either for peace or war, they resolved to satisfy every\r\nreasonable expectation by being at the same time both and neither. If\r\nyou are warlike, there is General McClellan; if pacific, surely you\r\nmust be suited with Mr. Pendleton; if neither, the combination of the\r\ntwo makes a _tertium quid_ that is neither one thing nor another. As\r\nthe politic Frenchman, kissing the foot of St. Peter's statue (recast\r\nout of a Jupiter), while he thus did homage to existing prejudices,\r\nhoped that the Thunderer would remember him if he ever came into power\r\nagain, so the Chicago Convention compliments the prevailing warlike\r\nsentiment of the country with a soldier, but holds the civilian quietly\r\nin reserve for the future contingencies of submission. The nomination\r\nis a kind of political _What-is-it?_ and voters are expected, without\r\nasking impertinent questions, to pay their money and make their own\r\nchoice as to the natural history of the animal. Looked at from the\r\nNorthern side, it is a raven, the bird of carnage, to be sure, but\r\nwhitewashed and looking as decorously dove-like as it can; from the\r\nSouthern, it is a dove, blackened over for the nonce, but letting the\r\nolive-branch peep from under its wing.\r\n\r\nA more delicate matter for a convention, however, even than the\r\nselection of candidates, is the framing of a platform for them to stand\r\nupon. It was especially delicate for a gathering which represented so\r\nmany heterogeneous and almost hostile elements. So incongruous an\r\nassemblage has not been seen since the host of Peter the Hermit,\r\nunanimous in nothing but the hope of plunder and of reconquering the\r\nHoly Land of office. There were War Democrats ready to unite in peace\r\nresolutions, and Peace Democrats eager to move the unanimous nomination\r\nof a war candidate. To make the confusion complete, Mr. Franklin\r\nPierce, the dragooner of Kansas, writes a letter in favor of free\r\nelections, and the maligners of New England propose a Connecticut\r\nYankee as their favorite nominee. The Convention was a rag-bag of\r\ndissent, made up of bits so various in hue and texture that the\r\nmanagers must have been as much puzzled to arrange them in any kind of\r\nharmonious pattern as the thrifty housewife in planning her coverlet\r\nout of the parings of twenty years' dressmaking. All the odds and ends\r\nof personal discontent, every shred of private grudge, every resentful\r\nrag snipped off by official shears, scraps of Rebel gray and leavings\r\nof Union blue,--all had been gathered, as if for the tailoring of\r\nJoseph's coat; and as a Chatham Street broker first carefully removes\r\nall marks of previous ownership from the handkerchiefs which find their\r\nway to his counter, so the temporary chairman advised his hearers, by\r\nway of a preliminary caution, to surrender their convictions. This,\r\nperhaps, was superfluous, for it may be doubted whether anybody\r\npresent, except Mr. Fernando Wood, ever legally had one, though Captain\r\nRynders must have brought many in his following who richly deserved it.\r\nMr. Belmont, being chosen to represent the Democracy of Mammon, did\r\nlittle more than paraphrase in prose the speech of that fallen\r\nfinancier in another rebellious conclave, as reported by Milton:--\r\n\r\n          \"How in safety best we may\r\n    Compose our present evils, with regard\r\n    Of what we are and were, dismissing quite\r\n    All thoughts of war.\"\r\n\r\nBut we turn from the momentary elevation of the banker, to follow the\r\narduous labors of the Committee on Resolutions.[4] The single end to\r\nbe served by the platform they were to construct was that of a bridge\r\nover which their candidate might make his way into the White House.\r\nBut it must be so built as to satisfy the somewhat exacting theory\r\nof construction held by the Rebel emissaries at Niagara, while at the\r\nsame time no apprehensions as to its soundness must be awakened in the\r\nloyal voters of the party. The war plank would offend the one, the\r\nState Rights plank excite the suspicion of the other. The poor fellow\r\nin AEsop, with his two wives, one pulling out the black hairs and the\r\nother the white, was not in a more desperate situation than the\r\nCommittee,--MacHeath, between his two doxies, not more embarrassed. The\r\nresult of their labors was, accordingly, as narrow as the pathway of\r\nthe faithful into the Mahometan paradise,--so slender, indeed, that\r\nBlondin should have been selected as the only candidate who could hope\r\nto keep his balance on it, with the torrent of events rushing ever\r\nswifter and louder below. It might sustain the somewhat light Unionism\r\nof Mr. Pendleton, but would General McClellan dare to trust its fragile\r\nfooting, with his Report and his West Point oration, with his record,\r\nin short, under his arm? Without these documents General McClellan is a\r\nnobody; with them, before he can step on a peace platform, he must eat\r\nan amount of leek that would have turned the stomach of Ancient Pistol\r\nhimself. It remained to be seen whether he was more in favor of being\r\nPresident than of his own honor and that of the country.\r\n\r\n      [4] The _Platform of the Chicago Convention_ was published\r\n      in the public journals 30th August.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions of the Chicago Convention, though they denounce various\r\nwrongs and evils, some of them merely imaginary, and all the necessary\r\nresults of civil war, propose only one thing,--surrender. Disguise it\r\nas you will, flavor it as you will, call it what you will, umble-pie is\r\numble-pie, and nothing else. The people instinctively so understood it.\r\nThey rejected with disgust a plan whose mere proposal took their\r\npusillanimity for granted, and whose acceptance assured their\r\nself-contempt. At a moment when the Rebels would be checkmated in\r\nanother move, we are advised to give them a knight and begin the game\r\nover again. If they are not desperate, what chance of their accepting\r\noffers which they rejected with scorn before the war began? If they are\r\nnot desperate, why is their interest more intense in the result of our\r\nnext Presidential election than even in the campaign at their very\r\ndoor? If they were not desperate, would two respectable men like\r\nMessrs. Clay and Holcomb endure the society of George Saunders? General\r\nMcClellan himself admitted the righteousness of the war by volunteering\r\nin it, and, the war once begun, the only real question has been whether\r\nthe principle of legitimate authority or that of wanton insurrection\r\nagainst it should prevail,--whether we should have for the future a\r\ngovernment of opinion or of brute force. When the rebellion began, its\r\nleaders had no intention to dissolve the Union, but to reconstruct it,\r\nto make the Montgomery Constitution and Jefferson Davis supreme over\r\nthe whole country, and not over a feeble fragment of it. They knew, as\r\nwe knew, the weakness of a divided country, and our experience of\r\nforeign governments during the last four years has not been such as to\r\nlessen the apprehension on that score, or to make the consciousness of\r\nit less pungent in either of the contending sections. Even now,\r\nJefferson Davis is said to be in favor of a confederation between the\r\nFree and the Slave States. But what confederation could give us back\r\nthe power and prestige of the old Union? The experience of Germany\r\nsurely does not tempt to imitation. And in making overtures for peace,\r\nwith whom are we to treat? Talking vaguely about \"the South,\" \"the\r\nConfederate States,\" or \"the Southern people,\" does not help the\r\nmatter; for the cat under all this meal is always the _government_\r\nat Richmond, men with everything to expect from independence, with much\r\nto hope from reconstruction, and sure of nothing but ruin from reunion.\r\nAnd these men, who were arrogant as equals and partners, are to be\r\nmoderate in dictating terms as conquerors! If the people understood\r\nless clearly the vital principle which is at hazard in this contest, if\r\nthey were not fully persuaded that Slavery and State Eights are merely\r\nthe counters, and that free institutions are the real stake, they might\r\nbe deluded with the hope of compromise. But there are things that are\r\nnot subjects of compromise. The honor, the conscience, the very soul of\r\na nation, cannot be compromised without ceasing to exist. When you\r\npropose to yield a part of them, there is already nothing left to\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this is all that the party calling itself Democratic, after\r\nmonths of deliberation, after four years in which to study the popular\r\nmind, have to offer in the way of policy. It is neither more nor less\r\nthan to confess that they have no real faith in popular\r\nself-government, for it is to assume that the people have neither\r\ncommon nor moral sense. General McClellan is to be put in command of\r\nthe national citadel, on condition that he immediately offers to\r\ncapitulate. To accept the nomination on these terms was to lose, not\r\nonly his election, but his self-respect. Accordingly, no sooner was the\r\ndamaging effect of the platform evident than it was rumored that he\r\nwould consent to the candidacy, but reject the conditions on which\r\nalone it was offered. The singular uniform, half Union-blue and half\r\nConfederate--gray, in which it was proposed by the managers at Chicago\r\nto array the Democratic party, while it might be no novelty to some\r\ncamp-followers of the New York delegation familiar with the rules of\r\ncertain of our public institutions, could hardly be agreeable to one\r\nwho had worn the livery of his country with distinction. It was the\r\nscene of Petruchio and the tailor over again:--\r\n\r\n    _Gen. McC._ \"Why, what, i' th' Devil's name, tailor, call'st\r\n                thou this?\"\r\n\r\n    _Committee._ \"You bid me make it orderly and well,\r\n                 According to the fashion and the time.\"\r\n\r\n    _Gen. McC._ \"Marry, I did; but, if you be remembered,\r\n                _I did not bid you mar it to the time._\"\r\n\r\nBetween the nomination and acceptance came the taking of Atlanta,\r\nmarring the coat to the time with a vengeance, and suggesting the\r\nnecessity of turning it,--a sudden cure which should rank among the\r\nfirst in future testimonials to the efficacy of Sherman's lozenges. Had\r\nGeneral McClellan thrust the resolutions away from him with an honest\r\nscorn, we should have nothing to say save in commendation. But to\r\naccept them with his own interpretation, to put upon them a meaning\r\nutterly averse from their plain intention, and from that understanding\r\nof them which the journals of his own faction clearly indicated by\r\ntheir exultation or their silence, according as they favored\r\nConfederacy or Union, is to prepare a deception for one of the parties\r\nto the bargain. In such cases, which is commonly cheated, the\r\ncandidate, or the people who vote for him? If the solemn and deliberate\r\nlanguage of resolutions is to be interpreted by contraries, what rule\r\nof hermeneutics shall we apply to the letter of a candidate? If the\r\nConvention meant precisely what they did not say, have we any assurance\r\nthat the aspirant has not said precisely what he did not mean? Two\r\nnegatives may constitute an affirmative, but surely the affirmation of\r\ntwo contradictory propositions by parties to the same bargain assures\r\nnothing but misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were adopted with but four dissenting votes; their\r\nmeaning was obvious, and the whole country understood it to be peace on\r\nany conditions that would be condescended to at Richmond. If a nation\r\nwere only a contrivance to protect men in gathering gear, if territory\r\nmeant only so many acres for the raising of crops, if power were of\r\nworth only as a police to prevent or punish crimes against person and\r\nproperty, then peace for the mere sake of peace were the one desirable\r\nthing for a people whose only history would be written in its\r\ncash-book. But if a nation be a living unity, leaning on the past by\r\ntradition, and reaching toward the future by continued aspiration and\r\nachievement,--if territory be of value for the raising of men formed to\r\nhigh aims and inspired to noble deeds by that common impulse which,\r\nspringing from a national ideal, gradually takes authentic shape in a\r\nnational character,--if power be but a gross and earthy bulk till it be\r\nensouled with thought and purpose, and of worth only as the guardian\r\nand promoter of truth and justice among men,--then there are\r\nmisfortunes worse than war and blessings greater than peace. At this\r\nmoment, not the Democratic party only, but the whole country, longs for\r\npeace, and the difference is merely as to the price that shall be paid\r\nfor it. Shall we pay in degradation, and sue for a cessation of\r\nhostilities which would make chaos the rule and order the exception,\r\nwhich would not be peace, but toleration, not the repose of manly\r\nsecurity, but the helpless quiet of political death? Or shall we pay,\r\nin a little more present suffering, self-sacrifice, and earnestness of\r\npurpose, for a peace that shall be as lasting as honorable, won as it\r\nwill be by the victory of right over wrong, and resting on the promise\r\nof God and the hope of man? We believe the country has already made up\r\nits mind as to the answer, and will prove that a democracy may have as\r\nclear a conception of its interests and duties, as fixed a purpose in\r\ndefending the one and fulfilling the other, a will as united and\r\nprompt, as have hitherto been supposed to characterize forms of\r\ngovernment where the interests were more personal and the power less\r\ndiffused.\r\n\r\nFortunately, though some of General McClellan's indiscreet friends\r\nwould make the coming election to turn upon his personal quarrel with\r\nthe administration, the question at issue between the two parties which\r\nseek to shape the policy of the country is one which manifestly\r\ntranscends all lesser considerations, and must be discussed in the\r\nhigher atmosphere of principle, by appeals to the reason, and not the\r\npassions, of the people. However incongruous with each other in opinion\r\nthe candidates of the Democratic party may be, in point of\r\nrespectability they are unexceptionable. It is true, as one of the\r\ncandidates represents war and the other peace, and \"when two men ride\r\non one horse, one must ride behind,\" that it is of some consequence to\r\nknow which is to be in the saddle and which on the croup; but we will\r\ntake it for granted that General McClellan will have no more delicacy\r\nabout the opinions of Mr. Pendleton than he has shown for those of the\r\nConvention. Still, we should remember that the General may be imprudent\r\nenough to die, as General Harrison and General Taylor did before him,\r\nand that Providence may again make \"of our pleasant vices whips to\r\nscourge us.\" We shall say nothing of the sectional aspect of the\r\nnomination, for we do not believe that what we deemed a pitiful\r\nelectioneering clamor, when raised against our own candidates four\r\nyears ago, becomes reasonable argument in opposing those of our\r\nadversaries now. The point of interest, then, is simply this: What can\r\nGeneral McClellan accomplish for the country which Mr. Lincoln has\r\nfailed to accomplish? In what respect would their policies differ? And,\r\nsupposing them to differ, which would be most consistent with the honor\r\nand permanent well-being of the nation?\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, in his letter of acceptance,[5] assumes that, in\r\nnominating him, \"the record of his public life was kept in view\" by the\r\nConvention. This will enable us to define with some certainty the\r\npoints on which his policy would be likely to differ from that of Mr.\r\nLincoln. He agrees with him that the war was a matter of necessity, not\r\nof choice. He agrees with him in assuming a right to emancipate slaves\r\nas a matter of military expediency, differing only as to the method and\r\nextent of its application,--a mere question of judgment. He agrees\r\nwith, him as to the propriety of drafting men for the public service,\r\nhaving, indeed, been the first to recommend a draft of men whom he was\r\nto command himself. He agrees with him that it is not only lawful, but\r\npolitic, to make arrests without the ordinary forms of law where the\r\npublic safety requires it, and himself both advised and accomplished\r\nthe seizure of an entire Legislature. So far there is no essential\r\ndifference, and beyond this we find very little, except that Mr.\r\nLincoln was in a position where he was called on to act with a view to\r\nthe public welfare, and General McClellan in one where he could express\r\nabstract opinions, without the responsibility of trial, to be used\r\nhereafter for partisan purposes as a part of his \"record.\" For example,\r\njust after his failure to coerce the State of Virginia, he took\r\noccasion to instruct his superiors in their duty, and, among other\r\nthings, stated his opinion that the war \"should not be a war looking to\r\nthe subjugation of the people of any State,\" but \"should be against\r\narmed forces and political organizations.\" The whole question of the\r\nright to \"coerce a sovereign State\" appears to have arisen from a\r\nconfusion of the relations of a State to its own internal policy and to\r\nthe general government. But a State is certainly a \"political\r\norganization,\" and, if we understand General McClellan rightly, he\r\nwould coerce a State, but not the people of it,--a distinction which we\r\nhope he appreciates better than its victims would be likely to do. We\r\nfind here also no diversity in principle between the two men, only that\r\nMr. Lincoln has been compelled to do, while General McClellan has had\r\nthe easier task of telling us what he would do. After the Peninsular\r\ncampaign, we cannot but think that even the latter would have been\r\ninclined to say, with the wisest man that ever spoke in our tongue, \"If\r\nto do were as easy as to know what 'twere good to do, chapels had been\r\nchurches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.\"\r\n\r\n      [5] This letter was published in the public journals 9 September.\r\n\r\nThe single question of policy on which General McClellan differs from\r\nMr. Lincoln, stripped of the conventional phrases in which he drapes\r\nit, is Slavery. He can mean nothing else when he talks of \"conciliation\r\nand compromise,\" of receiving back any State that may choose to return\r\n\"with a full guaranty of all its constitutional rights.\" If it be true\r\nthat a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, it is equally true\r\nthat there is a certain species of toadstool that would be none the\r\nless disgusting under whatever _alias_. Compromise and conciliation\r\nare both excellent things in their own way, and in the fitting time and\r\nplace, but right cannot be compromised without surrendering it, and to\r\nattempt conciliation by showing the white feather ends, not in\r\nreconcilement, but subjection. The combined ignorance of the Seven\r\nSleepers of Ephesus as to what had been going on while they were in\r\ntheir cavern would hardly equal that of General McClellan alone as to\r\nthe political history of the country. In the few months between Mr.\r\nLincoln's election and the attack on Fort Sumter we tried conciliation\r\nin every form, carrying it almost to the verge of ignominy. The\r\nSouthern leaders would have none of it. They saw in it only a\r\nconfession of weakness, and were but the more arrogant in their demand\r\nof all or nothing. Compromise we tried for three quarters of a century,\r\nand it brought us to where we are, for it was only a fine name for\r\ncowardice, and invited aggression. And now that the patient is dying of\r\nthis drench of lukewarm water, Doctor Sangrado McClellan gravely\r\nprescribes another gallon. If that fail to finish him, why, give him a\r\ngallon more.\r\n\r\nWe wish it were as easy to restore General McClellan's army to what it\r\nwas before the Peninsular campaign as he seems to think it is to put\r\nthe country back where it was at the beginning of the war. The war, it\r\nis true, was undertaken to assert the sovereignty of the Constitution,\r\nbut the true cause of quarrel was, not that the South denied the\r\nsupremacy of that instrument, but that they claimed the sole right to\r\ninterpret it, and to interpret it in a sense hostile to the true ideal\r\nof the country, and the clear interests of the people. But\r\ncircumstances have changed, and what was at first a struggle to\r\nmaintain the outward form of our government has become a contest to\r\npreserve the life and assert the supreme will of the nation. Even in\r\nApril, 1861, underneath that desire for legal sanction common to our\r\nrace, which expressed itself in loyalty to the Constitution, there was\r\nan instinctive feeling that the very germinating principle of our\r\nnationality was at stake, and that unity of territory was but another\r\nname for unity of idea; nay, was impossible without it, and undesirable\r\nif it were possible. It was not against the Constitution that the\r\nRebels declared war, but against free institutions; and if they are\r\nbeaten, they must submit to the triumph of those institutions. Their\r\nonly chance of constitutional victory was at the polls. They rejected\r\nit, though it was in their grasp, and now it is for us, and not them,\r\nto dictate terms. After all the priceless blood they have shed, General\r\nMcClellan would say to them, \"Come back and rule us.\" Mr. Lincoln says,\r\n\"Come back as equals, with every avenue of power open to you that is\r\nopen to us; but the advantage which the slaveholding interest wrung\r\nfrom the weakness of the fathers your own madness has forfeited to the\r\nsons.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan tells us that if the war had been conducted \"in\r\naccordance with those principles which he took occasion to declare when\r\nin active service, reconciliation would have been easy.\" We suppose he\r\nrefers to his despatch of July 7th, 1862, when, having just\r\ndemonstrated his incapacity in the profession for which he had been\r\neducated, he kindly offered to take the civil policy of the country\r\nunder his direction, expecting, perhaps, to be more successful in a\r\ntask for which he was fitted neither by training nor experience. It is\r\ntrue he had already been spoken of as a possible candidate for the\r\nPresidency, and that despatch was probably written to be referred to\r\nafterwards as part of the \"record\" to which he alludes in his recent\r\nletter. Indeed, he could have had no other conceivable object in so\r\nimpertinent a proceeding, for, up to that time, the war had been\r\nconducted on the very principles he recommended; nay, was so conducted\r\nfor six months longer, till it was demonstrated that reconciliation was\r\nnot to be had on those terms, and that victory was incompatible with\r\nthem. Mr. Lincoln was forced into what General McClellan calls a\r\nradical policy by the necessity of the case. The Rebels themselves\r\ninsisted on convincing him that his choice was between that and\r\nfailure. They boasted that slavery was their bulwark and arsenal; that,\r\nwhile every Northern soldier withdrew so much from the productive\r\nindustry of the Union, every fighting-man at the South could be brought\r\ninto the field, so long as the negroes were left to do the work that\r\nwas to feed and clothe him. Were these negroes property? The laws of\r\nwar justified us in appropriating them to our own use. Were they\r\npopulation? The laws of war equally justified us in appealing to them\r\nfor aid in a cause which was their own more than it was ours. It was so\r\nmuch the worse for the South that its property was of a kind that could\r\nbe converted from chattels into men, and from men into soldiers, by the\r\nscratch of a pen. The dragon's teeth were not of our sowing, but, so\r\nfar from our being under any obligation not to take into our service\r\nthe army that sprang from them, it would have been the extreme of\r\nweakness and folly not to do it. If there be no provision in the\r\nConstitution for emancipating the negroes, neither is there any for\r\ntaking Richmond; and we give General McClellan too much credit for\r\nintelligence and patriotism to suppose that if, when he asked for a\r\nhundred thousand more men at Harrison's Bar, he had been told that he\r\ncould have black ones, he would have refused them.\r\n\r\nBut supposing the very improbable chance of General McClellan's\r\nelection to the Presidency, how would he set about his policy of\r\nconciliation? Would he disarm the colored troops? In favor of\r\nprosecuting the war, as he declares himself to be, this would only\r\nnecessitate the draft of just so many white ones in their stead. Would\r\nhe recall the proclamation of freedom? This would only be to incite a\r\nservile insurrection. The people have already suffered too much by\r\nGeneral McClellan's genius for retreat, to follow him in another even\r\nmore disastrous. But it is idle to suppose that the Rebels are to be\r\nappeased by any exhibition of weakness. Like other men, they would take\r\nfresh courage from it. Force is the only argument to which they are in\r\na condition to listen, and, like other men, they will yield to it at\r\nlast, if it prove irresistible. We cannot think that General McClellan\r\nwould wish to go down to posterity as the President who tried to\r\nrestore the Union by the reenslaving of men who had fought in its\r\ndefence, and had failed in the attempt. We doubt if he had any very\r\nclear conception of what he meant by conciliation and compromise,\r\nexcept as a gloss to make the unconditional surrender doctrine of the\r\nChicago Convention a little less odious. If he meant more, if he hoped\r\nto gain political strength by an appeal to the old pro-slavery\r\nprejudices of the country, he merely shows the same unfortunate\r\nunconsciousness of the passage of time, and the changes it brings with\r\nit, that kept him in the trenches at Yorktown till his own defeat\r\nbecame inevitable. Perhaps he believes that the Rebels would accept\r\nfrom him what they rejected with contempt when offered by Mr.\r\nLincoln,--that they would do in compliment to him what they refused to\r\ndo from the interest of self-preservation. If they did, it would simply\r\nprove that they were in a condition to submit to terms, and not to\r\ndictate them. If they listened to his advances, their cause must be so\r\nhopeless that it would be a betrayal of his trust to make them. If they\r\nwere obstinate, he would be left with the same war on his hands which\r\nhas forced Mr. Lincoln into all his measures, and which would not be\r\nless exacting on himself. As a peace candidate he might solicit votes\r\nwith some show of reason, but on a war platform we see no good reason\r\nfor displacing Mr. Lincoln in his favor except on personal grounds; and\r\nwe fear that our campaigns would hardly be conducted with vigor under a\r\nPresident whom the people should have invested with the office by way\r\nof poultice for his bruised sensibilities as a defeated commander. Once\r\nin the Presidential chair, with a country behind him insisting on a\r\nre-establishment of the Union, and a rebellion before him deaf to all\r\noffers from a government that faltered in its purposes, we do not see\r\nwhat form of conciliation he would hit upon by which to persuade a\r\nrefractory \"political organization,\" except that practised by Hood's\r\nbutcher when he was advised to try it on a drove of sheep.\r\n\r\n                \"He seized upon the foremost wether,\r\n    And hugged and lugged and tugged him neck and crop,\r\n    Just _nolens volens_ through the open shop\r\n    (If tails came off he did not care a feather);\r\n    Then, walking to the door and smiling grim,\r\n    He rubbed his forehead and his sleeve together,--\r\n           There! I've _con_ciliated him!'\"\r\n\r\nIt is idle, however, to think of allaying angry feeling or appeasing\r\nresentment while the war lasts, and idler to hope for any permanent\r\nsettlement, except in the complete subjugation of the rebellion. There\r\nare persons who profess to be so much shocked at the _word_ subjugation\r\nas to be willing that we should have immediate experience of the\r\n_thing_, by receiving back the Rebels on their own conditions. Mr.\r\nLincoln has already proclaimed an amnesty wide enough to satisfy the\r\ndemands of the most exacting humanity, and they must reckon on a\r\nsingular stupidity in their hearers who impute ferocious designs to a\r\nman who cannot nerve his mind to the shooting of a deserter or the\r\nhanging of a spy. Mr. Lincoln, in our judgment, has shown from the\r\nfirst the considerate wisdom of a practical statesman. If he has been\r\nsometimes slow in making up his mind, it has saved him the necessity of\r\nbeing hasty to change it when once made up, and he has waited till the\r\ngradual movement of the popular sentiment should help him to his\r\nconclusions and sustain him in them. To be moderate and unimpassioned\r\nin revolutionary times that kindle natures of more flimsy texture to a\r\nblaze may not be a romantic quality, but it is a rare one, and goes\r\nwith those massive understandings on which a solid structure of\r\nachievement may be reared. Mr. Lincoln is a long-headed and\r\nlong-purposed man, who knows when he is ready,--a secret General\r\nMcClellan never learned. That he should be accused of playing Cromwell\r\nby the Opposition, and reproached with not being Cromwellian enough by\r\nthe more ardent of his own supporters, is proof enough that his action\r\nhas been of that firm but deliberate temper best suited to troublous\r\ntimes and to constitutional precedents. One of these accusations is the\r\nunworthy fetch of a party at a loss for argument, and the other springs\r\nfrom that exaggerated notion of the power of some exceptional\r\ncharacters upon events which Carlyle has made fashionable, but which\r\nwas never even approximately true except in times when there was no\r\nsuch thing as public opinion, and of which there is no record personal\r\nenough to assure us what we are to believe. A more sincere man than\r\nCromwell never lived, yet they know little of his history who do not\r\nknow that his policy was forced to trim between Independents and\r\nPresbyterians, and that he so far healed the wounds of civil war as to\r\nmake England dreaded without satisfying either. We have seen no reason\r\nto change our opinion of Mr. Lincoln since his wary scrupulousness won\r\nhim the applause of one party, or his decided action, when he was at\r\nlast convinced of its necessity, made him the momentary idol of the\r\nother. We will not call him a great man, for over-hasty praise is too\r\napt to sour at last into satire, and greatness may be trusted safely to\r\nhistory and the future; but an honest one we believe him to be, and\r\nwith no aim save to repair the glory and greatness of his country.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately it is no trial of the personal merits of opposing\r\ncandidates on which the next election is to pronounce a verdict. The\r\nmen set up by the two parties represent principles utterly\r\nantagonistic, and so far-reaching in their consequences that all\r\npersonal considerations and contemporary squabbles become as\r\ncontemptible in appearance as they always are in reality. However\r\nGeneral McClellan may equivocate and strive to hide himself in a cloud\r\nof ink, the man who represents the party that deliberately and\r\nunanimously adopted the Chicago Platform is the practical embodiment of\r\nthe principles contained in it. By ignoring the platform, he seems, it\r\nis true, to nominate himself; but this, though it may be good evidence\r\nof his own presumption, affords no tittle of proof that he could have\r\nbeen successful at Chicago without some distinct previous pledges of\r\nwhat his policy would be. If no such pledges were given, then the\r\nConvention nominated him with a clear persuasion that he was the sort\r\nof timber out of which tools are made. If they were not given, does not\r\nthe acceptance of the nomination under false pretences imply a certain\r\nsacrifice of personal honor? And will the honor of the country be safe\r\nin the hands of a man who is careless of his own? General McClellan's\r\nelection will be understood by the South and by the whole country as an\r\nacknowledgment of the right of secession,--an acknowledgment which will\r\nresolve the United States into an association for insurance against any\r\nrisk of national strength and greatness by land or sea. Mr. Lincoln, on\r\nthe other hand, is the exponent of principles vital to our peace,\r\ndignity, and renown,--of all that can save America from becoming\r\nMexico, and insure popular freedom for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nIt is the merest electioneering trick to say that the war has been\r\nturned from its original intention, as if this implied that a cheat had\r\nthereby been put upon the country. The truth is, that the popular\r\nunderstanding has been gradually enlightened as to the real causes of\r\nthe war, and, in consequence of that enlightenment, a purpose has grown\r\nup, defining itself slowly into clearer consciousness, to finish the\r\nwar in the only way that will keep it finished, by rooting out the evil\r\nprinciple from which it sprang. The country has been convinced that a\r\nsettlement which should stop short of this would be nothing more than a\r\ntruce favorable only to the weaker party in the struggle, to the very\r\ncriminals who forced it upon us. The single question is, Shall we have\r\npeace by submission or by victory? General McClellan's election insures\r\nthe one, Mr. Lincoln's gives us our only chance of the other. It is\r\nSlavery, and not the Southern people, that is our enemy; we must\r\nconquer this to be at peace with them. With the relations of the\r\nseveral States of the Rebel Confederacy to the Richmond government we\r\nhave nothing to do; but to say that, after being beaten as foreign\r\nenemies, they are to resume their previous relations to our own\r\ngovernment as if nothing had happened, seems to us a manifest\r\nabsurdity. From whom would General McClellan, if elected under his plan\r\nof conciliation, exact the penalties of rebellion? The States cannot be\r\npunished, and the only merciful way in which we can reach the real\r\ncriminals is by that very policy of emancipation whose efficacy is\r\nproved by the bitter opposition of all the allies of the Rebellion in\r\nthe North. This is a punishment which will not affect the independence\r\nof individual States, which will improve the condition of the mass of\r\nthe Southern population, and which alone will remove the rock of\r\noffence from the pathway of democratic institutions. So long as slavery\r\nis left, there is antipathy between the two halves of the country, and\r\nthe recurrence of actual war will be only a question of time. It is the\r\nnature of evil to be aggressive. Without moral force in itself, it is\r\ndriven, by the necessity of things, to seek material props. It cannot\r\nmake peace with truth, if it would. Good, on the other hand, is by its\r\nvery nature peaceful. Strong in itself, strong in the will of God and\r\nthe sympathy of man, its conquests are silent and beneficent as those\r\nof summer, warming into life, and bringing to blossom and fruitage,\r\nwhatever is wholesome in men and the institutions of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n1864-1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been many painful crises since the impatient vanity of South\r\nCarolina hurried ten prosperous Commonwealths into a crime whose\r\nassured retribution was to leave them either at the mercy of the nation\r\nthey had wronged, or of the anarchy they had summoned but could not\r\ncontrol, when no thoughtful American opened his morning paper without\r\ndreading to find that he had no longer a country to love and honor.\r\nWhatever the result of the convulsion whose first shocks were beginning\r\nto be felt, there would still be enough square miles of earth for\r\nelbow-room; but that ineffable sentiment made up of memory and hope, of\r\ninstinct and tradition, which swells every man's heart and shapes his\r\nthought, though perhaps never present to his consciousness, would be\r\ngone from it, leaving it common earth and nothing more. Men might\r\ngather rich crops from it, but that ideal harvest of priceless\r\nassociations would be reaped no longer; that fine virtue which sent up\r\nmessages of courage and security from every sod of it would have\r\nevaporated beyond recall. We should be irrevocably cut off from our\r\npast, and be forced to splice the ragged ends of our lives upon\r\nwhatever new conditions chance might leave dangling for us.\r\n\r\nWe confess that we had our doubts at first whether the patriotism of\r\nour people were not too narrowly provincial to embrace the proportions\r\nof national peril. We felt an only too natural distrust of immense\r\npublic meetings and enthusiastic cheers.\r\n\r\nThat a reaction should follow the holiday enthusiasm with which the war\r\nwas entered on, that it should follow soon, and that the slackening of\r\npublic spirit should be proportionate to the previous over-tension,\r\nmight well be foreseen by all who had studied human nature or history.\r\nMen acting gregariously are always in extremes. As they are one moment\r\ncapable of higher courage, so they are liable, the next, to baser\r\ndepression, and it is often a matter of chance whether numbers shall\r\nmultiply confidence or discouragement. Nor does deception lead more\r\nsurely to distrust of men than self-deception to suspicion of\r\nprinciples. The only faith that wears well and holds its color in all\r\nweathers is that which is woven of conviction and set with the sharp\r\nmordant of experience. Enthusiasm is good material for the orator, but\r\nthe statesman needs something more durable to work in,--must be able to\r\nrely on the deliberate reason and consequent firmness of the people,\r\nwithout which that presence of mind, no less essential in times of\r\nmoral than of material peril, will be wanting at the critical moment.\r\nWould this fervor of the Free States hold out? Was it kindled by a just\r\nfeeling of the value of constitutional liberty? Had it body enough to\r\nwithstand the inevitable dampening of checks, reverses, delays? Had our\r\npopulation intelligence enough to comprehend that the choice was\r\nbetween order and anarchy, between the equilibrium of a government by\r\nlaw and the tussle of misrule by _pronunciamiento_? Could a war be\r\nmaintained without the ordinary stimulus of hatred and plunder, and\r\nwith the impersonal loyalty of principle? These were serious questions,\r\nand with no precedent to aid in answering them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abraham Lincoln_]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war there was, indeed, occasion for the most\r\nanxious apprehension. A President known to be infected with the\r\npolitical heresies, and suspected of sympathy with the treason, of the\r\nSouthern conspirators, had just surrendered the reins, we will not say\r\nof power, but of chaos, to a successor known only as the representative\r\nof a party whose leaders, with long training in opposition, had none in\r\nthe conduct of affairs; an empty treasury was called on to supply\r\nresources beyond precedent in the history of finance; the trees were\r\nyet growing and the iron unmined with, which a navy was to be built and\r\narmored; officers without discipline were to make a mob into an army;\r\nand, above all, the public opinion of Europe, echoed and reinforced\r\nwith every vague hint and every specious argument of despondency by a\r\npowerful faction at home, was either contemptuously sceptical or\r\nactively hostile. It would be hard to over-estimate the force of this\r\nlatter element of disintegration and discouragement among a people\r\nwhere every citizen at home, and every soldier in the field, is a\r\nreader of newspapers. The pedlers of rumor in the North were the most\r\neffective allies of the rebellion. A nation can be liable to no more\r\ninsidious treachery than that of the telegraph, sending hourly its\r\nelectric thrill of panic along the remotest nerves of the community,\r\ntill the excited imagination makes every real danger loom heightened\r\nwith its unreal double.\r\n\r\nAnd even if we look only at more palpable difficulties, the problem to\r\nbe solved by our civil war was so vast, both in its immediate relations\r\nand its future consequences; the conditions of its solution were so\r\nintricate and so greatly dependent on incalculable and uncontrollable\r\ncontingencies; so many of the data, whether for hope or fear, were,\r\nfrom their novelty, incapable of arrangement under any of the\r\ncategories of historical precedent, that there were moments of crisis\r\nwhen the firmest believer in the strength and sufficiency of the\r\ndemocratic theory of government might well hold his breath in vague\r\napprehension of disaster. Our teachers of political philosophy,\r\nsolemnly arguing from the precedent of some petty Grecian, Italian, or\r\nFlemish city, whose long periods of aristocracy were broken now and\r\nthen by awkward parentheses of mob, had always taught us that\r\ndemocracies were incapable of the sentiment of loyalty, of concentrated\r\nand prolonged effort, of far-reaching conceptions; were absorbed in\r\nmaterial interests; impatient of regular, and much more of exceptional\r\nrestraint; had no natural nucleus of gravitation, nor any forces but\r\ncentrifugal; were always on the verge of civil war, and slunk at last\r\ninto the natural almshouse of bankrupt popular government, a military\r\ndespotism. Here was indeed a dreary outlook for persons who knew\r\ndemocracy, not by rubbing shoulders with it lifelong, but merely from\r\nbooks, and America only by the report of some fellow-Briton, who,\r\nhaving eaten a bad dinner or lost a carpet-bag here, had written to the\r\n\"Times\" demanding redress, and drawing a mournful inference of\r\ndemocratic instability. Nor were men wanting among ourselves who had so\r\nsteeped their brains in London literature as to mistake Cockneyism for\r\nEuropean culture, and contempt of their country for cosmopolitan\r\nbreadth of view, and who, owing all they had and all they were to\r\ndemocracy, thought it had an air of high-breeding to join in the\r\nshallow epicedium that our bubble had burst.\r\n\r\nBut beside any disheartening influences which might affect the timid or\r\nthe despondent, there were reasons enough of settled gravity against\r\nany over-confidence of hope. A war--which, whether we consider the\r\nexpanse of the territory at stake, the hosts brought into the field, or\r\nthe reach of the principles involved, may fairly be reckoned the most\r\nmomentous of modern times--was to be waged by a people divided at home,\r\nunnerved by fifty years of peace, under a chief magistrate without\r\nexperience and without reputation, whose every measure was sure to be\r\ncunningly hampered by a jealous and unscrupulous minority, and who,\r\nwhile dealing with unheard-of complications at home, must soothe a\r\nhostile neutrality abroad, waiting only a pretext to become war. All\r\nthis was to be done without warning and without preparation, while at\r\nthe same time a social revolution was to be accomplished in the\r\npolitical condition of four millions of people, by softening the\r\nprejudices, allaying the fears, and gradually obtaining the\r\ncooperation, of their unwilling liberators. Surely, if ever there were\r\nan occasion when the heightened imagination of the historian might see\r\nDestiny visibly intervening in human affairs, here was a knot worthy of\r\nher shears. Never, perhaps, was any system of government tried by so\r\ncontinuous and searching a strain as ours during the last three years;\r\nnever has any shown itself stronger; and never could that strength be\r\nso directly traced to the virtue and intelligence of the people,--to\r\nthat general enlightenment and prompt efficiency of public opinion\r\npossible only under the influence of a political framework like our\r\nown. We find it hard to understand how even a foreigner should be blind\r\nto the grandeur of the combat of ideas that has been going on here,--to\r\nthe heroic energy, persistency, and self-reliance of a nation proving\r\nthat it knows how much dearer greatness is than mere power; and we own\r\nthat it is impossible for us to conceive the mental and moral condition\r\nof the American who does not feel his spirit braced and heightened by\r\nbeing even a spectator of such qualities and achievements. That a\r\nsteady purpose and a definite aim have been given to the jarring forces\r\nwhich, at the beginning of the war, spent themselves in the discussion\r\nof schemes which could only become operative, if at all, after the war\r\nwas over; that a popular excitement has been slowly intensified into an\r\nearnest national will; that a somewhat impracticable moral sentiment\r\nhas been made the unconscious instrument of a practical moral end; that\r\nthe treason of covert enemies, the jealousy of rivals, the unwise zeal\r\nof friends, have been made not only useless for mischief, but even\r\nuseful for good; that the conscientious sensitiveness of England to the\r\nhorrors of civil conflict has been prevented from complicating a\r\ndomestic with a foreign war;--all these results, any one of which might\r\nsuffice to prove greatness in a ruler, have been mainly due to the good\r\nsense, the good-humor, the sagacity, the large--mindedness, and the\r\nunselfish honesty of the unknown man whom a blind fortune, as it\r\nseemed, had lifted from the crowd to the most dangerous and difficult\r\neminence of modern times. It is by presence of mind in untried\r\nemergencies that the native metal of a man is tested; it is by the\r\nsagacity to see, and the fearless honesty to admit, whatever of truth\r\nthere may be in an adverse opinion, in order more convincingly to\r\nexpose the fallacy that lurks behind it, that a reasoner at length\r\ngains for his mere statement of a fact the force of argument; it is by\r\na wise forecast which allows hostile combinations to go so far as by\r\nthe inevitable reaction to become elements of his own power, that a\r\npolitician proves his genius for state-craft; and especially it is by\r\nso gently guiding public sentiment that he seems to follow it, by so\r\nyielding doubtful points that he can be firm without seeming obstinate\r\nin essential ones, and thus gain the advantages of compromise without\r\nthe weakness of concession; by so instinctively comprehending the\r\ntemper and prejudices of a people as to make them gradually conscious\r\nof the superior wisdom of his freedom from temper and prejudice,--it is\r\nby qualities such as these that a magistrate shows himself worthy to be\r\nchief in a commonwealth of freemen. And it is for qualities such as\r\nthese that we firmly believe History will rank Mr. Lincoln among the\r\nmost prudent of statesmen and the most successful of rulers. If we wish\r\nto appreciate him, we have only to conceive the inevitable chaos in\r\nwhich we should now be weltering, had a weak man or an unwise one been\r\nchosen in his stead.\r\n\r\n\"Bare is back,\" says the Norse proverb, \"without brother behind it\";\r\nand this is, by analogy, true of an elective magistracy. The hereditary\r\nruler in any critical emergency may reckon on the inexhaustible\r\nresources of _prestige_, of sentiment, of superstition, of dependent\r\ninterest, while the new man must slowly and painfully create all these\r\nout of the unwilling material around him, by superiority of character,\r\nby patient singleness of purpose, by sagacious presentiment of popular\r\ntendencies and instinctive sympathy with the national character. Mr.\r\nLincoln's task was one of peculiar and exceptional difficulty. Long\r\nhabit had accustomed the American people to the notion of a party in\r\npower, and of a President as its creature and organ, while the more\r\nvital fact, that the executive for the time being represents the\r\nabstract idea of government as a permanent principle superior to all\r\nparty and all private interest, had gradually become unfamiliar. They\r\nhad so long seen the public policy more or less directed by views of\r\nparty, and often even of personal advantage, as to be ready to suspect\r\nthe motives of a chief magistrate compelled, for the first time in our\r\nhistory, to feel himself the head and hand of a great nation, and to\r\nact upon the fundamental maxim, laid down by all publicists, that the\r\nfirst duty of a government is to defend and maintain its own existence.\r\nAccordingly, a powerful weapon seemed to be put into the hands of the\r\nopposition by the necessity under which the administration found itself\r\nof applying this old truth to new relations. Nor were the opposition\r\nhis only nor his most dangerous opponents.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans had carried the country upon an issue in which ethics\r\nwere more directly and visibly mingled with politics than usual. Their\r\nleaders were trained to a method of oratory which relied for its effect\r\nrather on the moral sense than the understanding. Their arguments were\r\ndrawn, not so much from experience as from general principles of right\r\nand wrong. When the war came, their system continued to be applicable\r\nand effective, for here again the reason of the people was to be\r\nreached and kindled through their sentiments. It was one of those\r\nperiods of excitement, gathering, contagious, universal, which, while\r\nthey last, exalt and clarify the minds of men, giving to the mere words\r\n_country_, _human rights_, _democracy_, a meaning and a force beyond\r\nthat of sober and logical argument. They were convictions, maintained\r\nand defended by the supreme logic of passion. That penetrating fire ran\r\nin and roused those primary instincts that make their lair in the dens\r\nand caverns of the mind. What is called the great popular heart was\r\nawakened, that indefinable something which may be, according to\r\ncircumstances, the highest reason or the most brutish unreason. But\r\nenthusiasm, once cold, can never be warmed over into anything better\r\nthan cant,--and phrases, when once the inspiration that filled them\r\nwith beneficent power has ebbed away, retain only that semblance of\r\nmeaning which enables them to supplant reason in hasty minds. Among the\r\nlessons taught by the French Revolution there is none sadder or more\r\nstriking than this, that you may make everything else out of the\r\npassions of men except a political system that will work, and that\r\nthere is nothing so pitilessly and unconsciously cruel as sincerity\r\nformulated into dogma. It is always demoralizing to extend the domain\r\nof sentiment over questions where it has no legitimate jurisdiction;\r\nand perhaps the severest strain upon Mr. Lincoln was in resisting a\r\ntendency of his own supporters which chimed with his own private\r\ndesires, while wholly opposed to his convictions of what would be wise\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe change which three years have brought about is too remarkable to be\r\npassed over without comment, too weighty in its lesson not to be laid\r\nto heart. Never did a President enter upon office with less means at\r\nhis command, outside his own strength of heart and steadiness of\r\nunderstanding, for inspiring confidence in the people, and so winning\r\nit for himself, than Mr. Lincoln. All that was known of him was that he\r\nwas a good stump-speaker, nominated for his _availability_,--that is,\r\nbecause he had no history,--and chosen by a party with whose more\r\nextreme opinions he was not in sympathy. It might well be feared that a\r\nman past fifty, against whom the ingenuity of hostile partisans could\r\nrake up no accusation, must be lacking in manliness of character, in\r\ndecision of principle, in strength of will; that a man who was at best\r\nonly the representative of a party, and who yet did not fairly\r\nrepresent even that, would fail of political, much more of popular,\r\nsupport. And certainly no one ever entered upon office with so few\r\nresources of power in the past, and so many materials of weakness in\r\nthe present, as Mr. Lincoln. Even in that half of the Union which\r\nacknowledged him as President, there was a large and at that time\r\ndangerous minority, that hardly admitted his claim to the office, and\r\neven in the party that elected him there was also a large minority that\r\nsuspected him of being secretly a communicant with the church of\r\nLaodicea. All that he did was sure to be virulently attacked as ultra\r\nby one side; all that he left undone, to be stigmatized as proof of\r\nlukewarmness and backsliding by the other. Meanwhile, he was to carry\r\non a truly colossal war by means of both; he was to disengage the\r\ncountry from diplomatic entanglements of unprecedented peril\r\nundisturbed by the help or the hindrance of either, and to win from the\r\ncrowning dangers of his administration, in the confidence of the\r\npeople, the means of his safety and their own. He has contrived to do\r\nit, and perhaps none of our Presidents since Washington has stood so\r\nfirm in the confidence of the people as he does after three years of\r\nstormy administration.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's policy was a tentative one, and rightly so. He laid down\r\nno programme which must compel him to be either inconsistent or unwise,\r\nno cast-iron theorem to which circumstances must be fitted as they\r\nrose, or else be useless to his ends. He seemed to have chosen\r\nMazarin's motto, _Le temps et moi_. The _moi_ to be sure, was not very\r\nprominent at first; but it has grown more and more so, till the world\r\nis beginning to be persuaded that it stands for a character of marked\r\nindividuality and capacity for affairs. Time was his prime-minister,\r\nand, we began to think, at one period, his general-in-chief also. At\r\nfirst he was so slow that he tired out all those who see no evidence of\r\nprogress but in blowing up the engine; then he was so fast, that he\r\ntook the breath away from those who think there is no getting on safely\r\nwhile there is a spark of fire under the boilers. God is the only being\r\nwho has time enough; but a prudent man, who knows how to seize\r\noccasion, can commonly make a shift to find as much as he needs. Mr.\r\nLincoln, as it seems to us in reviewing his career, though we have\r\nsometimes in our impatience thought otherwise, has always waited, as a\r\nwise man should, till the right moment brought up all his reserves.\r\n_Semper nocuit differre paratis_ is a sound axiom, but the really\r\nefficacious man will also be sure to know when he is _not_ ready, and\r\nbe firm against all persuasion and reproach till he is.\r\n\r\nOne would be apt to think, from some of the criticisms made on Mr.\r\nLincoln's course by those who mainly agree with him in principle, that\r\nthe chief object of a statesman should be rather to proclaim his\r\nadhesion to certain doctrines, than to achieve their triumph by quietly\r\naccomplishing his ends. In our opinion, there is no more unsafe\r\npolitician than a conscientiously rigid _doctrinaire_, nothing more\r\nsure to end in disaster than a theoretic scheme of policy that admits\r\nof no pliability for contingencies. True, there is a popular image of\r\nan impossible He, in whose plastic hands the submissive destinies of\r\nmankind become as wax, and to whose commanding necessity the toughest\r\nfacts yield with the graceful pliancy of fiction; but in real life we\r\ncommonly find that the men who control circumstances, as it is called,\r\nare those who have learned to allow for the influence of their eddies,\r\nand have the nerve to turn them to account at the happy instant. Mr.\r\nLincoln's perilous task has been to carry a rather shaky raft through\r\nthe rapids, making fast the unrulier logs as he could snatch\r\nopportunity, and the country is to be congratulated that he did not\r\nthink it his duty to run straight at all hazards, but cautiously to\r\nassure himself with his setting-pole where the main current was, and\r\nkeep steadily to that. He is still in wild water, but we have faith\r\nthat his skill and sureness of eye will bring him out right at last.\r\n\r\nA curious, and, as we think, not inapt parallel might be drawn between\r\nMr. Lincoln and one of the most striking figures in modern\r\nhistory,--Henry IV. of France. The career of the latter may be more\r\npicturesque, as that of a daring captain always is; but in all its\r\nvicissitudes there is nothing more romantic than that sudden change, as\r\nby a rub of Aladdin's lamp, from the attorney's office in a country\r\ntown of Illinois to the helm of a great nation in times like these. The\r\nanalogy between the characters and circumstances of the two men is in\r\nmany respects singularly close. Succeeding to a rebellion rather than a\r\ncrown, Henry's chief material dependence was the Huguenot party, whose\r\ndoctrines sat upon him with a looseness distasteful certainly, if not\r\nsuspicious, to the more fanatical among them. King only in name over\r\nthe greater part of France, and with his capital barred against him, it\r\nyet gradually became clear to the more far-seeing even of the Catholic\r\nparty that he was the only centre of order and legitimate authority\r\nround which France could reorganize itself. While preachers who held\r\nthe divine right of kings made the churches of Paris ring with\r\ndeclamations in favor of democracy rather than submit to the heretic\r\ndog of a Bearnois,--much as our _soi-disant_ Democrats have lately been\r\npreaching the divine right of slavery, and denouncing the heresies of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence,--Henry bore both parties in hand till\r\nhe was convinced that only one course of action could possibly combine\r\nhis own interests and those of France. Meanwhile the Protestants\r\nbelieved somewhat doubtfully that he was theirs, the Catholics hoped\r\nsomewhat doubtfully that he would be theirs, and Henry himself turned\r\naside remonstrance, advice, and curiosity alike with a jest or a\r\nproverb (if a little _high_, he liked them none the worse), joking\r\ncontinually as his manner was. We have seen Mr. Lincoln contemptuously\r\ncompared to Sancho Panza by persons incapable of appreciating one of\r\nthe deepest pieces of wisdom in the profoundest romance ever written;\r\nnamely, that, while Don Quixote was incomparable in theoretic and ideal\r\nstatesmanship, Sancho, with his stock of proverbs, the ready money of\r\nhuman experience, made the best possible practical governor. Henry IV.\r\nwas as full of wise saws and modern instances as Mr. Lincoln, but\r\nbeneath all this was the thoughtful, practical, humane, and thoroughly\r\nearnest man, around whom the fragments of France were to gather\r\nthemselves till she took her place again as a planet of the first\r\nmagnitude in the European system. In one respect Mr. Lincoln was more\r\nfortunate than Henry. However some may think him wanting in zeal, the\r\nmost fanatical can find no taint of apostasy in any measure of his, nor\r\ncan the most bitter charge him with being influenced by motives of\r\npersonal interest. The leading distinction between the policies of the\r\ntwo is one of circumstances. Henry went over to the nation; Mr. Lincoln\r\nhas steadily drawn the nation over to him. One left a united France;\r\nthe other, we hope and believe, will leave a reunited America. We leave\r\nour readers to trace the further points of difference and resemblance\r\nfor themselves, merely suggesting a general similarity which has often\r\noccurred to us. One only point of melancholy interest we will allow\r\nourselves to touch upon. That Mr. Lincoln is not handsome nor elegant,\r\nwe learn from certain English tourists who would consider similar\r\nrevelations in regard to Queen Victoria as thoroughly American in their\r\nwant of _bienseance_. It is no concern of ours, nor does it affect his\r\nfitness for the high place he so worthily occupies; but he is certainly\r\nas fortunate as Henry in the matter of good looks, if we may trust\r\ncontemporary evidence. Mr. Lincoln has also been reproached with\r\nAmericanism by some not unfriendly British critics; but, with all\r\ndeference, we cannot say that we like him any the worse for it, or see\r\nin it any reason why he should govern Americans the less wisely.\r\n\r\nPeople of more sensitive organizations may be shocked, but we are glad\r\nthat in this our true war of independence, which is to free us forever\r\nfrom the Old World, we have had at the head of our affairs a man whom\r\nAmerica made, as God made Adam, out of the very earth, unancestried,\r\nunprivileged, unknown, to show us how much truth, how much magnanimity,\r\nand how much state-craft await the call of opportunity in simple\r\nmanhood when it believes in the justice of God and the worth of man.\r\nConventionalities are all very well in their proper place, but they\r\nshrivel at the touch of nature like stubble in the fire. The genius\r\nthat sways a nation by its arbitrary will seems less august to us than\r\nthat which multiplies and reinforces itself in the instincts and\r\nconvictions of an entire people. Autocracy may have something in it\r\nmore melodramatic than this, but falls far short of it in human value\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nExperience would have bred in us a rooted distrust of improvised\r\nstatesmanship, even if we did not believe politics to be a science,\r\nwhich, if it cannot always command men of special aptitude and great\r\npowers, at least demands the long and steady application of the best\r\npowers of such men as it can command to master even its first\r\nprinciples. It is curious, that, in a country which boasts of its\r\nintelligence, the theory should be so generally held that the most\r\ncomplicated of human contrivances, and one which every day becomes more\r\ncomplicated, can be worked at sight by any man able to talk for an hour\r\nor two without stopping to think.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is sometimes claimed as an example of a ready-made ruler.\r\nBut no case could well be less in point; for, besides that he was a man\r\nof such fair-mindedness as is always the raw material of wisdom, he had\r\nin his profession a training precisely the opposite of that to which a\r\npartisan is subjected. His experience as a lawyer compelled him not\r\nonly to see that there is a principle underlying every phenomenon in\r\nhuman affairs, but that there are always two sides to every question,\r\nboth of which must be fully understood in order to understand either,\r\nand that it is of greater advantage to an advocate to appreciate the\r\nstrength than the weakness of his antagonist's position. Nothing is\r\nmore remarkable than the unerring tact with which, in his debate with\r\nMr. Douglas, he went straight to the reason of the question; nor have\r\nwe ever had a more striking lesson in political tactics than the fact,\r\nthat, opposed to a man exceptionally adroit in using popular prejudice\r\nand bigotry to his purpose, exceptionally unscrupulous in appealing to\r\nthose baser motives that turn a meeting of citizens into a mob of\r\nbarbarians, he should yet have won his case before a jury of the\r\npeople. Mr. Lincoln was as far as possible from an impromptu\r\npolitician. His wisdom was made up of a knowledge of things as well as\r\nof men; his sagacity resulted from a clear perception and honest\r\nacknowledgment of difficulties, which enabled him to see that the only\r\ndurable triumph of political opinion is based, not on any abstract\r\nright, but upon so much of justice, the highest attainable at any given\r\nmoment in human affairs, as may be had in the balance of mutual\r\nconcession. Doubtless he had an ideal, but it was the ideal of a\r\npractical statesman,--to aim at the best, and to take the next best, if\r\nhe is lucky enough to get even that. His slow, but singularly\r\nmasculine, intelligence taught him that precedent is only another name\r\nfor embodied experience, and that it counts for even more in the\r\nguidance of communities of men than in that of the individual life. He\r\nwas not a man who held it good public economy to pull down on the mere\r\nchance of rebuilding better. Mr. Lincoln's faith in God was qualified\r\nby a very well-founded distrust of the wisdom of man. Perhaps it was\r\nhis want of self-confidence that more than anything else won him the\r\nunlimited confidence of the people, for they felt that there would be\r\nno need of retreat from any position he had deliberately taken. The\r\ncautious, but steady, advance of his policy during the war was like\r\nthat of a Roman army. He left behind him a firm road on which public\r\nconfidence could follow; he took America with him where he went; what\r\nhe gained he occupied, and his advanced posts became colonies. The very\r\nhomeliness of his genius was its distinction. His kingship was\r\nconspicuous by its workday homespun. Never was ruler so absolute as he,\r\nnor so little conscious of it; for he was the incarnate common-sense of\r\nthe people. With all that tenderness of nature whose sweet sadness\r\ntouched whoever saw him with something of its own pathos, there was no\r\ntrace of sentimentalism in his speech or action. He seems to have had\r\nbut one rule of conduct, always that of practical and successful\r\npolitics, to let himself be guided by events, when they were sure to\r\nbring him out where he wished to go, though by what seemed to\r\nunpractical minds, which let go the possible to grasp at the desirable,\r\na longer road.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the highest function of statesmanship is by degrees to\r\naccommodate the conduct of communities to ethical laws, and to\r\nsubordinate the conflicting self-interests of the day to higher and\r\nmore permanent concerns. But it is on the understanding, and not on the\r\nsentiment, of a nation that all safe legislation must be based.\r\nVoltaire's saying, that \"a consideration of petty circumstances is the\r\ntomb of great things,\" may be true of individual men, but it certainly\r\nis not true of governments. It is by a multitude of such\r\nconsiderations, each in itself trifling, but all together weighty, that\r\nthe framers of policy can alone divine what is practicable and\r\ntherefore wise. The imputation of inconsistency is one to which every\r\nsound politician and every honest thinker must sooner or later subject\r\nhimself. The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion. The\r\ncourse of a great statesman resembles that of navigable rivers,\r\navoiding immovable obstacles with noble bends of concession, seeking\r\nthe broad levels of opinion on which men soonest settle and longest\r\ndwell, following and marking the almost imperceptible slopes of\r\nnational tendency, yet always aiming at direct advances, always\r\nrecruited from sources nearer heaven, and sometimes bursting open paths\r\nof progress and fruitful human commerce through what seem the eternal\r\nbarriers of both. It is loyalty to great ends, even though forced to\r\ncombine the small and opposing motives of selfish men to accomplish\r\nthem; it is the anchored cling to solid principles of duty and action,\r\nwhich knows how to swing with the tide, but is never carried away by\r\nit,--that we demand in public men, and not obstinacy in prejudice,\r\nsameness of policy, or a conscientious persistency in what is\r\nimpracticable. For the impracticable, however theoretically enticing,\r\nis always politically unwise, sound statesmanship being the application\r\nof that prudence to the public business which is the safest guide in\r\nthat of private men.\r\n\r\nNo doubt slavery was the most delicate and embarrassing question with\r\nwhich Mr. Lincoln was called on to deal, and it was one which no man in\r\nhis position, whatever his opinions, could evade; for, though he might\r\nwithstand the clamor of partisans, he must sooner or later yield to the\r\npersistent importunacy of circumstances, which thrust the problem upon\r\nhim at every turn and in every shape.\r\n\r\nIt has been brought against us as an accusation abroad, and repeated\r\nhere by people who measure their country rather by what is thought of\r\nit than by what it is, that our war has not been distinctly and\r\navowedly for the extinction of slavery, but a war rather for the\r\npreservation of our national power and greatness, in which the\r\nemancipation of the negro has been forced upon us by circumstances and\r\naccepted as a necessity. We are very far from denying this; nay, we\r\nadmit that it is so far true that we were slow to renounce our\r\nconstitutional obligations even toward those who had absolved us by\r\ntheir own act from the letter of our duty. We are speaking of the\r\ngovernment which, legally installed for the whole country, was bound,\r\nso long as it was possible, not to overstep the limits of orderly\r\nprescription, and could not, without abnegating its own very nature,\r\ntake the lead in making rebellion an excuse for resolution. There were,\r\nno doubt, many ardent and sincere persons who seemed to think this as\r\nsimple a thing to do as to lead off a Virginia reel. They forgot what\r\nshould be forgotten least of all in a system like ours, that the\r\nadministration for the time being represents not only the majority\r\nwhich elects it, but the minority as well,--a minority in this case\r\npowerful, and so little ready for emancipation that it was opposed even\r\nto war. Mr. Lincoln had not been chosen as general agent of an\r\nantislavery society, but President of the United States, to perform\r\ncertain functions exactly defined by law. Whatever were his wishes, it\r\nwas no less duty than policy to mark out for himself a line of action\r\nthat would not further distract the country, by raising before their\r\ntime questions which plainly would soon enough compel attention, and\r\nfor which every day was making the answer more easy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he must solve the riddle of this new Sphinx, or be devoured.\r\nThough Mr. Lincoln's policy in this critical affair has not been such\r\nas to satisfy those who demand an heroic treatment for even the most\r\ntrifling occasion, and who will not cut their coat according to their\r\ncloth, unless they can borrow the scissors of Atropos, it has been at\r\nleast not unworthy of the long-headed king of Ithaca. Mr. Lincoln had\r\nthe choice of Bassanio offered him. Which of the three caskets held the\r\nprize that was to redeem the fortunes of the country? There was the\r\ngolden one whose showy speciousness might have tempted a vain man; the\r\nsilver of compromise, which might have decided the choice of a merely\r\nacute one; and the leaden,--dull and homely looking, as prudence always\r\nis,--yet with something about it sure to attract the eye of practical\r\nwisdom. Mr. Lincoln dallied with his decision perhaps longer than\r\nseemed needful to those on whom its awful responsibility was not to\r\nrest, but when he made it, it was worthy of his cautious but\r\nsure-footed understanding. The moral of the Sphinx-riddle, and it is a\r\ndeep one, lies in the childish simplicity of the solution. Those who\r\nfail in guessing it, fail because they are over ingenious, and cast\r\nabout for an answer that shall suit their own notion of the gravity of\r\nthe occasion and of their own dignity, rather than the occasion itself.\r\n\r\nIn a matter which must be finally settled by public opinion, and in\r\nregard to which the ferment of prejudice and passion on both sides has\r\nnot yet subsided to that equilibrium of compromise from which alone a\r\nsound public opinion can result, it is proper enough for the private\r\ncitizen to press his own convictions with all possible force of\r\nargument and persuasion; but the popular magistrate, whose judgment\r\nmust become action, and whose action involves the whole country, is\r\nbound to wait till the sentiment of the people is so far advanced\r\ntoward his own point of view, that what he does shall find support in\r\nit, instead of merely confusing it with new elements of division. It\r\nwas not unnatural that men earnestly devoted to the saving of their\r\ncountry, and profoundly convinced that slavery was its only real enemy,\r\nshould demand a decided policy round which all patriots might\r\nrally,--and this might have been the wisest course for an absolute\r\nruler. But in the then unsettled state of the public mind, with a large\r\nparty decrying even resistance to the slaveholders' rebellion as not\r\nonly unwise, but even unlawful; with a majority, perhaps, even of the\r\nwould-be loyal so long accustomed to regard the Constitution as a deed\r\nof gift conveying to the South their own judgment as to policy and\r\ninstinct as to right, that they were in doubt at first whether their\r\nloyalty were due to the country or to slavery; and with a respectable\r\nbody of honest and influential men who still believed in the\r\npossibility of conciliation,--Mr. Lincoln judged wisely, that, in\r\nlaying down a policy in deference to one party, he should be giving to\r\nthe other the very fulcrum for which their disloyalty had been waiting.\r\n\r\nIt behooved a clear-headed man in his position not to yield so far to\r\nan honest indignation against the brokers of treason in the North as to\r\nlose sight of the materials for misleading which were their stock in\r\ntrade, and to forget that it is not the falsehood of sophistry which is\r\nto be feared, but the grain of truth mingled with it to make it\r\nspecious,--that it is not the knavery of the leaders so much as the\r\nhonesty of the followers they may seduce, that gives them power for\r\nevil. It was especially his duty to do nothing which might help the\r\npeople to forget the true cause of the war in fruitless disputes about\r\nits inevitable consequences.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of state rights can be so handled by an adroit demagogue\r\nas easily to confound the distinction between liberty and lawlessness\r\nin the minds of ignorant persons, accustomed always to be influenced by\r\nthe sound of certain words, rather than to reflect upon the principles\r\nwhich give them meaning. For, though Secession involves the manifest\r\nabsurdity of denying to a State the right of making war against any\r\nforeign power while permitting it against the United States; though it\r\nsupposes a compact of mutual concessions and guaranties among States\r\nwithout any arbiter in case of dissension; though it contradicts\r\ncommon-sense in assuming that the men who framed our government did not\r\nknow what they meant when they substituted Union for Confederation;\r\nthough it falsifies history, which shows that the main opposition to\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution was based on the argument that it did\r\nnot allow that independence in the several States which alone would\r\njustify them in seceding;--yet, as slavery was universally admitted to\r\nbe a reserved right, an inference could be drawn from any direct attack\r\nupon it (though only in self-defence) to a natural right of resistance,\r\nlogical enough to satisfy minds untrained to detect fallacy, as the\r\nmajority of men always are, and now too much disturbed by the disorder\r\nof the times to consider that the order of events had any legitimate\r\nbearing on the argument. Though Mr. Lincoln was too sagacious to give\r\nthe Northern allies of the Rebels the occasion they desired and even\r\nstrove to provoke, yet from the beginning of the war the most\r\npersistent efforts have been made to confuse the public mind as to its\r\norigin and motives, and to drag the people of the loyal States down\r\nfrom the national position they had instinctively taken to the old\r\nlevel of party squabbles and antipathies. The wholly unprovoked\r\nrebellion of an oligarchy proclaiming negro slavery the corner-stone of\r\nfree institutions, and in the first flush of over-hasty confidence\r\nventuring to parade the logical sequence of their leading dogma, \"that\r\nslavery is right in principle, and has nothing to do with difference of\r\ncomplexion,\" has been represented as a legitimate and gallant attempt\r\nto maintain the true principles of democracy. The rightful endeavor of\r\nan established government, the least onerous that ever existed, to\r\ndefend itself against a treacherous attack on its very existence, has\r\nbeen cunningly made to seem the wicked effort of a fanatical clique to\r\nforce its doctrines on an oppressed population.\r\n\r\nEven so long ago as when Mr. Lincoln, not yet convinced of the danger\r\nand magnitude of the crisis, was endeavoring to persuade himself of\r\nUnion majorities at the South, and to carry on a war that was half\r\npeace in the hope of a peace that would have been all war,--while he\r\nwas still enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law, under some theory that\r\nSecession, however it might absolve States from their obligations,\r\ncould not escheat them of their claims under the Constitution, and that\r\nslaveholders in rebellion had alone among mortals the privilege of\r\nhaving their cake and eating it at the same time,--the enemies of free\r\ngovernment were striving to persuade the people that the war was an\r\nAbolition crusade. To rebel without reason was proclaimed as one of the\r\nrights of man, while it was carefully kept out of sight that to\r\nsuppress rebellion is the first duty of government. All the evils that\r\nhave come upon the country have been attributed to the Abolitionists,\r\nthough it is hard to see how any party can become permanently powerful\r\nexcept in one of two ways,--either by the greater truth of its\r\nprinciples, or the extravagance of the party opposed to it. To fancy\r\nthe ship of state, riding safe at her constitutional moorings, suddenly\r\nengulfed by a huge kraken of Abolitionism, rising from unknown depths\r\nand grasping it with slimy tentacles, is to look at the natural history\r\nof the matter with the eyes of Pontoppidan. To believe that the leaders\r\nin the Southern treason feared any danger from Abolitionism would be to\r\ndeny them ordinary intelligence, though there can be little doubt that\r\nthey made use of it to stir the passions and excite the fears of their\r\ndeluded accomplices. They rebelled, not because they thought slavery\r\nweak, but because they believed it strong enough, not to overthrow the\r\ngovernment, but to get possession of it; for it becomes daily clearer\r\nthat they used rebellion only as a means of revolution, and if they got\r\nrevolution, though not in the shape they looked for, is the American\r\npeople to save them from its consequences at the cost of its own\r\nexistence? The election of Mr. Lincoln, which it was clearly in their\r\npower to prevent had they wished, was the occasion merely, and not the\r\ncause, of their revolt. Abolitionism, till within a year or two, was\r\nthe despised heresy of a few earnest persons, without political weight\r\nenough to carry the election of a parish constable; and their cardinal\r\nprinciple was disunion, because they were convinced that within the\r\nUnion the position of slavery was impregnable. In spite of the proverb,\r\ngreat effects do not follow from small causes,--that is,\r\ndisproportionately small,--but from adequate causes acting under\r\ncertain required conditions. To contrast the size of the oak with that\r\nof the parent acorn, as if the poor seed had paid all costs from its\r\nslender strong-box, may serve for a child's wonder; but the real\r\nmiracle lies in that divine league which bound all the forces of nature\r\nto the service of the tiny germ in fulfilling its destiny. Everything\r\nhas been at work for the past ten years in the cause of anti-slavery,\r\nbut Garrison and Phillips have been far less successful propagandists\r\nthan the slaveholders themselves, with the constantly growing arrogance\r\nof their pretensions and encroachments. They have forced the question\r\nupon the attention of every voter in the Free States, by defiantly\r\nputting freedom and democracy on the defensive. But, even after the\r\nKansas outrages, there was no wide-spread desire on the part of the\r\nNorth to commit aggressions, though there was a growing determination\r\nto resist them. The popular unanimity in favor of the war three years\r\nago was but in small measure the result of anti-slavery sentiment, far\r\nless of any zeal for abolition. But every month of the war, every\r\nmovement of the allies of slavery in the Free States, has been making\r\nAbolitionists by the thousand. The masses of any people, however\r\nintelligent, are very little moved by abstract principles of humanity\r\nand justice, until those principles are interpreted for them by the\r\nstinging commentary of some infringement upon their own rights, and\r\nthen their instincts and passions, once aroused, do indeed derive an\r\nincalculable reinforcement of impulse and intensity from those higher\r\nideas, those sublime traditions, which have no motive political force\r\ntill they are allied with a sense of immediate personal wrong or\r\nimminent peril. Then at last the stars in their courses begin to fight\r\nagainst Sisera. Had any one doubted before that the rights of human\r\nnature are unitary, that oppression is of one hue the world over, no\r\nmatter what the color of the oppressed,--had any one failed to see what\r\nthe real essence of the contest was,--the efforts of the advocates of\r\nslavery among ourselves to throw discredit upon the fundamental axioms\r\nof the Declaration of Independence and the radical doctrines of\r\nChristianity could not fail to sharpen his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhile every day was bringing the people nearer to the conclusion which\r\nall thinking men saw to be inevitable from the beginning, it was wise\r\nin Mr. Lincoln to leave the shaping of his policy to events. In this\r\ncountry, where the rough and ready understanding of the people is sure\r\nat last to be the controlling power, a profound common-sense is the\r\nbest genius for statesmanship. Hitherto the wisdom of the President's\r\nmeasures has been justified by the fact that they have always resulted\r\nin more firmly uniting public opinion. One of the things particularly\r\nadmirable in the public utterances of President Lincoln is a certain\r\ntone of familiar dignity, which, while it is perhaps the most difficult\r\nattainment of mere style, is also no doubtful indication of personal\r\ncharacter. There must be something essentially noble in an elective\r\nruler who can descend to the level of confidential ease without\r\nforfeiting respect, something very manly in one who can break through\r\nthe etiquette of his conventional rank and trust himself to the reason\r\nand intelligence of those who have elected him. No higher compliment\r\nwas ever paid to a nation than the simple confidence, the fireside\r\nplainness, with which Mr. Lincoln always addresses himself to the\r\nreason of the American people. This was, indeed, a true democrat, who\r\ngrounded himself on the assumption that a democracy can think. \"Come,\r\nlet us reason together about this matter,\" has been the tone of all his\r\naddresses to the people; and accordingly we have never had a chief\r\nmagistrate who so won to himself the love and at the same time the\r\njudgment of his countrymen. To us, that simple confidence of his in the\r\nright-mindedness of his fellow-men is very touching, and its success is\r\nas strong an argument as we have ever seen in favor of the theory that\r\nmen can govern themselves. He never appeals to any vulgar sentiment, he\r\nnever alludes to the humbleness of his origin; it probably never\r\noccurred to him, indeed, that there was anything higher to start from\r\nthan manhood; and he put himself on a level with those he addressed,\r\nnot by going down to them, but only by taking it for granted that they\r\nhad brains and would come up to a common ground of reason. In an\r\narticle lately printed in \"The Nation,\" Mr. Bayard Taylor mentions the\r\nstriking fact, that in the foulest dens of the Five Points he found the\r\nportrait of Lincoln. The wretched population that makes its hive there\r\nthrew all its votes and more against him, and yet paid this instinctive\r\ntribute to the sweet humanity of his nature. Their ignorance sold its\r\nvote and took its money, but all that was left of manhood in them\r\nrecognized its saint and martyr.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is not in the habit of saying, \"This is _my_ opinion, or\r\n_my_ theory,\" but, \"This is the conclusion to which, in my judgment,\r\nthe time has come, and to which, accordingly, the sooner we come the\r\nbetter for us.\" His policy has been the policy of public opinion based\r\non adequate discussion and on a timely recognition of the influence of\r\npassing events in shaping the features of events to come.\r\n\r\nOne secret of Mr. Lincoln's remarkable success in captivating the\r\npopular mind is undoubtedly an unconsciousness of self which enables\r\nhim, though under the necessity of constantly using the capital _I_, to\r\ndo it without any suggestion of egotism. There is no single vowel which\r\nmen's mouths can pronounce with such difference of effect. That which\r\none shall hide away, as it were, behind the substance of his discourse,\r\nor, if he bring it to the front, shall use merely to give an agreeable\r\naccent of individuality to what he says, another shall make an\r\noffensive challenge to the self-satisfaction of all his hearers, and an\r\nunwarranted intrusion upon each man's sense of personal importance,\r\nirritating every pore of his vanity, like a dry northeast wind, to a\r\ngoose-flesh of opposition and hostility. Mr. Lincoln has never studied\r\nQuinctilian; but he has, in the earnest simplicity and unaffected\r\nAmericanism of his own character, one art of oratory worth all the\r\nrest. He forgets himself so entirely in his object as to give his _I_\r\nthe sympathetic and persuasive effect of _We_ with the great body of\r\nhis countrymen. Homely, dispassionate, showing all the rough-edged\r\nprocess of his thought as it goes along, yet arriving at his\r\nconclusions with an honest kind of every-day logic, he is so eminently\r\nour representative man, that, when he speaks, it seems as if the people\r\nwere listening to their own thinking aloud. The dignity of his thought\r\nowes nothing to any ceremonial garb of words, but to the manly movement\r\nthat comes of settled purpose and an energy of reason that knows not\r\nwhat rhetoric means. There has been nothing of Cleon, still less of\r\nStrepsiades striving to underbid him in demagogism, to be found in the\r\npublic utterances of Mr. Lincoln. He has always addressed the\r\nintelligence of men, never their prejudice, their passion, or their\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n                   *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nOn the day of his death, this simple Western attorney, who according to\r\none party was a vulgar joker, and whom the _doctrinaires_ among\r\nhis own supporters accused of wanting every element of statesmanship,\r\nwas the most absolute ruler in Christendom, and this solely by the hold\r\nhis good-humored sagacity had laid on the hearts and understandings of\r\nhis countrymen. Nor was this all, for it appeared that he had drawn the\r\ngreat majority, not only of his fellow-citizens, but of mankind also,\r\nto his side. So strong and so persuasive is honest manliness without a\r\nsingle quality of romance or unreal sentiment to help it! A civilian\r\nduring times of the most captivating military achievement, awkward,\r\nwith no skill in the lower technicalities of manners, he left behind\r\nhim a fame beyond that of any conqueror, the memory of a grace higher\r\nthan that of outward person, and of a gentlemanliness deeper than mere\r\nbreeding. Never before that startled April morning did such multitudes\r\nof men shed tears for the death of one they had never seen, as if with\r\nhim a friendly presence had been taken away from their lives, leaving\r\nthem colder and darker. Never was funeral panegyric so eloquent as the\r\nsilent look of sympathy which strangers exchanged when they met on that\r\nday. Their common manhood had lost a kinsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n1865\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the glare of our civil war, certain truths, hitherto unobserved or\r\nguessed at merely, have been brought out with extraordinary sharpness\r\nof relief; and two of them have been specially impressive, the one for\r\nEuropean observers, the other for ourselves. The first, and perhaps the\r\nmost startling to the Old World watcher of the political skies, upon\r\nwhose field of vision the flaming sword of our western heavens grew\r\nfrom a misty speck to its full comet-like proportions, perplexing them\r\nwith fear of change, has been the amazing strength and no less amazing\r\nsteadiness of democratic institutions. An army twice larger than\r\nEngland, with the help of bounties, drafts, and the purchase of foreign\r\nvagabonds, ever set in the field during the direst stress of her\r\nstruggle with Napoleon has been raised in a single year by voluntary\r\nenlistment. A people untrained to bear the burden of heavy taxes not\r\nonly devotes to the public service sums gathered by private\r\nsubscription that in any other country would be deemed fabulous, but by\r\nsheer force of public opinion compels its legislators to the utmost\r\ningenuity and searchingness of taxation. What was uttered as a sarcasm\r\non the want of public spirit in Florence is here only literally true:--\r\n\r\n    \"Many refuse to bear the common burden;\r\n    But thy solicitous people answereth\r\n    Unasked, and cries, 'I bend my back to it.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd that the contrast may be felt in its fullest completeness, we must\r\nconsider that no private soldier is tempted into the ranks by hopes of\r\nplunder, or driven into them by want of fair wages for fair work,--that\r\nno officer can look forward to the splendid prizes of hereditary wealth\r\nand title. Love of their country was the only incentive, its gratitude\r\ntheir only reward. And in the matter of taxation also, a willingness to\r\nhelp bear the common burden has more of generosity in it where the\r\nwealth of the people is in great part the daily result of their daily\r\ntoil, and not a hoard inherited without merit, as without industry.\r\n\r\nNor have the qualities which lead to such striking results been\r\nexhibited only by the North. The same public spirit, though misled by\r\nwicked men for selfish ends, has shown itself in almost equal strength\r\nat the South. And in both cases it has been unmistakably owing to that\r\nliving and active devotion of the people to institutions in whose\r\nexcellence they share, and their habit of obedience to laws of their\r\nown making. If we have not hitherto had that conscious feeling of\r\nnationality, the ideal abstract of history and tradition, which belongs\r\nto older countries, compacted, by frequent war and united by memories\r\nof common danger and common triumph, it has been simply because our\r\nnational existence has never been in such peril as to force upon us the\r\nconviction that it was both the title-deed of our greatness and its\r\nonly safeguard. But what splendid possibilities has not our trial\r\nrevealed even to ourselves! What costly stuff whereof to make a nation!\r\nHere at last is a state whose life is not narrowly concentred in a\r\ndespot or a class, but feels itself in every limb; a government which\r\nis not a mere application of force from without, but dwells as a vital\r\nprinciple in the will of every citizen. Our enemies--and wherever a man\r\nis to be found bribed by an abuse, or who profits by a political\r\nsuperstition, we have a natural enemy--have striven to laugh and sneer\r\nand lie this apparition of royal manhood out of existence. They\r\nconspired our murder; but in this vision is the prophecy of a dominion\r\nwhich is to push them from their stools, and whose crown doth sear\r\ntheir eyeballs. America lay asleep, like the princess of the fairy\r\ntale, enchanted by prosperity; but at the first fiery kiss of war the\r\nspell is broken, the blood tingles along her veins again, and she\r\nawakes conscious of her beauty and her sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, by the side of the self-devotion and public spirit,\r\nthe vices and meannesses of troubled times have shown themselves, as\r\nthey will and must. We have had shoddy, we have had contracts, we have\r\nhad substitute-brokerage, we have had speculators in patriotism, and,\r\nstill worse, in military notoriety. Men have striven to make the blood\r\nof our martyrs the seed of wealth or office. But in times of public and\r\nuniversal extremity, when habitual standards of action no longer serve,\r\nand ordinary currents of thought are swamped in the flood of enthusiasm\r\nor excitement, it always happens that the evil passions of some men are\r\nstimulated by what serves only to exalt the nobler qualities of others.\r\nIn such epochs, evil as well as good is exaggerated. A great social\r\nconvulsion shakes up the lees which underlie society, forgotten because\r\nquiescent, and the stimulus of calamity brings out the extremes of\r\nhuman nature, whether for good or evil.\r\n\r\nWhat is especially instructive in the events we have been witnessing\r\nfor the past four years is the fact that the people have been the chief\r\nactors in the drama. They have not been the led, but the leaders. They\r\nhave not been involved in war by the passions or interests of their\r\nrulers, but deliberately accepted the ordeal of battle in defence of\r\ninstitutions which were the work of their own hands, and of whose\r\nbeneficence experience had satisfied them. Loyalty has hitherto been a\r\nsentiment rather than a virtue; it has been more often a superstition\r\nor a prejudice than a conviction of the conscience or of the\r\nunderstanding. Now for the first time it is identical with patriotism,\r\nand has its seat in the brain, and not the blood. It has before been\r\npicturesque, devoted, beautiful, as forgetfulness of self always is,\r\nbut now it is something more than all these,--it is logical. Here we\r\nhave testimony that cannot be gainsaid to the universal vitality and\r\nintelligence which our system diffuses with healthy pulse through all\r\nits members. Every man feels himself a part, and not a subject, of the\r\ngovernment, and can say in a truer and higher sense than Louis XIV., \"I\r\nam the state.\" But we have produced no Cromwell, no Napoleon. Let us be\r\nthankful that we have passed beyond that period of political\r\ndevelopment when such productions are necessary, or even possible. It\r\nis but another evidence of the excellence of the democratic principle.\r\nWhere power is the privilege of a class or of a single person, it may\r\nbe usurped; but where it is the expression of the common will, it can\r\nno more be monopolized than air or light. The ignorant and unreasoning\r\nforce of a populace, sure of losing nothing and with a chance of\r\ngaining something by any change, that restless material out of which\r\nviolent revolutions are made, if it exist here at all, is to be found\r\nonly in our great cities, among a class who have learned in other\r\ncountries to look upon all law as their natural enemy. Nor is it by any\r\nfault of American training, but by the want of it, that these people\r\nare what they are. When Lord Derby says that the government of this\r\ncountry is at the mercy of an excited mob, he proves either that the\r\ndemagogue is no exclusive product of a democracy, or that England would\r\nbe in less danger of war if her governing class knew something less of\r\nancient Greece and a little more of modern America.\r\n\r\nWhether or no there be any truth in the assertion that democracy tends\r\nto bring men down to a common level (as it surely brings them up to\r\none), we shall not stop to inquire, for the world has not yet had a\r\nlong enough experience of it to warrant any safe conclusion. During our\r\nrevolutionary struggle, it seems to us that both our civil and military\r\nleaders compare very well in point of ability with the British product\r\nof the same period, and the same thing may very well be true at the\r\npresent time. But while it may be the glory, it can hardly be called\r\nthe duty of a country to produce great men; and if forms of polity have\r\nanything to do in the matter, we should incline to prefer that which\r\ncould make a great nation felt to be such and loved as such by every\r\nhuman fibre in it, to one which stunted the many that a few favored\r\nspecimens might grow the taller and fairer.\r\n\r\nWhile the attitude of the government was by the necessity of the case\r\nexpectant so far as slavery was concerned, it is also true that the\r\npeople ran before it, and were moved by a deeper impulse than the mere\r\ninstinct of self-preservation. The public conscience gave energy and\r\nintention to the public will, and the bounty which drew our best\r\nsoldiers to the ranks was an idea. The game was the ordinary game of\r\nwar, and they but the unreasoning pieces on the board; but they felt\r\nthat a higher reason was moving them in a game where the stake was the\r\nlife not merely of their country, but of a principle whose rescue was\r\nto make America in very deed a New World, the cradle of a fairer\r\nmanhood. Weakness was to be no longer the tyrant's opportunity, but the\r\nvictim's claim; labor should never henceforth be degraded as a curse,\r\nbut honored as that salt of the earth which keeps life sweet, and gives\r\nits savor to duty. To be of good family should mean being a child of\r\nthe one Father of us all; and good birth, the being born into God's\r\nworld, and not into a fool's paradise of man's invention. But even had\r\nthis moral leaven been wanting, had the popular impulse been merely one\r\nof patriotism, we should have been well content to claim as the result\r\nof democracy that for the first time in the history of the world it had\r\nmustered an army that knew for what it was fighting. Nationality is no\r\ndead abstraction, no unreal sentiment, but a living and operative\r\nvirtue in the heart and moral nature of men. It enlivens the dullest\r\nsoul with an ideal out of and beyond itself, lifting every faculty to a\r\nhigher level of vision and action. It enlarges the narrowest intellect\r\nwith a fealty to something better than self. It emancipates men from\r\npetty and personal interests, to make them conscious of sympathies\r\nwhose society ennobles. Life has a deeper meaning when its throb beats\r\ntime to a common impulse and catches its motion from the general heart.\r\n\r\nBut while the experience of the last four years has been such, with all\r\nits sorrows, as to make us proud of our strength and grateful for the\r\nsources of it, we cannot but feel that peace will put to the test those\r\nhigher qualities which war leaves in reserve. What are we to do with\r\nthe country our arms have regained? It is by our conduct in this\r\nstewardship, and not by our rights under the original compact of the\r\nStates, that our policy is to be justified. The glory of conquest is\r\ntrifling and barren, unless victory clear the way to a higher\r\ncivilization, a more solid prosperity, and a Union based upon\r\nreciprocal benefits. In what precise manner the seceding States shall\r\nreturn, whether by inherent right, or with some preliminary penance and\r\nceremony of readoption, is of less consequence than what they shall be\r\nafter their return. Dependent provinces, sullenly submitting to a\r\ndestiny which they loathe, would be a burden to us, rather than an\r\nincrease of strength or an element of prosperity. War would have won us\r\na peace stripped of all the advantages that make peace a blessing. We\r\nshould have so much more territory, and so much less substantial\r\ngreatness. We did not enter upon war to open a new market, or fresh\r\nfields for speculators, or an outlet for redundant population, but to\r\nsave the experiment of democracy from destruction, and put it in a\r\nfairer way of success by removing the single disturbing element. Our\r\nbusiness now is not to allow ourselves to be turned aside from a\r\npurpose which our experience thus far has demonstrated to have been as\r\nwise as it was necessary, and to see to it that, whatever be the other\r\nconditions of reconstruction, democracy, which is our real strength,\r\nreceive no detriment.\r\n\r\nWe would not be understood to mean that Congress should lay down in\r\nadvance a fixed rule not to be departed from to suit the circumstances\r\nof special cases as they arise. What may do very well for Tennessee may\r\nnot be as good for South Carolina. Wise statesmanship does not so much\r\nconsist in the agreement of its forms with any abstract ideal, however\r\nperfect, as in its adaptation to the wants of the governed and its\r\ncapacity of shaping itself to the demands of the time. It is not to be\r\njudged by its intention, but by its results, and those will be\r\nproportioned to its practical, and not its theoretic, excellence. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon soundness of understanding has shown itself in nothing more\r\nclearly than in allowing institutions to be formulated gradually by\r\ncustom, convenience, or necessity, and in preferring the practical\r\ncomfort of a system that works, to the French method of a scientific\r\nmachinery of perpetual motion, demonstrably perfect in all its parts,\r\nand yet refusing to go. We do not wish to see scientific treatment,\r\nhowever admirable, applied to the details of reconstruction, if that is\r\nto be, as now seems probable, the next problem that is to try our\r\nintelligence and firmness. But there are certain points, it seems to\r\nus, on which it is important that public opinion should come to some\r\nsort of understanding in advance.\r\n\r\nThe peace negotiations have been of service in demonstrating that it is\r\nnot any ill blood engendered by war, any diversity of interests\r\nproperly national, any supposed antagonism of race, but simply the\r\nslaveholding class, that now stands between us and peace, as four years\r\nago it forced us into war. Precisely as the principle of Divine right\r\ncould make no lasting truce with the French Revolution, the Satanic\r\nright of the stronger to enslave the weaker can come to no\r\nunderstanding with democracy. The conflict is in the things, not in the\r\nmen, and one or the other must abdicate. Of course the leaders, to whom\r\nsubmission would be ruin, and a few sincere believers in the doctrine\r\nof State rights, are willing to sacrifice even slavery for\r\nindependence, a word which has a double meaning for some of them; but\r\nthere can be no doubt that an offer to receive the seceding States back\r\nto their old position under the Constitution would have put the war\r\nparty in a hopeless minority at the South. We think there are manifest\r\nsymptoms that the chinks made by the four years' struggle have let in\r\nnew light to the Southern people, however it may be with their ruling\r\nfaction, and that they begin to suspect a diversity of interest between\r\nthemselves, who chiefly suffer by the war, and the small class who\r\nbullied them into it for selfish purposes of their own. However that\r\nmay be, the late proposal of Davis and Lee for the arming of slaves,\r\nthough they certainly did not so intend it, has removed a very serious\r\nobstacle from our path. It is true that the emancipating clause was\r\nstruck out of the act as finally passed by the shadowy Congress at\r\nRichmond. But this was only for the sake of appearances. Once arm and\r\ndrill the negroes, and they can never be slaves again. This is admitted\r\non all hands, and accordingly, whatever the words of the act may be, it\r\npractically at once promotes the negro to manhood by brevet, as it\r\nwere, but at any rate to manhood. For the offer of emancipation as a\r\nbounty implies reason in him to whom it is offered; nay, more, implies\r\na capacity for progress and a wish, for it, which are in themselves\r\nvalid titles to freedom. This at a step puts the South back to the\r\nposition held by her greatest men in regard to slavery. All the\r\nScriptural arguments, all the fitness of things, all the physiological\r\ndemonstrations, all Mr. Stephens's corner-stones, Ham, Onesimus, heels,\r\nhair, and facial angle,--all are swept out, by one flirt of the besom\r\nof Fate, into the inexorable limbo of things that were and never should\r\nhave been. How is Truth wounded to death in the house of her friends!\r\nThe highest authority of the South has deliberately renounced its\r\nvested interest in the curse of Noah, and its right to make beasts of\r\nblack men because St. Paul sent back a white one to his master. Never\r\nwas there a more exact verification of the Spanish proverb, that he who\r\nwent out for wool may come back shorn. Alas for Nott and Gliddon!\r\nThrice alas for Bishop Hopkins! With slavery they lose their hold on\r\nthe last clue by which human reason could find its way to a direct\r\nproof of the benevolence of God and the plenary inspiration of\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nAll that we have learned of the blacks during the war makes the plan of\r\narming a part of them to help maintain the master's tyranny over the\r\nrest seem so futile, and the arguments urged against it by Mr. Gholson\r\nand Mr. Hunter are so convincing, that we can hardly persuade ourselves\r\nthat the authors of it did not intend it to make the way easier, not to\r\nindependence, but to reunion. It is said to argue desperation on the\r\npart of the chief conspirators at Richmond, and it undoubtedly does;\r\nbut we see in what we believe to be the causes of their despair\r\nsomething more hopeful than the mere exhaustion it indicates. It is\r\nsimply incredible that the losses of a four years' war should have\r\ndrained the fighting men of a population of five millions, or anything\r\nlike it; and the impossibility of any longer filling the Rebel armies\r\neven by the most elaborate system of press-gangs proves to our mind\r\nthat the poorer class of whites have for some reason or other deserted\r\nthe cause of the wealthy planters. The men are certainly there, but\r\nthey have lost all stomach for fighting. Here again we see something\r\nwhich is likely to make a final settlement more easy than it would have\r\nbeen even a year ago. Though the fact that so large a proportion of the\r\nSouthern people cannot read makes it harder to reach them, yet our\r\nsoldiers have circulated among them like so many Northern newspapers,\r\nand it is impossible that this intercourse, which has been constant,\r\nshould not have suggested to them many ideas of a kind which their\r\ntreacherous guides would gladly keep from them. The frantic rage of\r\nSouthern members of Congress against such books as Helper's can be\r\nexplained only by their fear lest their poorer constituents should be\r\nset a-thinking, for the notion of corrupting a field-hand by an\r\nAbolition document is too absurd even for a Wigfall or a Charleston\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two elements of a favorable horoscope for our future;\r\nan acknowledgment of the human nature of the negro by the very\r\nSanhedrim of the South, thus removing his case from the court of ethics\r\nto that of political economy; and a suspicion on the part of the\r\nSouthern majority that something has been wrong, which makes them\r\nreadier to see and accept what is right. We do not mean to say that\r\nthere is any very large amount of even latent Unionism at the South,\r\nbut we believe there is plenty of material in solution there which\r\nwaits only to be precipitated into whatever form of crystal we desire.\r\nWe must not forget that the main elements of Southern regeneration are\r\nto be sought in the South itself, and that such elements are abundant.\r\nA people that has shown so much courage and constancy in a bad cause,\r\nbecause they believed it a good one, is worth winning even by the\r\nsacrifice of our natural feeling of resentment. If we forgive the negro\r\nfor his degradation and his ignorance, in consideration of the system\r\nof which he has been the sacrifice, we ought also to make every\r\nallowance for the evil influence of that system upon the poor whites.\r\nIt is the fatal necessity of all wrong to revenge itself upon those who\r\nare guilty of it, or even accessory to it. The oppressor is dragged\r\ndown by the victim of his tyranny. The eternal justice makes the\r\nbalance even; and as the sufferer by unjust laws is lifted above his\r\nphysical abasement by spiritual compensations and that nearness to God\r\nwhich only suffering is capable of, in like measure are the material\r\nadvantages of the wrong-doer counterpoised by a moral impoverishment.\r\nOur duty is not to punish, but to repair; and the cure must work both\r\nways, emancipating the master from the slave, as well as the slave from\r\nthe master. Once rid of slavery, which was the real criminal, let us\r\nhave no more reproaches, justifiable only while the Southern sin made\r\nus its forced accomplices; and while we bind up the wounds of our black\r\nbrother who had fallen among thieves that robbed him of his rights as a\r\nman, let us not harden our hearts against our white brethren, from whom\r\ninterest and custom, those slyer knaves, whose fingers we have felt\r\nabout our own pockets, had stolen away their conscience and their sense\r\nof human brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe first question that arises in the mind of everybody in thinking of\r\nreconstruction is, What is to be done about the negro? After the war is\r\nover, there will be our Old Man of the Sea, as ready to ride us as\r\never. If we only emancipate him, he will not let us go free. We must do\r\nsomething more than merely this. While the suffering from them is still\r\nsharp, we should fix it in our minds as a principle, that the evils\r\nwhich have come upon us are the direct and logical consequence of our\r\nforefathers having dealt with a question of man as they would with one\r\nof trade or territory,--as if the rights of others were something\r\nsusceptible of compromise,--as if the laws that govern the moral, and,\r\nthrough it, the material world, would stay their operation for our\r\nconvenience. It is well to keep this present in the mind, because in\r\nthe general joy and hurry of peace we shall be likely to forget it\r\nagain, and to make concessions, or to leave things at loose ends for\r\ntime to settle,--as time has settled the blunders of our ancestors. Let\r\nus concede everything except what does not belong to us, but is only a\r\ntrust-property, namely, the principle of democracy and the prosperity\r\nof the future involved in the normal development of that principle.\r\n\r\nWe take it for granted at the outset, that the mind of the country is\r\nmade up as to making no terms with slavery in any way, large or\r\nlimited, open or covert. Not a single good quality traceable to this\r\nsystem has been brought to light in the white race at the South by the\r\nsearching test of war. In the black it may have engendered that\r\ntouching piety of which we have had so many proofs, and it has\r\ncertainly given them the unity of interest and the sympathy of\r\nintelligence which make them everywhere our friends, and which have\r\nsaved them from compromising their advantage, and still further\r\ncomplicating the difficulties of civil war by insurrection. But what\r\nhave been its effects upon the ruling class, which is, after all, the\r\nsupreme test of institutions? It has made them boastful, selfish,\r\ncruel, and false, to a degree unparalleled in history. So far from\r\nhaving given them any special fitness for rule, it has made them\r\nincapable of any but violent methods of government, and unable to deal\r\nwith the simplest problems of political economy. An utter ignorance of\r\ntheir own countrymen at the North led them to begin the war, and an\r\nequal misconception of Europe encouraged them to continue it. That\r\nthey have shown courage is true, but that is no exclusive property of\r\ntheirs, and the military advantage they seemed to possess is due less\r\nto any superiority of their own than to the extent of their territory\r\nand the roadless wildernesses which are at once the reproach and the\r\nfortification of their wasteful system of agriculture. Their advantages\r\nin war have been in proportion to their disadvantages in peace, and it\r\nis peace which most convincingly tries both the vigor of a nation and\r\nthe wisdom of its polity. It is with this class that we shall have to\r\ndeal in arranging the conditions of settlement; and we must do it with\r\na broad view of the interests of the whole country and of the great\r\nmass of the Southern people, whose ignorance and the prejudices\r\nconsequent from it made it so easy to use them as the instruments of\r\ntheir own ruin. No immediate advantage must blind us to the real\r\nobjects of the war,--the securing our external power and our internal\r\ntranquillity, and the making them inherent and indestructible by\r\nfounding them upon the common welfare.\r\n\r\nThe first condition of permanent peace is to render those who were the\r\ngreat slaveholders when the war began, and who will be the great\r\nlandholders after it is over, powerless for mischief. What punishment\r\nshould be inflicted on the chief criminals is a matter of little\r\nmoment. The South has received a lesson of suffering which satisfies\r\nall the legitimate ends of punishment, and as for vengeance, it is\r\ncontrary to our national temper and the spirit of our government. Our\r\ngreat object should be, not to weaken, but to strengthen the South,--to\r\nmake it richer, and not poorer. We must not repeat the stupid and fatal\r\nblunder of slaveholding publicists, that the wealth and power of one\r\nportion of the country are a drain upon the resources of the rest,\r\ninstead of being their natural feeders and invigorators. Any general\r\nconfiscation of Rebel property, therefore, seems to us unthrifty\r\nhousekeeping, for it is really a levying on our own estate, and a\r\nlessening of our own resources. The people of the Southern States will\r\nbe called upon to bear their part of the grievous burden of taxation\r\nwhich the war will leave upon our shoulders, and that is the fairest as\r\nwell as the most prudent way of making them contribute to our national\r\nsolvency. All irregular modes of levying contributions, however\r\njust,--and exactly just they can seldom be,--leave discontent behind\r\nthem, while a uniform system, where every man knows what he is to pay\r\nand why he is to pay it, tends to restore stability by the very\r\nevenness of its operation, by its making national interests familiar to\r\nall, and by removing any sense of injustice. Any sweeping confiscation,\r\nsuch as has sometimes been proposed in Congress with more heat than\r\njudgment, would render the South less available for revenue, would\r\nretard the return of industry to its legitimate channels, by lessening\r\nits means, and would not destroy the influence of the misgoverning\r\naristocracy. On the contrary, it would give them that prestige of\r\nmisfortune whose power over the sentiments of mankind is the moral of\r\nthe story of Stuarts and Bourbons and Bonapartes. Retribution they\r\nshould have, but let them have it in the only way worthy of a great\r\npeople to inflict. Let it come in a sense of their own folly and sin,\r\nbrought about by the magnanimity of their conquerors, by the return of\r\na more substantial prosperity born of the new order of things, so as to\r\nconvince, instead of alienating. We should remember that it is our\r\ncountry which we have regained, and not merely a rebellious faction\r\nwhich we have subdued.\r\n\r\nWhether it would not be good policy for the general government to\r\nassume all the wild lands in the rebellious States, and to devote the\r\nproceeds of their sale to actual settlers to the payment of the\r\nnational debt, is worth consideration. Texas alone, on whose public\r\nlands our assumption of her indebtedness gives us an equitable claim,\r\nwould suffice to secure our liabilities and to lighten our taxation,\r\nand in all cases of land granted to freedmen no title should vest till\r\na fair price had been paid,--a principle no less essential to their\r\ntrue interests than our own. That these people, who are to be the\r\npeasantry of the future Southern States, should be made landholders, is\r\nthe main condition of a healthy regeneration of that part of the\r\ncountry, and the one warranty of our rightful repossession of it. The\r\nwealth that makes a nation really strong, and not merely rich, is the\r\nopportunity for industry, intelligence, and well-being of its laboring\r\npopulation. This is the real country of poor men, as the great majority\r\nmust always be. No glories of war or art, no luxurious refinement of\r\nthe few, can give them a sense of nationality where this is wanting. If\r\nwe free the slave without giving him a right in the soil, and the\r\ninducement to industry which this offers, we reproduce only a more\r\nspecious form of all the old abuses. We leave all political power in\r\nthe hands of the wealthy landholders, where it was before. We leave the\r\npoorer whites unemancipated, for we leave labor still at the mercy of\r\ncapital, and with its old stigma of degradation. Blind to the lessons\r\nof all experience, we deliberately make the South what Ireland was when\r\nArthur Young travelled there, the country richest in the world by\r\nnature, reduced to irredeemable poverty and hopeless weakness by an\r\nupper class who would not, and a lower class who could not, improve. We\r\nhave no right to purchase dominion, no right to purchase even\r\nabolition, at such a price as that. No _uti possidetis_ conveys any\r\nlegitimate title, except on the condition of wise administration and\r\nmutual benefit.\r\n\r\nBut will it be enough to make the freedmen landholders merely? Must we\r\nnot make them voters also, that they may have that power of\r\nself-protection which no interference of government can so safely,\r\ncheaply, and surely exercise in their behalf? We answer this question\r\nin the affirmative, for reasons both of expediency and justice. At\r\nbest, the difficulty, if not settled now, will come up again for\r\nsettlement hereafter, when it may not be so easy of solution. As a\r\nmatter of expediency, it is always wisest to shape a system of policy\r\nwith a view to permanence, much more than to immediate convenience.\r\nWhen things are put upon a right footing at first,--and the only right\r\nfooting is one which will meet the inevitable demands of the future as\r\nwell as the more noisy ones of the present,--all subsidiary relations\r\nwill of necessity arrange themselves by mutual adaptation, without\r\nconstantly calling for the clumsy interference of authority. We must\r\nleave behind us no expectation and no fear of change, to unsettle men's\r\nminds and dishearten their industry. Both the late master and the late\r\nslave should begin on the new order of things with a sense of its\r\npermanence on the one hand and its rightfulness on the other. They will\r\nsoon learn that neither intelligence can do without labor, nor labor\r\nwithout intelligence, and that wealth will result only from a clearly\r\nunderstood and reciprocally beneficial dependence of each upon the\r\nother. Unless we make the black a citizen, we take away from the white\r\nthe strongest inducement to educate and enlighten him. As a mere\r\nproletary, his ignorance is a temptation to the stronger race; as a\r\nvoter, it is a danger to them which it becomes their interest to\r\nremove. It is easy to manage the mob of New York for the time with\r\ngrape-shot, but it is the power for evil which their suffrage gives\r\nthem that will at last interest all classes, by reform and education,\r\nto make it a power for good.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of expediency comes also this other\r\nconsideration,--that, unless made citizens, the emancipated blacks,\r\nreckoned as they must be in the basis of representation, and yet\r\nwithout power to modify the character of the representatives chosen,\r\nwill throw so much more power into the hands of men certain to turn it\r\nto their disadvantage, and only too probably to our own. This mass, if\r\nwe leave it inert, may, in any near balance of parties, be enough to\r\ncrush us; while, if we endow it with life and volition, if we put it in\r\nthe way of rising in intelligence and profiting by self-exertion, it\r\nwill be the best garrison for maintaining the supremacy of our ideas,\r\ntill they have had time to justify themselves by experience. Have we\r\nendured and prosecuted this war for the sake of bringing back our old\r\nenemies to legislate for us, stronger than ever, with all the\r\nresentment and none of the instruction of defeat?\r\n\r\nBut as a measure of justice also, which is always the highest\r\nexpediency, we are in favor of giving the ballot to the freedmen. Our\r\nanswer to the question, What are we to do with the negro? is short and\r\nsimple. Give him a fair chance. We must get rid of the delusion that\r\nright is in any way dependent on the skin, and not on an inward virtue.\r\nOur war has been carried on for the principles of democracy, and a\r\ncardinal point of those principles is, that the only way in which to\r\nfit men for freedom is to make them free, the only way to teach them\r\nhow to use political power is to give it them. Both South and North\r\nhave at last conceded the manhood of the negro, and the question now is\r\nhow we shall make that manhood available and profitable to him and to\r\nus. Democracy does not mean, to any intelligent person, an attempt at\r\nthe impossibility of making one man as good as another. But it\r\ncertainly does mean the making of one man's manhood as good as\r\nanother's and the giving to every human being the right of unlimited\r\nfree trade in all his faculties and acquirements. We believe the white\r\nrace, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain\r\nsufficient ascendency to prevent any serious mischief from the new\r\norder of things. We admit that the whole subject bristles with\r\ndifficulties, and we would by no means discuss or decide it on\r\nsentimental grounds. But our choice would seem to be between\r\nunqualified citizenship, to depend on the ability to read and write, if\r\nyou will, and setting the blacks apart in some territory by themselves.\r\nThere are, we think, insuperable objections to this last plan. It would\r\nput them beyond the reach of all good influence from the higher\r\ncivilization of the whites, without which they might relapse into\r\nbarbarism like the Maroons of Surinam, and it would deprive the whole\r\nSouthern country of the very labor it needs. As to any prejudices which\r\nshould prevent the two races from living together, it would soon yield\r\nto interest and necessity. The mere antipathy of color is not so strong\r\nthere as here, and the blacks would form so very large a majority of\r\nthe laboring class as not to excite the jealousy of rivalry. We can\r\nremember when the prejudice against the Celt was as strong in many of\r\nthe Free States as that against the African could ever be at the South.\r\nIt is not very long since this prejudice nearly gave a new direction to\r\nthe politics of the country. Yet, like all prejudices, it had not\r\ncoherence enough to keep any considerable party long together.\r\n\r\nThe objections to the plan are, of course, the same which lie against\r\nany theory of universal suffrage. These are many and strong, if\r\nconsidered abstractly; but we assume that theory to be admitted now as\r\nthe rule of our political practice, and its evils as a working system\r\nhave not been found so great, taking the country at large, as nearly to\r\noutweigh, its advantages. Moreover, as we have said before, it compels\r\nthe redress of its own abuses, and the remedy is one which is a benefit\r\nto the whole community, for it is simply to raise the general standard\r\nof intelligence. It is superior, certainly, to the English system, in\r\nwhich the body of the nation is alienated from its highest intellect\r\nand culture. We think the objections are quite as strong to any\r\nelective plan of government, for a select majority is as liable to be\r\ngoverned by its interests and passions as any popular one. Witness the\r\nelections at Oxford. Is the average wisdom or unselfishness of mankind\r\nso high that there should be no narrow minds and no selfish hearts in\r\nany body of electors, however carefully selected? The only infallible\r\nsovereign on earth is chosen by the majority of a body in which passion\r\nand intrigue and the influence (sometimes none of the purest) of\r\nconflicting courts are certainly not inoperative. Man is perhaps not\r\nthe wisest of animals, but he has at least as keen a sense of his own\r\nadvantage in a hovel as in a palace, and what is for the interest of\r\nthe masses of the people is not very far from being for that of the\r\ncountry. It is said, to be sure, that we are inadequately represented\r\nin Congress; but a representative is apt to be a tolerably exact\r\nexponent of the merits of his constituency, and we must look for relief\r\nto the general improvement of our people in morals, manners, and\r\nculture. We doubt if the freedmen would send worse members to Congress\r\nthan some in whose election merchants and bankers and even doctors of\r\ndivinity have been accomplices.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the war the real trial of our statesmanship, our\r\npatriotism, and our patience will begin. The passions excited by it\r\nwill, no doubt, subside in due time, but meanwhile it behooves the\r\nparty in possession of the government to conciliate patriotic men of\r\nall shades of opinion by a liberal, manly and unpartisan policy.\r\nRepublicans must learn to acknowledge that all criticisms of their\r\nmeasures have not been dictated by passion or disloyalty, that many\r\nmoderate and honest men, many enlightened ones, have really found\r\nreason for apprehension in certain arbitrary stretches of authority,\r\nnay, may even have been opposed to the war itself, without being in\r\nlove with slavery, and without deserving to be called Copperheads. Many\r\nhave doubted the wisdom of our financial policy, without being\r\nunpatriotic. It is precisely this class, dispassionate and moderate in\r\ntheir opinions, whose help we shall need in healing the wounds of war\r\nand giving equanimity to our counsels. We hope to see a course of\r\naction entered upon which shall draw them to its support. In peace,\r\ngovernments cannot, as in war, find strength in the enthusiasm and even\r\nthe passions of the people, but must seek it in the approval of their\r\njudgment and convictions. During war, all the measures of the dominant\r\nparty have a certain tincture of patriotism; declamation serves very\r\nwell the purposes of eloquence, and fervor of persuasion passes muster\r\nas reason; but in peaceful times everything must come back to a\r\nspecific standard, and stand or fall on its own merits. Our faith is\r\nnot unmixed with apprehension when we think of the immediate future,\r\nyet it is an abiding faith nevertheless; and with the experience of the\r\nlast four years to sustain us, we are willing to believe almost\r\nanything good of the American people, and to say with the saint,\r\n_Credimus quia impossibile est_. We see no good reason why, if we\r\nuse our victory with the moderation becoming men who profess themselves\r\ncapable of self-government, conceding all that can be conceded without\r\ndanger to the great principle which has been at stake, the North and\r\nthe South should not live more harmoniously together in the future than\r\nin the past, now that the one rock of offence has been blasted out of\r\nthe way. We do not believe that the war has tended to lessen their\r\nrespect for each other, or that it has left scars which will take to\r\naching again with every change of the political weather. We must bind\r\nthe recovered communities to us with hooks of interest, by convincing\r\nthem that we desire their prosperity as an integral part of our own.\r\nFor a long while yet there will be a latent disaffection, even when the\r\noutward show may be fair, as in spring the ground often stiffens when\r\nthe thermometer is above the freezing point. But we believe, in spite\r\nof this, that all this untowardness will yield to the gradual wooing of\r\ncircumstances, and that it is to May, and not December, that we are to\r\nlook forward. Even in our finances, which are confessedly our weakest\r\npoint, we doubt if the experience of any other nation will enable us to\r\nform a true conception of our future. We shall have, beyond question,\r\nthe ordinary collapse of speculation that follows a sudden expansion of\r\npaper currency. We shall have that shivering and expectant period when\r\nthe sails flap and the ship trembles ere it takes the wind on the new\r\ntack. But it is no idle boast to say that there never was a country\r\nwith such resources as ours. In Europe the question about a man always\r\nis, What _is_ he? Here it is as invariably, What does he _do_? And in\r\nthat little difference lies the security of our national debt for\r\nwhoever has eyes. In America there is no idle class supported at the\r\nexpense of the nation, there is no splendid poor-house of rank or\r\noffice, but every man is at work adding his share to the wealth, and to\r\nthat extent insuring the solvency, of the country. Our farm, indeed, is\r\nmortgaged, but it is a mortgage which the yearly profits will pay off.\r\n\r\nThose who look upon the war as a wicked crusade of the North against\r\nthe divinely sanctioned institutions of the South, and those who hope\r\neven yet to reknit the monstrous league between slavery and a party\r\ncalling itself Democratic, will of course be willing to take back the\r\nseceding States without conditions. Neither of these classes is any\r\nlonger formidable, either by its numbers or the character of its\r\nleaders. But there is yet a third class, who seem to have confused\r\ntheir minds with some fancied distinction between civil and foreign\r\nwar. Holding the States to be indestructible, they seem to think that,\r\nby the mere cessation of hostilities, they are to resume their places\r\nas if nothing had happened, or rather as if this had been a mere\r\npolitical contest which we had carried. But it is with the people of\r\nthe States, and not with any abstract sovereignty, that we have been at\r\nwar, and it is of them that we are to exact conditions, and not of some\r\nconvenient quasi-entity, which is not there when the battle is raging,\r\nand is there when the terms of capitulation are to be settled. No, it\r\nis slavery which made this war, and slavery which must pay the damages.\r\nWhile we should not by any unseemly exultation remind the Southern\r\npeople that they have been conquered, we should also not be weak enough\r\nto forget that we have won the right of the victor. And what is that\r\nright, if it be not to exact indemnity for the past and security for\r\nthe future? And what more nobly and satisfactorily fulfils both those\r\nconditions, than utterly to extinguish the cause of quarrel? What we\r\nfear is the foolish and weak good-nature inherent in popular\r\ngovernment, but against which monarchies and aristocracies are insured\r\nby self-interest, which the prospect of peace is sure to arouse, and\r\nwhich may make our settlement a stage-reconciliation, where everybody\r\nrushes into the arms of everybody else with a fervor which has nothing\r\nto do with the living relations of the actors. We believe that the\r\npublic mind should be made up as to what are the essential conditions\r\nof real and lasting peace, before it is subjected to the sentimental\r\ndelusions of the inevitable era of good feeling, in which the stronger\r\nbrother is so apt to play the part of Esau. If we are to try the\r\nexperiment of democracy fairly, it must be tried in its fullest extent,\r\nand not half-way. The theory which grants political power to the\r\nignorant white foreigner need not be squeamish about granting it to the\r\nignorant black native, for the gist of the matter is in the dark mind,\r\nand not the more or less dusky skin. Of course we shall be met by the\r\nusual fallacy,--Would you confer equality on the blacks? But the answer\r\nis a very simple one. Equality cannot be conferred on any man, be he\r\nwhite or black. If he be capable of it, his title is from God, and not\r\nfrom us. The opinion of the North is made up on the subject of\r\nemancipation, and Mr. Lincoln has announced it as the one essential\r\npreliminary to the readmission of the insurgent States. To our mind,\r\ncitizenship is the necessary consequence, as it is the only effectual\r\nwarranty, of freedom; and accordingly we are in favor of distinctly\r\nsettling beforehand some conditional right of admission to it. We have\r\npurposely avoided any discussion on gradualism as an element in\r\nemancipation, because we consider its evil results to have been\r\ndemonstrated in the British West Indies. True conservative policy is\r\nnot an anodyne hiding away our evil from us in a brief forgetfulness.\r\nIt looks to the long future of a nation, and dares the heroic remedy\r\nwhere it is scientifically sure of the nature of the disease. The only\r\ndesperate case for a people is where its moral sense is paralyzed, and\r\nthe first symptom is a readiness to accept an easy expedient at the\r\nsacrifice of a difficult justice. The relation which is to be final and\r\npermanent cannot be too soon decided on and put in working order,\r\nwhether for the true interest of master or slave; and the only safe\r\nrelation is one that shall be fearlessly true to the principles in\r\nvirtue of which we asserted our own claim to autonomy, and our right to\r\ncompel obedience to the government so established. Anything short of\r\nthat has the weakness of an expedient which will erelong compel us to\r\nreconstruct our reconstruction, and the worse weakness of hypocrisy,\r\nwhich will sooner or later again lay us open to the retribution of that\r\neternal sincerity which brings all things at last to the test of its\r\nown unswerving standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTCH THE SNAKE, OR KILL IT?\r\n\r\n1865\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the American people are less apt than others to\r\nprofit by experience, because the bustle of their lives keeps breaking\r\nthe thread of that attention which is the material of memory, till no\r\none has patience or leisure to spin from it a continuous thread of\r\nthought. We suspect that this is not more true of us than of other\r\nnations,--than it is of all people who read newspapers. Great events\r\nare perhaps not more common than they used to be, but a vastly greater\r\nnumber of trivial incidents are now recorded, and this dust of time\r\ngets in our eyes. The telegraph strips history of everything down to\r\nthe bare fact, but it does not observe the true proportions of things,\r\nand we must make an effort to recover them. In brevity and cynicism it\r\nis a mechanical Tacitus, giving no less space to the movements of Sala\r\nthan of Sherman, as impartial a leveller as death. It announces with\r\nequal _sangfroid_ the surrender of Kirby Smith and the capture of a\r\nfresh rebel governor, reducing us to the stature at which posterity\r\nshall reckon us. Eminent contemporaneousness may see here how much\r\nspace will be allotted to it in the historical compends and biographical\r\ndictionaries of the next generation. In artless irony the telegraph is\r\nunequalled among the satirists of this generation. But this short-hand\r\ndiarist confounds all distinctions of great and little, and roils the\r\nmemory with minute particles of what is oddly enough called intelligence.\r\nWe read in successive paragraphs the appointment of a Provisional\r\nGovernor of North Carolina, whose fitness or want of it may be the\r\nturning-point of our future history, and the nomination of a minister,\r\nwho will at most only bewilder some foreign court with a more\r\ndesperately helpless French than his predecessor. The conspiracy trial\r\nat Washington, whose result will have absolutely no effect on the real\r\naffairs of the nation, occupies for the moment more of the public mind\r\nand thought than the question of reconstruction, which involves the\r\nlife or death of the very principle we have been fighting for these\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the event of the day, whatever it may be, is apt to become\r\nunduly prominent, and to thrust itself obscuringly between us and the\r\nperhaps more important event of yesterday, where the public appetite\r\ndemands fresh gossip rather than real news, and the press accordingly\r\nkeeps its spies everywhere on the lookout for trifles that become\r\nimportant by being later than the last. And yet this minuteness of\r\ntriviality has its value also. Our sensitive sheet gives us every\r\nmorning the photograph of yesterday, and enables us to detect and to\r\nstudy at leisure that fleeting expression of the time which betrays its\r\ncharacter, and which might altogether escape us in the idealized\r\nhistorical portrait. We cannot estimate the value of the _items_ in our\r\ndaily newspaper, because the world to which they relate is too familiar\r\nand prosaic; but a hundred years hence some Thackeray will find them\r\nfull of picturesque life and spirit. The \"Chronicle\" of the Annual\r\nRegister makes the England of the last century more vividly real to us\r\nthan any history. The jests which Pompeian idlers scribbled on the\r\nwalls, while Vesuvius was brooding its fiery conspiracy under their\r\nfeet, bring the scene nearer home to us than the letter of Pliny, and\r\ndeepen the tragedy by their trifling contrast, like the grave-diggers'\r\nunseemly gabble in Hamlet. Perhaps our judgment of history is made\r\nsounder, and our view of it more lifelike, when we are so constantly\r\nreminded how the little things of life assert their place alongside the\r\ngreat ones, and how healthy the constitution of the race is, how sound\r\nits digestion, how gay its humor, that can take the world so easily\r\nwhile our continent is racked with fever and struggling for life\r\nagainst the doctors.\r\n\r\n    \"Let Hercules himself do what he may,\r\n    The cat will mew, the dog must have his day.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always pleasant to meet Dame Clio over the tea-table, as it were,\r\nwhere she is often more entertaining, if not more instructive, than\r\nwhen she puts on the loftier port and more ceremonious habit of a Muse.\r\nThese inadvertences of history are pleasing. We are no longer\r\nforeigners, in any age of the world, but feel that in a few days we\r\ncould have accommodated ourselves there, and that, wherever men are, we\r\nare not far from home. The more we can individualize and personify, the\r\nmore lively our sympathy. Man interests us scientifically, but men\r\nclaim us through all that we have made a part of our nature by\r\neducation and custom. We would give more to know what Xenophon's\r\nsoldiers gossiped about round their camp-fires, than for all the\r\nparticulars of their retreat. Sparta becomes human to us when we think\r\nof Agesilaus on his hobby-horse. Finding that those heroic figures\r\nromped with their children, we begin for the first time to suspect that\r\nthey ever really existed as much as Robinson Crusoe. Without these\r\npersonal traits, antiquity seems as unreal to us as Sir Thomas More's\r\nUtopia. It is, indeed, surprising how little of real life what is\r\nreckoned solid literature has preserved to us, voluminous as it is.\r\nWhere does chivalry at last become something more than a mere\r\nprocession of plumes and armor, to be lamented by Burke, except in some\r\nof the less ambitious verses of the Trouveres, where we hear the\r\ncanakin clink too emphatically, perhaps, but which at least paint\r\nliving men and possible manners? Tennyson's knights are cloudy,\r\ngigantic, of no age or country, like the heroes of Ossian. They are\r\ncreatures without stomachs. Homer is more condescending, and though we\r\nmight not be able to draw the bow of Ulysses, we feel quite at home\r\nwith him and Eumaeus over their roast pork.\r\n\r\nWe cannot deny that the poetical view of any period is higher, and in\r\nthe deepest sense truer, than all others; but we are thankful also for\r\nthe penny-a-liner, whether ancient or modern, who reflects the whims\r\nand humors, the enthusiasms and weaknesses, of the public in unguarded\r\nmoments. Is it so certain, after all, that we should not be interesting\r\nourselves in other quite as nugatory matters if these were denied us?\r\nIn one respect, and no unimportant one, the instantaneous dispersion of\r\nnews and the universal interest in it have affected the national\r\nthought and character. The whole people have acquired a certain\r\nmetropolitan temper; they feel everything at once and in common; a\r\nsingle pulse sends anger, grief, or triumph through the whole country;\r\none man sitting at the keyboard of the telegraph in Washington sets the\r\nchords vibrating to the same tune from sea to sea; and this\r\nsimultaneousness, this unanimity, deepens national consciousness and\r\nintensifies popular emotion. Every man feels himself a part, sensitive\r\nand sympathetic, of this vast organism, a partner in its life or death.\r\nThe sentiment of patriotism is etherealized and ennobled by it, is\r\nkindled by the more or less conscious presence of an ideal element; and\r\nthe instinctive love of a few familiar hills and fields widens, till\r\nCountry is no longer an abstraction, but a living presence, felt in the\r\nheart and operative in the conscience, like that of an absent mother.\r\nIt is no trifling matter that thirty millions of men should be thinking\r\nthe same thought and feeling the same pang at a single moment of time,\r\nand that these vast parallels of latitude should become a neighborhood\r\nmore intimate than many a country village. The dream of Human\r\nBrotherhood seems to be coming true at last. The peasant who dipped his\r\nnet in the Danube, or trapped the beaver on its banks, perhaps never\r\nheard of Caesar or of Caesar's murder; but the shot that shattered the\r\nforecasting brain, and curdled the warm, sweet heart of the most\r\nAmerican of Americans, echoed along the wires through the length and\r\nbreadth of a continent, swelling all eyes at once with tears of\r\nindignant sorrow. Here was a tragedy fulfilling the demands of\r\nAristotle, and purifying with an instantaneous throb of pity and terror\r\na theatre of such proportions as the world never saw. We doubt if\r\nhistory ever recorded an event so touching and awful as this sympathy,\r\nso wholly emancipated from the toils of space and time that it might\r\nseem as if earth were really sentient, as some have dreamed, or the\r\ngreat god Pan alive again to make the hearts of nations stand still\r\nwith his shout. What is Beethoven's \"Funeral March for the Death of a\r\nHero\" to the symphony of love, pity, and wrathful resolve which the\r\ntelegraph of that April morning played on the pulses of a nation?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that our system of town meetings made our Revolution\r\npossible, by educating the people in self-government. But this was at\r\nmost of partial efficacy, while the newspaper and telegraph, gather the\r\nwhole nation into a vast town-meeting, where every one hears the\r\naffairs of the country discussed, and where the better judgment is\r\npretty sure to make itself valid at last. No memorable thing is said or\r\ndone, no invention or discovery is made, that some mention of it does\r\nnot sooner or later reach the ears of a majority of Americans. It is\r\nthis constant mental and moral stimulus which gives them the alertness\r\nand vivacity, the wide-awakeness of temperament, characteristic of\r\ndwellers in great cities, and which has been remarked on by English\r\ntourists as if it were a kind of physiological transformation. They\r\nseem to think we have lost something of that solidity of character\r\nwhich (with all other good qualities) they consider the peculiar\r\ninheritance of the British race, though inherited in an elder brother's\r\nproportion by the favored dwellers in the British Isles. We doubt if\r\nany substantial excellence is lost by this suppling of the intellectual\r\nfaculties, and bringing the nervous system nearer the surface by the\r\nabsorption of superfluous fat. What is lost in bulk may be gained in\r\nspring. It is true that the clown, with his parochial horizon, his diet\r\ninconveniently thin, and his head conveniently thick, whose notion of\r\ngreatness is a prize pig, and whose patriotism rises or falls with the\r\nstrength of his beer, is a creature as little likely to be met with\r\nhere as the dodo, his only rival in the qualities that make up a good\r\ncitizen; but this is no result of climatic influences. Such creatures\r\nare the contemporaries of an earlier period of civilization than ours.\r\nNor is it so clear that solidity is always a virtue, and lightness a\r\nvice in character, any more than in bread, or that the leaven of our\r\ninstitutions works anything else than a wholesome ferment and aeration.\r\nThe experience of the last four years is enough to prove that\r\nsensibility may consist with tenacity of purpose, and that enthusiasm\r\nmay become a permanent motive where the conviction of the worth of its\r\nobject is profound and logical. There are things in this universe\r\ndeeper and higher, more solid even, than the English Constitution. If\r\nthat is the perfection of human wisdom and a sufficing object of faith\r\nand worship for our cousins over the water, on the other hand God's\r\ndealing with this chosen people is preparing them to conceive of a\r\nperfection of divine wisdom, of a constitution in the framing of which\r\nman's wit had no share, and which shall yet be supreme, as it is\r\ncontinually more or less plainly influential in the government of the\r\nworld. We may need even sterner teaching than any we have yet had, but\r\nwe have faith that the lesson will be learned at last.\r\n\r\nIf the assertion which we alluded to at the outset were true, if we,\r\nmore than others, are apt to forget; the past in the present, the work\r\nof Mr. Moore[6] would do much in helping us to recover what we have\r\nlost. Had its execution been as complete as its plan was excellent, it\r\nwould have left nothing to be desired. Its want of order may be charged\r\nupon the necessity of monthly publication; but there are other defects\r\nwhich this will hardly excuse. The editor seems to have become\r\ngradually helpless before the mass of material that heaped itself about\r\nhim, and to have shovelled from sheer despair of selection. In the\r\ndocumentary part he is sufficiently, sometimes even depressingly full,\r\nand he has preserved a great deal of fugitive poetry from both sides,\r\nmuch of it spirited, and some of it vigorously original;[7] but he has\r\nfrequently neglected to give his authorities. His extracts from the\r\nnewspapers of the day, especially from Southern and foreign ones, are\r\nprovokingly few, and his department of \"incidents and rumors,\" the true\r\nmirror of the time, inadequate both in quantity and quality. In spite\r\nof these defects, however, there is enough to recall vividly the\r\nfeatures of the time at any marked period during the war, to renew the\r\nphases of feeling, to trace the slowly gathering current of opinion,\r\nand to see a definite purpose gradually orbing itself out of the chaos\r\nof plans and motives, hopes, fears, enthusiasms, and despondencies. We\r\ndo not propose to review the book,--we might, indeed, almost as well\r\nundertake to review the works of Father Time himself,--but, relying\r\nchiefly on its help in piecing out our materials, shall try to freshen\r\nthe memory of certain facts and experiences worth bearing in mind\r\neither for example or warning.\r\n\r\n      [6] _The Rebellion Record._ Edited by Frank Moore. Six vols.\r\n\r\n      [7] See especially _The Old Sergeant_, a remarkable poem by\r\n      Forseythe Willson, in the sixth volume.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance, especially considering the part which what are\r\ncalled the \"leading minds\" of the South are expected to play in\r\nreconstruction, to keep clearly before our eyes the motives and the\r\nmanner of the Rebellion. Perhaps we should say inducements rather than\r\nmotives, for of these there was but a single one put forward by the\r\nseceding States, namely, the obtaining security, permanence, and\r\nextension for the system of slavery. We do not use the qualifying\r\nepithet \"African,\" because the franker propagandists of Southern\r\nprinciples affirmed the divine institution of slavery pure and simple,\r\nwithout regard to color or the curse of Canaan. This being the single\r\nmotive of the Rebellion, what was its real object? Primarily, to\r\npossess itself of the government by a sudden _coup d'etat_; or that\r\nfailing, then, secondarily, by a peaceful secession, which should\r\nparalyze the commerce and manufactures of the Free States, to bring\r\nthem to terms of submission. Whatever may have been the opinion of some\r\nof the more far-sighted, it is clear that a vast majority of the\r\nSouthern people, including their public men, believed that their\r\nrevolution would be peaceful. Their inducements to moving precisely\r\nwhen they did were several. At home the treasury was empty; faithless\r\nministers had supplied the Southern arsenals with arms, and so disposed\r\nthe army and navy as to render them useless for any sudden need; but\r\nabove all, they could reckon on several months of an administration\r\nwhich, if not friendly, was so feeble as to be more dangerous to the\r\ncountry than to its betrayers, and there was a great party at the North\r\nhitherto their subservient allies, and now sharing with them in the\r\nbitterness of a common political defeat.[8] Abroad there was peace,\r\nwith the prospect of its continuance; the two great maritime powers\r\nwere also the great consumers of cotton, were both deadly enemies, like\r\nthemselves, to the democratic principle, and, if not actively\r\ninterfering, would at least throw all the moral weight of their\r\nsympathy and encouragement on the Southern side. They were not\r\naltogether mistaken in their reckoning. The imbecility of Mr. Buchanan\r\nbedded the ship of state in an ooze of helpless inaction, where none of\r\nher guns could be brought to bear, and whence nothing but the tide of\r\nindignation which followed the attack on Sumter could have set her\r\nafloat again, while prominent men and journals of the Democratic party\r\nhastened to assure the Rebels, not only of approval, but of active\r\nphysical assistance. England, with indecent eagerness, proclaimed a\r\nneutrality which secured belligerent rights to a conspiracy that was\r\nnever to become a nation, and thus enabled members of Parliament to fit\r\nout privateers to prey with impunity on the commerce of a friendly\r\npower. The wily Napoleon followed, after an interval long enough to\r\nthrow all responsibility for the measure, and to direct all the natural\r\nirritation it excited in this country, upon his neighbor over the way.\r\nEngland is now endeavoring to evade the consequences of her hasty\r\nproclamation and her jaunty indifference to the enforcement of it upon\r\nher own subjects. The principle of international law involved is a most\r\nimportant one; but it was not so much the act itself, or the pecuniary\r\ndamage resulting from it, as the _animus_ that so plainly prompted it,\r\nwhich Americans find it hard to forgive.\r\n\r\n      [8] Mr. A. H. Stephens, Vice-President of the late Confederacy,\r\n      attributed the Secession movement to disappointed ambition.\r\n\r\nIt would be unwise in us to forget that independence was a merely\r\nsecondary and incidental consideration with the Southern conspirators\r\nat the beginning of the Rebellion, however they may have thought it\r\nwise to put it in the front, both for the sake of their foreign\r\nabettors who were squeamish about seeming, though quite indifferent\r\nabout being, false to their own professions and the higher interests of\r\ntheir country, and also for the sake of its traditionary influence\r\namong the Southern people. Some, it is true, were bold enough or\r\nlogical enough to advocate barbarism as a good in itself; and in\r\nestimating the influences which have rendered some minds, if not\r\nfriendly to the Rebellion, at least indifferent to the success of the\r\nUnion, we should not forget that reaction against the softening and\r\nhumanizing effect of modern civilization, led by such men as Carlyle,\r\nand joined in by a multitude whose intellectual and moral fibre is too\r\nmuch unstrung to be excited by anything less pungent than paradox.\r\nProtestants against the religion which sacrifices to the polished idol\r\nof Decorum and translates Jehovah by _Comme-il-faut_, they find even\r\nthe divine manhood of Christ too tame for them, and transfer their\r\nallegiance to the shaggy Thor with his mallet of brute force. This is\r\nhardly to be wondered at when we hear England called prosperous for the\r\nstrange reason that she no longer dares to act from a noble impulse,\r\nand when, at whatever page of her recent history one opens, he finds\r\nher statesmanship to consist of one Noble Lord or Honorable Member\r\nasking a question, and another Noble Lord or Honorable Member\r\nendeavoring to dodge it, amid cries of _Hear! Hear!_ enthusiastic in\r\nproportion to the fruitlessness of listening. After all, we are\r\ninclined to think there is more real prosperity, more that posterity\r\nwill find to have a deep meaning and reality, in a democracy spending\r\nitself for a principle, and, in spite of the remonstrances, protests,\r\nand sneers of a world busy in the eternal seesaw of the balance of\r\nEurope, persisting in a belief that life and property are mere\r\ncounters, of no value except as representatives of a higher idea. May\r\nit be long ere government become in the New World, as in the Old, an\r\narmed police and fire-department, to protect property as it grows more\r\nworthless by being selfishly clutched in fewer hands, and keep God's\r\nfire of manhood from reaching that gunpowder of the dangerous classes\r\nwhich underlies all institutions based only on the wisdom of our\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nAs we look back to the beginnings of the Rebellion, we are struck with\r\nthe thoughtlessness with which both parties entered upon a war of whose\r\nvast proportions and results neither was even dimly conscious. But a\r\nmanifest difference is to be remarked. In the South this\r\nthoughtlessness was the result of an ignorant self-confidence, in the\r\nNorth of inexperience and good humor. It was long before either side\r\ncould believe that the other was in earnest: the one in attacking a\r\ngovernment which they knew only by their lion's share in its offices\r\nand influence, the other in resisting the unprovoked assault of a race\r\nborn in the saddle, incapable of subjugation, and unable to die\r\ncomfortably except in the last ditch of jubilant oratory. When at last\r\neach was convinced of the other's sincerity, the moods of both might\r\nhave been predicted by any observer of human nature. The side which\r\nfelt that it was not only in the wrong, but that it had made a blunder,\r\nlost all control of its temper, all regard for truth and honor. It\r\nbetook itself forthwith to lies, bluster, and cowardly abuse of its\r\nantagonist. But beneath every other expression of Southern sentiment,\r\nand seeming to be the base of it, was a ferocity not to be accounted\r\nfor by thwarted calculations or by any resentment at injuries received,\r\nbut only by the influence of slavery on the character and manners.\r\n\"Scratch a Russian,\" said Napoleon, \"and you come to the Tartar\r\nbeneath.\" Scratch a slaveholder, and beneath the varnish of\r\nconventionalism you come upon something akin to the man-hunter of\r\nDahomey. Nay, the selfishness engendered by any system which rests on\r\nthe right of the strongest is more irritable and resentful in the\r\ncivilized than the savage man, as it is enhanced by a consciousness of\r\nguilt. In the first flush of over-confidence, when the Rebels reckoned\r\non taking Washington, the air was to be darkened with the gibbeted\r\ncarcasses of dogs and caitiffs. Pollard, in the first volume of his\r\n_Southern History of the War_, prints without comment the letter\r\nof a ruffian who helped butcher our wounded in Sudley Church after the\r\nfirst battle of Manassas, in which he says that he had resolved to give\r\nno quarter. In Missouri the Rebels took scalps as trophies, and that\r\nthey made personal ornaments of the bones of our unburied dead, and\r\nthat women wore them, though seeming incredible, has been proved beyond\r\nquestion. Later in the war, they literally starved our prisoners in a\r\ncountry where Sherman's army of a hundred thousand men found supplies\r\nso abundant that they could dispense with their provision train. Yet\r\nthese were the \"gentry\" of the country, in whose struggle to escape\r\nfrom the contamination of mob-government the better classes of England\r\nso keenly sympathized. Our experience is thrown away unless it teach us\r\nthat every form of conventionalized injustice is instinctively in\r\nleague with every other, the world over, and that all institutions safe\r\nonly in law, but forever in danger from reason and conscience, beget\r\nfirst selfishness, next fear, and then cruelty, by an incurable\r\ndegeneration. Having been thus taught that a rebellion against justice\r\nand mercy has certain natural confederates, we must be blind indeed not\r\nto see whose alliance at the South is to give meaning and permanence to\r\nour victory over it.\r\n\r\nIn the North, on the other hand, nothing is more striking than the\r\npersistence in good nature, the tenacity with which the theories of the\r\nerring brother and the prodigal son were clung to, despite all evidence\r\nof facts to the contrary. There was a kind of boyishness in the rumors\r\nwhich the newspapers circulated (not seldom with intent to dispirit),\r\nand the people believed on the authority of reliable gentlemen from\r\nRichmond, or Union refugees whose information could be trusted. At one\r\ntime the Rebels had mined eleven acres in the neighborhood of Bull Bun;\r\nat another, there were regiments of giants on their way from Texas,\r\nwho, first paralyzing our batteries by a yell, would rush unscathed\r\nupon the guns, and rip up the unresisting artillerymen with\r\nbowie-knives three feet long, made for that precise service, and the\r\nonly weapon to which these Berserkers would condescend; again, for the\r\nfiftieth time, France and England had definitely agreed upon a forcible\r\nintervention; finally, in order to sap the growing confidence of the\r\npeople in President Lincoln, one of his family was accused of\r\ncommunicating our plans to the Rebels, and this at a time when the\r\nfavorite charge against his administration was the having no plan at\r\nall. The public mind, as the public folly is generally called, was kept\r\nin a fidget by these marvels and others like them. But the point to\r\nwhich we would especially call attention is this: that while the war\r\nslowly educated the North, it has had comparatively little effect in\r\nshaking the old nonsense out of the South. Nothing is more striking, as\r\nwe trace Northern opinion through those four years that seemed so long\r\nand seem so short, than to see how the minds of men were sobered,\r\nbraced, and matured as the greatness of the principles at stake became\r\nmore and more manifest; how their purpose, instead of relaxing, was\r\nstrained tighter by disappointment, and by the growing sense of a\r\nguidance wiser than their own. Nor should we forget how slow the great\r\nbody of the people were in being persuaded of the expediency of\r\ndirectly attacking slavery, and after that of enlisting colored troops;\r\nof the fact, in short, that it must always be legal to preserve the\r\nsource of the law's authority, and constitutional to save the country.\r\nThe prudence of those measures is now acknowledged by all, and\r\njustified by the result; but we must not be blind to the deeper moral,\r\nthat justice is always and only politic, that it needs no precedent,\r\nand that we were prosperous in proportion as we were willing to be true\r\nto our nobler judgment. In one respect only the popular understanding\r\nseems always to have been, and still to remain, confused. Our notion of\r\ntreason is a purely traditional one, derived from countries where the\r\nquestion at issue has not been the life of the nation, but the\r\nconflicting titles of this or that family to govern it. Many people\r\nappear to consider civil war as merely a more earnest kind of political\r\ncontest, which leaves the relative position of the parties as they\r\nwould be after a Presidential election. But no treason was ever so\r\nwicked as that of Davis and his fellow-conspirators, for it had no\r\napology of injury or even of disputed right, and it was aimed against\r\nthe fairest hope and promise of the world. They did not attempt to put\r\none king in place of another, but to dethrone human nature and discrown\r\nthe very manhood of the race. And in what respect does a civil war\r\ndiffer from any other in the discretion which it leaves to the victor\r\nof exacting indemnity for the past and security for the future? A\r\ncontest begun for such ends and maintained by such expedients as this\r\nhas been, is not to be concluded by merely crying _quits_ and shaking\r\nhands. The slaveholding States chose to make themselves a foreign\r\npeople to us, and they must take the consequences. We surely cannot be\r\nexpected to take them back as if nothing had happened, as if victory\r\nrendered us helpless to promote good or prevent evil, and took from us\r\nall title to insist on the admission of the very principle for which we\r\nhave sacrificed so much. The war has established the unity of the\r\ngovernment, but no peace will be anything more than a pretence unless\r\nit rest upon the unity of the nation, and that can only be secured by\r\nmaking everywhere supreme the national idea that freedom is a right\r\ninherent in man himself, and not a creature of the law, to be granted\r\nto one class of men or withheld from it at the option of another.\r\n\r\nWhat have we conquered? The Southern States? The Southern people? A\r\ncessation of present war? Surely not these or any one of these merely.\r\nThe fruit of our victory, as it was always the object of our warfare,\r\nis the everlasting validity of the theory of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence in these United States, and the obligation before God and\r\nman to make it the rule of our practice. It was in that only that we\r\nwere stronger than our enemies, stronger than the public opinion of the\r\nworld; and it is from that alone that we derive our right of the\r\nstrongest, for it is wisdom, justice, and the manifest will of Him who\r\nmade of one blood all the nations of the earth. It were a childish view\r\nof the matter to think this is a mere trial of strength or struggle for\r\nsupremacy between the North and South. The war sprang from the inherent\r\nantipathy between two forms of political organization radically hostile\r\nto each other. Is the war over, will it ever be over, if we allow the\r\nincompatibility to remain, childishly satisfied with a mere change of\r\nshape? This has been the grapple of two brothers that already struggled\r\nwith each other even in the womb. One of them has fallen under the\r\nother; but let simple, good-natured Esau beware how he slacken his grip\r\ntill he has got back his inheritance, for Jacob is cunninger with the\r\ntongue than he.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the war has given the North a higher conception of\r\nits manhood and its duties, and of the vital force of ideas. But do we\r\nfind any parallel change in the South? We confess we look for it in\r\nvain. There is the same arrogance, the same materialistic mode of\r\nthought, which reckons the strength and value of a country by the\r\namount of its crops rather than by the depth of political principle\r\nwhich inspires its people, the same boyish conceit on which even defeat\r\nwastes its lesson. Here is a clear case for the interference of\r\nauthority. The people have done their part by settling the fact that we\r\nhave a government; and it is for the government now to do its duty\r\ntoward the people by seeing to it that their blood and treasure shall\r\nnot have been squandered in a meaningless conflict. We must not let\r\nourselves be misled by the terms North and South, as if those names\r\nimplied any essential diversity of interest, or the claim to any\r\nseparate share in the future destiny of the country. Let us concede\r\nevery right to the several States except that of mischief, and never\r\nagain be deceived by the fallacy that a moral wrong can be local in its\r\nevil influence, or that a principle alien to the instincts of the\r\nnation can be consistent either with its prosperity or its peace. We\r\nmust not be confused into a belief that it is with States that we are\r\ndealing in this matter. The very problem is how to reconstitute safely\r\na certain territory or population as States. It is not we that take\r\nanything from them. The war has left them nothing that they can fairly\r\ncall their own politically but helplessness and confusion. We propose\r\nonly to admit them for the first time into a real union with us, and to\r\ngive them an equal share in privileges, our belief in whose value we\r\nhave proved by our sacrifices in asserting them. There is always a time\r\nfor doing what is fit to be done; and if it be done wisely,\r\ntemperately, and firmly, it need appeal for its legality to no higher\r\ntest than success. It is the nation and not a section, which is\r\nvictorious, and it is only on principles of purely national advantage\r\nthat any permanent settlement can be based.\r\n\r\nThe South will come back to the Union intent on saving whatever\r\nfragments it can from the wreck of the evil element in its social\r\nstructure, which it clings to with that servile constancy which men\r\noften show for the vice that is making them its victims. If they must\r\nlose slavery, they will make a shift to be comfortable on the best\r\nsubstitute they can find in a system of caste. The question for a wise\r\ngovernment in such a case seems to us not to be, Have we the right to\r\ninterfere? but much rather, Have we the right to let them alone? If we\r\nare entitled, as conquerors,--and it is only as such that we are so\r\nentitled,--to stipulate for the abolition of slavery, what is there to\r\nprevent our exacting further conditions no less essential to our safety\r\nand the prosperity of the South? The national unity we have paid so\r\ndearly for will turn out a pinchbeck counterfeit, without that sympathy\r\nof interests and ideas, that unity of the people, which can spring only\r\nfrom homogeneousness of institutions. The successive advances toward\r\njustice which we made during the war, and which looked so difficult and\r\ndoubtful before they were made, the proclamation of freedom and the\r\narming of the blacks, seem now to have been measures of the simplest\r\nexpediency, as the highest always turns out to be the simplest when we\r\nhave the wit to try it. The heavens were to have come crashing down\r\nafter both those measures; yet the pillars of the universe not only\r\nstood firm on their divinely laid foundations, but held us up also,\r\nand, to the amazement of many, God did not frown on an experiment of\r\nrighteousness. People are not yet agreed whether these things were\r\nconstitutional; we believe, indeed, that the weight of legal opinion is\r\nagainst them, but nevertheless events are tolerably unanimous that\r\nwithout them we should have had a fine Constitution left on our hands\r\nwith no body politic for it to animate.\r\n\r\nLaws of the wisest human device are, after all, but the sheath of the\r\nsword of Power, which must not be allowed to rust in them till it\r\ncannot be drawn swiftly in time of need. President Lincoln had many\r\nscruples to overcome ere he could overstep the limits of precedent into\r\nthe divine air of moral greatness. Like most men, he was reluctant to\r\nbe the bearer of that message of God with which his name will be linked\r\nin the grateful memory of mankind. If he won an immortality of fame by\r\nconsenting to ally himself with the eternal justice, and to reinforce\r\nhis armies by the inspiration of their own nobler instincts, an equal\r\nchoice of renown is offered to his successor in applying the same\r\nloyalty to conscience in the establishment of peace. We could not live\r\ntogether half slave and half free; shall we succeed better in trying a\r\nsecond left-handed marriage between democracy and another form of\r\naristocracy, less gross, but not less uncongenial? They who before\r\nmisled the country into a policy false and deadly to the very truth\r\nwhich was its life and strength, by the fear of abolitionism, are\r\nmaking ready to misrule it again by the meaner prejudice of color. We\r\ncan have no permanent peace with the South but by Americanizing it, by\r\ncompelling it, if need be, to accept the idea, and with it the safety\r\nof democracy. At present we seem on the brink of contracting to protect\r\nfrom insurrection States in which a majority of the population, many of\r\nthem now trained to arms, and all of them conscious of a claim upon us\r\nto make their freedom strong enough to protect them, are to be left at\r\nthe mercy of laws which they have had no share in enacting.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of this consideration alone should make us pause. The more\r\nthought we bestow upon the matter, the more thoroughly are we persuaded\r\nthat the only way to get rid of the negro is to do him justice.\r\nDemocracy is safe because it is just, and safe only when it is just to\r\nall. Here is no question of white or black, but simply of man. We have\r\nhitherto been strong in proportion as we dared be true to the sublime\r\nthought of our own Declaration of Independence, which for the first\r\ntime proposed to embody Christianity in human laws, and announced the\r\ndiscovery that the security of the state is based on the moral\r\ninstincts and the manhood of its members. In the very midnight of the\r\nwar, when we were compassed round with despondency and the fear of man,\r\nthat peerless utterance of human policy rang like a trumpet announcing\r\nheavenly succor, and lifted us out of the darkness of our doubts into\r\nthat courage which comes of the fear of God. Now, if ever, may a\r\nstatesman depend upon the people sustaining him in doing what is simply\r\nright, for they have found out the infinite worth of freedom, and how\r\nmuch they love it, by being called on to defend it. We have seen how\r\nour contest has been watched by a breathless world; how every humane\r\nand generous heart, every intellect bold enough to believe that men may\r\nbe safely trusted with government as well as with any other of their\r\nconcerns, has wished us God-speed. And we have felt as never before the\r\nmeaning of those awful words, \"Hell beneath is stirred for thee,\" as we\r\nsaw all that was mean and timid and selfish and wicked, by a horrible\r\nimpulsion of nature, gathering to the help of our enemies. Why should\r\nwe shrink from embodying our own idea as if it would turn out a\r\nFrankenstein? Why should we let the vanquished dictate terms of peace?\r\nA choice is offered that may never come again, unless after another\r\nwar. We should sin against our own light, if we allowed mongrel\r\nrepublics to grow up again at the South, and deliberately organized\r\nanarchy, as if it were better than war. Let the law be made equal for\r\nall men. If the power does not exist in the Constitution, find it\r\nsomewhere else, or confess that democracy, strongest of all governments\r\nfor war, is the weakest of all in the statesmanship that shall save us\r\nfrom it. There is no doubt what the wishes of the administration are.\r\nLet them act up to their own convictions and the emergency of the hour,\r\nsure of the support of the people; for it is one of the chief merits of\r\nour form of polity that the public reason, which gives our Constitution\r\nall its force, is always a reserve of power to the magistrate, open to\r\nthe appeal of justice, and ready to ratify the decisions of conscience.\r\nThere is no need of hurry in readmitting the States that locked\r\nthemselves out of the old homestead. It is not enough to conquer unless\r\nwe convert them, and time, the best means of quiet persuasion, is in\r\nour own hands. Shall we hasten to cover with the thin ashes of another\r\ncompromise that smouldering war which we called peace for seventy\r\nyears, only to have it flame up again when the wind of Southern\r\ndoctrine has set long enough in the old quarter? It is not the absence\r\nof war, but of its causes, that is in our grasp. That is what we fought\r\nfor, and there must be a right somewhere to enforce what all see to be\r\nessential. To quibble away such an opportunity would be as cowardly as\r\nunwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT ON THE STUMP\r\n\r\n1866\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson is the first of our Presidents who has descended to the\r\nstump, and spoken to the people as if they were a mob. We do not care\r\nto waste words in criticising the taste of this proceeding, but deem it\r\nour duty to comment on some of its graver aspects. We shall leave\r\nentirely aside whatever was personal in the extraordinary diatribe of\r\nthe 22d of February, merely remarking that we believe the majority of\r\nAmericans have too much good sense to be flattered by an allusion to\r\nthe humbleness of their chief magistrate's origin; the matter of\r\ninterest for them being rather to ascertain what he has arrived at than\r\nwhere he started from,--we do not mean in station, but in character,\r\nintelligence, and fitness for the place he occupies. We have reason to\r\nsuspect, indeed, that pride of origin, whether high or low, springs\r\nfrom the same principle in human nature, and that one is but the\r\npositive, the other the negative, pole of a single weakness. The people\r\ndo not take it as a compliment to be told that they have chosen a\r\nplebeian to the highest office, for they are not fond of a plebeian\r\ntone of mind or manners. What they do like, we believe, is to be\r\nrepresented by their foremost man, their highest type of courage,\r\nsense, and patriotism, no matter what his origin. For, after all, no\r\none in this country incurs any natal disadvantage unless he be born to\r\nan ease which robs him of the necessity of exerting, and so of\r\nincreasing and maturing, his natural powers. It is of very little\r\nconsequence to know what our President was; of the very highest, to\r\nascertain what he is, and to make the best of him. We may say, in\r\npassing, that the bearing of Congress, under the temptations of the\r\nlast few weeks, has been most encouraging, though we must except from\r\nour commendation the recent speech of Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania.\r\nThere is a pride of patriotism that should make all personal pique seem\r\ntrifling; and Mr. Stevens ought to have remembered that it was not so\r\nmuch the nakedness of an antagonist that he was uncovering as that of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Andrew Johnson_]\r\n\r\nThe dangers of popular oratory are always great, and unhappily ours is\r\nnearly all of this kind. Even a speaker in Congress addresses his real\r\nhearers through the reporters and the post-office. The merits of the\r\nquestion at issue concern him less than what _he_ shall say about\r\nit so as not to ruin his own chance of reelection, or that of some\r\nfourth cousin to a tidewaitership. Few men have any great amount of\r\ngathered wisdom, still fewer of extemporary, while there are unhappily\r\nmany who have a large stock of accumulated phrases, and hold their\r\nparts of speech subject to immediate draft. In a country where the\r\nparty newspapers and speakers have done their best to make us believe\r\nthat consistency is of so much more importance than statesmanship, and\r\nwhere every public man is more or less in the habit of considering what\r\nhe calls his \"record\" as the one thing to be saved in the general\r\ndeluge, a hasty speech, if the speaker be in a position to make his\r\nwords things, may, by this binding force which is superstitiously\r\nattributed to the word once uttered, prove to be of public detriment.\r\nIt would be well for us if we could shake off this baleful system of\r\nrequiring that a man who has once made a fool of himself shall always\r\nthereafter persevere in being one. Unhappily it is something more easy\r\nof accomplishment than the final perseverance of the saints. Let us\r\nlearn to be more careful in distinguishing between betrayal of\r\nprinciple, and breaking loose from a stupid consistency that compels\r\nits victims to break their heads against the wall instead of going a\r\nfew steps round to the door. To eat our own words would seem to bear\r\nsome analogy to that diet of east-wind which is sometimes attributed to\r\nthe wild ass, and might therefore be wholesome for the tame variety of\r\nthat noble and necessary animal, which, like the poor, we are sure to\r\nhave always with us. If the words have been foolish, we can conceive of\r\nno food likely to be more nutritious, and could almost wish that we\r\nmight have public establishments at the common charge, like those at\r\nwhich the Spartans ate black broth, where we might all sit down\r\ntogether to a meal of this cheaply beneficial kind. Among other\r\namendments of the Constitution, since every Senator seems to carry half\r\na dozen in his pocket nowadays, a sort of legislative six-shooter,\r\nmight we not have one to the effect that a public character might\r\nchange his mind as circumstances changed theirs, say once in five\r\nyears, without forfeiting the confidence of his fellow-citizens?\r\n\r\nWe trust that Mr. Johnson may not be so often reminded of his late\r\nharangue as to be provoked into maintaining it as part of his settled\r\npolicy, and that every opportunity will be given him for forgetting it,\r\nas we are sure his better sense will make him wish to do. For the more\r\nwe reflect upon it, the more it seems to us to contain, either directly\r\nor by implication, principles of very dangerous consequence to the\r\nwell-being of the Republic. We are by no means disposed to forget Mr.\r\nJohnson's loyalty when it was hard to be loyal, nor the many evidences\r\nhe has given of a sincere desire to accomplish what seemed to him best\r\nfor the future of the whole country; but, at the same time, we cannot\r\nhelp thinking that some of his over-frank confidences of late have\r\nshown alarming misconceptions, both of the position he holds either in\r\nthe public sentiment or by virtue of his office, and of the duty\r\nthereby devolved upon him. We do not mean to indulge ourselves in any\r\nnonsensical rhetoric about usurpations like those which cost an English\r\nking his head, for we consider the matter in too serious a light, and\r\nno crowded galleries invite us to thrill them with Bulwerian\r\ncommonplace; but we have a conviction that the exceptional\r\ncircumstances of the last five years, which gave a necessary\r\npredominance to the executive part of our government, have left behind\r\nthem a false impression of the prerogative of a President in ordinary\r\ntimes. The balance-wheel of our system has insensibly come to think\r\nitself the motive power, whereas that, to be properly effective, should\r\nalways be generated by the deliberate public opinion of the country.\r\nAlready the Democratic party, anxious to profit by any chance at\r\nresuscitation,--for it is extremely inconvenient to be dead so\r\nlong,--is more than hinting that the right of veto was given to the\r\nPresident that he might bother and baffle a refractory Congress into\r\nconcession, not to his reasons, but to his whim. There seemed to be a\r\nplan, at one time of forming a President's party, with no principle but\r\nthat of general opposition to the policy of that great majority which\r\ncarried him into power. Such a scheme might have had some chance of\r\nsuccess in the good old times when it seemed to the people as if there\r\nwas nothing more important at stake than who should be in and who out;\r\nbut it would be sure of failure now that the public mind is\r\nintelligently made up as to the vital meaning of whatever policy we\r\nadopt, and the necessity of establishing our institutions, once for\r\nall, on a basis as permanent as human prudence can make it.\r\n\r\nCongress is sometimes complained of for wasting time in discussion, and\r\nfor not having, after a four months' session, arrived at any definite\r\nplan of settlement. There has been, perhaps, a little eagerness on the\r\npart of honorable members to associate their names with the particular\r\nnostrum that is to build up our national system again. In a country\r\nwhere, unhappily, any man may be President, it is natural that a means\r\nof advertising so efficacious as this should not be neglected. But\r\nreally, we do not see how Congress can be blamed for not being ready\r\nwith a plan definite and precise upon every point of possible\r\napplication, when it is not yet in possession of the facts according to\r\nwhose varying complexion the plan must be good or bad. The question\r\nwith us is much more whether another branch of the government,--to\r\nwhich, from its position and its opportunity for a wider view, the\r\ncountry naturally looks for initiative suggestion, and in which a few\r\nmonths ago even decisive action would have been pardoned,--whether this\r\ndid not let the lucky moment go by without using it. That moment was\r\nimmediately after Mr. Lincoln's murder, when the victorious nation was\r\nready to apply, and the conquered faction would have submitted without\r\na murmur to that bold and comprehensive policy which is the only wise\r\nas it is the only safe one for great occasions. To let that moment slip\r\nwas to descend irrecoverably from the vantage ground where\r\nstatesmanship is an exact science to the experimental level of\r\ntentative politics. We cannot often venture to set our own house on\r\nfire with civil war, in order to heat our iron up to that point of easy\r\nforging at which it glowed, longing for the hammer of the master-smith,\r\nless than a year ago. That Occasion is swift we learned long ago from\r\nthe adage; but this volatility is meant only of moments where force of\r\npersonal character is decisive, where the fame or fortune of a single\r\nman is at stake. The life of nations can afford to take less strict\r\naccount of time, and in their affairs there may always be a hope that\r\nthe slow old tortoise, Prudence, may overtake again the opportunity\r\nthat seemed flown by so irrecoverably. Our people have shown so much of\r\nthis hard-shelled virtue during the last five years, that we look with\r\nmore confidence than apprehension to the result of our present\r\ndifficulties. Never was the common-sense of a nation more often and\r\ndirectly appealed to, never was it readier in coming to its conclusion\r\nand making it operative in public affairs, than during the war whose\r\nwounds we are now endeavoring to stanch. It is the duty of patriotic\r\nmen to keep this great popular faculty always in view, to satisfy its\r\nnatural demand for clearness and practicality in the measures proposed,\r\nand not to distract it and render it nugatory by the insubstantial\r\nmetaphysics of abstract policy. From the splitting of heads to the\r\nsplitting of hairs would seem to be a long journey, and yet some are\r\nalready well on their way to the end of it, who should be the leaders\r\nof public opinion and not the skirmishing harassers of its march. It\r\nwould be well if some of our public men would consider that Providence\r\nhas saved their modesty the trial of an experiment in cosmogony, and\r\nthat their task is the difficult, no doubt, but much simpler and less\r\nambitious one, of bringing back the confused material which lies ready\r\nto their hand, always with a divinely implanted instinct of order in\r\nit, to as near an agreement with the providential intention as their\r\nbest wisdom can discern. The aggregate opinion of a nation moves\r\nslowly. Like those old migrations of entire tribes, it is encumbered\r\nwith much household stuff; a thousand unforeseen things may divert or\r\nimpede it; a hostile check or the temptation of present convenience may\r\nlead it to settle far short of its original aim; the want of some\r\nguiding intellect and central will may disperse it; but experience\r\nshows one constant element of its progress, which those who aspire to\r\nbe its leaders should keep in mind, namely, that the place of a wise\r\ngeneral should be oftener in the rear or the centre than the extreme\r\nfront. The secret of permanent leadership is to know how to be\r\nmoderate. The rashness of conception that makes opportunity, the\r\ngallantry that heads the advance, may win admiration, may possibly\r\nachieve a desultory and indecisive exploit; but it is the slow\r\nsteadiness of temper, bent always on the main design and the general\r\nmovement, that gains by degrees a confidence as unshakable as its own,\r\nthe only basis for permanent power over the minds of men. It was the\r\nsurest proof of Mr. Lincoln's sagacity and the deliberate reach of his\r\nunderstanding, that he never thought time wasted while he waited for\r\nthe wagon that brought his supplies. The very immovability of his\r\npurpose, fixed always on what was attainable, laid him open to the\r\nshallow criticism of having none,--for a shooting star draws more eyes,\r\nand seems for the moment to have a more definite aim, than a\r\nplanet,--but it gained him at last such a following as made him\r\nirresistible. It lays a much lighter tax on the intellect, and proves\r\nits resources less, to suggest a number of plans, than to devise and\r\ncarry through a single one.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson has an undoubted constitutional right to choose any, or to\r\nreject all, of the schemes of settlement proposed by Congress, though\r\nthe wisdom of his action in any case is a perfectly proper subject of\r\ndiscussion among those who put him where he is, who are therefore\r\nresponsible for his power of good or evil, and to whom the consequences\r\nof his decision must come home at last. He has an undoubted personal\r\nright to propose any scheme of settlement himself, and to advocate it\r\nwith whatever energy of reason or argument he possesses, but is liable,\r\nin our judgment, to very grave reprehension if he appeal to the body of\r\nthe people against those who are more immediately its representatives\r\nthan himself in any case of doubtful expediency, before discussion is\r\nexhausted, and where the difference may well seem one of personal pique\r\nrather than of considerate judgment. This is to degrade us from a\r\nrepublic, in whose fore-ordered periodicity of submission to popular\r\njudgment democracy has guarded itself against its own passions, to a\r\nmass meeting, where momentary interest, panic, or persuasive\r\nsophistry--all of them gregarious influences, and all of them\r\ncontagious--may decide by a shout what years of afterthought may find\r\nit hard, or even impossible, to undo. There have been some things in\r\nthe deportment of the President of late that have suggested to\r\nthoughtful men rather the pettish foible of wilfulness than the\r\nstrength of well-trained and conscientious will. It is by the objects\r\nfor whose sake the force of volition is called into play that we decide\r\nwhether it is childish or manly, whether we are to call it obstinacy or\r\nfirmness. Our own judgment can draw no favorable augury from meetings\r\ngathered \"to sustain the President,\" as it is called, especially if we\r\nconsider the previous character of those who are prominent in them, nor\r\nfrom the ill-considered gossip about a \"President's party;\" and they\r\nwould excite our apprehension of evil to come, did we not believe that\r\nthe experience of the last five years had settled into convictions in\r\nthe mind of the people. The practical result to which all benevolent\r\nmen finally come is that it is idle to try to sustain any man who has\r\nnot force of character enough to sustain himself without their help,\r\nand the only party which has any chance now before the people is that\r\nof resolute good sense. What is now demanded of Congress is unanimity\r\nin the best course that is feasible. They should recollect that Wisdom\r\nis more likely to be wounded in the division of those who should be her\r\nfriends, than either of the parties to the quarrel. Our difficulties\r\nare by no means so great as timid or interested people would represent\r\nthem to be. We are to decide, it is true, for posterity; but the\r\nquestion presented to us is precisely that which every man has to\r\ndecide in making his will,--neither greater nor less than that, nor\r\ndemanding a wisdom above what that demands. The power is in our own\r\nhands, so long as it is prudent for us to keep it there; and we are\r\njustified, not in doing simply what we will with our own, but what is\r\nbest to be done. The great danger in the present posture of affairs\r\nseems to be lest the influence which in Mr. Lincoln's case was inherent\r\nin the occasion and the man should have held over in the popular mind\r\nas if it were entailed upon the office. To our minds more is to be\r\napprehended in such a conjuncture from the weakness than from the\r\nstrength of the President's character.\r\n\r\nThere is another topic which we feel obliged to comment on, regretting\r\ndeeply, as we do, that the President has given us occasion for it, and\r\nbelieving, as we would fain do, that his own better judgment will lead\r\nhim to abstain from it in the future. He has most unfortunately\r\npermitted himself to assume a sectional ground. Geography is learned to\r\nlittle purpose in Tennessee, if it does not teach that the Northeast as\r\nwell as the Southwest is an integral and necessary part of the United\r\nStates. By the very necessity of his high office, a President becomes\r\nan American, whose concern is with the outward boundaries of his\r\ncountry, and not its internal subdivisions. One great object of the\r\nwar, we had supposed, was to abolish all fallacies of sectional\r\ndistinction in a patriotism that could embrace something wider than a\r\ntownship, a county, or even a State. But Mr. Johnson has chosen to\r\nrevive the paltry party-cries from before that deluge which we hoped\r\nhad washed everything clean, and to talk of treason at both ends of the\r\nUnion, as if there were no difference between men who attempted the\r\nlife of their country, and those who differ from him in their judgment\r\nof what is best for her future safety and greatness. We have heard\r\nenough of New England radicalism, as if that part of the country where\r\nthere is the most education and the greatest accumulation of property\r\nin the hands of the most holders were the most likely to be carried\r\naway by what are called agrarian theories. All that New England and the\r\nWest demand is that America should be American; that every relic of a\r\nbarbarism more archaic than any institution of the Old World should be\r\nabsolutely and irrecoverably destroyed; that there should be no longer\r\ntwo peoples here, but one, homogeneous and powerful by a sympathy in\r\nidea. Does Mr. Johnson desire anything more? Does he, alas! desire\r\nanything less? If so, it may be the worse for his future fame, but it\r\nwill not and cannot hinder the irresistible march of that national\r\ninstinct which forced us into war, brought us out of it victorious, and\r\nwill not now be cheated of its fruits. If we may trust those who have\r\nstudied the matter, it is moderate to say that more than half the\r\nentire population of the Free States is of New England descent, much\r\nmore than half the native population. It is by the votes of these men\r\nthat Mr. Johnson holds his office; it was as the exponent of their\r\nconvictions of duty and policy that he was chosen to it. Not a vote did\r\nhe or could he get in a single one of the States in rebellion. If they\r\nwere the American people when they elected him to execute their will,\r\nare they less the American people now? It seems to us the idlest of all\r\npossible abstractions now to discuss the question whether the\r\nrebellious States were ever out of the Union or not, as if that settled\r\nthe right of secession. The victory of superior strength settled it,\r\nand nothing else. For four years they were practically as much out of\r\nthe Union as Japan; had they been strong enough, they would have\r\ncontinued out of it; and what matters it where they were theoretically?\r\nWhy, until Queen Victoria, every English sovereign assumed the style of\r\nKing of France. The King of Sardinia was, and the King of Italy, we\r\nsuppose, is still titular King of Jerusalem. Did either monarch ever\r\nexercise sovereignty or levy taxes in those imaginary dominions? What\r\nthe war accomplished for us was the reduction of an insurgent\r\npopulation; and what it settled was, not the right of secession, for\r\nthat must always depend on will and strength, but that every inhabitant\r\nof every State was a subject as well as a citizen of the United\r\nStates,--in short, that the theory of freedom was limited by the\r\nequally necessary theory of authority. We hoped to hear less in future\r\nof the possible interpretations by which the Constitution may be made\r\nto mean this or that, and more of what will help the present need and\r\nconduce to the future strength and greatness of the whole country. It\r\nwas by precisely such constitutional quibbles, educating men to believe\r\nthey had a right to claim whatever they could sophistically demonstrate\r\nto their own satisfaction,--and self-interest is the most cunning of\r\nsophists,--that we were interpreted, in spite of ourselves, into civil\r\nwar. It was by just such a misunderstanding of one part of the country\r\nby another as that to which Mr. Johnson has lent the weight of his name\r\nand the authority of his place, that rendered a hearty national\r\nsympathy, and may render a lasting reorganization, impossible.\r\n\r\nIf history were still written as it was till within two centuries, and\r\nthe author put into the mouth of his speakers such words as his\r\nconception of the character and the situation made probable and\r\nfitting, we could conceive an historian writing a hundred years hence\r\nto imagine some such speech as this for Mr. Johnson in an interview\r\nwith a Southern delegation.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I am glad to meet you once more as friends, I wish I might\r\nsay as fellow-citizens. How soon we may again stand in that relation to\r\neach other depends wholly upon yourselves. You have been pleased to say\r\nthat my birth and lifelong associations gave you confidence that I\r\nwould be friendly to the South. In so saying, you do no more than\r\njustice to my heart and my intentions; but you must allow me to tell\r\nyou frankly, that, if you use the word South in any other than a purely\r\ngeographical sense, the sooner you convince yourselves of its\r\nimpropriety as addressed to an American President, the better. The\r\nSouth as a political entity was Slavery, and went out of existence with\r\nit. And let me also, as naturally connected with this topic, entreat\r\nyou to disabuse your minds of the fatally mistaken theory that you have\r\nbeen conquered by the North. It is the American people who are victors\r\nin this conflict, and who intend to inflict no worse penalty on you\r\nthan that of admitting you to an entire equality with themselves. They\r\nare resolved, by God's grace, to Americanize you, and America means\r\neducation, equality before the law, and every upward avenue of life\r\nmade as free to one man as another. You urge upon me, with great force\r\nand variety of argument, the manifold evils of the present unsettled\r\nstate of things, the propriety and advantage of your being represented\r\nin both houses of Congress, the injustice of taxation without\r\nrepresentation. I admit the importance of every one of these\r\nconsiderations, but I think you are laboring under some misapprehension\r\nof the actual state of affairs. I know not if any of you have been in\r\nAmerica since the spring of 1861, or whether (as I rather suspect) you\r\nhave all been busy in Europe endeavoring to--but I beg pardon, I did\r\nnot intend to say anything that should recall old animosities. But\r\nintelligence is slow to arrive in any part of the world, and\r\nintelligence from America painfully so in reaching Europe. You do not\r\nseem to be aware that _something has happened here during the last\r\nfour years_, something that has made a very painful and lasting\r\nimpression on the memory of the American people, whose voice on this\r\noccasion I have the honor to be. They feel constrained to demand that\r\nyou shall enter into bonds to keep the peace. They do not, I regret to\r\nsay, agree with you in looking upon what has happened here of late as\r\nonly a more emphatic way of settling a Presidential election, the\r\nresult of which leaves both parties entirely free to try again. They\r\nseem to take the matter much more seriously. Nor do they, so far as I\r\ncan see, agree with you in your estimate of the importance of\r\nconserving your several state sovereignties, as you continue to call\r\nthem, insisting much rather on the conservation of America and of\r\nAmerican ideas. They say that the only thing which can individualize or\r\nperpetuate a commonwealth is to have a history; and they ask which of\r\nthe States lately in rebellion, except Virginia and South Carolina, had\r\nanything of the kind? In spite of my natural sympathies, gentlemen, my\r\nreason compels me to agree with them. Your strength, such as it was,\r\nwas due less to the fertility of your brains than to that of your soil\r\nand to the invention of the Yankee Whitney which you used and never\r\npaid for. You tell me it is hard to put you on a level with your\r\nnegroes. As a believer in the superiority of the white race, I cannot\r\nadmit the necessity of enforcing that superiority by law. A Roman\r\nemperor once said that gold never retained the unpleasant odor of its\r\nsource, and I must say to you that loyalty is sweet to me, whether it\r\nthrob under a black skin or a white. The American people has learned of\r\nlate to set a greater value on the color of ideas than on shades of\r\ncomplexion. As to the injustice of taxation without representation,\r\nthat is an idea derived from our English ancestors, and is liable, like\r\nall rules, to the exceptions of necessity. I see no reason why a State\r\nmay not as well be disfranchised as a borough for an illegal abuse of\r\nits privileges; nor do I quite feel the parity of the reason which\r\nshould enable you to do that with a loyal black which we may not do\r\nwith a disloyal white. Remember that this government is bound by every\r\nobligation, ethical and political, to protect these people because they\r\nare weak, and to reward them (if the common privilege of manhood may be\r\ncalled a reward) because they are faithful. We are not fanatics, but a\r\nnation that has neither faith in itself nor faith toward others must\r\nsoon crumble to pieces by moral dry-rot. If we may conquer you,\r\ngentlemen, (and you forced the necessity upon us,) we may surely impose\r\nterms upon you; for it is an old principle of law that _cui liceat\r\nmajus, ei licet etiam minus_.\r\n\r\n\"In your part of the country, gentlemen, that which we should naturally\r\nappeal to as the friend of order and stability--property--is blindly\r\nagainst us; prejudice is also against us; and we have nothing left to\r\nwhich we can appeal but human nature and the common privilege of\r\nmanhood. You seem to have entertained some hope that I would gather\r\nabout myself a 'President's party,' which should be more friendly to\r\nyou and those animosities which you mistake for interests. But you\r\ngrossly deceive yourselves; I have nor sympathy but with my whole\r\ncountry, and there is nothing out of which such a party as you dream of\r\ncould be constructed, except the broken remnant of those who deserted\r\nyou when for the first time you needed their help and not their\r\nsubserviency, and those feathery characters who are drawn hither and\r\nthither by the chances of office. I need not say to you that I am and\r\ncan be nothing in this matter but the voice of the nation's deliberate\r\nresolve. The recent past is too painful, the immediate future too\r\nmomentous, to tolerate any personal considerations. You throw\r\nyourselves upon our magnanimity, and I must be frank with you. My\r\npredecessor, Mr. Buchanan, taught us the impolicy of weakness and\r\nconcession. The people are magnanimous, but they understand by\r\nmagnanimity a courageous steadiness in principle. They do not think it\r\npossible that a large heart should consist with a narrow brain; and\r\nthey would consider it pusillanimous in them to consent to the weakness\r\nof their country by admitting you to a share in its government before\r\nyou have given evidence of sincere loyalty to its principles, or, at\r\nleast, of wholesome fear of its power. They believe, and I heartily\r\nagree with them, that a strong nation begets strong citizens, and a\r\nweak one weak,--that the powers of the private man are invigorated and\r\nenlarged by his confidence in the power of the body politic; and they\r\nsee no possible means of attaining or securing this needed strength but\r\nin that homogeneousness of laws and institutions which breeds unanimity\r\nof ideas and sentiments, no way of arriving at that homogeneousness but\r\nthe straightforward path of perfect confidence in freedom. All nations\r\nhave a right to security, ours to greatness; and must have the one as\r\nan essential preliminary to the other. If your prejudices stand in the\r\nway, and you are too weak to rid yourselves of them, it will be for the\r\nAmerican people to consider whether the plain duty of conquering them\r\nfor you will be, after all, so difficult a conquest as some they have\r\nalready achieved. By yourselves or us they must be conquered.\r\nGentlemen, in bidding you farewell, I ask you to consider whether you\r\nhave not forgotten that, in order to men's living peacefully together\r\nin communities, the idea of government must precede that of liberty,\r\nand that the one is as much the child of necessity as the other is a\r\nslow concession to civilization, which itself mainly consists in the\r\nhabit of obedience to something more refined than force.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEWARD-JOHNSON REACTION\r\n\r\n1866\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Philadelphia experiment at making a party out of nullities\r\nreminds us of nothing so much as of the Irishman's undertaking to\r\nproduce a very palatable soup out of no more costly material than a\r\npebble. Of course he was to be furnished with a kettle as his field of\r\noperations, and after that he asked only for just the least bit of beef\r\nin the world to give his culinary miracle a flavor, and a pinch of salt\r\nby way of relish. As nothing could be more hollow and empty than the\r\npretence on which the new movement was founded, nothing more coppery\r\nthan the material out of which it was mainly composed, we need look no\r\nfurther for the likeness of a kettle wherewith to justify our\r\ncomparison; as for the stone, nothing could be more like that than the\r\nNorthern disunion faction, which was to be the chief ingredient in the\r\nnewfangled pottage, and whose leading characteristic for the last five\r\nyears has been a uniform alacrity in going under; the offices in the\r\ngift of the President might very well be reckoned on to supply the beef\r\nwhich should lead by their noses the weary expectants whose hunger\r\nmight be too strong for their nicety of stomach; and the pinch of\r\nsalt,--why could not that be found in the handful of Republicans who\r\nmight be drawn over by love of notoriety, private disgusts, or that\r\nmixture of motives which has none of the substance of opinion, much\r\nless of the tenacity of principle, but which is largely operative in\r\nthe action of illogical minds? But the people? Would they be likely to\r\nhave their appetite aroused by the fumes of this thin decoction? Where\r\na Chinaman is cook, one is apt to be a little suspicious; and if the\r\nAddress in which the Convention advertised their ingenious mess had not\r\na little in its verbiage to remind one of the flowery kingdom, there\r\nwas something in that part of the assemblage which could claim any\r\nbygone merit of Republicanism calculated to stimulate rather than to\r\nallay any dreadful surmise of the sagacious rodent which our antipodes\r\nare said to find savory. And as for the people, it is a curious fact,\r\nthat the party which has always been loudest to profess its faith in\r\ntheir capacity of self-government has been the last to conceive it\r\npossible that they should apprehend a principle, arrive at a logical\r\nconclusion, or be influenced by any other than a mean motive. The\r\n_cordons bleus_ of the political cooks at Philadelphia were men\r\nadmirably adapted for the petty intrigues of a local caucus, but by\r\ndefect of nature profoundly unconscious of that simple process of\r\ngeneralization from a few plain premises by which the popular mind is\r\nguided in times like these, and upon questions which appeal to the\r\nmoral instincts of men.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was well managed, we freely admit,--and why not, when\r\nall those who were allowed to have any leading part in it belonged\r\nexclusively to that class of men who are known as party managers, and\r\nwho, like the director of a theatre or a circus, look upon the mass of\r\nmankind as creatures to be influenced by a taking title, by amplitude\r\nof posters, and by a thrilling sensation or two, no matter how coarse?\r\nAs for the title, nothing could be better than that of the \"Devoted\r\nUnionists,\"--and were not the actors, no less than the scenery and\r\ndecorations, for the most part entirely new,--at least in that\r\nparticular play? Advertisement they did not lack, with the whole\r\nDemocratic press and the Department of State at their service, not to\r\nspeak of the real clown being allowed to exhibit himself at short\r\nintervals upon the highest platform in this or any other country. And\r\nif we ask for sensation, never were so many performers exhibited\r\ntogether in their grand act of riding two horses at once, or leaping\r\nthrough a hoop with nothing more substantial to resist them than the\r\ntissue-paper of former professions, nay, of recent pledges. And yet the\r\nskill of the managers had something greater still behind, in\r\nMassachusetts linked arm in arm with South Carolina. To be sure, a\r\nthoughtful mind might find something like a false syllogism in pairing\r\noff a Commonwealth whose greatest sin it has been to lead the van in\r\nfreedom of opinion, and in those public methods of enlightenment which\r\nmake it a safeguard of popular government, with an Oligarchy whose\r\nleadership has been in precisely the opposite direction, as if both had\r\nequally sinned against American ideas. But such incongruities are\r\ntrifles no greater than those of costume so common on every stage; and\r\nperhaps the only person to be pitied in the exhibition was Governor\r\nOrr, who had once uttered a hope that his own State might one day walk\r\nabreast with the daughter of Puritan forethought in the nobler\r\nprocession of prosperous industry, and who must have felt a slight\r\nshock of surprise, if nothing more, at the form in which Massachusetts\r\nhad chosen to incarnate herself on that particular occasion. We cannot\r\ncongratulate the Convention on the name of its chairman, for there is\r\nsomething ominously suggestive in it. But, on the other hand it is to\r\nbe remembered that Mr. Doolittle has a remarkably powerful voice, which\r\nis certainly one element in the manufacture of sound opinions. A little\r\ntoo much latitude was allowed to Mr. Raymond in the Address, though on\r\nthe whole perhaps it was prudent to make that document so long as to\r\ninsure it against being read. In their treatment of Mr. Vallandigham\r\nthe managers were prudent. He was allowed to appear just enough not\r\nquite to alienate his party, on whom the new movement counts largely\r\nfor support, and just not enough to compromise the Convention with the\r\nnew recruits it had made among those who would follow the name\r\nConservative into anything short of downright anarchy. The Convention,\r\nit must be confessed, had a rather hard problem to solve,--nothing less\r\nthan to make their patent reconciliation cement out of fire and\r\ngunpowder, both useful things in themselves, but liable in concert to\r\nbring about some odd results in the way of harmonious action. It is\r\ngenerally thought wiser to keep them apart, and accordingly Mr.\r\nVallandigham was excluded from the Convention altogether, and the\r\nSouthern delegates were not allowed any share in the Address or\r\nResolutions. Indeed, as the Northern members were there to see what\r\nthey could make, and the Southern to find out how much they could save,\r\nand whatever could be made or saved was to come out of the North, it\r\nwas more prudent to leave all matters of policy in the hands of those\r\nwho were supposed to understand best the weak side of the intended\r\nvictim. The South was really playing the game, and is to have the\r\nlion's share of the winnings; but it is only as a disinterested\r\nbystander, who looks over the cards of one of the parties, and guides\r\nhis confederate by hints so adroitly managed as not to alarm the\r\npigeon. The Convention avoided the reef where the wreck of the Chicago\r\nlies bleaching; but we are not so sure that they did not ground\r\nthemselves fast upon the equally dangerous mud-bank that lies on the\r\nopposite side of the honest channel. At Chicago they were so precisely\r\nfrank as to arouse indignation; at Philadelphia they are so careful of\r\ngeneralities that they make us doubtful, if not suspicious. Does the\r\nexpectation or even the mere hope of pudding make the utterance as\r\nthick as if the mouth were already full of it? As to the greater part\r\nof the Resolutions, they were political truisms in which everybody\r\nwould agree as so harmless that the Convention might almost as well\r\nhave resolved the multiplication table article by article. The Address\r\nwas far less explicit; and where there is so very much meal, it is\r\nperhaps not altogether uncharitable to suspect that there may be\r\nsomething under it. There is surely a suspicious bulge here and there,\r\nthat has the look of the old Democratic cat. But, after all, of what\r\nconsequence are the principles of the party, when President Johnson\r\ncovers them all when he puts on his hat, and may change them between\r\ndinner and tea, as he has done several times already? The real\r\nprinciple of the party, its seminal and vital principle alike, is the\r\npower of the President, and its policy is every moment at the mercy of\r\nhis discretion. That power has too often been the plaything of whim,\r\nand that discretion the victim of ill-temper or vanity, for us to have\r\nany other feeling left than regret for the one and distrust of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe new party does not seem to have drawn to itself any great accession\r\nof strength from the Republican side, or indeed to have made many\r\nconverts that were not already theirs in fact, though not in name. It\r\nwas joined, of course, at once by the little platoon of gentlemen\r\ncalling themselves, for some mystical reason, Conservatives, who have\r\nfor some time been acting with the Democratic faction, carefully\r\nkeeping their handkerchiefs to their noses all the while. But these\r\ninvoluntary Catos are sure, as if by instinct, to choose that side\r\nwhich is doomed not to please the gods, and their adhesion is as good\r\nas a warranty of defeat. During the President's progress they must\r\noften have been driven to their handkerchiefs again. It was a great\r\nblunder of Mr. Seward to allow him to assume the apostolate of the new\r\ncreed in person, for every word he has uttered must have convinced\r\nmany, even of those unwilling to make the admission, that a doctrine\r\ncould hardly be sound which had its origin and derives its power from a\r\nsource so impure. For so much of Mr. Johnson's harangues as is not\r\npositively shocking, we know of no parallel so close as in his Imperial\r\nMajesty Kobes I.:--\r\n\r\n    \"Er ruehmte dass er nie studirt\r\n      Auf Universitaeten\r\n    Und Reden sprachi aus sich selbst heraus,\r\n      Ganz ohne Facultaeten.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when we consider his power of tears; when we remember Mr. Reverdy\r\nJohnson and Mr. Andrew Johnson confronting each other like two augurs,\r\nthe one trying not to laugh while he saw the other trying to cry; when\r\nwe recall the touching scene at Canandaigua, where the President was\r\noverpowered by hearing the pathetic announcement that Stephen A.\r\nDouglas had for two years attended the academy in what will doubtless\r\nhenceforward be dubbed that \"classic locality,\" we cannot help thinking\r\nof\r\n\r\n    \"In seinem schoenen Auge glaenzt\r\n        Die Thraene, die Stereotype.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, if the exhibition of himself were not so profoundly sad, when\r\nwe think of the high place he occupies and the great man he succeeded\r\nin it, nothing could well be so comic as some of the incidents of Mr.\r\nJohnson's tour. No satirist could have conceived anything so\r\nbewitchingly absurd as the cheers which greeted the name of Simeon at\r\nthe dinner in New York, whether we suppose the audience to have thought\r\nhim some eminent member of their party of whom they had never heard, or\r\nwhom they had forgotten as thoroughly as they had Mr. Douglas, or if we\r\nconsider that they were involuntarily giving vent to their delight at\r\nthe pleasing prospect opened by their \"illustrious guest's\" allusion to\r\nhis speedy departure. Nor could anything have been imagined beforehand\r\nso ludicrously ominous as Mr. Seward's fears lest the platform should\r\nbreak down under them at Niagara. They were groundless fears, it is\r\ntrue, for the Johnson platform gave way irreparably on the 22d of\r\nFebruary; but they at least luckily prevented Nicholas Bottom Cromwell\r\nfrom uttering his after-dinner threat against the people's immediate\r\nrepresentatives, against the very body whose vote supplies the funds of\r\nhis party, and whose money, it seems, is constitutional, even if its\r\nown existence as a Congress be not. We pity Mr. Seward in his new\r\noffice of bear-leader. How he must hate his Bruin when it turns out\r\nthat his tricks do not even please the crowd!\r\n\r\nBut the ostensible object of this indecent orgy seems to us almost as\r\ndiscreditable as the purpose it veiled so thinly. Who was Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, that the President, with his Cabinet and the two highest\r\nofficers of the army and navy, should add their official dignity to the\r\nraising of his monument, and make the whole country an accomplice in\r\nconsecrating his memory? His name is not associated with a single\r\nmeasure of national importance, unless upon the wrong side. So far was\r\nhe from being a statesman that, even on the lower ground of politics,\r\nboth his principles and his expression of them were tainted with the\r\nreek of vulgar associations. A man of naturally great abilities he\r\ncertainly was, but wholly without that instinct for the higher\r\natmosphere of thought or ethics which alone makes them of value to any\r\nbut their possessor, and without which they are more often dangerous\r\nthan serviceable to the commonwealth. He habitually courted those\r\nweaknesses in the people which tend to degrade them into a populace,\r\ninstead of appealing to the virtues that grow by use, and whose mere\r\nacknowledgment in a man in some sort ennobles him. And by doing this he\r\nproved that he despised the very masses whose sweet breaths he wooed,\r\nand had no faith in the system under which alone such a one as he could\r\nhave been able to climb so high. He never deserted the South to take\r\nside with the country till the South had both betrayed and deserted\r\nhim. If such a man were the fairest outcome of Democracy, then is it\r\nindeed a wretched failure. But for the factitious importance given to\r\nhis name by the necessity of furnishing the President with a pretext\r\nfor stumping the West in the interest of Congress, Mr. Douglas would be\r\nwellnigh as utterly forgotten as Cass or Tyler, or Buchanan or\r\nFillmore; nor should we have alluded to him now but that the recent\r\npilgrimage has made his name once more public property, and because we\r\nthink it a common misfortune when such men are made into saints, though\r\nfor any one's advantage but their own. We certainly have no wish to\r\nplay the part of _advocatus diaboli_ on such an occasion, even were it\r\nnecessary at a canonization where the office of Pontifex Maximus is so\r\nappropriately filled by Mr. Johnson.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the late unhappy exposure of the unseemly side of\r\ndemocratic institutions, we have been far from desirous of insisting on\r\nMr. Seward's share in it. We endeavored to account for it at first by\r\nsupposing that the Secretary of State, seeing into the hands of how\r\nvain and weak a man the reins of administration had fallen, was\r\nwilling, by flattering his vanity, to control his weakness for the\r\npublic good. But we are forced against our will to give up any such\r\ntheory, and to confess that Mr. Seward's nature has been \"subdued to\r\nwhat it works in.\" We see it with sincere sorrow, and are far from\r\nadding our voice to the popular outcry against a man the long and\r\nhonorable services of whose prime we are not willing to forget in the\r\ndecline of his abilities and that dry-rot of the mind's nobler temper\r\nwhich so often results from the possession of power. Long contact with\r\nthe meaner qualities of men, to whose infection place and patronage are\r\nso unhappily exposed, could not fail of forcing to a disproportionate\r\ngrowth any germs of that cynicism always latent in temperaments so\r\nexclusively intellectual and unmitigated by any kindly lenitive of\r\nhumor. Timid by nature, the war which he had prophesied, but had not\r\nforeseen, and which invigorated bolder men, unbraced him; and while the\r\nspendthrift verbosity of his despatches was the nightmare of foreign\r\nministries, his uncertain and temporizing counsels were the perpetual\r\ndiscouragement of his party at home. More than any minister with whose\r\nofficial correspondence we are acquainted, he carried the principle of\r\npaper money into diplomacy, and bewildered Earl Russell and M. Drouyn\r\nde Lhuys with a horrible doubt as to the real value of the verbal\r\ncurrency they were obliged to receive. But, unfortunately, his own\r\ncountrymen were also unprovided with a price-current of the latest\r\nquotation in phrases, and the same gift of groping and inconclusive\r\ngeneralities which perhaps was useful as a bewilderment to would-be\r\nhostile governments abroad was often equally effective in disheartening\r\nthe defenders of nationality at home. We cannot join with those who\r\naccuse Mr. Seward of betraying his party, for we think ourselves\r\njustified by recent events in believing that he has always looked upon\r\nparties as the mere ladders of ambitious men; and when his own broke\r\nunder him at Chicago in 1860, he forthwith began to cast about for\r\nanother, the rounds of which might be firmer under his feet. He is not\r\nthe first, and we fear will not be the last, of our public men who have\r\nthought to climb into the White House by a back window, and have come\r\nignominiously to the ground in attempting it. Mr. Seward's view of the\r\nmatter probably is that the Republican party deserted him six years\r\nago, and that he was thus absolved of all obligations to it. But might\r\nthere not have been such a thing as fidelity to its principles? Or was\r\nMr. Seward drawn insensibly into the acceptance of them by the drift of\r\npolitical necessity, and did he take them up as if they were but the\r\nhand that had been dealt him in the game, not from any conviction of\r\ntheir moral permanence and power, perhaps with no perception of it, but\r\nfrom a mere intellectual persuasion of the use that might be made of\r\nthem politically and for the nonce by a skilful gamester? We should be\r\nvery unwilling to admit such a theory of his character; but surely what\r\nwe have just seen would seem to justify it, for we can hardly conceive\r\nthat any one should suddenly descend from real statesmanship to the use\r\nof such catch-rabble devices as those with which he has lately\r\ndisgusted the country. A small politician cannot be made out of a great\r\nstatesman, for there is an oppugnancy of nature between the two things,\r\nand we may fairly suspect the former winnings of a man who has been\r\nonce caught with loaded dice in his pocket. However firm may be Mr.\r\nSeward's faith in the new doctrine of Johnsonian infallibility, surely\r\nhe need not have made himself a partner in its vulgarity. And yet he\r\nhas attempted to vie with the Jack-pudding tricks of the unrivalled\r\nperformer whose man-of-business he is, in attempting a _populacity_\r\n(we must coin a new word for a new thing) for which he was exquisitely\r\nunfitted. What more stiffly awkward than his essays at easy\r\nfamiliarity? What more painfully remote from drollery than his efforts\r\nto be droll? In the case of a man who descends so far as Mr. Seward,\r\nsuch feats can be characterized by no other word so aptly as by\r\ntumbling. The thing would be sad enough in any prominent man, but in\r\nhim it becomes a public shame, for in the eyes of the world it is the\r\nnation that tumbles in its Prime Minister. The Secretary of State's\r\nplace may be dependent on the President, but the dignity of it belongs\r\nto the country, and neither of them has any right to trifle with it.\r\nMr. Seward might stand on his head in front of what Jenkins calls his\r\n\"park gate,\" at Auburn, and we should be the last to question his\r\nperfect right as a private citizen to amuse himself in his own way, but\r\nin a great officer of the government such pranks are no longer\r\nharmless. They are a national scandal, and not merely so, but a\r\nnational detriment, inasmuch as they serve to foster in foreign\r\nstatesman a profound misapprehension of the American people and of the\r\nmotives which influence them in questions of public policy. Never was\r\nso great a wrong done to democracy, nor so great an insult offered to\r\nit, as in this professional circuit of the presidential Punch and his\r\nministerial showman.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the exhibitions of this unlucky pair, and their passing\r\nround the hat without catching even the greasy pence they courted,\r\nhave very little to do with the great question to be decided at the\r\nnext elections, except in so far as we may be justified in suspecting\r\ntheir purity of motive who could consent to such impurity of means,\r\nand the soundness of their judgment in great things who in small ones\r\nshow such want of sagacity. The crowds they have drawn are no index of\r\npopular approval. We remember seeing the prodigious nose of Mr. Tyler\r\n(for the person behind it had been added by nature merely as the handle\r\nto so fine a hatchet) drawn by six white horses through the streets,\r\nand followed by an eager multitude, nine tenths of whom thought the\r\nman belonging to it a traitor to the party which had chosen him. But\r\nthen the effigy at least of a grandiose, if not a great man, sat beside\r\nhim, and the display was saved from contempt by the massive shape of\r\nWebster, beneath which he showed like a swallow against a thunder-cloud.\r\nEven Mr. Fillmore, to whom the Fugitive Slave Law denies the complete\r\nboon of an otherwise justly earned oblivion, had some dignity given to\r\nhis administration by the presence of Everett. But in this late\r\nadvertising-tour of a policy in want of a party, Cleon and Agoracritus\r\nseem to have joined partnership, and the manners of the man match those\r\nof the master. Mr. Johnson cannot so much as hope for the success in\r\nescaping memory achieved by the last of those small Virginians whom the\r\ntraditionary fame of a State once fertile in statesmen lifted to four\r\nyears of imperial pillory, where his own littleness seemed to heighten\r\nrather than lower the grandeur of his station; his name will not be\r\nassociated with the accomplishment of a great wrong against humanity,\r\nlet us hope not with the futile attempt at one; but he will be\r\nindignantly remembered as the first, and we trust the last, of our\r\nchief magistrates who believed in the brutality of the people, and gave\r\nto the White House the ill-savor of a corner-grocery. _He_ a tribune of\r\nthe people? A lord of misrule, an abbot of unreason, much rather!\r\n\r\nNo one can object more strongly than we to the mixing of politics with\r\npersonal character; but they are here inextricably entangled together,\r\nand we hold it to be the duty of every journal in the country to join\r\nin condemning a spectacle which silence might seem to justify as a\r\ncommon event in our politics. We turn gladly from the vulgarity of the\r\nPresident and his minister to consider the force of their arguments.\r\nMr. Johnson seems to claim that he has not betrayed the trust to which\r\nhe was elected, mainly because the Union party have always affirmed\r\nthat the rebellious States could not secede, and therefore _ex vi\r\ntermini_ are still in the Union. The corollary drawn from this is,\r\nthat they have therefore a manifest right to immediate representation\r\nin Congress. What we have always understood the Union party as meaning\r\nto affirm was, that a State had no right to secede; and it was upon\r\nthat question, which is a very different thing from the other, that the\r\nwhole controversy hinged. To assert that a State or States could not\r\nsecede, if they were strong enough, would be an absurdity. In point of\r\nfact, all but three of the Slave States did secede, and for four years\r\nit would have been treason throughout their whole territory, and death\r\non the nearest tree, to assert the contrary. The law forbids a man to\r\nsteal, but he may steal, nevertheless; and then, if he had Mr.\r\nJohnson's power as a logician, he might claim to escape all penalty by\r\npleading that when the law said _should not_ it meant _could\r\nnot_, and therefore he _had not_. If a four years' war, if a\r\nhalf million lives, and if a debt which is counted by the thousand\r\nmillion are not satisfactory proofs that somebody did contrive to\r\nsecede practically, whatever the theoretic right may have been, then\r\nnothing that ought not to be done ever has been done. We do not,\r\nhowever, consider the question as to whether the Rebel States were\r\nconstitutionally, or in the opinion of any political organization, out\r\nof the Union or not as of the least practical importance; for we have\r\nnever known an instance in which any party has retreated into the\r\nthickets and swamps of constitutional interpretation, where it had the\r\nleast chance of maintaining its ground in the open field of common\r\nsense or against the pressure of popular will. The practical fact is,\r\nthat the will of the majority, or the national necessity for the time\r\nbeing, has always been constitutional; which is only as much as to say\r\nthat the Convention of 1787 was not wholly made up of inspired\r\nprophets, who could provide beforehand for every possible contingency.\r\nThe doctrine of a strict and even pettifogging interpretation of the\r\nConstitution had its rise among men who looked upon that instrument as\r\na treaty, and at a time when the conception of a national power which\r\nshould receive that of the States into its stream as tributary was\r\nsomething which had entered the head of only here and there a dreamer.\r\nThe theorists of the Virginia school would have dammed up and diverted\r\nthe force of each State into a narrow channel of its own, with its\r\nlittle saw-mill and its little grist-mill for local needs, instead of\r\nletting it follow the slopes of the continental water-shed to swell the\r\nvolume of one great current ample for the larger uses and needful for\r\nthe higher civilization of all. That there should always be a school\r\nwho interpret the Constitution by its letter is a good thing, as\r\ninterposing a check to hasty or partial action, and gaining time for\r\nample discussion; but that in the end we should be governed by its\r\nspirit, living and operative in the energies of an advancing people, is\r\na still better thing; since the levels and shore-lines of politics are\r\nno more stationary than those of continents, and the ship of state\r\nwould in time be left aground far inland, to long in vain for that open\r\nsea which is the only pathway to fortune and to glory.\r\n\r\nEqually idle with the claim that the Union party is foreclosed from now\r\ndealing with the Rebel States as seceded, because four years ago it\r\ndeclared that they had no right to secede, is the assertion that the\r\nobject of the war was proclaimed to be for the restoration of the Union\r\nand the Constitution as they were. Even were we to admit that 1861 is\r\nthe same thing as 1866, the question comes back again to precisely the\r\npoint that is at issue between the President and Congress, namely, What\r\nis the wisest way of restoring the Union? for which both profess\r\nthemselves equally anxious. As for the Constitution, we cannot have\r\nthat as it was, but only as its framers hoped it would be, with its one\r\nweak and wicked element excluded. But as to Union, are we in favor of a\r\nUnion in form or in fact? of a Union on the map and in our national\r\nstyle merely, or one of ideas, interests, and aspirations? If we cannot\r\nhave the latter, the former is a delusion and a snare; and the strength\r\nof the nation would be continually called away from prosperous toil to\r\nbe wasted in holding a wolf by the ears, which would still be a wolf,\r\nand known by all our enemies for such, though we called heaven and\r\nearth to witness, in no matter how many messages or resolves, that the\r\ninnocent creature was a lamb. That somebody has a right to dictate some\r\nkind of terms is admitted by Mr. Johnson's own repeated action in the\r\nmatter; but who that somebody should be, whether a single man, of whose\r\ndiscretion even his own partisans are daily becoming more doubtful, or\r\nthe immediate representatives of that large majority of the States and\r\nof the people who for the last five years have been forced against\r\ntheir will to represent and to be the United States, is certainly too\r\ngrave an affair to be settled by that single man himself.\r\n\r\nWe have seen to what extremes the party calling itself Conservative has\r\nhinted its willingness to go, under the plea of restored Union, but\r\nwith the object of regained power. At Philadelphia, they went as far as\r\nthey publicly dared in insinuating that the South would be justified in\r\nanother rebellion, and their journals have more than once prompted the\r\nPresident to violent measures, which would as certainly be his ruin as\r\nthey would lead to incalculable public disaster. The President himself\r\nhas openly announced something like a design of forcibly suppressing a\r\nCongress elected by the same votes and secured by the same guaranties\r\nthat elected him to his place and secure him in it,--a Congress whose\r\nvalidity he has acknowledged by sending in his messages to it, by\r\nsigning its bills, and by drawing his pay under its vote; and yet\r\nthinking men are not to be allowed to doubt the propriety of leaving\r\nthe gravest measure that ever yet came up for settlement by the country\r\nto a party and a man so reckless as these have shown themselves to be.\r\nMr. Johnson talks of the danger of centralization, and repeats the old\r\ndespotic fallacy of many tyrants being worse than one,--a fallacy\r\noriginally invented, and ever since repeated, as a slur upon democracy,\r\nbut which is a palpable absurdity when the people who are to be\r\ntyrannized over have the right of displacing their tyrants every two\r\nyears. The true many-headed tyrant is the Mob, that part of the\r\ndeliberative body of a nation which Mr. Johnson, with his Southern\r\nnotions of popular government, has been vainly seeking, that he might\r\npay court to it, from the seaboard to St. Louis, but which hardly\r\nexists, we are thankful to say, as a constituent body, in any part of\r\nthe Northern States outside the city of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, with that playfulness which sits upon him so gracefully,\r\nand which draws its resources from a reading so extensive that not even\r\n_John Gilpin_ has escaped its research, puts his argument to the people\r\nin a form where the Socratic and arithmetic methods are neatly\r\ncombined, and asks, \"How many States are there in the Union?\" He\r\nhimself answers his own question for an audience among whom it might\r\nhave been difficult to find any political adherent capable of so\r\narduous a solution, by asking another, \"Thirty-six?\" Then he goes on to\r\nsay that there is a certain party which insists that the number shall\r\nbe less by ten, and ends by the clincher, \"Now how many stars do you\r\nwish to see in your flag?\" The result of some of Mr. Johnson's\r\nharangues was so often a personal collision, in which the more ardent\r\non both sides had an opportunity to see any number of new\r\nconstellations, that this astronomical view of the case must have\r\nstruck the audience rather by its pertinence than its novelty. But in\r\nthe argument of the Secretary, as in that of the President, there is a\r\nmanifest confusion of logic, and something very like a _petitio\r\nprincipii_. We might answer Mr. Seward's question with, \"As many fixed\r\nstars as you please, but no more shooting stars with any consent of\r\nours.\" But really this matter is of more interest to heralds of arms\r\nthan to practical men. The difference between Congress and the\r\nPresident is not, as Mr. Seward would insinuate, that Congress or\r\nanybody else wishes to keep the ten States out, but that the Radical\r\nparty (we cheerfully accept our share in the opprobrium of the name)\r\ninsists that they shall come in on a footing of perfect equality with\r\nthe rest; while the President would reward them for rebellion by giving\r\nthem an additional weight of nearly one half in the national councils.\r\nThe cry of \"Taxation without representation\" is foolish enough as\r\nraised by the Philadelphia Convention, for do we not tax every\r\nforeigner that comes to us while he is in process of becoming a citizen\r\nand a voter? But under the Johnsonian theory of reconstruction, we\r\nshall leave a population which is now four millions not only taxed\r\nwithout representation, but doomed to be so forever without any\r\nreasonable hope of relief. The true point is not as to the abstract\r\nmerits of universal suffrage (though we believe it the only way toward\r\nan enlightened democracy and the only safeguard of popular government),\r\nbut as to whether we shall leave the freedmen without the only adequate\r\nmeans of self-defence. And however it may be now, the twenty-six States\r\ncertainly _were_ the Union when they accepted the aid of these people\r\nand pledged the faith of the government to their protection. Jamaica,\r\nat the end of nearly thirty years since emancipation, shows us how\r\ncompetent former masters are to accomplish the elevation of their\r\nliberated slaves, even though their own interests would prompt them to\r\nit. Surely it is a strange plea to be effective in a democratic\r\ncountry, that we owe these people nothing because they cannot help\r\nthemselves; as if governments were instituted for the care of the\r\nstrong only. The argument against their voting which is based upon\r\ntheir ignorance strikes us oddly in the mouths of those whose own hope\r\nof votes lies in the ignorance, or, what is often worse, the prejudice,\r\nof the voters. Besides, we do not demand that the seceding States\r\nshould at once confer the right of suffrage on the blacks, but only\r\nthat they should give them the same chance to attain it, and the same\r\ninducement to make themselves worthy of it, as to every one else. The\r\nanswer that they have not the right in some of the Northern States may\r\nbe a reproach to the intelligence of those States, but has no relevancy\r\nif made to the general government. It is not with these States that we\r\nare making terms or claim any right to make them, nor is the number of\r\ntheir non-voting population so large as to make them dangerous, or the\r\nprejudice against them so great that it may not safely be left to time\r\nand common sense. It was not till all men were made equal before the\r\nlaw, and the fact recognized that government is something that does not\r\nmerely preside over, but reside in, the rights of all, that even white\r\npeasants were enabled to rise out of their degradation, and to become\r\nthe strength instead of the danger of France. Nothing short of such a\r\nreform could have conquered the contempt and aversion with which the\r\nhigher classes looked upon the emancipated serf. Norman-French\r\nliterature reeks with the outbreak of this feeling toward the\r\nancestors, whether Jews or villeins, of the very men who are now the\r\naristocracy of South Carolina,--a feeling as intense, as nauseous in\r\nits expression, and as utterly groundless, as that against the negro\r\nnow. We are apt, it would seem, a little to confound the meaning of the\r\ntwo terms _government_ and _self-government_, and the principles on\r\nwhich they respectively rest. If the latter has its rights, the former\r\nhas quite as plainly its duties; and one of them certainly is to see\r\nthat no freedom should be allowed to the parts which would endanger the\r\nsafety of the whole. An occasion calling for the exercise of this duty\r\nis forced upon us now, and we must be equal to it. Self-government, in\r\nany rightful definition of it, can hardly be stretched so far that it\r\nwill cover, as the late Rebels and their Northern advocates contend,\r\nthe right to dispose absolutely of the destinies of four millions of\r\npeople, the allies and hearty friends of the United States, without\r\nallowing them any voice in the matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _William H. Seward_]\r\n\r\nIt is alleged by reckless party orators that those who ask for\r\nguaranties before readmitting the seceded States wish to treat them\r\nwith harshness, if not with cruelty. Mr. Thaddeus Stevens is\r\ntriumphantly quoted, as if his foolish violence fairly represented the\r\npolitical opinions of the Union party. They might as well be made\r\nresponsible for his notions of finance. We are quite willing to let Mr.\r\nStevens be paired off with Mr. Vallandigham, and to believe that\r\nneither is a fair exponent of the average sentiment of his party.\r\nCalling names should be left to children, with whom, as with too large\r\na class of our political speakers, it seems to pass for argument. We\r\nbelieve it never does so with the people; certainly not with the\r\nintelligent, who make a majority among them, unless (as in the case of\r\n\"Copperhead\") there be one of those hardly-to-be-defined realities\r\nbehind the name which they are so quick to detect. We cannot say that\r\nwe have any great sympathy for the particular form of mildness which\r\ndiscovers either a \"martyr,\" or a \"pure-hearted patriot,\" or even a\r\n\"lofty statesman,\" in Mr. Jefferson Davis, the latter qualification of\r\nhim having been among the discoveries of the London _Times_ when\r\nit thought his side was going to win; but we can say that nothing has\r\nsurprised us more, or seemed to us a more striking evidence of the\r\nhumanizing influence of democracy, than the entire absence of any\r\ntemper that could be called revengeful in the people of the North\r\ntoward their late enemies. If it be a part of that inconsistent mixture\r\nof purely personal motives and more than legitimate executive action\r\nwhich Mr. Johnson is pleased to call his \"policy,\"--if it be a part of\r\nthat to treat the South with all the leniency that is short of folly\r\nand all the conciliation that is short of meanness,--then we were\r\nadvocates of it before Mr. Johnson. While he was yet only ruminating in\r\nhis vindictive mind, sore with such rancor as none but a \"plebeian,\" as\r\nhe used to call himself, can feel against his social superiors, the\r\nonly really agrarian proclamation ever put forth by any legitimate\r\nruler, and which was countersigned by the now suddenly \"conservative\"\r\nSecretary of State, we were in favor of measures that should look to\r\ngoverning the South by such means as the South itself afforded, or\r\ncould be made to afford. It is true that, as a part of the South, we\r\nreckoned the colored people bound to us by every tie of honor, justice,\r\nand principle, but we never wished to wink out of sight the natural\r\nfeelings of men suddenly deprived of what they conceived to be their\r\nproperty,--of men, too, whom we respected for their courage and\r\nendurance even in a bad cause. But we believed then, as we believe now,\r\nand as events have justified us in believing, that there could be no\r\ngraver error than to flatter our own feebleness and uncertainty by\r\ncalling it magnanimity,--a virtue which does not scorn the society of\r\npatience and prudence, but which cannot subsist apart from courage and\r\nfidelity to principle. A people so boyish and conceited as the\r\nSoutherners have always shown themselves to be, unwilling ever to deal\r\nwith facts, but only with their own imagination of them, would be sure\r\nto interpret indecision as cowardice, if not as an unwilling tribute to\r\nthat superiority of which men who really possess it are the last to\r\nboast. They have learned nothing from the war but to hate the men who\r\nsubdued them, and to misinterpret and misrepresent the causes of their\r\nsubduing; and even now, when a feeling has been steadily growing in the\r\nrest of the country for the last nine months deeper and more intense\r\nthan any during the war, because mixed with an angry sense of\r\nunexpected and treacherous disappointment, instead of setting their\r\nstrength to the rebuilding of their shattered social fabric, they are\r\nwaiting, as they waited four years ago, for a division in the North\r\nwhich will never come, and hailing in Andrew Johnson a scourge of God\r\nwho is to avenge them in the desolation of our cities! Is it not time\r\nthat these men were transplanted at least into the nineteenth century,\r\nand, if they cannot be suddenly Americanized, made to understand\r\nsomething of the country which was too good for them, even though at\r\nthe cost of a rude shock to their childish self-conceit? Is that a\r\nproperly reconstructed Union in the Southern half of which no Northern\r\nman's life is safe except at the sacrifice of his conscience, his\r\nfreedom of speech, of everything but his love of money? To our minds\r\nthe providential purpose of this intervention of Mr. Johnson in our\r\naffairs is to warn us of the solemn duty that lies upon us in this\r\nsingle crisis of our history, when the chance is offered us of stamping\r\nour future with greatness or contempt, and which requires something\r\nlike statesmanship in the people themselves, as well as in those who\r\nact for them. The South insisted upon war, and has had enough of it; it\r\nis now our turn to insist that the peace we have conquered shall be so\r\nsettled as to make war impossible for the future.\r\n\r\nBut how is this to be done? The road to it is a very plain one. We\r\nshall gain all we want if we make the South really prosperous; for with\r\nprosperity will come roads, schools, churches, printing presses,\r\nindustry, thrift, intelligence, and security of life and property.\r\nHitherto the prosperity of the South has been factitious; it has been a\r\nprosperity of the Middle Ages, keeping the many poor that a few might\r\nshow their wealth in the barbarism of showy equipages and numerous\r\nservants, and spend in foreign cities the wealth that should have built\r\nup civilization and made way for refinement at home. There were no\r\npublic libraries, no colleges worthy of the name; there was no art, no\r\nscience,--still worse, no literature but Simms's: there was no desire\r\nfor them. We do not say it in reproach; we are simply stating a fact,\r\nand are quite aware that the North is far behind Europe in these\r\nthings. But we are not behind her in the value we set upon them; are\r\neven before her in the price we are willing to pay for them, and are in\r\nthe way to get them. The South was not in that way; could not get into\r\nit, indeed, so long as the labor that made wealth was cut off from any\r\ninterest in its expenditure, nor had any goal for such hopes as soared\r\naway from the dreary level of its lifelong drudgery but in the grave\r\nand the world beyond it. We are not blind to what may be said on the\r\nother side, nor to that fatal picturesqueness, so attractive to\r\nsentimental minds and so melancholy to thoughtful ones, which threw a\r\ncharm over certain exceptional modes of Southern life among the older\r\nfamilies in Virginia and South Carolina. But there are higher and\r\nmanlier kinds of beauty,--barer and sterner, some would call\r\nthem,--with less softly rounded edges, certainly, than the Wolf's Crag\r\npicturesqueness, which carries the mind with pensive indolence toward\r\nthe past, instead of stirring it with a sense of present life, or\r\nbracing it with the hope of future opportunity, and which at once veils\r\nand betrays the decay of ancient civilizations. Unless life is arranged\r\nfor the mere benefit of the novelist, what right had these bits of\r\nlast-century Europe here? Even the virtues of the South were some of\r\nthem anachronisms; and even those that were not existed side by side\r\nwith an obtuseness of moral sense that could make a hero of Semmes, and\r\na barbarism that could starve prisoners by the thousand.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers, to be sure, plead with us that the Southerners are\r\nremarkable for their smaller hands and feet, though so good an observer\r\nas Thackeray pronounced this to be true of the whole American people;\r\nbut really we cannot think such arguments as this will give any pause\r\nto the inevitable advance of that democracy, somewhat rude and raw as\r\nyet, a clumsy boy-giant, and not too well mannered, whose office it\r\nnevertheless is to make the world ready for the true second coming of\r\nChrist in the practical supremacy of his doctrine, and its incarnation,\r\nafter so many centuries of burial, in the daily lives of men. We have\r\nbeen but dimly, if at all, conscious of the greatness of our errand,\r\nwhile we have already accomplished a part of it in bringing together\r\nthe people of all nations to see each other no longer as aliens or\r\nenemies, but as equal partakers of the highest earthly dignity,--a\r\ncommon manhood. We have been forced, whether we would or no, first to\r\nendure, then to tolerate, and at last to like men from all the four\r\ncorners of the world, and to see that each added a certain virtue of\r\nhis own to that precious amalgam of which we are in due time to fashion\r\na great nation. We are now brought face to face with our duty toward\r\none of those dusky races that have long sat in the shadow of the world;\r\nwe are to be taught to see the Christ disguised also in these, and to\r\nfind at last that a part of our salvation is inextricably knit up with\r\nthe necessity of doing them justice and leading them to the light. This\r\nis no sentimental fancy; it is written in plain characters upon the\r\nvery surface of things. We have done everything to get rid of the\r\nnegro; and the more we did, the more he was thrust upon us in every\r\npossible relation of life and aspect of thought. One thing we have not\r\ntried,--a spell before which he would vanish away from us at once, by\r\ntaking quietly the place, whatever it be, to which Nature has assigned\r\nhim. We have not acknowledged him as our brother. Till we have done so\r\nhe will be always at our elbow, a perpetual discomfort to himself and\r\nus. Now this one thing that will give us rest is precisely what the\r\nSouth, if we leave the work of reconstruction in their hands, will make\r\nit impossible for us to do; and yet it must be done ere America can\r\npenetrate the Southern States. It is for this reason, and not with any\r\ndesire of establishing a standing garrison of four hundred thousand\r\nloyal voters in the South, that we insist on the absolute necessity of\r\njustice to the black man. Not that we have not a perfect right to\r\ndemand the reception of such a garrison, but we wish the South to\r\ngovern itself; and this it will never be able to do, it will be\r\ngoverned as heretofore by its circumstances, if we allow it to replace\r\nslavery by the disenfranchisement of color, and to make an Ireland out\r\nof what should be the most productive, populous, and happy part of the\r\nUnion. We may evade this manifest duty of ours from indolence, or\r\nindifference, or selfish haste; but if there is one truth truer than\r\nanother, it is that no man or nation ever neglected a duty that was not\r\nsooner or later laid upon them in a heavier form, to be done at a\r\ndearer rate. Neither man nor nation can find rest short of their\r\nhighest convictions.\r\n\r\nThis is something that altogether transcends any partisan politics. It\r\nis of comparatively little consequence to us whether Congress or the\r\nPresident carry the day, provided only that America triumph. That is,\r\nafter all, the real question. On which side is the future of the\r\ncountry,--the future that we cannot escape if we would, but which our\r\naction may embarrass and retard? If we had looked upon the war as a\r\nmere trial of physical strength between two rival sections of the\r\ncountry, we should have been the first to oppose it, as a wicked waste\r\nof treasure and blood. But it was something much deeper than this, and\r\nso the people of the North instinctively recognized it to be from the\r\nfirst,--instinctively, we say, and not deliberately at first; but\r\nbefore it was over, their understandings had grasped its true meaning,\r\nas an effort of the ideal America, which was to them half a dream and\r\nhalf a reality, to cast off an alien element. It was this ideal\r\nsomething, not the less strongly felt because vaguely defined, that\r\nmade them eager, as only what is above sordid motives can, to sacrifice\r\nall that they had and all that they were rather than fail in its\r\nattainment. And it is to men not yet cooled from the white-heat of this\r\npassionate mood that Mr. Johnson comes with his paltry offer of \"my\r\npolicy,\" in exchange for the logical consequences of all this devotion\r\nand this sacrifice. What is any one man's policy, and especially any\r\none weak man's policy, against the settled drift of a nation's\r\nconviction, conscience, and instinct? The American people had made up\r\nnot only their minds, but their hearts, and no man who knows anything\r\nof human nature could doubt what their decision would be. They wanted\r\nonly a sufficient obstacle to awaken them to a full consciousness of\r\nwhat was at stake, and that obstacle the obstinate vanity of the\r\nPresident and the blindness or resentment of his prime minister have\r\nsupplied. They are fully resolved to have the great stake they played\r\nfor and won, and that stake was the Americanization of all America,\r\nnothing more and nothing less. Mr. Johnson told us in New York, with so\r\nprofound a misconception of the feeling of the Northern States as was\r\nonly possible to a vulgar mind, and that mind a Southern one, that the\r\nSouth had set up slavery as its stake, and lost, and that now the North\r\nwas in danger of losing the stake it had risked on reconstruction in\r\nthe national debt. Mr. Johnson is still, it would seem, under that\r\ndelusion which led the South into the war; namely, that it was that\r\nsection of the country which was the chief element in its wealth and\r\ngreatness. But no Northern man, who, so long as he lives, will be\r\nobliged to pay his fine of taxes for the abolition of slavery which was\r\nforced upon us by the South, is likely to think it very hard that the\r\nSouth should be compelled to furnish its share toward the common\r\nburden, or will be afraid that the loyal States, whose urgent demands\r\ncompelled a timid Congress at last to impose direct taxes, will be\r\nunable to meet their obligations in the future, as in the past.\r\n\r\nWe say again that the questions before the country are not to be\r\ndecided on any grounds of personal prejudice or partiality. We are far\r\nfrom thinking that Congress has in all respects acted as became the\r\ndignity of its position, or seized all the advantage of the\r\nopportunity. They have seemed to us sometimes afraid of coming before\r\nthe people with a direct, frank, and simple statement of what was not\r\nonly the best thing that could be done, but the one thing that must be\r\ndone. They were afraid of the people, and did not count securely, as\r\nthey should have done, on that precious seeing which four years of\r\ngradually wakening moral sense had lent to the people's eyes. They\r\nshould not have shrunk from taking upon themselves and their party all\r\nthe odium of being in the right; of being on the side of justice,\r\nhumanity, and of the America which is yet to be, whoever may fear to\r\nhelp and whoever may try to hinder. The vulgar cry would be against\r\nthem, at any rate, and they might reckon on being accused of principles\r\nwhich they thought it prudent to conceal, whether they committed their\r\nparty to them or not. With those who have the strong side, as they\r\nalways do who have conscience for an ally, a bold policy is the only\r\nprosperous one. It is always wisest to accept in advance all the\r\nlogical consequences that can be drawn from the principles we profess,\r\nand to make a stand on the extremest limits of our position. It will be\r\ntime enough to fall back when we are driven out. In taking a half-way\r\nposition at first, we expose ourselves to all the disadvantage and\r\ndiscouragement of seeming to fight on a retreat, and cut ourselves off\r\nfrom our supplies. For the supplies of a party which is contending for\r\na clear principle, and not for its own immediate success, are always\r\ndrawn from the highest moral ground included in its lines. We are not\r\nspeaking here of abstractions or wire-drawn corollaries, but of those\r\nplain ethical axioms which every man may apprehend, and which are so\r\nclosely involved in the question now before the country for decision.\r\nWe at least could lose nothing by letting the people know exactly what\r\nwe meant; for we meant nothing that could not claim the suffrage of\r\nsincere democracy, of prudent statesmanship, or of jealousy for the\r\nnation's honor and safety. That the Republican party should be broken\r\nup is of comparatively little consequence; for it would be merged in\r\nthe stronger party of those who are resolved that no by-questions, no\r\nfallacies of generosity to the vanquished, shall turn it aside from the\r\none fixed purpose it has at heart; that the war shall not have been in\r\nvain; and that the Rebel States, when they return to the Union, shall\r\nreturn to it as an addition of power, and under such terms as that they\r\n_must_, and not merely _may_, be fixed there. Let us call things by\r\ntheir right names, and keep clearly in view both the nature of the\r\nthing vanquished and of the war in which we were victors. When men talk\r\nof generosity toward a suppliant foe, they entirely forget what that\r\nfoe really was. To the people of the South no one thinks of being\r\nunmerciful. But they were only the blind force wielded by our real\r\nenemy,--an enemy, prophesy what smooth things you will, with whom we\r\ncan never be reconciled and whom it would be madness to spare. And this\r\nenemy was not any body of kindred people, but that principle of evil\r\nfatally repugnant to our institutions, which, flinging away the hilt of\r\nits broken weapon, is now cheating itself with the hope that it can\r\nforge a new one of the soft and treacherous metal of Northern\r\ndisloyalty. The war can in no respect be called a civil war, though\r\nthat was what the South, in its rash ignorance, threatened the North\r\nwith. It was as much a war between two different nations, and the\r\ngeographical line was as distinctly drawn between them, as in the late\r\nwar between North and South Germany. They had been living, it is true,\r\nunder the same government, but the South regarded this as implying no\r\ntie more intimate than that which brought the representatives of\r\nPrussia and Austria together in the Frankfort Diet. We have the same\r\nright to impose terms and to demand guaranties that Prussia has, that\r\nthe victor always has.\r\n\r\nMany people are led to favor Mr. Johnson's policy because they dislike\r\nthose whom they please to call the \"Republican leaders.\" If ever a\r\nparty existed that had no recognized leaders, it is the Republican\r\nparty. Composed for the last five years, at least, of men who,\r\nthemselves professing all shades of opinion, were agreed only in a\r\ndetermination to sustain the honor and preserve the existence of the\r\nnation, it has been rather a majority than a party, employing the\r\nlegislative machine to carry out the purposes of public opinion. The\r\npeople were the true inspirers of all its measures, and accordingly it\r\nwas left without a definite policy the moment the mere politicians in\r\nits ranks became doubtful as to what direction the popular mind would\r\ntake. It had no recognized leader either in the House or Senate just at\r\nthe time when it first stood in need of such. The majority of its\r\nrepresentatives there tried in vain to cast any political horoscope by\r\nwhich it would be safe for them individually to be guided. They showed\r\nthe same distrust of the sound judgment of the people and their power\r\nto grasp principles that they showed at the beginning of the war, and\r\nat every discouraging moment while it was going on. Now that the signs\r\nof the times show unmistakably to what the popular mind is making\r\nitself up, they have once more a policy, if we may call that so which\r\nis only a calculation of what it would be \"safe to go before the people\r\nwith,\" as they call it. It is always safe to go before them with plain\r\nprinciples of right, and with the conclusions that must be drawn from\r\nthem by common sense, though this is what too many of our public men\r\ncan never understand. Now joining a Know-Nothing \"lodge,\" now hanging\r\non the outskirts of a Fenian \"circle,\" they mistake the momentary\r\neddies of popular whimsy for the great current that sets always\r\nstrongly in one direction through the life and history of the nation.\r\nIs it, as foreigners assert, the fatal defect of our system to fill our\r\nhighest offices with men whose views in politics are bounded by the\r\nnext district election? When we consider how noble the science\r\nis,--nobler even than astronomy, for it deals with the mutual\r\nrepulsions and attractions, not of inert masses, but of bodies endowed\r\nwith thought and will, calculates moral forces, and reckons the orbits\r\nof God's purposes toward mankind,--we feel sure that it is to find\r\nnobler teachers and students, and to find them even here.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of men who are honestly drawn toward the policy\r\nof what we are fain, for want of a more definite name, to call the\r\nPresidential Opposition party, by their approval of the lenient\r\nmeasures which they suppose to be peculiar to it. But our objection to\r\nthe measures advocated by the Philadelphia Convention, so far as we can\r\ntrace any definite shape amid the dust-cloud of words, is, not they\r\nwould treat the Rebel States with moderation, but that they propose to\r\ntake them back on trust. We freely admit that we should have been\r\ninclined to see more reasonableness in this course if we had not the\r\nexamples of Jamaica and New Orleans before our eyes; if we had not seen\r\nboth there and in other instances with which history supplies us, that\r\nit is not safe to leave the settlement of such matters in the hands of\r\nmen who would be more than human if they had not the prejudices and the\r\nresentments of caste. Here is just one of those cases of public concern\r\nwhich call for the arbitrament of a cool and impartial third\r\nparty,--the very office expected of a popular government,--which should\r\nas carefully abstain from meddling in matters that may be safely left\r\nto be decided by natural laws as it should be prompt to interfere where\r\nthose laws would to the general detriment be inoperative. It should be\r\nremembered that self-interest, though its requirements may seem plain\r\nand imperative to an unprejudiced bystander, is something which men,\r\nand even communities, are often ready to sacrifice at the bidding of\r\ntheir passions, and of none so readily as their pride. As for the\r\nattachment between master and slave, whose existence is sometimes\r\nasseverated in the face of so many glaring facts to the contrary, and\r\non which we are asked to depend as something stronger than written law,\r\nwe have very little faith in it. The system of clanship in the Scottish\r\nHighlands is the strongest case to which we can appeal in modern times\r\nof a truly patriarchal social order. In that, the pride of the chief\r\nwas answered by the willing devotion of the sept, and the two were\r\nbound together as closely as kindred blood, immemorial tradition, and\r\nmutual dependence could link them; and yet, the moment it became for\r\nthe interest of the chieftain, in whom alone was the landed title, to\r\nconvert the mountain slopes into sheep-walks, farewell to all\r\nconsiderations of ancestral legend and ideal picturesqueness! The\r\nclansmen were dispossessed of their little holdings, and shipped off to\r\nthe colonies like cattle, by the very men for whom they would have\r\ngiven their lives without question. The relation, just like that of\r\nmaster and slave, or the proposed one of superior and dependent, in the\r\nSouth, had become an anachronism, to preserve which would have been a\r\nvain struggle against that power of Necessity which the Greeks revered\r\nas something god-like. In our own case, so far from making it for the\r\ninterest of the ruling classes at the South to elevate the condition of\r\nthe black man, the policy of Mr. Johnson offers them a bribe to keep\r\nhim in a state of hopeless dependency and subjection. It gives them\r\nmore members of Congress in proportion as they have more unrepresented\r\ninhabitants. Mr. Beecher asks us (and we see no possible reason for\r\ndoubting the honesty of his opinions, whatever may be their soundness)\r\nwhether we are afraid of the South, and tells us that, if we allow them\r\nto govern us, we shall richly deserve it. It is not that we are afraid\r\nof, nor are we in the habit of forming our opinions on any such\r\nimaginary grounds; but we confess that we are afraid of committing an\r\nact of national injustice, of national dishonor, of national breach of\r\nfaith, and therefore of national unwisdom and weakness. Moderation is\r\nan excellent thing; but taking things for granted is not moderation,\r\nand there may be such a thing as being immoderate in concession and\r\nconfidence. Aristotle taught us long ago that true moderation was as\r\nfar from the too-much of blind passion on the one hand as from that of\r\nequally blind lukewarmness on the other. We have an example of wise\r\nreconstructive policy in that measure of the Bourbon-restoration\r\nministry, which compensated the returned emigrants for their\r\nconfiscated estates by a grant from the public treasury. And the\r\nmeasure was wise, for the reason that it enabled the new proprietors\r\nand the ousted ones to live as citizens of the same country together\r\nwithout mutual hatred and distrust. We do not propose to compensate the\r\nslaveholder for the loss of his chattels, because the cases are not\r\nparallel, and because Mr. Johnson no less than we acknowledges the\r\njustice and validity of their emancipation. But the situation of the\r\nnegro is strikingly parallel with that of the new holders of land in\r\nFrance. As they were entitled to security, so he has a right not only\r\nto be secured in his freedom, but in the consequences which\r\nlegitimately flow from it. For it is only so that he can be insured\r\nagainst that feeling of distrust and uncertainty of the future which\r\nwill prevent him from being profitable to himself, his former master,\r\nand the country. If we sought a parallel for Mr. Johnson's \"policy,\" we\r\nshould find it in James II., thinking his prerogative strong enough to\r\novercome the instincts, convictions, and fears of England.\r\n\r\nHowever much fair-minded men may have been wearied with the backing and\r\nfilling of Congress, and their uncertainty of action on some of the\r\nmost important questions that have come before them,--however the\r\ndignity, and even propriety, of their attitude toward Mr. Johnson may\r\nbe in some respects honestly called in question,--no one who has looked\r\nfairly at the matter can pronounce the terms they have imposed on the\r\nSouth as conditions of restoration harsh ones. The character of\r\nCongress is not before the country, but simply the character of the\r\nplan they propose. For ourselves, we should frankly express our disgust\r\nat the demagogism which courted the Fenians; for, however much we may\r\nsympathize with the real wrongs of Ireland, it was not for an American\r\nCongress to declare itself in favor of a movement which based itself on\r\nthe claim of every Irish voter in the country to a double citizenship,\r\nin which the adopted country was made secondary, and which, directed as\r\nit was against a province where Irishmen are put on equal terms with\r\nevery other inhabitant, and where their own Church is the privileged\r\none, was nothing better than burglary and murder. Whatever may be Mr.\r\nSeward's faults, he was certainly right in his dealing with that\r\nmatter, unless he is to be blamed for slowness. But as regards the\r\nterms offered by Congress to the South, they are very far from harsh or\r\nunreasonable; they are lamb-like compared to what we had reason to fear\r\nfrom Mr. Johnson, if we might judge by his speeches and declarations of\r\na year or two ago. But for the unhappy hallucination which led Mr.\r\nJohnson first to fancy himself the people of the United States, and\r\nthen to quarrel with the party which elected him for not granting that\r\nhe was so, they would not have found a man in the North to question\r\ntheir justice and propriety, unless among those who from the outset\r\nwould have been willing to accept Mr. Jefferson Davis as the legitimate\r\nPresident of the whole country. The terms imposed by Congress really\r\ndemand nothing more than that the South should put in practice at home\r\nthat Monroe Doctrine of which it has always been so clamorous a\r\nsupporter when it could be used for party purposes. The system of\r\nprivileged classes which the South proposes to establish is a relic of\r\nold Europe which we think it bad policy to introduce again on this\r\ncontinent, after our so fresh experience in the war of the evil\r\nconsequences that may spring from it. Aristocracy can form no more\r\nintimate and hearty union with democracy under one form than under\r\nanother; and unless such a union be accomplished, or we can see some\r\nreasonable hope of its future accomplishment, we are as far from our\r\nobject as ever.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed disfranchises no one, does not even interfere with\r\nthe right of the States to settle the conditions of the franchise. It\r\nmerely asks that the privilege shall be alike within reach of all,\r\nattainable on the same terms by those who have shown themselves our\r\nfriends as by those whose hands were so lately red with the blood of\r\nour nearest and dearest. We have nothing to do with the number of\r\nactual loyalists at the South, but with the number of possible ones.\r\nThe question is not how many now exist there, and what are their\r\nrights, but how many may be made to exist there, and by what means. The\r\nduty of the country to itself transcends all private claims or class\r\ninterests. And when people speak of \"the South,\" do they very clearly\r\ndefine to themselves what they mean by the words? Do they not really\r\nmean, without knowing it, the small body of dangerous men who have\r\nmisguided that part of the country to its own ruin, and almost to that\r\nof the Republic? In the mind of our government the South should have no\r\nsuch narrow meaning. It should see behind the conspirators of yesterday\r\nan innumerable throng of dusky faces, with their dumb appeal, not to\r\nits mercy, its generosity, or even its gratitude, but to its plighted\r\nfaith, to the solemn engagement of its chief magistrate and their\r\nmartyr. Any theory of the South which leaves out the negro is a scandal\r\nand reproach to our honesty; any attempt at another of those fatal\r\ncompromises which ignore his claims upon us, but cannot ignore his\r\nclaims upon nature and God and that inevitable future which we may hope\r\nto put far from us, but which is even now at our door, would be an\r\nimputation on our judgment, and an acknowledgment that we were unworthy\r\nto measure our strength with a great occasion when it met us face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWe are very far from joining in the unfeeling outcry which is sometimes\r\nraised by thoughtless persons against the Southern people, because they\r\ndecorate with flowers the graves of their dead soldiers, and cherish\r\nthe memory of those who fell in the defence of a cause which they could\r\nnot see to be already fallen before they entered its service. They have\r\nwon our respect, the people of Virginia especially, by their devotion\r\nand endurance in sustaining what they believed to be their righteous\r\nquarrel. They would rather deserve our reprobation, if they were\r\nwanting in these tributes to natural and human feeling. They are as\r\nharmless as the monument to the memory of those who fell for the\r\nPretender, which McDonald of Glenaladale raised after the last of the\r\nStuarts was in his grave. Let us sympathize with and respect all such\r\nexhibitions of natural feeling. But at the same time let us take care\r\nthat it shall not be at the risk of his life that the poor black shall\r\nfling his tribute on the turf of those who died, with equal sacrifice\r\nof self, in a better cause. Let us see to it that the Union men of the\r\nSouth shall be safe in declaring and advocating the reasons of their\r\nfaith in a cause which we believe to be sacred. Let us secure such\r\nopportunities of education to the masses of the Southern people,\r\nwhether white or black, as shall make any future rebellion\r\nimpracticable, and render it possible for the dead of both sides to\r\nsleep peaceably together under the safeguard of a common humanity,\r\nwhile the living dwell under the protection of a nationality which both\r\nshall value alike. Let us put it out of the power of a few ambitious\r\nmadmen to shake, though they could not endanger, the foundations of a\r\nstructure which enshrines the better hope of mankind. When Congress\r\nshall again come together, strong in the sympathy of a united people,\r\nlet them show a dignity equal to the importance of the crisis. Let them\r\ngive the President a proof of their patriotism, not only by allowing\r\nhim the opportunity, but by making it easy for him, to return to the\r\nnational position he once occupied. Let them not lower their own\r\ndignity and that of the nation by any bandying of reproaches with the\r\nExecutive. The cause which we all have at heart is vulgarized by any\r\nlittleness or show of personal resentment in its representatives, and\r\nis of too serious import to admit of any childishness or trifling. Let\r\nthere be no more foolish talk of impeachment for what is at best a poor\r\ninfirmity of nature, and could only be raised into a harmful importance\r\nby being invested with the dignity of a crime against the state.\r\nNothing could be more unwise than to entangle in legal quibbles a cause\r\nso strong in its moral grounds, so transparent in its equity, and so\r\nplain to the humblest apprehension in its political justice and\r\nnecessity. We have already one criminal half turned martyr at Fortress\r\nMonroe; we should be in no hurry to make another out of even more\r\nvulgar material,--for unhappily martyrs are not Mercuries. We have only\r\nto be unswervingly faithful to what is the true America of our hope and\r\nbelief, and whatever is American will rise from one end of the country\r\nto the other instinctively to our side, with more than ample means of\r\npresent succor and of final triumph. It is only by being loyal and\r\nhelpful to Truth that men learn at last how loyal and helpful she can\r\nbe to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVERSIDE PRESS\r\n\r\nElectrotyped and printed by H. O.
