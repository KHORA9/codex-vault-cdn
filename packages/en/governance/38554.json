It has\r\nbeen our constant effort to condense into as small a compass as possible\r\nour views relative to the cause of our nation's calamity, and the proper\r\ncourse to be pursued to restore the supremacy of the laws, the integrity\r\nof the constitution, and to preserve the Union. We have aimed at nothing\r\nbut the good of our distracted country. That some will differ with us\r\nrelative to our proposed plan of managing our national affairs in this\r\nhour of peril, is no more than we expect. We are aware that there are\r\ntrue-hearted and well-meaning men who are of the opinion that we had\r\nbetter compromise with the traitors to our country than to use forcible\r\nmeans to compel obedience to the laws. But we think they are seriously\r\nmistaken; that such a measure will but produce a temporary calm that will\r\nbe succeeded by a storm of increased violence. We have labored in the\r\nfirst place to show that our present troubles are owing to a mistaken\r\npolicy on the part of our government in adopting temporary pacification\r\nmeasures, instead of maintaining the supremacy of the laws. We have also\r\nendeavored to show from letters written by some of the founders of our\r\ngovernment, that this is a government of the people collectly, and not a\r\ngovernment of the States. We have further endeavored to show that the\r\nwisest of our statesmen were in favor of enforcing the laws regardless of\r\nthe feelings of those who rebelled against them; and finally, we trust,\r\nthat we have shown that a Republican government cannot be maintained\r\nunless the people of every section of the country are compelled to submit\r\nto the constitutional acts of the majority. We wish our Southern brethren\r\nno harm, but they _must_ learn that this is a government composed of\r\nfreemen who will submit to their dictation no longer; and the sooner they\r\nare apprized of this fact the better it will be for all parties concerned.\r\nThe necessity for a work of this kind has caused us to lay aside most\r\npressing business matters which needed our attention; but in these\r\nperilous times we feel it our duty to do all we can to unite the people\r\nupon this momentous crisis in our national affairs. The hurried manner in\r\nwhich this work has been prepared, will account for the imperfections.\r\n\r\nA. D. STREIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS.\r\n\r\nWHAT PRODUCED IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we behold a blooming youth, just entering upon the sphere of manhood,\r\nthe fondest hopes of his honored parents, the admiration of all who know\r\nhim, the brightest genious of his age, begin to wither and decay, our\r\nsinking spirits are aroused to make deep, anxious, earnest enquiry as to\r\nthe nature and cause of the disease that threatens to drag him to an\r\nuntimely grave, and bring misery, sorrow and pain to his unhappy parents,\r\nfriends and admirers, and if there is to be found a remedy within the\r\nknowledge of man that will remove the malady, we are wont to apply it with\r\nthe utmost promptitude, and await its effects with fearful apprehensions\r\nand the deepest suspense. No time is lost or exertion spared by the\r\nfriends of the afflicted, but with a united effort they rally, each\r\nanxious to contribute the utmost of his ability to rescue the unfortunate\r\nsufferer from the dangers that threaten to rob them of one to whom they\r\nfeel bound by every endearing tie that binds mankind to earth. Now, while\r\na case like this should justly excite our sympathies and awaken every\r\nprinciple of humanity dwelling in the heart, yet how unimportant and\r\ninsignificant is such a case, when compared with the decaying symptoms of\r\na great, free, powerful and prosperous nation of over thirty millions of\r\ninhabitants, whose institutions have been the hope and pride of the\r\nfriends of liberty, whose prosperity is the marvel of the world, whose\r\ncommerce extends to the most remote portions of the earth, whose territory\r\ncovers twenty-three degrees of latitude and sixty degrees of longitude,\r\nwhose soil is unsurpassed for the variety and richness of its\r\nproductions, whose government has been the shield and asylum for the\r\noppressed of all nations, and whose prosperity and power has been the\r\nobject of jealousy and dread of the tyrants of every division of the\r\nglobe. Yes, America has been, since the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the stumbling block of tyrany, the good samaritan to the poor and\r\nunfortunate of the civilized portions of the earth, her unexampled\r\nprogress the astonishment and admiration of every lover of liberty and\r\nfriend of humanity, the framers of her institutions are honored as the\r\nnoblest statesmen of any age, for their patriotism, purity and wisdom. And\r\nyet, strange as it may seem, this model government, this land of the free\r\nand home of the brave, presenting an aggregate of individual and national\r\nwealth, happiness and prosperity unequalled by the same numbers on the\r\nface of the earth, although in the first century of its gigantic infancy,\r\nit is now trembling with all the convulsive symptoms of revolution and\r\ncivil commotion, which threatens to undermine the very basis of our\r\ninstitutions and our liberties. Nay, the threatening storm is now\r\nproducing a tumultuous sensation that is rocking the temple of liberty\r\nfrom top to bottom, and from center to circumference.\r\n\r\nSuch being the sad picture of the true condition of our country, we will\r\nproceed to make earnest enquiry as to the cause of the existing evils and\r\nfrom whence they come; for it is a well known principle in politics, as\r\nwell as every other science, that in order to apply the rightful remedy\r\nfor an existing evil, it is of the utmost importance that the nature and\r\nsource of the evil should be carefully studied, and thoroughly understood\r\nby those having the case in charge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the threatening aspect of our national affairs have called forth\r\nthe opinions of some of our most able statesmen, relative to the causes of\r\nour present troubles, yet, with due deference to their talents, sagacity\r\nand wisdom, we feel constrained to say, that, in our opinion, they have\r\nentirely overlooked, or omitted to mention, one of the chief causes that\r\nhave rendered the people of the Southern States so turbulant, defiant,\r\nand, at last, nearly ungovernable.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to give a brief statement of what we believe to be\r\nthe source from whence most, if not all, our present difficulties can be\r\ntraced, and by so doing we trust the means for restoring peace to the\r\ncountry will be more easily and unanimously decided upon.\r\n\r\nIn searching the political history of our country, it appears that in 1819\r\nand '20, Congress objected to the further extension of slavery; (which, of\r\ncourse, it had a perfect right to do,) consequently Missouri was rejected\r\nwhen she applied for admission, because of her constitution recognizing\r\nthat institution. At this the South became very indignant, and her\r\nstatesmen predicted a speeded dissolution of the Union, unless Missouri\r\nwas admitted. The result was a compromise in which the South obtained all\r\nshe demanded, and then we learn nothing of her revolting spirit until the\r\ncelebrated tariff difficulty came up, which called out General Jackson's\r\nproclamation, in 1832; and although that old hero stood his ground firmly\r\nand did his whole duty nobly, yet there were those who were fearful that\r\nSouth Carolina would injure herself, like the spoiled boy, who throws\r\nhimself on the floor, and in the midst of his rage, proceeds to bruise his\r\nhead against articles of a more substantial character, consequently there\r\nwas a compromise effected to appease her wrath. Again, when we were about\r\nappropriating money to pay Mexico for territory obtained from her, David\r\nWilmot offered a proviso, that inasmuch as slavery did not exist in that\r\nterritory at the time it came into our possession, it should not exist\r\nthere thereafter. A very wise proviso, and a vast majority of the people\r\nof the country were in favor of it, but then it did not suit the South,\r\nconsequently, her statesmen predicted an immediate dissolution of the\r\nUnion, if Mr. Wilmot's proviso should become a law, and, of course, most\r\nof us loved the Union, hence we threw Mr. Wilmot's proviso overboard. But\r\nshortly after that, California made application to come into the Union as\r\na free State. This was very obnoxious to our Southern brethren,\r\nconsequently, they would dissolve the Union, unless there was some\r\nconcessions made. Every body was at a loss to know what the nature of the\r\nconcession could be, for the government had already signed several blanks\r\nfor the South to fill out to their own liking, and it was supposed, that\r\nin their wisdom, they had secured, at least, what belonged to them; but\r\nthen the country was declared to be in imminent danger of a speedy\r\ndissolution, unless there could be a compromise effected with the South.\r\nAll hands were set at work to ascertain whether there was anything which\r\nthe government had not already granted them, and after diligent search it\r\nwas found that there was occasionally a fugitive slave escaping from\r\nsouthern bondage, and as the people in some pertions of the country were\r\nnot much inclined to extend any great amount of sympathy to those who were\r\nwont to pursue said fugitives, the South finally concluded to make this\r\nproposition: That in case the government would compel every northern man\r\nto aid in catching and returning the fugitive slaves at his own cost and\r\nexpense, then they, the South, would allow California to be admitted as a\r\nfree State, and suffer the Union to remain undivided. Most of us remember\r\nwell when this ultimatum was presented to us. We generally disliked the\r\nidea of being called blood hounds and negro catchers, by the civilized\r\nnations of the earth, saying nothing about the expense or our feelings\r\nattending this unpleasant operation, but then we loved our country, and\r\ncould not think of its destruction without feelings of sadness, and when\r\nthe fire-eating gentry would show their teeth, brandish their bowie knives\r\nand draw their revolvers, expressing their readiness, willingness, and\r\nfinal determination to shoot down, cut and carve, and smash things\r\ngenerally, provided we did not consent to catch Sambo; life being sweet to\r\nus, and peace being desirable, we finally concluded to save our country,\r\neven if we were compelled to chase Sambo to do it. And here again we\r\ncompromised upon the basis of what was called the Fugitive Slave Law of\r\n1850. We do not claim any great show of bravery or firmness in this case,\r\nbut then if self degradation and humiliation to save our country is a mark\r\nof patriotism, we would be sorry to hear of a more patriotic people than\r\nwe of the north proved ourselves to be in this transaction.\r\n\r\nPeace being again declared to exist, things seemed to move quietly along\r\nuntil the winters of 1853-'54, when, to everybody's surprise, (I mean in\r\nthe North,) one Stephen A. Douglas, desiring to become President of the\r\nUnited States, set himself at work to find out whether there was not\r\nsomething more which the South might have granted her to enhance her\r\ninterests. Stephen, being a man of great industry and perseverance,\r\nsearched carefully and thoroughly, and at last he found a restriction on\r\nthe extension of the institution of slavery north of thirty-six degrees\r\nand thirty minutes north latitude. With great earnestness, and a show of\r\nfairness, he entered into the task of removing this restriction. He was\r\nsoon made acquainted with the fact that this restriction was but a part of\r\na solemn compact, and that the party for whose benefit the restriction was\r\nestablished, had paid for it a large price, and a disinheritance at this\r\ntime would be gross injustice toward the party aggrieved.\r\n\r\nEven some of the Southern Senators labored hard to dissuade Stephen from\r\nhis purpose, on this account, but then Stephen was desirous of becoming\r\nPresident, and not being excessively burthened with a high sense of\r\njustice, he was inexorable in his undertaking, and pressed it with vigor\r\nand energy. Southern statesmen espoused the cause with their usual\r\nunanimity, and again declared that unless the restriction was removed this\r\nUnion would be dissolved. All will remember how reluctant the people of\r\nthe free States were to grant this demand; but, as in former times, we\r\nloved our country, and when its very existence was threatened we were\r\ndesirous of avoiding the great calamity; hence, the restriction was\r\nremoved, and the famous Kansas and Nebraska Act became a law.\r\n\r\nAlthough the South had thus far been successful in obtaining whatever they\r\ndemanded, nevertheless, the defiant course they had pursued, the\r\nincreasing frequency, and the nature of the demands, together with their\r\nrefusal to be governed by a compromise, even after dictating the terms of\r\nit themselves, began to open the eyes of some of our Northern\r\nstatesmen--hence, the Republican party sprang into existence in 1854 with\r\nthe avowed intention of resisting through the ballot-box each and every\r\nencroachment from our Southern brethren thereafter. This was declared by\r\nthe South to be very dangerous to the Union, and in 1856, when the\r\nRepublicans run a candidate in the person of John C. Fremont for the\r\nPresidency, the South declared that to be a great insult to her dignity,\r\nand a just cause for a dissolution of the Union. She blustered and\r\nthreatened to such an extent that they succeeded in frightening the people\r\nof some of the free States into the support of James Buchanan, which,\r\ntogether with her united vote, she succeeded in carrying the election, and\r\nMr. Buchanan became President. It soon became evident that the South were\r\nnot any way inclined to abandon their aggressive policy. The attempt to\r\nsubjugate the people of Kansas by forcing slavery upon them, against the\r\nwell known wish of three-fourths of the inhabitants, was sufficient to\r\nwake up still another class of the people of the free States, which caused\r\nlarge accessions to the Republican party, and a complete division of the\r\nDemocratic party. Finally, the Democrats met at Charleston on the 23d day\r\nof April, 1860, to nominate candidates for President and Vice-President.\r\nProtection for slave property in the territories was demanded by the\r\nSouth--it was rejected--the convention split and adjourned. The South\r\nnominated a separate candidate upon the slave protection platform, and\r\nagain resorted to her old tune of declaring the Union in danger; but the\r\npeople had become disgusted with this kind of electioneering, and most\r\nemphatically refused to be bullied into the support of that dogma;\r\nconsequently they cast their votes for Abraham Lincoln, and elected him,\r\nwhich is now declared by the South to be sufficient cause for dissolving\r\nthe Union. But some of the more moderate of the Southerners are willing to\r\nsuffer a portion of the Union to remain undivided, provided the North will\r\nconsent to amend the Constitution so as to legalize slavery as a national\r\ninstitution. This is a very moderate request indeed; but, fellow\r\ncountrymen, _are you ready to grant it_?\r\n\r\nWe have thus sketched a brief history of what we believe to be the true\r\ncause of the present crisis. And why is it the cause? The answer is plain\r\nto everyone--the South have been in the habit of controlling the policy of\r\nthe government, by argument, if they could, but by threats of violence if\r\nthey failed with the first. They have been successful in so many schemes\r\nof this kind, that they began to look upon that condition of things as\r\nco-existent with our government. Now we shall not contend that our\r\nSouthern brethren are any more turbulent and ungovernable than the same\r\nnumber of Northern men would be, if they had been similarly dealt with.\r\nHad the government of the United States, instead of compromising with the\r\nSouth when threats were made, pursued a straightforward course regardless\r\nof the threats, or those who made them, and in case there had been\r\nforcible resistance to the laws, called out sufficient force to suppress\r\nthe rebellion, then the people of the South would have learned one\r\nimportant lesson in earlier times.\r\n\r\nThis would have saved both them and the government much trouble and\r\nexpense, but since they have not learned this lesson before, they should\r\nlearn it now; and though they may be somewhat like an overgrown,\r\nhigh-spirited colt, that has never been harnessed, yet, with patience,\r\nkindness and _firmness_, we trust they will still learn the lesson without\r\nvery seriously injuring either themselves or others. Should this not be\r\nthe case, if they are determined to resist all legal restraint, can there\r\nbe any advantage in further delaying the use of force? Can any one pretend\r\nthat further concession would help the case permanently? There is no use\r\nof dodging the question. All must admit that the great cause of our\r\npresent troubles is owing to an unwillingness of the South to submit to\r\nany terms except such as they may dictate. And some of them have even gone\r\nso far as to say that even though they are allowed this privilege, they\r\nwould not abandon their treasonable designs. Verily we believe that Uncle\r\nSam has spoiled some of his boys by over indulgence. We will endeavor to\r\nshow this to be the case, by showing that, where resistance to the laws\r\nhas been met by force, instead of concession, the people are more\r\nlaw-abiding citizens, at least we hear of no threats from that source of\r\noverthrowing the government, unless certain measures are adopted. It is a\r\nnoticeable fact that, during our national existence, there has never been\r\nany concession, on the part of the government of the United States,\r\ngranted to any portion of the north, where there has been resistance to\r\nthe laws; but the strong arm of the government has been used to put down\r\nsuch resistance whenever it became necessary. The great rebellion of 1785,\r\ncalled Shay's Rebellion, was met with force, and the leaders punished. The\r\ngreat Whisky Rebellion, as it is called, was suppressed with an armed\r\nforce 15,000 strong in 1794. General Washington was then president,\r\nshowing that he recognised the principle of suppressing insurrection by\r\nforce, if necessary to do so, in order to maintain the supremacy of the\r\nlaw. Again, we find the United States using force to carry out the\r\nfugitive slave law in the Burns case, and, in fact, several others. The\r\nKansas troubles were met with force, not compromise. All these cases have\r\noccurred in the north, and have been promptly met by the government, which\r\nhas had a tendency to teach the people of that section of the country\r\nthat, to resist the laws, is sure to incur the legal penalty. Remonstrance\r\nhas been of no avail--the laws were pointed to as the guide. This was the\r\ncase particularly in the Kansas troubles, when the laws of the notorious\r\nbogus legislature were being forced upon the people by the government\r\nbayonets. Mr. Buchanan was then implored to desist, and allow the people\r\nto re-construct the laws of the territory. They were told that, although\r\nthe laws were oppressive, yet so long as they remained on the statute\r\nbooks of the territory, they were the laws of that country, and must be\r\nenforced. This has uniformly been the course of the government toward the\r\npeople of the north. We do not complain of this, but simply refer to it to\r\nshow that, while the people of the north have been taught to obey the\r\nlaws, or suffer the penalty of their violation, the people of the south\r\nhave been allowed to control the policy of the government by threats and\r\nviolence, and as might have been expected, they have at last become\r\nentirely insufferable. They will no longer be satisfied with anything in\r\nreason or out of reason. They will neither be peaceable, nor allow others\r\nto live in peace. Their demands have become more frequent and of a more\r\nstartling character--and why is this? It is because they have never been\r\nmade sensible of the fact that the government of the United States is\r\ncapable of enforcing its laws in that portion of the country as well as in\r\nany other.\r\n\r\nHow absurd it is, then, at this time, for us to offer them another\r\ncompromise--it would be like adding new fuel to the fire, it might\r\nsuppress the flame momentarily, but when it bursts forth again it would be\r\nwith increased vigor and violence. We should not compromise in the least\r\nif we desire permanent peace, but administer the laws with firmness and\r\njustice; and although it may take the force of arms to do so, yet a\r\nrivulet of blood, spilt at this time, will prevent rivers of it in the\r\nfuture. Let us not entail the evil effects of failing to perform our duty\r\nupon our children, but sternly perform our whole duty, and transmit to the\r\nnext generation the good old ship of State in a sound and navigable\r\ncondition; and if there be mutineers who persist in her destruction let us\r\nwarn them manfully of the dangers they are incurring upon themselves, and\r\nas a last resort, rather than give up the ship, let us arrest their\r\nprogress by force.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have given at length what we believe to be the great primary\r\ncause of our present crisis, yet there are other more immediate causes,\r\namong which is the course that the Northern press have pursued since this\r\nsecession movement has assumed a more positive form. Many of the leading\r\npapers have advocated the policy of allowing such States to secede as\r\nchoose to do so. And others have been loud with their demands for\r\nconcession and compromise upon any basis that would satisfy the traitors\r\nand restore peace. While still another class have battled manfully for the\r\nsupremacy of the laws. This division of what is taken for the public\r\nsentiment, has been a source of consolation and encouragement to the\r\ntraitors, while the government of the United States has stood silent with\r\nfolded arms and allowed itself to be robbed of millions of dollars worth\r\nof property without raising a hand or uttering a solitary protest against\r\nthe theft. What more encouragement could those who have been engaged in\r\nthis treasonable scheme have asked for or desired? They have been told by\r\na portion of the Democratic press that they were perfectly justifiable in\r\ndissolving the Union; and by a portion of the Republican press, that\r\nalthough they were by no means justifiable in committing such an\r\noutrageous act, yet, if they were really in earnest, and were determined\r\nto do so or fight, then they could go ahead, for there would be no\r\nfighting to maintain a Union with such unruly neighbors. Such seems to\r\nhave been the reckless and ill-timed course on the part of the press at\r\nthis present juncture, that it has encouraged the traitors by,\r\nrepresenting the friends of the Union as divided into fragments, thus\r\nremoving all opposition to their reckless course. Had the press of the\r\nNorth presented an unbroken front in favor of the Union, and a\r\ndetermination to stand by it regardless of threats or even of violence, we\r\nhave every reason to believe that the South would have hesitated and\r\nconsidered the nature of the calamity they were bringing upon themselves\r\nand their country. That the spirit of compromise heretofore exercised on\r\nthe part of our government toward those who have threatened violence, is\r\nthe great source of our political troubles, can hardly admit of a\r\ndoubt--why should we pursue the policy still further that has brought us\r\nto the very verge of ruin? Since it is our wavering, compromising, and\r\nundecided course that has brought our country to ruin, let us proceed to\r\nadopt a more firm and decided course. Give the South all that is their\r\nright, and boldly refuse to submit to any dictation beyond our\r\nconstitutional duty. This is not the time to amend constitutions nor to\r\nchange public opinion, but let every man rally to the support of his\r\ncountry, and when peace is restored and traitors have laid down their arms\r\nand signified a willingness to submit to the laws, we will have more\r\nleisure to investigate the nature of the proposed constitutional\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS,\r\n\r\nAND HOW TO MEET IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the government of nations there are, sometimes, crises of the most\r\nmomentous importance. They either promote stability or terminate in ruin.\r\nThe result depends upon the virtue and patriotism of the mass of the\r\npeople, and the wisdom, prudence and unflinching firmness of their rulers\r\nand statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America are in the midst of just such a crisis at\r\npresent, and nothing is more important than correct views with regard to\r\nthat crisis on the part of the people. To aid in the dissemination of such\r\nviews, in order to produce unity of action among all classes of the people\r\nis the object of this publication, in which we shall ignore mere\r\npartisanship and take large and patriotic and comprehensive views of the\r\ngenius and principles of our government.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest questions for the consideration of the people of this\r\nnation, and for their enlightened solution, has just arisen, that has ever\r\nbeen presented for an answer since the formation of our republican\r\ngovernment. It is this: Has any State in the Union a right, under the\r\npresent Constitution, peaceably to withdraw itself from that Union, for\r\nthe purpose of setting up a separate, distinct, and, necessarily,\r\nconflicting nationality?\r\n\r\nVery important is it that this question should be correctly answered in\r\nthe present juncture, and that the people should be fully prepared to act\r\nunderstandingly. Vast and immeasurable results depend upon it.\r\n\r\nIf this vital question could be answered in the affirmative, as some seem\r\nto think, then would the federal compact, by which these States are held\r\ntogether, be a mere rope of sand, without strength or tenacity, subject to\r\nbe ruptured by the slightest discord. Such a solution of the question, if\r\nacted upon _practically_, would carry us back to the old confederation, by\r\nthe articles of which these States were connected in their associated\r\ncapacity previous to the adoption of the present constitution. And what\r\nwas that confederation? Merely a league of States, in which each\r\nindividual member of that league was at liberty to act in her sovereign\r\ncapacity, without any binding restrictions. Each individual member of that\r\nconfederation could levy taxes, raise revenue, make alliances, declare\r\nwar, make peace, and do whatever else she chose without consultation with\r\nthe rest of the members, and without being held amenable for her action,\r\nexcept just so far as the general law of nations held her amenable. From\r\nthat confederation she could at any time withdraw or secede, without being\r\nrebellious or traitorous to the other members.\r\n\r\nExperience proved to the satisfaction of the wise, patriotic and far\r\nseeing fathers of the republic, that such a confederation was entirely\r\nineffectual for the accomplishment of the great purposes for which it was\r\nformed. It possessed not the concentrated power of binding and\r\nirrepealable unity to protect the common flag of a common Union. It could\r\nnot, therefore, command the respect and the honor of other nations, nor\r\npromote its own stability and permanence.\r\n\r\nIs the present Union similar to that? Can a South Carolina, or a\r\nMassachusetts, or any other disaffected State withdraw or secede at will,\r\nas she could from the Old Confederation, and set up, if she choose, an\r\nindependent nationality? No such thing. The present compact and\r\nconstitution grew out of the absolute necessities consequent upon the\r\ninefficiency of the old confederation. They were established solely to\r\nprevent or obviate that inefficiency, and provide a common flag and a\r\ncommon government capable of commanding respect. An examination of the\r\npresent Constitution will show that fact. We will, therefore, present\r\nthose provisions of that instrument which have a direct bearing upon the\r\ndecision of this question, and then show by the record how the fathers of\r\nthat Constitution understood its powers, and how that understanding has\r\nbeen confirmed by all the precedents in the history of the government to\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nThe very preamble of the Constitution itself shows that it was formed for\r\nthe purpose of establishing a government stronger and more efficient than\r\nthe old confederation. It is in these words:\r\n\r\n    \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\n    union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the\r\n    common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\n    of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish\r\n    this Constitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other things, this preamble declares that the present constitution\r\nwas \"ordained and established\" \"in order to form _a union more perfect_\"\r\nthan existed under the provisions of the old confederation--a union that\r\ncould not be dissolved at the pleasure or choice of any State or any\r\nnumber of States without the consent of three-fourths of the sovereign\r\npeople. It conceded to a general government certain powers and rights,\r\nwhich were, of course, subtracted from the powers and rights of the\r\nseparate State sovereignties, and these powers and rights were vested\r\nsolely in the hands of a President, \"a Congress of the United States,\" and\r\na Supreme Court created and elected according to the provisions of that\r\nconstitution. And now, to understand this matter, what were those\r\nparticular powers and rights which were thus abstracted from the separate\r\nState sovereignties and vested in a general government? They are very\r\nemphatically, clearly and forcibly declared in article I, section 8, of\r\nthe constitution of the United States. They are thus expressed:\r\n\r\n    \"The Congress shall have power--\r\n\r\n    \"1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, excises; to pay the\r\n    debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the\r\n    United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform\r\n    throughout the United States;\r\n\r\n    \"2. To borrow money on the credit of the United States;\r\n\r\n    \"3. To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several\r\n    States, and with the Indian tribes;\r\n\r\n    \"4. To establish an uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws\r\n    on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States;\r\n\r\n    \"5. To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,\r\n    and fix the standard of weights and measures;\r\n\r\n    \"6. To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and\r\n    current coin of the United States;\r\n\r\n    \"7. To establish post offices and post roads;\r\n\r\n    \"8. To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing\r\n    for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to\r\n    their respective writings and discoveries;\r\n\r\n    \"9. To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; to define\r\n    and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and\r\n    offences against the law of nations;\r\n\r\n    \"10. To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make\r\n    rules concerning captures on land and water;\r\n\r\n    \"11. To raise and support armies; but no appropriations of money to\r\n    that use, shall be for a longer term than two years;\r\n\r\n    \"12. To provide and maintain a navy;\r\n\r\n    \"13. To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and\r\n    naval forces;\r\n\r\n    \"14. To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of\r\n    the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions;\r\n\r\n    \"15. To provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia,\r\n    and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service\r\n    of the United States, reserving to the States, respectively, the\r\n    appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia,\r\n    according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\r\n\r\n    \"16. To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over\r\n    such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of\r\n    particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of\r\n    government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over\r\n    all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in\r\n    which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines,\r\n    arsenals, dock yards and other needful buildings:--And\r\n\r\n    \"17. To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\n    into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by\r\n    this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any\r\n    department or officer thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe powers enumerated in this section are very definite, and nothing we\r\ncould say would make that fact appear more apparent. Now if these powers\r\nare conferred upon the general government by the common consent of all the\r\nStates of the Union, or more especially by all the people of all the\r\nStates, can any one State exercise any of those reserved powers? Most\r\ncertainly not. But the framers of the constitution did not leave this to\r\nbe inferred. They settled the question definitely in section ten. Here it\r\nis:\r\n\r\n    \"1. No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\r\n    grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of\r\n    credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of\r\n    debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing\r\n    the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.\r\n\r\n    \"2. No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any\r\n    imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what maybe absolutely\r\n    necessary for executing its inspection laws; and the nett produce of\r\n    all duties and imposts, laid by any State on imports or exports, shall\r\n    be for the use of the treasury of the United States, and all such laws\r\n    shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress. No State\r\n    shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tunnage, keep\r\n    troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or\r\n    compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war,\r\n    unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit\r\n    of delay.\"\r\n\r\nThis section plainly and positively _prohibits_ the States from doing\r\ncertain things _without the consent_ of Congress. They can neither\r\ncontract alliances, collect revenue, coin money, nor engage in war in\r\ntheir capacity of States.\r\n\r\nTo guard the powers of the general government from encroachment on the\r\npart of the States, and to preserve them intact and unimpaired, the\r\nPresident of the United States, as the chief Executive officer of the\r\ngovernment, takes this oath:\r\n\r\n    \"I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR (or affirm) THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE\r\n    OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WILL, TO THE BEST OF MY\r\n    ABILITY, PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED\r\n    STATES.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus far enumerated some of the _powers_ delegated by the\r\nConstitution _to the_ federal government in the precise language of that\r\nconstitution, and have shown that the chief executive of the government is\r\nsworn to exercise those powers by enforcing the constitution, and, of\r\ncourse, the laws, &c., which are made under its sanction and by its\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThis constitution was adopted by a vast majority of the people of every\r\nState in the Union--adopted too with the understanding that it was\r\n_perpetually_ binding--adopted _without any proviso for withdrawal or\r\nsecession_ in case of dissatisfaction--adopted when it was known that,\r\neven to amend it, either two-thirds of both houses of Congress must\r\n\"propose amendments, or two-thirds of all the State Legislatures unite in\r\nan application to call a convention of States for proposing amendments,\"\r\nand that, when such amendments were proposed, they must \"_be ratified_\" by\r\n\"the legislatures of _three-fourths_ of all the States, or by conventions\r\nin _three-fourths_ thereof.\" This shows clearly and conclusively that our\r\nfathers considered that they were establishing a government\r\nindissoluble--a government for all time, incapable of disruption by\r\nseparate State action or by the violence of local faction.\r\n\r\nIn the strong light of these facts how are we to regard the present\r\nattitude of South Carolina? As treasonable and rebellious to rightful\r\nauthority, which she herself assisted to establish. She has no right\r\nwhatever, under the existing compact, to withdraw herself from the Union,\r\nor to annul that compact into which she voluntarily entered, when she\r\nadopted that constitution. By that adoption she forever signed away such a\r\nright--voluntarily she sets her signature to a compact having no such\r\nproviso of choice. If she secede then--if she break, or attempt to break,\r\nthat compact, she engages in a revolution, and revolution is\r\nrebellion--revolution is _treason_. Of that capital crime she, or rather\r\nher citizens, are even now guilty. \"What constitutes treason? The\r\nconstitution defines it in Article 3, Section III:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying\r\n    war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and\r\n    comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the\r\n    testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in\r\n    open court.\r\n\r\n    \"2. The congress shall have power to declare the punishment of\r\n    treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood,\r\n    or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.\"\r\n\r\nNow has not South Carolina \"levied war?\" Has she not collected armies to\r\nresist the United States? Has she not obstructed the collection of the\r\nrevenue of the nation? Has she not even taken the fortifications and\r\narsenals and confiscated the property of the United States? All these\r\nthings has she done, and if this be not \"levying war\"--if this be not\r\n\"treason\"--rank \"treason,\" I know not what is. And yet, strange as it may\r\nseem, there are men in all the States so wedded to party that they\r\nencourage and justify South Carolina in her mad secession schemes, and by\r\nso doing give \"aid and comfort\" to the sworn \"enemies\" of the United\r\nStates. Did they ever think that they too are traitors, and that they are\r\nas legally deserving of a halter as the madest secession hotspur of South\r\nCarolina?\r\n\r\nLike the old tories of the revolution, they are, however, but few in the\r\nNorthern States, and their number, thanks to the intelligence of the\r\npeople, is rapidly growing less. Soon will there be but one sentiment in\r\nall sane minds upon this subject. All will see that this Union must be\r\npreserved, unbroken by rebels, and traitors be brought to condign\r\npunishment, unless we would insanely jeopardise all for which our fathers\r\nfought and bled and died upon the battle fields of the revolution.\r\n\r\nTo aid in creating a healthy public sentiment upon this important subject,\r\nI will now give some of the arguments in favor of the Union and of the\r\npresent constitution, advanced by some of the early fathers of the\r\nrepublic. To do this, I shall first draw largely from certain political\r\npapers, entitled the \"Federalist,\" written while the adoption of the\r\npresent constitution was pending, and addressed to the people of the State\r\nof New York, to explain the principles of the new constitution, and to\r\nenforce the propriety and necessity of its adoption. They were the united\r\nproductions of John Jay, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, three\r\nbrilliant political lights.\r\n\r\nIn the first eight numbers of these papers the dangers of foreign force\r\nand influence, and of war between the States, and the effects of internal\r\nwar in producing standing armies unfriendly to liberty, were portrayed in\r\na very masterly manner. Several other papers follow from which I quote\r\nlargely, as they are just as appropriate now to show the benefits of a\r\nstable and consolidated Union, and the evils of _disunion_, as then:\r\n\r\n    \"THE UTILITY OF THE UNION AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST DOMESTIC FACTION AND\r\n    INSURRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n    \"A firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of\r\n    the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection.\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece\r\n    and Italy, without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the\r\n    distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the\r\n    rapid succession of revolutions, by which they were kept perpetually\r\n    vibrating between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit\r\n    occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrasts to the\r\n    furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of\r\n    felicity open themselves to view, we behold them with a mixture of\r\n    regret arising from the reflection, that the pleasing scenes before us\r\n    are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and\r\n    party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom,\r\n    while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at\r\n    the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government\r\n    should pervert the direction and tarnish the luster of those bright\r\n    talents and exalted endowments, for which the favored soils that\r\n    produced them have been so justly celebrated.\r\n\r\n    \"From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics, the\r\n    advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the\r\n    forms of republican government but against the very principles of\r\n    civil liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent\r\n    with the order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious\r\n    exultation over its friends and partizans. Happily for mankind,\r\n    stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which have\r\n    flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted their\r\n    gloomy sophisms. And, I trust, America will be the broad and solid\r\n    foundation of other edifices not less magnificent, which will be\r\n    equally permanent monuments of their error.\r\n\r\n    \"But it is not to be denied, that the portraits they have sketched of\r\n    republican government, were too just copies of the originals from\r\n    which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have\r\n    devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends of\r\n    liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species\r\n    of government as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like\r\n    most other sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of\r\n    various principles is now well understood, which were either not known\r\n    at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution\r\n    of power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative\r\n    balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges,\r\n    holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the\r\n    people in the legislature, by deputies of their own election; these\r\n    are either wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal\r\n    progress towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and\r\n    powerful means, by which the excellencies of republican government may\r\n    be retained, and its imperfections lessoned or avoided. To this\r\n    catalogue of circumstances, that tend to the amelioration of popular\r\n    systems of civil government, I shall venture, however novel it may\r\n    appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which has been made\r\n    the foundation of an objection to the new constitution; I mean the\r\n    ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve,\r\n    either in respect to the dimensions of a single State, or to the\r\n    consolidation of several smaller States into one great confederacy.\r\n    The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under\r\n    consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine the principle in\r\n    its application to a single State, which shall be attended to in\r\n    another place.\r\n\r\n    \"The utility of a confederacy, as well to suppress faction, and to\r\n    guard the internal tranquility of States, as to increase their\r\n    external force and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been\r\n    practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the\r\n    sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics. The\r\n    opponents of the PLAN proposed have with great assiduity cited and\r\n    circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a\r\n    contracted territory for a republican government. But they seem not to\r\n    have been apprized of the sentiments of that great man expressed in\r\n    another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of\r\n    the principle to which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence.\r\n\r\n    \"When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the\r\n    standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of\r\n    almost every one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts,\r\n    Pennsylvania, New York, N. Carolina, nor Georgia, can by any means be\r\n    compared with the models from which he reasoned, and to which the\r\n    terms of his description apply. If we therefore receive his ideas on\r\n    this point, as the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the\r\n    alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy,\r\n    or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little, jealous,\r\n    clashing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched nurseries of\r\n    unceasing discord, and the miserable objects of universal pity or\r\n    contempt. Some of the writers who have come forward on the other side\r\n    of the question, seem to have been aware of the dilemma, and have even\r\n    been bold enough to hint at the division of the larger States as a\r\n    desirable thing. Such an infatuated policy, such a desperate\r\n    expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the\r\n    views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence\r\n    beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue; but it could never\r\n    promote the greatness or happiness of the people of America.\r\n\r\n    \"Referring the examination of the principle itself to an other place,\r\n    as has been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here,\r\n    that in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted\r\n    upon the occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of\r\n    the more considerable MEMBERS of the Union; but would not militate\r\n    against their being all comprehended in one confederate government.\r\n    And this is the true question, in the discussion of which we are at\r\n    present interested.\r\n\r\n    \"So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition\r\n    to a general union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a\r\n    CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC, as the expedient for extending the sphere of\r\n    popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with\r\n    those of republicanism.\r\n\r\n    \"'It is very probable, says he,[1] that mankind would have been\r\n    obliged, at length, to live constantly under the government of a\r\n    SINGLE PERSON, had they not contrived a kind of constitution, that has\r\n    all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the\r\n    external force of a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE\r\n    REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n    \"'This form of government is a convention, by which several smaller\r\n    _States_ agree to become members of a larger _one_, which they intend\r\n    to form. It is a kind of assemblage of societies, that constitute a\r\n    new one, capable of increasing by means of new associations, till they\r\n    arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the\r\n    security of the united body.\r\n\r\n    \"'A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may\r\n    support itself without any internal corruption. The form of this\r\n    society prevents all manner of inconveniences.\r\n\r\n    \"'If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he\r\n    could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the\r\n    confederate States. Were he to have too great influence over one, this\r\n    would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still\r\n    remain free might oppose him with forces, independent of those which\r\n    he had usurped, and overpower him before he could be settled in his\r\n    usurpation.\r\n\r\n    \"'Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate\r\n    States, the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one\r\n    part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The State may be\r\n    destroyed on one side and not on the other; the confederacy may be\r\n    dissolved and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.\r\n\r\n    \"'As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the\r\n    internal happiness of each, and with respect to its external\r\n    situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the\r\n    advantages of large monarchies.'\r\n\r\n    \"I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting\r\n    passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal\r\n    arguments in favor of the Union, and must effectually remove the false\r\n    impressions which a misapplication of the other parts of the work were\r\n    calculated to produce. They have, at the same time, an intimate\r\n    connection with the more immediate design of this paper; which is to\r\n    illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and\r\n    insurrection.\r\n\r\n    \"A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a\r\n    _confederacy_ and a _consolidation_ of the States. The essential\r\n    characteristic of the first, is said to be the restriction of its\r\n    authority to the members in their collective capacities, without\r\n    reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended\r\n    that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of\r\n    internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the\r\n    members, has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a\r\n    confederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary;\r\n    they are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed\r\n    happened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the\r\n    manner which the distinction taken notice of supposes to be inherent\r\n    in their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive\r\n    exceptions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example\r\n    will go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be\r\n    clearly shown, in the course of this investigation, that, as far as\r\n    the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of\r\n    incurable disorder and imbecility in the government.\r\n\r\n    \"The definition of a _confederate republic_ seems simply to be 'an\r\n    assemblage of societies,' or an association of two or more States into\r\n    one State. The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal\r\n    authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate\r\n    organization of the members be not abolished, so long as it exists by\r\n    a constitutional necessity for local purposes, though it should be in\r\n    perfect subordination to the general authority of the Union, it would\r\n    still be, in fact and theory, an association of States, or a\r\n    confederacy The proposed constitution, so far from implying an\r\n    abolition of the State government, makes them constituent parts of the\r\n    national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the\r\n    senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive, and very\r\n    important, portions of the sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in\r\n    every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal\r\n    government.\r\n\r\n    \"In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES, or\r\n    republics, the largest were entitled to _three_ votes in the COMMON\r\n    COUNCIL, those of the middle class to _two_, and the smallest to\r\n    _one_. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and\r\n    magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most\r\n    delicate species of interference in their internal administration; for\r\n    if there be anything that seems exclusively appropriated to the local\r\n    jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers. Yet\r\n    Montesquieu, speaking of this association, says, 'Were I to give a\r\n    model of an excellent confederate republic, it would be that of\r\n    Lycia.' Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not\r\n    within the contemplation of this enlightened writer, and we shall be\r\n    led to conclude that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous\r\n    theory.\"\r\n\r\nThe important paper just quoted from the \"Federalist,\" is from the gifted\r\npen of James Madison, so long a prominent and leading statesman in the\r\ndemocratic party, and one of the framers of our present government. Had we\r\nspace we would quote another, equally important, from the same source and\r\nupon the same subject.\r\n\r\nThis paper, its pointed facts and its powerful reasoning in favor of a\r\nstable Union, such as was contemplated by the present constitution, and\r\nagainst the defects of the old confederation, we commend to the particular\r\nattention of the thinking masses of the present democratic party. Although\r\nwritten before the adoption of the existing constitution, and for the\r\nexpress purpose of inducing the people to ratify that constitution, it\r\ncontains much that is applicable to the present political juncture,\r\ninasmuch as the present secession dogmas of South Carolina and of the\r\nCalhoun school of politicians are exactly the loose, inefficient\r\nprinciples of that old confederation, and opposed to those of the present\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nWe will here make an extract from another paper of the \"Federalist,\" to\r\nshow how Jay, Madison and Hamilton regarded the defects of that\r\nconfederation--to illustrate, with clearness, the _absolute necessity_ of\r\nthe adoption of our present constitution, considering, as they did, that\r\nit would constitute an efficient remedy for those defects:\r\n\r\n    \"CONCERNING THE DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION, IN RELATION TO\r\n    THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGISLATION FOR THE STATES IN THEIR COLLECTIVE\r\n    CAPACITIES.\r\n\r\n    \"In the course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my fellow\r\n    citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light, the\r\n    importance of union to your political safety and happiness. I have\r\n    unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be\r\n    exposed, should you permit that sacred knot, which binds the people of\r\n    America together, to be severed or dissolved by ambition or by\r\n    avarice, by jealousy or by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the\r\n    inquiry, through which I propose to accompany you, the truths intended\r\n    to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and\r\n    arguments hitherto unnoticed.\r\n\r\n    \"In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of\r\n    the subject, the point next in order to be examined is the\r\n    'insufficiency of the present confederation to the preservation of the\r\n    Union.'\r\n\r\n    \"It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof to\r\n    illustrate a position which is neither controverted nor doubted; to\r\n    which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent;\r\n    and which, in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the\r\n    friends of the new constitution? It must in truth be acknowledged,\r\n    that however these may differ in other respects, they in general\r\n    appear to harmonize in the opinion, that there are material\r\n    imperfections in our national system, and that something is necessary\r\n    to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts that support\r\n    this opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced\r\n    themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at\r\n    length extorted from those whose mistaken policy has had the principal\r\n    share in precipitating the extremity at which we have arrived, a\r\n    reluctant confession of the reality of many of those defects in the\r\n    scheme of our federal government, which have been long pointed out and\r\n    regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union.\r\n\r\n    \"We may indeed with propriety, be said to have reached almost the last\r\n    stage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can\r\n    wound the pride, or degrade the character, of an independent people,\r\n    which we do not experience. Are there engagements, to the performance\r\n    of which we are held by every tie respectable among men? These are the\r\n    subjects of constant and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to\r\n    foreigners, and to our own citizens, contracted in a time of imminent\r\n    peril, for the preservation of our political existence? These remain\r\n    without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have\r\n    we valuable territories and important posts in the possession of a\r\n    foreign power, which, by express stipulations, ought long since to\r\n    have been surrendered? These are still retained, to the prejudice of\r\n    our interest not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to\r\n    resent or to repel the aggression? We have neither troops, nor\r\n    treasury, nor government.[2] Are we even in a condition to remonstrate\r\n    with dignity? The just imputations on our own faith, in respect to the\r\n    same treaty, ought first to be removed. Are we entitled, by nature and\r\n    compact, to a free participation in the navigation of the Mississippi?\r\n    Spain excludes us from it. Is public credit an indispensable resource\r\n    in time of public danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause as\r\n    desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national\r\n    wealth? Ours is at the lowest point of declension. Is respectability\r\n    in the eyes of foreign powers, a safeguard against foreign\r\n    encroachments? The imbecility of our government even forbids them to\r\n    treat with us: Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic\r\n    sovereignty. Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land\r\n    a symptom of national distress? The price of improved land, in most\r\n    parts of the country, is much lower than can be accounted for by the\r\n    quantity of waste land at market, and can be only fully explained by\r\n    that want of private and public confidence, which are so alarmingly\r\n    prevalent among all ranks, and which have a direct tendency to\r\n    depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and\r\n    patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to borrowing\r\n    and lending, is reduced within the narrowest limits, and this still\r\n    more from an opinion of insecurity than from a scarcity of money. To\r\n    shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither\r\n    pleasure nor instruction, it may in general be demanded, what\r\n    indication is there of national disorder, poverty, and insignificance,\r\n    that could befal a community so peculiarly blessed with natural\r\n    advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue\r\n    of our public misfortunes?\r\n\r\n    \"This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by\r\n    those very maxims and councils, which would now deter us from adopting\r\n    the proposed constitution; and which, not content with having\r\n    conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us\r\n    into the abyss that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by\r\n    every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us\r\n    make firm stand for our safety, our tranquility, our dignity, our\r\n    reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long\r\n    seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true, as has been before observed, that facts too stubborn to\r\n    be resisted, have produced a species of general assent to the abstract\r\n    proposition, that there exist material defects in our national system;\r\n    but the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old\r\n    adversaries of federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous\r\n    opposition to a remedy, upon the only principles that can give it a\r\n    chance of success. While they admit that the government of the United\r\n    States is destitute of energy, they contend against conferring upon it\r\n    those powers which are requisite to supply that energy. They seem\r\n    still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an\r\n    augmentation of federal authority, without a diminution of State\r\n    authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in\r\n    the members. They still, in fine, seem to cherish with blind devotion\r\n    the political monster of an _imperium in imperio_. This renders a full\r\n    display of the principal defects of the confederation necessary, in\r\n    order to show, that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute\r\n    or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure\r\n    of the building, which cannot be amended, otherwise than by an\r\n    alteration in the very elements and main pillars of the fabric.\r\n\r\n    \"The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing\r\n    confederation, is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or\r\n    GOVERNMENTS in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as\r\n    contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of whom they consist. Though\r\n    this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the\r\n    Union, yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the\r\n    rest depends.\"\r\n\r\nA violation of any of the articles of the old confederation was the act\r\nonly of the States, as sovereign and independent parties to a contract,\r\nand did not implicate individuals in the crime of _treason_, if acting\r\n_under the sanction_ of such a State. Not so, however, with individuals\r\nunder the present constitution, even though acting under the sanction of\r\nparticular States; because the present constitution is that of the\r\n_people_ and not of the States as States in their sovereign capacity, for\r\nthe _people_ of the States have delegated to a general government, in the\r\nconstitution, certain powers, which are taken away from the States, and\r\ncannot, therefore, be exercised by those States without subjecting the\r\n_people_ of the States so exorcising them to punishment for _high\r\ntreason_.\r\n\r\nTo show that eminent statesmen, even before the adoption of our present\r\nconstitution, so regarded the principles of the government proposed to be\r\nestablished under it, we will quote another extract from the \"Federalist,\"\r\ncommencing on page 102 of vol. I:\r\n\r\n    \"If it be possible to construct a federal government capable of\r\n    regulating the common concerns, and preserving the general\r\n    tranquility, it must be founded, as to the objects committed to its\r\n    care, upon the REVERSE of the principle contended for by the opponents\r\n    of the proposed constitution. It must carry its agency to the PERSONS\r\n    OF THE CITIZENS. It must stand in need of no intermediate legislation;\r\n    but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary\r\n    magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the national\r\n    authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts of\r\n    justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State, must be\r\n    able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of\r\n    INDIVIDUALS, and to attract to its support those passions which have\r\n    the strongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short,\r\n    possess all the means, and have a right to all the methods, of\r\n    executing the powers with which it is entrusted, that are possessed\r\n    and exercised by the governments of the particular States.\"\r\n\r\nAn argument against the adoption of our present constitution was urged by\r\nits enemies to prevent its adoption, that it would create a central\r\ngovernment _too strong_--a government _so strong_ as to endanger the\r\nreserved rights of the States. This objection is thus stated and answered\r\nupon pages 106 and 107, vol. I, of the \"Federalist:\"\r\n\r\n    \"It may be said, that it would tend to render the government of the\r\n    Union too powerful, and to enable it to absorb those residuary\r\n    authorities which it might be judged proper to leave with the States\r\n    for local purposes. Allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power,\r\n    which any reasonable man can require, I confess I am at a loss to\r\n    discover what temptation the persons entrusted with the administration\r\n    of the general government, could ever feel to divest the States of the\r\n    authorities of that description. The regulation of the mere domestic\r\n    police of a State appears to me to hold out slender allurements to\r\n    ambition. Commerce, finance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend\r\n    all the objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion;\r\n    and all the powers necessary to those objects ought, in the first\r\n    instance, to be lodged in the national depository. The administration\r\n    of private justice between the citizens of the same State; the\r\n    supervision of agriculture, and of other concerns of a similar nature;\r\n    all those things, in short, which are proper to be provided for by\r\n    local legislation, can never be desirable cares of a general\r\n    jurisdiction. It is, therefore, improbable that there should exist a\r\n    disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which\r\n    they are connected; because the attempt to exercise them would be as\r\n    troublesome as it would be nugatory; and the possession of them, for\r\n    that reason, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the\r\n    importance, or to the splendor of the national government.\"\r\n\r\nWe will close our extracts from the luminous papers of the \"Federalist,\"\r\nwith the following, premising, however, that, in these fearful times of\r\nraging secession madness, it would be well if the whole two volumes could\r\nbe put in the hands of every intelligent individual in the nation. This\r\nextract refers again to the defects and the lamentable inefficiency of the\r\nold confederation, as contrasted with the proposed efficiency and\r\nstability of the government under the new constitution, a subject which\r\ncannot be too deeply engraven upon the mind of every patriot to whatever\r\nparty he may belong. It can be found commencing upon page 131, of vol. 1,\r\nof the \"Federalist,\" and ending on page 133:\r\n\r\n    \"Having in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the\r\n    principal circumstances and events which depict the genius and fate of\r\n    other confederate governments, I shall now proceed in the enumeration\r\n    of the most important of those defects which have hitherto\r\n    disappointed our hopes from the system established among ourselves. To\r\n    form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper remedy, it is\r\n    absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted with the extent\r\n    and malignity of the disease.\r\n\r\n    \"The next most palpable defect of the existing confederation, is the\r\n    total want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States, as now\r\n    composed, have no power to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to\r\n    their resolutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a suspension or\r\n    divestiture of privileges, or by any other constitutional means. There\r\n    is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against\r\n    delinquent members; and if such a right should be ascribed to the\r\n    federal head, as resulting from the nature of the social compact\r\n    between the States, it must be by inference and construction, in the\r\n    face of that part of the second article, by which it is declared,\r\n    'that each State shall retain every power, jurisdiction, and right,\r\n    not _expressly_ delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.'\r\n    The want of such a right involves, no doubt, a striking absurdity, but\r\n    we are reduced to the dilemma, either of supposing that deficiency,\r\n    preposterous as it may seem, or of contravening or explaining away a\r\n    provision, which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of\r\n    those who oppose the new constitution; and the omission of which, in\r\n    that plan, has been the subject of much plausible animadversion and\r\n    severe criticism. If we are unwilling to impair the force of this\r\n    applauded provision, we shall be obliged to conclude that the United\r\n    States affords the extraordinary spectacle of a government destitute\r\n    even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the execution of\r\n    its own laws. It will appear, from the specimens which have been\r\n    cited, that the American confederacy, in this particular, stands\r\n    discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind, and\r\n    exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world.\r\n\r\n    \"The want of a mutual guarantee of the State governments, is another\r\n    capital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing of this\r\n    kind declared in the articles that compose it; and to imply a tacit\r\n    guarantee from considerations of utility, would be a still more\r\n    flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned, than to\r\n    imply a tacit power of coercion, from the like consideration. The want\r\n    of a guarantee, though it might in its consequences endanger the\r\n    Union, does not so immediately attack its existence, as the want of a\r\n    constitutional sanction to its laws.\r\n\r\n    \"Without a guarantee, the assistance to be derived from the Union in\r\n    repelling those domestic dangers, which may sometimes threaten the\r\n    existence of the State constitutions, must be renounced. Usurpation\r\n    may rear its crest in each State, and trample upon the liberties of\r\n    the people, while the national government could legally do nothing\r\n    more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A\r\n    successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law,\r\n    while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union to the\r\n    friends and supporters of the government. The tempestuous situation,\r\n    from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged, evinces, that dangers\r\n    of this kind are not merely speculative. Who can determine what might\r\n    have been the issue of her late convulsions, if the mal-contents had\r\n    been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell? Who can predict what a\r\n    despotism, established in Massachusetts, would have upon the liberties\r\n    of New Hampshire or Rhode Island, of Connecticut or New York?\r\n\r\n    \"The inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some minds\r\n    an objection to the principle of a guarantee to the federal\r\n    government, as involving an officious interference in the domestic\r\n    concerns of the members. A scruple of this kind would deprive us of\r\n    one of the principal advantages to be expected from Union, and can\r\n    only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision\r\n    itself. It could be no impediment to reforms of the State\r\n    constitutions by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable\r\n    mode. This right would remain undiminished. The guarantee could only\r\n    operate against changes to be effected by violence. Towards the\r\n    prevention of calamities of this kind, too many checks cannot be\r\n    provided. The peace of society and the stability of government depend\r\n    absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions on this head. Where the\r\n    whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is\r\n    the less pretence for the use of violent remedies, in partial or\r\n    occasional distempers of the State. The natural cure for an\r\n    ill-administration, in a popular representative constitution, is a\r\n    change of men. A guarantee by the national authority would be as much\r\n    directed against the usurpations of rulers, as against the ferments\r\n    and outrages of faction and sedition in the community.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus far briefly enumerated some of the important powers granted\r\nby the people of the United States in their sovereign capacity, to the\r\npresent federal government. We have endeavored to show that the people,\r\nhaving granted certain powers to the general government, such powers are\r\nnecessarily withdrawn from the several States by the people thereof for\r\nthe purpose of establishing one grand central power, which, when exercised\r\nwithin its delegated authority, should be recognized as the supreme law of\r\nthe land; hence the people of the several States having to the extent of\r\nthe powers granted, surrendered the separate State sovereignty, they\r\nbecame one grand, inseparable, sovereign and independent nation. The very\r\nfact that each and every citizen of our entire country has a voice in\r\ncontrolling the policy of the general government, shows conclusively that\r\nthey owe obedience to its enactments, consequently, our national laws are\r\nalike binding upon every individual from Florida to Maine, and from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nBut independent of our arguments, we have in the foregoing pages presented\r\ncopious extracts from letters written by Messrs. Madison, Jay and Hamilton\r\npending the adoption of the constitution, all of which must convince the\r\nmost skeptical, that all parties at that time understood that they were\r\ngranting certain powers to the general government that could not\r\nthereafter be resumed and controlled by the various States. The able\r\nmanner in which the importance of such an arrangement is argued, the clear\r\nand conclusive reasoning, the contrasts drawn between one great and\r\npowerful nation and several petty, jealous, contending little\r\nsovereignties, should cast into the shade the weak sophism that is palmed\r\noff by the political demagogues of the present day for the purpose of\r\ndividing the people, under the disguise of what is called State\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe arguments already advanced to show that we have a national government\r\nwhose authority is supreme throughout the length and breadth of this\r\ncountry, (State laws to the contrary notwithstanding,) should be\r\nsufficient to convince the most ultra States rights secessionist that his\r\ndogma is only a garbled name for treason. Nevertheless, we will now\r\nproceed to give in full the celebrated Proclamation issued to the\r\nnullifiers of South Carolina twenty-eight years ago by the hero of the\r\nbattle of New Orleans, recommending its careful perusal by every American\r\ncitizen who has a spark of patriotism left within him. Its noble,\r\npatriotic sentiments will be found decidedly refreshing when contrasted\r\nwith the crouching imbecility and indecision that has characterized not\r\nonly James Buchanan but many of our leading politicians in the present\r\ndangerous, suffering and distracted condition of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson, a brave, daring, noble hero, knowing his duty, hastened\r\nto perform it in defiance of every obstacle; he resolves to save his\r\ncountry, at every hazard, from falling into the vortex of anarchy, ruin\r\nand disgrace.\r\n\r\nWhen the hydra-headed monster, treason, began to make its appearance, the\r\nhonored son of Tennessee, whose name is held in reverence by every friend\r\nof liberty, whose memory will be honored as the savior of his country,\r\nactuated by a high sense of his duty, with true Roman firmness, standing\r\nupon the temple of liberty, proclaiming to the world that he will maintain\r\nthe integrity of his country or perish while marching under its glorious\r\nbanner warning the enemies of the Union, to pause and consider the awful\r\nconsequences of persisting in their treasonable designs, and decide\r\nwhether they are prepared to assume such a terrible responsibility.\r\n\r\nI will now give his proclamation in full, hoping that the spirit of\r\npatriotism, firmness and justice therein contained will cause a heartfelt\r\nresponse by my fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n_Proclamation of Andrew Jackson, President of the United States._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, a convention assembled in the State of South Carolina have passed\r\nan ordinance, by which they declare \"That the several acts and parts of\r\nacts of the congress of the United States, purporting to be laws for the\r\nimposing of duties and imposts on the importation of foreign commodities,\r\nand now having actual operation and effect within the United States, and\r\nmore especially,\" two acts for the same purposes passed on the 29th of\r\nMay, 1828, and on the 14th of July, 1832, \"are unauthorized by the\r\nconstitution of the United States, and violate the true meaning and intent\r\nthereof, and are null and void, and no law,\" nor binding on the citizens\r\nof that State or its officers: and by the said ordinance, it is further\r\ndeclared to be unlawful for any of the constituted authorities of the\r\nState or of the United States to enforce the payment of the duties imposed\r\nby the said acts within the same State, and that it is the duty of the\r\nLegislature to pass such laws as may be necessary to give full effect to\r\nthe said ordinance:\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS, By the said ordinance, it is further ordained that, in no\r\ncase of law or equity decided in the courts of said State, wherein shall\r\nbe drawn in question the validity of the said ordinance, or of the acts of\r\nthe legislature that may be passed to give it effect, or of the said laws\r\nof the United States, no appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or\r\nallowed for that purpose, and that any person attempting to take such\r\nappeal shall be punished as for a contempt of court:\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the said ordinance declares that the people of South\r\nCarolina will maintain the said ordinance at every hazard; and that they\r\nwill consider the passage of any act, by congress, abolishing or closing\r\nthe ports of the said State, or otherwise obstructing the free ingress or\r\negress of vessels to and from the said ports, or any other act of the\r\nFederal Government to coerce the State, shut up her ports, destroy or\r\nharrass her commerce, or to enforce the said acts otherwise than through\r\nthe civil tribunals of the country, as inconsistant with the longer\r\ncontinuance of South Carolina in the Union, and that the people of the\r\nsaid State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further\r\nobligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the\r\npeople of the other States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a\r\nseparate government, and do all other acts and things which sovereign and\r\nindependent States may of right do.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS, the said ordinance prescribes to the people of South Carolina\r\na course of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizens of the\r\nUnited States, contrary to the laws of their country, subversive of its\r\nconstitution, and having for its object the destruction of the Union--that\r\nUnion, which, coeval with our political existence, led our fathers,\r\nwithout any other ties to unite them than those of patriotism and a common\r\ncause, through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence--that\r\nsacred Union, hitherto inviolate, which, perfected by our happy\r\nconstitution, has brought us, by the favor of Heaven, to a state of\r\nprosperity at home, and high consideration abroad, rarely, if ever,\r\nequalled in the history of nations. To preserve this bond of our political\r\nexistence from destruction, to maintain inviolate this state of national\r\nhonor and prosperity, and to justify the confidence my fellow citizens\r\nhave reposed in me, I, ANDREW JACKSON, _President of the United States_,\r\nhave thought proper to issue this my PROCLAMATION, stating my views of the\r\nconstitution and laws applicable to the measures adopted by the convention\r\nof South Carolina, and to the reasons they have put forth to sustain them,\r\ndeclaring the course which duty will require me to pursue, and, appealing\r\nto the understanding and patriotism of the people, warn them of the\r\nconsequences that must inevitably result from an observance of the\r\ndictates of the convention.\r\n\r\nStrict duty would require of me nothing more than the exercise of those\r\npowers with which I am now, or may hereafter be invested, for preserving\r\nthe peace of the Union, and for the execution of the laws. But the\r\nimposing aspect which opposition has assumed in this case, by clothing\r\nitself with State authority, and the deep interest which the people of the\r\nUnited States must all feel in preventing a resort to stronger measures,\r\nwhile there is a hope that anything will be yielded to reasoning and\r\nremonstrance, perhaps demand, and will certainly justify, a full\r\nexposition to South Carolina and the nation of the views I entertain of\r\nthis important question, as well as a distinct enunciation of the course\r\nwhich my sense of duty will require me to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance is founded, not on the indefeasible right of resisting acts\r\nwhich are plainly unconstitutional, and too oppressive to be endured; but\r\non the strange position that any one State may not only declare an act of\r\ncongress void, but prohibit its execution--that they may do this\r\nconsistently with the constitution--that the true construction of that\r\ninstrument permits a State to retain its place in the Union, and yet be\r\nbound by no other of its laws than those it may choose to consider as\r\nconstitutional. It is true, they add, that to justify this abrogation of a\r\nlaw, it must be palpably contrary to the constitution; but it is evident,\r\nthat, to give the right of resisting laws of that description, coupled\r\nwith the uncontrolled right to decide what laws deserve that character, is\r\nto give the power of resisting all laws. For, as by the theory, there is\r\nno appeal, the reasons alleged by the State, good or bad must prevail. If\r\nit should be said that public opinion is a sufficient check against the\r\nabuse of this power, it may be asked why it is not deemed a sufficient\r\nguard against the passage of an unconstitutional act by congress? There\r\nis, however, a restraint in this last case, which makes the assumed power\r\nof a State more indefensible, and which does not exist in the other. There\r\nare two appeals from an unconstitutional act passed by congress--one to\r\nthe judiciary, the other to the people and the States. There is no appeal\r\nfrom the State decision in theory, and the practical illustration shows\r\nthat the courts are closed against an application to review it, both\r\njudges and jurors being sworn to decide in its favor. But reasoning on\r\nthis subject is superfluous, when our social compact, in express terms,\r\ndeclares that the laws of the United States, its constitution, and\r\ntreaties made under it, are the supreme law of the land; and, for greater\r\ncaution, adds \"that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\r\nanything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\" And it may be asserted without fear of refutation, that\r\nno federal government could exist without a similar provision. Look for a\r\nmoment to the consequence. If South Carolina considers the revenue laws\r\nunconstitutional, and has a right to prevent their execution in the port\r\nof Charleston, there would be a clear constitutional objection to their\r\ncollection in every other port, and no revenue could be collected\r\nanywhere; for all imposts must be equal. It is no answer to repeat, that\r\nan unconstitutional law is no law, so long as the question of its legality\r\nis to be decided by the State itself; for every law operating injuriously\r\nupon any local interest will be perhaps thought, and certainly\r\nrepresented, as unconstitutional, and, as has been shown, there is no\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nIf this doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would\r\nhave been dissolved in its infancy. The excise law in Pennsylvania, the\r\nembargo and non-intercourse law in the eastern States, the carriage tax in\r\nVirginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more equal in their\r\noperation than any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately none of\r\nthose States discovered that they had the right now claimed by South\r\nCarolina. The war into which we were forced to support the dignity of the\r\nnation and the rights of our citizens, might have ended in defeat and\r\ndisgrace instead of victory and honor, if the States who supposed it a\r\nruinous and unconstitutional measure, had thought they possessed the right\r\nof nullifying the act by which it was declared, and denying supplies for\r\nits prosecution. Hardly and unequally as those measures bore upon several\r\nmembers of the Union, to the legislatures of none did this efficient and\r\npeaceable remedy, as it is called, suggest itself. The discovery of this\r\nimportant feature in our constitution was reserved to the present day. To\r\nthe statesmen of South Carolina belongs the invention, and upon the\r\ncitizens of that State will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of a State veto upon the laws of the Union carries with it\r\ninternal evidence of its impracticable absurdity, our constitutional\r\nhistory will also afford abundant proof that it would have been repudiated\r\nwith indignation, had it been proposed to form a feature in our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn our colonial state, although dependent on another power, we very early\r\nconsidered ourselves as connected by common interest with each other.\r\nLeagues were formed for common defence, and, before the declaration of\r\nindependence, we were known in our aggregate character _as the United\r\nColonies of America_. That decisive and important step was taken jointly.\r\nWe declared ourselves a nation by a joint, not by several acts, and when\r\nthe terms of our confederation were reduced to form, it was in that of a\r\nsolemn league of several States, by which they agreed that they would\r\ncollectively form one nation for the purpose of conducting some certain\r\ndomestic concerns and all foreign relations. In the instrument forming\r\nthat Union is found an article which declares that \"every State shall\r\nabide by the determinations of congress on all questions which, by that\r\nconfederation, should be submitted to them.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the confederation, then, no State could legally annul a decision of\r\nthe congress, or refuse to submit to its execution; but no provision was\r\nmade to enforce these decisions. Congress made requisitions, but they were\r\nnot complied with. The government could not operate on individuals. They\r\nhad no judiciary, no means of collecting revenue.\r\n\r\nBut the defects of the confederation need not be detailed. Under its\r\noperation we could scarcely be called a nation. We had neither prosperity\r\nat home nor consideration abroad. This state of things could not be\r\nendured, and our present happy constitution was formed, but formed in\r\nvain, if this fatal doctrine prevails. It was formed for important objects\r\nthat are announced in the preamble made in the name and by the authority\r\nof the people of the United States, whose delegates framed, and whose\r\nconventions approved it. The most important among these objects, that\r\nwhich is placed first in the rank, on which all others rest, is, \"_to form\r\na more perfect Union_.\" Now, is it possible that even if there were no\r\nexpress provision giving supremacy to the constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States over those of the States--can it be conceived, that an\r\ninstrument made for the purpose of \"_forming a more perfect Union_\" than\r\nthat of the confederation, could be so constructed by the assembled wisdom\r\nof our country as to substitute for that confederation a form of\r\ngovernment dependent for its existence on the local interest, the party\r\nspirit of a State, or of a prevailing faction in a State? Every man of\r\nplain, unsophisticated understanding, who hears the question, will give\r\nsuch an answer as will preserve the Union. Metaphysical subtlety, in\r\npursuit of an impracticable theory, could alone have devised one that is\r\ncalculated to destroy it.\r\n\r\nI consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed\r\nby one State, _incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted\r\nexpressly by the letter of the constitution, unauthorized by its spirit,\r\ninconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive\r\nof the great object for which it was formed_.\r\n\r\nAfter this general view of the leading principle, we must examine the\r\nparticular application of it which is made in the ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe preamble rests its justification on those grounds: It assumes, as a\r\nfact, that the obnoxious laws, although they purport to be laws for\r\nraising revenue, were in reality intended for the protection of\r\nmanufactures, which purpose it asserts to be unconstitutional; that the\r\noperation of these laws is unequal; that the amount raised by them is\r\ngreater than is required by the wants of the government; and, finally,\r\nthat the proceeds are to be applied to objects unauthorized by the\r\nconstitution. These are the only causes alleged to justify an open\r\nopposition to the laws of the country, and a threat of seceding from the\r\nUnion, if any attempt should be made to enforce them. The first virtually\r\nacknowledges that the law in question was passed under a power expressly\r\ngiven by the constitution to lay and collect imposts; but its\r\nconstitutionality is drawn in question from the _motives_ of those who\r\npassed it. However apparent this purpose may be in the present case,\r\nnothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an\r\nunconstitutional purpose, entertained by the members who assent to a law\r\nenacted under a constitutional power, shall make the law void: for how is\r\nthat purpose to be ascertained? Who is to make the scrutiny? How often may\r\nbad purposes be falsely imputed--in how many cases are they concealed by\r\nfalse professions--in how many is no declaration of motive made? Admit\r\nthis doctrine, and you give to the States an uncontrolled right to decide,\r\nand every law may be annulled under this pretext. If, therefore, the\r\nabsurd and dangerous doctrine should be admitted, that a State may annul\r\nan unconstitutional law, or one that it deems such, it will not apply to\r\nthe present case.\r\n\r\nThe next objection is, that the laws in question operate unequally. This\r\nobjection may be made with truth to every law that has been or can be\r\npassed. The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that\r\nwould operate with perfect equality. If the unequal operation of a law\r\nmakes it unconstitutional, and if all laws of that description may be\r\nabrogated by any State for that cause, then indeed is the Federal\r\nConstitution unworthy of the slightest effort for its preservation. We\r\nhave hitherto relied on it as the perpetual bond of our Union. We have\r\nreceived it as the work of the assembled wisdom of the nation. We have\r\ntrusted to it as to the sheet anchor of our safety in the stormy times of\r\nconflict with a foreign or domestic foe. We have looked to it with sacred\r\nawe as the palladium of our liberties, and with all the solemnities of\r\nreligion have pledged to each other our lives and fortunes here, and our\r\nhopes of happiness hereafter, in its defence and support. Were we\r\nmistaken, my countrymen, in attaching this importance to the Constitution\r\nof our country? Was our devotion paid to the wretched, inefficient,\r\nclumsy, contrivance which this new doctrine would make it? Did we pledge\r\nourselves to the support of an airy nothing--a bubble that must be blown\r\naway by the first breath of disaffection? Was this self-destroying,\r\nvisionary theory, the work of the profound statesmen, the exalted\r\npatriots, to whom the task of constitutional reform was entrusted? Did the\r\nname of Washington sanction, did the States deliberately ratify such an\r\nanomaly in the history of fundamental legislation? No. We were not\r\nmistaken. The letter of this great instrument is free from this radical\r\nfault; its language directly contradicts the imputation; its spirit--its\r\nevident intent, contradicts it. No, we did not err! Our Constitution does\r\nnot contain the absurdity of giving power to make laws, and another power\r\nto resist them. The sages whose memory will always be reverenced, have\r\ngiven us a practical, and, as they hoped, a permanent constitutional\r\ncompact. The Father of his Country did not affix his revered name to so\r\npalpable an absurdity. Nor did the States, when they severally ratified\r\nit, do so under the impression that a veto on the laws of the United\r\nStates was reserved to them, or that they could exercise it by\r\nimplication. Search the debates in all their Conventions, examine the\r\nspeeches of the most zealous opposers of federal authority, look at the\r\namendments that were proposed--they are all silent--not a syllable\r\nuttered, not a vote given, not a motion made, to correct the explicit\r\nsupremacy given to the laws of the Union over those of the States, or to\r\nshow that implication, as is now contended, could defeat it. No, we have\r\nnot erred! The Constitution is still the object of our reverence, the bond\r\nof our Union, our defence in danger, the source of our prosperity in\r\npeace; it shall descend as we have received it, uncorrupted by sophistical\r\nconstruction, to our posterity, and the sacrifices of local interest, of\r\nState prejudices, of personal animosities, that were made to bring it into\r\nexistence, will again be patriotically offered for its support.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining objections made by the ordinance to these laws, are that\r\nthe sums intended to be raised by them are greater than are required, and\r\nthat the proceeds will be unconstitutionally employed.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has given, expressly, to Congress the right of raising\r\nrevenue, and of determining the sum the public exigencies will require.\r\nThe States have no control over the exercise of this right other than that\r\nwhich results from the power of changing the representatives who abuse it,\r\nand thus procure redress. Congress may, undoubtedly, abuse this\r\ndiscretionary power; but the same may be said of others with which they\r\nare vested. Yet the discretion must exist somewhere. The Constitution has\r\ngiven it to the representatives of all the people, checked by the\r\nrepresentatives of the States, and by the Executive power. The South\r\nCarolina construction gives it to the Legislature or the Convention of a\r\nsingle State, where neither the people of the different States, nor the\r\nStates in their separate capacity, nor the Chief Magistrate elected by the\r\npeople, have any representation. Which is the most discreet disposition of\r\nthe power? I do not ask you, fellow citizens, which is the constitutional\r\ndisposition--that instrument speaks a language not to be misunderstood.\r\nBut if you were assembled in general Convention, which would you think the\r\nsafest depository of this discretionary power in the last resort? Would\r\nyou add a clause giving it to each of the States, or would you sanction\r\nthe wise provisions already made by your Constitution? If this should be\r\nthe result of your deliberations when providing for the future, are you,\r\ncan you be ready, to risk all that we hold dear, to establish, for a\r\ntemporary and a local purpose, that which you must acknowledge to be\r\ndestructive, and even absurd, as a general provision? Carry out the\r\nconsequences of this right vested in the different States, and you must\r\nperceive that the crisis your conduct presents at this day would recur\r\nwhenever any law of the United States displeased any of the States, and\r\nthat we should soon cease to be a nation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance, with the same knowledge of the future that characterizes a\r\nformer objection, tells you that the proceeds of the tax will be\r\nunconstitutionally applied. If this could be ascertained with certainty,\r\nthe objection would, with more propriety, be reserved for the law so\r\napplying the proceeds, but surely cannot be urged against the laws levying\r\nthe duty.\r\n\r\nThese are the allegations contained in the ordinance. Examine them\r\nseriously, my fellow-citizens; judge for yourselves. I appeal to you to\r\ndetermine whether they are so clear, so convincing, as to leave no doubt\r\nof their correctness; and even if you should come to this conclusion, how\r\nfar they justify the reckless, destructive course which you are directed\r\nto pursue. Review these objections, and the conclusions drawn from them,\r\nonce more. What are they? Every law, then, for raising revenue, according\r\nto the South Carolina ordinance, may be rightfully annulled, unless it be\r\nso framed as no law ever will or can be framed. Congress have a right to\r\npass laws for raising a revenue, and each State has a right to oppose\r\ntheir execution--two rights directly opposed to each other; and yet is\r\nthis absurdity supposed to be contained in an instrument drawn for the\r\nexpress purpose of avoiding collisions between the States and the general\r\ngovernment, by an assembly of the most enlightened statesmen and purest\r\npatriots ever embodied for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nIn vain have these sages declared that congress shall have power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; in vain have they\r\nprovided that they shall have power to pass laws, which shall be necessary\r\nand proper to carry those powers into execution; that those laws and that\r\nconstitution shall be the \"supreme law of the land, and that the judges in\r\nevery State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws\r\nof any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\" In vain have the people of\r\nthe several States solemnly sanctioned these provisions, made them their\r\nparamount law, and individually sworn to support them whenever they were\r\ncalled on to execute any office. Vain provisions! ineffectual\r\nrestrictions! vile profanation of oaths! miserable mockery of legislation!\r\nif the bare majority of the voters in any one State may, on a real or\r\nsupposed knowledge of the intent with which a law has been passed, declare\r\nthemselves free from its operation--say here it gives too little, there\r\ntoo much, and operates unequally--here it suffers articles to be free that\r\nought to be taxed--there it taxes those that ought to be free--in this\r\ncase the proceeds are intended to be applied to purposes which we do not\r\napprove--in that the amount raised is more than is wanted. Congress, it is\r\ntrue, are invested by the constitution with the right of deciding these\r\nquestions according to their sound discretion; congress is composed of the\r\nrepresentatives of all the States, and of all the people of all the\r\nStates; but we, part of the people of one State, to whom the constitution\r\nhas given no power on the subject, from whom it has expressly taken it\r\naway--we, who have solemnly agreed that this constitution shall be our\r\nlaw--we, most of whom have sworn to support it--we now abrogate this law,\r\nand swear and force others to swear that it shall not be obeyed; and we do\r\nthis, not because congress have no right to pass such laws--this we do not\r\nallege--but because they have passed them with improper views. They are\r\nunconstitutional from the motives of those who passed them, which we can\r\nnever with certainty know; from their unequal operation, although it is\r\nimpossible, from the nature of things, that they should be equal; and from\r\nthe disposition which we presume may be made of their proceeds, although\r\nthat disposition has not been declared. This is the plain meaning of the\r\nordinance, in relation to laws which it abrogates for alleged\r\nunconstitutionality. But it does not stop there. It repeals, in express\r\nterms, an important part of the constitution itself, and of laws passed to\r\ngive it effect, which have never been alleged to be unconstitutional. The\r\nconstitution declares that the judicial powers of the United States extend\r\nto cases arising under the laws of the United States; and that such laws,\r\nthe constitution, and treaties, shall be paramount to the State\r\nconstitutions and laws. The judiciary act prescribes the mode by which the\r\ncase may be brought before a court of the United States by appeal, when a\r\nState tribunal shall decide against this provision of the constitution.\r\nThe ordinance declares that there shall be no appeal, makes the State law\r\nparamount to the constitution and laws of the United States, forces judges\r\nand jurors to swear that they will disregard their provisions, and even\r\nmakes it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal. It further\r\ndeclares, that it shall not be lawful for the authorities of the United\r\nStates, or of that State, to enforce the payment of duties imposed by the\r\nrevenue laws within its limits.\r\n\r\nHere is a law of the United States, not even pretended to be\r\nunconstitutional, repealed by the authority of a small majority of the\r\nvoters of a single State. Here is a provision of the constitution, which\r\nis solemnly abrogated by the same authority.\r\n\r\nOn such expositions and reasonings, the ordinance grounds not only an\r\nassertion of the right to annul the laws, of which it complains, but to\r\nenforce it by a threat of seceding from the Union, if any attempt is made\r\nto execute them.\r\n\r\nThis right to secede is deduced from the nature of the constitution, which\r\nthey say is a compact between sovereign States, who have preserved their\r\nwhole sovereignty, and therefore are subject to no superior; that because\r\nthey made the compact, they can break it, when, in their opinion, it has\r\nbeen departed from by the other States. Fallacious as this course of\r\nreasoning is, it enlists State pride, and finds advocates in the honest\r\nprejudices of those, who have not studied the nature of our government\r\nsufficiently to see the radical error, on which it rests.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States formed the constitution, acting through\r\nthe State legislatures in making the compact, to meet and discuss its\r\nprovisions, and acting in separate conventions, when they ratified those\r\nprovisions; but the terms used in its construction, show it to be a\r\ngovernment, in which the people of all the States collectively are\r\nrepresented. We are _one people_ in the choice of president and vice\r\npresident. Here the States have no other agency, than to direct the mode\r\nin which the votes shall be given. The candidates having a majority of all\r\nthe votes are chosen. The electors of a majority of States may have given\r\ntheir votes for one candidate, and yet another may be chosen. The people,\r\nthen, and not the States, are represented in the executive branch.\r\n\r\nIn the house of representatives there is this difference, that the people\r\nof one State do not, as in the case of president and vice president, all\r\nvote for the same officers. The people of all the States do not vote for\r\nall the members, each State electing only its own representatives. But\r\nthis creates no material distinction. When chosen, they are all\r\nrepresentatives of the United States, not representatives of the\r\nparticular State from whence they come. They are paid by the United\r\nStates, not by the State; nor are they accountable to it for any act done\r\nin the performance of their legislative functions; and however they may in\r\npractice, as it is their duty to do, consult and prefer the interests of\r\ntheir particular constituents, when they come in conflict with any other\r\npartial or local interest, yet it is their first and highest duty, as a\r\nrepresentative of the United States, to promote the general good.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the United States, then, forms a _government_, not a\r\nleague; and whether it be formed by compact between the States, or in any\r\nother manner, its character is the same. It is a government, in which all\r\nthe people are represented, which operates directly on the people\r\nindividually, not upon the States; they retained all the power they did\r\nnot grant. But each State having expressly parted with so many powers, as\r\nto constitute jointly with the other States a single nation, cannot from\r\nthat period possess any right to secede, because such secession does not\r\nbreak a league, but destroys the unity of a nation; and any injury to that\r\nunity is not only a breach, which would result from the contravention of a\r\ncompact, but it is an offence against the whole Union. To say that any\r\nState may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that the United\r\nStates are not a nation; because it would be a solecism to contend, that\r\nany part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts,\r\nto their injury or ruin, without committing any offence. Secession, like\r\nany other revolutionary act, may be morally justified by the extremity of\r\noppression; but to call it a constitutional right, is confounding the\r\nmeaning of terms; and can only be done through gross error, or to deceive\r\nthose, who are willing to assert a right, but would pause before they made\r\na revolution, or incur the penalties consequent on a failure.\r\n\r\nBecause the Union was formed by compact, it is said the parties to that\r\ncompact may, when they feel themselves aggrieved, depart from it; but it\r\nis precisely because it is a compact, that they cannot. A compact is an\r\nagreement, or binding obligation. It may, by its terms, have a sanction or\r\npenalty for its breach, or it may not. If it contains no sanction, it may\r\nbe broken with no other consequence than moral guilt; if it have a\r\nsanction, then the breach incurs the designated or implied penalty. A\r\nleague between independent nations generally has no sanction, other than a\r\nmoral one; or, if it should contain a penalty, as there is no common\r\nsuperior, it cannot be enforced. A government, on the contrary, always\r\nhas a saction, express or implied; and in our case, it is both necessarily\r\nimplied, and expressly given. An attempt by force of arms to destroy a\r\ngovernment, is an offence, by whatever means the constitutional compact\r\nmay have been formed; and such government has the right, by the law of\r\nself-defence, to pass acts for punishing the offender, unless that right\r\nis modified, restrained, or resumed by the constitutional act. In our\r\nsystem, although it is modified in the case of treason, yet authority is\r\nexpressly given to pass all laws necessary to carry its powers into\r\neffect, and under this grant provision has been made for punishing acts,\r\nwhich obstruct the due administration of the laws.\r\n\r\nIt would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that\r\nUnion, which connects us; but as erroneous opinions on this subject are\r\nthe foundation of doctrines the most destructive to our peace, I must give\r\nsome further development to my views on this subject. No one,\r\nfellow-citizens, has a higher reverence for the reserved rights of the\r\nStates, than the magistrate, who now addresses you. No one would make\r\ngreater personal sacrifices, or official exertions to defend them from\r\nviolation; but equal care must be taken to prevent, on their part, an\r\nimproper interference with, or resumption of the rights they have vested\r\nin the nation. The line has not been so distinctly drawn, as to avoid\r\ndoubts in some cases of the exercise of power. Men of the best intentions,\r\nand soundest views, may differ in their construction of some parts of the\r\nconstitution; but there are others, on which dispassionate reflection can\r\nleave no doubt. Of this nature appears to be the assumed right of\r\nsecession. It rests, as we have seen, on the alleged undivided sovereignty\r\nof the States, and on their having formed, in this sovereign capacity, a\r\ncompact, which is called the constitution, from which, because they made\r\nit, they have the right to secede. Both of these positions are erroneous,\r\nand some of the arguments to prove them so have been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe States severally have not retained their entire sovereignty. It has\r\nbeen shown, that, in becoming parts of a nation, not members of a league,\r\nthey surrendered many of their essential parts of sovereignty. The right\r\nto make treaties, declare war, levy taxes, exercise exclusive judicial\r\nand legislative powers, were all of them functions of sovereign power. The\r\nStates, then, for all these purposes, were no longer sovereign. The\r\nallegiance of their citizens was transferred, in the first instance, to\r\nthe government of the United States; they became American citizens, and\r\nowed obedience to the constitution of the United States, and to laws made\r\nin conformity with the powers it vested in congress. This last position\r\nhas not been, and cannot be denied. How, then, can that State be said to\r\nbe sovereign and independent whose citizens owe obedience to laws not made\r\nby it, and whose magistrates are sworn to disregard those laws when they\r\ncome in conflict with those passed by another? What shows conclusively\r\nthat the States cannot be said to have reserved an undivided sovereignty,\r\nis, that they expressly ceded the right to punish treason, not treason\r\nagainst their separate power, but treason against the United States.\r\nTreason is an offence against _sovereignty_, and sovereignty must reside\r\nwith the power to punish it. But the reserved rights of the States are not\r\nless sacred because they have, for their common interest, made the general\r\ngovernment the depository of these powers.\r\n\r\nThe unity of our political character (as has been shown for another\r\npurpose) commenced with its very existence. Under the royal government we\r\nhad no separate character: our opposition to its oppressions began as\r\n_united colonies_. We were the _United States_ under the confederation,\r\nand the name was perpetuated, and the Union rendered more perfect by the\r\nfederal constitution. In none of these stages did we consider ourselves in\r\nany other light than as forming one nation. Treaties and alliances were\r\nmade in the name of all. Troops were raised for the joint defence. How,\r\nthen, with all these proofs, that under all changes of our position we\r\nhad, for designated purposes and with defined powers, created national\r\ngovernments; how is it, that the most perfect of those several modes of\r\nunion should now be considered as a mere league, that may be dissolved at\r\npleasure? It is from an abuse of terms. \"Compact\" is used as synonymous\r\nwith \"league,\" although the true term is not employed, because it would\r\nat once show the fallacy of the reasoning. It would not do to say, that\r\nour constitution was only a league; but it is labored to prove it a\r\ncompact, (which in one sense it is,) and then to argue, that, as a league\r\nis a compact, every compact between nations must of course be a league,\r\nand that from such an engagement every sovereign power has a right to\r\nrecede. But it has been shown, that in this sense the States are not\r\nsovereign, and that even if they were, and the national constitution had\r\nbeen formed by compact, there would be no right in any one State to\r\nexonerate itself from its obligations.\r\n\r\nSo obvious are the reasons, which forbid this secession, that it is\r\nnecessary only to allude to them. The Union was formed for the benefit of\r\nall. It was produced by mutual sacrifices of interests and opinions. Can\r\nthose sacrifices be recalled? Can the States, who magnanimously\r\nsurrendered their title to the territories of the west, recall the grant?\r\nWill the inhabitants of the inland States agree to pay the duties, that\r\nmay be imposed without their assent, by those on the Atlantic or the Gulf,\r\nfor their own benefit? Shall there be a free port in one State, and\r\nonerous duties in another? No one believes, that any right exists, in a\r\nsingle State, to involve the others in these and countless other evils,\r\ncontrary to the engagements solemnly made. Every one must see, that the\r\nother States, in self-defence, must oppose it at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThese are the alternatives, that are presented by the convention: A repeal\r\nof all the acts for raising revenue, leaving the government without the\r\nmeans of support; or an acquiescence in the dissolution of our Union by\r\nthe secession of one of its members. When the first was proposed, it was\r\nknown, that it could not be listened to for a moment. It was known, if\r\nforce was applied to oppose the execution of the laws, that it must be\r\nrepelled by force; that congress could not, without involving itself in\r\ndisgrace, and the country in ruin, accede to the proposition; and yet, if\r\nthis is not done on a given day, or if any attempt is made to execute the\r\nlaws, the State is, by the ordinance, declared to be out of the Union. The\r\nmajority of a convention assembled for the purpose have dictated these\r\nterms, or rather this rejection of all terms, in the name of the people\r\nof South Carolina. It is true, that the governor of the State speaks of\r\nthe submission of their grievances to a convention of all the States,\r\nwhich, he says, they \"sincerely and anxiously seek and desire.\" Yet this\r\nobvious and constitutional mode of obtaining the sense of the other\r\nStates, on the construction of the federal compact, and amending it if\r\nnecessary, has never been attempted by those, who have urged the State on\r\nto this destructive measure. The State might have proposed the call for a\r\ngeneral convention to the other States; and congress, if a sufficient\r\nnumber of them concurred, must have called it. But the first magistrate of\r\nSouth Carolina, when he expressed a hope, that, \"on a review by congress\r\nand the functionaries of the general government of the merits of the\r\ncontroversy,\" such a convention will be accorded to them, must have known,\r\nthat neither congress, nor any functionary of the general government, has\r\nauthority to call such a convention, unless it be demanded by two-thirds\r\nof the States. This suggestion, then, is another instance of the reckless\r\ninattention to the provisions of the constitution, with which this crisis\r\nhas been madly hurried on; or of the attempt to persuade the people, that\r\na constitutional remedy had been sought and refused. If the legislature of\r\nSouth Carolina \"anxiously desire\" a general convention to consider their\r\ncomplaints, why have they not made application for it, in the way the\r\nconstitution points out? The assertion, that they \"earnestly seek\" it, is\r\ncompletely negatived by the omission.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the position in which we stand. A small majority of the\r\ncitizens of one State in the Union have elected delegates to a State\r\nConvention; that Convention has ordained that all the revenue laws of the\r\nUnited States must be repealed, or that they are no longer a member of\r\nthis Union. The Governor of that State has recommended to the Legislature\r\nthe raising of an army to carry the secession into effect, and that he may\r\nbe empowered to give clearances to vessels in the name of the State. No\r\nact of violent opposition to the laws has yet been committed, but such a\r\nstate of things is hourly apprehended; and it is the intent of this\r\ninstrument to proclaim, not only that the duty imposed on me by the\r\nConstitution \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" shall be\r\nperformed to the extent of the powers already vested in me by law, or of\r\nsuch others as the wisdom of Congress shall devise and entrust to me for\r\nthat purpose, but to warn the citizens of South Carolina who have been\r\ndeluded into an opposition to the laws, of the danger they will incur by\r\nobedience to the illegal and disorganizing ordinance of the Convention; to\r\nexhort those who have refused to support it to persevere in their\r\ndetermination to uphold the Constitution and laws of their country; and to\r\npoint out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that\r\nState have been led, and that the course they are urged to pursue is one\r\nof ruin and disgrace to the very State whose rights they affect to\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens of my native State, let me not only admonish you, as the\r\nFirst Magistrate of our common country, not to incur the penalty of its\r\nlaws, but use the influence that a father would over his children whom he\r\nsaw rushing to certain ruin. In that paternal language, with that paternal\r\nfeeling, let me tell you, my countrymen, that you are deluded by men who\r\nare either deceived themselves, or wish to deceive you. Mark under what\r\npretences you have been led on to the brink of insurrection and treason,\r\non which you stand! First, a diminution of the value of your staple\r\ncommodity, lowered by over production in other quarters, and the\r\nconsequent diminution in the value of your lands, were the sole effect of\r\nthe tariff laws.\r\n\r\nThe effect of those laws was confessedly injurious, but the evil was\r\ngreatly exaggerated by the unfounded theory you were taught to believe,\r\nthat its burthens were in proportion to your exports, not to your\r\nconsumption of imported articles. Your pride was roused by the assertion\r\nthat a submission to those laws was a state of vassalage, and that\r\nresistance to them was equal, in patriotic merit, to the opposition our\r\nfathers offered to the oppressive laws of Great Britain. You were told\r\nthat this opposition might be peaceably--might be constitutionally made;\r\nthat you might enjoy all the advantages of the Union, and bear none of its\r\nburthens. Eloquent appeals to your passions, to your State pride, to your\r\nnative courage, to your sense of real injury, were used to prepare you for\r\nthe period when the mask, which concealed the hideous features of\r\ndisunion, should be taken off. It fell, and you were made to look with\r\ncomplacency on objects which, not long since, you would have regarded with\r\nhorror. Look back to the arts which have brought you to this state--look\r\nforward to the consequences to which it must inevitably lead! Look back to\r\nwhat was first told you as an inducement to enter into this dangerous\r\ncourse. The great political truth was repeated to you, that you had the\r\nrevolutionary right of resisting all laws that were palpably\r\nunconstitutional and intolerably oppressive; it was added that the right\r\nto nullify a law rested on the same principle, but that it was a peaceable\r\nremedy! This character which was given to it, made you receive, with too\r\nmuch confidence, the assertions that were made of the unconstitutionality\r\nof the law and its oppressive effects. Mark, my fellow citizens, that, by\r\nthe admission of your leaders, the unconstitutionality must be _palpable_,\r\nor it will not justify either resistance or nullification! What is the\r\nmeaning of the word _palpable_, in the sense in which it is here used?\r\nthat which is apparent to every one; that which no man of ordinary\r\nintellect will fail to perceive. Is the unconstitutionality of these laws\r\nof that description? Let those among your leaders who once approved and\r\nadvocated the principle of protective duties, answer the question; and let\r\nthem choose whether they will be considered as incapable, then, of\r\nperceiving that which must have been apparent to every man of common\r\nunderstanding, or as imposing upon your confidence, and endeavoring to\r\nmislead you now. In either case, they are unsafe guides in the perilous\r\npath they urge you to tread. Ponder well on this circumstance, and you\r\nwill know how to appreciate the exaggerated language they address to you.\r\nThey are not champions of liberty emulating the fame of our revolutionary\r\nfathers; nor are you an oppressed people, contending, as they repeat to\r\nyou, against worse than colonial vassalage.\r\n\r\nYou are free members of a flourishing and happy Union. There is no settled\r\ndesign to oppress you. You have indeed felt the unequal operation of laws\r\nwhich may have been unwisely, not unconstitutionally passed; but that\r\ninequality must necessily be removed. At the very moment when you were\r\nmadly urged on to the unfortunate course you have begun, a change in\r\npublic opinion had commenced. The nearly approaching payment of the public\r\ndebt, and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duties, had already\r\nproduced a considerable reduction, and that, too, on some articles of\r\ngeneral consumption in your State. The importance of this change was\r\nunderrated, and you were authoritatively told that no further alleviation\r\nof your burthens were to be expected at the very time when the condition\r\nof the country imperiously demanded such a modification of the duties as\r\nshould reduce them to a just and equitable scale. But, as if apprehensive\r\nof the effect of this change in allaying your discontents, you were\r\nprecipitated into the fearful state in which you now find yourselves.\r\n\r\nI have urged you to look back to the means that were used to hurry you on\r\nto the position you have now assumed, and forward to the consequences it\r\nwill produce. Something more is necessary. Contemplate the condition of\r\nthat country of which you still form an important part. Consider its\r\ngovernment uniting in one bond of common interest and general protection\r\nso many different States--giving to all their inhabitants the proud title\r\nof American citizens, protecting their commerce, securing their literature\r\nand their arts; facilitating their intercommunication; defending their\r\nfrontiers; and making their name respected in the remotest parts of the\r\nearth. Consider the extent of its territory; its increasing and happy\r\npopulation; its advance in arts, which render life agreeable; and the\r\nsciences, which elevate the mind! See education spreading the lights of\r\nreligion, morality, and general information into every cottage in this\r\nwide extent of our Territories and States? Behold it as the asylum where\r\nthe wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and support! Look on this\r\npicture of happiness and honor, and say--_we, too, are citizens of\r\nAmerica!_ Carolina is one of these proud States--her arms have\r\ndefended--her best blood has cemented this happy Union! And then add, if\r\nyou can, without horror and remorse, this happy Union we will dissolve;\r\nthis picture of peace and prosperity we will deface; this free\r\nintercourse we will interrupt; these fertile fields we will deluge with\r\nblood; the protection of that glorious flag we renounce; the very name of\r\nAmericans we discard. And for what, mistaken men--for what do you throw\r\naway these inestimable blessings? for what would you exchange your share\r\nin the advantages and honor of the Union? For the dream of separate\r\nindependence--a dream interrupted by bloody conflicts with your neighbors,\r\nand a vile dependence on a foreign power. If your leaders could succeed in\r\nestablishing a separation, what would be your situation? Are you united at\r\nhome--are you free from the apprehension of civil discord, with all its\r\nfearful consequences? Do our neighboring republics, every day suffering\r\nsome new revolution, or contending with some new insurrection--do they\r\nexcite your envy? But the dictates of a high duty obliges me solemnly to\r\nannounce that you cannot succeed. The laws of the United States must be\r\nexecuted. I have no discretionary power on the subject--my duty is\r\nemphatically pronounced in the Constitution. Those who told you that you\r\nmight peaceably prevent their execution, deceived you--they could not have\r\nbeen deceived themselves. They know that a forcible opposition could alone\r\nprevent the execution of the laws, and they know that such opposition must\r\nbe repelled. Their object is disunion; but be not deceived by names;\r\ndisunion, by armed force, is _treason_. Are you really ready to incur its\r\nguilt? If you are, on the heads of the instigators of the act be the\r\ndreadful consequences--on their heads be the dishonor, but on yours may\r\nfall the punishment; on your unhappy State will inevitably fall all the\r\nevils of the conflict you force upon the government of your country. It\r\ncannot accede to the mad project of disunion, of which you would be the\r\nfirst victims--its First Magistrate cannot, if he would, avoid the\r\nperformance of his duty; the consequences must be fearful for you,\r\ndistressing to your fellow citizens here, and to the friends of good\r\ngovernment throughout the world. Its enemies have beheld our prosperity\r\nwith a vexation they could not conceal--it was a standing refutation of\r\ntheir slavish doctrines, and they will point to our discord with the\r\ntriumph of malignant joy. It is yet in your power to disappoint them.\r\nThere is yet time to show that the descendants of the Pinckneys, the\r\nSumters, the Rutledges, and of the thousand other names which adorn the\r\npages of your revolutionary history, will not abandon that Union, to\r\nsupport which so many of them fought, and bled, and died.\r\n\r\nI adjure you, as you honor their memory--as you love the cause of freedom,\r\nto which they dedicated their lives--as you prize the peace of your\r\ncountry, the lives of its best citizens, and your own fair fame, to\r\nretrace your steps. Snatch from the archives of your State the\r\ndisorganizing edict of its Convention--bid its members to re-assemble, and\r\npromulgate the decided expressions of your will to remain in the path\r\nwhich alone can conduct you to safety, prosperity, and honor. Tell them\r\nthat, compared to disunion, all other evils are light, because that brings\r\nwith it an accumulation of all. Declare that you will never take the field\r\nunless the star spangled banner of your country shall float over you; that\r\nyou will not be stigmatized when dead, and dishonored and scorned while\r\nyou live, as the authors of the first attack on the Constitution of your\r\ncountry. Its destroyers you cannot be. You may disturb its peace--you may\r\ninterrupt the course of its prosperity--you may cloud its reputation for\r\nstability, but its tranquility will be restored, its prosperity will\r\nreturn, and the stain upon its national character will be transferred, and\r\nremain an eternal blot on the memory of those who caused the disorder.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens of the United States! The threat of unhallowed\r\ndisunion--the names of those once respected, by whom it is uttered--the\r\narray of military force to support it--denote the approach of a crisis in\r\nour affairs, on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity, our\r\npolitical existence, and perhaps that of all free governments, may depend.\r\nThe conjuncture demanded a free, a full, and explicit enunciation, not\r\nonly of my intentions, but of my principles of action; and the claim was\r\nasserted of a right by a State to annul the laws of the Union, and even to\r\nsecede from it at pleasure, a frank exposition of my opinions in relation\r\nto the origin and form of our government, and the construction I give to\r\nthe instrument by which it was created, seemed to be proper. Having the\r\nfullest confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion\r\nof my duties, which has been expressed, I rely, with equal confidence, on\r\nyour undivided support in my determination to execute the laws--to\r\npreserve the Union by all constitutional means--to arrest, if possible, by\r\nmoderate but firm measures, the necessity of a recourse to force; and, if\r\nit be the will of Heaven, that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man\r\nfor the shedding of a brother's blood should fall upon our land, that it\r\nbe not called down by any offensive act on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens! the momentous case is before you. On your undivided\r\nsupport of your government depends the decision of the great question it\r\ninvolves, whether your sacred Union will be preserved, and the blessings\r\nit secures to us as one people, shall be perpetuated. No one can doubt\r\nthat the unanimity with which that decision will be expressed, will be\r\nsuch as to inspire new confidence in republican institutions, and that the\r\nprudence, the wisdom, and the courage which it will bring to their\r\ndefence, will transmit them unimpaired and invigorated to our children.\r\n\r\nMay the great Ruler of Nations grant that the signal blessings with which\r\nhe has favored ours, may not, by the madness of party or personal\r\nambition, be disregarded and lost; and may His wise providence bring those\r\nwho have produced this crisis to see their folly, before they feel the\r\nmisery of civil strife, and inspire a returning veneration for that Union,\r\nwhich, if we may dare to penetrate his designs, he has chosen as the only\r\nmeans of attaining the high destinies to which we may reasonably aspire.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, having signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 10th day of December, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the fifty-seventh.\r\n\r\n  ANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n  By the President:\r\n    EDW. LIVINGSTON, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\nComment upon the imperishable document just quoted is entirely\r\nunnecessary. It speaks for itself in thundering tones that strikes terror\r\nto the traitor's heart. Mark the clear and lucid reasoning,[3] the kind,\r\npaternal advice, the bold and manly warning that pervades this production,\r\nof the true, noble, honored patriot of the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of contrasting the administration of Andrew Jackson,\r\nduring the convulsion of 1832-'33, with that of James Buchanan, during our\r\npresent similar condition, we will give a brief summary of the course\r\npursued by the former:\r\n\r\nOn the 24th day of November, previous to the issuing of President\r\nJackson's proclamation, South Carolina had, through her convention,\r\neffectually declared herself out of the Union, by an ordinance that was to\r\ntake effect on the first day of February, 1833. The President, being\r\napprehensive of trouble in collecting the duties imposed by congress in\r\nthe various ports of South Carolina, and more especially at Charleston,\r\ndispatched, through his secretary of the treasury, Louis McLean,\r\nconfidential orders of the most strict and positive character, to the\r\ncollectors at the several ports of entry.\r\n\r\nHe writes to James K. Prinkle, Esq., collector at Charleston, ordering him\r\nto use the utmost firmness and vigilence in seeing the laws promptly\r\nexecuted in every particular. He ordered the revenue cutter Alert to\r\nproceed to Charleston, and, in writing to Mr. Prinkle, he says, you will,\r\nmoreover, cause the officers of the cutter (showing that there were others\r\nat hand), under your direction, to board all vessels departing from the\r\nport of Charleston, and in case any shall be found without having been\r\nregularly entered and cleared in the manner required by law, to seize and\r\ndetain the same, to be prosecuted according to law. The number of\r\nassistants and employees were greatly increased, and every precaution\r\ntaken to prevent a surprise. But as time rolled around South Carolina, not\r\nhaving penetrated the purposes of President Jackson sufficiently to\r\nunderstand his position, felt confident in her final success, and was\r\ndefiant in her attitude. She began to collect her army that was to defeat\r\nthe government of the United States. She had appealed to her sister States\r\nto aid her in sustaining her position. Dissatisfaction had already began\r\nto show itself in various other sections of the country. The President\r\nbeheld the dangers and felt the responsibility resting upon him, and on\r\nthe 10th day of December he issued his Proclamation, declaring his\r\nunalterable purpose to enforce the laws and collect the duties, and above\r\nall to stand by the Constitution and the Union to the last, and warning\r\nthose who were precipitating their country into a civil war to beware of\r\nthe consequences and fearful responsibility they would incur by a\r\ncontinuance in their reckless course.\r\n\r\nBut South Carolina had gone too far to be silenced by any ordinary means.\r\nShe continued her preparations, still hoping that she could spread\r\ndisaffection into other portions of the country sufficient to frighten the\r\ngovernment into granting her demands, and many of the true friends of the\r\nUnion trembled for its safety, so wide-spread was the sympathy South\r\nCarolina had enlisted. Many members of Congress were ready with their\r\nmeasures of pacification, each anxious to become the instrument of\r\nsettling the difficulty, and perhaps immortalize his name. The horrors of\r\ncivil war were as freely discussed as at the present day. Numerous were\r\nthose who were ready and willing to sacrifice everything, even the dignity\r\nof the nation, to avert the dreadful calamity. But where was the brave\r\nJackson? He was at the helm of the great ship of State, and although the\r\nstorm was raging, and the billows threatening to engulf her or dash her to\r\nfragments on the inhospitable shore of anarchy, yet the brave old hero,\r\nwith the Constitution for his guide and the God of liberty for his\r\ncounselor, bid defiance to the mutineers who were threateningly assembled\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of December he sent a special message to Congress asking\r\nfor additional legislation for the purpose of meeting the exigency, he\r\nreminding them of their sworn duty to protect the Constitution from every\r\nencroachment, and appealed to their patriotism, and urged them, as true\r\nAmericans, to stand firmly by their country. Congress promptly responded\r\nto the call, and the President thus prepared continued the collection of\r\ncustoms uninterruptedly, and preserved the honor and dignity of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, after much blustering and threatening, quieted down, and\r\nit is to be hoped that many of the leaders of the rebellion lived to see\r\nthe folly of their acts and the wisdom of the President.\r\n\r\nBut let us look for a moment at the course James Buchanan has pursued. It\r\nis now over a year since men occupying high places in the government began\r\nto publicly avow their determination to destroy this government and\r\ninvolve all in one common ruin. Public speeches and the press of the\r\ncountry have all proclaimed the determination of certain partain parties\r\nto break up this Union. Conventions have been held and resolutions passed\r\ndeclaring certain States out of the Union. Arsenals have been seized,\r\nforts have been taken by bodies of armed men, public property confiscated,\r\nand an unarmed steamer, bearing the flag of the nation, has been fired\r\ninto for attempting to comply with government orders--collectors of\r\ncustoms are arrested and tried for treason for performing their duty. The\r\nfree navigation of the Mississippi is prevented; American citizens are\r\ndriven out of several of the States while peaceably attending to their\r\nlegitimate business, and some of the more unfortunate have suffered\r\ntarring and feathering, whipping, scourging and even death at the hands of\r\nthose acting under authority, or at least within the knowledge of the\r\nauthorities of the several States; and yet, after all the enumerated\r\noutrages, sufficient to disgrace even the half-civilized nation of\r\nMorocco, not one word of unqualified rebuke has James Buchanan uttered\r\nagainst those committing these outrages, not only against our government\r\nbut the very name of humanity. Surrounded by treason in his own\r\ncabinet,[4] he has looked quietly on while his Secretary of War supplied\r\nthe insurgents with government arms. Open and defiant traitors have been\r\nhis daily counselors, while his imbecile, undecided course gives no one\r\nconfidence in his future policy. Treason is now openly and boldly\r\nperpetrated throughout at least one-third of the entire country without\r\nthe least restraint from any source whatever.\r\n\r\nIf there is to be found within the pages of history where the government\r\nof a great, powerful and prosperous nation suffered treason to spread over\r\none-third of the entire country, coupled with the open and revolting acts\r\nof violence that have characterized this rebellion, without the first\r\nattempt to check its destructive progress, it is not within the range of\r\nmy knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the grounds for argument to show that this government was\r\nestablished by the people collectively of the whole country, (and not by\r\nthe several States, as claimed by some,) and that it can only be\r\nrightfully altered or abolished by a constitutional majority of the same\r\npower that established it, would seem to have been entirely gone over,\r\nnevertheless we propose to introduce the additional evidence of that\r\nnoble, honored statesman, and able constitutional expounder, Daniel\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st day of January, 1830, Mr. Hayne delivered in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States a very able speech advocating the right of the various\r\nStates to nullify the laws of Congress in certain contingencies, or what\r\nmight be more properly called the South Carolina doctrine, embracing the\r\nright to nullify the laws of Congress, or declare herself out of the Union\r\nat pleasure. His speech was considered a complete succces by the\r\nadvocates of his sentiments, and was thought by them an unanswerable\r\nvindication of those principles, and when Mr. Webster undertook the task\r\nof replying to Mr. Hayne, he was met with jeers by the friends of\r\nnullication; but as the volume of his reasoning began to unfold itself,\r\nall eyes were attentively turned toward the speaker. After proceeding to\r\nstate the grounds upon which was founded the pretended right to nullify\r\nthe acts of Congress, Mr. Webster said:\r\n\r\n    \"This leads us to inquire into the origin of this government and the\r\n    source of its power. Whose agent is it? Is it the creature of the\r\n    State legislatures, or the creature of the people? If the government\r\n    of the United States be the agent of the State governments, then they\r\n    may control it, provided they can agree in the manner of controlling\r\n    it; if it is the agent of the people, then the people alone can\r\n    control it, restrain it, modify or reform it. It is observable enough,\r\n    that the doctrine for which the honorable gentleman contends leads him\r\n    to the necessity of maintaining, not only that this general government\r\n    is the creature of the States, but that it is the creature of each of\r\n    the States severally; so that each may assert the power, for itself,\r\n    of determining whether it acts within the limits of its authority. It\r\n    is the servant of four and twenty masters, of different wills and\r\n    purposes; and yet bound to obey all. This absurdity (for it seems no\r\n    less) arises from a misconception as to the origin of this government,\r\n    and its true character. It is, sir, the people's constitution, the\r\n    people's government; made for the people; made by the people; and\r\n    answerable to the people. The people of the United States have\r\n    declared that this constitution shall be the supreme law. We must\r\n    either admit the proposition, or dispute their authority. The States\r\n    are unquestionably sovereign, so far as their sovereignty is not\r\n    affected by this supreme law. The State legislatures, as political\r\n    bodies, however sovereign, are yet not sovereign over the people. So\r\n    far as the people have given power to the general government, so far\r\n    the grant is unquestionably good, and the government holds of the\r\n    people, and not of the State governments. We are all agents of the\r\n    same supreme power, the people. The general government and the State\r\n    governments derive their authority from the same source. Neither can,\r\n    in relation to the other, be called primary; though one is definite\r\n    and restricted, and the other general and residuary.\r\n\r\n    \"The national government possesses those powers which it can be shown\r\n    the people have conferred on it, and no more. All the rest belongs to\r\n    the State governments, or to the people themselves. So far as the\r\n    people have restrained State sovereignty by the expression of their\r\n    will, in the constitution of the United States, so far, it must be\r\n    admitted, State sovereignty is effectually controlled. I do not\r\n    contend that it is, or ought to be, controlled further. The sentiment\r\n    to which I have referred propounds that State sovereignty is only to\r\n    be controlled by its own 'feelings of justice;' that is to say, it is\r\n    not to be controlled at all; for one who is to follow his feelings, is\r\n    under no legal control. Now, however men may think this ought to be,\r\n    the fact is, that the people of the United States have chosen to\r\n    impose control on State sovereignties. The constitution has ordered\r\n    the matter differently from what this opinion announces. To make war,\r\n    for instance, is an exercise of sovereignty; but the constitution\r\n    declares that no State shall make war. To coin money is another\r\n    exercise of sovereign power; but no State is at liberty to coin money.\r\n    Again, the constitution says, that no sovereign State shall be so\r\n    sovereign as to make a treaty. These prohibitions, it must be\r\n    confessed, are a control on the State sovereignty of South Carolina,\r\n    as well as of the other States, which does not arise 'from feelings of\r\n    honorable justice.' Such an opinion, therefore, is in defiance of the\r\n    plainest provisions of the constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster proceeded to investigate the South Carolina doctrine as it was\r\nthen termed; he referred to the resolutions of Pennsylvania and Kentucky\r\ndeclaring the tariff laws constitutional, while in South Carolina the same\r\nlaws were declared to be a palpable, deliberate usurpation of power by\r\nCongress; and in speaking of the absurdity of allowing each State to\r\ndecide in such cases, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"If there be no power to settle such questions, independent of either\r\n    of the States, is not the whole Union a rope of sand? Are we not\r\n    thrown back again precisely upon the old confederation?\r\n\r\n    \"It is too plain to be argued. Four and twenty interpreters of\r\n    constitutional law, each with a power to decide for itself, and none\r\n    with authority to bind anybody else, and this constitutional law the\r\n    only bond of their union! What is such a state of things but a mere\r\n    connection during pleasure, or, to use the praseology of the times,\r\n    _during feeling_? And that feeling, too, not the feeling of the people\r\n    who established the constitution, but the feeling of the State\r\n    governments.\"\r\n\r\nIn referring to remarks made by Mr. Hayne, concerning what Mr. Hillhouse\r\nshould have said about not being bound to obey an unconstitutional law,\r\nMr. Webster says:\r\n\r\n    \"He quotes that distinguished senator as saying, that in his judgment\r\n    the embargo law was unconstitutional, and that, therefore, in his\r\n    opinion, the people were not bound to obey it.\r\n\r\n    \"That, sir, is perfectly constitutional language. As unconstitutional\r\n    law is not binding; _but then it does not rest with a resolution or a\r\n    law of a State legislature to decide whether an act of congress be or\r\n    be not constitutional_. An unconstitutional act of congress would not\r\n    bind the people of this District although they have no legislature to\r\n    interfere in their behalf; and, on the other hand, a constitutional\r\n    law of congress does bind the citizens of every State, although all\r\n    their legislatures should undertake to annul it, by act or resolution.\r\n    The venerable Connecticut senator is a constitutional lawyer, of sound\r\n    principles and enlarged knowledge; a statesman practiced and\r\n    experienced, bred in the company of Washington, and holding just views\r\n    upon the nature of our governments. He believed the embargo\r\n    unconstitutional, and so did others; but what then? Who did he suppose\r\n    was to decide that question? The State legislature? Certainly not. No\r\n    such sentiment ever escaped his lips.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster went on to ask from whence this supposed right of the States\r\ncame? Where did they get the power to interfere with the laws of the\r\nUnion? He contended that the notion was founded in a misapprehension of\r\nthe origin of this government and of the foundation on which it stands. I\r\nhold, said he, this to be a popular government, erected by the people,\r\nthose who administer it responsible to the people, and itself capable of\r\nbeing amended and modified just as the people may choose it should be.\r\n\r\n    \"It is as popular, just as truly emenating from the people, as the\r\n    State governments. It is created for one purpose; the State\r\n    governments for another. It has its own powers; they have theirs.\r\n    There is no more authority with them to arrest the operation of a law\r\n    of congress, than with congress to arrest the operation of their laws.\r\n    We are here to administer a constitution emenating immediately from\r\n    the people, and trusted by them to our administration. It is not the\r\n    creature of the State governments. It is of no moment to the argument\r\n    that certain acts of the State legislatures are necessary to fill our\r\n    seats in this body. That is not one of their original State powers, a\r\n    part of the sovereignty of the State. It is a duty which the people,\r\n    by the constitution itself, have imposed on the State legislatures,\r\n    and which they might have left to be performed elsewhere, if they had\r\n    seen fit. So they have left the choice of president with electors; but\r\n    all this does not affect the proposition that this whole\r\n    government--president, senate and house of representatives--is a\r\n    popular government. It leaves it still all its popular character. The\r\n    governor of a State (in some of the States) is chosen not directly by\r\n    the people for the purpose of performing, among other duties, that of\r\n    electing a governor. Is the government of the State on that account\r\n    not a popular government? This government, sir, is the independent\r\n    offspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State\r\n    legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people\r\n    brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported\r\n    it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary\r\n    restraints on State sovereignties. The States cannot now make war;\r\n    they cannot contract alliances; they cannot make, each for itself,\r\n    separate regulations of commerce; they cannot lay imposts; they cannot\r\n    coin money. If this constitution, sir, be the creature of State\r\n    legislatures, it must be admitted that it has obtained a strange\r\n    control over the volition of its creators.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster then proceeded to show that when the people erected this\r\ngovernment they gave it a Constitution, and in that Constitution they\r\nenumerated the powers which they bestowed on it. That they had made it a\r\nlimited government, and defined its authority and restrained it to the\r\nexercise of such powers as were granted, and all others were reserved to\r\nthe States or the people. But they did not stop there, being aware that no\r\nConstitution could be so plainly written but what there would be a\r\ndifference of opinion on the construction of some points, consequently\r\nthey (the people) in order to avoid a recurrence of the difficulties\r\nexperienced under the old confederacy and render the laws of Congress\r\neffective and binding upon all parties without applying to State\r\nauthority, thus rendering the government complete within itself, declared\r\nthe Constitution and the laws of the United States, made in pursuance\r\nthereof, should be the supreme law of the land. In referring to the\r\ntribunal in which to decide questions arising under the Constitution, Mr.\r\nWebster said:\r\n\r\n    \"But, sir, the people have wisely provided, in the constitution\r\n    itself, a proper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of\r\n    constitutional law. There are, in the constitution, grants of powers\r\n    to congress, and restrictions on those powers. There are also\r\n    prohibitions on the States. Some authority must therefore necessarily\r\n    exist, having the ultimate jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the\r\n    interpretation of these grants, restrictions, and prohibitions. The\r\n    constitution has itself pointed out, ordained, and established that\r\n    authority. How has it accomplished this great and essential end? By\r\n    declaring, sir, that '_the constitution and the laws of the United\r\n    States, made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the\r\n    land, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\r\n    contrary notwithstanding_.'\r\n\r\n    \"This, sir, was the first great step. By this, the supremacy of the\r\n    constitution and laws of the United States is declared. The people so\r\n    will it. No State law is to be valid which comes in conflict with the\r\n    constitution or any law of the United States. But who shall decide\r\n    this question of interference? To whom lies the last appeal? This,\r\n    sir, the constitution itself decides also, by declaring '_that the\r\n    judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the\r\n    constitution and laws of the United States_.' These two provisions,\r\n    sir, cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of the\r\n    arch. With these it is a government; without them it is a confederacy.\r\n    In pursuance of these clear and express provisions, congress\r\n    established, at its very first session, in the judicial act, a mode\r\n    for carrying them into full effect, and for bringing all questions of\r\n    constitutional power to the final decision of the supreme court. It\r\n    then, sir, became a government. It then had the means of\r\n    self-protection; and but for this, it would, in all probability, have\r\n    been now among things which are passed. Having constituted the\r\n    government, and declared its powers, the people have further said,\r\n    that since somebody must decide on the extent of these powers, the\r\n    government shall itself decide--subject always like other popular\r\n    governments, to its responsibility to the people. And now, sir, I\r\n    repeat, how is it that a State legislature acquires any right to\r\n    interfere? Who, or what, gives them the right to say to the people,\r\n    'We, who are your agents and servants for one purpose, will undertake\r\n    to decide, that your other agents and servants, appointed by you for\r\n    another purpose, have transcended the authority you gave them?' The\r\n    reply would be, I think, not impertinent, 'Who made you a judge over\r\n    another's servants. To their own masters they stand or fall.'\"\r\n\r\nHe then went on to show that a State could not make treason against the\r\nUnited States legal, and, says he, when I maintain these sentiments, I am\r\nbut asserting the rights of the people; I state what they have declared\r\nand insisted on as their right to declare it. They have chosen to repose\r\nthis power in the general government, and I think it my duty to support it\r\nlike other Constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the importance of having but one tribunal, whose decisions\r\nshould be final--Sir, said he:\r\n\r\n    \"If we look to the general nature of the case, could any thing have\r\n    been more preposterous than to have made a government for the whole\r\n    Union, and yet left its powers subject, not to one interpretation, but\r\n    to thirteen or twenty-four interpretations? Instead of one tribunal,\r\n    established by all, responsible to all, with power to decide for all,\r\n    shall constitutional questions be left to four and twenty popular\r\n    bodies, each at liberty to decide for itself, and none bound to\r\n    respect the decisions of others; and each at liberty, too, to give a\r\n    new construction, on every new election of its own members? Would any\r\n    thing, with such a principle in it, or rather with such a destitution\r\n    of all principle, be fit to be called a government? No, sir. It should\r\n    not be denominated a constitution. It should be called, rather, a\r\n    collection of topics for everlasting controversy; heads of debate for\r\n    a disputatious people. It would not be a government. It would not be\r\n    adequate to any practical good, nor fit for any people to live under.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne, already overborne with the overwhelming and unanswerable\r\narguments, was yet destined to receive the most cutting rebuke from his\r\nvanquisher. Mr. Webster said:\r\n\r\n    \"And now, Mr. President, let me run the honorable gentleman's doctrine\r\n    a little into its practical application. Let us look at his probable\r\n    _modus operandi_. If a thing can be done, an ingenious man can tell\r\n    _how_ it is to be done. Now, I wish to be informed _how_ this State\r\n    interference is to be put in practice. We will take the existing case\r\n    of the tariff law. South Carolina is said to have made up her opinion\r\n    upon it. If we do not repeal it, (as probably we shall not,) she will\r\n    then apply to the case the remedy of her doctrine. She will, we must\r\n    suppose, pass a law of her legislature, declaring the several acts of\r\n    congress, usually called the tariff laws, null and void, so far as\r\n    they respect South Carolina, or the citizens thereof. So far, all is a\r\n    paper transaction, and easy enough. But the collector at Charleston is\r\n    collecting the duties imposed by these tariff laws--he, therefore,\r\n    must be stopped. The collector will sieze the goods if the tariff\r\n    duties are not paid. The State authorities will undertake their\r\n    rescue: the marshal, with his posse, will come to the collector's aid;\r\n    and here the contest begins. The militia of the State will be called\r\n    out to sustain the nullifying act. They will march, sir, under a very\r\n    gallant leader; for I believe the honorable member himself commands\r\n    the militia of that part of the State. He will raise the _nullifying\r\n    act_ on his standard, and spread it out as his banner. It will have a\r\n    preamble, bearing that the tariff laws are palpable, deliberate, and\r\n    dangerous violations of the constitution. He will proceed, with his\r\n    banner flying, to the custom house in Charleston--\r\n\r\n                        \"all the while\r\n        Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.\"\r\n\r\n    Arrived at the custom house, he will tell the collector that he must\r\n    collect no more duties under any of the tariff laws. This he will be\r\n    somewhat puzzled to say, by the way, with a grave countenance,\r\n    considering what hand South Carolina herself had in that of 1816. But,\r\n    sir, the collector would, probably, not desist at his bidding. Here\r\n    would ensue a pause; for they say, that a certain stillness precedes\r\n    the tempest. Before this military array should fall on custom house,\r\n    collector, clerks, and all, it is very probable some of those\r\n    composing it would request of their gallant commander-in-chief to be\r\n    informed a little upon the point of law; for they have doubtless a\r\n    just respect for his opinions as a lawyer, as well as for his bravery\r\n    as a soldier. They know he has read Blackstone and the constitution,\r\n    as well as Turenne and Vauban. They would ask him, therefore,\r\n    something concerning their rights in this matter. They would inquire\r\n    whether it was not somewhat dangerous to resist a law of the United\r\n    States. What would be the nature of their offence, they would wish to\r\n    learn, if they, by military force and array, resisted the execution\r\n    in Carolina of a law of the United States, and it should turn out,\r\n    after all, that the law _was constitutional_. He would answer, of\r\n    course, treason. No lawyer could give any other reason. John Fries,[5]\r\n    he would tell them, had learned that some years ago. How, then, they\r\n    would ask, do you propose to defend us? We are not afraid of bullets,\r\n    but treason has a way of taking people off that we do not much relish.\r\n    How do you propose to defend us? 'Look at my floating banner,' he\r\n    would reply; 'see there the _nullifying law_!' Is it your opinion,\r\n    gallant commander, they would then say, that if we should be indicted\r\n    for treason, that some floating banner of yours would make a good plea\r\n    in bar? 'South Carolina is a sovereign State,' he would reply. That is\r\n    true; but would the judge admit our plea? 'These tariff laws,' he\r\n    would repeat, 'are unconstitutional, palpably, deliberately,\r\n    dangerously.' That all may be so; but if the tribunals should not\r\n    happen to be of that opinion, shall we swing for it? We are ready to\r\n    die for our country, but it is rather an awkward business, this dying\r\n    without touching the ground. After all, this is a sort of _hemp_-tax,\r\n    worse than any part of the tariff.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. President, the honorable gentleman would be in a dilemma like\r\n    that of another great general. He would have a knot before him which\r\n    he could not untie. He must cut it with his sword. He must say to his\r\n    followers, defend yourselves with your bayonets; and this is\r\n    war--civil war.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster continued to show that to resist by force the execution of a\r\nlaw of the United States was treason, and that the Courts of the United\r\nStates could take no notice of a State law to authorize persons to commit\r\nthat grave crime. Said he, the common saying that a State cannot commit\r\ntreason herself, is nothing to the purpose. Can it authorize others to do\r\nso? If John Fries[5] had produced an act of Pennsylvania annulling the\r\nlaw of Congress, would it have helped his case? Talk about it as we will,\r\nthese doctrines go the whole length of revolution. They are incompatible\r\nwith any peaceable administration of the government. They lead directly to\r\ndisunion and civil commotion, and therefore it is, that at the\r\ncommencement, when they are first found to be maintained by respectable\r\nmen, and in a tangible form, that I enter my protest against them all. Mr\r\nWebster proceeded to show that the people of the United States have not\r\nchosen the State authorities as their guardians against encroachments from\r\nthe general government. Said he:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir, the people have not trusted their safety, in regard to the\r\n    general constitution, to these hands. They have required other\r\n    security, and taken other bonds. They have chosen to trust themselves,\r\n    first to the plain words of the instrument, and to such construction\r\n    as the government, itself, in doubtful cases, should put on its own\r\n    powers, under their oaths of office, and subject to their\r\n    responsibility to them; just as the people of a State trust their own\r\n    State governments with a similar power. Secondly, they have reposed\r\n    their trust in the efficacy of frequent elections, and in their own\r\n    power to remove their own servants and agents, whenever they see\r\n    cause. Thirdly, they have reposed trust in the judicial power, which,\r\n    in order that it might be trustworthy, they have made as respectable,\r\n    as disinterested, and as independent as practicable. Fourthly, they\r\n    have seen fit to rely, in case of necessity, or high expediency, on\r\n    their known and admitted power to alter or amend the constitution,\r\n    peaceably and quietly, whenever experience shall point out defects or\r\n    imperfections. And finally, the people of the United States have at\r\n    no time, in no way, directly or indirectly, authorized any State\r\n    legislature to construe or interpret _their_ instrument of government;\r\n    much less to interfere, by their own power, to arrest its course and\r\n    operation.\r\n\r\n    \"If, sir, the people in these respects had done otherwise than they\r\n    have done their constitution could neither have been preserved nor\r\n    would it have been worth preserving. And if its plain provisions shall\r\n    now be disregarded, and these new doctrines interpolated in it, it\r\n    will become as feeble and helpless a being as enemies, whether early\r\n    or more recent, could possibly desire. It will exist, in every State,\r\n    but as a poor dependent on State permission. It must borrow leave to\r\n    be, and will be no longer than State pleasure, or State discretion\r\n    sees fit to grant the indulgence and to prolong its poor existence.\r\n\r\n    \"But, sir, although there are fears, there are hopes also. The people\r\n    have preserved this their own chosen Constitution for forty years, and\r\n    seen their happiness, prosperity and renown grow with its growth, and\r\n    strengthen with its strength. They are now generally strongly attached\r\n    to it. Overthrown by direct assault, it cannot be; evaded, undermined,\r\n    _nullified_ it will not be, if we and those who succeed us here, as\r\n    agents and representatives of the people shall conscientiously and\r\n    vigilantly discharge the two great branches of our public trust\r\n    faithfully to preserve and wisely to administer it.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe that after perusing the evidence already advanced, every\r\nreasonable, unprejudiced person must come to the conclusion that the\r\nfathers of our country established the government of the United States\r\nwith the full understanding and intent that it should be supreme, so far\r\nas its delegated authority extended. That it was a unit and capable of\r\nsustaining itself by force, if necessary. Mr. Madison's views are\r\nrepeatedly expressed on this point, explaining the advantages of\r\nconferring sufficient powers upon the general government to enable it to\r\nsuppress internal violence and insurrection, thus providing against the\r\ncivil commotion that had overthrown other republics of a weaker and less\r\nbinding obligation on the part of the members composing them. See pages\r\n24, 25 and 26 of this book. The papers here referred to are the more\r\nimportant on account of being written while the question of adoption or\r\nrejection of the Constitution was being discussed before the people.\r\nAgain, on pages 30 to 32, the defects and imperfections of the old\r\nconfederation in relation to the principles of legislation for the States\r\nin their collective capacities, showing more fully that the intention was\r\nto create a _government for the people of the United States_ that should\r\nbe binding on all persons, or combination of persons, for all time to\r\ncome. And again, on page 34, is another quotation from the joint\r\nproduction of Madison, Jay and Hamilton, showing that the government was\r\nexpected to reach individuals without the aid, and independent of, State\r\nauthority. And still another quotation, on pages 35 and 36, goes to show\r\nthat there was a full understanding that the people were conferring\r\ncertain powers upon the general government, and of course taking them from\r\nthe States for the purpose of forming one great, inseparable and\r\nindissoluble nation. There is not a particle of evidence to prove that the\r\npeople contemplated reserving or recognizing any State distinction or\r\nState sovereignty, so far as the powers of the general government were\r\nconcerned; but the whole drift of evidence goes to show that they were\r\nconscious of the necessity of uniting themselves under one grand\r\ngovernment, making themselves one people, reserving only to the States or\r\nthemselves such powers as were thought necessary to regulate their local\r\naffairs, leaving the States in nearly the same relation to the general\r\ngovernment that a city municipality is to the government of the State in\r\nwhich it is located; but all must owe obedience to the government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all the evidence we have on this subject. As we review the\r\nhistory of the government, we find that Washington, Jackson, Webster,\r\nClay, and in fact nearly every statesman of any prominence in our\r\npolitical history have either by their acts or words committed themselves\r\nto this same policy. The proclamation of General Jackson, and the extracts\r\ngiven of Mr. Webster's arguments, are the key-stone to the arch; they are\r\nboth conclusive in themselves, and comment by me would be but a weak\r\nadvocate of their masterly and unanswerable arguments, hence I close the\r\nsubject, conscious of having proven to the satisfaction of myself at\r\nleast, and, I trust, to some of my doubting Democratic friends and\r\nweak-hearted Republican brethren, that we at least have a government,\r\nestablished by our forefathers, constituting us one nation, one people,\r\nwith one common country and destiny. Whether we shall be found brave\r\nenough to defend it and perpetuate it is a question which the God of\r\nnations only knows, and time alone will reveal to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nShall this Union he maintained, or shall it be dissolved? are questions\r\nthat are the all absorbing topics of conversation amongst all classes of\r\npeople, through the length and breadth of our entire country. There seems\r\nto be a great lack of firmness and decision at this time, in relation to\r\nthe proper course to be pursued in view of the momentous question now\r\nabout to be presented, discussed and decided upon by the American people.\r\n\r\nWhile true men are thus dumfounded and amazed; I might say silenced with\r\nalmost a paralyzing astonishment at the daring and rapid movements of the\r\ninternal enemies to our country; the eyes of the civilized world are\r\nturned towards us, and every true friend of liberty and human progression\r\nis awaiting our decision upon this grave question, with an almost\r\nbreathless suspense. In view of this state of things, what course shall we\r\npursue in order to acquit ourselves honarably and preserve our nation from\r\nthe ruin that seems threatening to blot out the only guarantee that there\r\nis such a government as \"The United States?\" There can be but one answer\r\nto this from every true American patriot, and that is, that every attempt\r\nto break up this government, let it come from few or many, will be met, be\r\nthe consequences what they may. The _integrity_ of this Union must and\r\nshall be maintained, should be the watch-word of every man, woman and\r\nchild that values the blessing of liberty under which we have prospered as\r\nindividuals and as a nation. It is contended by some that it is better to\r\nallow those States that choose to secede to go in peace than to enter into\r\na civil war, the end of which no man can foretell. This would look very\r\nplausible were it not that there is a principle at stake which is at the\r\nvery foundation of every Democratic government, and without the\r\nmaintenance of this vital principle self-government is but a farce and a\r\ndeception. And what is this principle? Why it is nothing more nor less\r\nthan compelling the minority to submit to the constitutional acts of the\r\nmajority. Now, who will pretend that a Democratic government can be\r\nsustained without this principle is both recognized and, if necessary,\r\nenforced?\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who think that the question of slavery is the great\r\nand only cause of our present troubles; far from it, you may banish every\r\nvestige of slavery from our country, and other differences of opinion will\r\nrise up, and cause other disputes equally as difficult to settle. Nor is\r\nthe extent of our country, or the variety of the climate to be charged\r\nwith our difficulties, for even in our city and State elections we find\r\nthere is a wide difference of opinion, which results in crimination and\r\nrecrimination. The same will be found in the various school districts and\r\nin many of the churches. Where ever there is a government there must and\r\nwill be a difference of opinion. It is not to be expected that we will all\r\nagree in relation to the various schemes that are presented from time to\r\ntime for our consideration. But shall we revolt and overthrow the\r\ngovernment because our pet scheme is defeated? If not, then should we\r\nallow others to involve us in one common ruin because of their defeat?\r\nThere would be no end to this rebellious spirit if the obligation to\r\nsubmit to a constitutional election was removed. What would be the result\r\nof giving way to those who are now threatening our peace? Would not every\r\nother community have the same right; and we having once granted the right\r\nby allowing a portion of the nation to set up an independent government,\r\nhow could we in justice punish those who choose to go and do likewise?\r\nState governments will have the same difficulty to contend against that\r\nthe United States have now, and instead of strength and prosperity we will\r\nbe weak and divided and without honor at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nI think that every sane man will agree with me when I say that it is much\r\nbetter to meet on one grand battle field and settle this question at once\r\nthan to dodge the responsibility for the present, only to allow dissention\r\nto spread broad cast over the land. When this great nation has been torn\r\ninto fragments by this ranting, ungovernable spirit, we, or our children,\r\nwill have to enforce this great principle, that some of our best meaning\r\nfriends are willing to abandon for the sake of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF A WAR TO SUSTAIN OUR GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a war to sustain our government would be to plant the seed\r\nof true patriotism in the breast of every law-abiding and liberty-loving\r\ncitizen of America. We should be able to contrast the two extremes of our\r\nunheard of prosperity and the miseries and horrors of civil war--which of\r\nitself would do much towards insuring peace for centuries to come. Let\r\nthose who expect that we love peace so well, or dread war so much as to\r\nallow them to bid defiance to all laws, learn that they are mistaken; that\r\nwe are not the degenerate sons of a noble ancestry, but knowing our rights\r\nand loving our country, we are determined to defend them against every\r\nencroachment, and we will hear no more threats about disunion or rebellion\r\nin consequence of a political defeat. We shall then have established\r\nbeyond a controversy that the minority must and shall submit to the\r\nconstitutional acts of the majority. We will then have established in the\r\nminds of the civilized world that our government is not one of straw, but\r\nthat it is not only capable of vindicating its honor in defiance of\r\nforeign foes, but it is equally able to chastise those who rebel against\r\nits authority at home. War would be to our political system, what the\r\nthunderstorm is to the atmosphere. Its purifying influences would be\r\nmanifested by inspiring new life, vigor and purity into everything that\r\nsurrounds us. Political demagogues will be cast aside as unfit for public\r\nconfidence, and better and more patriotic men will spring up from among\r\nthe masses who will have before them the history of the troubles through\r\nwhich their country has passed as lesson and a warning to shun a like\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore shown ourselves to be equal to our undertakings, and\r\nnow when the great crisis in our national affairs is at hand, and the eyes\r\nof the friends of liberty throughout the civilized world are gazing upon\r\nus with the deepest anxiety, shall we be found unworthy of the liberties\r\nwe enjoy? Should we be found unfaithful to the trust imposed on us by our\r\nforefathers? We would be the just object of scorn and contempt, and the\r\nhistorian who shall undertake the task of writing the true history of the\r\nrise and fall of the American government, will have the painful duty of\r\ndrawing the contrast between the noble and patriotic heroes who\r\nestablished it, and the cowardly, selfish and unprincipled traitors who\r\nbecame its destroyers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALL THE PEOPLE RULE?\r\n\r\nThis question is frequently asked by those who are encouraging the\r\nSouthern rebellion. I answer, most emphatically, in the affirmative. But\r\nlet us see who the people are. It is plain that the people of a State are\r\nnot those of one or more of the counties, unless the people of those\r\ncounties are a majority of all the people in the State. Now the\r\nConstitution of the United States comes from the people of all the States,\r\nconsequently it will be perceived that they alone and not the people of\r\none State have the right to alter or abolish it. As well might the people\r\nof Indianapolis declare the Constitution of the State of Indiana null and\r\nvoid, as for the people of one State to declare this Union dissolved. It\r\nis true that men talk about \"States' rights,\" \"the equality of the\r\nStates,\" and in fact invent every manner of argument for the purpose of\r\nshielding those who are committing treason against the government of the\r\nUnited States, but where is the clause of the constitution that discloses\r\nany such sentiments? There is none, but on the other hand we find the most\r\npositive proof that the framers of that article intended that we should be\r\none great nation, and to secure us against the liability of sudden and\r\nunnecessary changes they provided that in order to amend the constitution\r\nthe consent of three-fourths of all the States were necessary, hence it\r\nwill be perceived that a simple majority of the people of the United\r\nStates could not amend the constitution, much less declare it null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nIn view of this wise provision so necessary to secure stability to our\r\ngovernment, how rediculous it is to talk about a single State declaring\r\nthis Union dissolved against the well-known wish of four-fifths of all the\r\npeople of our entire country. The thing is absurd in the extreme and\r\nshould not be entertained for a moment, for such a principle once\r\nestablished would be the end of all constitutional governments. But\r\nsuppose we grant the independence of such States as choose to withdraw\r\nfrom the Union. In order to do this we must amend the constitution so as\r\nto empower Congress to act upon the matter, and until then, every member\r\nof Congress is bound to stand by the constitution as it is, for there is\r\nno power granted them to treat with a portion of this nation as an\r\nindependent sovereign power. The framers of the Constitution did not grant\r\nCongress any more than a State the right to dismember or dissolve the\r\nUnion. And who would for a moment consent to the assumption of such\r\nextraordinary and important authority by those who were sent to Washington\r\nto support the very constitution which they are now called upon to\r\ndisregard and destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD THE PEOPLE DO TO AVERT THE THREATENING STORM?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best way to stop this disunion and treasonable clamor,\r\nis for all friends of the Union to come out and call meetings, and pass\r\nresolutions such as are appropriate for the times, telling our enemies\r\nthat it was for this Union our fathers fought, bled and died, and we will\r\ndo (if necessary) as our fathers did. Let there be but one sentiment, and\r\nthe unbroken ranks of eighteen millions of freemen will do more to silence\r\ntreason than all the constitutional amendments that could be prepared by\r\ntwice the number of pacificators that are now offering their services to\r\ninduce the government to meet the traitors on what is termed \"middle\r\nground.\" It is this continued wavering and uncertain position of the\r\npeople that give those who are plotting our destruction such full and\r\nperfect confidence in their final success. Few men could be found who\r\nwould enter the enemies ranks, if the certainty of being dealt with\r\naccording to the laws of our country was before them. The boasted bravery\r\nof those chivalrous gentlemen who are now firing the hearts of the\r\nignorant with bitter hatred against the noblest government on earth, would\r\nhesitate, reflect, and recoil at the sight of the hangman and the gallows.\r\nI question not their bravery, neither do I doubt their determination, but\r\nwith the certainty of defeat before them, would they strike the fatal\r\nblow? Every sane man is apt to count the chances of success when he enters\r\nupon any very important undertaking, and if there is nothing before him\r\nbut humiliation and defeat, where is the man who would be found fool hardy\r\nenough to risk his life in such a hopeless enterprise? They are few and\r\nfar between. We are told that unless the nation gives way to these\r\ntraitors, that the war that will ensue will be the most bloody and\r\ndesperate ever known to civilized man. There is no doubt but they will\r\nfight, but will they be found any more brave and determined in destroying\r\nthan we will be in maintaining our glorious country? I presume not. Then\r\nwe can easily discover the character of the war by deciding upon the\r\ncourse we would pursue in such a contingency. This talk about such a war\r\nbeing any worse than other wars, is a mere bugbear, sent out to frighten\r\nthe timid into submission, and the less notice there is taken of it, the\r\nmore unfrequent will it be referred to. It is a noticeable fact, that\r\nthose who are bringing about this great calamity are the very ones who are\r\npicturing to our visions the horrible consequences that would result from\r\nan effort to stop their career. Can impudence go further? Could Arnold\r\nhave done more to have accomplished his base and ignoble purpose?\r\n\r\nThen let the friends of our country rally under its banner, and then and\r\nthere resolve anew to stand by this Union as the only safety for our\r\npeace, our prosperity, and our liberties. There should be no partizan\r\nprejudice, for it is not the question who shall rule the country, but\r\nwhether we shall have a country to rule. We all have a common interest in\r\npreserving this government, and none should wait for this or that\r\npolitician, for they are all waiting to see the determination of the\r\npeople before they will take a very decided stand. Nor can the\r\npoliticians alone save our country. Far from it. They are the parties who\r\naided in bringing about our present political troubles which are\r\nthreatening to involve us in a deadly contest to save our country from\r\ndissolution. As well might you prescribe arsenic and expect it to cure a\r\npatient who was threatened with death from the excessive use of that\r\npoisonous drug, as to look to the politicians to restore peace and\r\nprosperity to our distracted country.\r\n\r\nSince it is the people that must save our country, if saved at all, let\r\nthere be unanimity, firmness and decision upon the all important question\r\nof preserving the Union; not if we can carry out our pet scheme; not if\r\nSouth Carolina is willing. Neither should we make any other condition, but\r\nresolve unalterably to stand by the constitution and the laws to the end,\r\nand never for one moment think of abandoning our undertaking, until this\r\nnoble object shall have been accomplished. It is a duty that we owe to\r\nourselves, to our homes and firesides, to the friends of freedom\r\nthroughout the civilized world, to those who are plotting treason against\r\nour government, and to the God of liberty, that we should speak out\r\nplainly and to the point, and warn those who are expecting such an easy\r\nvictory, that they are sadly and seriously mistaken; that we are not, as\r\nhas been represented to them, divided, but we are as one man for our\r\ncountry, unconditionally and unalterably, and though we may differ in\r\nrelation to the policy of conducting the great ship of state, yet we will\r\nnot abandon her, nor allow others to commit depredations against her. The\r\npeople of this great nation will never consent to a peaceable distruction\r\nof this noble fabric. Never! never! no, never! Then should we not warn\r\nthose who are expecting an easy victory, against the awful consequences of\r\na persistence in their destructive policy? By our silence we encourage\r\nthem, by our inactivity we strengthen them, and by our indecision we give\r\nthem confidence. The policy to be pursued should be distinctly laid down\r\nand presented to them. They have been deceived and encouraged with the\r\nprospect of success by the course we have pursued, and should war become\r\nnecessary in order to enforce the laws, we are culpable, in a measure, for\r\nnot showing more firmness at an earlier period. There is no room to doubt\r\ntheir determination to bid defiance to the constitution and the laws of\r\nthe land, and nothing short of a show of the ability and the determination\r\nto stand by our country, will induce them to desist. It may now be too\r\nlate to avoid bloodshed, but the sooner the remedy the less severe will be\r\nthe calamity.\r\n\r\nWe are told that to stir this matter up at the north will only excite and\r\nspread the feeling of dissatisfaction more swiftly over the land, but the\r\ntime has come when, to my mind, we must prepare to decide between our\r\nnational existence or non-existence. And should we be afraid of offending\r\nthe enemies of our country? Those who would turn against the government,\r\nprovided their peculiar notions in relation to some particular question is\r\nrejected, are against the whole spirit of a democratic government, and\r\nwill be found against us in the end, and we may as well count them there\r\nfirst as last. A submission to their dictation would be to yield the reins\r\nof government into the hands of those who are determined to either rule or\r\nruin, which must evidently result in the latter.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the bearing of this rule or ruin policy, and see where it\r\nwould end, provided we give way to those who choose to adopt it. I know of\r\nno better example, to test its destructiveness, than the one presented to\r\nus in the present unsettled condition of our country. The people have\r\nelected a President and Vice President in strict conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the constitution, made and provided for that purpose. Of\r\nthis there is no dispute. There is no use in talking about the issue being\r\nsectional, for every person who was legally entitled to vote for President\r\nand Vice President of the United States, and who concurred with the\r\nsentiments of the party, was invited to take part in the election. There\r\nwas no distinction between North and South in this matter, and the plea\r\nset forth that there was no support from one-half of the country, does not\r\nalter the case, especially since it is well known that the political\r\nopponents of Mr. Lincoln would not allow the free discussion of the\r\nvarious issues presented to the people for their consideration. Had this\r\ncourse been pursued in the North, there would not have been a\r\nBreckenridge party in many of the Northern States. It will be perceived,\r\nthat owing to this intolerant spirit exhibited in some portions of the\r\nSouth, Mr. Lincoln's views were not, and could not be presented to the\r\npeople for their consideration, which is in itself entirely inconsistent\r\nwith the spirit of a free government, as well as a violation of the\r\nconstitution and laws of our country. But who was to blame for this spirit\r\nof mobocracy? Was it Mr. Lincoln or his friends? Nothing but a bigoted\r\nblindness could lead any reasonable and well informed man to an\r\naffirmative conclusion. The simple fact that Mr. Yancey, the leader of the\r\nmost ultra opponents of the Republicans, was allowed to advocate his views\r\nall over the North without molestation or even insult, proves to the\r\ncontrary. But we are told that the Republican principles are contrary to\r\nSouthern interests. What if they are? Is that a reason why the right of\r\nfree discussion should be blotted out of existence? The principles of Mr.\r\nYancey are thought by a large majority of the people of the free States,\r\nto be _decidedly_ against the interest of the whole country.\r\n\r\nBut did they propose to destroy this government if Mr. Breckenridge was\r\nelected? Did they insult him, or drive him from the country as a felon?\r\nNo, he was kindly treated and listened to. The people, however, did not\r\nconclude to vote his principles, and for this they are treated as\r\ncriminals of the deepest dye. _Comment is unnecessary._ But supposing Mr.\r\nBreckenridge had been elected, and Massachusetts had placed herself in the\r\nunenviable position that South Carolina has assumed, where is the\r\nstatesman who would have advocated the justice of her position, or her\r\nright to secede, and thereby break up this government, unless Mr.\r\nBreckenridge would renounce his doctrine, and propose a change in the\r\nconstitution recognizing the Republican principles, and who would be found\r\nwilling to compromise the honor and dignity of the government by conceding\r\nto such demands? If any there be who would lend their aid to such a\r\nscheme, they are mere political demagogues without honor, and are not\r\nentitled to the confidence of the people. In this, I presume, nearly every\r\nperson will agree with me. Still, when we turn to the South, there seems\r\nto be some diversity of opinion in relation to what course should be\r\npursued. Now, why this difference? Can it be charged to anything but\r\npolitical prejudices? True patriotism never begets such inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nNow it is plain that if any party make it a condition that they must be\r\nallowed to control this government, in order to allow us to live in peace,\r\nthen that party, above all things, should not be allowed such control. The\r\nmere demand shows the incompetency of such party to occupy such an\r\nimportant position in our national affairs. Suppose we should grant the\r\npresent request. Are we prepared to grant the next that may be made at any\r\nfuture time? If so, tell me, if you please, when and where you will be\r\nwilling to make a stand for the vindication of our constitutional rights?\r\nAre we to give way to one demand after another until we have transferred\r\nall the rights which we now possess to this rule or ruin party?\r\n\r\nIt is contended by some that, by allowing those States which desire to\r\nsecede from this Union, to go without opposition, it will insure us peace,\r\nand at the same time remove the slave question from congress, and,\r\nthereby, our political troubles are at an end. Happy man is he who can\r\nimagine such a political millennium so near at hand, and so easily to be\r\nobtained. I would ask whether other questions may not come up that will\r\ndivide the people, and cause the same bitter feeling that now distracts\r\nthe whole country when another section will demand a separation from the\r\nremaining States; and whether they will not have the same right that we\r\nare now called upon to grant to the Cotton States? It is plain to me that\r\nif this policy, of allowing any State to secede that can raise a pretext\r\nfor doing so, is to be adopted, we will soon have no government at all;\r\nbut in the place of this law-abiding and liberty loving community, where\r\npeace, plenty and prosperity has smiled upon us so many happy years,\r\nanarchy will reign, with all its blasting and withering influences, laying\r\nwaste our brightest hopes, and casting a gloom and dispair over everything\r\nthat has heretofore been the pride of every true American citizen. We are\r\nnow called upon to consent to divide this nation under the penalty of\r\ncivil war; the horrors of which we all deeply deplore, and are willing to\r\nprevent by all reasonable measures. But, can we grant what is asked\r\nwithout establishing a precedent that will lead to further demands, and a\r\nconsequent sub-division, and, in fact, division after division until this\r\nglorious and prosperous country shall be (instead of one great, powerful\r\nand honored nation,) thirty-three petty contending States, each striving\r\nto get the advantage of the other? It is contended by some that, by making\r\nconcessions, both war and dissolution can be prevented. But, let us look\r\nat their character, and the circumstances under which they are demanded,\r\nand see whether such results, under existing circumstances, are likely to\r\nbe realized.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have just cast their votes in accordance\r\nwith the usages and customs heretofore adopted, as well as in perfect\r\nconformity with their constitutional rights, and, as usual in such cases,\r\nthere has been more than one party. The result has been that one party\r\nelected their choice, while the others were necessarily unsuccessful; and\r\ninstead of submitting, like true patriots, peaceably to the constitutional\r\nacts of the people, a portion of the defeated party demand of those who\r\nhave, by their numbers, carried the election, the surrender of their\r\nprinciples. This is the basis of the compromise that the freemen of this\r\nnation are unblushingly asked to make. But, upon inquiry as to whether\r\nsaid conditional rebels (for they are nothing else) are willing to aid in\r\nsuppressing the more ultra and unconditional rebels of such States that\r\nhave already declared themselves out of the Union, we find them bitterly\r\nopposed to everything that tends to show the supremacy of the laws over\r\nthis traitorous secession dogma; and our candid opinion is, that every\r\nindividual who places himself upon this platform, is contemplating a deep\r\nlaid scheme for the purpose of obtaining all the public territory they\r\npossibly can for the institution of slavery, and then withdraw from the\r\nUnion with their booty. Ask them if they are willing to submit in case the\r\npeople reject their demands, and the answer is, no, they will die first.\r\nThus the ultimatum is presented to us to either surrender our principles,\r\nour country, or fight to sustain it. Fellow-countrymen we need not ask you\r\nwhich you will do.\r\n\r\nLet us sift this unparalleled scheme of impudence and see whether it is\r\ngoing to be productive of permanent good to any one except to those who\r\nare desirous of involving us in anarchy and ruin.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Republicans should abandon their principles, which seem to\r\nbe the terms upon which peace is offered, and, in 1864, the Democrats\r\nshould succeed in electing the President upon the slave-extension\r\nplatform, and the Republicans, feeling that their interests were likely to\r\nbe trampled upon by the dominant party, should say to the Democracy that,\r\nunless said Democrats would abandon the principles of their party, and\r\nsecure the Republicans against the exercise of their principles in the\r\nfuture, by an amendment to the constitution itself, they (the Republicans)\r\nwould dissolve this Union? It will be observed that, if one party has the\r\nright to demand concessions, the other party has the same right,\r\nconsequently it would not be the majority that would rule, but the\r\nminority. Neither have we any guarantee that, by granting the present\r\ndemands, that other and still more absurd and threatening demands will not\r\nbe made. We are now called upon to incorporate into the constitution\r\ncertain additional rights and privileges for slavery; and what is the\r\nthreatened penalty that is offered to the freemen of this nation if they\r\nfail to grant what is demanded? Why it is nothing less than a complete\r\noverthrow and destruction of this government--and yet the Republicans are\r\ntaunted with the charge of being the cause of all the consequences of the\r\ngreat calamity that seems awaiting our destruction. I call especial\r\nattention to this subject, more particularly in consequence of the\r\nprobable effort that will be made to force what is called the \"Crittenden\r\nAmendment,\" upon the people. It should be remembered that Mr. Crittenden\r\nproposes, not only to give all the territory south of 36 deg. 30' to the slave\r\ninterests, but all the territory hereafter acquired.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Missouri Compromise sounds very smooth and pleasant\r\nto the ear, but is it the Missouri Compromise that Mr. Crittenden proposes\r\nto restore? Far from it. Let us look at the broad difference between the\r\ntwo measures, and see whether there is not something that looks as though\r\nthere was deception, of the deepest dye, about to be practiced upon those\r\nwho are desirous of preserving the territories free from the blighting\r\ncurse of slavery. We have heard much about the Missouri Compromise, also\r\nabout Mr. Crittenden's amendment, and, for the benefit of those who are\r\nnot familiar with the two measures, we will give them both in full. The\r\nfollowing is all that relates to the institution of slavery in what is\r\ncalled the Missouri Compromise:\r\n\r\n    \"SEC. 8. _And be it further enacted_, That, in all the territory ceded\r\n    by France to the United States, under the name of Louisiana, which\r\n    lies north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude,\r\n    not included within the limits of the State contemplated by this act,\r\n    (meaning Missouri,) slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than\r\n    in the punishment of crime, whereof the parties shall have been duly\r\n    convicted, shall be and is hereby forever prohibited; provided,\r\n    always, that any person escaping into the same, from whom service is\r\n    lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of the United States, such\r\n    fugitive may be lawfully re-claimed and conveyed to the person\r\n    claiming his or her services as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the above section does not establish slavery\r\nanywhere, but, on the contrary, it prohibited it in all the territory\r\nnorth of 36 deg. 30' north latitude, while south of that (we can only infer\r\nfor there is nothing explicit on the subject) the people were to have\r\nslavery or not as they might decide amongst themselves. But, in order to\r\nthe more fully understanding the effect of the Missouri Compromise, it is\r\nnecessary to know the amount of territory belonging, at that time, to the\r\nUnited States, lying south of said above mentioned line. The territory\r\nthat now constitutes the State of Arkansas, and a small tract of Indian\r\nterritory, which now belongs to four tribes of Indians, to-wit: the\r\nChickasaws, Seminoles, Cherokees, and Choctaws, all of which territory,\r\nincluding that of Arkansas, is not much larger than the State of Missouri,\r\nwas all the territory that remained of the Louisiana purchase, belonging\r\nto the United States, south of 36 deg. 30' north latitude, at the time of the\r\npassage of said compromise. How different, in effect, from the above is\r\nthe Crittenden amendment. Let us see. The following is the said amendment\r\nthat is harped about as being a restoration of the Missouri Compromise.\r\nRead and behold the difference:\r\n\r\n    \"WHEREAS, Serious and alarming dissensions have arisen between the\r\n    Northern and Southern States, concerning the rights and security of\r\n    the rights of slaveholding States, and especially their rights in the\r\n    common territory of the United States; and whereas, it is eminently\r\n    desirable and proper that these dissensions, which now threaten the\r\n    very existence of this Union, should be permanently quieted and\r\n    settled by constitutional provisions, which shall do equal justice to\r\n    all sections, and thereby restore to the people that peace and good\r\n    will which ought to prevail between all the citizens of the United\r\n    States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States of America in Congress assembled_, (two-thirds of both houses\r\n    concurring,) That the following articles be, and are hereby proposed\r\n    and submitted as amendments to the Constitution of the United States,\r\n    which shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of said\r\n    Constitution, when ratified by conventions of three-fourths of the\r\n    several States:\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 1. In all the territory of the United States now held, or\r\n    hereafter acquired, situated north of latitude 36 deg. 30 min.,\r\n    slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, is\r\n    prohibited while such territory shall remain under territorial\r\n    government. In all the territory south of said line of latitude,\r\n    slavery of the African race is hereby recognized as existing, and\r\n    shall not be interfered with by Congress, but shall be protected as\r\n    property by all the departments of the territorial government during\r\n    its continuance. And when any territory, north or south of said line,\r\n    within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe, shall contain the\r\n    population requisite for a member of Congress according to the then\r\n    federal ratio of representation of the people of the United States, it\r\n    shall, if its form of government be republican, be admitted into the\r\n    Union, on an equal footing with the original States, with or without\r\n    slavery, as the constitution of such new State may provide.\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 2. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in places\r\n    under its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate within the limits of\r\n    States that permit the holding of slaves.\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 3. Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery within the\r\n    District of Columbia, so long as it exists in the adjoining States of\r\n    Virginia and Maryland, or either, nor without the consent of the\r\n    inhabitants, nor without just compensation first made to such owners\r\n    of slaves as do not consent to such abolishment. Nor shall Congress at\r\n    any time prohibit officers of the Federal Government, or members of\r\n    Congress, whose duties require them to be in said District, from\r\n    bringing with them their slaves, and holding them as such during the\r\n    time their duties may require them to remain there, and afterwards\r\n    taking them from the District.\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 4. Congress shall have no power to prohibit or hinder the\r\n    transportation of slaves from one State to another, or to a Territory,\r\n    in which slaves are permitted to be held, whether that transportation\r\n    be by land, navigable rivers, or by sea.\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 5. That in addition to the provisions of the third paragraph of\r\n    the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the\r\n    United States, Congress shall have power to provide by law, and it\r\n    shall be its duty so to provide, that the United States shall pay to\r\n    the owner who shall apply for it, the full value of his fugitive slave\r\n    in all cases when the Marshal or other officer, whose duty it was to\r\n    arrest said fugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence, or\r\n    when, after arrest, said fugitive was rescued by force, and the owner\r\n    thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for the\r\n    recovery of his fugitive slave under the said clause of the\r\n    Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof. And in all such\r\n    cases, when the United States shall pay for such fugitive, they shall\r\n    have the right, in their own name, to sue the county in which said\r\n    violence, intimidation, or rescue was committed, and to recover from\r\n    it, with interest and damages, the amount paid by them for said\r\n    fugitive slave. And the said county, after it has paid said amount to\r\n    the United States, may, for its indemnity, sue and recover from the\r\n    wrong doers or rescuers, by whom the owner was prevented from the\r\n    recovery of his fugitive slave, in like manner as the owner himself\r\n    might have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n    \"ART. 6. No future amendment to the Constitution shall affect the five\r\n    preceding articles; nor the third paragraph of the second section of\r\n    the first article of the Constitution; and no amendment shall be made\r\n    to the Constitution which shall authorize or give to Congress any\r\n    power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any of the States by\r\n    whose law it is, or may be, allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n    \"And whereas, also, beside those causes of dissension embraced in the\r\n    foregoing amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United\r\n    States, there are others which come within the jurisdiction of\r\n    Congress, and may be remedied by its legislative power; and whereas it\r\n    is the desire of Congress, as far as its power will extend, to remove\r\n    all just cause for the popular discontent and agitation which now\r\n    disturb the peace of the country, and threaten the stability of its\r\n    institutions: Therefore,\r\n\r\n    \"1. _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States of America_, in Congress assembled, That the laws now in force,\r\n    for the recovery of fugitives, are in strict pursuance of the plain\r\n    and mandatory provisions of the constitution, and have been sanctioned\r\n    as valid and constitutional by the judgment of the Supreme Court of\r\n    the United States: that the slaveholding States are entitled to the\r\n    faithful observance and execution of those laws, and that they ought\r\n    not to be repealed, or so modified or changed as to impair their\r\n    efficiency; and that laws ought to be made for the punishment of those\r\n    who attempt, by rescue of the slave or other illegal means, to hinder\r\n    or defeat the due execution of said laws.\r\n\r\n    \"2. That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive slave acts of\r\n    congress, or any other constitutional acts of congress, or which in\r\n    their operation impede, hinder or delay the free course and due\r\n    execution of any of said acts, are null and void by the plain\r\n    provisions of the constitution of the United States; yet those State\r\n    laws, void as they are, have given color to practices, and led to\r\n    consequences, which have obstructed the due administration and\r\n    execution of acts of congress and especially the acts for the delivery\r\n    of fugitive slaves, and have thereby contributed much to the discord\r\n    and commotion now prevailing. Congress, therefore, in the present\r\n    perilous juncture, does not deem it improper respectfully and\r\n    earnestly to recommend the repeal of those laws to the several States\r\n    which have enacted them, or such legislative corrections and\r\n    explanations of them as may prevent their being used or perverted to\r\n    such mischievous purposes.\r\n\r\n    \"3. That the act of the 18th of September, 1850, commonly called the\r\n    fugitive slave law, ought to be so amended as to make the fee of the\r\n    commissioner, mentioned in the 8th section of the act, equal in\r\n    amount, in the cases decided by him, whether his decision be in favor\r\n    of or against the claimant. And to avoid misconstruction, the last\r\n    clause of the 5th section of said act, which authorises the person\r\n    holding the warrant for the arrest or detention of a fugitive slave,\r\n    to summon to his aid the _posse comitatus_, and which declares it to\r\n    be the duty of all good citizens to assist him in its execution, ought\r\n    to be amended so as to expressly limit the authority and duty to cases\r\n    in which there shall be resistance or danger of resistance or rescue.\r\n\r\n    \"4. That the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade, and\r\n    especially those prohibiting the importation of slaves in the United\r\n    States, ought to be made effectual, and ought to be thoroughly\r\n    executed, and all further enactments necessary to those ends ought to\r\n    be promptly made.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is unblushingly urged upon the people by some portions of the\r\nDemocracy as being eminently conservative, and, above all, a middle\r\nground, upon which all patriots should be willing to stand or fall for the\r\nUnion; but as for me I am entirely unable to see that there is any middle\r\nground about it. What can we understand by this proposition? Is it not\r\ngranting all the South have ever asked? When, and wherein, have they asked\r\nmore? Could Mr. Yancey himself have made out a stronger document? And\r\nyet, we are told that the South are making great concessions when they\r\nsubmit to this measure, and cease to commit treason against the\r\ngovernment. In the name of enlightened reason, I ask, could there be a\r\ngreater insult offered to the free men of this nation, than to demand of\r\nthem the sanction of the above proposed amendment, and thus engraft it\r\ninto the Constitution of this government, claiming, as we do, to be the\r\nfreest government in the world.\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of Mr. Crittenden's proposition, it will be perceived\r\nthat he irrevocably consigns to slavery all the Territory that we now\r\nhave, or may hereafter acquire, south of thirty-six degrees and thirty\r\nminutes, north latitude, and north of that line he leaves the matter for\r\nthe people to decide when they come to form a State government. By\r\ncomparing this measure with the Missouri Compromise, it will be perceived\r\nthat Mr. Crittenden proposes to leave the northern territory in the same\r\ncondition that the Missouri Compromise left the territory south of said\r\nline.\r\n\r\nBut let us view this beautiful document of Mr. Crittenden's a little\r\nfurther, and see how modestly the people of the free States are asked to\r\npay for Sambo whenever he gets it into his head to emigrate northward,\r\nprovided some one or more of his sable brethren should chance to advise\r\nthose whose duty it may be to invite Sambo to return to the \"Sunny South,\"\r\nto make tracks with the heels towards the shanty, and allow Sambo to\r\nremain where the winters are longer. Yes, we are asked by Mr. C. to pay\r\nfor Sambo whenever the marshal, whose duty it is to arrest him, is\r\n_intimidated_. This sounds most beautiful. Let the people once agree to\r\nthis and we would soon have the privilege of paying for hundreds of\r\nthousands, I might say millions, of the refractory portion of the slave\r\npopulation, and in order to understand these fully, the consequences of\r\nadopting Mr. Crittenden's amendment, it will be well for us to estimate\r\nthe probable number of the slave population in the future, as well as\r\ntheir inclination to escape.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact, that if the slave population should increase for\r\nthe next eighty years as fast as they have for the past eighty years, they\r\nwill amount to between forty and fifty millions of inhabitants. Now let\r\nus imagine that number of slaves, with the natural increase of\r\nintelligence, together with a corresponding decrease of the preponderance\r\nof African blood in their veins, and it will not take a very strong\r\nimaginative individual to perceive that the number of fugitives will\r\nincrease at a fearful rate, and to such an extent that it would impoverish\r\nthe whole nation to pay for them. By a careful examination of Mr.\r\nCrittenden's amendment it will be perceived that it provides for\r\nrecovering the value of the slave, by the United States, of the county in\r\nwhich said violence, INTIMIDATION, or rescue was committed.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose that this should become a part and parcel of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and some one or more of the States\r\nshould pass laws nullifying said provision, and at the same time demand a\r\nrevision of the Constitution in such a manner as to annul said clause, as\r\na condition that they would remain in the Union, will our Union-saving\r\nfriends be willing to meet the case by granting the demand, or will they\r\nstand up for the enforcement of the laws and the preservation of the\r\nUnion? If so, then why not assist in enforcing the laws against South\r\nCarolina or any other State that proposes to nullify the Constitution and\r\nthe laws made in pursuance thereof. Partisan prejudice cannot prevent any\r\nperson from seeing that if one portion of the people have the right to\r\nmake a demand for concessions, then any and all other portions are\r\nentitled to the exercise of the same right, and where such demands have\r\nbeen complied with in one case, there is no rule whereby they could justly\r\nbe denied in another. Is there not great danger that by granting the South\r\nwhat they are now demanding, especially since the demand is accompanied\r\nwith threats of such a grave character, we will establish a precedence\r\nthat will sap the very principle upon which our government is based? In\r\nall Democratic governments it is the duty of every individual to submit to\r\nthe laws duly enacted by a constitutional majority; and whenever one\r\nportion of the people rebel against said laws they become not only\r\ntraitors to their country but to the very principles upon which self\r\ngovernment is founded. In view of this, it is clear to me that to make any\r\nconcession, under the existing menacing threats, would be to offer a\r\nbounty to all future conspirutors against the government, and thus\r\nendanger the peace of our country for all time to come. Such being the\r\ncase, why talk about compromises and concessions. Let us enforce obedience\r\nto the present government before we talk of compromises. To treat with men\r\nwho bid defiance to the supreme law of the land, who are now engaged in\r\nopen and active treason against the government, would be humiliating to\r\nevery true American citizen, and a disgrace to us as a nation, besides\r\nshowing to the world the most _positive_ evidence of our weakness; but on\r\nthe other hand let firmness and justice be the order of the day, and\r\nalthough war may ensue let the consequences rest with those who are trying\r\nto overthrow this great temple of freedom, and we shall outride the\r\nthreatend storm and transmit to posterity, unimpaired, this sacred legacy,\r\nbequeathed to us by our forefathers and sealed by their blood. We will\r\nthen have shown ourselves worthy of the free institutions we have\r\ninherited, and our children's children will be stimulated by our example\r\nto extra exertions to perpetuate and strengthen the bonds that is to\r\npreserve this nation in all its destined magnificent grandeur.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me exhort my fellow-countrymen to stand or fall by our\r\ncountry. Let us not forget that our fathers, as well as we, loved peace\r\nand abhorred the calamities of war; and although the most of them have\r\nlong since \"gone to that bourne from which no traveler returns,\" yet when\r\nthey were called to their country's service, they were surrounded by all\r\nthe endearing ties which we now enjoy. Many a son received the mother's\r\nlast parting blessing, and bid her his last farewell this side of the\r\ngrave. Husbands bid their wives an affectionate adieu, to meet no more on\r\nearth; and many a bitter tear has flown from the weeping eyes of the loved\r\nones in that lonely home, bereft of a father, husband, or brother who has\r\nfallen in the deadly struggle for the liberties we have inherited. And\r\nshould we prove recreant to our trust, the immortal spirits of those\r\nnoble-hearted, self-sacrificing patriots who fell while struggling with a\r\npowerful tyrant in front, and a deadly savage foe in the rear, to gain the\r\nfreedom of this our beloved country, would rise up from their graves and\r\nrebuke us for our low, cringing cowardice. No, my fellow-countrymen, you\r\nwill not be found wanting for courage--you will not allow this temple of\r\nfreedom to be destroyed--you will stand by the Constitution and the Union,\r\nand prove yourselves worthy of your noble ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Spirit of Laws, Vol. I, Book IX, Chapter I.\r\n\r\n[2] I mean for the Union.\r\n\r\n[3] Joseph Story, LL. D., although a most bitter political opponent of\r\nGen. Jackson, in his commentaries on the constitution of the United\r\nStates, thus refers to the proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"While this sheet was passing through the press, President Jackson's\r\nproclamation of the 10th of December, 1832, concerning the recent\r\nordinance of South Carolina on the subject of the tariff, appeared. That\r\ndocument contains a most elaborate view of several questions, which have\r\nbeen discussed in this and the preceding volume, especially respecting the\r\nsupremacy of the laws of the Union; the right of the judiciary to decide\r\nupon the constitutionality of those laws; and the total repugnancy to the\r\nconstitution of the modern doctrine of nullification asserted in that\r\nordinance. As a State paper it is entitled to very high praise for the\r\nclearness, force and eloquence, with which it has defended the rights and\r\npowers of the national government. I gladly copy into these pages some of\r\nits important passages, as among the ablest commentaries ever offered upon\r\nthe constitution.\"\r\n\r\n[4] We are happy to say that within a few days he has dismissed some, and\r\nothers, disgusted with their own acts, have withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[5] John Fries was a noted leader in what was called the Whisky Rebellion,\r\nwhich became so formidable in 1794 that President Washington issued a\r\nproclamation exhorting all persons to desist from any proceedings tending\r\nto prevent the execution of the laws. This did not have the desired\r\neffect, however, and it became necessary for the President to order out a\r\nstrong force, numbering some 15,000 men. This argument seemed conclusive\r\nand convincing to the rebels of that day, consequently they returned to\r\ntheir several avocations, and by this means quiet was restored. But at\r\nthat time, as well at the present, there were numerous sympathizers with\r\nthe traitors, which created a strong and powerful party against the\r\nadministration of General Washington; but he knew his whole duty, and\r\nperformed it unhesitatingly, regardless of the denunciations of those who\r\nwere ever ready to excuse the turbulent for committing treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGENTS WANTED TO INTRODUCE THE AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN, BY JOHN KING, M.\r\nD. PREPARED EXPRESSLY FOR FAMILY USE.\r\n\r\nThis valuable work is a large, royal octavo volume of nearly 1,200 pages;\r\ncontaining nearly twice as much matter on the subject of health and\r\ndisease, as can be found in any similar work ever before offered to the\r\nAmerican people. Instead of describing diseases and remedies in the\r\nmysterious and incomprehensible terms of the profession, the author has\r\nused language such as the people understand. No less than _three hundred\r\nand seventy forms of disease_, including diseases of women, diseases of\r\nchildren, chronic diseases, as well as those of a surgical nature are\r\naccurately described and the most successful methods of treatment made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nNearly _five hundred simple medicines are described_, together with their\r\nvirtues and medicinal uses. And the recipes for some _two hundred and\r\nfifty valuable and successful compounds and preparations_ are given.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the numerous notices and recommendations the\r\nwork has received by those who have given it an examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is from the justly celebrated Dr. Burnham, proprietor of the\r\nChronic Disease Infirmary of this city.\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, IND., JAN. 14TH, 1861\r\n\r\nA. D. STREIGHT, ESQ.: _Dear Sir_--Having carefully examined a work of your\r\npublication entitled, \"New American Family Physician,\" by John King, M.\r\nD., I find in point of style that it is concise, couched in plain\r\nlanguage, and free from technicalities. Voluminous in variety of topics\r\ndiscussed, it comprises an amount of practical matter pertaining to the\r\npreservation of health, the history and treatment of disease unequaled in\r\nadaptation for popular use. A more general diffusion of knowledge upon the\r\ntopics therein discussed, will serve as one of the greatest protections\r\nagainst the intrusions of ignorant pretenders who propose to tamper with\r\nhuman health and life. And I trust will be cordially hailed by every\r\nintelligent physician appreciating the fact that the stupid credulity of\r\nignorance is much more forminable to encounter than the wisdom of an\r\nenlightened intelligence. In fine, the volume is worthy of the well earned\r\nreputation of its author, and I cheerfully commend it as highly deserving\r\na promient place in the library of every family.\r\n\r\n  Truly yours,\r\n    N. G. BURNHAM, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_From Dr. G. M. Thompson, Agent for Kansas_]\r\n\r\nTell Dr. King that I have had the pleasure of selling a copy of his\r\n\"Physician\" to Ex-Governor C. Robinson, Ex-Governor F. P. Stanton,\r\nEx-Governor Wilson Shannon, and all the principal men in the Territory, as\r\nfar as I have been able to canvass.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANESVILLE, WIS., OCT. 23D, 1860.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--I have examined the medical work of John King, M. D., entitled\r\nthe \"American Family Physician,\" &c. I am highly pleased with it. In fact\r\nit supplies a long needed want, in the field of domestic medicine. It is\r\nwritten in a plain, easy style and readily comprehended by the\r\nnon-professional reader, to which it will be a valuable aid in the\r\ntreatment of the diseases incident to their own families. In truth, any\r\none with a family will save double the cost of the book yearly, besides\r\nmuch useless and pernicious drugging. The remedies recommended are\r\nprincipally selected from the vegetable kingdom, many of which may be\r\nfound at home. From my examination of this work and my acquaintance with\r\nthe author, I can sincerely recommend it to both the professional and\r\nunprofessional reader, as a highly useful book and one that should be\r\nfound in the library of every person.\r\n\r\n  R.

The\r\nbook deserves much credit for its simplicity of style. It is not written\r\nfor the purpose of scientific display, _but for the good of the people_.\r\nIt goes further toward redeeming those practical facts contained in\r\nmedical science from the dead masses of technical lumber, by which they\r\nhave heretofore been secluded from the comprehension of those who have the\r\nbest right to understand them, than any work extant which it has been our\r\nprivilege to review.
