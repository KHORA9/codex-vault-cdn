The rest of the evidence upon the\r\n    sixth, and on part of the seventh, eighth, and fourteenth articles,\r\n    were respectively opened and enforced by Mr. Fox and other of the\r\n    Managers, on the 7th and 9th of June, in the same session. On the\r\n    23d May, 1791, Mr. St. John opened the fourth article of charge; and\r\n    evidence was heard in support of the same. In the following sessions\r\n    of 1792, Mr. Hastings's counsel were heard in his defence, which was\r\n    continued through the whole of the sessions of 1793.\r\n\r\n    On the 5th of March, 1794, a select committee was appointed by the\r\n    House of Commons to inspect the Lords' Journals, in relation to\r\n    their proceeding on the trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire, and to\r\n    report what they found therein to the House, (which committee were\r\n    the managers appointed to make good the articles of impeachment\r\n    against the said Warren Hastings, Esquire,) and who were afterwards\r\n    instructed to report the several matters which had occurred since\r\n    the commencement of the prosecution, and which had, in their\r\n    opinion, contributed to the duration thereof to that time, with\r\n    their observations thereupon. On the 30th of April, the following\r\n    Report, written by Mr. Burke, and adopted by the Committee, was\r\n    presented to the House of Commons, and ordered by the House to be\r\n    printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT\r\n\r\n     Made on the 30th April, 1794, from the Committee of the House of\r\n     Commons, appointed to inspect the Lords' Journals, in relation to\r\n     their proceeding on the trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire, and to\r\n     report what they find therein to the House (which committee were\r\n     the managers appointed to make good the articles of impeachment\r\n     against the said Warren Hastings, Esquire); and who were afterwards\r\n     instructed to report the several matters which have occurred since\r\n     the commencement of the said prosecution, and which have, in their\r\n     opinion, contributed to the duration thereof to the present time,\r\n     with their observations thereupon.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Committee has received two powers from the House:--The first, on\r\nthe 5th of March, 1794, to inspect the Lords' Journals, in relation to\r\ntheir proceedings on the trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire, and to\r\nreport what they find therein to the House. The second is an\r\ninstruction, given on the 17th day of the same month of March, to this\r\neffect: That your Committee do report to this House the several matters\r\nwhich have occurred since the commencement of the said prosecution, and\r\nwhich have, in their opinion, contributed to the duration thereof to the\r\npresent time, with their observations thereupon.\r\n\r\nYour Committee is sensible that the duration of the said trial, and the\r\ncauses of that duration, as well as the matters which have therein\r\noccurred, do well merit the attentive consideration of this House. We\r\nhave therefore endeavored with all diligence to employ the powers that\r\nhave been granted and to execute the orders that have been given to us,\r\nand to report thereon as speedily as possible, and as fully as the time\r\nwould admit.\r\n\r\nYour Committee has considered, first, the mere fact of the duration of\r\nthe trial, which they find to have commenced on the 13th day of\r\nFebruary, 1788, and to have continued, by various adjournments, to the\r\nsaid 17th of March. During that period the sittings of the Court have\r\noccupied one hundred and eighteen days, or about one third of a year.\r\nThe distribution of the sitting days in each year is as follows.\r\n\r\n                                                  Days.\r\nIn the year 1788, the Court sat                    35\r\n            1789,                                  17\r\n            1790,                                  14\r\n            1791,                                   5\r\n            1792,                                  22\r\n            1793,                                  22\r\n            1794, to the 1st of March, inclusive    3\r\n                                                 ----\r\n                                      Total       118\r\n\r\nYour Committee then proceeded to consider the causes of this duration,\r\nwith regard to time as measured by the calendar, and also as measured by\r\nthe number of days occupied in actual sitting. They find, on examining\r\nthe duration of the trial with reference to the number of years which\r\nit has lasted, that it has been owing to several prorogations and to one\r\ndissolution of Parliament; to discussions which are supposed to have\r\narisen in the House of Peers on the legality of the continuance of\r\nimpeachments from Parliament to Parliament; that it has been owing to\r\nthe number and length of the adjournments of the Court, particularly the\r\nadjournments on account of the Circuit, which adjournments were\r\ninterposed in the middle of the session, and the most proper time for\r\nbusiness; that it has been owing to one adjournment made in consequence\r\nof a complaint of the prisoner against one of your Managers, which took\r\nup a space of ten days; that two days' adjournments were made on account\r\nof the illness of certain of the Managers; and, as far as your Committee\r\ncan judge, two sitting days were prevented by the sudden and unexpected\r\ndereliction of the defence of the prisoner at the close of the last\r\nsession, your Managers not having been then ready to produce their\r\nevidence in reply, nor to make their observations on the evidence\r\nproduced by the prisoner's counsel, as they expected the whole to have\r\nbeen gone through before they were called on for their reply. In this\r\nsession your Committee computes that the trial was delayed about a week\r\nor ten days. The Lords waited for the recovery of the Marquis\r\nCornwallis, the prisoner wishing to avail himself of the testimony of\r\nthat noble person.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the one hundred and eighteen days employed in actual\r\nsitting, the distribution of the business was in the manner following.\r\n\r\nThere were spent,--\r\n\r\n                                                    Days\r\nIn reading the articles of impeachment, and the\r\ndefendant's answer, and in debate on the mode\r\nof proceeding                                          3\r\n\r\nOpening speeches, and summing up by the Managers      19\r\n\r\nDocumentary and oral evidence by the Managers         51\r\n\r\nOpening speeches and summing up by the defendant's\r\ncounsel, and defendant's addresses\r\nto the Court                                          22\r\n\r\nDocumentary and oral evidence on the part of the\r\ndefendant                                             23\r\n                                                    ----\r\n                                                     118\r\n\r\nThe other head, namely, that the trial has occupied one hundred and\r\neighteen days, or nearly one third of a year. This your Committee\r\nconceives to have arisen from the following immediate causes. First, the\r\nnature and extent of the matter to be tried. Secondly, the general\r\nnature and quality of the evidence produced: it was principally\r\ndocumentary evidence, contained in papers of great length, the whole of\r\nwhich was often required to be read when brought to prove a single short\r\nfact. Under the head of evidence must be taken into consideration the\r\nnumber and description of the witnesses examined and cross-examined.\r\nThirdly, and principally, the duration of the trial is to be attributed\r\nto objections taken by the prisoner's counsel to the admissibility of\r\nseveral documents and persons offered as evidence on the part of the\r\nprosecution. These objections amounted to sixty-two: they gave rise to\r\nseveral debates, and to twelve references from the Court to the Judges.\r\nOn the part of the Managers, the number of objections was small; the\r\ndebates upon them were short; there was not upon them any reference to\r\nthe Judges; and the Lords did not even retire upon any of them to the\r\nChamber of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis last cause of the number of sitting days your Committee considers\r\nas far more important than all the rest. The questions upon the\r\nadmissibility of evidence, the manner in which these questions were\r\nstated and were decided, the modes of proceeding, the great uncertainty\r\nof the principle upon which evidence in that court is to be admitted or\r\nrejected,--all these appear to your Committee materially to affect the\r\nconstitution of the House of Peers as a court of judicature, as well as\r\nits powers, and the purposes it was intended to answer in the state. The\r\nPeers have a valuable interest in the conservation of their own lawful\r\nprivileges. But this interest is not confined to the Lords. The Commons\r\nought to partake in the advantage of the judicial rights and privileges\r\nof that high court. Courts are made for the suitors, and not the suitors\r\nfor the court. The conservation of all other parts of the law, the whole\r\nindeed of the rights and liberties of the subject, ultimately depends\r\nupon the preservation of the Law of Parliament in its original force and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nYour Committee had reason to entertain apprehensions that certain\r\nproceedings in this trial may possibly limit and weaken the means of\r\ncarrying on any future impeachment of the Commons. As your Committee\r\nfelt these apprehensions strongly, they thought it their duty to begin\r\nwith humbly submitting facts and observations on the proceedings\r\nconcerning evidence to the consideration of this House, before they\r\nproceed to state the other matters which come within the scope of the\r\ndirections which they have received.\r\n\r\nTo enable your Committee the better to execute the task imposed upon\r\nthem in carrying on the impeachment of this House, and to find some\r\nprinciple on which they were to order and regulate their conduct\r\ntherein, they found it necessary to look attentively to the jurisdiction\r\nof the court in which they were to act for this House, and into its laws\r\nand rules of proceeding, as well as into the rights and powers of the\r\nHouse of Commons in their impeachments.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF THE JUDGES, ETC., TO THE COURT OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\nUpon examining into the course of proceeding in the House of Lords, and\r\ninto the relation which exists between the Peers, on the one hand, and\r\ntheir attendants and assistants, the Judges of the Realm, Barons of the\r\nExchequer of the Coif, the King's learned counsel, and the Civilians\r\nMasters of the Chancery, on the other, it appears to your Committee that\r\nthese Judges, and other persons learned in the Common and Civil Laws,\r\nare no integrant and necessary part of that court. Their writs of\r\nsummons are essentially different; and it does not appear that they or\r\nany of them have, or of right ought to have, a deliberative voice,\r\neither actually or virtually, in the judgments given in the High Court\r\nof Parliament. Their attendance in that court is solely ministerial; and\r\ntheir answers to questions put to them are not to be regarded as\r\ndeclaratory of the Law of Parliament, but are merely consultory\r\nresponses, in order to furnish such matter (to be submitted to the\r\njudgment of the Peers) as may be useful in reasoning by analogy, so far\r\nas the nature of the rules in the respective courts of the learned\r\npersons consulted shall appear to the House to be applicable to the\r\nnature and circumstances of the case before them, and no otherwise.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nJURISDICTION OF THE LORDS.\r\n\r\nYour Committee finds, that, in all impeachments of the Commons of Great\r\nBritain for high crimes and misdemeanors before the Peers in the High\r\nCourt of Parliament, the Peers are not triers or jurors only, but, by\r\nthe ancient laws and constitution of this kingdom, known by constant\r\nusage, are judges both of law and fact; and we conceive that the Lords\r\nare bound not to act in such a manner as to give rise to an opinion that\r\nthey have virtually submitted to a division of their legal powers, or\r\nthat, putting themselves into the situation of mere triers or jurors,\r\nthey may suffer the evidence in the cause to be produced or not produced\r\nbefore them, according to the discretion of the judges of the inferior\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\nYour Committee finds that the Lords, in matter of appeal or impeachment\r\nin Parliament, are not of right obliged to proceed according to the\r\ncourse or rules of the Roman Civil Law, or by those of the law or usage\r\nof any of the inferior courts in Westminster Hall, but by the law and\r\nusage of Parliament. And your Committee finds that this has been\r\ndeclared in the most clear and explicit manner by the House of Lords, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 1387 and 1388, in the 11th year of King Richard II.\r\n\r\nUpon an appeal in Parliament then depending against certain great\r\npersons, peers and commoners, the said appeal was referred to the\r\nJustices, and other learned persons of the law. \"At which time,\" it is\r\nsaid in the record, that \"the Justices and Serjeants, and others the\r\nlearned in the Law Civil, were charged, by order of the King our\r\nsovereign aforesaid, to give their faithful counsel to the Lords of the\r\nParliament concerning the due proceedings in the cause of the appeal\r\naforesaid. The which Justices, Serjeants, and the learned in the law of\r\nthe kingdom, and also the learned in the Law Civil, have taken the same\r\ninto deliberation, and have answered to the said Lords of Parliament,\r\nthat they had seen and well considered the tenor of the said appeal; and\r\nthey say that the same appeal was neither made nor pleaded according to\r\nthe order which the one law or the other requires. Upon which the said\r\nLords of Parliament have taken the same into deliberation and\r\nconsultation, and by the assent of our said Lord the King, and of their\r\ncommon agreement, it was declared, that, in so high a crime as that\r\nwhich is charged in this appeal, which touches the person of our lord\r\nthe King, and the state of the whole kingdom, perpetrated by persons who\r\nare peers of the kingdom, along with others, the cause shall not be\r\ntried in any other place but in Parliament, nor by any other law than\r\nthe law and course of Parliament; and that it belongeth to the Lords of\r\nParliament, and to their franchise and liberty by the ancient custom of\r\nthe Parliament, to be judges in such cases, and in these cases to judge\r\nby the assent of the King; and thus it shall be done in this case, by\r\nthe award of Parliament: because the realm of England has not been\r\nheretofore, nor is it the intention of our said lord the King and the\r\nLords of Parliament that it ever should be governed by the Law Civil;\r\nand also, it is their resolution not to rule or govern so high a cause\r\nas this appeal is, which cannot be tried anywhere but in Parliament, as\r\nhath been said before, by the course, process, and order used in any\r\ncourts or place inferior in the same kingdom; which courts and places\r\nare not more than the executors of the ancient laws and customs of the\r\nkingdom, and of the ordinances and establishments of Parliament. It was\r\ndetermined by the said Lords of Parliament, by the assent of our said\r\nlord the King, that this appeal was made and pleaded well and\r\nsufficiently, and that the process upon it is good and effectual,\r\naccording to the law and course of Parliament; and for such they decree\r\nand adjudge it.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAnd your Committee finds, that toward the close of the same Parliament\r\nthe same right was again claimed and admitted as the special privilege\r\nof the Peers, in the following manner:--\"In this Parliament, all the\r\nLords then present, Spiritual as well as Temporal, claimed as their\r\nfranchise, that the weighty matters moved in this Parliament, and which\r\nshall be moved in other Parliaments in future times, touching the peers\r\nof the land, shall be managed, adjudged, and discussed by the course of\r\nParliament, and in no sort by the Law Civil, or by the common law of the\r\nland, used in the other lower courts of the kingdom; which claim,\r\nliberty, and franchise the King graciously allowed and granted to them\r\nin full Parliament.\"[2]\r\n\r\nYour Committee finds that the Commons, having at that time considered\r\nthe appeal above mentioned, approved the proceedings in it, and, as far\r\nas in them lay, added the sanction of their accusation against the\r\npersons who were the objects of the appeal. They also, immediately\r\nafterwards, impeached all the Judges of the Common Pleas, the Chief\r\nBaron of the Exchequer, and other learned and eminent persons, both\r\npeers and commoners; upon the conclusion of which impeachments it was\r\nthat the second claim was entered. In all the transactions aforesaid the\r\nCommons were acting parties; yet neither then nor ever since have they\r\nmade any objection or protestation, that the rule laid down by the Lords\r\nin the beginning of the session of 1388 ought not to be applied to the\r\nimpeachments of commoners as well as peers. In many cases they have\r\nclaimed the benefit of this rule; and in all cases they have acted, and\r\nthe Peers have determined, upon the same general principles. The Peers\r\nhave always supported the same franchises; nor are there any precedents\r\nupon the records of Parliament subverting either the general rule or the\r\nparticular privilege, so far as the same relates either to the course of\r\nproceeding or to the rule of law by which the Lords are to judge.\r\n\r\nYour Committee observes also, that, in the commissions to the several\r\nLords High Stewards who have been appointed on the trials of peers\r\nimpeached by the Commons, the proceedings are directed to be had\r\naccording to the law and custom of the kingdom, _and the custom of\r\nParliament_: which words are not to be found in the commissions for\r\ntrying upon indictments.\r\n\r\n\"As every court of justice,\" says Lord Coke, \"hath laws and customs for\r\nits direction, some by the Common Law, some by the Civil and Canon Law,\r\nsome by peculiar laws and customs, &c., so the High Court of Parliament\r\n_suis propriis legibus et consuetudinibus subsistit_. It is by the _Lex\r\net Consuetudo Parliamenti_, that all weighty matters in any Parliament\r\nmoved, concerning the peers of the realm, or Commons in Parliament\r\nassembled, ought to be determined, adjudged, and discussed, by the\r\ncourse of the Parliament, and not by the Civil Law, nor yet by the\r\ncommon laws of this realm used in more inferior courts.\" And after\r\nfounding himself on this very precedent of the 11th of Richard II., he\r\nadds, _\"This is the reason that Judges ought not to give any opinion of\r\na matter of Parliament, because it is not to be decided by the common\r\nlaws, but secundum Legem et Consuetudinem Parliamenti: and so the Judges\r\nin divers Parliaments have confessed!\"_[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF PLEADING.\r\n\r\nYour Committee do not find that any rules of pleading, as observed in\r\nthe inferior courts, have ever obtained in the proceedings of the High\r\nCourt of Parliament, in a cause or matter in which the whole procedure\r\nhas been within their original jurisdiction. Nor does your Committee\r\nfind that any demurrer or exception, as of false or erroneous pleading,\r\nhath been ever admitted to any impeachment in Parliament, as not coming\r\nwithin the form of the pleading; and although a reservation or protest\r\nis made by the defendant (matter of form, as we conceive) \"to the\r\ngenerality, uncertainty, and insufficiency of the articles of\r\nimpeachment,\" yet no objections have in fact been ever made in any part\r\nof the record; and when verbally they have been made, (until this\r\ntrial,) they have constantly been overruled.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Lord Strafford[4] is one of the most important eras in the\r\nhistory of Parliamentary judicature. In that trial, and in the\r\ndispositions made preparatory to it, the process on impeachments was, on\r\ngreat consideration, research, and selection of precedents, brought very\r\nnearly to the form which it retains at this day; and great and important\r\nparts of Parliamentary Law were then laid down. The Commons at that time\r\nmade new charges or amended the old as they saw occasion. Upon an\r\napplication from the Commons to the Lords, that the examinations taken\r\nby their Lordships, at their request, might be delivered to them, for\r\nthe purpose of a more exact specification of the charge they had made,\r\non delivering the message of the Commons, Mr. Pym, amongst other things,\r\nsaid, as it is entered in the Lords' Journals, \"According to the clause\r\nof reservation in the conclusion of their charge, they [the Commons]\r\nwill add to the charges, not to the matter in respect of comprehension,\r\nextent, or kind, but only to reduce them to more particularities, that\r\nthe Earl of Strafford might answer with the more clearness and\r\nexpedition: _not that they are bound by this way of SPECIAL charge; and\r\ntherefore they have taken care in their House, upon protestation, that\r\nthis shall be no prejudice to bind them from proceeding in GENERAL in\r\nother cases, and that they are not to be ruled by proceedings in other\r\ncourts, which protestation they have made for the preservation of the\r\npower of Parliament; and they desire that the like care may be had in\r\nyour Lordships' House_.\"[5] This protestation is entered on the Lords'\r\nJournals. Thus careful were the Commons that no exactness used by them\r\nfor a temporary accommodation, should become an example derogatory to\r\nthe larger rights of Parliamentary process.\r\n\r\nAt length the question of their being obliged to conform to any of the\r\nrules below came to a formal judgment. In the trial of Dr. Sacheverell,\r\nMarch 10th, 1709, the Lord Nottingham \"desired their Lordships' opinion,\r\nwhether he might propose a question to the Judges _here_ [in Westminster\r\nHall]. Thereupon the Lords, being moved to adjourn, adjourned to the\r\nHouse of Lords, and on debate,\" as appears by a note, \"it was agreed\r\nthat the question should be proposed in Westminster Hall.\"[6]\r\nAccordingly, when the Lords returned the same day into the Hall, the\r\nquestion was put by Lord Nottingham, and stated to the Judges by the\r\nLord Chancellor: \"Whether, by the _law of England_, and constant\r\npractice in all prosecutions by _indictment and information_ for crimes\r\nand misdemeanors by writing or speaking, the particular words supposed\r\nto be written or spoken must not be expressly specified in the\r\nindictment or information?\" On this question the Judges, _seriatim_, and\r\nin open court, delivered their opinion: the substance of which was,\r\n\"That, by the laws of England, and the constant practice in Westminster\r\nHall, the words ought to be expressly specified in the indictment or\r\ninformation.\" Then the Lords adjourned, and did not come into the Hall\r\nuntil the 20th. In the intermediate time they came to resolutions on the\r\nmatter of the question put to the Judges. Dr. Sacheverell, being found\r\nguilty, moved in arrest of judgment upon two points. The first, which he\r\ngrounded on the opinion of the Judges, and which your Committee thinks\r\nmost to the present purpose, was, \"That no entire clause, or sentence,\r\nor expression, in either of his sermons or dedications, is particularly\r\nset forth in his impeachment, which he has already heard the Judges\r\ndeclare to be necessary in all cases of indictments or informations.\"[7]\r\nOn this head of objection, the Lord Chancellor, on the 23d of March,\r\nagreeably to the resolutions of the Lords of the 14th and 16th of March,\r\nacquainted Dr. Sacheverell, \"That, on occasion of the question before\r\nput to the Judges _in Westminster Hall_, and their answer thereto, their\r\nLordships had fully debated and considered of that matter, and had come\r\nto the following resolution: 'That this House will proceed to the\r\ndetermination of the impeachment of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, according to\r\nthe _law of the land, and the law and usage of Parliament_.' And\r\nafterwards to this resolution: 'That, by _the law and usage of\r\nParliament_ in prosecutions for high crimes and misdemeanors by writing\r\nor speaking, the particular words supposed to be criminal are _not\r\nnecessary_ to be expressly specified in such impeachment.' So that, in\r\ntheir Lordships' opinion, the law and usage of the High Court of\r\nParliament being _a part of the law of the land_, and that usage not\r\nrequiring that words should be exactly specified in impeachments, the\r\nanswer of the Judges, which related only to the course of _indictments\r\nand informations_, does not in the least affect your case.\"[8]\r\n\r\nOn this solemn judgment concerning the law and usage of Parliament, it\r\nis to be remarked: First, that the impeachment itself is not to be\r\npresumed inartificially drawn. It appears to have been the work of some\r\nof the greatest lawyers of the time, who were perfectly versed in the\r\nmanner of pleading in the courts below, and would naturally have\r\nimitated their course, if they had not been justly fearful of setting an\r\nexample which might hereafter subject the plainness and simplicity of a\r\nParliamentary proceeding to the technical subtilties of the inferior\r\ncourts. Secondly, that the question put to the Judges, and their answer,\r\nwere strictly confined to the law and practice below; and that nothing\r\nin either had a tendency to their delivering an opinion concerning\r\nParliament, its laws, its usages, its course of proceeding, or its\r\npowers. Thirdly, that the motion in arrest of judgment, grounded on the\r\nopinion of the Judges, was made only by Dr. Sacheverell himself, and not\r\nby his counsel, men of great skill and learning, who, if they thought\r\nthe objections had any weight, would undoubtedly have made and argued\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the case of the 11th King Richard II., the Judges declared\r\nunanimously, that such an objection would be fatal to such a pleading in\r\nany indictment or information; but the Lords, as on the former occasion,\r\noverruled this objection, and held the article to be good and valid,\r\nnotwithstanding the report of the Judges concerning the mode of\r\nproceeding in the courts below.\r\n\r\nYour Committee finds that a protest, with reasons at large, was entered\r\nby several lords against this determination of their court.[9] It is\r\nalways an advantage to those who protest, that their reasons appear upon\r\nrecord; whilst the reasons of the majority, who determine the question,\r\ndo not appear. This would be a disadvantage of such importance as\r\ngreatly to impair, if not totally to destroy, the effect of precedent as\r\nauthority, if the reasons which prevailed were not justly presumed to be\r\nmore valid than those which have been obliged to give way: the former\r\nhaving governed the final and conclusive decision of a competent court.\r\nBut your Committee, combining the fact of this decision with the early\r\ndecision just quoted, and with the total absence of any precedent of an\r\nobjection, before that time or since, allowed to pleading, or what has\r\nany relation to the rules and principles of pleading, as used in\r\nWestminster Hall, has no doubt that the House of Lords was governed in\r\nthe 9th of Anne by the very same principles which it had solemnly\r\ndeclared in the 11th of Richard II.\r\n\r\nBut besides the presumption in favor of the reasons which must be\r\nsupposed to have produced this solemn judgment of the Peers, contrary to\r\nthe practice of the courts below, as declared by all the Judges, it is\r\nprobable that the Lords were unwilling to take a step which might admit\r\nthat anything in that practice should be received as their rule. It must\r\nbe observed, however, that the reasons against the article alleged in\r\nthe protest were by no means solely bottomed in the practice of the\r\ncourts below, as if the main reliance of the protesters was upon that\r\nusage. The protesting minority maintained that it was not agreeable to\r\n_several precedents in Parliament_; of which they cited many in favor\r\nof their opinion. It appears by the Journals, that the clerks were\r\nordered to search for precedents, and a committee of peers was appointed\r\nto inspect the said precedents, and to report upon them,--and that they\r\ndid inspect and report accordingly. But the report is not entered on the\r\nJournals. It is, however, to be presumed that the greater number and the\r\nbetter precedents supported the judgment. Allowing, however, their\r\nutmost force to the precedents there cited, they could serve only to\r\nprove, that, in the case of _words_, (to which alone, and not the case\r\nof a _written_ libel, the precedents extended,) such a special averment,\r\naccording to the tenor of the words, had been used; but not that it was\r\nnecessary, or that ever any plea had been rejected upon such an\r\nobjection. As to the course of Parliament, resorted to for authority in\r\nthis part of the protest, the argument seems rather to affirm than to\r\ndeny the general proposition, that its own course, and not that of the\r\ninferior courts, had been the rule and law of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAs to the objection, taken in the protest, drawn from natural right, the\r\nLords knew, and it appears in the course of the proceeding, that the\r\nwhole of the libel had been read at length, as appears from p. 655 to p.\r\n666.[10] So that Dr. Sacheverell had _substantially_ the same benefit of\r\nanything which could be alleged in the extenuation or exculpation as if\r\nhis libellous sermons had been entered _verbatim_ upon the recorded\r\nimpeachment. It was adjudged sufficient to state the crime _generally_\r\nin the impeachment. The libels were given _in evidence_; and it was not\r\nthen thought of, that nothing should be given in evidence which was not\r\nspecially charged in the impeachment.\r\n\r\nBut whatever their reasons were, (great and grave they were, no doubt,)\r\nsuch as your Committee has stated it is the _judgment_ of the Peers on\r\nthe Law of Parliament, as a part of the law of the land. It is the more\r\nforcible as concurring with the judgment in the 11th of Richard II., and\r\nwith the total silence of the Rolls and Journals concerning any\r\nobjection to pleading ever being suffered to vitiate an impeachment, or\r\nto prevent evidence being given upon it, on account of its generality,\r\nor any other failure.\r\n\r\nYour Committee do not think it probable, that, even before this\r\nadjudication, the rules of pleading below could ever have been adopted\r\nin a Parliamentary proceeding, when it is considered that the several\r\nstatutes of Jeofails, not less than twelve in number,[11] have been made\r\nfor the correction of an over-strictness in pleading, to the prejudice\r\nof substantial justice: yet in no one of these is to be discovered the\r\nleast mention of any proceeding in Parliament. There is no doubt that\r\nthe legislature would have applied its remedy to that grievance in\r\nParliamentary proceedings, if it had found those proceedings embarrassed\r\nwith what Lord Mansfield, from the bench, and speaking of the matter of\r\nthese statutes, very justly calls \"disgraceful subtilties.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is still more strong to the point, your Committee finds that in the\r\n7th of William III. an act was made for the regulating of trials for\r\ntreason and misprision of treason, containing several regulations for\r\nreformation of proceedings at law, both as to matters of form and\r\nsubstance, as well as relative to evidence. It is an act thought most\r\nessential to the liberty of the subject; yet in this high and critical\r\nmatter, so deeply affecting the lives, properties, honors, and even the\r\ninheritable blood of the subject, the legislature was so tender of the\r\nhigh powers of this high court, deemed so necessary for the attainment\r\nof the great objects of its justice, so fearful of enervating any of its\r\nmeans or circumscribing any of its capacities, even by rules and\r\nrestraints the most necessary for the inferior courts, that they guarded\r\nagainst it by an express proviso, \"that neither this act, nor anything\r\ntherein contained, shall any ways extend to _any impeachment or other\r\nproceedings in Parliament, in any land whatsoever_.\"[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT OF THE COMMONS IN PLEADING.\r\n\r\nThis point being thus solemnly adjudged in the case of Dr. Sacheverell,\r\nand the principles of the judgment being in agreement with the whole\r\ncourse of Parliamentary proceedings, the Managers for this House have\r\never since considered it as an indispensable duty to assert the same\r\nprinciple, in all its latitude, upon all occasions on which it could\r\ncome in question,--and to assert it with an energy, zeal, and\r\nearnestness proportioned to the magnitude and importance of the interest\r\nof the Commons of Great Britain in the religious observation of the\r\nrule, _that the Law of Parliament, and the Law of Parliament only,\r\nshould prevail in the trial of their impeachments_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1715 (1 Geo. I.) the Commons thought proper to impeach of\r\nhigh treason the lords who had entered into the rebellion of that\r\nperiod. This was about six years after the decision in the case of\r\nSacheverell. On the trial of one of these lords, (the Lord Wintoun,[13])\r\nafter verdict, the prisoner moved in arrest of judgment, and excepted\r\nagainst the impeachment for error, on account of the treason therein\r\nlaid \"not being described with sufficient certainty,--the day on which\r\nthe treason was committed not having been alleged.\" His counsel was\r\nheard to this point. They contended, \"that the forfeitures in cases of\r\ntreason are very great, and therefore they humbly conceived that the\r\naccusation ought to contain all the certainty it is capable of, that the\r\nprisoner may not by _general allegations_ be rendered incapable to\r\ndefend himself in a case which may prove fatal to him: that they would\r\nnot trouble their Lordships with citing authorities; for they believed\r\nthere is not one gentleman of the long robe but will agree that an\r\nindictment for any capital offence to be erroneous, if the offence be\r\nnot alleged to be committed on a certain day: that this impeachment set\r\nforth only that in or about the months of September, October, or\r\nNovember, 1715, the offence charged in the impeachment had been\r\ncommitted.\" The counsel argued, \"that a proceeding by impeachment is a\r\nproceeding at the Common Law, for _Lex Parliamentaria_ is a part of\r\nCommon Law, and they submitted whether there is not the same certainty\r\nrequired in one method of proceeding at Common Law as in another.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was argued elaborately and learnedly, not only on the general\r\nprinciples of the proceedings below, but on the inconvenience and\r\npossible hardships attending this uncertainty. They quoted Sacheverell's\r\ncase, in whose impeachment \"the precise days were laid when the Doctor\r\npreached each of these two sermons; and that by a like reason a certain\r\nday ought to be laid in the impeachment when this treason was committed;\r\nand that the authority of Dr. Sacheverell's case seemed so much stronger\r\nthan the case in question as the crime of treason is higher than that of\r\na misdemeanor.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Managers for the Commons brought the point a second time to an\r\nissue, and that on the highest of capital cases: an issue, the event of\r\nwhich was to determine forever whether their impeachments were to be\r\nregulated by the law as understood and observed in the inferior courts.\r\nUpon the usage below there was no doubt; the indictment would\r\nunquestionably have been quashed. But the Managers for the Commons stood\r\nforth upon this occasion with a determined resolution, and no less than\r\nfour of them _seriatim_ rejected the doctrine contended for by Lord\r\nWintoun's counsel. They were all eminent members of Parliament, and\r\nthree of them great and eminent lawyers, namely, the then\r\nAttorney-General, Sir William Thomson, and Mr. Cowper.\r\n\r\nMr. Walpole said,--\"Those learned gentlemen [Lord Wintoun's counsel]\r\n_seem to forget in what court they are_. They have taken up so much of\r\nyour Lordships' time in quoting of authorities, and using arguments to\r\nshow your Lordships what would quash an indictment in _the courts\r\nbelow_, that they seemed to forget they are now in _a Court of\r\nParliament, and on an impeachment of the Commons of Great Britain_. For,\r\nshould the Commons admit all that they have offered, it will not follow\r\nthat the impeachment of the Commons is insufficient; and I must observe\r\nto your Lordships, that neither of the learned gentlemen have offered to\r\nproduce one instance relative to an impeachment. I mean to show that the\r\nsufficiency of an impeachment was never called in question for the\r\ngenerality of the charge, or that any instance of that nature was\r\noffered at before. The Commons don't conceive, that, if this exception\r\nwould quash an indictment, it would therefore make the impeachment\r\ninsufficient. I hope it never will be allowed here as a reason, that\r\nwhat quashes an indictment in the courts below will make insufficient an\r\nimpeachment brought by the Commons of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General supported Mr. Walpole in affirmance of this\r\nprinciple. He said,--\"I would follow the steps of the learned gentleman\r\nwho spoke before me, and I think he has given a good answer to these\r\nobjections. I would take notice that we are upon an impeachment, not\r\nupon an indictment. The courts below have set forms to themselves, which\r\nhave prevailed for a long course of time, and thereby are become the\r\nforms by which those courts are to govern themselves; but it never was\r\nthought that the forms of those courts had any influence on the\r\nproceedings of Parliament. In Richard II.'s time, it is said in the\r\nrecords of Parliament, that proceedings in Parliament are not to be\r\ngoverned by the forms of Westminster Hall. We are in the case of an\r\nimpeachment, and in the Court of Parliament. Your Lordships have already\r\ngiven judgment against six upon this impeachment, and it is warranted by\r\nthe precedents in Parliament; therefore we insist that the articles are\r\ngood in substance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowper.--\"They [the counsel] cannot but know that the usages of\r\nParliaments are part of the laws of the land, although they differ in\r\nmany instances from the Common Law, as practised in the inferior courts,\r\nin point of form. My Lords, if the Commons, in preparing articles of\r\nimpeachment, should govern themselves by precedents of indictments, in\r\nmy humble opinion they would depart from the ancient, nay, the constant,\r\nusage and practice of Parliament. It is well known that the form of an\r\nimpeachment has very little resemblance to that of an indictment; and I\r\nbelieve the Commons will endeavor to preserve the difference, by\r\nadhering to their own precedents.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Thomson.--\"We must refer to the forms and proceedings in the\r\nCourt of Parliament, and which must be owned to be part of the law of\r\nthe land. It has been mentioned already to your Lordships, that the\r\nprecedents in impeachments are not so nice and precise in form as in the\r\ninferior courts; and we presume your Lordships will be governed by the\r\nforms of your own court, (especially forms that are not essential to\r\njustice,) as the courts below are by theirs: which courts differ one\r\nfrom the other in many respects as to their forms of proceedings, and\r\nthe practice of each court is esteemed as the law of that court.\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General in reply maintained his first doctrine. \"There is\r\nno uncertainty; in it _that can be to the prejudice of the prisoner_: we\r\ninsist, it is according to _the forms of Parliament_: he has pleaded to\r\nit, and your Lordships have found him guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the Judges were taken in the House of Lords, on the 19th\r\nof March, 1715, upon two questions which had been argued in arrest of\r\njudgment, grounded chiefly on the practice of the courts below. To the\r\nfirst the Judges answered,--\"_It is necessary_ that there be a _certain_\r\nday laid in such indictments, on which the fact is alleged to be\r\ncommitted; and that alleging in such indictments that the fact was\r\ncommitted at or about a certain day would not be sufficient.\" To the\r\nsecond they answered, \"that, although a day certain, when the fact is\r\nsupposed to be done, be alleged in such indictments, yet it is not\r\nnecessary upon the trial to prove the fact to be committed upon _that\r\nday_; but it is sufficient, if proved to be done _on any other day\r\nbefore_ the indictment found.\"\r\n\r\nThen it was \"agreed by the House, and ordered, that the Lord High\r\nSteward be directed to acquaint the prisoner at the bar in Westminster\r\nHall, 'that the Lords have considered of the matters moved in arrest of\r\njudgment, and are of opinion that they are not sufficient to arrest the\r\nsame, but that the _impeachment_ is sufficiently certain in point of\r\ntime _according to the form of impeachments in Parliament_.'\"[14]\r\n\r\nOn this final adjudication, (given after solemn argument, and after\r\ntaking the opinion of the Judges,) in affirmance of the Law of\r\nParliament against the undisputed usage of the courts below, your\r\nCommittee has to remark,--1st, The preference of the custom of\r\nParliament to the usage below. By the very latitude of the charge, the\r\nParliamentary accusation gives the prisoner fair notice to prepare\r\nhimself upon all points: whereas there seems something insnaring in the\r\nproceedings upon indictment, which, fixing the specification of a day\r\ncertain for the treason or felony as absolutely necessary in the\r\ncharge, gives notice for preparation only on _that day_, whilst the\r\nprosecutor has the whole range of time antecedent to the indictment to\r\nallege and give evidence of facts against the prisoner. It has been\r\nusual, particularly in later indictments, to add, \"at several other\r\ntimes\"; but the strictness of naming one day is still necessary, and the\r\nwant of the larger words would not quash the indictment. 2dly, A\r\ncomparison of the extreme rigor and exactness required in the more\r\n_formal_ part of the proceeding (the indictment) with the extreme laxity\r\nused in the _substantial_ part (that is to say, the evidence received to\r\nprove the fact) fully demonstrates that the partisans of those forms\r\nwould put shackles on the High Court of Parliament, with which they are\r\nnot willing, or find it wholly impracticable, to bind themselves. 3dly,\r\nThat the latitude of departure from the letter of the indictment (which\r\nholds in other matters besides this) is in appearance much more contrary\r\nto natural justice than anything which has been objected against the\r\nevidence offered by your Managers, under a pretence that it exceeded the\r\nlimits of pleading. For, in the case of indictments below, it must be\r\nadmitted that the prisoner may be unprovided with proof of an alibi, and\r\nother material means of defence, or may find some matters unlooked-for\r\nproduced against him, by witnesses utterly unknown to him: whereas\r\nnothing was offered to be given in evidence, under any of the articles\r\nof this impeachment, except such as the prisoner must have had perfect\r\nknowledge of; the whole consisting of matters sent over by himself to\r\nthe Court of Directors, and authenticated under his own hand. No\r\nsubstantial injustice or hardship of any kind could arise from our\r\nevidence under our pleading: whereas in theirs very great and serious\r\ninconveniencies might happen.\r\n\r\nYour Committee has further to observe, that, in the case of Lord\r\nWintoun, as in the case of Dr. Sacheverell, the Commons had in their\r\nManagers persons abundantly practised in the law, as used in the\r\ninferior jurisdictions, who could easily have followed the precedents of\r\nindictments, if they had not purposely, and for the best reasons,\r\navoided such precedents.\r\n\r\nA great writer on the criminal law, Justice Foster, in one of his\r\nDiscourses,[15] fully recognizes those principles for which your\r\nManagers have contended, and which have to this time been uniformly\r\nobserved in Parliament. In a very elaborate reasoning on the case of a\r\ntrial in Parliament, (the trial of those who had murdered Edward II.,)\r\nhe observes thus:--\"It is _well known_, that, in _Parliamentary_\r\nproceedings of this kind, _it is, and ever was_, sufficient that matters\r\nappear with proper light and certainty to _a common understanding_,\r\nwithout that minute exactness which is required in criminal proceedings\r\nin Westminster Hall. In these cases the rule has always been, _Loquendum\r\nut vulgus_.\" And in a note he says,--\"In the proceeding against\r\nMortimer, in this Parliament, _so little regard was had to the forms\r\nused in legal proceedings_, that he who had been frequently summoned to\r\nParliament as a baron, and had lately been created Earl of March, is\r\nstyled through the whole record merely Roger de Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\nThe departure from the common forms in the first case alluded to by\r\nFoster (viz., the trial of Berkeley, Maltravers, &c., for treason, in\r\nthe murder of Edward II.[16]) might be more plausibly attacked, because\r\nthey were tried, though in Parliament, by a jury of freeholders: which\r\ncircumstance might have given occasion to justify a nearer approach to\r\nthe forms of indictments below. But no such forms were observed, nor in\r\nthe opinion of this able judge ought they to have been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICITY OF THE JUDGES' OPINIONS.\r\n\r\nIt appears to your Committee, that, from the 30th year of King Charles\r\nII. until the trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire, in all trials in\r\nParliament, as well upon impeachments of the Commons as on indictments\r\nbrought up by _Certiorari_, when any matter of law hath been agitated at\r\nthe bar, or in the course of trial hath been stated by any lord in the\r\ncourt, it hath been the prevalent custom to state the same in open\r\ncourt. Your Committee has been able to find, since that period, no more\r\nthan one precedent (and that a precedent rather in form than in\r\nsubstance) of the opinions of the Judges being taken privately, except\r\nwhen the case on both sides has been closed, and the Lords have retired\r\nto consider of their verdict or of their judgment thereon. Upon the\r\nsoundest and best precedents, the Lords have improved on the principles\r\nof publicity and equality, and have called upon the parties severally to\r\nargue the matter of law, previously to a reference to the Judges, who,\r\non their parts, have afterwards, _in open court_, delivered their\r\nopinions, often by the mouth of one of the Judges, speaking for himself\r\nand the rest, and in their presence: and sometimes all the Judges have\r\ndelivered their opinion _seriatim_, (even when they have been unanimous\r\nin it,) together with their reasons upon which their opinion had been\r\nfounded. This, from the most early times, has been the course in all\r\njudgments in the House of Peers. Formerly even the record contained the\r\nreasons of the decision. \"The reason wherefore,\" said Lord Coke, \"the\r\nrecords of Parliaments have been so highly extolled is, that therein is\r\nset down, in cases of difficulty, not only the judgment and resolution,\r\nbut _the reasons and causes of the same_ by so great advice.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIn the 30th of Charles II., during the trial of Lord Cornwallis,[18] on\r\nthe suggestion of a question in law to the Judges, Lord Danby demanded\r\nof the Lord High Steward, the Earl of Nottingham, \"whether it would be\r\nproper here [in open court] to ask the question of your Grace, or to\r\npropose it to the Judges?\" The Lord High Steward answered,--\"If your\r\nLordships doubt of anything whereon a question in law ariseth, the\r\nlatter opinion, and the _better_ for the prisoner, is, _that it must be\r\nstated in the presence of the prisoner, that he may know whether the\r\nquestion be truly put_. It hath _sometimes_ been practised otherwise,\r\nand the Peers have sent for the Judges, and have asked their opinion in\r\nprivate, and have come back, and have given their verdict according to\r\nthat opinion; and there is scarcely a precedent of its being otherwise\r\ndone. There is a later authority in print that doth settle the point so\r\nas I tell you, and I do conceive _it ought to be followed_; and it\r\nbeing safer for the prisoner, my humble opinion to your Lordship is,\r\nthat he ought to be present at _the stating of the question_. Call the\r\n_prisoner_.\" The prisoner, who had withdrawn, again appearing, he\r\nsaid,--\"My Lord Cornwallis, my Lords the Peers, since they have\r\nwithdrawn, have conceived a doubt in some matter [of law arising upon\r\nthe matter] of fact in your case; and they have that tender regard of a\r\nprisoner at the bar, _that they will not suffer a case to be put up in\r\nhis absence_, lest it should chance to prejudice him by being _wrong\r\nstated_.\" Accordingly the question was both put and the Judges' answer\r\ngiven publicly and in his presence.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the trial of Lord Cornwallis, the impeachment against\r\nLord Stafford was brought to a hearing,--that is, in the 32d of Charles\r\nII. In that case the lord at the bar having stated a point of law,\r\n\"touching the necessity of two witnesses to an overt act in case of\r\ntreason,\" the Lord High Steward told Lord Stafford, that \"all the Judges\r\nthat assist them, _and are here in your Lordship's presence and\r\nhearing_, should deliver their opinions whether it be doubtful and\r\ndisputable or not.\" Accordingly the Judges delivered their opinion, and\r\neach argued it (though they were all agreed) _seriatim_ and _in open\r\ncourt_. Another abstract point of law was also proposed from the bar, on\r\nthe same trial, concerning the legal sentence in high treason; and in\r\nthe same manner the Judges on reference delivered their opinion _in open\r\ncourt_; and no objection, was taken to it as anything new or\r\nirregular.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the 1st of James II. came on a remarkable trial of a peer,--the trial\r\nof Lord Delamere. On that occasion a question of law was stated. There\r\nalso, in conformity to the precedents and principles given on the trial\r\nof Lord Cornwallis, and the precedent in the impeachment of Lord\r\nStafford, the then Lord High Steward took care that the opinion of the\r\nJudges should be given in open court.\r\n\r\nPrecedents grounded on principles so favorable to the fairness and\r\nequity of judicial proceedings, given in the reigns of Charles II. and\r\nJames II., were not likely to be abandoned after the Revolution. The\r\nfirst trial of a peer which we find after the Revolution was that of the\r\nEarl of Warwick.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Earl of Warwick, 11 Will. III., a question in law\r\nupon evidence was put to the Judges; the statement of the question was\r\nmade in open court by the Lord High Steward, Lord Somers:--\"If there be\r\nsix in company, and one of them is killed, the other five are afterwards\r\nindicted, and three are tried and found guilty of manslaughter, and upon\r\ntheir prayers have their clergy allowed, and the burning in the hand is\r\nrespited, but not pardoned,--whether any of the three can be a witness\r\non the trial of the other two?\"\r\n\r\nLord Halifax.--\"I suppose your Lordships will have the opinion of the\r\nJudges upon this point: _and that must be in the presence of the\r\nprisoner_.\"\r\n\r\nLord High Steward (Lord Somers).--\"_It must certainly be in the presence\r\nof the prisoner_, if you ask the Judges' opinions.\"[20]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Lord Mohun was brought to trial upon an indictment for\r\nmurder. In this single trial a greater number of questions was put to\r\nthe Judges in matter of law than probably was ever referred to the\r\nJudges in all the collective body of trials, before or since that\r\nperiod. That trial, therefore, furnishes the largest body of authentic\r\nprecedents in this point to be found in the records of Parliament. The\r\nnumber of questions put to the Judges in this trial was twenty-three.\r\nThey all originated from the Peers themselves; yet the Court called upon\r\nthe party's counsel, as often as questions were proposed to be referred\r\nto the Judges, as well as on the counsel for the Crown, to argue every\r\none of them _before_ they went to those learned persons. Many of the\r\nquestions accordingly were argued at the bar at great length. The\r\nopinions were given and argued _in open court_. Peers frequently\r\ninsisted that the Judges should give their opinions _seriatim_, which\r\nthey did always publicly in the court, with great gravity and dignity,\r\nand greatly to the illustration of the law, as they held and acted upon\r\nit in their own courts.[21]\r\n\r\nIn Sacheverell's case (just cited for another purpose) the Earl of\r\nNottingham demanded whether he might not propose a question of law to\r\nthe Judges _in open court_. It was agreed to; and the Judges gave their\r\nanswer _in open court_, though this was after verdict given: and in\r\nconsequence of the advantage afforded to the prisoner in hearing _the\r\nopinion_ of the Judges, he was thereupon enabled to move in arrest of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe next precedent which your Committee finds of a question put by the\r\nLords, sitting as a court of judicature, to the Judges, pending the\r\ntrial, was in the 20th of George II., when Lord Balmerino, who was tried\r\non an indictment for high treason, having raised a doubt whether the\r\nevidence proved him to be at the place assigned for the overt act of\r\ntreason on the day laid in the indictment, the point was argued at the\r\nbar by the counsel for the Crown in the prisoner's presence, and for his\r\nsatisfaction. The prisoner, on hearing the argument, waived his\r\nobjection; but the then Lord President moving their Lordships to adjourn\r\nto the Chamber of Parliament, the Lords adjourned accordingly, and after\r\nsome time returning into Westminster Hall, the Lord High Steward (Lord\r\nHardwicke) said,--\r\n\r\n\"Your Lordships were pleased, in the Chamber of Parliament, to come to a\r\nresolution that the opinion of the learned and reverend Judges should be\r\ntaken on the following question, namely, Whether it is necessary that an\r\novert act of high treason should be proved to have been committed on the\r\nparticular day laid in the indictment? Is it your Lordships' pleasure\r\nthat the Judges do now give their opinion on that question?\"\r\n\r\nLords.--\"Ay, ay.\"\r\n\r\nLord High Steward.--\"My Lord Chief-Justice!\"\r\n\r\nLord Chief-Justice (Lord Chief-Justice Lee).--\"The question proposed by\r\nyour Lordships is, Whether it be necessary that an overt act of high\r\ntreason should be proved to be committed on the particular day laid in\r\nthe indictment? We are all of opinion that it is not necessary to prove\r\nthe overt act to be committed on the particular day laid in the\r\nindictment; but as evidence may be given of an overt act before the day,\r\nso it may be after the day specified in the indictment; for the day laid\r\nis circumstance and form only, and not material in point of proof: this\r\nis the known constant course of proceeding in trials.\"\r\n\r\nHere the case was made for the Judges, for the satisfaction of one of\r\nthe Peers, after the prisoner had waived his objection. Yet it was\r\nthought proper, as a matter of course and of right, that the Judges\r\nshould state the question put to them in the open court, and in presence\r\nof the prisoner,--and that in the same open manner, and in the same\r\npresence, their answer should be delivered.[22]\r\n\r\nYour Committee concludes their precedents begun under Lord Nottingham,\r\nand ended under Lord Hardwicke. They are of opinion that a body of\r\nprecedents so uniform, so accordant with principle, made in such times,\r\nand under the authority of a succession of such great men, ought not to\r\nhave been departed from. The single precedent to the contrary, to which\r\nyour Committee has alluded above, was on the trial of the Duchess of\r\nKingston, in the reign of his present Majesty. But in that instance the\r\nreasons of the Judges were, by order of the House, delivered in writing,\r\nand entered at length on the Journals:[23] so that the legal principle\r\nof the decision is equally to be found: which is not the case in any one\r\ninstance of the present impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nottingham, in Lord Cornwallis's case, conceived, though it\r\nwas proper and agreeable to justice, that this mode of putting questions\r\nto the Judges and receiving their answer in public was not supported by\r\nformer precedents; but he thought a book of authority had declared in\r\nfavor of this course. Your Committee is very sensible, that, antecedent\r\nto the great period to which they refer, there are instances of\r\nquestions having been put to the Judges privately. But we find the\r\n_principle_ of publicity (whatever variations from it there might be in\r\npractice) to have been so clearly established at a more early period,\r\nthat all the Judges of England resolved in Lord Morley's trial, in the\r\nyear 1666, (about twelve years before the observation of Lord\r\nNottingham,) _on a supposition that the trial should be actually\r\nconcluded, and the Lords retired to the Chamber of Parliament to consult\r\non their verdict_, that even in that case, (much stronger than the\r\nobservation of your Committee requires for its support,) if their\r\nopinions should then be demanded by the Peers, for the information of\r\ntheir private conscience, yet they determined that they should be given\r\nin public. This resolution is in itself so solemn, and is so bottomed on\r\nconstitutional principle and legal policy, that your Committee have\r\nthought fit to insert it _verbatim_ in their Report, as they relied upon\r\nit at the bar of the Court, when they contended for the same publicity.\r\n\r\n\"It was resolved, that, in case the Peers who are triers, _after the\r\nevidence given, and the prisoner withdrawn, and they gone to consult of\r\nthe verdict_, should desire to speak with any of the Judges, to have\r\ntheir opinion upon any point of law, that, if the Lord Steward spoke to\r\nus to go, we should go to them; but when the Lords asked us any\r\nquestion, we should not deliver any private opinion, but let them know\r\n_we were not to deliver any private opinion without conference with the\r\nrest of the Judges, and that to be done openly in court; and this\r\n(notwithstanding the precedent in the case of the Earl of Castlehaven)\r\nwas thought prudent in regard of ourselves, as well as for the avoiding\r\nsuspicion which might grow by private opinions: ALL resolutions of\r\nJudges being ALWAYS done in public_.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThe Judges in this resolution overruled the authority of the precedent,\r\nwhich militated against the whole spirit of their place and profession.\r\nTheir declaration was without reserve or exception, that \"_all_\r\nresolutions of the Judges are _always_ done in public.\" These Judges (as\r\nshould be remembered to their lasting honor) did not think it derogatory\r\nfrom their dignity, nor from their duty to the House of Lords, to take\r\nsuch measures concerning the publicity of their resolutions as should\r\nsecure them from suspicion. They knew that the mere circumstance of\r\nprivacy in a judicature, where any publicity is in use, tends to beget\r\nsuspicion and jealousy. Your Committee is of opinion that the honorable\r\npolicy of avoiding suspicion by avoiding privacy is not lessened by\r\nanything which exists in the present time and in the present trial.\r\n\r\nYour Committee has here to remark, that this learned Judge seemed to\r\nthink the case of Lord Audley (Castlehaven) to be more against him than\r\nin truth it was. The precedents were as follow. The opinions of the\r\nJudges were taken three times: the first time by the Attorney-General at\r\nSerjeants' Inn, antecedent to the trial; the last time, after the Peers\r\nhad retired to consult on their verdict; the middle time _was during the\r\ntrial itself_: and here the opinion was taken in open court, agreeably\r\nto what your Committee contends to have been the usage ever since this\r\nresolution of the Judges.[25] What was done before seemed to have passed\r\n_sub silentio_, and possibly through mere inadvertence.\r\n\r\nYour Committee observes, that the precedents by them relied on were\r\nfurnished from times in which the judicial proceedings in Parliament,\r\nand in all our courts, had obtained a very regular form. They were\r\nfurnished at a period in which Justice Blackstone remarks that more laws\r\nwere passed of importance to the rights and liberties of the subject\r\nthan in any other. These precedents lean all one way, and carry no marks\r\nof accommodation to the variable spirit of the times and of political\r\noccasions. They are the same before and after the Revolution. They are\r\nthe same through five reigns. The great men who presided in the\r\ntribunals which furnished these examples were in opposite political\r\ninterests, but all distinguished for their ability, integrity, and\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nottingham, who was the first on the bench to promulgate\r\nthis publicity as a rule, has not left us to seek the principle in the\r\ncase: that very learned man considers the publicity of the questions and\r\nanswers as a matter of justice, _and of justice favorable to the\r\nprisoner_. In the case of Mr. Hastings, the prisoner's counsel did not\r\njoin your Committee in their endeavors to obtain the publicity we\r\ndemanded. Their reasons we can only conjecture. But your Managers,\r\nacting for this House, were not the less bound to see that the due\r\nParliamentary course should be pursued, even when it is most favorable\r\nto those whom they impeach. If it should answer the purposes of one\r\nprisoner to waive the rights which belong to all prisoners, it was the\r\nduty of your Managers to protect those general rights against that\r\nparticular prisoner. It was still more their duty to endeavor that their\r\n_own_ questions should not be erroneously stated, or cases put which\r\nvaried from those which they argued, or opinions given in a manner not\r\nsupported by the spirit of our laws and institutions or by analogy with\r\nthe practice of all our courts.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, much in the dark about a matter in which it was so\r\nnecessary that they should receive every light, have heard, that, in\r\ndebating this matter abroad, it has been objected, that many of the\r\nprecedents on which we most relied were furnished in the courts of the\r\nLord High Steward, and not in trials where the Peers were Judges,--and\r\nthat the Lord High Steward not having it in his power to retire with the\r\njuror Peers, the Judges' opinions, from necessity, not from equity to\r\nthe parties, were given before that magistrate.\r\n\r\nYour Committee thinks it scarcely possible that the Lords could be\r\ninfluenced by such a feeble argument. For, admitting the fact to have\r\nbeen as supposed, there is no sort of reason why so uniform a course of\r\nprecedents, in a legal court composed of a peer for judge and peers for\r\ntriers, a course so favorable to all parties and to equal justice, a\r\ncourse in concurrence with the procedure of all our other courts, should\r\nnot have the greatest authority over their practice in every trial\r\nbefore _the whole body_ of the peerage.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nottingham, who acted as High Steward in one of these\r\ncommissions, certainly knew what he was saying. He gave no such reason.\r\nHis argument for the publicity of the Judges' opinions did not turn at\r\nall on the nature of his court, or of his office in that court. It\r\nrested on the equity of the principle, and on the fair dealing due to\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\nLord Somers was in no such court; yet his declaration is full as strong.\r\nHe does not, indeed, argue the point, as the Earl of Nottingham did,\r\nwhen he considered it as a new case. Lord Somers considers it as a\r\npoint quite settled, and no longer standing in need of being supported\r\nby reason or precedent.\r\n\r\nBut it is a mistake that the precedents stated in this Report are wholly\r\ndrawn from proceedings in that kind of court. Only two are cited which\r\nare furnished from a court constituted in the manner supposed. The rest\r\nwere in trials by all the peers, and not by a jury of peers with an High\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\nAfter long discussions with the Peers on this subject, \"the Lords'\r\ncommittees in a conference told them (the committee of this House,\r\nappointed to a conference on the matter) that the High Steward is but\r\nSpeaker _pro tempore_, and giveth his vote as well as the other lords:\r\nthis changeth not the nature of the court. And the Lords declared, that\r\nthey have power enough to proceed to trial, though the King should not\r\nname an High Steward.\" On the same day, \"it is declared and ordered by\r\nthe Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, that the\r\noffice of High Steward on trials of peers upon impeachments is not\r\nnecessary to the House of Peers, but that the Lords may proceed in such\r\ntrials, if an High Steward is not appointed according to their humble\r\ndesire.\"[26]\r\n\r\nTo put the matter out of all doubt, and to remove all jealousy on the\r\npart of the Commons, the commission of the Lord High Steward was then\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nThese rights, contended for by the Commons in their impeachments, and\r\nadmitted by the Peers, were asserted in the proceedings preparatory to\r\nthe trial of Lord Stafford, in which that long chain of uniform\r\nprecedents with regard to the publicity of the Judges' opinions in\r\ntrials begins.\r\n\r\nFor these last citations, and some of the remarks, your Committee are\r\nindebted to the learned and upright Justice Foster. They have compared\r\nthem with the Journals, and find them correct. The same excellent author\r\nproceeds to demonstrate that whatever he says of trials by impeachment\r\nis equally applicable to trials before the High Steward on indictment;\r\nand consequently, that there is no ground for a distinction, with regard\r\nto the public declaration of the Judges' opinions, founded on the\r\ninapplicability of either of these cases to the other. The argument on\r\nthis whole matter is so satisfactory that your Committee has annexed it\r\nat large to their Report.[27] As there is no difference in fact between\r\nthese trials, (especially since the act which provides that all the\r\npeers shall be summoned to the trial of a peer,) so there is no\r\ndifference in the reason and principle of the publicity, let the matter\r\nof the Steward's jurisdiction, be as it may.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICITY GENERAL.\r\n\r\nYour Committee do not find any positive law which binds the judges of\r\nthe courts in Westminster Hall publicly to give a reasoned opinion from\r\nthe bench, in support of their judgment upon matters that are stated\r\nbefore them. But the course hath prevailed from the oldest times. It\r\nhath been so general and so uniform, that it must be considered as the\r\nlaw of the land. It has prevailed, so far as we can discover, not only\r\nin all the courts which now exist, whether of law or equity, but in\r\nthose which have been suppressed or disused, such as the Court of Wards\r\nand the Star Chamber. An author quoted by Rushworth, speaking of the\r\nconstitution of that chamber, says,--\"And so it was resolved _by the\r\nJudges, on reference made to them; and their opinion, after deliberate\r\nhearing, and view of former precedents, was published in open\r\ncourt_.\"[28] It appears elsewhere in the same compiler that all their\r\nproceedings were public, even in deliberating previous to judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Judges in their reasonings have always been used to observe on the\r\narguments employed by the counsel on either side, and on the authorities\r\ncited by them,--assigning the grounds for rejecting the authorities\r\nwhich they reject, or for adopting those to which they adhere, or for a\r\ndifferent construction of law, according to the occasion. This\r\npublicity, not only of decision, but of deliberation, is not confined to\r\ntheir several courts, whether of law or equity, whether above or at Nisi\r\nPrius; but it prevails where they are assembled, in the Exchequer\r\nChamber, or at Serjeants' Inn, or wherever matters come before the\r\nJudges collectively for consultation and revision. It seems to your\r\nCommittee to be moulded in the essential frame and constitution of\r\nBritish judicature. Your Committee conceives that the English\r\njurisprudence has not any other sure foundation, nor, consequently, the\r\nlives and properties of the subject any sure hold, but in the maxims,\r\nrules, and principles, and juridical traditionary line of decisions\r\ncontained in the notes taken, and from time to time published, (mostly\r\nunder the sanction of the Judges,) called Reports.\r\n\r\nIn the early periods of the law it appears to your Committee that a\r\ncourse still better had been pursued, but grounded on the same\r\nprinciples; and that no other cause than the multiplicity of business\r\nprevented its continuance. \"Of ancient time,\" says Lord Coke, \"in cases\r\nof difficulties, either criminal or civil, _the reasons and causes_ of\r\nthe judgment were set down _upon the record_, and so continued in the\r\nreigns of Ed. I. and Ed. II., and then there was no need of reports; but\r\nin the reign of Ed. III. (when the law was in its height) the causes and\r\nreasons of judgments, in respect of the multitude of them, are not set\r\ndown in the record, but then _the great casuists and reporters of cases_\r\n(certain grave and sad men) published the cases, _and the reasons and\r\ncauses of the judgments or resolutions_, which, from the beginning of\r\nthe reign of Ed. III. and since, we have in print. But these also,\r\nthough of great credit and excellent use in their kind, _yet far\r\nunderneath the authority of the Parliament Rolls, reporting the acts,\r\njudgments, and resolutions of that highest court_.\"[29]\r\n\r\nReports, though of a kind less authentic than the Year Books, to which\r\nCoke alludes, have continued without interruption to the time in which\r\nwe live. It is well known that the elementary treatises of law, and the\r\ndogmatical treatises of English jurisprudence, whether they appear under\r\nthe names of institutes, digests, or commentaries, do not rest on the\r\nauthority of the supreme power, like the books called the Institute,\r\nDigest, Code, and authentic collations in the Roman law. With us\r\ndoctrinal books of that description have little or no authority, other\r\nthan as they are supported by the adjudged cases and reasons given at\r\none time or other from the bench; and to these they constantly refer.\r\nThis appears in Coke's Institutes, in Comyns's Digest, and in all books\r\nof that nature. To give judgment privately is to put an end to reports;\r\nand to put an end to reports is to put an end to the law of England. It\r\nwas fortunate for the Constitution of this kingdom, that, in the\r\njudicial proceedings in the case of ship-money, the Judges did not then\r\nventure to depart from the ancient course. They gave and they argued\r\ntheir judgment in open court.[30] Their reasons were publicly given, and\r\nthe reasons assigned for their judgment took away all its authority. The\r\ngreat historian, Lord Clarendon, at that period a young lawyer, has told\r\nus that the Judges gave as law from the bench what every man in the hall\r\nknew not to be law.\r\n\r\nThis publicity, and this mode of attending the decision with its\r\ngrounds, is observed not only in the tribunals where the Judges preside\r\nin a judicial capacity, individually or collectively, but where they are\r\nconsulted by the Peers on the law in all _writs of error_ brought from\r\nbelow. In the opinion they give of the matter assigned as error, one at\r\nleast of the Judges argues the questions at large. He argues them\r\npublicly, though in the Chamber of Parliament,--and in such a manner,\r\nthat every professor, practitioner, or student of the law, as well as\r\nthe parties to the suit, may learn the opinions of all the Judges of all\r\nthe courts upon those points in which the Judges in one court might be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nYour Committee is of opinion that nothing better could be devised by\r\nhuman wisdom than argued judgments publicly delivered for preserving\r\nunbroken the great traditionary body of the law, and for marking,\r\nwhilst that great body remained unaltered, every variation in the\r\napplication and the construction of particular parts, for pointing out\r\nthe ground of each variation, and for enabling the learned of the bar\r\nand all intelligent laymen to distinguish those changes made for the\r\nadvancement of a more solid, equitable, and substantial justice,\r\naccording to the variable nature of human affairs, a progressive\r\nexperience, and the improvement of moral philosophy, from those\r\nhazardous changes in any of the ancient opinions and decisions which may\r\narise from ignorance, from levity, from false refinement, from a spirit\r\nof innovation, or from other motives, of a nature not more justifiable.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, finding this course of proceeding to be concordant with\r\nthe character and spirit of our judicial proceeding, continued from time\r\nimmemorial, supported by arguments of sound theory, and confirmed by\r\neffects highly beneficial, could not see without uneasiness, in this\r\ngreat trial for Indian offences, a marked innovation. Against their\r\nreiterated requests, remonstrances, and protestations, the opinions of\r\nthe Judges were always taken secretly. Not only the constitutional\r\npublicity for which we contend was refused to the request and entreaty\r\nof your Committee, but when a noble peer, on the 24th day of June, 1789,\r\ndid in open court declare that he would then propose some questions to\r\nthe Judges in that place, and hoped to receive their answer openly,\r\naccording to the approved good customs of that and of other courts, the\r\nLords instantly put a stop to the further proceeding by an immediate\r\nadjournment to the Chamber of Parliament. Upon this adjournment, we find\r\nby the Lords' Journals, that the House, on being resumed, ordered, that\r\n\"it should resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, on\r\nMonday next, to take into consideration what is the proper manner of\r\nputting questions by the Lords to the Judges, and of their answering the\r\nsame, in judicial proceedings.\" The House did thereon resolve itself\r\ninto a committee, from which the Earl of Galloway, on the 29th of the\r\nsame month, reported as follows:--\"That the House has, in the trial of\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, proceeded in a regular course, in the manner\r\nof propounding their questions to the Judges in the Chamber of\r\nParliament, and in receiving their answers to them in the same place.\"\r\nThe resolution was agreed to by the Lords; but the protest as below[31]\r\nwas entered thereupon, and supported by strong arguments.\r\n\r\nYour Committee remark, that this resolution states only, that the House\r\nhad proceeded, in this secret manner of propounding questions to the\r\nJudges and of receiving their answers, during the trial, and on matters\r\nof debate between the parties, \"in a regular course.\" It does not\r\nassert that another course would not have been _as_ regular. It does not\r\nstate either judicial convenience, principle, or body of precedents for\r\nthat _regular course_. No such body of precedents appear on the Journal,\r\nthat we could discover. Seven-and-twenty, at least, in a regular series,\r\nare directly contrary to this regular course. Since the era of the 29th\r\nof June, 1789, no one question has been admitted to go publicly to the\r\nJudges.\r\n\r\nThis determined and systematic privacy was the more alarming to your\r\nCommittee, because the questions did not (except in that case) originate\r\nfrom the Lords for the direction of their own conscience. These\r\nquestions, in some material instances, were not made or allowed by the\r\nparties at the bar, nor settled in open court, but differed materially\r\nfrom what your Managers contended was the true state of the question, as\r\nput and argued by them. They were such as the Lords thought proper to\r\nstate for them. Strong remonstrances produced some alteration in this\r\nparticular; but even after these remonstrances, several questions were\r\nmade on statements which the Managers never made nor admitted.\r\n\r\nYour Committee does not know of any precedent before this, in which the\r\nPeers, on a proposal of the Commons, or of a less weighty person before\r\ntheir court, to have the cases publicly referred to the Judges, and\r\ntheir arguments and resolutions delivered in their presence, absolutely\r\nrefused. The very few precedents of such private reference on trials\r\nhave been made, as we have observed already, _sub silentio_, and without\r\nany observation from the parties. In the precedents we produce, the\r\ndetermination is accompanied with its reasons, and the publicity is\r\nconsidered as the clear, undoubted right of the parties.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, using their best diligence, have never been able to form\r\na clear opinion upon the ground and principle of these decisions. The\r\nmere result, upon each case decided by the Lords, furnished them with no\r\nlight, from any principle, precedent, or foregone authority of law or\r\nreason, to guide them with regard to the next matter of evidence which\r\nthey had to offer, or to discriminate what matter ought to be urged or\r\nto be set aside: your Committee not being able to divine whether the\r\nparticular evidence, which, upon a conjectural principle, they might\r\nchoose to abandon, would not appear to this House, and to the judging\r\nworld at large, to be admissible, and possibly decisive proof. In these\r\nstraits, they had and have no choice, but either wholly to abandon the\r\nprosecution, and of consequence to betray the trust reposed in them by\r\nthis House, or to bring forward such matter of evidence as they are\r\nfurnished with from sure sources of authenticity, and which in their\r\njudgment, aided by the best advice they could obtain, is possessed of a\r\nmoral aptitude juridically to prove or to illustrate the case which the\r\nHouse had given them, in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF PUTTING THE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen your Committee came to examine into those private opinions of the\r\nJudges, they found, to their no small concern, that the mode both of\r\nputting the questions to the Judges, and their answers, was still more\r\nunusual and unprecedented than the privacy with which those questions\r\nwere given and resolved.\r\n\r\nThis mode strikes, as we apprehend, at the vital privileges of the\r\nHouse. For, with the single exception of the first question put to the\r\nJudges in 1788, the case being stated, the questions are raised\r\ndirectly, specifically, and by name, on those privileges: that is, _What\r\nevidence is it competent for the Managers of the House of Commons to\r\nproduce?_ We conceive that it was not proper, _nor justified by a single\r\nprecedent_, to refer to the Judges of the inferior courts any question,\r\nand still less for them to decide in their answer, of what is or is not\r\ncompetent for the House of Commons, or for any committee acting under\r\ntheir authority, to do or not to do, in any instance or respect\r\nwhatsoever. This new and unheard-of course can have no other effect than\r\nto subject to the discretion of the Judges the Law of Parliament and the\r\nprivileges of the House of Commons, and in a great measure the judicial\r\nprivileges of the Peers themselves: any intermeddling in which on their\r\npart we conceive to be a dangerous and unwarrantable assumption of\r\npower. It is contrary to what has been declared by Lord Coke himself,\r\nin a passage before quoted, to be the duty of the Judges,--and to what\r\nthe Judges of former times have confessed to be their duty, on occasions\r\nto which he refers in the time of Henry VI. And we are of opinion that\r\nthe conduct of those sages of the law, and others their successors, who\r\nhave been thus diffident and cautious in giving their opinions upon\r\nmatters concerning Parliament, and particularly on the privileges of the\r\nHouse of Commons, was laudable in the example, and ought to be followed:\r\nparticularly the principles upon which the Judges declined to give their\r\nopinions in the year 1614. It appears by the Journals of the Lords, that\r\na question concerning the law relative to impositions having been put to\r\nthe Judges, the proceeding was as follows. \"Whether the Lords the Judges\r\nshall be heard deliver their opinion touching the point of impositions,\r\nbefore further consideration be had of answer to be returned to the\r\nlower House concerning the message from them lately received. Whereupon\r\nthe number of the Lords requiring to hear the Judges' opinions by saying\r\n'_Content_' exceeding the others which said '_Non Content_,' the Lords\r\nthe Judges, so desiring, were permitted to withdraw themselves into the\r\nLord Chancellor's private rooms, where having remained awhile and\r\nadvised together, they returned into the House, and, having taken their\r\nplaces, and standing discovered, did, by the mouth of the Lord\r\nChief-Justice of the King's Bench, humbly desire to be forborne at this\r\ntime, in this place, to deliver any opinion in this case, for many\r\nweighty and important reasons, which his Lordship delivered with great\r\ngravity and eloquence; concluding that himself and his brethren are upon\r\nparticulars in judicial course to speak and judge between the King's\r\nMajesty and his people, and likewise between his Highness's subjects,\r\nand in no case to be disputants on any side.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee do not find anything which, through inadvertence or\r\ndesign, had a tendency to subject the law and course of Parliament to\r\nthe opinions of the Judges of the inferior courts, from that period\r\nuntil the 1st of James II. The trial of Lord Delamere for high treason\r\nwas had by special commission before the Lord High Steward: it was\r\nbefore the act which directs that _all_ peers should be summoned to such\r\ntrials. This was not a trial in full Parliament, in which case it was\r\nthen contended for that the Lord High Steward was the judge of the law,\r\npresiding in the Court, but had no vote in the verdict, and that the\r\nLords were triers only, and had no vote in the judgment of law. This was\r\nlooked on as the course, where the trial was not in full Parliament, in\r\nwhich latter case there was no doubt but that the Lord High Steward made\r\na part of the body of the triers, and that the whole House was the\r\njudge.[32] In this cause, after the evidence for the Crown had been\r\nclosed, the prisoner prayed the Court to adjourn. The Lord High Steward\r\ndoubted his power to take that step in that stage of the trial; and the\r\nquestion was, \"Whether, the trial not being in full Parliament, when the\r\nprisoner is upon his trial, and evidence for the King is given, the\r\nLords being (as it may be termed) charged with the prisoner, the Peers\r\nmay separate for a time, which is the consequence of an adjournment?\"\r\nThe Lord High Steward doubted of his power to adjourn the Court. The\r\ncase was evidently new, and his Grace proposed to have the opinion of\r\nthe Judges upon it. The Judges in consequence offering to withdraw into\r\nthe Exchequer Chamber, Lord Falconberg \"insisted that the question\r\nconcerned the privilege of the Peerage only, and conceived that _the\r\nJudges are not concerned to make any determination in that matter; and\r\nbeing such a point of privilege, certainly the inferior courts have no\r\nright to determine it_.\" It was insisted, therefore, that the Lords\r\ntriers should retire with the Judges. The Lord High Steward thought\r\ndifferently, and opposed this motion; but finding the other opinion\r\ngenerally prevalent, he gave way, and the Lords triers retired, taking\r\nthe Judges to their consult. When the Judges returned, they delivered\r\ntheir opinion in _open court_. Lord Chief-Justice Herbert spoke for\r\nhimself and the rest of the Judges. After observing on the novelty of\r\nthe case, with a temperate and becoming reserve with regard to the\r\nrights of Parliaments, he marked out the limits of the office of the\r\ninferior Judges on such occasions, and declared,--\"_All that we, the\r\nJudges, can do is to acquaint your Grace and the noble Lords what the\r\nlaw is in the inferior courts in cases of the like nature_, and the\r\nreason of the law in those points, and _then leave the jurisdiction of\r\nthe court to its proper judgment_.\" The Chief-Justice concluded his\r\nstatement of the usage below, and his observations on the difference of\r\nthe cases of a peer tried in full Parliament and by a special\r\ncommission, in this manner:--\"Upon the whole matter, my Lords, whether\r\nthe Peers being judges in the one and not in the other instance alters\r\nthe case, or whether the reason of the law in inferior courts why the\r\njury are not permitted to separate until they have discharged\r\nthemselves of their verdict may have any influence on this case, _where\r\nthat reason seems to fail_, the prisoner being to be tried by men of\r\nunquestionable honor, _we cannot presume so far as to make any\r\ndetermination, in a case which is both new to us and of great\r\nconsequence in itself_; but think it the proper way for _us_, having\r\nlaid matters as we conceive them before your Grace and my Lords, _to\r\nsubmit the jurisdiction of your own court to your own determination_.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to your Committee, that the Lords, who stood against\r\nsubmitting the course of their high court to the inferior Judges, and\r\nthat the Judges, who, with a legal and constitutional discretion,\r\ndeclined giving any opinion in this matter, acted as became them; and\r\nyour Committee sees no reason why the Peers at this day should be less\r\nattentive to the rights of their court with regard to an exclusive\r\njudgment on their own proceedings or to the rights of the Commons acting\r\nas accusers for the whole commons of Great Britain in that court, or why\r\nthe Judges should be less reserved in deciding upon any of these points\r\nof high Parliamentary privilege, than the Judges of that and the\r\npreceding periods. This present case is a proceeding in full Parliament,\r\nand not like the case under the commission in the time of James II., and\r\nstill more evidently out of the province of Judges in the inferior\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nAll the precedents previous to the trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire,\r\nseem to your Committee to be uniform. The Judges had constantly refused\r\nto give an opinion on any of the powers, privileges, or competencies of\r\neither House. But in the present instance your Committee has found, with\r\ngreat concern, a further matter of innovation. Hitherto the constant\r\npractice has been to put questions to the Judges but in the three\r\nfollowing ways: as, 1st, A question of pure abstract law, without\r\nreference to any case, or merely upon an A.B. case stated to them; 2dly,\r\nTo the legal construction of some act of Parliament; 3dly, To report the\r\ncourse of proceeding in the courts below upon an abstract case. Besides\r\nthese three, your Committee knows not of a single example of any sort,\r\nduring the course of any judicial proceeding at the bar of the House of\r\nLords, whether the prosecution has been by indictment, by information\r\nfrom the Attorney-General, or by impeachment of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn the present trial, the Judges appear to your Committee not to have\r\ngiven their judgment on points of law, stated as such, but to have in\r\neffect tried the cause, in the whole course of it,--with one instance to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nThe Lords have stated no question of general law, no question on the\r\nconstruction of an act of Parliament, no question concerning the\r\npractice of the courts below. _They put the whole gross case and matter\r\nin question, with all its circumstances, to the Judges._ They have, _for\r\nthe first time_, demanded of them what particular person, paper, or\r\ndocument ought or ought not to be produced before them by the Managers\r\nfor the Commons of Great Britain: for instance, whether, under such an\r\narticle, the Bengal Consultations of such a day, the examination of\r\nRajah Nundcomar, and the like. The operation of this method is in\r\nsubstance not only to make the Judges masters of the whole process and\r\nconduct of the trial, but through that medium to transfer to them the\r\nultimate judgment on the cause itself and its merits.\r\n\r\nThe Judges attendant on the Court of Peers hitherto have not been\r\nsupposed to know the particulars and minute circumstances of the cause,\r\nand must therefore be incompetent to determine upon those circumstances.\r\nThe evidence taken, is not, of course, that we can find, delivered to\r\nthem; nor do we find that in fact any order has been made for that\r\npurpose, even supposing that the evidence could at all regularly be put\r\nbefore them. They are present in court, not to hear the trial, but\r\nsolely to advise in matter of law; they cannot take upon themselves to\r\nsay anything about the Bengal Consultations, or to know anything of\r\nRajah Nundcomar, of Kelleram, or of Mr. Francis, or Sir John Clavering.\r\n\r\nThat the House may be the more fully enabled to judge of the nature and\r\ntendency of thus putting the question, _specifically, and on the gross\r\ncase_, your Committee thinks fit here to insert one of those questions,\r\nreserving a discussion of its particular merits to another place. It was\r\nstated on the 22d of April, 1790, \"On that day the Managers proposed to\r\nshow that Kelleram fell into great balances with the East India Company,\r\nin consequence of his appointment.\" It is so stated in the printed\r\nMinutes (p. 1206). But the real tendency and gist of the proposition is\r\nnot shown. However, the question was put, \"Whether it be or be not\r\ncompetent _to the Managers for the Commons to give evidence upon the\r\ncharge in the sixth article, to prove_ that the rent [at?] which the\r\ndefendant, Warren Hastings, Esquire, let the lands mentioned in the said\r\nsixth article of charge to Kelleram fell into arrear and was deficient;\r\nand whether, if proof were offered that the rent fell into arrear\r\nimmediately after the letting, the evidence in that case would be\r\ncompetent?\" The Judges answered, on the 27th of the said month, as\r\nfollows:--\"_It is not competent for the Managers for the House of\r\nCommons_ to give evidence upon the charge in the sixth article, to prove\r\nthat the rent at which the defendant, Warren Hastings, let the lands\r\n[mentioned?] in the said sixth article of charge to Kelleram fell into\r\narrear and was deficient.\"\r\n\r\nThe House will observe that on the question two cases of competence were\r\nput: the first, on the competence of Managers for the House of Commons\r\nto give the evidence supposed to be offered by them, but which we deny\r\nto have been offered in the manner and for the purpose assumed in this\r\nquestion; the second is in a shape apparently more abstracted, and more\r\nnearly approaching to Parliamentary regularity,--on the competence of\r\nthe evidence itself, in the case of a supposed circumstance being\r\nsuperadded. The Judges answered only the first, denying flatly the\r\ncompetence of the Managers. As to the second, the competence of the\r\nsupposed evidence, they are profoundly silent. Having given this blow to\r\nour competence, about the other question, (which was more within their\r\nprovince,) namely, the competence of evidence on a case hypothetically\r\nstated, they give themselves no trouble. The Lords on that occasion\r\nrejected the whole evidence. On the face of the Judges' opinion it is a\r\ndetermination _on a case_, the trial of which was not with them, but it\r\ncontains _no rule or principle of law_, to which alone it was their duty\r\nto speak.[33]\r\n\r\nThese essential innovations tend, as your Committee conceives, to make\r\nan entire alteration in the constitution and in the purposes of the High\r\nCourt of Parliament, and even to reverse the ancient relations between\r\nthe Lords and the Judges. They tend wholly to take away from the Commons\r\nthe benefit of making good their case before the proper judges, and\r\nsubmit this high inquest to the inferior courts.\r\n\r\nYour Committee sees no reason why, on the same principles and\r\nprecedents, the Lords may not terminate their proceedings in this, and\r\nin all future trials, by sending the whole body of evidence taken before\r\nthem, in the shape of a special verdict, to the Judges, and may not\r\ndemand of them, whether they ought, on the whole matter, to acquit or\r\ncondemn the prisoner; nor can we discover any cause that should hinder\r\nthem [the Judges] from deciding on the accumulative body of the evidence\r\nas hitherto they have done in its parts, and from dictating the\r\nexistence or non-existence of a misdemeanor or other crime in the\r\nprisoner as they think fit, without any more reference to principle or\r\nprecedent of law than hitherto they have thought proper to apply in\r\ndetermining on the several parcels of this cause.\r\n\r\nYour Committee apprehends that very serious inconveniencies and\r\nmischiefs may hereafter arise from a practice in the House of Lords of\r\nconsidering itself as unable to act without the judges of the inferior\r\ncourts, of implicitly following their dictates, of adhering with a\r\nliteral precision to the very words of their responses, and putting them\r\nto decide on the competence of the Managers for the Commons, the\r\ncompetence of the evidence to be produced, who are to be permitted to\r\nappear, what questions are to be asked of witnesses, and indeed, parcel\r\nby parcel, on the whole of the gross case before them,--as well as to\r\ndetermine upon the order, method, and process of every part of their\r\nproceedings. The judges of the inferior courts are by law rendered\r\nindependent of the Crown. But this, instead of a benefit to the subject,\r\nwould be a grievance, if no way was left of producing a responsibility.\r\nIf the Lords cannot or will not act without the Judges, and if (which\r\nGod forbid!) the Commons should find it at any time hereafter necessary\r\nto impeach them before the Lords, this House would find the Lords\r\ndisabled in their functions, fearful of giving any judgment on matter of\r\nlaw or admitting any proof of fact without them [the Judges]; and having\r\nonce assumed the rule of proceeding and practice below as their rule,\r\nthey must at every instant resort, for their means of judging, to the\r\nauthority of those whom they are appointed to judge.\r\n\r\nYour Committee must always act with regard to men as they are. There are\r\nno privileges or exemptions from the infirmities of our common nature.\r\nWe are sensible that all men, and without any evil intentions, will\r\nnaturally wish to extend their own jurisdiction, and to weaken all the\r\npower by which they may be limited and controlled. It is the business of\r\nthe House of Commons to counteract this tendency. This House had given\r\nto its Managers no power to abandon its privileges and the rights of its\r\nconstituents. They were themselves as little disposed as authorized to\r\nmake this surrender. They are members of this House, not only charged\r\nwith the management of this impeachment, but partaking of a general\r\ntrust inseparable from the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament\r\nassembled, one of whose principal functions and duties it is to be\r\nobservant of the courts of justice, and to take due care that none of\r\nthem, from the lowest to the highest, shall pursue new courses, unknown\r\nto the laws and constitution, of this kingdom, or to equity, sound legal\r\npolicy, or substantial justice. Your Committee were not sent into\r\nWestminster Hall for the purpose of contributing in their persons, and\r\nunder the authority of the House, to change the course or law of\r\nParliament, which had continued unquestioned for at least four hundred\r\nyears. Neither was it any part of their mission to suffer precedents to\r\nbe established, with relation to the law and rule of evidence, which\r\ntended in their opinion to shut up forever all the avenues to justice.\r\nThey were not to consider a rule of evidence as a means of concealment.\r\nThey were not, without a struggle, to suffer any subtleties to prevail\r\nwhich would render a process in Parliament, not the terror, but the\r\nprotection, of all the fraud and violence arising from the abuse of\r\nBritish power in the East. Accordingly, your Managers contended with all\r\ntheir might, as their predecessors in the same place had contended with\r\nmore ability and learning, but not with more zeal and more firmness,\r\nagainst those dangerous innovations, as they were successively\r\nintroduced: they held themselves bound constantly to protest, and in one\r\nor two instances they did protest, in discourses of considerable length,\r\nagainst those private, and, for what they could find, unargued judicial\r\nopinions, which must, as they fear, introduce by degrees the miserable\r\nservitude which exists where the law is uncertain or unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBATES ON EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe chief debates at the bar, and the decisions of the Judges, (which we\r\nfind in all cases implicitly adopted, in all their extent and without\r\nqualification, by the Lords,) turned upon _evidence_. Your Committee,\r\nbefore the trial began, were apprised, by discourses which prudence did\r\nnot permit them to neglect, that endeavors would be used to embarrass\r\nthem in their proceedings by exceptions against evidence; that the\r\njudgments and opinions of the courts below would be resorted to on this\r\nsubject; that there the rules of evidence were precise, rigorous, and\r\ninflexible; and that the counsel for the criminal would endeavor to\r\nintroduce the same rules, with the same severity and exactness, into\r\nthis trial. Your Committee were fully assured, and were resolved\r\nstrenuously to contend, that no doctrine or rule of law, much less the\r\npractice of any court, ought to have weight or authority in Parliament,\r\nfurther than as such doctrine, rule, or practice is agreeable to the\r\nproceedings in Parliament, or hath received the sanction of approved\r\nprecedent there, or is founded on the immutable principles of\r\nsubstantial justice, without which, your Committee readily agrees, no\r\npractice in any court, high or low, is proper or fit to be maintained.\r\n\r\nIn this preference of the rules observed in the High Court of\r\nParliament, preëminently superior to all the rest, there is no claim\r\nmade which the inferior courts do not make, each with regard to itself.\r\nIt is well known that the rules of proceedings in these courts vary, and\r\nsome of them very essentially; yet the usage of each court is the law of\r\nthe court, and it would be vain to object to any rule in any court,\r\nthat it is not the rule of another court. For instance: as a general\r\nrule, the Court of King's Bench, on trials by jury, cannot receive\r\ndepositions, but must judge by testimony _vivâ voce_. The rule of the\r\nCourt of Chancery is not only not the same, but it is the reverse, and\r\nLord Hardwicke ruled accordingly. \"The constant and established\r\nproceedings of this Court,\" said this great magistrate, \"are on written\r\nevidence, like the proceedings on the Civil and Canon Law. This is the\r\ncourse of the Court, and the course of the Court is the law of the\r\nCourt.\"[34]\r\n\r\nYour Managers were convinced that one of the principal reasons for which\r\nthis cause was brought into Parliament was the danger that in inferior\r\ncourts their rule would be formed naturally upon their ordinary\r\nexperience, and the exigencies of the cases which in ordinary course\r\ncame before them. This experience, and the exigencies of these cases,\r\nextend little further than the concerns of a people comparatively in a\r\nnarrow vicinage, a people of the same or nearly the same language,\r\nreligion, manners, laws, and habits: with them an intercourse of every\r\nkind was easy.\r\n\r\nThese rules of law in most cases, and the practice of the courts in all,\r\ncould not be easily applicable to a people separated from Great Britain\r\nby a very great part of the globe,--separated by manners, by principles\r\nof religion, and of inveterate habits as strong as nature itself, still\r\nmore than by the circumstance of local distance. Such confined and\r\ninapplicable rules would be convenient, indeed, to oppression, to\r\nextortion, bribery, and corruption, but ruinous to the people, whose\r\nprotection is the true object of all tribunals and of all their rules.\r\nEven English judges in India, who have been sufficiently tenacious of\r\nwhat they considered as the rules of English courts, were obliged in\r\nmany points, and particularly with regard to evidence, to relax very\r\nconsiderably, as the civil and politic government has been obliged to do\r\nin several other cases, on account of insuperable difficulties arising\r\nfrom a great diversity of manners, and from what may be considered as a\r\ndiversity even in the very constitution of their minds,--instances of\r\nwhich your Committee will subjoin in a future Appendix.\r\n\r\nAnother great cause why your Committee conceived this House had chosen\r\nto proceed in the High Court of Parliament was because the inferior\r\ncourts were habituated, with very few exceptions, to try men for the\r\nabuse only of their individual and natural powers, which can extend but\r\na little way.[35] Before them, offences, whether of fraud or violence or\r\nboth, are, for much the greater part, charged upon persons of mean and\r\nobscure condition. Those unhappy persons are so far from being supported\r\nby men of rank and influence, that the whole weight and force of the\r\ncommunity is directed against them. In this case, they are in general\r\nobjects of protection as well as of punishment; and the course perhaps\r\nought, as it is _commonly_ said to be, not to suffer anything to be\r\napplied to their conviction beyond what the strictest rules will permit.\r\nBut in the cause which your Managers have in charge the circumstances\r\nare the very reverse to what happens in the cases of mere personal\r\ndelinquency which come before the [inferior] courts. These courts have\r\nnot before them persons who act, and who justify their acts, by the\r\nnature of a despotical and arbitrary power. The abuses stated in our\r\nimpeachment are not those of mere individual, natural faculties, but the\r\nabuses of civil and political authority. The offence is that of one who\r\nhas carried with him, in the perpetration of his crimes, whether of\r\nviolence or of fraud, the whole force of the state,--who, in the\r\nperpetration and concealment of offences, has had the advantage of all\r\nthe means and powers given to government for the detection and\r\npunishment of guilt and for the protection of the people. The people\r\nthemselves, on whose behalf the Commons of Great Britain take up this\r\nremedial and protecting prosecution, are naturally timid. Their spirits\r\nare broken by the arbitrary power usurped over them, and claimed by the\r\ndelinquent as his law. They are ready to flatter the power which they\r\ndread. They are apt to look for favor [from their governors] by covering\r\nthose vices in the predecessor which they fear the successor may be\r\ndisposed to imitate. They have reason to consider complaints as means,\r\nnot of redress, but of aggravation to their sufferings; and when they\r\nshall ultimately hear that the nature of the British laws and the rules\r\nof its tribunals are such as by no care or study either they, or even\r\nthe Commons of Great Britain, who take up their cause, can comprehend,\r\nbut which in effect and operation leave them unprotected, and render\r\nthose who oppress them secure in their spoils, they must think still\r\nworse of British justice than of the arbitrary power of the Company's\r\nservants which hath been exercised to their destruction. They will be\r\nforever, what for the greater part they have hitherto been, inclined to\r\ncompromise with the corruption of the magistrates, as a screen against\r\nthat violence from which the laws afford them no redress.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons your Committee did and do strongly contend that the\r\nCourt of Parliament ought to be open with great facility to the\r\nproduction of all evidence, except that which the precedents of\r\nParliament teach them authoritatively to reject, or which hath no sort\r\nof natural aptitude directly or circumstantially to prove the case. They\r\nhave been and are invariably of opinion that the Lords ought _to\r\nenlarge, and not to contrast, the rules of evidence, according to the\r\nnature and difficulties of the case_, for redress to the injured, for\r\nthe punishment of oppression, for the detection of fraud,--and above\r\nall, to prevent, what is the greatest dishonor to all laws and to all\r\ntribunals, the failure of justice. To prevent the last of these evils\r\nall courts in this and all countries have constantly made all their\r\nmaxims and principles concerning testimony to conform; although such\r\ncourts have been bound undoubtedly by stricter rules, both of form and\r\nof prescript cases, than the sovereign jurisdiction exercised by the\r\nLords on the impeachment of the Commons ever has been or ever ought to\r\nbe. Therefore your Committee doth totally reject any rules by which the\r\npractice of any inferior court is affirmed as a directory guide to an\r\nhigher, especially where the forms and the powers of the judicature are\r\ndifferent, and the objects of judicial inquiry are not the same.\r\n\r\nYour Committee conceives that the trial of a cause is not in the\r\narguments or disputations of the prosecutors and the counsel, but in\r\n_the evidence_, and that to refuse evidence is to refuse to hear the\r\ncause: nothing, therefore, but the most clear and weighty reasons ought\r\nto preclude its production. Your Committee conceives, that, when\r\nevidence on the face of it relevant, that is, connected with the party\r\nand the charge, was denied to be competent, _the burden lay upon those\r\nwho opposed it_ to set forth the authorities, whether of positive\r\nstatute, known recognized maxims and principles of law, passages in an\r\naccredited institute, code, digest, or systematic treatise of laws, or\r\nsome adjudged cases, wherein, the courts have rejected evidence of that\r\nnature. No such thing ever (except in one instance, to which we shall\r\nhereafter speak) was produced at the bar, nor (that we know of) produced\r\nby the Lords in their debates, or by the Judges in the opinions by them\r\ndelivered. Therefore, for anything which as yet appears to your\r\nCommittee to the contrary, these responses and decisions were, in many\r\nof the points, not the determinations of any law whatsoever, but mere\r\narbitrary decrees, to which we could not without solemn protestation,\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, at an early period, and frequently since the\r\ncommencement of this trial, have neglected no means of research which\r\nmight afford them information concerning these supposed strict and\r\ninflexible rules of proceeding and of evidence, which, appeared to them,\r\ndestructive of all the means and ends of justice: and, first, they\r\nexamined carefully the Rolls and Journals of the House of Lords, as also\r\nthe printed trials of cases before that court.\r\n\r\nYour Committee finds but one instance, in the whole course of\r\nParliamentary impeachments, in which evidence offered by the Commons has\r\nbeen rejected on the plea of inadmissibility or incompetence. This was\r\nin the case of Lord Strafford's trial; when the copy of a warrant (the\r\nsame not having any attestation to authenticate it as a true copy) was,\r\non deliberation, not admitted,--and your Committee thinks, as the case\r\nstood, with reason. But even in this one instance the Lords seemed to\r\nshow a marked anxiety not to narrow too much the admissibility of\r\nevidence; for they confined their determination \"to this individual\r\ncase,\" as the Lord Steward reported their resolution; and he\r\nadds,--\"They conceive this could be no impediment or failure in the\r\nproceeding, because the truth and verity of it would depend on the first\r\ngeneral power given to execute it, which they who manage the evidence\r\nfor the Commons say they could prove.\"[36] Neither have objections to\r\nevidence offered by the prisoner been very frequently made, nor often\r\nallowed when made. In the same case of Lord Strafford, two books\r\nproduced by his Lordship, without proof by whom they were written, were\r\nrejected, (and on a clear principle,) \"as being private books, and no\r\nrecords.\"[37] On both these occasions, the questions were determined by\r\nthe Lords alone, without any resort to the opinions of the Judges. In\r\nthe impeachments of Lord Stafford, Dr. Sacheverell, and Lord Wintoun, no\r\nobjection to evidence appears in the Lords' Journals to have been\r\npressed, and not above one taken, which was on the part of the Managers.\r\n\r\nSeveral objections were, indeed, taken to evidence in Lord\r\nMacclesfield's trial.[38] They were made on the part of the Managers,\r\nexcept in two instances, where the objections were made by the witnesses\r\nthemselves. They were all determined (those started by the Managers in\r\ntheir favor) by the Lords themselves, without any reference to the\r\nJudges. In the discussion of one of them, a question was stated for the\r\nJudges concerning the law in a similar case upon an information in the\r\ncourt below; but it was set aside by the previous question.[39]\r\n\r\nOn the impeachment of Lord Lovat, no more than one objection to evidence\r\nwas taken by the Managers, against which Lord Lovat's counsel were not\r\npermitted to argue. Three objections on the part of the prisoner were\r\nmade to the evidence offered by the Managers, but all without\r\nsuccess.[40] The instances of similar objections in Parliamentary trials\r\nof peers on indictments are too few and too unimportant to require being\r\nparticularized;--one, that in the case of Lord Warwick, has been\r\nalready stated.\r\n\r\nThe principles of these precedents do not in the least affect any case\r\nof evidence which your Managers had to support. The paucity and\r\ninapplicability of instances of this kind convince your Committee that\r\nthe Lords have ever used some latitude and liberality in all the means\r\nof bringing information before them: nor is it easy to conceive, that,\r\nas the Lords are, and of right ought to be, judges of law and fact, many\r\ncases should occur (except those where a personal _vivâ voce_ witness is\r\ndenied to be competent) in which a judge, possessing an entire judicial\r\ncapacity, can determine by anticipation what is good evidence, and what\r\nnot, before he has heard it. When he has heard it, of course he will\r\njudge what weight it is to have upon his mind, or whether it ought not\r\nentirely to be struck out of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, always protesting, as before, against the admission of\r\nany law, foreign or domestic, as of authority in Parliament, further\r\nthan as written reason and the opinion of wise and informed men, has\r\nexamined into the writers on the Civil Law, ancient and more recent, in\r\norder to discover what those rules of evidence, in any sort applicable\r\nto criminal cases, were, which were supposed to stand in the way of the\r\ntrial of offences committed in India.\r\n\r\nThey find that the term Evidence, _Evidentia_, from whence ours is\r\ntaken, has a sense different in the Roman law from what it is understood\r\nto bear in the English jurisprudence; the term most nearly answering to\r\nit in the Roman being _Probatio_, Proof, which, like the term\r\n_Evidence_, is a generic term, including everything by which a doubtful\r\nmatter may be rendered more certain to the judge: or, as Gilbert\r\nexpresses it, every matter is evidence which amounts to the proof of the\r\npoint in question.[41]\r\n\r\nOn the general head of Evidence, or Proof, your Committee finds that\r\nmuch has been written by persons learned in the Roman law, particularly\r\nin modern times,--and that many attempts have been made to reduce to\r\nrules the principles of evidence or proof, a matter which by its very\r\nnature seems incapable of that simplicity, precision, and generality\r\nwhich are necessary to supply the matter or to give the form to a rule\r\nof law. Much learning has been employed on the doctrine of indications\r\nand presumptions in their books,--far more than is to be found in our\r\nlaw. Very subtle disquisitions were made on all matters of jurisprudence\r\nin the times of the classical Civil Law, by the followers of the Stoic\r\nschool.[42] In the modern school of the same law, the same course was\r\ntaken by Bartolus, Baldus, and the Civilians who followed them, before\r\nthe complete revival of literature.[43] All the discussions to be found\r\nin those voluminous writings furnish undoubtedly an useful exercise to\r\nthe mind, by methodizing the various forms in which one set of facts or\r\ncollection of facts, or the qualities or demeanor of persons,\r\nreciprocally influence each other; and by this course of juridical\r\ndiscipline they add to the readiness and sagacity of those who are\r\ncalled to plead or to judge. But as human affairs and human actions are\r\nnot of a metaphysical nature, but the subject is concrete, complex, and\r\nmoral, they cannot be subjected (without exceptions which reduce it\r\nalmost to nothing) to any certain rule. Their rules with regard to\r\ncompetence were many and strict, and our lawyers have mentioned it to\r\ntheir reproach. \"The Civilians,\" it has been observed, \"differ in\r\nnothing more than admitting evidence; for they reject _histriones_, &c.,\r\nand whole tribes of people.\"[44] But this extreme rigor as to\r\ncompetency, rejected by our law, is not found to extend to the _genus_\r\nof evidence, but only to a particular _species_,--personal witnesses.\r\nIndeed, after all their efforts to fix these things by positive and\r\ninflexible maxims, the best Roman lawyers, in their best ages, were\r\nobliged to confess that every case of evidence rather formed its own\r\nrule than that any rule could be adapted to every case. The best\r\nopinions, however, seem to have reduced the admissibility of witnesses\r\nto a few heads. \"For if,\" said Callistratus, in a passage preserved to\r\nus in the Digest, \"the testimony is free from suspicion, either on\r\naccount of the quality of the _person_, namely, that he is in a\r\nreputable situation, or for _cause_, that is to say, that the testimony\r\ngiven is not for reward nor favor nor for enmity, such a witness is\r\nadmissible.\" This first description goes to _competence_, between which\r\nand _credit_ Lord Hardwicke justly says the discrimination is very nice.\r\nThe other part of the text shows their anxiety to reduce credibility\r\nitself to a fixed rule. It proceeds, therefore,--\"His Sacred Majesty,\r\nHadrian, issued a rescript to Vivius Varus, Lieutenant of Cilicia, to\r\nthis effect, that he who sits in judgment is the most capable of\r\ndetermining what credit is to be given to witnesses.\" The words of the\r\nletter of rescript are as follow:--\"You ought best to know what credit\r\nis to be given to witnesses,--who, and of what dignity, and of what\r\nestimation they are,--whether they seem to deliver their evidence with\r\nsimplicity and candor, whether they seem to bring a formed and\r\npremeditated discourse, or whether on the spot they give probable matter\r\nin answer to the questions that are put to them.\" And there remains a\r\nrescript of the same prince to Valerius Verus, on the bringing out the\r\ncredit of witnesses. This appears to go more to the _general_ principles\r\nof evidence. It is in these words:--\"What evidence, and in what measure\r\nor degree, shall amount to proof in each case can be defined in no\r\nmanner whatsoever that is sufficiently certain. For, though not always,\r\nyet frequently, the truth of the affair may appear without any matter of\r\npublic record. In some cases the number of the witnesses, in others\r\ntheir dignity and authority, is to be weighed; in others, concurring\r\npublic fame tends to confirm the credit of the evidence in question.\r\nThis alone I am able, and in a few words, to give you as my\r\ndetermination: that you ought not too readily to bind yourself to try\r\nthe cause upon any one description of evidence; but you are to estimate\r\nby your own discretion what you ought to credit, or what appears to you\r\nnot to be established by proof sufficient.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe modern writers on the Civil Law have likewise much matter on this\r\nsubject, and have introduced a strictness with regard to personal\r\ntestimony which our particular jurisprudence has not thought it at all\r\nproper to adopt. In others we have copied them more closely. They divide\r\nEvidence into two parts, in which they do not differ from the ancients:\r\n1st, What is Evidence, or Proof, by itself; 2dly, What is Presumption,\r\n\"which is a probable conjecture, from a reference to something which,\r\ncoming from marks and tokens ascertained, shall be taken for truth,\r\nuntil some other shall be adduced.\" Again, they have labored\r\nparticularly to fix rules for presumptions, which they divide into, 1.\r\nViolent and necessary, 2. Probable, 3. and lastly, Slight and rash.[46]\r\nBut finding that this head of Presumptive Evidence (which makes so large\r\na part with them and with us in the trial of all causes, and\r\nparticularly criminal causes) is extremely difficult to ascertain,\r\neither with regard to what shall be considered as exclusively creating\r\nany of these three degrees of presumption, or what facts, and how\r\nproved, and what marks and tokens, may serve to establish them, even\r\nthose Civilians whose character it is to be subtle to a fault have been\r\nobliged to abandon the task, and have fairly confessed that the labors\r\nof writers to fix rules for these matters have been vain and fruitless.\r\nOne of the most able of them[47] has said, \"that the doctors of the law\r\nhave written nothing of value concerning presumptions; nor is the\r\nsubject-matter such as to be reduced within the prescribed limit of any\r\ncertain rules. In truth, it is from the actual existing case, and from\r\nthe circumstances of the persons and of the business, that we ought\r\n(under the guidance of an incorrupt judgment of the mind, which is\r\ncalled an equitable discretion) to determine what presumptions or\r\nconjectural proofs are to be admitted as rational or rejected as false,\r\nor on which the understanding can pronounce nothing, either the one way\r\nor the other.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that, whatever over-strictness is to be found in the\r\nolder writers on this law with regard to evidence, it chiefly related to\r\nthe mere competency of witnesses; yet even here the rigor of the Roman\r\nlawyers relaxed on the necessity of the case. Persons who kept houses of\r\nill-fame were with them incompetent witnesses; yet among the maxims of\r\nthat law the rule is well known of _Testes lupanares in re lupanari_.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases, they require two witnesses to prove a fact; and\r\ntherefore they held, \"that, if there be but one witness, and no probable\r\ngrounds of presumption of some kind (_nulla argumenta_), that one\r\nwitness is by no means to be heard\"; and it is not inelegantly said in\r\nthat case, _Non jus deficit, sed probatio_, \"The failure is not in the\r\nlaw, but in the proof.\" But if other grounds of presumption appear, one\r\nwitness is to be heard: \"for it is not necessary that one crime should\r\nbe established by one sort of proof only, as by witnesses, or by\r\ndocuments, or by presumptions; all the modes of evidence may be so\r\nconjoined, that, where none of them alone would affect the prisoner, all\r\nthe various concurrent proofs should overpower him like a storm of\r\nhail.\" This is held particularly true in cases where crimes are secret,\r\nand detection difficult. The necessity of detecting and punishing such\r\ncrimes superseded, in the soundest authors, this theoretic aim at\r\nperfection, and obliged technical science to submit to practical\r\nexpedience. \"_In re criminali_,\" said the rigorists, \"_probationes\r\ndebent esse evidentes et luce meridiana clariores_\": and so undoubtedly\r\nit is in offences which admit such proof. But reflection taught them\r\nthat even their favorite rules of incompetence must give way to the\r\nexigencies of distributive justice. One of the best modern writers on\r\nthe Imperial Criminal Law, particularly as practised in Saxony,\r\n(Carpzovius,) says,--\"This alone I think it proper to remark, that even\r\nincompetent witnesses are sometimes admitted, if otherwise the truth\r\ncannot be got at; and this particularly in facts and crimes which are of\r\ndifficult proof\"; and for this doctrine he cites Farinacius, Mascardus,\r\nand other eminent Civilians who had written on Evidence. He proceeds\r\nafterwards,--\"However, this is to be taken with a caution, that the\r\nimpossibility of otherwise discovering the truth is not construed from\r\nhence, that other witnesses were not actually concerned, but that, from\r\nthe nature of the crime, or from regard had to the place and time, other\r\nwitnesses could not be present.\" Many other passages from the same\r\nauthority, and from others to a similar effect, might be added; we\r\nshall only remark shortly, that Gaill, a writer on the practice of that\r\nlaw the most frequently cited in our own courts, gives the rule more in\r\nthe form of a maxim,--\"that the law is contented with such proof as\r\n_can_ be made, if the subject _in its nature_ is difficult of\r\nproof.\"[48] And the same writer, in another passage, refers to another\r\nstill more general maxim, (and a sound maxim it is,) that the power and\r\nmeans of proof ought not to be narrowed, but enlarged, that the truth\r\nmay not be concealed: \"_Probationum facultas non angustari, sed ampliari\r\ndebeat, ne veritas occultetur._\"[49]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, your Committee can find nothing in the writings of the\r\nlearned in this law, any more than they could discover anything in the\r\nLaw of Parliament, to support any one of the determinations given by the\r\nJudges, and adopted by the Lords, against the evidence which your\r\nCommittee offered, whether direct and positive, or merely (as for the\r\ngreater part it was) circumstantial, and produced as a ground to form\r\nlegitimate presumption against the defendant: nor, if they were to admit\r\n(which they do not) this Civil Law to be of authority in furnishing any\r\nrule in an impeachment of the Commons, more than as it may occasionally\r\nfurnish a principle of reason on a new or undetermined point, do they\r\nfind any rule or any principle, derived from that law, which could or\r\nought to have made us keep back the evidence which we offered; on the\r\ncontrary, we rather think those rules and principles to be in agreement\r\nwith our conduct.\r\n\r\nAs to the Canon Law, your Committee, finding it to have adopted the\r\nCivil Law with no very essential variation, does not feel it necessary\r\nto make any particular statement on that subject.\r\n\r\nYour Committee then came to examine into the authorities in the English\r\nlaw, both as it has prevailed for many years back, and as it has been\r\nrecently received in our courts below. They found on the whole the rules\r\nrather less strict, more liberal, and less loaded with positive\r\nlimitations, than in the Roman law. The origin of this latitude may\r\nperhaps be sought in this circumstance, which we know to have relaxed\r\nthe rigor of the Roman law: courts in England do not judge upon\r\nevidence, _secundum allegata et probata_, as in other countries and\r\nunder other laws they do, but upon verdict. By a fiction of law they\r\nconsider the jury as supplying, in some sense, the place of testimony.\r\nOne witness (and for that reason) is allowed sufficient to convict, in\r\ncases of felony, which in other laws is not permitted.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times it has happened to the law of England (as in pleading,\r\nso in matter of evidence) that a rigid strictness in the application of\r\ntechnical rules has been more observed than at present it is. In the\r\nmore early ages, as the minds of the Judges were in general less\r\nconversant in the affairs of the world, as the sphere of their\r\njurisdiction was less extensive, and as the matters which came before\r\nthem were of less variety and complexity, the rule being in general\r\nright, not so much inconvenience on the whole was found from a literal\r\nadherence to it as might have arisen from an endeavor towards a liberal\r\nand equitable departure, for which further experience, and a more\r\ncontinued cultivation of equity as a science, had not then so fully\r\nprepared them. In those times that judicial policy was not to be\r\ncondemned. We find, too, that, probably from the same cause, most of\r\ntheir doctrine leaned towards the restriction; and the old lawyers being\r\nbred, according to the then philosophy of the schools, in habits of\r\ngreat subtlety and refinement of distinction, and having once taken that\r\nbent, very great acuteness of mind was displayed in maintaining every\r\nrule, every maxim, every presumption of law creation, and every fiction\r\nof law, with a punctilious exactness: and this seems to have been the\r\ncourse which laws have taken in every nation.[50] It was probably from\r\nthis rigor, and from a sense of its pressure, that, at an early period\r\nof our law, far more causes of criminal jurisdiction were carried into\r\nthe House of Lords and the Council Board, where laymen were judges, than\r\ncan or ought to be at present.\r\n\r\nAs the business of courts of equity became more enlarged and more\r\nmethodical,--as magistrates, for a long series of years, presided in the\r\nCourt of Chancery, who were not bred to the Common Law,--as commerce,\r\nwith its advantages and its necessities, opened a communication more\r\nlargely with other countries,--as the Law of Nature and Nations (always\r\na part of the law of England) came to be cultivated,--as an increasing\r\nempire, as new views and new combinations of things were opened,--this\r\nantique rigor and overdone severity gave way to the accommodation of\r\nhuman concerns, for which rules were made, and not human concerns to\r\nbend to them.\r\n\r\nAt length, Lord Hardwicke, in one of the cases the most solemnly argued,\r\nthat has been in man's memory, with the aid of the greatest learning at\r\nthe bar, and with the aid of all the learning on the bench, both bench\r\nand bar being then supplied with men of the first form, declared from\r\nthe bench, and in concurrence with the rest of the Judges, and with the\r\nmost learned of the long robe, the able council on the side of the old\r\nrestrictive principles making no reclamation, \"that the judges and sages\r\nof the law have laid it down that there is but ONE general rule of\r\nevidence,--_the best that the nature of the case will admit_.\"[51] This,\r\nthen, the master rule, that governs all the subordinate rules, does in\r\nreality subject itself and its own virtue and authority _to the nature\r\nof the case_, and leaves no rule at all of an independent, abstract, and\r\nsubstantive quality. Sir Dudley Ryder, (then Attorney-General,\r\nafterwards Chief-Justice,) in his learned argument, observed, that \"it\r\nis extremely proper that there should be _some_ general rules in\r\nrelation to evidence; but _if exceptions were not allowed to them, it\r\nwould be better to demolish all the general rules_. There is no general\r\nrule without exception that we know of but this,--that _the best\r\nevidence shall be admitted which the nature of the case will afford_. I\r\nwill show that rules as general as this are broke in upon _for the sake\r\nof allowing evidence_. There is no rule that seems more binding than\r\nthat a man shall not be admitted an evidence in his own case, and yet\r\nthe Statute of Hue and Cry is an exception. A man's books are allowed\r\nto be evidence, or, which is in substance the same, his servant's books,\r\n_because the nature of the case requires it_,--as in the case of a\r\nbrewer's servants. Another general rule, that a wife cannot be witness\r\nagainst her husband, has been broke in upon in cases of treason. Another\r\nexception to the general rule, that a man may not be examined without\r\noath,--the last words of a dying man are given in evidence in the case\r\nof murder.\" Such are the doctrines of this great lawyer.\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Willes concurs with Lord Hardwicke as to dispensing with\r\nstrict rules of evidence. \"Such evidence,\" [he says,] \"is to be admitted\r\nas the _necessity_ of the case will allow of: as, for instance, a\r\nmarriage at Utrecht, certified under the seal of the minister there, and\r\nof the said town, and that they cohabited together as man and wife, was\r\nheld to be sufficient proof that they were married.\" This learned judge\r\n(commenting upon Lord Coke's doctrine, and Serjeant Hawkins's after him,\r\nthat the oaths of Jews and pagans were not to be taken) says, \"that this\r\nnotion, though advanced by so great a man, is contrary to religion,\r\ncommon sense, and common humanity, and I think the devils, to whom he\r\nhas delivered them, could not have suggested anything worse.\"\r\nChief-Justice Willes, admitting Lord Coke to be a great lawyer, then\r\nproceeds in very strong terms, and with marks of contempt, to condemn\r\n\"_his narrow notions_\"; and he treats with as little respect or decorum\r\nthe ancient authorities referred to in defence of such notions.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the departure from those rules is clearly fixed by Lord\r\nHardwicke; he lays it down as follows:--\"The first ground judges have\r\ngone upon, in departing from strict rules, is _absolute strict\r\nnecessity_; 2dly, a _presumed_ necessity.\" Of the first he gives these\r\ninstances:--\"In the case of writings subscribed by witnesses, if all are\r\ndead, the proof of one of their hands is sufficient to establish the\r\ndeed. Where an original is lost, a copy may be admitted; if no copy,\r\nthen a proof by witnesses who have _heard_ the deed: and yet it is a\r\nthing the law abhors, to admit the memory of man for evidence.\" This\r\nenlargement through two stages of proof, both of them contrary to the\r\nrule of law, and both abhorrent from its principles, are by this great\r\njudge accumulated upon one another, and are admitted from _necessity_,\r\nto accommodate human affairs, and to prevent that which courts are by\r\nevery possible means instituted to prevent,--A FAILURE OF JUSTICE. And\r\nthis necessity is not confined within the strict limits of physical\r\ncauses, but is more lax, and takes in _moral and even presumed and\r\nargumentative necessity_, a necessity which is in fact nothing more than\r\na great degree of expediency. The law creates a fictitious necessity\r\nagainst the rules of evidence in favor of the convenience of trade: an\r\nexception which on a similar principle had before been admitted in the\r\nCivil Law, as to mercantile causes, in which the books of the party were\r\nreceived to give full effect to an insufficient degree of proof, called,\r\nin the nicety of their distinctions, a _semiplena probatio_.[52]\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with Lord Hardwicke. He observes, that \"a tradesman's\r\nbooks\" (that is, the acts of the party interested himself) \"are admitted\r\nas evidence, though no _absolute necessity_, but by reason of a\r\n_presumption_ of necessity only, _inferred_ from the nature of\r\ncommerce.\" \"No rule,\" continued Lord Hardwicke, \"can be more settled\r\nthan that testimony is not to be received but upon oath\"; but he lays it\r\ndown, that an oath itself may be dispensed with. \"There is another\r\ninstance,\" says he, \"where the lawful oath may be dispensed with,--where\r\nour courts admit evidence for the Crown without oath.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same discussion, the Chief-Baron (Parker) cited cases in which\r\n_all_ the rules of evidence had given way. \"There is not a more general\r\nrule,\" says he, \"than that hearsay cannot be admitted, nor husband and\r\nwife as witnesses against each other; and yet it is _notorious_ that\r\nfrom necessity they have been allowed,--not an _absolute_ necessity, but\r\na _moral_ one.\"\r\n\r\nIt is further remarkable, in this judicial argument, that exceptions are\r\nallowed not only to rules of evidence, but that the rules of evidence\r\nthemselves are not altogether the same, where the subject-matter varies.\r\nThe Judges have, to facilitate justice, and to favor commerce, even\r\nadopted the rules of _foreign_ laws. They have taken for granted, and\r\nwould not suffer to be questioned, the regularity and justice of the\r\nproceedings of foreign courts; and they have admitted them as evidence,\r\nnot only of the fact of the decision, but of the right as to its\r\nlegality. \"Where there are foreign parties interested, and in commercial\r\nmatters, the rules of evidence are not quite the same as in other\r\ninstances in courts of justice: the case of Hue and Cry, Brownlow, 47. A\r\nfeme covert is not a lawful witness against her husband, except in cases\r\nof treason, but has been admitted in civil cases.[53] The testimony of\r\na public notary is evidence by the law of France: contracts are made\r\nbefore a public notary, and no other witness necessary. I should think\r\nit would be no doubt at all, if it came in question here, whether this\r\nwould be a valid contract, but a testimony from persons of that credit\r\nand reputation would be received as a very good proof in foreign\r\ntransactions, and would authenticate the contract.\"[54]\r\n\r\nThese cases show that courts always govern themselves by these rules in\r\ncases of foreign transactions. To this principle Lord Hardwicke accords;\r\nand enlarging the rule of evidence by the nature of the subject and the\r\nexigencies of the case, he lays it down, \"that it is a common and\r\n_natural_ presumption, that persons of the Gentoo religion should be\r\nprincipally apprised of facts and transactions in their own country. As\r\nthe English have only a factory in this country, (for it is in the\r\nempire of the Great Mogul,) if we should admit this evidence [Gentoo\r\nevidence on a Gentoo oath], it would be agreeable to the genius of the\r\nlaw of England.\" For this he cites the proceedings of our Court of\r\nAdmiralty, and adopts the author who states the precedent, \"that this\r\nCourt will give credit to the sentence of the Court of Admiralty in\r\nFrance, and take it to be according to right, and will not examine their\r\nproceedings: for it would be found very inconvenient, if one kingdom\r\nshould, by peculiar laws, correct the judgments and proceedings of\r\nanother kingdom.\" Such is the genius of the law of England, that these\r\ntwo principles, of the general moral necessities of things, and the\r\nnature of the case, overrule every other principle, even those rules\r\nwhich seem the very strongest. Chief-Baron Parker, in answer to an\r\nobjection made against the infidel deponent, \"that the plaintiff ought\r\nto have shown that he could not have the evidence of Christians,\" says,\r\n\"that, repugnant to natural justice, in the Statute of Hue and Cry, the\r\nrobbed is admitted to be witness of the robbery, as _a moral or presumed\r\nnecessity is sufficient_.\" The same learned magistrate, pursuing his\r\nargument in favor of liberality, in opening and enlarging the avenues to\r\njustice, does not admit that \"the authority of one or two cases\" is\r\nvalid against reason, equity, and convenience, the vital principles of\r\nthe law. He cites Wells _v._ Williams, 1 Raymond, 282, to show that the\r\nnecessity of trade has mollified the too rigorous rules of the old law,\r\nin their restraint and discouragement of aliens. \"A Jew may sue at\r\n_this_ day, but _heretofore he could not_, for then they were looked\r\nupon as enemies, but now commerce has taught the world more humanity;\r\nand therefore held that an alien enemy, commorant here by the license of\r\nthe King, and under his protection, may maintain a debt upon a bond,\r\nthough he did not come with safe-conduct.\" So far Parker, concurring\r\nwith Raymond. He proceeds:--\"It was objected by the defendant's counsel,\r\nthat this is a novelty, and that what never has been done ought not to\r\nbe done.\" The answer is, \"_The law of England is not confined to\r\nparticular cases, but is much more governed by reason than by any one\r\ncase whatever._ The true rule is laid down by Lord Vaughan, fol. 37,\r\n38. 'Where the law,' saith he, 'is _known and clear_, the Judges must\r\ndetermine as the law is, without regard to the inequitableness or\r\ninconveniency: these defects, if they happen in the law, can only be\r\nremedied by Parliament. But where the law is doubtful and not clear, the\r\nJudges ought to interpret the law to be as is most consonant to equity,\r\nand what is least inconvenient.'\"\r\n\r\nThese principles of equity, convenience, and natural reason Lord\r\nChief-Justice Lee considered in the same ruling light, not only as\r\nguides in matter of interpretation concerning law in general, but in\r\nparticular as controllers of the whole law of evidence, which, being\r\nartificial, and made for convenience, is to be governed by that\r\nconvenience for which it is made, and is to be wholly subservient to the\r\nstable principles of substantial justice, \"I do apprehend,\" said that\r\nChief-Justice, \"that the rules of evidence are to be considered as\r\n_artificial_ rules, framed by men for _convenience in courts of\r\njustice_. This is a case that ought to be looked upon in that light; and\r\nI take it that considering evidence in this way [viz. according to\r\nnatural justice] _is agreeable to the genius of the law of England_.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of Murray, then Solicitor-General, afterwards Lord\r\nMansfield, are of no small weight in themselves, and they are authority\r\nby being judicially adopted. His ideas go to the growing melioration of\r\nthe law, by making its liberality keep pace with the demands of justice\r\nand the actual concerns of the world: not restricting the infinitely\r\ndiversified occasions of men and the rules of natural justice within\r\nartificial circumscriptions, but conforming our jurisprudence to the\r\ngrowth of our commerce and of our empire. This enlargement of our\r\nconcerns he appears, in the year 1744, almost to have foreseen, and he\r\nlived to behold it. \"The arguments on the other side,\" said that great\r\nlight of the law, (that is, arguments against admitting the testimony in\r\nquestion from the novelty of the case,) \"prove nothing. Does it follow\r\nfrom thence, that no witnesses can be examined in a case that never\r\nspecifically existed before, or that an action cannot be brought in a\r\ncase that never happened before? _Reason_ (being stated to be the first\r\nground of all laws by the author of the book called 'Doctor and\r\nStudent') must determine the case. Therefore the only question is,\r\nWhether, _upon principles of reason, justice, and convenience_, this\r\nwitness be admissible? Cases in law depend upon the _occasions_ which\r\ngave rise to them. All occasions do not arise at once: now a particular\r\nspecies of Indians appears; hereafter another species of Indians may\r\narise. A statute can seldom take in all cases. Therefore the Common Law,\r\nthat works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is\r\nfor this reason superior to an act of Parliament.\"[55]\r\n\r\nFrom the period of this great judgment to the trial of Warren Hastings,\r\nEsquire, the law has gone on continually working itself pure (to use\r\nLord Mansfield's expression) by rules drawn from the fountain of\r\njustice. \"General rules,\" said the same person, when he sat upon the\r\nbench, \"are wisely established for attaining justice with ease,\r\ncertainty, and dispatch; but the great end of them being _to do\r\njustice_, the Court will see that it be really obtained. The courts have\r\nbeen more liberal of late years in their determinations, and have more\r\nendeavored to attend to the _real justice_ of the case than formerly.\"\r\nOn another occasion, of a proposition for setting aside a verdict, he\r\nsaid, \"This seems to be the true way to come at justice, and what we\r\ntherefore ought to do; for the true text is, _Boni judicis est ampliare\r\njustitiam_ (not _jurisdictionem_, as has been often cited).\"[56] In\r\nconformity to this principle, the supposed rules of evidence have, in\r\nlate times and judgments, instead of being drawn to a greater degree of\r\nstrictness, been greatly relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"_All evidence is according to the subject-matter to which it is\r\napplied._ There is a great deal of difference between length of time\r\nthat operates as a bar to a claim and that which is used only by way of\r\nevidence. Length of time used merely by way of evidence may be left to\r\nthe consideration of the jury, to be credited or not, or to draw their\r\ninferences one way or the other, according to circumstances. _I do not\r\nknow an instance in which proof may not be supplied._\"[57] In all cases\r\nof evidence Lord Mansfield's maxim was, _to lean to admissibility_,\r\nleaving the objections which were made to competency to go to credit,\r\nand to be weighed in the minds of the jury after they had heard it.[58]\r\nIn objections to wills, and to the testimony of witnesses to them, he\r\nthought \"it clear that the Judges ought to lean _against_ objections to\r\nthe formality.\"[59]\r\n\r\nLord Hardwicke had before declared, with great truth, \"that the\r\nboundaries of what goes to the credit and what to the competency _are\r\nvery nice, and the latter carried too far_\"; and in the same case he\r\nsaid, \"that, unless the objection appeared to him to carry a strong\r\ndanger of perjury, and some apparent advantage might accrue to the\r\nwitness, he was always inclined to let it go to his credit, only _in\r\norder to let in a proper light to the case, which would otherwise be\r\nshut out_; and _in a doubtful case_, he said, it was generally his\r\ncustom _to admit the evidence_, and give such directions to the jury as\r\nthe nature of the case might require.\"[60]\r\n\r\nIt is a known rule of evidence, that an interest in the matter to be\r\nsupported by testimony disqualifies a witness; yet Lord Mansfield held,\r\n\"that _nice_ objections to a remote interest which could not be paid or\r\nreleased, though they held in other cases, were not allowed to\r\ndisqualify a witness to a will, as parishioners might have [prove?] a\r\ndevise to the use of the poor of the parish forever.\" He went still\r\nnearer, and his doctrine tends so fully to settle the principles of\r\ndeparture from or adherence to rules of evidence, that your Committee\r\ninserts part of the argument at large. \"The disability of a witness from\r\ninterest is very different from a positive incapacity. If a deed must be\r\nacknowledged before a judge or notary public, every other person is\r\nunder a positive incapacity to authenticate it; but objections of\r\ninterest are deductions from natural reason, and proceed upon a\r\npresumption of too great a bias in the mind of the witness, and the\r\npublic utility of rejecting partial testimony. Presumptions stand no\r\nlonger than till the contrary is proved. The presumption of bias may be\r\ntaken off by showing the witness has a [as?] great or a greater\r\ninterest the other way, or that he has given it up. The presumption of\r\npublic utility may be answered by showing that it would be very\r\ninconvenient, under the particular circumstances, not to receive such\r\ntestimony. Therefore, from the course of business, necessity, and other\r\nreasons of expedience, _numberless exceptions_ are allowed to the\r\n_general_ rule.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThese being the principles of the latter jurisprudence, the Judges have\r\nsuffered no positive rule of evidence to counteract those principles.\r\nThey have even suffered subscribing witnesses to a will which recites\r\nthe soundness of mind in the testator to be examined to prove his\r\ninsanity, and then the court received evidence to overturn that\r\ntestimony and to destroy the credit of those witnesses. They were five\r\nin number, who attested to a will and codicil. They were admitted to\r\nannul the will they had themselves attested. Objections were taken to\r\nthe competency of one of the witnesses in support of the will against\r\nits subscribing witnesses: 1st, That the witness was an executor in\r\ntrust, and so liable to actions; 2dly, As having acted under the trust,\r\nwhereby, if the will were set aside, he would be liable to answer for\r\ndamages incurred by the sale of the deceased's chambers to a Mr.\r\nFrederick. Mr. Frederick offered to submit to a rule to release, for the\r\nsake of public justice. Those who maintained the objection cited\r\nSiderfin, a reporter of much authority, 51, 115, and 1st Keble, 134.\r\nLord Mansfield, Chief-Justice, did not controvert those authorities; but\r\nin the course of obtaining substantial justice he treated both of them\r\nwith equal contempt, though determined by judges of high reputation.\r\nHis words are remarkable: \"We do not _now_ sit here to take our rules of\r\nevidence from Siderfin and Keble.\" He overruled the objection upon more\r\nrecent authorities, which, though not in similar circumstances, he\r\nconsidered as within the reason. The Court did not think it necessary\r\nthat the witness should release, as he had offered to do. \"It appeared\r\non this trial,\" says Justice Blackstone, \"that a black conspiracy was\r\nformed to set aside the gentleman's will, without any foundation\r\nwhatever.\" A prosecution against three of the testamentary witnesses was\r\nrecommended, who were afterwards convicted of perjury.[62] Had strict\r\nformalities with regard to evidence been adhered to in any part of this\r\nproceeding, that very black conspiracy would have succeeded, and those\r\nblack conspirators, instead of receiving the punishment of their crimes,\r\nwould have enjoyed the reward of their perjury.\r\n\r\nLord Mansfield, it seems, had been misled, in a certain case, with\r\nregard to precedents. His opinion was against the reason and equity of\r\nthe supposed practice, but he supposed himself not at liberty to give\r\nway to his own wishes and opinions. On discovering his error, he\r\nconsidered himself as freed from an intolerable burden, and hastened to\r\nundo his former determination. \"There are no precedents,\" said he, with\r\nsome exultation, \"which stand in the way of our determining _liberally_,\r\n_equitably_, and according to the _true_ intention of the parties.\" In\r\nthe same case, his learned assessor, Justice Wilmot, felt the same\r\nsentiments. His expressions are remarkable:--\"Courts of law ought to\r\nconcur with courts of equity in the execution of those powers which are\r\nvery convenient to be inserted in settlements; and they ought not to\r\nlisten to nice distinctions that savor of the schools, but to be guided\r\nby true good sense and manly reason. After the Statute of Uses, it is\r\nmuch to be lamented that the courts of Common Law had not adopted all\r\nthe rules and maxims of courts of equity. This would have prevented the\r\nabsurdity of receiving costs in one court and paying them in\r\nanother.\"[63]\r\n\r\nYour Committee does not produce the doctrine of this particular case as\r\ndirectly applicable to their charge, no more than several of the others\r\nhere cited. We do not know on what precedents or principles the evidence\r\nproposed by us has been deemed inadmissible by the Judges; therefore\r\nagainst the grounds of this rejection we find it difficult directly to\r\noppose anything. These precedents and these doctrines are brought to\r\nshow the general temper of the courts, their growing liberality, and the\r\ngeneral tendency of all their reasonings and all their determinations to\r\nset aside all such technical subtleties or formal rules, which might\r\nstand in the way of the discovery of truth and the attainment of\r\njustice. The cases are adduced for the principles they contain.\r\n\r\nThe period of the cases and arguments we have cited was that in which\r\nlarge and liberal principles of evidence were more declared, and more\r\nregularly brought into system. But they had been gradually improving;\r\nand there are few principles of the later decisions which are not to be\r\nfound in determinations on cases prior to the time we refer to. Not to\r\noverdo this matter, and yet to bring it with some degree of clearness\r\nbefore the House, your Committee will refer but to a few authorities,\r\nand those which seem most immediately to relate to the nature of the\r\ncause intrusted to them. In Michaelmas, 11 Will. III., the King _v._ the\r\nWarden of the Fleet, a witness, who had really been a prisoner, and\r\nvoluntarily suffered to escape, was produced to prove the escape. To the\r\nwitness it was objected, that he had given a bond to be a true prisoner,\r\nwhich he had forfeited by escaping: besides, he had been retaken. His\r\ntestimony was allowed; and by the Court, among other things, it was\r\nsaid, in secret transactions, if any of the parties concerned are not to\r\nbe, for the necessity of the third, admitted as evidence, it will be\r\nimpossible to detect the practice: as in cases of the Statute of Hue and\r\nCry, the party robbed shall be a witness to charge the hundred; and in\r\nthe case of Cooke _v._ Watts in the Exchequer, where one who had been\r\nprejudiced by the will was admitted an evidence to prove it forged.[64]\r\nSo in the case of King _v._ Parris,[65] where a feme covert was admitted\r\nas a witness for _fraudulently_ drawing her in, when sole, to give a\r\nwarrant of attorney for confessing a judgment on an unlawful\r\nconsideration, whereby execution was sued out against her husband, and\r\nHolt, Chief-Justice, held that a feme covert could not, by law, be a\r\nwitness to convict one on an information; yet, in Lord Audley's case, it\r\nbeing a rape on her person, she was received to give evidence against\r\nhim, and the Court concurred with him, because it was the best evidence\r\nthe nature of the thing would allow. This decision of Holt refers to\r\nothers more early, and all on the same principle; and it is not of this\r\nday that this one great principle of eminent public expedience, this\r\nmoral necessity, \"that crimes should not escape with impunity,\"[66] has\r\nin all cases overborne all the common juridical rules of evidence,--it\r\nhas even prevailed over the first and most natural construction of acts\r\nof Parliament, and that in matters of so penal a nature as high treason.\r\nIt is known that statutes made, not to open and enlarge, but on fair\r\ngrounds to straiten proofs, require two witnesses in cases of high\r\ntreason. So it was understood, without dispute and without distinction,\r\nuntil the argument of a case in the High Court of Justice, during the\r\nUsurpation. It was the case of the Presbyterian minister, Love, tried\r\nfor high treason against the Commonwealth, in an attempt to restore the\r\nKing. In this trial, it was contended for, and admitted, that one\r\nwitness to one overt act, and one to another overt act of the same\r\ntreason, ought to be deemed sufficient.[67] That precedent, though\r\nfurnished in times from which precedents were cautiously drawn, was\r\nreceived as authority throughout the whole reign of Charles II.; it was\r\nequally followed after the Revolution; and at this day it is undoubted\r\nlaw. It is not so from the natural or technical rules of construction of\r\nthe act of Parliament, but from the principles of juridical policy. All\r\nthe judges who have ruled it, all the writers of credit who have written\r\nupon it, assign this reason, and this only,--_that treasons, being\r\nplotted in secrecy, could in few cases be otherwise brought to\r\npunishment_.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of policy has dictated a principle of relaxation\r\nwith regard to severe rules of evidence, in all cases similar, though of\r\na lower order in the scale of criminality. It is against fundamental\r\nmaxims that an accomplice should be admitted as a witness: but\r\naccomplices are admitted from the policy of justice, otherwise\r\nconfederacies of crime could not be dissolved. There is no rule more\r\nsolid than that a man shall not entitle himself to profit by his own\r\ntestimony. But an informer, in case of highway robbery, may obtain forty\r\npounds to his own profit by his own evidence: this is not in consequence\r\nof positive provision in the act of Parliament; it is a provision of\r\npolicy, lest the purpose of the act should be defeated.\r\n\r\nNow, if policy has dictated this very large construction of an act of\r\nParliament concerning high treason, if the same policy has dictated\r\nexceptions to the clearest and broadest rules of evidence in other\r\nhighly penal causes, and if all this latitude is taken concerning\r\nmatters for the greater part within our insular bounds, your Committee\r\ncould not, with safety to the larger and more remedial justice of the\r\nLaw of Parliament, admit any rules or pretended rules, unconnected and\r\nuncontrolled by circumstances, to prevail in a trial which regarded\r\noffences of a nature as difficult of detection, and committed far from\r\nthe sphere of the ordinary practice of our courts.\r\n\r\nIf anything of an over-formal strictness is introduced into the trial of\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, it does not seem to be copied from the\r\ndecisions of these tribunals. It is with great satisfaction your\r\nCommittee has found that the reproach of \"disgraceful subtleties,\"\r\ninferior rules of evidence which prevent the discovery of truth, of\r\nforms and modes of proceeding which stand in the way of that justice the\r\nforwarding of which is the sole rational object of their invention,\r\ncannot fairly be imputed to the Common Law of England, or to the\r\nordinary practice of the courts below.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe rules of evidence in civil and in criminal cases, in law and in\r\nequity, being only reason methodized, are certainly the same. Your\r\nCommittee, however, finds that the far greater part of the law of\r\nevidence to be found in our books turns upon questions relative to civil\r\nconcerns. Civil cases regard property: now, although property itself is\r\nnot, yet almost everything concerning property and all its modifications\r\nis, of artificial contrivance. The rules concerning it become more\r\npositive, as connected with positive institution. The legislator\r\ntherefore always, the jurist frequently, may ordain certain methods by\r\nwhich alone they will suffer such matters to be known and established;\r\nbecause their very essence, for the greater part, depends on the\r\narbitrary conventions of men. Men act on them with all the power of a\r\ncreator over his creature. They make fictions of law and presumptions of\r\n(_præsumptiones juris et de jure_) according to their ideas of utility;\r\nand against those fictions, and against presumptions so created, they do\r\nand may reject all evidence. However, even in these cases there is some\r\nrestraint. Lord Mansfield has let in a liberal spirit against the\r\nfictions of law themselves; and he declared that he would do what in one\r\ncase[68] he actually did, and most wisely, that he would admit evidence\r\nagainst a fiction of law, when the fiction militated against the policy\r\non which it was made.\r\n\r\nThus it is with things which owe their existence to men; but where the\r\nsubject is of a physical nature, or of a moral nature, independent of\r\ntheir conventions, men have no other reasonable authority than to\r\nregister and digest the results of experience and observation. Crimes\r\nare the actions of physical beings with an evil intention abusing their\r\nphysical powers against justice and to the detriment of society: in this\r\ncase fictions of law and artificial presumptions (_juris et de jure_)\r\nhave little or no place. The presumptions which belong to criminal cases\r\nare those natural and popular presumptions which are only observations\r\nturned into maxims, like adages and apophthegms, and are admitted (when\r\ntheir grounds are established) in the place of proof, where better is\r\nwanting, but are to be always over turned by counter proof.\r\n\r\nThese presumptions mostly go to the _intention_. In all criminal cases,\r\nthe crime (except where the law itself implies malice) consists rather\r\nin the intention than the action. Now the intention is proved but by two\r\nways: either, 1st, by confession,--this first case is rare, but\r\nsimple,--2dly, by circumstantial proof,--this is difficult, and requires\r\ncare and pains. The connection of the intention and the circumstances is\r\nplainly of such a nature as more to depend on the sagacity of the\r\nobserver than on the excellence of any rule. The pains taken by the\r\nCivilians on that subject have not been very fruitful; and the English\r\nlaw-writers have, perhaps as wisely, in a manner abandoned the pursuit.\r\nIn truth, it seems a wild attempt to lay down any rule for the proof of\r\nintention by circumstantial evidence. All the acts of the party,--all\r\nthings that explain or throw light on these acts,--all the acts of\r\nothers relative to the affair, that come to his knowledge, and may\r\ninfluence him,--his friendships and enmities, his promises, his threats,\r\nthe truth of his discourses, the falsehood of his apologies, pretences,\r\nand explanations, his looks, his speech, his silence where he was called\r\nto speak,--everything which tends to establish the connection between\r\nall these particulars,--every circumstance, precedent, concomitant, and\r\nsubsequent, become parts of circumstantial evidence. These are in their\r\nnature infinite, and cannot be comprehended within any rule or brought\r\nunder any classification.\r\n\r\nNow, as the force of that presumptive and conjectural proof rarely, if\r\never, depends on one fact only, but is collected from the number and\r\naccumulation of circumstances concurrent in one point, we do not find an\r\ninstance, until this trial of Warren Hastings, Esquire, (which has\r\nproduced many novelties,) that attempts have been made by any court to\r\ncall on the prosecutor for an account of the purpose for which he means\r\nto produce each particle of this circumstantial evidence, to take up the\r\ncircumstances one by one, to prejudge the efficacy of each matter\r\nseparately in proving the point,--and thus to break to pieces and to\r\ngarble those facts, upon the multitude of which, their combination, and\r\nthe relation of all their component parts to each other and to the\r\nculprit, the whole force and virtue of this evidence depends. To do\r\nanything which can destroy this collective effect is to deny\r\ncircumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, too, cannot but express their surprise at the particular\r\nperiod of the present trial when the attempts to which we have alluded\r\nfirst began to be made. The two first great branches of the accusation\r\nof this House against Warren Hastings, Esquire, relate to public and\r\nnotorious acts, capable of direct proof,--such as the expulsion of Cheyt\r\nSing, with its consequences on the province of Benares, and the seizure\r\nof the treasures and jaghires of the Begums of Oude. Yet, in the proof\r\nof those crimes, your Committee cannot justly complain that we were very\r\nnarrowly circumscribed in the production of much circumstantial as well\r\nas positive evidence. We did not find any serious resistance on this\r\nhead, till we came to make good our charges of secret crimes,--crimes of\r\na class and description in the proof of which all judges of all\r\ncountries have found it necessary to relax almost all their rules of\r\ncompetency: such crimes as peculation, pecuniary frauds, extortion, and\r\nbribery. Eight out of nine of the questions put to the Judges by the\r\nLords, in the first stage of the prosecution, related to circumstances\r\noffered in proof of these secret crimes.\r\n\r\nMuch industry and art have been used, among the illiterate and\r\nunexperienced, to throw imputations on this prosecution, and its\r\nconduct, because so great a proportion of the evidence offered on this\r\ntrial (especially on the latter charges) has been circumstantial.\r\nAgainst the prejudices of the ignorant your Committee opposes the\r\njudgment of the learned. It is known to them, that, when this proof is\r\nin its greatest perfection, that is, when it is most abundant in\r\ncircumstances, it is much superior to positive proof; and for this we\r\nhave the authority of the learned judge who presided at the trial of\r\nCaptain Donellan. \"On the part of the prosecution, a great deal of\r\nevidence has been laid before you. It is _all_ circumstantial evidence,\r\nand in its nature it must be so: for, in cases of this sort, no man is\r\nweak enough to commit the act in the presence of other persons, or to\r\nsuffer them to see what he does at the time; and therefore it can only\r\nbe made out by circumstances, either before the committing of the act,\r\nat the time when it was committed, or subsequent to it. And a\r\npresumption, which necessarily arises from circumstances, is very often\r\nmore convincing and more satisfactory than any other kind of evidence:\r\nbecause it is not within the reach and compass of human abilities to\r\ninvent a train of circumstances which shall be so connected together as\r\nto amount to a proof of guilt, without affording opportunities of\r\ncontradicting a great part, if not all, of these circumstances. But if\r\nthe circumstances are such as, when laid together, bring conviction to\r\nyour minds, it is then fully equal, if not, as I told you before, _more_\r\nconvincing than positive evidence.\" In the trial of Donellan no such\r\nselection was used as we have lately experienced; no limitation to the\r\nproduction of every matter, before, at, and after the fact charged. The\r\ntrial was (as we conceive) rightly conducted by the learned judge;\r\nbecause secret crimes, such as secret assassination, poisoning, bribery,\r\npeculation, and extortion, (the three last of which this House has\r\ncharged upon Mr. Hastings,) can very rarely be proved in any other way.\r\nThat way of proof is made to give satisfaction to a searching,\r\nequitable, and intelligent mind; and there must not be a failure of\r\njustice. Lord Mansfield has said that he did not know a case in which\r\nproof might not be supplied.[69]\r\n\r\nYour Committee has resorted to the trial of Donellan, and they have and\r\ndo much rely upon it, first, on account of the known learning and\r\nability of the judge who tried the cause, and the particular attention\r\nhe has paid to the subject of evidence, which forms a book in his\r\ntreatise on _Nisi Prius_;--next, because, as the trial went _wholly_ on\r\ncircumstantial evidence, the proceedings in it furnish some of the most\r\ncomplete and the fullest examples on that subject;--thirdly, because the\r\ncase is recent, and the law cannot be supposed to be materially altered\r\nsince the time of that event.\r\n\r\nComparing the proceedings on that trial, and the doctrines from the\r\nbench, with the doctrines we have heard from the woolsack, your\r\nCommittee cannot comprehend how they can be reconciled. For the Lords\r\ncompelled the Managers to declare for what purpose they produced each\r\nseparate member of their circumstantial evidence: a thing, as we\r\nconceive, not usual, and particularly not observed in the trial of\r\nDonellan. We have observed in that trial, and in most others which we\r\nhave had occasion to resort to, that the prosecutor is suffered to\r\nproceed narratively and historically, without interruption. If, indeed,\r\nit appears on the face of the narration that what is represented to have\r\nbeen said, written, or done did not come to the knowledge of the\r\nprisoner, a question sometimes, but rarely, has been asked, whether the\r\nprisoner could be affected with the knowledge of it. When a connection\r\nwith the person of the prisoner has been in any way shown, or even\r\npromised to be shown, the evidence is allowed to go on without further\r\nopposition. The sending of a sealed letter,--the receipt of a sealed\r\nletter, inferred from the delivery to the prisoner's servant,--the bare\r\npossession of a paper written by any other person, on the presumption\r\nthat the contents of such letters or such paper were known to the\r\nprisoner,--and the being present when anything was said or done, on the\r\npresumption of his seeing or hearing what passed, have been respectively\r\nruled to be sufficient. If, on the other hand, no circumstance of\r\nconnection has been proved, the judge, in summing up, has directed the\r\njury to pay no regard to a letter or conversation the proof of which has\r\nso failed: a course much less liable to inconvenience, where the same\r\npersons decide both the law and the fact.[70]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the difficulties to which your Committee was subjected on\r\nthis head, we think it sufficient to submit to the House (reserving a\r\nmore full discussion of this important point to another occasion) the\r\nfollowing short statement of an incident which occurred in this trial.\r\n\r\nBy an express order of the Court of Directors, (to which, by the express\r\nwords of the act of Parliament under which he held his office, he was\r\nordered to yield obedience,) Mr. Hastings and his colleagues were\r\ndirected to make an inquiry into all offences of bribery and corruption\r\nin office. On the 11th of March a charge in writing of bribery and\r\ncorruption in office was brought against himself. On the 13th of the\r\nsame month, the accuser, a man of high rank, the Rajah Nundcomar,\r\nappears personally before the Council to make good his charge against\r\nMr. Hastings before his own face. Mr. Hastings thereon fell into a very\r\nintemperate heat, obstinately refused to be present at the examination,\r\nattempted to dissolve the Council, and contumaciously retired from it.\r\nThree of the other members, a majority of the Council, in execution of\r\ntheir duty, and in obedience to the orders received under the act of\r\nParliament, proceeded to take the evidence, which is very minute and\r\nparticular, and was entered in the records of the Council by the regular\r\nofficial secretary. It was afterwards read in Mr. Hastings's own\r\npresence, and by him transmitted, under his own signature, to the Court\r\nof Directors. A separate letter was also written by him, about the same\r\ntime, desiring, on his part, that, in any inquiry into his conduct, \"not\r\na single word should escape observation.\" This proceeding in the Council\r\nyour Committee, in its natural order, and in a narrative chain of\r\ncircumstantial proof, offered in evidence. It was not permitted to be\r\nread; and on the 20th and 21st of May, 1789, we were told from the\r\nwoolsack, \"that, when a paper is not evidence by itself,\" (such this\r\npart of the Consultation, it seems, was reputed,) \"a party who wishes to\r\nintroduce a paper of that kind is called upon not only to state, but to\r\nmake out on proof, _the whole of the grounds upon which he proceeds to\r\nmake that paper proper evidence_; that the evidence that is produced\r\nmust be _the demeanor_ of the party respecting that paper; and it is the\r\nconnection between them, _as material to the charge depending_, that\r\nwill enable them to be produced.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee observes, that this was not a paper _foreign_ to the\r\nprisoner, and sent to him as _a letter_, the receipt of which, and his\r\nconduct thereon, were to be brought home to him, to infer his guilt from\r\nhis demeanor. It was an office document of his own department,\r\nconcerning himself, and kept by officers of his own, and by himself\r\ntransmitted, as we have said, to the Court of Directors. Its proof was\r\nin the record. The charge made against him, and his demeanor on being\r\nacquainted with it, were not in separate evidence. They all lay\r\ntogether, and composed a connected narrative of the business,\r\nauthenticated by himself.\r\n\r\nIn that case it seems to your Committee extremely irregular and\r\npreposterous to demand previous and extraneous proofs of the demeanor of\r\nthe party respecting the paper, and the connection between them, as\r\n_material to the charge_ depending; for this would be to try what the\r\neffect and operation of the evidence would be on the issue of the cause,\r\nbefore its production.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine so laid down demands that every several circumstance should\r\nin itself be conclusive, or at least should afford a violent\r\npresumption: it must, we were told, without question, be material to the\r\ncharge depending. But, as we conceive, its materiality, more or less, is\r\nnot in the first instance to be established. To make it admissible, it\r\nis enough to give proof, or to raise a legal inference, of its\r\nconnection both with the charge depending and the person of the party\r\ncharged, where it does not appear on the face of the evidence offered.\r\nBesides, by this new doctrine, the materiality required to be shown must\r\nbe decided from a consideration, not of the whole circumstance, but in\r\ntruth of one half of the circumstance,--of a demeanor unconnected with\r\nand unexplained by that on which it arose, though the connection between\r\nthe demeanor of the party and the paper is that which must be shown to\r\nbe material. Your Committee, after all they have heard, is yet to learn\r\nhow the full force and effect of any demeanor, as evidence of guilt or\r\ninnocence, can be known, unless it be also fully known _to what that\r\ndemeanor applied_,--unless, when a person did or said anything, it be\r\nknown, not generally and abstractedly, that a paper was read to him, but\r\nparticularly and specifically _what were the contents of that paper_:\r\nwhether they were matters lightly or weightily alleged,--within the\r\npower of the party accused to have confuted on the spot, if false,--or\r\nsuch as, though he might have denied, he could not instantly have\r\ndisproved. The doctrine appeared and still appears to your Committee to\r\nbe totally abhorrent from the genius of circumstantial evidence, and\r\nmischievously subversive of its use. We did, however, offer that\r\nextraneous proof which was demanded of us; but it was refused, as well\r\nas the office document.\r\n\r\nYour Committee thought themselves the more bound to contend for every\r\nmode of evidence _to the intention,_ because in many of the cases the\r\ngross fact was admitted, and the prisoner and his counsel set up\r\npretences of public necessity and public service for his justification.\r\nNo way lay open for rebutting this justification, but by bringing out\r\nall the circumstances attendant on the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AND TIME OF PRODUCING EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nYour Committee found great impediment in the production of evidence, not\r\nonly on account of the general doctrines supposed to exist concerning\r\nits inadmissibility, drawn from its own alleged natural incompetency, or\r\nfrom its inapplicability under the pleading of the impeachment of this\r\nHouse, but also from the mode of proceeding in bringing it forward. Here\r\nevidence which we thought necessary to the elucidation of the cause was\r\nnot suffered, upon the supposed rules of _examination in chief and\r\ncross-examination_, and on supposed rules forming a distinction between\r\nevidence _originally_ produced on the charge and evidence offered on\r\n_the reply_.\r\n\r\nOn all these your Committee observes in general, that, if the rules\r\nwhich respect the substance of the evidence are (as the great lawyers on\r\nwhose authority we stand assert they are) no more than rules of\r\nconvenience, much more are those subordinate rules which regard the\r\norder, the manner, and the time of the arrangement. These are purely\r\narbitrary, without the least reference to any fixed principle in the\r\nnature of things, or to any settled maxim of jurisprudence, and\r\nconsequently are variable at every instant, as the conveniencies of the\r\ncause may require.\r\n\r\nWe admit, that, in the order of mere arrangement, there is a difference\r\nbetween examination of witnesses in chief and cross-examination, and\r\nthat in general these several parts are properly cast according to the\r\nsituation of the parties in the cause; but there neither is nor can be\r\nany precise rule to discriminate the exact bounds between examination\r\nand cross-examination. So as to time there is necessarily some limit,\r\nbut a limit hard to fix. The only one which can be fixed with any\r\ntolerable degree of precision is when the judge, after fully hearing all\r\nparties, is to consider of his verdict or his sentence. Whilst the cause\r\ncontinues under hearing in any shape, or in any stage of the process, it\r\nis the duty of the judge to receive every offer of evidence, apparently\r\nmaterial, suggested to him, though the parties themselves, through\r\nnegligence, ignorance, or corrupt collusion, should not bring it\r\nforward. A judge is not placed in that high situation merely as a\r\npassive instrument of parties. He has a duty of his own, independent of\r\nthem, and that duty is to investigate the truth. There may be no\r\nprosecutor. In our law a permanent prosecutor is not of necessity. The\r\nCrown prosecutor in criminal cases is a grand jury; and this is\r\ndissolved instantly on its findings and its presentments. But if no\r\nprosecutor appears, (and it has happened more than once,) the court is\r\nobliged through its officer, the clerk of the arraigns, to examine and\r\ncross-examine every witness who presents himself; and the judge is to\r\nsee it done effectually, and to act his own part in it,--and this as\r\nlong as evidence shall be offered within the time which the mode of\r\ntrial will admit.\r\n\r\nYour Committee is of opinion, that, if it has happened that witnesses,\r\nor other kinds of evidence, have not been frequently produced after the\r\nclosing of the prisoner's defence, or such evidence has not been in\r\nreply given, it has happened from the peculiar nature of our common\r\njudicial proceedings, in which all the matter of evidence must be\r\npresented whilst the bodily force and the memory or other mental\r\nfaculties of men can hold out. This does not exceed the compass of one\r\nnatural day, or thereabouts: during that short space of time new\r\nevidence very rarely occurs for production by any of the parties;\r\nbecause the nature of man, joined to the nature of the tribunals, and of\r\nthe mode of trial at Common Law, (good and useful on the whole,)\r\nprescribe limits which the mere principles of justice would of\r\nthemselves never fix.\r\n\r\nBut in other courts, such as the Court of Chancery, the Courts of\r\nAdmiralty Jurisdiction, (except in prize causes under the act of\r\nParliament,) and in the Ecclesiastical Courts, wherein the trial is not\r\nby an inclosed jury in those courts, such strait limits are not of\r\ncourse necessary: the cause is continued by many adjournments; as long\r\nas the trial lasts, new witnesses are examined (even after the regular\r\nstage) for each party, on a special application under the circumstances\r\nto the sound discretion of the court, where the evidence offered is\r\nnewly come to the knowledge or power of the party, and appears on the\r\nface of it to be material in the cause. _Even after hearing_, new\r\nwitnesses have been examined, or former witnesses reëxamined, not as the\r\nright of the parties, but _ad informandam conscientiam judicis_.[71] All\r\nthese things are not unfrequent in some, if not in all of these courts,\r\nand perfectly known to the judges of Westminster Hall; who cannot be\r\nsupposed ignorant of the practice of the Court of Chancery, and who sit\r\nto try appeals from the Admiralty and Ecclesiastical Courts as\r\ndelegates.\r\n\r\nBut as criminal prosecutions according to the forms of the Civil and\r\nCanon Law are neither many nor important in any court of this part of\r\nthe kingdom, your Committee thinks it right to state the undisputed\r\nprinciple of the Imperial Law, from the great writer on this subject\r\nbefore cited by us,--from Carpzovius. He says, \"that a doubt has arisen,\r\nwhether, evidence being once given in a trial on a public prosecution,\r\n(_in processu inquisitorio_,) and the witnesses being examined, it may\r\nbe allowed to form other and new articles and to produce new witnesses.\"\r\nYour Committee must here observe, that the _processus inquisitorius_ is\r\nthat proceeding in which the prosecution is carried on in the name of\r\nthe judge acting _ex officio_, from that duty of his office which is\r\ncalled the _nobile officium judicis_. For the judge under the Imperial\r\nLaw possesses both those powers, the inquisitorial and the judicial,\r\nwhich in the High Court of Parliament are more aptly divided and\r\nexercised by the different Houses; and in this kind of process the House\r\nwill see that Carpzovius couples the production of new witnesses and the\r\nforming of new articles (the undoubted privilege of the Commons) as\r\nintimately and necessarily connected. He then proceeds to solve the\r\ndoubt. \"Certainly,\" says he, \"there are authors who deny, that, after\r\npublication of the depositions, any new witnesses and proofs that can\r\naffect the prisoner ought to be received; which,\" says he, \"is true in a\r\ncase where a private prosecutor has intervened, who produces the\r\nwitnesses. But if the judge proceeds by way of inquisition _ex officio_,\r\nthen, even after the completion of the examination of witnesses against\r\nthe prisoner, new witnesses may be received and examined, and, on new\r\ngrounds of suspicion arising, new articles may be formed, according to\r\nthe common opinion of the doctors; and as it is the most generally\r\nreceived, so it is most agreeable to reason.\"[72] And in another\r\nchapter, relative to the ordinary criminal process by a private\r\nprosecutor, he lays it down, on the authority of Angelus, Bartolus, and\r\nothers, that, after the right of the party prosecuting is expired, the\r\njudge, taking up the matter _ex officio_, may direct new witnesses and\r\nnew proofs, even after publication.[73] Other passages from the same\r\nwriter and from others might be added; but your Committee trusts that\r\nwhat they have produced is sufficient to show the general principles of\r\nthe Imperial Criminal Law.\r\n\r\nThe High Court of Parliament bears in its modes of proceeding a much\r\ngreater resemblance to the course of the Court of Chancery, the\r\nAdmiralty, and Ecclesiastical Courts, (which are the King's courts too,\r\nand their law the law of the land,) than to those of the Common Law. The\r\naccusation is brought into Parliament, at this very day, by _exhibiting\r\narticles_; which your Committee is informed is the regular mode of\r\ncommencing a criminal prosecution, where the office of the judge is\r\npromoted, in the Civil and Canon Law courts of this country. The answer,\r\nagain, is usually specific, both to the fact and the law alleged in each\r\nparticular article; which is agreeable to the proceeding of the Civil\r\nLaw, and not of the Common Law.\r\n\r\nAnciently the resemblance was much nearer and stronger. Selden, who was\r\nhimself a great ornament of the Common Law, and who was personally\r\nengaged in most of the impeachments of his time, has written expressly\r\non the judicature in Parliament. In his fourth chapter, intituled, _Of\r\nWitnesses_, he lays down the practice of his time, as well as of ancient\r\ntimes, with respect to the proof by examination; and it is clearly a\r\npractice more similar to that of the Civil than the Common Law. \"The\r\npractice at this day,\" says he, \"is to swear the witnesses in open\r\nHouse, and then to examine them there, _or at a committee_, either upon\r\n_interrogatories_ agreed upon in the House, or such as the committee in\r\ntheir discretion shall demand. Thus it was in ancient times, as shall\r\nappear by the precedents, so many as they are, they being very sparing\r\nto record those ceremonies, which I shall briefly recite: I then add\r\nthose of later times.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in times so late as those of the trial of Lord\r\nMiddlesex,[74] upon an impeachment of the Commons, the whole course of\r\nthe proceeding, especially in the mode of adducing the evidence, was in\r\na manner the same as in the Civil Law: depositions were taken, and\r\npublication regularly passed: and on the trial of Lord Strafford, both\r\nmodes pointed out by Selden seem to have been indifferently used.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that this high court (bound by none of their\r\nrules) has a liberty to adopt the methods of any of the legal courts of\r\nthe kingdom at its discretion; and in _sound_ discretion it ought to\r\nadopt those which bear the nearest resemblance to its own constitution,\r\nto its own procedure, and to its exigencies in the promotion of justice.\r\nThere are conveniencies and inconveniencies both in the shorter and the\r\nlonger mode of trial. But to bring the methods observed (if such are in\r\nfact observed) in the former, only from necessity, into the latter, by\r\nchoice, is to load it with the inconveniency of both, without the\r\nadvantages of either. The chief benefit of any process which admits of\r\nadjournments is, that it may afford means of fuller information and more\r\nmature deliberation. If neither of the parties have a strict right to\r\nit, yet the court or the jury, as the case may be, ought to demand it.\r\n\r\nYour Committee is of opinion, that all rules relative to laches or\r\nneglects in a party to the suit, which may cause nonsuit on the one hand\r\nor judgment by default in the other, all things which cause the party\r\n_cadere in jure_, ought not to be adhered to in the utmost rigor, even\r\nin civil cases; but still less ought that spirit which takes advantage\r\nof lapses and failures on either part to be suffered to govern in causes\r\ncriminal. \"Judges ought to _lean_ against every attempt to nonsuit a\r\nplaintiff on objections which have no relation to the real merits. It is\r\nunconscionable in a defendant to take advantage of the _apices\r\nlitigandi_: against such objections _every possible presumption ought to\r\nbe made which ingenuity can suggest_. How disgraceful would it be to the\r\nadministration of justice to allow chicane to obstruct right!\"[75] This\r\nobservation of Lord Mansfield applies equally to every means by which,\r\nindirectly as well as directly, the cause may fail upon any other\r\nprinciples than those of its merits. He thinks that all the resources of\r\ningenuity ought to be employed to baffle chicane, not to support it. The\r\ncase in which Lord Mansfield has delivered this sentiment is merely a\r\ncivil one. In civil causes of _meum et tuum_, it imports little to the\r\ncommonwealth, whether _Titus_ or _Mævius_ profits of a legacy, or\r\nwhether _John à Nokes_ or _John à Stiles_ is seized of the manor of\r\n_Dale_. For which reason, in many cases, the private interests of men\r\nare left by courts to suffer by their own neglects and their own want of\r\nvigilance, as their fortunes are permitted to suffer from the same\r\ncauses in all the concerns of common life. But in crimes, where the\r\nprosecution is on the part of the public, (as all criminal prosecutions\r\nare, except appeals,) the public prosecutor ought not to be considered\r\nas a plaintiff in a cause of _meum et tuum_; nor the prisoner, in such a\r\ncause, as a common defendant. In such a cause the state itself is highly\r\nconcerned in the event: on the other hand, the prisoner may lose life,\r\nwhich all the wealth and power of all the states in the world cannot\r\nrestore to him. Undoubtedly the state ought not to be weighed against\r\njustice; but it would be dreadful indeed, if causes of such importance\r\nshould be sacrificed to petty regulations, of mere secondary\r\nconvenience, not at all adapted to such concerns, nor even made with a\r\nview to their existence. Your Committee readily adopts the opinion of\r\nthe learned Ryder, that it would be better, if there were no such rules,\r\nthan that there should be no exceptions to them. Lord Hardwicke declared\r\nvery properly, in the case of the Earl of Chesterfield against Sir\r\nAbraham Janssen, \"that political arguments, in the fullest sense of the\r\nword, as they concerned the government of a nation, must be, and always\r\nhave been, of great weight in the consideration of this court. Though\r\nthere be no _dolus malus_ in contracts, with regard to other persons,\r\nyet, if the rest of mankind are concerned as well as the parties, it\r\nmay be properly said, it regards the public utility.\"[76] Lord Hardwicke\r\nlaid this down in a cause of _meum et tuum_, between party and party,\r\nwhere the public was concerned only remotely and in the example,--not,\r\nas in this prosecution, when the political arguments are infinitely\r\nstronger, the crime relating, and in the most eminent degree relating,\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nOne case has happened since the time which is limited by the order of\r\nthe House for this Report: it is so very important, that we think\r\nourselves justified in submitting it to the House without delay. Your\r\nCommittee, on the supposed rules here alluded to, has been prevented (as\r\nof right) from examining a witness of importance in the case, and one on\r\nwhose supposed knowledge of his most hidden transactions the prisoner\r\nhad himself, in all stages of this business, as the House well knows,\r\nendeavored to raise presumptions in favor of his cause. Indeed, it was\r\nhis principal, if not only justification, as to the _intention_, in many\r\ndifferent acts of corruption charged upon him. The witness to whom we\r\nallude is Mr. Larkins. This witness came from India after your Committee\r\nhad closed the evidence of this House in chief, and could not be\r\nproduced before the time of the reply. Your Committee was not suffered\r\nto examine him,--not, as they could find, on objections to the\r\nparticular question as improper, but upon some or other of the general\r\ngrounds (as they believe) on which Mr. Hastings resisted any evidence\r\nfrom him. The party, after having resisted his production, on the next\r\nsitting day admitted him, and by consent he was examined. Your\r\nCommittee entered a protest on the minutes in favor of their right. Your\r\nCommittee contended, and do contend, that, by the Law of Parliament,\r\nwhilst the trial lasts, they have full right to call new evidence, as\r\nthe circumstances may afford and the posture of the cause may demand it.\r\n\r\nThis right seems to have been asserted by the Managers for the Commons\r\nin the case of Lord Stafford, 32 Charles II.[77] The Managers in that\r\ncase claimed it as the right of the Commons to produce witnesses for the\r\npurpose of fortifying their former evidence. Their claim was admitted by\r\nthe court. It is an adjudged case in the Law of Parliament. Your\r\nCommittee is well aware that the notorious perjury and infamy of the\r\nwitnesses in the trial of Lord Stafford has been used to throw a shade\r\nof doubt and suspicion on all that was transacted on that occasion. But\r\nthere is no force in such an objection. Your Committee has no concern in\r\nthe defence of these witnesses, nor of the Lords who found their verdict\r\non such testimony, nor of the morality of those who produced it. Much\r\nmay be said to palliate errors on the part of the prosecutors and\r\njudges, from the heat of the times, arising from the great interests\r\nthen agitated. But it is plain there may be perjury in witnesses, or\r\neven conspiracy unjustly to prosecute, without the least doubt of the\r\nlegality and regularity of the proceedings in any part. This is too\r\nobvious and too common to need argument or illustration. The proceeding\r\nin Lord Stafford's case never has, now for an hundred and fourteen\r\nyears, either in the warm controversies of parties, or in the cool\r\ndisquisitions of lawyers or historians, been questioned. The perjury of\r\nthe witnesses has been more doubted at some periods than the regularity\r\nof the process has been at any period. The learned lawyer who led for\r\nthe Commons in that impeachment (Serjeant Maynard) had, near forty years\r\nbefore, taken a forward part in the great cause of the impeachment of\r\nLord Strafford, and was, perhaps, of all men then in England, the most\r\nconversant in the law and usage of Parliament. Jones was one of the\r\nablest lawyers of his age. His colleagues were eminent men.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of Lord Strafford, (which has attracted the attention of\r\nhistory more than any other, on account of the importance of the cause\r\nitself, the skill and learning of the prosecutors, and the eminent\r\nabilities of the prisoner,) after the prosecutors for the Commons had\r\ngone through their evidence on the articles, after the prisoner had also\r\nmade his defence, either upon each severally, or upon each body of\r\narticles as they had been collected into one, and the Managers had in\r\nthe same manner replied, when, previous to the general concluding reply\r\nof the prosecutors, the time of the general summing up (or recollection,\r\nas it was called) of the whole evidence on the part of Lord Strafford\r\narrived, the Managers produced new evidence. Your Committee wishes to\r\ncall the particular attention of the House to this case, as the contest\r\nbetween the parties did very nearly resemble the present, but\r\nprincipally because the sense of the Lords on the Law of Parliament, in\r\nits proceedings with regard to the reception of evidence, is there\r\ndistinctly laid down: so is the report of the Judges, relative to the\r\nusage of the courts below, full of equity and reason, and in perfect\r\nconformity with the right for which we contended in favor of the public,\r\nand in favor of the Court of Peers itself. The matter is as follows.\r\nYour Committee gives it at large.\r\n\r\n\"After this, the Lord Steward adjourned this House to Westminster Hall;\r\nand the Peers being all set there in their places, the Lord Steward\r\ncommanded the Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth the Earl of\r\nStrafford to the bar; which being done, the Lord Steward signified that\r\nboth sides might make a recollection of their evidence, and the Earl of\r\nStrafford to begin first.\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon Mr. Glynn desired that before the Earl of Strafford began,\r\nthat the Commons might produce two witnesses to the fifteenth and\r\ntwenty-third articles, to prove that there be two men whose names are\r\nBerne; and so a mistake will be made clear. The Earl of Strafford\r\ndesired that no new witnesses may be admitted against him, unless he\r\nmight be permitted to produce witnesses on his part likewise; which the\r\nCommons consented to, so the Earl of Strafford would confine himself to\r\nthose articles upon which he made reservations: but he not agreeing to\r\nthat, and the Commons insisting upon it, the House was adjourned to the\r\nusual place above to consider of it; and after some debate, their\r\nLordships thought it fit that the members of the Commons go on in\r\nproducing new witnesses, as they shall think fit, to the fifteenth and\r\ntwenty-third articles, and that the Earl of Strafford may presently\r\nproduce such witnesses as are present, and such as are not, to name them\r\npresently, and to proceed on Monday next; and also, if the Commons and\r\nEarl of Strafford will proceed upon any other articles, upon new matter,\r\nthey are to name the witnesses and articles on both sides presently, and\r\nto proceed on Monday next: but both sides may waive it, if they will.\r\nThe Lord Steward adjourned this House to Westminster Hall, and, being\r\nreturned thither, signified what the Lords had thought fit for the\r\nbetter proceeding in the business. The Earl of Strafford, upon this,\r\ndesiring not to be limited to any reservation, but to be at liberty for\r\nwhat articles are convenient for him to fortify with new witnesses,[78]\r\nto which the Commons not assenting, and for other scruples which did\r\narise in the case, one of the Peers did desire that the House might be\r\nadjourned, to consider further of the particulars. Hereupon the Lord\r\nSteward adjourned the House to the usual place above.\r\n\r\n\"The Lords, being come up into the House, fell into debate of the\r\nbusiness, and, for the better informing of their judgments what was the\r\ncourse and common justice of the kingdom, propounded this question to\r\nthe Judges: 'Whether it be according to the course of practice and\r\ncommon justice, before the Judges in their several courts, for the\r\nprosecutors in behalf of the King, _during the time of trial, to produce\r\nwitnesses to discover the truth_, and whether the prisoner may not do\r\nthe like?' The Lord Chief-Justice delivered this as the unanimous\r\nopinions of himself and all the rest of the Judges: 'That, according to\r\nthe course of practice and common justice, before them in their several\r\ncourts, upon trial by jury, _as long as the prisoner is at the bar, and\r\nthe jury not sent away_, either side may give their evidence and examine\r\nwitnesses to discover truth; and this is all the opinion as we can give\r\nconcerning the proceedings before us.' Upon, some consideration after\r\nthis, the House appointed the Earl of Bath, Earl of South'ton, Earl of\r\nHartford, Earl of Essex, Earl of Bristol, and the Lord Viscount Say et\r\nSeale to draw up some reasons upon which the former order was made,\r\nwhich, being read as followeth, were approved of, as the order of the\r\nHouse: 'The gentlemen of the House of Commons did declare, that they\r\nchallenge to themselves, by the common justice of the kingdom, that\r\nthey, being prosecutors for the King, may bring any new proofs by\r\nwitnesses during the time of the evidence being not fully concluded. The\r\nLords, being judges, and so equal to them and the prisoner, conceived\r\nthis their desire to be just and reasonable; and also that, by the same\r\ncommon justice, the prisoner may use the same liberty; and that, to\r\navoid any occasions of delay, the Lords thought fit that the articles\r\nand witnesses be presently named, and such as may be presently produced\r\nto be used presently, [and such as cannot to be used on Monday,] and no\r\nfurther time to be given.' The Lord Steward was to let them know, that,\r\nif they will on both sides waive the use of new witnesses, they may\r\nproceed to the recollection of their evidence on both sides; if both\r\nsides will not waive it, then the Lord Steward is to read the precedent\r\norder; and if they will not proceed then, this House is to adjourn and\r\nrise.\"[79]\r\n\r\nBy this it will appear to the House how much this exclusion of evidence,\r\n_brought for the discovery of truth_, is unsupported either by\r\nParliamentary precedent or by the rule as understood in the Common Law\r\ncourts below; and your Committee (protesting, however, against being\r\nbound by any of the technical rules of inferior courts) thought, and\r\nthink, they had a right to see such a body of precedents and arguments\r\nfor the rejection of evidence during trial, in some court or other,\r\nbefore they were in this matter stopped and concluded.\r\n\r\nYour Committee has not been able to examine every criminal trial in the\r\nvoluminous collection of the State Trials, or elsewhere; but having\r\nreferred to the most laborious compiler of law and equity, Mr. Viner,\r\nwho has allotted a whole volume to the title of Evidence, we find but\r\none ruled case in a trial at Common Law, before or since, where new\r\nevidence for the discovery of truth has been rejected, as not being in\r\ndue time. \"A privy verdict had been given in B. R. 14 Eliz. for the\r\ndefendant; but afterwards, before the inquest gave their verdict openly,\r\nthe plaintiff prayed that he might give more evidence to the jury, he\r\nhaving (as it seemed) discovered that the jury had found against him:\r\nbut the Justices would not admit him to do so; but after that Southcote\r\nJ. had been in C.B. to ask the opinion of the Justices there, they took\r\nthe verdict.\"[80] In this case the offer of new evidence was not during\r\nthe trial. The trial was over; the verdict was actually delivered to the\r\nJudge; there was also an appearance that the discovery of the actual\r\nfinding had suggested to the plaintiff the production of new evidence.\r\nYet it appeared to the Judges so strong a measure to refuse evidence,\r\nwhilst any, even formal, appearance remained that the trial was not\r\nclosed, that they sent a Judge from the bench into the Common Pleas to\r\nobtain the opinion of their brethren there, before they could venture to\r\ntake upon them to consider the time for production of evidence as\r\nelapsed. The case of refusal, taken with its circumstances, is full as\r\nstrong an example in favor of the report of the Judges in Lord\r\nStrafford's case as any precedent of admittance can be.\r\n\r\nThe researches of your Committee not having furnished them with any\r\ncases in which evidence has been rejected during the trial, as being out\r\nof time, we have found some instances in which it has been actually\r\nreceived,--and received not to repel any new matter in the prisoner's\r\ndefence, but when the prisoner had called all his witnesses, and thereby\r\nclosed his defence. A remarkable instance occurred on the trial of\r\nHarrison for the murder of Dr. Clenche. The Justices who tried the\r\ncause, viz., Lord Chief-Justice Holt, and the Justices Atkins and Nevil,\r\nadmitted the prosecutor to call new evidence, for no other reason but\r\nthat a new witness was then come into court, who had not been in court\r\nbefore.[81] These Justices apparently were of the same opinion on this\r\npoint with the Justices who gave their opinion in the case of Lord\r\nStafford.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, on this point, as on the former, cannot discover any\r\nauthority for the decision of the House of Lords in the Law of\r\nParliament, or in the law practice of any court in this kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICE BELOW.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, not having learned that the resolutions of the Judges\r\n(by which the Lords have been guided) were supported by any authority in\r\nlaw to which they could have access, have heard by rumor that they have\r\nbeen justified upon the practice of the courts in ordinary trials by\r\ncommission of Oyer and Terminer. To give any legal precision to this\r\nterm of _practice_, as thus applied, your Committee apprehends it must\r\nmean, that the judge in those criminal trials has so regularly rejected\r\na certain kind of evidence, when offered there, that it is to be\r\nregarded in the light of a case frequently determined by legal\r\nauthority. If such had been discovered, though your Committee never\r\ncould have allowed these precedents as rules for the guidance of the\r\nHigh Court of Parliament, yet they should not be surprised to see the\r\ninferior judges forming their opinions on their own confined practice.\r\nYour Committee, in their inquiry, has found comparatively few reports of\r\ncriminal trials, except the collection under the title of \"State\r\nTrials,\" a book compiled from materials of very various authority; and\r\nin none of those which we have seen is there, as appears to us, a single\r\nexample of the rejection of evidence similar to that rejected by the\r\nadvice of the Judges in the House of Lords. Neither, if such examples\r\ndid exist, could your Committee allow them to apply directly and\r\nnecessarily, as a measure of reason, to the proceedings of a court\r\nconstituted so very differently from those in which the Common Law is\r\nadministered. In the trials below, the Judges decide on the competency\r\nof the evidence before it goes to the jury, and (under the correctives,\r\nin the use of their discretion, stated before in this Report) with great\r\npropriety and wisdom. Juries are taken promiscuously from the mass of\r\nthe people. They are composed of men who, in many instances, in most\r\nperhaps, never were concerned in any causes, judicially or otherwise,\r\nbefore the time of their service. They have generally no previous\r\npreparation, or possible knowledge of the matters to be tried, or what\r\nis applicable or inapplicable to them; and they decide in a space of\r\ntime too short for any nice or critical disquisition. The Judges,\r\ntherefore, of necessity, must forestall the evidence, where there is a\r\ndoubt on its competence, and indeed observe much on its credibility, or\r\nthe most dreadful consequences might follow. The institution of juries,\r\nif not thus qualified, could not exist. Lord Mansfield makes the same\r\nobservation with regard to another corrective of the short mode of\r\ntrial,--that of a _new trial_.\r\n\r\nThis is the law, and this its policy. The jury are not to decide on the\r\ncompetency of witnesses, or of any other kind of evidence, in any way\r\nwhatsoever. Nothing of that kind can come before them. But the Lords in\r\nthe High Court of Parliament are not, either actually or virtually, a\r\njury. No legal power is interposed between them and evidence; they are\r\nthemselves by law fully and exclusively equal to it. They are persons of\r\nhigh rank, generally of the best education, and of sufficient knowledge\r\nof the world; and they are a permanent, a settled, a corporate, and not\r\nan occasional and transitory judicature. But it is to be feared that the\r\nauthority of the Judges (in the case of juries legal) may, from that\r\nexample, weigh with the Lords further than its reason or its\r\napplicability to the judicial capacity of the Peers can support. It is\r\nto be feared, that if the Lords should think themselves bound implicitly\r\nto submit to this authority, that at length they may come to think\r\nthemselves to be no better than jurors, and may virtually consent to a\r\npartition of that judicature which the law has left to them whole,\r\nsupreme, uncontrolled, and final.\r\n\r\nThis final and independent judicature, because it is final and\r\nindependent, ought to be very cautious with regard to the rejection of\r\nevidence. If incompetent evidence is received by them, there is nothing\r\nto hinder their judging upon it afterwards according to its value: it\r\nmay have no weight in their judgment. But if, upon advice of others,\r\nthey previously reject information necessary to their proper judgment,\r\nthey have no intermediate means of setting themselves right, and they\r\ninjure the cause of justice without any remedy. Against errors of juries\r\nthere is remedy by a new trial. Against errors of judges there is\r\nremedy, in civil causes, by demurrer and bills of exceptions; against\r\ntheir final mistake there is remedy by writ of error, in courts of\r\nCommon Law. In Chancery there is a remedy by appeal. If they wilfully\r\nerr in the rejection of evidence, there was formerly the terror existing\r\nof punishment by impeachment of the Commons. But with regard to the\r\nLords, there is no remedy for error, no punishment for a wilful wrong.\r\n\r\nYour Committee conceives it not improbable that this apparently total\r\nand unreserved submission of the Lords to the dictates of the judges of\r\nthe inferior courts (no proper judges, in any light or in any degree, of\r\nthe Law of Parliament) may be owing to the very few causes of _original_\r\njurisdiction, and the great multitude of those of _appellate_\r\njurisdiction, which come before them. In cases of appeal, or of error,\r\n(which is in the nature of an appeal,) the court of appeal is obliged to\r\njudge, not by _its own_ rules, acting in another capacity, or by those\r\nwhich it shall choose _pro re nata_ to make, but by the rules of the\r\ninferior court from whence the appeal comes. For the fault or the\r\nmistake of the inferior judge is, that he has not proceeded, as he ought\r\nto do, according to the law which he was to administer; and the\r\ncorrection, if such shall take place, is to compel the court from\r\nwhence the appeal comes to act as originally it ought to have acted,\r\naccording to law, as the law ought to have been understood and practised\r\nin that tribunal. The Lords, in such cases of necessity, judge on the\r\ngrounds of the law and practice of the courts below; and this they can\r\nvery rarely learn with precision, but from the body of the Judges. Of\r\ncourse much deference is and ought to be had to their opinions. But by\r\nthis means a confusion may arise (if not well guarded against) between\r\nwhat they do in their _appellate_ jurisdiction, which is frequent, and\r\nwhat they ought to do in their _original_ jurisdiction, which is rare;\r\nand by this the whole original jurisdiction of the Peers, and the whole\r\nlaw and usage of Parliament, at least in their virtue and spirit, may be\r\nconsiderably impaired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter having thus submitted to the House the general tenor of the\r\nproceedings in this trial, your Committee will, with all convenient\r\nspeed, lay before the House the proceedings on each head of evidence\r\nseparately which has been rejected; and this they hope will put the\r\nHouse more perfectly in possession of the principal causes of the length\r\nof this trial, as well as of the injury which Parliamentary justice may,\r\nin their opinion, suffer from those proceedings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] 4 Inst. p. 4.\r\n\r\n[2] Rol.

His Lordship added many\r\nweighty reasons in support of the opinion, which he urged with great\r\nstrength and propriety, and delivered with a becoming dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Second Question._\r\n\r\n\"Supposing the day appointed by the judgment for execution should lapse\r\nbefore such execution done, (which, however, the law will not presume,)\r\nwe are all of opinion that a new time may be appointed for the\r\nexecution, either by the High Court of Parliament, before which such\r\npeer shall have been attainted, or by the Court of King's Bench, the\r\nParliament not then sitting: the record of the attainder being properly\r\nremoved into that court.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons upon which the Judges founded their answer to the question\r\nrelating to the further proceedings of the House after the High\r\nSteward's commission dissolved, which is usually done upon pronouncing\r\njudgment, may possibly require some further discussion. I will,\r\ntherefore, before I conclude, mention those which weighed with me, and,\r\nI believe, with many others of the Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reasons, &c._\r\n\r\nEvery proceeding in the House of Peers, acting in its judicial capacity,\r\nwhether upon writ of error, impeachment, or indictment, removed thither\r\nby _Certiorari_, is in judgment of law a proceeding before the King in\r\nParliament; and therefore the House, in all those cases, may not\r\nimproperly be styled the Court of our Lord the King in Parliament. This\r\ncourt is founded upon immemorial usage, upon the law and custom of\r\nParliament, and is part of the original system of our Constitution. It\r\nis open for all the purposes of judicature, during the continuance of\r\nthe Parliament: it openeth at the beginning and shutteth at the end of\r\nevery session: just as the Court of King's Bench, which, is likewise in\r\njudgment of law held before the King himself, openeth and shutteth with\r\nthe term. The authority of this court, or, if I may use the expression,\r\nits constant activity for the ends of public justice, independent of any\r\nspecial powers derived from the Crown, is not doubted in the case of\r\nwrits of error from those courts of law whence error lieth in\r\nParliament, and of impeachments for misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly doubted, whether, in the case of an impeachment for\r\ntreason, and in the case of an indictment against a peer for any capital\r\ncrime, removed into Parliament by _Certiorari_, whether in these cases\r\nthe court can proceed to trial and judgment without an High Steward\r\nappointed by special commission from the Crown. This doubt seemeth to\r\nhave arisen from the not distinguishing between a proceeding in the\r\nCourt of the High Steward and that before the King in Parliament. The\r\nname, style, and title of office is the same in both cases: but the\r\noffice, the powers and preëminences annexed to it, differ very widely;\r\nand so doth the constitution of the courts where the offices are\r\nexecuted. The identity of the name may have confounded our ideas, as\r\nequivocal words often do, if the nature of things is not attended to;\r\nbut the nature of the offices, properly stated, will, I hope, remove\r\nevery doubt on these points.\r\n\r\nIn the Court of the High Steward, he alone is judge in all points of law\r\nand practice; the peers triers are merely judges of fact, and are\r\nsummoned by virtue of a precept from the High Steward to appear before\r\nhim on the day appointed by him for the trial, _ut rei veritas melius\r\nsciri poterit_. The High Steward's commission, after reciting that an\r\nindictment hath been found against the peer by the grand jury of the\r\nproper county, impowereth him to send for the indictment, to convene the\r\nprisoner before him at such day and place as he shall appoint, then and\r\nthere to hear and determine the matter of such indictment; to cause the\r\npeers triers, _tot et tales, per quos rei veritas melius sciri poterit_,\r\nat the same day and place to appear before him; _veritateque inde\r\ncompertâ_, to proceed to judgment according to the law and custom of\r\nEngland, and thereupon to award execution.[82] By this it is plain that\r\nthe sole right of judicature is in cases of this kind vested in the High\r\nSteward; that it resideth solely in his person; and consequently,\r\nwithout this commission, which is but in nature of a commission of Oyer\r\nand Terminer, no one step can be taken in order to a trial; and that\r\nwhen his commission is dissolved, which he declareth by breaking his\r\nstaff, the court no longer existeth.\r\n\r\nBut in a trial of a peer in full Parliament, or, to speak with legal\r\nprecision, before the King in Parliament, for a capital offence, whether\r\nupon impeachment or indictment, the case is quite otherwise. Every peer\r\npresent at the trial (and every temporal peer hath a right to be present\r\nin every part of the proceeding) voteth upon every question of law and\r\nfact, and the question is carried by the major vote: the High Steward\r\nhimself voting merely as a peer and member of that court, in common with\r\nthe rest of the peers, and in no other right.\r\n\r\nIt hath, indeed, been usual, and very expedient it is, in point of order\r\nand regularity, and for the solemnity of the proceeding, to appoint an\r\nofficer for presiding during the time of the trial, and until judgment,\r\nand to give him the style and title of Steward of England: but this\r\nmaketh no sort of alteration in the constitution of the court; it is the\r\nsame court, founded in immemorial usage, in the law and custom of\r\nParliament, whether such appointment be made or not. It acteth in its\r\njudicial capacity in every order made touching the time and place of the\r\ntrial, the postponing the trial from time to time upon petition,\r\naccording to the nature and circumstances of the case, the allowance or\r\nnon-allowance of council to the prisoner, and other matters relative to\r\nthe trial;[83] and all this before an High Steward hath been appointed.\r\nAnd so little was it apprehended, in some cases which I shall mention\r\npresently, that the existence of the court depended on the appointment\r\nof an High Steward, that the court itself directed in what manner and by\r\nwhat form of words he should be appointed. It hath likewise received and\r\nrecorded the prisoner's confession, which amounteth to a conviction,\r\nbefore the appointment of an High Steward; and hath allowed to prisoners\r\nthe benefit of acts of general pardon, where they appeared entitled to\r\nit, as well without the appointment of an High Steward as after his\r\ncommission dissolved. And when, in the case of impeachments, the Commons\r\nhave sometimes, at conferences between the Houses, attempted to\r\ninterpose in matters preparatory to the trial, the general answer hath\r\nbeen, \"This is a point of judicature upon which the Lords will not\r\nconfer; they impose silence upon themselves,\"--or to that effect. I need\r\nnot here cite instances; every man who hath consulted the Journals of\r\neither House hath met with many of them.\r\n\r\nI will now cite a few cases, applicable, in my opinion, to the present\r\nquestion. And I shall confine myself to such as have happened since the\r\nRestoration; because, in questions of this kind, modern cases, settled\r\nwith deliberation, and upon a view of former precedents, give more light\r\nand satisfaction than the deepest search into antiquity can afford; and\r\nalso because the prerogatives of the Crown, the privileges of\r\nParliament, and the rights of the subject in general appear to me to\r\nhave been more studied and better understood at and for some years\r\nbefore that period than in former ages.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Earl of Danby and the Popish lords then under\r\nimpeachments, the Lords,[84] on the 6th of May, 1679, appointed time and\r\nplace for hearing the Earl of Danby, by his council, upon the validity\r\nof his plea of pardon, and for the trials of the other lords, and voted\r\nan address to his Majesty, praying that he would be pleased to appoint\r\nan High Steward for those purposes. These votes were, on the next day,\r\ncommunicated to the Commons by message in the usual manner. On the 8th,\r\nat a conference between the Houses upon the subject-matter of that\r\nmessage, the Commons expressed themselves to the following\r\neffect:--\"They cannot apprehend what should induce your Lordships to\r\naddress his Majesty for an High Steward, for determining the validity of\r\nthe pardon which hath been pleaded by the Earl of Danby, as also for the\r\ntrial of the other five lords, because they conceive the constituting\r\nan High Steward is not necessary, but that judgment may be given in\r\nParliament upon impeachment without an High Steward\"; and concluded with\r\na proposition, that, for avoiding any interruption or delay, a committee\r\nof both Houses might be nominated, to consider of the most proper ways\r\nand methods of proceeding. This proposition the House of Peers, after a\r\nlong debate, rejected: _Dissentientibus_, Finch,[85] Chancellor, and\r\nmany other lords. However, on the 11th, the Commons' proposition of the\r\n8th was upon a second debate agreed to; and the Lord Chancellor, Lord\r\nPresident, and ten other lords, were named of the committee, to meet and\r\nconfer with a committee of the Commons. The next day the Lord President\r\nreported, that the committees of both Houses met that morning, and made\r\nan entrance into the business referred to them: that the Commons desired\r\nto see the commissions that are prepared for an High Steward at these\r\ntrials, and also the commissions in the Lord Pembroke's and the Lord\r\nMorley's cases: that to this the Lords' committees said,--\"_The High\r\nSteward is but Speaker pro tempore, and giveth his vote as well as the\r\nother lords; this changeth not the nature of the court_; and the Lords\r\ndeclared, they have power enough to proceed to trial, though the King\r\nshould not name an High Steward:[86] that this seemed to be a\r\nsatisfaction to the Commons, provided it was entered in the Lords'\r\nJournals, which are records.\" Accordingly, on the same day, \"_It is\r\ndeclared and ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament\r\nassembled, that the office of an High Steward, upon trials of peers upon\r\nimpeachments, is not necessary to the House of Peers; but that the Lords\r\nmay proceed in such trials, if an High Steward be not appointed\r\naccording to their humble desire._\"[87] On the 13th the Lord President\r\nreported, that the committees of both Houses had met that morning, and\r\ndiscoursed, in the first place, on the matter of a Lord High Steward,\r\nand had perused former commissions for the office of High Steward; and\r\nthen, putting the House in mind of the order and resolution of the\r\npreceding day, proposed from the committees that a new commission might\r\nissue, so as the words in the commission may be thus changed: viz.,\r\nInstead of, _Ac pro eo quod officium Seneschalli Angliæ, (cujus\r\npræsentia in hac parte requiritur,) ut accepimus, jam vacat_, may be\r\ninserted, _Ac pro eo quod proceres et magnates in Parliamento nostro\r\nassemblati nobis humiliter supplicaverunt ut Seneschallum Angliæ pro hac\r\nvice constituere dignaremur_: to which the House agreed.[88]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that precedents drawn from times of ferment and\r\njealousy, as these were, lose much of their weight, since passion and\r\nparty prejudice generally mingle in the contest; yet let it be\r\nremembered, that these are resolutions in which both Houses concurred,\r\nand in which the rights of both were thought to be very nearly\r\nconcerned,--the Commons' right of impeaching with effect, and the whole\r\njudicature of the Lords in capital cases. For, if the appointment of an\r\nHigh Steward was admitted to be of absolute necessity, (however\r\nnecessary it may be for the regularity and solemnity of the proceeding\r\nduring the trial and until judgment, which I do not dispute,) every\r\nimpeachment may, for a reason too obvious to be mentioned, be rendered\r\nineffectual, and the judicature of the Lords in all capital cases\r\nnugatory.\r\n\r\nIt was from a jealousy of this kind, not at that juncture altogether\r\ngroundless, and to guard against everything from whence the necessity of\r\nan High Steward in the case of an impeachment might be inferred, that\r\nthe Commons proposed and the Lords readily agreed to the amendment in\r\nthe Steward's commission which I have already stated. And it hath, I\r\nconfess, great weight with me, that this amendment, which was at the\r\nsame time directed in the cases of the five Popish lords, when\r\ncommissions should pass for their trials, hath taken place in every\r\ncommission upon impeachments for treason since that time.[89] And I\r\ncannot help remarking, that in the case of Lord Lovat, when neither the\r\nheat of the times nor the jealousy of parties had any share in the\r\nproceeding, the House ordered, \"That the commission for appointing a\r\nLord High Steward shall be in the like form as that for the trial of the\r\nLord Viscount Stafford, as entered in the Journal of this House on the\r\n30th of November, 1680: except that the same shall be in the English\r\nlanguage.\"[90]\r\n\r\nI will make a short observation on this matter. The order, on the 13th\r\nof May, 1679, for varying the form of the commission, was, as appeareth\r\nby the Journal, plainly made in consequence of the resolution of the\r\n12th, and was founded on it; and consequently the constant, unvarying\r\npractice with regard to the new form goeth, in my opinion, a great way\r\ntowards showing, that, in the sense of all succeeding times, that\r\nresolution was not the result of faction or a blamable jealousy, but was\r\nfounded in sound reason and true policy. It may be objected, that the\r\nresolution of the 12th of May, 1679, goeth no further than to a\r\nproceeding upon impeachment. The letter of the resolution, it is\r\nadmitted, goeth no further. But this is easily accounted for: a\r\nproceeding by impeachment was the subject-matter of the conference, and\r\nthe Commons had no pretence to interpose in any other. But what say the\r\nLords? _The High Steward is but as a Speaker or Chairman pro tempore,\r\nfor the more orderly proceeding at the trials; the appointment of him\r\ndoth not alter the nature of the court, which still remaineth the Court\r\nof the Peers in Parliament._ From these premises they draw the\r\nconclusion I have mentioned. Are not these premises equally true in the\r\ncase of a proceeding upon indictment? They undoubtedly are.\r\n\r\nIt must likewise be admitted, that in the proceeding upon indictment the\r\nHigh Steward's commission hath never varied from the ancient form in\r\nsuch cases. The words objected to by the Commons, _Ac pro eo quod\r\nofficium Seneschalli Angliæ, (cujus præsentia in hac parte requiritur,)\r\nut accepimus, jam vacat_, are still retained; but this proveth no more\r\nthan that the Great Seal, having no authority to vary in point of form,\r\nhath from time to time very prudently followed ancient precedents.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the substance of the commission in a proceeding in\r\nthe Court of the High Steward. I will now state the substance of that in\r\na proceeding in the Court of the Peers in Parliament; and shall make use\r\nof that in the case of the Earl of Kilmarnock and others, as being the\r\nlatest, and in point of form agreeing with the former precedents. The\r\ncommission, after reciting that William, Earl of Kilmarnock, &c., stand\r\nindicted before commissioners of gaol-delivery in the County of Surrey,\r\nfor high treason, in levying war against the King, and that the King\r\nintendeth that the said William, Earl of Kilmarnock, &c., shall be\r\nheard, examined, sentenced, and adjudged before himself, in this present\r\nParliament, touching the said treason, and for that the office of\r\nSteward of Great Britain (whose presence is required upon this\r\noccasion) is now vacant, as we are informed, appointeth the then Lord\r\nChancellor Steward of Great Britain, to bear, execute, and exercise (for\r\nthis time) the said office, with all things due and belonging to the\r\nsame office, in that behalf.\r\n\r\nWhat, therefore, are the things due and belonging to the office in a\r\ncase of this kind? Not, as in the Court of the High Steward, a right of\r\njudicature; for the commission itself supposeth that right to reside in\r\na court then subsisting before the King in Parliament. The parties are\r\nto be there heard, sentenced, and adjudged. What share in the proceeding\r\ndoth the High Steward, then, take? By the practice and usage of the\r\nCourt of the Peers in Parliament, he giveth his vote as a member\r\nthereof, with the rest of the peers; but, for the sake of regularity and\r\norder, he presideth during the trial and until judgment, as Chairman or\r\nSpeaker _pro tempore_. In that respect, therefore, it may be properly\r\nenough said, that his presence is required during the trial and until\r\njudgment, and in no other. Herein I see no difference between the case\r\nof an impeachment and of an indictment. I say, during the time of the\r\ntrial and until judgment; because the court hath, as I observed before,\r\nfrom time to time done various acts, plainly judicial, before the\r\nappointment of an High Steward, and where no High Steward hath ever been\r\nappointed, and even after the commission dissolved. I will to this\r\npurpose cite a few cases.\r\n\r\nI begin with the latest, because they are the latest, and were ruled\r\nwith great deliberation, and for the most part upon a view of former\r\nprecedents. In the case of the Earl of Kilmarnock and others, the Lords,\r\non the 24th of June, 1746, ordered that a writ or writs of _Certiorari_\r\nbe issued for removing the indictments before the House; and on the\r\n26th, the writ, which is made returnable before the King in Parliament,\r\nwith the return and indictments, was received and read. On the next day,\r\nupon the report of the Lords' committees, that they had been attended\r\nby the two Chief-Justices and Chief-Baron, and had heard them touching\r\nthe construction of the act of the 7th and 8th of King William, \"for\r\nregulating trials in cases of high treason and misprision of treason,\"\r\nthe House, upon reading the report, came to several resolutions, founded\r\nfor the most part on the construction of that act. What that\r\nconstruction was appeareth from the Lord High Steward's address to the\r\nprisoners just before their arraignment. Having mentioned that act as\r\none happy consequence of the Revolution, he addeth,--\"However\r\ninjuriously that revolution hath been traduced, whatever attempts have\r\nbeen made to subvert this happy establishment founded on it, your\r\nLordships will now have the benefit of that law in its full extent.\"\r\n\r\nI need not, after this, mention any other judicial acts done by the\r\nHouse in this case, before the appointment of the High Steward: many\r\nthere are. For the putting a construction upon an act relative to the\r\nconduct of the court and the right of the subject at the trial, and in\r\nthe proceedings preparatory to it, and this in a case entirely new, and\r\nupon a point, to say no more in this place, not extremely clear, was\r\nundoubtedly an exercise of authority proper only for a court having full\r\ncognizance of the cause.\r\n\r\nI will not minutely enumerate the several orders made preparatory to the\r\ntrial of Lord Lovat, and in the several cases I shall have occasion to\r\nmention, touching the time and place of the trial, the allowance or\r\nnon-allowance of council, and other matters of the like kind, all\r\nplainly judicial; because the like orders occur in all the cases where a\r\njournal of the preparatory steps hath been published by order of the\r\nPeers. With regard to Lord Lovat's case, I think the order directing the\r\nform of the High Steward's commission, which I have already taken notice\r\nof, is not very consistent with the idea of a court whose powers can be\r\nsupposed to depend, at any point of time, upon the existence or\r\ndissolution of that commission.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Earl of Derwentwater and the other lords impeached at\r\nthe same time, the House received and recorded the confessions of those\r\nof them who pleaded guilty, long before the _teste_ of the High\r\nSteward's commission, which issued merely for the solemnity of giving\r\njudgment against them upon their conviction. This appeareth by the\r\ncommission itself. It reciteth, that the Earl of Derwentwater and\r\nothers, _coram nobis in præsenti Parliamento_, had been impeached by the\r\nCommons for high treason, and had, _coram nobis in præsenti\r\nParliamento_, pleaded guilty to that impeachment; and that the King,\r\nintending that the said Earl of Derwentwater and others, _de et pro\r\nproditione unde ipsi ut præfertur impetit', accusat', et convict'\r\nexistunt coram nobis in præsenti Parliamento, secundum legem et\r\nconsuetudinem hujus regni nostri Magnæ Britanniæ, audientur,\r\nsententientur, et adjudicentur_, constituteth the then Lord Chancellor\r\nHigh Steward (_hac vice_) to do and execute all things which to the\r\noffice of High Steward in that behalf do belong. The receiving and\r\nrecording the confession of the prisoners, which amounted to a\r\nconviction, so that nothing remained but proceeding to judgment, was\r\ncertainly an exercise of judicial authority, which no assembly, how\r\ngreat soever, not having full cognizance of the cause, could exercise.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Lord Salisbury, who had been impeached by the Commons for\r\nhigh treason, the Lords, upon his petition, allowed him the benefit of\r\nthe act of general pardon passed in the second year of William and Mary,\r\nso far as to discharge him from his imprisonment, upon a construction\r\nthey put upon that act, no High Steward ever having been appointed in\r\nthat case. On the 2d of October, 1690, upon reading the Earl's petition,\r\nsetting forth that he had been a prisoner for a year and nine months in\r\nthe Tower, notwithstanding the late act of free and general pardon, and\r\npraying to be discharged, the Lords ordered the Judges to attend on the\r\nMonday following, to give their opinions whether the said Earl be\r\npardoned by the act. On the 6th the Judges delivered their opinions,\r\nthat, if his offence was committed before the 13th of February, 1688,\r\nand not in Ireland or beyond the seas, he is pardoned. Whereupon it was\r\nordered that he be admitted to bail, and the next day he and his\r\nsureties entered into a recognizance of bail, himself in ten thousand\r\npounds, and two sureties in five thousand pounds each; and on the 30th\r\nhe and his sureties were, after a long debate, discharged from their\r\nrecognizance.[91] It will not be material to inquire whether the House\r\ndid right in discharging the Earl without giving the Commons an\r\nopportunity of being heard; since, in fact, they claimed and exercised a\r\nright of judicature without an High Steward,--which is the only use I\r\nmake of this case.\r\n\r\nThey did the same in the case of the Earl of Carnwarth, the Lords\r\nWiddrington and Nairn, long after the High Steward's commission\r\ndissolved. These lords had judgment passed on them at the same time\r\nthat judgment was given against the Lords Derwentwater, Nithsdale, and\r\nKenmure; and judgment being given, the High Steward immediately broke\r\nhis staff, and declared the commission dissolved. They continued\r\nprisoners in the Tower under reprieves, till the passing the act of\r\ngeneral pardon, in the 3d of King George I. On the 21st of November,\r\n1717, the House being informed that these lords had severally entered\r\ninto recognizances before one of the judges of the Court of King's Bench\r\nfor their appearance in the House in this session of Parliament, and\r\nthat the Lords Carnwarth and Widdrington were attending accordingly, and\r\nthat the Lord Nairn was ill at Bath and could not then attend, the Lords\r\nCarnwarth and Widdrington were called in, and severally at the bar\r\nprayed that their appearance might be recorded; and likewise prayed the\r\nbenefit of the act[92] for his Majesty's general and free pardon.\r\nWhereupon the House ordered that their appearance be recorded, and that\r\nthey attend again to-morrow, in order to plead the pardon; and the\r\nrecognizance of the Lord Nairn was respited till that day fortnight. On\r\nthe morrow the Lords Carnwarth and Widdrington, then attending, were\r\ncalled in; and the Lord Chancellor acquainted them severally, that it\r\nappeared by the records of the House that they severally stood attainted\r\nof high treason, and asked them severally what they had to say why they\r\nshould not be remanded to the Tower of London. Thereupon they severally,\r\nupon their knees, prayed the benefit of the act, and that they might\r\nhave their lives and liberty pursuant thereunto. And the\r\nAttorney-General, who then attended for that purpose, declaring that he\r\nhad no objection on his Majesty's behalf to what was prayed, conceiving\r\nthat those lords, not having made any escape since their conviction,\r\nwere entitled to the benefit of the act, the House, after reading the\r\nclause in the act relating to that matter,[93] agreed that they should\r\nbe allowed the benefit of the pardon, as to their lives and liberties,\r\nand discharged their recognizances, and gave them leave to depart\r\nwithout further day given for their appearance. On the 6th of December\r\nfollowing, the like proceedings were had, and the like orders made, in\r\nthe case of Lord Nairn.[94]\r\n\r\nI observe that the Lord Chancellor did not ask these lords what they had\r\nto say why execution should not be awarded. There was, it is probable,\r\nsome little delicacy as to that point. But since the allowance of the\r\nbenefit of the act, as to life and liberty, which was all that was\r\nprayed, was an effectual bar to any future imprisonment on that account,\r\nand also to execution, and might have been pleaded as such in any court\r\nwhatsoever, the whole proceeding must be admitted to have been in a\r\ncourt having complete jurisdiction in the case, notwithstanding the High\r\nSteward's commission had been long dissolved,--which is all the use I\r\nintended to make of this case.\r\n\r\nI will not recapitulate: the cases I have cited, and the conclusions\r\ndrawn from them, are brought into a very narrow compass. I will only\r\nadd, that it would sound extremely harsh to say, that a court of\r\ncriminal jurisdiction, founded in immemorial usage, and held in judgment\r\nof law before the King himself, can in any event whatever be under an\r\nutter incapacity of proceeding to trial and judgment, either of\r\ncondemnation or acquittal, the ultimate objects of every criminal\r\nproceeding, without certain supplemental powers derived from the Crown.\r\n\r\nThese cases, with the observations I have made on them, I hope\r\nsufficiently warrant the opinion of the Judges upon that part of the\r\nsecond question, in the case of the late Earl Ferrers, which I have\r\nalready mentioned,--and also what was advanced by the Lord Chief-Baron\r\nin his argument on that question,--\"That, though the office of High\r\nSteward should happen to determine before execution done according to\r\nthe judgment, yet the Court of the Peers in Parliament, where that\r\njudgment was given, would subsist for all the purposes of justice during\r\nthe sitting of the Parliament,\" and consequently, that, in the case\r\nsupposed by the question, that court might appoint a new day for the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n     Questions referred by the Lords to the Judges, in the Impeachment\r\n     of Warren Hastings, Esquire, and the Answers of the\r\n     Judges.--Extracted from the Lords' Journals and Minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First._\r\n\r\n_Question._--Whether, when a witness produced and examined in a criminal\r\nproceeding by a prosecutor disclaims all knowledge of any matter so\r\ninterrogated, it be competent for such prosecutor to pursue such\r\nexamination, by proposing a question containing the particulars of an\r\nanswer supposed to have been made by such witness before a committee of\r\nthe House of Commons, or in any other place, and by demanding of him\r\nwhether the particulars so suggested were not the answer he had so made?\r\n\r\n    1788, February 29.--Pa. 418.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The Lord Chief-Baron of the Court of Exchequer delivered the\r\nunanimous opinion of the Judges upon the question of law put to them on\r\nFriday, the 29th of February last, as follows:--\"That, when a witness\r\nproduced and examined in a criminal proceeding by a prosecutor disclaims\r\nall knowledge of any matter so interrogated, it is not competent for\r\nsuch prosecutor to pursue such examination, by proposing a question\r\ncontaining the particulars of an answer supposed to have been made by\r\nsuch witness before a committee of the House of Commons, or in any other\r\nplace, and by demanding of him whether the particulars so suggested were\r\nnot the answer he had so made.\"\r\n\r\n    1788, April 10.--Pa.

Governor-General, charging Mr. Hastings with\r\ncorruptly receiving 3,54,105 rupees, which examination came to his\r\nknowledge, and was by him transmitted to the Court of Directors as a\r\nproceeding of the said Councillors, in order to introduce the proof of\r\nhis demeanor thereupon,--it being alleged by the Managers for the\r\nCommons, that he took no steps to clear himself, in the opinion of the\r\nsaid Directors, of the guilt thereby imputed, but that he took active\r\nmeans to prevent the examination by the said Councillors of his servant\r\nCantoo Baboo?\r\n\r\n    1789, May 14--Pa. 677.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The Lord Chief-Baron of the Court of Exchequer delivered the\r\nunanimous opinion of the Judges upon the said question, in

Council, the\r\nConsultation of the 20th of March, 1775, the letter written by Mr.\r\nHastings to the Court of Directors on the 25th of March, 1775, (it being\r\nalleged that Mr. Hastings took no steps to explain or defend his\r\nconduct,) are sufficient to introduce the examination of Nundcomar, or\r\nthe proceedings of the rest of the Councillors, on said 13th of March,\r\nafter Mr. Hastings left the Council,--such examination and proceedings\r\ncharging Mr. Hastings with, corruptly receiving 3,54,105 rupees?\r\n\r\n    1789, May 21.--Pa. 730.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *

likewise without objection\r\nto the Court of Directors, and alleged to contain accounts of money\r\nreceived by Mr. Hastings,--and it being in proof, that Mr. Hastings, on\r\nthe 11th of May, 1778, moved the Board to comply with the requisitions\r\nof the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah to reappoint the Munny Begum and Rajah\r\nGourdas (who made up those accounts) to the respective offices they\r\nbefore filled, and which was accordingly resolved by the Board,--ought\r\nto be read?\r\n\r\n    1789, June 17.--Pa. 855.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The

instructions from the Court of\r\nDirectors as the occasion might seem to require,--may be admitted as\r\nevidence of the actual state and situation of the Nabob with reference\r\nto the English government?\r\n\r\n    1789, July 2.--Pa. 1001.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The Lord Chief-Baron of the Court of Exchequer delivered the\r\nunanimous opinion of

This pamphlet was, he said, scandalous\r\n    and indecent, and such as he thought ought not to pass unnoticed. He\r\n    considered the vilifying and misrepresenting the conduct of judges\r\n    and magistrates, intrusted with the administration of justice and\r\n    the laws of the country, to be a crime of a very heinous nature, and\r\n    most destructive in its consequences, because it tended to lower\r\n    them in the opinion of those who ought to feel a proper reverence\r\n    and respect for their high and important stations; and that, when it\r\n    was stated to the ignorant or the wicked that their judges and\r\n    magistrates were ignorant and corrupt, it tended to lessen their\r\n    respect for and obedience to the laws themselves, by teaching them\r\n    to think ill of those who administered them.\" On the next day Mr.\r\n    Burke called the attention of the House of Commons to this matter,\r\n    in a speech to the following effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker,--The license of the present times makes it very difficult\r\nfor us to talk upon certain subjects in which Parliamentary order is\r\ninvolved. It is difficult to speak of them with regularity, or to be\r\nsilent with dignity and wisdom. All our proceedings have been constantly\r\npublished, according to the discretion and ability of individuals out of\r\ndoors, with impunity, almost ever since I came into Parliament. By\r\nusage, the people have obtained something like a prescriptive right to\r\nthis abuse. I do not justify it; but the abuse is now grown so\r\ninveterate that to punish it without previous notice would have an\r\nappearance of hardship, if not injustice. The publications I allude to\r\nare frequently erroneous as well as irregular, but they are not always\r\nso; what they give as the reports and resolutions of this House have\r\nsometimes been given correctly. And it has not been uncommon to attack\r\nthe proceedings of the House itself under color of attacking these\r\nirregular publications. Notwithstanding, however, this colorable plea,\r\nthis House has in some instances proceeded to punish the persons who\r\nhave thus insulted it. You will here, too, remark, Sir, that, when a\r\ncomplaint is made of a piratical edition of a work, the authenticity of\r\nthe original work is admitted, and whoever attacks the matter of the\r\nwork itself in these unauthorized publications does not attack it less\r\nthan if he had attacked it in an edition authorized by the writer.\r\n\r\nI understand, Sir, that in a place which I greatly respect, and by a\r\nperson for whom I have likewise a great veneration, a pamphlet published\r\nby a Mr. Debrett has been very heavily censured. That pamphlet, I hear,\r\n(for I have not read it,) purports to be a Report made by one of your\r\nCommittees to this House. It has been censured, as I am told, by the\r\nperson and in the place I have mentioned, in very harsh and very\r\nunqualified terms. It has been there said, (and so far very truly,) that\r\nat all times, and particularly at this time, it is necessary, for the\r\npreservation of order and the execution of the law, that the characters\r\nand reputation of the Judges of the Courts in Westminster Hall should be\r\nkept in the highest degree of respect and reverence; and that in this\r\npamphlet, described by the name of a libel, the characters and conduct\r\nof those Judges upon a late occasion have been aspersed, as arising from\r\nignorance or corruption.\r\n\r\nSir, combining all the circumstances, I think it impossible not to\r\nsuppose that this speech does reflect upon a Report which, by an order\r\nof the Committee on which I served, I had the honor of presenting to\r\nthis House. For anything improper in that Report I am responsible, as\r\nwell as the members of the Committee, to this House, and to this House\r\nonly. The matters contained in it, and the observations upon them, are\r\nsubmitted to the wisdom of the House, that you may act upon both in the\r\ntime and manner that to your judgment may seem most expedient,--or that\r\nyou may not act upon them at all, if you should think that most\r\nexpedient for the public good. Your Committee has obeyed your orders; it\r\nhas done its duty in making that Report.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion, with the eminent person by whom that Report is\r\ncensured, that it is necessary at this time very particularly that the\r\nauthority of Judges should be preserved and supported. This, however,\r\ndoes not depend so much upon us as upon themselves. It is necessary to\r\npreserve the dignity and respect of all the constitutional authorities.\r\nThis, too, depends in part upon ourselves. It is necessary to preserve\r\nthe respect due to the House of Lords: it is full as necessary to\r\npreserve the respect due to the House of Commons, upon which (whatever\r\nmay be thought of us by some persons) the weight and force of all other\r\nauthorities within this kingdom essentially depend. If the power of the\r\nHouse of Commons be degraded or enervated, no other can stand. We must\r\nbe true to ourselves. We ought to animadvert upon any of our members who\r\nabuse the trust we place in them; we must support those who, without\r\nregard to consequences, perform their duty.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the matter which I am now submitting to your\r\nconsideration, I must say for your Committee of Managers and for myself,\r\nthat the Report was deliberately made, and does not, as I conceive,\r\ncontain any very material error, nor any undue or indecent reflection\r\nupon any person or persons whatever. It does not accuse the Judges of\r\nignorance or corruption. Whatever it says it does not say calumniously.\r\nThat kind of language belongs to persons whose eloquence entitles them\r\nto a free use of epithets. The Report states that the Judges had given\r\ntheir opinions secretly, contrary to the almost uninterrupted tenor of\r\nParliamentary usage on such occasions. It states that the mode of giving\r\nthe opinions was unprecedented, and contrary to the privileges of the\r\nHouse of Commons. It states that the Committee did not know upon what\r\nrules and principles the Judges had decided upon those cases, as they\r\nneither heard their opinions delivered, nor have found them entered upon\r\nthe Journals of the House of Lords. It is very true that we were and are\r\nextremely dissatisfied with those opinions, and the consequent\r\ndeterminations of the Lords; and we do not think such a mode of\r\nproceeding at all justified by the most numerous and the best\r\nprecedents. None of these sentiments is the Committee, as I conceive,\r\n(and I feel as little as any of them,) disposed to retract, or to soften\r\nin the smallest degree.\r\n\r\nThe Report speaks for itself. Whenever an occasion shall be regularly\r\ngiven to maintain everything of substance in that paper, I shall be\r\nready to meet the proudest name for ability, learning, or rank that this\r\nkingdom contains, upon that subject. Do I say this from any confidence\r\nin myself? Far from it. It is from my confidence in our cause, and in\r\nthe ability, the learning, and the constitutional principles which this\r\nHouse contains within itself, and which I hope it will ever\r\ncontain,--and in the assistance which it will not fail to afford to\r\nthose who with good intention do their best to maintain the essential\r\nprivileges of the House, the ancient law of Parliament, and the public\r\njustice of this kingdom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo reply or observation was made on the subject by any other member, nor\r\nwas any farther notice taken of it in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEACHMENT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nWARREN HASTINGS, ESQUIRE,\r\n\r\nLATE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF BENGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN GENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nMAY AND JUNE, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY: WEDNESDAY, MAY 28, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--This business, which has so long employed the public councils\r\nof this kingdom, so long employed the greatest and most august of its\r\ntribunals, now approaches to a close. The wreck and fragments of our\r\ncause (which has been dashed to pieces upon rules by which your\r\nLordships have thought fit to regulate its progress) await your final\r\ndetermination. Enough, however, of the matter is left to call for the\r\nmost exemplary punishment that any tribunal ever inflicted upon any\r\ncriminal. And yet, my Lords, the prisoner, by the plan of his defence,\r\ndemands not only an escape, but a triumph. It is not enough for him to\r\nbe acquitted: the Commons of Great Britain must be condemned; and your\r\nLordships must be the instruments of his glory and of our disgrace. This\r\nis the issue upon which he has put this cause, and the issue upon which\r\nwe are obliged to take it now, and to provide for it hereafter.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I confess that at this critical moment I feel myself oppressed\r\nwith an anxiety that no words can adequately express. The effect of all\r\nour labors, the result of all our inquiries, is now to be ascertained.\r\nYou, my Lords, are now to determine, not only whether all these labors\r\nhave been vain and fruitless, but whether we have abused so long the\r\npublic patience of our country, and so long oppressed merit, instead of\r\navenging crime. I confess I tremble, when I consider that your judgment\r\nis now going to be passed, not on the culprit at your bar, but upon the\r\nHouse of Commons itself, and upon the public justice of this kingdom, as\r\nrepresented in this great tribunal. It is not that culprit who is upon\r\ntrial; it is the House of Commons that is upon its trial, it is the\r\nHouse of Lords that is upon its trial, it is the British nation that is\r\nupon its trial before all other nations, before the present generation,\r\nand before a long, long posterity.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I should be ashamed, if at this moment I attempted to use any\r\nsort of rhetorical blandishments whatever. Such artifices would neither\r\nbe suitable to the body that I represent, to the cause which I sustain,\r\nor to my own individual disposition, upon such an occasion. My Lords, we\r\nknow very well what these fallacious blandishments too frequently are.\r\nWe know that they are used to captivate the benevolence of the court,\r\nand to conciliate the affections of the tribunal rather to the person\r\nthan to the cause. We know that they are used to stifle the\r\nremonstrances of conscience in the judge, and to reconcile it to the\r\nviolation of his duty. We likewise know that they are too often used in\r\ngreat and important causes (and more particularly in causes like this)\r\nto reconcile the prosecutor to the powerful factions of a protected\r\ncriminal, and to the injury of those who have suffered by his\r\ncrimes,--thus inducing all parties to separate in a kind of good humor,\r\nas if they had nothing more than a verbal dispute to settle, or a slight\r\nquarrel over a table to compromise. All this may now be done at the\r\nexpense of the persons whose cause we pretend to espouse. We may all\r\npart, my Lords, with the most perfect complacency and entire good humor\r\ntowards one another, while nations, whole suffering nations, are left to\r\nbeat the empty air with cries of misery and anguish, and to cast forth\r\nto an offended heaven the imprecations of disappointment and despair.\r\n\r\nOne of the counsel for the prisoner (I think it was one who has\r\ncomported himself in this cause with decency) has told your Lordships\r\nthat we have come here on account of _some doubts_ entertained in the\r\nHouse of Commons concerning the conduct of the prisoner at your\r\nbar,--that we shall be extremely delighted, when his defence and your\r\nLordships' judgment shall have set him free, and shall have discovered\r\nto us our error,--that we shall then mutually congratulate one\r\nanother,--and that the Commons, and the Managers who represent them\r\nhere, will be the first to rejoice in so happy an event and so fortunate\r\na discovery.\r\n\r\nFar, far from the Commons of Great Britain be all manner of real vice;\r\nbut ten thousand times further from them, as far as from pole to pole,\r\nbe the whole tribe of false, spurious, affected, counterfeit,\r\nhypocritical virtues! These are the things which are ten times more at\r\nwar with real virtue, these are the things which are ten times more at\r\nwar with real duty, than any vice known by its name and distinguished by\r\nits proper character. My Lords, far from us, I will add, be that false\r\nand affected candor that is eternally in treaty with crime,--that half\r\nvirtue, which, like the ambiguous animal that flies about in the\r\ntwilight of a compromise between day and night, is to a just man's eye\r\nan odious and disgusting thing! There is no middle point in which the\r\nCommons of Great Britain can meet tyranny and oppression. No, we never\r\nshall (nor can we conceive that we ever should) pass from this bar,\r\nwithout indignation, without rage and despair, if the House of Commons\r\nshould, upon such a defence as has here been made against such a charge\r\nas they have produced, be foiled, baffled, and defeated. No, my Lords,\r\nwe never could forget it; a long, lasting, deep, bitter memory of it\r\nwould sink into our minds.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Commons of Great Britain have no doubt upon this subject.\r\nWe came hither to call for justice, not to solve a problem; and if\r\njustice be denied us, the accused is not acquitted, but the tribunal is\r\ncondemned. We know that this man is guilty of all the crimes which he\r\nstands accused of by us. We have not come here to you, in the rash heat\r\nof a day, with that fervor which sometimes prevails in popular\r\nassemblies, and frequently misleads them. No: if we have been guilty of\r\nerror in this cause, it is a deliberate error, the fruit of long,\r\nlaborious inquiry,--an error founded on a procedure in Parliament before\r\nwe came here, the most minute, the most circumstantial, and the most\r\ncautious that ever was instituted. Instead of coming, as we did in Lord\r\nStrafford's case, and in some others, voting the impeachment and\r\nbringing it up on the same day, this impeachment was voted from a\r\ngeneral sense prevailing in the House of Mr. Hastings's criminality\r\nafter an investigation begun in the year 1780, and which produced in\r\n1782 a body of resolutions condemnatory of almost the whole of his\r\nconduct. Those resolutions were formed by the Lord Advocate of\r\nScotland, and carried in our House by the unanimous consent of all\r\nparties: I mean the then Lord Advocate of Scotland,--now one of his\r\nMajesty's principal Secretaries of State, and at the head of this very\r\nIndian department. Afterwards, when this defendant came home, in the\r\nyear 1785, we reïnstituted our inquiry. We instituted it, as your\r\nLordships and the world know, at his own request, made to us by his\r\nagent, then a member of our House. We entered into it at large; we\r\ndeliberately moved for every paper which promised information on the\r\nsubject. These papers were not only produced on the part of the\r\nprosecution, as is the case before grand juries, but the friends of the\r\nprisoner produced every document which they could produce for his\r\njustification. We called all the witnesses which could enlighten us in\r\nthe cause, and the friends of the prisoner likewise called every witness\r\nthat could possibly throw any light in his favor. After all these long\r\ndeliberations, we referred the whole to a committee. When it had gone\r\nthrough that committee, and we thought it in a fit state to be digested\r\ninto these charges, we referred the matter to another committee; and the\r\nresult of that long examination and the labor of these committees is the\r\nimpeachment now at your bar.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we are defeated here, we cannot plead for ourselves that\r\nwe have done this from a sudden gust of passion, which sometimes\r\nagitates and sometimes misleads the most grave popular assemblies. No:\r\nit is either the fair result of twenty-two years' deliberation that we\r\nbring before you, or what the prisoner says is just and true,--that\r\nnothing but malice in the Commons of Great Britain could possibly\r\nproduce such an accusation as the fruit of such an inquiry. My Lords,\r\nwe admit this statement, we are at issue upon this point; and we are now\r\nbefore your Lordships, who are to determine whether this man has abused\r\nhis power in India for fourteen years, or whether the Commons has abused\r\ntheir power of inquiry, made a mock of their inquisitorial authority,\r\nand turned it to purposes of private malice and revenge. We are not come\r\nhere to compromise matters; we do not admit [do admit?] that our fame,\r\nour honors, nay, the very inquisitorial power of the House of Commons is\r\ngone, if this man be not guilty.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, great and powerful as the House of Commons is, (and great and\r\npowerful I hope it always will remain,) yet we cannot be insensible to\r\nthe effects produced by the introduction of forty millions of money into\r\nthis country from India. We know that the private fortunes which have\r\nbeen made there pervade this kingdom so universally that there is not a\r\nsingle parish in it unoccupied by the partisans of the defendant. We\r\nshould fear that the faction which he has thus formed by the oppression\r\nof the people of India would be too strong for the House of Commons\r\nitself, with all its power and reputation, did we not know that we have\r\nbrought before you a cause which nothing can resist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall now, my Lords, proceed to state what has been already done in\r\nthis cause, and in what condition it now stands for your judgment.\r\n\r\nAn immense mass of criminality was digested by a committee of the House\r\nof Commons; but although this mass had been taken from another mass\r\nstill greater, the House found it expedient to select twenty specific\r\ncharges, which they afterwards directed us, their Managers, to bring to\r\nyour Lordships' bar. Whether that which has been brought forward on\r\nthese occasions or that which was left behind be more highly criminal, I\r\nfor one, as a person most concerned in this inquiry, do assure, your\r\nLordships that it is impossible for me to determine.\r\n\r\nAfter we had brought forward this cause, (the greatest in extent that\r\never was tried before any human tribunal, to say nothing of the\r\nmagnitude of its consequences,) we soon found, whatever the reasons\r\nmight be, without at present blaming the prisoner, without blaming your\r\nLordships, and far are we from imputing blame to ourselves, we soon\r\nfound that this trial was likely to be protracted to an unusual length.\r\nThe Managers of the Commons, feeling this, went up to their constituents\r\nto procure from them the means of reducing it within a compass fitter\r\nfor their management and for your Lordships' judgment. Being furnished\r\nwith this power, a second selection was made upon the principles of the\r\nfirst: not upon the idea that what we left could be less clearly\r\nsustained, but because we thought a selection should be made upon some\r\njuridical principle. With this impression on our minds, we reduced the\r\nwhole cause to four great heads of guilt and criminality. Two of them,\r\nnamely, Benares and the Begums, show the effects of his open violence\r\nand injustice; the other two expose the principles of pecuniary\r\ncorruption upon which the prisoner proceeded: one of these displays his\r\npassive corruption in receiving bribes, and the other his active\r\ncorruption, in which he has endeavored to defend his passive corruption\r\nby forming a most formidable faction both abroad and at home. There is\r\nhardly any one act of the prisoner's corruption in which there is not\r\npresumptive violence, nor any acts of his violence in which there are\r\nnot presumptive proofs of corruption. These practices are so intimately\r\nblended with each other, that we thought the distribution which we have\r\nadopted would best bring before you the spirit and genius of his\r\ngovernment; and we were convinced, that, if upon these four great heads\r\nof charge your Lordships should not find him guilty, nothing could be\r\nadded to them which would persuade you so to do.\r\n\r\nIn this way and in this state the matter now comes before your\r\nLordships. I need not tread over the ground which has been trod with\r\nsuch extraordinary abilities by my brother Managers, of whom I shall say\r\nnothing more than that the cause has been supported by abilities equal\r\nto it; and, my Lords, no abilities are beyond it. As to the part which I\r\nhave sustained in this procedure, a sense of my own abilities, weighed\r\nwith the importance of the cause, would have made me desirous of being\r\nleft out of it; but I had a duty to perform which superseded every\r\npersonal consideration, and that duty was obedience to the House of\r\nwhich I have the honor of being a member. This is all the apology I\r\nshall make. We are the Commons of Great Britain, and therefore cannot\r\nmake apologies. I can make none for my obedience; they want none for\r\ntheir commands. They gave me this office, not from any confidence in my\r\nability, but from a confidence in the abilities of those who were to\r\nassist me, and from a confidence in my zeal,--a quality, my Lords, which\r\noftentimes supplies the want of great abilities.\r\n\r\nIn considering what relates to the prisoner and to his defence, I find\r\nthe whole resolves itself into four heads: first, his demeanor, and his\r\ndefence in general; secondly, the principles of his defence; thirdly,\r\nthe means of that defence; and, fourthly, the testimonies which he\r\nbrings forward to fortify those means, to support those principles, and\r\nto justify that demeanor.\r\n\r\nAs to his demeanor, my Lords, I will venture to say, that, if we fully\r\nexamine the conduct of all prisoners brought before this high tribunal,\r\nfrom the time that the Duke of Suffolk appeared before it down to the\r\ntime of the appearance of my Lord Macclesfield, if we fully examine the\r\nconduct of prisoners in every station of life, from my Lord Bacon, down\r\nto the smugglers who were impeached in the reign of King William, I say,\r\nmy Lords, that we shall not, in the whole history of Parliamentary\r\ntrials, find anything similar to the demeanor of the prisoner at your\r\nbar. What could have encouraged that demeanor your Lordships will, when\r\nyou reflect seriously upon this matter, consider. God forbid that the\r\nauthority either of the prosecutor or of the judge should dishearten the\r\nprisoner so as to circumscribe the means or enervate the vigor of his\r\ndefence! God forbid that such a thing should even appear to be desired\r\nby anybody in any British tribunal! But, my Lords, there is a behavior\r\nwhich broadly displays a want of sense, a want of feeling, a want of\r\ndecorum,--a behavior which indicates an habitual depravity of mind, that\r\nhas no sentiments of propriety, no feeling for the relations of life, no\r\nconformity to the circumstances of human affairs. This behavior does not\r\nindicate the spirit of injured innocence, but the audacity of hardened,\r\nhabitual, shameless guilt,--affording legitimate grounds for inferring a\r\nvery defective education, very evil society, or very vicious habits of\r\nlife. There is, my Lords, a nobleness in modesty, while insolence is\r\nalways base and servile. A man who is under the accusation of his\r\ncountry is under a very great misfortune. His innocence, indeed, may at\r\nlength shine out like the sun, yet for a moment it is under a cloud; his\r\nhonor is in abeyance, his estimation is suspended, and he stands, as it\r\nwere, a doubtful person in the eyes of all human society. In that\r\nsituation, not a timid, not an abject, but undoubtedly a modest\r\nbehavior, would become a person even of the most exalted dignity and of\r\nthe firmest fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe Romans (who were a people that understood the decorum of life as\r\nwell as we do) considered a person accused to stand in such a doubtful\r\nsituation that from the moment of accusation he assumed either a\r\nmourning or some squalid garb, although, by the nature of their\r\nconstitution, accusations were brought forward by one of their lowest\r\nmagistrates. The spirit of that decent usage has continued from the time\r\nof the Romans till this very day. No man was ever brought before your\r\nLordships that did not carry the outward as well as inward demeanor of\r\nmodesty, of fear, of apprehension, of a sense of his situation, of a\r\nsense of our accusation, and a sense of your Lordships' dignity.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are but outward things; they are, as Hamlet says,\r\n\"things which a man may play.\" But, my Lords, this prisoner has gone a\r\ngreat deal further than being merely deficient in decent humility.\r\nInstead of defending himself, he has, with a degree of insolence\r\nunparalleled in the history of pride and guilt, cast out a recriminatory\r\naccusation upon the House of Commons. Instead of considering himself as\r\na person already under the condemnation of his country, and uncertain\r\nwhether or not that condemnation shall receive the sanction of your\r\nverdict, he ranks himself with the suffering heroes of antiquity.\r\nJoining with them, he accuses us, the representatives of his country, of\r\nthe blackest ingratitude, of the basest motives, of the most abominable\r\noppression, not only of an innocent, but of a most meritorious\r\nindividual, who, in your and in our service, has sacrificed his health,\r\nhis fortune, and even suffered his fame and character to be called in\r\nquestion from one end of the world to the other. This, I say, he charges\r\nupon the Commons of Great Britain; and he charges it before the Court of\r\nPeers of the same kingdom. Had I not heard this language from the\r\nprisoner, and afterwards from his counsel, I must confess I could hardly\r\nhave believed that any man could so comport himself at your Lordships'\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nAfter stating in his defence the wonderful things he did for us, he\r\nsays,--\"I maintained the wars which were of your formation, or that of\r\nothers, _not of mine_. I won one member of the great Indian confederacy\r\nfrom it by an act of seasonable restitution; with another I maintained a\r\nsecret intercourse, and converted him into a friend; a third I drew off\r\nby diversion and negotiation, and employed him as the instrument of\r\npeace. When _you_ cried out for peace, and your cries were heard by\r\nthose who were the objects of it, I resisted this and every other\r\nspecies of counteraction by rising in my demands, and accomplished a\r\npeace, and I hope an everlasting one, with one great state; and I at\r\nleast afforded the efficient means by which a peace, if not so durable,\r\nmore seasonable at least, was accomplished with another. I gave you\r\n_all_; and you have rewarded me with _confiscation, disgrace, and a life\r\nof impeachment_.\"\r\n\r\nComparing our conduct with that of the people of India, he\r\nsays,--\"_They_ manifested a generosity of which we have no example in\r\nthe European world. Their conduct was the effect of their sense of\r\ngratitude for the benefits they had received from my administration. I\r\nwish I could say as much of my own countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here, then, we have the prisoner at your bar in his demeanor\r\nnot defending himself, but recriminating upon his country, charging it\r\nwith perfidy, ingratitude, and oppression, and making a comparison of it\r\nwith the banians of India, whom he prefers to the Commons of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, what shall we say to this demeanor? With regard to the charge\r\nof using him with ingratitude, there are two points to be considered.\r\nFirst, the charge implies that he had rendered great services; and,\r\nsecondly, that he has been falsely accused.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, as to the great services, they have not, they cannot, come in\r\nevidence before you. If you have received such evidence, you have\r\nreceived it obliquely; for there is no other direct proof before your\r\nLordships of such services than that of there having been great\r\ndistresses and great calamities in India during his government. Upon\r\nthese distresses and calamities he has, indeed, attempted to justify\r\nobliquely the corruption that has been charged upon him; but you have\r\nnot properly in issue these services. You cannot admit the evidence of\r\nany such services received directly from him, as a matter of\r\nrecriminatory charge upon the House of Commons, because you have not\r\nsuffered that House to examine into the validity and merit of this plea.\r\nWe have not been heard upon this recriminatory charge, which makes a\r\nconsiderable part of the demeanor of the prisoner; we cannot be heard\r\nupon it; and therefore I demand, on the part of the Commons of Great\r\nBritain, that it be dismissed from your consideration: and this I\r\ndemand, whether you take it as an attempt to render odious the conduct\r\nof the Commons, whether you take it in mitigation of the punishment due\r\nto the prisoner for his crimes, or whether it be adduced as a\r\npresumption that so virtuous a servant never could be guilty of the\r\noffences with which we charge him. In whichever of these lights you may\r\nbe inclined to consider this matter, I say you have it not in evidence\r\nbefore you; and therefore you must expunge it from your thoughts, and\r\nseparate it entirely from your judgment. I shall hereafter have\r\noccasion, to say a few words on this subject of _merits_. I have said\r\nthus much at present in order to remove extraneous impressions from your\r\nminds. For, admitting that your Lordships are the best judges, as I well\r\nknow that you are, yet I cannot say that you are not men, and that\r\nmatter of this kind, however irrelevant, may not make an impression upon\r\nyou. It does, therefore, become us to take some occasional notice of\r\nthese supposed services, not in the way of argument, but with a view by\r\none sort of prejudice to destroy another prejudice. If there is anything\r\nin evidence which tends to destroy this plea of merits, we shall recur\r\nto that evidence; if there is nothing to destroy it but argument, we\r\nshall have recourse to that argument; and if we support that argument by\r\nauthority and document not in your Lordships' minutes, I hope it will\r\nnot be the less considered as good argument because it is so supported.\r\n\r\nI must now call your Lordships' attention from the vaunted services of\r\nthe prisoner, which have been urged to convict us of ingratitude, to\r\nanother part of his recriminatory defence. He says, my Lords, that we\r\nhave not only oppressed him with unjust charges, (which is a matter for\r\nyour Lordships to judge, and is now the point at issue between us,) but\r\nthat, instead of attacking him by fair judicial modes of proceeding, by\r\nstating crimes clearly and plainly, and by proving those crimes, and\r\nshowing their necessary consequences, we have oppressed him with all\r\nsorts of foul and abusive language,--so much so, that every part of our\r\nproceeding has, in the eye of the world, more the appearance of private\r\nrevenge than of public justice.\r\n\r\nAgainst this impudent and calumnious recriminatory accusation, which\r\nyour Lordships have thought good to suffer him to utter here, at a time,\r\ntoo, when all dignity is in danger of being trodden under foot, we will\r\nsay nothing by way of defence. The Commons of Great Britain, my Lords,\r\nare a rustic people: a tone of rusticity is therefore the proper accent\r\nof their Managers. We are not acquainted with the urbanity and\r\npoliteness of extortion and oppression; nor do we know anything of the\r\nsentimental delicacies of bribery and corruption. We speak the language\r\nof truth, and we speak it in the plain, simple terms in which truth\r\nought to be spoken. Even if we have anything to answer for on this head,\r\nwe can only answer to the body which we represent and to that body which\r\nhears us: to any others we owe no apology whatever.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner at your bar admits that the crimes which we charge him\r\nwith are of that atrocity, that, if brought home to him, he merits\r\ndeath. Yet, when, in pursuance of our duty, we come to state these\r\ncrimes with their proper criminatory epithets, when we state in strong\r\nand direct terms the circumstances which heighten and aggravate them,\r\nwhen we dwell on the immoral and heinous nature of the acts, and the\r\nterrible effects which such acts produce, and when we offer to prove\r\nboth the principal facts and the aggravatory ones by evidence, and to\r\nshow their nature and quality by the rules of law, morality, and policy,\r\nthen this criminal, then his counsel, then his accomplices and\r\nhirelings, posted in newspapers and dispersed in circles through every\r\npart of the kingdom, represent him as an object of great compassion,\r\nbecause he is treated, say they, with, nothing but opprobrious names and\r\nscurrilous invectives.\r\n\r\nTo all this the Managers of the Commons will say nothing by way of\r\ndefence: it would be to betray their trust, if they did. No, my Lords,\r\nthey have another and a very different duty to perform on this occasion.\r\nThey are bound not to suffer public opinion, which often prevents\r\njudgment and often defeats its effects, to be debauched and corrupted.\r\nMuch less is this to be suffered in the presence of our coördinate\r\nbranch of legislature, and as it were with your and our own tacit\r\nacquiescence. Whenever the public mind is misled, it becomes the duty of\r\nthe Commons of Great Britain to give it a more proper tone and a juster\r\nway of thinking. When ignorance and corruption have usurped the\r\nprofessor's chair, and placed themselves in the seats of science and of\r\nvirtue, it is high time for us to speak out. We know that the doctrines\r\nof folly are of great use to the professors of vice. We know that it is\r\none of the signs of a corrupt and degenerate age, and one of the means\r\nof insuring its further corruption and degeneracy, to give mild and\r\nlenient epithets to vices and to crimes. The world is much influenced by\r\nnames. And as terms are the representatives of sentiments, when persons\r\nwho exercise any censorial magistracy seem in their language to\r\ncompromise with crimes and criminals by expressing no horror of the one\r\nor detestation of the other, the world will naturally think that they\r\nact merely to acquit themselves in its sight in form, but in reality to\r\nevade their duty. Yes, my Lords, the world must think that such persons\r\npalter with their sacred trust, and are tender to crimes because they\r\nlook forward to the future possession of the same power which they now\r\nprosecute, and purpose to abuse it in the manner it has been abused by\r\nthe criminal of whom they are so tender.\r\n\r\nTo remove such an imputation from us, we assert that the Commons of\r\nGreat Britain are not to receive instructions about the language which\r\nthey ought to hold from the gentlemen who have made profitable studies\r\nin the academies of Benares and of Oude. We know, and therefore do not\r\nwant to learn, how to comport ourselves in prosecuting the haughty and\r\novergrown delinquents of the East. We cannot require to be instructed by\r\nthem in what words we shall express just indignation at enormous crimes;\r\nfor we have the example of our great ancestors to teach us: we tread in\r\ntheir steps, and we speak in their language.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships well know, for you must be conversant in this kind of\r\nreading, that you once had before you a man of the highest rank in this\r\ncountry, one of the greatest men of the law and one of the greatest men\r\nof the state, a peer of your own body, Lord Macclesfield. Yet, my Lords,\r\nwhen that peer did but just modestly hint that he had received hard\r\nmeasure from the Commons and their Managers, those Managers thought\r\nthemselves bound _seriatim_, one after another, to express the utmost\r\nindignation at the charge, in the harshest language that could be used.\r\nWhy did they do so? They knew it was the language that became them. They\r\nlived in an age in which politeness was as well understood and as much\r\ncultivated as it is at present; but they knew what they were doing, and\r\nthey were resolved to use no language but what their ancestors had used,\r\nand to suffer no insolence which their ancestors would not have\r\nsuffered. We tread in their steps; we pursue their method; we learn of\r\nthem: and we shall never learn at any other school.\r\n\r\nWe know from history and the records of this House, that a Lord Bacon\r\nhas been before you. Who is there, that, upon hearing this name, does\r\nnot instantly recognize everything of genius the most profound,\r\neverything of literature the most extensive, everything of discovery the\r\nmost penetrating, everything of observation on human life the most\r\ndistinguishing and refined? All these must be instantly recognized, for\r\nthey are all inseparably associated with the name of Lord Verulam. Yet,\r\nwhen this prodigy was brought before your Lordships by the Commons of\r\nGreat Britain for having permitted his menial servant to receive\r\npresents, what was his demeanor? Did he require his counsel not \"to let\r\ndown the dignity of his defence\"? No. That Lord Bacon, whose least\r\ndistinction was, that he was a peer of England, a Lord High Chancellor,\r\nand the son of a Lord Keeper, behaved like a man who knew himself, like\r\na man who was conscious of merits of the highest kind, but who was at\r\nthe same time conscious of having fallen into guilt. The House of\r\nCommons did not spare him. They brought him to your bar. They found\r\nspots in that sun. And what, I again ask, was his behavior? That of\r\ncontrition, that of humility, that of repentance, that which belongs to\r\nthe greatest men lapsed and fallen through human infirmity into error.\r\nHe did not hurl defiance at the accusations of his country; he bowed\r\nhimself before it. Yet, with all his penitence, he could not escape the\r\npursuit of the House of Commons, and the inflexible justice of this\r\nCourt. Your Lordships fined him forty thousand pounds, notwithstanding\r\nall his merits, notwithstanding his humility, notwithstanding his\r\ncontrition, notwithstanding the decorum of his behavior, so well suited\r\nto a man under the prosecution of the Commons of England before the\r\nPeers of England. You fined him in a sum fully equal to one hundred\r\nthousand pounds of the present day; you imprisoned him during the King's\r\npleasure; and you disqualified him forever from having a seat in this\r\nHouse and any office in this kingdom. This is the way in which the\r\nCommons behaved formerly, and in which your Lordships acted formerly,\r\nwhen no culprit at this bar dared to hurl a recriminatory accusation\r\nagainst his prosecutors, or dared to censure the language in which they\r\nexpressed their indignation at his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe Commons of Great Britain, following these examples and fortified by\r\nthem, abhor all compromise with guilt either in act or in language.\r\nThey will not disclaim any one word that they have spoken, because, my\r\nLords, they have said nothing abusive or illiberal. It has been, said\r\nthat we have used such language as was used to Sir Walter Raleigh, when\r\nhe was called, not by the Commons, but by a certain person of a learned\r\nprofession, \"a spider of hell.\" My Lords, Sir Walter was a great\r\nsoldier, a great mariner, and one of the first scholars of his age. To\r\ncall him a spider of hell was not only indecent in itself, but perfectly\r\nfoolish, from the term being totally inapplicable to the object, and fit\r\nonly for the very pedantic eloquence of the person who used it. But if\r\nSir Walter Raleigh had been guilty of numberless frauds and\r\nprevarications, if he had clandestinely picked up other men's money,\r\nconcealed his peculation by false bonds, and afterwards attempted to\r\ncover it by the cobwebs of the law, then my Lord Coke would have\r\ntrespassed a great deal more against decorum than against propriety of\r\nsimilitude and metaphor.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Managers for the Commons have not used any _inapplicable_\r\nlanguage. We have indeed used, and will again use, such expressions as\r\nare proper to portray guilt. After describing the magnitude of the\r\ncrime, we describe the magnitude of the criminal. We have declared him\r\nto be not only a public robber himself, but the head of a system of\r\nrobbery, the captain-general of the gang, the chief under whom a whole\r\npredatory band was arrayed, disciplined, and paid. This, my Lords, is\r\nwhat we offered to prove fully to you, what in part we have proved, and\r\nthe whole of which I believe we could prove. In developing such a mass\r\nof criminality and in describing a criminal of such magnitude as we\r\nhave now brought before you, we could not use lenient epithets without\r\ncompromising with crime. We therefore shall not relax in our pursuits\r\nnor in our language. No, my Lords, no! we shall not fail to feel\r\nindignation, wherever our moral nature has taught us to feel it; nor\r\nshall we hesitate to speak the language which is dictated by that\r\nindignation. Whenever men are oppressed where they ought to be\r\nprotected, we called [call?] it tyranny, and we call the actor a tyrant.\r\nWhenever goods are taken by violence from the possessor, we call it a\r\nrobbery, and the person who takes it we call a robber. Money\r\nclandestinely taken from the proprietor we call theft, and the person\r\nwho takes it we call a thief. When a false paper is made out to obtain\r\nmoney, we call the act a forgery. That steward who takes bribes from his\r\nmaster's tenants, and then, pretending the money to be his own, lends it\r\nto that master and takes bonds for it to himself, we consider guilty of\r\na breach of trust; and the person who commits such crimes we call a\r\ncheat, a swindler, and a forger of bonds. All these offences, without\r\nthe least softening, under all these names, we charge upon this man. We\r\nhave so charged in our record, we have so charged in our speeches; and\r\nwe are sorry that our language does not furnish terms of sufficient\r\nforce and compass to mark the multitude, the magnitude, and the atrocity\r\nof his crimes.\r\n\r\nHow came it, then, that the Commons of Great Britain should be\r\ncalumniated for the course which they have taken? Why should it ever\r\nhave been supposed that we are actuated by revenge? I answer, There are\r\ntwo very sufficient causes: corruption and ignorance. The first disposes\r\nan innumerable multitude of people to a fellow-feeling with the\r\nprisoner. Under the shadow of his crimes thousands of fortunes have been\r\nmade; and therefore thousands of tongues are employed to justify the\r\nmeans by which these fortunes were made. When they cannot deny the\r\nfacts, they attack the accusers,--they attack their conduct, they attack\r\ntheir persons, they attack their language, in every possible manner. I\r\nhave said, my Lords, that ignorance is the other cause of this calumny\r\nby which the House of Commons is assailed. Ignorance produces a\r\nconfusion of ideas concerning the decorum of life, by confounding the\r\nrules of private society with those of public function. To talk, as we\r\nhere talk, to persons in a mixed company of men and women, would violate\r\nthe law of such societies; because they meet for the sole purpose of\r\nsocial intercourse, and not for the exposure, the censure, the\r\npunishment of crimes: to all which things private societies are\r\naltogether incompetent. In them crimes can never be regularly stated,\r\nproved, or refuted. The law has therefore appointed special places for\r\nsuch inquiries; and if in any of those places we were to apply the\r\nemollient language of drawing-rooms to the exposure of great crimes, it\r\nwould be as false and vicious in taste and in morals as to use the\r\ncriminatory language of this hall in drawing and assembling rooms would\r\nbe misplaced and ridiculous. Every one knows that in common society\r\npalliating names are given to vices. Adultery in a lady is called\r\ngallantry; the gentleman is commonly called a man of good fortune,\r\nsometimes in French and sometimes in English. But is this the tone which\r\nwould become a person in a court of justice, calling these people to an\r\naccount for that horrible crime which destroys the basis of society?\r\nNo, my Lords, this is not the tone of such proceedings. Your Lordships\r\nknow that it is not; the Commons know that it is not; and because we\r\nhave acted on that knowledge, and stigmatized crimes with becoming\r\nindignation, we are said to be actuated rather by revenge than justice.\r\n\r\nIf it should still be asked why we show sufficient acrimony to excite a\r\nsuspicion of being in any manner influenced by malice or a desire of\r\nrevenge, to this, my Lords, I answer, Because we would be thought to\r\nknow our duty, and to have all the world know how resolutely we are\r\nresolved to perform it. The Commons of Great Britain are not disposed to\r\nquarrel with the Divine Wisdom and Goodness, which has moulded up\r\nrevenge into the frame and constitution of man. He that has made us what\r\nwe are has made us at once resentful and reasonable. Instinct tells a\r\nman that he ought to revenge an injury; reason tells him that he ought\r\nnot to be a judge in his own cause. From that moment revenge passes from\r\nthe private to the public hand; but in being transferred it is far from\r\nbeing extinguished. My Lords, it is transferred as a sacred trust to be\r\nexercised for the injured, in measure and proportion, by persons who,\r\nfeeling as he feels, are in a temper to reason better than he can\r\nreason. Revenge is taken out of the hands of the original injured\r\nproprietor, lest it should be carried beyond the bounds of moderation\r\nand justice. But, my Lords, it is in its transfer exposed to a danger of\r\nan opposite description. The delegate of vengeance may not feel the\r\nwrong sufficiently: he may be cold and languid in the performance of his\r\nsacred duty. It is for these reasons that good men are taught to\r\ntremble even at the first emotions of anger and resentment for their own\r\nparticular wrongs; but they are likewise taught, if they are well\r\ntaught, to give the loosest possible rein to their resentment and\r\nindignation, whenever their parents, their friends, their country, or\r\ntheir brethren of the common family of mankind are injured. Those who\r\nhave not such feelings, under such circumstances, are base and\r\ndegenerate. These, my Lords, are the sentiments of the Commons of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon has very well said, that \"revenge is a kind of wild justice.\"\r\nIt is so, and without this wild austere stock there would be no justice\r\nin the world. But when, by the skilful hand of morality and wise\r\njurisprudence, a foreign scion, but of the very same species, is grafted\r\nupon it, its harsh quality becomes changed, it submits to culture, and,\r\nlaying aside its savage nature, it bears fruits and flowers, sweet to\r\nthe world, and not ungrateful even to heaven itself, to which it\r\nelevates its exalted head. The fruit of this wild stock is revenge\r\nregulated, but not extinguished,--revenge transferred from the suffering\r\nparty to the communion and sympathy of mankind. This is the revenge by\r\nwhich we are actuated, and which we should be sorry, if the false, idle,\r\ngirlish, novel-like morality of the world should extinguish in the\r\nbreast of us who have a great public duty to perform.\r\n\r\nThis sympathetic revenge, which is condemned by clamorous imbecility, is\r\nso far from being a vice, that it is the greatest of all possible\r\nvirtues,--a virtue which the uncorrupted judgment of mankind has in all\r\nages exalted to the rank of heroism. To give up all the repose and\r\npleasures of life, to pass sleepless nights and laborious days, and,\r\nwhat is ten times more irksome to an ingenuous mind, to offer oneself to\r\ncalumny and all its herd of hissing tongues and poisoned fangs, in order\r\nto free the world from fraudulent prevaricators, from cruel oppressors,\r\nfrom robbers and tyrants, has, I say, the test of heroic virtue, and\r\nwell deserves such a distinction. The Commons, despairing to attain the\r\nheights of this virtue, never lose sight of it for a moment. For\r\nseventeen years they have, almost without intermission, pursued, by\r\nevery sort of inquiry, by legislative and by judicial remedy, the cure\r\nof this Indian malady, worse ten thousand times than the leprosy which\r\nour forefathers brought from the East. Could they have done this, if\r\nthey had not been actuated by some strong, some vehement, some perennial\r\npassion, which, burning like the Vestal fire, chaste and eternal, never\r\nsuffers generous sympathy to grow cold in maintaining the rights of the\r\ninjured or in denouncing the crimes of the oppressor?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Managers for the Commons have been actuated by this\r\npassion; my Lords, they feel its influence at this moment; and so far\r\nfrom softening either their measures or their tone, they do here, in the\r\npresence of their Creator, of this House, and of the world, make this\r\nsolemn declaration, and nuncupate this deliberate vow: that they will\r\never glow with the most determined and unextinguishable animosity\r\nagainst tyranny, oppression, and peculation in all, but more\r\nparticularly as practised by this man in India; that they never will\r\nrelent, but will pursue and prosecute him and it, till they see corrupt\r\npride prostrate under the feet of justice. We call upon your Lordships\r\nto join us; and we have no doubt that you will feel the same sympathy\r\nthat we feel, or (what I cannot persuade my soul to think or my mouth to\r\nutter) you will be identified with the criminal whose crimes you excuse,\r\nand rolled with him in all the pollution of Indian guilt, from\r\ngeneration to generation. Let those who feel with me upon this occasion\r\njoin with me in this vow: if they will not, I have it all to myself.\r\n\r\nIt is not to defend ourselves that I have addressed your Lordships at\r\nsuch length on this subject. No, my Lords, I have said what I considered\r\nnecessary to instruct the public upon the principles which induced the\r\nHouse of Commons to persevere in this business with a generous warmth,\r\nand in the indignant language which Nature prompts, when great crimes\r\nare brought before men who feel as they ought to feel upon such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now proceed, my Lords, to the next recriminatory charge, which is\r\n_delay_. I confess I am not astonished at this charge. From the first\r\nrecords of human impatience down to the present time, it has been\r\ncomplained that the march of violence and oppression is rapid, but that\r\nthe progress of remedial and vindictive justice, even the divine, has\r\nalmost always favored the appearance of being languid and sluggish.\r\nSomething of this is owing to the very nature and constitution of human\r\naffairs; because, as justice is a circumspect, cautious, scrutinizing,\r\nbalancing principle, full of doubt even of itself, and fearful of doing\r\nwrong even to the greatest wrong-doers, in the nature of things its\r\nmovements must be slow in comparison with the headlong rapidity with\r\nwhich avarice, ambition, and revenge pounce down upon the devoted prey\r\nof those violent and destructive passions. And indeed, my Lords, the\r\ndisproportion between crime and justice, when seen in the particular\r\nacts of either, would be so much to the advantage of crimes and\r\ncriminals, that we should find it difficult to defend laws and\r\ntribunals, (especially in great and arduous cases like this,) if we did\r\nnot look, not to the _immediate_, not to the _retrospective_, but to the\r\n_provident_ operation of justice. Its chief operation is in its future\r\nexample; and this turns the balance, upon the total effect, in favor of\r\nvindictive justice, and in some measure reconciles a pious and humble\r\nmind to this great mysterious dispensation of the world.\r\n\r\nUpon the charge of delay in this particular cause, my Lords, I have only\r\nto say that the business before you is of immense magnitude. The\r\nprisoner himself says that all the acts of his life are committed in it.\r\nWith a due sense of this magnitude, we know that the investigation could\r\nnot be short to us, nor short to your Lordships; but when we are called\r\nupon, as we have been daily, to sympathize with the prisoner in that\r\ndelay, my Lords, we must tell you that we have no sympathy with him.\r\nRejecting, as we have done, all false, spurious, and hypocritical\r\nvirtues, we should hold it to be the greatest of all crimes to bestow\r\nupon the oppressors that pity which belongs to the oppressed. The\r\nunhappy persons who are wronged, robbed, and despoiled have no remedy\r\nbut in the sympathies of mankind; and when these sympathies are suffered\r\nto be debauched, when they are perversely carried from the victim to the\r\noppressor, then we commit a robbery still greater than that which was\r\ncommitted by the criminal accused.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we do think this process long; we lament it in every sense in\r\nwhich it ought to be lamented; but we lament still more that the Begums\r\nhave been so long without having a just punishment inflicted upon their\r\nspoiler. We lament that Cheyt Sing has so long been a wanderer, while\r\nthe man who drove him from his dominions is still unpunished. We are\r\nsorry that Nobkissin has been cheated of his money for fourteen years,\r\nwithout obtaining redress. These are our sympathies, my Lords; and thus\r\nwe reply to this part of the charge.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there are some matters of fact in this charge of delay which I\r\nmust beg your Lordships will look into. On the 19th of February, 1789,\r\nthe prisoner presented a petition to your Lordships, in which he states,\r\nafter many other complaints, that a great number of his witnesses were\r\nobliged to go to India, by which he has lost the benefit of their\r\ntestimony, and that a great number of your Lordships' body were dead, by\r\nwhich he has lost the benefit of their judgment. As to the hand of God,\r\nthough some members of your House may have departed this life since the\r\ncommencement of this trial, yet the body always remains entire. The\r\nevidence before you is the same; and therefore there is no reason to\r\npresume that your final judgment will be affected by these afflicting\r\ndispensations of Providence. With regard to his witnesses, I must beg to\r\nremind your Lordships of one extraordinary fact. This prisoner has sent\r\nto India, and obtained, not testimonies, but testimonials to his general\r\ngood behavior. He has never once applied, by commission or otherwise, to\r\nfalsify any one fact that is charged upon, him,--no, my Lords, not one.\r\nTherefore that part of his petition which states the injury he has\r\nreceived from the Commons of Great Britain is totally false and\r\ngroundless. For if he had any witnesses to examine, he would not have\r\nfailed to examine them; if he had asked for a commission to receive\r\ntheir depositions, a commission would have been granted; if, without a\r\ncommission, he had brought affidavits to facts, or regular recorded\r\ntestimony, the Commons of Great Britain would never have rejected such\r\nevidence, even though they could not have cross-examined it.\r\n\r\nAnother complaint is, that many of his witnesses were obliged to leave\r\nEngland before he could make use of their evidence. My Lords, no delay\r\nin the trial has prevented him from producing any evidence; for we were\r\nwilling that any of his witnesses should be examined at any time most\r\nconvenient to himself. If many persons connected with his measures are\r\ngone to India, during the course of his trial, many others have returned\r\nto England. Mr. Larkins returned. Was the prisoner willing to examine\r\nhim? No: and it was nothing but downright shame, and the presumptions\r\nwhich he knew would be drawn against him, if he did not call this\r\nwitness, which finally induced him to make use of his evidence. We\r\nexamined Mr. Larkins, my Lords; we examined all the prisoner's\r\nwitnesses; your Lordships have their testimony; and down to this very\r\nhour he has not put his hand upon any one whom he thought a proper and\r\nessential witness to the facts, or to any part of the cause, whose\r\nexamination has been denied him; nor has he even stated that any man, if\r\nbrought here, would prove such and such points. No, not one word to this\r\neffect has ever been stated by the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThere is, my Lords, another case, which was noticed by my honorable\r\nfellow Manager yesterday. Mr. Belli, the confidential secretary of the\r\nprisoner, was agent and contractor for stores; and this raised a\r\nsuspicion that the contracts were held by him for the prisoner's\r\nadvantage. Mr. Belli was here during the whole time of the trial, and\r\nsix weeks after we had closed our evidence. We had then no longer the\r\narrangement of the order of witnesses, and he might have called whom he\r\npleased. With the full knowledge of these circumstances, that witness\r\ndid he suffer to depart for India, if he did not even encourage his\r\ndeparture. This, my Lords, is the kind of damage which he has suffered\r\nby the want of witnesses, through the protraction of this trial.\r\n\r\nBut the great and serious evil which he complains of, as being\r\noccasioned by our delay, is of so extraordinary a nature that I must\r\nrequest your Lordships to examine it with extraordinary strictness and\r\nattention. In the petition before your Lordships, the prisoner asserts\r\nthat he was under the necessity, through his counsel and solicitors, \"of\r\ncollecting and collating from the voluminous records of the Company the\r\nwhole history of his public life, in order to form a complete defence to\r\nevery allegation which the Honorable House of Commons had preferred\r\nagainst him, and that he has expended upwards of thirty thousand pounds\r\nin preparing the materials of his defence.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, my Lords, that the expenditure of this thirty thousand\r\npounds is not properly connected with the delay of which he complains;\r\nfor he states that he had incurred this loss merely in collecting and\r\ncollating materials, previous to his defence before your Lordships. If\r\nthis were true, and your Lordships were to admit the amount as a rule\r\nand estimate by which the aggregate of his loss could be ascertained,\r\nthe application of the rule of three to the sum and time given would\r\nbring out an enormous expenditure in the long period which has elapsed\r\nsince the commencement of the trial,--so enormous, that, if this\r\nmonstrous load of oppression has been laid upon him by the delay of the\r\nCommons, I believe no man living can stand up in our justification. But,\r\nmy Lords, I am to tell your Lordships some facts, into which we trust\r\n_you_, will inquire: for this business is not in our hands, nor can we\r\nlay it as a charge before you. Your own Journals have recorded the\r\ndocument, in which the prisoner complains bitterly of the House of\r\nCommons, and indeed of the whole judicature of the country,--a complaint\r\nwhich your Lordships will do well to examine.\r\n\r\nWhen we first came to a knowledge of this petition, which was not till\r\nsome time after it was presented, I happened to have conversation with a\r\nnoble lord,--I know not whether he be in his place in the House or not,\r\nbut I think I am not irregular in mentioning his name. When I mention\r\nLord Suffolk, I name a peer whom honor, justice, veracity, and every\r\nvirtue that distinguishes the man and the peer would claim for their\r\nown. My Lord Suffolk told me, that, in a conversation with the late Lord\r\nDover, who brought the prisoner's petition into your House, he could not\r\nrefrain from expressing his astonishment at that part of the petition\r\nwhich related to the expense Mr. Hastings had been at; and particularly\r\nas a complaint had been made in the House of the enormous expense of the\r\nprosecution, which at that time had only amounted to fourteen thousand\r\npounds, although the expense of the prosecutor is generally greater than\r\nthat of the defendant, and public proceedings more expensive than\r\nprivate ones. Lord Dover said, that, before he presented the petition,\r\nhe had felt exactly in the same manner; but that Mr. Hastings assured\r\nhim that six thousand pounds had been paid to copying clerks in the\r\nIndia House, and that from this circumstance he might judge of the other\r\nexpenses. Lord Dover was satisfied with this assurance, and presented\r\nthe petition, which otherwise he should have declined to do, on account\r\nof the apparent enormity of the allegation it contained. At the time\r\nwhen Lord Suffolk informed me of these particulars, (with a good deal of\r\nsurprise and astonishment,) I had not leisure to go down to the India\r\nHouse in order to make inquiries concerning them, but I afterwards asked\r\nthe Secretary, Mr. Hudson, to whom _we_ had given a handsome reward,\r\nwhat sums he had received from Mr. Hastings for his services upon this\r\noccasion, and the answer was, \"Not one shilling.\" Not one shilling had\r\nMr. Hudson received from Mr. Hastings. The clerks of the Company\r\ninformed us that the Court of Directors had ordered that every paper\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings wanted should be copied for him gratuitously,--and\r\nthat, if any additional clerks were wanting for the effectual execution\r\nof his wishes, the expense would be defrayed by the Directors. Hearing\r\nthis account, I next inquired what _expedition money_ might have been\r\ngiven to the clerks: for we know something of this kind is usually done.\r\nIn reply to this question, Mr. Hudson told me that at various times they\r\nhad received in little driblets to the amount of ninety-five pounds, or\r\nthereabouts. In this way the account stood when I made this inquiry,\r\nwhich was at least half a year after the petition had been presented to\r\nyour Lordships. Thus the whole story of the six thousand pounds was\r\nabsolutely false. At that time there was not one word of truth in it,\r\nwhatever be the amount of the sums which he has paid since. Your\r\nLordships will now judge whether you have been abused by false\r\nallegations or not,--allegations which could scarcely admit of being\r\ntrue, and which upon the best inquiry I found absolutely false; and I\r\nappeal to the testimony of the noble lord, who is now living, for the\r\ntruth of the account he received from the worthy and respectable peer\r\nwhose loss the nation has to bewail.\r\n\r\nThere are many other circumstances of fraud and falsehood attending this\r\npetition, (we must call things by their proper names, my Lords,)--there\r\nare, I say, many circumstances of fraud and falsehood. We know it to\r\nhave been impossible, at the time of presenting this petition, that this\r\nman should have expended thirty thousand pounds in the preparation of\r\nmaterials for his defence; and your Lordships' justice, together with\r\nthe credit of the House of Commons, are concerned in the discovery of\r\nthe truth. There is, indeed, an ambiguous word in the petition. He\r\nasserts that he is _engaged_ for the payment of that sum. We asked the\r\nclerks of the India House whether he had given them any bond, note,\r\nsecurity, or promise of payment: they assured us that he had not: they\r\nwill be ready to make the same assurance to your Lordships, when you\r\ncome to inquire into this matter, which before you give judgment we\r\ndesire and claim that you will do. All is concealment and mystery on the\r\nside of the prisoner; all is open and direct with us. We are desirous\r\nthat everything which is concealed may be brought to light.\r\n\r\nIn contradiction, then, to this charge of oppression and of an attempt\r\nto ruin his fortune, your Lordships will see that at the time when he\r\nmade this charge he had not been, in fact, nor was for a long time\r\nafter, one shilling out of pocket. But some other person had become\r\nsecurity to his attorney for him. What, then, are we to think of these\r\nmen of business, of these friends of Mr. Hastings, who, when he is\r\npossessed of nothing, are contented to become responsible for thirty\r\nthousand pounds, (was it thirty thousand pounds out of the bullock\r\ncontracts?)--responsible, I say, for this sum, in order to maintain this\r\nsuit previous to its actual commencement, and who consequently must be\r\nso engaged for every article of expense that has followed from that time\r\nto this?\r\n\r\nThus much we have thought it necessary to say upon this part of the\r\nrecriminatory charge of delay. With respect to the delay in general, we\r\nare at present under an account to our constituents upon that subject.\r\nTo them we shall give it. We shall not give any further account of it to\r\nyour Lordships. The means belong to us as well as to you of removing\r\nthese charges. Your Lordships may inquire upon oath, as we have done in\r\nour committee, into all the circumstances of these allegations. I hope\r\nyour Lordships will do so, and will give the Commons an opportunity of\r\nattending and assisting at this most momentous and important inquiry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next recriminatory charge made upon us by the prisoner is, that,\r\nmerely to throw an odium upon him, we have brought forward a great deal\r\nof irrelevant matter, which could not be proved regularly in the course\r\nof examination at your bar, and particularly in the opening speech,\r\nwhich I had the honor of making on the subject.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships know very well that we stated in our charge that great\r\nabuses had prevailed in India, that the Company had entered into\r\ncovenants with their servants respecting those abuses, that an act of\r\nParliament was made to prevent their recurrence, and that Mr. Hastings\r\nstill continued in their practice. Now, my Lords, having stated this,\r\nnothing could be more regular, more proper, and more pertinent, than for\r\nus to justify both the covenants required by the Company and the act\r\nmade to prevent the abuses which existed in India. We therefore went\r\nthrough those abuses; we stated them, and were ready to prove every\r\nmaterial word and article in them. Whether they were personally relevant\r\nor irrelevant to the prisoner we cared nothing. We were to make out from\r\nthe records of the House (which records I can produce, whenever I am\r\ncalled upon for them) all these articles of abuse and grievance; and we\r\nhave stated these abuses as the grounds of the Company's provisional\r\ncovenants with its servants, and of the act of Parliament. We have\r\nstated them under two heads, violence and corruption: for these crimes\r\nwill be found, my Lords, in almost every transaction with the native\r\npowers; and the prisoner is directly or indirectly involved in every\r\npart of them. If it be still objected, that these crimes are irrelevant\r\nto the charge, we answer, that we did not introduce them as matter of\r\ncharge. We say they were not irrelevant to the proof of the preamble of\r\nour charge, which preamble is perfectly relevant in all its parts. That\r\nthe matters stated in it are perfectly true we vouch the House of\r\nCommons, we vouch the very persons themselves who were concerned in the\r\ntransactions. When Arabic authors are quoted, and Oriental tales told\r\nabout _flashes of lightning_ and _three seals_, we quote the very\r\nparties themselves giving this account of their own conduct to a\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remember that a most reverend prelate, who cannot be\r\nnamed without every mark of respect and attention, conveyed a petition\r\nto your Lordships from a gentleman concerned in one of those narratives.\r\nUpon your Lordships' table that petition still lies. For the production\r\nof this narrative we are not answerable to this House; your Lordships\r\ncould not make us answerable to him; but we are answerable to our own\r\nHouse, we are answerable to our own honor, we are answerable to all the\r\nCommons of Great Britain for whatever we have asserted in their name.\r\nAccordingly, General Burgoyne, then a member of this Committee of\r\nManagers, and myself, went down into the House of Commons; we there\r\nrestated the whole affair; we desired that an inquiry should be made\r\ninto it, at the request of the parties concerned. But, my Lords, they\r\nhave never asked for inquiry from that day to this. Whenever he or they\r\nwho are criminated (not by us, but in this volume of Reports that is in\r\nmy hand) desire it, the House will give them all possible satisfaction\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nA similar complaint was made to the House of Commons by the prisoner,\r\nthat matters irrelevant to the charge were brought up hither. Was it not\r\nopen to him, and has he had no friends in the House of Commons, to call\r\nupon the House, during the whole period of this proceeding, to examine\r\ninto the particulars adduced in justification of the preamble of the\r\ncharge against him, in justification of the covenants of the Company, in\r\njustification of the act of Parliament? It was in his power to do it; it\r\nis in his power still; and if it be brought before that tribunal, to\r\nwhich I and my fellow Managers are alone accountable, we will lay before\r\nthat tribunal such matters as will sufficiently justify our mode of\r\nproceeding, and the resolution of the House of Commons. I will not,\r\ntherefore, enter into the particulars (because they cannot be entered\r\ninto by your Lordships) any further than to say, that, if we had ever\r\nbeen called upon to prove the allegations which we have made, not in the\r\nnature of a charge, but as bound in duty to this Court, and in justice\r\nto ourselves, we should have been ready to enter into proof. We offered\r\nto do so, and we now repeat the offer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was another complaint in the prisoner's petition, which did not\r\napply to the words of the preamble, but to an allegation in the charge\r\nconcerning abuses in the revenue, and the ill consequences which arose\r\nfrom them. I allude to those shocking transactions, which nobody can\r\nmention without horror, in Rampore and Dinagepore, during the government\r\nof Mr. Hastings, and which we attempted to bring home to him. What did\r\nhe do in this case? Did he endeavor to meet these charges fairly, as he\r\nmight have done? No, my Lords: what he said merely amounted to\r\nthis:--\"Examination into these charges would vindicate my reputation\r\nbefore the world; but I, who am the guardian of my own honor and my own\r\ninterests, choose to avail myself of the rules and orders of this\r\nHouse, and I will not suffer you to enter upon that examination.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we admit, you are the interpreters of your own rules and\r\norders. We likewise admit that our own honor may be affected by the\r\ncharacter of the evidence which we produce to you. But, my Lords, they\r\nwho withhold their defence, who suffer themselves, as they say, to be\r\ncruelly criminated by unjust accusation, and yet will not permit the\r\nevidence of their guilt or innocence to be produced, are themselves the\r\ncauses of the irrelevancy of all these matters. It cannot justly be\r\ncharged on us; for we have never offered any matter here which we did\r\nnot declare our readiness upon the spot to prove. Your Lordships did not\r\nthink fit to receive that proof. We do not now censure your Lordships\r\nfor your determination: that is not the business of this day. We refer\r\nto your determination for the purpose of showing the falsehood of the\r\nimputation which the prisoner has cast upon us, of having oppressed him\r\nby delay and irrelevant matter. We refer to it in order to show that the\r\noppression rests with himself, that it is all his own.\r\n\r\nWell, but Mr. Hastings complained also to the House of Commons. Has he\r\npursued the complaint? No, he has not; and yet this prisoner, and these\r\ngentlemen, his learned counsel, have dared to reiterate their complaints\r\nof us at your Lordships' bar, while we have always been, and still are,\r\nready to prove both the atrocious nature of the facts, and that they are\r\n_referable_ to the prisoner at your bar. To this, as I have said before,\r\nthe prisoner has objected; this we are not permitted to do by your\r\nLordships: and therefore, without presuming to blame your\r\ndetermination, I repeat, that we throw the blame directly upon himself,\r\nwhen he complains that his private character suffers without the means\r\nof defence, since he objects to the use of means of defence which are at\r\nhis disposal.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this part of the prisoner's recriminatory charge, I\r\nshall close my observations on his demeanor, and defer my remarks on his\r\ncomplaint of our ingratitude until we come to consider his set-off of\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next subject for your Lordships' consideration is the principle of\r\nthe prisoner's defence. And here we must observe, that, either by\r\nconfession or conviction, we are possessed of the facts, and perfectly\r\nagreed upon the matter at issue between us. In taking a view of the laws\r\nby which you are to judge, I shall beg leave to state to you upon what\r\nprinciples of law the House of Commons has criminated him, and upon what\r\nprinciples of law, or pretended law, he justifies himself: for these are\r\nthe matters at issue between us; the matters of fact, as I have just\r\nsaid, being determined either by confession on his part or by proof on\r\nours.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we acknowledge that Mr. Hastings was invested with\r\ndiscretionary power; but we assert that he was bound to use that power\r\naccording to the established rules of political morality, humanity, and\r\nequity. In all questions relating to foreign powers he was bound to act\r\nunder the Law of Nature and under the Law of Nations, as it is\r\nrecognized by the wisest authorities in public jurisprudence; in his\r\nrelation to this country he was bound to act according to the laws and\r\nstatutes of Great Britain, either in their letter or in their spirit;\r\nand we affirm, that in his relation to the people of India he was bound\r\nto act according to the largest and most liberal construction of their\r\nlaws, rights, usages, institutions, and good customs; and we furthermore\r\nassert, that he was under an express obligation to yield implicit\r\nobedience to the Court of Directors. It is upon these rules and\r\nprinciples the Commons contend that Mr. Hastings ought to have regulated\r\nhis government; and not only Mr. Hastings, but all other governors. It\r\nis upon these rules that he is responsible; and upon these rules, and\r\nthese rules only, your Lordships are to judge.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, long before the Committee had resolved upon this impeachment,\r\nwe had come, as I have told your Lordships, to forty-five resolutions,\r\nevery one criminatory of this man, every one of them bottomed upon the\r\nprinciples which I have stated. We never will nor can we abandon them;\r\nand we therefore do not supplicate your Lordships upon this head, but\r\nclaim and demand of right, that you will judge him upon those\r\nprinciples, and upon no other. If once they are evaded, you can have no\r\nrule for your judgment but your caprices and partialities.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the principles upon which the Commons hold him and\r\nall governors responsible, and upon which we have grounded our\r\nimpeachment, and which must be the grounds of your judgment, (and your\r\nLordships will not suffer any other ground to be mentioned to you,) we\r\nwill now tell you what are the grounds of his defence.\r\n\r\nHe first asserts, that he was possessed of an arbitrary and despotic\r\npower, restrained by no laws but his own will. He next says, that \"the\r\nrights of the people he governed in India are nothing, and that the\r\nrights of the government are everything.\" The people, he asserts, have\r\nno liberty, no laws, no inheritance, no fixed property, no descendable\r\nestate, no subordinations in society, no sense of honor or of shame, and\r\nthat they are only affected by punishment so far as punishment is a\r\ncorporal infliction, being totally insensible of any difference between\r\nthe punishment of man and beast. These are the principles of his Indian\r\ngovernment, which Mr. Hastings has avowed in their full extent. Whenever\r\nprecedents are required, he cites and follows the example of avowed\r\ntyrants, of Aliverdy Khân, Cossim Ali Khân, and Sujah Dowlah. With an\r\navowal of these principles he was pleased first to entertain the House\r\nof Commons, the _active_ assertors and conservators of the rights,\r\nliberties, and laws of his country; and then to insist upon them more\r\nlargely and in a fuller detail before this awful tribunal, the _passive_\r\njudicial conservator of the same great interests. He has brought out\r\nthese blasphemous doctrines in this great temple of justice, consecrated\r\nto law and equity for a long series of ages. He has brought them forth\r\nin Westminster Hall, in presence of all the Judges of the land, who are\r\nto execute the law, and of the House of Lords, who are bound as its\r\nguardians not to suffer the words \"arbitrary power\" to be mentioned\r\nbefore them. For I am not again to tell your Lordships, that arbitrary\r\npower is treason in the law,--that to mention it with law is to commit a\r\ncontradiction in terms. They cannot exist in concert; they cannot hold\r\ntogether for a moment.\r\n\r\nLet us now hear what the prisoner says. \"The sovereignty which they [the\r\nsubahdars, or viceroys of the Mogul empire] assumed, it fell to my lot,\r\nvery unexpectedly, to exert; and whether or not such power, or powers of\r\nthat nature, were delegated to me by any provisions of any act of\r\nParliament I confess myself too little of a lawyer to pronounce. I only\r\nknow that the acceptance of the sovereignty of Benares, &c., is not\r\nacknowledged or admitted by any act of Parliament; and yet, by the\r\nparticular interference of the majority of the Council, the Company is\r\nclearly and indisputably seized of that sovereignty. If, therefore, the\r\n_sovereignty_ of Benares, as ceded to us by the Vizier, have _any rights\r\nwhatever_ annexed to it, and be not a mere empty word without meaning,\r\nthose rights must be such as are held, countenanced, and established by\r\nthe law, custom, and usage of the Mogul empire, and not by the\r\nprovisions of any British act of Parliament hitherto enacted. _Those\r\nrights_, and none other, I have been the involuntary instrument of\r\nenforcing. And if any future act of Parliament shall positively or by\r\nimplication tend to annihilate those very rights, or their exertion, as\r\nI have exerted them, I much fear that the boasted sovereignty of\r\nBenares, which was held up as an acquisition almost obtruded on the\r\nCompany against my consent and opinion, (for I acknowledge that even\r\nthen I foresaw many difficulties and inconveniences in its future\r\nexercise,)--I fear, I say, that this sovereignty will be found a burden\r\ninstead of a benefit, a heavy clog rather than a precious gem to its\r\npresent possessors: I mean, unless the whole of our territory in that\r\nquarter shall be rounded and made an uniform compact body by one grand\r\nand systematic arrangement,--such an arrangement as shall do away all\r\nthe mischiefs, doubts, and inconveniences (both to the governors and\r\nthe governed) arising from the variety of tenures, rights, and claims in\r\nall cases of landed property and feudal jurisdiction in India, from the\r\ninformality, invalidity, and instability of all engagements in so\r\ndivided and unsettled a state of society, and from the unavoidable\r\nanarchy and confusion of different laws, religions, and prejudices,\r\nmoral, civil, and political, all jumbled together in one unnatural and\r\ndiscordant mass. Every part of Hindostan has been constantly exposed to\r\nthese and similar disadvantages ever since the Mahometan conquests. The\r\nHindoos, who never incorporated with their conquerors, were kept in\r\norder only by the strong hand of power. The constant necessity of\r\nsimilar exertions would increase at once their energy and extent. So\r\nthat rebellion itself is the parent and promoter of _despotism_.\r\nSovereignty in India implies nothing else. For I know not how we can\r\nform an estimate of its powers, but from its visible effects; and those\r\nare everywhere the same from Cabool to Assam. The whole history of Asia\r\nis nothing more than precedents to prove the invariable exercise of\r\narbitrary power. To all this I strongly alluded in the minutes I\r\ndelivered in Council, when the treaty with the new Vizier was on foot in\r\n1775; and I wished to make Cheyt Sing independent, because in India\r\ndependence included a thousand evils, many of which I enumerated at that\r\ntime, and they are entered in the ninth clause of the first section of\r\nthis charge. I knew the powers with which an Indian sovereignty is\r\narmed, and the dangers to which tributaries are exposed. I knew, that,\r\nfrom the history of Asia, and from the very nature of mankind, the\r\nsubjects of a despotic empire are always vigilant for the moment to\r\nrebel, and the sovereign is ever jealous of rebellious intentions. A\r\nzemindar is an Indian subject, and as such exposed to the common lot of\r\nhis fellows. _The mean and depraved state of a mere zemindar_ is\r\ntherefore this very dependence above mentioned on a despotic government,\r\nthis very proneness to shake off his allegiance, and this very exposure\r\nto continual danger from his sovereign's jealousy, which are consequent\r\non the political state of Hindostanic governments. Bulwant Sing, if he\r\nhad been, and Cheyt Sing, as long as he was, a zemindar, stood exactly\r\nin this _mean and depraved state_ by the constitution of his country. I\r\ndid not make it for him, but would have secured him from it. Those who\r\nmade him a zemindar entailed upon him the consequences of so mean and\r\ndepraved a tenure. Aliverdy Khân and Cossim Ali fined all their\r\nzemindars on the necessities of war, and on every pretence either of\r\ncourt necessity or court extravagance.\"\r\n\r\nI beseech your Lordships seriously to look upon the whole nature of the\r\nprinciples upon which the prisoner defends himself. He appeals to the\r\ncustom and usage of the Mogul empire; and the constitution of that\r\nempire is, he says, arbitrary power. He says, that he does not know\r\nwhether any act of Parliament bound him not to exercise this arbitrary\r\npower, and that, if any such act should in future be made, it would be\r\nmischievous and ruinous to our empire in India. Thus he has at once\r\nrepealed all preceding acts, he has annulled by prospect every future\r\nact you can make; and it is not in the power of the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, without ruining the empire, to hinder his exercising this\r\ndespotic authority. All Asia is by him disfranchised at a stroke. Its\r\ninhabitants have no rights, no laws, no liberties; their state is mean\r\nand depraved; they may be fined for any purpose of court extravagance or\r\nprodigality,--or as Cheyt Sing was fined by him, not only upon every\r\nwar, but upon every pretence of war.\r\n\r\nThis is the account he gives of his power, and of the people subject to\r\nthe British government in India. We deny that the act of Parliament gave\r\nhim any such power; we deny that the India Company gave him any such\r\npower, or that they had ever any such power to give; we even deny that\r\nthere exists in all the human race a power to make the government of any\r\nstate dependent upon individual will. We disclaim, we reject all such\r\ndoctrines with disdain and indignation; and we have brought them up to\r\nyour Lordships to be tried at your bar.\r\n\r\nWhat must be the condition of the people of India, governed, as they\r\nhave been, by persons who maintain these principles as maxims of\r\ngovernment, and not as occasional deviations caused by the irregular\r\nwill of man,--principles by which the whole system of society is to be\r\ncontrolled, not by law, reason, or justice, but by the will of one man?\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remark, that not only the whole of the laws, rights,\r\nand usages, but the very being of the people, are exposed to ruin: for\r\nMr. Hastings says, that the people may be fined, that they may be\r\nexiled, that they may be imprisoned, and that even their lives are\r\ndependent upon the mere will of their foreign master; and that he, the\r\nCompany's Governor, exercised that will under the authority of this\r\ncountry. Remark, my Lords, his application of this doctrine. \"I would,\"\r\nhe says, \"have kept Cheyt Sing from the consequences of this dependence,\r\nby making him independent, and not in any manner subjecting him to our\r\ngovernment. The moment he came into a state of dependence upon the\r\nBritish government, all these evils attached upon him.--It is,\" he adds,\r\n\"disagreeable to me to exert such powers; but I know they must be\r\nexerted; and I declare there is no security from this arbitrary power,\r\nbut by having nothing to do with the British government.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the House of Commons has already well considered what may be\r\nour future moral and political condition, when the persons who come from\r\nthat school of pride, insolence, corruption, and tyranny are more\r\nintimately mixed up with us of purer morals. Nothing but contamination\r\ncan be the result, nothing but corruption can exist in this country,\r\nunless we expunge this doctrine out of the very hearts and souls of the\r\npeople. It is not to the gang of plunderers and robbers of which I say\r\nthis man is at the head, that we are only, or indeed principally, to\r\nlook. Every man in Great Britain will be contaminated and must be\r\ncorrupted, if you let loose among us whole legions of men, generation\r\nafter generation, tainted with these abominable vices, and avowing these\r\ndetestable principles. It is, therefore, to preserve the integrity and\r\nhonor of the Commons of Great Britain, that we have brought this man to\r\nyour Lordships' bar.\r\n\r\nWhen these matters were first explained to your Lordships, and strongly\r\nenforced by abilities greater than I can exert, there was something like\r\ncompunction shown by the prisoner: but he took the most strange mode to\r\ncover his guilt. Upon the cross-examination of Major Scott, he\r\ndiscovered all the engines of this Indian corruption. Mr. Hastings got\r\nthat witness to swear that this defence of his, from which the passages\r\nI have read to your Lordships are extracted, was not his, but that it\r\nwas the work of his whole Council, composed of Mr. Middleton, Mr. Shore,\r\nMr. Halhed, Mr. Baber,--the whole body of his Indian Cabinet Council;\r\nthat this was their work, and not his; and that he disclaimed it, and\r\ntherefore that it would be wrong to press it upon him. Good God! my\r\nLords, what shall we say in this stage of the business? The prisoner put\r\nin an elaborate defence: he now disclaims that defence. He told us that\r\nit was of his own writing, that he had been able to compose it in five\r\ndays; and he now gets five persons to contradict his own assertions, and\r\nto disprove on oath his most solemn declarations.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this business appears still more alarming, when we find not\r\nonly Mr. Hastings, but his whole Council, engaged in it. I pray your\r\nLordships to observe, that Mr. Halhed, a person concerned with Mr.\r\nHastings in compiling a code of Gentoo laws, is now found to be one of\r\nthe persons to whom this very defence is attributed which contains such\r\ndetestable and abominable doctrines. But are we to consider the contents\r\nof this paper as the defence of the prisoner or not? Will any one say,\r\nthat, when an answer is sworn to in Chancery, when an answer is given\r\nhere to an impeachment of the Commons, or when a plea is made to an\r\nindictment, that it is drawn by the defendant's counsel, and therefore\r\nis not his? Did we not all hear him read this defence in part at our\r\nbar?--did we not see him hand it to his secretary to have it read by his\r\nson?--did he not then hear it read from end to end?--did not he himself\r\ndesire it to be printed, (for it was no act of ours,) and did he not\r\nsuperintend and revise the press?--and has any breath but his own\r\nbreathed upon it? No, my Lords, the whole composition is his, by writing\r\nor adoption; and never, till he found it pressed him in this House,\r\nnever, till your Lordships began to entertain the same abhorrence of it\r\nthat we did, did he disclaim it.\r\n\r\nBut mark another stage of the propagation of these horrible principles.\r\nAfter having grounded upon them the defence of his conduct against our\r\ncharge, and after he had got a person to forswear them for him, and to\r\nprove him to have told falsehoods of the grossest kind to the House of\r\nCommons, he again adheres to this defence. The dog returned to his\r\nvomit. After having vomited out his vile, bilious stuff of arbitrary\r\npower, and afterwards denied it to be his, he gets his counsel in this\r\nplace to resort to the loathsome mess again. They have thought proper,\r\nmy Lords, to enter into an extended series of quotations from books of\r\ntravellers, for the purpose of showing that despotism was the only\r\nprinciple of government acknowledged in India,--that the people have no\r\nlaws, no rights, no property movable or immovable, no distinction of\r\nranks, nor any sense of disgrace. After citing a long line of travellers\r\nto this effect, they quote Montesquieu as asserting the same facts,\r\ndeclaring that the people of India had no sense of honor, and were only\r\nsensible of the whip as far as it produced corporal pain. They then\r\nproceed to state that it was a government of misrule, productive of no\r\nhappiness to the people, and that it so continued until subverted by the\r\nfree government of Britain,--namely, the government that Mr. Hastings\r\ndescribes as having himself exercised there.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if the prisoner can succeed in persuading us that these people\r\nhave no laws, no rights, not even the common sentiments and feeling of\r\nmen, he hopes your interest in them will be considerably lessened. He\r\nwould persuade you that their sufferings are much assuaged by their\r\nbeing nothing new,--and that, having no right to property, to liberty,\r\nto honor, or to life, they must be more pleased with the little that is\r\nleft to them than grieved for the much that has been ravished from them\r\nby his cruelty and his avarice. This inference makes it very necessary\r\nfor me, before I proceed further, to make a few remarks upon this part\r\nof the prisoner's conduct, which your Lordships must have already felt\r\nwith astonishment, perhaps with indignation. This man, who passed\r\ntwenty-five years in India, who was fourteen years at the head of his\r\ngovernment, master of all the offices, master of all the registers and\r\nrecords, master of all the lawyers and priests of all this empire, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest, instead of producing to you the fruits of so\r\nmany years' local and official knowledge upon that subject, has called\r\nout a long line of the rabble of travellers to inform you concerning the\r\nobjects of his own government. That his learned counsel should be\r\nignorant of those things is a matter of course. That, if left to\r\nhimself, the person who has produced all this stuff should, in pursuit\r\nof his darling arbitrary power, wander without a guide, or with false\r\nguides, is quite natural. But your Lordships must have heard with\r\nastonishment, that, upon points of law relative to the tenure of lands,\r\ninstead of producing any law document or authority on the usages and\r\nlocal customs of the country, he has referred to officers in the army,\r\ncolonels of artillery and engineers, to young gentlemen just come from\r\nschool, not above three or four years in the country. Good God! would\r\nnot one rather have expected to hear him put all these travellers to\r\nshame by the authority of a man who had resided so long in the supreme\r\nsituation of government,--to set aside all these wild, loose, casual,\r\nand silly observations of travellers and theorists? On the contrary, as\r\nif he was ignorant of everything, as if he knew nothing of India, as if\r\nhe had dropped from the clouds, he cites the observations of every\r\nstranger who had been hurried in a palanquin through the country,\r\ncapable or incapable of observation, to prove to you the nature of the\r\ngovernment, and of the power he had to exercise.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Commons of Great Britain are not disposed to resort to the\r\nridiculous relations of travellers, or to the wild systems which\r\ningenious men have thought proper to build on their authority. We will\r\ntake another mode. We will undertake to prove the direct contrary of his\r\nassertions in every point and particular. We undertake to do this,\r\nbecause your Lordships know, and because the world knows, that, if you\r\ngo into a country where you suppose man to be in a servile\r\nstate,--where, the despot excepted, there is no one person who can lift\r\nup his head above another,--where all are a set of vile, miserable\r\nslaves, prostrate and confounded in a common servitude, having no\r\ndescendible lands, no inheritance, nothing that makes man feel proud of\r\nhimself, or that gives him honor and distinction with others,--this\r\nabject degradation will take from you that kind of sympathy which\r\nnaturally attaches you to men feeling like yourselves, to men who have\r\nhereditary dignities to support, and lands of inheritance to maintain,\r\nas you peers have; you will, I say, no longer have that feeling which\r\nyou ought to have for the sufferings of a people whom you suppose to be\r\nhabituated to their sufferings and familiar with degradation. This makes\r\nit absolutely necessary for me to refute every one of these\r\nmisrepresentations; and whilst I am endeavoring to establish the rights\r\nof these people, in order to show in what manner and degree they have\r\nbeen violated, I trust that your Lordships will not think that the time\r\nis lost: certainly I do not think that my labor will be misspent in\r\nendeavoring to bring these matters fully before you.\r\n\r\nIn determining to treat this subject at length, I am also influenced by\r\na strong sense of the evils that have attended the propagation of these\r\nwild, groundless, and pernicious opinions. A young man goes to India\r\nbefore he knows much of his own country; but he cherishes in his breast,\r\nas I hope every man will, a just and laudable partiality for the laws,\r\nliberties, rights, and institutions of his own nation. We all do this;\r\nand God forbid we should not prefer our own to every other country in\r\nthe world! but if we go to India with an idea of the mean, degraded\r\nstate of the people that we are to govern, and especially if we go with\r\nthese impressions at an immature age, we know, that, according to the\r\nordinary course of human nature, we shall not treat persons well whom we\r\nhave learnt to despise. We know that people whom we suppose to have\r\nneither laws or rights will not be treated by us as a people who have\r\nlaws and rights. This error, therefore, for our sake, for your sake, for\r\nthe sake of the Indian public, and for the sake of all those who shall\r\nhereafter go in any station to India, I think it necessary to disprove\r\nin every point.\r\n\r\nI mean to prove the direct contrary of everything that has been said on\r\nthis subject by the prisoner's counsel, or by himself. I mean to prove\r\nthat the people of India have laws, rights, and immunities; that they\r\nhave property, movable and immovable, descendible as well as occasional;\r\nthat they have property held for life, and that they have it as well\r\nsecured to them by the laws of their country as any property is secured\r\nin this country; that they feel for honor, not only as much as your\r\nLordships can feel, but with a _more_ exquisite and poignant sense than\r\nany people upon earth; and that, when punishments are inflicted, it is\r\nnot the lash they feel, but the disgrace: in short, I mean to prove that\r\nevery word which Montesquieu has taken from idle and inconsiderate\r\ntravellers is absolutely false.\r\n\r\nThe people of India are divided into three kinds: the original natives\r\nof the country, commonly called Gentoos; the descendants of the Persians\r\nand Arabians, who are Mahometans; and the descendants of the Moguls, who\r\noriginally had a religion of their own, but are now blended with the\r\nother inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe primeval law of that country is the Gentoo law; and I refer your\r\nLordships to Mr. Halhed's translation of that singular code,--a work\r\nwhich I have read with all the care that such an extraordinary view of\r\nhuman affairs and human constitutions deserves. I do not know whether\r\nMr. Halhed's compilation is in evidence before your Lordships, but I do\r\nknow that it is good authority on the Gentoo law. Mr. Hastings, who\r\ninstructed his counsel to assert that the people have \"no rights, no\r\nlaw,\" ought to be well acquainted with this work, because he claimed\r\nfor a while the glory of the compilation, although Nobkissin, as your\r\nLordships remember, was obliged to pay the expense. This book, a\r\ncompilation of probably the most ancient laws in the world, if we except\r\nthe Mosaic, has in it the duty of the magistrate and the duty of all\r\nranks of subjects most clearly and distinctly ascertained; and I will\r\ngive up the whole cause, if there is, from one end to the other of this\r\ncode, any sort of arbitrary power claimed or asserted on the part of the\r\nmagistrate, or any declaration that the people have no rights of\r\nproperty. No: it asserts the direct contrary.\r\n\r\nFirst, the people are divided into classes and ranks, with more accuracy\r\nof distinction than is used in this country, or in any other country\r\nunder heaven. Every class is divided into families, some of whom are\r\nmore distinguished and more honorable than others; and they all have\r\nrights, privileges, and immunities belonging to them. Even in cases of\r\nconquest, no confiscation is to take place. A Brahmin's estate comes by\r\ndescent to him; it is forever descendible to his heirs, if he has heirs;\r\nand if he has none, it belongs to his disciples, and those connected\r\nwith him in the Brahminical caste. There are other immunities declared\r\nto belong to this caste, in direct contradiction to what has been\r\nasserted by the prisoner. In no case shall a Brahmin suffer death; in no\r\ncase shall the property of a Brahmin, male or female, be confiscated for\r\ncrime, or escheat for want of heirs. The law then goes on to other\r\ncastes, and gives to each its property, and distinguishes them with\r\ngreat accuracy of discrimination.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says that there is no inheritable property among them. Now\r\nyou have only to look at page 27, chapter the second, the title of\r\nwhich, is, _Of the Division of Inheritable Property_. There, after going\r\nthrough all the nicety of pedigree, it is declared, that, \"when a\r\nfather, or grandfather, a great-grandfather, or any relations of that\r\nnature, decease, or lose their caste, or renounce the world, or are\r\ndesirous to give up their property, their sons, grandsons,\r\ngreat-grandsons, and other natural heirs, may divide and assume their\r\nglebe-lands, orchards, jewels, corals, clothes, furniture, cattle, and\r\nbirds, and all the estate, real and personal.\" My Lords, this law\r\nrecognizes this kind of property; it regulates it with the nicest\r\naccuracy of distinction; it settles the descent of it in every part and\r\ncircumstance. It nowhere asserts (but the direct contrary is positively\r\nasserted) that the magistrate has any power whatever over property. It\r\nstates that it is the magistrate's duty to protect it; that he is bound\r\nto govern by law; that he must have a council of Brahmins to assist him\r\nin every material act that he does: in short, my Lords, there is not\r\neven a trace of arbitrary power in the whole system.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will mention one article, to let you see, in a very few\r\nwords, that these Gentoos not only have an inheritance, but that the law\r\nhas established a right of _acquiring_ possession in the property of\r\nanother by prescription. The passage stands thus:--\"If there be a person\r\nwho is not a minor,\" (a man ceases to be a minor at fifteen years of\r\nage,) \"nor impotent, nor diseased, nor an idiot, nor so lame as not to\r\nhave power to walk, nor blind, nor one who, on going before a\r\nmagistrate, is found incapable of distinguishing and attending to his\r\nown concerns, and who has not given to another person power to employ\r\nand to use his property,--if, in the face of any such person, another\r\nman has applied to his own use, during the space of twenty years, the\r\nglebe-land or houses or orchards of that person, without let or\r\nmolestation from him, from the twenty-first year the property becomes\r\ninvested in the person so applying such things to his own use; and any\r\nclaim of the first person above mentioned upon such glebe-[land or?]\r\nhouses or orchards shall by no means stand good: but if the person\r\nbefore mentioned comes under any of the circumstances herein before\r\ndescribed, his claim in that case shall stand good.\" Here you see, my\r\nLords, that possession shall by prescription stand good against the\r\nclaims of all persons who are not disqualified from making their claims.\r\n\r\nI might, if necessary, show your Lordships that the highest magistrate\r\nis subject to the law; that there is a case in which he is finable; that\r\nthey have established rules of evidence and of pleading, and, in short,\r\nall the rules which have been formed in other countries to prevent this\r\nvery arbitrary power. Notwithstanding all this, the prisoner at the bar,\r\nand his counsel, have dared to assert, in this sacred temple of justice,\r\nin the presence of this great assembly, of all the bishops, of all the\r\npeers, and of all the judges of this land, that the people of India have\r\nno laws whatever.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to trouble your Lordships with more extracts from this\r\nbook. I recommend it to your Lordships' reading,--when you will find,\r\nthat, so far from the magistrate having any power either to imprison\r\narbitrarily or to fine arbitrarily, the rules of fines are laid down\r\nwith ten thousand times more exactness than with us. If you here find\r\nthat the magistrate has any power to punish the people with arbitrary\r\npunishment, to seize their property, or to disfranchise them of any\r\nrights or privileges, I will readily admit that Mr. Hastings has laid\r\ndown good, sound doctrine upon this subject. There is his own book, a\r\ncompilation of their laws, which has in it not only good and excellent\r\npositive rules, but a system of as enlightened jurisprudence, with\r\nregard to the body and substance of it, as perhaps any nation ever\r\npossessed,--a system which must have been composed by men of highly\r\ncultivated understandings.\r\n\r\nAs to the travellers that have been quoted, absurd as they are in the\r\nground of their argument, they are not less absurd in their reasonings.\r\nFor, having first laid it down that there is no property, and that the\r\ngovernment is the proprietor of everything, they argue, inferentially,\r\nthat they have no laws. But if ever there were a people that seem to be\r\nprotected with care and circumspection from all arbitrary power, both in\r\nthe executive and judicial department, these are the people that seem to\r\nbe so protected.\r\n\r\nI could show your Lordships that they are so sensible of honor, that\r\nfines are levied and punishment inflicted according to the rank of the\r\nculprit, and that the very authority of the magistrate is dependent on\r\ntheir rank. That the learned counsel should be ignorant of these things\r\nis natural enough. They are concerned in the gainful part of their\r\nprofession. If they know the laws of their own country, which I dare say\r\nthey do, it is not to be expected that they should know the laws of any\r\nother. But, my Lords, it is to be expected that the prisoner should know\r\nthe Gentoo laws: for he not only cheated Nobkissin of his money to get\r\nthese laws translated, but he took credit for the publication of the\r\nwork as an act of public spirit, after shifting the payment from himself\r\nby fraud and peculation. All this has been proved by the testimonies of\r\nMr. Auriol and Mr. Halhed before your Lordships.\r\n\r\nWe do not bring forward this book as evidence of guilt or innocence, but\r\nto show the laws and usages of the country, and to prove the prisoner's\r\nknowledge of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gentoo we will proceed to the Tartarian government of India, a\r\ngovernment established by conquest, and therefore not likely to be\r\ndistinguished by any marks of extraordinary mildness towards the\r\nconquered. The book before me will prove to your Lordships that the head\r\nof this government (who is falsely supposed to have a despotic\r\nauthority) is absolutely elected to his office. Tamerlane was elected;\r\nand Genghis Khân particularly valued himself on improving the laws and\r\ninstitutions of his own country. These laws we only have imperfectly in\r\nthis book; but we are told in it, and I believe the fact, that he\r\nforbade, under pain of death, any prince or other person to presume to\r\ncause himself to be proclaimed Great Khân or Emperor, without being\r\nfirst duly elected by the princes lawfully assembled in general diet. He\r\nthen established the privileges and immunities granted to the\r\nTunkawns,--that is, to the nobility and gentry of the country,--and\r\nafterwards published most severe ordinances against governors who failed\r\nin doing their duty, but principally against those who commanded in far\r\ndistant provinces. This prince was in this case, what I hope your\r\nLordships will be, a very severe judge of the governors of countries\r\nremote from the seat of the government.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have in this book sufficient proof that a Tartarian\r\nsovereign could not obtain the recognition of ancient laws, or establish\r\nnew ones, without the consent of his parliament; that he could not\r\nascend the throne without being duly elected; and that, when so elected,\r\nhe was bound to preserve the great in all their immunities, and the\r\npeople in all their rights, liberties, privileges, and properties. We\r\nfind these great princes restrained by laws, and even making wise and\r\nsalutary regulations for the countries which they conquered. We find\r\nGenghis Khân establishing one of his sons in a particular\r\noffice,--namely, conservator of those laws; and he has ordered that they\r\nshould not only be observed in his time, but by all posterity; and\r\naccordingly they are venerated at this time in Asia. If, then, this very\r\nGenghis Khân, if Tamerlane, did not assume arbitrary power, what are you\r\nto think of this man, so bloated with corruption, so bloated with the\r\ninsolence of unmerited power, declaring that the people of India have no\r\nrights, no property, no laws,--that he could not be bound even by an\r\nEnglish act of Parliament,--that he was an arbitrary sovereign in India,\r\nand could exact what penalties he pleased from the people, at the\r\nexpense of liberty, property, and even life itself? Compare this man,\r\nthis compound of pride and presumption, with Genghis Khân, whose\r\nconquests were more considerable than Alexander's, and yet who made the\r\nlaws the rule of his conduct; compare him with Tamerlane, whose\r\nInstitutes I have before me. I wish to save your Lordships' time, or I\r\ncould show you in the life of this prince, that he, violent as his\r\nconquests were, bloody as all conquests are, ferocious as a Mahometan\r\nmaking his crusades for the propagation of his religion, he yet knew how\r\nto govern his unjust acquisitions with equity and moderation. If any man\r\ncould be entitled to claim arbitrary power, if such a claim could be\r\njustified by extent of conquest, by splendid personal qualities, by\r\ngreat learning and eloquence, Tamerlane was the man who could have made\r\nand justified the claim. This prince gave up all his time not employed\r\nin conquests to the conversation of learned men. He gave himself to all\r\nstudies that might accomplish a great man. Such a man, I say, might, if\r\nany may, claim arbitrary power. But the very things that made him great\r\nmade him sensible that he was but a man. Even in the midst of all his\r\nconquests, his tone was a tone of humility; he spoke of laws as every\r\nman must who knows what laws are; and though he was proud, ferocious,\r\nand violent in the achievement of his conquests, I will venture to say\r\nno prince ever established institutes of civil government more honorable\r\nto himself than the Institutes of Timour. I shall be content to be\r\nbrought to shame before your Lordships, if the prisoner at your bar can\r\nshow me one passage where the assumption of arbitrary power is even\r\nhinted at by this great conqueror. He declares that the nobility of\r\nevery country shall be considered as his brethren, that the people shall\r\nbe acknowledged as his children, and that the learned and the dervishes\r\nshall be particularly protected. But, my Lords, what he particularly\r\nvalued himself upon I shall give your Lordships in his own words:--\"I\r\ndelivered the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor; and after proof\r\nof the oppression, whether on the property or the person, the decision\r\nwhich I passed between them was agreeable to the sacred law; and I did\r\nnot cause any one person to suffer for the guilt of another.\"[95]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have only further to inform your Lordships that these\r\nInstitutes of Timour ought to be very well known to Mr. Hastings. He\r\nought to have known that this prince never claimed arbitrary power; that\r\nthe principles he adopted were to govern by law, to repress the\r\noppressions of his inferior governors, to recognize in the nobility the\r\nrespect due to their rank, and in the people the protection to which\r\nthey were by law entitled. This book was published by Major Davy, and\r\nrevised by Mr. White. The Major was an excellent Orientalist; he was\r\nsecretary to Mr. Hastings, to whom, I believe, he dedicated this book. I\r\nhave inquired of persons the most conversant with the Arabic and\r\nOriental languages, and they are clearly of opinion that there is\r\ninternal evidence to prove it of the age of Tamerlane; and he must be\r\nthe most miserable of critics, who, reading this work with attention,\r\ndoes not see, that, if it was not written by this very great monarch\r\nhimself, it was at least written by some person in his court and under\r\nhis immediate inspection. Whether, therefore, this work be the\r\ncomposition of Tamerlane, or whether it was written by some persons of\r\nlearning near him, through whom he meant to give the world a just idea\r\nof his manners, maxims, and government, it is certainly as good\r\nauthority as Mr. Hastings's _Defence_, which he has acknowledged to have\r\nbeen written by other people.\r\n\r\nFrom the Tartarian I shall now proceed to the later Mahometan conquerors\r\nof Hindostan: for it is fit that I should show your Lordships the\r\nwickedness of pretending that the people of India have no laws or\r\nrights. A great proportion of the people are Mahometans; and Mahometans\r\nare so far from having no laws or rights, that, when you name a\r\nMahometan, you name a man governed by law and entitled to protection.\r\nMr. Hastings caused to be published, and I am obliged to him for it, a\r\nbook called \"The Hedaya\": it is true that he has himself taken credit\r\nfor the work, and robbed Nobkissin of the money to pay for it; but the\r\nvalue of a book is not lessened because a man stole it. Will you\r\nbelieve, my Lords, that a people having no laws, no rights, no property,\r\nno honor, would be at the trouble of having so many writers on\r\njurisprudence? And yet there are, I am sure, at least a thousand eminent\r\nMahometan writers upon law, who have written far more voluminous works\r\nthan are known in the Common Law of England, and I verily believe more\r\nvoluminous than the writings of the Civilians themselves. That this\r\nshould be done by a people who have no property is so perfectly\r\nridiculous as scarcely to require refutation; but I shall endeavor to\r\nrefute it, and without troubling you a great deal.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, I am to tell you that the Mahometans are a people amongst\r\nwhom the science of jurisprudence is much studied and cultivated; that\r\nthey distinguish it into the law of the _Koran_ and its authorized\r\ncommentaries,--into the _Fetwah_, which is the judicial judgments and\r\nreports of adjudged cases,--into the _Canon_, which is the regulations\r\nmade by the emperor for the sovereign authority in the government of\r\ntheir dominions,--and, lastly, into the _Rawaj-ul-Mulk_, or custom and\r\nusage, the common law of the country, which prevails independent of any\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nIn regard to punishments being arbitrary, I will, with your Lordships'\r\npermission, read a passage which will show you that the magistrate is a\r\nresponsible person. \"If a supreme ruler, such as the Caliph for the time\r\nbeing, commit any offence punishable by law, such as whoredom, theft, or\r\ndrunkenness, he is not subject to any punishment; but yet if he commit\r\nmurder, he is subject to the law of retaliation, and he is also\r\naccountable in matters of property: because _punishment_ is a right of\r\nGod, the infliction of which is committed to the Caliph, or other\r\nsupreme magistrate, and to none else; and he cannot inflict punishment\r\nupon himself, as in this there is no advantage, because the good\r\nproposed in punishment is that it may operate as a warning to deter\r\nmankind from sin, and this is not obtained by a person's inflicting\r\npunishment upon himself, contrary to the rights of the _individual_,\r\nsuch as the laws of _retaliation_ and of _property_, the penalties of\r\nwhich may be exacted of the Caliph, as the claimant of right may obtain\r\nsatisfaction, either by the Caliph impowering him to exact his right\r\nfrom himself, or by the claimant appealing for assistance to the\r\ncollective body of Mussulmans.\"[96]\r\n\r\nHere your Lordships see that the Caliph, who is a magistrate of the\r\nhighest authority which can exist among the Mahometans, where property\r\nor life is concerned has no arbitrary power, but is responsible just as\r\nmuch as any other man.\r\n\r\nI am now to inform your Lordships that the sovereign can raise no taxes.\r\nThe imposing of a tribute upon a Mussulman, without his previous\r\nconsent, is impracticable. And so far from all property belonging to the\r\nsovereign, the public treasure does not belong to him. It is declared to\r\nbe the common property of all Mahometans. This doctrine is laid down in\r\nmany places, but particularly in the 95th page of the second volume of\r\nHamilton's Hedaya.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has told you what a sovereign is, and what sovereignty is,\r\nall over India; and I wish your Lordships to pay particular attention to\r\nthis part of his defence, and to compare Mr. Hastings's idea of\r\nsovereignty with the declaration of the Mahometan law. The tenth chapter\r\nof these laws treats of rebellion, which is defined an act of warfare\r\nagainst the sovereign. You are there told who the sovereign is, and how\r\nmany kinds of rebels there are. The author then proceeds to say,--\"The\r\nword _bâghee_ (rebellion), in its literal sense, means prevarication,\r\nalso, injustice and tyranny; in the language of the law it is\r\nparticularly applied to injustice, namely, withdrawing from obedience to\r\nthe rightful Imaum (as appears in the _Fattahal-Kadeen_). By the\r\nrightful Imaum is understood a person in whom all the qualities\r\nessential to magistracy are united, such as Islamism, freedom, sanity of\r\nintellect, and maturity of age,--and who has been elected into his\r\noffice by any tribe of Mussulmans, with their general consent; whose\r\nview and intention is the advancement of the true religion and the\r\nstrengthening of the Mussulmans, and under whom the Mussulmans enjoy\r\nsecurity in person and property; one who levies tithe and tribute\r\naccording to law; who out of the public treasury pays what is due to\r\nlearned men, preachers, kâzees, muftis, philosophers, public teachers,\r\nand so forth; and who is just in all his dealings with Mussulmans: for\r\nwhoever does not answer this description is not the right Imaum; whence\r\nit is not incumbent to support such a one; but rather it is incumbent to\r\noppose him and make war upon him, until such time as he either adopt a\r\nproper mode of conduct or be slain.\"[97]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, is this a magistrate of the same description as the sovereign\r\ndelineated by Mr. Hastings? This man must be elected by the general\r\nconsent of Mussulmans; he must be a protector of the person and property\r\nof his subjects; a right of resistance is directly established by law\r\nagainst him, and even the duty of resistance is insisted upon. Am I, in\r\npraising this Mahometan law, applauding the principle of elective\r\nsovereignty? No, my Lords, I know the mischiefs which have attended it;\r\nI know that it has shaken the thrones of most of the sovereigns of the\r\nMussulman religion; but I produce the law as the clearest proof that\r\nsuch a sovereign cannot be supposed to have an arbitrary power over the\r\nproperty and persons of those who elect him, and who have an\r\nacknowledged right to resist and dethrone him, if he does not afford\r\nthem protection.\r\n\r\nI have now gone through what I undertook to prove,--that Mr. Hastings,\r\nwith all his Indian Council, who have made up this volume of arbitrary\r\npower, are not supported by the laws of the Moguls, by the laws of the\r\nGentoos, by the Mahometan laws, or by any law, custom, or usage which\r\nhas ever been recognized as legal and valid.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, the prisoner defends himself by example; and, good God!\r\nwhat are the examples which he has chosen? Not the local usages and\r\nconstitutions of Oude or of any other province; not the general practice\r\nof a respectable emperor, like Akbar, which, if it would not fatigue\r\nyour Lordships, I could show to be the very reverse of this man's. No,\r\nmy Lords, the prisoner, his learned counsel here, and his unlearned\r\nCabinet Council, who wrote this defence, have ransacked the tales of\r\ntravellers for examples, and have selected materials from that mass of\r\nloose remarks and crude conceptions, to prove that the natives of India\r\nhave neither rights, laws, orders, or distinction.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to show your Lordships that the people of India have\r\na keen sense and feeling of disgrace and dishonor. In proof of this I\r\nappeal to well-known facts. There have been women tried in India for\r\noffences, and acquitted, who would not survive the disgrace even of\r\nacquittal. There have been Hindoo soldiers, condemned at a\r\ncourt-martial, who have desired to be blown from the mouth of a cannon,\r\nand have claimed rank and precedence at the last moment of their\r\nexistence. And yet these people are said to have no sense of dishonor!\r\nGood God! that we should be under the necessity of proving, in this\r\nplace, all these things, and of disproving that all India was given in\r\nslavery to this man!\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, they will show you, they say, that Genghis Khân, Kouli\r\nKhân, and Tamerlane destroyed ten thousand times more people in battle\r\nthan this man did. Good God! have they run mad? Have they lost their\r\nsenses in their guilt? Did they ever expect that we meant to compare\r\nthis man to Tamerlane, Genghis Khân, or Kouli Khân?--to compare a clerk\r\nat a bureau, to compare a fraudulent bullock-contractor, (for we could\r\nshow that his first elementary malversations were in carrying on\r\nfraudulent bullock-contracts; which contracts were taken from him with\r\nshame and disgrace, and restored with greater shame and disgrace,) to\r\ncompare him with the conquerors of the world? We never said he was a\r\ntiger and a lion: no, we have said he was a weasel and a rat. We have\r\nsaid that he has desolated countries by the same means that plagues of\r\nhis description have produced similar desolations. We have said that he,\r\na fraudulent bullock-contractor, exalted to great and unmerited powers,\r\ncan do more mischief than even all the tigers and lions in the world. We\r\nknow that a swarm of locusts, although individually despicable, can\r\nrender a country more desolate than Genghis Khân or Tamerlane. When God\r\nAlmighty chose to humble the pride and presumption of Pharaoh, and to\r\nbring him to shame, He did not effect His purpose with tigers and lions;\r\nbut He sent lice, mice, frogs, and everything loathsome and\r\ncontemptible, to pollute and destroy the country. Think of this, my\r\nLords, and of your listening here to these people's long account of\r\nTamerlane's camp of two hundred thousand persons, and of his building a\r\npyramid at Bagdad with the heads of ninety thousand of his prisoners!\r\n\r\nWe have not accused Mr. Hastings of being a great general, and abusing\r\nhis military powers: we know that he was nothing, at the best, but a\r\ncreature of the bureau, raised by peculiar circumstances to the\r\npossession of a power by which incredible mischief might be done. We\r\nhave not accused him of the vices of conquerors: when we see him\r\nsignalized by any conquests, we may then make such an accusation; at\r\npresent we say that he has been trusted with power much beyond his\r\ndeserts, and that trust he has grossly abused.--But to proceed.\r\n\r\nHis counsel, according to their usual audacious manner, (I suppose they\r\nimagine that they are counsel for Tamerlane, or for Genghis Khân,) have\r\nthought proper to accuse the Managers for the Commons of wandering\r\n[wantoning?] in all the fabulous regions of Indian mythology. My Lords,\r\nthe Managers are sensible of the dignity of their place; they have never\r\noffered anything to you without reason. We are not persons of an age, of\r\na disposition, of a character, representative or natural, to _wanton_,\r\nas these counsel call it,--that is, to invent fables concerning Indian\r\nantiquity. That they are not ashamed of making this charge I do not\r\nwonder. But we are not to be thus diverted from our course.\r\n\r\nI have already stated to your Lordships a material circumstance of this\r\ncase, which I hope will never be lost sight of,--namely, the different\r\nsituation in which India stood under the government of its native\r\nprinces and its own original laws, and even under the _dominion_ of\r\nMahometan conquerors, from that in which it has stood under the\r\ngovernment of a series of tyrants, foreign and domestic, particularly of\r\nMr. Hastings, by whom it has latterly been oppressed and desolated. One\r\nof the books which I have quoted was written by Mr. Halhed; and I shall\r\nnot be accused of wantoning in fabulous antiquity, when I refer to\r\nanother living author, who wrote from what he saw and what he well knew.\r\nThis author says,--\"In truth, it would be almost cruelty to molest these\r\nhappy people\" (speaking of the inhabitants of one of the provinces near\r\nCalcutta); \"for in this district are the only vestiges of the beauty,\r\npurity, piety, regularity, equity, and strictness of the ancient\r\nHindostan government: here the property as well as the liberty of the\r\npeople is inviolate.\" My Lords, I do not refer you to this writer\r\nbecause I think it necessary to our justification, nor from any fear\r\nthat your Lordships will not do us the justice to believe that we have\r\ngood authority for the facts which we state, and do not (as persons with\r\ntheir licentious tongues dare to say) wanton in fabulous antiquity. I\r\nquote the works of this author, because his observations and opinions\r\ncould not be unknown to Mr. Hastings, whose associate he was in some\r\nacts, and whose adviser he appears to have been in that dreadful\r\ntransaction, the deposition of Cossim Ali Khân. This writer was\r\nconnected with the prisoner at your bar in bribery, and has charged him\r\nwith detaining his bribe. To this Mr. Hastings has answered, that he had\r\npaid him long ago. How they have settled that corrupt transaction I know\r\nnot. I merely state all this to prove that we have not dealt in fabulous\r\nhistory, and that, if anybody has dealt in falsehood, it is Mr.\r\nHastings's companion and associate in guilt, who must have known the\r\ncountry, and who, however faulty he was in other respects, had in this\r\ncase no interest whatever in misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nI might refer your Lordships, if it were necessary, to Scrafton's\r\naccount of that ancient government, in order to prove to you the happy\r\ncomparative state of that country, even under its former usurpers. Our\r\ndesign, my Lords, in making such references, is not merely to disprove\r\nthe prisoner's defence, but to vindicate the rights and privileges of\r\nthe people of India. We wish to reinstate them in your sympathy. We\r\nwish you to respect a people as respectable as yourselves,--a people who\r\nknow as well as you what is rank, what is law, what is property,--a\r\npeople who know how to feel disgrace, who know what equity, what reason,\r\nwhat proportion in punishments, what security of property is, just as\r\nwell as any of your Lordships; for these are things which are secured to\r\nthem by laws, by religion, by declarations of all their sovereigns. And\r\nwhat, my Lords, is opposed to all this? The practice of tyrants and\r\nusurpers, which Mr. Hastings takes for his rule and guidance. He\r\nendeavors to find deviations from legal government, and then instructs\r\nhis counsel to say that I have asserted there is no such thing as\r\narbitrary power in the East. Good God! if there was no such thing in any\r\nother part of the world, Mr. Hastings's conduct might have convinced me\r\nof the existence of arbitrary power, and have taught me much of its\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, we all know that there has been arbitrary power in\r\nIndia,--that tyrants have usurped it,--and that, in some instances,\r\nprinces otherwise meritorious have violated the liberties of the people,\r\nand have been lawfully deposed for such violation. I do not deny that\r\nthere are robberies on Hounslow Heath,--that there are such things as\r\nforgeries, burglaries, and murders; but I say that these acts are\r\nagainst law, and that whoever commit them commit illegal acts. When a\r\nman is to defend himself against a charge of crime, it is not instances\r\nof similar violation of law that is to be the standard of his defence. A\r\nman may as well say, \"I robbed upon Hounslow Heath, but hundreds robbed\r\nthere before me\": to which I answer, \"The law has forbidden you to rob\r\nthere; and I will hang you for having violated the law, notwithstanding\r\nthe long list of similar violations which you have produced as\r\nprecedents.\" No doubt princes have violated the law of this country:\r\nthey have suffered for it. Nobles have violated the law: their\r\nprivileges have not protected them from punishment. Common people have\r\nviolated the law: they have been hanged for it. I know no human being\r\nexempt from the law. The law is the security of the people of England;\r\nit is the security of the people of India; it is the security of every\r\nperson that is governed, and of every person that governs. There is but\r\none law for all, namely, that law which governs all law, the law of our\r\nCreator, the law of humanity, justice, equity,--the Law of Nature and of\r\nNations. So far as any laws fortify this primeval law, and give it more\r\nprecision, more energy, more effect by their declarations, such laws\r\nenter into the sanctuary, and participate in the sacredness of its\r\ncharacter. But the man who quotes as precedents the abuses of tyrants\r\nand robbers pollutes the very fountain of justice, destroys the\r\nfoundations of all law, and thereby removes the only safeguard against\r\nevil men, whether governors or governed,--the guard which prevents\r\ngovernors from becoming tyrants, and the governed from becoming rebels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hope your Lordships will not think that I have unnecessarily occupied\r\nyour time in disproving the plea of arbitrary power, which has been\r\nbrought forward at our bar, has been repeated at your Lordships' bar,\r\nand has been put upon the records of both Houses. I hope your Lordships\r\nwill not think that such monstrous doctrine should be passed over,\r\nwithout all possible pains being taken to demonstrate its falsehood and\r\nto reprobate its tendency. I have not spared myself in exposing the\r\nprinciples avowed by the prisoner. At another time I will endeavor to\r\nshow you the manner in which he acted upon these principles. I cannot\r\ncommand strength to proceed further at present; and you, my Lords,\r\ncannot give me greater bodily strength than I have.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[95] Institutes of Timour, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[96] Hedaya, Vol. II. p. 34.\r\n\r\n[97] Hedaya, Vol. II. pp. 247, 248.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY: FRIDAY, MAY 30, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy lords,--On the last day of the sitting of this court, when I had the\r\nhonor of appearing before you by the order of my fellow Managers, I\r\nstated to you their observations and my own upon two great points: one\r\nthe demeanor of the prisoner at the bar during his trial, and the other\r\nthe principles of his defence. I compared that demeanor with the\r\nbehavior of some of the greatest men in this kingdom, who have, on\r\naccount of their offences, been brought to your bar, and who have seldom\r\nescaped your Lordships' justice. I put the decency, humility, and\r\npropriety of the most distinguished men's behavior in contrast with the\r\nshameless effrontery of this prisoner, who has presumptuously made a\r\nrecriminatory charge against the House of Commons, and answered their\r\nimpeachment by a counter impeachment, explicitly accusing them of\r\nmalice, oppression, and the blackest ingratitude.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I next stated that this recriminatory charge consisted of two\r\ndistinct parts,--injustice and delay. To the injustice we are to answer\r\nby the nature and proof of the charges which we have brought before you;\r\nand to the delay, my Lords, we have answered in another place. Into one\r\nof the consequences of the delay, the ruinous expense which the\r\nprisoner complains of, we have desired your Lordships to make an\r\ninquiry, and have referred you to facts and witnesses which will remove\r\nthis part of the charge.\r\n\r\nWith regard to ingratitude, there will be a proper time for\r\nanimadversion on this charge. For in considering the merits that are\r\nintended to be set off against his crimes, we shall have to examine into\r\nthe nature of those merits, and to ascertain how far they are to\r\noperate, either as the prisoner designs they shall operate in his favor,\r\nas presumptive proofs that a man of such merits could not be guilty of\r\nsuch crimes, or as a sort of set-off to be pleaded in mitigation of his\r\noffences. In both of these lights we shall consider his services, and in\r\nthis consideration we shall determine the justice of his charge of\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have brought the demeanor of the prisoner before you for\r\nanother reason. We are desirous that your Lordships may be enabled to\r\nestimate, from the proud presumption and audacity of the criminal at\r\nyour bar, when he stands before the most awful tribunal in the world,\r\naccused by a body representing no less than the sacred voice of his\r\ncountry, what he must have been when placed in the seat of pride and\r\npower. What must have been the insolence of that man towards the natives\r\nof India, who, when called here to answer for enormous crimes, presumes\r\nto behave, not with the firmness of innocence, but with the audacity and\r\nhardness of guilt!\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary that I should recall to your Lordships' recollection\r\nthe principles of the accusation and of the defence. Your Lordships will\r\nbear in mind that the matters of fact are all either settled by\r\nconfession or conviction, and that the question now before you is no\r\nlonger an issue of fact, but an issue of law. The question is, what\r\ndegree of merit or demerit you are to assign by law to actions which\r\nhave been laid before you, and their truth acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe principle being established that you are to decide upon an issue at\r\nlaw, we examined by what law the prisoner ought to be tried; and we\r\npreferred a claim which we do now solemnly prefer, and which we trust\r\nyour Lordships will concur with us in a laudable emulation to\r\nestablish,--a claim founded upon the great truths, that all power is\r\nlimited by law, and ought to be guided by discretion, and not by\r\narbitrary will,--that all discretion must be referred to the\r\nconservation and benefit of those over whom power is exercised, and\r\ntherefore must be guided by rules of sound political morality.\r\n\r\nWe next contended, that, wherever existing laws were applicable, the\r\nprisoner at your bar was bound by the laws and statutes of this kingdom,\r\nas a British subject; and that, whenever he exercised authority in the\r\nname of the Company, or in the name of his Majesty, or under any other\r\nname, he was bound by the laws and statutes of this kingdom, both in\r\nletter and spirit, so far as they were applicable to him and to his\r\ncase; and above all, that he was bound by the act to which he owed his\r\nappointment, in all transactions with foreign powers, to act according\r\nto the known recognized rules of the Law of Nations, whether these\r\npowers were really or nominally sovereign, whether they were dependent\r\nor independent.\r\n\r\nThe next point which we established, and which we now call to your\r\nLordships' recollection, is, that he was bound to proceed according to\r\nthe laws, rights, laudable customs, privileges, and franchises of the\r\ncountry that he governed; and we contended that to such laws, rights,\r\nprivileges, and franchises the people of the country had a clear and\r\njust claim.\r\n\r\nHaving established these points as the basis of Mr. Hastings's general\r\npower, we contended that he was obliged by the nature of his relation,\r\nas a servant to the Company, to be obedient to their orders at all\r\ntimes, and particularly where he had entered into special covenants\r\nregarding special articles of obedience.\r\n\r\nThese are the principles by which we have examined the conduct of this\r\nman, and upon which we have brought him to your Lordships' bar for\r\njudgment. This is our table of the law. Your Lordships shall now be\r\nshown the table by which he claims to be judged. But I will first beg\r\nyour Lordships to take notice of the utter contempt with which he treats\r\nall our acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the absolute sovereignty which he would have you believe is\r\nexercised by the princes of India, he says, \"The sovereignty which they\r\nassumed it fell to my lot, very unexpectedly, to exert; and whether or\r\nnot such power, or powers of that nature, were delegated to me by any\r\nprovisions of any act of Parliament I confess myself too little of a\r\nlawyer to pronounce,\" and so on. This is the manner in which he treats\r\nan act of Parliament! In the place of acts of Parliament he substitutes\r\nhis own arbitrary will. This he contends is the sole law of the country\r\nhe governed, as laid down in what he calls the arbitrary Institutes of\r\nGenghis Khân and Tamerlane. This arbitrary will he claims, to the\r\nexclusion of the Gentoo law, the Mahometan law, and the law of his own\r\ncountry. He claims the right of making his own will the sole rule of his\r\ngovernment, and justifies the exercise of this power by the examples of\r\nAliverdy Khân, Cossim Ali Khân, Sujah Dowlah Khân, and all those Khâns\r\nwho have rebelled against their masters, and desolated the countries\r\nsubjected to their rule. This, my Lords, is the law which he has laid\r\ndown for himself, and these are the examples which he has expressly told\r\nthe House of Commons he is resolved to follow. These examples, my Lords,\r\nand the principles with which they are connected, without any softening\r\nor mitigation, he has prescribed to you as the rule by which his conduct\r\nis to be judged.\r\n\r\nAnother principle of the prisoner is, that, whenever the Company's\r\naffairs are in distress, even when that distress proceeds from his own\r\nprodigality, mismanagement, or corruption, he has a right to take for\r\nthe Company's benefit privately in his own name, with the future\r\napplication of it to their use reserved in his own breast, every kind of\r\nbribe or corrupt present whatever.\r\n\r\nI have now restated to your Lordships the maxims by which the prisoner\r\npersists in defending himself, and the principles upon which we claim to\r\nhave him judged. The issue before your Lordships is a hundred times more\r\nimportant than the cause itself, for it is to determine by what law or\r\nmaxims of law the conduct of governors is to be judged.\r\n\r\nOn one side, your Lordships have the prisoner declaring that the people\r\nhave no laws, no rights, no usages, no distinctions of rank, no sense of\r\nhonor, no property,--in short, that they are nothing but a herd of\r\nslaves, to be governed by the arbitrary will of a master. On the other\r\nside, we assert that the direct contrary of this is true. And to prove\r\nour assertion we have referred you to the Institutes of Genghis Khân and\r\nof Tamerlane; we have referred you to the Mahometan law, which is\r\nbinding upon all, from the crowned head to the meanest subject,--a law\r\ninterwoven with a system of the wisest, the most learned, and most\r\nenlightened jurisprudence that perhaps ever existed in the world. We\r\nhave shown you, that, if these parties are to be compared together, it\r\nis not the rights of the people which are nothing, but rather the rights\r\nof the sovereign which are so. The rights of the people are everything,\r\nas they ought to be, in the true and natural order of things. God forbid\r\nthat these maxims should trench upon sovereignty, and its true, just,\r\nand lawful prerogative!--on the contrary, they ought to support and\r\nestablish them. The sovereign's rights are undoubtedly sacred rights,\r\nand ought to be so held in every country in the world, because exercised\r\nfor the benefit of the people, and in subordination to that great end\r\nfor which alone God has vested power in any man or any set of men. This\r\nis the law that we insist upon, and these are the principles upon which\r\nyour Lordships are to try the prisoner at your bar.\r\n\r\nLet me remind your Lordships that these people lived under the laws to\r\nwhich I have referred you, and that these laws were formed whilst we, I\r\nmay say, were in the forest, certainly before we knew what technical\r\njurisprudence was. These laws are allowed to be the basis and substratum\r\nof the manners, customs, and opinions of the people of India; and we\r\ncontend that Mr. Hastings is bound to know them and to act by them; and\r\nI shall prove that the very condition upon which he received power in\r\nIndia was to protect the people in their laws and known rights. But\r\nwhether Mr. Hastings did know these laws, or whether, content with\r\ncredit gained by as base a fraud as was ever practised, he did not read\r\nthe books which Nobkissin paid for, we take the benefit of them: we know\r\nand speak after knowledge of them. And although I believe his Council\r\nhave never read them, I should be sorry to stand in this place, if there\r\nwas one word and tittle in these books that I had not read over.\r\n\r\nWe therefore come here and declare to you that he is not borne out by\r\nthese Institutes, either in their general spirit or in any particular\r\npassage to which he has had the impudence to appeal, in the assumption\r\nof the arbitrary power which he has exercised. We claim, that, as our\r\nown government and every person exercising authority in Great Britain is\r\nbound by the laws of Great Britain, so every person exercising authority\r\nin another country shall be subject to the laws of that country; since\r\notherwise they break the very covenant by which we hold our power there.\r\nEven if these Institutes had been arbitrary, which they are not, they\r\nmight have been excused as the acts of conquerors. But, my Lords, he is\r\nno conqueror, nor anything but what you see him,--a bad scribbler of\r\nabsurd papers, in which he can put no two sentences together without\r\ncontradiction. We know him in no other character than that of having\r\nbeen a bullock-contractor for some years, of having acted fraudulently\r\nin that capacity, and afterwards giving fraudulent contracts to others;\r\nand yet I will maintain that the first conquerors of the world would\r\nhave been base and abandoned, if they had assumed such a right as he\r\ndares to claim. It is the glory of all such great men to have for their\r\nmotto, _Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos_. These were men that\r\nsaid they would recompense the countries which they had obtained through\r\ntorrents of blood, through carnage and violence, by the justice of their\r\ninstitutions, the mildness of their laws, and the equity of their\r\ngovernment. Even if these conquerors had promulgated arbitrary\r\ninstitutes instead of disclaiming them in every point, you, my Lords,\r\nwould never suffer such principles of defence to be urged here; still\r\nless will you suffer the examples of men acting by violence, of men\r\nacting by wrong, the example of a man who has become a rebel to his\r\nsovereign in order that he should become the tyrant of his people, to be\r\nexamples for a British governor, or for any governor. We here\r\nconfidently protest against this mode of justification, and we maintain\r\nthat his pretending to follow these examples is in itself a crime. The\r\nprisoner has ransacked all Asia for principles of despotism; he has\r\nransacked all the bad and corrupted part of it for tyrannical examples\r\nto justify himself: and certainly in no other way can he be justified.\r\n\r\nHaving established the falsehood of the first principle of the\r\nprisoner's defence, that sovereignty, wherever it exists in India,\r\nimplies in its nature and essence a power of exacting anything from the\r\nsubject, and disposing of his person and property, we now come to his\r\nsecond assertion, that he was the true, full, and perfect representative\r\nof that sovereignty in India.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this assertion we first do positively deny that he or\r\nthe Company are the perfect representative of any sovereign power\r\nwhatever. They have certain rights by their charter, and by acts of\r\nParliament, but they have no other. They have their legal rights only,\r\nand these do not imply any such thing as sovereign power. The\r\nsovereignty of Great Britain is in the King; he is the sovereign of the\r\nLords and the sovereign of the Commons, individually and collectively;\r\nand as he has his prerogative established by law, he must exercise it,\r\nand all persons claiming and deriving under him, whether by act of\r\nParliament, whether by charter of the Crown, or by any other mode\r\nwhatever, all are alike bound by law, and responsible to it. No one can\r\nassume or receive any power of sovereignty, because the sovereignty is\r\nin the Crown, and cannot be delegated away from the Crown; no such\r\ndelegation ever took place, or ever was intended, as any one may see in\r\nthe act by which Mr. Hastings was nominated Governor. He cannot,\r\ntherefore, exercise that high supreme sovereignty which is vested by the\r\nlaw, with the consent of both Houses of Parliament, in the King, and in\r\nthe King only. It is a violent, rebellious assumption of power, when Mr.\r\nHastings pretends fully, perfectly, and entirely to represent the\r\nsovereign of this country, and to exercise legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial authority, with as large and broad a sway as his Majesty,\r\nacting with the consent of the two Houses of Parliament, and agreeably\r\nto the laws of this kingdom. I say, my Lords, this is a traitorous and\r\nrebellious assumption, which he has no right to make, and which we\r\ncharge against him, and therefore it cannot be urged in justification of\r\nhis conduct in any respect.\r\n\r\nHe next alleges, with reference to one particular case, that he received\r\nthis sovereignty from the Vizier Sujah Dowlah, who he pretends was\r\nsovereign, with an unlimited power over the life, goods, and property of\r\nCheyt Sing. This we positively deny. Whatever power the supreme\r\nsovereign of the empire had, we deny that it was delegated to Sujah\r\nDowlah. He never was in possession of it. He was a vizier of the empire;\r\nhe had a grant of certain lands for the support of that dignity: and we\r\nrefer you to the Institutes of Timour, to the Institutes of Akbar, to\r\nthe institutes of the Mahometan law, for the powers of delegated\r\ngovernors and viceroys. You will find that there is not a trace of\r\nsovereignty in them, but that they are, to all intents and purposes,\r\nmere subjects; and consequently, as Sujah Dowlah had not these powers,\r\nhe could not transfer them to the India Company. His master, the Mogul\r\nemperor, had them not. I defy any man to show an instance of that\r\nemperor's claiming any such thing as arbitrary power; much less can it\r\nbe claimed by a rebellious viceroy who had broken loose from his\r\nsovereign's authority, just as this man broke loose from the authority\r\nof Parliament. The one had not a right to give, nor the other to receive\r\nsuch powers. But whatever rights were vested in the Mogul, they cannot\r\nbelong either to Sujah Dowlah, to Mr. Hastings, or to the Company. These\r\nlatter are expressly bound by their compact to take care of the subjects\r\nof the empire, and to govern them according to law, reason, and equity;\r\nand when they do otherwise, they are guilty of tyranny, of a violation\r\nof the rights of the people, and of rebellion against their sovereign.\r\n\r\nWe have taken these pains to ascertain and fix principles, because your\r\nLordships are not called upon to judge of facts. A jury may find facts,\r\nbut no jury can form a judgment of law; it is an application of the law\r\nto the fact that makes the act criminal or laudable. You must find a\r\nfixed standard of some kind or other; for if there is no standard but\r\nthe immediate momentary purpose of the day, guided and governed by the\r\nman who uses it, fixed not only for the disposition of all the wealth\r\nand strength of the state, but for the life, fortune, and property of\r\nevery individual, your Lordships are left without a principle to direct\r\nyour judgment. This high court, this supreme court of appeal from all\r\nthe courts of the kingdom, this highest court of criminal jurisdiction,\r\nexercised upon the requisition of the House of Commons, if left without\r\na rule, would be as lawless as the wild savage, and as unprincipled as\r\nthe prisoner that stands at your bar. Our whole issue is upon\r\nprinciples, and what I shall say to you will be in perpetual reference\r\nto them; because it is better to have no principles at all than to have\r\nfalse principles of government and of morality. Leave a man to his\r\npassions, and you leave a wild beast to a savage and capricious nature.\r\nA wild beast, indeed, when its stomach is full, will caress you, and may\r\nlick your hands; in like manner, when a tyrant is pleased or his passion\r\nsatiated, you may have a happy and serene day under an arbitrary\r\ngovernment. But when the principle founded on solid reason, which ought\r\nto restrain passion, is perverted from its proper end, the false\r\nprinciple will be substituted for it, and then man becomes ten times\r\nworse than a wild beast. The evil principle, grown solid and perennial,\r\ngoads him on and takes entire possession of his mind; and then perhaps\r\nthe best refuge that you can have from that diabolical principle is in\r\nthe natural wild passions and unbridled appetites of mankind. This is a\r\ndreadful state of things; and therefore we have thought it necessary to\r\nsay a great deal upon his principles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we come next to apply these principles to facts which cannot\r\notherwise be judged, as we have contended and do now contend. I will not\r\ngo over facts which have been opened to you by my fellow Managers: if I\r\ndid so, I should appear to have a distrust, which I am sure no other man\r\nhas, of the greatest abilities displayed in the greatest of all causes.\r\nI should be guilty of a presumption which I hope I shall not dream of,\r\nbut leave to those who exercise arbitrary power, in supposing that I\r\ncould go over the ground which my fellow Managers have once trodden, and\r\nmake anything more clear and forcible than they have done. In my humble\r\nopinion, human ability cannot go farther than they have gone; and if I\r\never allude to anything which they have already touched, it will be to\r\nshow it in another light,--to mark more particularly its departure from\r\nthe principles upon which we contend you ought to judge, or to supply\r\nthose parts which through bodily infirmity, and I am sure nothing else,\r\none of my excellent fellow Managers has left untouched. I am here\r\nalluding to the case of Cheyt Sing.\r\n\r\nMy honorable fellow Manager, Mr. Grey, has stated to you all the\r\ncircumstances requisite to prove two things: first, that the demands\r\nmade by Mr. Hastings upon Cheyt Sing were contrary to fundamental\r\ntreaties between the Company and that Rajah; and next, that they were\r\nthe result and effect of private malice and corruption. This having\r\nbeen stated and proved to you, I shall take up the subject where it was\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in the first place, I have to remark to you, that the whole of\r\nthe charge originally brought by Mr. Hastings against Cheyt Sing, in\r\njustification of his wicked and tyrannical proceedings, is, that he had\r\nbeen dilatory, evasive, shuffling, and unwilling to pay that which,\r\nhowever unwilling, evasive, and shuffling, he did pay; and that, with\r\nregard to the business of furnishing cavalry, the Rajah has asserted,\r\nand his assertion has not been denied, that, when he was desired by the\r\nCouncil to furnish these troopers, the purpose for which this\r\napplication was made was not mentioned or alluded to, nor was there any\r\nplace of muster pointed out. We therefore contended, that the demand was\r\nnot made for the service of the state, but for the oppression of the\r\nindividual that suffered by it.\r\n\r\nBut admitting the Rajah to have been guilty of delay and unwillingness,\r\nwhat is the nature of the offence? If you strip it of the epithets by\r\nwhich it has been disguised, it merely amounts to an unwillingness in\r\nthe Rajah to pay more than the sums stipulated by the mutual agreement\r\nexisting between him and the Company. This is the whole of it, the whole\r\nfront and head of the offence; and for this offence, such as it is, and\r\nadmitting that he could be legally fined for it, he was subjected to the\r\nsecret punishment of giving a bribe to Mr. Hastings, by which he was to\r\nbuy off the fine, and which was consequently a commutation for it.\r\n\r\nThat your Lordships may be enabled to judge more fully of the nature of\r\nthis offence, let us see in what relation Cheyt Sing stood with the\r\nCompany. He was, my Lords, a person clothed with every one of the\r\nattributes of sovereignty, under a direct stipulation that the Company\r\nshould not interfere in his internal government. The military and civil\r\nauthority, the power of life and death, the whole revenue, and the whole\r\nadministration of the law, rested in him. Such was the sovereignty he\r\npossessed within Benares: but he was a subordinate sovereign dependent\r\nupon a superior, according to the tenor of his compact, expressed or\r\nimplied. Now, having contended, as we still contend, that the Law of\r\nNations is the law of India as well as of Europe, because it is the law\r\nof reason and the law of Nature, drawn from the pure sources of\r\nmorality, of public good, and of natural equity, and recognized and\r\ndigested into order by the labor of learned men, I will refer your\r\nLordships to Vattel, Book I. Cap. 16, where he treats of the breach of\r\nsuch agreements, by the protector refusing to give protection, or the\r\nprotected refusing to perform his part of the engagement. My design in\r\nreferring you to this author is to prove that Cheyt Sing, so far from\r\nbeing blamable in raising objections to the unauthorized demand made\r\nupon him by Mr. Hastings, was absolutely bound to do so; nor could he\r\nhave done otherwise, without hazarding the whole benefit of the\r\nagreement upon which his subjection and protection were founded. The law\r\nis the same with respect to both contracting parties: if the protected\r\nor protector does not fulfil with fidelity _each his separate\r\nstipulation_, the protected may resist the unauthorized demand of the\r\nprotector, or the protector is discharged from his engagement; he may\r\nrefuse protection, and declare the treaty broken.\r\n\r\nWe contend in favor of Cheyt Sing, in support of the principles of\r\nnatural equity, and of the Law of Nations, which is the birthright of us\r\nall,--we contend, I say, that Cheyt Sing would have established, in the\r\nopinions of the best writers on the Law of Nations, a precedent against\r\nhimself for any future violation of the engagement, if he submitted to\r\nany new demand, without what our laws call a continual claim or\r\nperpetual remonstrance against the imposition. Instead, therefore, of\r\ndoing that which was criminal, he did that which his safety and his duty\r\nbound him to do; and for doing this he was considered by Mr. Hastings as\r\nbeing guilty of a great crime. In a paper which was published by the\r\nprisoner in justification of this act, he considers the Rajah to have\r\nbeen guilty of rebellious intentions; and he represents these acts of\r\ncontumacy, as he calls them, not as proofs of contumacy merely, but as\r\nproofs of a settled design to rebel, and to throw off the authority of\r\nthat nation by which he was protected. This belief he declares on oath\r\nto be the ground of his conduct towards Cheyt Sing.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, we do contend, that, if any subject, under any name, or\r\nof any description, be not engaged in public, open rebellion, but\r\ncontinues to acknowledge the authority of his sovereign, and, if\r\ntributary, to pay tribute conformably to agreement, such a subject, in\r\ncase of being suspected of having formed traitorous designs, ought to be\r\ntreated in a manner totally different from that which was adopted by Mr.\r\nHastings. If the Rajah of Benares had formed a secret conspiracy, Mr.\r\nHastings had a state duty and a judicial duty to perform. He was bound,\r\nas Governor, knowing of such a conspiracy, to provide for the public\r\nsafety; and as a judge, he was bound to convene a criminal court, and to\r\nlay before it a detailed accusation of the offence. He was bound to\r\nproceed publicly and legally against the accused, and to convict him of\r\nhis crime, previous to his inflicting, or forming any intention of\r\ninflicting, punishment. I say, my Lords, that Mr. Hastings, as a\r\nmagistrate, was bound to proceed against the Rajah either by English\r\nlaw, by Mahometan law, or by the Gentoo law; and that, by all or any of\r\nthese laws, he was bound to make the accused acquainted with the crime\r\nalleged, to hear his answer to the charge, and to produce evidence\r\nagainst him, in an open, clear, and judicial manner. And here, my Lords,\r\nwe have again to remark, that the Mahometan law is a great discriminator\r\nof persons, and that it prescribes the mode of proceeding against those\r\nwho are accused of any delinquency requiring punishment, with a\r\nreference to the distinction and rank which the accused held in society.\r\nThe proceedings are exceedingly sober, regular, and respectful, even to\r\ncriminals charged with the highest crimes; and every magistrate is\r\nrequired to exercise his office in the prescribed manner. In the Hedaya,\r\nafter declaring and discussing the propriety of the Kâzi's sitting\r\nopenly in the execution of his office, it is added, that there is no\r\nimpropriety in the Kâzi sitting in his own house to pass judgment, but\r\nit is requisite that he give orders for a free access to the people. It\r\nthen proceeds thus:--\"It is requisite that such people sit along with\r\nthe Kâzi as were used to sit with him, prior to his appointment to the\r\noffice; because, if he were to sit alone in his house, he would thereby\r\ngive rise to suspicion.\"[98]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, having thus seen what the duty of a judge is in such a case,\r\nlet us examine whether Mr. Hastings observed any part of the prescribed\r\nrules. First, with regard to the publicity of the matter. Did he ever\r\ngive any notice to the Supreme Council of the charges which he says he\r\nhad received against Cheyt Sing? Did he accuse the Rajah in the Council,\r\neven when it was reduced to himself and his poor, worn, down, cowed, and\r\nI am afraid bribed colleague, Mr. Wheler? Did he even then, I ask,\r\nproduce any one charge against this man? He sat in Council as a\r\njudge,--as an English judge,--as a Mahometan judge,--as a judge by the\r\nGentoo law, and by the Law of Nature. He should have summoned the party\r\nto appear in person, or by his attorney, before him, and should have\r\nthere informed him of the charge against him. But, my Lords, he did not\r\nact thus. He kept the accusation secret in his own bosom. And why?\r\nBecause he did not believe it to be true. This may at least be inferred\r\nfrom his having never informed the Council of the matter. He never\r\ninformed the Rajah of Benares of the suspicions entertained against him,\r\nduring the discussions which took place respecting the multiplied\r\ndemands that were made upon him. He never told this victim, as he has\r\nhad the audacity to tell us and all this kingdom in the paper that is\r\nbefore your Lordships, that he looked upon these refusals to comply with\r\nhis demands to be overt acts of rebellion; nor did he ever call upon him\r\nto answer or to justify himself with regard to that imputed conspiracy\r\nor rebellion. Did he tell Sadanund, the Rajah's agent, when that agent\r\nwas giving him a bribe or a present in secret, and was thus endeavoring\r\nto deprecate his wrath, that he accepted that bribe because his master\r\nwas in rebellion? Never, my Lords; nor did he, when he first reached\r\nBenares, and had the Rajah in his power, suggest one word concerning\r\nthis rebellion. Did he, when he met Mr. Markham at Boglipore, where they\r\nconsulted about the destruction of this unhappy man, did he tell Mr.\r\nMarkham, or did Mr. Markham insinuate to him, any one thing about this\r\nconspiracy and rebellion? No, not a word there, or in his whole progress\r\nup the country. While at Boglipore, he wrote a letter to Lord Macartney\r\nupon the state of the empire, giving him much and various advice. Did he\r\ninsinuate in that letter that he was going up to Benares to suppress a\r\nrebellion of the Rajah Cheyt Sing or to punish him? No, not a word. Did\r\nhe, my Lords, at the eve of his departure from Calcutta, when he\r\ncommunicated his intention of taking 500,000_l._, which he calls a fine\r\nor penalty, from the Rajah, did he inform Mr. Wheler of it? No, not a\r\nword of his rebellion, nor anything like it. Did he inform his secret\r\nconfidants, Mr. Anderson and Major Palmer, upon that subject? Not a\r\nword, there was not a word dropped from him of any such rebellion, or of\r\nany intention in the Rajah Cheyt Sing to rebel. Did he, when he had\r\nvakeels in every part of the Mahratta empire and in the country of Sujah\r\nDowlah, when he had in most of those courts English ambassadors and\r\nnative spies, did he either from ambassadors or spies receive anything\r\nlike authentic intelligence upon this subject? While he was at Benares,\r\nhe had in his hands Benaram Pundit, the vakeel of the Rajah of Berar,\r\nhis own confidential friend, a person whom he took out of the service of\r\nhis master, and to whom he gave a jaghire in this very zemindary of\r\nBenares. This man, so attached to Mr. Hastings, so knowing in all the\r\ntransactions of India, neither accused Cheyt Sing of rebellious\r\nintentions, or furnished Mr. Hastings with one single proof that any\r\nconspiracy with any foreign power existed.\r\n\r\nIn this absence of evidence, My Lords, let us have recourse to\r\nprobability. Is it to be believed that the Zemindar of Benares, a person\r\nwhom Mr. Hastings describes as being of a timid, weak, irresolute, and\r\nfeeble nature, should venture to make war alone with the whole power of\r\nthe Company in India, aided by all the powers which Great Britain could\r\nbring to the protection of its Indian empire? Could that poor man, in\r\nhis comparatively small district, possibly have formed such an\r\nintention, without giving Mr. Hastings access to the knowledge of the\r\nfact from one or other of the numerous correspondents which he had in\r\nthat country?\r\n\r\nAs to the Rajah's supposed intrigues with the Nabob of Oude: this man\r\nwas an actual prisoner of Mr. Hastings, and nothing else,--a mere\r\nvassal, as he says himself, in effect and substance, though not in name.\r\nCan any one believe or think that Mr. Hastings would not have received\r\nfrom the English Resident, or from some one of that tribe of English\r\ngentlemen and English military collectors who were placed in that\r\ncountry in the exercise of the most arbitrary powers, some intelligence\r\nwhich he could trust, if any rebellious designs had really existed\r\nprevious to the rebellion which did actually break out upon his\r\narresting Cheyt Sing?\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient Roman lawyer, of great fame in the history of Roman\r\njurisprudence, whom they called _Cui Bono_, from his having first\r\nintroduced into juridical proceedings the argument, _What end or object\r\ncould the party have had in the art with which he is accused?_ Surely it\r\nmay be here asked, Why should Cheyt Sing wish to rebel, who held on easy\r\nand moderate terms (for such I admit they were) a very considerable\r\nterritory, with every attribute of royalty attached? The tribute was\r\npaid for protection, which he had a right to claim, and which he\r\nactually received. What reason under heaven could he have to go and seek\r\nanother master, to place himself under the protection of Sujah Dowlah,\r\nin whose hands Mr. Hastings tells you, in so many direct and plain\r\nwords, that neither the Rajah's property, his honor, or his life could\r\nbe safe? Was he to seek refuge with the Mahrattas, who, though Gentoos\r\nlike himself, had reduced every nation which they subdued, except those\r\nwho were originally of their own empire, to a severe servitude? Can any\r\none believe that he wished either for the one or the other of these\r\ncharges [changes?], or that he was desirous to quit the happy\r\nindependent situation in which he stood under the protection of the\r\nBritish empire, from any loose, wild, improbable notion of mending his\r\ncondition? My Lords, it is impossible. There is not one particle of\r\nevidence, not one word of this charge on record, prior to the\r\npublication of Mr. Hastings's Narrative; and all the presumptive\r\nevidence in the world would scarcely be sufficient to prove the fact,\r\nbecause it is almost impossible that it should be true.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, although Mr. Hastings swore to the truth of this charge,\r\nwhen he came before the House of Commons, yet in his Narrative he thus\r\nfairly and candidly avowed that he entertained no such opinion at the\r\ntime. \"Every step,\" says he, \"which I had taken before that fatal\r\nmoment, namely, the flight of Cheyt Sing, is an incontrovertible proof\r\nthat I had formed no design of seizing upon the Rajah's treasures or of\r\ndeposing him. And certainly, at the time when I did form the design of\r\nmaking the punishment that his former ill conduct deserved subservient\r\nto the exigencies of the state by a large fine, I did not believe him\r\nguilty of that premeditated project for driving the English out of India\r\nwith which I afterwards charged him.\" Thus, then, he declares upon oath\r\nthat the Rajah's contumacy was the ground of his suspecting him of\r\nrebellion, and yet, when he comes to make his defence before the House\r\nof Commons, he simply and candidly declares, that, long after these\r\nalleged acts of contumacy had taken place, he did not believe him to be\r\nguilty of any such thing as rebellion, and that the fine imposed upon\r\nhim was for another reason and another purpose.\r\n\r\nIn page 28 of your printed Minutes he thus declares the purpose for\r\nwhich the fine was imposed:--\"I can answer only to this formidable\r\ndilemma, that, so long as I conceived Cheyt Sing's misconduct and\r\ncontumacy to have me rather than the Company for its object, at least to\r\nbe merely the effect of pernicious advice or misguided folly, without\r\nany formal design of openly resisting our authority or disclaiming our\r\nsovereignty, I looked upon a considerable fine as sufficient both for\r\nhis immediate punishment and for binding him to future good behavior.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, the secret comes out. He declares it was not for a\r\nrebellion or a suspicion of rebellion that he resolved, over and above\r\nall his exorbitant demands, to take from the Rajah 500,000_l._, (a good\r\nstout sum to be taken from a tributary power!)--that it was not for\r\nmisconduct of this kind that he took this sum, but for personal ill\r\nbehavior towards himself. I must again beg your Lordships to note that\r\nhe then considered the Rajah's contumacy as having for its object, not\r\nthe Company, but Warren Hastings, and that he afterwards declared\r\npublicly to the House of Commons, and now before your Lordships he\r\ndeclares finally and conclusively, that he did believe Cheyt Sing to\r\nhave had the criminal intention imputed to him.\r\n\r\n\"So long,\" says he, \"as I conceived Cheyt Sing's misconduct and\r\ncontumacy to have _me_\" (in Italics, as he ordered it to be printed,)\r\n\"rather than the Company, for its object, so long I was satisfied with a\r\nfine: I therefore entertained no serious thoughts of expelling him, or\r\nproceeding otherwise to violence. But when he and his people broke out\r\ninto the most atrocious acts of rebellion and murder, when the _jus\r\nfortioris et lex ultima regum_ were appealed to on his part, and without\r\nany sufficient plea afforded him on mine, I from that moment considered\r\nhim as the traitor and criminal described in the charge, and no\r\nconcessions, no humiliations, could ever after induce me to settle on\r\nhim the zemindary of Benares, or any other territory, upon any footing\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nThus, then, my Lords, he has confessed that the era and the only era of\r\nrebellion was when the tumult broke out upon the act of violence offered\r\nby himself to Cheyt Sing; and upon the ground of that tumult, or\r\nrebellion as he calls it, he says he never would suffer him to enjoy any\r\nterritory or any right whatever. We have fixed the period of the\r\nrebellion for which he is supposed to have exacted this fine; this\r\nperiod of rebellion was after the exaction of the fine itself: so that\r\nthe fine was not laid for the rebellion, but the rebellion broke out in\r\nconsequence of the fine, and the violent measure accompanying it. We\r\nhave established this, and the whole human race cannot shake it. He went\r\nup the country through malice, to revenge his own private wrongs, not\r\nthose of the Company. He fixed 500,000_l._ as a mulct for an insult\r\noffered to himself, and then a rebellion broke out in consequence of his\r\nviolence. This was the rebellion, and the only rebellion; it was Warren\r\nHastings's rebellion,--a rebellion which arose from his own dreadful\r\nexaction, from his pride, from his malice and insatiable avarice,--a\r\nrebellion which arose from his abominable tyranny, from his lust of\r\narbitrary power, and from his determination to follow the examples of\r\nSujah Dowlah, Asoph ul Dowlah, Cossim Ali Khân, Aliverdy Khân, and all\r\nthe gang of rebels who are the objects of his imitation.\r\n\r\n\"_My patience_,\" says he, \"_was exhausted_.\" Your Lordships have, and\r\nought to have, a judicial patience. Mr. Hastings has none of any kind. I\r\nhold that patience is one of the great virtues of a governor; it was\r\nsaid of Moses, that he governed by patience, and that he was the meekest\r\nman upon earth. Patience is also the distinguishing character of a\r\njudge; and I think your Lordships, both with regard to us and with\r\nregard to him, have shown a great deal of it: we shall ever honor the\r\nquality, and if we pretend to say that we have had great patience in\r\ngoing through this trial, so your Lordships must have had great patience\r\nin hearing it. But this man's patience, as he himself tells you, was\r\nsoon exhausted. \"I considered,\" he says, \"the light in which such\r\nbehavior would have been viewed by his native sovereign, and I resolved\r\nhe should feel the power he had so long insulted. Forty or fifty lacs of\r\nrupees would have been a moderate fine for Sujah ul Dowlah to exact,--he\r\nwho had demanded twenty-five lacs for the mere fine of succession, and\r\nreceived twenty in hand, and an increased rent tantamount to\r\nconsiderably above thirty lacs more; and therefore I rejected the offer\r\nof twenty, with which the Rajah would have compromised for his guilt\r\nwhen it was too late.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, observe who his models were, when he intended to punish\r\nthis man for an insult on himself. Did he consult the laws? Did he look\r\nto the Institutes of Timour, or to those of Genghis Khân? Did he look to\r\nthe Hedaya, or to any of the approved authorities in this country? No,\r\nmy Lords, he exactly followed the advice which Longinus gives to a great\r\nwriter:--\"Whenever you have a mind to elevate your mind, to raise it to\r\nits highest pitch, and even to exceed yourself, upon any subject, think\r\nhow Homer would have described it, how Plato would have imagined it, and\r\nhow Demosthenes would have expressed it; and when you have so done, you\r\nwill then, no doubt, have a standard which will raise you up to the\r\ndignity of anything that human genius can aspire to.\" Mr. Hastings was\r\ncalling upon himself, and raising his mind to the dignity of what\r\ntyranny could do, what unrighteous exaction could perform. He\r\nconsidered, he says, how much Sujah Dowlah would have exacted, and that\r\nhe thinks would not be too much for him to exact. He boldly avows,--\"I\r\nraised my mind to the elevation of Sujah Dowlah; I considered what\r\nCossim Ali Khân would have done, or Aliverdy Khân, who murdered and\r\nrobbed so many, I had all this line of great examples before me, and I\r\nasked myself what fine they would have exacted upon such an occasion.\r\nBut,\" says he, \"Sujah Dowlah levied a fine of twenty lacs for a right of\r\nsuccession.\"\r\n\r\nGood God! my Lords, if you are not appalled with the violent injustice\r\nof arbitrary proceedings, you must feel something humiliating at the\r\ngross ignorance of men who are in this manner playing with the rights of\r\nmankind. This man confounds a fine upon succession with a fine of\r\npenalty. He takes advantage of a defect in the technical language of our\r\nlaw, which, I am sorry to say, is not, in many parts, as correct in its\r\ndistinctions and as wise in its provisions as the Mahometan law. We use\r\nthe word _fine_ in three senses: first, as a punishment and penalty;\r\nsecondly, as a formal means of cutting off by one form the ties of\r\nanother form, which we call levying a fine; and, thirdly, we use the\r\nword to signify a sum of money payable upon renewal of a lease or\r\ncopyhold. The word has in each case a totally different sense; but such\r\nis the stupidity and barbarism of the prisoner, that he confounds these\r\nsenses, and tells you Sujah Dowlah took twenty-five lacs as a fine from\r\nCheyt Sing for the renewal of his zemindary, and therefore, as a\r\npunishment for his offences, he shall take fifty. Suppose any one of\r\nyour Lordships, or of us, were to be fined for assault and battery, or\r\nfor anything else, and it should be said, \"You paid such a fine for a\r\nbishop's lease, you paid such a fine on the purchase of an estate, and\r\ntherefore, now that you are going to be fined for a punishment, we will\r\ntake the measure of the fine, not from the nature and quality of your\r\noffence, not from the law upon the subject, or from your ability to\r\npay, but the amount of a fine you paid some years ago for an estate\r\nshall be the measure of your punishment.\" My Lords, what should we say\r\nof such brutish ignorance, and such shocking confusion of ideas?\r\n\r\nWhen this man had elevated his mind according to the rules of art, and\r\nstimulated himself to great things by great examples, he goes on to tell\r\nyou that he rejected the offer of twenty lacs with which the Rajah would\r\nhave compounded for his guilt when it was too late.\r\n\r\nPermit me, my Lords, to say a few words here, by way of referring back\r\nall this monstrous heap of violence and absurdity to some degree of\r\nprinciple. Mr. Hastings having completely acquitted the Rajah of any\r\nother fault than contumacy, and having supposed even that to be only\r\npersonal to himself, he thought a fine of 500,000_l._ would be a proper\r\npunishment. Now, when any man goes to exact a fine, it presupposes\r\ninquiry, charge, defence, and judgment. It does so in the Mahometan law;\r\nit does so in the Gentoo law; it does so in the law of England, in the\r\nRoman law, and in the law, I believe, of every nation under heaven,\r\nexcept in that law which resides in the arbitrary breast of Mr.\r\nHastings, poisoned by the principles and stimulated by the examples of\r\nthose wicked traitors and rebels whom I have before described. He\r\nmentions his intention of levying a fine; but does he make any mention\r\nof having charged the Rajah with his offences? It appears that he held\r\nan incredible quantity of private correspondence through the various\r\nResidents, through Mr. Graham, Mr. Fowke, Mr. Markham, Mr. Benn,\r\nconcerning the affairs of that country. Did he ever, upon this alleged\r\ncontumacy, (for at present I put the rebellion out of the question,)\r\ninquire the progress of this personal affront offered to the\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal? Did he ever state it to the Rajah, or did he\r\ncall his vakeel before the Council to answer the charge? Did he examine\r\nany one person, or particularize a single fact, in any manner whatever?\r\nNo. What, then, did he do? Why, my Lords, he declared himself the person\r\ninjured, stood forward as the accuser, assumed the office of judge, and\r\nproceeded to judgment without a party before him, without trial, without\r\nexamination, without proof. He thus directly reversed the order of\r\njustice. He determined to fine the Rajah when his own patience, as he\r\nsays, was exhausted, not when justice demanded the punishment. He\r\nresolved to fine him in the enormous sum of 500,000_l._ Does he inform\r\nthe Council of this determination? No. The Court of Directors? No. Any\r\none of his confidants? No, not one of them,--not Mr. Palmer, not Mr.\r\nMiddleton, nor any of that legion of secretaries that he had; nor did he\r\neven inform Mr. Malcolm [Markham?] of his intentions, until he met him\r\nat Boglipore.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the object of his malice, we only know that many letters\r\ncame from Cheyt Sing to Mr. Hastings, in which the unfortunate man\r\nendeavored to appease his wrath, and to none of which he ever gave an\r\nanswer. He is an accuser preferring a charge and receiving apologies,\r\nwithout giving the party an answer, although he had a crowd of\r\nsecretaries about him, maintained at the expense of the miserable people\r\nof Benares, and paid by sums of money drawn fraudulently from their\r\npockets. Still not one word of answer was given, till he had formed the\r\nresolution of exacting a fine, and had actually by torture made his\r\nvictim's servant discover where his master's treasures lay, in order\r\nthat he might rob him of all his family possessed. Are these the\r\nproceedings of a British judge? or are they not rather such as are\r\ndescribed by Lord Coke (and these learned gentlemen, I dare say, will\r\nremember the passage; it is too striking not to be remembered) as _\"the\r\ndamned and damnable proceedings of a judge in hell_\"? Such a judge has\r\nthe prisoner at your bar proved himself to be. First he determines upon\r\nthe punishment, then he prepares the accusation, and then by torture and\r\nviolence endeavors to extort the fine.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must again beg leave to call your attention to his mode of\r\nproceeding in this business. He never entered any charge. He never\r\nanswered any letter. Not that he was idle. He was carrying on a wicked\r\nand clandestine plot for the destruction of the Rajah, under the\r\npretence of this fine; although the plot was not known, I verily\r\nbelieve, to any European at the time. He does not pretend that he told\r\nany one of the Company's servants of his intentions of fining the Rajah;\r\nbut that some hostile project against him had been formed by Mr.\r\nHastings was perfectly well known to the natives. Mr. Hastings tells\r\nyou, that Cheyt Sing had a vakeel at Calcutta, whose business it was to\r\nlearn the general transactions of our government, and the most minute\r\nparticulars which could in any manner affect the interest of his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nI must here tell your Lordships, that there is no court in Asia, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest, no petty sovereign, that does not both employ\r\nand receive what they call _hircarrahs_, or, in other words, persons to\r\ncollect and to communicate political intelligence. These men are\r\nreceived with the state and in the rank of ambassadors; they have their\r\nplace in the durbar; and their business, as authorized spies, is as well\r\nknown there as that of ambassadors extraordinary and ordinary in the\r\ncourts of Europe. Mr. Hastings had a public spy, in the person of the\r\nResident, at Benares, and he had a private spy there in another person.\r\nThe spies employed by the native powers had by some means come to the\r\nknowledge of Mr. Hastings's clandestine and wicked intentions towards\r\nthis unhappy man, Cheyt Sing, and his unhappy country, and of his\r\ndesigns for the destruction and the utter ruin of both. He has himself\r\ntold you, and he has got Mr. Anderson to vouch it, that he had received\r\nproposals for the sale of this miserable man and his country. And from\r\nwhom did he receive these proposals, my Lords? Why, from the Nabob Asoph\r\nul Dowlah, to whom he threatened to transfer both the person of the\r\nRajah and his zemindary, if he did not redeem himself by some pecuniary\r\nsacrifice. Now Asoph ul Dowlah, as appears by the minutes on your\r\nLordships' table, was at that time a bankrupt. He was in debt to the\r\nCompany tenfold more than he could pay, and all his revenues were\r\nsequestered for that debt. He was a person of the last degree of\r\nindolence with the last degree of rapacity,--a man of whom Mr. Hastings\r\ndeclared, that he had wasted and destroyed by his misgovernment the\r\nfairest provinces upon earth, that not a person in his dominions was\r\nsecure from his violence, and that even his own father could not enjoy\r\nhis life and honor in safety under him. This avaricious bankrupt tyrant,\r\nwho had beggared and destroyed his own subjects, and could not pay his\r\ndebts to the English government, was the man with whom Mr. Hastings was\r\nin treaty to deliver up Cheyt Sing and his country, under pretence of\r\nhis not having paid regularly to the Company those customary payments\r\nwhich the tyrant would probably have never paid at all, if he had been\r\nput in possession of the country. This I mention to illustrate Mr.\r\nHastings's plans of economy and finance, without considering the\r\ninjustice and cruelty of delivering up a man to the hereditary enemy of\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nIt is known, my Lords, that Mr. Hastings, besides having received\r\nproposals for delivering up the beautiful country of Benares, that\r\ngarden of God, as it is styled in India, to that monster, that rapacious\r\ntyrant, Asoph ul Dowlah, who with his gang of mercenary troops had\r\ndesolated his own country like a swarm of locusts, had purposed likewise\r\nto seize Cheyt Sing's own patrimonial forts, which was nothing less than\r\nto take from him the residence of his women and his children, the seat\r\nof his honor, the place in which the remaining treasures and last hopes\r\nof his family were centred. By the Gentoo law, every lord or supreme\r\nmagistrate is bound to construct and to live in such a fort. It is the\r\nusage of India, and is a matter of state and dignity, as well as of\r\npropriety, reason, and defence. It was probably an apprehension of being\r\ninjured in this tender point, as well as a knowledge of the proposal\r\nmade by the Nabob, which induced Cheyt Sing to offer to buy himself off;\r\nalthough it does not appear from any part of the evidence that he\r\nassigned any other reason than that of Mr. Hastings intending to exact\r\nfrom him six lacs of rupees over and above his other exactions.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, indeed, almost acknowledges the existence of this plot\r\nagainst the Rajah, and his being the author of it. He says, without any\r\ndenial of the fact, that the Rajah suspected some strong acts to be\r\nintended against him, and therefore asked Mr. Markham whether he could\r\nnot buy them off and obtain Mr. Hastings's favor by the payment of\r\n200,000_l._ Mr. Markham gave as his opinion, that 200,000_l._ was not\r\nsufficient; and the next day the Rajah offered 20,000_l._ more, in all\r\n220,000_l._ The negotiation, however, broke off; and why? Not, as Mr.\r\nMarkham says he conjectured, because the Rajah had learned that Mr.\r\nHastings had no longer an intention of imposing these six lacs, or\r\nsomething to that effect, and therefore retracted his offer, but because\r\nthat offer had been rejected by Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nLet us hear what reason the man who was in the true secret gives for not\r\naccepting the Rajah's offer. \"I rejected,\" says Mr. Hastings, \"the offer\r\nof twenty lacs, with which the Rajah would have compromised for his\r\nguilt when it was too late.\" My Lords, he best knows what the motives of\r\nhis own actions were. He says, the offer was made \"when it was too\r\nlate.\" Had he previously told the Rajah what sum of money he would be\r\nrequired to pay in order to buy himself off, or had he required him to\r\nname any sum which he was willing to pay? Did he, after having refused\r\nthe offer made by the Rajah, say, \"Come and make me a better offer, or\r\nupon such a day I shall declare that your offers are inadmissible\"? No\r\nsuch thing appears. Your Lordships will further remark, that Mr.\r\nHastings refused the 200,000_l._ at a time when the exigencies of the\r\nCompany were so pressing that he was obliged to rob, pilfer, and steal\r\nupon every side,--at a time when he was borrowing 40,000_l._ from Mr.\r\nSulivan in one morning, and raising by other under-jobs 27,000_l._ more.\r\nIn the distress [in?] which his own extravagance and prodigality had\r\ninvolved him, 200,000_l._ would have been a weighty benefit, although\r\nderived from his villany; but this relief he positively refused,\r\nbecause, says he, \"the offer came too late.\" From these words, my Lords,\r\nwe may infer that there was a time when the offer would not have been\r\n\"too late,\"--a period at which it would have been readily accepted. No\r\nsuch thing appears. There is not a trace upon your minutes, not a trace\r\nin the correspondence of the Company, to prove that the Rajah would at\r\nany time have been permitted to buy himself off from this complicated\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nI have already stated a curious circumstance in this proceeding, to\r\nwhich I must again beg leave to direct your Lordships' attention. Does\r\nit anywhere appear in that correspondence, or in the testimony of Mr.\r\nBenn, of Mr. Markham, or of any human being, that Mr. Hastings had ever\r\ntold Cheyt Sing with what sum he should be satisfied? There is evidence\r\nbefore you directly in proof that they did not know the amount. Not one\r\nperson knew what his intention was, when he refused this 200,000_l._ For\r\nwhen he met Mr. Markham at Boglipore, and for the first time mentioned\r\nthe sum of 500,000_l._ as the fine he meant to exact, Mr. Markham was\r\nastonished and confounded at its magnitude. He tells you this himself.\r\nIt appears, then, that neither Cheyt Sing nor the Resident at Benares\r\n(who ought to have been in the secret, if upon such an occasion secrecy\r\nis allowable) ever knew what the terms were. The Rajah was in the dark;\r\nhe was left to feel, blindfold, how much money could relieve him from\r\nthe iniquitous intentions of Mr. Hastings; and at last he is told that\r\nhis offer comes too late, without having ever been told the period at\r\nwhich it would have been well-timed, or the amount it was proposed to\r\ntake from him. Is this, my Lords, the proper way to adjudge a fine?\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will now be pleased to advert to the manner in which he\r\ndefends himself and these proceedings. He says, \"I rejected this offer\r\nof twenty lacs, with which the Rajah would have compromised for his\r\nguilt when it was too late.\" If by these words he means too late to\r\nanswer the purpose for which he has said the fine was designed, namely,\r\nthe relief of the Company, the ground of his defence is absolutely\r\nfalse; for it is notorious that at the time referred to the Company's\r\naffairs were in the greatest distress.\r\n\r\nI will next call your Lordships' attention to the projected sale of\r\nBenares to the Nabob of Oude. \"If,\" says Mr. Hastings, \"I ever talked of\r\nselling the Company's sovereignty over Benares to the Nabob of Oude, it\r\nwas but _in terrorem_; and no subsequent act of mine warrants the\r\nsupposition of my having seriously intended it.\" And in another place he\r\nsays, \"If I ever threatened\" (your Lordships will remark, that he puts\r\nhypothetically a matter the reality of which he has got to be solemnly\r\ndeclared on an affidavit, and in a narrative to the truth of which he\r\nhas deposed upon oath)--\"if I ever threatened,\" says he, \"to dispossess\r\nthe Rajah of his territories, it is no more than what my predecessors,\r\nwithout rebuke from their superiors, or notice taken of the expression,\r\nhad wished and intended to have done to his father, even when the\r\nCompany had no pretensions to the sovereignty of the country. It is no\r\nmore than such a legal act of sovereignty as his behavior justified, and\r\nas I was justified in by the intentions of my predecessors. If I\r\npretended to seize upon his forts, it was in full conviction that a\r\ndependant on the Company, guarantied, maintained, and protected in his\r\ncountry by the Company's arms, had no occasion for forts, had no right\r\nto them, and could hold them for no other than suspected and rebellious\r\npurposes. None of the Company's other zemindars are permitted to\r\nmaintain them; and even our ally, the Nabob of the Carnatic, has the\r\nCompany's troops in all his garrisons. Policy and public safety\r\nabsolutely require it. What state could exist that allowed its inferior\r\nmembers to hold forts and garrisons independent of the superior\r\nadministration? It is a solecism in government to suppose it.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, my Lords, he first declares that this was merely done _in\r\nterrorem_; that he never intended to execute the abominable act. And\r\nwill your Lordships patiently endure that such terrific threats as these\r\nshall be hung by your Governor in India over the unhappy people that are\r\nsubject to him and protected by British faith? Will you permit, that,\r\nfor the purpose of extorting money, a Governor shall hold out the\r\nterrible threat of delivering a tributary prince and his people, bound\r\nhand and foot, into the power of their perfidious enemies?\r\n\r\nThe terror occasioned by threatening to take from him his forts can only\r\nbe estimated by considering, that, agreeably to the religion and\r\nprejudices of Hindoos, the forts are the places in which their women are\r\nlodged, in which, according to their notions, their honor is deposited,\r\nand in which is lodged all the wealth that they can save against an evil\r\nday to purchase off the vengeance of an enemy. These forts Mr. Hastings\r\nsays he intended to take, because the Rajah could hold them for no other\r\nthan rebellious and suspected purposes. Now I will show your Lordships\r\nthat the man who has the horrible audacity to make this declaration did\r\nhimself assign to the Rajah these very forts. He put him in possession\r\nof them, and, when there was a dispute about the Nabob's rights to them\r\non the one side and the Company's on the other, did confirm them to this\r\nman. The paper shall be produced, that you may have before your eyes the\r\ngross contradictions into which his rapacity and acts of arbitrary power\r\nhave betrayed him. Thank God, my Lords, men that are greatly guilty are\r\nnever wise. I repeat it, men that are greatly guilty are never wise. In\r\ntheir defence of one crime they are sure to meet the ghost of some\r\nformer defence, which, like the spectre in Virgil, drives them back. The\r\nprisoner at your bar, like the hero of the poet, when he attempts to\r\nmake his escape by one evasion, is stopped by the appearance of some\r\nformer contradictory averment. If he attempts to escape by one door,\r\nthere his criminal allegations of one kind stop him; if he attempts to\r\nescape at another, the facts and allegations intended for some other\r\nwicked purpose stare him full in the face.\r\n\r\n             Quacunque viam sibi fraude petivit,\r\n    Successum Dea dira negat.\r\n\r\nThe paper I hold in my hand contains Nundcomar's accusation of Mr.\r\nHastings. It consists of a variety of charges; and I will first read to\r\nyou what is said by Nundcomar of these forts, which it is pretended\r\ncould be held for none but suspicious and rebellious purposes.\r\n\r\n\"At the time Mr. Hastings was going to Benares, he desired me to give\r\nhim an account in writing of any lands which, though properly belonging\r\nto the Subah of Bahar, might have come under the dominion of Bulwant\r\nSing, that they might be recovered from his son, Rajah Cheyt Sing. The\r\npurgunnahs of Kera, Mungrora, and Bidjegur were exactly in this\r\nsituation, having been usurped by Bulwant Sing from the Subah of Bahar.\r\nI accordingly delivered to Mr. Hastings the accounts of them, from the\r\nentrance of the Company upon the dewanny to the year 1179 of the Fusseli\r\nera, stated at twenty-four lacs. Mr. Hastings said, 'Give a copy of this\r\nto Roy Rada Churn, that, if Cheyt Sing is backward in acknowledging this\r\nclaim, Rada Churn may answer and confute him.' Why Mr. Hastings, when he\r\narrived at Benares, and had called Rajah Cheyt Sing before him, left\r\nthese countries still in the Rajah's usurpations it remains with Mr.\r\nHastings to explain.\"\r\n\r\nThis is Nundcomar's charge. Here follows Mr. Hastings's reply.\r\n\r\n\"I recollect an information given me by Nundcomar concerning the\r\npretended usurpations made by the Rajah of Benares, of the purgunnahs of\r\nKera, Mungrora, and Bidjegur.\" (Your Lordships will recollect that\r\nBidjegur is one of those very forts which he declares could not be held\r\nbut for suspicious and rebellious purposes.) \"I do not recollect his\r\nmentioning it again, when I set out for Benares; neither did I ever\r\nintimate the subject, either to Cheyt Sing or his ministers, because I\r\nknew I could not support the claim; and to have made it and dropped it\r\nwould have been in every sense dishonorable. Not that I passed by it\r\nwith indifference or inattention. I took pains to investigate the\r\nfoundation of this title, and recommended it to the particular inquiry\r\nof Mr. Vansittart, who was the Chief of Patna, at the time in which I\r\nreceived the first intimation. The following letter and voucher, which I\r\nreceived from him, contain a complete statement of this pretended\r\nusurpation.\"\r\n\r\nThese vouchers will answer our purpose, fully to establish that in his\r\nopinion the claim of the English government upon those forts was at that\r\ntime totally unfounded, and so absurd that he did not even dare to\r\nmention it. This fort of Bidjegur, the most considerable in the country,\r\nand of which we shall have much to say hereafter, is the place in which\r\nCheyt Sing had deposited his women and family. That fortress did Mr.\r\nHastings himself give to this very man, deciding in his favor as a\r\njudge, upon an examination and after an inquiry: and yet he now declares\r\nthat he had no right to it, and that he could not hold it but for wicked\r\nand rebellious purposes. But, my Lords, when he changed this language,\r\nhe had resolved to take away these forts,--to destroy them,--to root the\r\nRajah out of every place of refuge, out of every secure place in which\r\nhe could hide his head, or screen himself from the rancor, revenge,\r\navarice, and malice of his ruthless foe. He was resolved to have them,\r\nalthough he had, upon the fullest conviction of the Rajah's right, given\r\nthem to this very man, and put him into the absolute possession of them.\r\n\r\nAgain, my Lords, did he, when Cheyt Sing, in 1775, was put in possession\r\nby the _pottah_ of the Governor-General and Council, which contains an\r\nenumeration of the names of all the places which were given up to him,\r\nand consequently of this among the rest,--did he, either before he put\r\nthe question in Council upon that pottah, or afterwards, tell the\r\nCouncil they were going to put forts into the man's hands to which he\r\nhad no right, and which could be held only for rebellious and suspected\r\npurposes? We refer your Lordships to the places in which all these\r\ntransactions are mentioned, and you will there find Mr. Hastings took no\r\none exception whatever against them; nor, till he was resolved upon the\r\ndestruction of this unhappy man, did he ever so much as mention them. It\r\nwas not till then that he discovers the possession of these forts by the\r\nRajah to be _a solecism in government_.\r\n\r\nAfter quoting the noble examples of Sujah Dowlah, and the other persons\r\nwhom I have mentioned to you, he proceeds to say, that some of his\r\npredecessors, without any pretensions to sovereign authority, endeavored\r\nto get these forts into their possession; and \"I was justified,\" says\r\nhe, \"by the intention of my predecessors.\" Merciful God! if anything can\r\nsurpass what he has said before, it is this: \"My predecessors, without\r\nany title of sovereignty, without any right whatever, wished to get\r\nthese forts into their power; I therefore have a right to do what they\r\nwished to do; and I am justified, not by the acts, but by the\r\n_intentions_ of my predecessors.\" At the same time he knows that these\r\npredecessors had been reprobated by the Company for this part of their\r\nproceedings; he knew that he was sent there to introduce a better\r\nsystem, and to put an end to this state of rapacity. Still, whatever his\r\npredecessors _wished_, however unjust and violent it might be, when the\r\nsovereignty came into his hands, he maintains that he had a right to do\r\nall which they were desirous of accomplishing. Thus the enormities\r\nformerly practised, which the Company sent him to correct, became a\r\nsacred standard for his imitation.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe that he slips in the word _sovereignty_ and\r\nforgets compact; because it is plain, and your Lordships must perceive\r\nit, that, wherever he uses the word sovereignty, he uses it to destroy\r\nthe authority of all compacts; and accordingly in the passage now before\r\nus he declares that there is an invalidity in all compacts entered into\r\nin India, from the nature, state, and constitution of that empire. \"From\r\nthe disorderly form of its government,\" says he, \"there is an invalidity\r\nin all compacts and treaties whatever.\" \"Persons who had no treaty with\r\nthe Rajah wished,\" says he, \"to rob him: therefore I, who have a treaty\r\nwith him, and call myself his sovereign, have a right to realize all\r\ntheir wishes.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fact is, my Lords, that his predecessors never did propose to\r\ndeprive Bulwant Sing, the father of Cheyt Sing, of his zemindary. They,\r\nindeed, wished to have had the dewanny transferred to them, in the\r\nmanner it has since been transferred to the Company. They wished to\r\nreceive his rents, and to be made an intermediate party between him and\r\nthe Mogul emperor, his sovereign. These predecessors had entered into\r\nno compact with the man: they were negotiating with his sovereign for\r\nthe transfer of the dewanny or stewardship of the country, which\r\ntransfer was afterwards actually executed; but they were obliged to give\r\nthe country itself back again to Bulwant Sing, with a guaranty against\r\nall the pretensions of Sujah Dowlah, who had tyrannically assumed an\r\narbitrary power over it. This power the predecessors of Mr. Hastings\r\nmight also have wished to assume; and he may therefore say, according to\r\nthe mode of reasoning which he has adopted,--\"Whatever they wished to\r\ndo, but never succeeded in doing, I may and ought to do of my own will.\r\nWhatever fine Sujah Dowlah would have exacted I will exact. I will\r\npenetrate into that tiger's bosom, and discover the latent seeds of\r\nrapacity and injustice which lurk there, and I will make him the subject\r\nof my imitation.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the principles upon which, without accuser, without judge,\r\nwithout inquiry, he resolved to lay a fine of 500,000_l._ on Cheyt Sing!\r\n\r\nIn order to bind himself to a strict fulfilment of this resolution, he\r\nhas laid down another very extraordinary doctrine. He has laid it down\r\nas a sort of canon, (in injustice and corruption,) that, whatever\r\ndemand, whether just or unjust, a man declares his intention of making\r\nupon another, he should exact the precise sum which he has determined\r\nupon, and that, if he takes anything less, it is a proof of corruption.\r\n\"I have,\" says he, \"shown by this testimony that I never intended to\r\nmake any communication to Cheyt Sing of taking less than the fifty lacs\r\nwhich in my own mind I had resolved to exact.\" And he adds,--\"I shall\r\nmake my last and solemn appeal to the breast of every man who shall read\r\nthis, whether it is likely, or morally possible, that I should have tied\r\ndown my own future conduct to so decided a process and series of acts,\r\nif I had secretly intended to threaten, or to use a degree of violence,\r\nfor no other purpose than to draw from the object of it a mercenary\r\natonement for my own private emolument, and suffer all this tumult to\r\nterminate in an ostensible and unsubstantial submission to the authority\r\nwhich I represented.\"\r\n\r\nHe had just before said, \"If I ever talked of selling the Company's\r\nsovereignty to the Nabob of Oude, it was only _in terrorem_.\" In the\r\nface of this assertion, he here gives you to understand he never held\r\nout anything _in terrorem_, but what he intended to execute. But we will\r\nshow you that in fact he had reserved to himself a power of acting _pro\r\nre nata_, and that he intended to compound or not, just as answered his\r\npurposes upon this occasion. \"I admit,\" he says, \"that I did not enter\r\nit [the intention of fining Cheyt Sing] on the Consultations, because it\r\nwas not necessary; even this plan itself of the fine was not a fixed\r\nplan, but to be regulated by circumstances, both as to the substantial\r\nexecution of it and the mode.\" Now here is a man who has given it in a\r\nsworn narrative, that he did not intend to have a farthing less. Why?\r\n\"Because I should have menaced and done as in former times has been\r\ndone,--made great and violent demands which I reduce afterwards for my\r\nown corrupt purposes.\" Yet he tells you in the course of the same\r\ndefence, but in another paper, that he had no fixed plan, that he did\r\nnot know whether he should exact a fine at all, or what should be his\r\nmode of executing it.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, what shall we say to this man, who declares that it would be a\r\nproof of corruption not to exact the full sum which he had threatened to\r\nexact, but who, finding that this doctrine would press hard upon him,\r\nand be considered as a proof of cruelty and injustice, turns round and\r\ndeclares he had no intention of exacting anything? What shall we say to\r\na man who thus reserves his determination, who threatens to sell a\r\ntributary prince to a tyrant, and cannot decide whether he should take\r\nfrom him his forts and pillage him of all he had, whether he should\r\nraise 500,000_l._ upon him, whether he should accept the 220,000_l._\r\noffered, (which, by the way, we never knew of till long after the whole\r\ntransaction,) whether he should do any or all of those things, and then,\r\nby his own account, going up to Benares without having resolved anything\r\nupon this important subject?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will now assume the hypothesis that he at last discovered\r\nsufficient proof of rebellious practices; still even this gave him no\r\nright to adduce such rebellion in justification of resolutions which he\r\nhad taken, of acts which he had done, before he knew anything of its\r\nexistence. To such a plea we answer, and your Lordships will every one\r\nof you answer,--\"You shall not by a subsequent discovery of rebellious\r\npractices, which you did not know at the time, and which you did not\r\neven believe, as you have expressly told us here, justify your conduct\r\nprior to that discovery.\" If the conspiracy which he falsely imputes to\r\nCheyt Sing, if that wild scheme of driving the English out of India, had\r\nexisted, think in what miserable circumstances we stand as prosecutors,\r\nand your Lordships as judges, if we admit a discovery to be pleaded in\r\njustification of antecedent acts founded upon the assumed existence of\r\nthat which he had no sort of proof, knowledge, or belief of!\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we shall now proceed to another circumstance, not less\r\nculpable in itself, though less shocking to your feelings, than those to\r\nwhich I have already called your attention: a circumstance which throws\r\na strong presumption of guilt upon every part of the prisoner's conduct.\r\nHaving formed all these infernal plots in his mind, but uncertain which\r\nof them he should execute, uncertain what sums of money he should\r\nextort, whether he should deliver up the Rajah to his enemy or pillage\r\nhis forts, he goes up to Benares; but he first delegates to himself all\r\nthe powers of government, both civil and military, in the countries\r\nwhich he was going to visit.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have asserted in our charge that this delegation and\r\ndivision of power was illegal. He invested _himself_ with this\r\nauthority; for _he_ was the majority in the Council: Mr. Wheler's\r\nconsent or dissent signifying nothing. He gave himself powers which the\r\nact of Parliament did not give him. He went up to Benares with an\r\nillegal commission, civil and military; and to prove this I shall beg\r\nleave to read the provisions of the act of Parliament. I shall show what\r\nthe creature ought to be, by showing the law of the creator: what the\r\nlegislature of Great Britain meant that Governor Hastings should be, not\r\nwhat he made himself.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Burke then read the seventh section of the act._]\r\n\r\nNow we do deny that there is by this act given, or that under this act\r\nthere can be given, to the government of India, a power of dividing its\r\nunity into two parts, each of which shall separately be a unity and\r\npossess the power given to the whole. Yet, my Lords, an agreement was\r\nmade between him and Mr. Wheler, that he (Mr. Hastings) should have\r\nevery power, civil and military, in the upper provinces, and that Mr.\r\nWheler should enjoy equal authority in the lower ones.\r\n\r\nNow, to show you that it is impossible for such an agreement to be\r\nlegal, we must refer you to the constitution of the Company's\r\ngovernment. The whole power is vested in the Council, where all\r\nquestions are to be decided by a majority of voices, and the members are\r\ndirected to record in the minutes of their proceedings not only the\r\nquestions decided, but the grounds upon which each individual member\r\nfounds his vote. Now, although the Council is competent to delegate its\r\nauthority for any _specific_ purpose to any servant of the Company, yet\r\nto admit that it can delegate its authority _generally_, without\r\nreserving the means of deliberation and control, would be to change the\r\nwhole constitution. By such a proceeding the government may be divided\r\ninto a number of independent governments, without a common deliberative\r\nCouncil and control. This deliberative capacity, which is so strictly\r\nguarded by the obligation of recording its consultations, would be\r\ntotally annihilated, if the Council divided itself into independent\r\nparts, each acting according to its own discretion. There is no similar\r\ninstance in law, there is no similar instance in policy. The conduct of\r\nthese men implies a direct contradiction; and you will see, by the\r\nagreement they made to support each other, that they were themselves\r\nconscious of the illegality of this proceeding.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Hastings had conferred absolute power upon himself during his\r\nstay in the upper provinces by an order of Council, (of which Council he\r\nwas himself a majority,) he entered the following minute in the\r\nConsultations. \"The Governor-General delivers in the following minute.\r\nIn my minute which I laid before the court on the 21st May, I expressed\r\nthe satisfaction with which I could at this juncture leave the\r\nPresidency, from the mutual confidence which was happily established\r\nbetween Mr. Wheler and me. I now readily repeat that sentiment, and\r\nobserve with pleasure that Mr. Wheler confirms it. Before my departure,\r\nit is probable that we shall in concert have provided at the board for\r\nalmost every important circumstance that can eventually happen during my\r\nabsence; but if any should occur for which no previous provision shall\r\nhave been made in the resolutions of the board, Mr. Wheler may act with\r\nimmediate decision, and with the fullest confidence of my support, in\r\nall such emergencies, as well as in conducting the ordinary business of\r\nthe Presidency, and in general in all matters of this government,\r\nexcepting those which may specially or generally be intrusted to me. Mr.\r\nWheler during my absence may consider himself as possessed of the full\r\npowers of the Governor-General and Council of this government, as in\r\neffect he is by the constitution; and he may be assured, that, so far as\r\nmy sanction and concurrence shall be, or be deemed, necessary to the\r\nconfirmation of his measures, he shall receive them.\"\r\n\r\nNow here is a compact of iniquity between these two duumvirs. They each\r\ngive to the other the full, complete, and perfect powers of the\r\ngovernment; and in order to secure themselves against any obstacles that\r\nmight arise, they mutually engage to ratify each other's acts: and they\r\nsay this is not illegal, because Lord Cornwallis has had such a\r\ndeputation. I must first beg leave to observe that no man can justify\r\nhimself in doing any illegal act by its having been done by another;\r\nmuch less can he justify his own illegal act by pleading an act of the\r\nsame kind done subsequently to his act, because the latter may have been\r\ndone in consequence of his bad example. Men justify their acts in two\r\nways,--by law and by precedent; the former asserts the right, the latter\r\npresumes it from the example of others. But can any man justify an act,\r\nbecause ten or a dozen years after another man has done the same thing?\r\nGood heavens! was there ever such a doctrine before heard? Suppose Lord\r\nCornwallis to have done wrong; suppose him to have acted illegally; does\r\nthat clear the prisoner at your bar? No: on the contrary, it aggravates\r\nhis offence; because he has afforded others an example of corrupt and\r\nillegal conduct. But if even Lord Cornwallis had preceded, instead of\r\nfollowing him, the example would not have furnished a justification.\r\nThere is no resemblance in the cases. Lord Cornwallis does not hold his\r\ngovernment by the act of 1773, but by a special act made afterwards; and\r\ntherefore to attempt to justify acts done under one form of appointment\r\nby acts done under another form is to the last degree wild and absurd.\r\nLord Cornwallis was going to conduct a war of great magnitude, and was\r\nconsequently trusted with extraordinary powers. He went in the two\r\ncharacters of governor and commander-in-chief; and yet the legislature\r\nwas sensible of the doubtful validity of a Governor-General's carrying\r\nwith him the whole powers of the Council. But Mr. Hastings was not\r\ncommander-in-chief, when he assumed the whole military as well as civil\r\npower. Lord Cornwallis, as I have just said, was not only\r\ncommander-in-chief, but was going to a great war, where he might have\r\noccasion to treat with the country powers in a civil capacity; and yet\r\nso doubtful was the legislature upon this point, that they passed a\r\nspecial act to confirm that delegation, and to give him a power of\r\nacting under it.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we do further contend that Mr. Hastings had no right to assume\r\nthe character of commander-in-chief; for he was no military man, nor was\r\nhe appointed by the Company to that trust. His assumption of the\r\nmilitary authority was a gross usurpation. It was an authority to which\r\nhe would have had no right, if the whole powers of government were\r\nvested in him, and he had carried his Council with him on his horse. If,\r\nI say, Mr. Hastings had his Council on his crupper, he could neither\r\nhave given those powers to himself nor made a partition of them with Mr.\r\nWheler. Could Lord Cornwallis, for instance, who carried with him the\r\npower of commander-in-chief, and authority to conclude treaties with all\r\nthe native powers, could he, I ask, have left a Council behind him in\r\nCalcutta with equal powers, who might have concluded treaties in direct\r\ncontradiction to those in which he was engaged? Clearly he could not;\r\ntherefore I contend that this partition of power, which supposes an\r\nintegral authority in each counsellor, is a monster that cannot exist.\r\nThis the parties themselves felt so strongly that they were obliged to\r\nhave recourse to a stratagem scarcely less absurd than their divided\r\nassumption of power. They entered into a compact to confirm each other's\r\nacts, and to support each other in whatever they did: thus attempting to\r\ngive their separate acts a legal form.\r\n\r\nI have further to remark to your Lordships, what has just been suggested\r\nto me, that it was for the express purpose of legalizing Lord\r\nCornwallis's delegation that he was made commander-in-chief as well as\r\nGovernor-General by the act.\r\n\r\nThe next plea urged by Mr. Hastings is conveniency. \"It was\r\n_convenient_,\" he says, \"for me to do this.\" I answer, No person acting\r\nwith delegated power can delegate that power to another. _Delegatus non\r\npotest delegare_ is a maxim of law. Much less has he a right to\r\nsupersede the law, and the principle of his own delegation and\r\nappointment, upon any idea of convenience. But what was the conveniency?\r\nThere was no one professed object connected with Mr. Hastings's going up\r\nto Benares which might not as well have been attained in Calcutta. The\r\nonly difference would have been, that in the latter case he must have\r\nentered some part of his proceedings upon the Consultations, whether he\r\nwished it or not. If he had a mind to negotiate with the Vizier, he had\r\na resident at his court, and the Vizier had a resident in Calcutta. The\r\nmost solemn treaties had often been made without any Governor-General\r\ncarrying up a delegation of civil and military power. If it had been\r\nhis object to break treaties, he might have broken them at Calcutta, as\r\nhe broke the treaty of Chunar. Is there an article in that treaty that\r\nhe might not as well have made at Calcutta? Is there an article that he\r\nbroke (for he broke them all) that he could not have broken at Calcutta?\r\nSo that, whether pledging or breaking the faith of the Company, he might\r\nhave done both or either without ever stirring from the Presidency.\r\n\r\nI can conceive a necessity so urgent as to supersede all laws; but I\r\nhave no conception of a necessity that can require two\r\ngovernors-general, each forming separately a _supreme_ council. Nay, to\r\nbring the point home to him,--if he had a mind to make Cheyt Sing to pay\r\na fine, as he called it, he could have made him do that at Calcutta as\r\nwell as at Benares. He had before contrived to make him pay all the\r\nextra demands that were imposed upon him; and he well knew that he could\r\nsend Colonel Camac, or somebody else, to Benares, with a body of troops\r\nto enforce the payment. Why, then, did he go to try experiments there in\r\nhis own person? For this plain reason: that he might be enabled to put\r\nsuch sums in his own pocket as he thought fit. It was not and could not\r\nbe for any other purpose; and I defy the wit of man to find out any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe says, my Lords, that Cheyt Sing might have resisted, and that, if he\r\nhad not been there, the Rajah might have fled with his money, or raised\r\na rebellion for the purpose of avoiding payment. Why, then, we ask, did\r\nhe not send an army? We ask, whether Mr. Markham, with an army under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Popham, or Mr. Fowke, or any other Resident, was not\r\nmuch more likely to exact a great sum of money than Mr. Hastings\r\nwithout an army? My Lords, the answer must be in the affirmative; it is\r\ntherefore evident that no necessity could exist for his presence, and\r\nthat his presence and conduct occasioned his being defeated in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWe find this man, armed with an illegal commission, undertaking an\r\nenterprise which he has since said was perilous, which proved to be\r\nperilous, and in which, as he has told us himself, the existence of the\r\nBritish empire in India was involved. The talisman, (your Lordships will\r\nremember his use of the word,) that charm which kept all India in order,\r\nwhich kept mighty and warlike nations under the government of a few\r\nEnglishmen, would, I verily believe, have been broken forever, if he, or\r\nany other Governor-General, good or bad, had been killed. Infinite\r\nmischiefs would have followed such an event. The situation in which he\r\nplaced himself, by his own misconduct, was pregnant with danger; and he\r\nput himself in the way of that danger without having any armed force\r\nworth mentioning, although he has acknowledged that Cheyt Sing had then\r\nan immense force. In fact, the demand of two thousand cavalry proves\r\nthat he considered the Rajah's army to be formidable; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding this, with four companies of sepoys, poorly armed and\r\nill provisioned, he went to invade that fine country, and to force from\r\nits sovereign a sum of money, the payment of which he had reason to\r\nthink would be resisted. He thus rashly hazarded his own being and the\r\nbeing of all his people.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says he, \"I did not imagine the Rajah intended to go into\r\nrebellion, and therefore went unarmed.\" Why, then, was his presence\r\nnecessary? Why did he not send an order from Calcutta for the payment of\r\nthe money? But what did he do, when he got there? \"I was alarmed,\" says\r\nhe; \"for the Rajah surrounded my budgero with two thousand men: that\r\nindicated a hostile disposition.\" Well, if he did so, what precaution\r\ndid Mr. Hastings take for his own safety? Why, none, my Lords, none. He\r\nmust therefore have been either a madman, a fool, or a determined\r\ndeclarer of falsehood. Either he thought there was no danger, and\r\ntherefore no occasion for providing against it, or he was the worst of\r\ngovernors, the most culpably improvident of his personal safety, of the\r\nlives of his officers and men, and of his country's honor.\r\n\r\nThe demand of 500,000_l._ was a thing likely to irritate the Rajah and\r\nto create resistance. In fact, he confesses this. Mr. Markham and he had\r\na discourse upon that subject, and agreed to arrest the Rajah, because\r\nthey thought the enforcing this demand might drive him to his forts, and\r\nexcite a rebellion in the country. He therefore knew there was danger to\r\nbe apprehended from this act of violence. And yet, knowing this, he sent\r\none unarmed Resident to give the orders, and four unarmed companies of\r\nsepoys to support him. He provokes the people, he goads them with every\r\nkind of insult added to every kind of injury, and then rushes into the\r\nvery jaws of danger, provoking a formidable foe by the display of a\r\npuny, insignificant force.\r\n\r\nIn expectation of danger, he seized the person of the Rajah, and he\r\npretends that the Rajah suffered no disgrace from his arrest. But, my\r\nLords, we have proved, what was stated by the Rajah, and was well known\r\nto Mr. Hastings, that to imprison a person of elevated station, in that\r\ncountry, is to subject him to the highest dishonor and disgrace, and\r\nwould make the person so imprisoned utterly unfit to execute the\r\nfunctions of government ever after.\r\n\r\nI have now to state to your Lordships a transaction which is worse than\r\nhis wantonly playing with the safety of the Company, worse than his\r\nexacting sums of money by fraud and violence. My Lords, the history of\r\nthis transaction must be prefaced by describing to your Lordships the\r\nduty and privileges attached to the office of _Naib_. A Naib is an\r\nofficer well known in India, as the administrator of the affairs of any\r\ngovernment, whenever the authority of the regular holder is suspended.\r\nBut, although the Naib acts only as a deputy, yet, when the power of the\r\nprincipal is totally superseded, as by imprisonment or otherwise, and\r\nthat of the Naib is substituted, he becomes the actual sovereign, and\r\nthe principal is reduced to a mere pensioner. I am now to show your\r\nLordships whom Mr. Hastings appointed as Naib to the government of the\r\ncountry, after he had imprisoned the Rajah.\r\n\r\nCheyt Sing had given him to understand through Mr. Markham, that he was\r\naware of the design of suspending him, and of placing his government in\r\nthe hands of a Naib whom he greatly dreaded. This person was called\r\nUssaun Sing; he was a remote relation of the family, and an object of\r\ntheir peculiar suspicion and terror. The moment Cheyt Sing was arrested,\r\nhe found that his prophetic soul spoke truly; for Mr. Hastings actually\r\nappointed this very man to be his master. And who was this man? We are\r\ntold by Mr. Markham, in his evidence here, that he was a man who had\r\ndishonored his family,--he was the disgrace of his house,--that he was a\r\nperson who could not be trusted; and Mr. Hastings, in giving Mr. Markham\r\nfull power afterwards to appoint Naibs, expressly excepted this Ussaun\r\nSing from all trust whatever, as a person totally unworthy of it. Yet\r\nthis Ussaun Sing, the disgrace and calamity of his family, an incestuous\r\nadulterer, and a supposed issue of a guilty connection, was declared\r\nNaib. Yes, my Lords, this degraded, this wicked and flagitious\r\ncharacter, the Rajah's avowed enemy, was, in order to heighten the\r\nRajah's disgrace, to embitter his ruin, to make destruction itself\r\ndishonorable as well as destructive, appointed this [his?] Naib. Thus,\r\nwhen Mr. Hastings had imprisoned the Rajah, in the face of his subjects,\r\nand in the face of all India, without fixing any term for the duration\r\nof his imprisonment, he delivered up the country to a man whom he knew\r\nto be utterly undeserving, a man whom he kept in view for the purpose of\r\nfrightening the Rajah, and whom he was obliged to depose on account of\r\nhis misconduct almost as soon as he had named him, and to exclude\r\nspecially from all kind of trust. We have heard of much tyranny,\r\navarice, and insult in the world; but such an instance of tyranny,\r\navarice, and insult combined has never before been exhibited.\r\n\r\nWe are now come to the last scene of this flagitious transaction. When\r\nMr. Hastings imprisoned the Rajah, he did not renew his demand for the\r\n500,000_l._, but he exhibited a regular charge of various pretended\r\ndelinquencies against him, digested into heads, and he called on him, in\r\na dilatory, irregular way of proceeding, for an answer. The man, under\r\nevery difficulty and every distress, gave an answer to every particular\r\nof the charge, as exact and punctilious as could have been made to\r\narticles of impeachment in this House.\r\n\r\nI must here request your Lordships to consider the order of these\r\nproceedings. Mr. Hastings, having determined upon the utter ruin and\r\ndestruction of this unfortunate prince, endeavored, by the arrest of his\r\nperson, by a contemptuous disregard to his submissive applications, by\r\nthe appointment of a deputy who was personally odious to him, and by the\r\nterror of still greater insults, he endeavored, I say, to goad him on to\r\nthe commission of some acts of resistance sufficient to give a color of\r\njustice to that last dreadful extremity to which he had resolved to\r\ncarry his malignant rapacity. Failing in this wicked project, and\r\nstudiously avoiding the declaration of any terms upon which the Rajah\r\nmight redeem himself from these violent proceedings, he next declared\r\nhis intention of seizing his forts, the depository of his victim's\r\nhonor, and of the means of his subsistence. He required him to deliver\r\nup his accounts and accountants, together with all persons who were\r\nacquainted with the particulars of his effects and treasures, for the\r\npurpose of transferring those effects to such persons as he (Mr.\r\nHastings) chose to nominate.\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis of aggravated insult and brutality that the\r\nindignation which these proceedings had occasioned in the breasts of the\r\nRajah's subjects burst out into an open flame. The Rajah had retired to\r\nthe last refuge of the afflicted, to offer up prayers to his God and our\r\nGod, when a vile _chubdar_, or tipstaff, came to interrupt and insult\r\nhim. His alarmed and loyal subjects felt for a beloved sovereign that\r\ndeep interest which we should all feel, if our sovereign were so\r\ntreated. What man with a spark of loyalty in his breast, what man\r\nregardful of the honor of his country, when he saw his sovereign\r\nimprisoned, and so notorious a wretch appointed his deputy, could be a\r\npatient witness of such wrongs? The subjects of this unfortunate prince\r\ndid what we should have done,--what all who love their country, who love\r\ntheir liberty, who love their laws, who love their property, who love\r\ntheir sovereign, would have done on such an occasion. They looked upon\r\nhim as their sovereign, although degraded. They were unacquainted with\r\nany authority superior to his, and the phantom of tyranny which\r\nperformed these oppressive acts was unaccompanied by that force which\r\njustifies submission by affording the plea of necessity. An unseen\r\ntyrant and four miserable companies of sepoys executed all the horrible\r\nthings that we have mentioned. The spirit of the Rajah's subjects was\r\nroused by their wrongs, and encouraged by the contemptible weakness of\r\ntheir oppressors. The whole country rose up in rebellion, and surely in\r\njustifiable rebellion. Every writer on the Law of Nations, every man\r\nthat has written, thought, or felt upon the affairs of government, must\r\nwrite, know, think, and feel, that a people so cruelly scourged and\r\noppressed, both in the person of their chief and in their own persons,\r\nwere justified in their resistance. They were roused to vengeance, and a\r\nshort, but most bloody war followed.\r\n\r\nWe charge the prisoner at your bar with all the consequences of this\r\nwar. We charge him with the murder of our sepoys, whom he sent unarmed\r\nto such a dangerous enterprise. We charge him with the blood of every\r\nman that was shed in that place; and we call him, as we have called him,\r\na tyrant, an oppressor, and a murderer. We call him murderer in the\r\nlargest and fullest sense of the word; because he was the cause of the\r\nmurder of our English officers and sepoys, whom he kept unarmed, and\r\nunacquainted with the danger to which they would be exposed by the\r\nviolence of his transactions. He sacrificed to his own nefarious views\r\nevery one of those lives, as well as the lives of the innocent natives\r\nof Benares, whom he designedly drove to resistance by the weakness of\r\nthe force opposed to them, after inciting them by tyranny and insult to\r\nthat display of affection towards their sovereign which is the duty of\r\nall good subjects.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these are the iniquities which we have charged upon the\r\nprisoner at your bar; and I will next call your Lordships' attention to\r\nthe manner in which these iniquities have been pretended to be\r\njustified. You will perceive a great difference in the manner in which\r\nthis prisoner is tried, and of which he so much complains, and the\r\nmanner in which he dealt with the unfortunate object of his oppression.\r\nThe latter thus openly appeals to his accuser. \"You are,\" says he, \"upon\r\nthe spot. It is happy for me that you are so. You can now inquire into\r\nmy conduct.\" Did Mr. Hastings so inquire? No, my Lords, we have not a\r\nword of any inquiry; he even found fresh matter of charge in the answer\r\nof the Rajah, although, if there is any fault in this answer, it is its\r\nextremely humble and submissive tone. If there was anything faulty in\r\nhis manner, it was his extreme humility and submission. It is plain he\r\nwould have almost submitted to anything. He offered, in fact,\r\n220,000_l._ to redeem himself from greater suffering. Surely no man\r\ngoing into rebellion would offer 220,000_l._ of the treasure which would\r\nbe so essential to his success; nor would any government that was really\r\napprehensive of rebellion call upon the suspected person to arm and\r\ndiscipline two thousand horse. My Lords, it is evident no such\r\napprehensions were entertained; nor was any such charge made until\r\npunishment had commenced. A vague accusation was then brought forward,\r\nwhich was answered by a clear and a natural defence, denying some parts\r\nof the charge, evading and apologizing for others, and desiring the\r\nwhole to be inquired into. To this request the answer of the\r\nGovernor-General was, \"That won't do; you shall have no inquiries.\" And\r\nwhy? \"Because I have arbitrary power, you have no rights, and I can and\r\nwill punish you without inquiry.\" I admit, that, if his will is the law,\r\nhe may take [make?] the charge before punishment or the punishment\r\nbefore the charge, or he may punish without making any charge. If his\r\nwill is the law, all I have been saying amounts to nothing. But I have\r\nendeavored to let your Lordships see that in no country upon the earth\r\nis the will of a despot law. It may produce wicked, flagitious,\r\ntyrannical acts; but in no country is it law.\r\n\r\nThe duty of a sovereign in cases of rebellion, as laid down in the\r\nHedaya, agrees with the general practice in India. It was usual, except\r\nin cases of notorious injustice and oppression, whenever a rebellion or\r\na suspicion of a rebellion existed, to admonish the rebellious party and\r\npersuade him to return to his duty. Causes of complaint were removed\r\nand misunderstandings explained, and, to save the effusion of blood,\r\nsevere measures were not adopted until they were rendered indispensable.\r\nThis wise and provident law is or ought to be the law in all countries:\r\nit was in fact the law in that country, but Mr. Hastings did not attend\r\nto it. His unfortunate victim was goaded to revolt and driven from his\r\nsubjects, although he endeavored by message after message to reconcile\r\nthis cruel tyrant to him. He is told in reply, \"You have shed the blood\r\nof Englishmen, and I will never be reconciled to you.\" Your Lordships\r\nwill observe that the reason he gives for such an infernal determination\r\n(for it cannot be justly qualified by any other word) is of a nature to\r\nmake tyranny the very foundation of our government. I do not say here\r\nupon what occasion people may or may not resist; but surely, if ever\r\nthere was an occasion on which people, from love to their sovereign and\r\nregard to their country, might take up arms, it was this. They saw a\r\ntyrant violent in his demands and weak in his power. They saw their\r\nprince imprisoned and insulted, after he had made every offer of\r\nsubmission, and had laid his turban three times in the lap of his\r\noppressor. They saw him, instead of availing himself of the means he\r\npossessed of cutting off his adversary, (for the life of Mr. Hastings\r\nwas entirely in his power,) betaking himself to flight. They then\r\nthronged round him, took up arms in his defence, and shed the blood of\r\nsome of his insulters. Is this resistance, so excited, so provoked, a\r\nplea for irreconcilable vengeance?\r\n\r\nI must beg pardon for having omitted to lay before your Lordships in its\r\nproper place a most extraordinary paper, which will show you in what\r\nmanner judicial inquiries are conducted, upon what grounds charges are\r\nmade, by what sort of evidence they are supported, and, in short, to\r\nwhat perils the lives and fortunes of men are subjected in that country.\r\nThis paper is in the printed Minutes, page 1608. It was given in\r\nagreeably to the retrograde order which they have established in their\r\njudicial proceedings. It was produced to prove the truth of a charge of\r\nrebellion which was made some months before the paper in evidence was\r\nknown to the accuser.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_To the Honorable Warren Hastings._\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,--About the month of November last, I communicated to Mr.\r\n    Markham the substance of a conversation said to have passed between\r\n    Rajah Cheyt Sing and Saadut Ali, and which was reported to me by a\r\n    person in whom I had some confidence. The mode of communicating this\r\n    intelligence to you I left entirely to Mr. Markham. In this\r\n    conversation, which was private, the Rajah and Saadut Ali were said\r\n    to have talked of Hyder Ali's victory over Colonel Baillie's\r\n    detachment, to have agreed that they ought to seize this opportunity\r\n    of consulting their own interest, and to have determined to watch\r\n    the success of Hyder's arms. Some days after this conversation was\r\n    said to have happened, I was informed by the same person that the\r\n    Rajah had received a message from one of the Begums at Fyzabad, (I\r\n    think it was from Sujah ul Dowlah's widow,) advising him not to\r\n    comply with the demands of government, and encouraging him to expect\r\n    support in case of his resisting. This also, I believe, I\r\n    communicated to Mr. Markham; but not being perfectly certain, I now\r\n    think it my duty to remove the possibility of your remaining\r\n    unacquainted with a circumstance which may not be unconnected with\r\n    the present conduct of the Rajah.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, is evidence of evidence given to Mr. Markham by Mr. Balfour,\r\nfrom Lucknow, in the month of November, 1781, long after the transaction\r\nat Benares. But what was this evidence? \"I communicated,\" he says, \"the\r\nsubstance of a conversation said to have passed.\" Observe, _said_: not a\r\nconversation that had passed to his knowledge or recollection, but what\r\nhis informant said had passed. He adds, this conversation was reported\r\nto him by a person whom he won't name, but in whom, he says, he had some\r\nconfidence. This anonymous person, in whom he had put some confidence,\r\nwas not himself present at the conversation; he only reports to him that\r\nit was _said_ by somebody else that such a conversation had taken place.\r\nThis conversation, which somebody told Colonel Balfour he had heard was\r\nsaid by somebody to have taken place, if true, related to matters of\r\ngreat importance; still the mode of its communication was left to Mr.\r\nMarkham, and that gentleman did not bring it forward till some months\r\nafter. Colonel Balfour proceeds to say,--\"Some days after this\r\nconversation was said to have happened,\" (your Lordships will observe it\r\nis always, \"was said to have happened,\") \"I was informed by the same\r\nperson that the Rajah had received a message from one of the Begums at\r\nFyzabad, (I think it was from Sujah ul Dowlah's widow,) advising him not\r\nto comply with the demands of government, and encouraging him to expect\r\nsupport in case of his resisting.\" He next adds,--\"This also, I\r\nbelieve,\" (observe, he says he is not quite sure of it,) \"I communicated\r\nto Mr. Markham; but not being perfectly certain,\" (of a matter the\r\nimmediate knowledge of which, if true, was of the highest importance to\r\nhis country,) \"I now think it my duty to remove the possibility of your\r\nremaining unacquainted with, a circumstance which may not be unconnected\r\nwith the present conduct of the Rajah.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a man that comes with information long after the fact deposed\r\nto, and, after having left to another the communication of his\r\nintelligence to the proper authority, that other neglects the matter. No\r\nletter of Mr. Markham's appears, communicating any such conversation to\r\nMr. Hastings: and, indeed, why he did not do so must appear very obvious\r\nto your Lordships; for a more contemptible, ridiculous, and absurd story\r\nnever was invented. Does Mr. Balfour come forward and tell him who his\r\ninformant was? No. Does he say, \"He was an informant whom I dare not\r\nname, upon account of his great consequence, and the great confidence I\r\nhad in him\"? No. He only says slightly, \"I have some confidence in him.\"\r\nIt is upon this evidence of a reporter of what another is _said_ to have\r\n_said_, that Mr. Hastings and his Council rely for proof, and have\r\nthought proper to charge the Rajah, with having conceived rebellious\r\ndesigns soon after the time when Mr. Hastings had declared his belief\r\nthat no such designs had been formed.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has done with his charge of rebellion what he did with his\r\ndeclaration of arbitrary power: after he had vomited it up in one place,\r\nhe returns to it in another. He here declares (after he had recorded\r\nhis belief that no rebellion was ever intended) that Mr. Markham was in\r\npossession of information which he might have believed, if it had been\r\ncommunicated to him. Good heavens! when you review all these\r\ncircumstances, and consider the principles upon which this man was tried\r\nand punished, what must you think of the miserable situation of persons\r\nof the highest rank in that country, under the government of men who are\r\ndisposed to disgrace and ruin them in this iniquitous manner!\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour is in Europe, I believe. How comes it that he is not\r\nproduced here to tell your Lordships who was his informer, and what he\r\nknows of the transaction? They have not produced him, but have thought\r\nfit to rely upon this miserable, beggarly semblance of evidence, the\r\nvery production of which was a crime, when brought forward for the\r\npurpose of giving color to acts of injustice and oppression. If you ask,\r\nWho is this Mr. Balfour? He is a person who was a military collector of\r\nrevenue in the province of Rohilcund: a country now ruined and\r\ndesolated, but once the garden of the world. It was from the depth of\r\nthat horrible devastating system that he gave this ridiculous,\r\ncontemptible evidence, which if it can be equalled, I shall admit that\r\nthere is not one word we have said that you ought to attend to.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships are now enabled to sum up the amount and estimate the\r\nresult of all this iniquity. The Rajah himself is punished, he is ruined\r\nand undone; but the 500,000_l._ is not gained. He has fled his country;\r\nbut he carried his treasures with him. His forts are taken possession\r\nof; but there was nothing found in them. It is the report of the\r\ncountry, and is so stated by Mr. Hastings, that he carried away with him\r\nin gold and silver to the value of about 400,000_l._; and thus that sum\r\nwas totally lost, even as an object of plunder, to the Company. The\r\nauthor of the mischief lost his favorite object by his cruelty and\r\nviolence. If Mr. Hastings had listened to Cheyt Sing at first,--if he\r\nhad answered his letters, and dealt civilly with him,--if he had\r\nendeavored afterwards to compromise matters,--if he had _told_ him what\r\nhis demands were,--if, even after the rebellion had broken out, he had\r\ndemanded and exacted a fine,--the Company would have gained 220,000_l._\r\nat least, and perhaps a much larger sum, without difficulty. They would\r\nnot then have had 400,000_l._ carried out of the country by a tributary\r\nchief, to become, as we know that sum has become, the plunder of the\r\nMahrattas and our other enemies. I state to you the account of the\r\nprofit and loss of tyranny: take it as an account of profit and loss;\r\nforget the morality, forget the law, forget the policy; take it, I say,\r\nas a matter of profit and loss. Mr. Hastings lost the subsidy; Mr.\r\nHastings lost the 220,000_l._ which was offered him, and more that he\r\nmight have got. Mr. Hastings lost it all; and the Company lost the\r\n400,000_l._ which he meant to exact. It was carried from the British\r\ndominions to enrich its enemies forever.\r\n\r\nThis man, my Lords, has not only acted thus vindictively himself, but he\r\nhas avowed the principle of revenge as a general rule of policy,\r\nconnected with the security of the British government in India. He has\r\ndared to declare, that, if a native once draws his sword, he is not to\r\nbe pardoned; that you never are to forgive any man who has killed an\r\nEnglish soldier. You are to be implacable and resentful; and there is\r\nno maxim of tyrants, which, upon account of the supposed weakness of\r\nyour government, you are not to pursue. Was this the conduct of the\r\nMogul conquerors of India? and must this _necessarily_ be the policy of\r\ntheir Christian successors? I pledge myself, if called upon, to prove\r\nthe contrary. I pledge myself to produce, in the history of the Mogul\r\nempire, a series of pardons and amnesties for rebellions, from its\r\nearliest establishments, and in its most distant provinces.\r\n\r\nI need not state to your Lordships what you know to be the true\r\nprinciples of British policy in matters of this nature. When there has\r\nbeen provocation, you ought to be ready to listen to terms of\r\nreconciliation, even after war has been made. This you ought to do, to\r\nshow that you are placable; such policy as this would doubtless be of\r\nthe greatest benefit and advantage to you. Look to the case of Sujah\r\nDowlah. You had, in the course of a war with him, driven him from his\r\ncountry; you had not left him in possession of a foot of earth in the\r\nworld. The Mogul was his sovereign, and, by his authority, it was in\r\nyour power to dispose of the vizierate, and of every office of state\r\nwhich Sujah Dowlah held under the emperor: for he hated him mortally,\r\nand was desirous of dispossessing him of everything. What did you do?\r\nThough he had shed much English blood, you reëstablished him in all his\r\npower, you gave him more than he before possessed; and you had no reason\r\nto repent your generosity. Your magnanimity and justice proved to be the\r\nbest policy, and was the subject of admiration from one end of India to\r\nthe other. But Mr. Hastings had other maxims and other principles. You\r\nare weak, he says, and therefore you ought never to forgive. Indeed, Mr.\r\nHastings never does forgive. The Rajah was weak, and he persecuted him;\r\nMr. Hastings was weak, and he lost his prey. He went up the country with\r\nthe rapacity, but not with the talons and beak, of a vulture. He went to\r\nlook for plunder; but he was himself plundered, the country was ravaged,\r\nand the prey escaped.\r\n\r\nAfter the escape of Cheyt Sing, there still existed in one corner of the\r\ncountry some further food for Mr. Hastings's rapacity. There was a place\r\ncalled Bidjegur, one of those forts which Mr. Hastings declared could\r\nnot be safely left in the possession of the Rajah; measures were\r\ntherefore taken to obtain possession of this place, soon after the\r\nflight of its unfortunate proprietor. And what did he find in it? A\r\ngreat and powerful garrison? No, my Lords: he found in it the wives and\r\nfamily of the Rajah; he found it inhabited by two hundred women, and\r\ndefended by a garrison of eunuchs and a few feeble militia-men. This\r\nfortress was supposed by him to contain some money, which he hoped to\r\nlay hold of when all other means of rapacity had escaped him. He first\r\nsends (and you have it on your minutes) a most cruel, most atrocious,\r\nand most insulting message to these unfortunate women; one of whom, a\r\nprincipal personage of the family, we find him in the subsequent\r\nnegotiation scandalizing in one minute, and declaring to be a woman of\r\nrespectable character in the next,--treating her by turns as a\r\nprostitute and as an amiable woman, as best suited the purposes of the\r\nhour. This woman, with two hundred of her sex, he found in Bidjegur.\r\nWhatever money they had was their own property; and as such Cheyt Sing,\r\nwho had visited the place before his flight, had left it for their\r\nsupport, thinking that it would be secure to them as their property,\r\nbecause they were persons wholly void of guilt, as they must needs have\r\nbeen. This money the Rajah might have carried off with him; but he left\r\nit them, and we must presume that it was their property; and no attempt\r\nwas ever made by Mr. Hastings to prove otherwise. They had no other\r\nproperty that could be found. It was the only means of subsistence for\r\nthemselves, their children, their domestics, and dependants, and for the\r\nwhole female part of that once illustrious and next to royal family.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. A detachment of soldiers was sent to seize the forts\r\n[fort?]. Soldiers are habitually men of some generosity; even when they\r\nare acting in a bad cause, they do not wholly lose the military spirit.\r\nBut Mr. Hastings, fearing that they might not be animated with the same\r\nlust of plunder as himself, stimulated them to demand the plunder of the\r\nplace, and expresses his hopes that no composition would be made with\r\nthese women, and that not one shilling of the booty would be allowed\r\nthem. He does not trust to their acting as soldiers who have their\r\nfortunes to make; but he stimulates and urges them not to give way to\r\nthe generous passions and feelings of men.\r\n\r\nHe thus writes from Benares, the 22d of October, 1781, ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning. \"I am this instant favored with yours of yesterday; mine to\r\nyou of the same date has before this time acquainted you with my\r\nresolutions and sentiments respecting the Ranny. I think every demand\r\nshe has made to you, except that of safety and respect for her person,\r\nis unreasonable. If the reports brought to me are true, your rejecting\r\nher offers, or any negotiation with her, would soon obtain you\r\npossession of the fort upon your own terms. I apprehend that she will\r\ncontrive to defraud the captors of a considerable part of the booty by\r\nbeing suffered to retire without examination; but this is your\r\nconsideration, and not mine. I should be sorry that your officers and\r\nsoldiers lost any part of the reward to which they are so well entitled;\r\nbut I cannot make any objection, as you must be the best judge of the\r\nexpediency of the promised indulgence to the Ranny. What you have\r\nengaged for I will certainly ratify; but as to permitting the Ranny to\r\nhold the purgunnah of Hurluk, or any other in the zemindary, without\r\nbeing subject to the authority of the zemindar, or any lands whatever,\r\nor indeed making any conditions with her for a provision, I will never\r\nconsent to it.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have seen the principles upon which this man justifies his\r\nconduct. Here his real nature, character, and disposition break out.\r\nThese women had been guilty of no rebellion; he never charged them with\r\nany crime but that of having wealth; and yet you see with what ferocity\r\nhe pursues everything that belonged to the destined object of his cruel,\r\ninhuman, and more than tragic revenge. \"If,\" says he, \"you have made an\r\nagreement with them, and will insist upon it, I will keep it; but if you\r\nhave not, I beseech you not to make any. Don't give them anything;\r\nsuffer no stipulations whatever of a provision for them. The\r\ncapitulation I will ratify, provided it contains no article of future\r\nprovision for them.\" This he positively forbade; so that his\r\nbloodthirsty vengeance would have sent out these two hundred innocent\r\nwomen to starve naked in the world.\r\n\r\nBut he not only declares that the money found in the fort is the\r\nsoldiers', he adds, that he should be sorry, if they lost a shilling of\r\nit. So that you have here a man not only declaring that the money was\r\ntheirs, directly contrary to the Company's positive orders upon other\r\nsimilar occasions, and after he had himself declared that prize-money\r\nwas poison to soldiers, but directly inciting them to insist upon their\r\nright to it.\r\n\r\nA month had been allowed by proclamation for the submission of all\r\npersons who had been in rebellion, which submission was to entitle them\r\nto indemnity. But, my Lords, he endeavored to break the public faith\r\nwith these women, by inciting the soldiers to make no capitulation with\r\nthem, and thus depriving them of the benefit of the proclamation, by\r\npreventing their voluntary surrender.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Burke here read the proclamation._]\r\n\r\nFrom the date of this proclamation it appears that the surrender of the\r\nfort was clearly within the time given to those who had been guilty of\r\nthe most atrocious acts of rebellion to repair to their homes and enjoy\r\nan indemnity. These women had never quitted their homes, nor had they\r\nbeen charged with rebellion, and yet they were cruelly excluded from the\r\ngeneral indemnity; and after the army had taken unconditional possession\r\nof the fort, they were turned out of it, and ordered to the quarters of\r\nthe commanding officer, Major Popham. This officer had received from Mr.\r\nHastings a power to rob them, a power to plunder them, a power to\r\ndistribute the plunder, but no power to give them any allowance, nor any\r\nauthority even to receive them.\r\n\r\nIn this disgraceful affair the soldiers showed a generosity which Mr.\r\nHastings neither showed nor would have suffered, if he could have\r\nprevented it. They agreed amongst themselves to give to these women\r\nthree lacs of rupees, and some trifle more; and the rest was divided as\r\na prey among the army. The sum found in the fort was about 238,000_l._,\r\nnot the smallest part of which was in any way proved to be Cheyt Sing's\r\nproperty, or the property of any person but the unfortunate women who\r\nwere found in the possession of it.\r\n\r\nThe plunder of the fort being thus given to the soldiers, what does Mr.\r\nHastings next do? He is astonished and stupefied to find so much\r\nunprofitable violence, so much tyranny, and so little pecuniary\r\nadvantage,--so much bloodshed, without any profit to the Company. He\r\ntherefore breaks his faith with the soldiers; declares, that, having no\r\nright to the money, they must refund it to the Company; and on their\r\nrefusal, he instituted a suit against them. With respect to the three\r\nlacs of rupees, or 30,000_l._, which was to be given to these women,\r\nhave we a scrap of paper to prove its payment? is there a single receipt\r\nor voucher to verify their having received one sixpence of it? I am\r\nrather inclined to think that they did receive it, or some part of it;\r\nbut I don't know a greater crime in public officers than to have no kind\r\nof vouchers for the disposal of any large sums of money which pass\r\nthrough their hands: but this, my Lords, is the great vice of Mr.\r\nHastings's government.\r\n\r\nI have briefly taken notice of the claim which Mr. Hastings thought\r\nproper to make, on the part of the Company, to the treasure found in the\r\nfort of Bidjegur, after he had instigated the army to claim it as the\r\nright of the captors. Your Lordships will not be at a loss to account\r\nfor this strange and barefaced inconsistency. This excellent Governor\r\nforesaw that he would have a bad account of this business to give to the\r\ncontractors in Leadenhall Street, who consider laws, religion, morality,\r\nand the principles of state policy of empires as mere questions of\r\nprofit and loss. Finding that he had dismal accounts to give of great\r\nsums expended without any returns, he had recourse to the only expedient\r\nthat was left him. He had broken his faith with the ladies in the fort,\r\nby not suffering his officers to grant them that indemnity which his\r\nproclamation offered. Then, finding that the soldiers had taken him at\r\nhis word, and appropriated the treasure to their own use, he next broke\r\nhis faith with them. A constant breach of faith is a maxim with him. He\r\nclaims the treasure for the Company, and institutes a suit before Sir\r\nElijah Impey, who gives the money to the Company, and not to the\r\nsoldiers. The soldiers appeal; and since the beginning of this trial, I\r\nbelieve even very lately, it has been decided by the Council that the\r\nletter of Mr. Hastings was not, as Sir Elijah Impey pretended, a mere\r\nprivate letter, because it had \"Dear Sir,\" in it, but a public order,\r\nauthorizing the soldiers to divide the money among themselves.\r\n\r\nThus 200,000_l._ was distributed among the soldiers; 400,000_l._ was\r\ntaken away by Cheyt Sing, to be pillaged by all the Company's enemies\r\nthrough whose countries he passed; and so ended one of the great\r\nsources from which this great financier intended to supply the\r\nexigencies of the Company, and recruit their exhausted finances.\r\n\r\nBy this proceeding, my Lords, the national honor is disgraced, all the\r\nrules of justice are violated, and every sanction, human and divine,\r\ntrampled upon. We have, on one side, a country ruined, a noble family\r\ndestroyed, a rebellion raised by outrage and quelled by bloodshed, the\r\nnational faith pledged to indemnity, and that indemnity faithlessly\r\nwithheld from helpless, defenceless women; while the other side of the\r\npicture is equally unfavorable. The East India Company have had their\r\ntreasure wasted, their credit weakened, their honor polluted, and their\r\ntroops employed against their own subjects, when their services were\r\nrequired against foreign enemies.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it only remains for me, at this time, to make a few\r\nobservations upon some proceedings of the prisoner respecting the\r\nrevenue of Benares. I must first state to your Lordships that in the\r\nyear 1780 he made a demand upon that country, which, by his own account,\r\nif it had been complied with, would only have left 23,000_l._ a year for\r\nthe maintenance of the Rajah and his family. I wish to have this account\r\nread, for the purpose of verifying the observations which I shall have\r\nto make to your Lordships.\r\n\r\n     [_Here the account was read._]\r\n\r\nI must now observe to your Lordships, that Mr. Markham and Mr. Hastings\r\nhave stated the Rajah's net revenue at forty-six lacs: but the accounts\r\nbefore you state it at forty lacs only. Mr. Hastings had himself\r\ndeclared that he did not think the country could safely yield more, and\r\nthat any attempt to extract more would be ruinous.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe that the first of these estimates is\r\nunaccompanied with any document whatever, and that it is contradicted by\r\nthe papers of receipt and the articles of account, from all of which it\r\nappears that the country never yielded more than forty lacs during the\r\ntime that Mr. Hastings had it in his possession; and you may be sure he\r\nsqueezed as much out of it as he could. He had his own Residents,--first\r\nMr. Markham, then Mr. Fowke, then Mr. Grant; they all went up with a\r\ndesign to make the most of it. They endeavored to do so; but they never\r\ncould screw it up to more than forty lacs by all the violent means which\r\nthey employed. The ordinary subsidy, as paid at Calcutta by the Rajah,\r\namounted to twenty-two lacs; and it is therefore clearly proved by this\r\npaper, that Mr. Hastings's demand of fifty lacs (500,000_l._), joined to\r\nthe subsidies, was more than the whole revenue which the country could\r\nyield. What hoarded treasure the Rajah possessed, and which Mr. Hastings\r\nsays he carried off with him, does not appear. That it was any\r\nconsiderable sum is more than Mr. Hastings knows, more than can be\r\nproved, more than is probable. He had not, in his precipitate flight,\r\nany means, I think, of carrying away a great sum. It further appears\r\nfrom these accounts, that, after the payment of the subsidy, there would\r\nonly have been left 18,000_l._ a year for the support of the Rajah's\r\nfamily and establishments.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now a standard, not a visionary one, but a standard\r\nverified by accurate calculation and authentic accounts. You may now\r\nfairly estimate the avarice and rapacity of this man, who describes\r\ncountries to be enormously rich in order that he may be justified in\r\npillaging them. But however insatiable the prisoner's avarice may be, he\r\nhas other objects in view, other passions rankling in his heart, besides\r\nthe lust of money. He was not ignorant, and we have proved it by his own\r\nconfession, that his pretended expectation of benefit to the Company\r\ncould not be realized; but he well knew that by enforcing his demands he\r\nshould utterly and effectually ruin a man whom he mortally hated and\r\nabhorred,--a man who could not, by any sacrifices offered to the\r\navarice, avert the cruelty of his implacable enemy. As long as truth\r\nremains, as long as figures stand, as long as two and two are four, as\r\nlong as there is mathematical and arithmetical demonstration, so long\r\nshall his cruelty, rage, ravage, and oppression remain evident to an\r\nastonished posterity.\r\n\r\nI shall undertake, my Lords, when this court meets again, to develop the\r\nconsequences of this wicked proceeding. I shall then show you that that\r\npart of the Rajah's family which he left behind him, and which Mr.\r\nHastings pretended to take under his protection, was also ruined,\r\nundone, and destroyed; and that the once beautiful country of Benares,\r\nwhich he has had the impudence to represent as being still in a\r\nprosperous condition, was left by him in such a state as would move pity\r\nin any tyrant in the world except the one who now stands before you.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] Hedaya, Vol. II. p. 621.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY: TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--We are called, with an awful voice, to come forth and make\r\ngood our charge against the prisoner at your bar; but as a long time has\r\nelapsed since your Lordships heard that charge, I shall take the liberty\r\nof requesting my worthy fellow Manager near me to read that part to your\r\nLordships which I am just now going to observe upon, that you may be the\r\nbetter able to apply my observations to the letter of the charge.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Wyndham reads._]\r\n\r\n\"That the said Warren Hastings, having, as aforesaid, expelled the said\r\nCheyt Sing from his dominions, did, of his own usurped authority, and\r\nwithout any communication with or any approbation given by the other\r\nmembers of the Council, nominate and appoint Rajah Mehip Narrain to the\r\ngovernment of the provinces of Benares, and did appoint his father,\r\nDurbege Sing, as administrator of his authority, and did give to the\r\nBritish Resident, William Markham, a controlling authority over both;\r\nand did farther abrogate and set aside all treaties and agreements which\r\nsubsisted between the state of Benares and the British nation; and did\r\narbitrarily and tyrannically, of his mere authority, raise the tribute\r\nto the sum of four hundred thousand pounds sterling, or thereabouts; did\r\nfurther wantonly and illegally impose certain oppressive duties upon\r\ngoods and merchandise, to the great injury of trade and ruin of the\r\nprovinces; and did farther dispose of, as his own, the property within\r\nthe said provinces, by granting the same, or parts, thereof, in pensions\r\nto such persons as he thought fit.\r\n\r\n\"That the said Warren Hastings did, some time in the year 1782, enter\r\ninto a clandestine correspondence with William Markham, Esquire, the\r\nthen Resident at Benares, which said Markham had been by him, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, obtruded into the said office, contrary to the positive\r\norders of the Court of Directors; and, in consequence of the\r\nrepresentations of the said Markham, did, under pretence that the new\r\nexcessive rent or tribute was in arrear, and that the affairs of the\r\nprovinces were likely to fall into confusion, authorize and impower him,\r\nby his own private authority, to remove the said Durbege Sing from his\r\noffice and deprive him of his estate.\r\n\r\n\"That the said Durbege Sing was, by the private orders and authorities\r\ngiven by the said Warren Hastings, and in consequence of the\r\nrepresentations aforesaid, violently thrown into prison, and cruelly\r\nconfined therein, under pretence of the non-payment of the arrears of\r\nthe tribute aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"That the widow of Bulwant Sing, and the Rajah Mehip Narrain, did\r\npointedly accuse the said Markham of being the sole cause of any delay\r\nin the payment of the tribute aforesaid, and did offer to prove the\r\ninnocence of the said Durbege Sing, and also to prove that the faults\r\nascribed to him were solely the faults of the said Markham; yet the said\r\nWarren Hastings did pay no regard whatever to the said representations,\r\nnor make any inquiry into the truth of the same, but did accuse the said\r\nwidow of Bulwant Sing and the Rajah aforesaid of gross presumption for\r\nthe same; and, listening to the representations of the person accused,\r\n(viz., the Resident Markham,) did continue to confine the said Durbege\r\nSing in prison, and did invest the Resident Markham with authority to\r\nbestow his office upon whomsoever he pleased.\r\n\r\n\"That the said Markham did bestow the said office of administrator of\r\nthe provinces of Benares upon a certain person named Jagher Deo Seo,\r\nwho, in order to gratify the arbitrary demands of the said Warren\r\nHastings, was obliged greatly to distress and harass the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants of the said provinces.\r\n\r\n\"That the said Warren Hastings did, some time in the year 1784, remove\r\nthe said Jagher Deo Seo from the said office, under pretence of certain\r\nirregularities and oppressions; which irregularities and oppressions are\r\nsolely imputable to him, the said Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"That the consequences of all these violent changes and arbitrary acts\r\nwere the total ruin and desolation of the country, and the flight of the\r\ninhabitants: the said Warren Hastings having found every place abandoned\r\nat his approach, even by the officers of the very government which he\r\nestablished, and seeing nothing but traces of devastation in every\r\nvillage, the provinces in effect without a government, the\r\nadministration misconducted, the people oppressed, trade discouraged,\r\nand the revenue in danger of a rapid decline.\r\n\r\n\"All which destruction, devastation, oppression, and ruin are solely\r\nimputable to the abovementioned and other arbitrary, illegal, unjust,\r\nand tyrannical acts of him, the said Warren Hastings, who, by all and\r\nevery one of the same, was and is guilty of high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\"\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Burke proceeded._]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have heard the charge; and you are now going to see the\r\nprisoner at your bar in a new point of view. I will now endeavor to\r\ndisplay him in his character of a legislator in a foreign land, not\r\naugmenting the territory, honor, and power of Great Britain, and\r\nbringing the acquisition under the dominion of law and liberty, but\r\ndesolating a flourishing country, that to all intents and purposes was\r\nour own,--a country which we had conquered from freedom, from\r\ntranquillity, order, and prosperity, and submitted, through him, to\r\narbitrary power, misrule, anarchy, and ruin. We now see the object of\r\nhis corrupt vengeance utterly destroyed, his family driven from their\r\nhome, his people butchered, his wife and all the females of his family\r\nrobbed and dishonored in their persons, and the effects which husband\r\nand parents had laid up in store for the subsistence of their families,\r\nall the savings of provident economy, distributed amongst a rapacious\r\nsoldiery. His malice is victorious. He has well avenged, in the\r\ndestruction of this unfortunate family, the Rajah's intended visit to\r\nGeneral Clavering; he has well avenged the suspected discovery of his\r\nbribe to Mr. Francis.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all!\"\r\n\r\nLet us see, my Lords, what use he makes of this power,--how he justifies\r\nthe bounty of Fortune, bestowing on him this strange and anomalous\r\nconquest. Anomalous I call it, my Lords, because it was the result of no\r\nplan in the cabinet, no operation in the field. No act or direction\r\nproceeded from him, the responsible chief, except the merciless orders,\r\nand the grant to the soldiery. He lay skulking and trembling in the fort\r\nof Chunar, while the British soldiery entitled themselves to the plunder\r\nwhich he held out to them. Nevertheless, my Lords, he conquers; the\r\ncountry is his own; he treats it as his own. Let us, therefore, see how\r\nthis successor of Tamerlane, this emulator of Genghis Khân, governs a\r\ncountry conquered by the talents and courage of others, without\r\nassistance, guide, direction, or counsel given by himself.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will introduce his first act to your Lordships' notice in\r\nthe words of the charge.\r\n\r\n\"The said Warren Hastings did, some time in the year 1782, enter into a\r\nclandestine correspondence with William Markham, Esquire, the then\r\nResident at Benares; which said Markham had been by him, the said Warren\r\nHastings, obtruded into the said office, contrary to the positive orders\r\nof the Court of Directors.\"\r\n\r\nThis unjustifiable obtrusion, this illegal appointment, shows you at the\r\nvery outset that he defies the laws of his country,--most positively and\r\npointedly defies them. In attempting to give a reason for this defiance,\r\nhe has chosen to tell a branch of the legislature from which originated\r\nthe act which wisely and prudently ordered him to pay implicit obedience\r\nto the Court of Directors, that he removed Mr. Fowke from Benares,\r\ncontrary to the orders of the Court, on political grounds; because, says\r\nhe, \"I thought it necessary the Resident there should be a man of my own\r\nnomination and confidence. I avow the principle, and think no government\r\ncan subsist without it. The punishment of the Rajah made no part of my\r\ndesign in Mr. Fowke's removal or Mr. Markham's appointment, nor was his\r\npunishment an object of my contemplation at the time I removed Mr. Fowke\r\nto appoint Mr. Markham: an appointment of my own choice, and a signal to\r\nnotify the restoration of my own authority; as I had before removed Mr.\r\nFowke and appointed Mr. Graham for the same purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, he does not even pretend that he had any view whatever,\r\nin this appointment of Mr. Markham, but to defy the laws of his country.\r\n\"I must,\" says he, \"have a man of my own nomination, because it is a\r\nsignal to notify the restoration of my own authority, as I had before\r\nremoved Mr. Fowke for the same purpose.\"\r\n\r\nI must beg your Lordships to keep in mind that the greater part of the\r\nobservations with which I shall trouble you have a reference to the\r\n_principles_ upon which this man acts; and I beseech you to remember\r\nalways that you have before you a question and an issue of law; I\r\nbeseech you to consider what it is that you are disposing of,--that you\r\nare not merely disposing of this man and his cause, but that you are\r\ndisposing of the laws of your country.\r\n\r\nYou, my Lords, have made, and we have made, an act of Parliament in\r\nwhich the Council at Calcutta is vested with a special power, distinctly\r\nlimited and defined. He says, \"My authority is absolute. I defy the\r\norders of the Court of Directors, because it is necessary for me to show\r\nthat I can disregard them, as a signal of my own authority.\" He supposes\r\nhis authority gone while he obeys the laws; but, says he, \"the moment I\r\ngot rid of the bonds and barriers of the laws,\" (as if there had been\r\nsome act of violence and usurpation that had deprived him of his\r\nrightful powers,) \"I was restored to my own authority.\" What is this\r\nauthority to which he is restored? Not an authority vested in him by the\r\nEast India Company; not an authority sanctioned by the laws of this\r\nkingdom. It is neither of these, but the authority of Warren Hastings;\r\nan inherent divine right, I suppose, which he has thought proper to\r\nclaim as belonging to himself; something independent of the laws,\r\nsomething independent of the Court of Directors, something independent\r\nof his brethren of the Council. It is \"my own authority.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what is the signal by which you are to know when this authority is\r\nrestored? By his obedience to the Court of Directors?--by his attention\r\nto the laws of his country?--by his regard to the rights of the people?\r\nNo, my Lords, no: the notification of the restoration of this authority\r\nis a formal disobedience of the orders of the Court of Directors. When\r\nyou find the laws of the land trampled upon, and their appointed\r\nauthority despised, then you may be sure that the authority of the\r\nprisoner is reëstablished.\r\n\r\nThere is, my Lords, always a close connection between vices of every\r\ndescription. The man who is a tyrant would, under some other\r\ncircumstances, be a rebel; and he that is a rebel would become a tyrant.\r\nThey are things which originally proceed from the same source. They owe\r\ntheir birth to the wild, unbridled lewdness of arbitrary power. They\r\narise from a contempt of public order, and of the laws and institutions\r\nwhich curb mankind. They arise from a harsh, cruel, and ferocious\r\ndisposition, impatient of the rules of law, order, and morality: and\r\naccordingly, as their relation varies, the man is a tyrant, if a\r\nsuperior, a rebel, if an inferior. But this man, standing in a middle\r\npoint between the two relations, the superior and inferior, declares\r\nhimself at once both a rebel and a tyrant. We therefore naturally\r\nexpect, that, when he has thrown off the laws of his country, he will\r\nthrow off all other authority. Accordingly, in defiance of that\r\nauthority to which he owes his situation, he nominates Mr. Markham to\r\nthe Residency at Benares, and therefore every act of Mr. Markham is his.\r\nHe is responsible,--doubly responsible to what he would have been, if in\r\nthe ordinary course of office he had named this agent. Every governor is\r\nresponsible for the misdemeanors committed under his legal authority for\r\nwhich he does not punish the delinquent; but the prisoner is doubly\r\nresponsible in this case, because he assumed an illegal authority, which\r\ncan be justified only, if at all, by the good resulting from the\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nHaving now chosen his principal instrument and his confidential and sole\r\ncounsellor, having the country entirely in his hand, and every obstacle\r\nthat could impede his course swept out of the arena, what does he do\r\nunder these auspicious circumstances? You would imagine, that, in the\r\nfirst place, he would have sent down to the Council at Calcutta a\r\ngeneral view of his proceedings, and of their consequences, together\r\nwith a complete statement of the revenue; that he would have recommended\r\nthe fittest persons for public trusts, with such other measures as he\r\nmight judge to be most essential to the interest and honor of his\r\nemployers. One would have imagined he would have done this, in order\r\nthat the Council and the Court of Directors might have a clear view of\r\nthe whole existing system, before he attempted to make a permanent\r\narrangement for the administration of the country. But, on the contrary,\r\nthe whole of his proceedings is clandestinely conducted; there is not\r\nthe slightest communication with the Council upon the business, till he\r\nhad determined and settled the whole. Thus the Council was placed in a\r\ncomplete dilemma,--either to confirm all his wicked and arbitrary acts,\r\n(for such we have proved them to be,) or to derange the whole\r\nadministration of the country again, and to make another revolution as\r\ncomplete and dreadful as that which he had made.\r\n\r\nThe task which the Governor-General had imposed upon himself was, I\r\nadmit, a difficult one; but those who pull down important ancient\r\nestablishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration and public\r\ninstitutions under which a country has prospered, are the most\r\nmischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men. It is not a reverse of\r\nfortune, it is not the fall of an individual, that we are here talking\r\nof. We are, indeed, sorry for Cheyt Sing and Durbege Sing, as we should\r\nbe sorry for any individual under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is wisely provided in the constitution of our heart, that we should\r\ninterest ourselves in the fate of great personages. They are therefore\r\nmade everywhere the objects of tragedy, which addresses itself directly\r\nto our passions and our feelings. And why? Because men of great place,\r\nmen of great rank, men of great hereditary authority, cannot fall\r\nwithout a horrible crash upon all about them. Such towers cannot tumble\r\nwithout ruining their dependent cottages.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of a country, that has been distressed by a revolution\r\nwhich has swept off its principal men, cannot be reëstablished without\r\nextreme difficulty. This man, therefore, who wantonly and wickedly\r\ndestroyed the existing government of Benares, was doubly bound to use\r\nall possible care and caution in supplying the loss of those\r\ninstitutions which he had destroyed, and of the men whom he had driven\r\ninto exile. This, I say, he ought to have done. Let us now see what he\r\nreally did do.\r\n\r\nHe set out by disposing of all the property of the country as if it was\r\nhis own. He first confiscated the whole estates of the _Baboos_, the\r\ngreat nobility of the country, to the amount of six lacs of rupees. He\r\nthen distributed the lands and revenue of the country according to his\r\nown pleasure; and as he had seized the lands without our knowing why or\r\nwherefore, so the portion which he took away from some persons he gave\r\nto others, in the same arbitrary manner, and without any assignable\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nWhen we were inquiring what jaghires Mr. Hastings had thought proper to\r\ngrant, we found, to our astonishment, (though it is natural that his\r\nmind should take this turn,) that he endowed several charities with\r\njaghires. He gave a jaghire to some Brahmins to pray for the perpetual\r\nprosperity of the Company, and others to procure the prayers of the same\r\nclass of men for himself. I do not blame his Gentoo piety, when I find\r\nno Christian piety in the man: let him take refuge in any superstition\r\nhe pleases. The crime we charge is his having distributed the lands of\r\nothers at his own pleasure. Whether this proceeded from piety, from\r\nostentation, or from any other motive, it matters not. We contend that\r\nhe ought not to have distributed such land at all,--that he had no\r\nright to do so; and consequently, the gift of a single acre of land, by\r\nhis own private will, was an act of robbery, either from the public or\r\nsome individual.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus disturbed the landed property of Benares, and\r\ndistributed it according to his own will, he thought it would be proper\r\nto fix upon a person to govern the country; and of this person he\r\nhimself made the choice. It does not appear that the people could have\r\nlost, even by the revolt of Cheyt Sing, the right which was inherent in\r\nthem to be governed by the lawful successor of his family. We find,\r\nhowever, that this man, by his own authority, by the arbitrary exercise\r\nof his own will and fancy, did think proper to nominate a person to\r\nsucceed the Rajah who had no legal claims to the succession. He made\r\nchoice of a boy about nineteen years old; and he says he made that\r\nchoice upon the principle of this boy's being descended from Bulwant\r\nSing by the female line. But he does not pretend to say that he was the\r\nproper and natural heir to Cheyt Sing; and we will show you the direct\r\ncontrary. Indeed, he confesses the contrary himself; for he argues, in\r\nhis defence, that, when a new system was to be formed with the successor\r\nof Cheyt Sing who was not his heir, such successor had no claim of\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the want of right was supplied by the capacity and fitness\r\nof the person who was chosen. I do not say that this does or can for one\r\nmoment supersede the positive right of another person; but it would\r\npalliate the injustice in some degree. Was there in this case any\r\npalliative matter? Who was the person chosen by Mr. Hastings to succeed\r\nCheyt Sing? My Lords, the person chosen was a minor: for we find the\r\nprisoner at your bar immediately proceeded to appoint him a guardian.\r\nThis guardian he also chose by his own will and pleasure, as he himself\r\ndeclares, without referring to any particular claim or usage,--without\r\ncalling the Pundits to instruct him, upon whom, by the Gentoo laws, the\r\nguardianship devolved.\r\n\r\nI admit, that, in selecting a guardian, he did not, in one respect, act\r\nimproperly; for he chose the boy's father, and he could not have chosen\r\na better guardian for his person. But for the administration of his\r\ngovernment qualities were required which this man did not possess. He\r\nshould have chosen a man of vigor, capacity, and diligence, a man fit to\r\nmeet the great difficulties of the situation in which he was to be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, my Lords, plainly tells you that he did not think the\r\nman's talents to be extraordinary, and he soon afterwards says that he\r\nhad a great many incapacities. He tells you that he has a doubt whether\r\nhe was capable of realizing those hopes of revenue which he (Mr.\r\nHastings) had formed. Nor can this be matter of wonder, when we consider\r\nthat he had ruined and destroyed the ancient system, the whole scheme\r\nand tenor of public offices, and had substituted nothing for them but\r\nhis own arbitrary will. He had formed a plan of an entire new system, in\r\nwhich the practical details had no reference to the experience and\r\nwisdom of past ages. He did not take the government as he found it; he\r\ndid not take the system of offices as it was arranged to his hand; but\r\nhe dared to make the wicked and flagitious experiment which I have\r\nstated,--an experiment upon the happiness of a numerous people, whose\r\nproperty he had usurped and distributed in the manner which has been\r\nlaid before your Lordships. The attempt failed, and he is responsible\r\nfor the consequences.\r\n\r\nHow dared he to make these experiments? In what manner can he be\r\njustified for playing fast and loose with the dearest interests, and\r\nperhaps with the very existence, of a nation? Attend to the manner in\r\nwhich he justifies himself, and you will find the whole secret let out.\r\n\"The easy accumulation of too much wealth,\" he says, \"had been Cheyt\r\nSing's ruin; it had buoyed him up with extravagant and ill-founded\r\nnotions of independence, which I very much wished to discourage in the\r\nfuture Rajah. Some part, therefore, of the superabundant produce in the\r\ncountry I turned into the coffers of the sovereign by an augmentation of\r\nthe tribute.\"--Who authorized him to make any augmentation of the\r\ntribute? But above all, who authorized him to augment it upon this\r\nprinciple?--\"I must take care the tributary prince does not grow too\r\nrich; if he gets rich, he will get proud.\"--This prisoner has got a\r\nscale like that in the almanac,--\"War begets poverty, poverty peace,\"\r\nand so on. The first rule that he lays down is, that he will keep the\r\nnew Rajah in a state of poverty; because, if he grows rich, he will\r\nbecome proud, and behave as Cheyt Sing did. You see the ground,\r\nfoundation, and spirit of the whole proceeding. Cheyt Sing was to be\r\nrobbed. Why? Because he is too rich. His successor is to be reduced to a\r\nmiserable condition. Why? Lest he should grow rich and become\r\ntroublesome. The whole of his system is to prevent men from growing\r\nrich, lest, if they should grow rich, they should grow proud, and seek\r\nindependence. Your Lordships see that in this man's opinion riches must\r\nbeget pride. I hope your Lordships will never be so poor as to cease to\r\nbe proud; for, ceasing to be proud, you will cease to be independent.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved that the Rajah should not grow rich, for fear he should\r\ngrow proud and independent, he orders him to pay forty lacs of rupees,\r\nor 400,000_l._, annually to the Company. The tribute had before been\r\n250,000_l._, and he all at once raised it to 400,000_l._ Did he\r\npreviously inform the Council of these intentions? Did he inform them of\r\nthe amount of the gross collections of the country, from any properly\r\nauthenticated accounts procured from any public office?\r\n\r\nI need not inform your Lordships, that it is a serious thing to draw out\r\nof a country, instead of 250,000_l._, an annual tribute of 400,000_l._\r\nThere were other persons besides the Rajah concerned in this enormous\r\nincrease of revenue. The whole country is interested in its resources\r\nbeing fairly estimated and assessed; for, if you overrate the revenue\r\nwhich it is supposed to yield to the great general collector, you\r\nnecessitate him to overrate every under-collector, and thereby instigate\r\nthem to harass and oppress the people. It is upon these grounds that we\r\nhave charged the prisoner at your bar with having acted arbitrarily,\r\nillegally, unjustly, and tyrannically: and your Lordships will bear in\r\nmind that these acts were done by his sole authority, which authority we\r\nhave shown to have been illegally assumed.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, before he took the important steps which I have just stated,\r\nhe consulted no one but Mr. Markham, whom he placed over the new Rajah.\r\nThe Rajah was only nineteen years old: but Mr. Markham undoubtedly had\r\nthe advantage of him in this respect, for he was twenty-one. He had also\r\nthe benefit of five months' experience of the country: an abundant\r\nexperience, to be sure, my Lords, in a country where it is well known,\r\nfrom the peculiar character of its inhabitants, that a man cannot\r\nanywhere put his foot without placing it upon some trap or mine, until\r\nhe is perfectly acquainted with its localities. Nevertheless, he puts\r\nthe whole country and a prince of nineteen, as appears from the\r\nevidence, into the hands of Mr. Markham, a man of twenty-one. We have no\r\ndoubt of Mr. Markham's capacity; but he could have no experience in a\r\ncountry over which he possessed a general controlling power. Under these\r\ncircumstances, we surely shall not wonder, if this young man fell into\r\nerror. I do not like to treat harshly the errors into which a very young\r\nperson may fall: but the man who employs him, and puts him into a\r\nsituation for which he has neither capacity nor experience, is\r\nresponsible for the consequences of such an appointment; and Mr.\r\nHastings is doubly responsible in this case, because he placed Mr.\r\nMarkham as Resident merely to show that he defied the authority of the\r\nCourt of Directors.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, let us proceed. We find Mr. Hastings resolved to exact\r\nforty lacs from the country, although he had no proof that such a\r\ntribute could be fairly collected. He next assigns to this boy, the\r\nRajah, emoluments amounting to about 60,000_l._ a year. Let us now see\r\nupon what grounds he can justify the assignment of these emoluments. I\r\ncan perceive none but such as are founded upon the opinion of its being\r\nnecessary to the support of the Rajah's dignity. Now, when Mr. Markham,\r\nwho is the sole ostensible actor in the management of the new Rajah, as\r\nhe had been a witness to the deposition of the former, comes before you\r\nto give an account of what he thought of Cheyt Sing, who appears to have\r\nproperly supported the dignity of his situation, he tells you that about\r\na lac or a lac and a half (10,000_l._ or 15,000_l._) a year was as much\r\nas Cheyt Sing could spend. And yet this young creature, settled in the\r\nsame country, and who was to pay 400,000_l._ a year, instead of\r\n250,000_l._, tribute to the Company, was authorized by Mr. Hastings to\r\ncollect and reserve to his own use 60,000_l._ out of the revenue. That\r\nis to say, he was to receive four times as much as was stated by Mr.\r\nHastings, on Mr. Markham's evidence, to have been necessary to support\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships tread upon corruption everywhere. Why was such a large\r\nrevenue given to the young Rajah to support his dignity, when, as they\r\nsay, Cheyt Sing did not spend above a lac and half in support of\r\nhis,--though it is known he had great establishments to maintain, that\r\nhe had erected considerable buildings adorned with fine gardens, and,\r\naccording to them, had made great preparations for war?\r\n\r\nWe must at length imagine that they knew the country could bear the\r\nimpost imposed upon it. I ask, How did they know this? We have proved to\r\nyou, by a paper presented here by Mr. Markham, that the net amount of\r\nthe collections was about 360,000_l._ This is their own account, and was\r\nmade up, as Mr. Markham says, by one of the clerks of Durbege Sing,\r\ntogether with his Persian moonshee, (a very fine council to settle the\r\nrevenues of the kingdom!) in his private house. And with this account\r\nbefore them, they have dared to impose upon the necks of that unhappy\r\npeople a tribute of 400,000_l._, together with an income for the Rajah\r\nof 60,000_l._ These sums the Naib, Durbege Sing, was bound to furnish,\r\nand left to get them as he could. Your Lordships will observe that I\r\nspeak of the net proceeds of the collections. We have nothing to do with\r\nthe gross amount. We are speaking of what came to the public treasury,\r\nwhich was no more than I have stated; and it was out of the public\r\ntreasury that these payments were to be made, because there could be no\r\nother honest way of getting the money.\r\n\r\nBut let us now come to the main point, which is to ascertain what sums\r\nthe country could really bear. Mr. Hastings maintains (whether in the\r\nspeech of his counsel or otherwise I do not recollect) that the revenue\r\nof the country was 400,000_l._, that it constantly paid that sum, and\r\nflourished under the payment. In answer to this, I refer your Lordships,\r\nfirst, to Mr. Markham's declaration, and the Wassil Baakee, which is in\r\npage 1750 of the printed Minutes. I next refer your Lordships to Mr.\r\nDuncan's Reports, in page 2493. According to Mr. Duncan's public\r\nestimate of the revenue of Benares, the net collections of the very year\r\nwe are speaking of, when Durbege Sing had the management, and when Mr.\r\nMarkham, his Persian moonshee, and a clerk in his private house, made\r\ntheir estimates without any documents, or with whatever documents, or\r\nGod only knows, for nothing appears on the record of the\r\ntransaction,--the collections yielded in that year but 340,000_l._, that\r\nis, 20,000_l._ less than Mr. Markham's estimate. But take it which way\r\nyou will, whether you take it at Mr. Markham's 360,000_l._, or at Mr.\r\nDuncan's 340,000_l._, your Lordships will see, that, after reserving\r\n60,000_l._ for his own private expenses, the Rajah could not realize a\r\nsum nearly equal to the tribute demanded.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have also in evidence before you an account of the\r\nproduce of the country for I believe full five years after this period,\r\nfrom which it appears that it never realized the forty lacs, or anything\r\nlike it,--yielding only thirty-seven and thirty-nine lacs, or\r\nthereabouts, which is 20,000_l._ short of Mr. Markham's estimate, and\r\n160,000_l._ short of Mr. Hastings's. On what data could the prisoner at\r\nyour bar have formed this estimate? Where were all the clerks and\r\nmutsuddies, where were all the men of business in Benares, who could\r\nhave given him complete information upon the subject? We do not find the\r\ntrace of any of them; all our information is Mr. Markham's moonshee, and\r\nsome clerk of Durbege Sing's employed in Mr. Markham's private\r\ncounting-house, in estimating revenues of a country.\r\n\r\nThe disposable revenue was still further reduced by the jaghires which\r\nMr. Hastings granted, but to what amount does not appear. He mentions\r\nthe increase in the revenue by the confiscation of the estates of the\r\nBaboos, who had been in rebellion. This he rates at six lacs. But we\r\nhave inspected the accounts, we have examined them with that sedulous\r\nattention which belongs to that branch of the legislature that has the\r\ncare of the public revenues, and we have not found one trace of this\r\naddition. Whether these confiscations were ever actually made remains\r\ndoubtful; but if they were made, the application or the receipt of the\r\nmoney they yielded does not appear in any account whatever. I leave your\r\nLordships to judge of this.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that Hastings might have been in an error. If he was\r\nin an error, my Lords, his error continued an extraordinary length of\r\ntime. The error itself was also extraordinary in a man of business: it\r\nwas an error of account. If his confidential agent, Mr. Markham, had\r\noriginally contributed to lead him into the error, he soon perceived it.\r\nHe soon informed Mr. Hastings that his expectations were erroneous, and\r\nthat he had overrated the country. What, then, are we to think of his\r\npersevering in this error? Mr. Hastings might have formed extravagant\r\nand wild expectations, when he was going up the country to plunder; for\r\nwe allow that avarice may often overcalculate the hoards that it is\r\ngoing to rob. If a thief is going to plunder a banker's shop, his\r\navarice, when running the risk of his life, may lead him to imagine\r\nthere is more money in the shop than there really is. But when this man\r\nwas in possession of the country, how came he not to know and understand\r\nthe condition of it better? In fact, he was well acquainted with it; for\r\nhe has declared it to be his opinion that forty lacs was an overrated\r\ncalculation, and that the country could not continue to pay this tribute\r\nat the very time he was imposing it. You have this admission in page 294\r\nof the printed Minutes; but in the very face of it he says, if the Rajah\r\nwill exert himself, and continue for some years the regular payment, he\r\nwill then grant him a remission. Thus the Rajah was told, what he well\r\nknew, that he was overrated, but that at some time or another he was to\r\nexpect a remission. And what, my Lords, was the condition upon which he\r\nwas to obtain this promised indulgence? The punctual payment of that\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings declares he was not able to pay,--and which he could\r\nnot pay without ruining the country, betraying his own honor and\r\ncharacter, and acting directly contrary to the duties of the station in\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings had placed him. Thus this unfortunate man was\r\ncompelled to have recourse to the most rigorous exaction, that he might\r\nbe enabled to satisfy the exorbitant demand which had been made upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that the country was able to afford the sum at which\r\nit was assessed, and that nothing was required but vigor and activity in\r\nthe Rajah. Did Mr. Hastings endeavor to make his strength equal to the\r\ntask imposed on him? No: the direct contrary. In proportion as he\r\naugmented the burdens of this man, in just that proportion he took away\r\nhis strength and power of supporting these burdens. There was not one of\r\nthe external marks of honor which attended the government of Cheyt Sing\r\nthat he did not take away from the new Rajah; and still, when this new\r\nman came to his new authority, deprived of all external marks of\r\nconsequence, and degraded in the opinion of his subjects, he was to\r\nextort from his people an additional revenue, payable to the Company, of\r\nfifteen lacs of rupees more than was paid by the late Rajah in all the\r\nplenitude of undivided authority. To increase this difficulty still\r\nmore, the father and guardian of this inexperienced youth was a man who\r\nhad no credit or reputation in the country. This circumstance alone was\r\na sufficient drawback from the weight of his authority; but Mr. Hastings\r\ntook care that he should be divested of it altogether; for, as our\r\ncharge states, he placed him under the immediate direction of Mr.\r\nMarkham, and consequently Mr. Markham was the governor of the country.\r\nCould a man with a reduced, divided, contemptible authority venture to\r\nstrike such bold and hardy strokes as would be efficient without being\r\noppressive? Could he or any other man, thus bound and shackled, execute\r\nsuch vigorous and energetic measures as were necessary to realize such\r\nan enormous tribute as was imposed upon this unhappy country?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must now call your attention to another circumstance, not\r\nmentioned in the charge, but connected with the appointment of the new\r\nRajah, and of his Naib, Durbege Sing, and demonstrative of the unjust\r\nand cruel treatment to which they were exposed. It appears from a letter\r\nproduced here by Mr. Markham, (upon which kind of correspondence I shall\r\ntake the liberty to remark hereafter,) that the Rajah lived in perpetual\r\napprehension of being removed, and that a person called Ussaun Sing was\r\nintended as his successor. Mr. Markham, in one part of his\r\ncorrespondence, tells you that the Rajah did not intend to hold the\r\ngovernment any longer. Why? Upon a point of right, namely, that he did\r\nnot possess it upon the same advantageous terms as Cheyt Sing; but he\r\ntells you in another letter, (and this is a much better key to the whole\r\ntransaction,) that he was in dread of that Ussaun Sing whom I have just\r\nmentioned. This man Mr. Hastings kept ready to terrify the Rajah; and\r\nyou will, in the course of these transactions, see that there is not a\r\nman in India, of any consideration, against whom Mr. Hastings did not\r\nkeep a kind of pretender, to keep him in continual awe. This Ussaun\r\nSing, whom Mr. Hastings brought up with him to Benares, was dreaded by\r\nCheyt Sing not less than by his successor. We find that he was at first\r\nnominated Naib or acting governor of the country, but had never been put\r\nin actual possession of this high office, and Durbege Sing was appointed\r\nto it. Although Ussaun Sing was thus removed, he continued his\r\npretensions, and constantly solicited the office. Thus the poor man\r\nappointed by Mr. Hastings, and actually in possession, was not only\r\ncalled upon to perform tasks beyond his strength, but was overawed by\r\nMr. Markham, and terrified by Ussaun Sing, (the mortal enemy of the\r\nfamily,) who, like an accusing fiend, was continually at his post, and\r\nunceasingly reiterating his accusations. This Ussaun Sing was, as Mr.\r\nMarkham tells you, one of the causes of the Rajah's continued dejection\r\nand despondency. But it does not appear that any of these circumstances\r\nwere ever laid before the Council; the whole passed between Mr. Hastings\r\nand Mr. Markham.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings having by his arbitrary will thus disposed of the revenue\r\nand of the landed property of Benares, we will now trace his further\r\nproceedings and their effects. He found the country most flourishing in\r\nagriculture and in trade; but not satisfied with the experiment he had\r\nmade upon the government, upon the revenues, upon the reigning family,\r\nand upon all the landed property, he resolved to make as bold and as\r\nnovel an experiment upon the commercial interests of the country.\r\nAccordingly he entirely changed that part of the revenue system which\r\naffects trade and commerce, the life and soul of a state. Without any\r\nadvice that we know of, except Mr. Markham's, he sat down to change in\r\nevery point the whole commercial system of that country; and he\r\neffected the change upon the same arbitrary principles which he had\r\nbefore acted upon, namely, his own arbitrary will. We are told, indeed,\r\nthat he consulted bankers and merchants; but when your Lordships shall\r\nhave learned what has happened from this experiment, you will easily see\r\nwhether he did resort to proper sources of information or not. You will\r\nsee that the mischief which has happened has proceeded from the exercise\r\nof arbitrary power. Arbitrary power, my Lords, is always a miserable\r\ncreature. When a man once adopts it as the principle of his actions, no\r\none dares to tell him a truth, no one dares to give him any information\r\nthat is disagreeable to him; for all know that their life and fortune\r\ndepend upon his caprice. Thus the man who lives in the exercise of\r\narbitrary power condemns himself to eternal ignorance. Of this the\r\nprisoner at your bar affords us a striking example. This man, without\r\nadvice, without assistance, and without resource, except in his own\r\narbitrary power, stupidly ignorant in himself, and puffed up with the\r\nconstant companion of ignorance, a blind presumption, alters the system\r\nof commercial imposts, and thereby ruined the whole trade of the\r\ncountry, leaving no one part of it undestroyed.\r\n\r\nLet me now call your Lordships' attention to his assumption of power,\r\nwithout one word of communication with the Council at Calcutta, where\r\nthe whole of these trading regulations might and ought to have been\r\nconsidered, and where they could have been deliberately examined and\r\ndetermined upon. By this assumption the Council was placed in the\r\nsituation which I have before described: it must either confirm his\r\nacts, or again undo everything which had been done. He had provided not\r\nonly against resistance, but almost against any inquiry into his wild\r\nprojects. He had by his opium contracts put all vigilance asleep, and by\r\nhis bullock and other contracts he had secured a variety of concealed\r\ninterests, both abroad and at home. He was sure of the ratification of\r\nhis acts by the Council, whenever he should please to inform them of his\r\nmeasures; and to his secret influence he trusted for impunity in his\r\ncareer of tyranny and oppression.\r\n\r\nIn bringing before you his arbitrary mode of imposing duties, I beg to\r\nremind your Lordships, that, when I examined Mr. Markham concerning the\r\nimposing of a duty of five per cent instead of the former duty of two, I\r\nasked him whether that five per cent was not laid on in such a manner as\r\nutterly to extinguish the trade, and whether it was not in effect and\r\nsubstance five times as much as had been paid before. What was his\r\nanswer? Why, that many plans, which, when considered in the closet, look\r\nspecious and plausible, will not hold when they come to be tried in\r\npractice, and that this plan was one of them. The additional duties,\r\nsaid he, have never since been exacted. But, my Lords, the very attempt\r\nto exact them utterly ruined the trade of the country. They were imposed\r\nupon a visionary theory, formed in his own closet, and the result was\r\nexactly what might have been anticipated. Was it not an abominable thing\r\nin Mr. Hastings to withhold from the Council the means of ascertaining\r\nthe real operation of his taxes? He had no knowledge of trade himself;\r\nhe cannot keep an account; he has no memory. In fact, we find him a man\r\npossessed of no one quality fit for any kind of business whatever. We\r\nfind him pursuing his own visionary projects, without knowing anything\r\nof the nature or [of?] the circumstances under which the trade of the\r\ncountry was carried on. These projects might have looked very plausible:\r\nbut when you come to examine the actual state of the trade, it is not\r\nmerely a difference between five and two per cent, but it becomes a\r\ndifferent mode of estimating the commodity, and it amounts to five times\r\nas much as was paid before. We bring this as an exemplification of this\r\ncursed mode of arbitrary proceeding, and to show you his total ignorance\r\nof the subject, and his total indifference about the event of the\r\nmeasure he was pursuing. When he began to perceive his blunders, he\r\nnever took any means whatever to put the new regulations which these\r\nblunders had made necessary into execution, but he left all this\r\nmischievous project to rage in its full extent.\r\n\r\nI have shown your Lordships how he managed the private property of the\r\ncountry, how he managed the government, and how he managed the trade. I\r\nam now to call your Lordships' attention to some of the consequences\r\nwhich have resulted from the instances of management, or rather gross\r\nmismanagement, which have been brought before you. Your Lordships will\r\nrecollect that none of these violent and arbitrary measures, either in\r\ntheir conception or in the progress of their execution, were officially\r\nmade known to the Council; and you will observe, as we proved, that the\r\nsame criminal concealment existed with respect to the fatal consequences\r\nof these acts.\r\n\r\nAfter the flight of Cheyt Sing, the revenues were punctually paid by the\r\nNaib, Durbege Sing, month by month, kist by kist, until the month of\r\nJuly, and then, as the country had suffered some distress, the Naib\r\nwished this kist, or instalment, to be thrown on the next month. You\r\nwill ask why he wished to burden this month beyond the rest. I reply,\r\nThe reason was obvious: the month of August is the last of the year, and\r\nhe would, at its expiration, have the advantage of viewing the receipts\r\nof the whole year, and ascertaining the claim of the country to the\r\nremission of a part of the annual tribute which Mr. Hastings had\r\npromised, provided the instalments were paid regularly. It was well\r\nknown to everybody that the country had suffered very considerably by\r\nthe revolt, and by a drought which prevailed that year. The Rajah,\r\ntherefore, expected to avail himself of Mr. Hastings's flattering\r\npromise, and to save by the delay the payment of one of the two kists.\r\nBut mark the course that was taken. The two kists were at once demanded\r\nat the end of the year, and no remission of tribute was allowed. By the\r\npromise of remission Mr. Hastings tacitly acknowledged that the Rajah\r\nwas overburdened; and he admits that the payment of the July kist was\r\npostponed at the Rajah's own desire. He must have seen the Rajah's\r\nmotive for desiring delay, and he ought to have taken care that this\r\npoor man should not be oppressed and ruined by this compliance with\r\nrequests founded on such motives.\r\n\r\nSo passed the year 1781. No complaints of arrears in Durbege Sing's\r\npayments appear on record before the month of April, 1782; and I wish\r\nyour Lordships seriously to advert to the circumstances attending the\r\nevidence respecting these arrears, which has been produced for the first\r\ntime by the prisoner in his defence here at your bar. This evidence does\r\nnot appear in the Company's records; it does not appear in the book of\r\nthe Benares correspondence; it does not appear in any documents to which\r\nthe Commons could have access; it was unknown to the Directors, unknown\r\nto the Council, unknown to the Residents, Mr. Markham's successors, at\r\nBenares, unknown to the searching and inquisitive eye of the Commons of\r\nGreat Britain. This important evidence was drawn out of Mr. Markham's\r\npocket, in the presence of your Lordships. It consists of a private\r\ncorrespondence which he carried on with Mr. Hastings, unknown to the\r\nCouncil, after Durbege Sing had been appointed Naib, after the new\r\ngovernment had been established, after Mr. Hastings had quitted that\r\nprovince, and had apparently wholly abandoned it, and when there was no\r\nreason whatever why the correspondence should not be public. This\r\nprivate correspondence of Mr. Markham's, now produced for the first\r\ntime, is full of the bitterest complaints against Durbege Sing. These\r\nclandestine complaints, these underhand means of accomplishing the ruin\r\nof a man, without the knowledge of his true and proper judges, we\r\nproduce to your Lordships as a heavy aggravation of our charge, and as a\r\nproof of a wicked conspiracy to destroy the man. For if there was any\r\ndanger of his falling into arrears when the heavy accumulated kists came\r\nupon him, the Council ought to have known that danger; they ought to\r\nhave known every particular of these complaints: for Mr. Hastings had\r\nthen carried into effect his own plans.\r\n\r\nI ought to have particularly marked for your Lordships' attention this\r\nsecond era of clandestine correspondence between Mr. Hastings and Mr.\r\nMarkham. It commenced after Mr. Hastings had quitted Benares, and had\r\nnothing to do with it but as Governor-General: even after his\r\nextraordinary, and, as we contend, illegal, power had completely\r\nexpired, the same clandestine correspondence was carried on. He\r\napparently considered Benares as his private property; and just as a man\r\nacts with his private steward about his private estate, so he acted with\r\nthe Resident at Benares. He receives from him and answers letters\r\ncontaining a series of complaints against Durbege Sing, which began in\r\nApril and continued to the month of November, without making any public\r\ncommunication of them. He never laid one word of this correspondence\r\nbefore the Council until the 29th of November, and he had then\r\ncompletely settled the fate of this Durbege Sing.\r\n\r\nThis clandestine correspondence we charge against him as an act of\r\nrebellion; for he was bound to lay before the Council the whole of his\r\ncorrespondence relative to the revenue and all the other affairs of the\r\ncountry. We charge it not only as rebellion against the orders of the\r\nCompany and the laws of the land, but as a wicked plot to destroy this\r\nman, by depriving him of any opportunity of defending himself before the\r\nCouncil, his lawful judges. I wish to impress it strongly on your\r\nLordships' minds, that neither the complaints of Mr. Markham nor the\r\nexculpations of Durbege Sing were ever made known till Mr. Markham was\r\nexamined in this hall.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation afforded the Council of what had been going on at\r\nBenares from April, 1782, at which time, Mr. Markham says, the\r\ncomplaints against Durbege Sing had risen to serious importance, was in\r\na letter dated the 27th of November following. This letter was sent to\r\nthe Council from Nia Serai, in the Ganges, where Mr. Hastings had\r\nretired for the benefit of the air. During the whole time he was in\r\nCalcutta, it does not appear upon the records that he had ever held any\r\ncommunication with the Council upon the subject. The letter is in the\r\nprinted Minutes, page 298, and is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"_The Governor-General._--I desire the Secretary to lay the accompanying\r\nletters from Mr. Markham before the board, and request that orders may\r\nbe immediately sent to him concerning the subjects contained in them. It\r\nmay be necessary to inform the board, that, on repeated information from\r\nMr. Markham, which indeed was confirmed to me beyond a doubt by other\r\nchannels, and by private assurances which I could trust, that the\r\naffairs of that province were likely to fall into the greatest confusion\r\nfrom the misconduct of Baboo Durbege Sing, whom I had appointed the\r\nNaib, fearing the dangerous consequences of a delay, and being at too\r\ngreat a distance to consult the members of the board, who I knew could\r\nrepose that confidence in my local knowledge as to admit of this\r\noccasional exercise of my own separate authority, I wrote to Mr. Markham\r\nthe letter to which he alludes, dated the 29th of September last, of\r\nwhich I now lay before the board a copy. The first of the accompanying\r\nletters from Mr. Markham arrived at a time when a severe return of my\r\nlate illness obliged me, by the advice of my physicians, to leave\r\nCalcutta for the benefit of the country air, and prevented me from\r\nbringing it earlier before the notice of the board.\"\r\n\r\nI have to remark upon this part of the letter, that he claims for\r\nhimself an exercise of his own authority. He had now no delegation, and\r\ntherefore no claim to separate authority. He was only a member of the\r\nboard, obliged to do everything according to the decision of the\r\nmajority, and yet he speaks of his own separate authority; and after\r\ncomplimenting himself, he requests its confirmation. The complaints of\r\nMr. Markham had been increasing, growing, and multiplying upon him, from\r\nthe month of April preceding, and he had never given the least\r\nintimation of it to the board until he wrote this letter. This was at so\r\nlate a period that he then says, \"The time won't wait for a remedy; I am\r\nobliged to use my own separate authority\"; although he had had abundant\r\ntime for laying the whole matter before the Council.\r\n\r\nHe next goes on to say,--\"It had, indeed, been my intention, but for the\r\nsame cause, to have requested the instructions of the board for the\r\nconduct of Mr. Markham in the difficulties which he had to encounter\r\nimmediately after the date of my letter to him, and to have recommended\r\nthe substance of it for an order to the board.\" He seems to have\r\npromised Mr. Markham, that, if the violent act which Mr. Markham\r\nproposed, and which he, Mr. Hastings, ordered, was carried into\r\nexecution, an authority should be procured from the board. He, however,\r\ndid not get Mr. Markham such an authority. Why? Because he was resolved,\r\nas he has told you, to act by his own separate authority; and because,\r\nas he has likewise told you, that he disobeys the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, and defies the laws of his country, as a signal of his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nNow what does he recommend to the board? That it will be pleased to\r\nconfirm the appointment which Mr. Markham made in obedience to his\r\nindividual orders, as well as the directions which he had given him to\r\nexact from Baboo Durbege Sing with the utmost rigor every rupee of the\r\ncollections, and either to confine him at Benares or send him to Chunar\r\nand imprison him there until the whole of his arrears were paid up.\r\nHere, then, my Lords, you have, what plainly appears in every act of Mr.\r\nHastings, a feeling of resentment for some personal injury. \"I feel\r\nmyself,\" says he, \"and may be allowed on such an occasion to acknowledge\r\nit, personally hurt at the ingratitude of this man, and the discredit\r\nwhich his ill conduct has thrown on my appointment of him. The Rajah\r\nhimself, scarcely arrived at the verge of manhood, was in understanding\r\nbut little advanced beyond the term of childhood; and it had been the\r\npolicy of Cheyt Sing to keep him equally secluded from the world and\r\nfrom business.\" This is the character Mr. Hastings gives of a man whom\r\nhe appointed to govern the country. He goes on to say of Durbege\r\nSing,--\"As he was allowed a jaghire of a very liberal amount, to enable\r\nhim to maintain a state and consequence suitable both to the relation in\r\nwhich he stood to the Rajah and the high office which had been assigned\r\nto him, and sufficient also to free him from the temptation of little\r\nand mean peculations, it is therefore my opinion, and I recommend, that\r\nMr. Markham be ordered to divest him of his jaghire, and reunite it to\r\nthe _malguzaree_, or the land paying its revenue through the Rajah to\r\nthe Company. The opposition made by the Rajah and the old Ranny, both\r\nequally incapable of judging for themselves, do certainly originate from\r\nsome secret influence which ought to be checked by a decided and\r\nperemptory declaration of the authority of the board, and a denunciation\r\nof their displeasure at their presumption. If they can be induced to\r\nyield the appearance of a cheerful acquiescence in the new arrangement,\r\nand to adopt it as a measure formed with their participation, it would\r\nbe better than that it should be done by a declared act of compulsion;\r\nbut at all events it ought to be done.\" My Lords, it had been already\r\ndone: the Naib was dismissed; he was imprisoned; his jaghire was\r\nconfiscated: all these things were done by Mr. Hastings's orders. He had\r\nresolved to take the whole upon himself; he had acted upon that\r\nresolution before he addressed this letter to the board.\r\n\r\nThus, my Lords, was this unhappy man punished without any previous\r\ntrial, or any charges, except the complaints of Mr. Markham, and some\r\nother private information which Mr. Hastings said he had received.\r\nBefore the poor object of these complaints could make up his accounts,\r\nbefore a single step was taken, judicially or officially, to convict him\r\nof any crime, he was sent to prison, and his private estates\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Commons of Great Britain claim from you, that no man shall\r\nbe imprisoned till a regular charge is made against him, and the accused\r\nfairly heard in his defence. They claim from you, that no man shall be\r\nimprisoned on a matter of account, until the account is settled between\r\nthe parties. And claiming this, we do say that the prisoner's conduct\r\ntowards Durbege Sing was illegal, unjust, violent, and oppressive. The\r\nimprisonment of this man was clearly illegal on the part of Mr.\r\nHastings, as he acted without the authority of the Council, and doubly\r\noppressive, as the imprisoned man was thereby disabled from settling his\r\naccount with the numberless sub-accountants whom he had to deal with in\r\nthe collection of the revenue.\r\n\r\nHaving now done with these wicked, flagitious, abandoned, and abominable\r\nacts, I shall proceed to the extraordinary powers given by Mr. Hastings\r\nto his instrument, Mr. Markham, who was employed in perpetrating these\r\nacts, and to the very extraordinary instructions which he gave this\r\ninstrument for his conduct in the execution of the power intrusted to\r\nhim. In a letter to Mr. Markham, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you, my dear Sir, that I possess a very high opinion of\r\nyour abilities, and that I repose the utmost confidence in your\r\nintegrity.\" He might have had reason for both, but he scarcely left to\r\nMr. Markham the use of either. He arbitrarily imposed upon him the tasks\r\nwhich he wished him to execute, and he engaged to bear out his acts by\r\nhis own power. \"From your long residence at Benares,\" says he, \"and from\r\nthe part you have had in the business of that zemindary, you must\r\ncertainly best know the men who are most capable and deserving of public\r\nemployment. From among these I authorize you to nominate a Naib to the\r\nRajah, in the room of Durbege Sing, whom, on account of his ill conduct,\r\nI think it necessary to dismiss from that office. It will be hardly\r\nnecessary to except Ussaun Sing from the description of men to whom I\r\nhave limited your choice, yet it may not be improper to apprise you that\r\nI will on no terms consent to his being Naib. In forming the\r\narrangements consequent upon this new appointment, I request you will,\r\nas far as you can with propriety, adopt those which were in use during\r\nthe life of Bulwant Sing,--so far, at least, as to have distinct offices\r\nfor distinct purposes, independent of each other, and with proper men at\r\nthe head of each; so that one office may detect or prevent any abuses\r\nor irregularities in the others, and together form a system of\r\nreciprocal checks. Upon that principle, I desire you will in particular\r\nestablish, under whatever names, one office of receipts, and another of\r\ntreasury. The officers of both must be responsible for the truth and\r\nregularity of their respective accounts, but not subject in the\r\nstatement of them to the control or interference of the Rajah or Naib;\r\nnor should they be removable at pleasure, but for manifest misconduct\r\nonly. At the head of one or other of these offices I could wish to see\r\nthe late Buckshee, Rogoober Dyall. His conduct in his former office, his\r\nbehavior on the revolt of Cheyt Sing, and particularly at the fall of\r\nBidjegur, together with his general character, prove him worthy of\r\nemployment, and of the notice of our government. It is possible that he\r\nmay have objections to holding an office under the present Rajah: offer\r\nhim one, however, and let him know that you do so by my directions.\" He\r\nthen goes on to say,--\"Do not wholly neglect the Rajah; consult with him\r\nin appearance, but in appearance only. His situation requires that you\r\nshould do that much; but his youth and inexperience forbid that you\r\nshould do more.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, he has completely put the whole government into the\r\nhands of a man who had no name, character, or official situation, but\r\nthat of the Company's Resident at that place. Let us now see what is the\r\noffice of a Resident. It is to reside at the court of the native prince,\r\nto give the Council notice of the transactions that are going on there,\r\nand to take care that the tribute be regularly paid, kist by kist. But\r\nwe have seen that Mr. Markham, the Resident at Benares, was invested by\r\nMr. Hastings with supreme authority in this unhappy country. He was to\r\nname whoever he pleased to its government, with the exception of Ussaun\r\nSing, and to drive out the person who had possessed it under an\r\nauthority which could only be revoked by the Council. Thus Mr. Hastings\r\ndelegated to Mr. Markham an authority which he himself did not really\r\npossess, and which could only be legally exercised through the medium of\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Durbege Sing, he adds,--\"He has dishonored my choice of\r\nhim.\" _My_ choice of him! \"It now only remains to guard against the ill\r\neffects of his misconduct, to detect and punish it. To this end I desire\r\nthat the officers to be appointed in consequence of these instructions\r\ndo, with as much accuracy and expedition as possible, make out an\r\naccount of the receipts, disbursements, and transactions of Durbege\r\nSing, during the time he has acted as Naib of the zemindary of Benares;\r\nand I desire you will, in my name, assure him, that, unless he pays at\r\nthe limited time every rupee of the revenue due to the Company, his life\r\nshall answer for the default. I need not caution you to provide against\r\nhis flight, and the removal of his effects.\" He here says, my Lords,\r\nthat he will detect and punish him; but the first thing he does, without\r\nany detection, even before the accounts he talks of are made up, and\r\nwithout knowing whether he has got the money or not, he declares that he\r\nwill have every rupee paid at the time, or otherwise the Naib's life\r\nshall pay for it.\r\n\r\nIs this the language of a British governor,--of a person appointed to\r\ngovern _by law_ nations subject to the dominion and under the protection\r\nof this kingdom? Is he to order a man to be first imprisoned and\r\ndeprived of his property, then, for an inquiry to be made, and to\r\ndeclare, during that inquiry, that, if every rupee of a presumed\r\nembezzlement be not paid up, the life of his victim shall answer for it?\r\nAnd accordingly this man's life did answer for it,--as I have already\r\nhad occasion to mention to your Lordships.\r\n\r\nI will now read Mr. Markham's letter to the Council, in which he enters\r\ninto the charges against Durbege Sing, after this unhappy man had been\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nBenares, 24th of October, 1782.--\"I am sorry that my duty obliges me to\r\nmention to your Honorable Board my apprehensions of a severe loss\r\naccruing to the Honorable Company, if Baboo Durbege Sing is continued in\r\nthe Naibut during the present year. I ground my fears on the knowledge I\r\nhave had of his mismanagement, the bad choice he has made of his aumils,\r\nthe mistrust which they have of him, and the several complaints which\r\nhave been preferred to me by the ryots of almost every purgunnah in the\r\nzemindary. I did not choose to waste the time of your Honorable Board in\r\nlistening to my representations of his inattention to the complaints of\r\noppression which were made to him by his ryots, as I hoped that a letter\r\nhe received from the Honorable Governor-General would have had weight\r\nsufficient to have made him more regular in his business, and more\r\ncareful of his son's interest.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, think of the condition of your government in India! Here is a\r\nResident at Benares exercising power not given to him by virtue of his\r\noffice, but given only by the private orders of the prisoner at your\r\nbar. And what is it he does? He says, he did not choose to trouble the\r\nCouncil with a particular account of his reasons for removing a man who\r\npossessed an high office under their immediate appointment. The Council\r\nwas not to know them: he did not choose to waste the time of their\r\nhonorable board in listening to the complaints of the people. No: the\r\nhonorable board is not to have its time wasted in that improper manner;\r\ntherefore, without the least inquiry or inquisition, the man must be\r\nimprisoned, and deprived of his office; he must have all his property\r\nconfiscated, and be threatened with the loss of his life.\r\n\r\nThese are crimes, my Lords, for which the Commons of Great Britain knock\r\nat the breasts of your consciences, and call for justice. They would\r\nthink themselves dishonored forever, if they had not brought these\r\ncrimes before your Lordships, and with the utmost energy demanded your\r\nvindictive justice, to the fullest extent in which it can be rendered.\r\n\r\nBut there are some aggravating circumstances in these crimes, which I\r\nhave not yet stated. It appears that this unhappy and injured man was,\r\nwithout any solicitation of his own, placed in a situation the duties of\r\nwhich even Mr. Hastings considered it impossible for him to execute.\r\nInstead of supporting him with the countenance of the supreme\r\ngovernment, Mr. Hastings did everything to lessen his weight, his\r\nconsequence, and authority. And when the business of the collection\r\nbecame embarrassed, without any fault of his, that has ever yet been\r\nproved, Mr. Markham instituted an inquiry. What kind of inquiry it was\r\nthat would or could be made your Lordships will judge. While this was\r\ngoing on, Mr. Markham tells you, that, in consequence of orders which\r\nhe had received, he first put him into a gentle confinement. Your\r\nLordships know what that confinement was; and you know what it is for a\r\nman of his rank to be put into any confinement. We have shown he was\r\nthereby incapable of transacting business. His life had been threatened,\r\nif he should not pay in the balance of his accounts within a short\r\nlimited time; still he was subjected to confinement, while he had money\r\naccounts to settle with the whole country. Could a man in gaol,\r\ndishonored and reprobated, take effectual means to recover the arrears\r\nwhich he was called upon to pay? Could he, in such a situation, recover\r\nthe money which was unpaid to him, in such an extensive district as\r\nBenares? Yet Mr. Markham tells the Council he thought proper \"that\r\nDurbege Sing should be put under a gentle confinement, until I shall\r\nreceive your Honorable Board's orders for any future measures.\" Thus Mr.\r\nMarkham, without any orders from the Council, assumed an authority to do\r\nthat which we assert a Resident at Benares had no right to do, but to\r\nwhich he was instigated by Mr. Hastings's recommendation that Durbege\r\nSing should be prevented from flight.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, was it to be expected that a man of Durbege Sing's rank\r\nshould suffer these hardships and indignities, and at the same time kiss\r\nthe rod and say, \"I have deserved it all\"? We know that all mankind\r\nrevolts at oppression, if it be real; we know that men do not willingly\r\nsubmit to punishment, just or unjust; and we find that Durbege Sing had\r\nnear relatives, who used for his relief all the power which was left\r\nthem,--that of remonstrating with his oppressors. Two _arzees_, or\r\npetitions, were presented to the Council, of which we shall first call\r\nyour Lordships' attention to one from the dowager princess of Benares,\r\nin favor of her child and of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _From the Ranny, widow of Bulwant Sing. Received the 15th of\r\n    December, 1782._\r\n\r\n    \"I and my children have no hopes but from your Highness, and our\r\n    honor and rank are bestowed by you. Mr. Markham, from the advice of\r\n    my enemies, having protected the farmers, would not permit the\r\n    balances to be collected. Baboo Durbege Sing frequently before\r\n    desired that gentleman to show his resentment against the people who\r\n    owed balances, that the balances might be collected, and to give\r\n    ease to his mind for the present year, conformably to the requests\r\n    signed by the presence, that he might complete the _bundobust_. But\r\n    that gentleman would not listen to him, and, having appointed a\r\n    _mutsuddy_ and _tahsildar_, employs them in the collections of the\r\n    year, and sent two companies of sepoys and arrested Baboo Durbege\r\n    Sing upon this charge, that he had secreted in his house many lacs\r\n    of rupees from the collections, and he carried the mutsuddies and\r\n    treasurer with their papers to his own presence. He neither\r\n    ascertained this matter by proofs, nor does he complete the balance\r\n    of the sircar from the _jaidads_ of the balances: right or wrong, he\r\n    is resolved to destroy our lives. As we have no asylum or hope\r\n    except from your Highness, and as the Almighty has formed your mind\r\n    to be a distributor of justice in these times, I therefore hope from\r\n    the benignity of your Highness, that you will inquire and do justice\r\n    in this matter, and that an _aumeen_ may be appointed from the\r\n    presence, that, having discovered the crimes or innocence of Baboo\r\n    Durbege Sing, he may report to the presence. Further particulars\r\n    will be made known to your Highness by the arzee of my son Rajah\r\n    Mehip Narrain Bahadur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Arzee from Rajah Mehip Narrain Bahadur. Received 15th December,\r\n    1782._\r\n\r\n    \"I before this had the honor of addressing several arzees to your\r\n    presence; but, from my unfortunate state, not one of them has been\r\n    perused by your Highness, that my situation might be fully learnt by\r\n    you. The case is this. Mr. Markham, from the advice of my enemies,\r\n    having occasioned several kinds of losses, and given protection to\r\n    those who owed balances, prevented the balance from being\r\n    collected,--for this reason, that, the money not being paid in time,\r\n    the Baboo might be convicted of inability. From this reason, all the\r\n    owers of balances refused to pay the _malwajib_ of the sircar.\r\n    Before this, the Baboo had frequently desired that gentleman to show\r\n    his resentment against the persons who owed the balances, that the\r\n    balances might be paid, and that his mind might be at ease for the\r\n    present year, so that the _bundobust_ of the present year might be\r\n    completed,--adding, that, if, next year, such kinds of injuries, and\r\n    protection of the farmers, were to happen, he should not be able to\r\n    support it.\"\r\n\r\nI am here to remark to your Lordships, that the last of these petitions\r\nbegins by stating, \"I before this have had the honor of addressing\r\nseveral arzees to your presence; but, from my unfortunate state, not one\r\nof them has been perused by your Highness.\" My Lords, if there is any\r\none right secured to the subject, it is that of presenting a petition\r\nand having that petition noticed. This right grows in importance in\r\nproportion to the power and despotic nature of the governments to which\r\nthe petitioner is subject: for where there is no sort of remedy from any\r\nfixed laws, nothing remains but complaint, and prayers, and petitions.\r\nThis was the case in Benares: for Mr. Hastings had destroyed every trace\r\nof law, leaving only the police of the single city of Benares. Still we\r\nfind this complaint, prayer, and petition was not the first, but only\r\none of many, which Mr. Hastings took no notice of, entirely despised,\r\nand never would suffer to be produced to the Council; which never knew\r\nanything, until this bundle of papers came before them, of the complaint\r\nof Mr. Markham against Durbege Sing, or of the complaint of Durbege Sing\r\nagainst Mr. Markham.\r\n\r\nObserve, my Lords, the person that put Durbege Sing in prison was Mr.\r\nMarkham; while the complaint in the arzee is, that Mr. Markham was\r\nhimself the cause of the very failure for which he imprisoned him. Now\r\nwhat was the conduct of Mr. Hastings as judge? He has two persons before\r\nhim: the one in the ostensible care of the revenue of the country; the\r\nother his own agent, acting under his authority. The first is accused by\r\nthe second of default in his payments; the latter is complained of by\r\nthe former, who says that the occasion of the accusation had been\r\nfurnished by him, the accuser. The judge, instead of granting redress,\r\ndismisses the complaints against Mr. Markham with reprehension, and\r\nsends the complainant to rot in prison, without making one inquiry, or\r\ngiving himself the trouble of stating to Mr. Markham the complaints\r\nagainst him, and desiring him to clear himself from them. My Lords, if\r\nthere were nothing but this to mark the treacherous and perfidious\r\nnature of his conduct, this would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, Mr. Hastings thus writes.\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. Markham. The measures which you have taken with Baboo Durbege\r\nSing are perfectly right and proper, so far as they go; and we now\r\ndirect that you exact from him, with the utmost rigor, every rupee of\r\nthe collections which it shall appear that he has made and not brought\r\nto account, and either confine him at Benares, or send him prisoner to\r\nChunar, and keep him in confinement until he shall have discharged the\r\nwhole of the amount due from him.\"\r\n\r\nHe here employs the very person against whom the complaint is made to\r\nimprison the complainant. He approves the conduct of his agent without\r\nhaving heard his defence, and leaves him, at his option, to keep his\r\nvictim a prisoner at Benares, or to imprison him in the fortress of\r\nChunar, the infernal place to which he sends the persons whom he has a\r\nmind to extort money from.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will be curious to know how this debt of Durbege Sing\r\nstood at the time of his imprisonment. I will state the matter to your\r\nLordships briefly, and in plain language, referring you for the\r\nparticulars of the account to the papers which are in your Minutes. It\r\nappears from them, that, towards the end of the yearly account in 1782,\r\na kist or payment of eight lacs (about 80,000_l._), the balance of the\r\nannual tribute, was due. In part of this kist, Durbege Sing paid two\r\nlacs (20,000_l._). Of the remaining six lacs (60,000_l._), the\r\noutstanding debts in the country due to the revenue, but not collected\r\nby the Naib, amounted to four lacs (40,000_l._). Thus far the account\r\nis not controverted by the accusing party. But Mr. Markham asserts that\r\nhe _shall_ be able to prove that the Naib had also actually received the\r\nother two lacs (20,000_l._), and consequently was an actual defaulter to\r\nthat amount, and had, upon the whole, suffered the annual tribute to\r\nfall six lacs in arrear. The Naib denies the receipt of the two lacs\r\njust mentioned, and challenges inquiry; but no inquiries appear to have\r\nbeen made, and to this hour Mr. Markham has produced no proof of the\r\nfact. With respect to the arrear of the tribute money which appeared on\r\nthe balance of the whole account, the Naib defended himself by alleging\r\nthe distresses of the country, the diminution of his authority, and the\r\nwant of support from the supreme government in the collection of the\r\nrevenues; and he asserts that he has assets sufficient, if time and\r\npower be allowed him for collecting them, to discharge the whole balance\r\ndue to the Company. The immediate payment of the whole balance was\r\ndemanded, and Durbege Sing, unable to comply with the demand, was sent\r\nto prison. Thus stood the business, when Mr. Markham, soon after he had\r\nsent the Naib to prison, quitted the Residency. He was succeeded by Mr.\r\nBenn, who acted exactly upon the same principle. He declares that the\r\nsix lacs demanded were not demanded upon the principle of its having\r\nbeen actually collected by him, but upon the principle of his having\r\nagreed to pay it. \"We have,\" say Mr. Hastings's agents to the Naib, \"we\r\nhave a Jew's bond. If it is in your bond, we will have it, or we will\r\nhave a pound of your flesh: whether you have received it or not is no\r\nbusiness of ours.\" About this time some hopes were entertained by the\r\nResident that the Naib's personal exertions in collecting the arrears of\r\nthe tribute might be useful. These hopes procured him a short liberation\r\nfrom his confinement. He was let out of prison, and appears to have made\r\nanother payment of half a lac of rupees. Still the terms of the bond\r\nwere insisted on, although Mr. Hastings had allowed that these terms\r\nwere extravagant, and only one lac and a half of the money which had\r\nbeen actually received remained unpaid. One would think that common\r\ncharity, that common decency, that common regard to the decorum of life\r\nwould, under such circumstances, have hindered Mr. Hastings from\r\nimprisoning him again. But, my Lords, he was imprisoned again; he\r\ncontinued in prison till Mr. Hastings quitted the country; and there he\r\nsoon after died,--a victim to the enormous oppression which has been\r\ndetailed to your Lordships.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the mean time the Residents had been using other\r\nmeans for recovering the balance due to the Company. The family of the\r\nRajah had not been paid one shilling of the 60,000_l._, allowed for\r\ntheir maintenance. They were obliged to mortgage their own hereditary\r\nestates for their support, while the Residents confiscated all the\r\nproperty of Durbege Sing. Of the money thus obtained what account has\r\nbeen given? None, my Lords, none. It must therefore have been disposed\r\nof in some abominably corrupt way or other, while this miserable victim\r\nof Mr. Hastings was left to perish in a prison, after he had been\r\nelevated to the highest rank in the country.\r\n\r\nBut, without doubt, they found abundance of effects after his death? No,\r\nmy Lords, they did not find anything. They ransacked his house; they\r\nexamined all his accounts, every paper that he had, in and out of\r\nprison. They searched and scrutinized everything. They had every penny\r\nof his fortune, and I believe, though I cannot with certainty know, that\r\nthe man died insolvent; and it was not pretended that he had ever\r\napplied to his own use any part of the Company's money.\r\n\r\nThus Durbege Sing is gone; this tragedy is finished; a second Rajah of\r\nBenares has been destroyed. I do not speak of that miserable puppet who\r\nwas said by Mr. Hastings to be in a state of childhood when arrived at\r\nmanhood, but of the person who represented the dignity of the family. He\r\nis gone; he is swept away; and in his name, in the name of this devoted\r\nDurbege Sing, in the name of his afflicted family, in the name of the\r\npeople of the country thus oppressed by an usurped authority, in the\r\nname of all these, respecting whom justice has been thus outraged, we\r\ncall upon your Lordships for justice.\r\n\r\nWe are now at the commencement of a new order of things. Mr. Markham had\r\nbeen authorized to appoint whoever he pleased as Naib, with the\r\nexception of Ussaun Sing. He accordingly exercises this power, and\r\nchooses a person called Jagher Deo Seo. From the time of the confinement\r\nof Durbege Sing to the time of this man's being put into the government,\r\nin whose hands were the revenues of the country? Mr. Markham himself has\r\ntold you, at your bar, that they were in his hands,--that he was the\r\nperson who not only named this man, but that he had the sole management\r\nof the revenues; and he was, of course, answerable for them all that\r\ntime. The nominal title of Zemindar was still left to the miserable\r\npageant who held it; but even the very name soon fell entirely out of\r\nuse. It is in evidence before your Lordships that his name is not even\r\nso much as mentioned in the proceedings of the government; and that the\r\nperson who really governed was not the ostensible Jagher Deo Seo, but\r\nMr. Markham. The government, therefore, was taken completely and\r\nentirely out of the hands of the person who had a legal right to\r\nadminister it,--out of the hands of his guardians,--out of the hands of\r\nhis mother,--out of the hands of his nearest relations,--and, in short,\r\nof all those who, in the common course of things, ought to have been\r\nintrusted with it. From all such persons, I say, it was taken: and\r\nwhere, my Lords, was it deposited? Why, in the hands of a man of whom we\r\nknow nothing, and of whom we never heard anything, before we heard that\r\nMr. Markham, of his own usurped authority, authorized by the usurped\r\nauthority of Mr. Hastings, without the least communication with the\r\nCouncil, had put him in possession of that country.\r\n\r\nMr. Markham himself, as I have just said, administered the revenues\r\nalone, without the smallest authority for so doing, without the least\r\nknowledge of the Council, till Jagher Deo Seo was appointed Naib. Did he\r\nthen give up his authority? No such thing. All the measures of Jagher\r\nDeo Seo's government were taken with the concurrence and joint\r\nmanagement of Mr. Markham. He conducted the whole; the settlements were\r\nmade, the leases and agreements with farmers all regulated by him. I\r\nneed not tell you, I believe, that Jagher Deo Seo was not a person of\r\nvery much authority in the case: your Lordships would laugh at me, if I\r\nsaid he was. The revenue arrangements were, I firmly believe, regulated\r\nand made by Mr. Markham. But whether they were or were not, it comes to\r\nthe same thing. If they were improperly made and improperly conducted,\r\nMr. Hastings is responsible for the whole of the mismanagement; for he\r\ngave the entire control to a person who had little experience, who was\r\nyoung in the world (and this is the excuse I wish to make for a\r\ngentleman of that age). He appointed him, and gave him at large a\r\ndiscretionary authority to name whom he pleased to be the ostensible\r\nNaib; but we know that he took the principal part himself in all his\r\nsettlements and in all his proceedings.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Naib had been thus appointed and instructed by Mr.\r\nMarkham, he settled, under his directions, the administration of the\r\ncountry. Mr. Markham then desires leave from Mr. Hastings to go down to\r\nCalcutta. I imagine he never returned to Benares; he comes to Europe;\r\nand here end the acts of this viceroy and delegate.\r\n\r\nLet us now begin the reign of Mr. Benn and Mr. Fowke. These gentlemen\r\nhad just the same power delegated to them that Mr. Markham\r\npossessed,--not one jot less, that I know of; and they were therefore\r\nresponsible, and ought to have been called to an account by Mr. Hastings\r\nfor every part of their proceedings. I will not give you my own account\r\nof the reign of these gentlemen; but I will read to you what Mr.\r\nHastings has thought proper to represent the state of the people to be\r\nunder their government. This course will save your Lordships time and\r\ntrouble; for it will nearly supersede all observations of mine upon the\r\nsubject. I hold in my hand Mr. Hastings's representation of the effects\r\nproduced by a government which was conceived by himself, carried into\r\neffect by himself, and illegally invested by him with illegal powers,\r\nwithout any security or responsibility of any kind. Hear, I say, what an\r\naccount Mr. Hastings gave, when he afterwards went up to Benares upon\r\nanother wicked project, and think what ought to have been his feelings\r\nas he looked upon the ruin he had occasioned. Think of the condition in\r\nwhich he saw Benares the first day he entered it. He then saw it\r\nbeautiful, ornamented, rich,--an object that envy would have shed tears\r\nover for its prosperity, that humanity would have beheld with eyes\r\nglistening with joy for the comfort and happiness which were there\r\nenjoyed by man: a country flourishing in cultivation to such a degree\r\nthat the soldiers were obliged to march in single files through the\r\nfields of corn, to avoid damaging them; a country in which Mr. Stables\r\nhas stated that the villages were thick beyond all expression; a country\r\nwhere the people pressed round their sovereign, as Mr. Stables also told\r\nyou, with joy, triumph, and satisfaction. Such was the country; and in\r\nsuch a state and under such a master was it, when he first saw it. See\r\nwhat it now is under Warren Hastings; see what it is under the British\r\ngovernment; and then judge whether the Commons are or are not right in\r\npressing the subject upon your Lordships for your decision, and letting\r\nyou and all this great auditory know what sort of a criminal you have\r\nbefore you, who has had the impudence to represent to your Lordships at\r\nyour bar that Benares is in a flourishing condition, in defiance of the\r\nevidence which we have under his own hands, and who, in all the false\r\npapers that have been circulated to debauch the public opinion, has\r\nstated that we, the Commons, have given a false representation as to\r\nthe state of the country under the English government.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Lucknow, the 2d of April, 1784.

It is in page 306 of the\r\n    printed Minutes._\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--Having contrived, by making forced stages, while the\r\n    troops of my escort marched at the ordinary rate, to make a stay of\r\n    five days at Benares, I was thereby furnished with the means of\r\n    acquiring some knowledge of the state of the province, which I am\r\n    anxious to communicate to you: indeed, the inquiry, which was in a\r\n    great degree obtruded upon me, affected me with very mortifying\r\n    reflections on my own inability to apply it to any useful purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"From the confines of Buxar to Benares I was followed and fatigued\r\n    by the clamors of the discontented inhabitants. It was what I\r\n    expected in a degree, because it is rare that the exercise of\r\n    authority should prove satisfactory to all who are the objects of\r\n    it. The distresses which were produced by the long continued drought\r\n    unavoidably tended to heighten the general discontent; yet I have\r\n    reason to fear that the cause existed principally in a defective, if\r\n    not a corrupt and oppressive administration. Of a multitude of\r\n    petitions which were presented to me, and of which I took minutes,\r\n    every one that did not relate to a personal grievance contained the\r\n    representation of one and the same species of oppression, which is\r\n    in its nature of an influence most fatal to the future cultivation.\r\n    The practice to which I allude is this. It is affirmed that the\r\n    aumils and renters exact from the proprietors of the actual harvest\r\n    a large increase in kind on their stipulated rent: that is, from\r\n    those who hold their pottahs by the tenure of paying one half of the\r\n    produce of their crops, either the whole without a subterfuge, or a\r\n    large proportion of it by false measurement or other pretexts; and\r\n    from those whose engagements are for a fixed rent in money the half\r\n    or a greater proportion is taken in kind. This is in effect a tax\r\n    upon the industry of the inhabitants; since there is scarcely a\r\n    field of grain in the province, I might say not one, which has not\r\n    been preserved by the incessant labor of the cultivator, by digging\r\n    wells for their supply, or watering them from the wells of masonry\r\n    with which this country abounds, or from the neighboring tanks,\r\n    rivers, and nullahs. The people who imposed on themselves this\r\n    voluntary and extraordinary labor, and not unattended with expense,\r\n    did it in the expectation of reaping the profits of it; and it is\r\n    certain that they would not have done it, if they had known that\r\n    their rulers, from whom they were entitled to an indemnification,\r\n    would take from them what they had so hardly earned. If the same\r\n    administration continues, and the country shall again labor under a\r\n    want of the natural rains, every field will be abandoned, the\r\n    revenue fail, and thousands perish, through the want of subsistence:\r\n    for who will labor for the sole benefit of others, and to make\r\n    himself the subject of vexation? These practices are not to be\r\n    imputed to the aumils employed in the districts, but to the Naib\r\n    himself. The avowed principle on which he acts, and which he\r\n    acknowledged to myself, is, that the whole sum fixed for the revenue\r\n    of the province must be collected, and that for this purpose the\r\n    deficiency arising in places where the crops have failed, or which\r\n    have been left uncultivated, must be supplied from the resources of\r\n    others, where the soil has been better suited to the season, or the\r\n    industry of the cultivators more successfully exerted: a principle\r\n    which, however specious and plausible it may at first appear,\r\n    certainly tends to the most pernicious and destructive consequences.\r\n    If this declaration of the Naib had been made only to myself, I\r\n    might have doubted my construction of it; but it was repeated by him\r\n    to Mr. Anderson, who understood it exactly in the same sense. In the\r\n    management of the customs, the conduct of the Naib, or of the\r\n    officers under him, was forced also upon my attention. The\r\n    exorbitant rates exacted by an arbitrary valuation of the goods, the\r\n    practice of exacting duties twice on the same goods, first from the\r\n    seller and afterwards from the buyer, and the vexatious disputes and\r\n    delays drawn on the merchants by these oppressions, were loudly\r\n    complained of; and some instances of this kind were said to exist at\r\n    the very time when I was in Benares. Under such circumstances, we\r\n    are not to wonder, if the merchants of foreign countries are\r\n    discouraged from resorting to Benares, and if the commerce of that\r\n    province should annually decay.\r\n\r\n    \"Other evils, or imputed evils, have accidentally come to my\r\n    knowledge, which I will not now particularize, as I hope that with\r\n    the assistance of the Resident they may be in part corrected: one,\r\n    however, I must mention, because it has been verified by my own\r\n    observation, and is of that kind which reflects an unmerited\r\n    reproach on our general and national character. When I was at Buxar,\r\n    the Resident at my desire enjoined the Naib to appoint creditable\r\n    people to every town through which our route lay, to persuade and\r\n    encourage the inhabitants to remain in their houses, promising to\r\n    give them guards as I approached, and they required it for their\r\n    protection; and that he might perceive how earnest I was for his\r\n    observance of this precaution, (which I am certain was faithfully\r\n    delivered,) I repeated it to him in person, and dismissed him, that\r\n    he might precede me for that purpose: but, to my great\r\n    disappointment, I found every place through which I passed\r\n    abandoned; nor had there been a man left in any of them for their\r\n    protection. I am sorry to add, that, from Buxar to the opposite\r\n    boundary, I have seen nothing but the traces of complete devastation\r\n    in every village, whether caused by the followers of the troops\r\n    which have lately passed, for their natural relief, (and I know not\r\n    whether my own may not have had their share,) or from the\r\n    apprehension of the inhabitants left to themselves, and of\r\n    themselves deserting their houses. I wish to acquit my own\r\n    countrymen of the blame of these unfavorable appearances, and in my\r\n    own heart I do acquit them: for at one encampment, near a large\r\n    village called Derrara, in the purgunnah of Zemaneea, a crowd of\r\n    people came to me, complaining that their former aumil, who was a\r\n    native of the place, and had long been established in authority over\r\n    them, and whose custom it had been, whenever any troops passed, to\r\n    remain in person on the spot for their protection, having been\r\n    removed, the new aumil, on the approach of any military detachment,\r\n    himself first fled from the place, and the inhabitants, having no\r\n    one to whom they could apply for redress, or for the representation\r\n    of their grievances, and being thus remediless, fled also; so that\r\n    their houses and effects became a prey to any person who chose to\r\n    plunder them. The general conclusion appeared to me an inevitable\r\n    consequence from such a state of facts,--and my own senses bore\r\n    testimony to it in this specific instance; nor do I know how it is\r\n    possible for any officer commanding a military party, how attentive\r\n    soever he may be to the discipline and forbearance of his people,\r\n    to prevent disorders, when there is neither opposition to hinder nor\r\n    evidence to detect them. These and many other irregularities I\r\n    impute solely to the Naib; and I think it my duty to recommend his\r\n    instant removal. I would myself have dismissed him, had the control\r\n    of this province come within the line of my powers, and have\r\n    established such regulations and checks as would have been most\r\n    likely to prevent the like irregularities. I have said checks,\r\n    because, unless there is some visible influence, and a powerful and\r\n    able one, impended over the head of the manager, no system can\r\n    avail. The next appointed may prove, from some defect, as unfit for\r\n    the office as the present; for the choice is limited to few, without\r\n    experience to guide it. The first was of my own nomination; his\r\n    merits and qualifications stood in equal balance with my knowledge\r\n    of those who might have been the candidates for the office; but he\r\n    was the father of the Rajah, and the affinity sunk the scale wholly\r\n    in his favor: for who could be so fit to be intrusted with the\r\n    charge of his son's interest, and the new credit of the rising\r\n    family? He deceived my expectations. Another was recommended by the\r\n    Resident, and at my instance the board appointed him. This was\r\n    Jagher Deo Seo, the present Naib. I knew him not, and the other\r\n    members of the board as little. While Mr. Markham remained in\r\n    office, of whom, as his immediate patron, he may have stood in awe,\r\n    I am told that he restrained his natural disposition, which has been\r\n    described to me as rapacious, unfeeling, haughty, and to an extreme\r\n    vindictive.\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot avoid remarking, that, excepting the city of Benares\r\n    itself, the province depending upon it is in effect without a\r\n    government, the Naib exercising only a dependent jurisdiction\r\n    without a principal. The Rajah is without authority, and even his\r\n    name disused in the official instruments issued or taken by the\r\n    manager. The representation of his situation shall be the subject of\r\n    another letter; I have made this already too long, and shall confine\r\n    it to the single subject for the communication of which it was\r\n    begun. This permit me to recapitulate. The administration of the\r\n    province is misconducted, and the people oppressed; trade\r\n    discouraged, and the revenue, though said to be exceeded in the\r\n    actual collections by many lacs, (for I have a minute account of it,\r\n    which states the net amount, including jaghires, as something more\r\n    than fifty-one lacs,) in danger of a rapid decline, from the violent\r\n    appropriation of its means; the Naib or manager is unfit for his\r\n    office; a new manager is required, and a system of official\r\n    control,--in a word, a constitution: for neither can the board\r\n    extend its superintending powers to a district so remote from its\r\n    observation, nor has it delegated that authority to the Resident,\r\n    who is merely the representative of government, and the receiver of\r\n    its revenue in the last process of it; nor, indeed, would it be\r\n    possible to render him wholly so, for reasons which I may hereafter\r\n    detail.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have now heard--not from the Managers, not from records of\r\noffice, not from witnesses at your bar, but from the prisoner\r\nhimself--the state of the country of Benares, from the time that Mr.\r\nHastings and his delegated Residents had taken the management of it. My\r\nLords, it is a proof, beyond all other proof, of the melancholy state of\r\nthe country, in which, by attempting to exercise usurped and arbitrary\r\npower, all power and all authority become extinguished, complete anarchy\r\ntakes place, and nothing of government appears but the means of robbing\r\nand ravaging, with an utter indisposition to take one step for the\r\nprotection of the people.\r\n\r\nThink, my Lords, what a triumphal progress it was for a British\r\ngovernor, from one extremity of the province to the other, (for so he\r\nhas stated it,) to be pursued by the cries of an oppressed and ruined\r\npeople, where they dared to appear before him,--and when they did not\r\ndare to appear, flying from every place, even the very magistrates being\r\nthe first to fly! Think, my Lords, that, when these unhappy people saw\r\nthe appearance of a British soldier, they fled as from a pestilence; and\r\nthen think, that these were the people who labored in the manner which\r\nyou have just heard, who dug their own wells, whose country would not\r\nproduce anything but from the indefatigable industry of its inhabitants;\r\nand that such a meritorious, such an industrious people, should be\r\nsubjected to such a cursed anarchy under pretence of revenue, to such a\r\ncursed tyranny under the pretence of government!\r\n\r\n\"But Jagher Deo Seo was unfit for his office.\"--\"How dared you to\r\nappoint a man unfit for his office?\"--\"Oh, it signified little, without\r\ntheir having a constitution.\"--\"Why did you destroy the official\r\nconstitution that existed before? How dared you to destroy those\r\nestablishments which enabled the people to dig wells and to cultivate\r\nthe country like a garden, and then to leave the whole in the hands of\r\nyour arbitrary and wicked Residents and their instruments, chosen\r\nwithout the least idea of government and without the least idea of\r\nprotection?\"\r\n\r\nGod has sometimes converted wickedness into madness; and it is to the\r\ncredit of human reason, that men who are not in some degree mad are\r\nnever capable of being in the highest degree wicked. The human faculties\r\nand reason are in such cases deranged; and therefore this man has been\r\ndragged by the just vengeance of Providence to make his own madness the\r\ndiscoverer of his own wicked, perfidious, and cursed machinations in\r\nthat devoted country.\r\n\r\nThink, my Lords, of what he says respecting the military. He says there\r\nis no restraining them,--that they pillage the country wherever they go.\r\nBut had not Mr. Hastings himself just before encouraged the military to\r\npillage the country? Did he not make the people's resistance, when the\r\nsoldiers attempted to pillage them, one of the crimes of Cheyt Sing? And\r\nwho would dare to obstruct the military in their abominable ravages,\r\nwhen they knew that one of the articles of Cheyt Sing's impeachment was\r\nhis having suffered the people of the country, when plundered by these\r\nwicked soldiers, to return injury for injury and blow for blow? When\r\nthey saw, I say, that these were the things for which Cheyt Sing was\r\nsacrificed, there was manifestly nothing left for them but\r\nflight.--What! fly from a Governor-General? You would expect he was\r\nbearing to the country, upon his balmy and healing wings, the cure of\r\nall its disorders and of all its distress. No: they knew him too well;\r\nthey knew him to be the destroyer of the country; they knew him to be\r\nthe destroyer of their sovereign, the destroyer of the persons whom he\r\nhad appointed to govern under him; they knew that neither governor,\r\nsub-governor, nor subject could enjoy a moment's security while he\r\npossessed supreme power. This was the state of the country; and this the\r\nCommons of England call upon your Lordships to avenge.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what is next done by the prisoner at your bar. He is\r\nsatisfied with simply removing from his office Jagher Deo Seo, who is\r\naccused by him of all these corruptions and oppressions. The other poor,\r\nunfortunate man, who was not even accused of malversations in such a\r\ndegree, and against whom not one of the accusations of oppression was\r\nregularly proved, but who had, in Mr. Hastings's eye, the one\r\nunpardonable fault of not having been made richer by his crimes, was\r\ntwice imprisoned, and finally perished in prison. But we have never\r\nheard one word of the imprisonment of Jagher Deo Seo, who, I believe,\r\nafter some mock inquiry, was acquitted.\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, I must beg you to recollect Mr. Hastings's proceeding\r\nwith Gunga Govind Sing, and to contrast his conduct towards these two\r\npeculators with his proceeding towards Durbege Sing. Such a comparison\r\nwill let your Lordships into the secret of one of the prisoner's motives\r\nof conduct upon such occasions. When you will find a man pillaging and\r\ndesolating a country, in the manner Jagher Deo Seo is described by Mr.\r\nHastings to have done, but who takes care to secure to himself the\r\nspoil, you will likewise find that such a man is safe, secure,\r\nunpunished. Your Lordships will recollect the desolation of Dinagepore.\r\nYou will recollect that the rapacious Gunga Govind Sing, (the coadjutor\r\nof Mr. Hastings in peculation,) out of 80,000_l._ which he had received\r\non the Company's account, retained 40,000_l._ for his own use, and that,\r\ninstead of being turned out of his employment and treated with rigor and\r\ncruelty, he was elevated in Mr. Hastings's grace and favor, and never\r\ncalled upon for the restoration of a penny. Observe, my Lords, the\r\ndifference in his treatment of men who have wealth to purchase impunity,\r\nor who have secrets to reveal, and of another who has no such merit, and\r\nis poor and insolvent.\r\n\r\nWe have shown your Lordships the effects of Mr. Hastings's government\r\nupon the country and its inhabitants; and although I have before\r\nsuggested to you some of its effects upon the army of the Company, I\r\nwill now call your attention to a few other observations on that\r\nsubject. Your Lordships will, in the first place, be pleased to attend\r\nto the character which he gives of this army. You have heard what he\r\ntells you of the state of the country in which it was stationed, and of\r\nthe terror which it struck into the inhabitants. The appearance of an\r\nEnglish soldier was enough to strike the country people with affright\r\nand dismay: they everywhere, he tells you, fled before them. And yet\r\nthey are the officers of this very army who are brought here as\r\nwitnesses to express the general satisfaction of the people of India. To\r\nbe sure, a man who never calls Englishmen to an account for any robbery\r\nor injury whatever, who acquits them, upon their good intentions,\r\nwithout any inquiry, will in return for this indemnity have their good\r\nwords. We are not surprised to find them coming with emulation to your\r\nbar to declare him possessed of all virtues, and that nobody has or can\r\nhave a right to complain of him. But we, my Lords, protest against these\r\nindemnities; we protest against their good words; we protest against\r\ntheir testimonials; and we insist upon your Lordships trying him, not\r\nupon what this or that officer says of his good conduct, but upon the\r\nproved result of the actions tried before you. Without ascribing,\r\nperhaps, much guilt to men who must naturally wish to favor the person\r\nwho covers their excesses, who suffers their fortunes to be made, you\r\nwill know what value to set upon their testimony. The Commons look on\r\nthose testimonies with the greatest slight, and they consider as nothing\r\nall evidence given by persons who are interested in the very\r\ncause,--persons who derive their fortunes from the ruin of the very\r\npeople of the country, and who have divided the spoils with the man whom\r\nwe accuse. Undoubtedly these officers will give him their good word.\r\nUndoubtedly the Residents will give him their good word. Mr. Markham,\r\nand Mr. Benn, and Mr. Fowke, if he had been called, every servant of the\r\nCompany, except some few, will give him the same good word, every one of\r\nthem; because, my Lords, they have made their fortunes under him, and\r\ntheir conduct has not been inquired into.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the observations we were making upon the ruinous\r\neffects in general of the successive governments which had been\r\nestablished at Benares by the prisoner at your bar. These effects, he\r\nwould have you believe, arose from the want of a constitution. Why, I\r\nagain ask, did he destroy the constitution which he found established\r\nthere, or suffer it to be destroyed? But he had actually authorized Mr.\r\nMarkham to make a new, a regular, an official constitution. Did Mr.\r\nMarkham make it? No: though he professed to do it; it never was done:\r\nand so far from there being any regular, able, efficient constitution,\r\nyou see there was an absolute and complete anarchy in the country. The\r\nnative inhabitants, deprived of their ancient government, were so far\r\nfrom looking up to their new masters for protection, that, the moment\r\nthey saw the face of a soldier or of a British person in authority, they\r\nfled in dismay, and thought it more eligible to abandon their houses to\r\nrobbery than to remain exposed to the tyranny of a British governor. Is\r\nthis what they call British dominion? Will you sanction by your judicial\r\nauthority transactions done in direct defiance of your legislative\r\nauthority? Are they so injuriously mad as to suppose your Lordships can\r\nbe corrupted to betray in your judicial capacity (the most sacred of the\r\ntwo) what you have ordained in your legislative character?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am next to remind you what this man has had the insolence\r\nand audacity to state at your bar. \"In fact,\" says he, \"I can adduce\r\nvery many gentlemen now in London to confirm my assertions, that the\r\ncountries of Benares and Gazipore were never within the memory of\r\nEnglishmen so well protected, so peaceably governed, or more\r\nindustriously cultivated than at the present moment.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships know that this report of Mr. Hastings which has been read\r\nwas made in the year 1784. Your Lordships know that no step was taken,\r\nwhile Mr. Hastings remained in India, for the regulation and management\r\nof the country. If there was, let it be shown. There was no constitution\r\nframed, nor any other means taken for the settlement of the country,\r\nexcept the appointment of Ajeet Sing in the room of Durbege Sing, to\r\nreign like him, and like him to be turned out. Mr. Hastings left India\r\nin February, 1785; he arrived here, as I believe, in June or July\r\nfollowing. Our proceedings against him commenced in the sessions of\r\n1786; and this defence was given, I believe, in the year 1787. Yet at\r\nthat time, when he could hardly have received any account from India, he\r\nwas ready, he says, to produce the evidence (and no doubt might have\r\ndone so) of many gentlemen whose depositions would have directly\r\ncontradicted what he had himself deposed of the state in which he, so\r\nshort a time before, had left the country. Your Lordships cannot suppose\r\nthat it could have recovered its prosperity within that time. We know\r\nyou may destroy that in a day which will take up years to build; we know\r\na tyrant can in a moment ruin and oppress: but you cannot restore the\r\ndead to life; you cannot in a moment restore fields to cultivation; you\r\ncannot, as you please, make the people in a moment restore old or dig\r\nnew wells: and yet Mr. Hastings has dared to say to the Commons that he\r\nwould produce persons to refute the account which we had fresh from\r\nhimself. We will, however, undertake to show you that the direct\r\ncontrary was the fact.\r\n\r\nI will first refer you to Mr. Barlow's account of the state of trade.\r\nYour Lordships will there find a full exposure of the total falsehood of\r\nthe prisoner's assertions. You will find that Mr. Hastings himself had\r\nbeen obliged to give orders for the change of almost every one of the\r\nregulations he had made. Your Lordships may there see the madness and\r\nfolly of tyranny attempting to regulate trade. In the printed Minutes,\r\npage 2830, your Lordships will see how completely Mr. Hastings had\r\nruined the trade of the country. You will find, that, wherever he\r\npretended to redress the grievances which he had occasioned, he did not\r\ntake care to have any one part of his pretended redress executed. When\r\nyou consider the anarchy in which he states the country through which he\r\npassed to have been, you may easily conceive that regulations for the\r\nprotection of trade, without the means of enforcing them, must be\r\nnugatory.\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow was sent, in the years 1786 and 1787, to examine into the\r\nstate of the country. He has stated the effect of all those regulations,\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings has had the assurance to represent here as prodigies\r\nof wisdom. At the very time when our charge was brought to this House,\r\n(it is a remarkable period, and we desire your Lordships to advert to\r\nit,) at that time, I do not know whether it was not on the very same day\r\nthat we brought our charge to your bar, Mr. Duncan was sent by Lord\r\nCornwallis to examine into the state of that province. Now, my Lords,\r\nyou have Mr. Duncan's report before you, and you will judge whether or\r\nnot, by any regulation which Mr. Hastings had made, or whether through\r\n_any_ means used by him, that country had recovered or was recovering.\r\nYour Lordships will there find other proofs of the audacious falsehood\r\nof his representation, that all which he had done had operated on the\r\nminds of the inhabitants very greatly in favor of British integrity and\r\ngood government. Mr. Duncan's report will not only enable you to decide\r\nupon what he has said himself, it will likewise enable you to judge of\r\nthe credit which is due to the gentlemen now in London whom he can\r\nproduce to confirm his assertions, that the country of Benares and\r\nGazipore were never, within the memory of Englishmen, so well protected\r\nand cultivated as at the present moment.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of a speech from me, you shall hear what the country\r\nsays itself, by the report of the last commissioner who was sent to\r\nexamine it by Lord Cornwallis. The perfect credibility of his testimony\r\nMr. Hastings has established out of Lord Cornwallis's mouth, who, being\r\nasked the character of Mr. Jonathan Duncan, has declared that there is\r\nnothing he can report of the state of the country to which you ought not\r\nto give credit. Your Lordships will now see how deep the wounds are\r\nwhich tyranny and arbitrary power must make in a country where their\r\nexistence is suffered; and you will be pleased to observe that this\r\nstatement was made at a time when Mr. Hastings was amusing us with _his_\r\naccount of Benares.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of the Proceedings of the Resident at Benares, under date\r\n    the 16th February, 1788, at the Purgunnah of Gurrah Dehmah, &c.\r\n    Printed Minutes, page 2610._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident, having arrived in this purgunnah of Gurrah Dehmah\r\n    from that of Mohammedabad, is very sorry to observe that it seems\r\n    about one third at least uncultivated, owing to the mismanagement of\r\n    the few last years. The Rajah, however, promises that it shall be by\r\n    next year in a complete state of cultivation; and Tobarck Hossaine,\r\n    his aumeen, aumil, or agent, professes his confidence of the same\r\n    happy effects, saying, that he has already brought a great\r\n    proportion of the land, that lay fallow when he came into the\r\n    purgunnah in the beginning of the year, into cultivation, and that,\r\n    it being equally the Rajah's directions and his own wish, he does\r\n    not doubt of being successful in regard to the remaining part of\r\n    the waste land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Report, dated the 18th of February, at the Purgunnah of Bulleah._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident, having come yesterday into this purgunnah from that\r\n    of Gurrah Dehmah, finds its appearance much superior to that\r\n    purgunnah in point of cultivation; yet it is on the decline so for\r\n    that its collectible jumma will not be so much this year as it was\r\n    last, notwithstanding all the efforts of Reazel Husn, the agent of\r\n    Khulb Ali Khân, who has farmed this purgunnah upon a three years'\r\n    lease, (of which the present is the last,) during which his, that\r\n    is, the head farmer's, management cannot be applauded, as the funds\r\n    of the purgunnah are very considerably declined in his hands:\r\n    indeed, Reazel Husn declares that this year there was little or no\r\n    _khereef_, or first harvest, in the purgunnah, and that it has been\r\n    merely by the greatest exertions that he has prevailed on the ryots\r\n    to cultivate the _rubby_ crop, which is now on the ground and seems\r\n    plentiful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Report, dated the 20th of February, at the Purgunnah of Khereed._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident, having this day come into the purgunnah of Khereed,\r\n    finds that part of it laying between the frontiers of Bulleah, the\r\n    present station, and Bansdeah, (which is one of the _tuppahs_, or\r\n    subdivisions, of Khereed,) exceedingly wasted and uncultivated. The\r\n    said tuppah is sub-farmed by Gobind Ram from Kulub Ali Bey, and\r\n    Gobind Ram has again under-rented it to the zemindars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Report, dated the 23d February, at the Purgunnah of Sekunderpoor._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident is set out for Sekunderpoor, and is sorry to observe,\r\n    that, for about six or seven coss that he had further to pass\r\n    through the purgunnah of Kereebs, the whole appeared one continued\r\n    waste, as far as the eye could reach, on both sides of the road. The\r\n    purgunnah Sekunderpoor, beginning about a coss before he reached the\r\n    village, an old fort of that name, appeared to a little more\r\n    advantage; but even here the crops seem very scanty, and the ground\r\n    more than half fallow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of the Proceedings of the Resident at Benares, under date\r\n    the 26th February, at the Purgunnah of Sekunderpoor._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident now leaves Sekunderpoor to proceed to Nurgurah, the\r\n    head cutchery of the purgunnah. He is sorry to observe, that, during\r\n    the whole way between these two places, which are at the distance of\r\n    six coss, or twelve miles, from each other, not above twenty fields\r\n    of cultivated ground are to be seen; all the rest being, as far as\r\n    the eye can reach, except just in the vicinity of Nuggeha, one\r\n    general waste of long grass, with here and there some straggling\r\n    jungly trees. This falling off in the cultivation is said to have\r\n    happened in the course of but a few years,--that is, since the late\r\n    Rajah's expulsion.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe, the date of the ruin of this country is the\r\nexpulsion of Cheyt Sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of the Proceedings of the Resident at Benares, under date\r\n    the 27th February, at the Purgunnah Sekunderpoor._\r\n\r\n    \"The Resident meant to have proceeded from this place to Cossimabad;\r\n    but understanding that the village of Ressenda, the capital of the\r\n    purgunnah of Susknesser, is situated at three coss' distance, and\r\n    that many _rahdarry_ collections are there exacted, the zemindars\r\n    and ryots being, it seems, all one body of Rajpoots, who affect to\r\n    hold themselves in some sort independent of the Rajah's government,\r\n    paying only a _mokurrery_, or fixed jumma, (which it may be supposed\r\n    is not overrated,) and managing their interior concerns as they\r\n    think fit, the Resident thought it proper on this report to deviate\r\n    a little from his intended route, by proceeding this day to\r\n    Ressenda, where he accordingly arrived in the afternoon; and the\r\n    remaining part of the country near the road through Sekunderpoor,\r\n    from Nuggurha to Seundah, appearing nearly equally waste with the\r\n    former part, as already noticed in the proceedings of the 26th\r\n    instant.\r\n\r\n    \"The Rajah is therefore desired to appoint a person to bring those\r\n    waste lands into cultivation, in like manner as he has done in\r\n    Khereed, with this difference or addition in his instructions,--that\r\n    he subjoin in those to the Aband Kar, or manager, of the\r\n    re-cultivation of Sekunderpoor, the rates at which he is authorized\r\n    to grant pottahs for the various kinds of land; and it is\r\n    recommended to him to make these rates even somewhat lower than he\r\n    may himself think strictly conformable to justice, reporting the\r\n    particulars to the Resident.\r\n\r\n    \"The Rajah is also desired to prepare and transmit a table of\r\n    similar rates to the Aband Kar of purgunnah Khereed.\r\n\r\n        (Signed)    \"JON^N DUNCAN, _Resident_.\r\n        \"BENARES, the 12th September, 1788.\"\r\n\r\nHere your Lordships find, in spite of Mr. Hastings himself, in spite of\r\nall the testimonies which he has called, and of all the other\r\ntestimonies which he would have called, that his own account of the\r\nmatter is confirmed against his own pretended evidence; you find his own\r\nwritten account confirmed in a manner not to be doubted: and the only\r\ndifference between his account and this is, that the people did not fly\r\nfrom Mr. Duncan, when he approached, as they fled from Mr. Hastings.\r\nThey did not feel any of that terror at the approach of a person from\r\nthe beneficent government of Lord Cornwallis with which they had been\r\nentirely filled at the appearance of the prisoner at your bar. From him\r\nthey fled in dismay. They fled from his very presence, as from a\r\nconsuming pestilence, as from something far worse than drought and\r\nfamine; they fled from him as a cruel, corrupt, and arbitrary governor,\r\nwhich is worse than any other evil that ever afflicted mankind.\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, in what manner the country has been wasted and\r\ndestroyed; and you have seen, by the date of these measures, that they\r\nhave happened within a few years, namely, since the expulsion of Rajah\r\nCheyt Sing. There begins the era of calamity. Ask yourselves, then,\r\nwhether you will or can countenance the acts which led directly and\r\nnecessarily to such consequences. Your Lordships will mark what it is to\r\noppress and expel a cherished individual from his government, and\r\nfinally to subvert it. Nothing stands after him; down go all order and\r\nauthority with him; ruin and desolation fall upon the country; the\r\nfields are uncultivated, the wells are dried up. The people, says Mr.\r\nDuncan, promised, indeed, some time or other, under some other\r\ngovernment, to do something. They will again cultivate the lands, when\r\nthey can get an assurance of security. My Lords, judge, I pray you,\r\nwhether the House of Commons, when they had read the account which Mr.\r\nHastings has himself given of the dreadful consequences of his\r\nproceedings, when they had read the account given by Mr. Duncan of an\r\nuncultivated country as far as the eye could reach, would not have shown\r\nthemselves unworthy to represent not only the Commons of Great Britain,\r\nbut the meanest village in it, if they had not brought this great\r\ncriminal before you, and called upon your Lordships to punish him. This\r\nruined country, its desolate fields and its undone inhabitants, all call\r\naloud for British justice, all call for vengeance upon the head of this\r\nexecrable criminal.\r\n\r\nOh! but we ought to be tender towards his personal character,--extremely\r\ncautious in our speech; we ought not to let indignation loose.--My\r\nLords, we do let our indignation loose; we cannot bear with patience\r\nthis affliction of mankind. We will neither abate our energy, relax in\r\nour feelings, nor in the expressions which those feelings dictate.\r\nNothing but corruption like his own could enable any man to see such a\r\nscene of desolation and ruin unmoved. We feel pity for the works of God\r\nand man; we feel horror for the debasement of human nature; and feeling\r\nthus, we give a loose to our indignation, and call upon your Lordships\r\nfor justice.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear to your Lordships, there remains to be stated\r\nan aggravation of his crimes, and of his victims' misery. Would you\r\nconsider it possible, my Lords, that there could be an aggravation of\r\nsuch a case as you have heard? Would you think it possible for a people\r\nto suffer more than the inhabitants of Benares have suffered, from the\r\nnoble possessor of the splendid mansion down to the miserable tenants of\r\nthe cottage and the hut? Yes, there is a state of misery, a state of\r\ndegradation, far below all that you have yet heard. It is, my Lords,\r\nthat these miserable people should come to your Lordships' bar, and\r\ndeclare that they have never felt one of those grievances of which they\r\ncomplain; that not one of those petitions with which they pursued Mr.\r\nHastings had a word of truth in it; that they felt nothing under his\r\ngovernment but ease, tranquillity, joy, and happiness; that every day\r\nduring his government was a festival, and every night an illumination\r\nand rejoicing. The addresses which contain these expressions of\r\nsatisfaction have been produced at your bar, and have been read to your\r\nLordships. You must have heard with disgust, at least, these flowers of\r\nOriental rhetoric, penned at ease by dirty hireling moonshees at\r\nCalcutta, who make these people put their seals, not to declarations of\r\ntheir ruin, but to expressions of their satisfaction. You have heard\r\nwhat he himself says of the country; you have heard what Mr. Duncan says\r\nof it; you have heard the cries of the country itself calling for\r\njustice upon him: and now, my Lords, hear what he has made these people\r\nsay. \"We have heard that the gentlemen in England are displeased with\r\nMr. Hastings, on suspicion that he oppressed us, the inhabitants of\r\nthis place, took our money by deceit and force, and ruined the country.\"\r\nThey then declare solemnly before God, according to their different\r\nreligions, that Mr. Hastings \"distributed protection and security to\r\nreligion, and kindness and peace to all. He is free,\" say they, \"from\r\nthe charge of embezzlement and fraud, and his heart is void of\r\ncovetousness and avidity. During the period of his government no one\r\never experienced from him other than protection and justice, never\r\nhaving felt hardships from him; nor did the poor ever know the weight of\r\nan oppressive hand from him. Our characters and reputation have been\r\nalways guarded in quiet from attack, by the vigilance of his prudence\r\nand foresight, and by the terror of his justice.\"\r\n\r\nUpon my word, my Lords, the paragraphs are delightful. Observe, in this\r\ntranslation from the Persian there is all the fluency of an English\r\nparagraph well preserved. All I can say is, that these people of Benares\r\nfeel their joy, comfort, and satisfaction in swearing to the falseness\r\nof Mr. Hastings's representation against himself. In spite of his own\r\ntestimony, they say, \"He secured happiness and joy to us; he\r\nreëstablished the foundation of justice; and we at all times, during his\r\ngovernment, lived in comfort and passed our days in peace.\" The shame of\r\nEngland and of the English government is here put upon your Lordships'\r\nrecords. Here you have, just following that afflicting report of Mr.\r\nDuncan's, and that account of Mr. Hastings himself, in which he said the\r\ninhabitants fled before his face, the addresses of these miserable\r\npeople. He dares to impose upon your eyesight, upon your common sense,\r\nupon the plain faculties of mankind. He dares, in contradiction to all\r\nhis own assertions, to make these people come forward and swear that\r\nthey have enjoyed nothing but complete satisfaction and pleasure during\r\nthe whole time of his government.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have done with this business, for I have now reached the\r\nclimax of degradation and suffering, after moving step by step through\r\nthe several stages of tyranny and oppression. I have done with it, and\r\nhave only to ask, In what country do we live, where such a scene can by\r\nany possibility be offered to the public eye?\r\n\r\nLet us here, my Lords, make a pause.--You have seen what Benares was\r\nunder its native government. You have seen the condition in which it was\r\nleft by Cheyt Sing, and you have seen the state in which Mr. Hastings\r\nleft it. The rankling wounds which he has inflicted upon the country,\r\nand the degradation to which the inhabitants have been subjected, have\r\nbeen shown to your Lordships. You have now to consider whether or not\r\nyou will fortify with your sanction any of the detestable principles\r\nupon which the prisoner justifies his enormities.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we shall next come to another dependent province, when I shall\r\nillustrate to your Lordships still further the effects of Mr. Hastings's\r\nprinciples. I allude to the province of Oude,--a country which, before\r\nour acquaintance with it, was in the same happy and flourishing\r\ncondition with Benares, and which dates its period of decline and misery\r\nfrom the time of our intermeddling with it. The Nabob of Oude was\r\nreduced, as Cheyt Sing was, to be a dependant on the Company, and to be\r\na greater dependant than Cheyt Sing, because it was reserved in Cheyt\r\nSing's agreement that we should not interfere in his government. We\r\ninterfered in every part of the Nabob's government; we reduced his\r\nauthority to nothing; we introduced a perfect scene of anarchy and\r\nconfusion into the country, where there was no authority but to rob and\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nI have not strength at present to proceed; but I hope I shall soon be\r\nenabled to do so. Your Lordships cannot, I am sure, calculate from your\r\nown youth and strength; for I have done the best I can, and find myself\r\nincapable just at this moment of going any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY: THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--When I last had the honor of addressing your Lordships from\r\nthis place, my want of strength obliged me to conclude where the\r\npatience of a people and the prosperity of a country subjected by solemn\r\ntreaties to British government had concluded. We have left behind us the\r\ninhabitants of Benares, after having seen them driven into rebellion by\r\ntyranny and oppression, and their country desolated by our misrule. Your\r\nLordships, I am sure, have had the map of India before you, and know\r\nthat the country so destroyed and so desolated was about one fifth of\r\nthe size of England and Wales in geographical extent, and equal in\r\npopulation to about a fourth. Upon this scale you will judge of the\r\nmischief which has been done.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we are now come to another devoted province: we march from\r\ndesolation to desolation; because we follow the steps of Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, Governor-General of Bengal. You will here find the\r\nrange of his atrocities widely extended; but before I enter into a\r\ndetail of them, I have one reflection to make, which I beseech your\r\nLordships to bear in mind throughout the whole of this deliberation. It\r\nis this: you ought never to conclude that a man must necessarily be\r\ninnoxious because he is in other respects insignificant. You will see\r\nthat a man bred in obscure, vulgar, and ignoble occupations, and trained\r\nin sordid, base, and mercenary habits, is not incapable of doing\r\nextensive mischief, because he is little, and because his vices are of a\r\nmean nature. My Lords, we have shown to you already, and we shall\r\ndemonstrate to you more clearly in future, that such minds placed in\r\nauthority can do more mischief to a country, can treat all ranks and\r\ndistinctions with more pride, insolence, and arrogance, than those who\r\nhave been born under canopies of state and swaddled in purple: you will\r\nsee that they can waste a country more effectually than the proudest and\r\nmost mighty conquerors, who, by the greatness of their military talents,\r\nhave first subdued and afterwards plundered nations.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's counsel have thought proper to entertain your Lordships,\r\nand to defend their client, by comparing him with the men who are said\r\nto have erected a pyramid of ninety thousand human heads. Now look back,\r\nmy Lords, to Benares; consider the extent of country laid waste and\r\ndesolated, and its immense population; and then see whether famine may\r\nnot destroy as well as the sword, and whether this man is not as well\r\nentitled to erect his pyramid of ninety thousand heads as any terrific\r\ntyrant of the East. We follow him now to another theatre, the\r\nterritories of the Nabob of Oude.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, Oude, (together with the additions made to it by Sujah\r\nDowlah,) in point of geographical extent, is about the size of England.\r\nSujah Dowlah, who possessed this country as Nabob, was a prince of a\r\nhaughty character,--ferocious in a high degree towards his enemies, and\r\ntowards all those who resisted his will. He was magnificent in his\r\nexpenses, yet economical with regard to his resources,--maintaining his\r\ncourt in a pomp and splendor which is perhaps unknown to the sovereigns\r\nof Europe. At the same time he was such an economist, that from an\r\ninconsiderable revenue, at the beginning of his reign, he was annually\r\nenabled to make great savings. He thus preserved, towards the end of it,\r\nhis people in peace, tranquillity, and order; and though he was an\r\narbitrary prince, he never strained his revenue to such a degree as to\r\nlose their affections while he filled his exchequer. Such appears to\r\nhave been the true character of Sujah Dowlah: your Lordships have heard\r\nwhat is the character which the prisoner at your bar and his counsel\r\nhave thought proper to give you of him.\r\n\r\nSurely, my Lords, the situation of the great, as well as of the lower\r\nranks in that country, must be a subject of melancholy reflection to\r\nevery man. Your Lordships' compassion will, I presume, lead you to feel\r\nfor the lowest; and I hope that your sympathetic dignity will make you\r\nconsider in what manner the princes of this country are treated. They\r\nhave not only been treated at your Lordships' bar with indignity by the\r\nprisoner, but his counsel do not leave their ancestors to rest quietly\r\nin their graves. They have slandered their families, and have gone into\r\nscandalous history that has no foundation in facts whatever.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have seen how he attempted to slander the ancestors of\r\nCheyt Sing, to deny that they were zemindars; and yet he must have known\r\nfrom printed books, taken from the Company's records, the utter falsity\r\nof his declaration. You need only look into Mr. Verelst's Appendix, and\r\nthere you will see that that country has always been called the\r\nZemindary of Bulwant Sing. You will find him always called the Zemindar;\r\nit was the known, acknowledged name, till this gentleman thought proper\r\nat the bar of the House of Commons to deny that he was a zemindar, and\r\nto assert that he was only an aumil. He slanders the pedigree of this\r\nman as mean and base, yet he was not ashamed to take from him\r\ntwenty-three thousand pounds. In like manner he takes from Asoph ul\r\nDowlah a hundred thousand pounds, which he would have appropriated to\r\nhimself, and then directs his counsel to rake up the slander of Dow's\r\nHistory, a book of no authority, a book that no man values in any\r\nrespect or degree. In this book they find that romantic, absurd, and\r\nridiculous story upon which an honorable fellow Manager of mine, who is\r\nmuch more capable than I am of doing justice to the subject, has\r\ncommented with his usual ability: I allude to that story of spitting on\r\nthe beard,--the mutual compact to poison one another. That Arabian tale,\r\nfit only to form a ridiculous tragedy, has been gravely mentioned to\r\nyour Lordships for the purpose of slandering the pedigree of this Vizier\r\nof Oude, and making him vile in your Lordships' eyes. My honorable\r\nfriend has exposed to you the absurdity of these stories, but he has not\r\nshown you the malice of their propagators. The prisoner and his counsel\r\nhave referred to Dow's History, who calls this Nabob \"the more infamous\r\nson of an infamous Persian peddler.\" They wish that your Lordships\r\nshould consider him as a person vilely born, ignominiously educated, and\r\npractising a mean trade, in order that, when it shall be proved that he\r\nand his family were treated with every kind of indignity and contempt by\r\nthe prisoner at your bar, the sympathy of mankind should be weakened.\r\nConsider, my Lords, the monstrous perfidy and ingratitude of this man,\r\nwho, after receiving great favors from the Nabob, is not satisfied with\r\noppressing his offspring, but goes back to his ancestors, tears them out\r\nof their graves, and vilifies them with slanderous aspersions. My Lords,\r\nthe ancestor of Sujah Dowlah was a great prince,--certainly a\r\nsubordinate prince, because he was a servant of the Great Mogul, who was\r\nwell called King of Kings, for he had in his service persons of high\r\ndegree. He was born in Persia; but was not, as is falsely said, _the\r\nmore infamous son of an infamous Persian peddler_. Your Lordships are\r\nnot unacquainted with the state and history of India; you therefore know\r\nthat Persia has been the nursery of all the Mahometan nobility of India:\r\nalmost everything in that country which is not of Gentoo origin is of\r\nPersian; so much so, that the Persian language is the language of the\r\ncourt, and of every office from the highest to the lowest. Among these\r\nnoble Persians, the family of the Nabob stands in the highest degree.\r\nHis father's ancestors were of noble descent, and those of his mother,\r\nMunny Begum, more eminently and more illustriously so. This\r\ndistinguished family, on no better authority than that of the historian\r\nDow, has been slandered by the prisoner at your bar, in order to destroy\r\nthe character of those whom he had already robbed of their substance.\r\nYour Lordships will have observed with disgust how the Dows and the\r\nHastings, and the whole of that tribe, treat their superiors,--in what\r\ninsolent language they speak of them, and with what pride and indignity\r\nthey trample upon the first names and the first characters in that\r\ndevoted country.\r\n\r\nBut supposing it perfectly true that this man was \"the more infamous son\r\nof an infamous Persian peddler,\" he had risen to be the secondary\r\nsovereign of that country. He had a revenue of three millions six\r\nhundred thousand pounds sterling: a vast and immense revenue; equal,\r\nperhaps, to the clear revenue of the King of England. He maintained an\r\narmy of one hundred and twenty thousand men. He had a splendid court;\r\nand his country was prosperous and happy. Such was the situation of\r\nSujah Dowlah, the Nabob of Oude, and such the condition of Oude under\r\nhis government. With his pedigree, I believe, your Lordships will think\r\nwe have nothing to do in the cause now before us. It has been pressed\r\nupon us; and this marks the indecency, the rancor, the insolence, the\r\npride and tyranny which the Dows and the Hastings, and the people of\r\nthat class and character, are in the habit of exercising over the great\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I shall be saved a great deal of trouble in proving to you the\r\nflourishing state of Oude, because the prisoner admits it as largely as\r\nI could wish to state it; and what is more, he admits, too, the truth of\r\nour statement of the condition to which it is now reduced,--but I shall\r\nnot let him off so easily upon this point. He admits, too, that it was\r\nleft in this reduced and ruined state at the close of his\r\nadministration. In his Defence he attributes the whole mischief\r\ngenerally to a faulty system of government. My Lords, systems never make\r\nmankind happy or unhappy, any further than as they give occasions for\r\nwicked men to exercise their own abominable talents, subservient to\r\ntheir own more abominable dispositions. \"The system,\" says Mr. Hastings,\r\n\"was bad; but I was not the maker of it.\" Your Lordships have seen him\r\napply this mode of reasoning to Benares, and you will now see that he\r\napplies it to Oude. \"I came,\" says he, \"into a bad system; that system\r\nwas not of my making, but I was obliged to act according to the spirit\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nNow every honest man would say,--\"I came to a bad system: I had every\r\nfacility of abusing my power, I had every temptation to peculate, I had\r\nevery incitement to oppress, I had every means of concealment, by the\r\ndefects of the system; but I corrected that evil system by the goodness\r\nof my administration, by the prudence, the energy, the virtue of my\r\nconduct.\" This is what all the rest of the world would say: but what\r\nsays Mr. Hastings? \"A bad system was made to my hands; I had nothing to\r\ndo in making it. I was altogether an involuntary instrument, and obliged\r\nto execute every evil which that system contained.\" This is the line of\r\nconduct your Lordships are called to decide upon. And I must here again\r\nremind you that we are at an issue of law. Mr. Hastings has avowed a\r\ncertain set of principles upon which he acts; and your Lordships are\r\ntherefore to judge whether his acts are justifiable because he found an\r\nevil system to act upon, or whether he and all governors upon earth have\r\nnot a general good system upon which they ought to act.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner tells you, my Lords, that it was in consequence of this\r\nevil system, that the Nabob, from being a powerful prince, became\r\nreduced to a wretched dependant on the Company, and subject to all the\r\nevils of that degraded state,--subject to extortion, to indignity, to\r\noppression. All these your Lordships are called upon to sanction; and\r\nbecause they may be connected with an existing system, you are to\r\ndeclare them to be an allowable part of a code for the government of\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1775, that powerful, magnificent, and illustrious prince,\r\nSujah Dowlah, died in possession of the country of Oude. He had long\r\ngoverned a happy and contented people, and, if we except the portion of\r\ntyranny which we admit he really did exercise towards some few\r\nindividuals who resisted his power, he was a wise and beneficent\r\ngovernor. This prince died in the midst of his power and fortune,\r\nleaving somewhere about fourscore children. Your Lordships know that the\r\nprinces of the East have a great number of wives; and we know that these\r\nwomen, though reputed of a secondary rank, are yet of a very high\r\ndegree, and honorably maintained according to the customs of the East.\r\nSujah Dowlah had but one lawful wife: he had by her but one lawful\r\nchild, Asoph ul Dowlah. He had about twenty-one male children, the\r\neldest of whom was a person whom you have heard of very often in these\r\nproceedings, called Saadut Ali. Asoph ul Dowlah, being the sole\r\nlegitimate son, had all the pretensions to succeed his father, as\r\nSubahdar of Oude, which could belong to any person under the Mogul\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will distinguish between a Zemindar, who is a perpetual\r\nlandholder, the hereditary proprietor of an estate, and a Subahdar, who\r\nderives from his master's will and pleasure all his employments, and\r\nwho, instead of having the jaghiredars subject to his supposed arbitrary\r\nwill, is himself a subject, and must have his sovereign's patent for\r\nhis place. Therefore, strictly and properly speaking, there is no\r\nsuccession in the office of Subahdar. At this time the Company, who\r\nalone could obtain the _sunnuds_ [_sunnud?_], or patent, from the Great\r\nMogul, upon account of the power they possessed in India, thought, and\r\nthought rightly, that with an officer who had no hereditary power there\r\ncould be no hereditary engagements,--and that in their treaty with Asoph\r\nul Dowlah, for whom they had procured the sunnud from the Great Mogul,\r\nthey were at liberty to propose their own terms, which, if honorable and\r\nmutually advantageous to the new Subahdar and to the Company, they had a\r\nright to insist upon. A treaty was therefore concluded between the\r\nCompany and Asoph ul Dowlah, in which the latter stipulated to pay a\r\nfixed subsidy for the maintenance of a certain number of troops, by\r\nwhich the Company's finances were greatly relieved and their military\r\nstrength greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThis treaty did not contain one word which could justify any\r\ninterference in the Nabob's government. That evil system, as Mr.\r\nHastings calls it, is not even mentioned or alluded to; nor is there, I\r\nagain say, one word which authorized Warren Hastings, or any other\r\nperson whatever, to interfere in the interior affairs of his country. He\r\nwas legally constituted Viceroy of Oude; his dignity of Vizier of the\r\nEmpire, with all the power which that office gave him, derived from and\r\nheld under the Mogul government, he legally possessed; and this evil\r\nsystem, which Mr. Hastings says led him to commit the enormities of\r\nwhich you shall hear by-and-by, was neither more nor less than what I\r\nhave now stated.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, the prisoner thinks, that, when, under any pretence, any\r\nsort of means could be furnished of interfering in the government of the\r\ncountry, he has a right to avail himself of them, to use them at his\r\npleasure, and to govern by his own arbitrary will. The Vizier, he says,\r\nby this treaty was reduced to a state of vassalage; and he makes this\r\ncurious distinction in proof of it. It was, he says, an optional\r\nvassalage: for, if he chose to get rid of our troops, he might do so and\r\nbe free; if he had not a mind to do that, and found a benefit in it,\r\nthen he was a vassal. But there is nothing less true. Here is a person\r\nwho keeps a subsidiary body of your troops, which he is to pay for you;\r\nand in consequence of this Mr. Hastings maintains that he becomes a\r\nvassal. I shall not dispute whether vassalage is optional or by force,\r\nor in what way Mr. Hastings considered this prince as a vassal of the\r\nCompany. Let it be as he pleased. I only think it necessary that your\r\nLordships should truly know the actual state of that country, and the\r\nground upon which Mr. Hastings stood. Your Lordships will find it a\r\nfairy land, in which there is a perpetual masquerade, where no one thing\r\nappears as it really is,--where the person who seems to have the\r\nauthority is a slave, while the person who seems to be the slave has the\r\nauthority. In that ambiguous government everything favors fraud,\r\neverything favors peculation, everything favors violence, everything\r\nfavors concealment. You will therefore permit me to show to you what\r\nwere the principles upon which Mr. Hastings appears, according to the\r\nevidence before you, to have acted,--what the state of the country was,\r\naccording to his conceptions of it; and then you will see how he applied\r\nthose principles to that state.\r\n\r\n\"The means by which our government acquired this influence,\" says Mr.\r\nHastings, \"and its right to exercise it, will require a previous\r\nexplanation.\" He then proceeds,--\"With his death [Sujah Dowlah's] a new\r\npolitical system commenced, and Mr. Bristow was constituted the\r\ninstrument of its formation, and the trustee for the management of it.\r\nThe Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah was deprived of a large part of his\r\ninheritance,--I mean the province of Benares, attached by a very feeble\r\nand precarious tenure to our dominions; the army fixed to a permanent\r\nstation in a remote line of his frontier, with an augmented and\r\nperpetual subsidy; a new army, amphibiously composed of troops in his\r\nservice and pay, commanded by English officers of our own nomination,\r\nfor the defence of his new conquests; and his own natural troops\r\nannihilated, or alienated by the insufficiency of his revenue for all\r\nhis disbursements, and the prior claims of those which our authority or\r\ninfluence commanded: in a word, he became a vassal of the government;\r\nbut he still possessed an ostensible sovereignty. His titular rank of\r\nVizier of the Empire rendered him a conspicuous object of view to all\r\nthe states and chiefs of India; and on the moderation and justice with\r\nwhich the British government in Bengal exercised its influence over him\r\nmany points most essential to its political strength and to the honor of\r\nthe British name depended.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see that the system which is supposed to have reduced him\r\nto vassalage did not make, as he contends, a violent exercise of our\r\npower necessary or proper; but possessing, as the Nabob did, that high\r\nnominal dignity, and being in that state of vassalage, as Mr. Hastings\r\nthought proper to term it, though there is no vassalage mentioned in\r\nthe treaty,--being, I say, in that situation of honor, credit, and\r\ncharacter, sovereign of a country as large as England, yielding an\r\nimmense revenue, and flourishing in trade, certainly our honor depended\r\nupon the use we made of that influence which our power gave us over him;\r\nand we therefore press it upon your Lordships, that the conduct of Mr.\r\nHastings was such as dishonored this nation.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds,--\"This is not a place, nor have I room in it, to prove,\r\nwhat I shall here content myself with affirming, that, by a sacred and\r\nundeviating observance of every principle of public faith, the British\r\ndominion might have by this time acquired the means of its extension,\r\nthrough a virtual submission to its authority, to every region of\r\nHindostan and Deccan. I am not sure that I should advise such a design,\r\nwere it practicable, which at this time it certainly is not; and I very\r\nmuch fear that the limited formation of such equal alliances as might be\r\nuseful to our present condition, and conduce to its improvement, is\r\nbecome liable to almost insurmountable difficulties: every power in\r\nIndia must wish for the support of ours, but they all dread the\r\nconnection. The subjection of Bengal, and the deprivation of the family\r\nof Jaffier Ali Khân, though an effect of inevitable necessity, the\r\npresent usurpations of the rights of the Nabob Wallau Jau in the\r\nCarnatic, and the licentious violations of the treaty existing between\r\nthe Company and the Nabob Nizam ul Dowlah, though checked by the\r\nremedial interposition of this government, stand as terrible precedents\r\nagainst us; the effects of our connection with the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah\r\nhad a rapid tendency to the same consequences, and it has been my\r\ninvariable study to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remember that the counsel at the bar have said that\r\nthey undertook the defence of Warren Hastings, not in order to defend\r\nhim, but to rescue the British character from the imputations which have\r\nbeen laid upon it by the Commons of Great Britain. They have said that\r\nthe Commons of Great Britain have slandered their country, and have\r\nmisrepresented its character; while, on the contrary, the servants of\r\nthe Company have sustained and maintained the dignity of the English\r\ncharacter, have kept its public faith inviolate, preserved the people\r\nfrom oppression, reconciled every government to it in India, and have\r\nmade every person under it prosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see what this man says himself, when endeavoring to prove\r\nhis own innocence. Instead of proving it by the facts alleged by his\r\ncounsel, he declares that by preserving good faith you might have\r\nconquered India, the most glorious conquest that was ever made in the\r\nworld; that all the people want our assistance, but dread our\r\nconnection. Why? Because our whole conduct has been one perpetual tissue\r\nof perfidy and breach of faith with every person who has been in\r\nalliance with us, in any mode whatever. Here is the man himself who says\r\nit. Can we bear that this man should now stand up in this place as the\r\nassertor of the honor of the British nation against us, who charge this\r\ndishonor to have fallen upon us by him, through him, and during his\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nBut all the mischief, he goes on to assert, was in the previous system,\r\nin the formation of which he had no share,--the system of 1775, when\r\nthe first treaty with the Nabob was made. \"That system,\" says he, \"is\r\nnot mine; it was made by General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr.\r\nFrancis.\" So it was, my Lords. It did them very great honor, and I\r\nbelieve it ever will do them honor, in the eyes of the British nation,\r\nthat they took an opportunity, without the violation of faith, without\r\nthe breach of any one treaty, and without injury to any person, to do\r\ngreat and eminent services to the Company. But Mr. Hastings disclaims\r\nit, unnecessarily disclaims it, for no one charges him with it. What we\r\ncharge him with is the abuse of that system. To one of these abuses I\r\nwill now call your Lordships' attention. Finding, soon after his\r\nappointment to the office of Governor-General, that the Nabob was likely\r\nto get into debt, he turns him into a vassal, and resolves to treat him\r\nas such. You will observe that this is not the only instance in which,\r\nupon a failure of payment, the defaulter becomes directly a vassal. You\r\nremember how Durbege Sing, the moment he fell into an arrear of tribute,\r\nbecame a vassal, and was thrown into prison, without any inquiry into\r\nthe causes which occasioned that arrear. With respect to the Nabob of\r\nOude, we assert, and can prove, that his revenue was 3,600,000_l._ at\r\nthe day of his father's death; and if the revenue fell off afterwards,\r\nthere was abundant reason to believe that he possessed in abundance the\r\nmeans of paying the Company every farthing.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this subject, your Lordships will again permit me to\r\nreprobate the malicious insinuations by which Mr. Hastings has thought\r\nproper to slander the virtuous persons who are the authors of that\r\nsystem which he complains of. They are men whose characters this country\r\nwill ever respect, honor, and revere, both the living and the dead,--the\r\ndead for the living, and the living for the dead. They will altogether\r\nbe revered for a conduct honorable and glorious to Great Britain, whilst\r\ntheir names stand as they now do, unspotted by the least imputation of\r\noppression, breach of faith, perjury, bribery, or any other fraud\r\nwhatever. I know there was a faction formed against them upon that very\r\naccount. Be corrupt, you have friends; stem the torrent of corruption,\r\nyou open a thousand venal mouths against you. Men resolved to do their\r\nduty must be content to suffer such opprobrium, and I am content; in the\r\nname of the living and of the dead, and in the name of the Commons, I\r\nglory in our having appointed some good servants at least to India.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. \"This system was not,\" says he, \"of my making.\" You\r\nwould, then, naturally imagine that the persons who made this abominable\r\nsystem had also made some tyrannous use of it. Let us see what use they\r\nmade of it during the time of their majority in the Council. There was\r\nan arrear of subsidy due from the Nabob. How it came into arrear we\r\nshall consider hereafter. The Nabob proposed to pay it by taxing the\r\njaghires of his family, and taking some money from the Begum. This was\r\nconsented to by Mr. Bristow, at that time Resident for the Company in\r\nOude; and to this arrangement Asoph ul Dowlah and his advisers lent a\r\nwilling ear. What did Mr. Hastings then say of this transaction? He\r\ncalled it a violent assumption of power on the part of the Council. He\r\ndid not, you see, then allow that a bad system justified any persons\r\nwhatever in an abuse of it. He contended that it was a violent attack\r\nupon the rights and property of the parties from whom the money was to\r\nbe taken, that it had no ground or foundation in justice whatever, and\r\nthat it was contrary to every principle of right and equity.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will please to bear in mind, that afterwards, by his own\r\nconsent, and the consent of the rest of the Council, this business was\r\ncompromised between the son, the mother, and their relations. A very\r\ngreat sum of money, which was most useful to the Company at that period,\r\nwas raised by a family compact and arrangement among themselves. This\r\nproceeding was sanctioned by the Company, Mr. Hastings himself\r\nconsenting; and a pledge was given to the Begums and family of the\r\nNabob, that this should be the last demand made upon them,--that it\r\nshould be considered, not as taken compulsively, but as a friendly and\r\namicable donation. They never admitted, nor did the Nabob ever contend,\r\nthat he had any right at all to take this money from them. At that time\r\nit was not Mr. Hastings's opinion that the badness of the system would\r\njustify any violence as a consequence of it; and when the advancement of\r\nthe money was agreed to between the parties, as a family and amicable\r\ncompact, he was as ready as anybody to propose and sanction a regular\r\ntreaty between the parties, that all claims on one side and all kind of\r\nuneasiness on the other should cease forever, under the guardianship of\r\nBritish faith.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, as your Lordships remember, has conceded that British\r\nfaith is the support of the British empire; that, if that empire is to\r\nbe maintained, it is to be maintained by good faith; that, if it is to\r\nbe propagated, it is to be propagated by public faith; and that, if the\r\nBritish empire falls, it will be through perfidy and violence. These are\r\nthe principles which he assumes, when he chooses to reproach others. But\r\nwhen he has to defend his own perfidy and breaches of faith, then, as\r\nyour Lordships will find set forth in his defence before the House of\r\nCommons on the Benares charge, he denies, or at least questions, the\r\nvalidity of any treaty that can at present be made with India. He\r\ndeclares that he considers all treaties as being weakened by a\r\nconsiderable degree of doubt respecting their validity and their binding\r\nforce, in such a state of things as exists in India.\r\n\r\nWhatever was done, during that period of time to which I have alluded,\r\nby the majority of the Council, Mr. Hastings considered himself as\r\nhaving nothing to do with, on the plea of his being a dissentient\r\nmember: a principle which, like other principles, I shall take some\r\nnotice of by-and-by. Colonel Monson and General Clavering died soon\r\nafter, and Mr. Hastings obtained a majority in the Council, and was\r\nthen, as he calls it, restored to his authority; so that any evil that\r\ncould be done by evil men under that evil system could have lasted but\r\nfor a very short time indeed. From that moment, Mr. Hastings, in my\r\nopinion, became responsible for every act done in Council, while he was\r\nthere, which he did not resist, and for every engagement which he did\r\nnot oppose. For your Lordships will not bear that miserable jargon which\r\nyou have heard, shameful to office and to official authority, that a\r\nman, when, he happens not to find himself in a majority upon any\r\nmeasure, may think himself excusable for the total neglect of his duty;\r\nthat in such a situation he is not bound to propose anything that it\r\nmight be proper to propose, or to resist anything that it might be\r\nproper to resist. What would be the inference from such an assumption?\r\nThat he can never act in a commission; that, unless a man has the\r\nsupreme power, he is not responsible for anything he does or neglects to\r\ndo. This is another principle which your Lordships will see constantly\r\nasserted and constantly referred to by Mr. Hastings. Now I do contend,\r\nthat, notwithstanding his having been in a minority, if there was\r\nanything to be done that could prevent oppressive consequences, he was\r\nbound to do that thing; and that he was bound to propose every possible\r\nremedial measure. This proud, rebellious proposition against the law,\r\nthat any one individual in the Council may say that he is responsible\r\nfor nothing, because he is not the whole Council, calls for your\r\nLordships' strongest reprobation.\r\n\r\nI must now beg leave to observe to you, that the treaty was made (and I\r\nwish your Lordships to advert to dates) in the year 1775; Mr. Hastings\r\nacquired the majority in something more than a year afterwards; and\r\ntherefore, supposing the acts of the former majority to have been ever\r\nso iniquitous, their power lasted but a short time. From the year 1776\r\nto 1784 Mr. Hastings had the whole government of Oude in himself, by\r\nhaving the majority in the Council. My Lords, it is no offence that a\r\nGovernor-General, or anybody else, has the majority in the Council. To\r\nhave the government in himself is no offence. Neither was it any\r\noffence, if you please, that the Nabob was virtually a vassal to the\r\nCompany, as he contends he was. For the question is not, what a\r\nGovernor-General _may_ do, but what Warren Hastings did do. He who has a\r\nmajority in Council, and records his own acts there, may justify these\r\nacts as legal: I mean the mode is legal. But as he executes whatever he\r\nproposes as Governor-General, he is solely responsible for the _nature_\r\nof the acts themselves.\r\n\r\nI shall now show your Lordships that Mr. Hastings, finding, as he\r\nstates, the Nabob to be made by the treaty in 1775 eventually a vassal\r\nto the Company, has thought proper to make him a vassal to himself, for\r\nhis own private purposes. Your Lordships will see what corrupt and\r\niniquitous purposes they were. In the first place, in order to\r\nannihilate in effect the Council, and to take wholly from them their\r\ncontrol in the affairs of Oude, he suppressed (your Lordships will find\r\nthe fact proved in your minutes) the Persian correspondence, which was\r\nthe whole correspondence of Oude. This whole correspondence was secreted\r\nby him, and kept from the Council. It was never communicated to the\r\nPersian translator of the Company, Mr. Colebrooke, who had a salary for\r\nexecuting that office. It was secreted, and kept in the private cabinet\r\nof Mr. Hastings; from the period of 1781 to 1785 no part of it was\r\ncommunicated to the Council. There is nothing, as your Lordships have\r\noften found in this trial, that speaks for the man like himself; there\r\nis nothing will speak for his conduct like the records of the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_Fort William, 19th February, 1785._\r\n\r\n    \"At a Council: present, the Honorable John Macpherson, Esquire,\r\n    Governor-General, President, and John Stables, Esquire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"The Persian Translator, attending in obedience to the Board's\r\n    orders, reports, that, since the end of the year 1781, there have\r\n    been no books of correspondence kept in his office, because, from\r\n    that time until the late Governor-General's departure, he was\r\n    employed but once by the Governor-General to manage the\r\n    correspondence, during a short visit which Major Davy, the military\r\n    Persian interpreter, paid by the Governor's order to Lucknow; that,\r\n    during that whole period of three years, he remained entirely\r\n    ignorant of the correspondence, as he was applied to on no occasion,\r\n    except for a few papers sometimes sent to him by the secretaries,\r\n    which he always returned to them as soon as translated.\r\n\r\n    \"The Persian Translator has received from Mr. Scott, since the late\r\n    Governor-General's departure, a trunk containing English draughts\r\n    and translations and the Persian originals of letters and papers,\r\n    with three books in the Persian language containing copies of\r\n    letters written between August, 1782, and January, 1785; and if the\r\n    Board should please to order the secretaries of the general\r\n    department to furnish him with copies of all translations and\r\n    draughts recorded in their Consultations between the 1st of January,\r\n    1782, and the 31st of January, 1785, he thinks that he should be\r\n    able, with what he has found in Captain Scott's trunk, to make up\r\n    the correspondence for that period.\r\n\r\n        (Signed) \"EDWARD COLEBROOKE,\r\n            \"_Persian Translator._\"\r\n\r\nHear, then, my Lords, what becomes of the records of the Company, which\r\nwere to be the vouchers for every public act,--which were to show\r\nwhether, in the Company's transactions, agreements, and treaties with\r\nthe native powers, the public faith was kept or not. You see them all\r\ncrammed into Mr. Scott's trunk: a trunk into which they put what they\r\nplease, take out what they please, suppress what they please, or thrust\r\nin whatever will answer their purpose. The records of the\r\nGovernor-General and Council of Bengal are kept in Captain Jonathan\r\nScott's trunk; this trunk is to be considered as the real and true\r\nchannel of intelligence between the Company and the country powers. But\r\neven this channel was not open to any member of the Council, except Mr.\r\nHastings; and when the Council, for the first time, daring to think for\r\nthemselves, call upon the Persian Translator, he knows nothing about it.\r\nWe find that it is given into the hands of a person nominated by Mr.\r\nHastings,--Major Davy. What do the Company know of him? Why, he was Mr.\r\nHastings's private secretary. In this manner the Council have been\r\nannihilated during all these transactions, and have no other knowledge\r\nof them than just what Mr. Hastings and his trunk-keeper thought proper\r\nto give them. All, then, that we know of these transactions is from the\r\nmiserable, imperfect, garbled correspondence.\r\n\r\nBut even if these papers contained a full and faithful account of the\r\ncorrespondence, what we charge is its not being delivered to the Council\r\nas it occurred from time to time. Mr. Hastings kept the whole government\r\nof Oude in his own hands; so that the Council had no power of judging\r\nhis acts, of checking, controlling, advising, or remonstrating. It was\r\ntotally annihilated by him; and we charge, as an act of treason and\r\nrebellion against the act of Parliament by which he held his office, his\r\ndepriving the Council of their legitimate authority, by shutting them\r\nout from the knowledge of all affairs,--except, indeed, when he thought\r\nit expedient, for his own justification, to have their nominal\r\nconcurrence or subsequent acquiescence in any of his more violent\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see Mr. Hastings's system, a system of concealment, a\r\nsystem of turning the vassals of the Company into his own vassals, to\r\nmake them contributory, not to the Company, but to himself. He has\r\navowed this system in Benares; he has avowed it in Oude. It was his\r\nconstant practice. Your Lordships see in Oude he kept a correspondence\r\nwith Mr. Markham for years, and did alone all the material acts which\r\nought to have been done in Council. He delegated a power to Mr. Markham\r\nwhich he had not to delegate; and you will see he has done the same in\r\nevery part of India.\r\n\r\nWe first charge him not only with acting without authority, but with a\r\nstrong presumption, founded on his concealment, of intending to act\r\nmischievously. We next charge his concealing and withdrawing\r\ncorrespondence, as being directly contrary to the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, the practice of his office, and the very nature and existence\r\nof the Council in which he was appointed to preside. We charge this as a\r\nsubstantive crime, and as the forerunner of the oppression, desolation,\r\nand ruin of that miserable country.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings having thus rendered the Council blind and ignorant, and\r\nconsequently fit for subserviency, what does he next do? I am speaking,\r\nnot with regard to the time of his particular acts, but with regard to\r\nthe general spirit of the proceedings. He next flies in the face of the\r\nCompany upon the same principle on which he removed Mr. Fowke from\r\nBenares. \"I removed _him_ on political grounds,\" says he, \"against the\r\norders of the Court of Directors, because I thought it necessary that\r\nthe Resident should be a man of my own nomination and confidence.\" At\r\nOude he proceeds on the same principle. Mr. Bristow had been nominated\r\nto the office of Resident by the Court of Directors. Mr. Hastings, by an\r\nact of Parliament, was ordered to obey the Court of Directors. He\r\npositively refuses to receive Mr. Bristow, for no other reason that we\r\nknow of but because he was nominated by the Court of Directors; he\r\ndefies the Court, and declares in effect that they shall not govern that\r\nprovince, but that he will govern it by a Resident of his own.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will mark his progress in the establishment of that new\r\nsystem, which, he says, he had been obliged to adopt by the evil system\r\nof his predecessors. First, he annihilates the Council, formed by an act\r\nof Parliament, and by order of the Court of Directors. In the second\r\nplace, he defies the order of the Court, who had the undoubted\r\nnomination of all their own servants, and who ordered him, under the\r\nseverest injunction, to appoint Mr. Bristow to the office of Resident in\r\nOude. He for some time refused to nominate Mr. Bristow to that office;\r\nand even when he was forced, against his will, to permit him for a while\r\nto be there, he sent Mr. Middleton and Mr. Johnson, who annihilated Mr.\r\nBristow's authority so completely that no one public act passed through\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nAfter he had ended this conflict with the Directors, and had entirely\r\nshook off their authority, he resolved that the native powers should\r\nknow that they were not to look to the Court of Directors, but to look\r\nto his arbitrary will in all things; and therefore, to the astonishment\r\nof the world, and as if it were designedly to expose the nakedness of\r\nthe Parliament of Great Britain, to expose the nakedness of the laws of\r\nGreat Britain, and the nakedness of the authority of the Court of\r\nDirectors to the country powers, he wrote a letter, which your Lordships\r\nwill find in page 795 of the printed Minutes. In this letter the secret\r\nof his government is discovered to the country powers. They are given to\r\nunderstand, that, whatever exaction, whatever oppression or ruin they\r\nmay suffer, they are to look nowhere for relief but to him: not to the\r\nCouncil, not to the Court of Directors, not to the sovereign authority\r\nof Great Britain, but to him, and him only.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to this letter, we will first read to you the Minute\r\nof Council by which he dismissed Mr. Bristow upon a former occasion, (it\r\nis in page 507 of the printed Minutes,) that your Lordships may see his\r\naudacious defiance of the laws of the country. We wish, I say, before we\r\nshow you the horrible and fatal effects of this his defiance, to impress\r\ncontinually upon your Lordships' minds that this man is to be tried by\r\nthe laws of the country, and that it is not in his power to annihilate\r\ntheir authority and the authority of his masters. We insist upon it,\r\nthat every man under the authority of this country is bound to obey its\r\nlaws. This minute relates to his first removal of Mr. Bristow: I read it\r\nin order to show that he dared to defy the Court of Directors so early\r\nas the year 1776.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Mr. John Bristow be recalled to the Presidency from the\r\ncourt of the Nabob of Oude, and that Mr. Nathaniel Middleton be restored\r\nto the appointment of Resident at that court, subject to the orders and\r\nauthority of the Governor-General and Council, conformably to the motion\r\nof the Governor-General.\"\r\n\r\nI will next read to your Lordships the orders of the Directors for his\r\nreinstatement, on the 4th of July, 1777.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the most careful perusal of your proceedings upon the 2d of\r\nDecember, 1776, relative to the recall of Mr. Bristow from the court of\r\nthe Nabob of Oude, and the appointment of Mr. Nathaniel Middleton to\r\nthat station, we must declare our strongest disapprobation of the whole\r\nof that transaction. We observe that the Governor-General's motion for\r\nthe recall of Mr. Bristow includes that for the restoration of Mr.\r\nNathaniel Middleton; but as neither of those measures appear to us\r\nnecessary, or even justifiable, they cannot receive our approbation.\r\nWith respect to Mr. Bristow, we find no shadow of charge against him. It\r\nappears that he has executed his trust to the entire satisfaction even\r\nof those members of the Council who did not concur in his appointment.\r\nYou have unanimously recommended him to our notice; attention to your\r\nrecommendation has induced us to afford him marks of our favor, and to\r\nreannex the emoluments affixed by you to his appointment, which had been\r\ndiscontinued by our order; and as we must be of opinion that a person of\r\nacknowledged abilities, whose conduct has thus gained him the esteem of\r\nhis superiors, ought not to be degraded without just cause, we do not\r\nhesitate to interpose in his behalf, and therefore direct that Mr.\r\nBristow do forthwith return to his station of Resident at Oude, from\r\nwhich he has been so improperly removed.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of these orders by the Council, Mr. Francis, then a\r\nmember of the Council, moves, \"That, in obedience to the Company's\r\norders, Mr. Bristow be forthwith appointed and directed to return to his\r\nstation of Resident at Oude, and that Mr. Purling be ordered to deliver\r\nover charge of the office to Mr. Bristow immediately on his arrival, and\r\nreturn himself forthwith to the Presidency; also that the\r\nGovernor-General be requested to furnish Mr. Bristow with the usual\r\nletter of credence to the Nabob Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this motion being made, Mr. Hastings entered the following minute.\r\n\r\n\"I will ask, who is Mr. Bristow, that a member of the administration\r\nshould at such a time hold him forth as an instrument for the\r\ndegradation of the first executive member of this government? What are\r\nthe professed objects of his appointment? What are the merits and\r\nservices, or what the qualifications, which entitle him to such an\r\nuncommon distinction? Is it for his superior integrity, or from his\r\neminent abilities, that he is to be dignified, at such hazards of every\r\nconsideration that ought to influence members of this administration? Of\r\nthe former I know no proofs; I am sure that it is not an evidence of it,\r\nthat he has been enabled to make himself the principal in such a\r\ncompetition; and for the test of his abilities, I appeal to the letter\r\nwhich he has dared to write to this board, and which, I am ashamed to\r\nsay, we have suffered. I desire that a copy of it may be inserted in\r\nthis day's proceedings, that it may stand before the eyes of every\r\nmember of the board, when he shall give his vote upon a question for\r\ngiving their confidence to a man, their servant, who has publicly\r\ninsulted them, his masters, and the members of the government, to whom\r\nhe owes his obedience; who, assuming an association with the Court of\r\nDirectors, and erecting himself into a tribunal, has arraigned them for\r\ndisobedience of orders, passed judgment upon them, and condemned or\r\nacquitted them as their magistrate and superior. Let the board consider\r\nwhether a man possessed of so independent a spirit, who has already\r\nshown such a contempt of their authority, who has shown himself so\r\nwretched an advocate for his own cause and negotiator for his own\r\ninterest, is fit to be trusted with the guardianship of their honor, the\r\nexecution of their measures, and as their confidential manager and\r\nnegotiator with the princes of India.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you here see an instance of what I have before stated to your\r\nLordships, and what I shall take the liberty of recommending to your\r\nconstant consideration. You see that a tyrant and a rebel is one and the\r\nsame thing. You see this man, at the very time that he is a direct rebel\r\nto the Company, arbitrarily and tyrannically displacing Mr. Bristow,\r\nalthough he had previously joined in the approbation of his conduct, and\r\nin voting him a pecuniary reward. He is ordered by the Court of\r\nDirectors to restore that person, who desires, in a suppliant, decent,\r\nproper tone, that the Company's orders should produce their effect, and\r\nthat the Council would have the goodness to restore him to his\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have seen the audacious insolence, the tyrannical pride,\r\nwith which he dares to treat this order. You have seen the recorded\r\nminute which he has dared to send to the Court of Directors; and in\r\nthis you see, that, when he cannot directly asperse a man's conduct, and\r\nhas nothing to say against it, he maliciously, I should perhaps rather\r\nsay enviously, insinuates that he had unjustly made his fortune. \"You\r\nare,\" says he, \"to judge from the independence of his manner and style,\r\nwhether he could or no have got that without some unjust means.\" God\r\nforbid I should ever be able to invent anything that can equal the\r\nimpudence of what this man dares to write to his superiors, or the\r\ninsolent style in which he dares to treat persons who are not his\r\nservants!\r\n\r\nWho made the servants of the Company the master of the servants of the\r\nCompany? The Court of Directors are their fellow-servants; they are all\r\nthe servants of this kingdom. Still the claim of a fellow-servant to\r\nhold an office which the Court of Directors had legally appointed him to\r\nis considered by this audacious tyrant as an insult to him. By this you\r\nmay judge how he treats not only the servants of the Company, but the\r\nnatives of the country, and by what means he has brought them into that\r\nabject state of servitude in which they are ready to do anything he\r\nwishes and to sign anything he dictates. I must again beg your Lordships\r\nto remark what this man has had the folly and impudence to place upon\r\nthe records of the Council of which he was President; and I will venture\r\nto assert that so extraordinary a performance never before appeared on\r\nthe records of any court, Eastern or European. Because Mr. Bristow\r\nclaims an office which is his right and his freehold as long as the\r\nCompany chooses, Mr. Hastings accuses him of being an accomplice with\r\nthe Court of Directors in a conspiracy against him; and because, after\r\nlong delays, he had presented an humble petition to have the Court of\r\nDirectors' orders in his favor carried into execution, he says \"he has\r\nerected himself into a tribunal of justice; that he has arraigned the\r\nCouncil for disobedience of orders, passed judgment upon them, and\r\ncondemned or acquitted them as their magistrate and superior.\"\r\n\r\nLet us suppose his Majesty to have been pleased to appoint any one to an\r\noffice in the gift of the crown, what should we think of the person\r\nwhose business it was to execute the King's commands, if he should say\r\nto the person appointed, when he claimed his office, \"You shall not have\r\nit, you assume to be my superior, and you disgrace and dishonor me\"?\r\nGood God! my Lords, where was this language learned? in what country,\r\nand in what barbarous nation of Hottentots was this jargon picked up?\r\nFor there is no Eastern court that I ever heard of (and I believe I have\r\nbeen as conversant with the manners and customs of the East as most\r\npersons whose business has not directly led them into that country)\r\nwhere such conduct would have been tolerated. A bashaw, if he should be\r\nordered by the Grand Seignior to invest another with his office, puts\r\nthe letter upon his head, and obedience immediately follows.\r\n\r\nBut the obedience of a barbarous magistrate should not be compared to\r\nthe obedience which a British subject owes to the laws of his country.\r\nMr. Hastings receives an order which he should have instantly obeyed. He\r\nis reminded of this by the person who suffers from his disobedience; and\r\nthis proves that person to be possessed of too independent a spirit. Ay,\r\nmy Lords, here is the grievance;--no man can dare show in India an\r\nindependent spirit. It is this, and not his having shown such a\r\ncontempt of their authority, not his having shown himself so wretched an\r\nadvocate for his own cause and so had a negotiator for his own interest,\r\nthat makes him unfit to be trusted with the guardianship of their honor,\r\nthe execution of their measures, and to be their confidential manager\r\nand negotiator with the princes of India.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, what is this want of skill which Mr. Bristow has shown in\r\nnegotiating his own affairs? Mr. Hastings will inform us. \"He should\r\nhave pocketed the letter of the Court of Directors; he should never have\r\nmade the least mention of it. He should have come to my banian, Cantoo\r\nBaboo; he should have offered him a bribe upon the occasion. That would\r\nhave been the way to succeed with me, who am a public-spirited taker of\r\nbribes and nuzzers. But this base fool, this man, who is but a vile\r\nnegotiator for his own interest, has dared to accept the patronage of\r\nthe Court of Directors. He should have secured the protection of Cantoo\r\nBaboo, their more efficient rival. This would have been the skilful mode\r\nof doing the business.\" But this man, it seems, had not only shown\r\nhimself an unskilful negotiator, he had likewise afforded evidence of\r\nhis want of integrity. And what is this evidence? His having \"enabled\r\nhimself to become the _principal_ in such a competition.\" That is to\r\nsay, he had, by his meritorious conduct in the service of his masters,\r\nthe Directors, obtained their approbation and favor. Mr. Hastings then\r\ncontemptuously adds, \"And for the test of his abilities, I appeal to the\r\nletter which he has dared to write to the board, and which I am ashamed\r\nto say we have suffered.\" Whatever that letter may be, I will venture to\r\nsay there is not a word or syllable in it that tastes of such insolence\r\nand arbitrariness with regard to the servants of the Company, his\r\nfellow-servants, of such audacious rebellion with regard to the laws of\r\nhis country, as are contained in this minute of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, why did he choose to have Mr. Middleton appointed\r\nResident? Your Lordships have not seen Mr. Bristow: you have only heard\r\nof him as a humble suppliant to have the orders of the Company obeyed.\r\nBut you have seen Mr. Middleton. You know that Mr. Middleton is a good\r\nman to keep a secret: I describe him no further. You know what\r\nqualifications Mr. Hastings requires in a favorite. You also know why he\r\nwas turned out of his employment, with the approbation of the Court of\r\nDirectors: that it was principally because, when Resident in Oude, he\r\npositively, audaciously, and rebelliously refused to lay before the\r\nCouncil the correspondence with the country powers. He says he gave it\r\nup to Mr. Hastings. Whether he has or has not destroyed it we know not;\r\nall we know of it is, that it is not found to this hour. We cannot even\r\nfind Mr. Middleton's trunk, though Mr. Jonathan Scott did at last\r\nproduce his. The whole of the Persian correspondence, during Mr.\r\nMiddleton's Residence, was refused, as I have said, to the board at\r\nCalcutta and to the Court of Directors,--was refused to the legal\r\nauthorities; and Mr. Middleton, for that very refusal, was again\r\nappointed by Mr. Hastings to supersede Mr. Bristow, removed without a\r\npretence of offence; he received, I say, this appointment from Mr.\r\nHastings, as a reward for that servile compliance by which he dissolved\r\nevery tie between himself and his legal masters.\r\n\r\nThe matter being now brought to a simple issue, whether the\r\nGovernor-General is or is not bound to obey his superiors, I shall here\r\nleave it with your Lordships; and I have only to beg your Lordships will\r\nremark the course of events as they follow each other,--keeping in mind\r\nthat the prisoner at your bar declared Mr. Bristow to be a man of\r\nsuspected integrity, on account of his independence, and deficient in\r\nability, because he did not know how best to promote his own interest.\r\n\r\nI must here state to your Lordships, that it was the duty of the\r\nResident to transact the money concerns of the Company, as well as its\r\npolitical negotiations. You will now see how Mr. Hastings divided that\r\nduty, after he became apprehensive that the Court of Directors might be\r\ninclined to assert their own authority, and to assert it in a proper\r\nmanner, which they so rarely did. When, therefore, his passion had\r\ncooled, when his resentment of those violent indignities which had been\r\noffered to him, namely, the indignity of being put in mind that he had\r\nany superior under heaven, (for I know of no other,) he adopts the\r\nexpedient of dividing the Residency into two offices; he makes a fair\r\ncompromise between himself and the Directors; he appoints Mr. Middleton\r\nto the management of the money concerns, and Mr. Bristow to that of the\r\npolitical affairs. Your Lordships see that Mr. Bristow, upon whom he had\r\nfixed the disqualification for political affairs, was the very person\r\nappointed to that department; and to Mr. Middleton, the man of his\r\nconfidence, he gives the management of the money transactions. He\r\ndiscovers plainly where his heart was: for where your treasure is, there\r\nwill your heart be also. This private agent, this stifler of\r\ncorrespondence, a man whose costive retention discovers no secret\r\ncommitted to him, and whose slippery memory is subject to a diarrhoea\r\nwhich permits everything he did know to escape,--this very man he places\r\nin a situation where his talents could only be useful for concealment,\r\nand where concealment could only be used to cover fraud; while Mr.\r\nBristow, who was by his official engagement responsible to the Company\r\nfor fair and clear accounts, was appointed superintendent of political\r\naffairs, an office for which Mr. Hastings declared he was totally unfit.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you will judge of the designs which the prisoner had in\r\ncontemplation, when he dared to commit this act of rebellion against the\r\nCompany; you will see that it could not have been any other than getting\r\nthe money transactions of Oude into his own hands. The presumption of a\r\ncorrupt motive is here as strong as, I believe, it possibly can be.\r\n\r\nThe next point to which I have to direct your Lordships' attention is\r\nthat part of the prisoner's conduct, in this matter, by which he exposed\r\nthe nakedness of the Company's authority to the native powers. You would\r\nimagine, that, after the first dismissal of Mr. Bristow, Mr. Hastings\r\nwould have done with him forever; that nothing could have induced him\r\nagain to bring forward a man who had dared to insult him, a man who had\r\nshown an independent spirit, a man who had dishonored the Council and\r\ninsulted his masters, a man of doubtful integrity and convicted\r\nunfitness for office. But, my Lords, in the face of all this, he\r\nafterwards sends this very man, with undivided authority, into the\r\ncountry as sole Resident. And now your Lordships shall hear in what\r\nmanner he accounts for this appointment to Gobind Ram, the _vakeel_, or\r\nambassador, of the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah at Calcutta. It is in page 795\r\nof the printed Minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of an Arzee sent by Rajah Gobind Ram to the Vizier, by the\r\n    Governor-General's directions, and written the 27th of August,\r\n    1782._\r\n\r\n    \"This day the Governor-General sent for me in private. After\r\n    recapitulating the various informations he had received respecting\r\n    the anarchy and confusion said to reign throughout your Highness's\r\n    country, and complains that neither your Highness, or Hyder Beg\r\n    Khân, or Mr. Middleton, or Mr. Johnson, ever wrote to him on the\r\n    state of your affairs, or, if he ever received a letter from your\r\n    presence, it always contained assertions contrary to the above\r\n    informations, the Governor-General proceeded as follows.\r\n\r\n    \"That it was his intention to have appointed Mr. David Anderson to\r\n    attend upon your Highness, but that he was still with Sindia, and\r\n    there was no prospect of his speedy return from his camp; therefore\r\n    it was now his wish to appoint Mr. John Bristow, who was well\r\n    experienced in business, to Lucknow. That, when Mr. Bristow formerly\r\n    held the office of Resident there, he was not appointed by him; and\r\n    that, notwithstanding he had not shown any instances of\r\n    disobedience, yet he had deemed it necessary to recall him, because\r\n    he had been patronized and appointed by gentlemen who were in\r\n    opposition to him, and had counteracted and thwarted all his\r\n    measures; that this had been his reason for recalling Mr. Bristow.\r\n    That, since Mr. Francis's return to Europe, and the arrival of\r\n    information there of the deaths of the other gentlemen, the King and\r\n    the Company had declared their approbation of his, the\r\n    Governor-General's, conduct, and had conferred upon him the most\r\n    ample powers; that they had sent out Mr. Macpherson, who was his\r\n    old and particular friend; and that Mr. Stables, that was on his way\r\n    here as a member of the Supreme Council, was also his particular\r\n    friend; that Mr. Wheler had received letters from Europe, informing\r\n    him that the members of the Council were enjoined all of them to\r\n    coöperate and act in conjunction with him, in every measure which\r\n    should be agreeable to him; and that there was no one in Council now\r\n    who was not united with him, and consequently that his authority was\r\n    perfect and complete. That Mr. Bristow, as it was known to me, had\r\n    returned to Europe; but that during his stay there he had never said\r\n    anything disrespectful of him or endeavored to injure him; on the\r\n    contrary, he had received accounts from Europe that Mr. Bristow had\r\n    spoken much in his praise, so that Mr. Bristow's friends had become\r\n    his friends; that Mr. Bristow had lately been introduced to him by\r\n    Mr. Macpherson, had explained his past conduct perfectly to his\r\n    satisfaction, and had requested from him the appointment to Lucknow,\r\n    and had declared, in the event of his obtaining the appointment,\r\n    that he should show every mark of attention and obedience to the\r\n    pleasure of your Highness, and his, the Governor's, saying, that\r\n    your Highness was well pleased with him, and that he knew what you\r\n    had written formerly was at the instigation of Mr. Middleton. That,\r\n    in consequence of the foregoing, he, the Governor, had determined to\r\n    have appointed Mr. Bristow to Lucknow, but had postponed his\r\n    dismission to his office for the following reasons, _videlicet_,\r\n    people at Lucknow might think that Mr. Bristow had obtained his\r\n    appointment in consequence of orders from Europe, and contrary to\r\n    the Governor's inclination; but as the contrary was the case, and\r\n    as he now considered Mr. Bristow as the object of his own particular\r\n    patronage, therefore he directed me to forward Mr. Bristow's arzee\r\n    to the presence; and that it was the Governor's wish that your\r\n    Highness, on the receipt thereof, would write a letter to him, and,\r\n    as from yourself, request of him that Mr. Bristow may be appointed\r\n    to Lucknow, and that you would write an answer to this arzee,\r\n    expressive of your personal satisfaction, on the subject. The\r\n    Governor concluded with injunctions, that, until the arrival of your\r\n    Highness's letter requesting the appointment of Mr. Bristow, and\r\n    your answer to this arzee, that I should keep the particulars of\r\n    this conversation a profound secret; for that the communication of\r\n    it to any person whatever would not only cause his displeasure, but\r\n    would throw affairs at Lucknow into great confusion.\r\n\r\n    \"The preceding is the substance of the Governor's directions to me.\r\n    He afterwards went to Mr. Macpherson's, and I attended him. Mr.\r\n    Bristow was there; the Governor took Mr. Bristow's arzee from his\r\n    hand and delivered it into mine, and thence proceeded to Council.\r\n    Mr. Bristow's arzee, and the following particulars, I transmit and\r\n    communicate by the Governor's directions; and I request that I may\r\n    be favored with the answer to the arzee and the letter to the\r\n    Governor as soon as possible, as his injunctions to me were very\r\n    particular on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have to observe upon this very extraordinary transaction,\r\nthat you will see many things in this letter that are curious, and\r\nworthy of being taken out of that abyss of secrets, Mr. Scott's trunk,\r\nin which this arzee was found. It contains, as far as the prisoner\r\nthinks proper to reveal it, the true secret of the transaction.\r\n\r\nHe confesses, first, the state of the Vizier's country, as communicated\r\nto him in various accounts of the anarchy and confusion said to reign\r\nthroughout his territories. This was in the year 1782, during the time\r\nthat the Oude correspondence was not communicated to the Council.\r\n\r\nHe next stated, that neither the Vizier, nor his minister, nor Mr.\r\nMiddleton, nor Mr. Johnson, ever wrote to him on the state of affairs.\r\nHere, then, are three or four persons, all nominated by himself, every\r\none of them supposed to be in his strictest confidence,--the Nabob and\r\nhis vassal, Hyder Beg Khân, being, as we shall show afterwards, entirely\r\nhis dependants,--and yet Mr. Hastings declares, that not one of them had\r\ndone their duty, or had written him one word concerning the state of the\r\ncountry, and the anarchy and confusion that prevailed in it, and that,\r\nwhen the Nabob did write, his assertions were contrary to the real state\r\nof things. Now this irregular correspondence, which he carried on at\r\nLucknow, and which gave him, as he pretends, this contradictory\r\ninformation, was, as your Lordships will see, nothing more or less than\r\na complete fraud.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will next observe, that he tells the vakeel his reason\r\nfor turning him out was, that he had been patronized by other gentlemen.\r\nThis was true: but they had a right to patronize him; and they did not\r\npatronize him from private motives, but in direct obedience to the order\r\nof the Court of Directors. He then adds the assurance which he had\r\nreceived from Mr. Bristow, that he would be perfectly obedient to him,\r\nMr. Hastings, in future; and he goes on to tell the vakeel that he knew\r\nthe Vizier was once well pleased with him, (Mr. Bristow,) and that his\r\nformal complaints against him were written at the instigation of Mr.\r\nMiddleton.\r\n\r\nHere is another discovery, my Lords. When he recalled Mr. Bristow, he\r\ndid it under the pretence of its being desired by the Nabob of Oude; and\r\nthat, consequently, he would not keep at the Nabob's court a man that\r\nwas disagreeable to him. Yet, when the thing comes to be opened, it\r\nappears that Mr. Middleton had made the Nabob, unwillingly, write a\r\nfalse letter. This subornation of falsehood appears also to have been\r\nknown to Mr. Hastings. Did he, either as the natural guardian and\r\nprotector of the reputation of his fellow-servants, or as the official\r\nadministrator of the laws of his country, or as a faithful servant of\r\nthe Company, ever call Mr. Middleton to an account for it? No, never. To\r\neverybody, therefore, acquainted with the characters and circumstances\r\nof the parties concerned, the conclusion will appear evident that he was\r\nhimself the author of it. But your Lordships will find there is no end\r\nof his insolence and duplicity.\r\n\r\nHe next tells the vakeel, that the reason why he postponed the mission\r\nof Mr. Bristow to Lucknow was lest the people of Lucknow should think he\r\nhad obtained his appointment in consequence of orders from Europe, and\r\ncontrary to the Governor's inclination. You see, my Lords, he would have\r\nthe people of the country believe that they are to receive the person\r\nappointed Resident not as appointed by the Company, but in consequence\r\nof his being under Mr. Hastings's particular patronage; and to remove\r\nfrom them any suspicion that the Resident would obey the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, or any orders but his own, he proceeds in the manner\r\nI have read to your Lordships.\r\n\r\nYou here see the whole machinery of the business. He removes Mr.\r\nBristow, contrary to the orders of the Court of Directors. Why? Because,\r\nsays he to the Court of Directors, the Nabob complained of him, and\r\ndesired it. He here says, that he knew the Nabob did not desire it, but\r\nthat the letter of complaint really and substantially was Mr.\r\nMiddleton's. Lastly, as he recalls Mr. Bristow, so he wishes him to be\r\ncalled back in the same fictitious and fraudulent manner. This system of\r\nfraud proves that there is not one letter from that country, not one act\r\nof this Vizier, not one act of his ministers, not one act of his\r\nambassadors, but what is false and fraudulent. And now think, my Lords,\r\nfirst, of the slavery of the Company's servants, subjected in this\r\nmanner to the arbitrary will and corrupt frauds of Mr. Hastings! Next\r\nthink of the situation of the princes of the country, obliged to\r\ncomplain without matter of complaint, to approve without [ground?] of\r\nsatisfaction, and to have all their correspondence fabricated by Mr.\r\nHastings at Calcutta!\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, it was not indignities of this kind alone that the native\r\nprinces suffered from this system of fraud and duplicity. Their more\r\nessential interests, and those of the people, were involved in it; it\r\npervaded and poisoned the whole mass of their internal government.\r\n\r\nWho was the instrument employed in all this double-dealing? Gobind Ram,\r\nthe Vizier's diplomatic minister at Calcutta. Suspicions perpetually\r\narise in his mind whether he is not cheated and imposed upon. He could\r\nnever tell when he had Mr. Hastings fixed upon any point. He now finds\r\nhim recommending Mr. Middleton, and then declaring that Mr. Middleton\r\nneglects the duty of his office, and gives him, Gobind Ram, information\r\nthat is fraudulent and directly contrary to the truth. He is let into\r\nvarious contradictory secrets, and becomes acquainted with innumerable\r\nfrauds, falsehoods, and prevarications. He knew that the whole pretended\r\ngovernment of Oude was from beginning to end a deception; that it was an\r\nimposture for the purpose of corruption and peculation. Such was the\r\nsituation of the Nabob's vakeel. The Nabob himself was really at a loss\r\nto know who had and who had not the Governor's confidence; whether he\r\nwas acting in obedience to the orders of the Court of Directors, or\r\nwhether their orders were not always to be disobeyed. He thus writes to\r\nGobind Ram, who was exactly in the same uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"As to the commands of Mr. Hastings which you write on the subject of\r\nthe distraction of the country and the want of information from me, and\r\nhis wishes, that, as Mr. John Bristow has shown sincere wishes and\r\nattachment to Mr. Hastings, I should write for him to send Mr. John\r\nBristow, it would have been proper and necessary for you privately to\r\nhave understood what were Mr. Hastings's real intentions, whether the\r\nchoice of sending Mr. John Bristow was his own desire, or whether it was\r\nin compliance with Mr. Macpherson's, that I might then have written\r\nconformably thereto. Writings are now sent to you for both cases; having\r\nprivately understood the wishes of Mr. Hastings, deliver whichever of\r\nthe writings he should order you; for I study Mr. Hastings's\r\nsatisfaction; whoever is his friend is mine, and whoever is his enemy is\r\nmine. But in both these cases, my wishes are the same; that having\r\nconsented to the paper of questions which Major Davy carried with him,\r\nand having given me the authority of the country, whomever he may\r\nafterwards appoint, I am satisfied. I am now brought to great distress\r\nby these gentlemen, who ruin me; in case of consent, I am contented with\r\nMajors Davy and Palmer. Hereafter, whatever may be Mr. Hastings's\r\ndesire, it is best.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a poor, miserable instrument, confessing himself to be such,\r\nruined by Mr. Hastings's public agents, Mr. Middleton and Mr. Johnson;\r\nruined by his private agents, Major Davy and Major Palmer; ruined\r\nequally by them all; and at last declaring in a tone of despair, \"If you\r\nhave a mind really to keep Major Davy and Major Palmer here, why, I must\r\nconsent to it. Do what you please with me, I am your creature; for God's\r\nsake, let me have a little rest.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships shall next hear what account Hyder Beg Khân, the Vizier's\r\nprime-minister, gives of the situation in which he and his master were\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of a Letter from Hyder Beg Khân, received 21st April,\r\n    1785._\r\n\r\n    \"I hope that such orders and commands as relate to the friendship\r\n    between his Highness and the Company's governments and to your will\r\n    may be sent through Major Palmer, in your own private letters, or in\r\n    your letters to the Major, who is appointed from you at the presence\r\n    of his Highness, that, in obedience to your orders, he may properly\r\n    explain your commands, and, whatever affair may be settled, he may\r\n    first secretly inform you of it, and afterwards his Highness may,\r\n    conformably thereto, write an answer, and I also may represent it.\r\n    By this system, your pleasure will always be fully made known to his\r\n    Highness; and his Highness and we will execute whatever may be your\r\n    orders, without deviating a hair's-breadth: and let not the\r\n    representations of interested persons be approved of, because his\r\n    Highness makes no opposition to your will; and I, your servant, am\r\n    ready in obedience and service, and I make no excuses.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, was there ever such a discovery made of the arcana of any\r\npublic theatre? You see here, behind the ostensible scenery, all the\r\ncrooked working of the machinery developed and laid open to the world.\r\nYou now see by what secret movement the master of the mechanism has\r\nconducted the great Indian opera,--an opera of fraud, deceptions, and\r\nharlequin tricks. You have it all laid open before you. The ostensible\r\nscene is drawn aside; it has vanished from your sight. All the strutting\r\nsignors, and all the soft signoras are gone; and instead of a brilliant\r\nspectacle of descending chariots, gods, goddesses, sun, moon, and stars,\r\nyou have nothing to gaze on but sticks, wire, ropes, and machinery. You\r\nfind the appearance all false and fraudulent; and you see the whole\r\ntrick at once. All this, my Lords, we owe to Major Scott's trunk, which,\r\nby admitting us behind the scene, has enabled us to discover the real\r\nstate of Mr. Hastings's government in India. And can your Lordships\r\nbelieve that all this mechanism of fraud, prevarication, and falsehood\r\ncould have been intended for any purpose but to forward that robbery,\r\ncorruption, and peculation by which Mr. Hastings has destroyed one of\r\nthe finest countries upon earth? Is it necessary, after this, for me to\r\ntell you that you are not to believe one word of the correspondence\r\nstated by him to have been received from India? This discovery goes to\r\nthe whole matter of the whole government of the country. You have seen\r\nwhat that government was, and by-and-by you shall see the effects of it.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now seen this trunk of Mr. Scott's producing the\r\neffects of Aladdin's lamp,--of which your Lordships may read in books\r\nmuch more worthy of credit than Mr. Hastings's correspondence. I have\r\ngiven all the credit of this precious discovery to Mr. Scott's trunk;\r\nbut, my Lords, I find that I have to ask pardon for a mistake in\r\nsupposing the letter of Hyder Beg Khân to be a part of Mr. Hastings's\r\ncorrespondence. It comes from another quarter, not much less singular,\r\nand equally authentic and unimpeachable. But though it is not from the\r\ntrunk, it smells of the trunk, it smells of the leather. I was as proud\r\nof my imaginary discovery as Sancho Panza was that one of his ancestors\r\nhad discovered a taste of iron in some wine, and another a taste of\r\nleather in the same wine, and that afterwards there was found in the\r\ncask a little key tied to a thong of leather, which had given to the\r\nwine a taste of both. Now, whether this letter tasted of the leather of\r\nthe trunk or of the iron of Mr. Macpherson, I confess I was a little\r\nout in my suggestion and my taste. The letter in question was written by\r\nHyder Beg Khân, after Mr. Hastings's departure, to Mr. Macpherson, when\r\nhe succeeded to the government. That gentleman thus got possession of a\r\nkey to the trunk; and it appears to have been his intentions to follow\r\nthe steps of his predecessor, to act exactly in the same manner, and in\r\nthe same manner to make the Nabob the instrument of his own ruin. This\r\nletter was written by the Nabob's minister to Sir John Macpherson, newly\r\ninaugurated into his government, and who might be supposed not to be\r\nacquainted with all the best of Mr. Hastings's secrets, nor to have had\r\nall the trunk correspondence put into his hands. However, here is a\r\ntrunk extraordinary, and its contents are much in the manner of the\r\nother. The Nabob's minister acquaints him with the whole secret of the\r\nsystem. It is plain that the Nabob considered it as a system not to be\r\naltered: that there was to be nothing true, nothing aboveboard, nothing\r\nopen in the government of his affairs. When you thus see that there can\r\nbe little doubt of the true nature of the government, I am sure that\r\nhereafter, when we come to consider the effects of that government, it\r\nwill clear up and bring home to the prisoner at your bar all we shall\r\nhave to say upon this subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, having thrown off completely the authority of the Company,\r\nas you have seen,--having trampled upon those of their servants who had\r\nmanifested any symptom of independence, or who considered the orders of\r\nthe Directors as a rule of their conduct,--having brought every\r\nEnglishman under his yoke, and made them supple and fit instruments for\r\nall his designs,--then gave it to be understood that such alone were\r\nfit persons to be employed in important affairs of state. Consider, my\r\nLords, the effect of this upon the whole service. Not one man that\r\nappears to pay any regard to the authority of the Directors is to expect\r\nthat any regard will be paid to himself. So that this man not only\r\nrebels himself, in his own person, against the authority of the Company,\r\nbut he makes all their servants join him in this very rebellion. Think,\r\nmy Lords, of this state of things,--and I wish it never to pass from\r\nyour minds that I have called him the captain-general of the whole host\r\nof actors in Indian iniquity, under whom that host was arrayed,\r\ndisciplined, and paid. This language which I used was not, as fools have\r\nthought proper to call it, offensive and abusive; it is in a proper\r\ncriminatory tone, justified by the facts that I have stated to you, and\r\nin every step we take it is justified more and more. I take it as a text\r\nupon which I mean to preach; I take it as a text which I wish to have in\r\nyour Lordships' memory from the beginning to the end of this proceeding.\r\nHe is not only guilty of iniquity himself, but is at the head of a\r\nsystem of iniquity and rebellion, and will not suffer with impunity any\r\none honest man to exist in India, if he can help it. Every mark of\r\nobedience to the legal authority of the Company is by him condemned; and\r\nif there is any virtue remaining in India, as I think there is, it is\r\nnot his fault that it still exists there.\r\n\r\nWe have shown you the servile obedience of the natives of the country;\r\nwe have shown you the miserable situation to which a great prince, at\r\nleast a person who was the other day a great prince, was reduced by Mr.\r\nHastings's system. We shall next show you that this prince, who,\r\nunfortunately for himself, became a dependant on the Company, and\r\nthereby subjected to the will of an arbitrary government, is made by him\r\nthe instrument of his own degradation, the instrument of his (the\r\nGovernor's) falsehoods, the instrument of his peculations; and that he\r\nhad been subjected to all this degradation for the purposes of the most\r\nodious tyranny, violence, and corruption.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, having assumed the government to himself, soon made Oude a\r\nprivate domain. It had, to be sure, a public name, but it was to all\r\npractical intents and purposes his park, or his warren,--a place, as it\r\nwere, for game, whence he drew out or killed, at an earlier or later\r\nseason, as he thought fit, anything he liked, and brought it to his\r\ntable according as it served his purpose. Before I proceed, it will not\r\nbe improper for me to remind your Lordships of the legitimate ends to\r\nwhich all controlling and superintending power ought to be directed.\r\nWhether a man acquires this power by law or by usurpation, there are\r\ncertain duties attached to his station. Let us now see what these duties\r\nare.\r\n\r\nThe first is, to take care of that vital principle of every state, its\r\nrevenue. The next is, to preserve the magistracy and legal authorities\r\nin honor, respect, and force. And the third, to preserve the property,\r\nmovable and immovable, of all the people committed to his charge.\r\n\r\nIn regard to his first duty, the protection of the revenue, your\r\nLordships will find, that, from three millions and upwards which I\r\nstated to be the revenue of Oude, and which Mr. Hastings, I believe, or\r\nanybody for him, has never thought proper to deny, it sunk under his\r\nmanagement to about one million four hundred and forty thousand pounds:\r\nand even this, Mr. Middleton says, (as you may see in your minutes,) was\r\nnot completely realized. Thus, my Lords, you see that one half of the\r\nwhole revenue of the country was lost after it came into Mr. Hastings's\r\nmanagement. Well, but it may perhaps be said this was owing to the\r\nNabob's own imprudence. No such thing, my Lords; it could not be so; for\r\nthe whole _real_ administration and government of the country was in the\r\nhands of Mr. Hastings's agents, public or private.\r\n\r\nTo let you see how provident Mr. Hastings's management of it was, I\r\nshall produce to your Lordships one of the principal manoeuvres that he\r\nadopted for the improvement of the revenue, and for the happiness and\r\nprosperity of the country, the latter of which will always go along,\r\nmore or less, with the first.\r\n\r\nThe Nabob, whose acts your Lordships have now learned to appreciate as\r\nno other than the acts of Mr. Hastings, writes to the Council to have a\r\nbody of British officers, for the purposes of improving the discipline\r\nof his troops, collecting his revenues, and repressing disorder and\r\noutrage among his subjects. This proposal was ostensibly fair and\r\nproper; and if I had been in the Council at that time, and the Nabob had\r\nreally and _bonâ fide_ made such a request, I should have said he had\r\ntaken a very reasonable and judicious step, and that the Company ought\r\nto aid him in his design.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers sent to Oude, in consequence of this requisition, was\r\nthe well-known Colonel Hannay: a man whose name will be bitterly and\r\nlong remembered in India. This person, we understand, had been\r\nrecommended to Mr. Hastings by Sir Elijah Impey: and his appointment was\r\nthe natural consequence of such patronage. I say the natural\r\nconsequence, because Sir Elijah Impey appears on your minutes to have\r\nbeen Mr. Hastings's private agent and negotiator in Oude. In that light,\r\nand in that light only, I consider Colonel Hannay in this business. We\r\ncannot prove that he was not of Mr. Hastings's own nomination originally\r\nand primarily; but whether we take him in this way, or as recommended by\r\nSir Elijah Impey, or anybody else, Mr. Hastings is equally responsible.\r\n\r\nColonel Hannay is sent up by Mr. Hastings, and has the command of a\r\nbrigade, of two regiments I think, given to him. Thus far all is\r\napparently fair and easily understood. But in this country we find\r\neverything in masquerade and disguise. We find this man, instead of\r\nbeing an officer, farmed the revenue of the country, as is proved by\r\nColonel Lumsden and other gentlemen, who were his sub-farmers and his\r\nassistants. Here, my Lords, we have a man who appeared to have been sent\r\nup the country as a commander of troops, agreeably to the Nabob's\r\nrequest, and who, upon our inquiry, we discover to have been\r\nfarmer-general of the country! We discover this with surprise; and I\r\nbelieve, till our inquiries began, it was unknown in Europe. We have,\r\nhowever, proved upon your Lordships' minutes, by an evidence produced by\r\nMr. Hastings himself, that Colonel Hannay was actually farmer-general of\r\nthe countries of Baraitch and Goruckpore. We have proved upon your\r\nminutes that Colonel Hannay was the only person possessed of power in\r\nthe country; that there was no magistrate in it, nor any administration\r\nof the law whatever. We have proved to your Lordships that in his\r\ncharacter of farmer-general he availed himself of the influence derived\r\nfrom commanding a battalion of soldiers. In short, we have proved that\r\nthe whole power, civil, military, municipal, and financial, resided in\r\nhim; and we further refer your Lordships to Mr. Lumsden and Mr. Halhed\r\nfor the authority which he possessed in that country. Your Lordships, I\r\nam sure, will supply with your diligence what is defective in my\r\nstatement; I have therefore taken the liberty of indicating to you where\r\nyou are to find the evidence to which I refer. You will there, my Lords,\r\nfind this Colonel Hannay in a false character: he is ostensibly given to\r\nthe Nabob as a commander of his troops, while in reality he is forced\r\nupon that prince as his farmer-general. He is invested with the whole\r\ncommand of the country, while the sovereign is unable to control him, or\r\nto prevent his extorting from the people whatever he pleases.\r\n\r\nIf we are asked what the terms of his farm were, we cannot discover that\r\nhe farmed the country at any certain sum. We cannot discover that he was\r\nsubjected to any terms, or confined by any limitations. Armed with\r\narbitrary power, and exercising that power under a false title, his\r\nexactions from the poor natives were only limited by his own pleasure.\r\nUnder these circumstances, we are now to ask what there was to prevent\r\nhim from robbing and ruining the people, and what security against his\r\nrobbing the exchequer of the person whose revenue he farmed.\r\n\r\nYou are told by the witnesses in the clearest manner, (and, after what\r\nyou have heard of the state of Oude, you cannot doubt the fact,) that\r\nnobody, not even the Nabob, dared to complain against him,--that he was\r\nconsidered as a man authorized and supported by the power of the British\r\ngovernment; and it is proved in the evidence before you that he vexed\r\nand harassed the country to the utmost extent which we have stated in\r\nour article of charge, and which you would naturally expect from a man\r\nacting under such false names with such real powers. We have proved that\r\nfrom some of the principal zemindars in that country, who held farms let\r\nto them for twenty-seven thousand rupees a year, a rent of sixty\r\nthousand was demanded, and in some cases enforced,--and that upon the\r\nrefusal of one of them to comply with this demand, he was driven out of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will find in the evidence before you that the inhabitants\r\nof the country were not only harassed in their fortunes, but cruelly\r\ntreated in their persons. You have it upon Mr. Halhed's evidence, and it\r\nis not attempted, that I know of, to be contradicted, that the people\r\nwere confined in open cages, exposed to the scorching heat of the sun,\r\nfor pretended or real arrears of rent: it is indifferent which, because\r\nI consider all confinement of the person to support an arbitrary\r\nexaction to be an abomination not to be tolerated. They have endeavored,\r\nindeed, to weaken this evidence by an attempt to prove that a man day\r\nand night in confinement in an open cage suffers no inconvenience. And\r\nhere I must beg your Lordships to observe the extreme unwillingness that\r\nappears in these witnesses. Their testimony is drawn from them drop by\r\ndrop, their answers to our questions are never more than yes or no; but\r\nwhen they are examined by the counsel on the other side, it flows as\r\nfreely as if drawn from a perennial spring: and such a spring we have in\r\nIndian corruption. We have, however, proved that in these cages the\r\nrenters were confined till they could be lodged in the dungeons or mud\r\nforts. We have proved that some of them were obliged to sell their\r\nchildren, that others fled the country, and that these practices were\r\ncarried to such an awful extent that Colonel Hannay was under the\r\nnecessity of issuing orders against the unnatural sale and flight which\r\nhis rapacity had occasioned.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's counsel have attempted to prove that this had been a\r\ncommon practice in that country. And though possibly some person as\r\nwicked as Colonel Hannay might have been there before at some time or\r\nother, no man ever sold his children but under the pressure of some\r\ncruel exaction. Nature calls out against it. The love that God has\r\nimplanted in the heart of parents towards their children is the first\r\ngerm of that second conjunction which He has ordered to subsist between\r\nthem and the rest of mankind. It is the first formation and first bond\r\nof society. It is stronger than all laws; for it is the law of Nature,\r\nwhich is the law of God. Never did a man sell his children who was able\r\nto maintain them. It is, therefore, not only a proof of his exactions,\r\nbut a decisive proof that these exactions were intolerable.\r\n\r\nNext to the love of parents for their children, the strongest instinct,\r\nboth natural and moral, that exists in man, is the love of his country:\r\nan instinct, indeed, which extends even to the brute creation. All\r\ncreatures love their offspring; next to that they love their homes: they\r\nhave a fondness for the place where they have been bred, for the\r\nhabitations they have dwelt in, for the stalls in which they have been\r\nfed, the pastures they have browsed in, and the wilds in which they have\r\nroamed. We all know that the natal soil has a sweetness in it beyond the\r\nharmony of verse. This instinct, I say, that binds all creatures to\r\ntheir country, never becomes inert in us, nor ever suffers us to want a\r\nmemory of it. Those, therefore, who seek to fly their country can only\r\nwish to fly from oppression: and what other proof can you want of this\r\noppression, when, as a witness has told you, Colonel Hannay was obliged\r\nto put bars and guards to confine the inhabitants within the country?\r\n\r\nWe have seen, therefore, Nature violated in its strongest principles. We\r\nhave seen unlimited and arbitrary exaction avowed, on no pretence of any\r\nlaw, rule, or any fixed mode by which these people were to be dealt\r\nwith. All these facts have been proved before your Lordships by costive\r\nand unwilling witnesses. In consequence of these violent and cruel\r\noppressions, a general rebellion breaks out in the country, as was\r\nnaturally to be expected. The inhabitants rise as if by common consent;\r\nevery farmer, every proprietor of land, every man who loved his family\r\nand his country, and had not fled for refuge, rose in rebellion, as they\r\ncall it. My Lords, they did rebel; it was a just rebellion. Insurrection\r\nwas there just and legal, inasmuch as Colonel Hannay, in defiance of the\r\nlaws and rights of the people, exercised a clandestine, illegal\r\nauthority, against which there can be no rebellion in its proper sense.\r\n\r\nAs a rebellion, however, and as a rebellion of the most unprovoked\r\nkind, it was treated by Colonel Hannay; and to one instance of the means\r\ntaken for suppressing it, as proved by evidence before your Lordships, I\r\nwill just beg leave to call your attention. One hundred and fifty of the\r\ninhabitants had been shut up in one of the mud forts I have mentioned.\r\nThe people of the country, in their rage, attacked the fort, and\r\ndemanded the prisoners; they called for their brothers, their fathers,\r\ntheir husbands, who were confined there. It was attacked by the joint\r\nassault of men and women. The man who commanded in the fort immediately\r\ncut off the heads of eighteen of the principal prisoners, and tossed\r\nthem over the battlements to the assailants. There happened to be a\r\nprisoner in the fort, a man loved and respected in his country, and who,\r\nwhether justly or unjustly, was honored and much esteemed by all the\r\npeople. \"Give us our Rajah, Mustapha Khân!\" (that was the name of the\r\nman confined,) cried out the assailants. We asked the witness at your\r\nbar what he was confined for. He did not know; but he said that Colonel\r\nHannay had confined him, and added, that he was sentenced to death. We\r\ndesired to see the _fetwah_, or decree, of the judge who sentenced him.\r\nNo,--no such thing, nor any evidence of its having ever existed, could\r\nbe produced. We desired to know whether he could give any account of the\r\nprocess, any account of the magistrate, any account of the accuser, any\r\naccount of the defence,--in short, whether he could give any account\r\nwhatever of this man's being condemned to death. He could give no\r\naccount of it, but the orders of Colonel Hannay, who seems to have\r\nimprisoned and condemned him by his own arbitrary will. Upon the demand\r\nof Rajah Mustapha by the insurgents being made known to Colonel Hannay,\r\nhe sends an order to the commander of the fort, a man already stained\r\nwith the blood of all the people who were murdered there, that, if he\r\nhad not executed Mustapha Khân, he should execute him immediately. The\r\nman is staggered at the order, and refuses to execute it, as not being\r\ndirectly addressed to him. Colonel Hannay then sends a Captain Williams,\r\nwho has appeared here as an evidence at your bar, and who, together with\r\nCaptain Gordon and Major Macdonald, both witnesses also here, were all\r\nsub-farmers and actors under Colonel Hannay. This Captain Williams, I\r\nsay, goes there, and, without asking one of those questions which I put\r\nto the witness at your bar, and desiring nothing but Colonel Hannay's\r\nword, orders the man to be beheaded; and accordingly he was beheaded,\r\nagreeably to the orders of Colonel Hannay. Upon this, the rebellion\r\nblazed out with tenfold fury, and the people declared they would be\r\nrevenged for the destruction of their zemindar.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now seen this Mustapha Khân imprisoned and sentenced\r\nto death by Colonel Hannay, without judge and without accuser, without\r\nany evidence, without the _fetwah_, or any sentence of the law. This man\r\nis thus put to death by an arbitrary villain, by a more than cruel\r\ntyrant, Colonel Hannay, the substitute of a ten thousand times more\r\ncruel tyrant, Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nIn this situation was the country of Oude, under Colonel Hannay, when he\r\nwas removed from it. The knowledge of his misconduct had before induced\r\nthe miserable Nabob to make an effort to get rid of him; but Mr.\r\nHastings had repressed that effort by a civil reprimand,--telling him,\r\nindeed, at the same time, \"I do not force you to receive him.\" (Indeed,\r\nthe Nabob's situation had in it force enough.) The Nabob, I say, was\r\nforced to receive him; and again he ravages and destroys that devoted\r\ncountry, till the time of which I have been just speaking, when he was\r\ndriven out of it finally by the rebellion, and, as you may imagine,\r\ndeparted like a leech full of blood.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in evidence upon your minutes that this bloated leech went\r\nback to Calcutta; that he was supposed, from a state of debt, (in which\r\nhe was known to have been when he left that city,) to have returned from\r\nOude with the handsome sum of 300,000_l._, of which 80,000_l._ was in\r\ngold mohurs. This is declared to be the universal opinion in India, and\r\nno man has ever contradicted it. Ten persons have given evidence to that\r\neffect; not one has contradicted it, from that hour to this, that I ever\r\nheard of. The man is now no more. Whether his family have the whole of\r\nthe plunder or not,--what partnership there was in this business,--what\r\nshares, what dividends were made, and who got them,--about all this\r\npublic opinion varied, and we can with certainty affirm nothing; but\r\nthere ended the life and exploits of Colonel Hannay, farmer-general,\r\ncivil officer, and military commander of Baraitch and Goruckpore. But\r\nnot so ended Mr. Hastings's proceedings.\r\n\r\nSoon after the return of Colonel Hannay to Calcutta, this miserable\r\nNabob received intelligence, which concurrent public fame supported,\r\nthat Mr. Hastings meant to send him up into the country again, on a\r\nsecond expedition, probably with some such order as this:--\"You have\r\nsucked blood enough for yourself, now try what you can do for your\r\nneighbors.\" The Nabob was not likely to be misinformed. His friend and\r\nagent, Gobind Ram, was at Calcutta, and had constant access to all Mr.\r\nHastings's people. Mr. Hastings himself tells you what instructions\r\nthese vakeels always have to search into and discover all his\r\ntransactions. This Gobind Ram, alarmed with strong apprehensions, and\r\nstruck with horror at the very idea of such an event, apprised his\r\nmaster of his belief that Mr. Hastings meant to send Colonel Hannay\r\nagain into the country. Judge now, my lords, what Colonel Hannay must\r\nhave been, from the declaration which I will now read to you, extorted\r\nfrom that miserable slave, the Nabob, who thus addresses Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"My country and house belong to you; there is no difference. I hope that\r\nyou desire in your heart the good of my concerns. Colonel Hannay is\r\ninclined to request your permission to be employed in the affairs of\r\nthis quarter. If by any means any matter of this country dependent on me\r\nshould be intrusted to the Colonel, I swear by the Holy Prophet, that I\r\nwill not remain here, but will go from hence to you. From your kindness\r\nlet no concern dependent on me be intrusted to the Colonel, and oblige\r\nme by a speedy answer which may set my mind at ease.\"\r\n\r\nWe know very well that the prisoner at your bar denied his having any\r\nintention to send him up. We cannot prove them, but we maintain that\r\nthere were grounds for the strongest suspicions that he entertained such\r\nintentions. He cannot deny the reality of this terror which existed in\r\nthe minds of the Nabob and his people, under the apprehension that he\r\nwas to be sent up, which plainly showed that they at least considered\r\nthere was ground enough for charging him with that intention. What\r\nreason was there to think that he should not be sent a third time, who\r\nhad been sent twice before? Certainly, none; because every circumstance\r\nof Mr. Hastings's proceedings was systematical, and perfectly well known\r\nat Oude.\r\n\r\nBut suppose it to have been a false report; it shows all that the\r\nManagers wish to show, the extreme terror which these creatures and\r\ntools of Mr. Hastings struck into the people of that country. His denial\r\nof any intention of again sending Colonel Hannay does not disprove\r\neither the justness of their suspicions or the existence of the terror\r\nwhich his very name excited.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I shall now call your attention to a part of the evidence\r\nwhich we have produced to prove the terrible effects of Colonel Hannay's\r\noperations. Captain Edwards, an untainted man, who tells you that he had\r\npassed through that country again and again, describes it as bearing all\r\nthe marks of savage desolation. Mr. Holt says it has fallen from its\r\nformer state,--that whole towns and villages were no longer peopled, and\r\nthat the country carried evident marks of famine. One would have thought\r\nthat Colonel Hannay's cruelty and depredations would have satiated Mr.\r\nHastings. No: he finds another military collector, a Major Osborne, who,\r\nhaving suffered in his preferment by the sentence of a court-martial,\r\nwhether justly or unjustly I neither know nor care, was appointed to the\r\ncommand of a thousand men in the provinces of Oude, but really to the\r\nadministration of the revenues of the country. He administered them much\r\nin the same manner as Colonel Hannay had done. He, however, transmitted\r\nto the government at Calcutta a partial representation of the state of\r\nthe provinces, the substance of which was, that the natives were exposed\r\nto every kind of peculation, and that the country was in a horrible\r\nstate of confusion and disorder. This is upon the Company's records; and\r\nalthough not produced in evidence, your Lordships may find it, for it\r\nhas been printed over and over again. This man went up to the Vizier; in\r\nconsequence of whose complaint, and the renewed cries of the people, Mr.\r\nHastings was soon obliged to recall him.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, let us go from Major Osborne to the rest of these\r\nmilitary purveyors of revenue. Your Lordships shall hear the Vizier's\r\nown account of what he suffered from British officers, and into what a\r\nstate Mr. Hastings brought that country by the agency of officers who,\r\nunder the pretence of defending it, were invested with powers which\r\nenabled them to commit most horrible abuses in the administration of the\r\nrevenue, the collection of customs, and the monopoly of the markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Copy of a Letter from the Nabob Vizier to the Governor-General._\r\n\r\n    \"All the officers stationed with the brigade at Cawnpore, Futtyghur,\r\n    Darunghur, and Furruckabad, and other places, write purwannahs, and\r\n    give positive orders to the aumils of these places, respecting the\r\n    grain, &c.; from which conduct the country will become depopulate. I\r\n    am hopeful from your friendship that you will write to all these\r\n    gentlemen not to issue orders, &c., to the aumils, and not to send\r\n    troops into the mahals of the sircar; and for whatever quantity of\r\n    grain, &c., they may want, they will inform me and the Resident, and\r\n    we will write it to the aumils, who shall cause it to be sent them\r\n    every month, and I will deduct the price of them from the tuncaws:\r\n    this will be agreeable both to me and to the ryots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A Copy of a subsequent Letter from the Vizier to Rajah Gobind Ram_.\r\n\r\n    \"I some time ago wrote you the particulars of the conduct of the\r\n    officers, and now write them again. The officers and gentlemen who\r\n    are at Cawnpore, and Futtyghur, and Darunghur, and other places, by\r\n    different means act very tyrannically and oppressively towards the\r\n    aumils and ryots and inhabitants; and to whomsoever that requires a\r\n    dustuck they give it, with their own seal affixed, and send for the\r\n    aumils and punish them. If they say anything, the gentlemen make use\r\n    of but two words: one,--_That is for the brigade;_ and the\r\n    second,--_That is to administer justice_. The particulars of it is\r\n    this,--that the byparees will bring their grain from all quarters,\r\n    and sell for their livelihood. There is at present no war to\r\n    occasion a necessity for sending for it. If none comes, whatever\r\n    quantity will be necessary every month I will mention to the aumils,\r\n    that they may bring it for sale: but there is no deficiency of\r\n    grain. The gentlemen have established gunges for their own\r\n    advantage, called Colonel Gunge, at Darunghur, Futtyghur, &c. The\r\n    collection of the customs from all quarters they have stopped, and\r\n    collected them at their own gunges. Each gunge is rented out at\r\n    30,000-40,000 rupees, and their collections paid to the gentlemen.\r\n    They have established gunges where there never were any, and where\r\n    they were, those they have abolished; 30,000 or 40,000 rupees is the\r\n    sum they are rented at; the collections, to the amount of a lac of\r\n    rupees, are stopped. Major Briscoe, who is at Darunghur, has\r\n    established a gunge which rented out for 45,000 rupees, and has\r\n    stopped the ghauts round about the byparees; and merchants coming\r\n    from Cashmere, from Shahjehanabad, and bringing shawls and other\r\n    goods and spices, &c., from all quarters, he orders to his gunge,\r\n    and collects the duty from the aumils, gives them a chit, and a\r\n    guard, who conducts them about five hundred coss: the former duties\r\n    are not collected. From the conduct at Cawnpore, Futtyghur,\r\n    Furruckabad, &c., the duties from the lilla of Gora and Thlawa are\r\n    destroyed, and occasion a loss of three lacs of rupees to the\r\n    duties; and the losses that are sustained in Furruckabad may be\r\n    ascertained by the Nabob Muzuffer Jung, to whom every day complaints\r\n    are made: exclusive of the aumils and collectors, others lodge\r\n    complaints. Whatever I do, I desire no benefit from it; I am\r\n    remediless and silent; from what happens to me, I know that worse\r\n    will happen in other places; the second word, I know, is from their\r\n    mouths only. This is the case. In this country formerly, and even\r\n    now, whatever is to be received or paid among the zemindars, ryots,\r\n    and inhabitants of the cities, and poor people, neither those who\r\n    can pay or those who cannot pay ever make any excuse to the shroffs;\r\n    but when they could pay, they did. In old debts of fifty years,\r\n    whoever complain to the gentlemen, they agree that they shall pay\r\n    one fourth, and send dustucks and sepoys to all the aumils, the\r\n    chowdries, and canongoes, and inhabitants of all the towns; they\r\n    send for everybody, to do them justice, confine them, and say they\r\n    will settle the business. So many and numerous are these calamities,\r\n    that I know not how much room it will take up to mention them. Mr.\r\n    Briscoe is at Darunghur; and the complaints of the aumils arrive\r\n    daily. I am silent. Now Mr. Middleton is coming here, let the Nabob\r\n    appoint him for settling all these affairs, that whatever he shall\r\n    order those gentlemen they will do. From this everything will be\r\n    settled, and the particulars of this quarter will be made known to\r\n    the Nabob. I have written this, which you will deliver to the\r\n    Governor, that everything may be settled; and when he has understood\r\n    it, whatever is his inclination, he will favor me with it. The Nabob\r\n    is master in this country, and is my friend; there is no\r\n    distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Copy of another Letter, entered upon the Consultation of the 4th of\r\n    June, 1781._\r\n\r\n    \"I have received your letter, requesting leave for a battalion to be\r\n    raised by Captain Clark on the same footing as Major Osborne's was,\r\n    agreeable to the requests and complaints of Ishmael Beg, the aumil\r\n    of Allahabad, &c., and in compliance with the directions of the\r\n    Council. You are well acquainted with the particulars and\r\n    negotiation of Ishmael Beg, and the nature of Mr. Osborne's\r\n    battalion. At the beginning of the year 1186 (1779) the affairs of\r\n    Allahabad were given on a lease of three years to Ishmael Beg,\r\n    together with the purgunnahs Arreel and Parra; and I gave orders for\r\n    troops to be stationed and raised, conformable to his request.\r\n    Ishmael Beg accordingly collected twelve hundred peons, which were\r\n    not allowed to the aumil of that place in the year 1185. The reason\r\n    why I gave permission for the additional expense of twelve hundred\r\n    peons was, that he might be enabled to manage the country with ease,\r\n    and pay the money to government regularly. I besides sent Mr.\r\n    Osborne there to command in the mahals belonging to Allahabad, which\r\n    were in the possession of Rajah Ajeet Sing; and he accordingly took\r\n    charge. Afterwards, in obedience to the orders of the\r\n    Governor-General, Mr. Hastings, Jelladut Jung, he was recalled, and\r\n    the mahals placed, as before, under Rajah Ajeet Sing. I never sent\r\n    Mr. Osborne to settle the concerns of Allahabad, for there was no\r\n    occasion for him; but Mr. Osborne, of himself, committed\r\n    depredations and rapines within Ishmael Beg's jurisdiction. Last\r\n    year, the battalion, which, by permission of General Sir Eyre Coote,\r\n    was sent, received orders to secure and defend Ishmael Beg against\r\n    the encroachments of Mr. Osborne; for the complaints of Ishmael Beg\r\n    against the violences of Mr. Osborne had reached the General and Mr.\r\n    Purling; and the Governor and gentlemen of Council, at my request,\r\n    recalled Mr. Osborne. This year, as before, the collections of\r\n    Arreel and Parra remain under Ishmael Beg. In those places, some of\r\n    the talookdars and zemindars, who had been oppressed and ill-treated\r\n    by Mr. Osborne, had conceived ideas of rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, you have an account of the condition of Darunghur,\r\nFuttyghur, Furruckabad, and of the whole line of our military stations\r\nin the Nabob's dominions. You see the whole was one universal scene of\r\nplunder and rapine. You see all this was known to Mr. Hastings, who\r\nnever inflicted any punishments for all this horrible outrage. You see\r\nthe utmost he has done is merely to recall one man, Major Osborne, who\r\nwas by no means the only person deeply involved in these charges. He\r\nnominated all these people; he has never called any of them to an\r\naccount. Shall I not, then, call him their captain-general? Shall not\r\nyour Lordships call him so? And shall any man in the kingdom call him by\r\nany other name? We see all the executive, all the civil and criminal\r\njustice of the country seized on by him. We see the trade and all the\r\nduties seized upon by his creatures. We see them destroying established\r\nmarkets, and creating others at their pleasure. We see them, in the\r\ncountry of an ally and in a time of peace, producing all the\r\nconsequences of rapine and of war. We see the country ruined and\r\ndepopulated by men who attempt to exculpate themselves by charging their\r\nunhappy victims with rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my Lords, who is it that has brought to light all these\r\noutrages and complaints, the existence of which has never been denied,\r\nand for which no redress was ever obtained, and no punishment ever\r\ninflicted? Why, Mr. Hastings himself has brought them before you; they\r\nare found in papers which he has transmitted. God, who inflicts\r\nblindness upon great criminals, in order that they should meet with the\r\npunishment they deserve, has made him the means of bringing forward this\r\nscene, which we are maliciously said to have falsely and maliciously\r\ndevised. If any one of the ravages [charges?] contained in that long\r\ncatalogue of grievances is false, Warren Hastings is the person who must\r\nanswer for that individual falsehood. If they are generally false, he\r\nis to answer for the false and calumniating accusation; and if they are\r\ntrue, my Lords, he only is answerable, for he appointed those ministers\r\nof outrage, and never called them to account for their misconduct.\r\n\r\nLet me now show your Lordships the character that Mr. Hastings gives of\r\nall the British officers. It is to be found in an extract from the\r\nAppendix to that part of his Benares Narrative in which he comments upon\r\nthe treaty of Chunar. Mark, my Lords, what the man himself says of the\r\nwhole military service.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the great benefit which the Company would have derived\r\nfrom such an augmentation of their military force as these troops\r\nconstituted, ready to act on any emergency, prepared and disciplined\r\nwithout any charge on the Company, as the institution professed, until\r\ntheir actual services should be required, I have observed some evils\r\ngrowing out of the system, which, in my opinion, more than\r\ncounterbalanced those advantages, had they been realized in their\r\nfullest effect. The remote stations of these troops, placing the\r\ncommanding officers beyond the notice and control of the board, afforded\r\ntoo much opportunity and temptation for unwarrantable emoluments, and\r\nexcited the contagion of peculation and rapacity throughout the whole\r\narmy. A most remarkable and incontrovertible proof of the prevalence of\r\nthis spirit has been seen in the court-martial upon Captain Erskine,\r\nwhere the court, composed of officers of rank and respectable\r\ncharacters, unanimously and honorably, most honorably, acquitted him\r\nupon an acknowledged fact which in times of stricter discipline would\r\nhave been deemed a crime deserving the severest punishment.\"\r\n\r\nI will now call your Lordships' attention to another extract from the\r\nsame comment of Mr. Hastings, with respect to the removal of the\r\nCompany's servants, civil and military, from the court and service of\r\nthe Vizier.\r\n\r\n\"I was actuated solely by motives of justice to him and a regard to the\r\nhonor of our national character. In removing those gentlemen I diminish\r\nmy own influence, as well as that of my colleagues, by narrowing the\r\nline of patronage; and I expose myself to obloquy and resentment from\r\nthose who are immediately affected by the arrangement, and the long\r\ntrain of their friends and powerful patrons. But their numbers, their\r\ninfluence, and the enormous amount of their salaries, pensions, and\r\nemoluments, were an intolerable burden on the revenues and authority of\r\nthe Vizier, and exposed us to the envy and resentment of the whole\r\ncountry, by excluding the native servants and adherents of the Vizier\r\nfrom the rewards of their services and attachment.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have here Mr. Hastings's opinion of the whole military\r\nservice. You have here the authority and documents by which he supports\r\nhis opinion. He states that the contagion of peculation had tainted all\r\nthe frontier stations, which contain much the largest part of the\r\nCompany's army. He states that this contagion had tainted the whole\r\narmy, _everywhere:_ so that, according to him, there was, throughout the\r\nIndian army, an universal taint of peculation. My Lords, peculation is\r\nnot a military vice. Insubordination, want of attention to duty, want of\r\norder, want of obedience and regularity, are military vices; but who\r\never before heard of peculation being a military vice? In the case\r\nbefore you, it became so by employing military men as farmers of\r\nrevenue, as masters of markets and of gunges. This departure from the\r\nmilitary character and from military duties introduced that peculation\r\nwhich tainted the army, and desolated the dominions of the Nabob Vizier.\r\n\r\nI declare, when I first read the passage which has been just read to\r\nyour Lordships, in the infancy of this inquiry, it struck me with\r\nastonishment that peculation should _at all_ exist as a military vice;\r\nbut I was still more astonished at finding Warren Hastings charging the\r\n_whole_ British army with being corrupted by this base and depraved\r\nspirit, to a degree which tainted even their judicial character. This,\r\nmy Lords, is a most serious matter. The judicial functions of military\r\nmen are of vast importance in themselves; and, generally speaking, there\r\nis not any tribunal whose members are more honorable in their conduct\r\nand more just in their decisions than those of a court-martial. Perhaps\r\nthere is not a tribunal in this country whose reputation is really more\r\nuntainted than that of a court-martial. It stands as fair, in the\r\nopinion both of the army and of the public, as any tribunal, in a\r\ncountry where _all_ tribunals stand fair. But in India, this unnatural\r\nvice of peculation, which has no more to do with the vices of a military\r\ncharacter than with its virtues, this venomous spirit, has pervaded the\r\nmembers of military tribunals to such an extent, that they acquit,\r\nhonorably acquit, _most_ honorably acquit a man, \"upon an acknowledged\r\nfact which in times of stricter discipline would have been deemed a\r\ncrime deserving the severest punishment.\"\r\n\r\nWho says all this, my Lords? Do I say it? No: it is Warren Hastings who\r\nsays it. He records it. He gives you his vouchers and his evidence, and\r\nhe draws the conclusion. He is the criminal accuser of the British army.\r\nHe who sits in that box accuses the whole British army in India. He has\r\ndeclared them to be so tainted with peculation, from head to foot, as to\r\nhave been induced to commit the most wicked perjuries, for the purpose\r\nof bearing one another out in their abominable peculations. In this\r\nunnatural state of things, and whilst there is not one military man on\r\nthese stations of whom Mr. Hastings does not give this abominably\r\nflagitious character, yet every one of them have joined to give him the\r\nbenefit of their testimony for his honorable intentions and conduct.\r\n\r\nIn this tremendous scene, which he himself exposes, are there no signs\r\nof this captain-generalship which I have alluded to? Are there no signs\r\nof this man's being a captain-general of iniquity, under whom all the\r\nspoilers of India were paid, disciplined, and supported? I not only\r\ncharge him with being guilty of a thousand crimes, but I assert that\r\nthere is not a soldier or a civil servant in India whose culpable acts\r\nare not owing to this man's example, connivance, and protection.\r\nEverything which goes to criminate them goes directly against the\r\nprisoner. He puts them in a condition to plunder; he suffered no native\r\nauthority or government to restrain them; and he never called a man to\r\nan account for these flagitious acts which he has thought proper to\r\nbring before his country in the most solemn manner and upon the most\r\nsolemn occasion.\r\n\r\nI verily believe, in my conscience, his accusation is not true, in the\r\nexcess, in the generality and extravagance in which he charges it. That\r\nit is true in a great measure we cannot deny; and in that measure we, in\r\nour turn, charge him with being the author of all the crimes which he\r\ndenounces; and if there is anything in the charge beyond the truth, it\r\nis he who is to answer for the falsehood.\r\n\r\nI will now refer your Lordships to his opinion of the civil service, as\r\nit is declared and recorded in his remarks upon the removal of the\r\nCompany's civil servants by him from the service of the Vizier.--\"I\r\nwas,\" says he, \"actuated solely by motives of justice to him [the Nabob\r\nof Oude], and a regard to the honor of our national character.\"--Here,\r\nyou see, he declares his opinion that in Oude the civil servants of the\r\nCompany had destroyed the national character, and that therefore they\r\nought to be recalled.--\"By removing these people,\" he adds, \"I diminish\r\nmy patronage.\"--But I ask, How came they there? Why, through this\r\npatronage. He sent them there to suck the blood which the military had\r\nspared. He sent these civil servants to do ten times more mischief than\r\nthe military ravagers could do, because they were invested with greater\r\nauthority.--\"If,\" says he, \"I recall them from thence, I lessen my\r\npatronage.\"--But who, my Lords, authorized him to become a patron? What\r\nlaws of his country justified him in forcing upon the Vizier the civil\r\nservants of the Company? What treaty authorized him to do it? What\r\nsystem of policy, except his own wicked, arbitrary system, authorized\r\nhim to act thus?\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to say, \"I expose myself to obloquy and resentment from\r\nthose who are immediately affected by the arrangement, and the long\r\ntrain of their friends and powerful patrons.\"--My Lords, it is the\r\nconstant burden of his song, that he cannot do his duty, that he is\r\nfettered in everything, that he fears a thousand mischiefs to happen to\r\nhim,--not from his acting with carefulness, economy, frugality, and in\r\nobedience to the laws of his country, but from the very reverse of all\r\nthis. Says he, \"I am afraid I shall forfeit the favor of the powerful\r\npatrons of those servants in England, namely, the Lords and Commons of\r\nEngland, if I do justice to the suffering people of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons there are undoubtedly powerful people who may be\r\nsupposed to be influenced by patronage; but the higher and more powerful\r\npart of the country is more directly represented by your Lordships than\r\nby us, although we have of the first blood of England in the House of\r\nCommons. We do, indeed, represent, by the knights of the shires, the\r\nlanded interest; by our city and borough members we represent the\r\ntrading interest; we represent the whole people of England collectively.\r\nBut neither blood nor power is represented so fully in the House of\r\nCommons as that order which composes the great body of the people,--the\r\nprotection of which is our peculiar duty, and to which it is our glory\r\nto adhere. But the dignities of the country, the great and powerful, are\r\nrepresented eminently by your Lordships. As we, therefore, would keep\r\nthe lowest of the people from the contagion and dishonor of peculation\r\nand corruption, and above all from exercising that vice which, among\r\ncommoners, is unnatural as well as abominable, the vice of tyranny and\r\noppression, so we trust that your Lordships will clear yourselves and\r\nthe higher and more powerful ranks from giving the smallest countenance\r\nto the system which we have done our duty in denouncing and bringing\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have heard the account of the civil service. Think of\r\ntheir numbers, think of their influence, and the enormous amount of\r\ntheir salaries, pensions, and emoluments! They were, you have heard, an\r\nintolerable burden on the revenues and authority of the Vizier; and they\r\nexposed us to the envy and resentment of the whole country, by excluding\r\nthe native servants and adherents of the prince from the just reward of\r\ntheir services and attachments. Here, my Lords, is the whole civil\r\nservice brought before you. They usurp the country, they destroy the\r\nrevenues, they overload the prince, and they exclude all the nobility\r\nand eminent persons of the country from the just reward of their\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nDid Mr. Francis, whom I saw here a little while ago, send these people\r\ninto that country? Did General Clavering, or Colonel Monson, whom he\r\ncharges with this system, send them there? No, they were sent by\r\nhimself; and if one was sent by anybody else for a time, he was soon\r\nrecalled: so that he is himself answerable for all the peculation which\r\nhe attributes to the civil service. You see the character given of that\r\nservice; you there see their accuser, you there see their defender, who,\r\nafter having defamed both services, military and civil, never punished\r\nthe guilty in either, and now receives the prodigal praises of both.\r\n\r\nI defy the ingenuity of man to show that Mr. Hastings is not the defamer\r\nof the service. I defy the ingenuity of man to show that the honor of\r\nGreat Britain has not been tarnished under his patronage. He engaged to\r\nremove all these bloodsuckers by the treaty of Chunar; but he never\r\nexecuted that treaty. He proposed to take away the temporary brigade;\r\nbut he again established it. He redressed no grievance; he formed no\r\nimprovements in the government; he never attempted to provide a remedy\r\nwithout increasing the evil tenfold. He was the primary and sole cause\r\nof all the grievances, civil and military, to which the unhappy natives\r\nof that country were exposed; and he was the accuser of all the\r\nimmediate authors of those grievances, without having punished any one\r\nof them. He is the accuser of them all. But the only person whom he\r\nattempted to punish was that man who dared to assert the authority of\r\nthe Court of Directors, and to claim an office assigned to him by them.\r\n\r\nI will now read to your Lordships the protest of General Clavering\r\nagainst the military brigade.--\"Taking the army from the Nabob is an\r\ninfringement of the rights of an independent prince, leaving only the\r\nname and title of it without the power. It is taking his subjects from\r\nhim, against every law of Nature and of nations.\"\r\n\r\nI will next read to your Lordships a minute of Mr. Francis's.--\"By the\r\nforegoing letter from Mr. Middleton it appears that he has taken the\r\ngovernment of the Nabob's dominions directly upon himself. I was not a\r\nparty to the resolutions which preceded that measure, and will not be\r\nanswerable for the consequences of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next paper I will read is one introduced by the Managers, to prove\r\nthat a representation was made by the Nabob respecting the expenses of\r\nthe gentlemen resident at his court, and written after the removal\r\nbefore mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Extract of a Letter from the Vizier to Mr. Macpherson, received\r\n    the 21st April, 1785._\r\n\r\n    \"With respect to the expenses of the gentlemen who are here, I have\r\n    before written in a covered manner; I now write plainly, that I have\r\n    no ability to give money to the gentlemen, because I am indebted\r\n    many lacs of rupees to the bankers for the payment of the Company's\r\n    debt. At the time of Mr. Hastings's departure, I represented to him\r\n    that I had no resources for the expenses of the gentlemen. Mr.\r\n    Hastings, having ascertained my distressed situation, told me that\r\n    after his arrival in Calcutta he would consult with the Council, and\r\n    remove from hence the expenses of the gentlemen, and recall every\r\n    person except the gentlemen in office here. At this time that all\r\n    the concerns are dependent upon you, and you have in every point\r\n    given ease to my mind, according to Mr. Hastings's agreement, I hope\r\n    that the expenses of the gentlemen maybe removed from me, and that\r\n    you may recall every person residing here beyond the gentlemen in\r\n    office. Although Major Palmer does not at this time demand anything\r\n    for the gentlemen, and I have no ability to give them anything, yet\r\n    the custom of the English gentlemen is, when they remain here, they\r\n    will in the end ask for something. This is best, that they should be\r\n    recalled.\"\r\n\r\nI think so, too; and your Lordships will think so with me; but Mr.\r\nHastings, who says that he himself thought thus in September, 1781, and\r\nengaged to recall these gentlemen, was so afraid of their powerful\r\nfriends and patrons here, that he left India, and left all that load of\r\nobloquy upon his successors. He left a Major Palmer there, in the place\r\nof a Resident: a Resident of his own, as your Lordships must see; for\r\nMajor Palmer was no Resident of the Company's. This man received a\r\nsalary of about 23,000_l._ a year, which he declared to be less than his\r\nexpenses; by which we may easily judge of the enormous salaries of those\r\nwho make their fortunes there. He was left by Mr. Hastings as his\r\nrepresentative of peculation, his representative of tyranny. He was the\r\nsecond agent appointed to control all power ostensible and unostensible,\r\nand to head these gentlemen whose \"custom,\" the Nabob says, \"was in the\r\nend to ask for money.\" Money they must have; and there, my Lords, is the\r\nwhole secret.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have this day shown your Lordships the entire dependence of Oude on\r\nthe British empire. I have shown you how Mr. Hastings usurped all power,\r\nreduced the prince to a cipher, and made of his minister a mere creature\r\nof his own,--how he made the servants of the Company dependent on his\r\nown arbitrary will, and considered independence a proof of corruption.\r\nIt has been likewise proved to your Lordships that he suffered the army\r\nto become an instrument of robbery and oppression, and one of its\r\nofficers to be metamorphosed into a farmer-general to waste the country\r\nand embezzle its revenues. You have seen a clandestine and fraudulent\r\nsystem, occasioning violence and rapine; and you have seen the prisoner\r\nat the bar acknowledging and denouncing an abandoned spirit of rapacity\r\nwithout bringing its ministers to justice, and pleading as his excuse\r\nthe fear of offending your Lordships and the House of Commons. We have\r\nshown you the government, revenue, commerce, and agriculture of Oude\r\nruined and destroyed by Mr. Hastings and his creatures. And to wind up\r\nall, we have shown you an army so corrupted as to pervert the\r\nfundamental principles of justice, which are the elements and basis of\r\nmilitary discipline. All this, I say, we have shown you; and I cannot\r\nbelieve that your Lordships will consider that we have trifled with your\r\ntime, or strained our comments one jot beyond the strict measure of the\r\ntext. We have shown you a horrible scene, arising from an astonishing\r\ncombination of horrible circumstances. The order in which you will\r\nconsider these circumstances must be left to your Lordships.\r\n\r\nAt present I am not able to proceed further. My next attempt will be to\r\nbring before you the manner in which Mr. Hastings treated movable and\r\nimmovable property in Oude, and by which he has left nothing undestroyed\r\nin that devoted country.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
