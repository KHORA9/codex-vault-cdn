A TRANSITION PERIOD\r\n\r\nPoliticians at Washington very generally failed to realize that the\r\nadvent of President Hayes marked the dismissal of the issues of war and\r\nreconstruction. They regarded as an episode what turned out to be the\r\nclose of an era. They saw, indeed, that public interest in the old\r\nissues had waned, but they were confident that this lack of interest was\r\ntransient. They admitted that the emotional fervor excited by the war\r\nand by the issues of human right involved in its results was somewhat\r\ndamped, but they believed that the settlement of those issues was still\r\nso incomplete that public interest would surely rekindle. For many years\r\nthe ruling thought of the Republican party leaders was to be watchful\r\nof any opportunity to ply the bellows on the embers. Besides genuine\r\nconcern over the way in which the negroes had been divested of political\r\nprivileges conferred by national legislation, the Republicans felt a\r\ntingling sense of party injury.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent party leaders at this time--both standing high as\r\npresidential possibilities--were James G. Blaine and John Sherman. In\r\na magazine article published in 1880 Mr. Blaine wrote: \"As the matter\r\nstands, all violence in the South inures to the benefit of one political\r\nparty.... Our institutions have been tried by the fiery test of war, and\r\nhave survived. It remains to be seen whether the attempt to govern the\r\ncountry by the power of a 'solid South,' unlawfully consolidated, can be\r\nsuccessful.... The republic must be strong enough, and shall be strong\r\nenough, to protect the weakest of its citizens in all their rights.\" And\r\nso late as 1884, Mr. Sherman earnestly contended for the principle of\r\nnational intervention in the conduct of state elections. \"The war,\" he\r\nsaid, \"emancipated and made citizens of five million people who had been\r\nslaves. This was a national act and whether wisely or imprudently done\r\nit must be respected by the people of all the States. If sought to be\r\nreversed in any degree by the people of any locality it is the duty\r\nof the national government to make their act respected by all its\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nRepublican party platforms reiterated such opinions long after their\r\npractical futility had become manifest. Indeed, it was a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that negro suffrage had been undone by force and fraud;\r\nhardly more than a perfunctory denial of the fact was ever made in\r\nCongress, and meanwhile it was a source of jest and anecdote among\r\nmembers of all parties behind the scenes. Republican members were\r\nbantered by Democratic colleagues upon the way in which provision\r\nfor Republican party advantage in the South had actually given to the\r\nDemocratic party a solid block of sure electoral votes. The time at\r\nlast came when a Southern Senator, Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina,\r\nblurted out in the open what had for years been common talk in private.\r\n\"We took the government away,\" he asserted. \"We stuffed ballot boxes. We\r\nshot them. We are not ashamed of it.... With that system--force, tissue\r\nballots, etc.--we got tired ourselves. So we called a constitutional\r\nconvention, and we eliminated, as I said, all of the colored people we\r\ncould under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.... The brotherhood\r\nof man exists no longer, because you shoot negroes in Illinois, when\r\nthey come in competition with your labor, and we shoot them in South\r\nCarolina, when they come in competition with us in the matter of\r\nelections.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a miscarriage of Republican policy was long a bitter grievance to\r\nthe leaders of the party and incited them to action. If they could have\r\nhad their desire, they would have used stringent means to remedy the\r\nsituation. Measures to enforce the political rights of the freedmen were\r\nfrequently agitated, but every force bill which was presented had to\r\nencounter a deep and pervasive opposition not confined by party lines\r\nbut manifested even within the Republican party itself. Party platforms\r\ninsisted upon the issue, but public opinion steadily disregarded it.\r\nApparently a fine opportunity to redress this grievance was afforded\r\nby the election of President Harrison in 1888 upon a platform declaring\r\nthat the national power of the Democratic party was due to \"the\r\nsuppression of the ballot by a criminal nullification of the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States,\" and demanding \"effective\r\nlegislation to secure integrity and purity of elections.\" But, although\r\nthey were victorious at the polls that year, the Republican leaders were\r\nunable to embody in legislation the ideal proposed in their platform. Of\r\nthe causes of this failure, George F. Hoar gives an instructive\r\naccount in his \"Autobiography.\" As chairman of the Senate committee on\r\nprivileges and elections he was in a position to know all the details of\r\nthe legislative attempts, the failure of which compelled the Republican\r\nleaders to acquiesce in the decision of public opinion against the old\r\nissues and in favor of new issues.\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar relates that he made careful preparation of a bill for\r\nholding, under national authority, separate registrations and elections\r\nfor members of Congress. But when he consulted his party associates in\r\nthe Senate he found most of them averse to an arrangement which would\r\ndouble the cost of elections and would require citizens to register\r\nat different times for federal elections and for state and municipal\r\nelections. Senator Hoar thereupon abandoned that bill and prepared\r\nanother which provided that, upon application to court showing\r\nreasonable grounds, the court should appoint officers from both parties\r\nto supervise the election. The bill adopted a feature of electoral\r\nprocedure which in England has had a salutary effect. It was provided\r\nthat in case of a dispute concerning an election certificate, the\r\ncircuit court of the United States in which the district was situated\r\nshould hear the case and should award a certificate entitling the one or\r\nother of the contestants to be placed on the clerk's roll and to serve\r\nuntil the House should act on the case. Mr. Hoar stated that the bill\r\n\"deeply excited the whole country,\" and went on to say that \"some worthy\r\nRepublican senators became alarmed. They thought, with a good deal of\r\nreason, that it was better to allow existing evils and conditions to\r\nbe cured by time, and the returning conscience and good sense of the\r\npeople, rather than have the strife, the result of which must be quite\r\ndoubtful, which the enactment and enforcement of this law, however\r\nmoderate and just, would inevitably create.\" The existence of this\r\nattitude of mind made party advocacy of the bill a hopeless undertaking\r\nand, though it was favorably reported on August 7, 1890, no further\r\naction was taken during that session. At the December session it was\r\ntaken up for consideration, but after a few days of debate a motion to\r\nlay it aside was carried by the Democrats with the assistance of enough\r\nRepublicans to give them a majority. This was the end of force bills,\r\nand during President Cleveland's second term the few remaining statutes\r\ngiving authority for federal interference in such matters was repealed\r\nunder the lead of Senator Hill of New York. With the passage of this\r\nact, the Republican party leaders for the first time abandoned all\r\npurpose of attempting to secure by national legislation the political\r\nprivileges of the negroes. This determination was announced in the\r\nSenate by Mr. Hoar and was assented to by Senator Chandler of New\r\nHampshire, who had been a zealous champion of federal action. According\r\nto Mr. Hoar, \"no Republican has dissented from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts upon which the force bill was based were so notorious and\r\nthe bill itself was so moderate in its character that the general\r\nindifference of the public seemed to betray moral insensibility and\r\nemotional torpor. Much could be said in favor of the bill. This latest\r\nassertion of national authority in federal elections involved no new\r\nprinciple. In legalistic complexion the proposed measure was of the same\r\ncharacter as previous legislation dealing with this subject, instances\r\nof which are the Act of 1842, requiring the election of members of the\r\nHouse by districts, and the Act of 1866, regulating the election of\r\nUnited States Senators. Fraudulent returns in congressional elections\r\nhave always been a notorious evil, and the partisan way in which they\r\nare passed upon is still a gross blemish upon the constitutional system\r\nof the United States, and one which is likely never to be removed until\r\nthe principle of judicial determination of electoral contests has been\r\nadopted in this country as it has been in England. The truth of the\r\nmatter appears to be that the public paid no attention to the merits\r\nof the bill. It was viewed simply as a continuation of the radical\r\nreconstruction policy, the practical results of which had become\r\nintolerable. However great the actual evils of the situation might be,\r\npublic opinion held that it would be wiser to leave them to be dealt\r\nwith by state authority than by such incompetent statesmanship as had\r\nbeen common in Washington. Moreover, the man in the street resented the\r\nindifference of politicians to all issues save those derived from the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nViscount Bryce in his \"American Commonwealth,\" the most complete and\r\npenetrating examination of American political conditions written during\r\nthis period, gives this account of the party situation:\r\n\r\n\"The great parties are the Republicans and the Democrats. What are their\r\nprinciples, their distinctive tenets, their tendencies? Which of them is\r\nfor tariff reform, for the further extension of civil service reform, a\r\nspirited foreign policy, for the regulation of railroads and telegraphs\r\nby legislation, for changes in the currency, for any other of the twenty\r\nissues which one hears discussed in this country as seriously involving\r\nits welfare? This is what a European is always asking of intelligent\r\nRepublicans and intelligent Democrats. He is always asking because he\r\nnever gets an answer. The replies leave him deeper in perplexity. After\r\nsome months the truth begins to dawn upon him. Neither party has, as a\r\nparty, anything definite to say on these issues; neither party has any\r\nclean-cut principles, any distinctive tenets. Both have traditions. Both\r\nclaim to have tendencies. Both certainly have war cries, organizations,\r\ninterests, enlisted in their support. But those interests are in\r\nthe main the interests of getting or keeping the patronage of the\r\ngovernment. Tenets and policies, points of political doctrine and points\r\nof political practice have all but vanished. They have not been thrown\r\naway, but have been stripped away by time and the progress of events,\r\nfulfilling some policies, blotting out others. All has been lost, except\r\noffice or the hope of it.\"\r\n\r\nThat such a situation could actually exist in the face of public\r\ndisapproval is a demonstration of the defects of Congress as an organ of\r\nnational representation. Normally, a representative assembly is a school\r\nof statesmanship which is drawn upon for filling the great posts of\r\nadministration. Not only is this the case under the parliamentary system\r\nin vogue in England, but it is equally the case in Switzerland whose\r\nconstitution agrees with that of the United States in forbidding members\r\nof Congress to hold executive office. But somehow the American Congress\r\nfails to produce capable statesmen. It attracts politicians who display\r\naffability, shrewdness, dexterity, and eloquence, but who are lacking in\r\ndiscernment of public needs and in ability to provide for them, so\r\nthat power and opportunity are often associated with gross political\r\nincompetency.* The solutions of the great political problems of the\r\nUnited States are accomplished by transferring to Washington men like\r\nHayes and Cleveland whose political experience has been gained in other\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  Of this regrettable fact the whole history of emancipation is a\r\nmonument. The contrast between the social consequences of emancipation\r\nin the West Indies, as guided by British statesmanship, under conditions\r\nof meager industrial opportunity, and the social consequences of\r\nemancipation in the United States, affords an instructive example of\r\nthe complicated evils which a nation may experience through the sheer\r\nincapacity of its government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of congressional government was subjected to some scrutiny in\r\n1880-81 through the efforts of Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio, an\r\nold statesman who had returned to public life after long absence. He had\r\nbeen prominent in the Democratic party before the war and in 1864 he\r\nwas the party candidate for Vice-President. In 1868 he was the leading\r\ncandidate for the presidential nomination on a number of ballots, but\r\nhe was defeated. In 1869 he was a candidate for Governor of Ohio but\r\nwas defeated; he then retired from public life until 1879 when he\r\nwas elected to the United States Senate. As a member of that body, he\r\ndevoted himself to the betterment of political conditions. His efforts\r\nin this direction were facilitated not only by his wide political\r\nexperience but also by the tact and urbanity of his manners, which had\r\ngained for him in Ohio politics the nickname of \"Gentleman George.\"\r\n\r\nIn agreement with opinions long previously expressed in Story's\r\n\"Commentaries,\" Senator Pendleton attributed the inefficiency of\r\nnational government to the sharp separation of Congress from the\r\nAdministration--a separation not required by the Constitution but made\r\nby Congress itself and subject to change at its discretion. He proposed\r\nto admit the heads of executive departments to participation in the\r\nproceedings of Congress. \"This system,\" said he, \"will require the\r\nselection of the strongest men to be heads of departments, and will\r\nrequire them to be well equipped with the knowledge of their offices.\r\nIt will also require the strongest men to be the leaders of Congress and\r\nparticipate in the debate. It will bring those strong men in contact,\r\nperhaps into conflict, to advance the public weal and thus stimulate\r\ntheir abilities and their efforts, and will thus assuredly result to\r\nthe good of the country.\"* The report--signed by such party leaders as\r\nAllison, Blaine, and Ingalls among the Republicans, and by Pendleton and\r\nVoorhees among the Democrats--reviewed the history of relations between\r\nthe executive and legislative branches and closed with the expression of\r\nthe unanimous belief of the committee that the adoption of the measure\r\n\"will be the first step towards a sound civil service reform, which will\r\nsecure a larger wisdom in the adoption of policies, and a better system\r\nin their execution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  \"Senate Report,\" No. 837, 46th Congress, 3d session, February\r\n4, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo action was taken on this proposal, notwithstanding the favor\r\nwith which it was regarded by many close students of the political\r\ninstitutions of the country. Public opinion, preoccupied with more\r\nspecific issues, seemed indifferent to a reform that aimed simply at\r\ngeneral improvement in governmental machinery. The legislative calendars\r\nare always so heaped with projects that to reach and act upon any\r\nparticular measure is impossible, except when there is brought to bear\r\nsuch energetic pressure as to produce special arrangements for the\r\npurpose, and in this case no such pressure was developed. A companion\r\nmeasure for civil service reform which was proposed by Senator Pendleton\r\nlong remained in a worse situation, for it was not merely left under the\r\ncongressional midden heap but was deliberately buried by politicians who\r\nwere determined that it should never emerge. That it did emerge is due\r\nto a tragedy which aroused public opinion to an extent that intimidated\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWant of genuine political principles made factional spirit only the more\r\nviolent and depraved. So long as power and opportunity were based\r\nnot upon public confidence but upon mere advantage of position, the\r\ncontention of party leaders turned upon questions of appointment to\r\noffice and the control of party machinery. The Republican national\r\nconvention of 1880 was the scene of a factional struggle which left\r\ndeep marks upon public life and caused divisions lasting until the party\r\nleaders of that period were removed from the scene. In September 1879,\r\nGeneral Grant landed in San Francisco, after a tour around the world\r\noccupying over two years, and as he passed through the country he was\r\nreceived with a warmth which showed that popular devotion was abounding.\r\nA movement in favor of renominating him to the Presidency was started\r\nunder the direction of Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Grant's\r\nrenown as the greatest military leader of the Civil War was not his only\r\nasset in the eyes of his supporters. In his career as President he had\r\nshown, on occasion, independence and steadfastness of character. He\r\nstayed the greenback movement by his veto after eminent party leaders\r\nhad yielded to it. He had endeavored to introduce civil service reform\r\nand, although his measures had been frustrated by the refusal of\r\nCongress to vote the necessary appropriations, his tenacity of purpose\r\nwas such that it could scarcely be doubted that with renewed opportunity\r\nhe would resume his efforts. The scandals which blemished the conduct of\r\npublic affairs during his administration could not be attributed to any\r\nlack of personal honesty on his part. Grant went out of the presidential\r\noffice poorer than when he entered it. Since then, his views had\r\nbeen broadened by travel and by observation, and it was a reasonable\r\nsupposition that he was now better qualified than ever before for the\r\nduties of the presidential office. He was only fifty-eight, an age much\r\nbelow that at which an active career should be expected to close, and\r\ncertainly an age at which European statesmen are commonly thought to\r\npossess unabated powers. In opposition to him was a tradition peculiar\r\nto American politics, though unsupported by any provision of the\r\nConstitution according to which no one should be elected President for\r\nmore than two terms. It may be questioned whether this tradition does\r\nnot owe its strength more to the ambition of politicians than to sincere\r\nconviction on the part of the people.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The reasoning of \"The Federalist,\" in favor of continued\r\nreeligibility, is cogent in itself and is supported by the experience\r\nof other countries, for it shows that custody of power may remain in the\r\nsame hands for long periods without detriment and without occasioning\r\nany difficulty in terminating that custody when public confidence is\r\nwithdrawn. American sensitiveness on this point would seem to impute\r\nto the Constitution a frailty that gives it a low rating among forms of\r\ngovernment. As better means are provided for enforcing administrative\r\nresponsibility, the popular dislike of third terms will doubtless\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo strong was the movement in favor of General Grant as President that\r\nthe united strength of the other candidates had difficulty in staying\r\nthe boom, which, indeed, might have been successful but for the arrogant\r\nmethods and tactical blunders of Senator Conkling. When three of the\r\ndelegates voted against a resolution binding all to support the nominee\r\nwhoever that nominee might be, he offered a resolution that those who\r\nhad voted in the negative \"do not deserve and have forfeited their vote\r\nin this convention.\" The feeling excited by this condemnatory motion\r\nwas so strong that Conkling was obliged to withdraw it. He also made a\r\ncontest in behalf of the unit rule but was defeated, as the convention\r\ndecided that every delegate should have the right to have his vote\r\ncounted as he individually desired. Notwithstanding these defeats of\r\nthe chief manager of the movement in his favor, Grant was the leading\r\ncandidate with 304 votes on the first ballot, James G. Blaine standing\r\nsecond with 284. This was the highest point in the balloting reached\r\nby Blaine, while the Grant vote made slight gains. Besides Grant and\r\nBlaine, four other candidates were in the field, and the convention\r\ndrifted into a deadlock which under ordinary circumstances would have\r\nprobably been dissolved by shifts of support to Grant. But in the\r\npreliminary disputes a very favorable impression had been made upon the\r\nconvention by General Garfield, who was not himself a candidate but was\r\nsupporting the candidacy of John Sherman, who stood third in the poll.\r\nOn the twenty-eighth ballot, two votes were cast for Garfield; although\r\nhe protested that he was not a candidate and was pledged to Sherman. But\r\nit became apparent that no concentration could be effected on any other\r\ncandidate to prevent the nomination of Grant, and votes now turned to\r\nGarfield so rapidly that on the thirty-sixth ballot he received 399, a\r\nclear majority of the whole. The adherents of Grant stuck to him to the\r\nend, polling 306 votes on the last ballot and subsequently deporting\r\nthemselves as those who had made a proud record of constancy.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic national convention nominated General Hancock, which\r\nwas, in effect, an appeal to the memories and sentiments of the past,\r\nas their candidate's public distinction rested upon his war record. The\r\ncanvass was marked by listlessness and indifference on the part of the\r\ngeneral public, and by a fury of calumny on the part of the politicians\r\ndirected against their opponents. Forgery was resorted to with marked\r\neffect on the Pacific coast, where a letter--the famous Morey letter--in\r\nwhich Garfield's handwriting was counterfeited, was circulated\r\nexpressing unpopular views on the subject of Chinese  immigration. The\r\nforgery was issued in the closing days of the canvass, when there\r\nwas not time to expose it. Arrangements had been made for a wide\r\ndistribution of facsimiles which exerted a strong influence. Hancock won\r\nfive out of the six electoral votes of California and came near getting\r\nthe three votes of Oregon also. In the popular vote of the whole\r\ncountry, Garfield had a plurality of less than ten thousand in a total\r\nvote of over nine million.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the party system which has been developed\r\nin American politics, forces upon the President the occupation of\r\nemployment agent as one of his principal engagements. The contention\r\nover official patronage, always strong and ardent upon the accession of\r\nevery new President, was aggravated in Garfield's case by the factional\r\nwar of which his own nomination was a phase. The factions of the\r\nRepublican party in New York at this period were known as the\r\n\"Stalwarts\" and the \"Half-Breeds,\" the former adhering to the leadership\r\nof Senator Conkling, the latter to the leadership of Mr. Blaine, whom\r\nPresident Garfield had appointed to be his Secretary of State. Soon\r\nafter the inauguration of Garfield it became manifest that he would\r\nfavor the \"Half-Breeds\"; but under the Constitution appointments are\r\nmade by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and both the\r\nSenators from New York were \"Stalwarts.\" Although the Constitution\r\ncontemplates the action of the entire Senate as the advisory body in\r\nmatters of appointment, a practice had been established by which the\r\nSenators from each State were accorded the right to dictate appointments\r\nin their respective States. According to Senator Hoar, when he entered\r\npublic life in 1869, \"the Senate claimed almost the entire control of\r\nthe executive function of appointment to office.... What was called 'the\r\ncourtesy of the Senate' was depended upon to enable a Senator to dictate\r\nto the executive all appointments and removals in his territory.\" This\r\npractice was at its greatest height when President Garfield challenged\r\nthe system, and he let it be understood that he would insist upon his\r\nconstitutional right to make nominations at his own discretion. When\r\nSenator Conkling obtained from a caucus of his Republican colleagues an\r\nexpression of sympathy with his position, the President let it be known\r\nthat he regarded such action as an affront and he withdrew all New York\r\nnominations except those to which exception had been taken by the New\r\nYork Senators, thus confronting the Senate with the issue whether they\r\nwould stand by the new Administration or would follow Conkling's lead.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Senator Conkling and his adherents declared the issue\r\nto be simply whether competent public officials should be removed to\r\nmake room for factional favorites. This view of the case was adopted by\r\nVice-President Arthur and by Postmaster-General James of Garfield's\r\nown Cabinet, who, with New York Senators Conkling and Platt, signed a\r\nremonstrance in which they declared that in their belief the interests\r\nof the public service would not be promoted by the changes proposed.\r\nThese changes were thus described in a letter of May 14, 1881, from the\r\nNew York Senators to Governor Cornell of New York:\r\n\r\n\"Some weeks ago, the President sent to the Senate in a group the\r\nnominations of several persons for public offices already filled. One of\r\nthese offices is the Collectorship of the Port of New York, now held by\r\nGeneral Merritt; another is the consul generalship at London, now held\r\nby General Badeau; another is Charge d'Affaires to Denmark, held by Mr.\r\nCramer; another is the mission to Switzerland, held by Mr. Fish, a son\r\nof the former Secretary of State.... It was proposed to displace them\r\nall, not for any alleged fault of theirs, or for any alleged need or\r\nadvantage of the public service, but in order to give the great offices\r\nof Collector of the Port of New York to Mr. William H. Robertson as\r\na 'reward' for certain acts of his, said to have aided in making the\r\nnomination of General Garfield possible.... We have not attempted to\r\n'dictate,' nor have we asked the nomination of one person to any office\r\nin the State.\"\r\n\r\nExcept in the case of their remonstrance against the Robertson\r\nappointment, they had \"never even expressed an opinion to the President\r\nin any case unless questioned in regard to it.\" Along with this\r\nstatement the New York Senators transmitted their resignations, saying\r\n\"we hold it respectful and becoming to make room for those who may\r\ncorrect all the errors we have made, and interpret aright all the duties\r\nwe have misconceived.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Legislature was then in session. Conkling and Platt offered\r\nthemselves as candidates for reelection, and a protracted factional\r\nstruggle ensued; in the course of which, the nation was shocked by the\r\nnews that President Garfield had been assassinated by a disappointed\r\noffice seeker in a Washington railway station on July 2, 1881. The\r\nPresident died from the effects of the wound on the 19th of September.\r\nMeanwhile, the contest in the New York Legislature continued until\r\nthe 22d of July when the deadlock was broken by the election of Warner\r\nMiller and Elbridge G. Lapham to fill the vacancies.\r\n\r\nThe deep disgust with which the nation regarded this factional war, and\r\nthe horror inspired by the assassination of President Garfield, produced\r\na revulsion of public opinion in favor of civil service reform so\r\nenergetic as to overcome congressional antipathy. Senator Pendleton's\r\nbill to introduce the merit system, which had been pending for nearly\r\ntwo years, was passed by the Senate on December 27, 1882, and by\r\nthe House on January 4, 1883. The importance of the act lay in its\r\nrecognition of the principles of the reform and in its provision of\r\nmeans by which the President could apply those principles. A Civil\r\nService Commission was created, and the President was authorized to\r\nclassify the Civil Service and to provide selection by competitive\r\nexamination for all appointments to the service thus classified. The\r\nlaw was essentially an enabling act, and its practical efficacy was\r\ncontingent upon executive discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. POLITICAL GROPING AND PARTY FLUCTUATION\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield's career was cut short so soon after his accession\r\nto office, that he had no opportunity of showing whether he had the will\r\nand the power to obtain action for the redress of public grievances,\r\nwhich the congressional factions were disposed to ignore. His experience\r\nand his attainments were such as should have qualified him for the\r\ntask, and in his public life he had shown firmness of character. His\r\ncourageous opposition to the greenback movement in Ohio had been of\r\ngreat service to the nation in maintaining the standard of value. When\r\na party convention in his district passed resolutions in favor of\r\npaying interest on the bonds with paper instead of coin, he gave a rare\r\ninstance of political intrepidity by declaring that he would not accept\r\nthe nomination on such a platform. It was the deliberate opinion\r\nof Senator Hoar, who knew Garfield intimately, that \"next to the\r\nassassination of Lincoln, his death was the greatest national misfortune\r\never caused to this country by the loss of a single life.\"\r\n\r\nThe lingering illness of President Garfield raised a serious question\r\nabout presidential authority which is still unsettled. For over two\r\nmonths before he died he was unable to attend to any duties of office.\r\nThe Constitution provides that \"in case of the removal of the President\r\nfrom office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge\r\nthe powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on\r\nthe Vice-President.\" What is the practical significance of the term\r\n\"inability\"? If it should be accepted in its ordinary meaning, a\r\nprostrating illness would be regarded as sufficient reason for allowing\r\nthe Vice-President to assume presidential responsibility. Though there\r\nwas much quiet discussion of the problem, no attempt was made to press\r\na decision. After Garfield died, President Arthur, on succeeding to the\r\noffice, took up the matter in his first annual message, putting a\r\nnumber of queries as to the actual significance of the language of the\r\nConstitution--queries which have yet to be answered. The rights and\r\nduties of the Vice-President in this particular are dangerously vague.\r\nThe situation is complicated by a peculiarity of the electoral system.\r\nIn theory, by electing a President the nation expresses its will\r\nrespecting public policy; but in practice the candidate for President\r\nmay be an exponent of one school of opinion and the candidate for\r\nVice-President may represent another view. It is impossible for a voter\r\nto discriminate between the two; he cannot vote for the candidate for\r\nPresident without voting for the candidate for Vice-President, since he\r\ndoes not vote directly for the candidates themselves but for the party\r\nelectors who are pledged to the entire party ticket. Party conventions\r\ntake advantage of this disability on the part of the voter to work an\r\nelectioneering device known as a \"straddle,\" the aim of which is to\r\nplease opposite interests by giving each a place on the ticket. After\r\nGarfield was nominated, the attempt was made to placate the defeated\r\nfaction by nominating one of its adherents for Vice-President, and now\r\nthat nominee unexpectedly became the President of the United States,\r\nwith power to reverse the policy of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nIn one important matter there was, in fact, an abrupt reversal of\r\npolicy. The independent countries of North and South America had been\r\ninvited to participate in a general congress to be held in Washington,\r\nNovember 24, 1881. James Gillespie Blaine, who was then Secretary\r\nof State, had applied himself with earnestness and vigor to this\r\nundertaking, which might have produced valuable results. It was a\r\nmovement towards closer relations between American countries, a purpose\r\nwhich has since become public policy and has been steadily promoted by\r\nthe Government. With the inauguration of President Arthur, Blaine was\r\nsucceeded by Frederick T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who practically\r\ncanceled the invitation to the proposed Congress some six weeks after it\r\nhad been issued. On February 3, 1889, Blaine protested in an open letter\r\nto the President, and the affair occasioned sharp discussion. In his\r\nregular message to Congress in the following December, the President\r\noffered excuses of an evasive character, pointing out that Congress had\r\nmade no appropriation for expenses and declaring that he had thought it\r\n\"fitting that the Executive should consult the representatives of the\r\npeople before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in its character\r\nand far-reaching in its possible consequences.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, President Arthur behaved with a tact and prudence that\r\nimproved his position in public esteem. It soon became manifest that,\r\nalthough he had been Conkling's adherent, he was not his servitor. He\r\nconducted the routine business of the presidential office with dignity,\r\nand he displayed independence of character in his relations with\r\nCongress. But his powers were so limited by the conditions under which\r\nhe had to act that to a large extent public interests had to drift\r\nalong without direction and management. In some degree, the situation\r\nresembled that which existed in the Holy Roman Empire when a complicated\r\nlegalism kept grinding away and pretentious forms of authority were\r\nmaintained, although, meanwhile, there was actual administrative\r\nimpotence. Striking evidence of the existence of such a situation is\r\nfound in President Arthur's messages to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 6, 1881, the President mentioned the fact\r\nthat in the West \"a band of armed desperadoes known as 'Cowboys,'\r\nprobably numbering fifty to one hundred men, have been engaged for\r\nmonths in committing acts of lawlessness and brutality which the local\r\nauthorities have been unable to repress.\" He observed that \"with every\r\ndisposition to meet the exigencies of the case, I am embarrassed by lack\r\nof authority to deal with them effectually.\" The center of disturbance\r\nwas in Arizona, and the punishment of crime there was ordinarily the\r\nbusiness of the local authorities. But even if they called for aid,\r\nsaid the President, \"this Government would be powerless to render\r\nassistance,\" for the laws had been altered by Congress so that States\r\nbut not Territories could demand the protection of the national\r\nGovernment against \"domestic violence.\" He recommended legislation\r\nextending to the Territories \"the protection which is accorded the\r\nStates by the Constitution.\" On April 26, 1882, the President sent a\r\nspecial message to Congress on conditions in Arizona, announcing that\r\n\"robbery, murder, and resistance to laws have become so common as to\r\ncease causing surprise, and that the people are greatly intimidated\r\nand losing confidence in the protection of the law.\" He also advised\r\nCongress that the \"Cowboys\" were making raids into Mexico, and again\r\nbegged for legal authority to act. On the 3rd of May, he issued a\r\nproclamation calling upon the outlaws \"to disperse and retire peaceably\r\nto their respective abodes.\" In his regular annual message on December\r\n4, 1882, he again called attention \"to the prevalent lawlessness upon\r\nthe borders, and to the necessity of legislation for its suppression.\"\r\n\r\nSuch vast agitation from the operations of a band of ruffians, estimated\r\nat from fifty to one hundred in number, and such floundering incapacity\r\nfor prompt action by public authority seem more like events from a\r\nchronicle of the Middle Ages than from the public records of a modern\r\nnation. Of like tenor, was a famous career which came to an end in this\r\nperiod. Jesse W. James, the son of a Baptist minister in Clay County,\r\nMissouri, for some years carried on a bandit business, specializing\r\nin the robbery of banks and railroad trains, with takings computed\r\nat $263,778. As his friends and admirers were numerous, the elective\r\nsheriffs, prosecuting attorneys, and judges in the area of his\r\nactivities were unable to stop him by any means within their reach.\r\nMeanwhile, the frightened burghers of the small towns in his range of\r\noperations were clamoring for deliverance from his raids, and finally\r\nGovernor Crittenden of Missouri offered a reward of $10,000 for his\r\ncapture dead or alive. Two members of his own band shot him down in his\r\nown house, April 3, 1882. They at once reported the deed and surrendered\r\nthemselves to the police, were soon put on trial, pleaded guilty of\r\nmurder, were sentenced to death, and were at once pardoned by the\r\nGovernor. Meanwhile, the funeral ceremonies over Jesse James's remains\r\ndrew a great concourse of people, and there were many indications of\r\npopular sympathy. Stories of his exploits have had an extensive sale,\r\nand his name has become a center of legend and ballad somewhat after the\r\nfashion of the medieval hero Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nThe legislative blundering which tied the President's hands and made the\r\nGovernment impotent to protect American citizens from desperadoes of\r\nthe type of the \"cowboys\" and Jesse James, is characteristic of Congress\r\nduring this period. Another example of congressional muddling is found\r\nin an act which was passed for the better protection of ocean travel\r\nand which the President felt constrained to veto. In his veto message of\r\nJuly 1, 1882, the President said that he was entirely in accord with\r\nthe purpose of the bill which related to matters urgently demanding\r\nlegislative attention. But the bill was so drawn that in practice it\r\nwould have caused great confusion in the clearing of vessels and would\r\nhave led to an impossible situation. It was not the intention of the\r\nbill to do what the President found its language to require, and the\r\ndefects were due simply to maladroit phrasing, which frequently occurs\r\nin congressional enactments, thereby giving support to the theory of\r\nJohn Stuart Mill that a representative assembly is by its very nature\r\nunfit to prepare legislative measures.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy machinery of legislation kept bungling on, irresponsive to\r\nthe principal needs and interests of the times. An ineffectual start\r\nwas made on two subjects presenting simple issues on which there was\r\nan energetic pressure of popular sentiment--Chinese immigration and\r\npolygamy among the Mormons. Anti-Chinese legislation had to contend with\r\na traditional sentiment in favor of maintaining the United States as an\r\nasylum for all peoples. But the demand from the workers of the Pacific\r\nslope for protection against Asiatic competition in the home labor\r\nmarket was so fierce and so determined that Congress yielded. President\r\nArthur vetoed a bill prohibiting Chinese immigration as \"a breach of our\r\nnational faith,\" but he admitted the need of legislation on the subject\r\nand finally approved a bill suspending immigration from China for a term\r\nof years. This was a beginning of legislation which eventually arrived\r\nat a policy of complete exclusion. The Mormon question was dealt with\r\nby the Act of March 22, 1882, imposing penalties upon the practice of\r\npolygamy and placing the conduct of elections in the Territory of\r\nUtah under the supervision of a board of five persons appointed by the\r\nPresident. Though there were many prosecutions under this act, it\r\nproved so ineffectual in suppressing polygamy that it was eventually\r\nsupplemented by giving the Government power to seize and administer the\r\nproperty of the Mormon Church. This action, resulting from the Act of\r\nMarch 3, 1887, created a momentous precedent. The escheated property\r\nwas held by the Government until 1896 and meanwhile, the Mormon Church\r\nsubmitted to the law and made a formal declaration that it had abandoned\r\npolygamy.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which a lack of agreement between the executive and\r\nthe legislative branches of the Government manifested itself, arose\r\nout of a scheme which President Arthur recommended to Congress for the\r\nimprovement of the waterways of the Mississippi and its tributaries. The\r\nresponse of Congress was a bill in which there was an appropriation of\r\nabout $4,000,000 for the general improvements recommended, but about\r\n$14,000,000 were added for other special river and harbor schemes which\r\nhad obtained congressional favor. President Arthur's veto message of\r\nAugust 1, 1882, condemned the bill because it contained provisions\r\ndesigned \"entirely for the benefit of the particular localities in which\r\nit is proposed to make the improvements.\" He thus described a type\r\nof legislation of which the nation had and is still having bitter\r\nexperience: \"As the citizens of one State find that money, to raise\r\nwhich they in common with the whole country are taxed, is to be expended\r\nfor local improvements in another State, they demand similar benefits\r\nfor themselves, and it is not unnatural that they should seek to\r\nindemnify themselves for such use of the public funds by securing\r\nappropriations for similar improvements in their own neighborhood. Thus\r\nas the bill becomes more objectionable it secures more support.\" The\r\ntruth of this last assertion Congress immediately proved by passing the\r\nbill over the President's veto. Senator Hoar, who defended the bill, has\r\nadmitted that \"a large number of the members of the House who voted\r\nfor it lost their seats\" and that in his opinion the affair \"cost the\r\nRepublican party its majority in the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nLegislation regarding the tariff was, however, the event of Arthur's\r\nadministration which had the deepest effect upon the political\r\nsituation. Both national parties were reluctant to face the issue,\r\nbut the pressure of conditions became too strong for them. Revenue\r\narrangements originally planned for war needs were still amassing\r\nfunds in the Treasury vaults which were now far beyond the needs of the\r\nGovernment, and were at the same time deranging commerce and industry.\r\nIn times of war, the Treasury served as a financial conduit; peace had\r\nnow made it a catch basin whose excess accumulations embarrassed the\r\nTreasury and at the same time caused the business world to suffer\r\nfrom a scarcity of currency. In his annual message on December 6, 1881,\r\nPresident Arthur cautiously observed that it seemed to him \"that the\r\ntime has arrived when the people may justly demand some relief from the\r\npresent onerous burden.\" In his message of December 4, 1882, he was much\r\nmore emphatic. Calling attention to the fact that the annual surplus\r\nhad increased to more than $145,000,000, he observed that \"either the\r\nsurplus must lie idle in the Treasury or the Government will be forced\r\nto buy at market rates its bonds not then redeemable, and which under\r\nsuch circumstances cannot fail to command an enormous premium, or the\r\nswollen revenues will be devoted to extravagant expenditures, which, as\r\nexperience has taught, is ever the bane of an overflowing treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThe congressional agents of the protected industries were confronted\r\nby an exacting situation. The country was at peace but it was still\r\nburdened by war taxes, although the Government did not need the\r\naccumulating revenue and was actually embarrassed by its excess. The\r\nPresident had already made himself the spokesman of the popular demand\r\nfor a substantial reduction of taxes. Such a combination of forces in\r\nfavor of lightening the popular burden might seem to be constitutionally\r\nirresistible, but by adroit maneuvering the congressional supporters of\r\nprotection managed to have the war rates generally maintained and, in\r\nsome cases, even increased. The case is a typical example of the way\r\nin which advantage of strategic position in a governmental system can\r\nprevail against mere numbers.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of May 15, 1882, a tariff commission was created to examine\r\nthe industrial situation and make recommendations as to rates of duty.\r\nThe President appointed men who stood high in the commercial world\r\nand who were strongly attached to the protective system. They applied\r\nthemselves to their task with such energy that by December 4, 1882, they\r\nhad produced a voluminous report with suggested amendments to customs\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nBut the advocates of high protection in the House were not satisfied;\r\nthey opposed the recommendations of the report and urged that the best\r\nand quickest way to reduce taxation was by abolishing or reducing items\r\non the internal revenue list. This policy not only commanded support on\r\nthe Republican side, but also received the aid of a Democratic faction\r\nwhich avowed protectionist principles and claimed party sanction for\r\nthem. These political elements in the House were strong enough to\r\nprevent action on the customs tariff, but a bill was passed reducing\r\nsome of the internal revenue taxes. This action seemed likely to prevent\r\ntariff revision at least during that session. Formidable obstacles, both\r\nconstitutional and parliamentary, stood in the way of action, but they\r\nwere surmounted by ingenious management.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that all revenue bills shall originate in\r\nthe House of Representatives, but the Senate has the right to propose\r\namendments. Under cover of this clause the Senate originated a\r\nvoluminous tariff bill and tacked it to the House bill as an amendment.\r\nWhen the bill, as thus amended, came back to the House, a two-thirds\r\nvote would have been required by the existing rules to take it up for\r\nconsideration, but this obstacle was overcome by adopting a new rule\r\nby which a bare majority of the House could forthwith take up a bill\r\namended by the Senate, for the purpose of non-concurrence but not for\r\nconcurrence. The object of this maneuver was to get the bill into a\r\ncommittee of conference where the details could be arranged by private\r\nnegotiation. The rule was adopted on February 26, 1883, but the\r\ncommittee of conference was not finally constituted until the 1st of\r\nMarch, within two days of the close of the session. On the 3rd of March,\r\nwhen this committee reported a measure on which they had agreed, both\r\nHouses adopted this report and enacted the measure without further ado.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, rates were fixed by the committee above the figures voted\r\nin either House and even when there was no disagreement, changes were\r\nmade. The tariff commission had recommended, for example, a duty of\r\nfifty cents a ton on iron ore, and both the Senate and the House voted\r\nto put the duty at that figure; but the conference committee fixed the\r\nrate at seventy-five cents. When a conference committee report comes\r\nbefore the House, it is adopted or rejected in toto, as it is not\r\ndivisible or amendable. In theory, the revision of a report is feasible\r\nby sending it back to conference under instructions voted by the House,\r\nbut such a procedure is not really available in the closing hours of a\r\nsession, and the only practical course of action is either to pass the\r\nbill as shaped by the conferees or else to accept the responsibility\r\nfor inaction. Thus pressed for time, Congress passed a bill containing\r\nfeatures obnoxious to a majority in both Houses and offensive to public\r\nopinion. Senator Sherman in his \"Recollections\" expressed regret that he\r\nhad voted for the bill and declared that, had the recommendations of the\r\ntariff commission been adopted, \"the tariff would have been settled\r\nfor many years,\" but \"many persons wishing to advance their particular\r\nindustries appeared before the committee and succeeded in having their\r\nviews adopted.\" In his annual message, December 4, 1883, President\r\nArthur accepted the act as a response to the demand for a reduction\r\nof taxation, which was sufficiently tolerable to make further effort\r\ninexpedient until its effects could be definitely ascertained; but he\r\nremarked that he had \"no doubt that still further reductions may be\r\nwisely made.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, President Arthur's administration may therefore be\r\naccurately described as a period of political groping and party\r\nfluctuation. In neither of the great national parties was there a\r\nsincere and definite attitude on the new issues which were clamorous for\r\nattention, and the public discontent was reflected in abrupt changes of\r\npolitical support. There was a general feeling of distrust regarding the\r\ncharacter and capacity of the politicians at Washington, and election\r\nresults were apparently dictated more by fear than by hope. One party\r\nwould be raised up and the other party cast down, not because the one\r\nwas trusted more than the other, but because it was for a while less\r\nodious. Thus a party success might well be a prelude to a party disaster\r\nbecause neither party knew how to improve its political opportunity.\r\nThe record of party fluctuation in Congress during this period is almost\r\nunparalleled in sharpness.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  In 1875, at the opening of the Forty-fourth Congress, the House\r\nstood 110 Republicans and 182 Democrats. In 1881, the House stood 150\r\nRepublicans to 131 Democrats, with 12 Independent members. In 1884, the\r\nRepublican list had declined to 119 and the Democratic had grown to 201,\r\nand there were five Independents. The Senate, although only a third\r\nof its membership is renewed every two years, displayed extraordinary\r\nchanges during this period. The Republican membership of 46 in 1876 had\r\ndeclined to 33 by 1880, and the Democratic membership had increased\r\nto 42. In 1882, the Senate was evenly balanced in party strength, each\r\nparty having 37 avowed adherents, but there were two Independents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn state politics, the polling showed that both parties were disgusted\r\nwith their leadership and that there was a public indifference to issues\r\nwhich kept people away from the polls. A comparison of the total vote\r\ncast in state elections in 1882 with that cast in the presidential\r\nelection of 1880, showed a decline of over eight hundred thousand in the\r\nRepublican vote and of nearly four hundred thousand in the Democratic\r\nvote. The most violent of the party changes that took place during this\r\nperiod occurred in the election of 1882, in New York State, when the\r\nRepublican vote showed a decline of over two hundred thousand and the\r\nDemocratic candidate for Governor was elected by a plurality of nearly\r\nthat amount. It was this election which brought Grover Cleveland into\r\nnational prominence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE ADVENT OF CLEVELAND\r\n\r\nPopular dissatisfaction with the behavior of public authority had not\r\nup to this time extended to the formal Constitution. Schemes of radical\r\nrearrangement of the political institutions of the country had not yet\r\nbeen agitated. New party movements were devoted to particular measures\r\nsuch as fresh greenback issues or the prohibition of liquor traffic.\r\nPopular reverence for the Constitution was deep and strong, and it was\r\nthe habit of the American people to impute practical defects not to the\r\ngovernmental system itself but to the character of those acting in\r\nit. Burke, as long ago as 1770, remarked truly that \"where there is a\r\nregular scheme of operations carried on, it is the system and not any\r\nindividual person who acts in it that is truly dangerous.\" But it is an\r\ninveterate habit of public opinion to mistake results for causes and\r\nto vent its resentment upon persons when misgovernment occurs. That\r\ndisposition was bitterly intense at this period. \"Turn the rascals out\"\r\nwas the ordinary campaign slogan of an opposition party, and calumny\r\nformed the staple of its argument. Of course no party could establish\r\nexclusive proprietorship to such tactics, and whichever party might be\r\nin power in a particular locality was cast for the villain's part in the\r\npolitical drama. But as changes of party control took place, experience\r\ntaught that the only practical result was to introduce new players into\r\nthe same old game. Such experience spread among the people a despairing\r\nfeeling that American politics were hopelessly depraved, and at the same\r\ntime it gave them a deep yearning for some strong deliverer. To this\r\nmessianic hope of politics may be ascribed what is in some respects the\r\nmost remarkable career in the political history of the United States.\r\nThe rapid and fortuitous rise of Grover Cleveland to political eminence\r\nis without a parallel in the records of American statesmanship,\r\nnotwithstanding many instances of public distinction attained from\r\nhumble beginnings.\r\n\r\nThe antecedents of Cleveland were Americans of the best type. He was\r\ndescended from a colonial stock which had settled in the Connecticut\r\nValley. His earliest ancestor of whom there is any exact knowledge\r\nwas Aaron Cleveland, an Episcopal clergyman, who died at East Haddam,\r\nConnecticut, in 1757, after founding a family which in every generation\r\nfurnished recruits to the ministry. It argues a hereditary disposition\r\nfor independent judgment that among these there was a marked variation\r\nin denominational choice. Aaron Cleveland was so strong in his\r\nattachment to the Anglican church that to be ordained he went to\r\nEngland--under the conditions of travel in those days a hard, serious\r\nundertaking. His son, also named Aaron, became a Congregational\r\nminister. Two of the sons of the younger Aaron became ministers, one\r\nof them an Episcopalian like his grandfather. Another son, William,\r\nwho became a prosperous silversmith, was for many years a deacon in\r\nthe church in which his father preached. William sent his second son,\r\nRichard, to Yale, where he graduated with honors at the age of nineteen.\r\nHe turned to the Presbyterian church, studied theology at Princeton, and\r\nupon receiving ordination began a ministerial career which like that\r\nof many preachers was carried on in many pastorates. He was settled at\r\nCaldwell, New Jersey, in his third pastorate, and there Stephen Grover\r\nCleveland was born, on March 18, 1837, the fifth in a family of children\r\nthat eventually increased to nine. He was named after the Presbyterian\r\nminister who was his father's predecessor. The first name soon dropped\r\nout of use, and from childhood he went by his middle name, a practice of\r\nwhich the Clevelands supply so many instances that it seems to be quite\r\na family trait.\r\n\r\nIn campaign literature, so much has been made of the humble\r\ncircumstances in which Grover made his start in life, that the unwary\r\nreader might easily imagine that the future President was almost a waif.\r\nNothing could be farther from the truth. He really belonged to the most\r\nauthentic aristocracy that any state of society can produce--that which\r\nmaintains its standards and principles from generation to generation\r\nby the integrity of the stock without any endowment of wealth.\r\nThe Clevelands were people who reared large families and sustained\r\nthemselves with dignity and credit on narrow means. It was a settled\r\ntradition with such republican aristocrats that a son destined for a\r\nlearned profession--usually the ministry--should be sent to college,\r\nand for that purpose heroic economies were practiced in the family. The\r\nopportunities which wealth can confer are really trivial in comparison\r\nwith the advantage of being born and reared in such bracing conditions\r\nas those which surrounded Grover Cleveland. As a boy he was a clerk in\r\na country store, but his education was not neglected and at the age of\r\nfifteen he was studying, with a view to entering college. His father's\r\ndeath ended that prospect and forced him to go to work again to help\r\nsupport the family. Some two years later, when the family circumstances\r\nwere sufficiently eased so that he could strike out for himself, he\r\nset off westward, intending to reach Cleveland. Arriving at Buffalo, he\r\ncalled upon a married aunt, who, on learning that he was planning to\r\nget work at Cleveland with the idea of becoming a lawyer, advised him\r\nto stay in Buffalo where opportunities were better. Young Cleveland was\r\ntaken into her home virtually as private secretary to her husband, Lewis\r\nF. Allen, a man of means, culture, and public spirit. Allen occupied a\r\nlarge house with spacious grounds in a suburb of the city, and owned a\r\nfarm on which he bred fine cattle. He issued the \"American Short-Horn\r\nHerd Book,\" a standard authority for pedigree stock, and the fifth\r\nedition, published in 1861, made a public acknowledgment of \"the\r\nkindness, industry, and ability\" with which Grover Cleveland had\r\nassisted the editor \"in correcting and arranging the pedigrees for\r\npublication.\"\r\n\r\nWith his uncle's friendship to back him, Cleveland had, of course, no\r\ndifficulty in getting into a reputable law office as a student,\r\nand thereafter his affairs moved steadily along the road by which\r\ninnumerable young Americans of diligence and industry have advanced\r\nto success in the legal profession. Cleveland's career as a lawyer was\r\nmarked by those steady, solid gains in reputation which result from care\r\nand thoroughness rather than from brilliancy, and in these respects\r\nit finds many parallels among lawyers of the trustee type. What is\r\nexceptional and peculiar in Cleveland's career is the way in which\r\npolitical situations formed about him without any contrivance on his\r\npart, and as it were projected him from office to office until he\r\narrived in the White House.\r\n\r\nAt the outset nothing could have seemed more unlikely than such a\r\ncareer. Cleveland's ambitions were bound up in his profession and his\r\npolitics were opposed to those of the powers holding local control. But\r\nthe one circumstance did not shut him out of political vocation and\r\nthe other became a positive advantage. He entered public life in 1863\r\nthrough an unsought appointment as assistant district attorney for Erie\r\nCounty. The incumbent of the office was in poor health and needed an\r\nassistant on whom he could rely to do the work. Hence Cleveland was\r\ncalled into service. His actual occupancy of the position prompted his\r\nparty to nominate him to the office; and although he was defeated, he\r\nreceived a vote so much above the normal voting strength of his party\r\nthat, in 1869, he was picked for the nomination to the office of sheriff\r\nto strengthen a party ticket made up in the interest of a congressional\r\ncandidate. The expectation was that while the district might be carried\r\nfor the Democratic candidate for Congress, Cleveland would probably fail\r\nof election. The nomination was virtually forced upon him against\r\nhis wishes. But he was elected by a small plurality. This success,\r\nreenforced by his able conduct of the office, singled him out as the\r\nparty's hope for success in the Buffalo municipal election; and after\r\nhis term as sheriff he was nominated for mayor, again without any effort\r\non his part. Although ordinarily the Democratic party was in a hopeless\r\nminority, Cleveland was elected. It was in this campaign that he\r\nenunciated the principle that public office is a public trust, which was\r\nhis rule of action throughout his career. Both as sheriff and as mayor\r\nhe acted upon it with a vigor that brought him into collision with\r\npredatory politicians, and the energy and address with which he defended\r\npublic interests made him widely known as the reform mayor of Buffalo.\r\nHis record and reputation naturally attracted the attention of the state\r\nmanagers of the Democratic party, who were casting about for a candidate\r\nstrong enough to overthrow the established Republican control, and\r\nCleveland was just as distinctly drafted for the nomination to the\r\ngovernorship in 1882 as he had been for his previous offices.\r\n\r\nIn his career as governor Cleveland displayed the same stanch\r\ncharacteristics as before, and he was fearless and aggressive in\r\nmaintaining his principles. The most striking characteristic of his veto\r\nmessages is the utter absence of partisan or personal designs. Some\r\nof the bills he vetoed purported to benefit labor interests, and\r\npoliticians are usually fearful of any appearance of opposition to such\r\ninterests: His veto of the bill establishing a five cent fare for the\r\nNew York elevated railways was an action of a kind to make him a target\r\nfor calumny and misrepresentation. Examination of the record reveals no\r\ninstance in which Cleveland flinched from doing his duty or faltered in\r\nthe full performance of it. He acted throughout in his avowed capacity\r\nof a public trustee, and he conducted the office of governor with the\r\nsame laborious fidelity which he had displayed as sheriff and as mayor.\r\nAnd now, as before, he antagonized elements of his own party who\r\nsought only the opportunities of office and cared little for its\r\nresponsibilities. He did not unite suavity of manner with vigor of\r\naction, and at times he allowed himself to reflect upon the motives of\r\nopponents and to use language that was personally offensive. He told the\r\nLegislature in one veto message that \"of all the defective and shabby\r\nlegislation which has been presented to me, this is the worst and most\r\ninexcusable.\" He once sent a scolding message to the State Senate, in\r\nwhich he said that \"the money of the State is apparently expended with\r\nno regard to economy,\" and that \"barefaced jobbery has been permitted.\"\r\nThe Senate having refused to confirm a certain appointee, he declared\r\nthat the opposition had \"its rise in an overwhelming greed for the\r\npatronage which may attach to the place,\" and that the practical\r\neffect of such opposition was to perpetuate \"the practice of unblushing\r\npeculation.\" What he said was quite true and it was the kind of truth\r\nthat hurt. The brusqueness of his official style and the censoriousness\r\nof his language infused even more personal bitterness into the\r\nopposition which developed within his own party than in that felt in the\r\nranks of the opposing party. At the same time, these traits delighted\r\na growing body of reformers hostile to both the regular parties. These\r\n\"Mugwumps,\" as they were called, were as a class so addicted to personal\r\ninvective that it was said of them with as much truth as wit that they\r\nbrought malice into politics without even the excuse of partisanship.\r\nBut it was probably the enthusiastic support of this class which turned\r\nthe scale in New York in the presidential election of 1884.\r\n\r\nIn the national conventions of that year, there was an unusually small\r\namount of factional strife. In the Republican convention, President\r\nArthur was a candidate, but party sentiment was so strong for Blaine\r\nthat he led Arthur on the first ballot and was nominated on the fourth\r\nby a large majority. In the Democratic convention, Cleveland was\r\nnominated on the second ballot. Meanwhile, his opponents had organized a\r\nnew party from which more was expected than it actually accomplished.\r\nIt assumed the title Anti-Monopoly and chose the notorious demagogue,\r\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler, as its candidate for President.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign, the satirical cartoon attained a power and an\r\neffectiveness difficult to realize now that it has become an ordinary\r\nfeature of journalism, equally available for any school of opinion. But\r\nit so happened that the rise of Cleveland in politics coincided with the\r\nartistic career of Joseph Keppler, who came to this country from Vienna\r\nand who for some years supported himself chiefly as an actor in\r\nWestern theatrical companies. He had studied drawing in Vienna and\r\nhad contributed cartoons to periodicals in that city. After some\r\nunsuccessful ventures in illustrated journalism, he started a pictorial\r\nweekly in New York in 1875. It was originally printed in German, but in\r\nless than a year it was issued also in English. It was not until\r\n1879 that it sprang into general notice through Keppler's success in\r\nreproducing lithographed designs in color. Meanwhile, the artist was\r\nfeeling his way from the old style caricature, crowded with figures with\r\noverhead loops of explanatory text, to designs possessing an artistic\r\nunity expressive of an idea plain enough to tell its own story. He had\r\nmatured both his mechanical resources and his artistic method by the\r\ntime the campaign of 1884 came on, and he had founded a school which\r\ncould apply the style to American politics with aptness superior to\r\nhis own. It was Bernhard Gillam, who, working in the new Keppler style,\r\nproduced a series of cartoons whose tremendous impressiveness was\r\nuniversally recognized. Blaine was depicted as the tattooed man and was\r\nexhibited in that character in all sorts of telling situations. While\r\non the stump during the campaign, Blaine had sometimes literally to wade\r\nthrough campaign documents assailing his personal integrity, and phrases\r\nculled from them were chanted in public processions. One of the features\r\nof a great parade of business men of New York was a periodical chorus\r\nof \"Burn this letter,\" suiting the action to the word and thus making a\r\nstriking pyrotechnic display.* But the cartoons reached people who\r\nwould never have been touched by campaign documents or by campaign\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The allusion was to the Mulligan letters, which had been made\r\npublic by Mr. Blaine himself when it had been charged that they\r\ncontained evidence of corrupt business dealings. The disclosure had been\r\nmade four years before and ample opportunity had existed for instituting\r\nproceedings if the case warranted it, but nothing was done except to\r\nnurse the scandal for campaign use.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the exceptional violence and novel ingenuity of the\r\nattacks made upon him, Blaine met them with such ability and address\r\nthat everywhere he augmented the ordinary strength of his party, and his\r\neventual defeat was generally attributed to an untoward event among his\r\nown adherents at the close of the campaign. At a political reception\r\nin the interest of Blaine among New York clergymen, the Reverend Dr.\r\nBurchard spoke of the Democratic party as \"the party of rum, Romanism,\r\nand rebellion.\" Unfortunately Blaine did not hear him distinctly enough\r\nto repudiate this slur upon the religious belief of millions of American\r\ncitizens, and alienation of sentiment caused by the tactless and\r\nintolerant remark could easily account for Blaine's defeat by a small\r\nmargin. He was only 1149 votes behind Cleveland in New York in a poll of\r\nover 1,125,000 votes, and only 23,005 votes behind in a national poll of\r\nover 9,700,000 votes for the leading candidates. Of course Cleveland\r\nin his turn was a target of calumny, and in his case the end of the\r\ncampaign did not bring the customary relief. He was pursued to the end\r\nof his public career by active, ingenious, resourceful, personal spite\r\nand steady malignity of political opposition from interests whose enmity\r\nhe had incurred while Governor of New York.\r\n\r\nThe situation which confronted Cleveland when he became President was\r\nso complicated and embarrassing that perhaps even the most sagacious and\r\nresourceful statesman could not have coped with it successfully, though\r\nit is the characteristic of genius to accomplish the impossible. But\r\nCleveland was no genius; he was not even a man of marked talent. He was\r\nstanch, plodding, laborious, and dutiful; but he was lacking in ability\r\nto penetrate to the heart of obscure political problems and to deal\r\nwith primary causes rather than with effects. The great successes of his\r\nadministration were gained in particular problems whose significance had\r\nalready been clearly defined. In this field, Cleveland's resolute and\r\nenergetic performance of duty had splendid results.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Cleveland's inauguration as President, the Senate claimed\r\nan extent of authority which, if allowed to go unchallenged, would\r\nhave turned the Presidency into an office much like that of the doge\r\nof Venice, one of ceremonial dignity without real power. \"The\r\nFederalist\"--that matchless collection of constitutional essays written\r\nby Hamilton, Madison, and Jay--laid down the doctrine that \"against the\r\nenterprising ambition\" of the legislative department \"the people ought\r\nto indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.\"\r\nBut some of the precautions taken in framing the Constitution proved\r\nineffectual from the start. The right conferred upon the President to\r\nrecommend to the consideration of Congress \"such measures as he shall\r\njudge necessary and expedient,\" was emptied of practical importance by\r\nthe success of Congress in interpreting it as meaning no more than that\r\nthe President may request Congress to take a subject into consideration.\r\nIn practice, Congress considers only such measures as are recommended by\r\nits own committees. The framers of the Constitution took special pains\r\nto fortify the President's position by the veto power, which is treated\r\nat length in the Constitution. By a special clause, the veto power was\r\nextended to \"every order, resolution or vote... except on a question of\r\nadjournment\"--a clause which apparently should enable the President\r\nto strike off the \"riders\" continually put upon appropriation bills to\r\ncoerce executive action; but no President has ventured to exercise\r\nthis authority. Although the Senate was joined to the President as an\r\nadvisory council in appointments to office, it was explained in \"The\r\nFederalist\" that \"there will be no exertion of choice on the part of\r\nSenators.\" Nevertheless, the Senate has claimed and exercised the right\r\nto dictate appointments. While thus successfully encroaching upon the\r\nauthority of the President, the Senate had also been signally successful\r\nin encroaching upon the authority of the House. The framers of the\r\nConstitution anticipated for the House a masterful career like that of\r\nthe House of Commons, and they feared that the Senate could not\r\nprotect itself in the discharge of its own functions; so, although the\r\ntraditional principle that all revenue bills should originate in the\r\nHouse was taken over into the Constitution, it was modified by the\r\nproviso that \"the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on\r\nother bills.\" This right to propose amendments has been improved by the\r\nSenate until the prerogative of the House has been reduced to an empty\r\nform. Any money bill may be made over by amendment in the Senate,\r\nand when contests have followed, the Senate has been so successful in\r\nimposing its will upon the House that the House has acquired the habit\r\nof submission. Not long before the election of Cleveland, as has been\r\npointed out, this habitual deference of the House had enabled the Senate\r\nto originate a voluminous tariff act in the form of an amendment to the\r\nInternal Revenue Bill voted by the House.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these extensions of power through superior address in\r\nmanagement, the ascendancy of the Senate was fortified by positive law.\r\nIn 1867, when President Johnson fell out with the Republican leaders in\r\nCongress, a Tenure of Office Act was passed over his veto, which\r\ntook away from the President the power of making removals except by\r\npermission of the Senate. In 1869, when Johnson's term had expired, a\r\nbill for the unconditional repeal of this law passed the House with\r\nonly sixteen votes in the negative, but the Senate was able to force a\r\ncompromise act which perpetuated its authority over removals.* President\r\nGrant complained of this act as \"being inconsistent with a faithful and\r\nefficient administration of the government,\" but with all his great\r\nfame and popularity he was unable to induce the Senate to relinquish the\r\npower it had gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The Act of April 5, 1869, required the President, within thirty\r\ndays after the opening of the sessions, to nominate persons for all\r\nvacant offices, whether temporarily filled or not, and in place of all\r\nofficers who may have been suspended during the recess of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law was now invoked by Republicans as a means of counteracting\r\nthe result of the election. Such was the feeling of the times that\r\npartisanship could easily masquerade as patriotism. Republicans still\r\nbelieved that as saviors of the Union they had a prescriptive right to\r\nthe government. During the campaign, Eugene Field, the famous Western\r\npoet, had given a typical expression of this sentiment in some scornful\r\nverses concluding with this defiant notice:\r\n\r\nThese quondam rebels come today In penitential form, And hypocritically\r\nsay The country needs \"Reform!\" Out on reformers such as these; By\r\nFreedom's sacred powers, We'll run the country as we please; We saved\r\nit, and it's ours.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Democratic party had won the Presidency and the House, the\r\nRepublicans still retained control of the Senate, and they were expected\r\nas a matter of course to use their powers for party advantage. Some\r\nmemorable struggles, rich in constitutional precedents, issued from\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cleveland was seated in the presidential chair, he had to\r\ndeal with a tremendous onslaught of office seekers. In ordinary business\r\naffairs, a man responsible for general policy and management would\r\nnever be expected to fritter away his time and strength in receiving\r\napplicants for employment. The fact that such servitude is imposed\r\nupon the President of the United States shows that American political\r\narrangements are still rather barbaric, for such usages are more\r\nsuitable to some kinglet seated under a tree to receive the petitions of\r\nhis tribesmen than they are to a republican magistrate charged with the\r\nwelfare of millions of people distributed over a vast continent. Office\r\nseekers apparently regard themselves as a privileged class with a right\r\nof personal access to the President, and any appearances of aloofness or\r\nreserve on his part gives sharp offense. The exceptional force of\r\nsuch claims of privilege in the United States may be attributed to the\r\nparticipation which members of Congress have acquired in the appointing\r\npower. The system thus created imposes upon the President the duties\r\nof an employment agent, and at the same time engages Congressmen in\r\ncontinual occupation as office brokers. The President cannot deny\r\nhimself to Congressmen, since he is dependent upon their favor for\r\nopportunity to get legislative consideration for his measures.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that numerous changes in office should take place\r\nwhen the Democratic party came into power, after being excluded for\r\ntwenty-four years. It may be admitted that, in a sound constitutional\r\nsystem, a change of management in the public business would not vacate\r\nall offices any more than in private business, but would affect only\r\nsuch leading positions as are responsible for policy and discipline.\r\nSuch a sensible system, however, had existed only in the early days of\r\nthe republic and at the time of Cleveland's accession to office federal\r\noffices were generally used as party barracks. The situation which\r\nconfronted President Cleveland he thus described in later years:\r\n\r\n\"In numerous instances the post-offices were made headquarters for local\r\nparty committees and organizations and the centers of partisan scheming.\r\nParty literature favorable to the postmaster's party, that never passed\r\nregularly through the mails, was distributed through the post-offices as\r\nan item of party service; and matter of a political character, passing\r\nthrough the mails in the usual course and addressed to patrons belonging\r\nto the opposite party, was withheld; disgusting and irritating placards\r\nwere prominently displayed in many post-offices, and the attention of\r\nDemocratic inquirers for mail matter was tauntingly directed to them\r\nby the postmaster; and in various other ways postmasters and similar\r\nofficials annoyed and vexed those holding opposite political opinions,\r\nwho, in common with all having business at public offices, were entitled\r\nto considerate and obliging treatment. In some quarters, official\r\nincumbents neglected public duty to do political work and especially in\r\nSouthern States, they frequently were not only inordinately active in\r\nquestionable political work, but sought to do party service by secret\r\nand sinister manipulation of colored votes, and by other practices\r\ninviting avoidable and dangerous collisions between the white and\r\ncolored population.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Cleveland, \"Presidential Problems,\" pp. 42-43.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administration began its career in March, 1885. The Senate did not\r\nconvene until December. Meanwhile, removals and appointments went on\r\nin the public service, the total for ten months being six hundred and\r\nforty-three which was thirty-seven less than the number of removals made\r\nby President Grant in seven weeks, in 1869.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the statute of 1869, President Cleveland sent in all the\r\nrecess appointments within thirty days after the opening of the\r\nsession. They were referred to various committees according to the long\r\nestablished custom of the Senate, but the Senate moved so slowly\r\nthat three months after the opening of the session, only seventeen\r\nnominations had been considered, fifteen of which the Senate confirmed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Senate had raised an issue which the President met with\r\na force and a directness probably unexpected. Among the recess\r\nappointments was one to the office of District Attorney for the Southern\r\nDistrict of Alabama, in place of an officer who had been suspended in\r\nJuly 1885, but whose term of office expired by limitation on December\r\n20, 1885. Therefore, at the time the Senate took up the case, the Tenure\r\nof Office Act did not apply to it, and the only question actually\r\nopen was whether the acting officer should be confirmed or rejected.\r\nNevertheless, the disposition to assert control over executive action\r\nwas so strong that the Senate drifted into a constitutional struggle\r\nover a case that did not then involve the question of the President's\r\ndiscretionary power of removal from office, which was really the point\r\nat issue.\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 1885, the Judiciary Committee notified the\r\nAttorney-General to transmit \"all papers and information in the\r\npossession of the Department\" regarding both the nomination and \"the\r\nsuspension and proposed removal from office\" of the former incumbent. On\r\nJanuary 11, 1886, the Attorney-General sent to the Committee the papers\r\nbearing upon the nomination, but withheld those touching the removal\r\non the ground that he had \"received no direction from the President in\r\nrelation to their transmission.\" The matter was debated by the Senate\r\nin executive session and on January 25, 1886, a resolution was\r\nadopted which was authoritative in its tone and which directed the\r\nAttorney-General to transmit copies of all documents and papers in\r\nrelation to the conduct of the office of District Attorney for the\r\nSouthern District of Alabama since January 1, 1885. Within three days,\r\nAttorney-General Garland responded that he had already transmitted all\r\npapers relating to the nomination; but with regard to the demand for\r\npapers exclusively relating to the suspension of the former incumbent he\r\nwas directed by the President to say \"that it is not considered that the\r\npublic interests will be promoted by a compliance.\"\r\n\r\nThe response of the Attorney-General was referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee which, on the 18th of February, made an elaborate report\r\nexhibiting the issue as one which involved the right of Congress to\r\nobtain information. It urged that \"the important question, then, is\r\nwhether it is within the constitutional competence of either House of\r\nCongress to have access to the official papers and documents in the\r\nvarious public offices of the United States, created by laws enacted by\r\nthemselves.\" The report, which was signed only by the Republican\r\nmembers of the Committee, was an adroit partisan performance, invoking\r\ntraditional constitutional principles in behalf of congressional\r\nprivilege. A distinct and emphatic assertion of the prerogative of the\r\nSenate was made, however, in resolutions recommended to the Senate for\r\nadoption. Those resolutions censured the Attorney-General and declared\r\nit to be the duty of the Senate \"to refuse its advice and consent\r\nto proposed removals of officers\" when papers relating to them \"are\r\nwithheld by the Executive or any head of a department.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, a minority report was submitted, making the point\r\nof which the cogency was obvious, that inasmuch as the term of the\r\nofficial concerning whose suspension the Senate undertook to inquire had\r\nalready expired by legal limitation, the only object in pressing for the\r\npapers in his case must be to review an act of the President which\r\nwas no longer within the jurisdiction of the Senate, even if the\r\nconstitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act should be granted.\r\nThe report also showed that of the precedents cited in behalf of the\r\nmajority's contention, the applicability could be maintained only of\r\nthose which were supplied by cases arising since 1867, before which time\r\nthe right of the President to remove officers at his own discretion was\r\nfully conceded.\r\n\r\nThe controversy had so far followed the ordinary lines of partisan\r\ncontention in Congress, which public opinion was accustomed to regard\r\nwith contemptuous indifference as mere sparring for points in the\r\nelectioneering game. President Cleveland now intervened in a way which\r\nriveted the attention of the nation upon the issue. Ever since the\r\nmemorable struggle which began when the Senate censured President\r\nJackson and did not end until that censure was expunged, the Senate\r\nhad been chary of a direct encounter with the President. Although the\r\nresponse of the Attorney-General stated that he was acting under the\r\ndirection of the President, the pending resolutions avoided any mention\r\nof the President but expressed \"condemnation of the refusal of the\r\nAttorney-General under whatever influence, to send to the Senate\" the\r\nrequired papers. The logical implication was that, when the orders\r\nof the President and the Senate conflicted, it was the duty of the\r\nAttorney-General to obey the Senate. This raised an issue which\r\nPresident Cleveland met by sending to the Senate his message of March\r\n1, 1886, which has taken a high rank among American constitutional\r\ndocuments. It is strong in its logic, dignified in its tone, terse,\r\ndirect, and forceful in its diction.\r\n\r\nCleveland's message opened with the statement that \"ever since the\r\nbeginning of the present session of the Senate, the different heads of\r\nthe departments attached to the executive branch of the government have\r\nbeen plied with various requests and documents from committees of the\r\nSenate, from members of such committees, and at last from the Senate\r\nitself, requiring the transmission of reasons for the suspension of\r\ncertain officials during the recess of that body, or for papers touching\r\nthe conduct of such officials.\" The President then observed that \"though\r\nthese suspensions are my executive acts, based upon considerations\r\naddressed to me alone and for which I am wholly responsible, I have had\r\nno invitation from the Senate to state the position which I have felt\r\nconstrained to assume.\" Further on, he clinched this admission of full\r\nresponsibility by declaring that \"the letter of the Attorney-General in\r\nresponse to the resolution of the Senate... was written at my suggestion\r\nand by my direction.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement made clear in the sight of the nation that the true issue\r\nwas between the President and the Senate. The strength of the Senate's\r\nposition lay in its claim to the right of access to the records\r\nof public offices \"created by laws enacted by themselves.\" The\r\ncounterstroke of the President was one of the most effective passages\r\nof his message in its effect upon public opinion. \"I do not suppose,\"\r\nhe said, \"that the public offices of the United States are regulated or\r\ncontrolled in their relations to either House of Congress by the fact\r\nthat they were 'created by laws enacted by themselves.' It must be that\r\nthese instrumentalities were enacted for the benefit of the people and\r\nto answer the general purposes of government under the Constitution and\r\nthe laws, and that they are unencumbered by any lien in favor of either\r\nbranch of Congress growing out of their construction, and unembarrassed\r\nby any obligation to the Senate as the price of their creation.\"\r\n\r\nThe President asserted that, as a matter of fact, no official papers\r\non file in the departments had been withheld. \"While it is by no means\r\nconceded that the Senate has the right, in any case, to review the\r\nact of the Executive in removing or suspending a public officer upon\r\nofficial documents or otherwise, it is considered that documents and\r\npapers of that nature should, because they are official, be freely\r\ntransmitted to the Senate upon its demand, trusting the use of the same,\r\nfor proper and legitimate purposes, to the good faith of that body; and\r\nthough no such paper or document has been especially demanded in any\r\nof the numerous requests and demands made upon the departments, yet as\r\noften as they were found in the public offices they have been furnished\r\nin answer to such applications.\" The point made by the President, with\r\nsharp emphasis, was that there was nothing in his action which could be\r\nconstrued as a refusal of access to official records; what he did refuse\r\nto acknowledge was the right of the Senate to inquire into his motives\r\nand to exact from him a disclosure of the facts, circumstances, and\r\nsources of information that prompted his action. The materials upon\r\nwhich his judgment was formed were of a varied character. \"They consist\r\nof letters and representations addressed to the Executive or intended\r\nfor his inspection; they are voluntarily written and presented by\r\nprivate citizens who are not in the least instigated thereto by any\r\nofficial invitation or at all subject to official control. While some\r\nof them are entitled to Executive consideration, many of them are so\r\nirrelevant or in the light of other facts so worthless, that they have\r\nnot been given the least weight in determining the question to which\r\nthey are supposed to relate.\" If such matter were to be considered\r\npublic records and subject to the inspection of the Senate, the\r\nPresident would thereby incur \"the risk of being charged with making a\r\nsuspension from office upon evidence which was not even considered.\"\r\n\r\nIssue as to the status of such documents was joined by the President\r\nin the sharpest possible way by the declaration: \"I consider them in no\r\nproper sense as upon the files of the department but as deposited there\r\nfor my convenience, remaining still completely under my control. I\r\nsuppose if I desired to take them into my custody I might do so\r\nwith entire propriety, and if I saw fit to destroy them no one could\r\ncomplain.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were cases in which action was prompted by oral\r\ncommunications which did not go on record in any form. As to this,\r\nCleveland observed, \"It will not be denied, I suppose, that the\r\nPresident may suspend a public officer in the entire absence of any\r\npapers or documents to aid his official judgment and discretion; and\r\nI am quite prepared to avow that the cases are not few in which\r\nsuspensions from office have depended more upon oral representations\r\nmade to me by citizens of known good repute and by members of the House\r\nof Representatives and Senators of the United States than upon any\r\nletters and documents presented for my examination.\" Nor were such\r\nrepresentations confined to members of his own party for, said he, \"I\r\nrecall a few suspensions which bear the approval of individual members\r\nidentified politically with the majority in the Senate.\" The message\r\nthen reviewed the legislative history of the Tenure of Office Act and\r\nquestioned its constitutionality. The position which the President had\r\ntaken and would maintain was exactly defined by this vigorous statement\r\nin his message:\r\n\r\n\"The requests and demands which by the score have for nearly three\r\nmonths been presented to the different Departments of the government,\r\nwhatever may be their form, have but one complexion. They assume\r\nthe right of the Senate to sit in judgement upon the exercise of my\r\nexclusive discretion and executive function, for which I am solely\r\nresponsible to the people from whom I have so lately received the sacred\r\ntrust of office. My oath to support and defend the Constitution, my duty\r\nto the people who have chosen me to execute the powers of their great\r\noffice and not relinquish them, and my duty to the chief magistracy\r\nwhich I must preserve unimpaired in all its dignity and vigor, compel me\r\nto refuse compliance with these demands.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a ringing quality in the style of this message not generally\r\ncharacteristic of President Cleveland's state papers. It evoked as\r\nringing a response from public opinion, and this effect was heightened\r\nby a tactless allusion to the message made at this time in the Senate.\r\nIn moving a reference of the message to the Judiciary Committee, its\r\nchairman, Senator Edmunds of Vermont, remarked that the presidential\r\nmessage brought vividly to his mind \"the communication of King Charles I\r\nto the Parliament, telling them what, in conducting their affairs, they\r\nought to do and ought not to do.\" The historical reference, however, had\r\nan application which Senator Edmunds did not foresee. It brought vividly\r\nto mind what the people of England had endured from a factional tyranny\r\nso relentless that the nation was delighted when Oliver Cromwell turned\r\nParliament out of doors. It is an interesting coincidence that the\r\nCleveland era was marked by what in the book trade was known as the\r\nCromwell boom. Another unfortunate remark made by Senator Edmunds was\r\nthat it was the first time \"that any President of the United States\r\nhas undertaken to interfere with the deliberations of either House of\r\nCongress on questions pending before them, otherwise than by message on\r\nthe state of the Union which the Constitution commands him to make from\r\ntime to time.\" The effect of this statement, however, was to stir up\r\nrecollections of President Jackson's message of protest against the\r\ncensure of the Senate. The principle laid down by Jackson in his message\r\nof April 15, 1834, was that \"the President is the direct representative\r\nof the American people,\" whereas the Senate is \"a body not directly\r\namenable to the people.\" However assailable this statement may be\r\nfrom the standpoint of traditional legal theory, it is indubitably the\r\nprinciple to which American politics conform in practice. The people\r\ninstinctively expect the President to guard their interests against\r\ncongressional machinations.\r\n\r\nThere was a prevalent belief that the Senate's profession of motives,\r\nof constitutional propriety, was insincere and that the position it had\r\nassumed would never have been thought of had the Republican candidate\r\nfor President been elected. A feeling that the Senate was not playing\r\nthe game fairly to refuse the Democrats their innings was felt even\r\namong Senator Edmunds' own adherents. A spirit of comity traversing\r\nparty lines is very noticeable in the intercourse of professional\r\npoliticians. Their willingness to help each other out is often\r\nmanifested, particularly in struggles involving control of party\r\nmachinery. Indeed, a system of ring rule in a governing party seems to\r\nhave for its natural concomitant the formation of a similar ring in the\r\nregular opposition, and the two rings maintain friendly relations behind\r\nthe forms of party antagonism. The situation is very similar to that\r\nwhich exists between opposing counsel in suits at law, where the\r\ncontentions at the trial table may seem to be full of animosity and may\r\nindeed at times really develop personal enmity, but which as a general\r\nrule are merely for effect and do not at all hinder cooperation in\r\nmatters pertaining to their common professional interest.\r\n\r\nThe attitude taken by the Senate in its opposition to President\r\nCleveland jarred upon this sense of professional comity, and it was\r\nvery noticeable that in the midst of the struggle some questionable\r\nnominations of notorious machine politicians were confirmed by\r\nthe Senate. It may have been that a desire to discredit the reform\r\nprofessions of the Administration contributed to this result, but the\r\neffect was disadvantageous to the Senate. \"The Nation\" on March 11,\r\n1886, in a powerful article reviewing the controversy observed: \"There\r\nis not the smallest reason for believing that, if the Senate won, it\r\nwould use its victory in any way for the maintenance or promotion of\r\nreform. In truth, in the very midst of the controversy, it confirmed the\r\nnomination of one of Baltimore's political scamps.\" It is certainly true\r\nthat the advising power of the Senate has never exerted a corrective\r\ninfluence upon appointments to office; its constant tendency is towards\r\na system of apportionment which concedes the right of the President\r\nto certain personal appointments and asserts the reciprocal right of\r\nCongressmen to their individual quotas.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these various influences, the position assumed by the\r\nRepublicans under the lead of Senator Edmunds was seriously weakened.\r\nWhen the resolutions of censure were put to the vote on the 26th of\r\nMarch, that condemning the refusal of the Attorney-General to produce\r\nthe papers was adopted by thirty-two ayes to twenty-six nays--a strict\r\nparty vote; but the resolution declaring it to be the duty of the\r\nSenate in all such cases to refuse its consent to removals of suspended\r\nofficials was adopted by a majority of only one vote, and two Republican\r\nSenators voted with the Democrats. The result was, in effect, a defeat\r\nfor the Republican leaders, and they wisely decided to withdraw from the\r\nposition which they had been holding. Shortly after the passage of the\r\nresolutions, the Senate confirmed the nomination over which the contest\r\nstarted, and thereafter the right of the President to make removals at\r\nhis own discretion was not questioned.\r\n\r\nThis retreat of the Republican leaders was accompanied, however, by a\r\nnew development in political tactics, which from the standpoint of party\r\nadvantage, was ingeniously conceived. It was now held that, inasmuch as\r\nthe President had avowed attachment to the principle of tenure of\r\noffice during good behavior, his action in suspending officers therefore\r\nimplied delinquency in their character or conduct from which they should\r\nbe exonerated in case the removal was really on partisan grounds. In\r\nreporting upon nominations, therefore, Senate committees adopted the\r\npractice of noting that there were no charges of misconduct against the\r\nprevious incumbents and that the suspension was on account of \"political\r\nreasons.\" As these proceedings took place in executive session, which is\r\nheld behind closed doors, reports of this character would not ordinarily\r\nreach the public, but the Senate now voted to remove the injunction of\r\nsecrecy, and the reports were published. The manifest object of these\r\nmaneuvers was to exhibit the President as acting upon the \"spoils\r\nsystem\" of distributing offices. The President's position was that he\r\nwas not accountable to the Senate in such matters. In his message of the\r\n1st of March he said: \"The pledges I have made were made to the people,\r\nand to them I am responsible for the manner in which they have been\r\nredeemed. I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to\r\nsubmit my actions and official conduct to them for judgement.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this contest was still going on, President Cleveland had to\r\nencounter another attempt of the Senate to take his authority out of his\r\nhands. The history of American diplomacy during this period belongs to\r\nanother volume in this series,* but a diplomatic question was drawn into\r\nthe struggle between the President and the Senate in such a way that it\r\nrequires mention here. Shortly after President Cleveland took office,\r\nthe fishery articles of the Treaty of Washington had terminated. In his\r\nfirst annual message to Congress, on December 8, 1885, he recommended\r\nthe appointment of a commission to settle with a similar commission\r\nfrom Great Britain \"the entire question of the fishery rights of the two\r\ngovernments and their respective citizens on the coasts of the United\r\nStates and British North America.\" But this sensible advice was\r\ndenounced as weak and cowardly. Oratory of the kind known as \"twisting\r\nthe lion's tail\" resounded in Congress. Claims were made of natural\r\nright to the use of Canadian waters which would not have been indulged\r\nfor a moment in respect of the territorial waters of the United States.\r\nFor instance, it was held that a bay over six miles between headlands\r\ngave free ingress so long as vessels kept three miles from shore--a\r\ndoctrine which, if applied to Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, or\r\nChesapeake Bay, would have impaired our national jurisdiction over those\r\nwaters. Senator Frye of Maine took the lead in a rub-a-dub agitation in\r\nthe presence of which some Democratic Senators showed marked timidity.\r\nThe administration of public services by congressional committees has\r\nthe incurable defect that it reflects the particular interests and\r\nattachments of the committeemen. Presidential administration is\r\nso circumstanced that it tends to be nationally minded; committee\r\nadministration, just as naturally, tends to be locally minded. Hence,\r\nSenator Frye was able to report from the committee on foreign relations\r\na resolution declaring that a commission \"charged with the consideration\r\nand settlement of the fishery rights... ought not to be provided for by\r\nCongress.\" Such was the attitude of the Senate towards the President\r\non this question, that on April 13, 1886, this arrogant resolution was\r\nadopted by thirty-five ayes to 10 nays. A group of Eastern Democrats who\r\nwere in a position to be affected by the longshore vote, joined with the\r\nRepublicans in voting for the resolution, and among them Senator Gorman\r\nof Maryland, national chairman of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  See \"The Path of Empire,\" by Carl Russell Fish (in \"The\r\nChronicles of America\").\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland was no more affected by this Senate resolution than\r\nhe had been by their other resolutions attacking his authority. He went\r\nahead with his negotiations and concluded treaty arrangements which the\r\nSenate, of course, rejected; but, as that result had been anticipated,\r\na modus vivendi which had been arranged by executive agreements between\r\nthe two countries went into effect, regardless of the Senate's\r\nattitude. The case is a signal instance of the substitution of executive\r\narrangements for treaty engagements which has since then been such a\r\nmarked tendency in the conduct of the foreign relations of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA consideration which worked steadily against the Senate in its attacks\r\nupon the President, was the prevalent belief that the Tenure of Office\r\nAct was unconstitutional in its nature and mischievous in its effects.\r\nAlthough Senator Edmunds had been able to obtain a show of solid party\r\nsupport, it eventually became known that he stood almost alone in\r\nthe Judiciary Committee in his approval of that act. The case is an\r\ninstructive revelation of the arbitrary power conferred by the committee\r\nsystem. Members are loath to antagonize a party chairman to whom their\r\nown bills must go for approval. Finally, Senator Hoar dared to take\r\nthe risk, and with such success that on June 21, 1886, the committee\r\nreported a bill for the complete repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, the\r\nchairman--Senator Edmunds--alone dissenting. When the bill was taken up\r\nfor consideration, Senator Hoar remarked that he did not believe there\r\nwere five members of the Senate who really believed in the propriety of\r\nthat act. \"It did not seem to me to be quite becoming,\" he explained,\r\n\"to ask the Senate to deal with this general question, while the\r\nquestion which arose between the President and the Senate as to the\r\ninterpretation and administration of the existing law was pending. I\r\nthought, as a party man, that I had hardly the right to interfere with\r\nthe matter which was under the special charge of my honorable friend\r\nfrom Vermont, by challenging a debate upon the general subject from a\r\ndifferent point of view.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough delicately put, this statement was in effect a repudiation of\r\nthe party leadership of Edmunds and in the debate which ensued, not\r\na single Senator came to his support. He stood alone in upholding\r\nthe propriety of the Tenure of Office Act, arguing that without its\r\nrestraint \"the whole real power and patronage of this government was\r\nvested solely in the hands of a President of the United States and\r\nhis will was the law.\" He held that the consent of the Senate to\r\nappointments was an insufficient check if the President were allowed to\r\nremove at his own will and pleasure. He was answered by his own party\r\ncolleagues and committee associates, Hoar and Evarts. Senator Hoar went\r\nso far as to say that in his opinion there was not a single person in\r\nthis country, in Congress or out of Congress, with the exception of the\r\nSenator from Vermont, who did not believe that a necessary step towards\r\nreform \"must be to impose the responsibility of the Civil Service\r\nupon the Executive.\" Senator Evarts argued that the existing law was\r\nincompatible with executive responsibility, for \"it placed the Executive\r\npower in a strait-jacket.\" He then pointed out that the President had\r\nnot the legal right to remove a member of his own Cabinet and asked, \"Is\r\nnot the President imprisoned if his Cabinet are to be his masters by\r\nthe will of the Senate?\" The debate was almost wholly confined to the\r\nRepublican side of the Senate, for only one Democrat took any part in\r\nit. Senator Edmunds was the sole spokesman on his side, but he fought\r\nhard against defeat and delivered several elaborate arguments of the\r\n\"check and balance\" type. When the final vote took place, only three\r\nRepublicans actually voted for the repealing bill, but there were\r\nabsentees whose votes would have been cast the same way had they been\r\nneeded to pass the bill.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The bill was passed by thirty yeas and twenty-two nays, and\r\namong the nays were several Senators who while members of the House had\r\nvoted for repeal. The repeal bill passed the House by a vote of 172 to\r\n67, and became law on March 3, 1887\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland had achieved a brilliant victory. In the joust\r\nbetween him and Edmunds, in lists of his adversary's own contriving,\r\nhe had held victoriously to his course while his opponent had been\r\nunhorsed. The granite composure of Senator Edmunds' habitual mien did\r\nnot permit any sign of disturbance to break through, but his position in\r\nthe Senate was never again what it had been, and eventually he resigned\r\nhis seat before the expiration of his term. He retired from public life\r\nin 1891, at the age of sixty-three.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the public welfare, it is to be noted that\r\nthe issue turned on the maintenance of privilege rather than on the\r\ndischarge of responsibility. President Cleveland contended that he was\r\nnot responsible to the Senate but to the people for the way in which he\r\nexercised his trusteeship. But the phrase \"the people\" is an abstraction\r\nwhich has no force save as it receives concrete form in appropriate\r\ninstitutions. It is the essential characteristic of a sound\r\nconstitutional system that it supplies such institutions, so as to\r\nput executive authority on its good behavior by steady pressure of\r\nresponsibility through full publicity and detailed criticism. This\r\nresult, the Senate fails to secure because it keeps trying to invade\r\nexecutive authority, and to seize the appointing power instead of\r\nseeking to enforce executive responsibility. This point was forcibly\r\nput by \"The Nation\" when it said: \"There is only one way of securing\r\nthe presentation to the Senate of all the papers and documents which\r\ninfluence the President in making either removals or appointments, and\r\nthat is a simple way, and one wholly within the reach of the Senators.\r\nThey have only to alter their rules, and make executive sessions as\r\npublic as legislative sessions, in order to drive the President not only\r\ninto making no nominations for which he cannot give creditable reasons,\r\nbut into furnishing every creditable reason for the nomination which he\r\nmay have in his possession.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  \"The Nation,\" March 11, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the struggle, an effort was made to bring about this very reform,\r\nunder the lead of a Republican Senator, Orville H. Platt of Connecticut.\r\nOn April 13, 1886, he delivered a carefully prepared speech, based upon\r\nmuch research, in which he showed that the rule of secrecy in executive\r\nsessions could not claim the sanction of the founders of the government.\r\nIt is true that the Senate originally sat with closed doors for all\r\nsorts of business, but it discontinued the practice after a few years.\r\nIt was not until 1800, six years after the practice of public sessions\r\nhad been adopted, that any rule of secrecy was applied to business\r\ntransacted in executive sessions. Senator Platt's motion to repeal\r\nthis rule met with determined opposition on both sides of the chamber,\r\ncoupled with an indisposition to discuss the matter. When it came up for\r\nconsideration on the 15th of December, Senator Hoar moved to lay it on\r\nthe table, which was done by a vote of thirty-three to twenty-one. Such\r\nprominent Democratic leaders as Gorman of Maryland and Vest of Missouri\r\nvoted with Republican leaders like Evarts, Edmunds, Allison, and\r\nHarrison, in favor of Hoar's motion, while Hoar's own colleague, Senator\r\nDawes, together with such eminent Republicans as Frye of Maine, Hawley\r\nof Connecticut, and Sherman of Ohio voted with Platt. Thus, any party\r\nresponsibility for the result was successfully avoided, and an issue of\r\ngreat constitutional importance was laid away without any apparent stir\r\nof popular sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. PARTY POLICY IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nWhile President Cleveland was successfully asserting his executive\r\nauthority, the House of Representatives, too, was trying to assert its\r\nauthority; but its choice of means was such that it was badly beaten and\r\nwas reduced to a state of humble subordination from which it has never\r\nemerged. Its traditional procedure was arranged on the theory that\r\nCongress ought to propose as well as to enact legislation, and to\r\nreceive recommendations from all quarters without preference or\r\ndiscrimination. Although the Constitution makes it the right and duty of\r\nthe President to \"recommend to their consideration such measures as\r\nhe shall judge necessary and expedient,\" measures proposed by the\r\nAdministration stand on the same footing under the rules as those\r\nproposed by the humblest citizen of the United States. In both cases,\r\nthey are allowed to reach Congress only in the form of a bill or\r\nresolution introduced by a member of Congress, and they go on the files\r\nwithout any distinction as to rank and position except such as pertains\r\nto them from the time and order in which they are introduced. Under\r\nthe rules, all measures are distributed among numerous committees, each\r\nhaving charge of a particular class, with power to report favorably\r\nor adversely. Each committee is constituted as a section of the whole\r\nHouse, with a distribution of party representation corresponding to that\r\nwhich exists in the House.\r\n\r\nViewed as an ideal polity, the scheme has attractive features. In\r\npractice, however, it is attended with great disadvantages. Although the\r\nsystem was originally introduced with the idea that it would give the\r\nHouse of Representatives control over legislative business, the actual\r\nresult has been to reduce this body to an impotence unparalleled among\r\nnational representative assemblies in countries having constitutional\r\ngovernment. In a speech delivered on December 10, 1885, William M.\r\nSpringer of Illinois complained: \"We find ourselves bound hand and foot,\r\nthe majority delivering themselves over to the power of the minority\r\nthat might oppose any particular measures, so that nothing could be done\r\nin the way of legislation except by unanimous consent or by a two-thirds\r\nvote.\" As an instance of legislative paralysis, he related that\r\n\"during the last Congress a very important bill, that providing for the\r\npresidential succession... was reported from a committee of which I had\r\nthe honor to be a member, and was placed on the calendar of the House on\r\nthe 21st day of April, 1884; and that bill, which was favored by nearly\r\nthe entire House, was permitted to die on the calendar because there\r\nnever was a moment, when under the rules as they then existed, the bill\r\ncould be reached and passed by the House.\" During the whole of that\r\nsession of Congress, the regular calendar was never reached. \"Owing\r\nto the fact that we could not transact business under the rules, all\r\nbusiness was done under unanimous consent or under propositions\r\nto suspend the rules upon the two Mondays in each month on which\r\nsuspensions were allowed.\" As a two-thirds majority was necessary to\r\nsuspend the rules, any considerable minority had a veto power.\r\n\r\nThe standing committees, whose ostensible purpose was to prepare\r\nbusiness for consideration, were characterized as legislative\r\ncemeteries. Charles B. Lore of Delaware, referring to the situation\r\nduring the previous session, said: \"The committees were formed, they\r\nmet in their respective committee rooms day after day, week after week,\r\nworking up the business which was committed to them by this House, and\r\nthey reported to this House 8290 bills. They came from the respective\r\ncommittees, and they were consigned to the calendars of this House,\r\nwhich became for them the tomb of the Capulets; most of them were never\r\nheard of afterward. From the Senate there were 2700 bills.... Nine\r\ntenths of the time of the committees of the Forty-eighth Congress was\r\nwasted. We met week after week, month after month, and labored over the\r\ncases prepared, and reported bills to the House. They were put upon the\r\ncalendars and there were buried, to be brought in again and again in\r\nsucceeding Congresses.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Kelley of Pennsylvania bluntly declared: \"No legislation\r\ncan be effectually originated outside the Committee on Appropriations,\r\nunless it be a bill which will command unanimous consent or a stray bill\r\nthat may get a two-thirds vote, or a pension bill.\" He explained that\r\nhe excepted pension bills \"because we have for several years by special\r\norder remitted the whole subject of pensions to a committee who bring in\r\ntheir bills at sessions held one night in each week, when ten or fifteen\r\ngentlemen decide what soldiers may have pensions and what soldiers may\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party found this situation extremely irritating when it\r\ncame into power in the House. It was unable to do anything of importance\r\nor even to define its own party policy, and in the session of Congress\r\nbeginning in December, 1885, it sought to correct the situation by\r\namending the rules. In this undertaking it had sympathy and support\r\non the Republican side. The duress under which the House labored was\r\npungently described by Thomas B. Reed, who was just about that time\r\nrevealing the ability that gained for him the Republican leadership.\r\nIn a speech, delivered on December 16, 1885, he declared: \"For the last\r\nthree Congresses the representatives of the people of the United\r\nStates have been in irons. They have been allowed to transact no public\r\nbusiness except at the dictation and by the permission of a small\r\ncoterie of gentlemen, who, while they possessed individually more\r\nwisdom than any of the rest of us, did not possess all the wisdom in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe coterie alluded to by Mr. Reed was that which controlled the\r\ncommittee on appropriations. Under the system created by the rules of\r\nthe House, bills pour in by tens of thousands. A member of the House, of\r\na statistical turn of mind, once submitted figures to the House showing\r\nthat it would take over sixty-six years to go through the calendars of\r\none session in regular order, allowing an average of one minute for each\r\nmember to debate each bill. To get anything done, the House must proceed\r\nby special order, and as it is essential to pass the appropriations to\r\nkeep up the government, a precedence was allowed to business reported\r\nby that committee which in effect gave it a position of mastery. O. R.\r\nSingleton of Mississippi, in the course of the same debate, declared\r\nthat there was a \"grievance which towers above all others as the Alps\r\ntower above the surrounding hills. It is the power resting with said\r\ncommittee, and oftentimes employed by it, to arrest any legislation\r\nupon any subject which does not meet its approval. A motion to go into\r\ncommittee of the whole to consider appropriation bills is always in\r\norder, and takes precedence of all other motions as to the order of\r\nbusiness.\" The practical effect of the rules was that, instead of\r\nremaining the servant of the House, the committee became its master. Not\r\nonly could the committee shut off from any consideration any measure to\r\nwhich it was opposed, but it could also dictate to the House the\r\nshape in which its own bills should be enacted. While the form of full\r\nconsideration and amendment is preserved, the terms of a bill are\r\nreally decided by a conference committee appointed to adjust differences\r\nbetween the House and the Senate. John H. Reagan of Texas stated that\r\n\"a conference committee, made up of three members of the appropriations\r\ncommittee, acting in conjunction with a similar conference committee\r\non the part of the Senate, does substantially our legislation upon this\r\nsubject of appropriations.\" In theory, the House was free to accept or\r\nreject the conference committee's report. Practically the choice lay\r\nbetween the bill as fixed by the conference committee or no bill at all\r\nduring that session. Mr. Reagan stated the case exactly when he said\r\nthat it meant \"letting six men settle what the terms are to be,\r\nbeyond our power of control, unless we consent to a called session of\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nTo deal with this situation, the House had refused to adopt the rules of\r\nthe preceding Congress; and after electing John G. Carlisle as Speaker\r\nand authorizing the appointment of a committee on rules, it deferred the\r\nappointment of the usual legislative committees until after a new set\r\nof rules had been adopted. The action of the Speaker in constituting the\r\nRules Committee was scrupulously fair to the contending interests. It\r\nconsisted of himself, Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, and William\r\nR. Morrison of Illinois from the Democratic side of the House; and\r\nof Thomas B. Reed of Maine and Frank Hiscock of New York from the\r\nRepublican side. On the 14th of December, the committee made two\r\nreports: a majority report presented by Mr. Morrison and a minority\r\nreport presented by Mr. Randall and signed by him alone.\r\n\r\nThese reports and the debates which followed are most disappointing.\r\nWhat was needed was a penetrating discussion of the means by which\r\nthe House could establish its authority and perform its constitutional\r\nfunctions. But it is a remarkable circumstance that at no time was any\r\nreference made to the only way in which the House can regain freedom of\r\naction--namely, by having the Administration submit its budget demands\r\nand its legislative proposals directly to the committee of the whole\r\nHouse. The preparatory stages could then be completed before the opening\r\nof the legislative session. Congress would thus save the months of time\r\nthat are now consumed in committee incubation and would almost\r\ncertainly be assured of opportunity of considering the public business.\r\nDiscrimination in legislative privilege among members of the House would\r\nthen be abolished, for every member would belong to the committee on\r\nappropriations. It is universally true in constitutional governments\r\nthat power over appropriations involves power over legislation, and the\r\nonly possibility of a square deal is to open that power to the entire\r\nmembership of the assembly, which is the regular practice in Switzerland\r\nand in all English commonwealths. The House could not have been ignorant\r\nof the existence of this alternative, for the whole subject had been\r\nluminously discussed in the Senate Report of February 4, 1881. It was,\r\ntherein, clearly pointed out that such an arrangement would prevent\r\nparalysis or inaction in Congress. With the Administration proposing\r\nits measures directly to Congress, discussion of them and decisions upon\r\nthem could not be avoided.\r\n\r\nBut such a public forum could not be established without sweeping away\r\nmany intrenchments of factional interest and private opportunity, and\r\nthis was not at all the purpose of the committee on rules. It took its\r\ncharacter and direction from an old feud between Morrison and Randall.\r\nMorrison, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 1876, had\r\nreported a tariff reform measure which was defeated by Randall's\r\ninfluence. Then Randall, who had succeeded to the Speakership,\r\ntransferred Morrison from the chairmanship of the Ways and Means\r\nCommittee to the chairmanship of the committee on public lands. But\r\nMorrison was a man who would not submit to defeat. He was a veteran of\r\nthe Civil War, and had been severely wounded in leading his regiment at\r\nFort Donelson. After the war, he figured in Illinois politics and served\r\nas Speaker of the State Legislature. He entered Congress in 1873 and\r\ndevoted himself to the study of the tariff with such intelligence and\r\nthoroughness that his speeches are still an indispensable part of the\r\nhistory of tariff legislation. His habitual manner was so mild\r\nand unassuming that it gave little indication of the force of his\r\npersonality, which was full of energy and perseverance.\r\n\r\nRandall was more imperious in his mien. He was a party leader of\r\nestablished renown which he had gained in the struggles over force bills\r\nat the close of the reconstruction period. His position on the tariff\r\nwas that of a Pennsylvania protectionist, and upon the tariff reform\r\nissue in 1883, he was defeated for the Speakership. At that time, John\r\nG. Carlisle of Kentucky was raised to that post, while Morrison again\r\nbecame chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. But Randall, now\r\nappointed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, had so great an\r\ninfluence that he was able to turn about forty Democratic votes against\r\nthe tariff bill reported by the Ways and Means Committee, thus enabling\r\nthe Republicans to kill the bill by striking out the enacting clause.\r\n\r\nOnly this practical aim, then, was in view in the reports presented by\r\nthe committee on rules. The principal feature of the majority report was\r\na proposal to curtail the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee\r\nby transferring to other committees five of the eleven regular\r\nappropriation bills. What, from the constitutional point of view, would\r\nappear to be the main question--the recovery by the House of its freedom\r\nof action--was hardly noticed in the report or in the debates which\r\nfollowed. Heretofore, the rules had allotted certain periods to general\r\nbusiness; now, the majority report somewhat enlarged these periods and\r\nstipulated that no committee should bring more than one proposal before\r\nthe House until all other committees had had their turn. This provision\r\nmight have been somewhat more effective had it been accompanied by a\r\nrevision of the list of committees such as was proposed by William M.\r\nSpringer. He pointed out that there were a number of committees \"that\r\nhave no business to transact or business so trifling and unimportant as\r\nto make it unnecessary to have standing committees upon such subjects\";\r\nhe proposed to abolish twenty-one of these committees and to create four\r\nnew ones to take their place; he showed that \"if we allow these twenty\r\nuseless committees to be again put on our list, to be called regularly\r\nin the morning hour... forty-two days will be consumed in calling these\r\ncommittees\"; and, finally, he pointed out that the change would effect a\r\nsaving since it would \"do away with sixteen committee clerkships.\"\r\n\r\nThis saving was, in fact, fatal to the success of Springer's proposal,\r\nsince it meant the extinction of so many sinecures bestowed through\r\ncongressional favor. In the end, Springer reduced his proposed change to\r\nthe creation of one general committee on public expenditures to take the\r\nplace of eight committees on departmental expenditures. It was notorious\r\nthat such committees did nothing and could do nothing, and their\r\nfutility, save as dispensers of patronage, had been demonstrated in a\r\nstartling manner by the effect of the Acts of July 12, 1870, and June\r\n20, 1874, requiring all unused appropriations to be paid into the\r\nTreasury. The amounts thus turned into the Treasury aggregated\r\n$174,000,000 and in a single bureau there was an unexpended balance of\r\n$36,000,000, which had accumulated for a quarter of a century because\r\nCongress had not been advised that no appropriation was needed. Mr.\r\nSpringer remarked that, during the ten years in which he had been a\r\nmember of Congress, he had observed with regard to these committees\r\n\"that in nearly all cases, after their appointment, organization, and\r\nthe election of a clerk, the committee practically ceased to exist, and\r\nnothing further is done.\" William R. Morrison at once came to the\r\nrescue of the endangered sinecures and argued that even although these\r\ncommittees had been inactive in the past they \"constituted the eyes, the\r\nears, and the hands of the House.\" In consequence, after a short debate\r\nMr. Springer's motion was rejected without a division.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements subsequently made to provide time and opportunity\r\nfor general legislation, turned out in practice to be quite futile and\r\nindeed they were never more than a mere formal pretense. It was quite\r\nobvious, therefore, that the new rules tended only to make the situation\r\nworse than before. Thomas Ryan of Kansas told the plain truth when he\r\nsaid: \"You do not propose to remedy any of those things of which you\r\ncomplain by any of the rules you have brought forward. You propose to\r\nclothe eight committees with the same power, with the same temptation\r\nand capacity to abuse it. You multiply eightfold the very evils of which\r\nyou complain.\" James H. Blount of Georgia sought to mitigate the\r\nevils of the situation by giving a number of other committees the same\r\nprivilege as the appropriation committees, but this proposal at once\r\nraised a storm, for appropriation committees had leave to report at any\r\ntime, and to extend the privilege would prevent expeditious handling\r\nof appropriation bills. Mr. Blount's motion was, therefore, voted down\r\nwithout a division.\r\n\r\nWhile in the debate, the pretense of facilitating routine business was\r\nordinarily kept up; occasional intimations of actual ulterior purpose\r\nleaked out, as when John B. Storm of Pennsylvania remarked that it was a\r\nvaluable feature of the rules that they did hamper action and \"that\r\nthe country which is least governed is the best governed, is a maxim in\r\nstrict accord with the idea of true civil liberty.\" William McKinley was\r\nalso of the opinion that barriers were needed \"against the wild projects\r\nand visionary schemes which will find advocates in this House.\" Some\r\nyears later, when the subject was again up for discussion, Thomas B.\r\nReed went to the heart of the situation when he declared that the rules\r\nhad been devised not to facilitate action but to obstruct it, for \"the\r\nwhole system of business here for years has been to seek methods of\r\nshirking, not of meeting, the questions which the people present for\r\nthe consideration of their representatives. Peculiar circumstances\r\nhave caused this. For a long time, one section of the country largely\r\ndominated the other. That section of the country was constantly\r\napprehensive of danger which might happen at any time by reason of an\r\ninstitution it was maintaining. Very naturally, all the rules of the\r\nHouse were bent for the obstruction of action on the part of Congress.\"\r\nIt may be added that these observations apply even more forcibly, to\r\nthe rules of the Senate. The privilege of unrestricted debate was not\r\noriginally granted by those rules but was introduced as a means\r\nof strengthening the power of sectional resistance to obnoxious\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe revision of the rules in 1885, then, was not designed really to\r\nfacilitate action by the House, but rather to effect a transfer of the\r\npower to rule the House. It was at least clear that under the proposed\r\nchanges the chairman of the committee on appropriations would no longer\r\nretain such complete mastery as Randall had wielded, and this was enough\r\nto insure the adoption of the majority report. The minority report\r\nopposed this weakening of control on the ground that it would be\r\ndestructive of orderly and responsible management of the public funds.\r\nEverything which Randall said on that point has since been amply\r\nconfirmed by much sad experience. Although some leading Republicans,\r\namong whom was Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois, argued strongly in support\r\nof Randall's views, the temper of the House was such that the majority\r\nin favor of the change was overwhelming, and on December 18, 1885, the\r\nMorrison plan was finally adopted without a roll call.\r\n\r\nThe hope that the change in organization would expedite action on\r\nappropriation bills, was promptly disappointed. Only one of the fourteen\r\nregular appropriation bills became law before the last day of the fiscal\r\nyear. The duress to which the House was subject became tighter and\r\nharder than before, and the Speakership entered upon a development\r\nunparalleled in constitutional history. The Speaker was practically in a\r\nposition to determine what business the House might consider and what it\r\nmight not, and the circumstances were such as to breed a belief that it\r\nwas his duty to use his discretion where a choice presented itself. It\r\nis obvious that, when on the floor of the House there are a number of\r\napplicants for recognition, the Speaker must choose between them. All\r\ncannot be allowed to speak at once. There is no chance to apply the shop\r\nrule, \"first come first served,\" for numerous applications for the floor\r\ncome at the same time. Shall the Speaker choose at random or according\r\nto some definite principle of selection? In view of the Speaker's\r\ninterest in the welfare of the party which raised him to the office, he\r\nwould naturally inquire in advance the purpose for which the recognition\r\nof the chair was desired. It was a manifest step towards orderly\r\nprocedure in session, however, when instead of crowding around the\r\nclerk's desk bawling for recognition, members applied to the Speaker in\r\nadvance. In Speaker Blaine's time, this had become a regular practice\r\nand ever since then, a throng of members at the Speaker's office trying\r\nto arrange with him for recognition has been a daily occurrence during\r\na legislative session. Samuel W. McCall, in his work on \"The Business of\r\nCongress,\" says that the Speaker \"usually scrutinizes the bill and the\r\ncommittee's report upon it, and in case of doubt he sometimes refers\r\nthem to a member in whom he has confidence, for a more careful\r\nexamination than he himself has time to give.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Speaker Carlisle, this power to censor proposals was made\r\nconspicuous through the factional war in the Democratic party. For\r\nseveral sessions of Congress, a bill had been pending to repeal the\r\ninternal revenue taxes upon tobacco, and it had such support that it\r\nmight have passed if it could have been reached for consideration. On\r\nFebruary 5, 1887, a letter was addressed to Speaker Carlisle by three\r\nprominent Democrats: Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, George D. Wise\r\nof Virginia, and John S. Henderson of North Carolina, saying: \"At the\r\ninstance of many Democratic members of the House, we appeal to you\r\nearnestly to recognize on Monday next, some Democrat who will move to\r\nsuspend the rules for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity\r\nof considering the question of the total repeal of the internal revenue\r\ntaxes on tobacco.\" The letter went on to argue that it would be bad\r\npolicy to let a Republican have credit for a proposal, which it was\r\ndeclared \"will command more votes than any other measure pending before\r\nthe House looking towards a reduction in taxation; and favorable action\r\non this proposition will not interfere with other efforts that are being\r\nmade to reduce the burden of the people.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaker Carlisle, however, refused to allow the House to consider the\r\nmatter on the ground that negotiations with Randall and his friends for\r\nconcerted party action had so far been fruitless. \"Among other things,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"we proposed to submit the entire subject to a caucus of our\r\npolitical friends, with the understanding that all parties would abide\r\nby the result of its action.... We have received no response to that\r\ncommunication, and I consider that it would not be proper under the\r\ncircumstances for me to agree to a course of action which would present\r\nto the House a simple proposition for the repeal of the internal revenue\r\ntax on tobacco, snuff and cigars, to the exclusion of all other measures\r\nfor the reduction of taxation.\" The letter closed by \"sincerely hoping\r\nthat some plan may yet be devised which will enable the House to\r\nconsider the whole subject of revenue reduction.\"\r\n\r\nNo one was less of an autocrat in temper and habit of thought than\r\nSpeaker Carlisle, and he assumed this position in deference to\r\na recognized function of his office, supported by a long line of\r\nprecedents. The case was, therefore, a signal illustration of the way\r\nin which the House has impaired its ability to consider legislation by\r\nclaiming the exclusive privilege of proposing legislation. If the rules\r\nhad allowed the President to propose his measures directly to the House,\r\nthen the way would have been opened for a substitute or an amendment. As\r\nit was, the House was able to act only upon matters within the control\r\nof a few persons advantageously posted, and none of the changes of rules\r\nthat have been made from time to time have seriously disturbed this\r\nfundamental situation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the new rules adopted in December, 1885, nothing of\r\nimportance was accomplished by the House. On February 15, 1886, William\r\nR. Morrison introduced a tariff bill making a moderate reduction in\r\nrates of duty, which, after considerable amendment in the committee of\r\nways and means, was reported to the House on the 12th of April; but no\r\nfurther action was taken until the 17th of June, when Morrison moved\r\nthat the House go into committee of the whole to consider the bill.\r\nThirty-five Democrats voted with the Republicans against the motion,\r\nwhich was defeated by 157 nays to 140 yeas. No further attempt was\r\nmade to take up the bill during that session, and in the ensuing fall\r\nMorrison was defeated as a candidate for reelection. Before leaving\r\nCongress he tried once more to obtain consideration of his bill but in\r\nvain. Just as that Congress was expiring, John S. Henderson of North\r\nCarolina was at last allowed to move a suspension of the rules in order\r\nto take a vote on a bill to reduce internal revenue taxes, but he failed\r\nto obtain the two-thirds vote required for suspension of the rules.\r\n\r\nThat the proceedings of the Forty-ninth Congress were not entirely\r\nfruitless, was mainly due to the initiative and address of the Senate.\r\nSome important measures were thus pushed through, among them the\r\nact regulating the presidential succession and the act creating the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. The first of these provided for the\r\nsuccession of the heads of departments in turn, in case of the\r\nremoval, death, resignation, or inability of both the President and the\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nThe most marked legislative achievement of the House was an act\r\nregulating the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine, to which\r\nthe Senate assented with some amendment, and which was signed with\r\nreluctance by the President, after a special message to the House\r\nsharply criticizing some of the provisions of the act. A bill providing\r\nfor arbitration of differences between common carriers and their\r\nemployees was passed by the Senate without a division, but it did not\r\nreach the President until the closing days of the session and failed of\r\nenactment because he did not sign it before the final adjournment. Taken\r\nas a whole, then, the record of the Congress elected in 1884 showed\r\nthat while the Democratic party had the Presidency and the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the Republican party, although defeated at the polls,\r\nstill controlled public policy through the agency of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. PRESIDENTIAL KNIGHT-ERRANTRY\r\n\r\nAlthough President Cleveland decisively repelled the Senate's attempted\r\ninvasion of the power of removal belonging to his office, he was still\r\nleft in a deplorable state of servitude through the operation of old\r\nlaws based upon the principle of rotation in office. The Acts of 1820\r\nand 1836, limiting commissions to the term of four years, forced him\r\nto make numerous appointments which provoked controversy and made\r\nlarge demands upon his time and thought. In the first year of his\r\nadministration, he sent about two thousand nominations to the Senate,\r\nan average of over six a day, assuming that he was allowed to rest on\r\nSunday. His freedom of action was further curtailed by an Act of 1863,\r\nprohibiting the payment of a salary to any person appointed to fill a\r\nvacancy existing while the Senate was in session, until the appointment\r\nhad been confirmed by the Senate. The President was thus placed under a\r\nstrict compulsion to act as a party employment agent.\r\n\r\nIf it is the prime duty of a President to act in the spirit of a\r\nreformer, Cleveland is entitled to high praise for the stanchness with\r\nwhich he adhered to his principles under most trying circumstances. Upon\r\nNovember 27, 1885, he approved rules confirming and extending the civil\r\nservice regulations. Charges that Collector Hedden of the New York\r\nCustoms House was violating the spirit of the Civil Service Act, and\r\nwas making a party machine of his office, caused the Civil Service\r\nCommission to make an investigation which resulted in his resignation\r\nin July, 1886. On the 10th of August, Daniel Magone of Ogdensburg, New\r\nYork, a widely known lawyer, was personally chosen by the President with\r\na view to enforcing the civil service law in the New York Customs House.\r\nBefore making this appointment, President Cleveland issued an order to\r\nall heads of departments warning all officeholders against the use of\r\ntheir positions to control political movements in their localities.\r\n\"Officeholders,\" he declared, \"are the agents of the people, not their\r\nmasters. They have no right, as officeholders, to dictate the political\r\naction of their associates, or to throttle freedom of action within\r\nparty lines by methods and practices which prevent every useful and\r\njustifiable purpose of party organization.\" In August, President\r\nCleveland gave signal evidence of his devotion to civil service reform\r\nby appointing a Republican, because of his special qualifications, to be\r\nchief examiner for the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nDemocratic party workers were so angered and disgusted by the\r\nPresident's policy that any mention of his name was enough to start a\r\nflow of coarse denunciation. Strong hostility to his course of action\r\nwas manifested in Congress. Chairman Randall, of the committee on\r\nappropriations, threatened to cut off the appropriation for office room\r\nfor the commission. A \"rider\" to the legislative appropriation bill,\r\nstriking at the civil service law, caused a vigorous debate in the House\r\nin which leading Democrats assailed the Administration, but eventually\r\nthe \"rider\" was ruled out on a point of order. In the Senate, such party\r\nleaders as Vance of North Carolina, Saulsbury of Delaware, and Voorhees\r\nof Indiana, openly ridiculed the civil service law, and various attempts\r\nto cripple it were made but were defeated. Senator Vance introduced a\r\nbill to repeal the law, but it was indefinitely postponed by a vote of\r\n33 to 6, the affirmative vote being cast mainly by Republicans; and in\r\ngeneral the strongest support for the law now came from the Republican\r\nside. Early in June, 1887, an estimate was made that nine thousand civil\r\noffices outside the scope of the civil service rules were still held by\r\nRepublicans. The Republican party press gloated over the situation and\r\nwas fond of dwelling upon the way in which old-line Democrats were being\r\nsnubbed while the Mugwumps were favored. At the same time, civil\r\nservice reformers found much to condemn in the character of Cleveland's\r\nappointments. A special committee of the National Civil Service Reform\r\nLeague, on March 30, 1887, published a report in which they asserted\r\nthat, \"tried by the standard of absolute fidelity to the reform as it\r\nis understood by this League, it is not to be denied that this\r\nAdministration has left much to be desired.\" At a subsequent session of\r\nthe League, its President, George William Curtis, proclaimed that the\r\nLeague did not regard the Administration as \"in any strict sense of\r\nthe words a civil service reform administration.\" Thus while President\r\nCleveland was alienating his regular party support, he was not getting\r\nin return any dependable support from the reformers. He seemed to be\r\nsitting down between two stools, both tilting to let him fall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he went on imperturbably doing his duty as he saw it. Like\r\nmany of his predecessors, he would rise early to get some time to attend\r\nto public business before the rush of office seekers began, but the bulk\r\nof his day's work lay in the discharge of his compulsory duties as an\r\nemployment agent. Many difficult situations were created by contentions\r\namong Congressmen over appointments. It was Cleveland's habit to\r\ndeal with these cases by homely expostulation and by pleas for mutual\r\nconcessions. Such incidents do not of course go upon record, and it is\r\nonly as memoirs and reminiscences of public men are published that this\r\npersonal side of history becomes known. Senator Cullom of Illinois in\r\nhis \"Fifty Years of Public Service\" gives an account that doubtless\r\nfairly displays Cleveland's way of handling his vexatious problems. \"I\r\nhappened to be at the White House one day, and Mr. Cleveland said to\r\nme, 'I wish you would take up Lamar's nomination and dispose of it. I am\r\nbetween hay and grass with reference to the Interior Department. Nothing\r\nis being done there; I ought to have some one on duty, and I cannot do\r\nanything until you dispose of Lamar.'\" Mr. Lamar, who had entered\r\nthe Cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, was nominated for associate\r\njustice of the Supreme Court on December 6, 1887. He had been an eminent\r\nmember of the Senate, with previous distinguished service in the House,\r\nso that the Senate must have had abundant knowledge of his character\r\nand attainments. It is impossible to assign the delay that ensued\r\nto reasonable need of time for inquiry as to his qualifications, but\r\nSenator Cullom relates that \"the nomination pended before the Judiciary\r\nCommittee for a long time.\" Soon after the personal appeal, which\r\nwas made by the President to every Senator he could reach, action was\r\nfinally taken and the appointment was confirmed January 16, 1888.\r\n\r\nSenator Cullom's reminiscences also throw light upon the process by\r\nwhich judges are appointed. President Cleveland had selected Melville W.\r\nFuller of Illinois for the office of chief justice of the Supreme Court.\r\nAccording to Senator Cullom, Senator Edmunds \"was very much out of humor\r\nwith the President because he had fully expected that Judge Phelps, of\r\nhis own State, was to receive the honor.... The result was that Senator\r\nEdmunds held the nomination, without any action, in the Judiciary\r\nCommittee for some three months.\" Senator Cullom, although a party\r\nassociate of Edmunds, was pleased that the President had selected an\r\nIllinois jurist and he was determined that, if he could help it, Edmunds\r\nshould not have the New Hampshire candidate appointed. He therefore\r\nappealed to the committee to do something about the nomination, either\r\none way or the other. The committee finally reported the nomination to\r\nthe Senate without recommendation. When the matter came up in executive\r\nsession, \"Senator Edmunds at once took the floor and attacked Judge\r\nFuller most viciously as having sympathized with the rebellion.\" But\r\nCullom was primed to meet that argument. He had been furnished with a\r\ncopy of a speech attacking President Lincoln which Phelps had delivered\r\nduring the war, and he now read it to the Senate, \"much to the chagrin\r\nand mortification of Senator Edmunds.\" Cullom relates that the Democrats\r\nin the Senate enjoyed the scene. \"Naturally, it appeared to them a very\r\nfunny performance, two Republicans quarreling over the confirmation of\r\na Democrat. They sat silent, however, and took no part at all in the\r\ndebate, leaving us Republicans to settle it among ourselves.\" The result\r\nof the Republican split was that the nomination of Fuller was confirmed\r\n\"by a substantial majority.\"\r\n\r\nAnother nomination which caused much agitation at the time was that of\r\nJames C. Matthews of New York, to be Recorder of Deeds in the District\r\nof Columbia. The office had been previously held by Frederick Douglass,\r\na distinguished leader of the colored race; and in filling the vacancy\r\nthe President believed it would be an exercise of wise and kindly\r\nconsideration to choose a member of the same race. But in the Washington\r\ncommunity, there was such a strong antipathy to the importation of\r\na negro politician from New York to fill a local office that a great\r\nclamor was raised, in which Democrats joined. The Senate rejected the\r\nnomination, but meanwhile Mr. Matthews had entered upon the duties of\r\nhis office and he showed such tact and ability as gradually to soften\r\nthe opposition. On December 21, 1886, President Cleveland renominated\r\nhim, pointing out that he had been in actual occupation of the office\r\nfor four months, managing its affairs with such ability as to remove\r\n\"much of the opposition to his appointment which has heretofore\r\nexisted.\" In conclusion, the President confessed \"a desire to cooperate\r\nin tendering to our colored fellow-citizens just recognition.\" This was\r\na shrewd argument. The Republican majority in the Senate shrank from\r\nwhat might seem to be drawing the color line, and the appointment was\r\neventually confirmed; but this did not remove the sense of grievance in\r\nWashington over the use of local offices for national party purposes.\r\nLocal sentiment in the District of Columbia is, however, politically\r\nunimportant, as the community has no means of positive action.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  It is a singular fact, which contains matter for deep\r\nconsideration, that the District of Columbia, the national capital,\r\nis the only populated area in the civilized world without any sort of\r\nsuffrage rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same month in which President Cleveland issued his memorable\r\nspecial message to the Senate on the Tenure of Office Act, he began\r\nanother struggle against congressional practice in which he was not\r\nso fortunate. On March 10, 1886, he sent to Congress the first of his\r\npension vetoes. Although liberal provision for granting pensions had\r\nbeen made by general laws, numerous special applications were made\r\ndirectly to Congress, and congressmen were solicited to secure favorable\r\nconsideration for them. That it was the duty of a representative to\r\nsupport an application from a resident of his district, was a doctrine\r\nenforced by claim agents with a pertinacity from which there was no\r\nescape. To attempt to assume a judicial attitude in the matter was\r\npolitically dangerous, and to yield assent was a matter of practical\r\nconvenience. Senator Cullom relates that when he first became a member\r\nof the committee on pensions he was \"a little uneasy\" lest he \"might\r\nbe too liberal.\" But he was guided by the advice of an old, experienced\r\nCongressman, Senator Sawyer of Wisconsin, who told him: \"You need not\r\nworry, you cannot very well make a mistake allowing liberal pensions to\r\nthe soldier boys. The money will get back into the Treasury very soon.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling that anything that the old soldiers wanted should be granted\r\nwas even stronger in the House, where about the only opportunity of\r\ndistinction allowed by the procedure was to champion these local demands\r\nupon the public treasury. It was indeed this privilege of passing\r\npension bills which partially reconciled members of the House to\r\nthe actual control of legislative opportunity by the Speaker and\r\nthe chairmen of a few dominating committees. It was a congressional\r\nperquisite to be allowed to move the passage of so many bills; enactment\r\nfollowed as a matter of course. President Cleveland made a pointed\r\nreference to this process in a veto message of June 21, 1886. He\r\nobserved that the pension bills had only \"an apparent Congressional\r\nsanction\" for the fact was that \"a large proportion of these bills have\r\nnever been submitted to a majority of either branch of Congress, but are\r\nthe results of nominal sessions held for the express purpose of their\r\nconsideration and attended by a small minority of the members of the\r\nrespective houses of the legislative branch of government.\"\r\n\r\nObviously, the whole system of pension legislation was faulty. Mere\r\nindividual effort on the part of the President to screen the output of\r\nthe system was scarcely practicable, even if it were congruous with\r\nthe nature of the President's own duties; but nevertheless Cleveland\r\nattempted it, and kept at it with stout perseverance. One of his veto\r\nmessages remarks that in a single day nearly 240 special pension bills\r\nwere presented to him. He referred them to the Pension Bureau for\r\nexamination and the labor involved was so great that they could not\r\nbe returned to him until within a few hours of the limit fixed by the\r\nConstitution for the President's assent.\r\n\r\nThere could be no more signal proof of President Cleveland's constancy\r\nof soul than the fact that he was working hard at his veto forge, with\r\nthe sparks falling thickly around, right in his honeymoon. He married\r\nMiss Frances Folsom of Buffalo on June 2, 1886. The ceremony took place\r\nin the White House, and immediately thereafter, the President and his\r\ncharming bride went to Deer Park, Maryland, a mountain resort. The\r\nrespite from official cares was brief; on June 8th, the couple returned\r\nto Washington and some of the most pugnacious of the pension vetoes\r\nwere sent to Congress soon after. The rest of his public life was passed\r\nunder continual storm, but the peace and happiness of his domestic life\r\nprovided a secure refuge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rebuffs which Democratic Congressmen received in\r\nthe matter of pension legislation were, it must be admitted, peculiarly\r\nexasperating. Reviewing the work of the Forty-ninth Congress, \"The\r\nNation\" mentioned three enactments which it characterized as great\r\nachievements that should be placed to the credit of Congress. Those were\r\nthe act regulating the presidential succession, approved January 18,\r\n1886; the act regulating the counting of the electoral votes, approved\r\nFebruary 3, 1887; and the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, approved\r\nMarch 3, 1887. But all three measures originated in the Senate, and\r\nthe main credit for their enactment might be claimed by the Republican\r\nparty. There was some ground for the statement that they would have\r\nbeen enacted sooner but for the disturbance of legislative routine by\r\npolitical upheavals in the House; and certainly no one could pretend\r\nthat it was to get these particular measures passed that the Democratic\r\nparty was raised to power. The main cause of the political revolution of\r\n1884 had been the continuance of war taxes, producing revenues that were\r\nnot only not needed but were positively embarrassing to the Government.\r\nPopular feeling over the matter was so strong that even the Republican\r\nparty had felt bound to put into its national platform, in 1884, a\r\npledge \"to correct the irregularities of the tariff and to reduce the\r\nsurplus.\" The people, however, believed that the Republican party had\r\nalready been given sufficient opportunity, and they now turned to\r\nthe Democratic party for relief. The rank and file of this party felt\r\nacutely, therefore, that they were not accomplishing what the people\r\nexpected. Members arrived in Washington full of good intentions. They\r\nfound themselves subject to a system which allowed them to introduce all\r\nthe bills they wanted, but not to obtain action upon them. Action\r\nwas the prerogative of a group of old hands who managed the important\r\ncommittees and who were divided among themselves on tariff policy. And\r\nnow, the little bills which, by dint of persuasion and bargaining, they\r\nhad first put through the committees, and then through both Houses of\r\nCongress, were cut down by executive veto, turning to their injury what\r\nthey had counted upon to help them in their districts.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, Democratic candidates had everywhere contended that\r\nthey were just as good friends of the old soldiers as the Republicans.\r\nNow, they felt that to make good this position they must do something to\r\noffset the effect of President Cleveland's vetoes. In his messages, he\r\nhad favored \"the most generous treatment to the disabled, aged and needy\r\namong our veterans\"; but he had argued that it should be done by general\r\nlaws, and not by special acts for the benefit of particular claimants.\r\nThe Pension Committee of the House responded by reporting a bill \"for\r\nthe relief of dependent parents and honorably discharged soldiers and\r\nsailors who are now disabled and dependent upon their own labor for\r\nsupport.\" It passed the House by a vote of 180 to 76, with 63 not\r\nvoting, and it passed the Senate without a division. On the 11th of\r\nFebruary, President Cleveland sent in his veto, accompanied by a message\r\npointing out in the language of the act defects and ambiguities which he\r\nbelieved would \"but put a further premium on dishonesty and mendacity.\"\r\nHe reiterated his desire that provision should be made \"for those who,\r\nhaving served their country long and well, are reduced to destitution\r\nand dependence,\" but he did not think that the bill was a proper means\r\nof attaining that object. On the 19th of February, the House committee\r\non pensions submitted an elaborate report on the veto in which they\r\nrecited the history of the bill and the reasons actuating the committee.\r\nExtracts from Cleveland's messages were quoted, and the committee\r\ndeclared that, in \"hearty accord with these views of the President and\r\nlargely in accordance with his suggestions, they framed a bill which\r\nthey then thought, and still continue to think, will best accomplish the\r\nends proposed.\" A motion to pass the bill over the veto on the 24th of\r\nFebruary received 175 votes to 125, but two-thirds not having voted in\r\nthe affirmative the bill failed to pass. The Republicans voted solidly\r\nin support of the bill, together with a large group of Democrats.\r\nThe negative vote came wholly from the Democratic side. Such a fiasco\r\namounted to a demonstration of the lack of intelligent leadership.\r\nIf the President and his party in Congress were cooperating for the\r\nfurtherance of the same objects, as both averred, it was discreditable\r\nall around that there should have been such a complete misunderstanding\r\nas to the procedure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the President was making a unique record by his vetoes.\r\nDuring the period of ninety-six years, from the foundation of the\r\nGovernment down to the beginning of Cleveland's administration, the\r\nentire number of veto messages was 132. In four years, Cleveland sent\r\nin 301 veto messages, and in addition he practically vetoed 109 bills\r\nby inaction. Of 2042 private pension bills passed by Congress, 1518\r\nwere approved and 284 became laws by lapse of time without approval. The\r\npositive results of the President's activity were thus inconsiderable,\r\nunless incidentally he had managed to correct the system which he had\r\nopposed. That claim, indeed, was made in his behalf when \"The Nation\"\r\nmentioned \"the arrest of the pension craze\" as a \"positive achievement\r\nof the first order.'\" But far from being arrested, \"the pension craze\"\r\nwas made the more furious, and it soon advanced to extremes unknown\r\nbefore.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  March 19, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic politicians naturally viewed with dismay the approach\r\nof the national election of 1888. Any one could see that the party was\r\ndrifting on to the rocks and nobody deemed to be at the helm. According\r\nto William R. Morrison, who certainly had been in a position to know,\r\nPresident Cleveland had \"up to this time taken no decided ground one way\r\nor the other on the question of tariff.\" He had included the subject\r\nin the long dissertation on the state of the Union, which ever since\r\nJefferson's time the President has been wont to send to Congress at\r\nthe opening of a session, but he had not singled it out as having\r\nprecedence. He now surprised the country, roused his party, and gave\r\nfresh animation to national politics on December 6, 1887, by devoting\r\nhis third annual message wholly to the subject of taxation and\r\nrevenue. He pointed out that the treasury surplus was mounting up to\r\n$140,000,000; that the redemption of bonds which had afforded a means\r\nfor disbursement of excess revenues had stopped because there were no\r\nmore bonds that the Government had a right to redeem; and that, hence,\r\nthe Treasury \"idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels\r\nof trade,\" a situation from which monetary derangement and business\r\ndistress would naturally ensue. He strongly urged that the \"present\r\ntariff laws, the vicious, inequitable and illogical source of\r\nunnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended.\"\r\nCleveland gave a detailed analysis of the injurious effects which the\r\nexisting tariff had upon trade and industry, and went on to remark that\r\n\"progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling\r\nupon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of\r\nbandying epithets. It is a condition which confronts us, not a theory.\"\r\nThe effect of the message was very marked both upon public opinion and\r\nparty activity. Mr. Morrison correctly summed up the party effect\r\nin saying that \"Mr. Mills, obtaining the substantial support of the\r\nAdministration, was enabled to press through the House a bill differing\r\nin a very few essential measures from, and combining the general details\r\nand purposes of, the several measures of which I have been the author,\r\nand which had been voted against by many of those who contributed to the\r\nsuccess of the Mills Bill.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident which attracted great notice because it was thought to have\r\na bearing on the President's policy of tariff revision, was the veto of\r\nthe Allentown Public Building Bill. This bill was of a type which is one\r\nof the rankest growths of the Congressional system--the grant of\r\nmoney not for the needs of public service but as a district favor. It\r\nappropriated $100,000 to put up a post-office building at Allentown,\r\nPennsylvania, where adequate quarters were being occupied by the\r\npost-office at an annual rent of $1300. President Cleveland vetoed the\r\nbill simply on the ground that it proposed an unnecessary expenditure,\r\nbut the fact was at once noted that the bill had been fathered by\r\nCongressman Snowden, an active adherent of Randall in opposition to\r\nthe tariff reform policy of the Administration. The word went through\r\nCongress and reverberated through the press that \"there is an Allentown\r\nfor every Snowden.\" Mr. Morrison said in more polite phrase what came\r\nto the same thing when he observed that \"when Mr. Cleveland took decided\r\nground in favor of revision and reduction, he represented the patronage\r\nof the Administration, in consequence of which he was enabled to enforce\r\nparty discipline, so that a man could no longer be a good Democrat and\r\nfavor anything but reform of the tariff.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Mills Bill had passed the House* and had been sent to the\r\nSenate, it was held in committee until October 3, 1888. When it emerged\r\nit carried an amendment which was in effect a complete substitute,\r\nbut it was not taken up for consideration until after the presidential\r\nelection, and it was meant simply as a Republican alternative to the\r\nMills Bill for campaign use. Consideration of the bill began on the\r\n5th of December and lasted until the 22nd of January, when the bill was\r\nreturned to the House transformed into a new measure. It was referred to\r\nthe Ways and Means Committee, and Chairman Mills reported it back with a\r\nresolution setting forth that \"the substitution by the Senate under the\r\nform of an amendment.... of another and different bill,\" is in conflict\r\nwith the section of the Constitution which \"vests in the House of\r\nRepresentatives the sole power to originate such a measure.\" The House\r\nrefused to consider the resolution, a number of Democrats led by Mr.\r\nRandall voting with the Republicans in the negative. No further action\r\nwas taken on the bill and since that day the House has never ventured\r\nto question the right of the Senate to amend tax bills in any way and\r\nto any extent. As Senator Cullom remarks in his memoirs, the Democrats,\r\nalthough they had long held the House and had also gained, the\r\nPresidency, \"were just as powerless to enact legislation as they had\r\nbeen before.\"\r\n\r\n * The Mills Bill was passed July 21, 1888, yeas 162, nays 149,\r\nnot voting 14. Randall, Snowden, and two other Democrats joined the\r\nRepublicans in voting against the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE PUBLIC DISCONTENTS\r\n\r\nWhile President and Congress were passing the time in mutual\r\nobstruction, the public discontents were becoming hot and bitter to\r\na degree unknown before. A marked feature of the situation was the\r\ndisturbance of public convenience involving loss, trouble, and distress\r\nwhich were vast in extent but not easily expressed in statistical form.\r\nThe first three months of 1886 saw an outbreak of labor troubles far\r\nbeyond any previous record in their variety and extent. In 1885, the\r\nnumber of strikes reported was 645 affecting 2284 establishments, a\r\nmarked increase over preceding years. In 1886, the number of strikes\r\nrose to 1411, affecting 9861 establishments and directly involving\r\n499,489 persons. The most numerous strikes were in the building trades,\r\nbut there were severe struggles in many other industries. There was, for\r\nexample, an interruption of business on the New York elevated railway\r\nand on the street railways of New York, Brooklyn, and other cities.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest public anxiety was caused by the behavior of the\r\nKnights of Labor, an organization then growing so rapidly that it gave\r\npromise of uniting under one control the active and energetic elements\r\nof the working classes of the country. It started in a humble way, in\r\nDecember, 1869, among certain garment cutters in Philadelphia, and for\r\nsome years spread slowly from that center. The organization remained\r\nstrictly secret until 1878, in which year it held a national convention\r\nof its fifteen district assemblies at Reading, Pennsylvania. The object\r\nand principles of the order were now made public and, thereafter, it\r\nspread with startling rapidity, so that in 1886 it pitted its strength\r\nagainst public authority with a membership estimated at from, 500,000\r\nto 800,000. Had this body been an army obedient to its leaders, it\r\nwould have wielded great power; but it turned out to be only a mob. Its\r\nmembers took part in demonstrations which were as much mutinies against\r\nthe authority of their own executive board as they were strikes against\r\ntheir employers. The result of lack of organization soon began to be\r\nevident. In March 1886, the receiver of the Texas Pacific Railroad\r\ndischarged an employee prominent in the Knights of Labor and thus\r\nprecipitated a strike which was promptly extended to the Missouri\r\nPacific. There were riots at various points in Missouri and Kansas, and\r\nrailroad traffic at St. Louis was completely suspended for some days,\r\nbut the strike was eventually broken. The Knights of Labor, however,\r\nhad received a blow from which it never recovered, and as a result its\r\nmembership declined. The order has since been almost wholly superseded\r\nby the American Federation of Labor, established in 1886 through shrewd\r\nmanagement by an association of labor unions which had been maintained\r\nsince 1881. The Knights had been organized by localities with the aim of\r\nmerging all classes of working men into one body. The Federation, on\r\nthe other hand, is composed of trades unions retaining their autonomy--a\r\nprinciple of organization which has proved to be more solid and durable.\r\n\r\nTo these signs of popular discontent the Government could not be blind.\r\nA congressional committee investigated the railroad strikes, and both\r\nparties in Congress busied themselves with labor legislation. But in\r\nspite of this apparent willingness to cope with the situation, there now\r\nfollowed another display of those cross purposes which occurred so often\r\nduring the Cleveland administration. The House had already passed a\r\nbill providing means of submitting to arbitration controversies between\r\nrailroads engaged in interstate commerce and their employees. President\r\nCleveland now sent a special message recommending that \"instead of\r\narbitrators chosen in the heat of conflicting claims and after each\r\ndispute shall arise, there be created a Commission of Labor, consisting\r\nof three members, who shall be regular officers of the government,\r\ncharged among other duties with the consideration and settlement when\r\npossible, of all controversies between labor and capital.\" In spite of\r\nthe urgency of the situation, the Senate seized this occasion for a new\r\ndisplay of party tactics, and it allowed the bill already passed by the\r\nHouse to lie without action while it proceeded to consider various labor\r\nmeasures of its own. For example, by June 1, 1886, the Senate had\r\npassed a bill providing that eight hours should be a day's work for\r\nletter-carriers; soon afterwards, it passed a bill legalizing the\r\nincorporation of national trades unions, to which the House promptly\r\nassented without a division; and the House then continued its labor\r\nrecord by passing on the 15th of July a bill against the importation of\r\ncontract labor. This last bill was not passed by the Senate until after\r\nthe fall elections. It was approved by the President on February 23,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nThe Senate also delayed action on the House bill, which proposed\r\narbitration in labor disputes, until the close of the session; and\r\nthen the President, in view of his disregarded suggestion, withheld\r\nhis assent. It was not until the following year that the legislation\r\nrecommended by the President was enacted. By the Act of June 13, 1888,\r\nthe Department of Labor was established, and by the Act of October\r\n1, 1888, in addition to provision for voluntary arbitration between\r\nrailroad corporations and their employees, the President was authorized\r\nto appoint a commission to investigate labor conflicts, with power to\r\nact as a board of conciliation. During the ten years in which the act\r\nremained on the statute books, it was actually put to use only in 1894,\r\nwhen a commission was appointed to investigate the Pullman strike at\r\nChicago, but this body took no action towards settling the dispute.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, the efforts of the Government to deal with the labor\r\nproblem had not been entirely successful. It is true that the labor\r\nconflicts arose over differences which only indirectly involved\r\nconstitutional questions. The aims of both the Knights of Labor and of\r\nthe American Federation were primarily economic and both organizations\r\nwere opposed to agitation of a distinctively political character. But\r\nparallel with the labor agitation, and in communication with it, there\r\nwere radical reform movements of a type unknown before. There was now to\r\narise a socialistic movement opposed to traditional constitutionalism,\r\nand therefore viewed with alarm in many parts of the country. Veneration\r\nof the Constitution of 1787 was practically a national sentiment which\r\nhad lasted from the time the Union was successfully established until\r\nthe Cleveland era. However violent political differences in regard to\r\npublic policy might be, it was the invariable rule that proposals must\r\nclaim a constitutional sanction. In the Civil War, both sides felt\r\nthemselves to be fighting in defense of the traditional Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to antiquity--even such a moderate degree of antiquity as\r\nmay be claimed for American institutions--has always been the staple\r\nargument in American political controversy. The views and intentions\r\nof the Fathers of the Constitution are exhibited not so much\r\nfor instruction as for imitation, and by means of glosses and\r\ninterpretations conclusions may be reached which would have surprised\r\nthe Fathers to whom they are imputed. Those who examine the records of\r\nthe formative period of American institutions, not to obtain material\r\nfor a case but simply to ascertain the facts, will readily observe that\r\nwhat is known as the principle of strict construction dates only from\r\nthe organization of national parties under the Constitution. It was an\r\ninvention of the opposition to Federalist rule and was not held by the\r\nmakers of the Constitution themselves. The main concern of the framers\r\nwas to get power for the National Government, and they went as far as\r\nthey could with such success that striking instances may be culled from\r\nthe writings of the Fathers showing that the scope they contemplated has\r\nyet to be attained. Strict construction affords a short and easy way\r\nof avoiding troublesome issues--always involved in unforeseen national\r\ndevelopments--by substituting the question of constitutional power for a\r\nquestion of public propriety. But this method has the disadvantage,\r\nthat it belittles the Constitution by making it an obstacle to progress.\r\nRunning through much political controversy in the United States is the\r\nargument that, even granting that a proposal has all the merit claimed\r\nfor it, nevertheless it cannot be adopted because the Constitution is\r\nagainst it. By strict logical inference the rejoinder then comes\r\nthat, if so, the Constitution is no longer an instrument of national\r\nadvantage. The traditional attachment of the American people to the\r\nConstitution has indeed been so strong that they have been loath to\r\naccept the inference that the Constitution is out of date, although the\r\nquality of legislation at Washington kept persistently suggesting that\r\nview of the case.\r\n\r\nThe failures and disappointments resulting from the series of national\r\nelections from 1874 to 1884, at last, made an opening for party\r\nmovements voicing the popular discontent and openly antagonistic to\r\nthe traditional Constitution. The Socialist Labor party held its first\r\nnational convention in 1877. Its membership was mostly foreign; of\r\ntwenty-four periodical publications then carried on in the party\r\ninterest, only eight were in the English language; and this polyglot\r\npress gave justification to the remark that the movement was in the\r\nhands of people who proposed to remodel the institutions of the country\r\nbefore they had acquired its language. The alien origin of the movement\r\nwas emphasized by the appearance of two Socialist members of the German\r\nReichstag, who made a tour of this country in 1881 to stir up interest\r\nin the cause. It was soon apparent that the growth of the Socialist\r\nparty organization was hindered by the fact that its methods were too\r\nstudious and its discussions too abstract to suit the energetic temper\r\nof the times. Many Socialists broke away to join revolutionary clubs\r\nwhich were now organized in a number of cities without any clearly\r\ndefined principle save to fight the existing system of government.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment in the process of social disorganization, the\r\ninfluence of foreign destructive thought made itself felt. The\r\narrival of Johann Most from Europe, in the fall of 1882, supplied this\r\nrevolutionary movement with a leader who made anarchy its principle.\r\nOriginally a German Socialist aiming to make the State the sole landlord\r\nand capitalist, he had gone over to anarchism and proposed to dissolve\r\nthe State altogether, trusting to voluntary association to supply\r\nall genuine social needs. Driven from Germany, he had taken refuge in\r\nEngland, but even the habitual British tolerance had given way under\r\nhis praise of the assassination of the Czar Alexander in 1881 and his\r\nproposal to treat other rulers in the same way. He had just completed\r\na term of imprisonment before coming to the United States. Here, he was\r\nreceived as a hero; a great mass meeting in his honor was held in Cooper\r\nUnion, New York, in December, 1882; and when he toured the country he\r\neverywhere addressed large meetings.\r\n\r\nIn October 1883, a convention of social revolutionists and anarchists\r\nwas held in Chicago, at which a national organization was formed called\r\nthe International Working People's Association. The new organization\r\ngrew much faster than the Socialist party itself, which now almost\r\ndisappeared. Two years later, the International had a party press\r\nconsisting of seven German, two Bohemian, and only two English papers.\r\nLike the Socialist party, it was, therefore, mainly foreign in its\r\nmembership. It was strongest in and about Chicago, where it included\r\ntwenty groups with three thousand enrolled members. The anarchist\r\npapers exhorted their adherents to provide themselves with arms and even\r\npublished instructions for the use of dynamite.\r\n\r\nPolitical and industrial conditions thus supplied material for an\r\nexplosion which came with shocking violence. On May 4, 1885, towards the\r\nclose of an anarchist meeting held in Chicago, a dynamite bomb thrown\r\namong a force of policemen killed one and wounded many. Fire was at\r\nonce opened on both sides, and, although the battle lasted only a few\r\nminutes, seven policemen were killed and about sixty wounded; while\r\non the side of the anarchists, four were killed and about fifty were\r\nwounded. Ten of the anarchist leaders were promptly indicted, of whom\r\none made his escape and another turned State's evidence. The trial of\r\nthe remaining eight began on June 21, 1886, and two months later the\r\ndeath sentence was imposed upon seven and a penitentiary term of fifteen\r\nyears upon one. The sentences of two of the seven were commuted to life\r\nimprisonment; one committed suicide in his cell by exploding a cartridge\r\nin his mouth; and four met death on the scaffold. While awaiting\r\ntheir fate they were to a startling extent regarded as heroes and\r\nbore themselves as martyrs to a noble cause. Six years later, Illinois\r\nelected as governor John P. Altgeld, one of whose first steps was to\r\nissue a pardon to the three who were serving terms of imprisonment and\r\nto criticize sharply the conduct of the trial which had resulted in the\r\nconviction of the anarchists.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago outbreak and its result stopped the open spread of\r\nanarchism. Organized labor now withdrew from any sort of association\r\nwith it. This cleared the field for a revival of the Socialist movement\r\nas the agency of social and political reconstruction. So rapidly did\r\nit gain in membership and influence that by 1892 it was able to present\r\nitself as an organized national party appealing to public opinion for\r\nconfidence and support, submitting its claims to public discussion, and\r\nstating its case upon reasonable grounds. Although its membership was\r\nsmall in comparison with that of the old parties, the disparity was\r\nnot so great as it seemed, since the Socialists represented active\r\nintelligence while the other parties represented political inertia. From\r\nthis time on, Socialist views spread among college students, artists,\r\nand men of letters, and the academic Socialist became a familiar figure\r\nin American society.\r\n\r\nProbably more significant than the Socialist movement, as an indication\r\nof the popular demand for radical reform in the government of the\r\ncountry, was the New York campaign of Henry George in 1886. He was a San\r\nFrancisco printer and journalist when he published the work on \"Progress\r\nand Poverty\" which made him famous. Upon the petition of over thirty\r\nthousand citizens, he became the Labor candidate for mayor of New York\r\nCity. The movement in support of George developed so much strength that\r\nthe regular parties felt compelled to put forward exceptionally strong\r\ncandidates. The Democrats nominated Abram S. Hewitt, a man of the\r\nhighest type of character, a fact which was not perhaps so influential\r\nin getting him the nomination as that he was the son-in-law of Peter\r\nCooper, a philanthropist justly beloved by the working classes. The\r\nRepublicans nominated Theodore Roosevelt, who had already distinguished\r\nhimself by his energy of character and zeal for reform. Hewitt was\r\nelected, but George received 68,110 votes out of a total of 219,679, and\r\nstood second in the poll. His supporters contended that he had really\r\nbeen elected but had been counted out, and this belief turned their\r\nattention to the subject of ballot reform. To the agitation which\r\nHenry George began, may be fairly ascribed the general adoption of the\r\nAustralian ballot in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist propaganda carried on in large cities and in factory towns\r\nhardly touched the great mass of the people of the United States, who\r\nbelonged to the farm rather than to the workshop. The great agricultural\r\nclass, which had more weight at the polls than any other class of\r\ncitizens, was much interested in the redress of particular grievances\r\nand very little in any general reform of the governmental system. It\r\nis a class that is conservative in disposition but distrustful of\r\nauthority, impatient of what is theoretical and abstract, and bent upon\r\nthe quick practical solution of problems by the nearest and simplest\r\nmeans. While the Socialists in the towns were interested in labor\r\nquestions, the farmers more than any other class were affected by the\r\ndefective system of currency supply. The national banking system had not\r\nbeen devised to meet industrial needs but as a war measure to provide\r\na market for government bonds, deposits of which had to be made as the\r\nbasis of note issues. As holdings of government bonds were amassed in\r\nthe East, financial operations tended to confine themselves to that\r\npart of the country, and banking facilities seemed to be in danger\r\nof becoming a sectional monopoly, and such, indeed, was the case to a\r\nmarked extent. This situation inspired among the farmers, especially\r\nin the agricultural West, a hatred of Wall Street and a belief in the\r\nexistence of a malign money power which provided an inexhaustible fund\r\nof sectional feeling for demagogic exploitation.\r\n\r\nFor lack of proper machinery of credit for carrying on the process of\r\nexchange, there seemed to be an absolute shortage in the amount of money\r\nin circulation, and it was this circumstance that had given such force\r\nto the Greenback Movement. Although that movement was defeated, its\r\nsupporters urged that, if the Government could not supply additional\r\nnote issues, it should at least permit an increase in the stock of\r\ncoined money. This feeling was so strong that as early as 1877 the House\r\nhad passed a bill for the free coinage of silver. For this, the\r\nSenate substituted a measure requiring the purchase and coinage by the\r\nGovernment of from two to four million dollars' worth of silver monthly,\r\nand this compromise was accepted by the House. As a result, in February,\r\n1878, it was passed over President Hayes's veto.\r\n\r\nThe operation of this act naturally tended to cause the hoarding of\r\ngold as the cheaper silver was equally a legal tender, and meanwhile the\r\nsilver dollars did not tend to pass into circulation. In 1885, in his\r\nfirst annual message to Congress, President Cleveland mentioned the fact\r\nthat, although 215,759,431 silver dollars had been coined, only about\r\nfifty million had found their way into circulation, and that \"every\r\nmonth two millions of gold in the public Treasury are paid out for two\r\nmillions or more of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already\r\naccumulated.\" The process was draining the stock of gold in the Treasury\r\nand forcing the country to a silver basis without really increasing\r\nthe amount of money in actual circulation or removing any of the\r\ndifficulties in the way of obtaining supplies of currency for business\r\ntransactions. President Cleveland recommended the repeal of the Silver\r\nCoinage Act, but he had no plan to offer by which the genuine complaints\r\nof the people against the existing monetary system could be removed.\r\nFree silver thus was allowed to stand before the people as the only\r\npractical proposal for their relief, and upon this issue a conflict soon\r\nbegan between Congress and the Administration.\r\n\r\nAt a convention of the American Bankers' Association in September, 1885,\r\na New York bank president described the methods by which the Treasury\r\nDepartment was restricting the operation of the Silver Coinage Act so\r\nas to avoid a displacement of the gold standard. On February 3, 1886,\r\nChairman Bland of the House committee on coinage reported a resolution\r\nreciting statements made in that address, and calling upon the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury for a detailed account of his administration of the\r\nSilver Coinage Act. Secretary Manning's reply was a long and weighty\r\nargument against continuing the coinage of silver. He contended that\r\nthere was no hope of maintaining a fixed ratio between gold and silver\r\nexcept by international concert of action, but \"the step is one which\r\nno European nation... will consent to take while the direct or\r\nindirect substitution of European silver for United States gold seems a\r\npossibility.\" While strong as to what not to do, his reply, like most of\r\nthe state papers of this period, was weak as to what to do and how to do\r\nit. The outlook of the Secretary of the Treasury was so narrow that he\r\nwas led to remark that \"a delusion has spread that the Government has\r\nauthority to fix the amount of the people's currency, and the power,\r\nand the duty.\" The Government certainly has the power and the duty of\r\nproviding adequate currency supply through a sound banking system. The\r\ninstinct of the people on that point was sounder than the view of their\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nSecretary Manning's plea had so little effect that the House promptly\r\nvoted to suspend the rules in order to make a free coinage bill the\r\nspecial order of business until it was disposed of. But the influence of\r\nthe Administration was strong enough to defeat the bill when it came\r\nto a vote. Though for a time, the legislative advance of the silver\r\nmovement was successfully resisted, the Treasury Department was left in\r\na difficult situation, and the expedients to which it resorted to guard\r\nthe gold supply added to the troubles of the people in the matter of\r\nobtaining currency. The quick way of getting gold from the Treasury was\r\nto present legal tender notes for redemption. To keep this process in\r\ncheck, legal tender notes were impounded as they came in, and silver\r\ncertificates were substituted in disbursements. But under the law of\r\n1878, silver certificates could not be issued in denominations of less\r\nthan ten dollars. A scarcity of small notes resulted, which oppressed\r\nretail trade until, in August, 1886, Congress authorized the issue of\r\nsilver certificates in one and two and five dollar bills.\r\n\r\nA more difficult problem was presented by the Treasury surplus which, by\r\nold regulations savoring more of barbarism than of civilized polity, had\r\nto be kept idle in the Treasury vaults. The only apparent means by which\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury could return his surplus funds to the\r\nchannels of trade was by redeeming government bonds; but as these were\r\nthe basis of bank note issues, the effect of any such action was to\r\nproduce a sharp contraction in this class of currency. Between 1882\r\nand 1889, national bank notes declined in amount from $356,060,348\r\nto $199,779,011. In the same period, the issue of silver certificates\r\nincreased from $63,204,780 to $276,619,715, and the total amount\r\nof currency of all sorts nominally increased from $1,188,752,363 to\r\n$1,405,018,000; but of this, $375,947,715 was in gold coin which was\r\nbeing hoarded, and national bank notes were almost equally scarce since\r\nthey were virtually government bonds in a liquid form.\r\n\r\nAs the inefficiency of the monetary system came home to the people\r\nin practical experience, it seemed as if they were being plagued and\r\ninconvenienced in every possible way. The conditions were just such as\r\nwould spread disaffection among the farmers, and their discontent sought\r\nan outlet. The growth of political agitation in the agricultural\r\nclass, accompanied by a thorough-going disapproval of existing party\r\nleadership, gave rise to numerous new party movements. Delegates\r\nfrom the Agricultural Wheel, the Corn-Planters, the Anti-Monopolists,\r\nFarmers' Alliance, and Grangers, attended a convention in February,\r\n1887, and joined the Knights of Labor and the Greenbackers to form the\r\nUnited Labor party. In the country, at this time, there were numerous\r\nother labor parties of local origin and composition, with trade\r\nunionists predominating in some places and Socialists in others.\r\nVery early, however, these parties showed a tendency to division that\r\nindicated a clash of incompatible elements. Single taxers, greenbackers,\r\nlabor leaders, grangers, and socialists were agreed only in condemning\r\nexisting public policy. When they came to consider the question of what\r\nnew policy should be adopted, they immediately manifested irreconcilable\r\ndifferences. In 1888, rival national conventions were held in\r\nCincinnati, one designating itself as the Union Labor party, the other\r\nas the United Labor party. One made a schedule of particular demands;\r\nthe other insisted on the single tax as the consummation of their\r\npurpose in seeking reform. Both put presidential tickets in the field,\r\nbut of the two, the Union Labor party made by far the better showing at\r\nthe polls though, even so, it polled fewer votes than did the National\r\nProhibition party. Although making no very considerable showing at the\r\npolls, these new movements were very significant as evidences of popular\r\nunrest. The fact that the heaviest vote of the Union Labor party was\r\npolled in the agricultural States of Kansas, Missouri, and Texas, was a\r\nportent of the sweep of the populist movement which virtually captured\r\nthe Democratic party organization during President Cleveland's second\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of Blaine from the list of presidential candidates in\r\n1888 left the Republican Convention at Chicago to choose from a score\r\nof \"favorite sons.\" Even his repeated statement that he would not accept\r\nthe nomination did not prevent his enthusiastic followers from hoping\r\nthat the convention might be \"stampeded.\" But on the first ballot,\r\nBlaine received only thirty-five votes while John Sherman led with 229.\r\nIt was anybody's race until the eighth ballot, when General Benjamin\r\nHarrison, grandson of \"Tippecanoe,\" suddenly forged ahead and received\r\nthe nomination.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Democratic party at the polls in the presidential\r\nelection of 1888 was less emphatic than might have been expected from\r\nits sorry record. Indeed, it is quite possible that an indiscretion in\r\nwhich Lord Sackville-West, the British Ambassador, was caught may have\r\nturned the scale. An adroitly worded letter was sent to him, purporting\r\nto come from Charles Murchison, a California voter of English birth,\r\nasking confidential advice which might enable the writer \"to assure many\r\nof our countrymen that they would do England a service by voting\r\nfor Cleveland and against the Republican system of tariff.\" With an\r\nastonishing lack of astuteness, the British minister fell into the trap\r\nand sent a reply which, while noncommittal on particulars, exhibited\r\nfriendly interest in the reelection of President Cleveland. This\r\ncorrespondence, when published late in the campaign, caused the\r\nAdministration to demand his recall. A spirited statement of the case\r\nwas laid before the public by Thomas Francis Bayard, Secretary of State,\r\na few days before the election, but this was not enough to undo the harm\r\nthat had been done, and the Murchison letter takes rank with the Morey\r\nletter attributed to General Garfield as specimens of the value of the\r\ncampaign lie as a weapon in American party politics.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland received a slight plurality in the total popular\r\nvote; but by small pluralities Harrison carried the big States, thus\r\nobtaining a heavy majority in the electoral vote. At the same time,\r\nthe Republicans obtained nearly as large a majority in the House as the\r\nDemocrats had had before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE REPUBLICAN OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\nThe Republican party had the inestimable advantage in the year 1889 of\r\nbeing able to act. It controlled the Senate which had become the seat\r\nof legislative authority; it controlled the House; and it had placed its\r\ncandidate in the presidential chair. All branches of the Government\r\nwere now in party accord. The leaders in both Houses were able\r\nmen, experienced in the diplomacy which, far more than argument or\r\nconviction, produces congressional action. Benjamin Harrison himself\r\nhad been a member of the ruling group of Senators, and as he was fully\r\nimbued with their ideas as to the proper place of the President he was\r\ncareful to avoid interference with legislative procedure. Such was the\r\nparty harmony that an extensive program of legislation was put through\r\nwithout serious difficulty, after obstruction had been overcome in the\r\nHouse by an amendment of the rules.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, the quorum is a majority of the whole\r\nmembership. This rule enabled the minority to stop business at any\r\ntime when the majority party was not present in sufficient strength to\r\nmaintain the quorum by its own vote. On several occasions, the Democrats\r\nleft the House nominally without a quorum by the subterfuge of refusing\r\nto answer to their names on the roll call. Speaker Reed determined to\r\nend this practice by counting as present any members actually in the\r\nchamber. To the wrath of the minority, he assumed this authority while\r\na revision of the rules was pending. The absurdity of the Democratic\r\nposition was naively exposed when a member arose with a law book in his\r\nhand and said, \"I deny your right, Mr. Speaker, to count me as present,\r\nand I desire to read from the parliamentary law on the subject.\" Speaker\r\nReed, with the nasal drawl that was his habit, replied, \"The Chair is\r\nmaking a statement of fact that the gentleman from Kentucky is present?\r\nDoes he deny it?\" The rejoinder was so apposite that the House broke\r\ninto a roar of laughter, and the Speaker carried his point.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Speaker Reed was violating all precedents. Facilities of\r\nobstruction had been cherished by both parties, and nothing short of\r\nReed's earnestness and determination could have effected this salutary\r\nreform. The fact has since been disclosed that he had made up his mind\r\nto resign the Speakership and retire from public life had his party\r\nfailed to support him. For three days, the House was a bedlam, but the\r\nSpeaker bore himself throughout with unflinching courage and unruffled\r\ncomposure. Eventually he had his way. New rules were adopted, and the\r\npower to count a quorum was established.* When in later Congresses a\r\nDemocratic majority returned to the former practice, Reed gave them such\r\na dose of their own medicine that for weeks the House was unable to keep\r\na quorum. Finally, the House was forced to return to the \"Reed rules\"\r\nwhich have since then been permanently retained. As a result of\r\ncongressional example, they have been generally adopted by American\r\nlegislative bodies, with a marked improvement in their capacity to do\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The rule that \"no dilatory motion shall be entertained by the\r\nSpeaker\" was also adopted at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the facilities of action which they now possessed, the Republican\r\nleaders had no difficulty in getting rid of the surplus in the Treasury.\r\nIndeed, in this particular they could count on Democratic aid. The\r\nmain conduit which they used was an increase of pension expenditures.\r\nPresident Harrison encouraged a spirit of broad liberality toward\r\nveterans of the Civil War. During the campaign he said that it \"was\r\nno time to be weighing the claims of old soldiers with apothecary's\r\nscales,\" and he put this principle of generous recognition into effect\r\nby appointing as commissioner of pensions a robust partisan known as\r\n\"Corporal\" Tanner. The report went abroad that on taking office he had\r\ngleefully declared, \"God help the surplus,\" and upon that maxim he acted\r\nwith unflinching vigor. It seemed, indeed, as if any claim could count\r\nupon being allowed so long as it purported to come from an old soldier.\r\nBut Tanner's ambition was not satisfied with an indulgent consideration\r\nof applications pending during his time; he reopened old cases,\r\nrerated a large number of pensioners, and increased the amount of their\r\nallowance. In some cases, large sums were granted as arrears due on the\r\nbasis of the new rate. A number of officers of the pension bureau\r\nwere thus favored, for a man might receive a pension on the score of\r\ndisability though still able to hold office and draw its salary and\r\nemoluments. For example, the sum of $4300 in arrears was declared to\r\nbe due to a member of the United States Senate, Charles F. Manderson of\r\nNebraska. Finally, \"Corporal\" Tanner's extravagant management became\r\nso intolerable to the Secretary of the Interior that he confronted\r\nPresident Harrison with the choice of accepting his resignation or\r\ndismissing Tanner. Tanner therefore had to go, and with him his system\r\nof reratings.\r\n\r\nA pension bill for dependents, such as Cleveland had vetoed, now went\r\ntriumphantly through Congress.* It granted pensions of from six to\r\ntwelve dollars a month to all persons who had served for ninety days\r\nin the Civil War and had thereby been incapacitated for manual labor to\r\nsuch a degree as to be unable to support themselves. Pensions were\r\nalso granted to widows, minor children, and dependent parents. This law\r\nbrought in an enormous flood of claims in passing, upon which it was\r\nthe policy of the Pension Bureau to practice great indulgence. In one\r\ninstance, a pension was granted to a claimant who had enlisted but never\r\nreally served in the army as he had deserted soon after entering the\r\ncamp. He thereupon had been sentenced to hard labor for one year and\r\nmade to forfeit all pay and allowances. After the war, he had been\r\nconvicted of horse stealing and sent to the state penitentiary in\r\nWisconsin. While serving his term, he presented a pension claim\r\nsupported by forged testimony to the effect that he had been wounded in\r\nthe battle of Franklin. The fraud was discovered by a special examiner\r\nof the pension office, and the claimant and some of his witnesses were\r\ntried for perjury, convicted, and sent to the state penitentiary at\r\nJoliet, Illinois. After serving his time there, he posed as a neglected\r\nold soldier and succeeded in obtaining letters from sympathetic\r\nCongressmen commending his case to the attention of the pension office,\r\nbut without avail until the Act of 1890 was passed. He then put in a\r\nclaim which was twice rejected by the pension office examiners, but\r\neach time the decision was overruled, and in the end he was put upon the\r\npension roll. This case is only one of many made possible by lax methods\r\nof investigating pension claims. Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire\r\neventually said of the effect of pension policy, as shaped by his own\r\nparty with his own aid:\r\n\r\n\"If there was any soldier on the Union side during the Civil War who was\r\nnot a good soldier, who has not received a pension, I do not know who\r\nhe is. He can always find men of his own type, equally poor soldiers who\r\nwould swear that they knew he had been in a hospital at a certain time,\r\nwhether he was or not--the records did not state it, but they knew it\r\nwas so--and who would also swear that they knew he had received a shock\r\nwhich affected his hearing during a certain battle, or that something\r\nelse had happened to him; and so all those pension claims, many of which\r\nare worthless, have been allowed by the Government, because they were\r\n'proved.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  June 27, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increase in the expenditure for pensions, which rose from\r\n$88,000,000 in 1889 to $159,000,000 in 1893, swept away much of the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury. Further inroads were made by the enactment of\r\nthe largest river and harbor appropriation bill in the history of the\r\ncountry up to this time. Moreover, a new tariff bill was contrived in\r\nsuch a way as to impose protective duties without producing so much\r\nrevenue that it would cause popular complaint about unnecessary\r\ntaxation. A large source of revenue was cut off by abolishing the\r\nsugar duties and by substituting a system of bounties to encourage home\r\nproduction. Upon this bill as a whole, Senator Cullom remarks in\r\nhis memoirs that \"it was a high protective tariff, dictated by the\r\nmanufacturers of the country\" who have \"insisted upon higher duties than\r\nthey really ought to have.\" The bill was, indeed, made up wholly\r\nwith the view of protecting American manufactures from any foreign\r\ncompetition in the home market.\r\n\r\nAs passed by the House, not only did the bill ignore American commerce\r\nwith other countries but it left American consumers exposed to the\r\nmanipulation of prices on the part of other countries. Practically all\r\nthe products of tropical America, except tobacco, had been placed upon\r\nthe free list without any precaution lest the revenue thus surrendered\r\nmight not be appropriated by other countries by means of export taxes.\r\nBlaine, who was once more Secretary of State, began a vigorous agitation\r\nin favor of adding reciprocity provisions to the bill. When the Senate\r\nshowed a disposition to resent his interference, Blaine addressed to\r\nSenator Frye of Maine a letter which was in effect an appeal to the\r\npeople, and which greatly stirred the farmers by its statement that\r\n\"there is not a section or a line in the entire bill that will open\r\nthe market for another bushel of wheat or another barrel of pork.\" The\r\neffect was so marked that the Senate yielded, and the Tariff Bill, as\r\nfinally enacted, gave the President power to impose certain duties\r\non sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides imported from any country\r\nimposing on American goods duties, which, in the opinion of the\r\nPresident, were \"reciprocally unequal and unreasonable.\" This more\r\nequitable result is to be ascribed wholly to Blaine's energetic and\r\ncapable leadership.\r\n\r\nPending the passage of the Tariff Bill, the Senate had been wrestling\r\nwith the trust problem which was making a mockery of a favorite theory\r\nof the Republicans. They had held that tariff protection benefited\r\nthe consumer by the stimulus which it gave to home production and by\r\nensuring a supply of articles on as cheap terms as American labor\r\ncould afford. There were, however, notorious facts showing that certain\r\ncorporations had taken advantage of the situation to impose high prices,\r\nespecially upon the American consumer. It was a campaign taunt that the\r\ntariff held the people down while the trusts went through their\r\npockets, and to this charge the Republicans found it difficult to make a\r\nsatisfactory reply.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such economic injustice was continually urged in\r\nsupport of popular demands for the control of corporations by the\r\nGovernment. Though the Republican leaders were much averse to providing\r\nsuch control, they found inaction so dangerous that on January 14, 1890,\r\nSenator John Sherman reported from the Finance Committee a vague but\r\nperemptory statute to make trade competition compulsory. This was the\r\norigin of the AntiTrust Law which has since gone by his name, although\r\nthe law actually passed was framed by the Senate judiciary committee.\r\nThe first section declared that \"every contract, combination in the form\r\nof trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce\r\namong the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to\r\nbe illegal.\" The law made no attempt to define the offenses it penalized\r\nand created no machinery for enforcing its provisions, but it gave\r\njurisdiction over alleged violations to the courts--a favorite\r\ncongressional mode of getting rid of troublesome responsibilities. As a\r\nresult, the courts have been struggling with the application of the law\r\never since, without being able to develop a clear or consistent rule\r\nfor discriminating between legal and illegal combinations in trade and\r\ncommerce. Even upon the financial question, the Republicans succeeded\r\nin maintaining party harmony, notwithstanding a sharp conflict between\r\nfactions. William Windom, the Secretary of the Treasury, had prepared a\r\nbill of the type known as a \"straddle.\" It offered the advocates of free\r\ncoinage the right to send to the mint silver bullion in any quantity\r\nand to receive in return the net market value of the bullion in treasury\r\nnotes redeemable in gold or silver coin at the option of the Government.\r\nThe monthly purchase of not less than $2,000,000 worth of bullion was,\r\nhowever, no longer to be required by law. When the advocates of silver\r\ninsisted that the provision for bullion purchase was too vague, a\r\nsubstitute was prepared which definitely required the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to purchase 4,500,000 ounces of silver bullion in one month.\r\nThe bill, as thus amended, was put through the House under special rule\r\nby a strict party vote. But when the bill reached the Senate, the\r\nformer party agreement could no longer be maintained, and the Republican\r\nleaders lost control of the situation. The free silver Republicans\r\ncombined with most of the Democrats to substitute a free coinage bill,\r\nwhich passed the Senate by forty-three yeas to twenty-four nays, all the\r\nnegative votes save three coming from the Republican side.\r\n\r\nIt took all the influence the party leaders could exert to prevent a\r\nsilver stampede in the House when the Senate substitute bill was brought\r\nforward; but by dexterous management, a vote of non-concurrence was\r\npassed and a committee of conference was appointed. The Republican\r\nleaders now found themselves in a situation in which presidential\r\nnon-interference ceased to be desirable, but president Harrison could\r\nnot be stirred to action. He would not even state his views. As Senator\r\nSherman remarked in his \"Recollections,\" \"The situation at that time was\r\ncritical. A large majority of the Senate favored free silver, and it was\r\nfeared that the small majority against it in the other House might yield\r\nand agree to it. The silence of the President on the matter gave rise to\r\nan apprehension that if a free coinage bill should pass both Houses, he\r\nwould not feel at liberty to veto it.\"\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, the Republican leaders appealed to their free silver\r\nparty associates to be content with compelling the Treasury to purchase\r\n4,500,000 ounces of silver per month, which it was wrongly calculated\r\nwould cover the entire output of American mines. The force of party\r\ndiscipline eventually prevailed, and the Republican party got together\r\non this compromise. The bill was adopted in both Houses by a strict\r\nparty vote, with the Democrats solidly opposed, and was finally enacted\r\non July 14, 1890.\r\n\r\nThus by relying upon political tactics, the managers of the Republican\r\nparty were able to reconcile conflicting interests, maintain party\r\nharmony, and present a record of achievement which they hoped to make\r\navailable in the fall elections. But while they had placated the party\r\nfactions, they had done nothing to satisfy the people as a whole or to\r\nredress their grievances. The slowness of congressional procedure\r\nin matters of legislative reform allowed the amplest opportunity to\r\nunscrupulous business men to engage, in the meantime, in profiteering at\r\nthe public expense. They were able to lay in stocks of goods at the\r\nold rates so that an increase of customs rates, for example, became\r\nan enormous tax upon consumers without a corresponding gain to the\r\nTreasury; for the yield was largely intercepted on private accounts by\r\nan advance in prices. The Tariff Bill, which William McKinley reported\r\non April 16, 1890, became law only on the 1st of October, so there were\r\nover five months during which profiteers could stock at old rates\r\nfor sales at the new rates and thus reap a rich harvest. The public,\r\nhowever, was infuriated, and popular sentiment was so stirred by the\r\nmethods of retail trade that the politicians were both angered and\r\ndismayed. Whenever purchasers complained of an increase of price, they\r\nreceived the apparently plausible explanation, \"Oh, the McKinley Bill\r\ndid it.\" To silence this popular discontent, the customary arts and\r\ncajoleries of the politicians proved for once quite ineffectual.\r\n\r\nAt the next election, the Republicans carried only eighty-eight seats in\r\nthe House out of 332--the most crushing defeat they had yet sustained.\r\nBy their new lease of power in the House, however, the Democratic\r\nparty could not accomplish any legislation, as the Republicans still\r\ncontrolled the Senate. The Democratic leaders, therefore, adopted the\r\npolicy of passing a series of bills attacking the tariff at what were\r\nsupposed to be particularly vulnerable points. These measures, the\r\nRepublicans derided as \"pop-gun bills,\" and in the Senate they turned\r\nthem over to the committee on finance for burial. Both parties were rent\r\nby the silver issue, but it was noticeable that in the House which was\r\nclosest to the people the opposition to the silver movement was stronger\r\nand more effective than in the Senate.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the popular revolt against the Republican policy which\r\nwas disclosed by the fall elections of 1890, President Harrison's annual\r\nmessage of December 9, 1891, was marked by extreme complacency. Great\r\nthings, he assured the people, were being accomplished under his\r\nadministration. The results of the McKinley Bill \"have disappointed\r\nthe evil prophecies of its opponents and in large measure realized the\r\nhopeful predictions of its friends.\" Rarely had the country been so\r\nprosperous. The foreign commerce of the United States had reached the\r\nlargest total in the history of the country. The prophecies made by the\r\nantisilver men regarding disasters to result from the Silver Bullion\r\nPurchase Act, had not been realized. The President remarked \"that the\r\nincreased volume of currency thus supplied for the use of the people was\r\nneeded and that beneficial results upon trade and prices have followed\r\nthis legislation I think must be clear to every one.\" He held that the\r\nfree coinage of silver would be disastrous, as it would contract the\r\ncurrency by the withdrawal of gold, whereas \"the business of the world\r\nrequires the use of both metals.\" While \"the producers of silver\r\nare entitled to just consideration,\" it should be remembered that\r\n\"bimetallism is the desired end, and the true friends of silver will be\r\ncareful not to overrun the goal.\" In conclusion, the President expressed\r\nhis great joy over \"many evidences of the increased unification of the\r\npeople and of the revived national spirit. The vista that now opens to\r\nus is wider and more glorious than before. Gratification and amazement\r\nstruggle for supremacy as we contemplate the population, wealth, and\r\nmoral strength of our country.\"\r\n\r\nThough the course of events has yet to be fully explained, President\r\nHarrison's dull pomposity may have been the underlying reason of the\r\naversion which Blaine now began to manifest. Although on Harrison's side\r\nand against Blaine, Senator Cullom remarks in his memoirs that Harrison\r\nhad \"a very cold, distant temperament,\" and that \"he was probably the\r\nmost unsatisfactory President we ever had in the White House to those\r\nwho must necessarily come into personal contact with him.\" Cullom is\r\nof the opinion that \"jealousy was probably at the bottom of their\r\ndisaffection,\" but it appears to be certain that at this time Blaine had\r\nrenounced all ambition to be President and energetically discouraged any\r\nmovement in favor of his candidacy. On February 6, 1892, he wrote to\r\nthe chairman of the Republican National Committee that he was not\r\na candidate and that his name would not go before the convention.\r\nPresident Harrison went ahead with his arrangements for renomination,\r\nwith no sign of opposition from Blaine. Then suddenly, on the eve of\r\nthe convention, something happened--exactly what has yet to be\r\ndiscovered--which caused Blaine to resign the office of Secretary of\r\nState. It soon became known that Blaine's name would be presented,\r\nalthough he had not announced himself as a candidate. Blaine's health\r\nwas then broken, and it was impossible that he could have imagined that\r\nhis action would defeat Harrison. It could not have been meant for more\r\nthan a protest. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot with Blaine\r\na poor second in the poll.\r\n\r\nIn the Democratic convention, Cleveland, too, was renominated on the\r\nfirst ballot, in the face of a bitter and outspoken opposition. The\r\nsolid vote of his own State, New York, was polled against him under the\r\nunit rule, and went in favor of David B. Hill. But even with this large\r\nblock of votes to stand upon, Hill was able to get only 113 votes in\r\nall, while Cleveland received 616. Genuine acceptance of his leadership,\r\nhowever, did not at all correspond with this vote. Cleveland had come\r\nout squarely against free silver, and at least eight of the Democratic\r\nstate conventions--in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Texas--came out just as definitely in favor of\r\nfree silver. But even delegates who were opposed to Cleveland, and who\r\nlistened with glee to excoriating speeches against him forthwith, voted\r\nfor him as the candidate of greatest popular strength. They then solaced\r\ntheir feelings by nominating a free silver man for Vice-President, who\r\nwas made the more acceptable by his opposition to civil service reform.\r\nThe ticket thus straddled the main issue; and the platform was\r\nsimilarly ambiguous. It denounced the Silver Purchase Act as \"a cowardly\r\nmakeshift\" which should be repealed, and it declared in favor of \"the\r\ncoinage of both gold and silver without discrimination,\" with the\r\nprovision that \"the dollar unit of coinage of both metals must be of\r\nequal intrinsic and exchangeable value.\" The Prohibition party in that\r\nyear came out for the \"free and unlimited coinage of silver and gold.\" A\r\nmore significant sign of the times was the organization of the \"People's\r\nparty,\" which held its first convention and nominated the old Greenback\r\nleader, James B. Weaver of Iowa, on a free silver platform.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was accompanied by labor disturbances of unusual extent\r\nand violence. Shortly after the meeting of the national conventions, a\r\ncontest began between the powerful Amalgamated Association of Steel\r\nand Iron Workers, the strongest of the trade-unions, and the Carnegie\r\nCompany over a new wage scale introduced in the Homestead mills. The\r\nstrike began on June 29, 1892, and local authority at once succumbed\r\nto the strikers. In anticipation of this eventuality, the company had\r\narranged to have three hundred Pinkerton men act as guards. They arrived\r\nin Pittsburgh during the night of the 5th of July and embarked on barges\r\nwhich were towed up the river to Homestead. As they approached, the\r\nstrikers turned out to meet them, and an engagement ensued in which men\r\nwere killed or wounded on both sides and the Pinkerton men were defeated\r\nand driven away. For a short time, the strikers were in complete\r\npossession of the town and of the company's property. They preserved\r\norder fairly well but kept a strict watch that no strike breakers should\r\napproach or attempt to resume work. The government of Pennsylvania was,\r\nfor a time, completely superseded in that region by the power of the\r\nAmalgamated Association, until a large force of troops entered Homestead\r\non the 12th of July and remained in possession of the place for several\r\nmonths. The contest between the strikers and the company caused great\r\nexcitement throughout the country, and a foreign anarchist from New\r\nYork attempted to assassinate Mr. Frick, the managing director of the\r\ncompany. Though this strike was caused by narrow differences concerning\r\nonly the most highly paid classes of workers, it continued for some\r\nmonths and then ended in the complete defeat of the union.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the militia arrived at Homestead, a more bloody and\r\ndestructive conflict occurred in the Coeur d'Alene district of Idaho,\r\nwhere the workers in the silver mines were on strike. Nonunion men were\r\nimported and put into some of the mines. The strikers, armed with rifles\r\nand dynamite, thereupon attacked the nonunion men and drove them\r\noff, but many lives were lost in the struggle and much property was\r\ndestroyed. The strikers proved too strong for any force which state\r\nauthority could muster, but upon the call of the Governor, President\r\nHarrison ordered federal troops to the scene and under martial law order\r\nwas soon restored.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of popular unrest was given in August by a strike of\r\nthe switchmen in the Buffalo railway yards, which paralyzed traffic\r\nuntil several thousand state troops were put on guard. About the same\r\ntime, there were outbreaks in the Tennessee coal districts in protest\r\nagainst the employment of convict labor in the mines. Bands of strikers\r\nseized the mines, and in some places turned loose the convicts and\r\nin other places escorted them back to prison. As a result of this\r\ndisturbance, during 1892 state troops were permanently stationed in the\r\nmining districts, and eventually the convicts were put back at labor in\r\nthe mines.\r\n\r\nSuch occurrences infused bitterness into the campaign of 1892 and\r\nstrongly affected the election returns. Weaver carried Colorado, Idaho,\r\nKansas, and Nevada, and he got one electoral vote in Oregon and in\r\nNorth Dakota; but even if these twenty-two electoral votes had gone to\r\nHarrison, he would still have been far behind Cleveland, who received\r\n277 electoral votes out of a total of 444. Harrison ran only about\r\n381,000 behind Cleveland in the popular vote, but in four States, the\r\nDemocrats had nominated no electors and their votes had contributed to\r\nthe poll of over a million for Weaver. The Democratic victory was so\r\nsweeping that it gained the Senate as well as the House, and now for the\r\nfirst time a Democratic President was in accord with both branches of\r\nCongress. It was soon to appear, however, that this party accord was\r\nmerely nominal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE FREE SILVER REVOLT\r\n\r\nThe avenging consequences of the Silver Purchase Act moved so rapidly\r\nthat when John Griffin Carlisle took office as Secretary of the Treasury\r\nin 1893, the gold reserve had fallen to $100,982,410--only $982,410\r\nabove the limit indicated by the Act of 1882--and the public credit was\r\nshaken by the fact that it was an open question whether the government\r\nobligation to pay a dollar was worth so much or only one half so much.\r\nThe latter interpretation, indeed, seemed impending. The new Secretary's\r\nfirst step was to adopt the makeshift expedient of his predecessors. He\r\nappealed to the banks for gold and backed up by patriotic exhortation\r\nfrom the press, he did obtain almost twenty-five millions in gold in\r\nexchange for notes. But as even more notes drawing out the gold\r\nwere presented for redemption, the Secretary's efforts were no more\r\nsuccessful than carrying water in a sieve.\r\n\r\nOf the notes presented for redemption during March and April, nearly\r\none-half were treasury notes of 1890, which by law the Secretary might\r\nredeem \"in gold or silver coin at his discretion.\" The public was now\r\nalarmed by a rumor that Secretary Carlisle, who while in Congress had\r\nvoted for free silver, would resort to silver payments on this class of\r\nnotes, and regarded his statements as being noncommittal on the point.\r\nPopular alarm was, to some extent, dispelled by a statement from\r\nPresident Cleveland, on the 23rd of April, declaring flatly and\r\nunmistakably that redemption in gold would be maintained. But the\r\nfinancial situation throughout the country was such that nothing could\r\nstave off the impending panic. Failures were increasing in number, some\r\nlarge firms broke under the strain, and the final stroke came on the 5th\r\nof May when the National Cordage Company went into bankruptcy. As often\r\nhappens in the history of panics, the event was trivial in comparison\r\nwith the consequences. This company was of a type that is the reproach\r\nof American jurisprudence--the marauding corporation. In the very month\r\nin which it failed, it declared a large cash dividend. Its stock, which\r\nhad sold at 147 in January, fell in May to below ten dollars a share.\r\nThough the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company, which failed\r\nin February, had a capital of $40,000,000 and a debt of more than\r\n$125,000,000, the market did not break completely under that strain. The\r\nNational Cordage had a capital of $20,000,000 and liabilities of only\r\n$10,000,000, but its collapse brought down with it the whole structure\r\nof credit. A general movement of liquidation set in, which throughout\r\nthe West was so violent as to threaten general bankruptcy. Nearly all\r\nof the national bank failures were in the West and South, and still more\r\nextensive was the wreck of state banks and private banks. It had been\r\nthe practice of country banks, while firmly maintaining local rates, to\r\nkeep the bulk of their resources on deposit with city banks at two\r\nper cent. This practice now proved to be a fatal entanglement to many\r\ninstitutions. There were instances in which country banks were forced\r\nto suspend, though cash resources were actually on the way to them from\r\ndepository centers.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  Out of 158 national bank failures during the year, 153 were in\r\nthe West and South. In addition there went down 172 state banks, 177\r\nprivate banks, 47 savings banks, 13 loan and trust companies, and 6\r\nmortgage companies.\r\n\r\nEven worse than the effect of these numerous failures on the business\r\nsituation was the derangement which occurred in the currency supply. The\r\ncirculating medium was almost wholly composed of bank notes, treasury\r\nnotes, and treasury certificates issued against gold and silver in the\r\nTreasury, coin being little in use except as fractional currency. Bank\r\nnotes were essentially treasury certificates issued upon deposits of\r\ngovernment bonds. In effect, the circulating medium was composed of\r\ngovernment securities reduced to handy bits. Usually, a bank panic tends\r\nto bring note issues into rapid circulation for what they will fetch,\r\nbut in this new situation, people preferred to impound the notes, which\r\nthey knew to be good whatever happened so long as the Government\r\nheld out. Private hoarding became so general that currency tended to\r\ndisappear. Between September 30, 1892 and October 31, 1893, the amount\r\nof deposits in the national banks shrank over $496,000,000. Trade was\r\nreduced to making use of the methods of primitive barter, though the\r\nemergency was met to some extent by the use of checks and clearinghouse\r\ncertificates. In many New England manufacturing towns, for example,\r\nchecks for use in trade were drawn in denominations from one dollar\r\nup to twenty. In some cases, corporations paid off their employees in\r\nchecks drawn on their own treasurers which served as local currency. In\r\nsome Southern cities, clearing-house certificates in small denominations\r\nwere issued for general circulation--in Birmingham, Alabama, for sums as\r\nsmall as twenty-five cents. It is worth noting that a premium was\r\npaid as readily for notes as for gold; indeed, the New York \"Financial\r\nChronicle\" reported that the premium on currency was from two to three\r\nper cent, while the premium on gold was only one and one half per cent.\r\nBefore the panic had ended, the extraordinary spectacle was presented of\r\ngold coins serving as a medium of trade because treasury notes and bank\r\nnotes were still hoarded. These peculiarities of the situation had a\r\ndeep effect upon the popular attitude towards the measures recommended\r\nby the Administration.\r\n\r\nWhile this devastating panic was raging over all the country, President\r\nCleveland was beset by troubles that were both public and personal. He\r\nwas under heavy pressure from the office seekers. They came singly or in\r\ngroups and under the escort of Congressmen, some of whom performed such\r\nservice several times a day. The situation became so intolerable that\r\non the 8th of May President Cleveland issued an executive order setting\r\nforth that \"a due regard for public duty, which must be neglected if\r\npresent conditions continue, and an observance of the limitations placed\r\nupon human endurance, oblige me to decline, from and after this date,\r\nall personal interviews with those seeking office.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Washington papers, this sensible decision was received\r\nwith a tremendous outburst of indignation. The President was denounced\r\nfor shutting his doors upon the people who had elected him, and he was\r\nespecially severely criticized for the closing sentence of his order\r\nstating that \"applicants for office will only prejudice their prospects\r\nby repeated importunity and by remaining at Washington to await\r\nresults.\" This order was branded as an arbitrary exercise of power\r\ncompelling free American citizens to choose exile or punishment, and\r\nwas featured in the newspapers all over the country. The hubbub became\r\nsufficient to extract from Cleveland's private secretary an explanatory\r\nstatement pointing out that in the President's day a regular allotment\r\nof time was made for congressional and business callers other than the\r\noffice seekers, for whom a personal interview was of no value since the\r\ndetails of their cases could not be remembered. \"What was said in behalf\r\nof one man was driven out of mind by the remarks of the next man in\r\nline,\" whereas testimonials sent through the mails went on file and\r\nreceived due consideration. \"So many hours a day having been given up\r\nto the reception of visitors, it has been necessary, in order to keep up\r\nwith the current work, for the President to keep at his desk from early\r\nin the morning into the small hours of the next morning. Now that may\r\ndo for a week or for a month, but there is a limit to human physical\r\nendurance, and it has about been reached.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the distracting conditions under which President Cleveland had\r\nto deal with the tremendous difficulties of national import which beset\r\nhim. There were allusions in his inaugural address which showed how\r\nkeenly he felt the weight of his many responsibilities, and there is a\r\ntouch of pathos in his remark that he took \"much comfort in remembering\r\nthat my countrymen are just and generous, and in the assurance that they\r\nwill not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service deserve\r\ntheir forbearance and approval.\" This hope of Cleveland's was eventually\r\njustified, but not until after his public career had ended; meanwhile\r\nhe had to undergo a storm of censure so blasting that it was more like\r\na volcanic rain of fire and lava than any ordinary tempest, however\r\nviolent.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, President Cleveland called an extra session of\r\nCongress for the 7th of August \"to the end that the people may be\r\nrelieved through legislation from present and impending danger and\r\ndistress.\" In recent years, the fact has come to light that his health\r\nwas at that time in a condition so precarious that it would have caused\r\nwild excitement had the truth become known, for only his life stood in\r\nthe way of a free silver President. On the same day on which he issued\r\nhis call for the extra session, President Cleveland left for New York\r\nostensibly for a yachting trip, but while the yacht was steaming slowly\r\nup the East River, he was in the hands of surgeons who removed the\r\nentire left upper jaw. On the 5th of July they performed another\r\noperation in the same region for the removal of any tissues which\r\nmight possibly have been infected. These operations were so completely\r\nsuccessful that the President was fitted with an artificial jaw of\r\nvulcanized rubber which enabled him to speak without any impairment of\r\nthe strength and clearness of his voice.* Immediately after this severe\r\ntrial, which he bore with calm fortitude, Cleveland had to battle with\r\nthe raging silver faction, strong in its legislative position through\r\nits control of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  For details, see New York \"Times,\" Sept. 21, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met, the only legislation which the President had to\r\npropose was the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, although he remarked\r\nthat \"tariff reform has lost nothing of its immediate and permanent\r\nimportance and must in the near future engage the attention\r\nof Congress.\" It was a natural inference, therefore, that the\r\nAdministration had no financial policy beyond putting a stop to treasury\r\npurchases of silver, and there was a vehement outcry against an action\r\nwhich seemed to strike against the only visible source of additional\r\ncurrency. President Cleveland was even denounced as a tool of Wall\r\nStreet, and the panic was declared to be the result of a plot of British\r\nand American bankers against silver.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the 28th of August, the House passed a repeal bill by a\r\nvote of 240 to 110. There was a long and violent struggle in the\r\nSenate, where such representative anomalies existed that Nevada with\r\na population of 45,761 had the same voting power as New York with\r\n5,997,853. Hence, at first, it looked as if the passage of a repeal bill\r\nmight be impossible. Finally, the habit of compromise prevailed and a\r\nmajority agreement was reached postponing the date of repeal for twelve\r\nor eighteen months during which the treasury stock of silver bullion\r\nwas to be turned into coin. Cleveland made it known that he would not\r\nconsent to such an arrangement, and the issue was thereafter narrowed\r\nto that of unconditional repeal of the Silver Purchase Act. The Senators\r\nfrom the silver-mining States carried on an obstinate filibuster and\r\nrefused to allow the question to come to a vote, until their arrogance\r\nwas gradually toned down by the discovery that the liberty to dump\r\nsilver on the Treasury had become a precarious mining asset. The law\r\nprovided for the purchase of 4,500,000 ounces a month, \"or, so much\r\nthereof as may be offered at the market price.\" Secretary Carlisle found\r\nthat offers were frequently higher in price than New York and London\r\nquotations, and by rejecting them he made a considerable reduction in\r\nthe amount purchased. Moreover, the silver ranks began to divide on the\r\nquestion of policy. The Democratic silver Senators wished to enlarge the\r\ncirculating medium by increasing the amount of coinage, and they did not\r\nfeel the same interest in the mere stacking of bullion in the Treasury\r\nthat possessed the mining camp Senators on the Republican side.\r\nWhen these two elements separated on the question of policy, the\r\nrepresentatives of the mining interests recognized the hopelessness of\r\npreventing a vote upon the proposed repeal of the silver purchase act.\r\nOn the 30th of October, the Senate passed the repeal with no essential\r\ndifference from the House bill, and the bill became law on November 1,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nBut although the repeal bill stopped the silver drain upon the Treasury,\r\nit did not relieve the empty condition to which the Treasury had\r\nbeen reduced. It was manifest that, if the gold standard was to be\r\nmaintained, the Treasury stock of gold would have to be replenished. The\r\nSpecie Resumption Act of 1875 authorized the sale of bonds \"to prepare\r\nand provide for\" redemption of notes in coin, but the only classes of\r\nbonds which it authorized were those at four per cent payable after\r\nthirty years, four and a half per cent payable after fifteen years, and\r\nfive per cent payable after ten years from date. For many years, the\r\nGovernment had been able to borrow at lower rates but had in vain\r\nbesought Congress to grant the necessary authority. The Government now\r\nappealed once more to Congress for authority to issue bonds at a lower\r\nrate of interest. Carlisle, the Secretary of the Treasury, addressed\r\na letter to the Senate committee of finance, setting forth the\r\ngreat saving that would be thus effected. Then ensued what must be\r\nacknowledged to be a breakdown in constitutional government. Immediately\r\nafter a committee meeting on January 16, 1894, the Chairman, Senator\r\nVoorhees, issued a public statement in which he said that \"it would\r\nbe trifling with a very grave affair to pretend that new legislation\r\nconcerning the issue of bonds can be accomplished at this time, and\r\nin the midst of present elements and parties in public life, with\r\nelaborate, extensive, and practically indefinite debate.\" Therefore,\r\nhe held that \"it will be wiser, safer and better for the financial\r\nand business interests of the country to rely upon existing law.\" This\r\nplainly amounted to a public confession that Congress was so organized\r\nas to be incapable of providing for the public welfare.\r\n\r\nCarlisle decided to sell the ten-year class of bonds, compensating for\r\ntheir high interest rate by exacting such a premium as would reduce\r\nto three per cent the actual yield to holders. On January 17, 1894,\r\nhe offered bonds to the amount of fifty millions, but bids came in so\r\nslowly that he found it necessary to visit New York to make a personal\r\nappeal to a number of leading bankers to exert themselves to prevent the\r\nfailure of the sale. As a result of these efforts, the entire issue\r\nwas sold at a premium of $8,660,917, and the treasury stock of gold was\r\nbrought up to $107,440,802.\r\n\r\nThen followed what is probably the most curious chapter in the financial\r\nhistory of modern times. Only gold was accepted by the Treasury in\r\npayment of bonds; but gold could be obtained by offering treasury notes\r\nfor redemption. The Act of 1878 expressly provided that, when redeemed,\r\nthese notes \"shall not be retired, canceled, or destroyed, but they\r\nshall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation.\" The\r\nGovernment, as President Cleveland pointed out, was \"forced to redeem\r\nwithout redemption and pay without acquittance.\" These conditions set up\r\nagainst the Treasury an endless chain by which note redemptions drained\r\nout the gold as fast as bond sales poured it in. In a message to\r\nCongress on January 28, 1895, President Cleveland pointed out that the\r\nTreasury had redeemed more than $300,000,000 of its notes in gold,\r\nand yet these notes were all still outstanding. Appeals to Congress to\r\nremedy the situation proved absolutely fruitless, and the only choice\r\nleft to the President was to continue pumping operations or abandon the\r\ngold standard, as the silver faction in Congress desired. By February\r\n8, 1895, the stock of gold in the Treasury was down to $41,340,181. The\r\nAdministration met this sharp emergency by a contract with a New York\r\nbanking syndicate which agreed to deliver 3,500,000 ounces of standard\r\ngold coin, at least one half to be obtained in Europe. The syndicate\r\nwas, moreover, to \"exert all financial influence and make all legitimate\r\nefforts to protect the Treasury of the United States against the\r\nwithdrawals of gold pending the complete performance of the contract.\"\r\n\r\nThe replenishing of the Treasury by this contract was, however, only\r\na temporary relief. By January 6, 1896, the gold reserve was down to\r\n$61,251,710. The Treasury now offered $100,000,000 of the four per\r\ncent bonds for sale and put forth special efforts to make subscription\r\npopular. Blanks for bids were displayed in all post-offices, a circular\r\nletter was sent to all national banks, the movement was featured in the\r\nnewspapers, and the result was that 4635 bids were received coming from\r\nforty-seven States and Territories, and amounting to $526,970,000.\r\nThis great oversubscription powerfully upheld the public credit\r\nand, thereafter, the position of the Treasury remained secure; but\r\naltogether, $262,000,000 in bonds had been sold to maintain its\r\nsolvency.\r\n\r\nConsideration of the management of American foreign relations during\r\nthis period does not enter into the scope of this book, but the fact\r\nshould be noted that the anxieties of public finance were aggravated by\r\nthe menace of war.* In the boundary dispute between British Guiana\r\nand Venezuela, President Cleveland proposed arbitration, but this was\r\nrefused by the British Government. President Cleveland, whose foreign\r\npolicy was always vigorous and decisive, then sent a message to Congress\r\non December 17, 1895, describing the British position as an infringement\r\nof the Monroe Doctrine and recommending that a commission should be\r\nappointed by the United States to conduct an independent inquiry to\r\ndetermine the boundary line in dispute. He significantly remarked that\r\n\"in making these recommendations I am fully alive to the responsibility\r\nincurred and keenly realize all the consequences that may follow.\" The\r\npossibility of conflict, thus hinted, was averted when Great Britain\r\nagreed to arbitration, but meanwhile, American securities in great\r\nnumbers were thrown upon the market through sales of European account\r\nand added to the financial strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  See \"The Path of Empire,\" by Carl Russell Fish (in \"The\r\nChronicles of America\").\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invincible determination which President Cleveland showed in this\r\nmemorable struggle to maintain the gold standard will always remain his\r\nsecurest title to renown, but the admiration due to his constancy of\r\nsoul cannot be extended to his handling of the financial problem. It\r\nappears, from his own account, that he was not well advised as to the\r\nextent and nature of his financial resources. He did not know until\r\nFebruary 7, 1895, when Mr. J. P. Morgan called his attention to the\r\nfact, that among the general powers of the Secretary of the Treasury is\r\nthe provision that he \"may purchase coin with any of the bonds or notes\r\nof the United States authorized by law, at such rates and upon such\r\nterms as he may deem most advantageous to the public interest.\" The\r\nPresident was urged to proceed under this law to buy $100,000,000 in\r\ngold at a fixed price, paying for it in bonds. This advice Cleveland did\r\nnot accept at the time, but in later years he said that it was \"a wise\r\nsuggestion,\" and that he had \"always regretted that it was not adopted.\"\r\n\r\nBut apart from any particular error in the management of the Treasury,\r\nthe general policy of the Administration was much below the requirements\r\nof the situation. The panic came to an end in the fall of 1893, much as\r\na great conflagration expires through having reached all the material on\r\nwhich it can feed, but leaving a scene of desolation behind it. Thirteen\r\ncommercial houses out of every thousand doing business had failed.\r\nWithin two years, nearly one fourth of the total railway capitalization\r\nof the country had gone into bankruptcy, involving an exposure of\r\nfalsified accounts sufficient to shatter public confidence in the\r\nmethods of corporations. Industrial stagnation and unemployment were\r\nprevalent throughout the land. Meanwhile, the congressional situation\r\nwas plainly such that only a great uprising of public opinion could\r\nbreak the hold of the silver faction. The standing committee system,\r\nwhich controls the gateways of legislation, is made up on a system of\r\nparty apportionment whose effect is to give an insurgent faction of the\r\nmajority the balance of power, and this opportunity for mischief was\r\nunsparingly used by the silver faction.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation could not be successfully encountered save by a policy\r\naimed distinctly at accomplishing a redress of popular grievances. But\r\nsuch a policy, President Cleveland failed to conceive. In his inaugural\r\naddress, he indicated in a general way the policy pursued throughout\r\nhis term when he said, \"I shall to the best of my ability and within\r\nmy sphere of duty preserve the Constitution by loyally protecting every\r\ngrant of Federal power it contains, by defending all its restraints\r\nwhen attacked by impatience and restlessness, and by enforcing its\r\nlimitations and reservations in favor of the states and the people.\"\r\nThis statement sets forth a low view of governmental function and\r\npractically limits its sphere to the office of the policeman, whose\r\nchief concern is to suppress disorder. Statesmanship should go deeper\r\nand should labor in a constructive way to remove causes of disorder.\r\n\r\nAn examination of President Cleveland's state papers show that his\r\nfirst concern was always to relieve the Government from its financial\r\nembarrassments; whereas the first concern of the people was naturally\r\nand properly to find relief from their own embarrassments. In the\r\nlast analysis, the people were not made for the convenience of the\r\nGovernment, but the Government was made for the convenience of the\r\npeople, and this truth was not sufficiently recognized in the policy\r\nof Cleveland's administration. His guiding principle was stated, in the\r\nannual message, December 3, 1894, as follows: \"The absolute divorcement\r\nof the Government from the business of banking is the ideal relationship\r\nof the Government to the circulation of the currency of the country.\"\r\nThat ideal, however, is unattainable in any civilized country. The only\r\ngreat state in which it has ever been actually adopted is China, and the\r\nresults were not such as to commend the system. The policy which yields\r\nthe greatest practical benefits is that which makes it the duty of the\r\nGovernment to supervise and regulate the business of banking and to\r\nattend to currency supply; and the currency troubles of the American\r\npeople were not removed until eventually their Government accepted and\r\nacted upon this view.\r\n\r\nNot until his message of December 3, 1894, did President Cleveland make\r\nany recommendation going to the root of the trouble, which was, after\r\nall, the need of adequate provision for the currency supply. In that\r\nmessage, he sketched a plan devised by Secretary Carlisle, allowing\r\nnational banks to issue notes up to seventy-five per cent of their\r\nactual capital and providing also, under certain conditions, for the\r\nissue of circulating notes by state banks without taxation. This plan,\r\nhe said, \"furnishes a basis for a very great improvement in our present\r\nbanking and currency system.\" But in his subsequent messages, he kept\r\nurging that \"the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not\r\ndawn upon us until our Government abandons the banking business.\" To\r\neffect this aim, he urged that all treasury notes should be \"withdrawn\r\nfrom circulation and canceled,\" and he declared that he was \"of opinion\r\nthat we have placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting\r\nthe currency.\" Such proposals addressed to a people agonized by actual\r\nscarcity of currency were utterly impracticable, nor from any point of\r\nview can they be pronounced to have been sound in the circumstances then\r\nexisting. Until the banking system was reformed, there was real danger\r\nof contracting the currency by a withdrawal of treasury notes. President\r\nCleveland was making a mistake to which reformers are prone; he was\r\ntaking the second step before he had taken the first. The realization\r\non the part of others that his efforts were misdirected not only made\r\nit impossible for him to obtain any financial legislation but actually\r\nfortified the position of the free silver advocates by allowing them the\r\nadvantage of being the only political party with any positive plans\r\nfor the redress of popular grievances. Experts became convinced that\r\nstatesmen at Washington were as incompetent to deal with the banking\r\nproblems as they had been in dealing with reconstruction problems and\r\nthat, in like manner, the regulation of banking had better be abandoned\r\nto the States. A leading organ of the business world pointed out that\r\nsome of the state systems of note issue had been better than the system\r\nof issuing notes through national banks which had been substituted in\r\n1862; and it urged that the gains would exceed all disadvantages if\r\nstate banks were again allowed to act as sources of currency supply by\r\na repeal of the government tax of ten per cent on their circulation.\r\nBut nothing came of this suggestion, which was, indeed, a counsel\r\nof despair. It took many years of struggle and more experiences of\r\nfinancial panic and industrial distress to produce a genuine reform in\r\nthe system of currency supply.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland's messages suggest that he made up his mind to do\r\nwhat he conceived to be his own duty regardless of consequences, whereas\r\nan alert consideration of possible consequences is an integral part of\r\nthe duties of statesmanship. He persevered in his pension vetoes without\r\nmaking any movement towards a change of system, and the only permanent\r\neffect of his crusade was an alteration of procedure on the part of\r\nCongress in order to evade the veto power. Individual pension bills are\r\nstill introduced by the thousand at every session of Congress, but since\r\nPresident Cleveland's time all those approved have been included in one\r\nomnibus bill, known as a \"pork barrel bill,\" which thus collects enough\r\nvotes from all quarters to ensure passage.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland found another topic for energetic remonstrance in\r\na system of privilege that had been built up at the expense of the\r\npost-office department. Printed matter in the form of books was charged\r\neight cents a pound, but in periodical form only one cent a pound. This\r\ndiscrimination against books has had marked effect upon the quality of\r\nAmerican literature, lowering its tone and encouraging the publication\r\nof many cheap magazines. President Cleveland gave impressive statistics\r\nshowing the loss to the Government in transporting periodical\r\npublications, \"including trashy and even harmful literature.\" Letter\r\nmails weighing 65,337,343 pounds yielded a revenue of $60,624,464.\r\nPeriodical publications weighing 348,988,648 pounds yielded a revenue of\r\n$2,996,403. Cleveland's agitation of the subject under conditions then\r\nexisting could not, however, have any practical effect save to affront\r\nan influential interest abundantly able to increase the President's\r\ndifficulties by abuse and misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. LAW AND ORDER UPHELD\r\n\r\nWhile President Cleveland was struggling with the difficult situation\r\nin the Treasury, popular unrest was increasing in violence. Certain\r\nstartling political developments now gave fresh incitement to the\r\ninsurgent temper which was spreading among the masses. The relief\r\nmeasure at the forefront of President Cleveland's policy was tariff\r\nreform, and upon this the legislative influence of the Administration\r\nwas concentrated as soon as the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act had\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe House leader in tariff legislation at that time was a man of\r\nexceptionally high character and ability. William L. Wilson was\r\nPresident of the University of West Virginia when he was elected to\r\nCongress in 1882, and he had subsequently retained his seat more by the\r\npersonal respect he inspired than through the normal strength of his\r\nparty in his district. The ordinary rule of seniority was by consent set\r\naside to make him chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He aimed\r\nto produce a measure which would treat existing interests with some\r\nconsideration for their needs. In the opinion of F. W. Taussig, an\r\nexpert economist, the bill as passed by the House on February 1,\r\n1894, \"was simply a moderation of the protective duties\" with the one\r\nexception of the removal of the duty on wool. Ever since 1887, it had\r\nbeen a settled Democratic policy to put wool on the free list, in order\r\nto give American manufacturers the same advantage in the way of raw\r\nmaterial which those of every other country enjoyed, even in quarters\r\nwhere a protective tariff was stiffly applied.\r\n\r\nThe scenes that now ensued in the Senate showed that arbitrary rule\r\nmay be readily exercised under the forms of popular government. Senator\r\nMatthew S. Quay of Pennsylvania, a genial, scholarly cynic who\r\nsought his ends by any available means and who disdained hypocritical\r\npretenses, made it known that he was in a position to block all\r\nlegislation unless his demands were conceded. He prepared an everlasting\r\nspeech, which he proceeded to deliver by installments in an effort to\r\nconsume the time of the Senate until it would become necessary to yield\r\nto him in order to proceed with the consideration of the bill. His\r\nmethod was to read matter to the Senate until he was tired and then\r\nto have some friend act for him while he rested. According to the\r\n\"Washington Star,\" Senator Gallinger was \"his favorite helper in this,\r\nfor he has a good round voice that never tires, and he likes to read\r\naloud.\" The thousands of pages of material which Senator Quay had\r\ncollected for use, and the apparently inexhaustible stores upon which\r\nhe was drawing, were the subject of numerous descriptive articles in\r\nthe newspapers of the day. Senator Quay's tactics were so successful,\r\nindeed, that he received numerous congratulatory telegrams from those\r\nwhose interests he was championing. They had been defeated at the polls\r\nin their attempt to control legislation, and defeated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, but now they were victorious in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe methods of Senator Quay were tried by other Senators on both sides,\r\nthough they were less frank in their avowal. After the struggle was\r\nover, Senator Vest of Missouri, who had been in charge of the bill,\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\"I have not an enemy in the world whom I would place in the position\r\nthat I have occupied as a member of the Finance Committee under the\r\nrules of the Senate. I would put no man where I have been, to be\r\nblackmailed and driven in order to pass a bill that I believe is\r\nnecessary to the welfare of the country, by Senators who desired to\r\nforce amendments upon me against my better judgment and compel me to\r\ndecide the question whether I will take any bill at all or a bill which\r\nhad been distorted by their views and objects. Sir, the Senate 'lags\r\nsuperfluous on the stage' today with the American people, because in an\r\nage of progress, advance, and aggressive reform, we sit here day after\r\nday and week after week, while copies of the census reports, almanacs,\r\nand even novels are read to us, and under our rules there is no help for\r\nthe majority except to listen or leave the chamber.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of the bill in anything like the form in which it reached\r\nthe Senate was plainly impossible without a radical change in the rules,\r\nand on neither side of the chamber was there any real desire for an\r\namendment of procedure. A number of the Democratic Senators who believed\r\nthat it was desirable to keep on good terms with business interests\r\nwere, in reality, opposed to the House bill. Their efforts to control\r\nthe situation were favored by the habitual disposition of the Senate,\r\nwhen dealing with business interests, to decide questions by private\r\nconference and personal agreements, while maintaining a surface show of\r\nparty controversy. Hence, Senator Gorman of Maryland was able to\r\nmake arrangements for the passage of what became known as the Gorman\r\nCompromise Bill, which radically altered the character of the original\r\nmeasure by the adoption of 634 amendments. It passed the Senate on the\r\n3rd of July by a vote of thirty-nine to thirty-four.\r\n\r\nThe next step was the appointment of a committee of conference between\r\nthe two Houses, but the members for the House showed an unusual\r\ndetermination to resist the will of the Senate, and on the 19th of July,\r\nthe conferees reported that they had failed to reach an agreement. When\r\nPresident Cleveland permitted the publication of a letter which he had\r\nwritten to Chairman Wilson condemning the Senate bill, the fact was\r\ndisclosed that the influence of the Administration had been used to\r\nstiffen the opposition of the House. Senator Gorman and other Democratic\r\nSenators made sharp replies, and the party quarrel became so bitter that\r\nit was soon evident that no sort of tariff bill could pass the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe House leaders now reaped a great advantage from the Reed rules\r\nto the adoption of which they had been so bitterly opposed. Availing\r\nthemselves of the effective means of crushing obstruction provided by\r\nthe powers of the Rules Committee, in one day they passed the Tariff\r\nBill as amended by the Senate, which eventually became law, and then\r\npassed separate bills putting on the free list coal, barbed wire, and\r\nsugar. These bills had no effect other than to put on record the opinion\r\nof the House, as they were of course subsequently held up in the Senate.\r\nThis unwonted insubordination on the part of the House excited much\r\nangry comment from dissatisfied Senators. President Cleveland was\r\naccused of unconstitutional interference in the proceedings of Congress;\r\nand the House was blamed for submitting to the Senate and passing the\r\namended bill without going through the usual form of conference and\r\nadjustment of differences. Senator Sherman of Ohio remarked that \"there\r\nare many cases in the bill where enactment was not intended by the\r\nSenate. For instance, innumerable amendments were put on by Senators\r\non both sides of the chamber... to give the Committee of Conference a\r\nchance to think of the matter, and they are all adopted, whatever may be\r\ntheir language or the incongruity with other parts of the bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe bitter feeling, excited by the summary mode of enactment on the part\r\nof the House, was intensified by President Cleveland's treatment of the\r\nmeasure. While he did not veto it, he would not sign it but allowed it\r\nto become law by expiration of the ten days in which he could reject\r\nit. He set forth his reasons in a letter on August 27, 1894, to\r\nRepresentative Catchings of Missouri, in which he sharply commented\r\nupon the incidents accompanying the passage of the bill and in which he\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\"I take my place with the rank and file of the Democratic party who\r\nbelieve in tariff reform, and who know what it is; who refuse to accept\r\nthe result embodied in this bill as the close of the war; who are not\r\nblinded to the fact that the livery of Democratic tariff reform has been\r\nstolen and used in the service of Republican protection; and who have\r\nmarked the places where the deadly blight of treason has blasted the\r\ncounsels of the brave in their hour of might.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was written throughout with a fervor rare in President\r\nCleveland's papers, and it had a scorching effect. Senator Gorman and\r\nsome other Democratic Senators lost their seats as soon as the people\r\nhad a chance to express their will.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the tariff struggle greatly increased popular\r\ndiscontent with the way in which the government of the country was\r\nbeing conducted at Washington. It became a common belief that the actual\r\nsystem of government was that the trusts paid the campaign expenses\r\nof the politicians and in return the politicians allowed the trusts\r\nto frame the tariff schedules. Evidence in support of this view was\r\nfurnished by testimony taken in the investigation of the sugar scandal\r\nin the summer of 1894. Charges had been made in the newspapers that some\r\nSenators had speculated in sugar stocks during the time when they were\r\nengaged in legislation affecting the value of those stocks. Some of them\r\nadmitted the fact of stock purchases, but denied that their legislative\r\naction had been guided by their investments. In the course of the\r\ninvestigation, H. O. Havemeyer, the head of the Sugar Trust, admitted\r\nthat it was the practice to subsidize party management. \"It is my\r\nimpression,\" he said, \"that whenever there is a dominant party, wherever\r\nthe majority is large, that is the party that gets the contribution\r\nbecause that is the party which controls the local matters.\" He\r\nexplained that this system was carried on because the company had large\r\ninterests which needed protection, and he declared \"every individual and\r\ncorporation and firm, trust, or whatever you call it, does these things\r\nand we do them.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the tariff struggle, a movement took place which was an evidence\r\nof popular discontent of another sort. At first it caused great\r\nuneasiness, but eventually the manifestation became more grotesque than\r\nalarming. Jacob S. Coxey of Massillon, Ohio, a smart specimen of the\r\nAmerican type of handy business man, announced that he intended to\r\nsend a petition to Washington wearing boots so that it could not be\r\nconveniently shelved by being stuck away in a pigeonhole. He thereupon\r\nproceeded to lead a march of the unemployed, which started from\r\nMassillon on March 25, 1894, with about one hundred men in the ranks.\r\nThese crusaders Coxey described as the \"Army of the Commonweal of\r\nChrist,\" and their purpose was to proclaim the wants of the people on\r\nthe steps of the Capitol on the 1st of May. The leader of this band\r\ncalled upon the honest working classes to join him, and he gained\r\nrecruits as he advanced. Similar movements started in the Western\r\nStates. \"The United States Industrial Army,\" headed by one Frye, started\r\nfrom Los Angeles and at one time numbered from six to eight hundred men;\r\nthey reached St. Louis by swarming on the freight trains of the Southern\r\nPacific road and thereafter continued on foot. A band under a leader\r\nnamed Kelly started from San Francisco on the 4th of April and by\r\ncommandeering freight trains reached Council Bluffs, Iowa, whence they\r\nmarched to Des Moines. There, they went into camp with at one time as\r\nmany as twelve hundred men. They eventually obtained flatboats, on which\r\nthey floated down the Mississippi and then pushed up the Ohio to a point\r\nin Kentucky whence they proceeded on foot. Attempts on the part of such\r\nbands to seize trains brought them into conflict with the authorities\r\nat some points. For instance, a detachment of regular troops in Montana\r\ncaptured a band coming East on a stolen Northern Pacific train, and\r\nmilitia had to be called out to rescue a train from a band at Mount\r\nSterling, Ohio.\r\n\r\nCoxey's own army never amounted to more than a few hundred, but it\r\nwas more in the public eye. It had a large escort of newspaper\r\ncorrespondents who gave picturesque accounts of the march to Washington;\r\nand Coxey himself took advantage of this gratuitous publicity to express\r\nhis views. Among other measures, he urged that since good roads and\r\nmoney were both greatly needed by the country at large, the Government\r\nshould issue $500,000,000 in \"non-interest bearing bonds\" to be used\r\nin employing workers in the improvement of the roads. After an orderly\r\nmarch through parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, in the course\r\nof which his men received many donations of supplies from places through\r\nwhich they passed, Coxey and his army arrived at Washington on the 1st\r\nof May and were allowed to parade to the Capitol under police escort\r\nalong a designated route. When Coxey left the ranks, however, to cut\r\nacross the grass to the Capitol, he was arrested on the technical charge\r\nof trespassing. The army went into camp, but on the 12th of May the\r\nauthorities forced the men to move out of the District. They thereupon\r\ntook up quarters in Maryland and shifted about from time to time.\r\nDetachments from the Western bands arrived during June and July, but\r\nthe total number encamped about Washington probably never exceeded a\r\nthousand. Difficulties in obtaining supplies and inevitable collisions\r\nwith the authorities caused the band gradually to disperse. Coxey, after\r\nhis short term in jail, traveled about the country trying to stir\r\nup interest in his aims and to obtain supplies. The novelty of his\r\nmovement, however, had worn off, and results were so poor that on the\r\n26th of July he issued a statement saying he could do no more and that\r\nwhat was left of the army would have to shift for itself. In Maryland,\r\nthe authorities arrested a number of Coxey's \"soldiers\" as vagrants. On\r\nthe 11th of August, a detachment of Virginia militia drove across the\r\nPotomac the remnants of the Kelly and Frye armies, which were then taken\r\nin charge by the district authorities. They were eventually supplied by\r\nthe Government with free transportation to their homes.\r\n\r\nOf more serious import than these marchings and campings, as evidence of\r\npopular unrest, were the activities of organized labor which now began\r\nto attract public attention. The Knights of Labor were declining in\r\nnumbers and influence. The attempt, which their national officers made\r\nin January, 1894, to get out an injunction to restrain the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury from making bond sales really facilitated Carlisle's effort\r\nby obtaining judicial sanction for the issue. Labor disturbances now\r\nfollowed in quick succession. In April, there was a strike on the Great\r\nNorthern Railroad, which for a long time almost stopped traffic between\r\nSt. Paul and Seattle. Local strikes in the mining regions of West\r\nVirginia and Colorado, and in the coke fields of Western Pennsylvania,\r\nwere attended by conflicts with the authorities and some loss of life.\r\nA general strike of the bituminous coal miners of the whole country was\r\nordered by the United Mine Workers on the 21st of April, and called out\r\nnumbers variously estimated at from one hundred and twenty-five thousand\r\nto two hundred thousand; but by the end of July the strike had ended in\r\na total failure.\r\n\r\nAll the disturbances that abounded throughout the country were\r\novershadowed, however, by a tremendous struggle which centered in\r\nChicago and which brought about new and most impressive developments\r\nof national authority. In June, 1893, Eugene V. Debs, the\r\nsecretary-treasurer of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, resigned\r\nhis office and set about organizing a new general union of railroad\r\nemployees in antagonism to the Brotherhoods, which were separate unions\r\nof particular classes of workers. He formed the American Railway Union\r\nand succeeded in instituting 465 local lodges which claimed a membership\r\nof one hundred and fifty thousand. In March, 1894, Pullman Company\r\nemployees joined the new union. On the 11th of May, a class of workers\r\nin this company's shops at Pullman, Illinois, struck for an increase\r\nof wages, and on the 21st of June the officers of the American Railway\r\nUnion ordered its members to refuse to handle trains containing Pullman\r\ncars unless the demands of the strikers were granted. Although neither\r\nthe American Federation of Labor nor the Brotherhoods endorsed this\r\nsympathetic strike, it soon spread over a vast territory and was\r\naccompanied by savage rioting and bloody conflicts. In the suburbs\r\nof Chicago the mobs burned numerous cars and did much damage to other\r\nproperty. The losses inflicted on property throughout the country by\r\nthis strike have been estimated at $80,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe strikers were undoubtedly encouraged in resorting to force by the\r\nsympathetic attitude which Governor Altgeld of Illinois showed towards\r\nthe cause of labor. The Knights of Labor and other organizations of\r\nworkingmen had passed resolutions complimenting the Governor on his\r\npardon of the Chicago anarchists, and the American Railway Union counted\r\nunduly upon his support in obtaining their ends. The situation was such\r\nas to cause the greatest consternation throughout the country, as there\r\nwas a widespread though erroneous belief that there was no way in which\r\nnational Government could take action to suppress disorder unless it was\r\ncalled upon by the Legislature, if it happened to be in session, or by\r\nthe Governor. But at this critical moment, the Illinois Legislature\r\nwas not in session, and Governor Altgeld refused to call for aid. For\r\na time, it therefore seemed that the strikers were masters of the\r\nsituation and that law and order were powerless before the mob.\r\n\r\nThere was an unusual feeling of relief throughout the country when word\r\ncame from Washington on the 1st of July that President Cleveland had\r\ncalled out the regular troops. Governor Altgeld sent a long telegram\r\nprotesting against sending federal troops into Illinois without any\r\nrequest from the authority of the State. But President Cleveland replied\r\nbriefly that the troops were not sent to interfere with state authority\r\nbut to enforce the laws of the United States, upon the demand of the\r\nPost Office Department that obstruction to the mails be removed, and\r\nupon the representations of judicial officers of the United States that\r\nprocesses of federal courts could not be executed through the ordinary\r\nmeans. In the face of what was regarded as federal interference, riot\r\nfor the moment blazed out more fiercely than ever, but the firm stand\r\ntaken by the President soon had its effect. On the 6th of July, Governor\r\nAltgeld ordered out the state militia which soon engaged in some sharp\r\nencounters with the strikers. On the next day, a force of regular troops\r\ndispersed a mob at Hammond, Indiana, with some loss of life. On the\r\n8th of July, President Cleveland issued a proclamation to the people of\r\nIllinois and of Chicago in particular, notifying them that those \"taking\r\npart with a riotous mob in forcibly resisting and obstructing the\r\nexecution of the laws of the United States... cannot be regarded\r\notherwise than as public enemies,\" and that \"while there will be no\r\nhesitation or vacillation in the decisive treatment of the guilty, this\r\nwarning is especially intended to protect and save the innocent.\"\r\nThe next day, he issued as energetic a proclamation against \"unlawful\r\nobstructions, combinations and assemblages of persons\" in North Dakota,\r\nMontana, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, California, Utah, and New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the American Railway Union, delegates from twenty-five\r\nunions connected with the American Federation of Labor met in Chicago\r\non the 12th of July, and Debs made an ardent appeal to them to call a\r\ngeneral strike of all labor organizations. But the conference decided\r\nthat \"it would be unwise and disastrous to the interests of labor to\r\nextend the strike any further than it had already gone\" and advised the\r\nstrikers to return to work. Thereafter, the strike rapidly collapsed,\r\nalthough martial law had to be proclaimed and, before quiet was\r\nrestored, some sharp conflicts still took place between federal troops\r\nand mobs at Sacramento and other points in California. On the 3rd of\r\nAugust, the American Railway Union acknowledged its defeat and called\r\noff the strike. Meanwhile, Debs and other leaders had been under\r\narrest for disobedience to injunctions issued by the federal courts.\r\nEventually, Debs was sentenced to jail for six months,* and the others\r\nfor three months. The cases were the occasion of much litigation in\r\nwhich the authority of the courts to intervene in labor disputes by\r\nissuing injunctions was on the whole sustained. The failure and collapse\r\nof the American Railway Union appears to have ended the career of Debs\r\nas a labor organizer, but he has since been active and prominent as a\r\nSocialist party leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  Under Section IV of the Anti-Trust Law of 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic approval of the energy and decision which President Cleveland\r\ndisplayed in handling the situation was so strong and general that it\r\nmomentarily quelled the factional spirit in Congress. Judge Thomas M.\r\nCooley, then, probably the most eminent authority on constitutional law,\r\nwrote a letter expressing \"unqualified satisfaction with every step\"\r\ntaken by the President \"in vindication of the national authority.\" Both\r\nthe Senate and the House adopted resolutions endorsing the prompt and\r\nvigorous measures of the Administration. The newspapers, too, joined in\r\nthe chorus of approval. A newspaper ditty which was widely circulated\r\nand was read by the President with pleasure and amusement ended a string\r\nof verses with the lines:\r\n\r\nThe railroad strike played merry hob, The land was set aflame; Could\r\nGrover order out the troops To block the striker's game? One Altgeld\r\nyelled excitedly, \"Such tactics I forbid; You can't trot out those\r\nsoldiers,\" yet That's just what Grover did.\r\n\r\nIn after years when people talk Of present stirring times, And of\r\nthe action needful to Sit down on public crimes, They'll all of them\r\nacknowledge then (The fact cannot be hid) That whatever was the best to\r\ndo Is just what Grover did.\r\n\r\nThis brief period of acclamation was, however, only a gleam of sunshine\r\nthrough the clouds before the night set in with utter darkness.\r\nRelations between President Cleveland and his party in the Senate had\r\nlong been disturbed by his refusal to submit to the Senate rule that\r\nnominations to office should be subject to the approval of the Senators\r\nfrom the State to which the nominees belonged. On January 15, 1894,\r\neleven Democrats voted with Senator David B. Hill to defeat a New York\r\nnominee for justice of the Supreme Court. President Cleveland then\r\nnominated another New York jurist against whom no objection could be\r\nurged regarding reputation or experience; but as this candidate was not\r\nSenator Hill's choice, the nomination was rejected, fourteen Democrats\r\nvoting with him against it. President Cleveland now availed himself of\r\na common Senate practice to discomfit Senator Hill. He nominated Senator\r\nWhite of Louisiana, who was immediately confirmed as is the custom of\r\nthe Senate when one of its own members is nominated to office. Senator\r\nHill was thus left with the doubtful credit of having prevented the\r\nappointment of a New Yorker to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court.\r\nBut this incident did not seriously affect his control of the Democratic\r\nparty organization in New York. His adherents extolled him as a New York\r\ncandidate for the Presidency who would restore and maintain the regular\r\nparty system without which, it was contended, no administration could be\r\nsuccessful in framing and carrying out a definite policy. Hill's action,\r\nin again presenting himself as a candidate for Governor in the fall of\r\n1894, is intelligible only in the light of this ambition. He had already\r\nserved two terms as Governor and was now only midway in his senatorial\r\nterm; but if he again showed that he could carry New York he would\r\nhave demonstrated, so it was thought, that he was the most eligible\r\nDemocratic candidate for the Presidency. But he was defeated by a\r\nplurality of about 156,000.\r\n\r\nThe fall elections of 1894, indeed, made havoc in the Democratic party.\r\nIn twenty-four States, the Democrats failed to return a single member,\r\nand in each of six others, only a single district failed to elect\r\na Republican. The Republican majority in the House was 140, and the\r\nRepublican party also gained control of the Senate. The Democrats who\r\nhad swept the country two years before were now completely routed.\r\n\r\nUnder the peculiar American system which allows a defeated party to\r\ncarry on its work for another session of Congress as if nothing had\r\nhappened, the Democratic party remained in actual possession of Congress\r\nfor some months but could do nothing to better its record. The leading\r\noccupation of its members now seemed to be the advocacy of free silver\r\nand the denunciation of President Cleveland. William J. Bryan of\r\nNebraska was then displaying in the House the oratorical accomplishments\r\nand dauntless energy of character which soon thereafter gained him the\r\nparty leadership. With prolific rhetoric, he likened President Cleveland\r\nto a guardian who had squandered the estate of a confiding ward and to\r\na trainman who opened a switch and caused a wreck, and he declared\r\nthat the President in trying to inoculate the Democratic party with\r\nRepublican virus had poisoned its blood.\r\n\r\nShortly after the last Democratic Congress--the last for many years--the\r\nSupreme Court undid one of the few successful achievements of this party\r\nwhen it was in power. The Tariff Bill contained a section imposing a\r\ntax of two per cent on incomes in excess of $4000. A case was framed\r\nattacking the constitutionality of the tax,* the parties on both sides\r\naiming to defeat the law and framing the issues with that purpose in\r\nview. On April 8, 1895, the Supreme Court rendered a judgment which\r\nshowed that the Court was evenly divided on some points. A rehearing was\r\nordered and a final decision was rendered on the 20th of May. By a vote\r\nof five to four it was held that the income tax was a direct tax, that\r\nas such it could be imposed only by apportionment among the States\r\naccording to population, and that as the law made no such provision the\r\ntax was therefore invalid. This reversed the previous position of the\r\nCourt** that an income tax was not a direct tax within the meaning\r\nof the Constitution, but that it was an excise. This decision was the\r\nsubject of much bitter comment which, however, scarcely exceeded in\r\nseverity the expressions used by members of the Supreme Court who filed\r\ndissenting opinions. Justice White was of the opinion that the effect of\r\nthis judgment was \"to overthrow a long and consistent line of decisions\r\nand to deny to the legislative department of the Government the\r\npossession of a power conceded to it by universal consensus for one\r\nhundred years.\" Justice Harlan declared that it struck \"at the very\r\nfoundation of national authority\" and that it gave \"to certain kinds of\r\nproperty a position of favoritism and advantage inconsistent with the\r\nfundamental principles of our social organization.\" Justice Brown hoped\r\nthat \"it may not prove the first step towards the submergence of the\r\nliberties of the people in a sordid despotism of wealth.\" Justice\r\nJackson said it was \"such as no free and enlightened people can ever\r\npossibly sanction or approve.\" The comments of law journals were also\r\nsevere, and on the whole, the criticism of legal experts was more\r\noutspoken than that of the politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  Pollock vs. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, 157 U.S. 429.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * * Springer vs. United States, 102 U.S. 586.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic distrust of legislative procedure in the United States is so\r\ngreat that powers of judicial interference are valued to a degree not\r\nusual in any other country. The Democratic platform of 1896 did not\r\nventure to go farther in the way of censure than to declare that \"it is\r\nthe duty of Congress to use all the constitutional power which remains\r\nafter that decision, or which may come from its reversal by the court as\r\nit may hereafter be constituted, so that the burdens of taxation may be\r\nequally and impartially laid, to the end that wealth may bear its due\r\nproportion of the expenses of the government.\" Even this suggestion of\r\npossible future interference with the court turned out to be a heavy\r\nparty load in the campaign.\r\n\r\nWith the elimination of the income tax, the revenues of the country\r\nbecame insufficient to meet the demands upon the Treasury, and Carlisle\r\nwas obliged to report a deficit of $42,805,223 for 1895. The change of\r\nparty control in Congress brought no relief. The House, under the able\r\ndirection of Speaker Reed, passed a bill to augment the revenue by\r\nincreasing customs duties and also a bill authorizing the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to sell bonds or issue certificates of indebtedness bearing\r\ninterest at three per cent. Both measures, however, were held up in\r\nthe Senate, in which the silver faction held the balance of power.*\r\nOn February 1, 1896, a free silver substitute for the House bond\r\nbill passed the Senate by a vote of forty-two to thirty-five, but the\r\nminority represented over eight million more people than the majority.\r\nThe House refused, by 215 to 90, to concur in the Senate's amendment,\r\nand the whole subject was then dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *  The distribution of party strength in the Senate was:\r\nRepublicans, 43; Democrats, 39; Populists, 6. Republicans made\r\nconcessions to the Populists which caused them to refrain from voting\r\nwhen the question of organisation was pending, and the Republicans were\r\nthus able to elect the officers and rearrange the committees, which\r\nthey did in such a way as to put the free silver men in control of the\r\ncommittee on finance. The bills passed by the house were referred to\r\nthis committee, which thereupon substituted bills providing for free\r\ncoinage of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland had to carry on the battle to maintain the gold\r\nstandard and to sustain the public credit without any aid from Congress.\r\nThe one thing he did accomplish by his efforts, and it was at that\r\nmoment the thing of chief importance, was to put an end to party\r\nduplicity on the silver question. On that point, at least, national\r\nparty platforms abandoned their customary practice of trickery and\r\ndeceit. Compelled to choose between the support of the commercial\r\ncenters and that of the mining camps, the Republican convention came\r\nout squarely for the gold standard and nominated William McKinley for\r\nPresident. Thirty-four members of the convention, including four United\r\nStates Senators and two Representatives, bolted. It was a year of bolts,\r\nthe only party convention that escaped being that of the Socialist Labor\r\nparty, which ignored the monetary issue save for a vague declaration\r\nthat \"the United States have the exclusive right to issue money.\" The\r\nsilver men swept the Democratic convention, which then nominated William\r\nJennings Bryan for President. Later on, the Gold Democrats held a\r\nconvention and nominated John M. Palmer of Illinois. The Populists and\r\nthe National Silver party also nominated Bryan for President, but\r\neach made its own separate nomination for Vice-President. Even the\r\nProhibitionists split on the issue, and a seceding faction organized the\r\nNational party and inserted a free silver plank in their platform.\r\n\r\nIn the canvass which followed, calumny and misrepresentation were for\r\nonce discarded in favor of genuine discussion. This new attitude was\r\nlargely due to organizations for spreading information quite apart from\r\nregular party management. In this way, many able pamphlets were issued\r\nand widely circulated. The Republicans had ample campaign funds; but\r\nthough the Democrats were poorly supplied, this deficiency did not\r\nabate the energy of Bryan's campaign. He traveled over eighteen thousand\r\nmiles, speaking at nearly every stopping place to great assemblages.\r\nMcKinley, on the contrary, stayed at home, although he delivered an\r\neffective series of speeches to visiting delegations. The outcome seemed\r\ndoubtful, but the intense anxiety which was prevalent was promptly\r\ndispelled when the election returns began to arrive. By going over to\r\nfree silver, the Democrats wrested from the Republicans all the mining\r\nStates, except California, together with Kansas and Nebraska, but the\r\nelectoral votes which they thus secured were a poor compensation for\r\nlosses elsewhere. Such old Democratic strongholds as Delaware, Maryland,\r\nand West Virginia gave McKinley substantial majorities, and Kentucky\r\ngave him twelve of her thirteen electoral votes. McKinley's popular\r\nplurality was over six hundred thousand, and he had a majority of\r\nninety-five in the electoral college.\r\n\r\nThe nation approved the position which Cleveland had maintained, but the\r\nRepublican party reaped the benefit by going over to that position while\r\nthe Democratic party was ruined by forsaking it. Party experience during\r\nthe Cleveland era contained many lessons, but none clearer than that\r\npresidential leadership is essential both to legislative achievement and\r\nto party success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nAmong general histories dealing with this period, the leading authority\r\nis D.
