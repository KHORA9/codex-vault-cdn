He\r\ndied at Rydal Mount, in the neighbouring county of Westmoreland, on\r\nApril 23, 1850. In this long span of mortal years, events of vast and\r\nenduring moment shook the world. A handful of scattered and dependent\r\ncolonies in the northern continent of America made themselves into one\r\nof the most powerful and beneficent of states. The ancient monarchy of\r\nFrance, and all the old ordering of which the monarchy had been the\r\nkeystone, was overthrown, and it was not until after many a violent\r\nshock of arms, after terrible slaughter of men, after strange\r\ndiplomatic combinations, after many social convulsions, after many\r\nportentous mutations of empire, that Europe once more settled down for\r\na season into established order and system. In England almost alone,\r\nafter the loss of her great possessions across the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nthe fabric of the State stood fast and firm. Yet here, too, in these\r\neighty years, an old order slowly gave place to new. The restoration\r\nof peace, after a war conducted with extraordinary tenacity and\r\nfortitude, led to a still more wonderful display of ingenuity,\r\nindustry, and enterprise, in the more fruitful field of commerce\r\nand of manufactures. Wealth, in spite of occasional vicissitudes,\r\nincreased with amazing rapidity. The population of England and Wales\r\ngrew from being seven and a half millions in 1770, to nearly eighteen\r\nmillions in 1850. Political power was partially transferred from a\r\nterritorial aristocracy to the middle and trading classes. Laws were\r\nmade at once more equal and more humane. During all the tumult of the\r\ngreat war which for so many years bathed Europe in fire, through all\r\nthe throes and agitations in which peace brought forth the new time,\r\nWordsworth for half a century (1799-1850) dwelt sequestered in\r\nunbroken composure and steadfastness in his chosen home amid the\r\nmountains and lakes of his native region, working out his own ideal of\r\nthe high office of the Poet.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of life in books and the development of imagination\r\nunderwent changes of its own. Most of the great lights of the\r\neighteenth century were still burning, though burning low, when\r\nWordsworth came into the world. Pope, indeed, had been dead for six\r\nand twenty years, and all the rest of the Queen Anne men had gone.\r\nBut Gray only died in 1771, and Goldsmith in 1774. Ten years later\r\nJohnson's pious and manly heart ceased to beat. Voltaire and Rousseau,\r\nthose two diverse oracles of their age, both died in 1778. Hume had\r\npassed away two years before. Cowper was forty years older than\r\nWordsworth, but Cowper's most delightful work was not produced until\r\n1783. Crabbe, who anticipated Wordsworth's choice of themes from rural\r\nlife, while treating them with a sterner realism, was virtually his\r\ncontemporary, having been born in 1754, and dying in 1832. The two\r\ngreat names of his own date were Scott and Coleridge, the first born\r\nin 1771, and the second a year afterwards. Then a generation later\r\ncame another new and illustrious group. Byron was born in 1788,\r\nShelley in 1792, and Keats in 1795. Wordsworth was destined to see one\r\nmore orb of the first purity and brilliance rise to its place in the\r\npoetic firmament. Tennyson's earliest volume of poems was published in\r\n1830, and _In Memoriam_, one of his two masterpieces, in 1830. Any one\r\nwho realises for how much these famous names will always stand in\r\nthe history of human genius, may measure the great transition that\r\nWordsworth's eighty years witnessed in some of men's deepest feelings\r\nabout art and life and \"the speaking face of earth and heaven.\"\r\n\r\nHere, too, Wordsworth stood isolated and apart. Scott and Southey were\r\nvalued friends, but, as has been truly said, he thought little of\r\nScott's poetry, and less of Southey's. Of Blake's _Songs of Innocence\r\nand Experience_ he said, \"There is something in the madness of this\r\nman which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter\r\nScott.\" Coleridge was the only member of the shining company with whom\r\nhe ever had any real intimacy of mind, for whom he ever nourished real\r\ndeference and admiration as one \"unrelentingly possessed by thirst of\r\ngreatness, love, and beauty,\" and in whose intellectual power, as the\r\nnoble lines in the Sixth Book of the _Prelude_ so gorgeously attest,\r\nhe took the passionate interest of a man at once master, disciple, and\r\nfriend. It is true to say, as Emerson says, that Wordsworth's genius\r\nwas the great exceptional fact of the literature of his period. But he\r\nhad no teachers nor inspirers save nature and solitude.\r\n\r\nWordsworth was the son of a solicitor, and all his early circumstances\r\nwere homely, unpretentious, and rather straitened. His mother died\r\nwhen he was eight years old, and when his father followed her five\r\nyears later, two of his uncles provided means for continuing\r\nat Cambridge the education which had been begun in the rural\r\ngrammar-school of Hawkshead. It was in 1787 that he went up to St.\r\nJohn's College. He took his Bachelor's degree at the beginning of\r\n1791, and there his connection with the university ended.\r\n\r\nFor some years after leaving Cambridge, Wordsworth let himself drift.\r\nHe did not feel good enough for the Church; he shrank from the law;\r\nfancying that he had talents for command, he thought of being a\r\nsoldier. Meanwhile, he passed a short time desultorily in London.\r\nTowards the end of 1791, through Paris, he passed on to Orleans\r\nand Blois, where he made some friends and spent most of a year. He\r\nreturned to Paris in October 1792. France was no longer standing on\r\nthe top of golden hours. The September massacres filled the sky with\r\na lurid flame. Wordsworth still retained his ardent faith in the\r\nRevolution, and was even ready, though no better than \"a landsman on\r\nthe deck of a ship struggling with a hideous storm,\" to make common\r\ncause with the Girondists. But the prudence of friends at home forced\r\nhim back to England before the beginning of the terrible year of '93.\r\nWith his return closed that first survey of its inheritance, which\r\nmost serious souls are wont to make in the fervid prime of early\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to attempt any commentary on the bare facts that we\r\nhave just recapitulated; for Wordsworth himself has clothed them with\r\ntheir full force and meaning in the _Prelude_. This record of the\r\ngrowth of a poet's mind, told by the poet himself with all the\r\nsincerity of which he was capable, is never likely to be popular. Of\r\nthat, as of so much more of his poetry, we must say that, as a whole,\r\nit has not the musical, harmonious, sympathetic quality which seizes\r\nus in even the prose of such a book as Rousseau's _Confessions_.\r\nMacaulay thought the _Prelude_ a poorer and more tiresome _Excursion_,\r\nwith the old flimsy philosophy about the effect of scenery on the\r\nmind, the old crazy mystical metaphysics, and the endless wilderness\r\nof twaddle; still he admits that there are some fine descriptions and\r\nenergetic declamations. All Macaulay's tastes and habits of mind made\r\nhim a poor judge of such a poet as Wordsworth. He valued spirit,\r\nenergy, pomp, stateliness of form and diction, and actually thought\r\nDryden's fine lines about to-morrow being falser than the former clay\r\nequal to any eight lines in Lucretius. But his words truly express\r\nthe effect of the _Prelude_ on more vulgar minds than his own. George\r\nEliot, on the other hand, who had the inward eye that was not among\r\nMacaulay's gifts, found the _Prelude_ full of material for a daily\r\nliturgy, and it is easy to imagine how she fondly lingered, as she\r\ndid, over such a thought as this--\r\n\r\n                      \"There is\r\n  One great society alone on earth:\r\n  The noble Living and the noble Dead.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, too, as may be found imbedded even in Wordsworth's dullest\r\nwork, many a line of the truest poetical quality, such as that on\r\nNewton's statue in the silent Chapel of Trinity College--\r\n\r\n  \"The marble index of a mind for ever\r\n  Voyaging through strange seas of Thought alone.\"\r\n\r\nApart, however, from beautiful lines like this, and from many noble\r\npassages of high reflection set to sonorous verse, this remarkable\r\npoem is in its whole effect unique in impressive power, as a picture\r\nof the advance of an elect and serious spirit from childhood and\r\nschool-time, through the ordeal of adolescence, through close contact\r\nwith stirring and enormous events, to that decisive stage when it has\r\nfound the sources of its strength, and is fully and finally prepared\r\nto put its temper to the proof.\r\n\r\nThe three Books that describe the poet's residence in France have a\r\nspecial and a striking value of their own. Their presentation of the\r\nphases of good men's minds as the successive scenes of the Revolution\r\nunfolded themselves has real historic interest. More than this, it\r\nis an abiding lesson to brave men how to bear themselves in hours of\r\npublic stress. It portrays exactly that mixture of persevering faith\r\nand hope with firm and reasoned judgment, with which I like to think\r\nthat Turgot, if he had lived, would have confronted the workings\r\nof the Revolutionary power. Great masters in many kinds have been\r\ninspired by the French Revolution. Human genius might seem to have\r\nexhausted itself in the burning political passion of Burke, in the\r\nglowing melodrama of fire and tears of Carlyle, Michelet, Hugo; but\r\nthe ninth, tenth, and eleventh Books of the _Prelude_, by their\r\nstrenuous simplicity, their deep truthfulness, their slowfooted and\r\ninexorable transition from ardent hope to dark imaginations, sense of\r\nwoes to come, sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart, breathe the\r\nvery spirit of the great catastrophe. There is none of the ephemeral\r\nglow of the political exhortation, none of the tiresome falsity of the\r\ndithyramb in history. Wordsworth might well wish that some dramatic\r\ntale, endued with livelier shapes and flinging out less guarded words,\r\nmight set forth the lessons of his experience. The material was\r\nfitting. The story of these three Books has something of the severity,\r\nthe self-control, the inexorable necessity of classic tragedy, and\r\nlike classic tragedy it has a noble end. The dregs and sour sediment\r\nthat reaction from exaggerated hope is so apt to stir in poor natures\r\nhad no place here. The French Revolution made the one crisis in\r\nWordsworth's mental history, the one heavy assault on his continence\r\nof soul, and when he emerged from it all his greatness remained to\r\nhim. After a long spell of depression, bewilderment, mortification,\r\nand sore disappointment, the old faith in new shapes was given back.\r\n\r\n                  \"Nature's self,\r\n  By all varieties of human love\r\n  Assisted, led me back through opening day\r\n  To those sweet counsels between head and heart\r\n  Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,\r\n  Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,\r\n  Hath still upheld me and upholds me now.\"\r\n\r\nIt was six years after his return from France before Wordsworth\r\nfinally settled down in the scenes with which his name and the power\r\nof his genius were to be for ever associated. During this interval it\r\nwas that two great sources of personal influence were opened to him.\r\nHe entered upon that close and beloved companionship with his sister,\r\nwhich remained unbroken to the end of their days; and he first made\r\nthe acquaintance of Coleridge. The character of Dorothy Wordsworth has\r\nlong taken its place in the gallery of admirable and devoted women who\r\nhave inspired the work and the thoughts of great men. \"She is a woman,\r\nindeed,\" said Coleridge, \"in mind I mean, and heart; for her person is\r\nsuch that if you expected to see a pretty woman, you would think her\r\nrather ordinary; if you expected to see an ordinary woman, you would\r\nthink her pretty.\" To the solidity, sense, and strong intelligence\r\nof the Wordsworth stock she added a grace, a warmth, a liveliness\r\npeculiarly her own. Her nature shines transparent in her letters, in\r\nher truly admirable journal, and in every report that we have of her.\r\nWordsworth's own feelings for her, and his sense of the debt that\r\nhe owed to her faithful affection and eager mind, he has placed on\r\nlasting record.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy with Coleridge was, as has been said, Wordsworth's one\r\nstrong friendship, and must be counted among the highest examples of\r\nthat generous relation between great writers. Unlike in the quality\r\nof their genius, and unlike in force of character and the fortunes of\r\nlife, they remained bound to one another by sympathies that neither\r\ntime nor harsh trial ever extinguished. Coleridge had left Cambridge\r\nin 1794, had married, had started various unsuccessful projects for\r\ncombining the improvement of mankind with the earning of an income,\r\nand was now settled in a small cottage at Nether Stowey, in\r\nSomersetshire, with an acre and a half of land, from which he hoped to\r\nraise corn and vegetables enough to support himself and his wife, as\r\nwell as to feed a couple of pigs on the refuse. Wordsworth and his\r\nsister were settled at Racedown, near Crewkerne, in Dorsetshire.\r\nIn 1797 they moved to Alfoxden, in Somersetshire, their principal\r\ninducement to the change being Coleridge's society. The friendship\r\nbore fruit in the production of _Lyrical Ballads_ in 1798, mainly the\r\nwork of Wordsworth, but containing no less notable a contribution from\r\nColeridge than the _Ancient Mariner_. The two poets only received\r\nthirty guineas for their work, and the publisher lost his money.\r\nThe taste of the country was not yet ripe for Wordsworth's poetic\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the publication of the _Lyrical Ballads_, the\r\ntwo Wordsworths and Coleridge started from Yarmouth for Hamburg.\r\nColeridge's account in Satyrane's Letters, published In the\r\n_Biographia Literaria_, of the voyage and of the conversation between\r\nthe two English poets and Klopstock, is worth turning to. The pastor\r\ntold them that Klopstock was the German Milton. \"A very German Milton\r\nindeed,\" they thought. The Wordsworths remained for four wintry months\r\nat Goslar, in Saxony, while Coleridge went on to Ratzeburg, Göttingen,\r\nand other places, mastering German, and \"delving in the unwholesome\r\nquicksilver mines of metaphysic depths.\" Wordsworth made little way\r\nwith the language, but worked diligently at his own verse.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back to England, Wordsworth and his sister found their\r\nhearts turning with irresistible attraction to their own familiar\r\ncountryside. They at last made their way to Grasmere. The opening book\r\nof the _Recluse_, which is published for the first time in the present\r\nvolume, describes in fine verse the emotions and the scene. The face\r\nof this delicious vale is not quite what it was when\r\n\r\n                  \"Cottages of mountain stone\r\n  Clustered like stars some few, but single most,\r\n  And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,\r\n  Or glancing at each other cheerful looks\r\n  Like separated stars with clouds between.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is foolish to let ourselves be fretted by the villa, the hotel,\r\nand the tourist. We may well be above all this in a scene that is\r\nhaunted by a great poetic shade. The substantial features and elements\r\nof beauty still remain, the crags and woody steeps, the lake, \"its one\r\ngreen island and its winding shores; the multitude of little rocky\r\nhills.\" Wordsworth was not the first poet to feel its fascination.\r\nGray visited the Lakes in the autumn of 1769, and coming into the vale\r\nof Grasmere from the north-west, declared it to be one of the sweetest\r\nlandscapes that art ever attempted to imitate, an unsuspected paradise\r\nof peace and rusticity. We cannot indeed compare the little crystal\r\nmere, set like a gem in the verdant circle of the hills, with the\r\ngrandeur and glory of Lucerne, or the radiant gladness and expanse of\r\nComo: yet it has an inspiration of its own, to delight, to soothe, to\r\nfortify, and to refresh.\r\n\r\n  \"What want we? have we not perpetual streams,\r\n  Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,\r\n  And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,\r\n  And thickets full of songsters, and the voice\r\n  Of lordly birds, an unexpected sound\r\n  Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,\r\n  Admonishing the man who walks below\r\n  Of solitude and silence in the sky.\r\n  These have we, and a thousand nooks of earth\r\n  Have also these, but nowhere else is found,\r\n  Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be found\r\n  The one sensation that is here;...'tis the sense\r\n  Of majesty, and beauty, and repose,\r\n  A blended holiness of earth and sky,\r\n  Something that makes this individual spot,\r\n  This small abiding-place of many men,\r\n  A termination, and a last retreat,\r\n  A centre, come from wheresoe'er you will,\r\n  A whole without dependence or defect,\r\n  Made for itself, and happy in itself,\r\n  Perfect contentment, Unity entire.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Grasmere vale Wordsworth lived for half a century, first in a\r\nlittle cottage at the northern corner of the lake, and then (1813) in\r\na more commodious house at Rydal Mount at the southern end, on the\r\nroad to Ambleside. In 1802 he married Mary Hutchinson, of Penrith, and\r\nthis completed the circle of his felicity. Mary, he once said, was to\r\nhis ear the most musical and most truly English in sound of all the\r\nnames we have. The name was of harmonious omen. The two beautiful\r\nsonnets that he wrote on his wife's portrait long years after, when\r\n\"morning into noon had passed, noon into eve,\" show how much her large\r\nheart and humble mind had done for the blessedness of his home.\r\n\r\nTheir life was almost more simple than that of the dalesmen their\r\nneighbours. \"It is my opinion,\" ran one of his oracular sayings to Sir\r\nGeorge Beaumont, \"that a man of letters, and indeed all public men\r\nof every pursuit, should be severely frugal.\" Means were found for\r\nsupporting the modest home out of two or three small windfalls\r\nbequeathed by friends or relatives, and by the time that children had\r\nbegun to come Wordsworth was raised to affluence by obtaining the post\r\nof distributor of stamps for Westmoreland and part of Cumberland. His\r\nlife was happily devoid of striking external incident. Its essential\r\npart lay in meditation and composition.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by friends. Southey had made a home for himself\r\nand his beloved library a few miles over the hills, at Keswick. De\r\nQuincey, with his clever brains and shallow character, took up his\r\nabode in the cottage which Wordsworth had first lived in at Grasmere.\r\nColeridge, born the most golden genius of them all, came to and fro\r\nin those fruitless unhappy wanderings which consumed a life that once\r\npromised to be so rich in blessing and in glory. In later years Dr.\r\nArnold built a house at Fox How, attracted by the Wordsworths and the\r\nscenery; and other lesser lights came into the neighbourhood. \"Our\r\nintercourse with the Wordsworths,\" Arnold wrote on the occasion of his\r\nfirst visit in 1832, \"was one of the brightest spots of all; nothing\r\ncould exceed their friendliness, and my almost daily walks with him\r\nwere things not to be forgotten. Once and once only we had a good\r\nfight about the Reform Bill during a walk up Greenhead Ghyll to see\r\nthe unfinished sheep-fold, recorded in _Michael_. But I am sure that\r\nour political disagreement did not at all interfere with our enjoyment\r\nof each other's society; for I think that in the great principles of\r\nthings we agreed very entirely.\" It ought to be possible, for that\r\nmatter, for magnanimous men, even if they do not agree in the great\r\nprinciples of things, to keep pleasant terms with one another for more\r\nthan one afternoon's walk. Many pilgrims came, and the poet seems to\r\nhave received them with cheerful equanimity. Emerson called upon him\r\nin 1833, and found him plain, elderly, whitehaired, not prepossessing.\r\n\"He led me out into his garden, and showed me the gravel walk in\r\nwhich thousands of his lines were composed. He had just returned from\r\nStaffa, and within three days had made three sonnets on Fingal's Cave,\r\nand was composing a fourth when he was called in to see me. He said,\r\n'If you are interested in my verses, perhaps you will like to hear\r\nthese lines.' I gladly assented, and he recollected himself for a few\r\nmoments, and then stood forth and repeated, one after the other, the\r\nthree entire sonnets with great animation. This recitation was so\r\nunlooked for and surprising--he, the old Wordsworth, standing apart,\r\nand reciting to me in a garden-walk, like a schoolboy declaiming--that\r\nI at first was near to laugh; but recollecting myself, that I had come\r\nthus far to see a poet, and he was chanting poems to me, I saw that he\r\nwas right and I was wrong, and gladly gave myself up to hear. He never\r\nwas in haste to publish; partly because he corrected a good deal....\r\nHe preferred such of his poems as touched the affections to any\r\nothers; for whatever is didactic--what theories of society, and so\r\non--might perish quickly, but whatever combined a truth with an\r\naffection was good to-day and good for ever\" (_English Traits_, ch.\r\ni.).\r\n\r\nWordsworth was far too wise to encourage the pilgrims to turn into\r\nabiding sojourners in his chosen land. Clough has described how, when\r\nhe was a lad of eighteen (1837), with a mild surprise he heard the\r\nvenerable poet correct the tendency to exaggerate the importance of\r\nflowers and fields, lakes, waterfalls, and scenery. \"People come to\r\nthe Lakes,\" said Wordsworth, \"and are charmed with a particular spot,\r\nand build a house, and find themselves discontented, forgetting that\r\nthese things are only the sauce and garnish of life.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of a certain hardness and stiffness, Wordsworth must have\r\nbeen an admirable companion for anybody capable of true elevation\r\nof mind. The unfortunate Haydon says, with his usual accent of\r\nenthusiasm, after a saunter at Hampstead, \"Never did any man so\r\nbeguile the time as Wordsworth. His purity of heart, his kindness,\r\nhis soundness of principle, his information, his knowledge, and the\r\nintense and eager feelings with which he pours forth all he knows,\r\naffect, interest, and enchant one\" (_Autobiog._ i. 298, 384). The\r\ndiary of Crabb Robinson, the correspondence of Charles Lamb, the\r\ndelightful autobiography of Mrs. Fletcher, and much less delightfully\r\nthe autobiography of Harriet Martineau, all help us to realise by many\r\na trait Wordsworth's daily walk and conversation. Of all the glimpses\r\nthat we get, from these and many other sources, none are more pleasing\r\nthan those of the intercourse between Wordsworth and Scott. They were\r\nthe two manliest and most wholesome men of genius of their time. They\r\nheld different theories of poetic art, but their affection and esteem\r\nfor one another never varied, from the early days when Scott and his\r\nyoung wife visited Wordsworth in his cottage at Grasmere, down to that\r\nsorrowful autumn evening (1831) when Wordsworth and his daughter went\r\nto Abbotsford to bid farewell to the wondrous potentate, then just\r\nabout to start on his vain search for new life, followed by \"the might\r\nof the whole earth's good wishes.\"\r\n\r\nOf Wordsworth's demeanour and physical presence, De Quincey's account,\r\nsilly, coxcombical, and vulgar, is the worst; Carlyle's, as might be\r\nexpected from his magical gift of portraiture, is the best. Carlyle\r\ncared little for Wordsworth's poetry, had a real respect for the\r\nantique greatness of his devotion to Poverty and Peasanthood,\r\nrecognised his strong intellectual powers and strong character, but\r\nthought him rather dull, bad-tempered, unproductive, and almost\r\nwearisome, and found his divine reflections and unfathomabilities\r\nstinted, scanty, uncertain, palish. From these and many other\r\ndisparagements, one gladly passes to the picture of the poet as he was\r\nin the flesh at a breakfast-party given by Henry Taylor, at a\r\ntavern in St. James's Street, in 1840. The subject of the talk was\r\nLiterature, its laws, practices, and observances:--\"He talked well in\r\nhis way; with veracity, easy brevity and force; as a wise tradesman\r\nwould of his tools and workshop, and as no unwise one could. His voice\r\nwas good, frank, and sonorous, though practically clear, distinct,\r\nand forcible, rather than melodious; the tone of him business-like,\r\nsedately confident; no discourtesy, yet no anxiety about being\r\ncourteous: a fine wholesome rusticity, fresh as his mountain breezes,\r\nsat well on the stalwart veteran, and on all he said and did. You\r\nwould have said he was a usually taciturn man, glad to unlock himself\r\nto audience sympathetic and intelligent, when such offered itself. His\r\nface bore marks of much, not always peaceful, meditation; the look of\r\nit not bland or benevolent, so much as close, impregnable, and hard;\r\na man _multa tacere loquive paratus_, in a world where he had\r\nexperienced no lack of contradictions as he strode along! The eyes\r\nwere not very brilliant, but they had a quiet clearness; there\r\nwas enough of brow, and well shaped; rather too much of cheek\r\n('horse-face,' I have heard satirists say), face of squarish shape and\r\ndecidedly longish, as I think the head itself was (its 'length' going\r\nhorizontal); he was large-boned, lean, but still firm-knit, tall, and\r\nstrong-looking when he stood; a right good old steel-gray figure, with\r\nrustic simplicity and dignity about him, and a vivacious _strength_\r\nlooking through him which might have suited one of those old\r\nsteel-gray _Markgrafs_ [Graf = _Grau_,'Steel-gray'] whom Henry the\r\nFowler set up to ward the 'marches,' and do battle with the intrusive\r\nheathen, in a stalwart and judicious manner.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever might be his friends within an easy walk, or dwelling afar,\r\nthe poet knew how to live his own life. The three fine sonnets headed\r\n_Personal Talk_, so well known, so warmly accepted in our better\r\nhours, so easily forgotten in hours not so good between pleasant\r\nlevities and grinding preoccupations, show us how little his\r\nneighbours had to do with the poet's genial seasons of \"smooth\r\npassions, smooth discourse, and joyous thought.\"\r\n\r\nFor those days Wordsworth was a considerable traveller. Between 1820\r\nand 1837 he made long tours abroad, to Switzerland, to Holland, to\r\nBelgium, to Italy. In other years he visited Wales, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland. He was no mechanical tourist, admiring to order and\r\nmarvelling by regulation; and he confessed to Mrs. Fletcher that he\r\nfell asleep before the Venus de Medici at Florence. But the product of\r\nthese wanderings is to be seen in some of his best sonnets, such as\r\nthe first on Calais Beach, the famous one on Westminster Bridge, the\r\nsecond of the two on Bruges, where \"the Spirit of Antiquity mounts to\r\nthe seat of grace within the mind--a deeper peace than that in deserts\r\nfound\"--and in some other fine pieces.\r\n\r\nIn weightier matters than mere travel, Wordsworth showed himself no\r\nmere recluse. He watched the great affairs then being transacted in\r\nEurope with the ardent interest of his youth, and his sonnets to\r\nLiberty, commemorating the attack by France upon the Swiss, the fate\r\nof Venice, the struggle of Hofer, the resistance of Spain, give no\r\nunworthy expression to some of the best of the many and varied motives\r\nthat animated England in her long struggle with Bonaparte. The sonnet\r\nto Toussaint l'Ouverture concludes with some of the noblest lines in\r\nthe English language. The strong verses on the expected death of Mr.\r\nFox are alive with a magnanimous public spirit that goes deeper than\r\nthe accidents of political opinion. In his young days he had sent Fox\r\na copy of the _Lyrical Ballads_, with a long letter indicating his\r\nsense of Fox's great and generous qualities. Pitt he admits that he\r\ncould never regard with complacency. \"I believe him, however,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to have been as disinterested a man, and as true a lover of his\r\ncountry, as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be. His first\r\nwish (though probably unknown to himself) was that his country should\r\nprosper under his administration; his next that it should prosper.\r\nCould the order of these wishes have been reversed, Mr. Pitt would\r\nhave avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which, I think, he\r\nfell.\" \"You always went away from Burke,\" he once told Haydon, \"with\r\nyour mind filled; from Fox with your feelings excited; and from Pitt\r\nwith wonder at his having had the power to make the worse appear the\r\nbetter reason.\"\r\n\r\nOf the poems composed under the influence of that best kind of\r\npatriotism which ennobles local attachments by associating them with\r\nthe lasting elements of moral grandeur and heroism it is needless to\r\nspeak. They have long taken their place as something higher even than\r\nliterary classics. As years began to dull the old penetration of a\r\nmind which had once approached, like other youths, the shield of human\r\nnature from the golden side, and had been eager to \"clear a passage\r\nfor just government,\" Wordsworth lost his interest in progress.\r\nWaterloo may be taken for the date at which his social grasp began to\r\nfail, and with it his poetic glow. He opposed Catholic emancipation as\r\nstubbornly as Eldon, and the Reform Bill as bitterly as Croker. For\r\nthe practical reforms of his day, even in education, for which he\r\nhad always spoken up, Wordsworth was not a force. His heart clung to\r\nEngland as he found it. \"This concrete attachment to the scenes about\r\nhim,\" says Mr. Myers, \"had always formed an important element In his\r\ncharacter. Ideal politics, whether in Church or State, had never\r\noccupied his mind, which sought rather to find its informing\r\nprinciples embodied in the England of his own day.\" This flowed, we\r\nmay suppose, from Burke. In a passage in the seventh Book of the\r\n_Prelude_, he describes, in lines a little prosaic but quite true,\r\nhow he sat, saw, and heard, not unthankful nor uninspired, the great\r\norator\r\n\r\n  \"While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth\r\n  Against all systems built on abstract rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe Church, as conceived by the spirit of Laud, and described by\r\nHooker's voice, was the great symbol of the union of high and stable\r\ninstitution with thought, faith, right living, and \"sacred religion,\r\nmother of form and fear.\" As might be expected from such a point of\r\nview, the church pieces, to which Wordsworth gave so much thought,\r\nare, with few exceptions, such as the sonnet on _Seathwaite Chapel_,\r\nformal, hard, and very thinly enriched with spiritual graces or\r\nunction. They are ecclesiastical, not religious. In religious\r\npoetry, the Church of England finds her most affecting voice, not in\r\nWordsworth, but in the _Lyra Innocentium_ and the _Christian Year_.\r\nWordsworth abounds in the true devotional cast of mind, but less than\r\nanywhere else does it show in his properly ecclesiastical verse.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps natural that when events no longer inspired him,\r\nWordsworth should have turned with new feelings towards the classic,\r\nand discovered a virtue in classic form to which his own method had\r\nhitherto made him a little blind. Towards the date of Waterloo, he\r\nread over again some of the Latin writers, in attempting to prepare\r\nhis son for college. He even at a later date set about a translation\r\nof the _Aeneid_ of Virgil, but the one permanent result of the classic\r\nmovement in his mind is _Laodamia_. Earlier in life he had translated\r\nsome books of Ariosto at the rate of a hundred lines a day, and he\r\neven attempted fifteen of the sonnets of Michael Angelo, but so much\r\nmeaning is compressed into so little room in those pieces that he\r\nfound the difficulty insurmountable. He had a high opinion of the\r\nresources of the Italian language. The poetry of Dante and of Michael\r\nAngelo, he said, proves that if there be little majesty and strength\r\nin Italian verse, the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue.\r\n\r\nOur last glimpse of Wordsworth in the full and peculiar power of his\r\ngenius is the Ode _Composed on an evening of extraordinary splendour\r\nand beauty_. It is the one exception to the critical dictum that all\r\nhis good work was done in the decade between 1798 and 1808. He lived\r\nfor more than thirty years after this fine composition. But he added\r\nnothing more of value to the work that he had already done. The public\r\nappreciation of it was very slow. The most influential among the\r\ncritics were for long hostile and contemptuous. Never at any time did\r\nWordsworth come near to such popularity as that of Scott or of Byron.\r\nNor was this all. For many years most readers of poetry thought more\r\neven of _Lalla Rookh_ than of the _Excursion_. While Scott, Byron, and\r\nMoore were receiving thousands of pounds, Wordsworth received nothing.\r\nBetween 1830 and 1840 the current turned in Wordsworth's direction,\r\nand when he received the honour of a doctor's degree at the Oxford\r\nCommemoration in 1839, the Sheldonian theatre made him the hero of the\r\nday. In the spring of 1843 Southey died, and Sir Robert Peel pressed\r\nWordsworth to succeed him in the office of Poet-Laureate. \"It is a\r\ntribute of respect,\" said the Minister, \"justly due to the first\r\nof living poets.\" But almost immediately the light of his common\r\npopularity was eclipsed by Tennyson, as it had earlier been eclipsed\r\nby Scott, by Byron, and in some degree by Shelley. Yet his fame among\r\nthose who know, among competent critics with a right to judge, to-day\r\nstands higher than it ever stood. Only two writers have contributed so\r\nmany lines of daily popularity and application. In the handbooks of\r\nfamiliar quotations Wordsworth fills more space than anybody save\r\nShakespeare and Pope. He exerted commanding influence over great minds\r\nthat have powerfully affected our generation. \"I never before,\" said\r\nGeorge Eliot in the days when her character was forming itself (1839),\r\n\"met with so many of my own feelings expressed just as I should like\r\nthem,\" and her reverence for Wordsworth remained to the end. J.S. Mill\r\nhas described how important an event in his life was his first reading\r\nof Wordsworth. \"What made his poems a medicine for my state of mind\r\nwas that they expressed not mere outward beauty, but states of feeling\r\nand of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of beauty. I\r\nneeded to be made to feel that there was real permanent happiness in\r\ntranquil contemplation. Wordsworth taught me this, not only without\r\nturning away from, but with greatly increased interest in the common\r\nfeelings and common destiny of human beings\" _(Autobiog_., 148). This\r\neffect of Wordsworth on Mill is the very illustration of the phrase\r\nof a later poet of our own day, one of the most eminent and by his\r\nfriends best beloved of all those whom Wordsworth had known, and on\r\nwhom he poured out a generous portion of his own best spirit:--\r\n\r\n  Time may restore us in his course\r\n  Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force.\r\n  But where will Europe's latter hour\r\n  Again find Wordsworth's healing power?\r\n\r\nIt is the power for which Matthew Arnold found this happy designation\r\nthat compensates us for that absence of excitement of which the\r\nheedless complain in Wordsworth's verse--excitement so often meaning\r\nmental fever, hysterics, distorted passion, or other fitful agitation\r\nof the soul.\r\n\r\nPretensions are sometimes advanced as to Wordsworth's historic\r\nposition, which involve a mistaken view of literary history. Thus, we\r\nare gravely told by the too zealous Wordsworthian that the so-called\r\npoets of the eighteenth century were simply men of letters; they had\r\nvarious accomplishments and great general ability, but their thoughts\r\nwere expressed in prose, or in mere metrical diction, which passed\r\ncurrent as poetry without being so. Yet Burns belonged wholly to\r\nthe eighteenth century (1759-96), and no verse-writer is so little\r\nliterary as Burns, so little prosaic; no writer more truly poetic in\r\nmelody, diction, thought, feeling, and spontaneous song. It was Burns\r\nwho showed Wordsworth's own youth \"How verse may build a princely\r\nthrone on humble truth.\" Nor can we understand how Cowper is to be set\r\ndown as simply a man of letters. We may, too, if we please, deny the\r\nname of poetry to Collins's tender and pensive _Ode to Evening_;\r\nbut we can only do this on critical principles, which would end in\r\nclassing the author of _Lycidas_ and _Comus_, of the _Allegro_ and\r\n_Penseroso_, as a writer of various accomplishments and great general\r\nability, but at bottom simply a man of letters and by no means a\r\npoet. It is to Gray, however, that we must turn for the distinctive\r\ncharacter of the best poetry of the eighteenth century. With\r\nreluctance we will surrender the Pindaric Odes, though not without\r\nrisking the observation that some of Wordsworth's own criticism on\r\nGray is as narrow and as much beside the mark as Jeffrey's on the\r\n_Excursion_. But the _Ode on Eton College_ is not to have grudged to\r\nit the noble name and true quality of poetry, merely because, as\r\none of Johnson's most unfortunate criticisms expresses it, the ode\r\nsuggests nothing to Gray which every beholder does not equally think\r\nand feel. To find beautiful and pathetic language, set to harmonious\r\nnumbers, for the common impressions of meditative minds, is no small\r\npart of the poet's task. That part has never been achieved by any poet\r\nin any tongue with more complete perfection and success than in the\r\nimmortal _Elegy_, of which we may truly say that it has for nearly\r\na century and a half given to greater multitudes of men more of the\r\nexquisite pleasure of poetry than any other single piece in all the\r\nglorious treasury of English verse. It abounds, as Johnson says, \"with\r\nimages which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to which\r\nevery bosom returns an echo.\" These moving commonplaces of the human\r\nlot Gray approached through books and studious contemplation; not, as\r\nWordsworth approached them, by daily contact with the lives and habit\r\nof men and the forces and magical apparitions of external nature. But\r\nit is a narrow view to suppose that the men of the eighteenth century\r\ndid not look through the literary conventions of the day to the truths\r\nof life and nature behind them. The conventions have gone, or are\r\nchanged, and we are all glad of it. Wordsworth effected a\r\nwholesome deliverance when he attacked the artificial diction, the\r\npersonifications, the allegories, the antitheses, the barren rhymes\r\nand monotonous metres, which the reigning taste had approved. But\r\nwhile welcoming the new freshness, sincerity, and direct and fertile\r\nreturn on nature, that is a very bad reason why we should disparage\r\npoetry so genial, so simple, so humane, and so perpetually pleasing,\r\nas the best verse of the rationalistic century.\r\n\r\nWhat Wordsworth did was to deal with themes that had been partially\r\nhandled by precursors and contemporaries, in a larger and more\r\ndevoted spirit, with wider amplitude of illustration, and with the\r\nsteadfastness and persistency of a religious teacher. \"Every great\r\npoet is a teacher,\" he said; \"I wish to be considered as a teacher or\r\nas nothing.\" It may be doubted whether his general proposition is at\r\nall true, and whether it is any more the essential business of a poet\r\nto be a teacher than it was the business of Handel, Beethoven, or\r\nMozart. They attune the soul to high states of feeling; the direct\r\nlesson is often as nought. But of himself no view could be more sound.\r\nHe is a teacher, or he is nothing. \"To console the afflicted; to add\r\nsunshine to daylight by making the happy happier; to teach the\r\nyoung and the gracious of every age to see, to think, and feel, and\r\ntherefore to become more actively and sincerely virtuous\"--that was\r\nhis vocation; to show that the mutual adaptation of the external\r\nworld and the inner mind is able to shape a paradise from the \"simple\r\nproduce of the common day\"--that was his high argument.\r\n\r\nSimplification was, as I have said elsewhere, the keynote of the\r\nrevolutionary time. Wordsworth was its purest exponent, but he had one\r\nremarkable peculiarity, which made him, in England at least, not only\r\nits purest but its greatest. While leading men to pierce below the\r\nartificial and conventional to the natural man and natural life, as\r\nRousseau did, Wordsworth still cherished the symbols, the traditions,\r\nand the great institutes of social order. Simplification of life and\r\nthought and feeling was to be accomplished without summoning up the\r\ndangerous spirit of destruction and revolt. Wordsworth lived with\r\nnature, yet waged no angry railing war against society. The chief\r\nopposing force to Wordsworth in literature was Byron. Whatever he was\r\nin his heart, Byron in his work was drawn by all the forces of his\r\ncharacter, genius, and circumstances to the side of violent social\r\nchange, and hence the extraordinary popularity of Byron in the\r\ncontinental camp of emancipation. Communion with nature is in\r\nWordsworth's doctrine the school of duty. With Byron nature is the\r\nmighty consoler and the vindicator of the rebel.\r\n\r\nA curious thing, which we may note in passing, is that Wordsworth, who\r\nclung fervently to the historic foundations of society as it stands,\r\nwas wholly indifferent to history; while Byron, on the contrary, as\r\nthe fourth canto of _Childe Harold_ is enough to show, had at least\r\nthe sentiment of history in as great a degree as any poet that ever\r\nlived, and has given to it by far the most magnificent expression. No\r\ndoubt, it was history on its romantic, rather than its philosophic or\r\nits political side.\r\n\r\nOn Wordsworth's exact position in the hierarchy of sovereign poets,\r\na deep difference of estimate still divides even the most excellent\r\njudges. Nobody now dreams of placing him so low as the _Edinburgh\r\nReviewers_ did, nor so high as Southey placed him when he wrote to\r\nthe author of _Philip van Artevelde_ in 1829 that a greater poet than\r\nWordsworth there never has been nor ever will be. An extravagance of\r\nthis kind was only the outburst of generous friendship. Coleridge\r\ndeliberately placed Wordsworth \"nearest of all modern writers to\r\nShakespeare and Milton, yet in a kind perfectly unborrowed and his\r\nown.\" Arnold, himself a poet of rare and memorable quality, declares\r\nhis firm belief that the poetical performance of Wordsworth is, after\r\nthat of Shakespeare and Milton, undoubtedly the most considerable in\r\nour language from the Elizabethan age to the present time. Dryden,\r\nPope, Gray, Cowper, Goldsmith, Burns, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley,\r\nKeats--\"Wordsworth's name deserves to stand, and will finally stand,\r\nabove them all.\" Mr. Myers, also a poet, and the author of a volume on\r\nWordsworth as much distinguished by insight as by admirable literary\r\ngrace and power, talks of \"a Plato, a Dante, a Wordsworth,\" all three\r\nin a breath, as stars of equal magnitude in the great spiritual\r\nfirmament. To Mr. Swinburne, on the contrary, all these panegyrical\r\nestimates savour of monstrous and intolerable exaggeration. Amid these\r\ncontentions of celestial minds it will be safest to content ourselves\r\nwith one or two plain observations in the humble positive degree,\r\nwithout hurrying into high and final comparatives and superlatives.\r\n\r\nOne admission is generally made at the outset. Whatever definition\r\nof poetry we fix upon, whether that it is the language of passion or\r\nimagination formed into regular numbers; or, with Milton, that it\r\nshould be \"simple, sensuous, impassioned;\" in any case there are great\r\ntracts in Wordsworth which, by no definition and on no terms, can be\r\ncalled poetry. If we say with Shelley, that poetry is what redeems\r\nfrom decay the visitations of the divinity in man, and is the record\r\nof the best and happiest moments of the best and happiest minds, then\r\nare we bound to agree that Wordsworth records too many moments that\r\nare not specially good or happy, that he redeems from decay frequent\r\nvisitations that are not from any particular divinity in man, and\r\ntreats them all as very much on a level. Mr. Arnold is undoubtedly\r\nright in his view that, to be receivable as a classic, Wordsworth must\r\nbe relieved of a great deal of the poetical baggage that now encumbers\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe faults and hindrances in Wordsworth's poetry are obvious to every\r\nreader. For one thing, the intention to instruct, to improve the\r\noccasion, is too deliberate and too hardly pressed. \"We hate poetry,\"\r\nsaid Keats, \"that has a palpable design upon us. Poetry should be\r\ngreat and unobtrusive.\" Charles Lamb's friendly remonstrance on one of\r\nWordsworth's poems is applicable to more of them: \"The instructions\r\nconveyed in it are too direct; they don't slide into the mind of the\r\nreader while he is imagining no such matter.\"\r\n\r\nThen, except the sonnets and half a score of the pieces where he\r\nreaches his topmost height, there are few of his poems that are not\r\ntoo long, and it often happens even that no degree of reverence for\r\nthe teacher prevents one from finding passages of almost unbearable\r\nprolixity. A defence was once made by a great artist for what, to the\r\nunregenerate mind, seemed the merciless tardiness of movement in one\r\nof Goethe's romances, that it was meant to impress on his readers the\r\nslow march and the tedium of events in human life. The lenient reader\r\nmay give Wordsworth the advantage of the same ingenious explanation.\r\nWe may venture on a counsel which is more to the point, in warning the\r\nstudent that not seldom in these blocks of afflicting prose, suddenly\r\nwe come upon some of the profoundest and most beautiful passages that\r\nthe poet ever wrote. In deserts of preaching we find, almost within\r\nsight of one another, delightful oases of purest poetry. Besides being\r\nprolix, Wordsworth is often cumbrous; has often no flight; is not\r\nliquid, is not musical. He is heavy and self-conscious with the burden\r\nof his message. How much at his best he is, when, as in the admirable\r\nand truly Wordsworthian poem of _Michael_, he spares us a sermon and\r\nleaves us the story. Then, he is apt to wear a somewhat stiff-cut\r\ngarment of solemnity, when not solemnity, but either sternness or\r\nsadness, which are so different things, would seem the fitter mood. In\r\ntruth Wordsworth hardly knows how to be stern, as Dante or Milton was\r\nstern; nor has he the note of plangent sadness which strikes the ear\r\nin men as morally inferior to him as Rousseau, Keats, Shelley, or\r\nColeridge; nor has he the Olympian air with which Goethe delivered\r\nsage oracles. This mere solemnity is specially oppressive in some\r\nparts of the _Excursion_--the performance where we best see the whole\r\npoet, and where the poet most absolutely identifies himself with his\r\nsubject. Yet, even in the midst of these solemn discoursings, he\r\nsuddenly introduces an episode in which his peculiar power is at its\r\nheight. There is no better instance of this than the passage in the\r\nsecond Book of the _Excursion_, where he describes with a fidelity, at\r\nonce realistic and poetic, the worn-out almsman, his patient life and\r\nsorry death, and then the unimaginable vision in the skies, as they\r\nbrought the ancient man down through dull mists from the mountain\r\nridge to die. These hundred and seventy lines are like the landscape\r\nin which they were composed; you can no more appreciate the beauty of\r\nthe one by a single or a second perusal, than you can the other in a\r\nscamper through the vale on the box of the coach. But any lover of\r\npoetry who will submit himself with leisure and meditation to the\r\nimpressions of the story, the pity of it, the naturalness of it, the\r\nglory and the mystic splendours of the indifferent heavens, will feel\r\nthat here indeed is the true strength which out of the trivial raises\r\nexpression for the pathetic and the sublime.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from excess of prolixity and of solemnity, can it be\r\nreally contended that in purely poetic quality--in aerial freedom and\r\nspace, in radiant purity of light or depth and variety of colour, in\r\npenetrating and subtle sweetness of music, in supple mastery of the\r\ninstrument, in vivid spontaneity of imagination, in clean-cut sureness\r\nof touch--Wordsworth is not surpassed by men who were below him in\r\nweight and greatness? Even in his own field of the simple and the\r\npastoral has he touched so sweet and spontaneous a note as Burns's\r\n_Daisy_, or the _Mouse_? When men seek immersion or absorption in the\r\natmosphere of pure poesy, without lesson or moral, or anything but\r\ndelight of fancy and stir of imagination, they will find him less\r\ncongenial to their mood than poets not worthy to loose the latchet of\r\nhis shoe in the greater elements of his art. In all these comparisons,\r\nit is not merely Wordsworth's theme and motive and dominant note that\r\nare different; the skill of hand is different, and the musical ear and\r\nthe imaginative eye.\r\n\r\nTo maintain or to admit so much as this, however, is not to say the\r\nlast word. The question is whether Wordsworth, however unequal to\r\nShelley in lyric quality, to Coleridge or to Keats in imaginative\r\nquality, to Burns in tenderness, warmth, and that humour which is so\r\nnearly akin to pathos, to Byron in vividness and energy, yet possesses\r\nexcellences of his own which place him in other respects above\r\nthese master-spirits of his time. If the question is to be answered\r\naffirmatively, it is clear that only in one direction must we look.\r\nThe trait that really places Wordsworth on an eminence above his\r\npoetic contemporaries, and ranks him, as the ages are likely to rank\r\nhim, on a line just short of the greatest of all time, is his direct\r\nappeal to will and conduct. \"There is volition and self-government in\r\nevery line of his poetry, and his best thoughts come from his steady\r\nresistance to the ebb and flow of ordinary desires and regrets. He\r\ncontests the ground inch by inch with all despondent and indolent\r\nhumours, and often, too, with movements of inconsiderate and wasteful\r\njoy\" (_R.H. Hutton_). That would seem to be his true distinction and\r\nsuperiority over men to whom more had been given of fire, passion, and\r\nravishing music. Those who deem the end of poetry to be intoxication,\r\nfever, or rainbow dreams, can care little for Wordsworth. If its\r\nend be not intoxication, but on the contrary a search from the wide\r\nregions of imagination and feeling for elements of composure deep and\r\npure, and of self-government in a far loftier sense than the merely\r\nprudential, then Wordsworth has a gift of his own in which he was\r\napproached by no poet of his time. Scott's sane and humane genius,\r\nwith much the same aims, yet worked with different methods. He once\r\nremonstrated with Lockhart for being too apt to measure things by some\r\nreference to literature. \"I have read books enough,\" said Scott,\r\n\"and observed and conversed with enough of eminent and splendidly\r\ncultivated minds; but I assure you, I have heard higher sentiments\r\nfrom the lips of poor uneducated men and women, when exerting\r\nthe spirit of severe yet gentle heroism under difficulties and\r\nafflictions, or speaking their simple thoughts as to circumstances in\r\nthe lot of friends and neighbours, than I ever yet met with out of the\r\npages of the Bible. We shall never learn to respect our real calling\r\nand destiny, unless we have taught ourselves to consider everything as\r\nmoonshine compared with the education of the heart.\" This admirable\r\ndeliverance of Scott's is, so far as it goes, eminently Wordsworthian;\r\nbut Wordsworth went higher and further, striving not only to move the\r\nsympathies of the heart, but to enlarge the understanding, and exalt\r\nand widen the spiritual vision, all with the aim of leading us towards\r\nfirmer and austerer self-control.\r\n\r\nCertain favourers of Wordsworth answer our question with a triumphant\r\naffirmative, on the strength of some ethical, or metaphysical, or\r\ntheological system which they believe themselves to find in him. But\r\nis it credible that poets can permanently live by systems? Or is not\r\nsystem, whether ethical, theological, or philosophical, the heavy lead\r\nof poetry? Lucretius is indisputably one of the mighty poets of the\r\nworld, but Epicureanism is not the soul of that majestic muse. So with\r\nWordsworth. Thought is, on the whole, predominant over feeling in his\r\nverse, but a prevailing atmosphere of deep and solemn reflection does\r\nnot make a system. His theology and his ethics, and his so-called\r\nPlatonical metaphysics, have as little to do with the power of his\r\npoetry over us, as the imputed Arianism or any other aspect of the\r\ntheology of _Paradise Lost_ has to do with the strength and the\r\nsublimity of Milton, and his claim to a high perpetual place in the\r\nhearts of men. It is best to be entirely sceptical as to the existence\r\nof system and ordered philosophy in Wordsworth. When he tells us that\r\n\"one impulse from a vernal wood may teach you more of man, of moral\r\nevil and of good, than all the sages can,\" such a proposition cannot\r\nbe seriously taken as more than a half-playful sally for the benefit\r\nof some too bookish friend. No impulse from a vernal wood can teach us\r\nanything at all of moral evil and of good. When he says that it is his\r\nfaith, \"that every flower enjoys the air it breathes,\" and that\r\nwhen the budding twigs spread out their fan to catch the air, he is\r\ncompelled to think \"that there was pleasure there,\" he expresses a\r\ncharming poetic fancy and no more, and it is idle to pretend to see\r\nin it the fountain of a system of philosophy. In the famous _Ode on\r\nIntimations of Immortality_, the poet doubtless does point to a set of\r\nphilosophic ideas, more or less complete; but the thought from which\r\nhe sets out, that our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting, and that\r\nwe are less and less able to perceive the visionary gleam, less and\r\nless alive to the glory and the dream of external nature, as infancy\r\nrecedes further from us, is, with all respect for the declaration of\r\nMr. Ruskin to the contrary, contrary to notorious fact, experience,\r\nand truth. It is a beggarly conception, no doubt, to judge as if\r\npoetry should always be capable of a prose rendering; but it is at\r\nleast fatal to the philosophic pretension of a line or a stanza if,\r\nwhen it is fairly reduced to prose, the prose discloses that it is\r\nnonsense, and there is at least one stanza of the great _Ode_ that\r\nthis doom would assuredly await. Wordsworth's claim, his special gift,\r\nhis lasting contribution, lies in the extraordinary strenuousness,\r\nsincerity, and insight with which he first idealises and glorifies the\r\nvast universe around us, and then makes of it, not a theatre on which\r\nmen play their parts, but an animate presence, intermingling with\r\nour works, pouring its companionable spirit about us, and \"breathing\r\ngrandeur upon the very humblest face of human life.\" This twofold and\r\nconjoint performance, consciously and expressly--perhaps only too\r\nconsciously--undertaken by a man of strong inborn sensibility to\r\nnatural impressions, and systematically carried out in a lifetime\r\nof brooding meditation and active composition, is Wordsworth's\r\ndistinguishing title to fame and gratitude. In \"words that speak of\r\nnothing more than what we are,\" he revealed new faces of nature; he\r\ndwelt on men as they are, men themselves; he strove to do that which\r\nhas been declared to be the true secret of force in art, to make the\r\ntrivial serve the expression of the sublime. \"Wordsworth's distinctive\r\nwork,\" Mr. Ruskin has justly said (_Modern Painters_, iii. 293), \"was\r\na war with pomp and pretence, and a display of the majesty of simple\r\nfeelings and humble hearts, together with high reflective truth in his\r\nanalysis of the courses of politics and ways of men; without these,\r\nhis love of nature would have been comparatively worthless.\"\r\n\r\nYet let us not forget that he possessed the gift which to an artist is\r\nthe very root of the matter. He saw Nature truly, he saw her as she\r\nis, and with his own eyes. The critic whom I have just quoted boldly\r\npronounces him \"the keenest eyed of all modern poets for what is deep\r\nand essential in nature.\" When he describes the daisy, casting the\r\nbeauty of its star-shaped shadow on the smooth stone, or the boundless\r\ndepth of the abysses of the sky, or the clouds made vivid as fire by\r\nthe rays of light, every touch is true, not the copying of a literary\r\nphrase, but the result of direct observation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Nature has sides to which Wordsworth was not\r\nenergetically alive--Nature \"red in tooth and claw.\" He was not\r\nenergetically alive to the blind and remorseless cruelties of life\r\nand the world. When in early spring he heard the blended notes of the\r\nbirds, and saw the budding twigs and primrose tufts, it grieved him,\r\namid such fair works of nature, to think \"what man has made of man.\"\r\nAs if nature itself, excluding the conscious doings of that portion of\r\nnature which is the human race, and excluding also nature's own share\r\nin the making of poor Man, did not abound in raking cruelties and\r\nhorrors of her own. \"_Edel sei der Mensch_,\" sang Goethe in a noble\r\npsalm, \"_Hulfreich und gut, Denn das allein unterscheidet ihn, Von\r\nallen Wesen die wir kennen._\" \"_Let man be noble, helpful, and good,\r\nfor that alone distinguishes him from all beings that we know. No\r\nfeeling has nature: to good and bad gives the sun his light, and for\r\nthe evildoer as for the best shine moon and stars_.\" That the\r\nlaws which nature has fixed for our lives are mighty and eternal,\r\nWordsworth comprehended as fully as Goethe, but not that they are\r\nlaws pitiless as iron. Wordsworth had not rooted in him the sense of\r\nFate--of the inexorable sequences of things, of the terrible chain\r\nthat so often binds an awful end to some slight and trivial beginning.\r\n\r\nThis optimism or complacency in Wordsworth will be understood if we\r\ncompare his spirit and treatment with that of the illustrious French\r\npainter whose subjects and whose life were in some ways akin to his\r\nown. Millet, like Wordsworth, went to the realities of humble life for\r\nhis inspiration. The peasant of the great French plains and the forest\r\nwas to him what the Cumbrian dalesman was to Wordsworth. But he saw\r\nthe peasant differently. \"You watch figures in the fields,\" said\r\nMillet, \"digging and delving with spade or pick. You see one of them\r\nfrom time to time straightening his loins, and wiping his face with\r\nthe back of his hand. Thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy\r\nbrow. Is that the gay lively labour in which some people would have\r\nyou believe? Yet it is there that for me you must seek true humanity\r\nand great poetry. They say that I deny the charm of the country; I\r\nfind in it far more than charms, I find infinite splendours. I see\r\nin it, just as they do, the little flowers of which Christ said that\r\nSolomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of them. I see\r\nclearly enough the sun as he spreads his splendour amid the clouds.\r\nNone the less do I see on the plain, all smoking, the horses at the\r\nplough. I see in some stony corner a man all worn out, whose _han han_\r\nhave been heard ever since daybreak--trying to straighten himself a\r\nmoment to get breath.\" The hardness, the weariness, the sadness, the\r\nugliness, out of which Millet's consummate skill made pictures that\r\naffect us like strange music, were to Wordsworth not the real part of\r\nthe thing. They were all absorbed in the thought of nature as a whole,\r\nwonderful, mighty, harmonious, and benign.\r\n\r\nWe are not called upon to place great men of his stamp as if they were\r\ncollegians in a class-list. It is best to take with thankfulness and\r\nadmiration from each man what he has to give. What Wordsworth does\r\nis to assuage, to reconcile, to fortify. He has not Shakespeare's\r\nrichness and vast compass, nor Milton's sublime and unflagging\r\nstrength, nor Dante's severe, vivid, ardent force of vision. Probably\r\nhe is too deficient in clear beauty of form and in concentrated power\r\nto be classed by the ages among these great giants. We cannot be sure.\r\nWe may leave it to the ages to decide. But Wordsworth, at any rate, by\r\nhis secret of bringing the infinite into common life, as he evokes\r\nit out of common life, has the skill to lead us, so long as we yield\r\nourselves to his influence, into inner moods of settled peace,\r\nto touch \"the depth and not the tumult of the soul,\" to give us\r\nquietness, strength, steadfastness, and purpose, whether to do or to\r\nendure. All art or poetry that has the effect of breathing into men's\r\nhearts, even if it be only for a space, these moods of settled\r\npeace, and strongly confirming their judgment and their will for\r\ngood,--whatever limitations may be found besides, however prosaic may\r\nbe some or much of the detail,--is great art and noble poetry, and the\r\ncreator of it will always hold, as Wordsworth holds, a sovereign title\r\nto the reverence and gratitude of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An Address delivered before the Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nInstitution, _November_ 11, 1887.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I accepted the honour of the invitation to deliver the opening\r\naddress of your course, I have found no small difficulty in settling\r\ndown on an appropriate subject. I half wrote a discourse on modern\r\ndemocracy,--how the rule of numbers is to be reconciled with the rule\r\nof sage judgment, and the passion for liberty and equality is to be\r\nreconciled with sovereign regard for law, authority, and order; and\r\nhow our hopes for the future are to be linked to wise reverence for\r\ntradition and the past. But your secretary had emphatically warned me\r\noff all politics, and I feared that however carefully I might be on my\r\nguard against every reference to the burning questions of the hour,\r\nyet the clever eyes of political charity would be sure to spy out\r\nparty innuendoes in the most innocent deliverances of purely abstract\r\nphilosophy. Then for a day or two I lingered over a subject in a\r\nlittle personal incident. One Saturday night last summer I found\r\nmyself dining with an illustrious statesman on the Welsh border, and\r\non the Monday following I was seated under the acacias by the shore of\r\nthe Lake of Geneva, where Gibbon, a hundred years ago almost to the\r\nday, had, according to his own famous words, laid down his pen after\r\nwriting the last lines of his last page, and there under a serene sky,\r\nwith the silver orb of the moon reflected from the waters, and amid\r\nthe silence of nature, felt his joy at the completion of an immortal\r\ntask, dashed by melancholy that he had taken everlasting leave of an\r\nold and agreeable companion. It was natural that I should meditate on\r\nthe contrast that might be drawn between great literary performance\r\nand great political performance, between the making of history and the\r\nwriting of it,--a contrast containing matter enough not only for one,\r\nbut for a whole series of edifying and instructive discourses. But\r\nthere were difficulties here too, and the edifying discourse remains,\r\nlike many another, incomplete.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to ask you after all to pass a tranquil hour with me in\r\npondering a quiet chapter in the history of books. There is a loud cry\r\nin these days for clues that shall guide the plain man through the\r\nvast bewildering labyrinth of printed volumes. Everybody calls for\r\nhints what to read, and what to look out for in reading. Like all the\r\nrest of us, I have often been asked for a list of the hundred best\r\nbooks, and the other day a gentleman wrote to me to give him by return\r\nof post that far more difficult thing--list of the three best books in\r\nthe world. Both the hundred and the three are a task far too high for\r\nme; but perhaps you will let me try to indicate what, among so much\r\nelse, is one of the things best worth hunting for in books, and one\r\nof the quarters of the library where you may get on the scent. Though\r\ntranquil, it will be my fault if you find the hour dull, for this\r\nparticular literary chapter concerns life, manners, society, conduct,\r\nhuman nature, our aims, our ideals, and all besides that is most\r\nanimated and most interesting in man's busy chase after happiness and\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nWhat is wisdom? That sovereign word, as has often been pointed out, is\r\nused for two different things. It may stand for knowledge, learning,\r\nscience, systematic reasoning; or it may mean, as Coleridge has\r\ndefined it, common sense in an uncommon degree; that is to say, the\r\nunsystematic truths that come to shrewd, penetrating, and observant\r\nminds, from their own experience of life and their daily commerce with\r\nthe world, and that is called the wisdom of life, or the wisdom of the\r\nworld, or the wisdom of time and the ages. The Greeks had two words\r\nfor these two kinds of wisdom: one for the wise who scaled the heights\r\nof thought and knowledge; another for those who, without logical\r\nmethod, technical phraseology, or any of the parade of the Schools,\r\nwhether \"Academics old and new, Cynic, Peripatetic, the sect\r\nEpicurean, or Stoic severe,\" held up the mirror to human nature, and\r\ntook good counsel as to the ordering of character and of life.\r\n\r\nMill, in his little fragment on Aphorisms, has said that in the first\r\nkind of wisdom every age in which science flourishes ought to surpass\r\nthe ages that have gone before. In knowledge and methods of science\r\neach generation starts from the point at which its predecessor left\r\noff; but in the wisdom of life, in the maxims of good sense applied to\r\npublic and to private conduct, there is, said Mill, a pretty nearly\r\nequal amount in all ages.\r\n\r\nIf this seem doubtful to any one, let him think how many of the\r\nshrewdest moralities of human nature are to be found in writings as\r\nancient as the apocryphal Book of the Wisdom of Solomon and of Jesus\r\nthe Son of Sirach; as _Aesop's Fables_; as the oracular sentences that\r\nare to be found in Homer and the Greek dramatists and orators; as\r\nall that immense host of wise and pithy saws which, to the number\r\nof between four and five thousand, were collected from all ancient\r\nliterature by the industry of Erasmus in his great folio of Adages. As\r\nwe turn over these pages of old time, we almost feel that those are\r\nright who tell us that everything has been said, that the thing that\r\nhas been is the thing that shall be, and there is no new thing under\r\nthe sun. Even so, we are happily not bound to Schopenhauer's gloomy\r\nconclusion (_Werke_, v. 332), that \"The wise men of all times have\r\nalways said the same, and the fools, that is the immense majority, of\r\nall times have always done the same, that is to say, the opposite of\r\nwhat the wise have said; and that is why Voltaire tells us that we\r\nshall leave this world just as stupid and as bad as we found it when\r\nwe came here.\"\r\n\r\nIt is natural that this second kind of wisdom, being detached and\r\nunsystematic, should embody itself in the short and pregnant form of\r\nproverb, sentence, maxim, and aphorism. The essence of aphorism is the\r\ncompression of a mass of thought and observation into a single\r\nsaying. It is the very opposite of dissertation and declamation; its\r\ndistinction is not so much ingenuity, as good sense brought to a\r\npoint; it ought to be neither enigmatical nor flat, neither a truism\r\non the one hand, nor a riddle on the other. These wise sayings, said\r\nBacon, the author of some of the wisest of them, are not only for\r\nornament, but for action and business, having a point or edge, whereby\r\nknots in business are pierced and discovered. And he applauds Cicero's\r\ndescription of such sayings as saltpits,--that you may extract salt\r\nout of them, and sprinkle it where you will. They are the guiding\r\noracles which man has found out for himself in that great business\r\nof ours, of learning how to be, to do, to do without, and to depart.\r\nTheir range extends from prudential kitchen maxims, such as Franklin\r\nset forth in the sayings of Poor Richard about thrift in time and\r\nmoney, up to such great and high moralities of life as are the prose\r\nmaxims of Goethe,--just as Bacon's Essays extend from precepts as to\r\nbuilding and planting, up to solemn reflections on truth, death, and\r\nthe vicissitudes of things. They cover the whole field of man as he\r\nis, and life as it is, not of either as they ought to be; friendship,\r\nambition, money, studies, business, public duty, in all their actual\r\nlaws and conditions as they are, and not as the ideal moralist may\r\nwish that they were.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the wisdom of life must be commonplace, for the best\r\nof it is the result of the common experience of the world. Its most\r\nuniversal and important propositions must in a certain sense be\r\ntruisms. The road has been so broadly trodden by the hosts who have\r\ntravelled along it, that the main rules of the journey are clear\r\nenough, and we all know that the secret of breakdown and wreck is\r\nseldom so much an insufficient knowledge of the route, as imperfect\r\ndiscipline of the will. The truism, however, and the commonplace may\r\nbe stated in a form so fresh, pungent, and free from triviality, as\r\nto have all the force of new discovery. Hence the need for a caution,\r\nthat few maxims are to be taken without qualification. They seek\r\nsharpness of impression by excluding one side of the matter and\r\nexaggerating another, and most aphorisms are to be read as subject to\r\nall sorts of limits, conditions, and corrections.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the order of our knowledge is this: that we know\r\nbest, first, what we have divined by native instinct; second, what\r\nwe have learned by experience of men and things; third, what we have\r\nlearned not in books, but by books--that is, by the reflections that\r\nthey suggest; fourth, last and lowest, what we have learned in books\r\nor with masters. The virtue of an aphorism comes under the third of\r\nthese heads: it conveys a portion of a truth with such point as to set\r\nus thinking on what remains. Montaigne, who delighted in Plutarch,\r\nand kept him ever on his table, praises him in that besides his long\r\ndiscourses, \"there are a thousand others, which he has only touched\r\nand glanced upon, where he only points with his finger to direct us\r\nwhich way we may go if we will, and contents himself sometimes with\r\nonly giving one brisk hit in the nicest article of the question,\r\nfrom whence we are to grope out the rest.\" And this is what Plutarch\r\nhimself is driving at, when he warns young men that it is well to go\r\nfor a light to another man's fire, but by no means to tarry by it,\r\ninstead of kindling a torch of their own.\r\n\r\nGrammarians draw a distinction between a maxim and an aphorism, and\r\ntell us that while an aphorism only states some broad truth of general\r\nbearing, a maxim, besides stating the truth, enjoins a rule of conduct\r\nas its consequence. For instance, to say that \"There are some men with\r\njust imagination enough to spoil their judgment\" is an aphorism. But\r\nthere is action as well as thought in such sayings as this: \"'Tis a\r\ngreat sign of mediocrity to be always reserved in praise\"; or in this\r\nof M. Aurelius, \"When thou wishest to give thyself delight, think of\r\nthe excellences of those who live with thee; for instance, of the\r\nenergy of one, the modesty of another, the liberal kindness of a\r\nthird.\" Again, according to this distinction of the word, we are\r\nto give the name of aphorism to Pascal's saying that \"Most of the\r\nmischief in the world would never happen, if men would only be content\r\nto sit still in their parlours.\"[1] But we should give the name of\r\nmaxim to the profound and admirably humane counsel of a philosopher of\r\na very different school, that \"If you would love mankind, you should\r\nnot expect too much from them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: La Bruyère also says:--\"All mischief comes from our\r\nnot being able to be alone; hence play, luxury, dissipation, wine,\r\nignorance, calumny, envy, forgetfulness of one's self and of God.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the distinction is one without much difference; we need not labour\r\nit nor pay it further attention. Aphorism or maxim, let us remember\r\nthat this wisdom of life is the true salt of literature; that those\r\nbooks, at least in prose, are most nourishing which are most richly\r\nstored with it; and that it is one of the main objects, apart from the\r\nmere acquisition of knowledge, which men ought to seek in the reading\r\nof books.\r\n\r\nA living painter has said, that the longer he works, the more does be\r\nrealise how very little anybody except the trained artist actually\r\nperceives in the natural objects constantly before him; how blind men\r\nare to impressions of colour and light and form, which would be full\r\nof interest and delight, if people only knew how to see them. Are not\r\nmost of us just as blind to the thousand lights and shades in the\r\nmen and women around us? We live in the world as we live among\r\nfellow-inmates in a hotel, or fellow-revellers at a masquerade. Yet\r\nthis, to bring knowledge of ourselves and others \"home to our business\r\nand our bosoms,\" is one of the most important parts of culture.\r\n\r\nSome prejudice is attached in generous minds to this wisdom of the\r\nworld as being egotistical, poor, unimaginative, of the earth earthy.\r\nSince the great literary reaction at the end of the last century, men\r\nhave been apt to pitch criticism of life in the high poetic key. They\r\nhave felt with Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n  \"The human nature unto which I felt\r\n  That I belonged, and reverenced with love,\r\n  Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit\r\n  Diffused through time and space, with aid derived\r\n  Of evidence from monuments, erect,\r\n  Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest\r\n  In earth, the widely-scattered wreck sublime\r\n  Of vanished nations.\"\r\n\r\nThen again, there is another cause for the passing eclipse of interest\r\nin wisdom of the world. Extraordinary advances have been made in\r\nordered knowledge of the various stages of the long prehistoric\r\ndawn of human civilisation. The man of the flint implement and the\r\nfire-drill, who could only count up to five, and who was content to\r\nlive in a hut like a beehive, has drawn interest away from the man of\r\nthe market and the parlour. The literary passion for primitive times\r\nand the raw material of man has thrust polished man, the manufactured\r\narticle, into a secondary place. All this is in the order of things.\r\nIt is fitting enough that we should pierce into the origins of human\r\nnature. It is right, too, that the poets, the ideal interpreters of\r\nlife, should be dearer to us than those who stop short with mere\r\ndeciphering of what is real and actual. The poet has his own sphere\r\nof the beautiful and the sublime. But it is no less true that the\r\nenduring weight of historian, moralist, political orator, or preacher\r\ndepends on the amount of the wisdom of life that is hived in his\r\npages. They may be admirable by virtue of other qualities, by\r\nlearning, by grasp, by majesty of flight; but it is his moral\r\nsentences on mankind or the State that rank the prose writer among the\r\nsages. These show that he has an eye for the large truths of action,\r\nfor the permanent bearings of conduct, and for things that are for the\r\nguidance of all generations. What is it that makes Plutarch's Lives\r\n\"the pasture of great souls,\" as they were called by one who was\r\nherself a great soul? Because his aim was much less to tell a story\r\nthan, as he says, \"to decipher the man and his nature\"; and in\r\ndeciphering the man, to strike out pregnant and fruitful thoughts on\r\nall men. Why was it worth while for Mr. Jowett, the other day, to give\r\nus a new translation of Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War?\r\nAnd why is it worth your while, at least to dip in a serious spirit\r\ninto its pages? Partly, because the gravity and concision of\r\nThucydides are of specially wholesome example in these days of\r\nover-coloured and over-voluminous narrative; partly, because he knows\r\nhow to invest the wreck and overthrow of those small states with the\r\npathos and dignity of mighty imperial fall; but most of all, for the\r\nsake of the wise sentences that are sown with apt but not unsparing\r\nhand through the progress of the story. Well might Gray ask his friend\r\nwhether Thucydides' description of the final destruction of the\r\nAthenian host at Syracuse was not the finest thing he ever read in\r\nhis life; and assuredly the man who can read that stern tale without\r\nadmiration, pity, and awe may be certain that he has no taste for\r\nnoble composition, and no feeling for the deepest tragedy of mortal\r\nthings. But it is the sagacious sentences in the speeches of\r\nAthenians, Corinthians, Lacedaemonians, that do most of all to give\r\nto the historian his perpetuity of interest to every reader with the\r\nrudiments of a political instinct, and make Thucydides as modern as if\r\nhe had written yesterday.\r\n\r\nTacitus belongs to a different class among the great writers of the\r\nworld. He had, beyond almost any author of the front rank that has\r\never lived, the art of condensing his thought and driving it home\r\nto the mind of the reader with a flash. Beyond almost anybody, he\r\nsuffered from what a famous writer of aphorisms in our time has\r\ndescribed as \"the cursed ambition to put a whole book into a page, a\r\nwhole page into a phrase, and the phrase into a word.\" But the moral\r\nthought itself in Tacitus mostly belongs less to the practical wisdom\r\nof life, than to sombre poetic indignation, like that of Dante,\r\nagainst the perversities of men and the blindness of fortune.\r\n\r\nHorace's Epistles are a mine of genial, friendly, humane observation.\r\nThen there is none of the ancient moralists to whom the modern, from\r\nMontaigne, Charron, Ralegh, Bacon, downwards, owe more than to Seneca.\r\nSeneca has no spark of the kindly warmth of Horace; he has not the\r\nanimation of Plutarch; he abounds too much in the artificial and\r\nextravagant paradoxes of the Stoics. But, for all that, he touches the\r\ngreat and eternal commonplaces of human occasion--friendship, health,\r\nbereavement, riches, poverty, death--with a hand that places him high\r\namong the wise masters of life. All through the ages men tossed in the\r\nbeating waves of circumstance have found more abundantly in the essays\r\nand letters of Seneca than in any other secular writer words of good\r\ncounsel and comfort. And let this fact not pass, without notice of the\r\nlight that it sheds on the fact of the unity of literature, and of\r\nthe absurdity of setting a wide gulf between ancient or classical\r\nliterature and modern, as if under all dialects the partakers in\r\nGraeco-Roman civilisation, whether in Athens, Rome, Paris, Weimar,\r\nEdinburgh, London, Dublin, were not the heirs of a great common stock\r\nof thought as well as of speech.\r\n\r\nI certainly do not mean anything so absurd as that the moralities,\r\nwhether major or minor, whether affecting the foundation of conduct or\r\nthe surface of manners, remain fixed. On the contrary, one of the most\r\ninteresting things in literature is to mark the shifts and changes in\r\nmen's standards. For instance, Boswell tells a curious story of the\r\nfirst occasion on which Johnson met Sir Joshua Reynolds. Two ladies of\r\nthe company were regretting the death of a friend to whom they owed\r\ngreat obligations. Reynolds observed that they had at any rate the\r\ncomfort of being relieved from a debt of gratitude. The ladies were\r\nnaturally shocked at this singular alleviation of their grief, but\r\nJohnson defended it in his clear and forcible manner, and, says\r\nBoswell, \"was much pleased with the mind, the fair view of human\r\nnature, that it exhibited, like some of the reflections of\r\nRochefoucauld.\" On the strength of it he went home with Reynolds,\r\nsupped with him, and was his friend for life. No moralist with a\r\nreputation to lose would like to back Reynolds's remark in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nOur own generation in Great Britain has been singularly unfortunate\r\nin the literature of aphorism. One too famous volume of proverbial\r\nphilosophy had immense vogue, but it is so vapid, so wordy, so futile,\r\nas to have a place among the books that dispense with parody. Then,\r\nrather earlier in the century, a clergyman, who ruined himself by\r\ngambling, ran away from his debts to America, and at last blew his\r\nbrains out, felt peculiarly qualified to lecture mankind on moral\r\nprudence. He wrote a little book in 1820; called _Lacon; or Many\r\nThings in Few Words, addressed to those who think_. It is an awful\r\nexample to anybody who is tempted to try his hand at an aphorism.\r\nThus, \"Marriage is a feast where the grace is sometimes better than\r\nthe dinner.\" I had made some other extracts from this unhappy sage,\r\nbut you will thank me for having thrown them into the fire. Finally, a\r\ngreat authoress of our time was urged by a friend to fill up a gap in\r\nour literature by composing a volume of Thoughts: the result was that\r\nleast felicitous of performances, _Theophrastus Such_. One living\r\nwriter of genius has given us a little sheaf of subtly-pointed maxims\r\nin the _Ordeal of Richard Feverel_, and perhaps he will one day\r\ndivulge to the world the whole contents of Sir Austin Feverel's\r\nunpublished volume, _The Pilgrim's Scrip_.\r\n\r\nYet the wisdom of life has its full part in our literature. Keen\r\ninsight into peculiarities of individual motive, and concentrated\r\ninterest in the play of character, shine not merely in Shakespeare,\r\nwhose mighty soul, as Hallam says, was saturated with moral\r\nobservation, nor in the brilliant verse of Pope. For those who love\r\nmeditative reading on the ways and destinies of men, we have Burton\r\nand Fuller and Sir Thomas Browne in one age, and Addison, Johnson,\r\nand the rest of the Essayists, in another. Sir Thomas Overbury's\r\n_Characters_, written in the Baconian age, are found delightful\r\nby some; but for my own part, though I have striven to follow the\r\ncritic's golden rule, to have preferences but no exclusions, Overbury\r\nhas for me no savour. In the great art of painting moral portraits,\r\nor character-writing, the characters in Clarendon, or in Burnet's\r\n_History of His Own Time_, are full of life, vigour, and coherency,\r\nand are intensely attractive to read. I cannot agree with those who\r\nput either Clarendon or Burnet on a level with the characters in St.\r\nSimon or the Cardinal de Retz: there is a subtlety of analysis, a\r\nsearching penetration, a breadth of moral comprehension, in the\r\nFrenchmen, which I do not find, nor, in truth, much desire to find,\r\nin our countrymen. A homelier hand does well enough for homelier men.\r\nNevertheless, such characters as those of Falkland, or Chillingworth,\r\nby Clarendon, or Burnet's very different Lauderdale, are worth a\r\nthousand battle-pieces, cabinet plots, or parliamentary combinations,\r\nof which we never can be sure that the narrator either knew or has\r\ntold the whole story. It is true that these characters have not the\r\nstrange quality which some one imputed to the writing of Tacitus, that\r\nit seems to put the reader himself and the secrets of his own heart\r\ninto the confessional. It is in the novel that, in this country, the\r\nfaculty of observing social man and his peculiarities has found its\r\nmost popular instrument. The great novel, not of romance or adventure,\r\nbut of character and manners, from the mighty Fielding, down, at a\r\nlong interval, to Thackeray, covers the field that in France is held,\r\nand successfully held, against all comers, by her maxim-writers, like\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, and her character-writers, like La Bruyère. But the\r\nliterature of aphorism contains one English name of magnificent and\r\nimmortal lustre--the name of Francis Bacon. Bacon's essays are the\r\nunique masterpiece in our literature of this oracular wisdom of life,\r\napplied to the scattered occasions of men's existence. The Essays are\r\nknown to all the world; but there is another and perhaps a weightier\r\nperformance of Bacon's which is less known, or not known at all,\r\nexcept to students here and there. I mean the second chapter of the\r\neighth book of his famous treatise, _De Augmentis_. It has been\r\ntranslated into pithy English, and is to be found in the fifth volume\r\nof the great edition of Bacon, by Spedding and Ellis.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, among other things, he composes comments on between\r\nthirty and forty of what he calls the Aphorisms or Proverbs of\r\nSolomon, which he truly describes as containing, besides those of\r\na theological character, \"not a few excellent civil precepts and\r\ncautions, springing from the inmost recesses of wisdom, and extending\r\nto much variety of occasions.\" I know not where else to find more of\r\nthe salt of common sense in an uncommon degree than in Bacon's terse\r\ncomments on the Wise King's terse sentences, and in the keen,\r\nsagacious, shrewd wisdom of the world, lighted up by such brilliance\r\nof wit and affluence of illustration, in the pages that come after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis sort of wisdom was in the taste of the time; witness Ralegh's\r\n_Instructions to his Son_, and that curious collection \"of political\r\nand polemical aphorisms grounded on authority and experience,\"\r\nwhich he called by the name of the _Cabinet Council_. Harrington's\r\n_Political Aphorisms_, which came a generation later, are not moral\r\nsentences; they are a string of propositions in political theory,\r\nbreathing a noble spirit of liberty, though too abstract for practical\r\nguidance through the troubles of the day. But Bacon's admonitions\r\nhave a depth and copiousness that are all his own. He says that the\r\nknowledge of advancement in life, though abundantly practised, had\r\nnot been sufficiently handled in books, and so he here lays down\r\nthe precepts for what he calls the _Architecture of Fortune_. They\r\nconstitute the description of a man who is politic for his own\r\nfortune, and show how he may best shape a character that will attain\r\nthe ends of fortune.\r\n\r\n_First_, A man should accustom his mind to judge of the proportion and\r\nvalue of all things as they conduce to his fortune and ends.\r\n\r\n_Second_, Not to undertake things beyond his strength, nor to row\r\nagainst the stream.\r\n\r\n_Third_, Not to wait for occasions always, but sometimes to challenge\r\nand induce them, according to that saying of Demosthenes: \"In the same\r\nmanner as it is a received principle that the general should lead the\r\narmy, so should wise men lead affairs,\" causing things to be done\r\nwhich they think good, and not themselves waiting upon events.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, Not to take up anything which of necessity forestalls a\r\ngreat quantity of time, but to have this sound ever ringing in our\r\nears: \"Time is flying--time that can never be retrieved.\"\r\n\r\n_Fifth_, Not to engage one's-self too peremptorily in anything, but\r\never to have either a window open to fly out at, or a secret way to\r\nretire by.\r\n\r\n_Sixth_, To follow that ancient precept, not construed to any point\r\nof perfidiousness, but only to caution and moderation, that we are to\r\ntreat our friend as if he might one day be a foe, and our foe as if he\r\nshould one day be friend.\r\n\r\nAll these Bacon called the good arts, as distinguished from the evil\r\narts that had been described years before by Machiavelli in his\r\nfamous book _The Prince_, and also in his _Discourses_. Bacon called\r\nMachiavelli's sayings depraved and pernicious, and a corrupt wisdom,\r\nas indeed they are. He was conscious that his own maxims, too, stood\r\nin some need of elevation and of correction, for he winds up with\r\nwise warnings against being carried away by a whirlwind or tempest\r\nof ambition; by the general reminder that all things are vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit, and the particular reminder that, \"Being without\r\nwell-being is a curse, and the greater being, the greater curse,\" and\r\nthat \"all virtue is most rewarded, and all wickedness most punished in\r\nitself\"; by the question, whether this incessant, restless, and, as it\r\nwere, Sabbathless pursuit of fortune, leaves time for holier duties,\r\nand what advantage it is to have a face erected towards heaven, with a\r\nspirit perpetually grovelling upon earth, eating dust like a serpent;\r\nand finally, he says that it will not be amiss for men, in this eager\r\nand excited chase of fortune, to cool themselves a little with that\r\nconceit of Charles V. in his instructions to his son, that \"Fortune\r\nhath somewhat of the nature of a woman, who, if she be too closely\r\nwooed, is commonly the further off.\"\r\n\r\nThere is Baconian humour as well as a curious shrewdness in such an\r\nadmonition as that which I will here transcribe, and there are many\r\nlike it:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is therefore no unimportant attribute of prudence in a man to\r\n    be able to set forth to advantage before others, with grace and\r\n    skill, his virtues, fortunes, and merits (which may be done\r\n    without arrogance or breeding disgust); and again, to cover\r\n    artificially his weaknesses, defects, misfortunes, and disgraces;\r\n    dwelling upon the former and turning them to the light, sliding\r\n    from the latter or explaining them away by apt interpretations and\r\n    the like. Tacitus says of Mucianus, the wisest and most active\r\n    politician of his time, 'That he had a certain art of setting\r\n    forth to advantage everything he said or did.' And it requires\r\n    indeed some art, lest it become wearisome and contemptible; but\r\n    yet it is true that ostentation, though carried to the first\r\n    degree of vanity, is rather a vice in morals than in policy. For\r\n    as it is said of calumny, 'Calumniate boldly, for some of it\r\n    will stick,' so it may be said of ostentation (except it be in a\r\n    ridiculous degree of deformity), 'Boldly sound your own praises,\r\n    and some of them will stick.' It will stick with the more ignorant\r\n    and the populace, though men of wisdom may smile at it; and the\r\n    reputation won with many will amply countervail the disdain of a\r\n    few.... And surely no small number of those who are of a solid\r\n    nature, and who, from the want of this ventosity, cannot spread\r\n    all sail in pursuit of their own honour, suffer some prejudice and\r\n    lose dignity by their moderation.\"\r\n\r\nNobody need go to such writings as these for moral dignity or moral\r\nenergy. They have no place in that nobler literature, from Epictetus\r\nand Marcus Aurelius downwards, which lights up the young soul with\r\ngenerous aims, and fires it with the love of all excellence. Yet the\r\nmost heroic cannot do without a dose of circumspection. The counsels\r\nof old Polonius to Laertes are less sublime than Hamlet's soliloquy,\r\nbut they have their place. Bacon's chapters are a manual of\r\ncircumspection, whether we choose to give to circumspection a high or\r\na low rank in the list of virtues. Bacon knew of the famous city which\r\nhad three gates, and on the first the horseman read inscribed, \"Be\r\nbold\"; and on the second gate yet again, \"Be bold, and evermore be\r\nbold\"; and on the third it was written, \"Be not too bold.\"\r\n\r\nThis cautious tone had been brought about by the circumstances of\r\nthe time. Government was strict; dissent from current opinions was\r\ndangerous; there was no indifference and hardly any tolerance;\r\nauthority was suspicious and it was vindictive. When the splendid\r\ngenius of Burke rose like a new sun into the sky, the times were\r\nhappier, and nowhere in our literature does a noble prudence wear\r\nstatelier robes than in the majestic compositions of Burke.\r\n\r\nThose who are curious to follow the literature of aphorism into\r\nGermany, will, with the mighty exceptions of Goethe and Schiller, find\r\nbut a parched and scanty harvest. The Germans too often justify the\r\nunfriendly definition of an aphorism as a form of speech, that wraps\r\nup something quite plain in words that turn it into something very\r\nobscure. As old Fuller says, the writers have a hair hanging to the\r\nnib of their pen. Their shortness does not prevent them from being\r\ntiresome. They recall the French wit to whom a friend showed a\r\ndistich: \"Excellent,\" he said; \"but isn't it rather spun out?\"\r\n\r\nLichtenberg, a professor of physics, who was also a considerable hand\r\nat satire a hundred years ago, composed a collection of sayings, not\r\nwithout some wheat amid much chaff. A later German writer, of whom\r\nI will speak in a moment or two, Schopenhauer, has some excellent\r\nremarks on Self-reflection, and on the difference between those who\r\nthink for themselves and those who think for other people; between\r\ngenuine Philosophers, who look at things first hand for their own\r\nsake, and Sophists, who look at words and books for the sake of making\r\nan appearance before the world, and seek their happiness in what\r\nthey hope to get from others: he takes Herder for an example of the\r\nSophist, and Lichtenberg for the true Philosopher. It is true that we\r\nhear the voice of the Self-thinker, and not the mere Book-philosopher,\r\nif we may use for once those uncouth compounds, in such sayings as\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n  \"People who never have any time are the people\r\n  who do least.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The utmost that a weak head can get out of experience\r\n  is an extra readiness to find out the weaknesses\r\n  of other people.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Over-anxiously to feel and think what one could\r\n  have done, is the very worst thing one can do.\"\r\n\r\n  \"He who has less than he desires, should know that\r\n  he has more than he deserves.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Enthusiasts without capacity are the really dangerous\r\n  people.\"\r\n\r\nThis last, by the way, recalls a saying of the great French\r\nreactionary, De Bonald, which is never quite out of date: \"Follies\r\ncommitted by the sensible, extravagances uttered by the clever, crimes\r\nperpetrated by the good,--there is what makes revolutions.\"\r\n\r\nRadowitz was a Prussian soldier and statesman, who died in 1853,\r\nafter doing enough to convince men since that the revolution of 1848\r\nproduced no finer mind. He left among other things two or three\r\nvolumes of short fragmentary pieces on politics, religion, literature,\r\nand art. They are intelligent and elevated, but contain hardly\r\nanything to our point to-night, unless it be this,--that what is\r\ncalled Stupidity springs not at all from mere want of understanding,\r\nbut from the fact that the free use of a man's understanding is\r\nhindered by some definite vice: Frivolity, Envy, Dissipation,\r\nCovetousness, all these darling vices of fallen man,--these are at the\r\nbottom of what we name Stupidity. This is true enough, but it is not\r\nso much to the point as the saying of a highly judicious aphorist of\r\nmy own acquaintance, that \"Excessive anger against human stupidity is\r\nitself one of the most provoking of all forms of stupidity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother author of aphorisms of the Goethe period was Klinger, a\r\nplaywriter, who led a curious and varied life in camps and cities, who\r\nbegan with a vehement enthusiasm for the sentimentalism of Rousseau,\r\nand ended, as such men often end, with a hard and stubborn cynicism.\r\nHe wrote _Thoughts on different Subjects of the World and Literature_,\r\nwhich are intelligent and masculine, if they are not particularly\r\npungent in expression. One of them runs--\"He who will write\r\ninterestingly must be able to keep heart and reason in close and\r\nfriendliest connection. The heart must warm the reason, and reason\r\nmust in turn blow on the embers if they are to burst into flame.\" This\r\nillustrates what an aphorism should not be. Contrast its clumsiness\r\nwith the brevity of the famous and admirable saying of Vauvenargues,\r\nthat \"great thoughts come from the heart.\"\r\n\r\nSchopenhauer gave to one of his minor works the name of _Aphorismen zu\r\nLebens-Weisheit_, \"Aphorisms for the Wisdom of Life,\" and he put to\r\nit, by way of motto, Chamfort's saying, \"Happiness is no easy matter;\r\n'tis very hard to find it within ourselves, and impossible to find it\r\nanywhere else.\" Schopenhauer was so well read in European literature,\r\nhe had such natural alertness of mind, and his style is so pointed,\r\ndirect, and wide-awake, that these detached discussions are\r\ninteresting and most readable; but for the most part discussions they\r\nare, and not aphorisms. Thus, in the saying that \"The perfect man of\r\nthe world should be he who never sticks fast in indecision, nor ever\r\nfalls into overhaste,\" the force of it lies in what goes before and\r\nwhat follows after. The whole collection, winding up with the chapter\r\nof Counsels and Maxims, is in the main an unsystematic enforcement of\r\nthose peculiar views of human happiness and its narrow limits which\r\nproved to be the most important part of Schopenhauer's system. \"The\r\nsovereign rule in the wisdom of life,\" he said, \"I see in Aristotle's\r\nproposition (_Eth. Nic_. vii. 12), [Greek: ho phronimos to alupon\r\ndiokei, ou to haedu]: Not pleasure but freedom from pain is what\r\nthe sensible man goes after.\" The second volume, of Detached though\r\nsystematically Ordered Thoughts on Various Circumstances, is\r\nmiscellaneous in its range of topics, and is full of suggestion; but\r\nthe thoughts are mainly philosophical and literary, and do not come\r\nvery close to practical wisdom. In truth, so negative a view of\r\nhappiness, such pale hopes and middling expectations, could not guide\r\na man far on the path of active prudence, where we naturally take for\r\ngranted that the goal is really something substantial, serious, solid,\r\nand positive.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Burke says on the point raised above: \"I am satisfied the\r\nideas of pain are much more powerful than those which enter on the\r\npart of pleasure. Without all doubt, the torments which we may be made\r\nto suffer are much greater in their effect on the body and mind, than\r\nany pleasures which the most learned voluptuary could suggest. Nay,\r\nI am in great doubt whether any man could be found, who would earn a\r\nlife of the most perfect satisfaction at the price of ending it in\r\nthe torments which justice inflicted in a few hours on the late\r\nunfortunate regicide in France\" (_Sublime and Beautiful_, pt. I. sec.\r\nvii.). The reference is, of course, to Damien.]\r\n\r\nNobody cared less than Schopenhauer for the wisdom that is drawn from\r\nbooks, or has said such hard things of mere reading. In the short\r\npiece to which I have already referred (p. 80), he works out the\r\ndifference between the Scholar who has read in books, and the\r\nThinkers, the Geniuses, the Lights of the World, and Furtherers of\r\nthe human race, who have read directly from the world's own pages.\r\nReading, he says, is only a _succedaneum_ for one's own thinking.\r\nReading is thinking with a strange head instead of one's own. People\r\nwho get their wisdom out of books are like those who have got their\r\nknowledge of a country from the descriptions of travellers. Truth that\r\nhas been picked up from books only sticks to us like an artificial\r\nlimb, or a false tooth, or a rhinoplastic nose; the truth we have\r\nacquired by our own thinking is like the natural member. At least, as\r\nGoethe puts it in his verse,\r\n\r\n  Was du ererbt von deinen Vätern hast,\r\n  Erwirb es, um es zu besitzen.\r\n\r\n  _What from thy fathers thou dost inherit, be sure thou\r\n  earn it, that so it may become thine own_.\r\n\r\nIt is only Goethe and Schiller, and especially Goethe, \"the strong,\r\nmuch-toiling sage, with spirit free from mists, and sane and clear,\"\r\nwho combine the higher and the lower wisdom, and have skill to put\r\nmoral truths into forms of words that fix themselves with stings in\r\nthe reader's mind. All Goethe's work, whether poetry or prose, his\r\nplays, his novels, his letters, his conversations, are richly bestrewn\r\nwith the luminous sentences of a keen-eyed, steadfast, patient,\r\nindefatigable watcher of human life. He deals gravely and sincerely\r\nwith men. He has none of that shallow irony by which small men who\r\nhave got wrong with the world seek a shabby revenge. He tells us the\r\nwhole truth. He is not of those second-rate sages who keep their own\r\nsecrets, externally complying with all the conventions of speech and\r\ndemeanour, while privately nourishing unbridled freedom of opinion\r\nin the inner sanctuary of the mind. He handles soberly, faithfully,\r\nlaboriously, cheerfully, every motive and all conduct. He marks\r\nhimself the friend, the well-wisher, and the helper. I will not begin\r\nto quote from Goethe, for I should never end. The volume of _Spruche_,\r\nor aphorisms in rhyme and prose in his collected works, is accessible\r\nto everybody, but some of his wisest and finest are to be found in the\r\nplays, like the well-known one in his _Tasso_, \"In stillness Talent\r\nforms itself, but Character in the great current of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut here is a concentrated admonition from the volume that I have\r\nnamed, that will do as well as any other for an example of his\r\ntemper--\r\n\r\n  \"Wouldst fashion for thyself a seemly life?--\r\n  Then fret not over what is past and gone;\r\n  And spite of all thou mayst have lost behind,\r\n  Yet act as if thy life were just begun.\r\n  What each day wills, enough for thee to know;\r\n  What each day wills, the day itself will tell.\r\n  Do thine own task, and be therewith content;\r\n  What others do, that shalt thou fairly judge;\r\n  Be sure that thou no brother-mortal hate,\r\n  Then all besides leave to the Master Power.\"\r\n\r\nIf any of you should be bitten with an unhappy passion for the\r\ncomposition of aphorisms, let me warn such an one that the power of\r\nobserving life is rare, the power of drawing new lessons from it is\r\nrarer still, and the power of condensing the lesson in a pointed\r\nsentence is rarest of all. Beware of cultivating this delicate art.\r\nThe effort is only too likely to add one more to that perverse\r\nclass described by Gibbon, who strangle a thought in the hope of\r\nstrengthening it, and applaud their own skill when they have shown\r\nin a few absurd words the fourth part of an idea. Let me warmly urge\r\nanybody with so mistaken an ambition, instead of painfully distilling\r\npoor platitudes of his own, to translate the shrewd saws of the wise\r\nbrowed Goethe.\r\n\r\nSome have found light in the sayings of Balthasar Gracian, a Spaniard,\r\nwho flourished at the end of the seventeenth century, whose maxims\r\nwere translated into English at the very beginning of the eighteenth,\r\nand who was introduced to the modern public in an excellent article\r\nby Sir M.E. Grant Duff a few years ago. The English title is\r\nattractive,--_The Art of Prudence, or a Companion for a Man of Sense_.\r\nI do not myself find Gracian much of a companion, though some of his\r\naphorisms give a neat turn to a commonplace. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"The pillow is a dumb sibyl. To sleep upon a thing\r\n  that is to be done, is better than to be wakened up by\r\n  one already done.\"\r\n\r\n  \"To equal a predecessor one must have twice his\r\n  worth.\"\r\n\r\n  \"What is easy ought to be entered upon as though\r\n  it were difficult, and what is difficult as though it were\r\n  easy.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Those things are generally best remembered which\r\n  ought most to be forgot. Not seldom the surest remedy\r\n  of the evil consists in forgetting it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is France that excels in the form no less than in the matter of\r\naphorism, and for the good reason that in France the arts of polished\r\nsociety were relatively at an early date the objects of a serious and\r\ndeliberate cultivation, such as was and perhaps remains unknown in the\r\nrest of Europe. Conversation became a fine art. \"I hate war,\" said\r\none; \"it spoils conversation.\" The leisured classes found their\r\nkeenest relish in delicate irony, in piquancy, in contained vivacity,\r\nin the study of niceties of observation and finish of phrase. You have\r\na picture of it in such a play as Molière's _Misanthropist_, where we\r\nsee a section of the polished life of the time--men and women making\r\nand receiving compliments, discoursing on affairs with easy lightness,\r\nflitting backwards and forwards with a thousand petty hurries, and\r\namong them one singular figure, hoarse, rough, sombre, moving with a\r\nchilling reality in the midst of frolicking shadows. But the shadows\r\nwere all in all to one another. Not a point of conduct, not a subtlety\r\nof social motive, escaped detection and remark.\r\n\r\nDugald Stewart has pointed to the richness of the French tongue\r\nin appropriate and discriminating expressions for varieties of\r\nintellectual turn and shade. How many of us, who claim to a reasonable\r\nknowledge of French, will undertake easily to find English\r\nequivalents for such distinctions as are expressed in the following\r\nphrases--Esprit juste, esprit étendu, esprit fin, esprit délié, esprit\r\nde lumière. These numerous distinctions are the evidence, as Stewart\r\nsays, of the attention paid by the cultivated classes to delicate\r\nshades of mind and feeling. Compare with them the colloquial use of\r\nour terribly overworked word \"clever.\" Society and conversation have\r\nnever been among us the school of reflection, the spring of literary\r\ninspiration, that they have been in France. The English rule has\r\nrather been like that of the ancient Persians, that the great thing is\r\nto learn to ride, to shoot with the bow, and to speak the truth. There\r\nis much in it. But it has been more favourable to strength than to\r\neither subtlety or finish.\r\n\r\nOne of the most commonly known of all books of maxims, after the\r\nProverbs of Solomon, are the Moral Reflections of La Rochefoucauld.\r\nThe author lived at court, himself practised all the virtues which\r\nhe seemed to disparage, and took so much trouble to make sure of the\r\nright expression that many of these short sentences were more than\r\nthirty times revised. They were given to the world in the last half\r\nof the seventeenth century in a little volume which Frenchmen used\r\nto know by heart, which gave a new turn to the literary taste of the\r\nnation, and which has been translated into every civilised tongue. It\r\npaints men as they would be if self-love were the one great mainspring\r\nof human action, and it makes magnanimity itself no better than\r\nself-interest in disguise.\r\n\r\n  \"Interest,\" he says, \"speaks all sorts of tongues and\r\n  plays all sorts of parts, even the part of the disinterested.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Gratitude is with most people only a strong desire\r\n  for greater benefits to come.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Love of justice is with most of us nothing but the\r\n  fear of suffering injustice.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Friendship is only a reciprocal conciliation of\r\n  interests, a mutual exchange of good offices; it is a\r\n  species of commerce out of which self-love always\r\n  intends to make something.\"\r\n\r\n  \"We have all strength enough to endure the troubles\r\n  of other people.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Our repentance is not so much regret for the ill we\r\n  have done, as fear of the ill that may come to us in\r\n  consequence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd everybody here knows the saying that \"In the adversity of our best\r\nfriends we often find something that is not exactly displeasing.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot wonder that in spite of their piquancy of form, such\r\nsentences as these have aroused in many minds an invincible repugnance\r\nfor what would be so tremendous a calumny on human nature, if the\r\nbook were meant to be a picture of human nature as a whole. \"I count\r\nRochefoucauld's _Maxims_,\" says one critic, \"a bad book. As I am\r\nreading it, I feel discomfort; I have a sense of suffering which I\r\ncannot define. Such thoughts tarnish the brightness of the soul;\r\nthey degrade the heart.\" Yet as a faithful presentation of human\r\nselfishness, and of you and me in so far as we happen to be mainly\r\nselfish, the odious mirror has its uses by showing us what manner of\r\nman we are or may become. Let us not forget either that not quite all\r\nis selfishness in La Rochefoucauld. Everybody knows his saying that\r\nhypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue. There is a subtle\r\ntruth in this, too,--that to be in too great a hurry to discharge an\r\nobligation is itself a kind of ingratitude. Nor is there any harm in\r\nthe reflection that no fool is so troublesome as the clever fool; nor\r\nin this, that only great men have any business with great defects;\r\nnor, finally, in the consolatory saying, that we are never either so\r\nhappy or so unhappy as we imagine.\r\n\r\nNo more important name is associated with the literature of aphorism\r\nthan that of Pascal; but the Thoughts of Pascal concern the deeper\r\nthings of speculative philosophy and religion, rather than the wisdom\r\nof daily life, and, besides, though aphoristic in form, they are in\r\nsubstance systematic. \"I blame equally,\" he said, \"those who take\r\nsides for praising man, those who are for blaming him, and those\r\nwho amuse themselves with him: the only wise part is search for\r\ntruth--search with many sighs.\" On man, as he exists in society, he\r\nsaid little; and what he said does not make us hopeful. He saw the\r\ndarker side. \"If everybody knew what one says of the other, there\r\nwould not be four friends left in the world.\" \"Would you have men\r\nthink well of you, then do not speak well of yourself.\" And so forth.\r\nIf you wish to know Pascal's theory you may find it set out in\r\nbrilliant verse in the opening lines of the second book of Pope's\r\n_Essay on Man_. \"What a chimera is Man!\" said Pascal. \"What a confused\r\nchaos! What a subject of contradiction! A professed judge of all\r\nthings, and yet a feeble worm of the earth; the great depository and\r\nguardian of truth, and yet a mere huddle of uncertainty; the glory and\r\nthe scandal of the universe.\" Shakespeare was wiser and deeper when,\r\nunder this quintessence of dust, he discerned what a piece of work is\r\nman, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, in form and moving\r\nhow express and admirable. That serene and radiant faith is the\r\nsecret, added to matchless gifts of imagination and music, why\r\nShakespeare is the greatest of men.\r\n\r\nThere is a smart, spurious wisdom of the world which has the\r\nbitterness not of the salutary tonic but of mortal poison; and of this\r\nkind the master is Chamfort, who died during the French Revolution\r\n(and for that matter died of it), and whose little volume of thoughts\r\nis often extremely witty, always pointed, but not seldom cynical and\r\nfalse. \"If you live among men,\" he said, \"the heart must either break\r\nor turn to brass.\" \"The public, the public,\" he cried; \"how many fools\r\ndoes it take to make a public!\" \"What is celebrity? The advantage of\r\nbeing known to people who don't know you.\"\r\n\r\nAll literatures might be ransacked in vain for a more repulsive saying\r\nthan this, that \"A man must swallow a toad every morning if he wishes\r\nto be quite sure of finding nothing still more disgusting before the\r\nday is over.\" We cannot be surprised to hear of the lady who said that\r\na conversation with Chamfort in the morning made her melancholy until\r\nbedtime. Yet Chamfort is the author of the not unwholesome saying that\r\n\"The most wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed.\"\r\nOne of his maxims lets us into the secret of his misanthropy.\r\n\"Whoever,\" he said, \"is not a misanthropist at forty can never have\r\nloved mankind.\" It is easy to know what this means. Of course if a man\r\nis so superfine that he will not love mankind any longer than he can\r\nbelieve them to be demigods and angels, it is true that at forty he\r\nmay have discovered that they are neither. Beginning by looking for\r\nmen to be more perfect than they can be, he ends by thinking them\r\nworse than they are, and then he secretly plumes himself on his\r\nsuperior cleverness in having found humanity out. For the deadliest\r\nof all wet blankets give me a middle-aged man who has been most of a\r\nvisionary in his youth.\r\n\r\nTo correct all this, let us recall Helvétius's saying that I have\r\nalready quoted, which made so deep an impression on Jeremy Bentham:\r\n\"In order to love mankind, we must not expect too much from them.\" And\r\nlet us remember that Fénelon, one of the most saintly men that ever\r\nlived, and whose very countenance bore such a mark of goodness that\r\nwhen he was in a room men found they could not desist from looking at\r\nhim, wrote to a friend the year before he died, \"I ask little from\r\nmost men; I try to render them much, and to expect nothing in return,\r\nand I get very well out of the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nChamfort I will leave, with his sensible distinction between Pride and\r\nVanity. \"A man,\" he says, \"has advanced far in the study of morals who\r\nhas mastered the difference between pride and vanity. The first is\r\nlofty, calm, immovable; the second is uncertain, capricious, unquiet.\r\nThe one adds to a man's stature; the other only puffs him out. The one\r\nis the source of a thousand virtues; the other is that of nearly all\r\nvices and all perversities. There is a kind of pride in which are\r\nincluded all the commandments of God; and a kind of vanity which\r\ncontains the seven mortal sins.\"\r\n\r\nI will say little of La Bruyère, by far the greatest, broadest,\r\nstrongest, of French character-writers, because his is not one of the\r\nhouses of which you can judge by a brick or two taken at random. For\r\nthose in whom the excitements of modern literature have not burnt up\r\nthe faculty of sober meditation on social man, La Bruyère must always\r\nbe one of the foremost names. Macaulay somewhere calls him thin. But\r\nMacaulay has less ethical depth, and less perception of ethical depth,\r\nthan any writer that ever lived with equally brilliant gifts in other\r\nways; and _thin_ is the very last word that describes this admirable\r\nmaster. If one seeks to measure how far removed the great classic\r\nmoralists are from thinness, let him turn from La Bruyère to the inane\r\nsubtleties and meaningless conundrums, not worth answering, that do\r\nduty for analysis of character in some modern American literature.\r\nWe feel that La Bruyère, though retiring, studious, meditative, and\r\nself-contained, has complied with the essential condition of looking\r\nat life and men themselves, and with his own eyes. His aphoristic\r\nsayings are the least important part of him, but here are one or two\r\nexamples:--\r\n\r\n  \"Eminent posts make great men greater, and little\r\n  men less.\"\r\n\r\n  \"There is in some men a certain mediocrity of mind\r\n  that helps to make them wise.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The flatterer has not a sufficiently good opinion\r\n  either of himself or of others.\"\r\n\r\n  \"People from the provinces and fools are always\r\n  ready to take offence, and to suppose that you are\r\n  laughing at them: we should never risk a pleasantry,\r\n  except with well-bred people, and people with brains.\r\n\r\n  \"All confidence is dangerous, unless it is complete,\r\n  there are few circumstances in which it is not best\r\n  either to hide all or to tell all.\"\r\n\r\n  \"When the people is in a state of agitation, we do\r\n  not see how quiet is to return; and when it is tranquil,\r\n  we do not see how the quiet is to be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Men count for almost nothing the virtues of the\r\n  heart, and idolise gifts of body or intellect. The man\r\n  who quite coolly, and with no idea that he is offending\r\n  modesty, says that he is kind-hearted, constant, faithful,\r\n  sincere, fair, grateful, would not dare to say that\r\n  he is quick and clever, that he has fine teeth and a\r\n  delicate skin.\"\r\n\r\nI will say nothing of Rivarol, a caustic wit of the revolutionary\r\ntime, nor of Joubert, a writer of sayings of this century, of whom\r\nMr. Matthew Arnold has said all that needs saying. He is delicate,\r\nrefined, acute, but his thoughts were fostered in the hothouse of a\r\ncoterie, and have none of the salt and sapid flavour that comes to\r\nmore masculine spirits from active contact with the world.\r\n\r\nI should prefer to close this survey in the sunnier moral climate of\r\nVauvenargues. His own life was a pathetic failure in all the aims of\r\nouter circumstance. The chances of fortune and of health persistently\r\nbaulked him, but from each stroke he rose up again, with undimmed\r\nserenity and undaunted spirit. As blow fell upon blow, the sufferer\r\nhold, firmly to his incessant lesson,--Be brave, persevere in the\r\nfight, struggle on, do not let go, think magnanimously of man and\r\nlife, for man is good and life is affluent and fruitful. He died a\r\nhundred and forty years ago, leaving a little body of maxims behind\r\nhim which, for tenderness, equanimity, cheerfulness, grace, sobriety,\r\nand hope, are not surpassed in prose literature. \"One of the noblest\r\nqualities in our nature,\" he said, \"is that we are able so easily to\r\ndispense with greater perfection.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Magnanimity owes no account to prudence of its\r\n  motives.\"\r\n\r\n  \"To do great things a man must live as though he\r\n  had never to die.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The first days of spring have less grace than the\r\n  growing virtue of a young man.\"\r\n\r\n  \"You must rouse in men a consciousness of their\r\n  own prudence and strength if you would raise their\r\n  character.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Tocqueville said: \"He who despises mankind will never get the\r\nbest out of either others or himself.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The reader who cares to know more about Vauvenargues will\r\nfind a chapter on him in the present writer's _Miscellanies_, vol.\r\nii.]\r\n\r\nThe best known of Vauvenargues' sayings, as it is the deepest and the\r\nbroadest, is the far-reaching sentence already quoted, that \"Great\r\nthoughts come from the heart.\" And this is the truth that shines out\r\nas we watch the voyagings of humanity from the \"wide, grey, lampless\r\ndepths\" of time. Those have been greatest in thought who have been\r\nbest endowed with faith, hope, sympathy, and the spirit of effort. And\r\nnext to them come the great stern, mournful men, like Tacitus, Dante,\r\nPascal, who, standing as far aloof from the soft poetic dejection\r\nof some of the moods of Shelley or Keats as from the savage fury\r\nof Swift, watch with a prophet's indignation the heedless waste of\r\nfaculty and opportunity, the triumph of paltry motive and paltry aim,\r\nas if we were the flies of a summer noon, which do more than any\r\nactive malignity to distort the noble lines, and to weaken or to\r\nfrustrate the strong and healthy parts, of human nature. For practical\r\npurposes all these complaints of man are of as little avail as Johnson\r\nfound the complaint that of the globe so large a space should be\r\noccupied by the uninhabitable ocean, encumbered by naked mountains,\r\nlost under barren sands, scorched by perpetual heat or petrified by\r\nperpetual frost, and so small a space be left for the production of\r\nfruits, the pasture of cattle, and the accommodation of men.\r\n\r\nWhen we have deducted, said Johnson, all the time that is absorbed\r\nin sleep, or appropriated to the other demands of nature, or the\r\ninevitable requirements of social intercourse, all that is torn from\r\nus by violence of disease, or imperceptibly stolen from us by languor,\r\nwe may realise of how small a portion of our time we are truly\r\nmasters. And the same consideration of the ceaseless and natural\r\npre-occupations of men in the daily struggle will reconcile the wise\r\nman to all the disappointments, delays, shortcomings of the world,\r\nwithout shaking the firmness of his own faith, or the intrepidity of\r\nhis own purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE ON POPULAR GOVERNMENT.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: February 1886.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If the government of the Many,\" says the distinguished author of the\r\nvolume before us, \"be really inevitable, one would have thought that\r\nthe possibility of discovering some other and newer means of enabling\r\nIt to fulfil the ends for which all governments exist would have been\r\na question exercising all the highest powers of the strongest minds,\r\nparticularly in the community which, through the success of its\r\npopular institutions, has paved the way for modern Democracy. Yet\r\nhardly anything worth mentioning has been produced on the subject in\r\nEngland or on the Continent.\" To say this, by the way, Is strangely to\r\nignore three or four very remarkable books that have been published\r\nwithin the last twenty or five-and-twenty years, that have excited\r\nimmense attention and discussion, and that are the work of minds that\r\neven Sir Henry Maine would hardly call weak or inactive. We are no\r\nadherents of any of Mr. Hare's proposals, but there are\r\nimportant public men who think that his work on the _Election of\r\nRepresentatives_ is as conspicuous a landmark in politics as the\r\n_Principia_ was in natural philosophy. J.S. Mill's volume on\r\n_Representative Government_, which appeared in 1861, was even a more\r\nmemorable contribution towards the solution of the very problem\r\ndefined by Sir Henry Maine, than was the older Mill's article on\r\nGovernment In 1820 to the political difficulties of the eve of the\r\nReform Bill. Again, Lord Grey's work on Parliamentary Government\r\nfailed in making its expected mark on legislation, but it was worth\r\nmentioning because It goes on the lines of the very electoral law in\r\nBelgium which Sir Henry Maine (p. 109) describes as deserving our most\r\nrespectful attention--an attention, I suspect, which it is as little\r\nlikely to receive from either of our two political parties as Lord\r\nGrey's suggestions. Nor should we neglect Sir G.C. Lewis's little\r\nbook, or Mr. Harrison's volume on _Order and Progress_, which abounds\r\nin important criticism and suggestion for the student of the abstract\r\npolitics of modern societies. In the United States, too, and In our\r\nown colonies, there have been attempts, not without merit, to state\r\nand to deal with some of the drawbacks of popular government.\r\n\r\nNothing has been done, however, that makes the appearance in the field\r\nof a mind of so high an order as Sir Henry Maine's either superfluous\r\nor unwelcome. It is hardly possible that he should discuss any subject\r\nwithin the publicist's range, without bringing into light some of its\r\nless superficial aspects, and adding observations of originality and\r\nvalue to the stock of political thought. To set people thinking at all\r\non the more general and abstract truths of that great subject which is\r\ncommonly left to be handled lightly, unsystematically, fragmentarily,\r\nin obedience to the transitory necessities of the day, by Ministers,\r\nmembers of Parliament, journalists, electors, and the whole host who\r\nlive intellectually and politically from hand to mouth, is in itself a\r\nservice of all but the first order. Service of the very first order is\r\nnot merely to propound objections, but to devise working answers, and\r\nthis is exactly what Sir Henry Maine abstains from doing.\r\n\r\nNo one will think the moment for a serious political inquiry ill\r\nchosen. We have just effected an immense recasting of our system of\r\nparliamentary representation. The whole consequences of the two great\r\nActs of 1884 and 1885 are assuredly not to be finally gauged by\r\nanything that has happened during the recent election. Yet even this\r\nsingle election has brought about a crisis of vast importance in\r\none part of the United Kingdom, by forcing the question of an Irish\r\nconstitution to the front. It is pretty clear, also, that the infusion\r\nof a large popular element into the elective House has made more\r\ndifficult the maintenance of its old relations with the hereditary\r\nHouse. Even if there were no others, these two questions alone, and\r\nespecially the first of them, will make the severest demands on the\r\nbest minds in the country. We shall be very fortunate if the crisis\r\nproduces statesmen as sagacious as those American publicists of whom\r\nSir Henry Maine rightly entertains so exalted an opinion.\r\n\r\nWhether or not we are on the threshold of great legislative changes,\r\nit is in any case certain that the work of government will be carried\r\non under new parliamentary and social conditions. In meeting this\r\nprospect, we have the aid neither of strong and systematic political\r\nschools, nor powerful and coherent political parties. No one can\r\npretend, for instance, that there is any body of theoretic opinion so\r\ncompact and so well thought out as Benthamism was in its own day\r\nand generation. Again, in practice, there are ominous signs that\r\nParliament is likely to break up into groups; and the substitution of\r\ngroups for parties is certain, if continental experience is to count\r\nfor anything, to create new obstacles in the way of firm and stable\r\ngovernment. Weak government throws power to something which usurps\r\nthe name of public opinion, and public opinion as expressed by the\r\nventriloquists of the newspapers is at once more capricious and more\r\nvociferous than it ever was. This was abundantly shown during the last\r\nfive years by a variety of unfortunate public adventures. Then,\r\ndoes the excitement of democracy weaken the stability of national\r\ntemperament? By setting up what in physics would be called a highly\r\nincreased molecular activity, does it disturb not merely conservative\r\nrespect for institutions, but respect for coherence and continuity of\r\nopinion and sentiment in the character of the individual himself? Is\r\nthere a fluidity of character in modern democratic societies which\r\ncontrasts not altogether favourably with the strong solid types\r\nof old? Are Englishmen becoming less like Romans, and more like\r\ndisputatious Greeks? These and many other considerations of the same\r\nkind are enough to secure a ready welcome for any thinker who can\r\nlight up the obscurities of the time.\r\n\r\nWith profound respect for Sir Henry Maine's attainments, and every\r\ndesire to profit by illumination wherever it may be discerned, we\r\ncannot clearly see how the present volume either makes the problems\r\nmore intelligible, or points the way to feasible solutions. Though\r\nhe tries, in perfect good faith, to be the dispassionate student, he\r\noften comes very close to the polemics of the hour. The truth is\r\nthat scientific lawyers have seldom been very favourable to popular\r\ngovernment; and when the scientific lawyer is doubled with the Indian\r\nbureaucrat, we are pretty sure beforehand that in such a tribunal it\r\nwill go hard with democracy. That the author extremely dislikes and\r\nsuspects the new order, he does not hide either from himself or\r\nus. Intellectual contempt for the idolatries of the forum and the\r\nmarket-place has infected him with a touch of that chagrin which\r\ncame to men like Tacitus from disbelief In the moral government of\r\na degenerate world. Though he strives, like Tacitus, to take up his\r\nparable _nec amore et sine odio_, the disgust is ill concealed. There\r\nare passages where we almost hear the drone of a dowager in the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain. It was said of Tocqueville that he was an\r\naristocrat who accepted his defeat. Sir Henry Maine in politics is a\r\nbureaucrat who cannot bear to think that democracy will win. He is\r\ndangerously near the frame of mind of Scipio Emilianus, after the\r\nmovement of the Gracchi and the opening of the Roman revolution.\r\nScipio came to the conclusion that with whichever party he took sides,\r\nor whatever measures a disinterested and capable statesman might\r\ndevise, he would only aggravate the evil. Sir Henry Maine would seem\r\nto be nearly as despondent. Hence his book is fuller of apprehension\r\nthan of guidance, more plausible in alarm than wise or useful in\r\ndirection. It is exclusively critical and negative. There Is, indeed,\r\nan admirable account of the constitution of the United States. But on\r\nthe one great question on which the constitution of the United States\r\nmight have been expected to shed light--the modification of the House\r\nof Lords--Sir Henry Maine explicitly admits (p. 186) that it is very\r\ndifficult to obtain from the younger institution, the Senate, any\r\nlessons which can be of use in the reconstruction of the older. At\r\nevery turn, the end of the discussion lands us in a philosophical\r\n_cul-de-sac_, and nothing is so depressing as a _cul-de-sac_. The tone\r\nis that of the political valetudinarian, watching with uneasy eye the\r\nways of rude health. Unreflecting optimism about Popular Government is\r\nsickening, but calculated pessimism is not much better.\r\n\r\nSomething, no doubt, may often be gained by the mere cross-examination\r\nof catchwords and the exposure of platitudes. Popular government is\r\nno more free from catchwords and platitudes than any other political,\r\nreligious, or social cause which interests a great many people, and is\r\nthe subject of much discussion. Even the Historical Method has its own\r\nclaptrap. But one must not make too much of these things. \"In order\r\nto love mankind,\" said Helvétius, \"one must not expect too much from\r\nthem.\" And fairly to appreciate institutions you must not hold them up\r\nagainst the light that blazes in Utopia; you must not expect them\r\nto satisfy microscopic analysis, nor judge their working, which is\r\ninevitably rough, awkward, clumsy, and second-best, by the fastidious\r\nstandards of closet logic.\r\n\r\nBefore saying more as to the substance of the hook, we may be allowed\r\nto notice one or two matters of literary or historical interest in\r\nwhich Sir Henry Maine is certainly open to criticism. There is an old\r\nquestion about Burke which was discussed by the present writer a long\r\ntime ago. A great disillusion, says Sir Henry Maine, has always seemed\r\nto him to separate the _Thoughts on the Present Discontents_ and the\r\n_Speech on Taxation_ from the magnificent panegyric on the British\r\nConstitution in 1790. \"Not many persons in the last century could\r\nhave divined from the previous opinions of Edmund Burke the real\r\nsubstructure of his political creed, or did in fact suspect it till\r\nit was uncovered by the early and comparatively slight miscarriage of\r\nFrench revolutionary institutions.\" This is, as a statement of fact,\r\nnot at all correct. Lord Chatham detected what he believed to be the\r\nmischievous Conservatism in Burke's constitutional doctrines at the\r\nvery outset. So did the Constitutional Society detect it. So did Mrs.\r\nMacaulay, Bishop Watson, and many other people. The story of Burke's\r\ninconsistency is, of course, as old as Sheridan. Hazlitt declared\r\nthat the Burke of 1770 and the Burke of 1790 were not merely opposite\r\npersons, but deadly enemies. Mr. Buckle, who is full of veneration for\r\nthe early writings, but who dislikes the later ones, gets over the\r\ndifficulty by insisting that Burke actually went out of his mind after\r\n1789. We should have expected a subtler judgment from Sir Henry Maine.\r\nBurke belonged from first to last to the great historic and positive\r\nschool, of which the founder was Montesquieu. Its whole method,\r\nprinciple, and sentiment, all animated him with equal force whether he\r\nwas defending the secular pomps of Oude or the sanctity of Benares,\r\nthe absolutism of Versailles, or the free and ancient Parliament at\r\nWestminster.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is satisfactory to have the authority of Mr. Lecky on\r\nthe same side. _England in the Eighteenth Century_, vol. iii. chap.\r\nix. p. 209.]\r\n\r\nVersailles reminds us of a singular overstatement by Sir Henry Maine\r\nof the blindness of the privileged classes in France to the approach\r\nof the Revolution. He speaks as if Lord Chesterfield's famous passage\r\nwere the only anticipation of the coming danger. There is at least one\r\nutterance of Louis XV. himself, which shows that he did not expect\r\nthings to last much beyond his time. D'Argenson, in the very year of\r\nChesterfield's prophecy, pronounced that a revolution was inevitable,\r\nand he even went so close to the mark as to hint that it would arise\r\non the first occasion when it should be necessary to convoke the\r\nStates General. Rousseau, in a page of the _Confessions_, not only\r\ndivined a speedy revolution, but enumerated the operative causes of it\r\nwith real precision. There Is a striking prediction In Voltaire, and\r\nanother in Mercier de la Rivière. Other names might be quoted to\r\nthe same effect, including Maria Theresa, who described the ruined\r\ncondition of the French monarchy, and only hoped that the ruin might\r\nnot overtake her daughter. The mischief was not so much that the\r\nprivileged classes were blind as that they were selfish, stubborn,\r\nhelpless, and reckless. The point is not very important in itself,\r\nbut it is characteristic of a very questionable way of reading human\r\nhistory. Sir Henry Maine's readiness to treat revolutions as due to\r\nerroneous abstract ideas naturally inclines him to take too narrow a\r\nview both of the preparation in circumstances, and of the preparation\r\nin the minds of observant onlookers.\r\n\r\nIn passing, by the way, we are curious to know the writer's authority\r\nfor what he calls the odd circumstance that the Jacobins generally\r\nborrowed their phrases from the legendary history of the early Roman\r\nRepublic, while the Girondins preferred to take metaphors from the\r\nliterature of Rousseau (p. 75). There was plenty of nonsense talked\r\nabout Brutus and Scaevola by both parties, and It Is not possible\r\nto draw the line with precision. But the received view Is that the\r\nGirondins were Voltairean, and the Jacobins Rousseauite, while Danton\r\nwas of the school of the Encyclopaedia, and Hébert and Chaumette were\r\ninspired by Holbach.\r\n\r\nThe author seems to us greatly to exaggerate the whole position of\r\nRousseau, and even in a certain sense to mistake the nature of his\r\ninfluence. That Jean-Jacques was a far-reaching and important voice\r\nthe present writer is not at all likely to deny; but no estimate of\r\nhis influence in the world is correct which does not treat him rather\r\nas moralist than publicist. _Emilius_ went deeper into men's minds in\r\nFrance and in Europe at large, and did more to quicken the democratic\r\nspirit, than the _Social Contract_ Apart from this, Sir Henry Maine\r\nplaces Rousseau on an isolated eminence which does not really belong\r\nto him. It did not fall within the limited scope of such an essay as\r\nSir Henry Maine's to trace the leading ideas of the _Social Contract_\r\nto the various sources from which they had come, but his account\r\nof these sources is, even for its scale, inadequate. Portions of\r\nRousseau's ideas, he says truly, may be discovered in the speculations\r\nof older writers; and he mentions Hobbes and the French Economists.\r\nBut the most characteristic of all the elements in Rousseau's\r\nspeculation were drawn from Locke. The theoretic basis of popular\r\ngovernment Is to be found in more or less definite shape in various\r\nauthors from Thomas Aquinas downwards. But it was Locke's philosophic\r\nvindication of the Revolution of 1688, in the famous essay on\r\nCivil Government, that directly taught Rousseau the lesson of the\r\nSovereignty of the People. Such originality as the _Social Contract_\r\npossesses is due to its remarkable union of the influence of the two\r\nantagonistic English Thinkers. The differences between Hobbes and\r\nRousseau were striking enough. Rousseau looked on men as good, Hobbes\r\nlooked on them as bad. The one described the state of nature as a\r\nstate of peace, the other as a state of war. The first believed that\r\nlaws and institutions had depraved man, the second that they had\r\nimproved him. In spite of these differences the influence of Hobbes\r\nwas important, but only important in combination. \"The total result\r\nis,\" as I have said elsewhere, \"a curious fusion between the premises\r\nand the temper of Hobbes, and the conclusions of Locke. This fusion\r\nproduced that popular absolutism of which the _Social Contract_ was\r\nthe theoretical expression, and Jacobin supremacy the practical\r\nmanifestation. Rousseau borrowed from Hobbes the true conception of\r\nsovereignty, and from Locke the true conception of the ultimate seat\r\nand original of authority, and of the two together he made the great\r\nimage of the Sovereign People. Strike the crowned head from that\r\nmonstrous figure which is the frontispiece of the _Leviathan_, and\r\nyou have a frontispiece that will do excellently well for the _Social\r\nContract_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rousseau_, chap. xii.]\r\n\r\nOne more word may be said by the way. The very slightest account of\r\nRousseau is too slight to be tolerable, if it omits to mention Calvin.\r\nRousseau's whole theory of the Legislator, which produced such\r\nstriking results in certain transitory phases of the French\r\nRevolution, grew up in his mind from the constitution which the great\r\nreformer had so predominant a share in framing for the little republic\r\nwhere Rousseau was born.\r\n\r\nThis omission of Locke and Calvin again exemplifies the author's\r\ncharacteristic tendency to look upon political ideas as if speculative\r\nwriters got them out of their own heads, or out of the heads of other\r\npeople, apart from the suggestions of events and the requirements of\r\ncircumstance, Calvin was the builder of a working government, and\r\nLocke was the defender of a practical revolution.\r\n\r\nNor does the error stop at the literary sources of political theories.\r\nA point more or less in an estimate of a writer or a book is of\r\ntrivial importance compared with what strikes us as Sir Henry\r\nMaine's tendency to impute an unreal influence to writers and books\r\naltogether. There is, no doubt, a vulgar and superficial opinion that\r\nmere speculation is so remote from the real interests of men, that it\r\nis a waste of time for practical people to concern themselves about\r\nspeculation. No view could be more foolish, save one; and that one is\r\nthe opposite view, that the real interests of men have no influence\r\non their speculative opinions, and no share either in moulding those\r\nopinions or in causing their adoption. Sir Henry Maine does not push\r\nthings quite so far as this. Still he appears to us to attribute\r\nalmost exclusive influence to political theories, and almost entirely\r\nto omit what we take to be the much more important reaction upon\r\ntheory, both of human nature, and of the experience of human life and\r\noutward affairs. He makes no allowance among innovating agencies for\r\nnative rationalism without a formula. His brilliant success in other\r\napplications of the Historic Method has disposed him to see survivals\r\nwhere other observers will be content with simpler explanations.\r\nThe reader is sometimes tempted to recall Edie Ochiltree's rude\r\ninterruption of Mr. Oldbuck's enthusiasm over the praetorium of the\r\nImmortal Roman camp at Monkbarns. \"Praetorian here, Praetorian there!\r\nI mind the bigging o 't!\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Maine believes that the air is thick with ideas about\r\ndemocracy that were conceived _a priori_, and that sprung from the\r\nteaching of Rousseau. A conviction of the advantages of legislative\r\nchange, for example, he considers to owe its origin much less to\r\nactive and original intelligence, than to \"the remote effect of words\r\nand notions derived from broken-down political theories.\" There are\r\ntwo great fountains of political theory in our country according to\r\nthe author: Rousseau is one, and Bentham is the other. Current\r\nthought and speech Is infested by the floating fragments of these two\r\nsystems--by loose phrases, by vague notions, by superstitions, that\r\nenervate the human intellect and endanger social safety. This is the\r\nconstant refrain of the pages before us. We should have liked better\r\nevidence. We do not believe that it is a Roman praetorium. Men often\r\npick up old phrases for new events, even when they are judging events\r\nafresh with independent minds. When a politician of the day speaks of\r\nnatural rights, he uses a loose traditional expression for a view of\r\nsocial equities which has come to him, not from a book, but from a\r\nsurvey of certain existing social facts. Now the phrase, the literary\r\ndescription, is the least significant part of the matter. When Mr.\r\nMill talks of the influence of Bentham's writings, he is careful to\r\ntell us that he does not mean that they caused the Reform Bill or the\r\nAppropriation Clause. \"The changes which have been made,\" says Mill,\r\n\"and the greater changes which will be made, in our institutions are\r\nnot the work of philosophers, but of the interests and instincts\r\nof large portions of society recently grown into strength\"\r\n_(Dissertations_, i. 332). That is the point. It is the action of\r\nthese interests and instincts which Sir Henry Maine habitually\r\noverlooks. For is the omission a mere speculative imperfection. It has\r\nan important bearing on the whole practical drift of the book. If he\r\nhad made more room for \"the common intellect rough-hewing political\r\ntruths at the suggestion of common wants and common experience,\"\r\nhe would have viewed existing circumstances with a less lively\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to find an apposite illustration of what is meant by\r\nsaying that this talk of the influence of speculation is enormously\r\nexaggerated and misleading. When Arthur Young was in France in the\r\nautumn of 1787, he noticed a remarkable revolution in manners in two\r\nor three important respects. One of them was a new fashion that had\r\njust come in, of spending some weeks in the country: everybody who had\r\na country seat went to live there, and such as had none went to visit\r\nthose who had. This new custom, observed the admirable Young, is one\r\nof the best that they have taken from England, and \"its introduction\r\nwas effected the easier being assisted by the magic of Rousseau's\r\nwritings.\" The other and more generally known change was that women\r\nof the first fashion were no longer ashamed of nursing their own\r\nchildren, and that infants were no longer tightly bound round by\r\nbarbarous stays and swaddling clothes. This wholesome change, too,\r\nwas assisted by Rousseau's eloquent pleas for simplicity and the life\r\nnatural. Of these particular results of his teaching in France a\r\nhundred years ago the evidence is ample, direct, and beyond denial.\r\nBut whenever we find gentlemen with a taste for country life, and\r\nladies with a fancy for nursing their own children, we surely need not\r\ncry out that here is another proof of the extraordinary influence of\r\nthe speculations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. We need not treat it as a\r\nsurvival of a broken-down theory. \"Great Nature is more wise than I,\"\r\nsays the Poet. Great Nature had much more to do with moulding men and\r\nwomen to these things than all the books that have ever been printed.\r\n\r\nWe are entirely sceptical as to the proposition that \"men have at all\r\ntimes quarrelled more fiercely about phrases and formulas than even\r\nabout material interests\" (p. 124). There has been a certain amount of\r\nfighting in the world about mere words, as idle as the faction fights\r\nbetween Caravats and Shanavests, or Two-Year-Olds and Three-Year-Olds\r\nin Ireland. But the more carefully we look into human history, the\r\nmore apparent it becomes that underneath the phrase or the formula\r\nthere is usually a material or a quasi-material, or a political, or\r\na national, or an ecclesiastical interest. Few quarrels now seem so\r\npurely verbal as those which for several centuries raged about the\r\nmysteries of the faith in the Western and the Eastern Churches. Yet\r\nthese quarrels, apparently as frivolous as they were ferocious,\r\nabout the relations of mind and matter, about the composition of\r\nthe Trinity, about the Divine nature, turned much less on futile\r\nmetaphysics than on the solid competition for ecclesiastical power, or\r\nthe conflict of rival nationalities. The most transcendental heresy or\r\northodoxy generally had business at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nIn limiting the parentage of Modern English Liberalism of a Radical or\r\ndemocratic type to Rousseau and Bentham, the author has left out\r\nof sight what is assuredly a much more important factor than any\r\nspeculative, literary, or philosophic matter whatever. \"Englishmen,\"\r\nhe says truly, \"are wont to be content with the rough rule of success\r\nor failure as the test of right or wrong in national undertakings.\"\r\nThe same habit of mind and temper marks the attitude of Englishmen\r\ntowards their national institutions. They look to success and failure,\r\nthey take the measure of things from results, they consult the\r\npractical working of the machine, they will only go to school with\r\nexperience. We cannot find the proof that _a priori_ Radicalism ever\r\nat any time got a real hold of any considerable mass of the people of\r\nthis country, or that any of the great innovations in domestic policy\r\nsince the end of Lord Liverpool's administration have been inspired\r\nor guided by Rousseauite assumptions. Godwin, whose book on Political\r\nJustice was for a long time the great literary fountain of English\r\nRadicalism, owed quite as much to the utilitarian Helvétius as to the\r\nsentimental Rousseau. Nor can either William Cobbett or Joseph Hume be\r\nsaid to have dealt largely in _a priori_. What makes the Radical of\r\nthe street is mostly mother-wit exercising itself upon the facts of\r\nthe time. His weakness is that he does not know enough of the facts of\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Maine himself points to what has had a far more decisive\r\ninfluence on English ways of thinking about politics than his two\r\nphilosophers, put together. \"The American Republic,\" he says (p. 11),\r\n\"has greatly influenced the favour into which popular government grew.\r\nIt disproved the once universal assumptions that no Republic could\r\ngovern a large territory, and that no strictly Republican government\r\ncould be stable.\" Nothing can be more true. When Burke and Chatham\r\nand Fox persistently declared that the victory of England over the\r\ncolonists would prove fatal in the long run to the liberties of\r\nEngland itself, those great men were even wiser than they knew.\r\nThe success of popular government across the Atlantic has been the\r\nstrongest incentive to the extension of popular government here.\r\nWe need go no further back than the Reform Bill of 1867 to remind\r\nourselves that the victory of the North over the South, and the\r\nextraordinary clemency and good sense with which that victory\r\nwas used, had more to do with the concession of the franchise to\r\nhouseholders in boroughs than all the eloquence of Mr. Gladstone and\r\nall the diplomacies of Mr. Disraeli.\r\n\r\nTo the influence of the American Union must be added that of the\r\nBritish colonies. The success of popular self-government in these\r\nthriving communities is reacting on political opinion at home with a\r\nforce that no statesman neglects, and that is every day increasing.\r\nThere is even a danger that the influence may go too far. They are\r\nsolving some of our problems, but not under our conditions, and not\r\nin presence of the same difficulties. Still the effect of colonial\r\nprosperity--a prosperity alike of admirable achievement and boundless\r\npromise--is irresistible. It imparts a freedom, an elasticity, an\r\nexpansiveness, to English political notions, and gives our people a\r\nconfidence in free institutions and popular government, which\r\nthey would never have drawn from the most eloquent assumptions of\r\nspeculative system-mongers, nor from any other source whatever, save\r\npractical experience carefully observed and rationally interpreted.\r\nThis native and independent rationality in men is what the jealous\r\nvotary of the historic method places far too low.\r\n\r\nIn coming closer to the main current of the book, our first\r\ndisappointment is that Sir Henry Maine has not been very careful to\r\ndo full justice to the views that he criticises. He is not altogether\r\nabove lending himself to the hearsay of the partisan. He allows\r\nexpressions to slip from him which show that he has not been anxious\r\nto face the problems of popular government as popular government is\r\nunderstood by those who have best right to speak for it. \"The more\r\nthe difficulties of multitudinous government are probed,\" he says (p.\r\n180), \"the stronger grows the doubt of the infallibility of popularly\r\nelected legislatures.\" We do not profess to answer for all that may\r\nhave been said by Mr. Bancroft, or Walt Whitman, or all the orators of\r\nall the Fourths of July since American Independence. But we are not\r\nacquainted with any English writer or politician of the very slightest\r\nconsideration or responsibility who has committed himself to the\r\nastounding proposition, that popularly elected legislatures are\r\ninfallible. Who has ever advanced such a doctrine? Further, \"It\r\nrequires some attention to facts to see how widely spread is the\r\nmisgiving as to the absolute wisdom of popularly elected chambers.\" We\r\nare not surprised at the misgiving. But after reasonable attention to\r\nfacts, we cannot recall any publicist, whom it could be worth while\r\nto spend five minutes in refuting, who has ever said that popularly\r\nelected chambers are absolutely wise. Again, we should like the\r\nevidence for the statement that popularly elected Houses \"do not\r\nnowadays appeal to the wise deduction from experience, as old as\r\nAristotle, which no student of constitutional history will deny, that\r\nthe best constitutions are those in which there is a large popular\r\nelement. It is a singular proof of the widespread influence of the\r\nspeculations of Rousseau that although very few First Chambers really\r\nrepresent the entire community, nevertheless in Europe they almost\r\ninvariably claim to reflect it, and as a consequence they assume an\r\nair of divinity, which if it rightfully belonged to them would be\r\nfatal to all argument for a Second Chamber.\" That would be very\r\nimportant If it were true. But is it true that First Chambers assume\r\nan air of divinity? Or is such an expression a \"burlesque of the real\r\nargument?\" A reasonable familiarity with the course of the controversy\r\nin France, where the discussion has been abundant, and in England,\r\nwhere it has been comparatively meagre, leaves me, for one, entirely\r\nignorant that this claim for divinity, or anything like it, is ever\r\nheard in the debate. The most powerful modern champion of popular\r\ngovernment was Gambetta. Did Gambetta consider First Chambers divine?\r\nOn the contrary, some of the most strenuous pleas for the necessity of\r\na Second Chamber are to be found precisely in the speeches of Gambetta\r\n(_e.g._ his speech at Grenoble, in the autumn of 1878, _Discours_\r\nviii. 270, etc.). Abstract thinking is thinking withdrawn from the\r\nconcrete and particular facts. But the abstract thinker should not\r\nwithdraw too far.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Maine speaks (p. 185) of \"the saner political theorist, who\r\nholds that in secular matters it is better to walk by sight than by\r\nfaith.\" He allows that a theorist of this kind, as regards popularly\r\nelected chambers, \"will be satisfied that experience has shown the\r\nbest Constitutions to be those in which the popular element is large,\r\nand he will readily admit that, as the structure of each society of\r\nmen slowly alters, it is well to alter and amend the organisation by\r\nwhich this element makes itself felt.\" Sir Henry Maine would surely\r\nhave done better service in this grave and difficult discussion, if he\r\nhad dealt with views which he mistrusts, as they are really held and\r\nexpressed by sane theorists, and not by insane theorists out of sight.\r\nIn France, a hundred years ago, from causes that are capable of\r\nexplanation, the democracy of sentiment swept away the democracy of\r\nutility. In spite of casual phrases in public discussion, and in spite\r\nof the incendiary trash of Red journalists without influence, it is\r\nthe democracy of reason, experience, and utility that is now in the\r\nascendant, both in France and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of what we must call parody is shown in such a\r\nstatement as that (p. 78) \"an audience composed of roughs or clowns is\r\nboldly told by an educated man that it has more political information\r\nthan an equal number of scholars.\" By \"roughs\" Sir Henry Maine\r\nexplains that he means the artisans of the towns. The designation is\r\nhardly felicitous. It is not even fashionable; for the roughs and\r\nclowns are now by common consent of Tories and Liberals alike\r\ntransformed into capable citizens. Such a phrase gives us a painful\r\nglimpse of the accurate knowledge of their countrymen that is\r\npossessed by eminent men who write about them from the dim and distant\r\nseclusion of college libraries and official bureaux. If Sir Henry\r\nMaine could spare a few evenings from dispassionate meditations on\r\npopular government in the abstract, to the inspection of the governing\r\npeople in the concrete, he would be the first to see that to dispatch\r\nan audience of skilled artisans as an assembly of roughs is as\r\nunscientific, to use the mildest word, as the habit in a certain\r\nreligious world of lumping all the unconverted races of the earth\r\nin every clime and age in the summary phrase, the heathen. A great\r\nmeeting of artisans listening to Mr. Arthur Balfour or Sir Henry\r\nRoscoe at Manchester, to Sir Lyon Playfair at Leeds (the modern\r\ndemocrat, at any rate, does not think the Republic has no need of\r\nchemists), or to anybody else in a great industrial centre anywhere\r\nelse, is no more an assemblage of roughs than Convocation or the\r\nHouse of Lords. Decidedly, an enemy of the unverified assumptions of\r\ndemocracy ought to be on his guard against the unverified assumptions\r\nof pedantocracy.\r\n\r\nAs for the particular bit of sycophancy which educated men wickedly\r\ndangle before roughs and clowns, we should like to be sure that the\r\nproposition is correctly reported. If the educated man tells his\r\nroughs (if that be the right name for the most skilful, industrious,\r\nand effective handicraftsmen in the world) that they have as much\r\nof the information necessary for shaping a sound judgment on the\r\npolitical issues submitted to them, as an equal number of average\r\nMasters of Arts and Doctors of Laws, then we should say that the\r\neducated man, unless he has been very unlucky with his audience, is\r\nperfectly right. He proves that his education has not confined itself\r\nto books, bureaux, and an exclusive society, but has been carried on\r\nin the bracing air of common life. I will not add anything of my\r\nown on this point, because any candidate or member of Parliament\r\nis suspect, but I will venture to transcribe a page or so from Mr.\r\nFrederic Harrison. Mr. Harrison's intellectual equipment is not\r\ninferior to that of Sir Henry Maine himself; and he has long had close\r\nand responsible contact with the class of men of whom he is speaking,\r\nwhich cannot be quite a disqualification after all.\r\n\r\n    \"No worse nonsense is talked than what we are told as to the\r\n    requisites for the elective franchise. To listen to some people,\r\n    it is almost as solemn a function as to be a trustee of the\r\n    British Museum. What you want in a body of electors is a rough,\r\n    shrewd eye for men of character, honesty, and purpose. Very plain\r\n    men know who wish them well, and the sort of thing which will\r\n    bring them good. Electors have not got to govern the country; they\r\n    have only to find a set of men who will see that the Government is\r\n    just and active.... All things go best by comparison, and a body\r\n    of men may be as good voters as their neighbours without basing\r\n    the type of the Christian hero.\r\n\r\n    \"So far from, being the least fit for political influence of all\r\n    classes in the community, the best part of the working class forms\r\n    the most fit of all others. If any section of the people is to\r\n    be the paramount arbiter in public affairs, the only section\r\n    competent for this duty is the superior order of workmen.\r\n    Governing is one thing; but electors of any class cannot or ought\r\n    not to govern. Electing, or the giving an indirect approval\r\n    of Government, is another thing, and demands wholly different\r\n    qualities. These are moral, not intellectual; practical, not\r\n    special gifts--gifts of a very plain and almost universal order.\r\n    Such are, firstly, social sympathies and sense of justice; then\r\n    openness and plainness of character; lastly, habits of action, and\r\n    a practical knowledge of social misery. These are the qualities\r\n    which fit men to be the arbiters or ultimate source (though\r\n    certainly not the instruments) of political power. These qualities\r\n    the best working men possess in a far higher degree than any other\r\n    portion of the community; indeed, they are almost the only part of\r\n    the community which possesses them in any perceptible degree.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Order and Progress_, pp. 149-54, and again at p. 174.]\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is that, if Sir Henry Maine is right, we have no more\r\nto hope from other classes than from roughs and clowns. He can discern\r\nno blue sky in any quarter. \"In politics,\" he says, \"the most\r\npowerful of all causes is the timidity, the listlessness, and the\r\nsuperficiality of the generality of minds\" (p. 73). This is carrying\r\ncriticism of democracy into an indictment against human nature. What\r\nis to become of us, thus placed between the devil of mob ignorance\r\nand corruption, and the deep sea of genteel listlessness and\r\nsuperficiality? After all, Sir Henry Maine is only repeating in more\r\nsober tones the querulous remonstrances with which we are so familiar\r\non the lips of Ultramontanes and Legitimists. A less timid observer of\r\ncontemporary events, certainly in the land that all of us know best\r\nand love best, would judge that, when it comes to a pinch, Liberals\r\nare still passably prudent, and Conservatives quite sufficiently\r\nwide-awake.\r\n\r\nAnother of the passages in Sir Henry Maine's book, that savours rather\r\nof the party caricaturist than of the \"dispassionate student of\r\npolitics,\" is the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is some resemblance between the period of political reform\r\n    in the nineteenth century and the period of religious reformation\r\n    in the sixteenth. Now as then the multitude of followers must be\r\n    distinguished from the smaller group of leaders. Now as then\r\n    there are a certain number of zealots who desire that truth shall\r\n    prevail.... But behind these, now as then, there is a crowd which\r\n    has imbibed a delight in change for its own sake, who would reform\r\n    the Suffrage, or the House of Lords, or the Land Laws, or the\r\n    Union with Ireland, in precisely the same spirit in which the mob\r\n    behind the reformers of religion broke the nose of a saint in\r\n    stone, made a bonfire of copes and surplices, or shouted for the\r\n    government of the Church by presbyteries\" (p. 130).\r\n\r\nWe should wish to look at this remarkable picture a little more\r\nclosely. That there exist Anabaptists in the varied hosts of the\r\nEnglish reformers is true. The feats of the Social Democrats, however,\r\nat the recent election hardly convince us that they have very\r\nformidable multitudes behind them. Nor is it they who concern\r\nthemselves with such innovations as those which Sir Henry Maine\r\nspecifies. The Social Democrats, even of the least red shade, go a\r\nlong way beyond and below such trifles as Suffrage or the Upper House.\r\nTo say of the crowd who do concern themselves with reform of the\r\nSuffrage, or the Land Laws, or the House of Lords, or the Union with\r\nIreland, that they are animated by a delight in change for its own\r\nsake, apart from the respectable desire to apply a practical remedy to\r\na practical inconvenience, is to show a rather highflying disregard\r\nof easily ascertainable facts. The Crowd listen with interest to talk\r\nabout altering the Land Laws, because they suspect the English land\r\nsystem to have something to do with the unprosperous condition of the\r\nlandlord, the farmer, and the labourer; with the depopulation of the\r\ncountry and the congestion in the towns; with the bad housing of the\r\npoor, and with various other evils which they suppose themselves to\r\nsee staring them daily in the face. They may be entirely mistaken\r\nalike In their estimate of mischief and their hope of mitigation. But\r\nthey are not moved by delight in change for its own sake. When the\r\nCrowd sympathises with disapproval of the House of Lords, it is\r\nbecause the legislative performances of that body are believed to have\r\nimpeded useful reforms in the past, to be impeding them now, and to be\r\nlikely to impede them in the future. This may be a sad misreading\r\nof the history of the last fifty years, and a painfully prejudiced\r\nanticipation of the next fifty. At any rate, it is in intention a\r\nsolid and practical appeal to experience and results, and has no\r\naffinity to a restless love of change for the sake of change. No\r\ndoubt, in the progress of the controversy, the assailants of the House\r\nof Lords attack the principle of birth. But the principle of birth is\r\nnot attacked from the _a priori_ point of view. The whole force of\r\nthe attack lies in what is taken to be the attested fact that the\r\nprinciple of a hereditary chamber supervising an elective chamber has\r\nworked, is working, and will go on working, inconveniently, stupidly,\r\nand dangerously. Finally, there is the question of the Irish Union. Is\r\nit the English or Scottish Crowd that is charged with a wanton desire\r\nto recast the Union? Nobody knows much about the matter who is not\r\nperfectly aware that the English statesman, whoever he may be, who\r\nundertakes the inevitable task of dealing with the demand for Home\r\nRule, will have to make his case very plain indeed in order to make\r\nthe cause popular here. Then is it the Irish Crowd? Sir Henry Maine,\r\nof all men, is not likely to believe that a sentiment which the wisest\r\npeople of all parties in Ireland for a hundred years have known to lie\r\nin the depths of the mind of the great bulk of the Irish population,\r\nto whom we have now for the first time given the chance of declaring\r\ntheir wishes, is no more than a gratuitous and superficial passion for\r\nchange for its own sake. The sentiment of Irish nationality may or may\r\nnot be able to justify itself in the eye of prudential reason, and\r\nEnglish statesmen may or may not have been wise in inviting it to\r\nexplode. Those are different questions. But Sir Henry Maine himself\r\nadmits in another connection (p. 83) that \"vague and shadowy as are\r\nthe recommendations of what is called a Nationality, a State founded\r\non this principle has generally one real practical advantage, through\r\nits obliteration of small tyrannies and local oppressions.\" It is not\r\nto be denied that it is exactly the expectation of this very practical\r\nadvantage that has given its new vitality to the Irish National\r\nmovement which seems now once more, for good or for evil, to have\r\ncome to a head. When it is looked into, then, the case against the\r\nmultitudes who are as senselessly eager to change institutions as\r\nother multitudes once were to break off the noses of saints in stone,\r\nfalls to pieces at every point.\r\n\r\nAmong other vices ascribed to democracy, we are told that it is\r\nagainst science, and that \"even in our day vaccination is in the\r\nutmost danger\" (p. 98). The instance is for various reasons not a\r\nhappy one. It is not even precisely stated. I have never understood\r\nthat vaccination is in much danger. Compulsory vaccination is perhaps\r\nin danger. But compulsion, as a matter of fact, was strengthened as\r\nthe franchise went lower. It is a comparative novelty in English\r\nlegislation (1853), and as a piece of effectively enforced\r\nadministration it is more novel still (1871). I admit, however, that\r\nit is not endured in the United States; and only two or three years\r\nago it was rejected by an overwhelming majority on an appeal to the\r\npopular vote in the Swiss Confederation. Obligatory vaccination may\r\ntherefore one day disappear from our statute book, if democracy has\r\nanything to do with it. But then the obligation to practise a medical\r\nrite may be inexpedient, in spite of the virtues of the rite itself.\r\nThat is not all. Sir Henry Maine will admit that Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nis not against science, and he expresses in the present volume his\r\nadmiration for Mr. Spencer's work on _Man and the State_. Mr. Spencer\r\nis the resolute opponent of compulsory vaccination, and a resolute\r\ndenier, moreover, of the pretension that the evidence for the\r\nadvantages of vaccination takes such account of the ulterior effects\r\nin the system as to amount to a scientific demonstration. Therefore,\r\nif science demands compulsory vaccination, democracy in rejecting the\r\ndemand, and even if it went further, is at least kept in countenance\r\nby some of those who are of the very household of science. The\r\nillustration is hardly impressive enough for the proposition that it\r\nsupports.\r\n\r\nAnother and a far more momentous illustration occurs on another page\r\n(37). A very little consideration is enough to show that it will by\r\nno means bear Sir Henry Maine's construction. \"There is, in fact,\" he\r\nsays, \"just enough evidence to show that even now there is a marked\r\nantagonism between democratic opinion and scientific truth as applied\r\nto human societies. The central seat in all Political Economy was from\r\nthe first occupied by the theory of Population. This theory ... has\r\nbecome the central truth of biological science. Yet it is evidently\r\ndisliked by the multitude and those whom the multitude permits to lead\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Maine goes on to say that it has long been intensely\r\nunpopular in France, and this, I confess, is a surprise to me. It has\r\nusually been supposed that a prudential limitation of families is\r\nrooted in the minds and habits of nearly, though not quite, all\r\nclasses of the French nation. An excellent work on France, written by\r\na sound English observer seven or eight years ago, chances to be lying\r\nbefore me at the moment, and here is a passage taken almost at random.\r\n\"The opinions of thoughtful men seem to tend towards the wish to\r\nintroduce into France some of that improvidence which allows English\r\npeople to bring large families into the world without first securing\r\nthe means of keeping them, and which has peopled the continent of\r\nNorth America and the Australian colonies with an English-speaking\r\nrace\" (Richardson's _Corn and Cattle Producing Districts of France_,\r\np. 47, etc.). Surely this is a well-established fact. It is possible\r\nthat denunciations of Malthus may occasionally be found both in\r\nClerical and Socialistic prints, but then there are reasons for that.\r\nIt can hardly be made much of a charge against French democracy that\r\nit tolerates unscientific opinion, so long as it cultivates scientific\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAs for our own country, and those whom the multitude permits to lead\r\nit, we cannot forget that by far the most popular and powerful man _in\r\nfaece Romuli_--as Sir Henry Maine insists on our putting it in that\r\npolite way--was tried and condemned not many years ago for publishing\r\na certain pamphlet which made a limitation of population the very\r\nstarting-point of social reform. It is not necessary to pronounce an\r\nopinion on the particular counsels of the pamphlet, but the motives\r\nwhich prompted its circulation (motives admitted to be respectable by\r\nthe Chief-Justice who tried the case), and the extraordinary reception\r\nof the pamphlet by the serious portion of the workmen of the towns,\r\nwould make a careful writer think twice before feeling sure that\r\npopular bodies will never listen to the truth about population. No\r\ndoubt, as Sir Henry Maine says in the same place, certain classes now\r\nresist schemes for relieving distress by emigration. But there is a\r\npretty obvious reason for that. That reason is not mere aversion\r\nto face the common sense of the relations between population and\r\nsubsistence, but a growing suspicion--as to the reasonableness of\r\nwhich, again, I give no opinion--that emigration is made into an easy\r\nand slovenly substitute for a scientific reform in our system of\r\nholding and using land. In the case of Ireland, other political\r\nconsiderations must be added.\r\n\r\nDemocracy will be against science, we admit, in one contingency: if\r\nit loses the battle with the Ultramontane Church. The worst enemy\r\nof science is also the bitterest enemy of democracy, _c'est le\r\ncléricalisme_. The interests of science and the interests of democracy\r\nare one. Let us take a case. Suppose that popular Government in France\r\nwere to succumb, a military or any other more popular Government would\r\nbe forced to lean on Ultramontanes. Ultramontanes would gather the\r\nspoils of democratic defeat. Sir Henry Maine is much too well informed\r\nto think that a clerical triumph would be good for science, whatever\r\nelse it might be good for. Then are not propositions about democracy\r\nbeing against science very idle and a little untrue? \"Modern\r\npolitics,\" said a wise man (Pattison, _Sermons_, p. 191) \"resolve\r\nthemselves into the struggle between knowledge and tradition.\"\r\nDemocracy is hardly on the side of tradition.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt on these secondary matters, because they show that\r\nthe author hardly brings to the study of modern democracy the ripe\r\npreparation of detail which he gave to ancient law. In the larger\r\nfield of his speculation, the value of his thought is seriously\r\nimpaired by the absence of anything like a philosophy of society as a\r\nwhole. Nobody who has studied Burke, or Comte, or Mill--I am not sure\r\nwhether we should not add even De Maistre--can imagine any of them as\r\nsetting to work on a general political speculation without reference\r\nto particular social conditions. They would have conducted the inquiry\r\nin strict relation to the stage at which a community happened to be,\r\nin matters lying outside of the direct scope of political government.\r\nSo, before all other living thinkers, should we have expected Sir\r\nHenry Maine to do. It is obvious that systems of government, called\r\nby the same name, bearing the same superficial marks, founded and\r\nmaintained on the same nominal principles, framed in the same verbal\r\nforms, may yet work with infinite diversity of operation, according\r\nto the variety of social circumstances around them. Yet it is here\r\ninferred that democracy in England must be fragile, difficult, and\r\nsundry other evil things, because out of fourteen Presidents of the\r\nBolivian Republic thirteen have died assassinated or in exile. If\r\nEngland and Bolivia were at all akin in history, religion, race,\r\nindustry, the fate of Bolivian Presidents would be more instructive to\r\nEnglish Premiers.\r\n\r\nOne of the propositions which Sir Henry Maine is most anxious to bring\r\nhome to his readers is that Democracy, in the extreme form to which\r\nit tends, is of all kinds of government by far the most difficult.\r\nHe even goes so far as to say (p. 87) that, while not denying to\r\nDemocracies some portion of the advantage which Bentham claimed for\r\nthem, and \"putting this advantage at the highest, it is _more than\r\ncompensated_ by one great disadvantage,\" namely, its difficulty. This\r\ngeneralisation is repeated with an emphasis that surprises us, for two\r\nreasons. In the first place, if the proposition could be proved to be\r\ntrue, we fail to see that it would be particularly effective in its\r\npractical bearings. Everybody whose opinions are worth consideration,\r\nand everybody who has ever come near the machinery of democratic\r\ngovernment, is only too well aware that whether it be far the most\r\ndifficult form of government or not, it is certainly difficult enough\r\nto tax the powers of statesmanship to the very uttermost. Is not that\r\nenough? Is anything gained by pressing us further than that? \"Better\r\nbe a poor fisherman,\" said Danton as he walked in the last hours of\r\nhis life on the banks of the Aube, \"better be a poor fisherman, than\r\nmeddle with the governing of men.\" We wonder whether there has been\r\na single democratic leader either in France or England who has not\r\nincessantly felt the full force of Danton's ejaculation. There may,\r\nindeed, be simpletons in the political world who dream that if only\r\nthe system of government were made still more popular, all would be\r\nplain sailing. But then Sir Henry Maine is not the man to write for\r\nsimpletons.\r\n\r\nThe first reason, then, for surprise at the immense stress laid by the\r\nauthor on the proposition about the difficulty of popular government\r\nis that it would not be of the first order of importance if it were\r\ntrue. Our second reason is that it cannot be shown to be true.\r\nYou cannot measure the relative difficulty of diverse systems of\r\ngovernment. Governments are things of far too great complexity for\r\nprecise quantification of this sort. Will anybody, for example, read\r\nthrough the second volume of the excellent work of M. Leroy-Beaulieu\r\non the Empire of the Czars (1882), and then be prepared to maintain\r\nthat democracy is more difficult than autocracy? It would be\r\ninteresting, too, to know whether the Prince on whose shoulders\r\nwill one day be laid the burden of the German Empire will read the\r\ndissertation on the unparalleled difficulties of democracy with\r\nacquiescence. There are many questions, of which the terms are no\r\nsooner stated than we at once see that a certain and definite answer\r\nto them is impossible. The controversy as to the relative fragility,\r\nor the relative difficulty, of popular government and other forms of\r\ngovernment, appears to be a controversy of this kind. We cannot decide\r\nit until we have weighed, measured, sifted, and tested a great mass of\r\nheterogeneous facts; and then, supposing the process to have been\r\never so skilfully and laboriously performed, no proposition could be\r\nestablished as the outcome, that would be an adequate reward for the\r\npains of the operation.\r\n\r\nThis, we venture to think, must be pronounced a grave drawback to the\r\nvalue of the author's present speculation. He attaches an altogether\r\nexcessive and unscientific importance to form. It would be\r\nunreasonable to deny to a writer on democracy as a form of government\r\nthe right of isolating his phenomenon. But it is much more\r\nunreasonable to predicate fragility, difficulty, or anything else of a\r\nparticular form of government, without reference to other conditions\r\nwhich happen to go along with it in a given society at a given time.\r\nNone of the properties of popular government are independent of\r\nsurrounding circumstances, social, economic, religious, and historic.\r\nAll the conditions are bound up together in a closely interdependent\r\nconnection, and are not secondary to, or derivative from, the mere\r\nform of government. It is, if not impossible, at least highly unsafe\r\nto draw inferences about forms of government in universals.\r\n\r\nNo writer seems to us to approach Machiavelli in the acuteness with\r\nwhich he pushes behind mere political names, and passes on to the real\r\ndifferences that may exist in movements and institutions that are\r\ncovered by the same designation. Nothing in its own way can be more\r\nadmirable, for instance, than his reflections on the differences\r\nbetween democracy at Florence and democracy in old Rome--how the first\r\nbegan in great inequality of conditions, and ended in great equality,\r\nwhile the process was reversed in the second; how at Rome the people\r\nand the nobles shared power and office, while at Florence the victors\r\ncrushed and ruined their adversaries; how at Rome the people, by\r\ncommon service with the nobles, acquired some of their virtues, while\r\nat Florence the nobles were forced down to seem, as well as to be,\r\nlike the common people (_Istorie Fiorentine_, bk. iii).\r\n\r\nThis is only an example of the distinctions and qualifications which\r\nit is necessary to introduce before we can prudently affirm or deny\r\nanything about political institutions in general terms. Who would\r\ndeny that both the stability and the degree of difficulty of popular\r\ngovernment are closely connected in the United States with the\r\nabundance of accessible land? Who would deny that in Great Britain\r\nthey are closely connected with the greater or less prosperity of our\r\ncommerce and manufactures? To take another kind of illustration\r\nfrom Mr. Dicey's brilliant and instructive volume on the Law of the\r\nConstitution. The governments of England and of France are both of\r\nthem popular in form; but does not a fundamental difference in their\r\nwhole spirit and working result from the existence in one country of\r\nthe _droit administratif_, and the absolute predominance in the other\r\nof regular law, applied by the ordinary courts, and extending equally\r\nover all classes of citizens? Distinctions and differences of this\r\norder go for nothing in the pages before us; yet they are vital to the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe same fallacious limitation, the same exclusion of the many various\r\ncauses that cooperate in the production of political results, is to be\r\ndiscerned in nearly every argument. The author justly calls attention\r\nto the extraordinary good luck which has befallen us as a nation. He\r\nproceeds to warn us that if the desire for legislative innovation be\r\nallowed to grow upon us at its present pace--pace assumed to be very\r\nheadlong indeed--the chances are that our luck will not last. We shall\r\nhave a disaster like Sedan, or the loss of Alsace Lorraine (p. 151).\r\nThis is a curiously narrow reading of contemporary history. Did\r\nAustria lose Sadowa, or was the French Empire ruined at Sedan,\r\nin consequence of the passion of either of those Governments for\r\nlegislative innovations; or must we not rather, in order to\r\nexplain these striking events, look to a large array of military,\r\ngeographical, financial, diplomatic, and dynastic considerations and\r\nconditions? If so, what becomes of the moral? England is, no doubt,\r\nthe one great civilised power that has escaped an organic or\r\nstructural change within the last five-and-twenty years. Within that\r\nperiod, the American Union, after a tremendous war, has revolutionised\r\nthe social institutions of the South, and reconstructed the\r\nconstitution. The French Empire has foundered, and a French Republic\r\nonce more bears the fortunes of a great State over troubled waters.\r\nGermany has undergone a complete transformation; so has the Italian\r\npeninsula. The internal and the external relations alike of the\r\nAustrian Power are utterly different to-day from what they were twenty\r\nyears ago. Spain has passed from monarchy to republic, and back to\r\nmonarchy again, and gone from dynasty to dynasty. But what share had\r\nlegislative innovation in producing these great changes? No share at\r\nall in any one case. What is the logic, then, of the warning that if\r\nwe persist in our taste for legislative innovation, we shall lose\r\nour immunity from the violent changes that have overtaken other\r\nStates--changes with which legislative innovation had nothing to do?\r\n\r\nIn short, modern societies, whether autocratic or democratic, are\r\npassing through a great transformation, social, religious, and\r\npolitical. The process is full of embarrassments, difficulties, and\r\nperils. These are the dominant marks of our era. To set them all down\r\nto popular government is as narrow, as confused, and as unintelligent\r\nas the imputation in a papal Encyclical of all modern ills to\r\nLiberalism. You cannot isolate government, and judge it apart from the\r\nother and deeper forces of the time. Western civilisation is slowly\r\nentering on a new stage. Form of government is the smallest part of\r\nit. It has been well said that those nations have the best chance of\r\nescaping a catastrophe in the obscure and uncertain march before us,\r\nwho find a way of opening the most liberal career to the aspirations\r\nof the present, without too rudely breaking with all the traditions of\r\nthe past. This is what popular government, wisely guided, is best able\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nBut will wise guidance be endured? Sir Henry Maine seems to think that\r\nit will not. Mill thought that it would. In a singularly luminous\r\npassage in an essay which for some reason or another he never\r\nrepublished, Mill says--\r\n\r\n    \"We are the last persons to undervalue the power of moral\r\n    convictions. But the convictions of the mass of mankind run hand\r\n    in hand with their interests or their class feelings. _We have a\r\n    strong faith, stronger than either politicians or philosophers\r\n    generally have, in the influence of reason and virtue over men's\r\n    minds_; but it is in that of the reason and virtue of their own\r\n    side of the question. We expect few conversions by the mere force\r\n    of reason from one creed to the other. Men's intellects and hearts\r\n    have a large share in determining what _sort_ of Conservatives or\r\n    Liberals they will be; but it is their position (saving individual\r\n    exceptions) which makes them Conservatives or Liberals.\"\r\n\r\nThis double truth points to the good grounds that exist why we should\r\nthink hopefully of popular government, and why we should be slow to\r\nbelieve that it has no better foundation to build upon than the unreal\r\nassumptions of some bad philosophers, French or others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW WORDS ON FRENCH MODELS.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: March 1888.]\r\n\r\n                   Nunquamne reponam,\r\n  Vexatus toties rauci Theseide Codri?\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians are only too fond of insisting on the effect of the French\r\nRevolution in checking English reform. One of the latest of them\r\ndwells on the fatal influence of this great event in our own country,\r\nin checking, blighting, and distorting the natural progress of things.\r\nBut for that influence, he says, the closing years of the century\r\nwould probably have seen the abolition of the English Slave Trade, the\r\nreform of Parliament, and the repeal of the Test Act.[1] The question\r\nof the precise degree of vitality in sectarian pride, and of tenacity\r\nin a great material interest, a hundred years ago or at any time, is\r\nnot very easy to settle. It is quite possible that the Slave Trade\r\nand the Test Act might have died nearly as hard, if there had been\r\nno French Revolution. In any case, it is a curious implication that\r\nunderlies all writing in this familiar vein, that France ought to\r\nhave gone on with a bad government, in order to secure to England the\r\nadvantages of a good one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lecky, vi. 297.]\r\n\r\nAs to one disservice, however, there can be no doubt. The French\r\nRevolution has furnished the enemies of each successive proposal of\r\nreform with a boundless supply of prejudicial analogies, appalling\r\nparallels, and ugly nicknames, which are all just as conclusive with\r\nthe unwise as if they were the aptest arguments. Sydney Smith might\r\nwell put \"the awful example of a neighbouring nation\" among the\r\nstanding topics of the Noodle's Oration. The abolition of rotten\r\nboroughs brought down a thousand ominous references to noyades,\r\nfusillades, and guillotines. When Sir Robert Peel took the duty off\r\ncorn, Croker warned him with great solemnity that he was breaking up\r\nthe old interests, dividing the great families, and beginning exactly\r\nsuch a castastrophe as did the Noailles and the Montmorencis in 1789.\r\nCobden and Bright were promiscuously likened to Baboeuf, Chaumette,\r\nand Anacharsis Clootz. Baboeuf, it is true, was for dividing up all\r\nproperty, and Chaumette was an aggressive atheist; but these were\r\nmere _nuances_, not material to the purposes of obloquy. Robespierre,\r\nDanton, Marat have been mercilessly trotted forth in their sanguinary\r\nshrouds, and treated as the counterparts and precursors of worthies so\r\nobviously and exactly like them as Mr. Beales and Mr. Odger; while\r\nan innocent caucus for the registration of voters recalls to some\r\nwell-known writers lurid visions of the Cordeliers and the Jacobin\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nA recent addition has been made to the stock of nicknames drawn from\r\nthe terrible melodrama of the last century. The Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer at Dublin described the present very humble writer as \"the\r\nSaint-Just of our Revolution.\" The description was received with\r\nlively applause. It would be indelicate to wonder how many in a\r\nhundred, even in that audience of the elect, had ever heard of\r\nSaint-Just, how many in five hundred could have spelt his name, and\r\nhow many in a thousand could have told any three facts in his career.\r\nBut let us muse for a moment upon the portrait. I take down the first\r\npicture of Saint-Just that comes to my hand, M. Taine is the artist:--\r\n\r\n    \"Among these energetic nullities we see gradually rising _a young\r\n    monster_--with face handsome and tranquil--Saint-Just! A sort of\r\n    precocious Sulla, who at five-and-twenty suddenly springs from\r\n    the ranks, and _by force of atrocity wins his place!_ Six years\r\n    before, he began life by an act of domestic robbery: while on a\r\n    visit at his mother's, he ran away in the night with her plate and\r\n    jewels; for that he was locked up for six months. On his release,\r\n    he employed his leisure in the composition of an odious poem. Then\r\n    he flung himself head foremost into the revolution. Blood calcined\r\n    by study, a colossal pride, a conscience completely unhinged,\r\n    an imagination haunted by the bloody recollections of Rome and\r\n    Sparta, an intelligence falsified and twisted until it found\r\n    itself most at its ease in the practice of enormous paradox,\r\n    barefaced sophism, and murderous lying--all these perilous\r\n    ingredients, mixed in a furnace of concentrated ambition, boiled\r\n    and fermented long and silently in his breast.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, hard to know ourselves. One may entertain demons\r\nunawares, and have calcined blood without being a bit the wiser.\r\nStill, I do not find the likeness striking. It would have done just as\r\nwell to call me Nero, Torquemada, Iago, or Bluebeard.\r\n\r\nWhether the present writer does or does not deserve all the\r\ncompliments that history has paid to Saint-Just, is a very slight\r\nand trivial question, with which the public will naturally not much\r\nconcern itself. But as some use is from time to time made of the\r\nwriter's imputed delinquencies to prejudice an important cause, it is\r\nperhaps worth while to try in a page or two to give a better account\r\nof things. It is true that he has written on revolutionists like\r\nRobespierre, and destructive thinkers like Rousseau and Voltaire. It\r\nis true that he believes the two latter to have been on the whole,\r\nwhen all deductions are made, on the side of human progress. But what\r\nsort of foundation in this for the inference that he \"finds his models\r\nin the heroes of the French Revolution,\" and \"looks for his methods\r\nin the Reign of Terror\"? It would be equally logical to infer that\r\nbecause I have written, not without sympathy and appreciation, of\r\nJoseph de Maistre, I therefore find my model in a hero of the Catholic\r\nReaction, and look for my methods in the revived supremacy of the Holy\r\nSee over all secular and temporal authorities. It would be just\r\nas fair to say that because I pointed out, as it was the critic's\r\nbusiness to do, the many admirable merits, and the important moral\r\ninfluences on the society of that time, of the _New Heloïsa_,\r\ntherefore I am bound to think Saint Preux a very fine fellow,\r\nparticularly fit to be a model and a hero for young Ireland. Only on\r\nthe principle that who drives fat oxen must himself be fat, can it be\r\nheld that who writes on Danton must be himself in all circumstances a\r\nDantonist.\r\n\r\nThe most insignificant of literary contributions have a history and\r\nan origin; and the history of these contributions is short and simple\r\nenough. Carlyle with all the force of his humoristic genius had\r\nimpressed upon his generation an essentially one-sided view both of\r\nthe eighteenth century as a whole, and of the French thinkers of that\r\ncentury in particular. His essay on Diderot, his lecture on Rousseau,\r\nhis chapters on Voltaire, with all their brilliance, penetration, and\r\nincomparable satire, were the high-water mark in this country of the\r\nliterary reaction against the French school of Revolution. Everybody\r\nknows the famous diatribes against the Bankrupt Century and all its\r\nmen and all its works. Voltaire's furies, Diderot's indigestions,\r\nRousseau's nauseous amours, and the odd tricks and shifts of the whole\r\nof them and their company, offered ready material for the boisterous\r\nhorseplay of the transcendental humourist. Then the tide began to\r\nturn. Mr. Buckle's book on the history of civilisation had something\r\nto do with it. But it was the historical chapters in Comte's\r\nPositive Philosophy that first opened the minds of many of us, who,\r\nfive-and-twenty years ago, were young men, to a very different\r\njudgment of the true place of those schools in the literary and social\r\nhistory of Western Europe. We learnt to perceive that though much in\r\nthe thought and the lives of the literary precursors of the Revolution\r\nlaid them fairly open to Carlyle's banter, yet banter was not all, and\r\neven grave condemnation was not all. In essays, like mine, written\r\nfrom this point of view, and with the object of trying to trim the\r\nbalance rather more correctly, it may well have been that the better\r\nside of the thinkers concerned was sometimes unduly dwelt upon, and\r\ntheir worse side unduly left in the background. It may well have been\r\nthat an impression of personal adhesion was conveyed which only very\r\npartially existed, or even where it did not exist at all: that is a\r\nrisk of misinterpretation which it is always hard for the historical\r\ncritic to escape. There may have been a too eager tone; but to be\r\neager is not a very bad vice at any age under the critical forty.\r\nThere were some needlessly aggressive passages, and some sallies which\r\nought to have been avoided, because they gave pain to good people.\r\nThere was perhaps too much of the particular excitement of the time.\r\nIt was the date when _Essays and Reviews_ was still thought a terrible\r\nexplosive; when Bishop Colenso's arithmetical tests as to the flocks\r\nand herds of the children of Israel were believed to be sapping not\r\nonly the inspiration of the Pentateuch but the foundations of the\r\nFaith and the Church; and when Darwin's scientific speculations were\r\nshaking the civilised world. Some excitement was to be pardoned in\r\ndays like those, and I am quite sure that one side needed pardon at\r\nleast as much as the other. For the substantial soundness of the\r\ngeneral views winch I took of the French revolutionary thinkers at\r\nthat time, I feel no apprehension; nor--some possible occasional\r\nphrases or sentences excepted and apart--do I see the smallest reason\r\nto shrink or to depart from any one of them. So far as one particular\r\nreference may serve to illustrate the tenour of the whole body\r\nof criticism, the following lines, which close my chapter on the\r\n\"Encyclopaedia,\" will answer the purpose as well as any others, and I\r\nshall perhaps be excused for transcribing them:--\r\n\r\n    \"An urgent social task lay before France and before Europe: it\r\n    could not be postponed until the thinkers had worked out a scheme\r\n    of philosophic completeness. The thinkers did not seriously make\r\n    any effort after this completeness. The Encyclopaedia was the most\r\n    serious attempt, and it did not wholly fail. As I replace in my\r\n    shelves this mountain of volumes, 'dusky and huge, enlarging on\r\n    the sight,' I have a presentiment that their pages will seldom\r\n    again be disturbed by me or by others. They served a great purpose\r\n    a hundred years ago. They are now a monumental ruin, clothed with\r\n    all the profuse associations of history. It is no Ozymandias of\r\n    Egypt, king of kings, whose wrecked shape of stone and sterile\r\n    memories we contemplate. We think rather of the grey and crumbling\r\n    walls of an ancient stronghold, reared by the endeavour of stout\r\n    hands and faithful, whence in its own day and generation a band\r\n    once went forth against barbarous hordes, to strike a blow for\r\n    humanity and truth.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Diderot, i. 247.]\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find that the same view of the work of these\r\nfamous men, and of its relation to the social necessities of the time,\r\ncommends itself to Mr. Lecky, who has since gone diligently and with\r\na candid mind over the same ground.[1] Then where is the literary\r\nJacobin?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See his vol. vi. 305 _et seq_.]\r\n\r\nOf course, it is easy enough to fish out a sentence or a short passage\r\nhere and there which, if taken by itself, may wear a very sinister\r\nlook, and carry the most alarming impressions. Not many days ago a\r\nwriter addressed a letter to the _Times_ which furnishes a specimen of\r\nthis kind of controversy. He gave himself the ambiguous designation of\r\n\"Catholicus\"; but his style bore traces of the equivocally Catholic\r\nclimate of Munich. His aim was the lofty and magnanimous one of\r\nimporting theological prejudice into the great political dispute of\r\nthe day; in the interest, strange to say, of the Irish party who have\r\nbeen for ages the relentless oppressors of the Church to which he\r\nbelongs, and who even now hate and despise it with all the virulence\r\nof a Parisian Red. This masked assailant conveys to the mind of the\r\nreader that I applaud and sympathise with the events of the winter of\r\n1793, and more particularly with the odious procession of the\r\nGoddess of Reason at Notre Dame. He says, moreover, that I have \"the\r\neffrontery to imply that the horrible massacres of the Revolution ...\r\nwere 'a very mild story compared with the atrocities of the Jews or\r\nthe crimes of Catholicism.'\" No really honest and competent disputant\r\nwould have hit on \"effrontery\" as the note of the passage referred to,\r\nif he had had its whole spirit and drift before him. The reader shall,\r\nif he pleases, judge for himself. After the words just quoted, I go on\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n    \"Historical recriminations, however, are not edifying. It is\r\n    perfectly fair, when Catholics talk of the atheist Terror, to\r\n    rejoin that the retainers of Anjou and Montpensier slew more men\r\n    and women on the first day of the Saint Bartholomew, than perished\r\n    in Paris through the Years I. and II. But the retort does us no\r\n    good beyond the region of dialectic. Some of the opinions of\r\n    Chaumette were full of enlightenment and hope. But it would be\r\n    far better to share the superstitious opinions of a virtuous and\r\n    benignant priest, like the Bishop in Victor Hugo's _Misérables_,\r\n    than to hold these good opinions of Chaumette, as he held them,\r\n    with a rancorous intolerance, a reckless disregard of the rights\r\n    and feelings of others, and a shallow forgetfulness of all that\r\n    great and precious part of our nature that lies out of the domain\r\n    of the logical understanding.... In every family where a mother\r\n    sought to have her child baptised, or where sons and daughters\r\n    sought to have the dying spirit of the old consoled by the last\r\n    sacrament, there sprang up a bitter enemy to the government which\r\n    had closed the churches and proscribed the priests. How could a\r\n    society whose spiritual life had been nourished in the solemn\r\n    mysticism of the Middle Ages suddenly turn to embrace a gaudy\r\n    paganism? The common self-respect of humanity was outraged by\r\n    apostate priests ... as they filed before the Convention, led by\r\n    the Archbishop of Paris, and accompanied by rude acolytes bearing\r\n    piles of the robes and the vessels of silver and gold with which\r\n    they had once served their holy office.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Misc._ i 77-79.]\r\n\r\nWhere is the effrontery, the search for methods in the Reign of\r\nTerror, the applause for revolutionary models? Such inexcusable\r\nperversion of a writer's meaning for an evanescent political\r\nobject--and a very shabby object too--is enough to make one think that\r\nGeorge III. knew what he was talking about, when he once delivered\r\nhimself of the saying that \"Politics are a trade for a rascal, not for\r\na gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nLet me cite another more grotesque piece of irrelevancy with a similar\r\ndrift. Some months ago the present writer chanced to express an\r\nopinion upon Welsh Disestablishment. Wales, at any rate, would seem to\r\nbe far enough away from _Emile, Candide_, the Law of Prairial, and the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety. The _Times_, however, instantly said[1]\r\nthat it would be affectation to express any surprise, because my\r\nunfortunate \"theories and principles, drawn from French sources\r\nand framed on French models, all tend to the disintegration of\r\ncomprehensive political organisations and the encouragement of\r\narrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race or dialect.\" Was\r\nthere ever in the world such prodigious nonsense? What French sources,\r\nwhat French models? If French models point in any one direction rather\r\nthan another, it is away from disintegration and straight towards\r\ncentralisation. Everybody knows that this is one of the most notorious\r\nfacts of French history from the days of Lewis XI. or Cardinal\r\nRichelieu down to Napoleon Bonaparte. So far from French models\r\nencouraging \"arrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race and\r\ndialect,\" France is the first great example in modern history, for\r\ngood or for evil, of a persevering process of national unification,\r\nand the firm suppression of all provincial particularismus. This\r\nis not only true of French political leaders in general: it is\r\nparticularly true of the Jacobin leaders. Rousseau himself, I admit,\r\ndid in one place point in the direction of confederation; but only in\r\nthe sense that for freedom on the one hand, and just administration\r\non the other, the unit should not be too large to admit of the\r\nparticipation of the persons concerned in the management of their\r\nown public affairs. If the Jacobins had not been overwhelmed by the\r\nnecessity of keeping out the invaders, they might have developed the\r\ngerm of truth in Rousseau's loose way of stating the expediency of\r\ndecentralisation. As it was, above all other French schools, the\r\nJacobins dealt most sternly with particularist pretensions. Of all\r\nmen, these supposed masters, teachers, and models of mine are least\r\nto be called Separatists. To them more than to any other of the\r\nrevolutionary parties the great heresy of Federalism was most odious;\r\nand if I were a faithful follower of the Jacobin model, I should\r\nhave least patience with nationalist sentiment whether in Ireland,\r\nScotland, or Wales, and should most rigorously insist on that\r\ncast-iron incorporation which, as it happens, in the case of Ireland\r\nI believe to be equally hopeless and undesirable. This explanation,\r\ntherefore, of my favour for Welsh Disestablishment is as absurdly\r\nignorant as it is far-fetched and irrelevant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nov. 3, 1886.]\r\n\r\nThe logical process is worth an instant's examination. The position is\r\nno less than this,--that to attempt truly to appreciate the place and\r\nthe value in the history of thought and social movements of men who\r\nhave been a hundred years in their graves, and to sympathise with\r\ncertain sides and certain effects of their activity under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances in which French society then found itself, is the same\r\nthing as binding yourself to apply their theories and to imitate their\r\nactivity, under an entirely heterogeneous set of circumstances, in\r\na different country, and in a society with wholly dissimilar\r\nrequirements. That is the argument if we straighten it out. The\r\nchildishness of any such contention is so obvious, that I should be\r\nashamed of reproducing it, were it not that this very contention has\r\nmade its appearance at my expense several times a month for the last\r\ntwo years in all sorts of important and respectable prints.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it appears that I once said somewhere that Danton\r\nlooked on at the doings of his bloodier associates with \"sombre\r\nacquiescence.\" _Argal_, it was promptly pointed out--and I espy the\r\ndark phrase constantly adorning leading articles to this day--the man\r\nwho said that Danton sombrely acquiesced in the doings of Billaud,\r\nCollet, and the rest, must of necessity, being of a firm and logical\r\nmind, himself sombrely acquiesce in moonlighting and cattle-houghing\r\nin Ireland. Apart from the curious compulsion of the reasoning,\r\nwhat is the actual state of the case? Acquiescence is hardly a good\r\ndescription of the mood of a politician who scorns delights and lives\r\nlaborious days in actively fighting for a vigorous policy and an\r\neffective plan which, as he believes, would found order in Ireland\r\non a new and more hopeful base. He may be wrong, but where is the\r\nacquiescence, whether sombre or serene?\r\n\r\nThe equally misplaced name of Fatalism is sometimes substituted for\r\nacquiescence, in criticisms of this stamp. In any such sense anybody\r\nis a fatalist who believes in a relation between cause and effect.\r\nIf it is fatalism to assume that, given a certain chain of social or\r\npolitical antecedents, they will inevitably be followed by a certain\r\nchain of consequences, then every sensible observer of any series of\r\nevents is a fatalist. Catholic Emancipation, the extension of the\r\nfranchise, and secret ballot, have within the last sixty years\r\ncompletely shifted the balance of political power in Ireland. Land\r\nlegislation has revolutionised the conditions of ownership. These vast\r\nand vital changes in Ireland have been accompanied by the transfer of\r\ndecisive power from aristocracy to numbers in Great Britain, and Great\r\nBritain is arbiter. Is it fatalism, or is it common sense, to perceive\r\nthat one new effect of new causes so potent must be the necessity\r\nof changing the system of Irish government? To dream that you could\r\ndestroy the power of the old masters without finding new, and that\r\nhaving invited the nation to speak you could continue to ignore the\r\nnational sentiment was and is the very height of political folly, and\r\nthe longer the dream is persisted in the ruder will be the awakening.\r\nSurely the stupidest fatalism is far more truly to be ascribed to\r\nthose who insist that Ireland was eternally predestined to turmoil,\r\nconfusion, and torment; that there alone the event defies calculation;\r\nand that, however wisely, carefully and providently you modify or\r\nextinguish causes, in Ireland, though nowhere else, effects will still\r\nsurvive with shape unaltered and force unabated.\r\n\r\nNo author has a right to assume that anybody has read all his books or\r\nany of them, but he may reasonably claim that he shall not be publicly\r\nclassified, labelled, catalogued, and placed In the shelves, on the\r\nstrength of half of his work, and that half arbitrarily selected. If\r\nit be permitted to me without excess of egotism to name the masters to\r\nwhom I went to school in the days of early manhood, so far from being\r\nrevolutionists and terrorists, they belonged entirely to the opposite\r\ncamp. Austin's _Jurisprudence_ and Mill's _Logic_ and _Utilitarianism_\r\nwere everything, and Rousseau's _Social Contract_ was nothing. To the\r\nbest of my knowledge and belief, I never said a word about \"Natural\r\nRights\" in any piece of practical public business in all my life;\r\nand when that famous phrase again made its naked appearance on the\r\nplatform three or four years ago, it gave me as much surprise and\r\ndismay as if I were this afternoon to meet a Deinotherium shambling\r\ndown Parliament Street. Mill was the chief influence for me, as he was\r\nfor most of my contemporaries in those days. Experience of life and\r\nindependent use of one's mind--which he would have been the most ready\r\nof men to applaud--have since, as is natural, led to many important\r\ncorrections and deductions in Mill's political and philosophical\r\nteaching. But then we were disciples, and not critics; and nobody will\r\nsuppose that the admirer of Wordsworth, the author of the Essay on\r\nColeridge, and of the treatise on Representative Government, the\r\nadministrator in the most bureaucratic and authoritative of public\r\nservices, was a terrorist or an unbridled democrat, or anything else\r\nbut the most careful and rationalistic of political theorisers. It\r\nwas Mill who first held up for my admiration the illustrious man whom\r\nAustin enthusiastically called the \"godlike Turgot,\" and it was he who\r\nencouraged me to write a study on that great and inspiring character.\r\nI remember the suspicion and the murmurings with which Louis Blanc,\r\nthen living in brave and honourable exile in London, and the good\r\nfriend of so many of us, and who was really a literary Jacobin to\r\nthe tips of his fingers, remonstrated against that piece of what he\r\nthought grievously misplaced glorification. Turgot was, indeed, a very\r\nsingular hero with whom to open the career of literary Jacobin. So\r\nwas Burke,--the author of those wise sentences that still ring in\r\nour ears: \"_The question with me is, not whether you have a right to\r\nrender your people miserable, but whether it is not your interest to\r\nmake them happy. It is not what a lawyer tells me I may do, but what\r\nhumanity, reason, and justice tell me I ought to do. Nobody shall\r\npersuade me, where a whole people are concerned, that acts of lenity\r\nare not means of conciliation._\" Burke, Austin, Mill, Turgot,\r\nComte--what strange sponsors for the \"theories and principles of the\r\nTerror\"!\r\n\r\nWhat these opinions came to, roughly speaking, was something to this\r\neffect: That the power alike of statesmen and of publicists over the\r\ncourse of affairs is strictly limited; that institutions and movements\r\nare not capable of immediate or indefinite modification by any amount\r\nof mere will; that political truths are always relative, and never\r\nabsolute; that the test of practical, political, and social proposals\r\nis not their conformity to abstract ideals, but to convenience,\r\nutility, expediency, and occasion; that for the reformer,\r\nconsiderations of time and place may be paramount; and finally, as\r\nMill himself has put it, that government is always either in the\r\nhands, or passing into the hands, of whatever is the strongest power\r\nin society, and that what this power is, and shall be, depends less on\r\ninstitutions than institutions depend upon it. If I were pressed for\r\nan illustration of these principles at work, inspiring the minds and\r\nguiding the practice of responsible statesmen in great transactions of\r\nour own day and generation, I should point to the sage, the patient,\r\nthe triumphant action of Abraham Lincoln in the emancipation of the\r\nnegro slaves. However that may be, contrast a creed of this kind with\r\nthe abstract, absolute, geometric, unhistoric, peremptory notions and\r\nreasonings that formed the stock in trade of most, though not quite\r\nall, of the French revolutionists, alike in action and in thought. It\r\nis plain that they are the direct opposite and contradictory of one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nTo clench the matter by chapter and verse, I should like to recall\r\nwhat, I have said of these theories and principles in their most\r\nperfect and most important literary version. How have I described\r\nRousseau's _Social Contract_? It placed, I said, the centre of social\r\nactivity elsewhere than in careful and rational examination of social\r\nconditions, and careful and rational effort to modify them. It\r\nsubstituted a retrograde aspiration for direction, and emotion for the\r\ndiscovery of law. It overlooked the crucial difficulty--namely, how to\r\nsummon new force, without destroying the sound parts of a structure\r\nwhich it has taken many generations to erect. Its method was geometric\r\ninstead of being historic, and hence its \"desperate absurdity.\" Its\r\nwhole theory was constructed with an imperfect consideration of the\r\nqualities of human nature, and with too narrow a view of society. It\r\nignored the great fact that government is the art of wisely dealing\r\nwith huge groups of conflicting interests, of hostile passions, of\r\nhardly reconcilable aims, of vehemently opposed forces. It \"gives us\r\nnot the least help towards the solution of any of the problems of\r\nactual government.\"\r\n\r\nSuch language as all this is hardly that of a disciple to a master, in\r\nrespect of theories and principles which he is making his own for the\r\nuse of a lifetime. \"There has been no attempt\" [in these pages],\r\nI said in winding up, \"to palliate either the shallowness or the\r\npractical mischievousness of the _Social Contract_. But there is\r\nanother side to its influence. We should be false to our critical\r\nprinciple, if we do not recognise the historical effect of a\r\nspeculation scientifically valueless.\" Any writer would have stamped\r\nhimself as both unfit for the task that I had undertaken, and entirely\r\nbelow the level of the highest critical standard of the day, if he had\r\nfor a moment dreamed of taking any other point of view.\r\n\r\nAs for historical hero-worship, after Carlyle's fashion, whether\r\nwith Jacobin idols or any other, it is a mood of mind that must be\r\nuncongenial to anybody who had ever been at all under the influence\r\nof Mill. Without being so foolish as to disparage the part played by\r\ngreat men in great crises, we could have no sympathy with the barbaric\r\nand cynical school, who make greatness identical with violence, force,\r\nand mere iron will. Cromwell said, in vindication of himself, that\r\nEngland had need of a constable, and it was true. The constable, the\r\nsoldier, the daring counsellor at the helm, are often necessities of\r\nthe time. It is often a necessity of the time that the energy of a\r\nnation or of a movement should gather itself up in a resolute band\r\nor a resolute chief; as the revolutionary energy of France gathered\r\nitself up in the greater Jacobins, or that of England in Oliver\r\nCromwell. Goethe says that nature bids us \"_Take all, but pay_.\"\r\nRevolutions and heroes may give us all, but not without price. This is\r\nat the best, and the best is the exception. The grandiose types mostly\r\nfail. In our own day, people talk, for example, with admiration of\r\nCromwell's government in Ireland,--as if it were a success, instead of\r\nbeing one of the worst chapters in the whole history of Irish failure.\r\nIt was force carried to its utmost. Hundreds were put to the sword,\r\nthousands were banished to be slaves of the planters in the West\r\nIndies, and the remnant were driven miserably off into the desolate\r\nwilds of Connaught. But all this only prepared the way for further\r\nconvulsions and deadlier discontent.\r\n\r\nIt is irrational to contrast Carlyle's heroes, Cromwell, Mirabeau,\r\nFrederick, Napoleon, with men like Washington or Lincoln. The\r\ncircumstances were different. The conditions of public use and of\r\npersonal greatness were different. But if we are to talk of ideals,\r\nheroes, and models, I, for one, should hardly look to France at all.\r\nJefferson was no flatterer of George Washington; but his character of\r\nWashington comes far nearer to the right pattern of a great ruler than\r\ncan be found in any of Carlyle's splendid dithyrambs, and it is no\r\nwaste of time to recall and to transcribe it:--\r\n\r\n    \"His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first\r\n    order; his penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a\r\n    Newton, Bacon, or Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was\r\n    ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being little aided by\r\n    invention or imagination, but sure in conclusion. Hence the common\r\n    remark of his officers, of the advantage he derived from councils\r\n    of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he selected whatever was\r\n    best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles more\r\n    judiciously. But if deranged during the course of the action, if\r\n    any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances,\r\n    he was slow in a readjustment. He was incapable of fear, meeting\r\n    personal dangers with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest\r\n    feature in his character was prudence, never acting until\r\n    every circumstance, every consideration, was maturely weighed;\r\n    refraining if he saw a doubt, but when once decided, going through\r\n    with his purpose, whatever obstacles opposed. His integrity was\r\n    most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known; no\r\n    motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred,\r\n    being able to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense\r\n    of the word, a wise, a good, and a great man. His temper was\r\n    naturally irritable and high toned; but reflection and resolution\r\n    had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over it.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the plain truth is that all parallels, analogies, and\r\nsimilitudes between the French Revolution, or any part or phase of it,\r\nand our affairs in Ireland are moonshine. For the practical politician\r\nhis problem is always individual. For his purposes history never\r\nrepeats itself. Human nature, doubtless, has a weakness for a\r\nprecedent; it is a weakness to be respected. But there is no\r\nsuch thing as an essential reproduction of social and political\r\ncombinations of circumstance. To talk about Robespierre in connection\r\nwith Ireland is just as idle as it was in Robespierre to harangue\r\nabout Lycurgus and Brutus in Paris. To compare the two is to place\r\nIreland under a preposterous magnifying-glass of monstrous dimension.\r\nNor is disparity of scale the only difference, vital as that is. In\r\nno one of the leading characteristics of a community in a state of\r\nferment, save the odium that surrounds the landlords, and that not\r\nuniversal, does Ireland to-day really resemble the France of a\r\nhundred years ago. Manners, ideas, beliefs, traditions, crumbling\r\ninstitutions, rising aspirations, the ordering of castes and classes,\r\nthe rivalry of creeds, the relations with the governing power--all\r\nconstitute elements of such radical divergence as to make comparison\r\nbetween modern Ireland and revolutionary France for any more serious\r\npurpose than giving a conventional and familiar point to a sentence,\r\nentirely worthless.\r\n\r\nIt is pure dilettantism, again, to seek the moral of Irish commotions\r\nin the insurrection of La Vendée. That, as somebody has said, was like\r\na rising of the ancient Gauls at the voice of the Druids, and led by\r\ntheir great chiefs. It will be time enough to compare La Vendée\r\nwith Ireland when the peasantry take the field against the British\r\nGovernment with Beresfords, Fitzgeralds, and Bourkes at their head. If\r\nthe Vendéans had risen to drive out the Charettes, the Bonchamps, the\r\nLarochejacquelins, the parallel would have been nearer the mark. The\r\nreport of the Devon Commission, the green pamphlet containing an\r\naccount of the famous three days' discussion between O'Connell and\r\nButt in the Dublin Corporation In 1843, or half a dozen of Lord\r\nClare's speeches between 1793 and 1800, will give a clearer insight\r\ninto the Irish problem than a bushel of books about the Vendéan or any\r\nother episode of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nEqually frivolous is it, for any useful purpose of practical\r\nenlightenment, to draw parallels between the action of the Catholic\r\nclergy in Ireland to-day and that of the French clergy on the eve of\r\nthe Revolution. There is no sort of force in the argument that because\r\nthe French clergy fared ill at the Revolution,[1] therefore the Irish\r\nclergy will fare ill when self-government is bestowed on Ireland.\r\nSuch talk is mere ingenious guess-work at best, without any of the\r\nfoundations of a true historical analogy. The differences between the\r\ntwo cases are obvious, and they go to the heart of the matter. For\r\ninstance, the men who came to the top of affairs in France were\r\nsaturated both with speculative unbelief for one thing, and with\r\nactive hatred of the Church for another. In Ireland, on the contrary,\r\nthere is no speculative unbelief, as O'Connell used so constantly to\r\nboast; and the Church being poor, voluntary, and intensely national\r\nand popular, has nourished none of those gross and swollen abuses\r\nwhich provoked the not unreasonable animosity of revolutionary France.\r\nIn truth, it is with precisely as much or as little reason that most\r\nof the soothsayers and prognosticators of evil take the directly\r\nopposite line. Instead of France these persons choose, as they have an\r\nequally good right to do, to look for precedents to Spain, Belgium, or\r\nSouth America. Why not? They assure us, in their jingling phrase, that\r\nHome Rule means Rome Rule, that the priests will be the masters, and\r\nthat Irish autonomy is only another name for the reign of bigotry,\r\nsuperstition, and obscurantism. One of these two mutually destructive\r\npredictions has just as much to say for itself as the other, and no\r\nmore. We may leave the prophets to fight it out between them while we\r\nattend to our business, and examine facts and probabilities as\r\nthey are, without the aid of capriciously adopted precedents and\r\nfantastical analogies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Church did not fare so very ill, after all. The\r\nState, in 1790, undertook the debts of the Church to the tune of\r\n130,000,000 livres, and assured it an annual Budget of rather more\r\nthan that amount.--Boiteau's _Etat de la France_, p. 202.]\r\n\r\nParallels from France, or anywhere else, may supply literary\r\namusement; they may furnish a weapon in the play of controversy. They\r\nshed no light and do no service as we confront the solid facts of the\r\nbusiness to be done. Lewis the Fourteenth was the author of a very\r\nuseful and superior commonplace when he wrote: \"No man who is badly\r\ninformed can avoid reasoning badly. I believe that whoever is rightly\r\ninstructed, and rightly persuaded of _all the facts_, would never do\r\nanything else but what he ought.\" Another great French ruler, who,\r\neven more than Lewis, had a piercing eye for men and the world\r\nof action, said that the mind of a general ought to be like a\r\nfield-glass, and as clear; to see things exactly as they are, _et\r\njamais se faire des tableaux_,--never to compose the objects before\r\nhim into pictures. The same maxim is nearly as good for the man who\r\nhas to conquer difficulties in the field of government; and analogies\r\nand parallels are one way of substituting pictures for plans and\r\ncharts. Just because the statesman's problem is individual, history\r\ncan give him little help. I am not so graceless as to depreciate\r\nhistory or literature either for public or for private persons. \"You\r\nare a man,\" Napoleon said to Goethe; and there is no reason why\r\nliterature should prevent the reader of books from being a man; why it\r\nshould blind him to the great practical truths that the end of life\r\nis not to think but to will; that everything in the world has its\r\ndecisive moment, which statesmen know and seize; that the genius of\r\npolitics, as a great man of letters truly wrote, has not \"All or\r\nNothing\" for its motto, but seeks on the contrary to extract the\r\ngreatest advantage from situations the most compromised, and never\r\nflings the helve after the hatchet. Like literature the use of history\r\nin politics is to refresh, to open, to make the mind generous and\r\nhospitable; to enrich, to impart flexibility, to quicken and nourish\r\npolitical imagination and invention, to instruct in the common\r\ndifficulties and the various experiences of government; to enable a\r\nstatesman to place himself at a general and spacious standpoint. All\r\nthis, whether it be worth much or little, and it is surely worth much,\r\nis something wholly distinct from directly aiding a statesman in\r\nthe performance of a specific task. In such a case an analogy from\r\nhistory, if he be not sharply on his guard, is actually more likely\r\nthan not to mislead him. I certainly do not mean the history of the\r\nspecial problem itself. Of that he cannot possibly know too much, nor\r\nmaster its past course and foregone bearings too thoroughly. Ireland\r\nis a great standing instance. There is no more striking example of\r\nthe disastrous results of trying to overcome political difficulties\r\nwithout knowing how they came into existence, and where they have\r\ntheir roots. The only history that furnishes a clue in Irish questions\r\nis the history of Ireland and the people who have lived in it or have\r\nbeen driven out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE STUDY OF LITERATURE.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The annual address to the students of the London Society\r\nfor the Extension of University Teaching, delivered at the Mansion\r\nHouse, February 26th, 1887.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my friend Mr. Goschen invited me to discharge the duty which\r\nhas fallen to me this afternoon I confess that I complied with many\r\nmisgivings. He desired me to say something on the literary side of\r\neducation. Now, it is almost impossible--and I think those who know\r\nmost of literature will be readiest to agree with me--to say anything\r\nnew in recommendation of literature in a scheme of education. I have\r\nfelt, however, that Mr. Goschen has worked with such zeal and energy\r\nfor so many years on behalf of this good cause, that anybody whom he\r\nconsidered able to render him any co-operation owed it to him in its\r\nfullest extent. The Lord Mayor has been kind enough to say that I am\r\nespecially qualified to speak on English literature. I must, however,\r\nremind the Lord Mayor that I have strayed from literature into the\r\nregion of politics; and I am not at all sure that such a journey\r\nconduces to the aptness of one's judgment on literary subjects, or\r\nadds much to the force of one's arguments on behalf of literary study.\r\nPolitics are a field where action is one long second-best, and where\r\nthe choice constantly lies between two blunders. Nothing can be\r\nmore unlike in aim, in ideals, in method, and in matter, than are\r\nliterature and politics. I have, however, determined to do the best\r\nthat I can; and I feel how great an honour it is to be invited to\r\npartake in a movement which I do not hesitate to call one of the most\r\nimportant of all those now taking place in English society.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of the movement? What do the promoters aim at? I\r\ntake it that what they design is to bring the very best teaching that\r\nthe country can afford, through the hands of the most thoroughly\r\ncompetent men, within the reach of every class of the community. Their\r\nobject is to give to the many that sound, systematic, and methodical\r\nknowledge, which has hitherto been the privilege of the few who can\r\nafford the time and money to go to Oxford and Cambridge; to diffuse\r\nthe fertilising waters of intellectual knowledge from their great and\r\ncopious fountain-heads at the Universities by a thousand irrigating\r\nchannels over the whole length and breadth of our busy, indomitable\r\nland. Gentlemen, this is a most important point. Goethe said that\r\nnothing is more frightful than a teacher who only knows what his\r\nscholars are intended to know. We may depend upon it that the man\r\nwho knows his own subject most thoroughly is most likely to excite\r\ninterest about it in the minds of other people. We hear, perhaps more\r\noften than we like, that we live in a democratic age. It is true\r\nenough, and I can conceive nothing more democratic than such a\r\nmovement as this, nothing which is more calculated to remedy defects\r\nthat are incident to democracy, more thoroughly calculated to raise\r\nmodern democracy to heights which other forms of government and older\r\norderings of society have never yet attained. No movement can be more\r\nwisely democratic than one which seeks to give to the northern miner\r\nor the London artisan knowledge as good and as accurate, though he\r\nmay not have so much of it, as if he were a student at Oxford or\r\nCambridge. Something of the same kind may be said of the new frequency\r\nwith which scholars of great eminence and consummate accomplishments,\r\nlike Jowett, Lang, Myers, Leaf, and others, bring all their\r\nscholarship to bear, in order to provide for those who are not able,\r\nor do not care, to read old classics in the originals, brilliant and\r\nfaithful renderings of them in our own tongue. Nothing but good, I am\r\npersuaded, can come of all these attempts to connect learning with the\r\nliving forces of society, and to make industrial England a sharer in\r\nthe classic tradition of the lettered world.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that there is an apprehension that the present\r\nextraordinary zeal for education in all its forms--elementary,\r\nsecondary, and higher--may bear in its train some evils of its own. It\r\nis said that before long nobody in England will be content to practise\r\na handicraft, and that every one will insist on being at least a\r\nclerk. It is said that the moment is even already at hand when a great\r\ndeal of practical distress does and must result from this tendency. I\r\nremember years ago that in the United States I heard something of the\r\nsame kind. All I can say is, that this tendency, if it exists, is sure\r\nto right itself. In no case can the spread of so mischievous a notion\r\nas that knowledge and learning ought not to come within reach of\r\nhandicraftsmen be attributed to literature. There is a familiar\r\npassage in which Pericles, the great Athenian, describing the glory of\r\nthe community of which he was so far-shining a member, says, \"We at\r\nAthens are lovers of the beautiful, yet simple in our tastes; we\r\ncultivate the mind without loss of manliness.\" But then remember that\r\nafter all Athenian society rested on a basis of slavery. Athenian\r\ncitizens were able to pursue their love of the beautiful, and their\r\nsimplicity, and to cultivate their minds without loss of manliness,\r\nbecause the drudgery and hard work and rude service of society were\r\nperformed by those who had no share in all these good things. With us,\r\nhappily, it is very different. We are all more or less upon a level.\r\nOur object is--and it is that which in my opinion raises us infinitely\r\nabove the Athenian level--to bring the Periclean ideas of beauty and\r\nsimplicity and cultivation of the mind within the reach of those who\r\ndo the drudgery and the service and rude work of the world. And it can\r\nbe done--do not let us be afraid--it can be done without in the least\r\ndegree impairing the skill of our handicraftsmen or the manliness of\r\nour national life. It can be done without blunting or numbing the\r\npractical energies of our people.\r\n\r\nI know they say that if you meddle with literature you are less\r\nqualified to take your part in practical affairs. You run a risk of\r\nbeing labelled a dreamer and a theorist. But, after all, if we take\r\nthe very highest form of all practical energy--the governing of the\r\ncountry--all this talk is ludicrously untrue. I venture to say that in\r\nthe present Government [1887], including the Prime Minister, there are\r\nthree men at least who are perfectly capable of earning their bread as\r\nmen of letters. In the late Government, besides the Prime Minister,\r\nthere were also three men of letters, and I have never heard that\r\nthose three were greater simpletons than their neighbours. There is\r\na Commission now at work on that very important and abstruse\r\nsubject--the Currency. I am told that no one there displays so acute\r\nan intelligence of the difficulties that are to be met, and so ready\r\nan apprehension of the important arguments that are brought forward,\r\nand the practical ends to be achieved, as the chairman of the\r\nCommission, who is not what is called a practical man, but a man\r\nof study, literature, theoretical speculation, and university\r\ntraining.[1] Oh no, gentlemen, some of the best men of business in the\r\ncountry are men who have had the best collegian's equipment, and are\r\nthe most accomplished bookmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Arthur Balfour.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that we cannot bring to London, with this movement, the\r\nindefinable charm that haunts the grey and venerable quadrangles of\r\nOxford and Cambridge. We cannot take you into the stately halls, the\r\nsilent and venerable libraries, the solemn chapels, the studious\r\nold-world gardens. We cannot surround you with all those elevated\r\nmemorials and sanctifying associations of scholars and poets, of\r\nsaints and sages, that march in glorious procession through the ages,\r\nand make of Oxford and Cambridge a dream of music for the inward ear,\r\nand of delight for the contemplative eye. We cannot bring all that to\r\nyou; but I hope, and I believe, it is the object of those who are more\r\nintimately connected with the society than I have been, that every\r\npartaker of the benefits of this society will feel himself and herself\r\nin living connection with those two famous centres, and feel conscious\r\nof the links that bind the modern to the older England. One of the\r\nmost interesting facts mentioned in your report this year is that last\r\nwinter four prizes of £10 each were offered in the mining district of\r\nNorthumberland, one each to the male and female student in every term\r\nwho should take the highest place in the examination, in order to\r\nenable them to spend a month in Cambridge in the long vacation for the\r\npurpose of carrying on in the laboratories and museums the work in\r\nwhich they had been engaged in the winter at the local centre. That is\r\nnot a step taken by our society; but the University of Cambridge has\r\ninspired and worked out the scheme, and I am not without hope that\r\nfrom London some of those who attend these classes may be able to\r\nrealise in person the attractions and the associations of these two\r\ngreat historic sites. One likes to think how poor scholars three or\r\nfour hundred years ago used to flock to Oxford, regardless of cold,\r\nprivation, and hardship, so that they might satisfy their hunger and\r\nthirst for knowledge. I like to think of them in connection with this\r\nmovement. I like to think of them in connection with students like\r\nthose miners in Northumberland, whom I know well, and who are\r\nmentioned in the report of the Cambridge Extension Society as, after\r\na day's hard work in the pit, walking four or five miles through cold\r\nand darkness and rough roads to hear a lecture, and then walking\r\nback again the same four or five miles. You must look for the same\r\nenthusiasm, the same hunger and thirst for knowledge, that presided\r\nover the foundation of the Universities many centuries ago, to carry\r\non this work, to strengthen and stimulate men's faith in knowledge,\r\ntheir hopes from it, and their zeal for it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking now of the particular kind of knowledge of which I am going\r\nto say a few words--how does literature fare in these important\r\noperations? Last term, out of fifty-seven courses in the Cambridge\r\nscheme, there were ten on literature: out of thirty-one of our\r\ncourses, seven were on literature. I am bound to say I think that\r\nsuch a position for literature in the scheme is very reasonably\r\nsatisfactory. I have made some inquiries, since I knew that I was\r\ngoing to speak here, in the great popular centres of industry in the\r\nNorth and in Scotland as to the popularity of literature as a subject\r\nof teaching, I find very much what I should have expected. The\r\nprofessors all tell very much the same story, and this is, that it\r\nis extremely hard to interest any considerable number of people in\r\nsubjects that seem to have no direct bearing upon the practical work\r\nof everyday life. There is a disinclination to study literature for\r\nits own sake, or to study anything which does not seem to have a\r\nvisible and direct influence upon the daily work of life. The nearest\r\napproach to a taste for literature is a certain demand for instruction\r\nin history with a little flavour of contemporary politics. In short,\r\nthe demand for instruction in literature is strictly moderate. That is\r\nwhat men of experience tell me, and we have to recognise it, nor ought\r\nwe to be at all surprised. Mr. Goschen, when he spoke some years ago,\r\nsaid there were three motives which might induce people to seek the\r\nhigher education. First, to obtain greater knowledge for bread-winning\r\npurposes. From that point of view science would be most likely to feed\r\nthe classes. Secondly, the improvement of one's knowledge of political\r\neconomy, and history, and facts bearing upon the actual political work\r\nand life of the day. Thirdly, was the desire of knowledge as a luxury\r\nto brighten life and kindle thought. I am very much afraid that, in\r\nthe ordinary temper of our people, and the ordinary mode of looking at\r\nlife, the last of these motives savours a little of self-indulgence,\r\nand sentimentality, and other objectionable qualities. There is a\r\ngreat stir in the region of physical science at this moment, and it is\r\nlikely, as any one may see, to take a chief and foremost place in the\r\nfield of intellectual activity. After the severity with which science\r\nwas for so many ages treated by literature, we cannot wonder that\r\nscience now retaliates, now mightily exalts herself, and thrusts\r\nliterature down into the lower place. I only have to say on the\r\nrelative claims of science and literature what Dr Arnold said:--\"If\r\none might wish for impossibilities, I might then wish that my children\r\nmight be well versed in physical science, but in due subordination to\r\nthe fulness and freshness of their knowledge on moral subjects. This,\r\nhowever, I believe cannot be; wherefore, rather than have it the\r\nprincipal thing in my son's mind, I would gladly have him think that\r\nthe sun went round the earth, and that the stars were so many spangles\r\nset in the bright blue firmament\" (Stanley's _Life of Arnold_, ii.\r\n31). It is satisfactory that one may know something of these matters,\r\nand yet not believe that the sun goes round the earth. But if there\r\nis to be exclusion, I, for one, am not prepared to accept the rather\r\nenormous pretensions that are nowadays sometimes made for physical\r\nscience as the be-all and end-all of education.\r\n\r\nNext to this we know that there is a great stir on behalf of technical\r\nand commercial education. The special needs of our time and country\r\ncompel us to pay a particular attention to this subject. Here\r\nknowledge is business, and we shall never hold our industrial\r\npre-eminence, with all that hangs upon that pre-eminence, unless we\r\npush on technical and commercial education with all our might. But\r\nthere is a third kind of knowledge, and that too, in its own way, is\r\nbusiness. There is the cultivation of the sympathies and imagination,\r\nthe quickening of the moral sensibilities, and the enlargement of the\r\nmoral vision. The great need in modern culture, which is scientific\r\nin method, rationalistic in spirit, and utilitarian in purpose, is to\r\nfind some effective agency for cherishing within us the ideal. That\r\nis the business and function of literature. Literature alone will not\r\nmake a good citizen; it will not make a good man. History affords too\r\nmany proofs that scholarship and learning by no means purge men of\r\nacrimony, of vanity, of arrogance, of a murderous tenacity about\r\ntrifles. Mere scholarship and learning and the knowledge of books do\r\nnot by any means arrest and dissolve all the travelling acids of the\r\nhuman system. Nor would I pretend for a moment that literature can be\r\nany substitute for life and action. Burke said, \"What is the education\r\nof the generality of the world? Reading a parcel of books? No!\r\nRestraint and discipline, examples of virtue and of justice, these are\r\nwhat form the education of the world.\" That is profoundly true; it is\r\nlife that is the great educator. But the parcel of books, if they are\r\nwell chosen, reconcile us to this discipline; they interpret this\r\nvirtue and justice; they awaken within us the diviner mind, and rouse\r\nus to a consciousness of what is best in others and ourselves.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of rude fact, there is much to make us question whether the\r\nspread of literature, as now understood, does awaken the diviner mind.\r\nThe numbers of the books that are taken out from public libraries are\r\nnot all that we could wish. I am not going to inflict many figures on\r\nyou, but there is one set of these figures that distresses\r\nbooklovers,--I mean the enormous place that fiction occupies in the\r\nbooks that are taken out. In one great town in the North prose fiction\r\nforms 76 per cent of all the books lent. In another great town prose\r\nfiction is 82 per cent; in a third 84 per cent; and in a fourth 67 per\r\ncent. I had the curiosity to see what happens in the libraries of the\r\nUnited States; and there--supposing the system of cataloguing and\r\nenumeration to be the same--they are a trifle more serious in their\r\ntaste than we are; where our average is about 70 per cent, at a place\r\nlike Chicago it is only about 60 per cent. In Scotland, too, it ought to\r\nbe said that they have a better average in respect to prose fiction.\r\nThere is a larger demand for books called serious than in England. And I\r\nsuspect, though I do not know, that one reason why there is in Scotland\r\na greater demand for the more serious classes of literature than\r\nfiction, is that in the Scotch Universities there are what we have not\r\nin England--well-attended chairs of literature, systematically and\r\nmethodically studied. Do not let it be supposed that I at all underrate\r\nthe value of fiction. On the contrary, when a man has done a hard day's\r\nwork, what can he do better than fall to and read the novels of Walter\r\nScott, or the Brontes, or Mrs. Gaskell, or some of our living writers. I\r\nam rather a voracious reader of fiction myself. I do not, therefore,\r\npoint to it as a reproach or as a source of discouragement, that fiction\r\ntakes so large a place in the objects of literary interest. I only\r\nsuggest that it is much too large, and we should be better pleased if it\r\nsank to about 40 per cent, and what is classified as general literature\r\nrose from 13 to 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are other complaints of literature as an object of interest in\r\nthis country. I was reading the other day an essay by the late head of\r\nmy old college at Oxford, that very learned and remarkable man Mark\r\nPattison, who was a booklover if ever there was one. He complained\r\nthat the bookseller's bill in the ordinary English middle class family\r\nis shamefully small. It appeared to him to be monstrous that a man\r\nwho is earning £1000 a year should spend less than £1 a week on\r\nbooks--that is to say, less than a shilling in the pound per annum. I\r\nknow that Chancellors of the Exchequer take from us 8d. or 6d. in the\r\npound, and I am not sure that they always use it as wisely as if they\r\nleft us to spend it on books. Still, a shilling in the pound to be\r\nspent on books by a clerk who earns a couple of hundred pounds a year,\r\nor by a workman who earns a quarter of that sum, is rather more, I\r\nthink, than can be reasonably expected. A man does not really need\r\nto have a great many books. Pattison said that nobody who respected\r\nhimself could have less than 1000 volumes. He pointed out that you can\r\nstack 1000 octavo volumes in a bookcase that shall be 13 feet by 10\r\nfeet, and 6 inches deep, and that everybody has that small amount of\r\nspace at disposal. Still the point is not that men should have a great\r\nmany books, but that they should have the right ones, and that they\r\nshould use those that they have. We may all agree in lamenting\r\nthat there are so many houses--even some of considerable social\r\npretension--where you will not find a good atlas, a good dictionary,\r\nor a good cyclopaedia of reference. What is still more lamentable, in\r\na good many more houses where these books are, they are never referred\r\nto or opened. That is a very discreditable fact, because I defy\r\nanybody to take up a single copy of the _Times_ newspaper and not come\r\nupon something in it, upon which, if their interest in the affairs of\r\nthe day were active, intelligent, and alert as it ought to be, they\r\nwould consult an atlas, dictionary, or cyclopaedia of reference.\r\n\r\nNo sensible person can suppose for a single moment that everybody\r\nis born with the ability for using books, for reading and studying\r\nliterature. Certainly not everybody is born with the capacity of being\r\na great scholar. All people are no more born great scholars like\r\nGibbon and Bentley, than they are all born great musicians like Handel\r\nand Beethoven. What is much worse than that, many come into the world\r\nwith the incapacity of reading, just as they come into it with the\r\nincapacity of distinguishing one tune from another. To them I have\r\nnothing to say. Even the morning paper is too much for them. They can\r\nonly skim the surface even of that. I go further, and frankly admit\r\nthat the habit and power of reading with reflection, comprehension,\r\nand memory all alert and awake, does not come at once to the\r\nnatural man any more than many other sovereign virtues come to that\r\ninteresting creature. What I do venture to press upon you is, that\r\nit requires no preterhuman force of will in any young man or\r\nwoman--unless household circumstances are more than usually vexatious\r\nand unfavourable--to get at least half an hour out of a solid busy day\r\nfor good and disinterested reading. Some will say that this is too\r\nmuch to expect, and the first persons to say it, I venture to predict,\r\nwill be those who waste their time most. At any rate, if I cannot get\r\nhalf an hour, I will be content with a quarter. Now, in half an hour I\r\nfancy you can read fifteen or twenty pages of Burke; or you can read\r\none of Wordsworth's masterpieces--say the lines on Tintern; or\r\nsay, one-third--if a scholar, in the original, and if not, in a\r\ntranslation--of a book of the Iliad or the Aeneid. I do not think that\r\nI am filling the half-hour too full. But try for yourselves what you\r\ncan read in half an hour. Then multiply the half-hour by 365, and\r\nconsider what treasures you might have laid by at the end of the year;\r\nand what happiness, fortitude, and wisdom they would have given you\r\nduring all the days of your life.\r\n\r\nI will not take up your time by explaining the various mechanical\r\ncontrivances and aids to successful study. They are not to be despised\r\nby those who would extract the most from books, Many people think of\r\nknowledge as of money. They would like knowledge, but cannot face the\r\nperseverance and self-denial that go to the acquisition of it. The\r\nwise student will do most of his reading with a pen or a pencil in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe will not shrink from the useful toil of making abstracts and\r\nsummaries of what he is reading. Sir William Hamilton was a strong\r\nadvocate for underscoring books of study. \"Intelligent underlining,\"\r\nhe said, \"gave a kind of abstract of an important work, and by the\r\nuse of different coloured inks to mark a difference of contents,\r\nand discriminate the doctrinal from the historical or illustrative\r\nelements of an argument or exposition, the abstract became an analysis\r\nvery serviceable for ready reference,\"[1] This assumes, as Hamilton\r\nsaid, that the book to be operated on is your own, and perhaps is\r\nrather too elaborate a counsel of perfection for most of us. Again,\r\nsome great men--Gibbon was one, and Daniel Webster was another, and\r\nthe great Lord Strafford was a third--always before reading a book\r\nmade a short, rough analysis of the questions which they expected to\r\nbe answered in it, the additions to be made to their knowledge, and\r\nwhither it would take them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Veitch's _Life of Hamilton_, pp. 314, 392.]\r\n\r\n\"After glancing my eye,\" says Gibbon, \"over the design and order of\r\na new book, I suspended the perusal until I had finished the task of\r\nself-examination; till I had revolved in a solitary walk all that I\r\nknew or believed or had thought on the subject of the whole work or of\r\nsome particular chapter: I was then qualified to discern how much the\r\nauthor added to my original stock; and if I was sometimes satisfied\r\nby the agreement, I was sometimes armed by the opposition, of our\r\nideas.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Smith's _Gibbon_, i. 64.]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes tried that way of steadying and guiding attention;\r\nand I commend it to you. I need not tell you that you will find that\r\nmost books worth reading once are worth reading twice, and--what\r\nis most important of all--the masterpieces of literature are worth\r\nreading a thousand times. It is a great mistake to think that because\r\nyou have read a masterpiece once or twice, or ten times, therefore you\r\nhave done with it. Because it is a masterpiece, you ought to live with\r\nit, and make it part of your daily life. Another practice is that of\r\nkeeping a commonplace book, and transcribing into it what is striking\r\nand interesting and suggestive. And if you keep it wisely, as Locke\r\nhas taught us, you will put every entry under a head, division, or\r\nsubdivision.[1] This Is an excellent practice for concentrating your\r\nthought on the passage and making you alive to its real point and\r\nsignificance. Here, however, the high authority of Gibbon is against\r\nus. He refuses \"strenuously to recommend.\" \"The action of the pen,\" he\r\nsays, \"will doubtless imprint an idea on the mind as well as on the\r\npaper; but I much question whether the benefits of this laborious\r\nmethod are adequate to the waste of time; and I must agree with Dr.\r\nJohnson (_Idler_, No. 74) that 'what is twice read is commonly better\r\nremembered than what is transcribed.'\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"If I would put anything in my Common-place Book, I\r\nfind out a head to which I may refer it. Each head ought to be some\r\nimportant and essential word to the matter in hand\" (Locke's _Works_,\r\niii. 308, ed. 1801).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This is for indexing purposes, but it is worth while to\r\ngo further and make a title for the passage extracted, indicating its\r\npith and purport.]\r\n\r\nVarious correspondents have asked me to say something about those\r\nlists of a hundred books that have been circulating through the world\r\nwithin the last few months. I have examined some of these lists with\r\nconsiderable care, and whatever else may be said of them--and I speak\r\nof them with deference and reserve, because men for whom one must\r\nhave a great regard have compiled them--they do not seem to me to be\r\ncalculated either to create or satisfy a wise taste for literature\r\nin any very worthy sense. To fill a man with a hundred parcels of\r\nheterogeneous scraps from the _Mahabharata_, and the _Sheking_, down\r\nto _Pickwick_ and _White's Selborne_, may pass the time, but I cannot\r\nperceive how it would strengthen or instruct or delight. For instance,\r\nit is a mistake to think that every book that has a great name in the\r\nhistory of books or of thought is worth reading. Some of the most\r\nfamous books are least worth reading. Their fame was due to their\r\ndoing something that needed in their day to be done. The work done,\r\nthe virtue of the book expires. Again, I agree with those who say\r\nthat the steady working down one of these lists would end in the\r\nmanufacture of that obnoxious product--the prig. A prig has been\r\ndefined as an animal that is overfed for its size. I think that these\r\nbewildering miscellanies would lead to an immense quantity of that\r\nkind of overfeeding. The object of reading is not to dip into\r\neverything that even wise men have ever written. In the words of one\r\nof the most winning writers of English that ever existed--Cardinal\r\nNewman--the object of literature in education is to open the mind, to\r\ncorrect it, to refine it, to enable it to comprehend and digest its\r\nknowledge, to give it power over its own faculties, application,\r\nflexibility, method, critical exactness, sagacity, address, and\r\nexpression. These are the objects of that intellectual perfection\r\nwhich a literary education is destined to give. I will not venture on\r\na list of a hundred books, but will recommend you instead to one book\r\nwell worthy of your attention. Those who are curious as to what they\r\nshould read in the region of pure literature will do well to peruse\r\nMr. Frederic Harrison's admirable, volume, called _The Choice of\r\nBooks_. You will find there as much wise thought, eloquently and\r\nbrilliantly put, as in any volume of its size and on its subject,\r\nwhether it be in the list of a hundred or not.\r\n\r\nLet me pass to another topic. We are often asked whether it is best to\r\nstudy subjects, or authors, or books. Well, I think that is like most\r\nof the stock questions with which the perverse ingenuity of mankind\r\ntorments itself. There is no universal and exclusive answer. My own\r\nanswer is a very plain one. It is sometimes best to study books,\r\nsometimes authors, and sometimes subjects; but at all times it is best\r\nto study authors, subjects, and books in connection with one another.\r\nWhether you make your first approach from interest in an author or in\r\na book, the fruit will be only half gathered if you leave off without\r\nnew ideas and clearer lights both on the man and the matter. One of\r\nthe noblest masterpieces in the literature of civil and political\r\nwisdom is to be found in Burke's three performances on the American\r\nwar--his speech on Taxation in 1774, on Conciliation in 1775, and his\r\nletter to the Sheriffs of Bristol in 1777. I can only repeat to you\r\nwhat I have been saying in print and out of it for a good many years,\r\nand what I believe more firmly as observation is enlarged by time and\r\noccasion, that these three pieces are the most perfect manual in all\r\nliterature for the study of great affairs, whether for the purpose of\r\nknowledge or action. \"They are an example,\" as I have said before\r\nnow, \"an example without fault of all the qualities which the critic,\r\nwhether a theorist or an actor, of great political situations should\r\nstrive by night and by day to possess. If their subject were as remote\r\nas the quarrel between the Corinthians and Corcyra, or the war between\r\nRome and the Allies, instead of a conflict to which the world owes the\r\nopportunity of one of the most important of political experiments, we\r\nshould still have everything to learn from the author's treatment; the\r\nvigorous grasp of masses of compressed detail, the wide illumination\r\nfrom great principles of human experience, the strong and masculine\r\nfeeling for the two great political ends of Justice and Freedom, the\r\nlarge and generous interpretation of expediency, the morality, the\r\nvision, the noble temper.\" No student worthy of the name will lay\r\naside these pieces, so admirable in their literary expression, so\r\nimportant for history, so rich in the lessons of civil wisdom, until\r\nhe has found out something from other sources as to the circumstances\r\nfrom which such writings arose, and as to the man whose resplendent\r\ngenius inspired them. There are great personalities like Burke who\r\nmarch through history with voices like a clarion trumpet and something\r\nlike the glitter of swords in their hands. They are as interesting as\r\ntheir work. Contact with them warms and kindles the mind. You will not\r\nbe content, after reading one of these pieces, without knowing the\r\ncharacter and personality of the man who conceived it, and until you\r\nhave spent an hour or two--and an hour or two will go a long way with\r\nBurke still fresh in your mind--over other compositions in political\r\nliterature, over Bacon's civil pieces, or Machiavelli's _Prince_, and\r\nothers in the same order of thought.\r\n\r\nThis points to the right answer to another question that is constantly\r\nasked. We are constantly asked whether desultory reading is among\r\nthings lawful and permitted. May we browse at large in a library, as\r\nJohnson said, or is it forbidden to open a book without a definite aim\r\nand fixed expectations? I am for a compromise. If a man has once got\r\nhis general point of view, if he has striven with success to place\r\nhimself at the centre, what follows is of less consequence. If he has\r\ngot in his head a good map of the country, he may ramble at large with\r\nimpunity. If he has once well and truly laid the foundations of a\r\nmethodical, systematic habit of mind, what he reads will find its way\r\nto its proper place. If his intellect is in good order, he will find\r\nin every quarter something to assimilate and something that will\r\nnourish.\r\n\r\nNext I am going to deal with another question, with which perhaps I\r\nought to have started. What is literature? It has often been defined.\r\nEmerson says it is a record of the best thoughts. \"By literature,\"\r\nsays another author, \"we mean the written thoughts and feelings of\r\nintelligent men and women arranged in a way that shall give pleasure\r\nto the reader.\" A third account is that \"the aim of a student of\r\nliterature is to know the best that has been thought in the world.\"\r\nDefinitions always appear to me in these things to be in the nature\r\nof vanity. I feel that the attempt to be compact in the definition of\r\nliterature ends in something that is rather meagre, partial, starved,\r\nand unsatisfactory. I turn to the answer given by a great French\r\nwriter to a question not quite the same, viz. \"What is a classic?\"\r\nLiterature consists of a whole body of classics in the true sense of\r\nthe word, and a classic, as Sainte-Beuve defines him, is an \"author\r\nwho has enriched the human mind, who has really added to its treasure,\r\nwho has got it to take a step further; who has discovered some\r\nunequivocal moral truth, or penetrated to some eternal passion,\r\nin that heart of man where it seemed as though all were known and\r\nexplored, who has produced his thought, or his observation, or his\r\ninvention under some form, no matter what, so it be great, large,\r\nacute, and reasonable, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to\r\nall in a style of his own, yet a style which finds itself the style\r\nof everybody,--in a style that Is at once new and antique, and is the\r\ncontemporary of all the ages.\" Another Frenchman, Doudan, who died in\r\n1872, has an excellent passage on the same subject:--\r\n\r\n    \"The man of letters properly so called is a rather singular being:\r\n    he does not look at things exactly with his own eyes, he has not\r\n    impressions of his own, we could not discover the imagination with\r\n    which he started. 'Tis a tree on which have been grafted Homer,\r\n    Virgil, Milton, Dante, Petrarch; hence have grown peculiar flowers\r\n    which are not natural, and yet which are not artificial. Study has\r\n    given to the man of letters something of the reverie of René; with\r\n    Homer he has looked upon the plain of Troy, and there has remained\r\n    in his brain some of the light of the Grecian sky; he has taken a\r\n    little of the pensive lustre of Virgil, as he wanders by his side\r\n    on the slopes of the Aventine; he sees the world as Milton saw it,\r\n    through the grey mists of England, as Dante saw it, through the\r\n    clear and glowing light of Italy. Of all these colours he composes\r\n    for himself a colour that is unique and his own; from all these\r\n    glasses by which his life passes on its journey to the real\r\n    world, there is formed a special tint, and that is what makes the\r\n    imagination of men of letters.\"\r\n\r\nAt a single hearing you may not take all that in; but if you should\r\nhave any opportunity of recurring to it, you will find this a\r\nsatisfactory, full, and instructive account of what is a classic, and\r\nwill find in it a full and satisfactory account of what those who have\r\nthought most on literature hope to get from it, and most would\r\ndesire to confer upon others by it. Literature consists of till the\r\nbooks--and they are not so many--where moral truth and human passion\r\nare touched with a certain largeness, sanity, and attraction of form.\r\nMy notion of the literary student is one who through books explores\r\nthe strange voyages of man's moral reason, the impulses of the human\r\nheart, the chances and changes that have overtaken human ideals\r\nof virtue and happiness, of conduct and manners, and the shifting\r\nfortunes of great conceptions of truth and virtue. Poets, dramatists,\r\nhumorists, satirists, masters of fiction, the great preachers,\r\nthe character-writers, the maxim-writers, the great political\r\norators--they are all literature in so far as they teach us to know\r\nman and to know human nature. This is what makes literature, rightly\r\nsifted and selected and rightly studied, not the mere elegant trifling\r\nthat it is so often and so erroneously supposed to be, but a\r\nproper instrument for a systematic training of the imagination and\r\nsympathies, and of a genial and varied moral sensibility.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view let me remind you that books are not the\r\nproducts of accident and caprice. As Goethe said, if you would\r\nunderstand an author, you must understand his age. The same thing is\r\njust as true of a book. If you would fully comprehend it, you must\r\nknow the age. There is an order; there are causes and relations\r\nbetween great compositions and the societies in which they have\r\nemerged. Just as the naturalist strives to understand and to explain\r\nthe distribution of plants and animals over the surface of the globe,\r\nto connect their presence or their absence with the great geological,\r\nclimatic, and oceanic changes, so the student of literature, if he be\r\nwise, undertakes an ordered and connected survey of ideas, of tastes,\r\nof sentiments, of imagination, of humour, of invention, as they affect\r\nand as they are affected by the ever changing experiences of human\r\nnature, and the manifold variations that time and circumstances are\r\nincessantly working in human society.\r\n\r\nThose who are possessed, and desire to see others possessed, by that\r\nconception of literary study must watch with the greatest sympathy and\r\nadmiration the efforts of those who are striving so hard, and, I hope,\r\nso successfully, to bring the systematic and methodical study of our\r\nown literature, in connection with other literatures, among subjects\r\nfor teaching and examination in the Universities of Oxford and\r\nCambridge. I regard those efforts with the liveliest interest and\r\nsympathy. Everybody agrees that an educated man ought to have a\r\ngeneral notion of the course of the great outward events of European\r\nhistory. So, too, an educated man ought to have a general notion of\r\nthe course of all those inward thoughts and moods which find their\r\nexpression in literature. I think that in cultivating the study of\r\nliterature, as I have perhaps too laboriously endeavoured to define\r\nit, you will be cultivating the most important side of history.\r\nKnowledge of it gives stability and substance to character. It\r\nfurnishes a view of the ground we stand on. It builds up a solid\r\nbacking of precedent and experience. It teaches us where we are. It\r\nprotects us against imposture and surprise.\r\n\r\nBefore closing I should like to say one word upon the practice of\r\ncomposition. I have suffered, by the chance of life, many things from\r\nthe practice of composition. It has been my lot, I suppose, to read\r\nmore unpublished work than any one else in this room.\r\n\r\nThere is an idea, and, I venture to think, a very mistaken idea, that\r\nyou cannot have a taste for literature unless you are yourself an\r\nauthor. I make bold entirely to demur to that proposition. It is\r\npractically most mischievous, and leads scores and even hundreds of\r\npeople to waste their time in the most unprofitable manner that the\r\nwit of man can devise, on work in which they can no more achieve even\r\nthe most moderate excellence than they can compose a Ninth Symphony\r\nor paint a Transfiguration. It Is a terrible error to suppose that\r\nbecause one is happily able to relish \"Wordsworth's solemn-thoughted\r\nidyll, or Tennyson's enchanted reverie,\" therefore a solemn mission\r\ncalls you to run off to write bad verse at the Lakes or the Isle\r\nof Wight. I beseech you not all to turn to authorship. I will even\r\nventure, with all respect to those who are teachers of literature,\r\nto doubt the excellence and utility of the practice of over-much\r\nessay-writing and composition. I have very little faith in rules of\r\nstyle, though I have an unbounded faith in the virtue of cultivating\r\ndirect and precise expression. But you must carry on the operation\r\ninside the mind, and not merely by practising literary deportment on\r\npaper. It is not everybody who can command the mighty rhythm of the\r\ngreatest masters of human speech. But every one can make reasonably\r\nsure that he knows what he means, and whether he has found the right\r\nword. These are internal operations, and are not forwarded by writing\r\nfor writing's sake. Everybody must be urgent for attention to\r\nexpression, if that attention be exercised in the right way. It has\r\nbeen said a million times that the foundation of right expression in\r\nspeech or writing is sincerity. That is as true now as it has ever\r\nbeen. Right expression is a part of character. As somebody has\r\nsaid, by learning to speak with precision, you learn to think with\r\ncorrectness; and the way to firm and vigorous speech lies through the\r\ncultivation of high and noble sentiments. So far as my observation has\r\ngone, men will do better if they seek precision by studying carefully\r\nand with an open mind and a vigilant eye the great models of writing,\r\nthan by excessive practice of writing on their own account.\r\n\r\nMuch might here be said on what is one of the most important of all\r\nthe sides of literary study. I mean its effect as helping to preserve\r\nthe dignity and the purity of the English language. That noble\r\ninstrument has never been exposed to such dangers as those which\r\nbeset it to-day. Domestic slang, scientific slang, pseudo-aesthetic\r\naffectations, hideous importations from American newspapers, all bear\r\ndown with horrible force upon the glorious fabric which the genius of\r\nour race has reared. I will say nothing of my own on this pressing\r\ntheme, but will read to you a passage of weight and authority from the\r\ngreatest master of mighty and beautiful speech.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever in a state,\" said Milton, \"knows how wisely to form the\r\nmanners of men and to rule them at home and in war with excellent\r\ninstitutes, him in the first place, above others, I should esteem\r\nworthy of all honour. But next to him the man who strives to establish\r\nin maxims and rules the method and habit of speaking and writing\r\nreceived from a good age of the nation, and, as it were, to fortify\r\nthe same round with a kind of wall, the daring to overleap which let a\r\nlaw only short of that of Romulus be used to prevent.... The one, as I\r\nbelieve, supplies noble courage and intrepid counsels against an\r\nenemy invading the territory. The other takes to himself the task of\r\nextirpating and defeating, by means of a learned detective police of\r\nears, and a light band of good authors, that barbarism which makes\r\nlarge inroads upon the minds of men, and is a destructive intestine\r\nenemy of genius. Nor is it to be considered of small consequence what\r\nlanguage, pure or corrupt, a people has, or what is their customary\r\ndegree of propriety in speaking it.... For, let the words of a country\r\nbe in part unhandsome and offensive in themselves, in part debased by\r\nwear and wrongly uttered, and what do they declare, but, by no light\r\nindication, that the inhabitants of that country are an indolent,\r\nidly-yawning race, with minds already long prepared for any amount of\r\nservility? On the other hand, we have never heard that any empire, any\r\nstate, did not at least flourish in a middling degree as long as its\r\nown liking and care for its language lasted.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Letter to Bonmattei, from Florence, 1638.]\r\n\r\nThe probabilities are that we are now coming to an epoch of a quieter\r\nstyle. There have been in our generation three strong masters in the\r\naft of prose writing. There was, first of all, Carlyle, there was\r\nMacaulay, and there is Mr. Raskin. These are all giants, and they have\r\nthe rights of giants. But I do not believe that a greater misfortune\r\ncan befall the students who attend classes here, than that they should\r\nstrive to write like any one of these three illustrious men. I think\r\nit is the worst thing that can happen to them. They can never attain\r\nto the high mark which they have set before themselves. It Is not\r\neverybody who can bend the bow of Ulysses, and most men only do\r\nthemselves a mischief by trying to bend it. If we are now on our way\r\nto a quieter style, I am not sorry for it. Truth is quiet. Milton's\r\nphrase ever lingers in our minds as one of imperishable beauty--where\r\nhe regrets that he is drawn by I know not what, from beholding the\r\nbright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful\r\nstudies. Moderation and judgment are, for most purposes, more than the\r\nflash and the glitter even of the genius. I hope that your professors\r\nof rhetoric will teach you to cultivate that golden art--the steadfast\r\nuse of a language in which truth can be told; a speech that is\r\nstrong by natural force, and not merely effective by declamation; an\r\nutterance without trick, without affectation, without mannerisms,\r\nwithout any of that excessive ambition which overleaps itself as\r\ndisastrously in prose writing as in so many other things.\r\n\r\nI will detain you no longer. I hope that I have made it clear that we\r\nconceive the end of education on its literary side to be to make a man\r\nand not a cyclopaedia, to make a citizen and not an album of elegant\r\nextracts. Literature does not end with knowledge of forms, with\r\ninventories of books and authors, with finding the key of rhythm, with\r\nthe varying measure of the stanza, or the changes from the involved\r\nand sonorous periods of the seventeenth century down to the _staccato_\r\nof the nineteenth, or all the rest of the technicalities of\r\nscholarship. Do not think I contemn these. They are all good things to\r\nknow, but they are not ends in themselves. The intelligent man, says\r\nPlato, will prize those studies which result in his soul getting\r\nsoberness, righteousness, and wisdom, and he will less value the\r\nothers. Literature is one of the instruments, and one of the most\r\npowerful instruments, for forming character for giving us men\r\nand women armed with reason, braced by knowledge, clothed with\r\nsteadfastness and courage, and inspired by that public spirit and\r\npublic virtue of which it has been well said that they are the\r\nbrightest ornaments of the mind of man. Bacon is right, as he\r\ngenerally is, when he bids us read not to contradict and refute, nor\r\nto believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but\r\nto weigh and to consider. Yes, let us read to weigh and to consider.\r\nIn the times before us that promise or threaten deep political,\r\neconomical, and social controversy, what we need to do is to induce\r\nour people to weigh and consider. We want them to cultivate energy\r\nwithout impatience, activity without restlessness, inflexibility\r\nwithout ill-humour. I am not going to preach to you any artificial\r\nstoicism. I am not going to preach to you any indifference to money,\r\nor to the pleasures of social intercourse, or to the esteem and\r\ngood-will of our neighbours, or to any other of the consolations and\r\nnecessities of life. But, after all, the thing that matters most, both\r\nfor happiness and for duty, is that we should strive habitually to\r\nlive with wise thoughts and right feelings. Literature helps us more\r\nthan other studies to this most blessed companionship of wise thoughts\r\nand right feelings, and so I have taken this opportunity of earnestly\r\ncommending it to your interest and care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTOR HUGO'S \"NINETY-THREE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"History has its truth, Legend has its truth. Legendary truth is of\r\na different nature from historic truth. Legendary truth is invention\r\nwith reality for result. For the rest, history and legend have the\r\nsame aim--to paint under the man of a day eternal humanity.\" These\r\nwords from his new and latest work (ii. 4) are a repetition of what\r\nVictor Hugo had already said in the introduction to his memorable\r\n_Legend of the Ages_[1]. But the occasion of their application is far\r\nmore delicate. Poetry lends itself naturally to the spacious, distant,\r\nvague, highly generalised way of present and real events. A prose\r\nromance, on the other hand, is of necessity abundant in details, in\r\nspecial circumstances, in particularities of time and place. This\r\nleaves all the more room for historic error, and historic error in\r\na work of imagination dealing with actual and known occurrences is\r\nobviously fatal, not only to legendary truth, but to legendary beauty\r\nand poetic impressiveness. And then the pitfalls which lie about the\r\nfeet of the Frenchman who has to speak of 1793,--the terrible year\r\nof the modern epoch! The delirium of the Terror haunts most of the\r\nrevolutionary historians, and the choicest examples in all literature\r\nof bombast, folly, emptiness, political immorality, inhumanity, formal\r\nrepudiation of common sense and judgment, are to be found in the\r\nrhapsodies which men of letters, some of them men of eminence, call\r\nhistories of the Revolution, or lives of this or that actor in it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The references are to the \"Édition Définitive\" in two\r\nvolumes.]\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a breach, therefore, of one's allegiance to Hugo's\r\nsuperb imaginative genius, if one had misgivings as to the result of\r\nan attempt, even in his strong hands, to combine legend with truth on\r\na disastrous field, in which grave writers with academic solemnity had\r\nconfounded truth with the falsest kind of legend. The theme was so\r\nlikely to emphasise the defects incident to his mighty qualities; so\r\nlikely to provoke an exaggeration of those mannerisms of thought no\r\nless than of phrase, which though never ignoble nor paltry, yet now\r\nand then take something from the loftiness and sincerity of the\r\nwriter's work. Wisdom, however, is justified of her children, and M.\r\nHugo's genius has justified his choice of a difficult and perilous\r\nsubject. _Quatrevingt-treize_ is a monument of its author's finest\r\ngifts; and while those who are happily endowed with the capacity of\r\ntaking delight in nobility and beauty of imaginative work will find\r\nthemselves in possession of a new treasure, the lover of historic\r\ntruth who hates to see abstractions passed off for actualities and\r\nlegend erected in the place of fact escapes with his sensibilities\r\nalmost unwounded.\r\n\r\nThe historic interlude at the beginning of the second volume is\r\nundoubtedly open to criticism from the political student's point of\r\nview. As a sketch of the Convention, the scene of its sittings, the\r\nstormful dramas that were enacted there one after another for month\r\nafter month, the singular men who one after another rode triumphant\r\nupon the whirlwind for a little space, and were then mercilessly in an\r\ninstant swept into outer darkness, the commoner men who cowered before\r\nthe fury of the storm, and were like \"smoke driven hither and thither\r\nby the wind,\" and laboured hard upon a thousand schemes for human\r\nimprovement, some admirable, others mere frenzy, while mobs filed in\r\nand danced mad carmagnoles before them--all this is a magnificent\r\nmasterpiece of accurate, full, and vivid description. To the\r\nphilosophy of it we venture to demur. The mystic, supernatural view of\r\nthe French Revolution, which is so popular among French writers who\r\nobject to the supernatural and the mystical everywhere else, is to us\r\na thing most incredible, most puerile, most mischievous. People talk\r\nof '93, as a Greek tragedian treats the Tale of Troy divine, or the\r\nterrible fortunes of the house of Atreus, as the result of dark\r\ninvincible fate, as the unalterable decree of the immortal gods. Even\r\nVictor Hugo's strong spirit does not quite overcome the demoralising\r\ndoctrine of a certain revolutionary school, though he has the poet's\r\nexcuse. Thus, of the Convention:--\r\n\r\n    \"Minds all a prey to the wind. But this wind was a wind of miracle\r\n    and portent. To be a member of the Convention was to be a wave\r\n    of the ocean. And this was true of its greatest. The force of\r\n    impulsion came from on high. There was in the Convention a will,\r\n    which was the will of all, and yet was the will of no one. It was\r\n    an idea, an idea resistless and without measure, which breathed in\r\n    the shadow from the high heavens. We call that the Revolution. As\r\n    this idea passed, it threw down one and raised up another; it bore\r\n    away this man in the foam, and broke that man to pieces upon the\r\n    rocks. The idea knew whither it went, and drove the gulf of waters\r\n    before it. To impute the Revolution to men is as one who should\r\n    impute the tide to the waves. The revolution is an action of the\r\n    Unknown.... It is a form of the abiding phenomenon that shuts us\r\n    in on every side and that we call Necessity.... In presence\r\n    of these climacteric catastrophes which waste and vivify\r\n    civilisation, one is slow to judge detail. To blame or praise men\r\n    on account of the result, is as if one should blame or praise the\r\n    figures on account of the total. That which must pass passes, the\r\n    storm that must rage rages. The eternal serenity does not suffer\r\n    from these boisterous winds. Above revolutions truth and justice\r\n    abide, as the starry heaven abides above the tempests\" (i.\r\n    188-189).\r\n\r\nAs a lyric passage, full of the breath of inspiration; as history,\r\nsuperficial and untrue; as morality, enervating and antinomian. The\r\nauthor is assuredly far nearer the mark in another place when\r\nhe speaks of \"_that immense improvisation_ which is the French\r\nRevolution\" (ii. 35)--an improvisation of which every step can be\r\nrationally explained.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this is no more than an interlude. Victor Hugo only surveys\r\nthe events of '93 as a field for the growth of types of character. His\r\ninstinct as an artist takes him away from the Paris of '93, where the\r\nconfusion, uproar, human frenzy, leave him no background of nature,\r\nwith nature's fixity, sternness, indifference, sublimity. This he\r\nfound in La Vendée, whose vast forests grow under the pencil of this\r\nmaster of all the more terrible and majestic effects, into a picture\r\nhardly less sombre and mighty in its impressiveness than the memorable\r\nocean pieces of the _Toilers of the Sea_. If the waves are appalling\r\nin their agitation, their thunders, their sterility, the forest is\r\nappalling in its silence, its dimness, its rest, and the invisibleness\r\nof the thousand kinds of life to which it gives a shelter. If the\r\nviolence and calm and mercilessness of the sea penetrated the romance\r\nof eight years ago with transcendent fury, so does the stranger, more\r\nmysterious, and in a sense even the more inhuman life of the forest\r\npenetrate the romance of to-day. From the opening chapter down to the\r\nvery close, even while the interlude takes us for a little while to\r\nthe Paris café where Danton, Robespierre, and Marat sit in angry\r\ncounsel, even while we are on the sea with the royalist Marquis and\r\nHalmalo, the reader is subtly haunted by the great Vendean woods,\r\ntheir profundity, their mystery, their tragic and sinister beauties.\r\n\r\n    \"The forest is barbarous.\r\n\r\n    \"The configuration of the land counsels man in many an act. More\r\n    than we suppose, it is his accomplice. In the presence of certain\r\n    savage landscapes, you are tempted to exonerate man and blame\r\n    creation; you feel a silent challenge and incitement from nature;\r\n    the desert is constantly unwholesome for conscience, especially\r\n    for a conscience without light. Conscience may be a giant; that\r\n    makes a Socrates or a Jesus: it may be a dwarf; that makes an\r\n    Atreus or a Judas. The puny conscience soon turns reptile; the\r\n    twilight thickets, the brambles, the thorns, the marsh waters\r\n    under branches, make for it a fatal haunting place; amid all this\r\n    it undergoes the mysterious infiltration of ill suggestions. The\r\n    optical illusions, the unexplained images, the scaring hour,\r\n    the scaring spot, all throw man into that kind of affright,\r\n    half-religious, half-brutal, which in ordinary times engenders\r\n    superstition, and in epochs of violence, savagery. Hallucinations\r\n    hold the torch that lights the path to murder. There is something\r\n    like vertigo in the brigand. Nature with her prodigies has a\r\n    double effect; she dazzles great minds, and blinds the duller\r\n    soul. When man is ignorant, when the desert offers visions,\r\n    the obscurity of the solitude is added to the obscurity of the\r\n    intelligence; thence in man comes the opening of abysses. Certain\r\n    rocks, certain ravines, certain thickets, certain wild openings\r\n    of the evening sky through the trees, drive man towards mad or\r\n    monstrous exploits. We might almost call some places criminal\"\r\n    (ii. 21).\r\n\r\nWith La Vendée for background, and some savage incidents of the bloody\r\nVendean war for external machinery, Victor Hugo has realised his\r\nconception of '93 in three types of character: Lantenac, the royalist\r\nmarquis; Cimourdain, the puritan turned Jacobin; and Gauvain, for whom\r\none can as yet find no short name, he belonging to the millenarian\r\ntimes. Lantenac, though naturally a less original creation than the\r\nother two, is still an extremely bold and striking figure, drawn with\r\nmarked firmness of hand, and presenting a thoroughly distinct and\r\ncoherent conception. It is a triumph of the poetic or artistic part\r\nof the author's nature over the merely political part, that he should\r\nhave made even his type of the old feudal order which he execrates\r\nso bitterly, a heroic, if ever so little also a diabolic, personage.\r\nThere is everything that is cruel, merciless, unflinching, in\r\nLantenac; there is nothing that is mean or insignificant. A gunner\r\nat sea, by inattention to the lashing of his gun, causes an accident\r\nwhich breaks the ship to pieces, and then he saves the lives of the\r\ncrew by hazarding his own life to secure the wandering monster.\r\nLantenac decorates him with the cross of Saint Lewis for his\r\ngallantry, and instantly afterwards has him shot for his carelessness.\r\nHe burns homesteads and villages, fusillades men and women, and makes\r\nthe war a war without quarter or grace. Yet he is no swashbuckler of\r\nthe melodramatic stage. There is a fine reserve, a brief gravity,\r\nin the delineation of him, his clear will, his quickness, his\r\nintrepidity, his relentlessness, which make of him the incarnation\r\nof aristocratic coldness, hatred, and pride. You might guillotine\r\nLantenac with exquisite satisfaction, and yet he does not make us\r\nashamed of mankind. Into his mouth, as he walks about his dungeon,\r\nimpatiently waiting to be led out to execution, Victor Hugo has put\r\nthe aristocratic view of the Revolution. Some portions of it (ii.\r\n224-226) would fit amazingly well into M. Renan's notions about the\r\nmoral and intellectual reform of France.\r\n\r\nIf the Breton aristocrat of '93 was fearless, intrepid, and without\r\nmercy in defence of God and the King--and his qualities were all\r\nshared, the democrat may love to remember, by the Breton peasant,\r\nwhether peasant follower or peasant leader--the Jacobin was just as\r\nvigorous, as intrepid, as merciless in defence of his Republic. \"Pays,\r\nPatrie,\" says Victor Hugo, in words which perhaps will serve to\r\ndescribe many a future passage in French history, \"ces deux mots\r\nrésument toute la guerre de Vendée; querelle de l'idée locale centre\r\nl'idée universelle; paysans contre patriotes\" (ii. 22).[1] Certainly\r\nthe Jacobins were the patriots of that era, the deliverers of France\r\nfrom something like that process of partition which further east was\r\nconsummated in this very '93. We do not mean the handful of odious\r\nmiscreants who played fool and demon in turns in the insurrectionary\r\nCommune and elsewhere: such men as Collot d'Herbois, or Carrier,\r\nor Panis. The normal Jacobin was a remarkable type. He has been\r\nexcellently described by Louis Blanc as something powerful, original,\r\nsombre; half agitator and half statesman; half puritan and half monk\r\nhalf inquisitor and half tribune. These words of the historian are the\r\nexact prose version of the figure of Cimourdain, the typical Jacobin\r\nof the poet. \"Cimourdain was a pure conscience, but sombre. He had in\r\nhim the absolute. He had been a priest and that is a serious thing.\r\nMan, like the sky, may have a dark serenity; it is enough that\r\nsomething should have brought night into his soul. Priesthood had\r\nbrought night into Cimourdain. He who has been a priest is one still.\r\nWhat brings night upon us may leave the stars with us. Cimourdain\r\nwas full of virtues, full of truths, but they shone in the midst\r\nof darkness\" (i. 123). If the aristocrat had rigidity, so had the\r\nJacobin. \"Cimourdain had the blind certitude of the arrow, which only\r\nsees the mark and makes for it. In revolution, nothing so formidable\r\nas the straight line. Cimourdain strode forward with fatality in his\r\nstep. He believed that in social genesis the very extreme point must\r\nalways be solid ground, an error peculiar to minds that for reason\r\nsubstitute logic\" (i. 127). And so forth, until the character of the\r\nJacobin lives for us with a precision, a fulness, a naturalness, such\r\nas neither Carlyle nor Michelet nor Quinet has been able to clothe it\r\nwith, though these too have the sacred illumination of genius. Victor\r\nHugo's Jacobin is a poetic creation, yet the creation only lies in the\r\nvivid completeness with which the imagination of a great master has\r\nrealised to itself the traits and life of an actual personality. It is\r\nnot that he has any special love for his Jacobin, but that he has the\r\npoet's eye for types, politics apart. He sees how much the aristocrat,\r\nslaying hip and thigh for the King, and the Jacobin, slaying hip and\r\nthigh for the Republic, resembled one another. \"Let us confess,\"\r\nhe says, \"these two men, the Marquis and the priest [Lantenac and\r\nCimourdain], were up to a certain point the self-same man. The bronze\r\nmask of civil war has two profiles, one turned towards the past, the\r\nother towards the future, but as tragic the one as the other. Lantenac\r\nwas the first of these profiles, Cimourdain was the second; only the\r\nbitter rictus of Lantenac was covered with shadow and night, and on\r\nthe fatal brow of Cimourdain was a gleaming of the dawn\" (ii. 91).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In corroboration of this view of the Vendean rising as\r\ndemocratic, see Mortimer-Ternaux, _Hist. de la Terreur_, vol. vi. bk.\r\n30.]\r\n\r\nAnd let us mark Victor Hugo's signal distinction in his analysis\r\nof character. It is not mere vigour of drawing, nor acuteness of\r\nperception, nor fire of imagination, though he has all these gifts in\r\na singular degree, and truest of their kind. But then Scott had\r\nthem too, and yet we feel in Victor Hugo's work a seriousness, a\r\nsignificance, a depth of tone, which never touches us in the work of\r\nhis famous predecessor in romance, delightful as the best of that work\r\nis. Balfour of Burley is one of Scott's most commanding figures, and\r\nthe stern Covenanter is nearly in the same plane of character as the\r\nstern heroic Jacobin. Yet Cimourdain impresses us more profoundly. He\r\nis as natural, as human, as readily conceivable, and yet he produces\r\nsomething of the subtle depth of effect which belongs to the actor in\r\na play of Aeschylus. Why is this? Because Hugo makes us conscious of\r\nthat tragedy of temperament, that sterner Necessity of character,\r\nthat resistless compulsion of circumstance, which is the modern and\r\npositive expression for the old Destiny of the Greeks, and which in\r\nsome expression or other is now an essential element in the highest\r\npresentation of human life. Here is not the Unknown. On the contrary,\r\nwe are in the very heart of science; tragedy to the modern is\r\nnot [Greek: tuchae], but a thing of cause and effect, invariable\r\nantecedent and invariable consequent. It is the presence of this\r\ntragic force underlying action that gives to all Hugo's work its lofty\r\nquality, its breadth, and generality, and fills both it, and us who\r\nread, with pity and gravity and an understanding awe.\r\n\r\nThe action is this. Cimourdain had the young Gauvain to train from his\r\nearliest childhood, and the pupil grew up with the same rigid sense\r\nof duty as the master, though temperament modified its form. When the\r\nRevolution came, Gauvain, though a noble, took sides with the people,\r\nbut he was not of the same spirit as his teacher. \"The Revolution,\"\r\nsays Victor Hugo, \"by the side of youthful figures of giants, such as\r\nDanton, Saint-Just, and Robespierre, has young ideal figures, like\r\nHoche and Marceau. Gauvain was one of these figures\" (ii. 34).\r\nCimourdain has himself named delegate from the Committee of Public\r\nSafety to the expeditionary column of which Gauvain is in command. The\r\nwarmth of affection between them was undiminished, but difference in\r\ntemperament bred difference in their principles. They represented, as\r\nthe author says, with the candour of the poet, the two poles of\r\nthe truth; the two sides of the inarticulate, subterranean, fatal\r\ncontention of the year of the Terror. Their arguments with one another\r\nmake the situation more intelligible to the historic student, as they\r\nmake the characters of the speakers more transparent for the purposes\r\nof the romance.\r\n\r\nThis is Cimourdain:--\r\n\r\n    \"Beware, there are terrible duties in life. Do not accuse what is\r\n    not responsible. Since when has the disorder been the fault of the\r\n    physician? Yes, what marks this tremendous year is being without\r\n    pity. Why? Because it is the great revolutionary year. This year\r\n    incarnates the revolution. The revolution has an enemy, the old\r\n    world, and to that it is pitiless, just as the surgeon has\r\n    an enemy, gangrene, and is pitiless to that. The revolution\r\n    extirpates kingship in the king, aristocracy in the noble,\r\n    despotism in the soldier, superstition in the priest, barbarity in\r\n    the judge, in a word whatever is tyranny in whatever is tyrant.\r\n    The operation is frightful, the revolution performs it with a sure\r\n    hand. As to the quantity of sound flesh that it requires, ask\r\n    Boerhave what he thinks of it. What tumour that has to be cut out\r\n    does not involve loss of blood?... The revolution devotes itself\r\n    to its fated task. It mutilates but it saves.... It has the past\r\n    in its grasp, it will not spare. It makes in civilisation a deep\r\n    incision whence shall come the safety of the human race. You\r\n    suffer? No doubt. How long will it last? The time needed for the\r\n    operation. Then you will live,\" etc. (ii. 65-66).\r\n\r\n\"One day,\" he adds, \"the Revolution will justify the Terror.\" To which\r\nGauvain retorts thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fear lest the Terror be the calumny of the Revolution. Liberty,\r\n    Equality, Fraternity, are dogmas of peace and harmony. Why give\r\n    them an aspect of alarm? What do we seek? To win nations to the\r\n    universal public. Then why inspire fright? Of what avail is\r\n    intimidation? It is wrong to do ill in order to do good. You do\r\n    not pull down the throne to leave the scaffold standing. Let us\r\n    hurl away crowns, let us spare heads. The revolution is concord,\r\n    not affright. Mild ideas are ill-served by men who do not know\r\n    pity. Amnesty is for me the noblest word in human speech. I will\r\n    shed no blood save at hazard of my own.... In the fight let us be\r\n    the enemies of our foes, and after the victory their brothers\"\r\n    (ii. 67).\r\n\r\nThese two together, Cimourdain and Gauvain, make an ideal pair of the\r\nrevolutionists of '93. Strip each of them of the beauty of character\r\nwith which the poet's imagination has endowed them, add instead\r\npassion, violence, envy, egoism, malice; then you understand how in\r\nthe very face of the foreign enemy Girondins sharpened the knife\r\nfor the men of the Mountain, Hébertists screamed for the lives\r\nof Robespierrists, Robespierre struck off the head of Danton,\r\nThermidorians crushed Robespierre.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo has given to this typic historical struggle of '93 the\r\nqualities of nobleness and beauty which art requires in dealing with\r\nreal themes. Lantenac falls into the hands of the Blues, headed by\r\nCimourdain and Gauvain, but he does so in consequence of yielding to a\r\nheroic and self-devoting impulse of humanity. Cimourdain, true to his\r\ntemperament, insists on his instant execution. Gauvain, true also to\r\nhis temperament, is seized with a thousand misgivings, and there is\r\nno more ample, original, and masterly presentation of a case of\r\nconscience, that in civil war is always common enough, than the\r\nstruggle through which Gauvain passes before he can resolve to deliver\r\nLantenac. This pathetic debate--\"the stone of Sisyphus, which is only\r\nthe quarrel of man with himself\"--turns on the loftiest, broadest,\r\nmost generous motives, touching the very bases of character, and\r\nreaching far beyond the issue of '93. The political question is seen\r\nto be no more than a superficial aspect of the deeper moral question.\r\nLantenac, the representative of the old order, had performed an\r\nexploit of signal devotion. Was it not well that one who had faith in\r\nthe new order should show himself equally willing to cast away his\r\nlife to save one whom self-sacrifice had transformed from the infernal\r\nSatan into the heavenly Lucifer?\r\n\r\n    \"Gauvain saw in the shade the sinister smile of the sphinx. The\r\n    situation was a sort of dread crossway where the conflicting\r\n    truths issued and confronted one another, and where the three\r\n    supreme ideas of man stood face to face--humanity, the family, the\r\n    fatherland. Each of the voices spoke in turn, and each in turn\r\n    declared the truth. How choose? Each in turn seemed to hit the\r\n    mark of reason and justice, and said, Do that. Was that the thing\r\n    to be done? Yes. No. Reasoning counselled one thing; sentiment\r\n    another; the two counsels were contradictory. Reasoning is only\r\n    reason; sentiment is often conscience; the one comes from man,\r\n    the other from a loftier source. That is why sentiment has less\r\n    distinctness, and more might. Yet what strength in the severity\r\n    of reason! Gauvain hesitated. His perplexity was so fierce. Two\r\n    abysses opened before him: to destroy the marquis, or to save him.\r\n    Which of these two gulfs was duty?\"\r\n\r\nThe whole scene (ii. 206-219) is a masterpiece of dramatic strength,\r\nsustention, and flexibility--only equalled by the dramatic vivacity of\r\nthe scene in which Cimourdain, sitting as judge, orders the prisoner\r\nto be brought forward, to his horror sees Gauvain instead of Lantenac,\r\nand then proceeds to condemn the man whom he loves best on earth to be\r\ntaken to the guillotine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the story, its sombre tone, the overhanging presence of\r\ndeath in it, are prevented from being oppressive to us by the variety\r\nof minor situation and subordinate character with which the writer has\r\nsurrounded the central figures. No writer living is so consummate a\r\nmaster of landscape, and besides the forest we here have an elaborate\r\nsea-piece, full of the weird, ineffable, menacing suggestion of the\r\nsea in some of her unnumbered moods; and there is a scene of late\r\ntwilight on a high solitary down over the bay of Mont Saint-Michel, to\r\nwhich a reader blessed with sensibility to the subtler impressions of\r\nlandscape will turn again and again, as one visits again and again\r\nsome actual prospect where the eye procures for the inner sense\r\na dream of beauty and the incommensurable. Perhaps the palm for\r\nexquisite workmanship will be popularly given, and justly given, to\r\nthe episode humorously headed _The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew_,\r\nat the opening of the third volume. It is the story of three little\r\nchildren, barely out of infancy, awaking, playing, eating, wondering,\r\nslumbering, in solitude through a summer day in an old tower. As a\r\nrule the attempt to make infancy interesting in literature ends in\r\nmaudlin failure. But at length the painters have found an equal, or\r\nmore than an equal, in an artist whose medium lends itself less easily\r\nthan colour and form to the reproduction of the beauty and life of\r\nchildhood. In his poetry Victor Hugo had already shown his passing\r\nsensibility to the pathos of the beginnings of our life; witness such\r\npieces as _Chose vue un Jour de Printemps, Les Pauvres Gens_, the\r\nwell-known pieces in _L'Année Terrible_, and a hundred other lively\r\ntouches and fragments of finished loveliness and penetrating sympathy.\r\nIn prose it is a more difficult feat to collect the trivial details\r\nwhich make up the life of the tiny human animal into a whole that\r\nshall be impressive, finished, and beautiful. And prose can only\r\ndescribe by details enumerated one by one. This most arduous feat\r\nis accomplished in the children's summer day in the tower, and with\r\nenchanting success. Intensely realistic, yet the picture overflows\r\nwith emotion--not the emotion of the mother, but of the poet. There\r\nis infinite tenderness, pathos, love, but all heightened at once and\r\nstrengthened by the self-control of masculine force. A man writing\r\nabout little ones seems able to place himself outside, and thus to\r\ngain more calmness and freedom of vision than the more passionate\r\ninterest or yearning of women permits to them in this field of art.\r\nNot a detail is spared, yet the whole is full of delight and pity and\r\nhumour. Only one lyric passage is allowed to poetise and accentuate\r\nthe realism of the description. Georgette, some twenty months old,\r\nscrambles from her cradle and prattles to the sunbeam.\r\n\r\n    \"What a bird says in its song, a child says in its prattle. 'Tis\r\n    the same hymn; a hymn indistinct, lisping, profound. The child has\r\n    what the bird has not, the sombre human destiny in front of it.\r\n    Hence the sadness of men as they listen, mingling with the joy of\r\n    the little one as it sings. The sublimest canticle to be heard on\r\n    earth is the stammering of the human soul on the lips of infancy.\r\n    That confused chirruping of a thought, that is as yet no more than\r\n    an instinct, has in it one knows not what sort of artless appeal\r\n    to the eternal justice; or is it a protest uttered on the\r\n    threshold before entering in, a protest meek and poignant? This\r\n    ignorance smiling at the Infinite compromises all creation in the\r\n    lot that shall fall to the weak defenceless being. Ill, if it\r\n    shall come, will be an abuse of confidence.\r\n\r\n    \"The child's murmuring is more and is less than words; there are\r\n    no notes, and yet it is a song; there are no syllables, and yet it\r\n    is a language.... This poor stammering is a compound of what the\r\n    child said when it was an angel, and of what it will say when\r\n    it becomes a man. The cradle has a Yesterday as the grave has a\r\n    Morrow; the Morrow and the Yesterday mingle in that strange cooing\r\n    their twofold mystery....\"\r\n\r\n    \"Her lips smiled, her eyes smiled, the dimples in her cheeks\r\n    smiled. There came forth in this smile a mysterious welcome of the\r\n    morning. The soul has faith in the ray. The heavens were blue,\r\n    warm was the air. The fragile creature, without knowing anything,\r\n    or recognising anything, or understanding anything, softly\r\n    floating in musings which are not thought, felt itself in safety\r\n    in the midst of nature, among those good trees and that guileless\r\n    greenery, in the pure and peaceful landscape, amid the rustle of\r\n    nests, of flowing springs, of insects, of leaves, while over all\r\n    there glowed the great innocency of the sun\" (ii. 104).\r\n\r\nAs an eminent man has recently written about Wordsworth's most famous\r\nOde, there may be some bad philosophy here, but there is assuredly\r\nsome noble and touching poetry.\r\n\r\nIf the carelessness of infancy is caught with this perfection of\r\nfinish, there is a tragic companion piece in the horror and gnawing\r\nanguish of the wretched woman from whom her young have been taken--her\r\nrescue from death, her fierce yearnings for them like the yearnings of\r\na beast, her brute-like heedlessness of her life and her body in the\r\ncruel search.\r\n\r\nAnd so the poet conducts us along the strange excursive windings of\r\nthe life and passion of humanity. The same hand which draws such noble\r\nfigures as Gauvain--and the real Lanjuinais of history was fully as\r\nheroic and as noble as the imaginary Gauvain of fiction--is equally\r\nskilful in drawing the wild Breton beggar who dwells underground among\r\nthe branching tree-roots; and the monstrous Imânus, the barbarous\r\nretainer of the Lord of the Seven Forests; and Radoub, the serjeant\r\nfrom Paris, a man of hearty oaths, hideous, heroic, humoursome, of\r\na bloody ingenuity in combat. And the same hand which described the\r\nsilent sundown on the sandy shore of the bay, and the mysterious\r\ndarkness of the forests, and the blameless play of the little ones,\r\ngives us the prodigious animation of the night surprise at Dôl, the\r\nfurious conflict at La Tourgue, and, perhaps most powerful of all, the\r\nbreaking loose of the gun on the deck of the _Claymore_. You may say\r\nthat this is only melodrama; but if we turn to the actual events of\r\n'93, the melodrama of the romancer will seem tame compared with the\r\nmelodrama of the faithful chronicler. And so long as the narrative\r\nof melodramatic action is filled with poetry and beauty, there is no\r\nreproach in uncommon situation, in intense passion, in magnanimous or\r\nsubtle motives that are not of every day. Of Hugo's art we may say\r\nwhat Dr. Newman has said of something else: _Such work is always open\r\nto criticism and it is always above it_.\r\n\r\nThere is poetry and beauty, no doubt, in the common lives about us, if\r\nwe look at them with imaginative and sympathetic eye, and we owe much\r\nto the art that reveals to us the tragedy of the parlour and the\r\nfrockcoat, and analyses the bitterness and sorrow and high passion\r\nthat may underlie a life of outer smoothness and decorum. Still,\r\ncriticism cannot accept this as the final and exclusive limitation of\r\nimaginative work. Art is nothing if not catholic and many-sided, and\r\nit is certainly not exhausted by mere domestic possibilities. Goethe's\r\nfine and luminous feeling for practical life, which has given such\r\ndepth of richness and wisdom to his best prose writing, fills us with\r\na delightful sense of satisfaction and adequateness; and yet why\r\nshould it not leave us with a mind eagerly open for the larger and\r\nmore inventive romance, in which nature is clothed with some of that\r\nawe and might and silent contemplation of the puny destinies of man,\r\nthat used to surround the conception of the supernatural? Victor Hugo\r\nseeks strong and extraordinary effects; he is a master of terrible\r\nimage, profound emotion, audacious fancy; but then these are as real,\r\nas natural, as true to fact, as the fairest reproduction of the moral\r\npoverties and meannesses of the world. And let it be added that while\r\nhe is without a rival in the dark mysterious heights of imaginative\r\neffect, he is equally a master in strokes of tenderness and the most\r\ndelicate human sympathy. His last book seems to contain pieces that\r\nsurpass every other book of Hugo's in the latter range of qualities,\r\nand not to fall at all short in the former. And so, in the words of\r\nthe man of genius who last wrote on Victor Hugo in these pages,[1]\r\n\"As we pity ourselves for the loss of poems and pictures which have\r\nperished, and left of Sappho but a fragment and of Zeuxis but a name,\r\nso are we inclined to pity the dead who died too soon to enjoy the\r\ngreat works we have enjoyed. At each new glory that 'swims into our\r\nken,' we surely feel that it is something to have lived to see that\r\ntoo rise.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Swinburne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON \"THE RING AND THE BOOK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first volume of Mr. Browning's new poem came before the\r\ncritical tribunals, public and private, recognised or irresponsible,\r\nthere was much lamentation even in quarters where a manlier humour\r\nmight have been expected, over the poet's choice of a subject. With\r\nfacile largeness of censure, it was pronounced a murky subject,\r\nsordid, unlovely, morally sterile, an ugly leaf out of some ancient\r\nItalian Newgate Calendar. One hinted in vain that wisdom is justified\r\nof her children, that the poet must be trusted to judge of the\r\ncapacity of his own theme, and that it is his conception and treatment\r\nof it that ultimately justify or discredit his choice. Now that the\r\nentire work is before the world, this is plain, and it is admitted.\r\nWhen the second volume, containing _Giuseppe Caponsacchi_, appeared,\r\nmen no longer found it sordid or ugly; the third, with _Pompilia_,\r\nconvinced them that the subject was not, after all, so incurably\r\nunlovely; and the fourth, with _The Pope_, and the passage from the\r\nFriar's sermon, may well persuade those who needed persuasion, that\r\nmoral fruitfulness depends on the master, his eye and hand, his vision\r\nand grasp, more than on this and that in the transaction which has\r\ntaken possession of his imagination.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, we have for long been so debilitated by pastorals, by\r\ngraceful presentation of the Arthurian legend for drawing-rooms, by\r\nidylls, not robust and Theocritean, by verse directly didactic, that a\r\nrude blast of air from the outside welter of human realities is apt\r\nto give a shock, that might well show in what simpleton's paradise\r\nwe have been living. The ethics of the rectory parlour set to sweet\r\nmusic, the respectable aspirations of the sentimental curate married\r\nto exquisite verse, the everlasting glorification of domestic\r\nsentiment in blameless princes and others, as if that were the poet's\r\nsingle province and the divinely-appointed end of all art, as if\r\ndomestic sentiment included and summed up the whole throng of\r\npassions, emotions, strife, and desire; all this might seem to be\r\nmaking valetudinarians of us all. Our public is beginning to measure\r\nthe right and possible in art by the superficial probabilities of life\r\nand manners within a ten-mile radius of Charing Cross. Is it likely,\r\nasks the critic, that Duke Silva would have done this, that Fedalma\r\nwould have done that? Who shall suppose it possible that Caponsacchi\r\nacted thus, that Count Guido was possessed by devils so? The poser\r\nis triumphant, because the critic is tacitly appealing to the normal\r\nstandard of probabilities in our own day. In the tragedy of Pompilia\r\nwe are taken far from the serene and homely region in which some of\r\nour teachers would fain have it that the whole moral universe can be\r\nsnugly pent up. We see the black passions of man at their blackest;\r\nhate, so fierce, undiluted, implacable, passionate, as to be hard of\r\nconception by our simpler northern natures; cruelty, so vindictive,\r\nsubtle, persistent, deadly, as to fill us with a pain almost too great\r\nfor true art to produce; greediness, lust, craft, penetrating a whole\r\nstock and breed, even down to the ancient mother of \"that fell house\r\nof hate,\"--\r\n\r\n  \"The gaunt grey nightmare in the furthest smoke,\r\n  The hag that gave these three abortions birth,\r\n  Unmotherly mother and unwomanly\r\n  Woman, that near turns motherhood to shame,\r\n  Womanliness to loathing: no one word,\r\n  No gesture to curb cruelty a whit\r\n  More than the she-pard thwarts her playsome whelps\r\n  Trying their milk-teeth on the soft o' the throat\r\n  O' the first fawn, flung, with those beseeching eyes,\r\n  Flat in the covert! How should she but couch,\r\n  Lick the dry lips, unsheathe the blunted claw,\r\n  Catch 'twixt her placid eyewinks at what chance\r\n  Old bloody half-forgotten dream may flit,\r\n  Born when herself was novice to the taste,\r\n  The while she lets youth take its pleasure\" (iv. 40).\r\n\r\nBut, then, if the poet has lighted up for us these grim and appalling\r\ndepths, he has not failed to raise us too into the presence of\r\nproportionate loftiness and purity.\r\n\r\n               \"Tantum vertice in auras\r\n  Aetherias quantum radice in Tartara tendit.\"\r\n\r\nLike the gloomy and umbrageous grove of which the Sibyl spake to the\r\npious Aeneas, the poem conceals a golden branch and golden leaves.\r\nIn the second volume, Guido, servile and false, is followed by\r\nCaponsacchi, as noble alike in conception and execution as anything\r\nthat Mr. Browning has ever achieved. In the third volume, the austere\r\npathos of Pompilia's tale relieves the too oppressive jollity of Don\r\nGiacinto, and the flowery rhetoric of Bottini; while in the fourth,\r\nthe deep wisdom, justice, and righteous mind of the Pope, reconcile\r\nus to endure the sulphurous whiff from the pit in the confession of\r\nGuido, now desperate, naked, and satanic. From what at first was sheer\r\nmurk, there comes out a long procession of human figures, infinitely\r\nvarious in form and thought, in character and act; a group of men and\r\nwomen, eager, passionate, indifferent; tender and ravenous, mean and\r\nnoble, humorous and profound, jovial with prosperity or half-dumb with\r\nmisery, skirting the central tragedy, or plunged deep into the thick\r\nof it, passers-by who put themselves off with a glance at the surface\r\nof a thing, and another or two who dive to the heart of it. And\r\nthey all come out with a certain Shakespearian fulness, vividness,\r\ndirectness. Above all, they are every one of them men and women,\r\nwith free play of human life in limb and feature, as in an antique\r\nsculpture. So much of modern art, in poetry as in painting, runs to\r\nmere drapery. \"I grant,\" said Lessing, \"that there is also a beauty in\r\ndrapery, but can it be compared with that of the human form? And shall\r\nhe who can attain to the greater, rest content with the less? I much\r\nfear that the most perfect master in drapery shows by that very talent\r\nwherein his weakness lies.\" This was spoken of plastic art, but it has\r\na yet deeper meaning in poetic criticism. There too, the master is he\r\nwho presents the natural shape, the curves, the thews of men, and does\r\nnot labour and seek praise for faithful reproduction of the mere moral\r\ndrapery of the hour, this or another; who gives you Hercules at strife\r\nwith Antaeus, Laocoon writhing in the coils of the divine serpents,\r\nthe wrestle with circumstance or passion, with outward destiny or\r\ninner character, in the free outlines of nature and reality. The\r\ncapacity which it possesses for this presentation, at once so varied\r\nand so direct, is one reason why the dramatic form ranks as the\r\nhighest expression and measure of the creative power of the poet; and\r\nthe extraordinary grasp with which Mr. Browning has availed himself of\r\nthis double capacity is one reason why we should reckon _The Ring and\r\nthe Book_ as one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nWe may say this, and still not be blind to the faults of the poem.\r\nMany persons agree that they find it too long, and if they find it so,\r\nthen for them it is too long. Others, who cannot resist the critic's\r\ntemptation of believing that a remark must be true if it only look\r\nacute and specific, vow that the disclosure in the first volume of the\r\nwhole plan and plot vitiates subsequent artistic merit. If one\r\ncannot enjoy what comes, for knowing beforehand what is coming, this\r\nobjection may be allowed to have a root in human nature; but then two\r\nthings might perhaps be urged on the other side,--first, that the\r\ninterest of the poem lies in the development and presentation of\r\ncharacter, on the one hand, and in the many sides which a single\r\ntransaction offered to as many minds, on the other; and therefore that\r\nthis true interest could not be marred by the bare statement what the\r\ntransaction was or, baldly looked at, seemed to be; and, second, that\r\nthe poem was meant to find its reader in a mood of mental repose,\r\nready to receive the poet's impressions, undisturbed by any agitating\r\ncuriosity as to plot or final outcome. A more valid accusation touches\r\nthe many verbal perversities, in which a poet has less right than\r\nanother to indulge. The compound Latin and English of Don Giacinto,\r\nnotwithstanding the fan of the piece, still grows a burden to the\r\nflesh. Then there are harsh and formless lines, bursts of metrical\r\nchaos, from which a writer's dignity and self-respect ought surely\r\nto be enough to preserve him. Again, there are passages marked by a\r\ncoarse violence of expression that is nothing short of barbarous (for\r\ninstance, ii. 190, or 245). The only thing to be said is, that the\r\ncountrymen of Shakespeare have had to learn to forgive uncouth\r\noutrages on form and beauty to fine creative genius. If only one could\r\nbe sure that readers, unschooled as too many are to love the simple\r\nand elevated beauty of such form as Sophocles or as Corneille gives,\r\nwould not think the worst fault the chief virtue, and confound the\r\npoet's bluntnesses with his admirable originality. It is certain that\r\nin Shakespeare's case his defects are constantly fastened upon, by\r\ncritics who have never seriously studied the forms of dramatic art\r\nexcept in the literature of England, and extolled as instances of\r\nhis characteristic mightiness. It may well be, therefore, that the\r\ngrotesque caprices which Mr. Browning unfortunately permits to himself\r\nmay find misguided admirers, or, what is worse, even imitators. It\r\nwould be most unjust, however, while making due mention of these\r\nthings, to pass over the dignity and splendour of the verse in\r\nmany places, where the intensity of the writer's mood finds worthy\r\nembodiment in a sustained gravity and vigour and finish of diction not\r\nto be surpassed. The concluding lines of the _Caponsacchi_ (comprising\r\nthe last page of the second volume), the appeal of the Greek poet in\r\n_The Pope_, one or two passages in the first _Guido_ (e.g. vol. ii.,\r\np. 156, from line 1957), and the close of the _Pompilia_, ought to be\r\nreferred to when one wishes to know what power over the instrument\r\nof his art Mr. Browning might have achieved, if he had chosen to\r\ndiscipline himself in instrumentation.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said that can be said about the violences which from\r\ntime to time invade the poem, it remains true that the complete work\r\naffects the reader most powerfully with that wide unity of impression\r\nwhich it is the highest aim of dramatic art, and perhaps of all art,\r\nto produce. After we have listened to all the whimsical dogmatising\r\nabout beauty, to all the odious cant about morbid anatomy, to all the\r\nwell-deserved reproach for unpardonable perversities of phrase and\r\noutrages on rhythm, there is left to us the consciousness that a\r\nstriking human transaction has been seized by a vigorous and profound\r\nimagination, that its many diverse threads have been wrought into a\r\nsingle, rich, and many-coloured web of art, in which we may see traced\r\nfor us the labyrinths of passion and indifference, stupidity and\r\ncraft, prejudice and chance, along which truth and justice have to\r\nfind a devious and doubtful way. The transaction itself, lurid\r\nand fuliginous, is secondary to the manner of its handling and\r\npresentment. We do not derive our sense of unity from the singleness\r\nand completeness of the horrid tragedy, so much as from the power\r\nwith which its own circumstances as they happened, the rumours which\r\nclustered about it from the minds of men without, the many moods,\r\nfancies, dispositions, which it for the moment brought out into light,\r\nplaying round the fact, the half-sportive flights with which lawyers,\r\njudges, quidnuncs of the street, darted at conviction and snatched\r\nhap-hazard at truth, are all wrought together into one self-sufficient\r\nand compacted shape.\r\n\r\nBut this shape is not beautiful, and the end of art is beauty? Verbal\r\nfanaticism is always perplexing, and, rubbing my eyes, I ask whether\r\nthat beauty means anything more than such an arrangement and\r\ndisposition of the parts of the work as, first kindling a great\r\nvariety of dispersed emotions and thoughts in the mind of the\r\nspectator, finally concentrates them in a single mood of joyous, sad,\r\nmeditative, or interested delight. The sculptor, the painter, and the\r\nmusician, have each their special means of producing this final\r\nand superlative impression; each is bound by the strictly limited\r\ncapability in one direction and another of the medium in which he\r\nworks. In poetry it is because they do not perceive how much more\r\nmanifold and varied are the means of reaching the end than in the\r\nother expressions of art, that people insist each upon some particular\r\nquiddity which, entering into composition, alone constitutes it\r\ngenuinely poetic, beautiful, or artistic. Pressing for definition, you\r\nnever get much further than that each given quiddity means a certain\r\nWhatness. This is why poetical criticism is usually so little\r\ncatholic. A man remembers that a poem in one style has filled him with\r\nconsciousness of beauty and delight. Why conclude that this style\r\nconstitutes the one access to the same impression? Why not rather\r\nperceive that, to take contemporaries, the beauty of _Thyrsis_ Is\r\nmainly produced by a fine suffusion of delicately-toned emotion; that\r\nof _Atalanta_ by splendid and barely rivalled music of verse; of _In\r\nMemoriam_ by its ordered and harmonious presentation of a sacred mood;\r\nof the _Spanish Gypsy_, in the parts where it reaches beauty, by\r\na sublime ethical passion; of the _Earthly Paradise_, by sweet and\r\nsimple reproduction of the spirit of the younger-hearted times? There\r\nare poems by Mr. Browning in which it is difficult, or, let us frankly\r\nsay, impossible, for most of us at all events and as yet, to discover\r\nthe beauty or the shape. But if beauty may not be denied to a work\r\nwhich, abounding in many-coloured scenes and diverse characters, in\r\nvivid image and portraiture, wide reflection and multiform emotion,\r\ndoes further, by a broad thread of thought running under all, bind\r\nthese impressions into one supreme and elevated conviction, then\r\nassuredly, whatever we may think of this passage or that, that episode\r\nor the other, the first volume or the third, we cannot deny that _The\r\nRing and the Book_, in its perfection and integrity, fully satisfies\r\nthe conditions of artistic triumph. Are we to ignore the grandeur of\r\na colossal statue, and the nobility of the human conceptions which it\r\nembodies, because here and there we notice a flaw in the marble, a\r\nblemish in its colour, a jagged slip of the chisel? \"It is not force\r\nof intellect,\" as George Eliot has said, \"which causes ready repulsion\r\nfrom the aberration and eccentricities of greatness, any more than it\r\nis force of vision that causes the eye to explore the warts in a\r\nface bright with human expression; it is simply the negation of high\r\nsensibilities.\"\r\n\r\nThen, it is asked by persons of another and still more rigorous\r\ntemper, whether, as the world goes, the subject, or its treatment\r\neither, justifies us in reading some twenty-one thousand and\r\nseventy-five lines, which do not seem to have any direct tendency to\r\nmake us better or to improve mankind. This objection is an old enemy\r\nwith a new face, and need not detain us, though perhaps the crude\r\nand incessant application of a narrow moral standard, thoroughly\r\nmisunderstood, is one of the intellectual dangers of our time. You may\r\nnow and again hear a man of really masculine character confess that\r\nthough he loves Shakespeare and takes habitual delight in his works,\r\nhe cannot see that he was a particularly moral writer. That is to say,\r\nShakespeare is never directly didactic; you can no more get a system\r\nof morals out of his writings than you can get such a system out\r\nof the writings of the ever-searching Plato. But, if we must be\r\nquantitative, one great creative poet probably exerts a nobler,\r\ndeeper, more permanent ethical influence than a dozen generations of\r\nprofessed moral teachers. It is a commonplace to the wise, and an\r\neverlasting puzzle to the foolish, that direct inculcation of morals\r\nshould invariably prove so powerless an instrument, so futile a\r\nmethod. The truth is that nothing can be more powerfully efficacious\r\nfrom the moral point of view than the exercise of an exalted creative\r\nart, stirring within the intelligence of the spectator active thought\r\nand curiosity about many types of character and many changeful issues\r\nof conduct and fortune, at once enlarging and elevating the range of\r\nhis reflections on mankind, ever kindling his sympathies into the warm\r\nand continuous glow which purifies and strengthens nature, and fills\r\nmen with that love of humanity which is the best inspirer of virtue.\r\nIs not this why music, too, is to be counted supreme among moral\r\nagents, soothing disorderly passion by diving down into the hidden\r\ndeeps of character where there is no disorder, and touching the\r\ndiviner mind? Given a certain rectitude as well as vigour of\r\nintelligence, then whatever stimulates the fancy, expands the\r\nimagination, enlivens meditation upon the great human drama, is\r\nessentially moral. Shakespeare does all this, as if sent Iris-like\r\nfrom the immortal gods, and _The Ring and the Book_ has a measure of\r\nthe same incomparable quality.\r\n\r\nA profound and moving irony subsists in the very structure of the\r\npoem. Any other human transaction that ever was, tragic or comic or\r\nplain prosaic, may be looked at in a like spirit, As the world's talk\r\nbubbled around the dumb anguish of Pompilia, or the cruelty and hate\r\nof Guido, so it does around the hourly tragedies of all times and\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n  \"The instinctive theorizing whence a fact\r\n  Looks to the eye as the eye likes the look.\"--\r\n  \"Vibrations in the general mind\r\n  At depth of deed already out of reach.\"--\r\n                 \"Live fact deadened down,\r\n  Talked over, bruited abroad, whispered away:\"--\r\n\r\nif we reflect that these are the conditions which have marked the\r\nformation of all the judgments that we hold by, and which are vivid in\r\noperation and effect at this hour, the deep irony and the impressive\r\nmeaning of the poem are both obvious:--\r\n\r\n                 \"So learn one lesson hence\r\n  Of many which whatever lives should teach,\r\n  This lesson that our human speech is naught,\r\n  Our human testimony false, our fame\r\n  And human estimation words and wind\" (iv. 234).\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Mr. Browning that he thus casts the moral of\r\nhis piece in an essentially intellectual rather than an emotional\r\nform, appealing to hard judgment rather than to imaginative\r\nsensibility. Another living poet of original genius, of whom we have\r\nmuch right to complain that he gives us so little, ends a poem in two\r\nor three lines which are worth quoting here for the illustration they\r\nafford of what has just been said about Mr. Browning:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, what dusty answer gets the soul,\r\n  When hot for certainties in this our life!--\r\n  In tragic hints here see what evermore\r\n  Moves dark as yonder midnight ocean's force,\r\n  Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse,\r\n  To throw that faint thin line upon the shore?\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. George Meredith's _Modern Love_.]\r\n\r\nThis is imaginative and sympathetic in thought as well as expression,\r\nand the truth and the image enter the writer's mind together, the one\r\nby the other. The lines convey poetic sentiment rather than reasoned\r\ntruth; while Mr. Browning's close would be no unfit epilogue to a\r\nscientific essay on history, or a treatise on the errors of the human\r\nunderstanding and the inaccuracy of human opinion and judgment. This\r\nis the common note of his highest work; hard thought and reason\r\nillustrating themselves in dramatic circumstance, and the thought\r\nand reason are not wholly fused, they exist apart and irradiate with\r\nfar-shooting beams the moral confusion of the tragedy. This is, at any\r\nrate, emphatically true of _The Ring and the Book_. The fulness\r\nand variety of creation, the amplitude of the play and shifting of\r\ncharacters and motive and mood, are absolutely unforced, absolutely\r\nuninterfered with by the artificial exigencies of ethical or\r\nphilosophic purpose. There is the purpose, full-grown, clear in\r\noutline, unmistakeable in significance. But the just proprieties of\r\nplace and season are rigorously observed, because Mr. Browning, like\r\nevery other poet of his quality, has exuberant and adequate delight in\r\nmere creation, simple presentment, and returns to bethink him of the\r\nmeaning of it all only by-and-by. The pictures of Guido, of Pompilia,\r\nof Caponsacchi, of Dominus Hyacinthus de Archangelis, of Pope\r\nInnocent, are each of them full and adequate, as conceptions of\r\ncharacter in active manifestation apart from the truth which the whole\r\ncomposition is meant to illustrate, and which clothes itself in this\r\nmost excellent drama.\r\n\r\nThe scientific attitude of the intelligence is almost as markedly\r\nvisible in Mr. Browning as the strength of his creative power. The\r\nlesson of _The Ring and the Book_ is perhaps as nearly positive as\r\nanything poetic can be. It is true that ultimately the drama ends in\r\na vindication of what are called the ways of God to man, if indeed\r\npeople are willing to put themselves off with a form of omnipotent\r\njustice which is simply a partial retribution inflicted on the\r\nmonster, while torture and butchery fall upon victims more or\r\nless absolutely blameless. As if the fact of punishment at length\r\novertaking the guilty Franceschini were any vindication of the justice\r\nof that assumed Providence, which had for so long a time awarded\r\npunishment far more harsh to the innocent Pompilia. So far as you\r\ncan be content with the vindication of a justice of this less than\r\nequivocal quality, the sight of the monster brought to the\r\n\r\n                             \"Close fetid cell,\r\n  Where the hot vapour of an agony,\r\n  Struck into drops on the cold wall, runs down\r\n  Horrible worms made out of sweat and tears,\"--\r\n\r\nmay in a sense prove satisfactory enough. But a man must be very dull\r\nwho in reading the poem does not perceive that the very spirit of it\r\npoints to the thousand hazards which even this fragment of justice had\r\nto run in saving itself, and bringing about such partially righteous\r\nconsummation as destiny permits. True opinion fares yet more\r\nperilously. _Half-Rome_, the _Other Half-Rome_, the _Tertium Quid_,\r\nwhich is perhaps most masterly and finished of the three, show us\r\nhow ill truth sifts itself, to how many it never comes at all, how\r\nblurred, confused, next door to false, it is figured even to those who\r\nseize it by the hem of the garment. We may, perhaps, yawn over the\r\nintermingled Latin and law of Arcangeli, in spite of the humour of\r\nparts of it, as well as over the vapid floweriness of his rival; but\r\nfor all that, we are touched keenly by the irony of the methods by\r\nwhich the two professional truth-sifters darken counsel with words,\r\nand make skilful sport of life and fact. The whole poem is a parable\r\nof the feeble and half-hopeless struggle which truth has to make\r\nagainst the ways of the world. That in this particular case truth and\r\njustice did win some pale sort of victory does not weaken the force\r\nof the lesson. The victory was such and so won as to stir in us awful\r\nthoughts of fatal risks and certain defeats, of falsehood a thousand\r\ntimes clasped for truth, of fact a thousand times banished for\r\nfancy:--\r\n\r\n  \"Because Pompilia's purity prevails,\r\n  Conclude you, all truth triumphs in the end?\r\n  So might those old inhabitants of the ark,\r\n  Witnessing haply their dove's safe return,\r\n  Pronounce there was no danger all the while\r\n  O' the deluge, to the creature's counterparts,\r\n  Aught that beat wing i' the world, was white or soft,\r\n  And that the lark, the thrush, the culver too,\r\n  Might equally have traversed air, found earth,\r\n  And brought back olive-branch In unharmed bill.\r\n  Methinks I hear the Patriarch's warning voice--\r\n  'Though this one breast, by miracle, return,\r\n  No wave rolls by, in all the waste, but bears\r\n  Within it some dead dove-like thing as dear,\r\n  Beauty made blank and harmlessness destroyed!'\"\r\n\r\n  (iv. 218).\r\n\r\nOr, to take another simile from the same magnificent passage, in which\r\nthe fine dignity of the verse fitly matches the deep truth of the\r\npreacher's monitions:--\r\n\r\n  \"Romans! An elder race possessed your land\r\n  Long ago, and a false faith lingered still,\r\n  As shades do, though the morning-star be out.\r\n  Doubtless, some pagan of the twilight day\r\n  Has often pointed to a cavern-mouth,\r\n  Obnoxious to beholders, hard by Rome,\r\n  And said,--nor he a bad man, no, nor fool,--\r\n  Only a man, so, blind like all his mates,--\r\n  'Here skulk in safety, lurk, defying law,\r\n  The devotees to execrable creed,\r\n  Adoring--with what culture ... Jove, avert\r\n  Thy vengeance from us worshippers of thee!...\r\n  What rites obscene--their idol-god, an Ass!'\r\n  So went the word forth, so acceptance found,\r\n  So century re-echoed century,\r\n  Cursed the accursed,--and so, from sire to son,\r\n  You Romans cried, 'The offscourings of our race\r\n  Corrupt within the depths there: fitly, fiends\r\n  Perform a temple-service o'er the dead:\r\n  Child, gather garment round thee, pass nor pry!'\r\n  So groaned your generations: till the time\r\n  Grew ripe, and lightning hath revealed, belike,--\r\n  Thro' crevice peeped into by curious fear,--\r\n  Some object even fear could recognise\r\n  I' the place of spectres; on the illumined wall,\r\n  To-wit, some nook, tradition talks about,\r\n  Narrow and short, a corpse's length, no more:\r\n  And by it, in the due receptacle,\r\n  The little rude brown lamp of earthenware,\r\n  The cruse, was meant for flowers, but held the blood,\r\n  The rough-scratched palm-branch, and the legend left\r\n  _Pro Christo_. Then the mystery lay clear:\r\n  The abhorred one was a martyr all the time,\r\n  A saint whereof earth was not worthy. What?\r\n  Do you continue in the old belief?\r\n  Where blackness bides unbroke, must devils be?\r\n  Is it so certain, not another cell\r\n  O' the myriad that make up the catacomb,\r\n  Contains some saint a second flash would show?\r\n  Will you ascend into the light of day\r\n  And, having recognised a martyr's shrine,\r\n  Go join the votaries that gape around\r\n  Each vulgar god that awes the market-place?\"\r\n  (iv. 219).\r\n\r\nWith less impetuosity and a more weightily reasoned argument the Pope\r\nconfronts the long perplexity and entanglement of circumstances with\r\nthe fatuous optimism which insists that somehow justice and virtue do\r\nrule in the world. Consider all the doings at Arezzo, before and after\r\nthe consummation of the tragedy. What of the Aretine archbishop, to\r\nwhom Pompilia cried \"Protect me from the fiend!\"--\r\n\r\n  \"No, for thy Guido is one heady, strong,\r\n  Dangerous to disquiet; let him bide!\r\n  He needs some bone to mumble, help amuse\r\n  The darkness of his den with; so, the fawn\r\n  Which limps up bleeding to my foot and lies,\r\n  --Come to me, daughter,--thus I throw him back!\"\r\n\r\nThen the monk to whom she went, imploring him to write to Rome:--\r\n\r\n  \"He meets the first cold sprinkle of the world\r\n  And shudders to the marrow, 'Save this child?\r\n  Oh, my superiors, oh, the Archbishop here!\r\n  Who was it dared lay hand upon the ark\r\n  His betters saw fall nor put finger forth?'\"\r\n\r\nWorst of all, the Convent of the Convertites, women to whom she was\r\nconsigned for help,\r\n\r\n  \"They do help; they are prompt to testify\r\n  To her pure life and saintly dying days.\r\n  She dies, and lo, who seemed so poor, proves rich!\r\n  What does the body that lives through helpfulness\r\n  To women for Christ's sake? The kiss turns bite,\r\n  The dove's note changes to the crow's cry: judge!\r\n    'Seeing that this our Convent claims of right\r\n  What goods belong to those we succour, be\r\n  The same proved women of dishonest life,--\r\n  And seeing that this Trial made appear\r\n  Pompilia was in such predicament,--\r\n  The Convent hereupon pretends to said\r\n  Succession of Pompilia, issues writ,\r\n  And takes possession by the Fisc's advice.'\r\n  Such is their attestation to the cause\r\n  Of Christ, who had one saint at least, they hoped:\r\n  But, is a title-deed to filch, a corpse\r\n  To slander, and an infant-heir to cheat?\r\n  Christ must give up his gains then! They unsay\r\n  All the fine speeches,--who was saint is whore.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful if his review of all the mean and dolorous\r\ncircumstance of this cycle of wrong brings the Pope face to face with\r\nthe unconquerable problem for the Christian believer, the keystone\r\nof the grim arch of religious doubt and despair, through which the\r\ncourageous soul must needs pass to creeds of reason and life. Where is\r\n\"the gloriously decisive change, the immeasurable metamorphosis\" in\r\nhuman worth that should in some sort justify the consummate price that\r\nhad been paid for man these seventeen hundred years before?\r\n\r\n  \"Had a mere adept of the Rosy Cross\r\n  Spent his life to consummate the Great Work,\r\n  Would not we start to see the stuff it touched\r\n  Yield not a grain more than the vulgar got\r\n  By the old smelting-process years ago?\r\n  If this were sad to see in just the sage\r\n  Who should profess so much, perform no more,\r\n  What is it when suspected in that Power\r\n  Who undertook to make and made the world,\r\n  Devised and did effect man, body and soul,\r\n  Ordained salvation for them both, and yet ...\r\n  Well, is the thing we see, salvation?\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain that by whatever other deficiencies it may be marked\r\n_The Ring and the Book_ is blameless for the most characteristic of\r\nall the shortcomings of contemporary verse, a grievous sterility of\r\nthought. And why? Because sterility of thought is the blight struck\r\ninto the minds of men by timorous and halt-footed scepticism, by a\r\nhalf-hearted dread of what chill thing the truth might prove itself,\r\nby unmanly reluctance or moral incapacity to carry the faculty of\r\npoetic vision over the whole field; and because Mr. Browning's\r\nintelligence, on the other hand, is masculine and courageous, moving\r\ncheerfully on the solid earth of an articulate and defined conviction,\r\nand careful not to omit realities from the conception of the great\r\ndrama, merely for being unsightly to the too fastidious eye,\r\nor jarring in the ear, or too bitterly perplexing to faith or\r\nunderstanding. It is this resolute feeling after and grip of fact\r\nwhich is at the root of his distinguishing fruitfulness of thought,\r\nand it is exuberance of thought, spontaneous, well-marked, and sapid,\r\nthat keeps him out of poetical preaching, on the one hand, and mere\r\nmaking of music, on the other. Regret as we may the fantastic rudeness\r\nand unscrupulous barbarisms into which Mr. Browning's art too often\r\nfalls, and find what fault we may with his method, let us ever\r\nremember how much he has to say, and how effectively he communicates\r\nthe shock of new thought which was first imparted to him by the\r\nvivid conception of a large and far-reaching story. The value of the\r\nthought, indeed, is not to be measured by poetic tests; but still the\r\nthought has poetic value, too, for it is this which has stirred in the\r\nwriter that keen yet impersonal interest in the actors of his story\r\nand in its situations which is one of the most certain notes of\r\ntrue dramatic feeling, and which therefore gives the most unfailing\r\nstimulus to the interest of the appreciative reader.\r\n\r\nAt first sight _The Ring and the Book_ appears to be absolutely wanting\r\nin that grandeur which, in a composition of such enormous length,\r\ncriticism must pronounce to be a fundamental and indispensable element.\r\nIn an ordinary way this effect of grandeur is produced either by some\r\nheroic action surrounded by circumstances of worthy stateliness, as in\r\nthe finest of the Greek plays; or as in _Paradise Lost_ by the presence\r\nof personages of majestic sublimity of bearing and association; or as in\r\n_Faust_ or _Hamlet_ by the stupendous moral abysses which the poet\r\ndiscloses fitfully on this side and that. None of these things are to be\r\nfound in _The Ring and the Book_ The action of Caponsacchi, though noble\r\nand disinterested, is hardly heroic in the highest dramatic sense, for\r\nit is not much more than the lofty defiance of a conventionality, the\r\ncontemplated penalty being only small; not, for example, as if life or\r\nascertained happiness had been the fixed or even probable price of his\r\nmagnanimous enterprise. There was no marching to the stake, no\r\ndeliberate encountering of the mightier risks, no voluntary submission\r\nto a lifelong endurance. True, this came in the end, but it was an end\r\nunforeseen, and one, therefore, not to be associated with the first\r\nconception of the original act. Besides, Guido is so saturated with\r\nhateful and ignoble motive as to fill the surrounding air with\r\ninfluences that preclude heroic association. It has been said of the\r\ngreat men to whom the Byzantine Empire once or twice gave birth, that\r\neven their fame has a curiously tarnished air, as if that too had been\r\ntouched by the evil breath of the times. And in like manner we may say\r\nof Guido Franceschini that even to have touched him in the way of\r\nresistance detracts from pure heroism. Perhaps the same consideration\r\nexplains the comparative disappointment which most people seem to have\r\nfelt with _Pompilia_ in the third volume. Again, there is nothing which\r\ncan be rightly called majesty of character visible in one personage or\r\nanother. There is high devotion in Caponsacchi, a large-minded and free\r\nsagacity in Pope Innocent, and around Pompilia the tragic pathos of an\r\nincurable woe, which by its intensity might raise her to grandeur if it\r\nsprang from some more solemn source than the mere malignity and baseness\r\nof an unworthy oppressor. Lastly, there is nothing in _The Ring and the\r\nBook_ of that \"certain incommensurableness\" which Goethe found in his\r\nown _Faust_. The poem is kept closely concrete and strictly\r\ncommensurable by the very framework of its story:--\r\n\r\n      \"pure crude fact,\r\n  Secreted from man's life when hearts beat hard,\r\n  And brains, high-blooded, ticked two centuries since.\"\r\n\r\nIt moves from none of the supernatural agencies which give the impulse\r\nto our interest in _Faust_, nor from the sublimer passions and\r\nyearning after things unspeakable alike in _Faust_ and in _Hamlet._\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding its lack of the accustomed elements of grandeur,\r\nthere is a profound impressiveness about _The Ring and the Book_\r\nwhich must arise from the presence of some other fine compensating\r\nor equivalent quality. Perhaps one may say that this equivalent for\r\ngrandeur is a certain simple touching of our sense of human kinship,\r\nof the large identity of the conditions of the human lot, of the\r\npiteous fatalities which bring the lives of the great multitude of men\r\nto be little more than \"grains of sand to be blown by the wind.\" This\r\nold woe, the poet says, now in the fulness of the days again lives,\r\n\r\n  \"_If precious be the soul of man to man_.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the deeply implanted sentiment to which his poem makes\r\nsuccessful appeal. Nor is it mocked by mere outpouring of scorn on the\r\nblind and fortuitous groping of men and societies of men after truth\r\nand justice and traces of the watchfulness of \"the unlidded eye of\r\nGod.\" Rather it is this inability to see beyond the facts of our\r\ncondition to some diviner, ever-present law, which helps to knit us to\r\nour kind, our brethren \"whom we have seen.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Clouds obscure--\r\n  But for which obscuration all were bright?\r\n  Too hastily concluded! Sun-suffused,\r\n  A cloud may soothe the eye made blind by blaze,--\r\n  Better the very clarity of heaven:\r\n  The soft streaks are the beautiful and dear.\r\n  What but the weakness in a faith supplies\r\n  The incentive to humanity, no strength\r\n  Absolute, irresistible, comports?\r\n  How can man love but what he yearns to help\r\n  And that which men think weakness within strength\r\n  But angels know for strength and stronger get--\r\n  What were it else but the first things made new,\r\n  But repetition of the miracle,\r\n  The divine instance of self-sacrifice\r\n  That never ends and aye begins for man?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIALS OF A MAN OF LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities of a good contributor? What makes a good\r\nReview? Is the best literature produced by the writer who does nothing\r\nelse but write, or by the man who tempers literature by affairs? What\r\nare the different recommendations of the rival systems of anonymity\r\nand signature? What kind of change, if any, has passed over periodical\r\nliterature since those two great periodicals, the _Edinburgh_ and the\r\n_Quarterly_, held sway? These and a number of other questions in the\r\nsame matter--some of them obviously not to be opened with propriety in\r\nthese pages--must naturally be often present to the mind of any one\r\nwho is concerned in the control of a Review, and a volume has just\r\nbeen printed which sets such musings once more astir. Mr. Macvey\r\nNapier was the editor of the _Edinburgh Review_ from 1829--when\r\nJeffrey, after a reign of seven-and-twenty years, resigned it into\r\nhis hands--until his death in 1847. A portion of the correspondence\r\naddressed to Mr. Napier during this period is full of personal\r\ninterest both to the man of letters and to that more singular being,\r\nthe Editor, the impresario of men of letters, the _entrepreneur_ of\r\nthe spiritual power.\r\n\r\nTo manage an opera-house is usually supposed to tax human powers more\r\nurgently than any position save that of a general in the very heat\r\nand stress of battle. The orchestra, the chorus, the subscribers,\r\nthe first tenor, a pair of rival prima donnas, the newspapers, the\r\nbox-agents in Bond Street, the army of hangers-on in the flies--all\r\ncombine to demand such gifts of tact, resolution, patience, foresight,\r\ntenacity, flexibility, as are only expected from the great ruler\r\nor the great soldier. The editor of a periodical of public\r\nconsideration--and the _Edinburgh Review_ in the hands of Mr. Napier\r\nwas the avowed organ of the ruling Whig powers--is sorely tested\r\nin the same way. The rival house may bribe his stars. His popular\r\nepigrammatist is sometimes as full of humours as a spoiled soprano.\r\nThe favourite pyrotechnist is systematically late and procrastinatory,\r\nor is piqued because his punctuation or his paragraphs have been\r\nmeddled with. The contributor whose article would be in excellent\r\ntime if it did not appear before the close of the century, or never\r\nappeared at all, pesters you with warnings that a month's delay is a\r\ndeadly blow to progress, and stays the great procession of the ages.\r\nThe contributor who could profitably fill a sheet, insists on sending\r\na treatise. Sir George Cornewall Lewis, who had charge of the\r\n_Edinburgh_ for a short space, truly described prolixity as the _bête\r\nnoire_ of an editor. \"Every contributor,\" he said, \"has some special\r\nreason for wishing to write at length on his own subject.\"\r\n\r\n_Ah, que de choses dans un menuet!_ cried Marcel, the great\r\ndancing-master, and ah, what things in the type and [Greek: idea] of\r\nan article, cries an editor with the enthusiasm of his calling; such\r\nproportion, measure, comprehension, variety of topics, pithiness of\r\ntreatment, all within a space appointed with Procrustean rigour. This\r\nis what the soul of the volunteer contributor is dull to. Of the minor\r\nvexations who can tell? There is one single tribulation dire enough\r\nto poison life--even if there were no other--and this is disorderly\r\nmanuscript. Empson, Mr. Napier's well-known contributor, was one of\r\nthe worst offenders; he would never even take the trouble to mark his\r\nparagraphs. It is my misfortune to have a manuscript before me at this\r\nmoment that would fill thirty of these pages, and yet from beginning\r\nto end there is no indication that it is not to be read at a single\r\nbreath. The paragraph ought to be, and in all good writers it is, as\r\nreal and as sensible a division as the sentence. It is an organic\r\nmember in prose composition, with a beginning, a middle, and an end,\r\njust as a stanza is an organic and definite member in the composition\r\nof an ode, \"I fear my manuscript is rather disorderly,\" says another,\r\n\"but I will correct carefully in print.\" Just so. Because he is too\r\nheedless to do his work in a workmanlike way, he first inflicts\r\nfatigue and vexation on the editor whom he expects to read his paper;\r\nsecond, he inflicts considerable and quite needless expense on the\r\npublisher; and thirdly, he inflicts a great deal of tedious and\r\nthankless labour on the printers, who are for the most part far more\r\nmeritorious persons than fifth-rate authors. It is true that Burke\r\nreturned such disordered proofs that the printer usually found it\r\nleast troublesome to set the whole afresh, and Miss Martineau tells\r\na story of a Scotch compositor who fled from Edinburgh to avoid\r\nCarlyle's manuscript, and to his horror was presently confronted with\r\na piece of the too familiar copy which made him cry, \"Lord, have\r\nmercy! Have _you_ got that man to print for!\" But most editors will\r\ncheerfully forgive such transgressions to all contributors who will\r\nguarantee that they write as well as Burke or Carlyle. Alas! it is\r\nusually the case that those who have least excuse are the worst\r\noffenders. The slovenliest manuscripts come from persons to whom\r\nthe difference between an hour and a minute is of the very smallest\r\nimportance. This, however, is a digression, only to be excused partly\r\nby the natural desire to say a word against one's persecutors, and\r\npartly by a hope that some persons of sensitive conscience may be led\r\nto ponder whether there may not be after all some moral obligations\r\neven towards editors and printers.\r\n\r\nMr. Napier had one famous contributor, who stands out alone in the\r\nhistory of editors. Lord Brougham's traditional connection with the\r\nReview,--he had begun to write either in its first or third number,\r\nand had written in it ever since--his encyclopaedic ignorance, his\r\npower, his great fame in the country, and the prestige which his\r\nconnection reflected on the Review, all made him a personage with whom\r\nit would have been most imprudent to quarrel. Yet the position in\r\nwhich Mr. Napier was placed after Brougham's breach with the Whigs,\r\nwas one of the most difficult in which the conductor of a great organ\r\ncould possibly be placed. The Review was the representative, the\r\nchampion, and the mouthpiece of the Whig party, and of the Whigs who\r\nwere in office. Before William IV. dismissed the Whigs in 1834 as\r\narbitrarily as his father had dismissed the Whigs in 1784, Brougham\r\nhad covered himself with disrepute among his party by a thousand\r\npranks, and after the dismissal he disgusted them by asking the\r\nnew Chancellor to make him Chief Baron of the Exchequer. When Lord\r\nMelbourne returned to power in the following year, this and other\r\nescapades were remembered against him. \"If left out,\" said Lord\r\nMelbourne, \"he would indeed be dangerous; but if taken in, he would\r\nsimply be destructive.\" So Brougham was left out, Pepys was made\r\nChancellor, and the Premier compared himself to a man who has broken\r\nwith a termagant mistress and married the best of cooks. Mr. Napier\r\nwas not so happy. The termagant was left on his hands. He had to\r\nkeep terms with a contributor who hated with deadly hatred the very\r\ngovernment that the Review existed to support. No editor ever had such\r\na contributor as Brougham in the long history of editorial torment\r\nsince the world began. He scolds, he storms, he hectors, he lectures;\r\nhe is for ever threatening desertion and prophesying ruin; he exhausts\r\nthe vocabulary of opprobrium against his correspondent's best friends;\r\nthey are silly slaves, base traitors, a vile clique \"whose treatment\r\nof me has been the very _ne plus ultra_ of ingratitude, baseness, and\r\ntreachery.\" He got the Review and its editor into a scrape which shook\r\nthe world at the time (1834), by betraying Cabinet secrets to spite\r\nLord Durham. His cries against his adversaries are as violent as\r\nthe threats of Ajax in his tent, and as loud as the bellowings of\r\nPhiloctetes at the mouth of his cave. Here is one instance out of a\r\nhundred:--\r\n\r\n    \"That is a trifle, and I only mention it to beg of you to pluck up\r\n    a little courage, and not be alarmed every time any of the little\r\n    knot of threateners annoy you. _They want to break off all kind of\r\n    connection between me and the Edinburgh Review_. I have long seen\r\n    it. Their fury against the article in the last number knows no\r\n    bounds, and they will never cease till they worry you out of your\r\n    connection with me, and get the whole control of the Review into\r\n    their own hands, by forcing you to resign it yourself. A _party\r\n    and a personal_ engine is all they want to make it. What possible\r\n    right can any of these silly slaves have to object to my opinion\r\n    being--what it truly is--against the Holland House theory of Lord\r\n    Chatham's madness? I _know_ that Lord Grenville treated it with\r\n    contempt. I know others now living who did so too, and I know that\r\n    so stout a Whig as Sir P. Francis was clearly of that opinion, and\r\n    he knew Lord Chatham personally. I had every ground to believe\r\n    that Horace Walpole, a vile, malignant, and unnatural wretch,\r\n    though a very clever writer of Letters, was nine-tenths of the\r\n    Holland House authority for the tale. I knew that a baser man in\r\n    character, or a meaner in capacity than the first Lord Holland\r\n    existed not, even in those days of job and mediocrity. Why, then,\r\n    was I bound to take a false view because Lord Holland's family\r\n    have inherited his hatred of a great rival?\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I solicit your best attention to the fate which seems hastening\r\n    upon the _Edinburgh Review_. The having always been free from the\r\n    least control of booksellers is one of its principal distinctions,\r\n    and long was peculiarly so--perhaps it still has it _nearly_ to\r\n    itself. But if it shall become a _Treasury_ journal, I hardly see\r\n    any great advantage in one kind of independence without the\r\n    rest. Nay, I doubt if its _literary_ freedom, any more than its\r\n    political, will long survive. Books will be treated according as\r\n    the Treasury, or their under-strappers, regard the authors....\r\n    But, is it after all possible that the Review should be suffered\r\n    to sink into such a state of subserviency that it dares not insert\r\n    any discussion upon a general question of politics because it\r\n    might give umbrage to the Government of the day? I pass over the\r\n    undeniable fact that it is _underlings_ only whom you are scared\r\n    by, and that the Ministers themselves have no such inordinate\r\n    pretension as to dream of interfering. I say nothing of those\r\n    underlings generally, except this, that I well know the race, and\r\n    a more despicable, above all, in point of judgment, exists not.\r\n    Never mind their threats, they _can_ do no harm. Even if any of\r\n    them are contributors, be assured they never will withdraw because\r\n    you choose to keep your course free and independent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Napier, who seems to have been one of the most considerate and\r\nhigh-minded of men, was moved to energetic remonstrance on this\r\noccasion. Lord Brougham explained his strong language away, but he\r\nwas incapable of really controlling himself, and the strain was never\r\nlessened until 1843, when the correspondence ceases, and we learn\r\nthat there had been a quarrel between him and his too long-suffering\r\ncorrespondent. Yet John Allen,--that able scholar and conspicuous\r\nfigure in the annals of Holland House--wrote of Brougham to Mr.\r\nNapier:--\"He is not a malignant or bad-hearted man, but he is an\r\nunscrupulous one, and where his passions are concerned or his vanity\r\nirritated, there is no excess of which he is not capable.\" Of\r\nBrougham's strong and manly sense, when passion or vanity did not\r\ncloud it, and even of a sort of careful justice, these letters give\r\nmore than one instance. The _Quarterly Review_, for instance, had an\r\narticle on Romilly's Memoirs, which to Romilly's friends seemed to do\r\nhim less than justice. Brougham took a more sensible view.\r\n\r\n    \"Surely we had no right whatever to expect that they whom Romilly\r\n    had all his life so stoutly opposed, and who were treated by him\r\n    with great harshness, should treat him as his friends would do,\r\n    and at the very moment when a most injudicious act of his family\r\n    was bringing out all his secret thoughts against them. Only place\r\n    yourself in the same position, and suppose that Canning's private\r\n    journals had been published,--the journals he may have kept while\r\n    the bitterest enemy of the Whigs, and in every page of which there\r\n    must have been some passage offensive to the feelings of the\r\n    living and of the friends of the dead. Would any mercy have been\r\n    shown to Canning's character and memory by any of the Whig party,\r\n    either in society or in Reviews? Would the line have been drawn of\r\n    only attacking Canning's executors, who published the papers, and\r\n    leaving Canning himself untouched? Clearly and certainly not,\r\n    and yet I am putting a very much weaker case, for we had joined\r\n    Canning, and all political enmity was at an end: whereas the\r\n    Tories and Romilly never had for an hour laid aside their mutual\r\n    hostility.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if he was capable of equity, Brougham was also capable of hearty\r\nadmiration, even of an old friend who had on later occasions gone into\r\na line which he intensely disliked. It is a relief in the pages of\r\nblusterous anger and raging censure to come upon what he says of\r\nJeffrey.\r\n\r\n    \"I can truly say that there never in all my life crossed my mind\r\n    one single unkind feeling respecting him, or indeed any feeling\r\n    but that of the warmest affection and the most unmingled\r\n    admiration of his character, believing and knowing him to be as\r\n    excellent and amiable as he is great in the ordinary, and, as I\r\n    think, the far less important sense of the word.\"\r\n\r\nOf the value of Brougham's contributions we cannot now judge. They\r\nwill not, in spite of their energy and force, bear re-reading to-day,\r\nand perhaps the same may be said of three-fourths of Jeffrey's once\r\nfamous essays. Brougham's self-confidence is heroic. He believed that\r\nhe could make a speech for Bolingbroke, but by-and-by he had sense\r\nenough to see that, in order to attempt this, he ought to read\r\nBolingbroke for a year, and then practise for another year. In 1838 he\r\nthought nothing of undertaking, amid all the demands of active life,\r\nsuch a bagatelle as a History of the French Revolution. \"I have some\r\nlittle knack of narrative,\" he says, \"the most difficult by far of all\r\nstyles, and never yet attained in perfection but by Hume and Livy;\r\nand I bring as much oratory and science to the task as most of my\r\npredecessors.\" But what sort of science? And what has oratory to do\r\nwith it? And how could he deceive himself into thinking that he could\r\nretire to write a history? Nobody that ever lived would have more\r\nspeedily found out the truth of Voltaire's saying, \"_Le repos est\r\nune bonne chose, mais l'ennui est son frère_.\" The truth is that one\r\nlearns, after a certain observation of the world, to divide one's\r\namazement pretty equally between the literary voluptuary or\r\nover-fastidious collegian, on the one hand, who is so impressed by the\r\nsize of his subject that he never does more than collect material and\r\nmake notes, and the presumptuous politician, on the other hand, who\r\nthinks that he can write a history or settle the issues of philosophy\r\nand theology in odd half-hours. The one is so enfeebled in will and\r\nliterary energy after his _viginti annorum lucubrationes_; the other\r\nis so accustomed to be content with the hurry, the unfinishedness,\r\nthe rough-and-ready methods of practical affairs, and they both in\r\ndifferent ways measure the worth and seriousness of literature so\r\nwrongly in relation to the rest of human interests.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Lord Brougham and Mr. Napier naturally suggest\r\na good many reflections on the vexed question of the comparative\r\nadvantages of the old and the new theory of a periodical. The new\r\ntheory is that a periodical should not be an organ but an open pulpit,\r\nand that each writer should sign his name. Without disrespect to ably\r\nconducted and eminent contemporaries of long standing, it may be said\r\nthat the tide of opinion and favour is setting in this direction. Yet,\r\non the whole, experience perhaps leads to a doubt whether the gains of\r\nthe system of signature are so very considerable as some of us once\r\nexpected. An editor on the new system is no doubt relieved of a\r\ncertain measure of responsibility. Lord Cockburn's panegyric on the\r\nfirst great editor may show what was expected from a man in such a\r\nposition as Jeffrey's. \"He had to discover, and to train, authors; to\r\ndiscern what truth and the public mind required; to suggest subjects;\r\nto reject, and, more offensive still, to improve, contributions; to\r\nkeep down absurdities; to infuse spirit; to excite the timid; to\r\nrepress violence; to soothe jealousies; to quell mutinies; to watch\r\ntimes; and all this in the morning of the reviewing day, before\r\nexperience had taught editors conciliatory firmness, and contributors\r\nreasonable submission. He directed and controlled the elements he\r\npresided over with a master's judgment. There was not one of his\r\nassociates who could have even held these elements together for a\r\nsingle year.... Inferior to these excellences, but still important,\r\nwas his dexterity in revising the writings of others. Without altering\r\nthe general tone or character of the composition, he had great skill\r\nin leaving out defective ideas or words, and in so aiding the original\r\nby lively or graceful touches, that reasonable authors were surprised\r\nand charmed on seeing how much better they looked than they thought\r\nthey would\" (Cockburn's _Life of Jeffrey_, i. 301).\r\n\r\nFrom such toils and dangers as these the editor of a Review with\r\nsigned articles is in the main happily free. He has usually\r\nsuggestions to make, for his experience has probably given him points\r\nof view as to the effectiveness of this or that feature of an article\r\nfor its own purpose, which would not occur to a writer. The writer is\r\nabsorbed in his subject, and has been less accustomed to think of the\r\npublic. But this exercise of a claim to a general acquiescence in the\r\njudgment and experience of a man who has the best reasons for trying\r\nto judge rightly, is a very different thing from the duty of drilling\r\ncontributors and dressing contributions as they were dressed and\r\ndrilled by Jeffrey. As Southey said, when groaning under the\r\nmutilations inflicted by Gifford on Iris contributions to the\r\n_Quarterly_, \"there must be a power expurgatory in the hands of\r\nthe editor; and the misfortune is that editors frequently think it\r\nincumbent on them to use that power merely because they have it\"\r\n(Southey's Life, iv. 18). This is probably true on the anonymous\r\nsystem, where the editor is answerable for every word, and for the\r\nliterary form no less than for the substantial soundness or interest\r\nof an article. In a man of weakish literary vanity--Jeffrey was\r\nevidently full of it--there may well be a constant itch to set his\r\nbetters right in trifles, as Gifford thought that he could mend\r\nSouthey's adjectives. To a vain editor, or a too masterful editor, the\r\ntemptation under the anonymous system is no doubt strong. M. Buloz,\r\nit is true, the renowned conductor of the _Revue des deux Mondes_, is\r\nsaid to have insisted on, and to have freely practised, the fullest\r\neditorial prerogative over articles that were openly signed by the\r\nmost eminent names in France. But M. Buloz had no competitor, and\r\nthose who did not choose to submit to his Sultanic despotism were\r\nshut out from the only pulpit whence they were sure of addressing the\r\ncongregation that they wanted. In England contributors are better\r\noff; and no editor of a signed periodical would feel either bound or\r\npermitted to take such trouble about mere wording of sentences as\r\nGifford and Jeffrey were in the habit of taking.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another side to this, from an editor's point of\r\nview. With responsibility--not merely for commas and niceties and\r\nliterary kickshaws, but in its old sense--disappears also a portion of\r\nthe interest of editorial labour. One would suppose it must be more\r\ninteresting to command a man-of-war than a trading vessel; it would be\r\nmore interesting to lead a regiment than to keep a tilting-yard. But\r\nthe times are not ripe for such enterprises. Of literary ability of\r\na good and serviceable kind there is a hundred or five hundred times\r\nmore in the country than there was when Jeffrey, Smith, Brougham, and\r\nHorner devised their Review in a ninth storey in Edinburgh seventy-six\r\nyears ago. It is the cohesion of a political creed that is gone, and\r\nthe strength and fervour of a political school. The principles that\r\ninspired that group of strong men have been worked out. After their\r\nreforms had been achieved, the next great school was economic, and\r\nthough it produced one fine orator, its work was at no time literary.\r\nThe Manchester school with all their shortcomings had at least the\r\nsignal distinction of attaching their views on special political\r\nquestions to a general and presiding conception of the modern phase of\r\ncivilisation, as industrial and pacific. The next party of advance,\r\nwhen it is formed, will certainly borrow from Cobden and Bright their\r\nhatred of war and their hatred of imperialism. After the sagacity and\r\nenlightenment of this school came the school of persiflage. A knot of\r\nvigorous and brilliant men towards 1856 rallied round the late editor\r\nof the _Saturday Review_,--and a strange chief he was for such\r\na group,--but their flag was that of the Red Rover. They gave\r\nPhilistinism many a shrewd blow, but perhaps at the same time helped\r\nto some degree--with other far deeper and stronger forces--to produce\r\nthat sceptical and centrifugal state of mind, which now tends to\r\nnullify organised liberalism and paralyse the spirit of improvement.\r\nThe Benthamites, led first by James Mill, and afterwards in a\r\nsecondary degree by John Mill, had pushed a number of political\r\nimprovements in the radical and democratic direction during the\r\ntime when the _Edinburgh_ so powerfully represented more orthodox\r\nliberalism. They were the last important group of men who started\r\ntogether from a set of common principles, accepted a common programme\r\nof practical applications, and set to work in earnest and with due\r\norder and distribution of parts to advocate the common cause.\r\n\r\nAt present [1878] there is no similar agreement either among the\r\nyounger men in parliament, or among a sufficiently numerous group of\r\nwriters outside of parliament. The Edinburgh Reviewers were most\r\nof them students of the university of that city. The Westminster\r\nReviewers had all sat at the feet of Bentham. Each group had thus a\r\ncommon doctrine and a positive doctrine. In practical politics it does\r\nnot much matter by what different roads men have travelled to a given\r\nposition. But in an organ intended to lead public opinion towards\r\ncertain changes, or to hold it steadfast against wayward gusts of\r\npassion, its strength would be increased a hundredfold if all the\r\nwriters in it were inspired by that thorough unity of conviction which\r\ncomes from sincerely accepting a common set of principles to start\r\nfrom, and reaching practical conclusions by the same route. We are\r\nprobably not very far from a time when such a group might form itself,\r\nand its work would for some years lie in the formation of a general\r\nbody of opinion, rather than in practical realisation of this or that\r\nmeasure. The success of the French Republic, the peaceful order of the\r\nUnited States, perhaps some trouble within our own borders, will lead\r\nmen with open minds to such a conception of a high and stable type of\r\nnational life as will unite a sufficient number of them in a common\r\nproject for pressing with systematic iteration for a complete set of\r\norganic changes. A country with such a land-system, such an electoral\r\nsystem, such a monarchy, as ours, has a trying time before it. Those\r\nwill be doing good service who shall unite to prepare opinion for the\r\ninevitable changes. At the present moment the only motto that can be\r\ninscribed on the flag of a liberal Review is the general device of\r\nProgress, each writer interpreting it in his own sense, and within\r\nsuch limits as he may set for himself. For such a state of things\r\nsignature is the natural condition, and an editor, even of a signed\r\nReview, would hardly decline to accept the account of his function\r\nwhich we find Jeffrey giving to Mr. Napier:--\"There are three\r\nlegitimate considerations by which you should be guided in your\r\nconduct as editor generally, and particularly as to the admission or\r\nrejection of important articles of a political sort. 1. The effect of\r\nyour decision on the other contributors upon whom you mainly rely; 2.\r\nits effect on the sale and circulation, and on the just authority\r\nof the work with the great body of its readers; and, 3. your own\r\ndeliberate opinion as to the safety or danger of the doctrines\r\nmaintained in the article under consideration, and its tendency\r\neither to promote or retard the practical adoption of those liberal\r\nprinciples to which, and _their practical advancement_, you must\r\nalways consider the journal as devoted.\"\r\n\r\nAs for discovering and training authors, the editor under the new\r\nsystem has inducements that lie entirely the other way; namely,\r\nto find as many authors as possible whom the public has already\r\ndiscovered and accepted for itself. Young unknown writers certainly\r\nhave not gained anything by the new system. Neither perhaps can they\r\nbe said to have lost, for though of two articles of equal merit\r\nan editor would naturally choose the one which should carry the\r\nadditional recommendation of a name of recognised authority, yet any\r\nmarked superiority in literary brilliance or effective argument or\r\noriginality of view would be only too eagerly welcomed in any Review\r\nin England. So much public interest is now taken in periodical\r\nliterature, and the honourable competition in securing variety,\r\nweight, and attractiveness is so active, that there is no risk of\r\na literary candle remaining long under a bushel. Miss Martineau\r\nsays:--\"I have always been anxious to extend to young or struggling\r\nauthors the sort of aid which would have been so precious to me in\r\nthat winter of 1829-30, and I know that, in above twenty years, I have\r\nnever succeeded but once.\" One of the most distinguished editors\r\nin London, who had charge of a periodical for many years, told the\r\npresent writer what comes to the same thing, namely, that in no single\r\ncase during all these years did a volunteer contributor of real\r\nquality, or with any promise of eminence, present himself or herself.\r\nSo many hundreds think themselves called, so few are chosen. It used\r\nto be argued that the writer under the anonymous system was hidden\r\nbehind a screen and robbed of his well-earned distinction. In truth,\r\nhowever, it is impossible for a writer of real distinction to remain\r\nanonymous. If a writer in a periodical interests the public, they are\r\nsure to find out who he is.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is folly unfathomable in a periodical affecting an\r\neternal consistency, and giving itself the airs of continuous\r\nindividuality, and being careful not to talk sense on a given question\r\nto-day because its founders talked nonsense upon it fifty years ago.\r\nThis is quite true. There is a monstrous charlatanry about the old\r\neditorial We, but perhaps there are some tolerably obvious openings\r\nfor charlatanry of a different kind under our own system. The man who\r\nwrites in his own name may sometimes be tempted to say what he knows\r\nhe is expected from his position or character to say, rather than what\r\nhe would have said if his personality were not concerned. As far as\r\nhonesty goes, signature perhaps offers as many inducements to one kind\r\nof insincerity, as anonymity offers to another kind. And on the public\r\nit might perhaps be contended that there is an effect of a rather\r\nsimilar sort. They are in some cases tempted away from serious\r\ndiscussion of the matter, into frivolous curiosity and gossip about\r\nthe man. All this criticism of the principle of which the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ was the earliest English adherent, will not be taken as the\r\nresult in the present writer of Chamfort's _maladie des désabusés_;\r\nthat would be both extremely ungrateful and without excuse or reason.\r\nIt is merely a fragment of disinterested contribution to the study of\r\na remarkable change that is passing over a not unimportant department\r\nof literature. One gain alone counterbalances all the drawbacks, and\r\nthat is a gain that could hardly have been foreseen or expected; I\r\nmean the freedom with which the great controversies of religion and\r\ntheology have been discussed in the new Reviews. The removal of the\r\nmask has led to an outburst of plain speaking on these subjects, which\r\nto Mr. Napier's generation would have seemed simply incredible. The\r\nfrank avowal of unpopular beliefs or non-beliefs has raised the whole\r\nlevel of the discussion, and perhaps has been even more advantageous\r\nto the orthodox in teaching them more humility, than to the heterodox\r\nin teaching them more courage and honesty.\r\n\r\nLet us return to Mr. Napier's volume. We have said that it is\r\nimpossible for a great writer to be anonymous. No reader will need to\r\nbe told who among Mr. Napier's correspondents is the writer of the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have been thinking sometimes, likewise, of a paper on Napoleon,\r\n    a man whom, though handled to the extreme of triteness, it will be\r\n    long years before we understand. Hitherto in the English tongue,\r\n    there is next to nothing that betokens insight into him, or even\r\n    sincere belief of such, on the part of the writer. I should like\r\n    to study the man with what heartiness I could, and form to myself\r\n    some intelligible picture of him, both as a biographical and as\r\n    a historical figure, in both of which senses he is our chief\r\n    contemporary wonder, and in some sort the epitome of his age.\r\n    This, however, were a task of far more difficulty than Byron, and\r\n    perhaps not so promising at present.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if there is any difficulty in recognising the same hand in the\r\nnext proposal, it arises only from the circumstance that it is this\r\nwriter above all others who has made Benthamism a term of reproach on\r\nthe lips of men less wise than himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"A far finer essay were a faithful, loving, and yet critical, and\r\n    in part condemnatory, delineation of Jeremy Bentham, and his place\r\n    and working in this section of the world's history. Bentham will\r\n    not be put down by logic, and should not be put down, for we need\r\n    him greatly as a backwoodsman: neither can reconciliation be\r\n    effected till the one party understands and is just to the other.\r\n    Bentham is a denyer; he denies with a loud and universally\r\n    convincing voice; his fault is that he can _affirm_ nothing,\r\n    except that money is pleasant in the purse, and food in the\r\n    stomach, and that by this simplest of all beliefs he can\r\n    reorganise society. He can shatter it in pieces--no thanks to him,\r\n    for its old fastenings are quite rotten--but he cannot reorganise\r\n    it; this is work for quite others than he. Such an essay on\r\n    Bentham, however, were a great task for any one; for me a very\r\n    great one, and perhaps rather out of my road.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Carlyle would have agreed that Mr. Mill's famous pair of\r\nessays on Bentham and Coleridge have served the purpose which he had\r\nin his mind, though we may well regret the loss of such a picture of\r\nBentham's philosophic personality as he would surely have given us. It\r\nis touching to think of him whom we all know as the most honoured name\r\namong living veterans of letters,[1] passing through the vexed ordeal\r\nof the young recruit, and battling for his own against the waywardness\r\nof critics and the blindness of publishers. In 1831 he writes to Mr.\r\nNapier: \"All manner of perplexities have occurred in the publishing\r\nof my poor book, which perplexities I could only cut asunder, not\r\nunloose; so the MS. like an unhappy ghost still lingers on the wrong\r\nside of Styx; the Charon of ---- Street durst not risk it in his\r\n_sutilis cymba_, so it leaped ashore again.\" And three months later:\r\n\"I have given up the notion of hawking my little Manuscript Book about\r\nany further; for a long time it has lain quiet in its drawer, waiting\r\nfor a better day.\" And yet this little book was nothing less than the\r\nHistory of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Carlyle died on February 5, 1881.]\r\n\r\nIt might be a lesson to small men to see the reasonableness, sense,\r\nand patience of these greater men. Macaulay's letters show him to have\r\nbeen a pattern of good sense and considerateness. Mr. Carlyle seems\r\nindeed to have found Jeffrey's editorial vigour more than could be\r\nendured:\r\n\r\n    \"My respected friend your predecessor had some difficulty with me\r\n    in adjusting the respective prerogatives of Author and Editor, for\r\n    though not, as I hope, insensible to fair reason, I used sometimes\r\n    to rebel against what I reckoned mere authority, and this partly\r\n    perhaps as a matter of literary conscience; being wont to write\r\n    nothing without studying it if possible to the bottom, and writing\r\n    always with an almost painful feeling of scrupulosity, that light\r\n    editorial hacking and hewing to right and left was in general\r\n    nowise to my mind.\"\r\n\r\nBut we feel that the fault must have lain with Jeffrey; the\r\nqualifications that Lord Cockburn admired so much were not likely to\r\nbe to the taste of a man of Mr. Carlyle's grit. That did not prevent\r\nthe most original of Mr. Napier's contributors from being one of the\r\nmost just and reasonable.\r\n\r\n    \"I have, barely within my time, finished that paper\r\n    ['Characteristics'], to which you are now heartily welcome, if you\r\n    have room for it. The doctrines here set forth have mostly long\r\n    been familiar convictions with me; yet it is perhaps only within\r\n    the last twelvemonth that the public utterance of some of them\r\n    could have seemed a duty. I have striven to express myself with\r\n    what guardedness was possible; and, as there will now be no time\r\n    for correcting proofs, I must leave it wholly in your editorial\r\n    hands. Nay, should it on due consideration appear to you in your\r\n    place (for I see that matter dimly, and nothing is clear but my\r\n    own mind and the general condition of the world), unadvisable to\r\n    print the paper at all, then pray understand, my dear Sir, now and\r\n    always, that I am no unreasonable man; but if dogmatic enough (as\r\n    Jeffrey used to call it) in my own beliefs, also truly desirous to\r\n    be just towards those of others. I shall, in all sincerity, beg of\r\n    you to do, without fear of offence (for in _no_ point of view will\r\n    there be any), what you yourself see good. A mighty work lies\r\n    before the writers of this time.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always interesting, to the man of letters at any rate if not\r\nto his neighbours, to find what was first thought by men of admitted\r\ncompetence of the beginnings of writers who are now seen to have made\r\na mark on the world. \"When the reputation of authors is made,\" said\r\nSainte-Beuve, \"it is easy to speak of them _convenablement_: we have\r\nonly to guide ourselves by the common opinion. But at the start, at\r\nthe moment when they are trying their first flight and are in part\r\nignorant of themselves, then to judge them with tact, with precision,\r\nnot to exaggerate their scope, to predict their flight, or divine\r\ntheir limits, to put the reasonable objections in the midst of all\r\ndue respect--this is the quality of the critic who is born to be a\r\ncritic.\" We have been speaking of Mr. Carlyle. This is what Jeffrey\r\nthought of him in 1832:--\r\n\r\n    \"I fear Carlyle will not do, that is, if you do not take the\r\n    liberties and the pains with him that I did, by striking out\r\n    freely, and writing in occasionally. The misfortune is, that he\r\n    is very obstinate, and unluckily in a place like this, he finds\r\n    people enough to abet and applaud him, to intercept the operation\r\n    of the otherwise infallible remedy of general avoidance and\r\n    neglect. It is a great pity, for he is a man of genius and\r\n    industry, and with the capacity of being an elegant and impressive\r\n    writer\"\r\n\r\nThe notion of Jeffrey occasionally writing elegantly and impressively\r\ninto Carlyle's proof-sheets is rather striking. Some of Jeffrey's\r\nother criticisms sound very curiously in our ear in these days. It\r\nis startling to find Mill's _Logic_ described (1843) as a \"great\r\nunreadable book, and its elaborate demonstration of axioms and\r\ntruisms.\" A couple of years later Jeffrey admits, in speaking of Mr.\r\nMill's paper on Guizot--\"Though I have long thought very highly of his\r\npowers as a reasoner, I scarcely gave him credit for such large and\r\nsound views of _realities_ and practical results as are displayed\r\nin this article.\" Sir James Stephen--the distinguished sire of two\r\ndistinguished contributors, who may remind more than one editor of our\r\ngeneration of the Horatian saying, that\r\n\r\n  \"Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis,\r\n  ... neque imbellera feroces\r\n     Progenerant aquilae columbam\"\r\n\r\n--this excellent writer took a more just measure of the book which\r\nJeffrey thought unreadable.\r\n\r\n    \"My more immediate object in writing is to remind you of John\r\n    Mill's book [System of Logic], of which I have lately been reading\r\n    a considerable part, and I have done so with the conviction that\r\n    it is one of the most remarkable productions of this nineteenth\r\n    century. Exceedingly debatable indeed, but most worthy of debate,\r\n    are many of his favourite tenets, especially those of the last\r\n    two or three chapters. No man is fit to encounter him who is not\r\n    thoroughly conversant with the moral sciences which he handles;\r\n    and remembering what you told me of your own studies under Dugald\r\n    Stewart, I cannot but recommend the affair to your own personal\r\n    attention. You will find very few men fit to be trusted with it.\r\n    You ought to be aware that, although with great circumspection,\r\n    not to say timidity, Mill is an opponent of Religion in the\r\n    abstract, not of any particular form of it. That is, he evidently\r\n    maintains that superhuman influences on the mind of man are but a\r\n    dream, whence the inevitable conclusion that all acts of devotion\r\n    and prayer are but a superstition. That such is his real meaning,\r\n    however darkly conveyed, is indisputable. You are well aware that\r\n    it is in direct conflict with my own deepest and most cherished\r\n    convictions. Yet to condemn him for holding, and for calmly\r\n    publishing such views, is but to add to the difficulties of fair\r\n    and full discussion, and to render truth (or supposed truth), less\r\n    certain and valuable than if it had invited, and encountered,\r\n    and triumphed over every assault of every honest antagonist. I,\r\n    therefore, wish Mill to be treated respectfully and handsomely.\"\r\n\r\nFew of Mr. Napier's correspondents seem to have been more considerate.\r\nAt one period (1844) a long time had passed without any contribution\r\nfrom Sir James Stephen's pen appearing in the Review. Mr. Senior\r\nwrote a hint on the subject to the editor, and Napier seems to have\r\ncommunicated with Sir James Stephen, who replied in a model strain.\r\n\r\n    \"Have you any offer of a paper or papers from my friend John\r\n    Austin? If you have, and if you are not aware what manner of man\r\n    he is, it may not be amiss that you should be apprised that in\r\n    these parts he enjoys, and deservedly, a very high and yet a\r\n    peculiar reputation. I have a great attachment to him. He is, in\r\n    the best sense of the word, a philosopher, an earnest and humble\r\n    lover of wisdom. I know not anywhere a larger minded man, and yet,\r\n    eloquent as he is in speech, there is, in his written style, an\r\n    involution and a lack of vivacity which renders his writings a\r\n    sealed book to almost every one. Whether he will be able to assume\r\n    an easier and a lighter manner, I do not know. If not, I rather\r\n    fear for him when he stands at your bar. All I ask is, that you\r\n    would convey your judgment in measured and (as far as you can\r\n    honestly) in courteous terms; for he is, for so considerable a\r\n    man, strangely sensitive. You must have an odd story to tell of\r\n    your intercourse with the knights of the Order of the Quill.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the letter closed with what an editor values more even than\r\ndecently Christian treatment, namely the suggestion of a fine subject.\r\nThis became the admirable essay on the Clapham Sect.\r\n\r\nThe author of one of the two or three most delightful biographies\r\nin all literature has published the letter to Mr. Napier in which\r\nMacaulay speaks pretty plainly what he thought about Brougham and the\r\nextent of his services to the Review. Brougham in turn hated Macaulay,\r\nwhom he calls the third or greatest bore in society that he has ever\r\nknown. He is furious--and here Brougham was certainly not wrong--over\r\nthe \"most profligate political morality\" of Macaulay's essay on Clive.\r\n\r\n    \"In my eyes, his defence of Clive, and the audacious ground of\r\n    it, merit execration. It is a most serious, and, to me, a painful\r\n    subject. No--no--all the sentences a man can turn, even if he made\r\n    them in pure taste, and not in Tom's snip-snap taste of the lower\r\n    empire,--all won't avail against a rotten morality. The first and\r\n    most sacred duty of a public man, and, above all, an author, is\r\n    to keep by honest and true doctrine--never to relax--never to\r\n    countenance vice--ever to hold fast by virtue. What? Are we\r\n    gravely to be told, at this time of day, that a set-off may be\r\n    allowed for public, and, therefore, atrocious crimes, though he\r\n    admits that a common felon pleads it in vain? Gracious God, where\r\n    is this to end! What horrors will it not excuse! Tiberius's great\r\n    capacity, his first-rate wit, that which made him the charm of\r\n    society, will next, I suppose, be set up to give a splendour to\r\n    the inhabitants of Capreae. Why, Olive's address, and his skill,\r\n    and his courage are not at all more certain, nor are they\r\n    qualities of a different cast. Every great ruffian, who has filled\r\n    the world with blood and tears, will be sure of an acquittal,\r\n    because of his talents and his success. After I had, and chiefly\r\n    in the _Edinburgh Review_, been trying to restore a better, a\r\n    purer, a higher standard of morals, and to wean men from the silly\r\n    love of military glory, for which they are the first to pay, I\r\n    find the _Edinburgh Review_ preaching, not merely the old and\r\n    common heresies, but ten thousand times worse, adopting a vile\r\n    principle never yet avowed in terms, though too often and too much\r\n    taken for a guide, unknown to those who followed it, in forming\r\n    their judgments of great and successful criminals.\"\r\n\r\nOf the essay on Warren Hastings he thought better, \"bating some\r\nvulgarity and Macaulay's usual want of all power of reasoning.\"\r\nLord Cockburn wrote to Mr. Napier (1844) a word or two on Macaulay.\r\n\"Delighting as I do,\" says Lord Cockburn, \"in his thoughts, views, and\r\nknowledge, I feel too often compelled to curse and roar at his words\r\nand the structure of his composition. As a corrupter of style, he is\r\nmore dangerous to the young than Gibbon. His seductive powers greater,\r\nhis defects worse.\" All good critics now accept this as true. Jeffrey,\r\nby the way, speaking of the same essay, thinks that Macaulay rates\r\nChatham too high. \"I have always had an impression,\" he says, \"(though\r\nperhaps an ignorant and unjust one), that there was more good luck\r\nthan wisdom in his foreign policy, and very little to admire (except\r\nhis personal purity) in any part of his domestic administration.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find a record, in the energetic speech of\r\ncontemporary hatred, of the way in which orthodox science regarded a\r\nonce famous book of heterodox philosophy. Here is Professor Sedgwick\r\non the _Vestiges of Creation_:--\r\n\r\n    \"I now know the Vestiges well, and I detest the book for its\r\n    shallowness, for the intense vulgarity of its philosophy, for its\r\n    gross, unblushing materialism, for its silly credulity in catering\r\n    out of every fool's dish, for its utter ignorance of what is meant\r\n    by induction, for its gross (and I dare to say, filthy) views of\r\n    physiology,--most ignorant and most false,--and for Its shameful\r\n    shuffling of the facts of geology so as to make them play a\r\n    rogue's game. I believe some woman is the author; partly from the\r\n    fair dress and agreeable exterior of the Vestiges: and partly from\r\n    the utter ignorance the book displays of all sound physical logic.\r\n    A _man_ who knew so much of the surface of Physics must, at least\r\n    on some one point or other, have taken a deeper plunge; but _all_\r\n    parts of the book are shallow.... From the bottom of my soul, I\r\n    loathe and detest the Vestiges. 'Tis a rank pill of asafoetida and\r\n    arsenic, covered with gold leaf. I do, therefore, trust that your\r\n    contributor has stamped with an iron heel upon the head of the\r\n    filthy abortion, and put an end to its crawlings. There is not one\r\n    subject the author handles bearing on life, of which he does not\r\n    take a degrading view.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Napier seems to have asked him to write on the book, and\r\nSedgwick's article, the first he ever wrote for a review, eventually\r\nappeared (1845),--without, it is to be hoped, too much of the raging\r\ncontempt of the above and other letters. \"I do feel contempt, and,\r\nI hope, I shall express it. Eats hatched by the incubations of a\r\ngoose--dogs playing dominos--monkeys breeding men and women--all\r\ndistinctions between natural and moral done away--the Bible proved\r\nall a lie, and mental philosophy one mass of folly, all of it to be\r\npounded down, and done over again in the cooking vessels of Gall and\r\nSpurzheim!\" This was the beginning of a long campaign, which is just\r\nnow drawing near its close. Let us at least be glad that orthodoxy,\r\nwhether scientific or religious, has mended his temper. One among\r\nother causes of the improvement, as we have already said, is probably\r\nto be found in the greater self-restraint which comes from the fact of\r\nthe writer appearing in his own proper person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALEDICTORY.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the writer's retirement from the editorship of the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_, in 1882.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present number of the Review marks the close of a task which was\r\nconfided to me no less than fifteen years ago--_grande mortalis cevi\r\nspatium_, a long span of one's mortal days. Fifteen years are enough\r\nto bring a man from youth to middle age, to test the working value of\r\nconvictions, to measure the advance of principles and beliefs, and,\r\nalas! to cut off many early associates and to extinguish many lights.\r\nIt is hardly possible that a Review should have been conducted for so\r\nconsiderable a time without the commission of some mistakes; articles\r\nadmitted which might as well have been left out, opinions expressed\r\nwhich have a crudish look in the mellow light of years, phrases\r\ndropped in the heat or hurry of the moment which one would fain\r\nobliterate. Many a regret must rise in men's minds on any occasion\r\nthat compels them to look back over a long reach of years. The\r\ndisparity between aim and performance, the unfulfilled promise, the\r\nwrong turnings taken at critical points--as an accident of the hour\r\ndraws us to take stock of a complete period of our lives, all these\r\nthings rise up in private and internal judgment against anybody who is\r\nnot either too stupid or too fatuously complacent to recognise facts\r\nwhen he sees them. But the mood passes. Time, happily, is merciful,\r\nand men's memories are benignly short.\r\n\r\nMore painful is the recollection of those earlier contributors of ours\r\nwho have vanished from the world. Periodical literature is like the\r\nmanna in the wilderness; it quickly loses its freshness, and to turn\r\nover thirty volumes of old Reviews can hardly be exhilarating at the\r\nbest: least of all so, when it recalls friends and coadjutors who\r\ncan give their help no more. George Henry Lewes, the founder of the\r\nReview, and always cordially interested in its fortunes, has not\r\nsurvived to see the end of the reign of his successor, His vivacious\r\nintelligence had probably done as much as he was competent to do for\r\nhis generation, but there were other important contributors, now gone,\r\nof whom this could not be said. In the region of political theory, the\r\nloss of J.E. Cairnes was truly lamentable and untimely. He had, as\r\nMill said of him, \"that rare qualification among writers on political\r\nand social subjects--a genuine scientific intellect.\" Not a month\r\npasses in which one does not feel how great an advantage it would have\r\nbeen to be able to go down to Blackheath, and discuss the perplexities\r\nof the time in that genial and manly companionship, where facts were\r\nweighed with so much care, where conclusions were measured with such\r\nbreadth and comprehension, and where even the great stolid idols of\r\nthe Cave and the Market Place were never too rudely buffeted. Of\r\na very different order of mind from Cairnes, but not less to be\r\npermanently regretted by all of us who knew him, was Mr. Bagehot,\r\nwhose books on the English Constitution, on Physics and Politics,\r\nand the fragment on the Postulates of Political Economy, were all\r\npublished in these pages. He wrote, in fact, the first article in\r\nthe first number. Though himself extremely cool and sceptical about\r\npolitical improvement of every sort, he took abundant interest in more\r\nardent friends. Perhaps it was that they amused him; in return his\r\ngood-natured ironies put them wholesomely on their mettle. As has been\r\nwell said of him, he had a unique power of animation without combat;\r\nit was all stimulus and yet no contest; his talk was full of youth,\r\nyet had all the wisdom of mature judgment _(R.H. Hutton)_. Those who\r\nwere least willing to assent to Bagehot's practical maxims in judging\r\ncurrent affairs, yet were well aware how much they profited by his\r\nSocratic objections, and knew, too, what real acquaintance with men\r\nand business, what honest sympathy and friendliness, and what serious\r\njudgment and interest all lay under his playful and racy humour.\r\n\r\nMore untimely, in one sense, than any other was the death of Professor\r\nClifford, whose articles in this Review attracted so much attention,\r\nand I fear that I may add, gave for a season so much offence six or\r\nseven years ago. Cairnes was scarcely fifty when he died, and Bagehot\r\nwas fifty-one, but Clifford was only four-and-thirty. Yet in this\r\nbrief space he had not merely won a reputation as a mathematician of\r\nthe first order, but had made a real mark on his time, both by the\r\nsubstance of his speculations in science, religion, and ethics, and\r\nby the curious audacity with which he proclaimed at the pitch of his\r\nvoice on the housetops religious opinions that had hitherto been kept\r\namong the family secrets of the _domus Socratica_. It is melancholy\r\nto think that exciting work, done under pressure of time of his own\r\nimposing, should have been the chief cause of his premature decline.\r\nHow intense that pressure was the reader may measure by the fact that\r\na paper of his on _The Unseen Universe_, which filled eighteen pages\r\nof the Review, was composed at a single sitting that lasted from a\r\nquarter to ten in the evening till nine o'clock the following morning.\r\nAs one revolves these and other names of eminent men who actively\r\nhelped to make the Review what it has been, it would be impossible to\r\nomit the most eminent of them all. Time has done something to impair\r\nthe philosophical reputation and the political celebrity of J.S. Mill;\r\nbut it cannot alter the affectionate memory in which some of us must\r\nalways hold his wisdom and goodness, his rare union of moral ardour\r\nwith a calm and settled mind. He took the warmest interest In this\r\nReview from the moment when I took it up, partly from the friendship\r\nwith which he honoured me, but much more because he wished to\r\nencourage what was then--though it is now happily no longer--the only\r\nattempt to conduct a periodical on the principles of free discussion\r\nand personal responsibility. While recalling these and others who are\r\nno more, it was naturally impossible for me to forget the constant\r\nand valuable help that has been so freely given to me, often at much\r\nsacrifice of their own convenience, by those friends and contributors\r\nwho are still with us. No conductor ever laid down his _bâton_ with a\r\nmore cordial and sincere sense of gratitude to those who took their\r\nseveral parts in his performance.\r\n\r\nOne chief experiment which the Review was established to try was that\r\nof signed articles. When Mr. Lewes wrote his Farewell Causerie, as I\r\nam doing now, he said: \"That we have been enabled to bring together\r\nmen so various in opinion and so distinguished in power has been\r\nmainly owing to the principle adopted of allowing each writer perfect\r\nfreedom; which could only have been allowed under the condition of\r\npersonal responsibility. The question of signing articles had long\r\nbeen debated; it has now been tested. The arguments in favour of\r\nit were mainly of a moral order; the arguments against it, while\r\nadmitting the morality, mainly asserted its inexpediency. The question\r\nof expediency has, I venture to say, been materially enlightened\r\nby the success of the Review.\" The success of other periodicals,\r\nconducted still more rigorously on the principle that every article\r\nought to bear its writer's signature, leaves no further doubt on the\r\nsubject; so that it is now almost impossible to realise that only\r\nfifteen or sixteen years ago scarcely anybody of the class called\r\npractical could believe that the sacred principle of the Anonymous was\r\ndoomed. One of the shrewdest publishers in Edinburgh, and also himself\r\nthe editor of a famous magazine, once said to me while Mr. Lewes was\r\nstill editor of this Review, that he had always thought highly of our\r\nfriend's judgment \"until he had taken up the senseless notion of\r\na magazine with signed articles and open to both sides of every\r\nquestion.\" Nobody will call the notion senseless any longer. The\r\nquestion is rather how long the exclusively anonymous periodicals will\r\nresist the innovation.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have attached less stern importance to signature as an\r\nunvarying rule than did my predecessor; though, even he was compelled\r\nby obvious considerations of convenience to make his chronique of\r\ncurrent affairs anonymous. Our practice has been signature as the\r\nstanding rule, occasionally suspended in favour of anonymity when\r\nthere seemed to be sufficient reason. On the whole it may be said that\r\nthe change from anonymous to signed articles has followed the course\r\nof most changes. It has not led to one-half either of the evils or of\r\nthe advantages that its advocates and its opponents foretold. That\r\nit has produced some charlatanry, can hardly be denied. Readers are\r\ntempted to postpone serious and persistent interest in subjects, to a\r\nsemi-personal curiosity about the casual and unconnected deliverances\r\nof the literary or social star of the hour. That this conception has\r\nbeen worked out with signal ability in more cases than one; that it\r\nhas made periodical literature full of actuality; that it has tickled\r\nand delighted the palate--is all most true. The obvious danger is lest\r\nwe should be tempted to think more of the man who speaks than of the\r\nprecise value of what he says.\r\n\r\nOne indirect effect that is not unworthy of notice in the new system\r\nis its tendency to narrow the openings for the writer by profession.\r\nIf an article is to be signed, the editor will naturally seek the name\r\nof an expert of special weight and competence on the matter in hand. A\r\nreviewer on the staff of a famous journal once received for his week's\r\ntask, _General Hamley on the Art of War_, a three-volume novel, a work\r\non dainty dishes, and a translation of Pindar. This was perhaps taxing\r\nversatility and omniscience over-much, and it may be taken for granted\r\nthat the writer made no serious contribution to tactics, cookery,\r\nor scholarship. But being a man of a certain intelligence, passably\r\nhonest, and reasonably painstaking, probably he produced reviews\r\nsufficiently useful and just to answer their purpose. On the new\r\nsystem we should have an article on General Hamley's work by Sir\r\nGarnet Wolseley, and one on the cookery-book from M. Trompette. It is\r\nnot certain that this is all pure gain. There is a something to be\r\nsaid for the writer by profession, who, without being an expert, will\r\ntake trouble to work up his subject, to learn what is said and thought\r\nabout it, to penetrate to the real points, to get the same mastery\r\nover it as an advocate or a judge does over a patent case or a suit\r\nabout rubrics and vestments. He is at least as likely as the expert to\r\ntell the reader all that he wants to know, and at least as likely to\r\nbe free from bias and injurious prepossession.\r\n\r\nNor does experience, so far as it has yet gone, quite bear out Mr.\r\nLewes's train of argument that the \"first condition of all writing is\r\nsincerity, and that one means of securing sincerity is to insist on\r\npersonal responsibility,\" and that this personal responsibility\r\ncan only be secured by signing articles. The old talk of \"literary\r\nbravoes,\" \"men in masks,\" \"anonymous assassins,\" and so forth, is out\r\nof date. Longer experience has only confirmed the present writer's\r\nopinion, expressed here from the very beginning: \"Everybody who knows\r\nthe composition of any respectable journal in London knows very well\r\nthat the articles which those of our own way of thinking dislike\r\nmost intensely are written by men whom to call bravoes in any sense\r\nwhatever would be simply monstrous. Let us say, as loudly as we\r\nchoose, if we see good reason, that they are half informed about some\r\nof the things which they so authoritatively discuss; that they are\r\nunder strong class feeling; that they have not mastered the doctrines\r\nwhich they are opposing; that they have not sufficiently meditated\r\ntheir subject; that they have not given themselves time to do justice\r\neven to their scanty knowledge. Journalists are open to charges of\r\nthis kind; but to think of them as a shameless body, thirsting for the\r\nblood of better men than themselves, or ready to act as an editor's\r\ninstrument for money, involves a thoroughly unjust misconception.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the comparative effects of the two systems on literary quality,\r\nno prudent observer with adequate experience will lay down an\r\nunalterable rule. Habit no doubt counts for a great deal, but\r\napart from habit there are differences of temperament and peculiar\r\nsensibilities. Some men write best when they sign what they write;\r\nthey find impersonality a mystification and an incumbrance; anonymity\r\nmakes them stiff, pompous, and over-magisterial. With others,\r\nhowever, the effect is just the reverse. If they sign, they become\r\nself-conscious, stilted, and even pretentious; it is only when they\r\nare anonymous that they recover simplicity and ease. It is as if an\r\nactor who is the soul of what is natural under the disguises of his\r\npart, should become extremely artificial if he were compelled to come\r\nupon the stage in his own proper clothes and speaking only in his\r\nordinary voice.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper press has not yet followed the example of the new\r\nReviews, but we are probably not far from the time when here, too, the\r\npractice of signature will make its way. There was a silly cry at one\r\ntime for making the disuse of anonymity compulsory by law. But we\r\nshall no more see this than we shall see legal penalties imposed\r\nfor publishing a book without an index, though that also has been\r\nsuggested. The same end will be reached by other ways. Within the last\r\nfew years a truly surprising shock has been given to the idea of a\r\nnewspaper, \"as a sort of impersonal thing, coming from nobody knows\r\nwhere, the readers never thinking of the writer, nor caring whether\r\nhe thinks what he writes, so long as _they_ think what he writes.\"\r\nOf course it is still true, and will most likely always remain true,\r\nthat, like the Athenian Sophist, great newspapers will teach the\r\nconventional prejudices of those who pay for it. A writer will long\r\nbe able to say that, like the Sophist, the newspaper reflects the\r\nmorality, the intelligence, the tone of sentiment, of its public, and\r\nif the latter is vicious, so is the former. But there is infinitely\r\nless of this than there used to be. The press is more and more taking\r\nthe tone of a man speaking to a man. The childish imposture of\r\nthe editorial We is already thoroughly exploded. The names of all\r\nimportant journalists are now coming to be as publicly known as the\r\nnames of important members of parliament. There is even something over\r\nand above this. More than one editor has boldly aspired to create\r\nand educate a public of his own, and he has succeeded. The press is\r\ngrowing to be much more personal, in the sense that its most important\r\ndirectors are taking to themselves the right of pursuing an individual\r\nline of their own, with far less respect than of old to the supposed\r\nexigencies of party or the _communiqués_ of political leaders. The\r\neditor of a Review of great eminence said to the present writer (who,\r\nfor his own part, took a slightly more modest view) that he regarded\r\nhimself as equal in importance to seventy-five Members of Parliament.\r\nIt is not altogether easy to weigh and measure with this degree of\r\nprecision. But what is certain is that there are journalists on both\r\nsides in politics to whom the public looks for original suggestion,\r\nand from whom leading politicians seek not merely such mechanical\r\nsupport as they expect from their adherents in the House of Commons,\r\nnor merely the uses of the vane to show which way the wind blows, but\r\nideas, guidance, and counsel, as from persons of co-equal authority\r\nwith themselves. England is still a long way from the point at which\r\nFrench journalism has arrived in this matter. We cannot count an\r\neffective host of Girardins, Lemoinnes, Abouts, or even Cassagnacs and\r\nRocheforts, each recognised as the exponent of his own opinions, and\r\neach read because the opinions written are known to be his own. But\r\nthere is a distinctly nearer approach to this as the general state of\r\nEnglish journalism than there was twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nOf course nobody of sense supposes that any journalist, however\r\nindependent and however possessed by the spirit of his personal\r\nresponsibility, tries to form his opinions out of his own head,\r\nwithout reference to the view of the men practically engaged in public\r\naffairs, the temper of Parliament and the feeling of constituencies,\r\nand so forth. All these are part of the elements that go to the\r\nformation of his own judgment, and he will certainly not neglect to\r\nfind out as much about them as he possibly can. Nor, again, does the\r\nincrease of the personal sentiment about our public prints lessen the\r\ngeneral working fidelity of their conductors to a party. It is their\r\nduty, no doubt, to discuss the merits of measures as they arise. In\r\nthis respect any one can see how radically they differ from the Member\r\nof Parliament, whose business is not only to discuss but to act. The\r\nMember of Parliament must look at the effect of his vote in more\r\nlights than one. Besides the merits of the given measure, it is his\r\nduty to think of the wishes of those who chose him to represent them;\r\nand if, moreover, the effect of voting against a measure of which\r\nhe disapproves would be to overthrow a whole Ministry of which he\r\nstrongly approves, then, unless some very vital principle indeed were\r\ninvolved, to give such a vote would be to prefer a small object to\r\na great one, and would indicate a very queasy monkish sort of\r\nconscience. The journalist is not in the same position. He is an\r\nobserver and a critic, and can afford, and is bound, to speak the\r\ntruth. But even in his case, the disagreement, as Burke said, \"will\r\nbe only enough to indulge freedom, without violating concord or\r\ndisturbing arrangement.\" There is a certain \"partiality which becomes\r\na well-chosen friendship.\" \"Men thinking freely will, in particular\r\ninstances, think differently. But still as the greater part of the\r\nmeasures which arise in the course of public business are related to,\r\nor dependent on, some great leading general principles in government,\r\na man must be peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his political\r\ncompany if he does not agree with them at least nine times in ten.\"\r\nThe doctrine that was good enough for Burke in this matter may be\r\ncounted good enough for most of us. Some of the current talk about\r\npolitical independence is mere hypocrisy; some of it is mere vanity.\r\nFor the new priest of Literature is quite as liable to the defects of\r\nspiritual pride and ambition as the old priest of the Church, and it\r\nis quite as well for him that he should be on his guard against these\r\nscarlet and high-crested sins.\r\n\r\nThe success of Reviews, of which our own was the first English type,\r\nmarks a very considerable revolution in the intellectual habits of the\r\ntime. They have brought abstract discussion from the library down to\r\nthe parlour, and from the serious student down to the first man in\r\nthe street. We have passed through a perfect cyclone of religious\r\npolemics. The popularity of such Reviews means that really large\r\naudiences, _le gros public_, are eagerly interested In the radical\r\ndiscussion of propositions which twenty years ago were only publicly\r\nmaintained, and then in their crudest, least true, and most repulsive\r\nform, in obscure debating societies and little secularist clubs.\r\nEverybody, male or female, who reads anything serious at all, now\r\nreads a dozen essays a year to show, with infinite varieties of\r\napproach and of demonstration, that we can never know whether there be\r\na Supreme Being or not, whether the soul survives the body, or whether\r\nmind is more and other than a mere function of matter. No article\r\nthat has appeared in any periodical for a generation back excited so\r\nprofound a sensation as Mr. Huxley's memorable paper On the Physical\r\nBasis of Life, published in this Review in February 1869. It created\r\njust the same kind of stir that, in a political epoch, was made by\r\nsuch a pamphlet as the _Conduct of the Allies_ or the _Reflections on\r\nthe French Revolution_. This excitement was a sign that controversies\r\nwhich had hitherto been confined to books and treatises were now to be\r\nadmitted to popular periodicals, and that the common man of the world\r\nwould now listen and have an opinion of his own on the bases of\r\nbelief, just as he listens and judges in politics or art, or letters.\r\nThe clergy no longer have the pulpit to themselves, for the new\r\nReviews became more powerful pulpits, in which heretics were at least\r\nas welcome as orthodox. Speculation has become entirely democratised.\r\nThis is a tremendous change to have come about in little more than a\r\ndozen years. How far it goes, let us not be too sure. It is no new\r\ndiscovery that what looks like complete tolerance may be in reality\r\nonly complete indifference. Intellectual fairness is often only\r\nanother name for indolence and inconclusiveness of mind, just as love\r\nof truth is sometimes a fine phrase for temper. To be piquant counts\r\nfor much, and the interest of seeing on the drawing-room tables of\r\ndevout Catholics and high-flying Anglicans article after article,\r\nsending divinities, creeds, and Churches all headlong into limbo, was\r\nindeed piquant. Much of all this elegant dabbling in infidelity has\r\nbeen a caprice of fashion. The Agnostic has had his day with the fine\r\nladies, like the black footboy of other times, or the spirit-rapper\r\nand table-turner of our own. What we have been watching, after all,\r\nwas perhaps a tournament, not a battle.\r\n\r\nIt would not be very easy for us now, and perhaps it would not be\r\nparticularly becoming at any time, to analyse the position that has\r\nbeen assigned to this Review in common esteem. Those who have watched\r\nit from without can judge better than those who have worked within.\r\nThough it has been open, so far as editorial goodwill was concerned,\r\nto opinions from many sides, the Review has unquestionably gathered\r\nround it some of the associations of sect. What that sect is, people\r\nhave found it difficult to describe with anything like precision. For\r\na long time it was the fashion to label the Review as Comtist, and\r\nit would be singularly ungrateful to deny that it has had no more\r\neffective contributors than some of the best-known disciples of Comte.\r\nBy-and-by it was felt that this was too narrow. It was nearer the\r\ntruth to call it the organ of Positivists in the wider sense of that\r\ndesignation. But even this would not cover many directly political\r\narticles that have appeared in our pages, and made a mark in their\r\ntime. The memorable programme of Free Labour, Free Land, Free Schools,\r\nFree Church had nothing at all Positivist about it. Nor could that\r\nprogramme and many besides from the same pen and others be compressed\r\nunder the nickname of Academic Liberalism. There was too strong a\r\nflavour of action for the academic and the philosophic. This passion\r\nfor a label, after all, is an infirmity. Yet people justly perceived\r\nthat there seemed to be a certain undefinable concurrence among\r\nwriters coming from different schools and handling very different\r\nsubjects. Perhaps the instinct was right which fancied that it\r\ndiscerned some common drift, a certain pervading atmosphere, and\r\nscented a subtle connection between speculations on the Physical Basis\r\nof Life and the Unseen Universe, and articles on Trades Unions and\r\nNational Education.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Review has been more specially identified with one set\r\nof opinions than another, it has been due to the fact that a certain\r\ndissent from received theologies has been found in company with new\r\nideas of social and political reform. This suspicious combination at\r\none time aroused considerable anger. The notion of anything like an\r\nintervention of the literary and scientific class in political affairs\r\ntouched a certain jealousy which is always to be looked for in the\r\npositive and practical man. They think as Napoleon thought of men of\r\nletters and savans:--\"Ce sont des coquettes avec lesquelles il faut\r\nentretenir un commerce de galanterie, et dont il ne faut jamais songer\r\nà faire ni sa femme ni son ministre.\" Men will listen to your views\r\nabout the Unknowable with a composure that instantly disappears if\r\nyour argument comes too near to the Rates and Taxes. It is amusing, as\r\nwe read the newspapers to-day, to think that Mr. Harrison's powerful\r\ndefence of Trades Unions fifteen years ago caused the Review to be\r\nregarded as an incendiary publication. Some papers that appeared here\r\non National Education were thought to indicate a deliberate plot for\r\nsuppressing the Holy Scriptures in the land. Extravagant misjudgment\r\nof this kind has passed away. But it was far from being a mistake to\r\nsuppose that the line taken here by many writers did mean that there\r\nwas a new Radicalism in the air, which went a good deal deeper than\r\nfidgeting about an estimate or the amount of the Queen's contribution\r\nto her own taxes. Time has verified what was serious in those early\r\napprehensions. Principles and aims are coming into prominence in the\r\nsocial activity of to-day which would hardly have found a hearing\r\ntwenty years ago, and it would be sufficient justification for the\r\npast of our Review if some writers in it have been instrumental in the\r\nprocess of showing how such principles and aims meet the requirements\r\nof the new time. Reformers must always be open to the taunt that they\r\nfind nothing in the world good enough for them. \"You write,\" said a\r\npopular novelist to one of this unthanked tribe, \"as if you believed\r\nthat everything is bad.\" \"Nay,\" said the other, \"but I do believe that\r\neverything might be better.\" Such a belief naturally breeds a spirit\r\nwhich the easy-goers of the world resent as a spirit of ceaseless\r\ncomplaint and scolding. Hence our Liberalism here has often been\r\ntaxed with being ungenial, discontented, and even querulous. But such\r\nLiberals will wrap themselves in their own virtue, remembering the\r\ncheering apophthegm that \"those who are dissatisfied are the sole\r\nbenefactors of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis will not be found, I think, too lofty, or too thrasonical an\r\nestimate of what has been attempted. A certain number of people have\r\nbeen persuaded to share opinions that fifteen years ago were more\r\nunpopular than they are now. A certain resistance has been offered to\r\nthe stubborn influence of prejudice and use and wont. The original\r\nscheme of the Review, even if there had been no other obstacle,\r\nprevented it from being the organ of a systematic and constructive\r\npolicy. There is not, in fact, a body of systematic political thought\r\nat work in our own day. The Liberals of the Benthamite school surveyed\r\nsociety and institutions as a whole; they connected their advocacy of\r\npolitical and legal changes with carefully formed theories of human\r\nnature; they considered the great art of Government in connection with\r\nthe character of man, his proper education, his potential capacities.\r\nYet, as we then said, it cannot be pretended that we are less in need\r\nof systematic politics than our fathers were sixty years since, or\r\nthat general principles are now more generally settled even among\r\nmembers of the same party than they were then. The perplexities of\r\nto-day are as embarrassing as any in our history, and they may prove\r\neven more dangerous. The renovation of Parliamentary government; the\r\ntransformation of the conditions of the ownership and occupation of\r\nland; the relations between the Government at home and our adventurers\r\nabroad in contact with inferior races; the limitations on free\r\ncontract and the rights of majorities to restrict the private acts\r\nof minorities; these are only some of the questions that time and\r\ncircumstances are pressing upon us. These are in the political and\r\nlegislative sphere alone. In Education, in Economics, the problems are\r\nas many. Yet ideas are hardly ripe for realisation. We shall need\r\nto see great schools before we can make sure of powerful parties.\r\nMeanwhile, whatever gives freedom and variety to thought, and\r\nearnestness to men's interest in the world, must contribute to a good\r\nend.",
