BAKER, at the _Black\r\n  Boy_ in _Paternoster-Row_.\r\n  1715.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope the time is come at last when the voice of moderate principles\r\nmay be heard. Hitherto the noise has been so great, and the prejudices\r\nand passions of men so strong, that it had been but in vain to offer at\r\nany argument, or for any man to talk of giving a reason for his actions;\r\nand this alone has been the cause why, when other men, who, I think,\r\nhave less to say in their own defence, are appealing to the public, and\r\nstruggling to defend themselves, I alone have been silent under the\r\ninfinite clamours and reproaches, causeless curses, unusual\r\nthreatenings, and the most unjust and injurious treatment in the world.\r\n\r\nI hear much of people's calling out to punish the guilty, but very few\r\nare concerned to clear the innocent. I hope some will be inclined to\r\njudge impartially, and have yet reserved so much of the Christian as to\r\nbelieve, and at least to hope, that a rational creature cannot abandon\r\nhimself so as to act without some reason, and are willing not only to\r\nhave me defend myself, but to be able to answer for me where they hear\r\nme causelessly insulted by others, and, therefore, are willing to have\r\nsuch just arguments put into their mouths as the cause will bear.\r\n\r\nAs for those who are prepossessed, and according to the modern justice\r\nof parties are resolved to be so, let them go; I am not arguing with\r\nthem, but against them; they act so contrary to justice, to reason, to\r\nreligion, so contrary to the rules of Christians and of good manners,\r\nthat they are not to be argued with, but to be exposed, or entirely\r\nneglected. I have a receipt against all the uneasiness which it may be\r\nsupposed to give me, and that is, to contemn slander, and think it not\r\nworth the least concern; neither should I think it worth while to give\r\nany answer to it, if it were not on some other accounts of which I shall\r\nspeak as I go on. If any young man ask me why I am in such haste to\r\npublish this matter at this time, among many other good reasons which I\r\ncould give, these are some:--\r\n\r\n1. I think I have long enough been made _Fabula Vulgi_, and borne the\r\nweight of general slander; and I should be wanting to truth, to my\r\nfamily, and to myself, if I did not give a fair and true state of my\r\nconduct, for impartial men to judge of, when I am no more in being to\r\nanswer for myself.\r\n\r\n2. By the hints of mortality, and by the infirmities of a life of sorrow\r\nand fatigue, I have reason to think I am not a great way off from, if\r\nnot very near to, the great ocean of eternity, and the time may not be\r\nlong ere I embark on the last voyage. Wherefore, I think I should even\r\naccounts with this world before I go, that no actions (slanders) may lie\r\nagainst my heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, to disturb\r\nthem in the peaceable possession of their father's (character)\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n3. I fear--God grant I have not a second-sight in it--that this lucid\r\ninterval of temper and moderation, which shines, though dimly too, upon\r\nus at this time, will be but of short continuance, and that some men,\r\nwho know not how to use the advantage God has put into their hands with\r\nmoderation, will push, in spite of the best prince in the world, at such\r\nextravagant things, and act with such an intemperate forwardness, as\r\nwill revive the heats and animosities which wise and good men were in\r\nhopes should be allayed by the happy accession of the king to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nIt is and ever was my opinion, that moderation is the only virtue by\r\nwhich the peace and tranquillity of this nation can be preserved. Even\r\nthe king himself--I believe his majesty will allow me that freedom--can\r\nonly be happy in the enjoyment of the crown by a moderative\r\nadministration. If his majesty should be obliged, contrary to his known\r\ndisposition, to join with intemperate councils, if it does not lessen\r\nhis security, I am persuaded it will lessen his satisfaction. It cannot\r\nbe pleasant or agreeable, and I think it cannot be safe, to any just\r\nprince, to rule over a divided people, split into incensed and\r\nexasperated parties. Though a skilful mariner may have courage to master\r\na tempest, and goes fearless through a storm, yet he can never be said\r\nto delight in the danger; a fresh, fair gale, and a quiet sea, is the\r\npleasure of his voyage, and we have a saying worth notice to them that\r\nare otherwise minded, _Qui amat periculum, periebat in illo_.\r\n\r\nTo attain at the happy calm, which, as I say, is the safety of Britain,\r\nis the question which should now move us all; and he would merit to be\r\ncalled the nation's physician that could prescribe the specific for it.\r\nI think I may be allowed to say, a conquest of parties will never do it;\r\na balance of parties may. Some are for the former; they talk high of\r\npunishments, letting blood, revenging the treatment they have met with,\r\nand the like. If they, not knowing what spirit they are of, think this\r\nthe course to be taken, let them try their hands; I shall give them up\r\nfor lost, and look for their downfall from that time; for the ruin of\r\nall such tempers slumbereth not.\r\n\r\nIt is many years that I have professed myself an enemy to all\r\nprecipitations in public administrations; and often I have attempted to\r\nshow, that hot councils have ever been destructive to those who have\r\nmade use of them. Indeed, they have not always been a disadvantage to\r\nthe nation, as in king James II.'s reign, when, as I have often said in\r\nprint, his precipitation was the safety of us all: and if he had\r\nproceeded temperately and politicly, we had been undone. _Felix quem\r\nfaciunt._\r\n\r\nBut these things have been spoken when your ferment has been too high\r\nfor anything to be heard; whether you will hear it now or no, I know\r\nnot; and therefore it was that I said, I fear the present cessation of\r\nparty arms will not hold long. These are some of the reasons why I think\r\nthis is the proper juncture for me to give some account of myself, and\r\nof my past conduct to the world; and that I may do this as effectually\r\nas I can, being perhaps never more to speak from the press, I shall, as\r\nconcisely as I can, give an abridgment of my own history during the few\r\nunhappy years I have employed myself, or been employed, in public in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes in business having unhinged me from matters of trade, it was\r\nabout the year 1694 when I was invited by some merchants, with whom I\r\nhad corresponded abroad, and some also at home, to settle at Cadiz, in\r\nSpain, and that with offers of very good commissions. But Providence,\r\nwhich had other work for me to do, placed a secret aversion in my mind\r\nto quitting England upon any account, and made me refuse the best offers\r\nof that kind, to be concerned with some eminent persons at home in\r\nproposing ways and means to the government, for raising money to supply\r\nthe occasions of the war then newly begun. Some time after this I was,\r\nwithout the least application of mine, and being then seventy miles from\r\nLondon, sent for to be accountant to the commissioners of the glass\r\nduty, in which service I continued to the determination of their\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nDuring this time there came out a vile abhorred pamphlet in very ill\r\nverse, written by one Mr. Tutchin, and called The Foreigners, in which\r\nthe author--who he was I then knew not--fell personally upon the king\r\nhimself, and then upon the Dutch nation; and after having reproached his\r\nmajesty with crimes that his worst enemy could not think of without\r\nhorror, he sums up all in the odious name of FOREIGNER.\r\n\r\nThis filled me with a kind of rage against the book, and gave birth to a\r\ntrifle, which I never could hope should have met with so general an\r\nacceptation as it did; I mean The True-born Englishman. How this poem\r\nwas the occasion of my being known to his majesty; how I was afterwards\r\nreceived by him; how employed; and how, above my capacity of deserving,\r\nrewarded, is no part of the present case, and is only mentioned here, as\r\nI take all occasions to do, for the expressing the honour I ever\r\npreserved for the immortal and glorious memory of that greatest and best\r\nof princes, and whom it was my honour and advantage to call master, as\r\nwell as sovereign; whose goodness to me I never forgot, neither can\r\nforget; and whose memory I never patiently heard abused, nor ever can do\r\nso; and who, had he lived, would never have suffered me to be treated as\r\nI have been in the world. But Heaven for our sins removed him in\r\njudgment. How far the treatment he met with from the nation he came to\r\nsave, and whose deliverance he finished, was admitted by Heaven to be a\r\nmeans of his death, I desire to forget for their sakes who are guilty;\r\nand if this calls any of it to mind, it is mentioned to move them to\r\ntreat him better who is now, with like principles of goodness and\r\nclemency, appointed by God and the constitution to be their sovereign,\r\nlest He that protects righteous princes avenge the injuries they receive\r\nfrom an ungrateful people by giving them up to the confusions their\r\nmadness leads them to.\r\n\r\nAnd in their just acclamations at the happy accession of his present\r\nmajesty to the throne, I cannot but advise them to look back and call to\r\nmind who it was that first guided them to the family of Hanover, and to\r\npass by all the popish branches of Orleans and Savoy; recognising the\r\njust authority of parliament in the undoubted right of limiting the\r\nsuccession, and establishing that glorious maxim of our settlement,\r\nviz., that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant\r\nkingdom to be governed by a popish prince. I say, let them call to mind\r\nwho it was that guided their thoughts first to the protestant race of\r\nour own kings in the house of Hanover; and that it is to king William,\r\nnext to Heaven itself, to whom we owe the enjoying a protestant king at\r\nthis time. I need not go back to the particulars of his majesty's\r\nconduct in that affair; his journey in person to the country of Hanover\r\nand the court of Zell; his particular management of the affair\r\nafterwards at home, perfecting the design by naming the illustrious\r\nfamily to the nation, and bringing about a parliamentary settlement to\r\neffect it; entailing the crown thereby in so effectual a manner as we\r\nsee has been sufficient to prevent the worst designs of our Jacobite\r\npeople in behalf of the pretender; a settlement, together with the\r\nsubsequent acts which followed it, and the Union with Scotland, which\r\nmade it unalterable, that gave a complete satisfaction to those who knew\r\nand understood it, and removed those terrible apprehensions of the\r\npretender (which some entertained) from the minds of others, who were\r\nyet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be. Upon this\r\nsettlement, as I shall show presently, I grounded my opinion, which I\r\noften expressed, viz., that I did not see it possible the Jacobites\r\ncould ever set up their idol here, and I think my opinion abundantly\r\njustified in the consequences; of which by and by.\r\n\r\nThis digression, as a debt to the glorious memory of king William, I\r\ncould not in justice omit; and as the reign of his present majesty is\r\nesteemed happy, and looked upon as a blessing from heaven by us, it will\r\nmost necessarily lead us to bless the memory of king William, to whom we\r\nowe so much of it. How easily could his majesty have led us to other\r\nbranches, whose relation to the crown might have had large pretences!\r\nWhat prince but would have submitted to have educated a successor of his\r\nrace in the protestant religion for the sake of such a crown? But the\r\nking, who had our happiness in view, and saw as far into it as any human\r\nsight could penetrate; who knew we were not to be governed by\r\ninexperienced youths; that the protestant religion was not to be\r\nestablished by political converts; and that princes, under French\r\ninfluence, or instructed in French politics, were not proper instruments\r\nto preserve the liberties of Britain, fixed his eyes upon the family\r\nwhich now possesses the crown, as not only having an undoubted relation\r\nto it by blood, but as being first and principally zealous and powerful\r\nasserters of the protestant religion and interest against popery; and,\r\nsecondly, stored with a visible succession of worthy and promising\r\nbranches, who appeared equal to the weight of government, qualified to\r\nfill a throne and guide a nation, which, without reflection, are not\r\nfamed to be the most easy to rule in the world.\r\n\r\nWhether the consequence has been a credit to king William's judgment I\r\nneed not say. I am not writing panegyrics here, but doing justice to\r\nthe memory of the king my master, whom I have had the honour very often\r\nto hear express himself with great satisfaction in having brought the\r\nsettlement of the succession to so good an issue; and, to repeat his\r\nmajesty's own words, that he knew no prince in Europe so fit to be king\r\nof England as the elector of Hanover. I am persuaded, without any\r\nflattery, that if it should not every way answer the expectations his\r\nmajesty had of it, the fault will be our own. God grant the king may\r\nhave more comfort of his crown than we suffered king William to have!\r\n\r\nThe king being dead, and the queen proclaimed, the hot men of that side,\r\nas the hot men of all sides do, thinking the game in their own hands,\r\nand all other people under their feet, began to run out into those mad\r\nextremes, and precipitate themselves into such measures as, according to\r\nthe fate of all intemperate councils, ended in their own confusion, and\r\nthrew them at last out of the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe queen, who, though willing to favour the high-church party, did not\r\nthereby design the ruin of those whom she did not employ, was soon\r\nalarmed at their wild conduct, and turned them out, adhering to the\r\nmoderate counsels of those who better understood, or more faithfully\r\npursued, her majesty's and the country's interest. In this turn fell sir\r\nEdward Seymour's party, for so the high men were then called; and to\r\nthis turn we owe the conversion of several other great men, who became\r\nwhigs on that occasion, which it is known they were not before; which\r\nconversion afterwards begat that unkind distinction of old whig and\r\nmodern whig, which some of the former were with very little justice\r\npleased to run up afterwards to an extreme very pernicious to both.\r\n\r\nBut I am gone too far in this part. I return to my own story.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of these things, and during the heat of the first fury\r\nof highflying, I fell a sacrifice for writing against the rage and\r\nmadness of that high party, and in the service of the dissenters. What\r\njustice I met with, and, above all, what mercy, is too well known to\r\nneed repetition.\r\n\r\nThis introduction is made that it may bring me to what has been the\r\nfoundation of all my further concern in public affairs, and will produce\r\na sufficient reason for my adhering to those whose obligations upon me\r\nwere too strong to be resisted, even when many things were done by them\r\nwhich I could not approve; and for this reason it is that I think it\r\nnecessary to distinguish how far I did or did not adhere to, or join in\r\nor with, the persons or conduct of the late government; and those who\r\nare willing to judge with impartiality and charity, will see reason to\r\nuse me the more tenderly in their thoughts, when they weigh the\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nI will make no reflections upon the treatment I met with from the people\r\nI suffered for, or how I was abandoned even in my sufferings, at the\r\nsame time that they acknowledged the service I had been to their cause;\r\nbut I must mention it to let you know that while I lay friendless and\r\ndistressed in the prison of Newgate, my family ruined, and myself\r\nwithout hope of deliverance, a message was brought me from a person of\r\nhonour, who, till that time, I had never had the least acquaintance\r\nwith, or knowledge of, other than by fame, or by sight, as we know men\r\nof quality by seeing them on public occasions. I gave no present answer\r\nto the person who brought it, having not duly weighed the import of the\r\nmessage. The message was by word of mouth thus:--\"Pray, ask that\r\ngentleman what I can do for him?\" But in return to this kind and\r\ngenerous message, I immediately took my pen and ink, and wrote the story\r\nof the blind man in the gospel, who followed our Saviour, and to whom\r\nour blessed Lord put the question, \"What wilt thou that I should do unto\r\nthee?\" Who, as if he had made it strange that such a question should be\r\nasked, or as if he had said that I am blind, and yet ask me what thou\r\nshalt do for me? My answer is plain in my misery, \"Lord, that I may\r\nreceive my sight?\"\r\n\r\nI needed not to make the application. And from this time, although I lay\r\nfour months in prison after this, and heard no more of it, yet from this\r\ntime, as I learned afterwards, this noble person made it his business to\r\nhave my case represented to her majesty, and methods taken for my\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nI mention this part, because I am no more to forget the obligation upon\r\nme to the queen, than to my first benefactor.\r\n\r\nWhen her majesty came to have the truth of the case laid before her, I\r\nsoon felt the effects of her royal goodness and compassion. And first,\r\nher majesty declared, that she left all that matter to a certain person,\r\nand did not think he would have used me in such a manner. Probably these\r\nwords may seem imaginary to some, and the speaking them to be of no\r\nvalue, and so they would have been had they not been followed with\r\nfurther and more convincing proofs of what they imported, which were\r\nthese, that her majesty was pleased particularly to inquire into my\r\ncircumstances and family, and by my lord treasurer Godolphin to send a\r\nconsiderable supply to my wife and family, and to send to me the prison\r\nmoney to pay my fine and the expenses of my discharge. Whether this be\r\na just foundation let my enemies judge. Here is the foundation on which\r\nI built my first sense of duty to her majesty's person, and the\r\nindelible bond of gratitude to my first benefactor.\r\n\r\nGratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man. But, to be\r\nthus obliged by a stranger, by a man of quality and honour, and after\r\nthat by the sovereign under whose administration I was suffering, let\r\nany one put himself in my stead, and examine upon what principles I\r\ncould ever act against either such a queen, or such a benefactor; and\r\nwhat must my own heart reproach me with, what blushes must have covered\r\nmy face when I had looked in, and called myself ungrateful to him that\r\nsaved me thus from distress, or her that fetched me out of the dungeon,\r\nand gave my family relief? Let any man who knows what principles are,\r\nwhat engagements of honour and gratitude are, make his case his own, and\r\nsay what I could have done more or less than I have done.\r\n\r\nI must go on a little with the detail of the obligation, and then I\r\nshall descend to relate what I have done, and what I have not done, in\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nBeing delivered from the distress I was in, her majesty, who was not\r\nsatisfied to do me good by a single act of her bounty, had the goodness\r\nto think of taking me into her service, and I had the honour to be\r\nemployed in several honourable, though secret services, by the\r\ninterposition of my first benefactor, who then appeared as a member in\r\nthe public administration.\r\n\r\nI had the happiness to discharge myself in all these trusts so much to\r\nthe satisfaction of those who employed me, though oftentimes with\r\ndifficulty and danger, that my lord treasurer Godolphin, whose memory I\r\nhave always honoured, was pleased to continue his favour to me, and to\r\ndo me all good offices with her majesty, even after an unhappy breach\r\nhad separated him from my first benefactor, the particulars of which may\r\nnot be improper to relate; and as it is not an injustice to any, so I\r\nhope it will not be offensive.\r\n\r\nWhen, upon that fatal breach, the secretary of state was dismissed from\r\nthe service, I looked upon myself as lost; it being a general rule in\r\nsuch cases, when a great officer falls, that all who came in by his\r\ninterest fall with him; and resolving never to abandon the fortunes of\r\nthe man to whom I owed so much of my own, I quitted the usual\r\napplications which I had made to my lord treasurer.\r\n\r\nBut my generous benefactor, when he understood it, frankly told me that\r\nI should by no means do so; \"For,\" said he, in the most engaging terms,\r\n\"my lord treasurer will employ you in nothing but what is for the public\r\nservice, and agreeably to your own sentiments of things; and besides, it\r\nis the queen you are serving, who has been very good to you. Pray, apply\r\nyourself as you used to do; I shall not take it ill from you in the\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, I went to wait on my lord-treasurer, who received me with\r\ngreat freedom, and told me, smiling, he had not seen me a long while. I\r\ntold his lordship very frankly the occasion--that the unhappy breach\r\nthat had fallen out made me doubtful whether I should be acceptable to\r\nhis lordship. That I knew it was usual when great persons fall, that all\r\nwho were in their interest fell with them. That his lordship knew the\r\nobligations I was under, and that I could not but fear my interest in\r\nhis lordship was lessened on that account. \"Not at all, Mr. De Foe,\"\r\nreplied his lordship, \"I always think a man honest till I find to the\r\ncontrary.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, I attended his lordship as usual; and being resolved to\r\nremove all possible ground of suspicion that I kept any secret\r\ncorrespondence, I never visited, or wrote to, or any way corresponded\r\nwith my principal benefactor for above three years; which he so well\r\nknew the reason of, and so well approved that punctual behaviour in me,\r\nthat he never took it ill from me at all.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this reception, my lord Godolphin had the goodness not\r\nonly to introduce me for the second time to her majesty, and to the\r\nhonour of kissing her hand, but obtained for me the continuance of an\r\nappointment which her majesty had been pleased to make me, in\r\nconsideration of a formal special service I had done, and in which I had\r\nrun as much risk of my life as a grenadier upon the counterscarp; and\r\nwhich appointment, however, was first obtained for me at the\r\nintercession of my said first benefactor, and is all owing to that\r\nintercession and her majesty's bounty. Upon this second introduction,\r\nher majesty was pleased to tell me, with a goodness peculiar to herself,\r\nthat she had such satisfaction in my former services, that she had\r\nappointed me for another affair, which was something nice, and that my\r\nlord treasurer should tell me the rest; and so I withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe next day, his lordship having commanded me to attend, told me that\r\nhe must send me to Scotland, and gave me but three days to prepare\r\nmyself. Accordingly, I went to Scotland, where neither my business, nor\r\nthe manner of my discharging it, is material to this tract; nor will it\r\nbe ever any part of my character that I reveal what should be concealed.\r\nAnd yet, my errand was such as was far from being unfit for a sovereign\r\nto direct, or an honest man to perform; and the service I did upon that\r\noccasion, as it is not unknown to the greatest man now in the nation\r\nunder the king and the prince, so, I dare say, his grace was never\r\ndispleased with the part I had in it, and I hope will not forget it.\r\n\r\nThese things I mention upon this account, and no other, viz., to state\r\nthe obligation I have been in all along to her majesty personally, and\r\nto my first benefactor principally; by which I say, I think I was at\r\nleast obliged not to act against them, even in those things which I\r\nmight not approve. Whether I have acted with them further than I ought,\r\nshall be spoken of by itself.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much of the obligations laid on me, and the persons by\r\nwhom, I have this only to add, that I think no man will say, a subject\r\ncould be under greater bonds to his prince, or a private person to a\r\nminister of state; and I shall ever preserve this principle, that an\r\nhonest man cannot be ungrateful to his benefactor.\r\n\r\nBut let no man run away now with the notion, that I am now intending to\r\nplead the obligation that was laid upon me from her majesty, or from any\r\nother person, to justify my doing anything that is not otherwise to be\r\njustified in itself.\r\n\r\nNothing would be more injurious than such a construction; and therefore\r\nI capitulate for so much justice as to explain myself by this\r\ndeclaration, viz., that I only speak of those obligations as binding me\r\nto a negative conduct, not to fly in the face of, or concern myself in\r\ndisputes with those to whom I was under such obligations, although I\r\nmight not, in my judgment, join in many things that were done. No\r\nobligation could excuse me in calling evil good, or good evil; but I am\r\nof the opinion, that I might justly think myself obliged to defend what\r\nI thought was to be defended, and to be silent in anything which I might\r\nthink was not.\r\n\r\nIf this is a crime, I must plead guilty, and give in the history of my\r\nobligation above mentioned as an extenuation at least, if not a\r\njustification of my conduct.\r\n\r\nSuppose a man's father was guilty of several things unlawful and\r\nunjustifiable; a man may heartily detest the unjustifiable thing, and\r\nyet it ought not to be expected that he should expose his father. I\r\nthink the case on my side exactly the same, nor can the duty to a parent\r\nbe more strongly obliging than the obligation laid on me; but I must\r\nallow the case on the other side not the same.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to the affirmative, and inquire what the matters of\r\nfact are; what I have done, or have not done, on account of these\r\nobligations which I am under.\r\n\r\nIt is a general suggestion, and is affirmed with such assurance, that\r\nthey tell me it is in vain to contradict it, that I have been employed\r\nby the earl of Oxford, late lord treasurer, in the late disputes about\r\npublic affairs, to write for him, or, to put it into their own\r\nparticulars, have written by his directions taken the materials from\r\nhim, been dictated to or instructed by him, or by other persons from\r\nhim, by his order, and the like; and that I have received a pension, or\r\nsalary, or payment from his lordship for such services as these. It was\r\nimpossible, since these things have been so confidently affirmed, but\r\nthat, if I could put it into words that would more fully express the\r\nmeaning of these people, I profess I would do it. One would think that\r\nsome evidence might be produced, some facts might appear, some one or\r\nother might be found that could speak of certain knowledge. To say\r\nthings have been carried too closely to be discovered, is saying\r\nnothing, for then they must own that it is not discovered; and how then\r\ncan they affirm it as they do, with such an assurance as nothing ought\r\nto be affirmed by honest men, unless they were able to prove it?\r\n\r\nTo speak, then, to the fact. Were the reproach upon me only in this\r\nparticular, I should not mention it. I should not think it a reproach to\r\nbe directed by a man to whom the queen had at that time entrusted the\r\nadministration of the government. But, as it is a reproach upon his\r\nlordship, justice requires that I do right in this case. The thing is\r\ntrue or false. I would recommend it to those who would be called honest\r\nmen, to consider but one thing, viz., what if it should not be true? Can\r\nthey justify the injury done to that person, or to any person concerned?\r\nIf it cannot be proved, if no vestiges appear to ground it upon, how can\r\nthey charge men upon rumours and reports, and join to run down men's\r\ncharacters by the stream of clamour?\r\n\r\n  _Sed quo rapit impetus undæ._\r\n\r\nIn answer to the charge, I bear witness to posterity, that every part of\r\nit is false and forged. And I do solemnly protest, in the fear and\r\npresence of Him that shall judge us all, both the slanderers and the\r\nslandered, that I have not received any instructions, directions,\r\norders, or let them call it what they will, of that kind, for the\r\nwriting of any part of what I have written, or any materials for the\r\nputting together for the forming any book or pamphlet whatsoever, from\r\nthe said earl of Oxford, late lord treasurer, or from any person by his\r\norder or direction, since the time that the late earl of Godolphin was\r\nlord treasurer. Neither did I ever show, or cause to be shown to his\r\nlordship, for his approbation, correction, alteration, or for any other\r\ncause, any book, paper, or pamphlet which I have written and published,\r\nbefore the same was worked off at the press and published.\r\n\r\nIf any man living can detect me of the least prevarication in this, or\r\nin any part of it, I desire him to do it by all means; and I challenge\r\nall the world to do it. And if they cannot, then I appeal, as in my\r\ntitle, to the honour and justice of my worst enemies, to know upon what\r\nfoundation of truth or conscience they can affirm these things, and for\r\nwhat it is that I bear these reproaches.\r\n\r\nIn all my writing, I ever capitulated for my liberty to speak according\r\nto my own judgment of things; I ever had that liberty allowed me, nor\r\nwas I ever imposed upon to write this way or that against my judgment by\r\nany person whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI come now historically to the point of time when my lord Godolphin was\r\ndismissed from his employment, and the late unhappy division broke out\r\nat court. I waited on my lord the day he was displaced, and humbly asked\r\nhis lordship's direction what course I should take? His lordship's\r\nanswer was, \"that he had the same goodwill to assist me, but not the\r\nsame power; that I was the queen's servant, and that all he had done for\r\nme was by her majesty's special and particular direction; and that\r\nwhoever should succeed him, it was not material to me; he supposed I\r\nshould be employed in nothing relating to the present differences. My\r\nbusiness was to wait till I saw things settled, and then apply myself to\r\nthe ministers of state, to receive her majesty's commands from them.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me immediately, as a principle for my conduct, that it\r\nwas not material to me what ministers her majesty was pleased to employ;\r\nmy duty was to go along with every ministry, so far as they did not\r\nbreak in upon the constitution, and the laws and liberties of my\r\ncountry; my part being only the duty of a subject, viz., to submit to\r\nall lawful commands, and to enter into no service which was not\r\njustifiable by the laws; to all which I have exactly obliged myself.\r\n\r\nBy this, I was providentially cast back upon my original benefactor,\r\nwho, according to his wonted goodness, was pleased to lay my case before\r\nher majesty; and thereby I preserved my interest in her majesty's\r\nfavour, but without any engagement of service.\r\n\r\nAs for consideration, pension, gratification, or reward, I declare to\r\nall the world I have had none, except only that old appointment which\r\nher majesty was pleased to make me in the days of the ministry of my\r\nlord Godolphin; of which I have spoken already, and which was for\r\nservices done in a foreign country some years before. Neither have I\r\nbeen employed, directed, or ordered by my lord treasurer aforesaid to\r\ndo, or not to do, anything in the affairs of the unhappy differences\r\nwhich have so long perplexed us, and for which I have so many, and such\r\nunjust reproaches.\r\n\r\nI come next to enter into the matters of fact, and what it is I have\r\ndone, or not done, which may justify the treatment I have met with; and\r\nfirst, for the negative part, what I have not done.\r\n\r\nThe first thing in the unhappy breaches which have fallen out, is the\r\nheaping up scandal upon the persons and conduct of men of honour on one\r\nside as well as the other; those unworthy methods of falling upon one\r\nanother by personal calumny and reproach. This I have often in print\r\ncomplained of as an unchristian, ungenerous, and unjustifiable practice.\r\nNot a word can be found in all I have written reflecting on the persons\r\nor conduct of any of the former ministry. I served her majesty under\r\ntheir administration; they acted honourably and justly in every\r\ntransaction in which I had the honour to be concerned with them, and I\r\nnever published or said anything dishonourable of any of them in my\r\nlife; nor can the worst enemy I have produce any such thing against me.\r\nI always regretted the change, and looked upon it as a great disaster to\r\nthe nation in general, I am sure it was so to me in particular; and the\r\ndivisions and feuds among parties which followed that change were\r\ndoubtless a disaster to us all.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that followed the change was the peace: no man can say\r\nthat ever I once said in my life that I approved of the peace. I wrote a\r\npublic paper at that time, and there it remains upon record against me.\r\nI printed it openly, and that so plainly as others durst not do, that I\r\ndid not like the peace; neither that which was made, nor that which was\r\nbefore making; that I thought the protestant interest was not taken care\r\nof in either; and that the peace I was for was such as should neither\r\nhave given the Spanish monarchy to the house of Bourbon nor to the house\r\nof Austria, but that this bone of contention should have been broken to\r\npieces, that it might not be dangerous to Europe; and that the\r\nprotestant powers, viz., Britain and the States, should have so\r\nstrengthened and fortified their interest by their sharing the commerce\r\nand strength of Spain, as should have made them no more afraid of France\r\nor the emperor: so that the protestant interest should have been\r\nsuperior to all the powers of Europe, and been in no more danger of\r\nexorbitant powers whether French or Austrian. This was the peace I\r\nalways argued for, pursuant to the design of king William in the Treaty\r\nof Partition, and pursuant to that article of the grand alliance which\r\nwas directed by the same glorious hand at the beginning of this last\r\nwar, viz., that all we should conquer in the Spanish West Indies should\r\nbe our own.\r\n\r\nThis was the true design, that England and Holland should have turned\r\ntheir naval power, which was eminently superior to that of France, to\r\nthe conquest of the Spanish West Indies, by which the channel of trade\r\nand return of bullion, which now enriches the enemies of both, had been\r\nours; and as the wealth, so the strength of the world had been in\r\nprotestant hands. Spain, whoever had it, must then have been dependent\r\nupon us. The house of Bourbon would have found it so poor without us, as\r\nto be scarce worth fighting for: and the people so averse to them, for\r\nwant of their commerce, as not to make it ever likely that France could\r\nkeep it.\r\n\r\nThis was the foundation I ever acted upon with relation to the peace. It\r\nis true, that when it was made, and could not be otherwise, I thought\r\nour business was to make the best of it, and rather to inquire what\r\nimprovements were to be made of it, than to be continually exclaiming at\r\nthose who made it; and where the objection lies against this part, I\r\ncannot yet see.\r\n\r\nWhile I spoke of things in this manner, I bore infinite reproaches from\r\nclamouring pens, of being in the French interest, being hired and bribed\r\nto defend a bad peace, and the like; and most of this was upon a\r\nsupposition of my writing, or being the author of, abundance of\r\npamphlets which came out every day, and which I had no hand in. And\r\nindeed, as I shall observe again by and by, this was one of the greatest\r\npieces of injustice that could be done me, and which I labour still\r\nunder without any redress; that whenever any piece comes out which is\r\nnot liked, I am immediately charged with being the author; and very\r\noften the first knowledge I have had of a book being published, has\r\nbeen from seeing myself abused for being the author of it, in some other\r\npamphlet published in answer to it.\r\n\r\nFinding myself treated in this manner, I declined writing at all, and\r\nfor a great part of a year never set pen to paper, except in the public\r\npaper called the Review. After this I was long absent in the north of\r\nEngland; and, observing the insolence of the jacobite party, and how\r\nthey insinuated fine things into the heads of the common people, of the\r\nright and claim of the pretender, and of the great things he would do\r\nfor us if he were to come in; of his being to turn a protestant, of his\r\nbeing resolved to maintain our liberties, support our friends, give\r\nliberty to dissenters, and the like; and finding that the people began\r\nto be deluded, and that the jacobites gained ground among them by these\r\ninsinuations, I thought it the best service I could do the protestant\r\ninterest, and the best way to open people's eyes of the protestant\r\nsuccession, if I took some course effectually to alarm the people with\r\nwhat they really ought to expect, if the pretender should come to be\r\nking. And this made me set pen to paper again.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to the affirmative part, or to what really I have\r\ndone; and in this, I am sorry to say, I have one of the foulest, most\r\nunjust, and unchristian clamours to complain of, that any man has\r\nsuffered, I believe, since the days of the tyranny of king James II. The\r\nfact is thus:--\r\n\r\nIn order to detect the influence of jacobite emissaries, as above, the\r\nfirst thing I wrote was a small tract, called A Seasonable Caution; a\r\nbook sincerely written to open the eyes of the poor, ignorant country\r\npeople, and to warn them against the subtle insinuations of the\r\nemissaries of the pretender; and that it might be effectual to that\r\npurpose, I prevailed with several of my friends to give them away among\r\nthe poor people, all over England, especially in the north; and several\r\nthousands were actually given away, the price being reduced so low, that\r\nthe bare expense of paper and press was only preserved, that every one\r\nmight be convinced that nothing of gain was designed, but a sincere\r\nendeavour to do a public good, and assist to keep the people entirely in\r\nthe interest of the protestant succession.\r\n\r\nNext to this, and with the same sincere design, I wrote two pamphlets,\r\none entituled, What if the Pretender should come? the other, Reasons\r\nagainst the Succession of the House of Hanover.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more plain than that the titles of these books were\r\namusements, in order to put the books into the hands of those people\r\nwhom the jacobites had deluded, and to bring them to be read by them.\r\n\r\nPrevious to what I shall further say of these books, I must observe that\r\nall these books met with so general a reception and approbation among\r\nthose who were most sincere for the protestant succession, that they\r\nsent them all over the kingdom, and recommended them to the people as\r\nexcellent and useful pieces; insomuch that about seven editions of them\r\nwere printed, and they were reprinted in other places. And I do protest,\r\nhad his present majesty, then elector of Hanover, given me a thousand\r\npounds to have written for the interest of his succession, and to expose\r\nand render the interest of the pretender odious and ridiculous, I could\r\nhave done nothing more effectual to those purposes than these books\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nAnd that I may make my worst enemies, to whom this is a fair appeal,\r\njudges of this, I must take leave, by and by, to repeat some of the\r\nexpressions in these books, which were direct and need no explanation,\r\nwhich I think no man that was in the interest of the pretender, nay,\r\nwhich no man but one who was entirely in the interest of the Hanover\r\nsuccession, could write.\r\n\r\nNothing can be severer in the fate of a man than to act so between two\r\nparties, that both sides should be provoked against him. It is certain,\r\nthe jacobites cursed those tracts and the author, and when they came to\r\nread them, being deluded by the titles according to the design, they\r\nthrew them by with the greatest indignation imaginable. Had the\r\npretender ever come to the throne, I could have expected nothing but\r\ndeath, and all the ignominy and reproach that the most inveterate enemy\r\nof his person and claim could be supposed to suffer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I leave it to any considering man to judge, what a\r\nsurprise it must be to me to meet with all the public clamour that\r\ninformers could invent, as being guilty of writing against the Hanover\r\nsuccession, and as having written several pamphlets in favour of the\r\npretender.\r\n\r\nNo man in this nation ever had a more rivetted aversion to the\r\npretender, and to all the family he pretended to come of, than I; a man\r\nthat had been in arms under the duke of Monmouth, against the cruelty\r\nand arbitrary government of his pretended father; that for twenty years\r\nhad to my utmost opposed him (king James) and his party after his\r\nabdication; and had served king William to his satisfaction, and the\r\nfriends of the revolution after his death, at all hazards and upon all\r\noccasions; that had suffered and been ruined under the administration of\r\nhigh-fliers and jacobites, of whom some at this day counterfeit whigs.\r\nIt could not be! The nature of the thing could by no means allow it; it\r\nmust be monstrous; and that the wonder may cease, I shall take leave to\r\nquote some of the expressions out of these books, of which the worst\r\nenemy I have in the world is left to judge whether they are in favour of\r\nthe pretender or no; but of this in its place. For these books I was\r\nprosecuted, taken into custody, and obliged to give 800_l._ bail.\r\n\r\nI do not in the least object here against, or design to reflect upon,\r\nthe proceedings of the judges which were subsequent to this. I\r\nacknowledged then, and now acknowledge again, that upon the information\r\ngiven, there was a sufficient ground for all they did; and my unhappy\r\nentering upon my own vindication in print, while the case was before\r\ntheir lordships in a judicial way, was an error which I did not\r\nunderstand, and which I did not foresee; and therefore, although I had\r\ngreat reason to reflect upon the informers, yet I was wrong in making\r\nthat defence in the manner and time I then made it; and which when I\r\nfound, I made no scruple afterwards to petition the judges, and\r\nacknowledge they had just ground to resent it. Upon which petition and\r\nacknowledgment their lordships were pleased, with particular marks of\r\ngoodness, to release me, and not to take the advantage of an error of\r\nignorance, as if it had been considered and premeditated.\r\n\r\nBut against the informers I think I have great reason to complain; and\r\nagainst the injustice of those writers who, in many pamphlets, charged\r\nme with writing for the pretender, and the government with pardoning an\r\nauthor who wrote for the pretender. And, indeed, the justice of these\r\nmen can be in nothing more clearly stated than in this case of mine;\r\nwhere the charge, in their printed papers and public discourse, was\r\nbrought; not that they themselves believed me guilty of the crime, but\r\nbecause it was necessary to blacken the man, that a general reproach\r\nmight serve for an answer to whatever he should say that was not for\r\ntheir turn. So that it was the person, not the crime, they fell upon;\r\nand they may justly be said to persecute for the sake of persecution, as\r\nwill thus appear.\r\n\r\nThis matter making some noise, people began to inquire into it, and ask\r\nwhat De Foe was prosecuted for, seeing the books were manifestly written\r\nagainst the pretender, and for the interest of the house of Hanover. And\r\nmy friends expostulated freely with some of the men who appeared in it,\r\nwho answered with more truth than honesty, that they knew this book had\r\nnothing in it, and that it was meant another way; but that De Foe had\r\ndisobliged them in other things, and they were resolved to take the\r\nadvantage they had, both to punish and expose him. They were no\r\ninconsiderable people who said this; and had the case come to a trial, I\r\nhad provided good evidence to prove the words.\r\n\r\nThis is the christianity and justice by which I have been treated, and\r\nthis in justice is the thing I complain of.\r\n\r\nNow, as this was the plot of a few men to see if they could brand me in\r\nthe world for a jacobite, and persuade rash and ignorant people that I\r\nwas turned about for the pretender, I think they might as easily have\r\nproved me to be a mahometan; therefore, I say, this obliges me to state\r\nthe matter as it really stands, that impartial men may judge whether\r\nthose books were written for or against the pretender. And this cannot\r\nbe better done than by the account of what followed after the\r\ninformation, which, in a few words, was this:--\r\n\r\nUpon the several days appointed, I appeared at the Queen's Bench bar to\r\ndischarge my bail; and at last had an indictment for high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors exhibited against me by her majesty's attorney-general,\r\nwhich, as I was informed, contained two hundred sheets of paper.\r\n\r\nWhat was the substance of the indictment I shall not mention here,\r\nneither could I enter upon it, having never seen the particulars; but I\r\nwas told that I should be brought to trial the very next term.\r\n\r\nI was not ignorant that in such cases it is easy to make any book a\r\nlibel, and that the jury must have found the matter of fact in the\r\nindictment, viz., that I had written such books, and then what might\r\nhave followed I knew not. Wherefore, I thought it was my only way to\r\ncast myself on the clemency of her majesty, of whose goodness I had so\r\nmuch experience many ways; representing in my petition, that I was far\r\nfrom the least intention to favour the interest of the pretender, but\r\nthat the books were all written with a sincere design to promote the\r\ninterest of the house of Hanover; and humbly laid before her majesty, as\r\nI do now before the rest of the world, the books themselves to plead in\r\nmy behalf; representing further, that I was maliciously informed against\r\nby those who were willing to put a construction upon the expressions\r\ndifferent from my true meaning; and therefore, flying to her majesty's\r\ngoodness and clemency, I entreated her gracious pardon.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the native disposition of her majesty to acts of\r\nclemency and goodness that obtained me this pardon; but, as I was\r\ninformed, her majesty was pleased to express it in the council, \"She saw\r\nnothing but private pique in the first prosecution.\" And therefore I\r\nthink I cannot give a better and clearer vindication of myself; than\r\nwhat is contained in the preamble to the pardon which her majesty was\r\npleased to grant me; and I must be allowed to say to those who are still\r\nwilling to object, that I think what satisfied her majesty might be\r\nsufficient to satisfy them; and I can assure them that this pardon was\r\nnot granted without her majesty's being specially and particularly\r\nacquainted with the things alleged in the petition, the books also being\r\nlooked into, to find the expressions quoted in the petition. The\r\npreamble to the patent for a pardon, as far as relates to the matters of\r\nfact, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, in the term of the Holy Trinity last past, our\r\n     attorney-general did exhibit an information, in our court of\r\n     Queen's Bench at Westminster, against Daniel De Foe, late of\r\n     London, gent., for writing, printing, and publishing, and causing\r\n     to be written, printed, and published, three libels, the one\r\n     entituled, Reasons against the Succession of the House of Hanover;\r\n     with an Inquiry how far the Abdication of King James, supposing it\r\n     to be legal, ought to affect the person of the Pretender. One\r\n     other, entituled, And what if the Pretender should come? or, Some\r\n     Considerations of the Advantages and real Consequences of the\r\n     Pretender's possessing the Crown of Great Britain. And one other,\r\n     entituled, An Answer to a Question that nobody thinks of, viz.,\r\n     What if the Queen should die?\r\n\r\n     \"And whereas the said Daniel De Foe hath by his humble petition\r\n     represented to us, that he, with a sincere design to propagate the\r\n     interest of the Hanover succession, and to animate the people\r\n     against the designs of the pretender, whom he always looked on as\r\n     an enemy to our sacred person and government, did publish the said\r\n     pamphlets: in all which books, although the titles seemed to look\r\n     as if written in favour of the pretender, and several expressions,\r\n     as in all ironical writing it must be, may be wrested against the\r\n     true design of the whole, and turned to a meaning quite different\r\n     from the intention of the author, yet the petitioner humbly\r\n     assures us, in the solemnest manner, that his true and only design\r\n     in all the said books was, by an ironical discourse of recommending\r\n     the pretender, in the strongest and most forcible manner to expose\r\n     his designs, and the ruinous consequences of his succeeding\r\n     therein; which, as the petitioner humbly represents, will appear to\r\n     our satisfaction by the books themselves, where the following\r\n     expressions are very plain: viz:, 'That the pretender is\r\n     recommended as a person proper to amass the English liberties into\r\n     his own sovereignty; supply them with the privilege of wearing\r\n     wooden shoes; easing them of the trouble of choosing parliaments;\r\n     and the nobility and gentry of the hazard and expense of winter\r\n     journeys, by governing them in that more righteous method, of his\r\n     absolute will, and enforcing the laws by a glorious standing army;\r\n     paying all the nation's debts at once by stopping the funds and\r\n     shutting up the exchequer; easing and quieting their differences in\r\n     religion, by bringing them to the union of popery, or leaving them\r\n     at liberty to have no religion at all:' that these were some of the\r\n     very expressions in the said books, which the petitioner sincerely\r\n     designed to expose and oppose, and as far as in him lies, the\r\n     interest of the pretender, and with no other intention;\r\n     nevertheless, the petitioner, to his great surprise, has been\r\n     misrepresented, and his said books misconstrued, as if written in\r\n     favour of the pretender; and the petitioner is now under\r\n     prosecution for the same; which prosecution, if further carried on,\r\n     will be the utter ruin of the petitioner and his family. Wherefore,\r\n     the petitioner, humbly assuring us of the innocence of his design\r\n     as aforesaid, flies to our clemency, and most humbly prays our most\r\n     gracious and free pardon.\r\n\r\n     \"We, taking the premises and the circumstances of the petitioner\r\n     into our royal consideration, are graciously pleased to extend our\r\n     royal mercy to the petitioner. Our will and pleasure therefore is,\r\n     that you prepare a bill for our royal signature, to pass our great\r\n     seal, containing our gracious and free pardon unto him, the said\r\n     Daniel De Foe, of the offences aforementioned, and of all\r\n     indictments, convictions, pains, penalties, and forfeitures\r\n     incurred thereby; and you are to insert therein all such apt\r\n     beneficial clauses as you shall deem requisite to make this our\r\n     intended pardon more full, valid, and effectual; and for so doing,\r\n     this shall be your warrant. Given at our castle at Windsor, the\r\n     twentieth day of November, 1713, in the twentieth year of our\r\n     reign. By her majesty's command.\r\n\r\n                                             BOLINGBROKE.\r\n\r\nLet any indifferent man judge whether I was not treated with particular\r\nmalice in this matter; who was, notwithstanding this, reproached in the\r\ndaily public prints with having written treasonable books in behalf of\r\nthe pretender; nay, and in some of those books, as before, the queen\r\nherself was reproached with having granted her pardon to an author who\r\nwrit for the pretender.\r\n\r\nI think I might with much more justice say, I was the first man that\r\never was obliged to seek a pardon for writing for the Hanover\r\nsuccession, and the first man that these people ever sought to ruin for\r\nwriting against the pretender. For, if ever a book was sincerely\r\ndesigned to further and propagate the affection and zeal of the nation\r\nagainst the pretender, nay, and was made use of, and that with success\r\ntoo, for that purpose, these books were so; and I ask no more favour of\r\nthe world to determine the opinion of honest men for or against me, than\r\nwhat is drawn constructively from these books. Let one word, either\r\nwritten or spoken by me, either published or not published, be produced,\r\nthat was in the least disrespectful to the protestant succession, or to\r\nany branch of the family of Hanover, or that can be judged to be\r\nfavourable to the interest or person of the pretender, and I will be\r\nwilling to waive her majesty's pardon, and render myself to public\r\njustice, to be punished for it, as I should well deserve.\r\n\r\nI freely and openly challenge the worst of my enemies to charge me with\r\nany discourse, conversation, or behaviour, in my whole life, which had\r\nthe least word in it injurious to the protestant succession, unbecoming\r\nor disrespectful to any of the persons of the royal family of Hanover,\r\nor the least favourable word of the persons, the designs, or friends of\r\nthe pretender. If they can do it, let them stand forth and speak; no\r\ndoubt but that they may be heard; and I, for my part, will relinquish\r\nall pleas, pardons, and defences, and cast myself into the hands of\r\njustice. Nay, to go further, I defy them to prove that I ever kept\r\ncompany, or had any society, friendship, or conversation, with any\r\njacobite. So averse have I been to the interest and the people, that I\r\nhave studiously avoided their company on all occasions.\r\n\r\nAs nothing in the world has been more my aversion than the society of\r\njacobites, so nothing can be a greater misfortune to me than to be\r\naccused and publicly reproached with what is, of all things in the\r\nworld, most abhorred by me; and that which has made it the more\r\nafflicting is, that this charge arises from those very things which I\r\ndid with the sincerest design to manifest the contrary.\r\n\r\nBut such is my present fate, and I am to submit to it; which I do with\r\nmeekness and calmness, as to a judgment from heaven, and am practising\r\nthat duty which I have studied long ago, of forgiving my enemies, and\r\npraying for them that despitefully use me.\r\n\r\nHaving given this brief history of the pardon, &c., I hope the impartial\r\npart of the world will grant me, that being thus graciously delivered a\r\nsecond time from the cruelty of my implacable enemies, and the ruin of a\r\ncruel and unjust persecution, and that by the mere clemency and\r\ngoodness, my obligation to her majesty's goodness was far from being\r\nmade less than it was before.\r\n\r\nI have now run through the history of my obligation to her majesty, and\r\nto the person of my benefactor aforesaid. I shall state everything that\r\nfollowed this with all the clearness I can, and leave myself liable to\r\nas little cavil as I may; for I see myself assaulted by a sort of people\r\nwho will do me no justice. I hear a great noise made of punishing those\r\nthat are guilty, but, as I said before, not one word of clearing those\r\nthat are innocent; and I must say, in this part they treat me, not only\r\nas I were no Christian, but as if they themselves were not Christians.\r\nThey will neither prove the charge nor hear the defence, which is the\r\nunjustest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nI foresee what will be alleged to the clause of my obligation, &c., to\r\ngreat persons, and I resolve to give my adversaries all the advantage\r\nthey can desire by acknowledging beforehand, that no obligation to the\r\nqueen, or to any benefactor, can justify any man's acting against the\r\ninterest of his country, against his principles, his conscience, and his\r\nformer profession.\r\n\r\nI think this will anticipate all that can be said upon that head, and it\r\nwill then remain to tell the fact, as I am not chargeable with it; which\r\nI shall do as clearly as possible in a few words.\r\n\r\nIt is none of my work to enter into the conduct of the queen or of the\r\nministry in this case; the question is not what they have done, but what\r\nI have done; and though I am very far from thinking of them as some\r\nother people think, yet, for the sake of the present argument, I am to\r\ngive them all up, and suppose, though not granting, that all which is\r\nsuggested of them by the worst temper, the most censorious writer, the\r\nmost scandalous pamphlet or lampoon should be true; and I'll go through\r\nsome of the particulars, as I meet with them in public.\r\n\r\n1st. That they made a scandalous peace, unjustly broke the alliance,\r\nbetrayed the confederates, and sold us all to the French.\r\n\r\nGod forbid it should be all truth, in the manner that we see it in\r\nprint; but that I say is none of my business. But what hand had I in all\r\nthis? I never wrote one word for the peace before it was made, or to\r\njustify it after it was made; let them produce it if they can. Nay, in a\r\nReview upon that subject while it was making, I printed it in plainer\r\nwords than other men durst speak it at that time, that I did not like\r\nthe peace, nor did I like any peace that was making since that of the\r\npartition, and that the protestant interest was not taken care of either\r\nin that or the treaty of Gertrudenburgh before it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I did say, that since the peace was made, and we could\r\nnot help it, that it was our business and our duty to make the best of\r\nit, to make the utmost advantage of it by commerce, navigation, and all\r\nkind of improvement that we could, and this I say still; and I must\r\nthink it is more our duty to do so than the exclamations against the\r\nthing itself, which it is not in our power to retrieve. This is all that\r\nthe worst enemy I have can charge me with. After the peace was made, and\r\nthe Dutch and the emperor stood out, I gave my opinion of what I\r\nforesaw would necessarily be the consequence of that difference, viz.,\r\nthat it would inevitably involve these nations in a war with one or\r\nother of them; any one who was master of common sense in the public\r\naffairs might see that the standing out of the Dutch could have no other\r\nevent. For if the confederates had conquered the French, they would\r\ncertainly have fallen upon us by way of resentment, and there was no\r\ndoubt but the same councils that led us to make a peace would oblige us\r\nto maintain it, by preventing too great impressions upon the French.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I alleged, that should the French prevail against the\r\nDutch, unless he stopped at such limitations of conquest as the treaty\r\nobliged him to do, we must have been under the same necessity to renew\r\nthe war against France; and for this reason, seeing we had made a peace,\r\nwe were obliged to bring the rest of the confederates into it, and to\r\nbring the French to give them all such terms as they ought to be\r\nsatisfied with.\r\n\r\nThis way of arguing was either so little understood, or so much\r\nmaligned, that I suffered innumerable reproaches in print for having\r\nwritten for a war with the Dutch, which was neither in the expression,\r\nnor ever in my imagination; but I pass by these injuries as small and\r\ntrifling compared to others I suffer under.\r\n\r\nHowever, one thing I must say of the peace, let it be good or ill in\r\nitself, I cannot but think we have all reason to rejoice in behalf of\r\nhis present majesty, that at his accession to the crown he found the\r\nnation in peace, and had the hands of the king of France tied up by a\r\npeace so as not to be able, without the most infamous breach of\r\narticles, to offer the least disturbance to his taking a quiet and\r\nleisurely possession, or so much as to countenance those that would.\r\n\r\nNot but that I believe, if the war had been at the height, we should\r\nhave been able to have preserved the crown for his present majesty, its\r\nonly rightful lord; but I will not say it should have been so easy, so\r\nbloodless, so undisputed as now; and all the difference must be\r\nacknowledged to the peace, and this is all the good I ever yet said of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI come next to the general clamour of the ministry being for the\r\npretender. I must speak my sentiments solemnly and plainly, as I always\r\ndid in that matter, viz., that if it was so, I did not see it, nor did I\r\never see reason to believe it; this I am sure of, that if it was so, I\r\nnever took one step in that kind of service, nor did I ever hear one\r\nword spoken by any one of the ministry that I had the honour to know or\r\nconverse with, that favoured the pretender; but have had the honour to\r\nhear them all protest that there was no design to oppose the succession\r\nof Hanover in the least.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to me, that they might be in the interest of the\r\npretender for all that; it is true they might, but that is nothing to\r\nme. I am not vindicating their conduct, but my own; as I never was\r\nemployed in anything that way, so I do still protest I do not believe it\r\nwas ever in their design, and I have many reasons to confirm my thoughts\r\nin that case, which are not material to the present case. But be that as\r\nit will, it is enough to me that I acted nothing in any such interest,\r\nneither did I ever sin against the protestant succession of Hanover in\r\nthought, word, or deed; and if the ministry did, I did not see it, or so\r\nmuch as suspect them of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a disaster to the ministry, to be driven to the necessity of\r\ntaking that set of men by the hand, who nobody can deny, were in that\r\ninterest; but as the former ministry answered, when they were charged\r\nwith a design to overthrow the church, because they favoured, joined\r\nwith, and were united to the dissenters; I say they answered, that they\r\nmade use of the dissenters, but granted them nothing (which, by the way,\r\nwas too true;) so these gentlemen answer, that it is true they made use\r\nof jacobites, but did nothing for them.\r\n\r\nBut this by the by. Necessity is pleaded by both parties for doing\r\nthings which neither side can justify. I wish both sides would for ever\r\navoid the necessity of doing evil; for certainly it is the worst plea in\r\nthe world, and generally made use of for the worst things.\r\n\r\nI have often lamented the disaster which I saw employing jacobites was\r\nto the late ministry, and certainly it gave the greatest handle to the\r\nenemies of the ministry to fix that universal reproach upon them of\r\nbeing in the interest of the pretender. But there was no medium. The\r\nwhigs refused to show them a safe retreat, or to give them the least\r\nopportunity to take any other measures, but at the risk of their own\r\ndestruction; and they ventured upon that course in hopes of being able\r\nto stand alone at last without help of either the one or the other; in\r\nwhich they were no doubt, mistaken.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this part, as I was always assured, and have good reason\r\nstill to believe, that her majesty was steady in the interest of the\r\nhouse of Hanover, and as nothing was ever offered to me, or required of\r\nme, to the prejudice of that interest, on what ground can I be\r\nreproached with the secret reserved designs of any, if they had such\r\ndesigns, as I still verily believe they had not?\r\n\r\nI see there are some men who would fain persuade the world, that every\r\nman that was in the interest of the late ministry, or employed by the\r\nlate government, or that served the late queen, was for the pretender.\r\n\r\nGod forbid this should be true; and I think there needs very little to\r\nbe said in answer to it. I can answer for myself, that it is notoriously\r\nfalse; and I think the easy and uninterrupted accession of his majesty\r\nto the crown contradicts it. I see no end which such a suggestion aims\r\nat, but to leave an odium upon all that had any duty or regard to her\r\nlate majesty.\r\n\r\nA subject is not always master of his sovereign's measures, nor always\r\nto examine what persons or parties the prince he serves employs, so be\r\nit that they break not in upon the constitution; that they govern\r\naccording to law, and that he is employed in no illegal act, or have\r\nnothing desired of him inconsistent with the liberties and laws of his\r\ncountry. If this be not right, then a servant of the king's is in a\r\nworse case than a servant to any private person.\r\n\r\nIn all these things I have not erred; neither have I acted or done\r\nanything in the whole course of my life, either in the service of her\r\nmajesty or of her ministry, that any one can say has the least deviation\r\nfrom the strictest regard to the protestant succession, and to the laws\r\nand liberties of my country.\r\n\r\nI never saw an arbitrary action offered at, a law dispensed with,\r\njustice denied, or oppression set up, either by queen or ministry, in\r\nany branch of the administration, wherein I had the least concern.\r\n\r\nIf I have sinned against the whigs, it has been all negatively, viz.,\r\nthat I have not joined in the loud exclamations against the queen and\r\nagainst the ministry, and against their measures; and if this be my\r\ncrime, my plea is twofold.\r\n\r\n1. I did not really see cause for carrying their complaints to that\r\nviolent degree.\r\n\r\n2. Where I did see what, as before, I lamented and was sorry for, and\r\ncould not join with or approve,--as joining with jacobites, the peace,\r\n&c.,--my obligation is my plea for my silence.\r\n\r\nI have all the good thoughts of the person, and good wishes for the\r\nprosperity of my benefactor, that charity and that gratitude can inspire\r\nme with. I ever believed him to have the true interest of the protestant\r\nreligion and of his country in his view; and if it should be otherwise,\r\nI should be very sorry. And I must repeat it again, that he always left\r\nme so entirely to my own judgment, in everything I did, that he never\r\nprescribed to me what I should write, or should not write, in my life;\r\nneither did he ever concern himself to dictate to or restrain me in any\r\nkind; nor did he see any one tract that I ever wrote before it was\r\nprinted; so that all the notion of my writing by his direction is as\r\nmuch a slander upon him as it is possible anything of that kind can be;\r\nand if I have written anything which is offensive, unjust, or untrue, I\r\nmust do that justice as to declare, he has no hand in it; the crime is\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nAs the reproach of his directing me to write is a slander upon the\r\nperson I am speaking of, so that of my receiving pensions and payments\r\nfrom him for writing, is a slander upon me; and I speak it with the\r\ngreatest sincerity, seriousness, and solemnity that it is possible for a\r\nChristian man to speak, that except the appointment I mentioned before,\r\nwhich her majesty was pleased to make me formerly, and which I received\r\nduring the time of my lord Godolphin's ministry, I have not received of\r\nthe late lord treasurer, or of any one else by his order, knowledge, or\r\ndirection, one farthing, or the value of a farthing, during his whole\r\nadministration; nor has all the interest I have been supposed to have in\r\nhis lordship been able to procure me the arrears due to me in the time\r\nof the other ministry. So help me God.\r\n\r\nI am under no necessity of making this declaration. The services I did,\r\nand for which her majesty was pleased to make me a small allowance, are\r\nknown to the greatest men in the present administration; and some of\r\nthem were then of the opinion, and I hope are so still, that I was not\r\nunworthy of her majesty's favour. The effect of those services, however\r\nsmall, is enjoyed by those great persons and by the whole nation to this\r\nday; and I had the honour once to be told, that they should never be\r\nforgotten. It is a misfortune that no man can avoid, to forfeit for his\r\ndeference to the person and services of his queen, to whom he was\r\ninexpressibly obliged; and if I am fallen under the displeasure of the\r\npresent government for anything I ever did in obedience to her majesty\r\nin the past, I may say it is my disaster; but I can never say it is my\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThis brings me again to that other oppression which, as I said, I suffer\r\nunder, and which, I think, is of a kind that no man ever suffered under\r\nso much as myself; and this is to have every libel, every pamphlet, be\r\nit ever so foolish, so malicious, so unmannerly, or so dangerous, be\r\nlaid at my door, and be called publicly by my name. It has been in vain\r\nfor me to struggle with this injury; it has been in vain for me to\r\nprotest, to declare solemnly, nay, if I would have sworn that I had no\r\nhand in such a book or paper, never saw it, never read it, and the like,\r\nit was the same thing.\r\n\r\nMy name has been hackneyed about the street by the hawkers, and about\r\nthe coffeehouses by the politicians, at such a rate as no patience could\r\nbear. One man will swear to the style; another to this or that\r\nexpression; another to the way of printing; and all so positive that it\r\nis to no purpose to oppose it.\r\n\r\nI published once, to stop this way of using me, that I would print\r\nnothing but what I set my name to, and held it for a year or two; but it\r\nwas all one; I had the same treatment. I now have resolved for some time\r\nto write nothing at all, and yet I find it the same thing; two books\r\nlately published being called mine, for no other reason that I know of\r\nthan that at the request of the printer, I revised two sheets of them at\r\nthe press, and that they seemed to be written in favour of a certain\r\nperson; which person, also, as I have been assured, had no hand in them,\r\nor any knowledge of them, till they were published in print.\r\n\r\nThis is a flail which I have no fence against, but to complain of the\r\ninjustice of it, and that is but _the shortest way_ to be treated with\r\nmore injustice.\r\n\r\nThere is a mighty charge against me for being author and publisher of a\r\npaper called the 'Mercator.' I will state the fact first, and then speak\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that being desired to give my opinion in the affair of the\r\ncommerce with France, I did, as I often had done in print many years\r\nbefore, declare that it was my opinion we ought to have an open trade\r\nwith France, because I did believe we might have the advantage by such a\r\ntrade; and of this opinion I am still. What part I had in the Mercator\r\nis well known; and could men answer with argument, and not with personal\r\nabuse, I would at any time defend every part of the Mercator which was\r\nof my doing. But to say the Mercator was mine, is false; I neither was\r\nthe author of it, had the property of it, the printing of it, or the\r\nprofit by it. I had never any payment or reward for writing any part of\r\nit, nor had I the power to put what I would into it. Yet the whole\r\nclamour fell upon me, because they knew not who else to load with it.\r\nAnd when they came to answer, the method was instead of argument, to\r\nthreaten and reflect upon me, reproach me with private circumstances and\r\nmisfortunes, and give language which no Christian ought to give, and\r\nwhich no gentleman ought to take.\r\n\r\nI thought any Englishman had the liberty to speak his opinion in such\r\nthings, for this had nothing to do with the public. The press was open\r\nto me as well as to others; and how or when I lost my English liberty of\r\nspeaking my mind, I know not; neither how my speaking my opinion without\r\nfee or reward, could authorise them to call me villain, rascal, traitor,\r\nand such opprobrious names.\r\n\r\nIt was ever my opinion, and is so still, that were our wool kept from\r\nFrance, and our manufactures spread in France upon reasonable duties,\r\nall the improvements which the French have made in the woollen\r\nmanufactures would decay, and in the end be little worth; and\r\nconsequently, the hurt they could do us by them would be of little\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIt was my opinion, and is so still, that the ninth article of the treaty\r\nof commerce was calculated for the advantage of our trade, let who will\r\nmake it. That is nothing to me. My reasons are because it tied up the\r\nFrench to open the door to our manufactures at a certain duty of\r\nimportation there, and left the parliament of Britain at liberty to shut\r\ntheirs out by as high duties as they pleased here, there being no\r\nlimitation upon us as to duties on French goods; but that other nations\r\nshould pay the same.\r\n\r\nWhile the French were thus bound, and the British free, I always thought\r\nwe must be in a condition to trade to advantage, or it must be our own\r\nfault. This was my opinion, and is so still; and I would venture to\r\nmaintain it against any man upon a public stage, before a jury of fifty\r\nmerchants, and venture my life upon the cause, if I were assured of fair\r\nplay in the dispute. But that it was my opinion that we might carry on a\r\ntrade with France to our great advantage, and that we ought for that\r\nreason to trade with them, appears in the third, fourth, fifth, and\r\nsixth volumes of the Review, above nine years before the Mercator was\r\nthought of. It was not thought criminal to say so then; how it come to\r\nbe villanous to say so now, God knows; I can give no account of it. I am\r\nstill of the same opinion, and shall never be brought to say otherwise,\r\nunless I see the state of trade so altered as to alter my opinion; and\r\nif ever I do I shall be able to give good reasons for it.\r\n\r\nThe answer to these things, whether mine or no, was all pointed at me,\r\nand the arguments were generally in the terms villain, rascal,\r\nmiscreant, liar, bankrupt, fellow, hireling, turncoat, &c. What the\r\narguments were bettered by these methods, I leave others to judge of.\r\nAlso, most of those things in the Mercator, for which I had such usage,\r\nwere such as I was not the author of.\r\n\r\nI do grant, had all the books which had been called by my name been\r\nwritten by me, I must of necessity have exasperated every side; and\r\nperhaps have deserved it; but I have the greatest injustice imaginable\r\nin this treatment, as I have in the perverting the design of what I have\r\nreally written.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, therefore, my complaint in a few words:--\r\n\r\nI was, from my first entering into the knowledge of public matters, and\r\nhave ever been to this day, a sincere lover of the constitution of my\r\ncountry; zealous for liberty and the protestant interest; but a\r\nconstant follower of moderate principles, a vigorous opposer of hot\r\nmeasures in all parties. I never once changed my opinion, my principles,\r\nor my party: and let what will be said of changing sides, this I\r\nmaintain, that I never once deviated from the revolution principles, nor\r\nfrom the doctrine of liberty and property on which it was founded.\r\n\r\nI own I could never be convinced of the great danger of the pretender in\r\nthe time of the late ministry, nor can I be now convinced of the great\r\ndanger of the church under this ministry. I believe the cry of the one\r\nwas politically made use of then to serve other designs, and I plainly\r\nsee the like use made of the other now. I spoke my mind freely then, and\r\nI have done the like now, in a small tract to that purpose not yet made\r\npublic; and which if I live to publish I will publicly own, as I purpose\r\nto do everything I write, that my friends may know when I am abused, and\r\nthey imposed on.\r\n\r\nIt has been the disaster of all parties in this nation to be very hot in\r\ntheir turn; and as often as they have been so I have differed with them,\r\nand ever must and shall do so. I will repeat some of the occasions on\r\nthe whigs' side, because from that quarter the accusation of my turning\r\nabout comes.\r\n\r\nThe first time I had the misfortune to differ with my friends was about\r\nthe year 1683, when the Turks were besieging Vienna, and the whigs in\r\nEngland, generally speaking, were for the Turks taking it, which I,\r\nhaving read the history of the cruelty and perfidious dealings of the\r\nTurks in their wars, and how they had rooted out the name of the\r\nChristian religion in above threescore and ten kingdoms, could by no\r\nmeans agree with. And though then but a young man, and a younger\r\nauthor, I opposed it, and wrote against it, which was taken very\r\nunkindly indeed.\r\n\r\nThe next time I differed with my friends was when king James was\r\nwheedling the dissenters to take off the penal laws and test, which I\r\ncould by no means come into. And, as in the first, I used to say, I had\r\nrather the popish house of Austria should ruin the protestants in\r\nHungaria, than the infidel house of Ottoman should ruin both protestants\r\nand papists by overrunning Germany; so, in the other, I told the\r\ndissenters I had rather the church of England should pull our clothes\r\noff by fines and forfeitures, than the papists should fall both upon the\r\nchurch and the dissenters, and pull our skins off by fire and fagot.\r\n\r\nThe next difference I had with good men was about the scandalous\r\npractice of occasional conformity, in which I had the misfortune to make\r\nmany honest men angry, rather because I had the better of the argument,\r\nthan because they disliked what I said.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have lived to see the dissenters themselves very quiet, if not\r\nvery well pleased with an act of parliament to prevent it. Their friends\r\nindeed laid it on; they would be friends indeed if they would talk of\r\ntaking it off again.\r\n\r\nAgain, I had a breach with honest men for their maltreating king\r\nWilliam; of which I say nothing, because I think they are now opening\r\ntheir eyes, and making what amends they can to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe fifth difference I had with them was about the treaty of Partition,\r\nin which many honest men are mistaken, and in which I told them plainly\r\nthen that they would at last end the war upon worse terms; and so it is\r\nmy opinion they would have done, though, the treaty of Gertrudenburgh\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\r\nThe sixth time I differed with them was when the old whigs fell upon the\r\nmodern whigs, and when the duke of Marlborough and my lord Godolphin\r\nwere used by the Observator in a manner worse, I must confess, for the\r\ntime it lasted, than ever they were used since; nay, though it were by\r\nAbel and the Examiner; but the success failed. In this dispute my lord\r\nGodolphin did me the honour to tell me, I had served him and his grace\r\nalso both faithfully and successfully. But his lordship is dead, and I\r\nhave now no testimony of it but what is to be found in the Observator,\r\nwhere I am plentifully abused for being an enemy to my country, by\r\nacting in the interest of my lord Godolphin and the duke of Marlborough.\r\nWhat weathercock can turn with such tempers as these!\r\n\r\nI am now on the seventh breach with them, and my crime now is, that I\r\nwill not believe and say the same things of the queen and the late\r\ntreasurer which I could not believe before of my lord Godolphin and the\r\nduke of Marlborough, and which in truth I cannot believe, and therefore\r\ncould not say it of either of them; and which, if I had believed, yet I\r\nought not to have been the man that should have said it for the reasons\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nIn such turns of tempers and times, a man must be tenfold a vicar of\r\nBray, or it is impossible but he must one time or other be out with\r\neverybody. This is my present condition, and for this I am reviled with\r\nhaving abandoned my principles, turned jacobite, and what not. God judge\r\nbetween me and these men. Would they come to any particulars with me,\r\nwhat real guilt I may have I would freely acknowledge; and if they would\r\nproduce any evidence of the bribes, the pensions, and the rewards I\r\nhave taken, I would declare honestly whether they were true or no. If\r\nthey would give a list of the books which they charge me with, and the\r\nreasons why they lay them at my door, I would acknowledge my mistake,\r\nown what I have done, and let them know what I have not done. But these\r\nmen neither show mercy, nor leave place for repentance; in which they\r\nact not only unlike their master, but contrary to his express commands.\r\n\r\nIt is true, good men have been used thus in former times; and all the\r\ncomfort I have is, that these men have not the last judgment in their\r\nhands: if they had, dreadful would be the case of those who oppose them.\r\nBut that day will show many men and things also in a different state\r\nfrom what they may now appear in. Some that now appear clear and fair\r\nwill then be seen to be black and foul, and some that are now thought\r\nblack and foul will then be approved and accepted; and thither I\r\ncheerfully appeal, concluding this part in the words of the prophet, _I\r\nheard the defaming of many; fear on every side; report, say they, and we\r\nwill report it; all my familiars watched for my halting, saying,\r\nperadventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and\r\nwe shall take our revenge on him_. Jer. xx. 10.\r\n\r\nMr. Poole's Annotations has the following remarks on these lines; which,\r\nI think, are so much to that part of my case which is to follow, that I\r\ndo not omit them. The words are these:--\r\n\r\n\"The prophet,\" says he, \"here rendereth a reason why he thought of\r\ngiving over his work as a prophet; his ears were continually filled with\r\nthe obloquies and reproaches of such as reproached him; and besides, he\r\nwas afraid on all hands, there were so many traps laid for him, so many\r\ndevices devised against him. They did not only take advantage against\r\nhim, but sought advantages, and invited others to raise stories of him;\r\nnot only strangers, but those that he might have expected the greatest\r\nkindness from; those that pretended most courteously; 'They watch,' says\r\nhe, 'for opportunities to do me justice, and lay in wait for my halting,\r\ndesiring nothing more than that I might be enticed to speak, or do\r\nsomething which they might find matter of a colourable accusation, that\r\nso they might satisfy their malice upon me.' This hath always been the\r\ngenius of wicked men. Job and David both made complaints much like\r\nthis.\" These are Mr. Poole's words.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads me to several particulars, in which my case may, without\r\nany arrogance, be likened to that of the sacred prophet, excepting the\r\nvast disparity of the persons.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the queen dead, and the king, as right required,\r\nproclaimed, but the rage of men increased upon me to that degree, that\r\nthe threats and insults I received were such as I am not able to\r\nexpress. If I offered to say a word in favour of the present settlement,\r\nit was called fawning, and turning round again; on the other hand,\r\nthough I have meddled neither one way nor the other, nor written one\r\nbook since the queen's death, yet a great many things are called by my\r\nname, and I bear every day the reproaches which all the answerers of\r\nthose books cast, as well upon the subjects as the authors. I have not\r\nseen or spoken to my lord of Oxford but once since the king's landing,\r\nnor received the least message, order, or writing from his lordship, or\r\nany other way corresponded with him, yet he bears the reproach of my\r\nwriting in his defence, and I the rage of men for doing it. I cannot\r\nsay it is no affliction to me to be thus used, though my being entirely\r\nclear of the facts is a true support to me.\r\n\r\nI am unconcerned at the rage and clamour of party men; but I cannot be\r\nunconcerned to hear men, who I think are good men and good Christians,\r\nprepossessed and mistaken about me. However, I cannot doubt but some\r\ntime or other it will please God to open such men's eyes. A constant,\r\nsteady adhering to personal virtue and to public peace, which, I thank\r\nGod, I can appeal to him has always been my practice, will at last\r\nrestore me to the opinion of sober and impartial men, and that is all I\r\ndesire. What it will do with those who are resolutely partial and\r\nunjust, I cannot say, neither is that much my concern. But I cannot\r\nforbear giving one example of the hard treatment I receive, which has\r\nhappened even while I am writing this tract. I have six children; I have\r\neducated them as well as my circumstances will permit, and so as I hope\r\nshall recommend them to better usage than their father meets with in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nI am not indebted one shilling in the world for any part of their\r\neducation, or for anything else belonging to their bringing up; yet the\r\nauthor of the Flying Post published lately that I never paid for the\r\neducation of any of my children. If any man in Britain has a shilling to\r\ndemand of me for any part of their education, or anything belonging to\r\nthem, let them come for it.\r\n\r\nBut these men care not what injurious things they write, nor what they\r\nsay, whether truth or not, if it may but raise a reproach on me, though\r\nit were to be my ruin. I may well appeal to the honour and justice of my\r\nworst enemies in such cases as this:\r\n\r\n  _Conscia mens recti fama mendacia ridet._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION BY THE PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE this was at the press, and the copy thus far finished, the author\r\nwas seized with a violent fit of an apoplexy, whereby he was disabled\r\nfinishing what he designed in his further defence; and continuing now\r\nfor above six weeks in a weak and languishing condition, neither able to\r\ngo on nor likely to recover, at least in any short time, his friends\r\nthought it not fit to delay the publication of this any longer. If he\r\nrecovers he may be able to finish what he began; if not, it is the\r\nopinion of most that know him that the treatment which he here complains\r\nof, and some others that he would have spoken of, have been the apparent\r\ncause of his disaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nThe transcriber made these changes to the text to correct obvious\r\nerrors:\r\n\r\n  1. p. 10, Jacobities --> Jacobites\r\n  2. p. 12, lordtreasurer --> lord treasurer\r\n  3. p. 20, an as unchristian --> as an unchristian\r\n  4. p. 37, withont --> without\r\n\r\nEnd of Transcriber's Notes]",
