As the months went by, Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nLord Hartington used less and less concealment of their differences,\r\nwhile it was well known to all the Cabinet that the alliance between\r\nChamberlain and Dilke was complete and unconditional. Whoever broke with\r\nChamberlain broke with Dilke. Fortunately a certain bond of personal\r\nsympathy, in spite of divergent views, existed between Lord Hartington\r\nand Sir Charles Dilke, and this bond largely helped to hold Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government together.\r\n\r\nIn the negotiations which followed between the leaders of the two great\r\nParties, Sir Charles Dilke was able to show the full measure of his\r\nvalue to the State. It was of first-rate importance that the Liberal\r\nParty should possess at that moment a representative with whom Lord\r\nSalisbury found it congenial to treat, and whom the most advanced\r\nLiberals trusted unreservedly to treat with Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\nThe same confidence could hardly have been given by them to Lord\r\nHartington, who held that \"equalization of the franchise was pressing\r\nmainly on account of the pledges that had been given, and not much for\r\nany other reason.\" [Footnote: Letter to Mr. Gladstone of October 24th,\r\n1883, quoted by Mr. Bernard Holland in his _Life of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire_, vol. i., p. 395.] Most Liberals took a very different view\r\nof the need for this reform. Further, Lord Hartington held that\r\nfranchise and redistribution should be treated simultaneously, and he\r\nwas unwilling to extend the franchise in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt a Cabinet on October 25th, 1883, the question of simultaneous or\r\nseparate treatment of the problems had been settled. Mr. Gladstone, says\r\nSir Charles, 'made a speech which meant franchise first and the rest\r\nnowhere.' On the Irish question, Sir Charles was instructed to get\r\naccurate statistics as to the effects of equalizing the franchise\r\nbetween boroughs and counties, and 'on Friday, November 16th,' he notes,\r\n'I wrote to Chamberlain: \"I have some awful figures for poor Hartington\r\nto swallow--700,000 county householders in the Irish counties.\"' Lord\r\nHartington still stuck to his point of linking redistribution and\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nBut on November 22nd,\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone read a long and admirable memorandum in favour of the\r\n    views held by him, by Chamberlain, and by me, as to franchise and\r\n    redistribution--that is, franchise first, with a promise of\r\n    redistribution but no Bill; and Hartington received no support after\r\n    this from any members of the Cabinet.'\r\n\r\nThere were, however, matters in which Lord Hartington's Conservative\r\ntendencies found an ally in the Prime Minister. On November 28th, 1883,\r\nat the Committee of the Cabinet on Local Government,\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain noted: \"Mr. Gladstone hesitates to disfranchise the\r\n    freeholders in boroughs--persons voting as householders in boroughs\r\n    and as freeholders in the counties in which the boroughs are\r\n    constituted. I am in favour of one man one vote, and told him so.\"\r\n    Our not getting one man one vote was entirely Mr. Gladstone's fault,\r\n    for the Cabinet expected and would have taken it, Hartington alone\r\n    opposing, as he opposed everything all through.'\r\n\r\nThe question of widening the franchise in Ireland was still unsettled,\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Hartington both made allusion to it in\r\npublic speeches at this moment. The speeches, apart from their marked\r\ndifference in general tone, were on this point in flat contradiction to\r\neach other, and on December 2nd Lord Hartington wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\nwith a threat of resignation. On that day he delivered at Accrington a\r\nlong eulogy of the Whigs, who had 'formed a connecting link between the\r\nadvanced party and those classes which, possessing property, powers, and\r\ninfluence, are naturally averse to change.' The Whigs it was, he\r\ncontended, who had by their guidance and their action reduced changes in\r\nthe direction of popular reform to the 'calm and peaceful process of\r\nconstitutional acts.'\r\n\r\n    'At this moment there was a conflict raging between Chamberlain and\r\n    Hartington, and in their autumn speeches each of them pretty plainly\r\n    attacked the other's policy. Chamberlain wrote to me: \"Why does\r\n    Hartington think _aloud_ when he thinks one thing and is going to do\r\n    the other? And why does he snub the Caucus when he has made up his\r\n    mind to do exactly what they want? If he cannot learn to be a little\r\n    more diplomatic, he will make a devil of a rum leader!\" A little\r\n    later Chamberlain gave me \"passages from a speech which _ought_ to\r\n    be delivered: 'Yes, gentlemen, I entirely agree with Lord\r\n    Hartington. It is the business and duty of Radicals to lead great\r\n    popular movements, and if they are fortunate enough to kindle the\r\n    fire of national enthusiasm and to stir the hearts of the people,\r\n    then it will be the high prerogative of the great Whig noble who has\r\n    been waiting round the corner to direct and guide and moderate the\r\n    movement which he has done all in his power to prevent and\r\n    discourage.'\"\r\n\r\n    'The storm between Hartington and Chamberlain having broken out\r\n    again, Chamberlain wrote to me on December 5th, enclosing a letter\r\n    of reproof from Mr. Gladstone, and saying: \"I replied casuistically\r\n    that I would endeavour to exclude from my speeches the slightest\r\n    reference to Hartington, but that he was really too trying. I\r\n    reminded Mr. G. that I had asked if I were free to argue the\r\n    question, and that he had said: Yes--no one taking exception.\" In\r\n    the following week Chamberlain came to town and dined with me,\r\n    and we discussed the matter. Although Mr. Gladstone had blown\r\n    Chamberlain up, he was really much more angry with Hartington.'\r\n\r\nIt appears from the _Life of the Duke of Devonshire_ that Mr. Gladstone\r\ncontinued through December his attempts to mediate. [Footnote: See _Life\r\nof the Duke of Devonshire_, by Mr. Bernard Holland, vol. i, p. 398 _et\r\nseq_.] The matter is thus related by Sir Charles, though not from first-\r\nhand knowledge, since he went to Toulon in the middle of December, and\r\nstayed there till January 8th, 1884:\r\n\r\n    'During my absence I had missed one Cabinet, the first that I ever\r\n    missed, and perhaps the only one. It was held suddenly on January\r\n    3rd, and I could not arrive in time. Mr. Gladstone had come up from\r\n    Hawarden under the impression that Hartington was going to resign,\r\n    because we would not produce a redistribution scheme along with\r\n    franchise. On the morning of the 3rd, however, he received a letter\r\n    in which Hartington gave way on the understanding that Mr. Gladstone\r\n    would state the general heads of his redistribution scheme. The\r\n    subject was not named at the Cabinet of the 3rd, which dealt with\r\n    Egypt only. But the Cabinet adjourned to the 4th, and on January 4th\r\n    discussed South Africa, and also ... received a statement from Mr.\r\n    Gladstone as to his intention to state the heads of our\r\n    redistribution scheme in \"very general terms.\" On the 10th I noted:\r\n    \"The Cabinets have resulted in peace between Lord Hartington and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, but the Reform Bill will be less complete than I had\r\n    hoped.\" \"Mr. Gladstone calmed Hartington by promising not to run\r\n    away from us after franchise and before redistribution, which was\r\n    what Hartington feared he meant to do.\"'\r\n\r\nDiscussion upon the detail of the Bill was resumed, and on January 23rd,\r\n1884,\r\n\r\n    'the Chancellor (Lord Selborne), Hartington, Kimberley, and Dodson,\r\n    supported by Mr. Gladstone, forced, against Harcourt, Chamberlain,\r\n    and myself, a decision not to attach any condition of residence to\r\n    the property vote.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 28th there was a meeting of the Committee of the Cabinet\r\n    on the Franchise Bill in Mr. Gladstone's room. Chamberlain was\r\n    anxious to \"make Hartington go out on franchise.\" I asked him how he\r\n    thought it was to be done, and he replied: \"If he is restive now,\r\n    raise the question of Mr. Gladstone's statement on redistribution,\r\n    and oppose all limitations in that statement\"; and he added that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had only agreed to make the statement unwillingly to quiet\r\n    Hartington, and that if Hartington were not quieted Mr. Gladstone\r\n    would go back about it. Chamberlain and I on this occasion tried to\r\n    make the Franchise Bill more Radical, but failed, Mr. Gladstone\r\n    opposing us on old-fashioned grounds.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain came to me' (on April 26th) 'about a plan which Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was to broach at the next Cabinet, for putting off the\r\n    operation of the Franchise Act until January 1st, '86, in order to\r\n    give time for redistribution to be dealt with. We decided to oppose\r\n    it, on the ground that it would not improbably lead to our being\r\n    forced into holding an election on the old franchise.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Session Sir Charles helped on the general policy\r\nof Radicalism by one of his many minor electoral reforms. This was a\r\nBill to extend over the United Kingdom the right of keeping the poll\r\nopen till eight o'clock at night, which he had secured as a privilege\r\nfor Londoners in 1878. He notes that on February 11th he 'fought with\r\nTory obstructives as to hours of polling, and won'; but the violent\r\nresistance which was offered at first did not continue, and the Bill\r\npassed quietly in July, after time had been given to discuss it in the\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n    'On this day (July 22nd) I had a long and curious conversation with\r\n    Healy as to Irish redistribution and as to the hours of poll in\r\n    counties, with regard to which he was against extension, but said\r\n    that he was forced to support it in public. He told me that his\r\n    private opinion was that the Land Act had quieted Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Representation of the People' Bill, as the franchise measure was\r\ncalled, was introduced on February 28th, 1884, and made steady progress,\r\nLiberals finding their task facilitated by the difficulties of their\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n    'On May 7th I wrote to Chamberlain to say that I had to speak at a\r\n    house dinner of the Devonshire Club that night, and to ask him if\r\n    there was anything he wanted said, to which he replied: \"Note\r\n    Randolph Churchill's letter to Salisbury with reference to the\r\n    Conservative Caucus, and the vindication of the Birmingham one.\" It\r\n    was impossible not to notice this important letter, which\r\n    revolutionized politics for some time.'\r\n\r\n    '_May 14th_.--After the Cabinet I was informed by Chamberlain that a\r\n    week earlier, on Wednesday, May 7th, Randolph Churchill had sent to\r\n    him to know whether, if he broke with the Conservatives, the\r\n    Birmingham Liberals would support him as an independent candidate.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's letter to his agent at this time sums up the political\r\nposition:\r\n\r\n    'The Tory game is to delay the franchise until they have upset us\r\n    upon Egypt, before the Franchise Bill has reached the Lords.... Our\r\n    side will be in a humour to treat as traitors any who do not insist\r\n    that the one Bill and nothing else shall be had in view--in face of\r\n    the tremendous struggle impending in the Lords.'\r\n\r\n    'On _May 13th_ I had received a letter from Mr. Gladstone in answer\r\n    to one from me in a matter which afterwards became important, and\r\n    but for Chamberlain's strong stand would have forced me to leave the\r\n    Government. I had so strong an opinion in favour of woman's suffrage\r\n    that I could not undertake to vote against it, even when proposed as\r\n    an amendment to a great Government Bill.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles had written as follows:\r\n\r\n    'ANTIBES,\r\n    '_Easter Eve_, '84.\r\n\r\n    'I had thought till lately that the Woman's Suffrage division in\r\n    Committee on the Franchise Bill would have been so hollow that my\r\n    absence from it would not have mattered; but as I find that\r\n    Grosvenor thinks that it will not be hollow, it becomes my duty to\r\n    write to you about it. I myself think Grosvenor wrong; the woman's\r\n    suffrage people claim some 250 \"friends,\" but this they do by\r\n    counting all who, having voted with them once, have abstained from\r\n    voting for many years, and who are really foes. The division can\r\n    only be a close one if the Tory party as a body support the view\r\n    which is Northcote's, I believe, and was Disraeli's, but many of the\r\n    leaders would be bitterly opposed to such a course. Mr. Disraeli\r\n    left the woman's suffrage amendment an open question on his own\r\n    Reform Bill, and forbade the Government Whips to tell against the\r\n    amendment, but the mass of the Tory party voted in the majority. On\r\n    this next occasion there will be a larger Liberal vote against the\r\n    change than there was last year, and I do not believe that there\r\n    will be a larger Tory vote in its favour. But, supposing that I am\r\n    wrong and Grosvenor right, I should feel no difficulty in voting\r\n    against the amendment on the grounds of tactics which would be\r\n    stated, provided that Fawcett and Courtney, who are the only other\r\n    thick-and-thin supporters of woman's suffrage in the Government,\r\n    voted also, but I cannot vote if they abstain. Under these\r\n    circumstances what had I better do?'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote back on May 11th:\r\n\r\n    'The question as to the votes of members of the Government on\r\n    woman's suffrage is beyond me, and I have always intended to ask the\r\n    Cabinet, and (like the Gordon rescue) at the proper time. The\r\n    distinction appears to me as clear as possible between supporting a\r\n    thing in its right place and forcing it into its wrong place. To\r\n    nail on to the extension of the franchise, founded upon principles\r\n    already known and in use, a vast social question, which is surely\r\n    entitled to be considered as such, appears to me in principle very\r\n    doubtful. When to this is added the admirable pretext--nay, the fair\r\n    argument--it would give to the House of Lords for \"putting off\" the\r\n    Bill, I cannot see the ground for hesitation. But I quite understand\r\n    what (I believe) is your view, that there should be one rule for all\r\n    the members of the Government.'\r\n\r\n    'This was an important letter. The words \"(like the Gordon rescue)\r\n    at the proper time\" seem to show that Mr. Gladstone had already made\r\n    up his mind to send an expedition to Khartoum, although he would not\r\n    say so. The body of the letter proved that Mr. Gladstone had a very\r\n    strong opinion against me on the main point, and the consultation of\r\n    the Cabinet (which was dead against woman suffrage), and the one\r\n    rule for all members of the Government, meant that he intended to\r\n    force my vote by a Cabinet resolution, and, killing two birds with\r\n    one stone, to attack at the same time Fawcett, who had walked out on\r\n    several questions, and announced his intention of walking out on\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    'By May 22nd I had finally made up my mind that I could not vote\r\n    against the woman franchise amendment--even as a mere matter of\r\n    tactics and deference to others--if Courtney and Fawcett went out on\r\n    the matter. I could not speak to them about it because of the\r\n    \"Cabinet secret\" doctrine. Childers had been directed by the Cabinet\r\n    to sound Courtney, because he was Courtney's official superior in\r\n    the Treasury. Childers was to offer Courtney that if he would vote\r\n    against the amendment he should be allowed to speak for woman\r\n    franchise on the merits, and that none of its opponents in the\r\n    Cabinet (that is, all except myself) should speak against it on the\r\n    merits. I noted: \"On the whole I think that we shall walk out, and\r\n    not be turned out for so doing.\" I again explained my position to\r\n    Mr. Gladstone.... I felt that the majority of those voting for woman\r\n    franchise on this occasion would be Tories, voting for party\r\n    reasons, and in order to upset the Bill. I was therefore unwilling\r\n    to go out on this occasion, but thought I could not do otherwise\r\n    than make common cause with Courtney. On the merits of woman\r\n    franchise I had and have a strong opinion. I always thought the\r\n    refusal of it contrary to the public interest. The refusal of the\r\n    franchise also affects the whole position of women most\r\n    unfavourably.' [Footnote: Mrs. Fawcett wrote thanking him 'in the\r\n    name of the friends of Women's Suffrage. Your being a member of the\r\n    Cabinet made your position in the matter one of special difficulty;\r\n    but I do assure you that our gratitude is real and unfeigned.']\r\n\r\nOn May 24th Sir Charles told the Cabinet what 'I had told Mr. Gladstone\r\nin a letter which I had written to him on Easter Eve, and renewed on the\r\noccasion when he made the reply which has been quoted above.'\r\n\r\nWhen the amendment was reached, Dilke, with Fawcett and Courtney,\r\nabstained. This led to serious trouble. Sir Charles wrote on June 12th\r\nin his Diary:\r\n\r\n    'Hartington is very angry with me for not voting, and wants me\r\n    turned out for it. He has to vote every day for things which he\r\n    strongly disapproves, and this makes the position difficult. He says\r\n    that my position was wholly different from that of Fawcett and\r\n    Courtney, because I was a party to the decision of the Cabinet, and\r\n    that custom binds the minority in the collective decision of Her\r\n    Majesty's servants. This is undoubtedly the accepted theory. Poor\r\n    Hibbert was made to vote. [Footnote: Sir John Tomlinson Hibbert (d.\r\n    1908), at this time Financial Secretary to the Treasury, was an able\r\n    administrator, and held office in Mr. Gladstone's four\r\n    administrations. He assisted materially in the passing of the\r\n    Execution within Gaols Act, Married Women's Property Act, and Clergy\r\n    Disabilities Act, and was keenly interested in the reform of the\r\n    Poor Law.] I fear the Cabinet put the yoke, not of political\r\n    necessity, but of their personal prejudice against woman suffrage,\r\n    on the necks of their followers.'\r\n\r\nThe matter came up at a Cabinet on June 14th, and was made worse because\r\na letter from Lord Hartington, 'offensive in tone,' had been circulated\r\nby accident. However, Mr. Gladstone issued a minute about my walking out\r\non woman's suffrage, which concluded by a proposal, if his colleagues\r\nconcurred, to request me to remain in the Government. Thus ended a\r\npersonal crisis which, to use the French phrase, had been 'open' since\r\nmy letter to Mr. Gladstone dated 'Antibes, Easter Eve.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote to me: \"It is settled\"; and I wrote back: \"It is\r\n    settled. I would not have asked you to stand by me, as I have no\r\n    constitutional case, and your conduct in so doing could not be\r\n    defended. I always count on your friendship, but this would have\r\n    been too much.\" He replied: \"We are both right. You could not ask\r\n    me, but if you had been requested to resign I should have gone too.\"\r\n    Chamberlain had previously informed the Cabinet that, though he\r\n    differed from me about woman's suffrage, and regretted the course\r\n    that I had felt myself obliged to take, he intended to stand by me\r\n    \"to the fullest extent.\"' [Footnote: The further negotiations with\r\n    regard to Franchise and Redistribution in 1884, and the 'compact'\r\n    which ended them, are dealt with in Chapter XXXVI., infra, pp.\r\n    63-79.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWhile the great measure of the Session went steadily through its stages,\r\nvarious other questions were also occupying the Cabinet. The search for\r\na new Speaker in succession to Sir Henry Brand, who had declared at the\r\nbeginning of 1883 his unwillingness to retain office beyond that\r\nSession, was one, and not the least important, of these questions. Sir\r\nHenry James was first mentioned, and he refused.\r\n\r\n    'November, 1883. Some had thought of putting up Dodson, but the\r\n    Tories had announced that they should run Ridley in opposition to\r\n    him. There was also a difficulty about filling Dodson's place.\r\n    Trevelyan was the only man who could be put into the Cabinet without\r\n    causing the resignation of Courtney and Fawcett, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    was still in the humour which he had developed at the time of the\r\n    offer of the Chief Secretaryship to me, and declared that he would\r\n    not have the Chief Secretary in the Cabinet, the Viceroy being in\r\n    it, for this would be to have two Kings of Brentford.'\r\n\r\nOn November 10th 'Childers seemed the favourite for Speakership,' but on\r\nthe 12th it was decided that Herschell, Goschen, Arthur Peel, and\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, were to be offered the Speakership--in that order.\r\nIt was known that Herschell would refuse, it was thought that Goschen\r\nwould refuse on the ground of sight, and Peel on the ground of health,\r\nand it was intended that Campbell-Bannerman should have it. Herschell\r\ndid refuse, but Goschen accepted, and had to be shown by his doctor that\r\nhe could not see members across the House, that he would be capable of\r\nconfusing Healy with Parnell.... Peel accepted, and in spite of his bad\r\nhealth took it, and has kept it till this day (1891).'\r\n\r\nThere was also continuous discussion behind the scenes as to the two\r\nimportant measures of local government reform--for London and for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n    'By November 8th, 1883, I had succeeded in bringing Harcourt round\r\n    on the London police matter ... to let the City keep their police,\r\n    and then went to Mr. Gladstone.... After twelve o'clock at night\r\n    Harcourt joined us, and it was agreed to put both London and local\r\n    government in the Queen's Speech for 1884.'\r\n\r\nDilke spent much work upon the London Government Bill with Harcourt in\r\nJanuary of that year; but the Bill, having passed its second reading,\r\nwas not further proceeded with, owing to House of Commons difficulties.\r\nSir Charles gives the true reason in a letter to his agent:\r\n\r\n    'One unfortunate thing about the London Bill is that no one in the\r\n    House cares about it except Dilke, Firth, and the Prime Minister,\r\n    and no one outside the House except the Liberal electors of Chelsea.\r\n    This is the private hidden opinion of Harcourt and of the\r\n    Metropolitan Liberal members except Firth. I am personally so strong\r\n    for the Bill that I have not at any time admitted this to Harcourt,\r\n    and I have only hinted it to Firth....'\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Harcourt's Bill collapsed, Dilke attempted a minor\r\nimprovement for the Metropolis by framing a City Guilds Bill, which he\r\ndescribed to Mr. Gladstone as following the scheme of the Bills by which\r\nthe Universities had been reformed. But the Chancellor, Lord Selborne,\r\nfought strongly against this proposal: and nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nThe great scheme for reforming Local Government in England and Wales was\r\nmeanwhile being considered by the Committee to which it had been\r\nreferred. Besides Sir Charles Dilke, who naturally acted as Chairman,\r\nthe Committee consisted of Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Kimberley, Mr.\r\nChilders, Lord Carlingford, and Mr. Dodson (who were members of the\r\nCabinet), and Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice. With them were Sir Henry Thring,\r\nthe celebrated Parliamentary draughtsman, and Mr. Hugh Owen, the\r\nPermanent Secretary of the Local Government Board. The task of obtaining\r\nagreement, and even sometimes of maintaining order, in a Committee\r\ncomposed of persons representing such a variety of opinion, was no easy\r\none, and it tested to the full the tact and ingenuity of the Chairman.\r\nMr. Dodson, Sir Charles Dilke's immediate predecessor at the Local\r\nGovernment Board, and Lord Carlingford represented the views which had\r\nhitherto prevailed in favour of piecemeal and gradual reform. Mr.\r\nChamberlain, Lord Kimberley, and Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice were, on the\r\ncontrary, supporters of the large Bill which the Chairman had prepared;\r\nwhile Mr. Childers, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, was there mainly to\r\nkeep a vigilant watch on the local authorities, who were suspected, and\r\nnot without reason, of desiring to treat the Treasury as a sort of\r\n\"milch cow,\" a description which Mr. Gladstone had recently made current\r\nin a debate in the House of Commons, Sir Henry Thring was no mere\r\ndraughtsman. He had had an immense experience of official life, had\r\nknown every man of public importance over a long period of years, and\r\nhad very determined views on most subjects, which he never hesitated to\r\nexpress in clear-cut language and without respect of persons. Mr. Lowe,\r\nit was asserted, had once observed at a Cabinet just before Thring\r\nentered the room: 'I think before he arrives we had better carry a\r\npreliminary resolution that we are all d----d fools.' As it also\r\nhappened, Local Government was a subject on which Sir Henry Thring, and\r\nnot without reason, prided himself as an expert, and the Committee over\r\nwhich Sir Charles Dilke presided consequently had Sir Henry Thring's\r\nviews conveyed to them in unmistakable terms. One of his special objects\r\nof hostility was the Poor Law Union area, which he hoped ultimately to\r\ndestroy. On the other hand, Mr. Hugh Owen, like nearly all the Local\r\nGovernment Board officials of that time, regarded the Poor Law and\r\neverything connected with it as sacred. The controversies were\r\nfrequently fierce, and on one occasion a serious crisis almost arose\r\nowing to Lord Kimberley asking to be informed if Sir Henry Thring was\r\npreparing a Bill of his own or was acting on his instructions.\r\n\r\nThe Bill of 1884 contained almost everything now to be found within the\r\ncorners of the two great measures of 1888 and 1894, which, the one\r\npassed by a Conservative, the other by a Liberal Government, entirely\r\nrevolutionized the Local Government of England. It was, however, decided\r\nto have no Aldermen, but a few ex-officio seats were created on the\r\nCounty Council. Otherwise direct election was the method chosen for all\r\nthe new Councils. The administration of the Poor Law was kept within the\r\npurview of the Bill, after a long controversy as to the method of\r\nelecting the representatives of urban parishes on the local Poor Law\r\nauthority, when such an authority included both a borough and a rural\r\ndistrict; and the limit of population that was to entitle a borough to a\r\ncomplete independence from the county authority was raised from the\r\nfigure originally proposed of 20,000 to 100,000 and upwards.\r\n\r\nIt had been part of Sir Charles Dilke's plan to include education within\r\nthe framework of the Bill, making the Borough and District Councils the\r\nlocal education authority, with a limited superior jurisdiction in the\r\nCounty Council. But it was found that almost insurmountable difficulties\r\nwould arise in adding so immense a proposal to an already large measure,\r\nand it had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone expressed a decided view on one portion of the Bill only.\r\nHe gave his strongest support to the proposal that the price of any\r\nincreased contributions in the shape of Treasury grants should be the\r\ncomplete reform of the conflict of areas and jurisdictions, which added\r\nso much to the difficulties and the cost of local administration.\r\n[Footnote: In a speech made at Halifax on October 13th, 1885, which\r\noccupies nearly the whole of a page of the _Times_, Sir Charles Dilke,\r\nafter the fall of the Government, gave a full account of the proposed\r\nmeasure.]\r\n\r\nThe question of female councillors inevitably found its way into the\r\ndiscussions, and it was decided in their favour, notwithstanding much\r\ndivergence of opinion.\r\n\r\n    '\"I am sorry,\" Childers wrote, \"about female councillors, but I\r\n    suppose I am in a minority, and that we shall soon have women M.P.'s\r\n    and Cabinet Ministers.\" This shows that we had decided to clear up\r\n    the doubt as to the possibility of women serving as councillors, and\r\n    distinctly to give them the opportunity of so doing. When Ritchie\r\n    afterwards introduced portions of my Bill, he left this doubtful,\r\n    and the Lady Sandhurst decision was the result.' [Footnote: See for\r\n    \"Lady Sandhurst decision,\" infra, p. 17.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles differed from other members of the Committee in the desire\r\nto make the county and not the Local Government Board the sole appellate\r\nauthority from the district. 'I would, indeed,' he says, 'have gone\r\nfarther, had I been able to convince my colleagues, and have set up an\r\nelective Local Government Board for England.'\r\n\r\nOwing to the Parliamentary position, progress with any large measures of\r\nreform was, however, difficult even in the preliminary stages; and the\r\nroad seemed to get more encumbered every day, for the period now under\r\nreview indicates the high-water mark of Parliamentary obstruction in the\r\nskilled hands of the Irish Party and Lord Randolph Churchill, who\r\nsuccessfully defied the feeble reforms of procedure of 1882. So it came\r\nabout that early in 1884 Sir Charles was found rather mournfully writing\r\nto Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    'We produced to-day our last draft of the Local Government Bill, and\r\n    had our funeral meeting over it, I fear. I wish to tell you with\r\n    what spirit and skill Edmond Fitzmaurice has gone into the matter.\r\n    He is the only man I know who is fit to be President of this Board.'\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1883 Sir Charles made what was rare with him, a kind of\r\noratorical progress. He spoke at Glasgow, at Greenock, and lastly at\r\nPaisley, where he received the freedom of the burgh for his services\r\nconnected with the commercial negotiations. His speech at Paisley\r\nnaturally dealt with commercial policy, and drew an admiring letter from\r\nSir Robert Morier, who was then just bringing to a head the offer of a\r\ncommercial treaty with Spain. The Cabinet, however, had been much\r\ninclined to issue a general declaration on the subject,\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville being against all commercial\r\n    treaties, I for good ones and against bad ones, and Chamberlain for\r\n    punishing Italy for her conduct to us.' [Footnote: 'March 5th,\r\n    1883.--We turned to Tariff Treaties: Lord Granville and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone wishing for a general and abstract declaration against\r\n    them, and I, with support of Childers, urging most strongly the\r\n    other view. The proposed declaration was a gratuitous piece of\r\n    folly, for we were not called on to say anything at all.']\r\n\r\nWhen the proposed treaty with Spain, and the changes in duties which it\r\nwould involve, were before the Cabinet on November 10th,\r\n\r\n    'I am afraid I played upon Mr. Gladstone's favourite weakness (next\r\n    to praise of Montenegro)--namely, abuse of the Customs, a department\r\n    for the routine of which he always had a perfect loathing.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria's demand for investigation into the housing of the poor\r\n[Footnote: See Vol. I., p. 509.] had led to prompt administrative\r\naction, planned by Sir Charles before he left for his Christmas holiday.\r\n\r\n    'While I was at Toulon there were issued from the Local Government\r\n    Board the circulars on the Housing of the Working Class, which I had\r\n    prepared before leaving London.... One circular, December 29th, 1883\r\n    ... called on the Vestries to make use of the powers which they\r\n    possessed for regulating the condition of houses let in lodgings.\r\n    Another, December 30th ... called attention to their powers under\r\n    the Sanitary Acts, and under the Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings\r\n    Acts; and one of the same date to a similar effect went to all urban\r\n    sanitary districts throughout the country, while a further circular\r\n    with digests of the laws was sent out on January 7th, 1884. This\r\n    action was afterwards repeated by Chamberlain and others, and taken\r\n    for new, and again by Walter Long.'\r\n\r\nBut, naturally, the first man to do it stirred up a hornets' nest.\r\n_Punch_ of the first week in January, 1884, derides the 'Bitter Cry of\r\nBumbledom' against Dilke and Mr. Hugh Owen, [Footnote: Years after Sir\r\nHugh Owen, G.C.B., wrote to Dilke: 'I shall always remember that I owed\r\nmy first step in the Order of the Bath to you.'] Secretary to the Local\r\nGovernment Board:\r\n\r\n  '_Us_ to blame? That's a capital notion! Drat them and their\r\n      \"statutes\" and \"digests\"!\r\n  \"Convenience of reference.\" Ah! that is one of their imperent sly\r\n      jests.\r\n  Removal of Noosances? Yah! If we started on _that_ lay perniskers\r\n  There is more than a few in the Westries 'ud feel suthin' singein'\r\n      their wiskers,\r\n  Or BUMBLE'S a Dutchman. Their Circ'lar--it's mighty obliging--defines\r\n      'em,\r\n  The Noosances namely; I wonder if parties _read_ Circ'lars as signs\r\n      'em,\r\n  If so, Local Government Boarders must be most oncommonly knowin',\r\n  And I'd like to 'eave bricks at that DILKE and his long-winded\r\n      myrmidon OWEN.\r\n  The public's got Slums on the brain, and with sanitry bunkum's have\r\n      busted.\r\n  _We_ make a more wigorous use of the powers with which we're\r\n      entrusted!\r\n  Wy, if we are at it all day with their drains, ashpits, roofs, walls,\r\n      and windies,\r\n  Wot time shall we 'ave for our feeds and our little porochial\r\n      shindies!\r\n  And all for the 'labouring classes'--the greediest, ongratefullest\r\n      beggars.\r\n  I tell you these Radical lot and their rubbishy littery eggers,\r\n  Who talk of neglected old brooms, and would 'ave _us_ turn to at their\r\n      handles,\r\n  Are Noosances wus than bad smells and the rest o' their sanitry\r\n      \"scandals.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's main object in local government was to decentralize, and\r\nhe sought to move in this direction by stimulating the exercise of\r\nexisting powers and the habit of responsibility in local popularly\r\nelected bodies. But inquiry was also necessary.\r\n\r\n    'On February 8th, 1884, it had been decided to appoint a Royal\r\n    Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    had expressed his wish that I should be chairman of the Commission,\r\n    on which the Prince of Wales desired to serve.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 9th it was settled that Bodley, my secretary, should be\r\n    secretary to the Royal Commission. I immediately wrote to Manning to\r\n    ask him to serve, and he consented on February 12th.'\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's name lent another distinction to the list, which was\r\ncompleted by February 16th. [Footnote: In addition to the Prince, the\r\nCardinal, and Lord Salisbury, Dilke's Commission consisted of Lord\r\nBrownlow, Lord Carrington, Mr. Goschen, Sir Richard Cross, the Bishop of\r\nBedford (Dr. Walsham How), Mr. E. Lyulph Stanley, Mr. McCullagh Torrens,\r\nMr. Broadhurst, Mr. Jesse Collings, Mr. George Godwin, and Mr. Samuel\r\nMorley. To these were added later Mr. Dwyer Gray and Sir George\r\nHarrison, for Ireland and Scotland respectively.]\r\n\r\n    'A very difficult question arose about his precedence. I referred it\r\n    to the Prince of Wales, who said that he thought Manning ought to\r\n    take precedence, as a Prince, after Princes of the Blood, and before\r\n    Lord Salisbury.'\r\n\r\nThe nice question was referred to Lord Salisbury and to many other\r\nauthorities, and finally to Lord Sydney, who wrote, from the Board of\r\nGreen Cloth, 'that in 1849, at the Queen's Levee at Dublin Castle, the\r\nRoman Catholic Primate followed the Protestant Archbishop, but he was\r\nnot a Cardinal. _A fortiori_ I presume a Cardinal as a Prince of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire would have precedence next to the Prince of Wales. It\r\nshowed, however, extraordinary ignorance on the part of the Lord Steward\r\nto suppose that the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal Court were the same\r\nthing.' [Footnote: The story of how the question of precedence was\r\nsettled in Manning's favour is given in detail in Mr. Bodley's _Cardinal\r\nManning, and Other Essays_ (1912).]\r\n\r\n    'It was on February 12th that I received Sir Henry Ponsonby's letter\r\n    announcing the approval of the Queen to the Prince serving on the\r\n    Commission as an ordinary member under my chairmanship, and the\r\n    Prince of Wales expressed his pleasure at the Queen's approval.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 22nd the members of the Cabinet present (at a meeting\r\n    at the Foreign Office) discussed my proposal to put Miss Octavia\r\n    Hill on my Royal Commission, no woman having ever sat on one; and\r\n    Harcourt having refused to sign the Commission if it contained a\r\n    woman's name, Mr. Gladstone, Kimberley, and Northbrook sided with\r\n    me, and Hartington with Harcourt. Lord Granville said that he was\r\n    with me on the principle, but against me on the person. After this\r\n    Mr. Gladstone went round, and said that the decision of the Cabinet\r\n    was against me. Asquith put several women on a Royal Commission a\r\n    few years later, but refused them the precedence to which they were\r\n    entitled, and gave every male member precedence before them.'\r\n\r\nMr. Lyulph Stanley was included to represent his sister, Miss Maude\r\nStanley, whom Sir Charles Dilke had wished to appoint.\r\n\r\nLater in the year Sir Charles successfully asserted the principle for\r\nwhich he was contending, by putting women on the Metropolitan Asylums\r\nBoard. Lady Ducie had the honour of the first invitation to serve, and\r\nSir Charles afterwards added Miss Maude Stanley and others. The question\r\nof qualification was discussed, only to be set aside. The law officers\r\n\r\n    'knew the women would be knocked off if anyone raised the question,\r\n    and in Lady Sandhurst's case this was afterwards made clear; but no\r\n    one did raise it against my nominees, and they stayed on for life.'\r\n\r\n    'March 7th.--I had now had several interviews with Lord Salisbury\r\n    and the Prince of Wales about the Royal Commission, and the first\r\n    meeting of the Commission itself was held on March 5th.... We really\r\n    began our work on March 14th. My work was heavy at this time, with\r\n    sittings of the Commission twice a week, for which I had to prepare,\r\n    as I did all the examination in chief of the witnesses, and, indeed,\r\n    found them all and corresponded with them in advance.'\r\n\r\n    'The Commission was dull, although it produced a certain amount of\r\n    valuable evidence, and almost the only amusing incident which\r\n    occurred in the course of many months was Lord Salisbury making a\r\n    rather wild suggestion, when Broadhurst put down his pen, and,\r\n    looking up in a pause, said with an astonished air, \"Why, that is\r\n    Socialism!\" at which there was a loud laugh all round.'\r\n\r\n    'I wrote to Lord Salisbury on May 7th to ask him for his suggestions\r\n    as to what I called \"remedies\" to be proposed by our Commission, as\r\n    I had already made my own list, and wished from this time forward to\r\n    examine each witness on the same heads, with a view to collecting a\r\n    body of evidence for the Report, intended to lead to recommendation\r\n    and legislation upon these particular points....'\r\n\r\nSome of Lord Salisbury's suggestions were 'valuable, and still throw\r\nmuch light on his temporary Radicalism, which unfortunately soon wore\r\noff.'\r\n\r\n    'It is clear that on May 9th, 1884, he was contemplating throwing\r\n    the rates upon the land, and making a long step towards leasehold\r\n    enfranchisement. Lord Salisbury's proposal on this last head was\r\n    virtually one for \"judicial rents,\" as far as principle went, and\r\n    destructive of the old view of the rights of holders of landed\r\n    property--although, perhaps, not one carrying much advantage to\r\n    anybody!'\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commission proposed the rating of vacant land, but\r\nbefore it was drafted Lord Salisbury condemned the proposal in a\r\nmemorandum attached to the Report, which Mr. Goschen supported by\r\nanother independent minute.\r\n\r\nSir Charles sent also a request for the suggestion of 'remedies' to\r\nCardinal Manning, who, says a scribbled note, 'is our only\r\nrevolutionary!'\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, May 16th, at the Commission the Cardinal handed me his\r\n    list of suggestions, which were not only revolutionary, but ill-\r\n    considered, and I have to note how curiously impracticable a\r\n    schemer, given to the wildest plans, this great ecclesiastic showed\r\n    himself. He suggested the removal out of London, not only of prisons\r\n    and infirmaries (which no doubt are under the control of public\r\n    authorities), but also of breweries, ironworks, and all factories\r\n    not needed for daily or home work, as a means of giving us areas for\r\n    housing the working class, suggestions the value or practicability\r\n    of which I need hardly discuss.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 18th, I having proposed to add to the Royal Commission a\r\n    member for Ireland and a member for Scotland before we began to take\r\n    the Scotch and Irish evidence, and having proposed Gray, the\r\n    Nationalist member and proprietor of the _Freeman's Journal_, who\r\n    was the highest Irish authority upon the subject, Ponsonby replied:\r\n    \"Although the Queen cannot say she has a high opinion of Mr. Gray,\r\n    Her Majesty will approve of his appointment, and that of the Lord\r\n    Provost of Edinburgh, on the Royal Commission.\" Sir Henry Ponsonby\r\n    was a worthy successor of General Grey--a wise counsellor of much\r\n    prudence, invaluable to the Queen.'\r\n\r\n    'Early in June Chamberlain came a good deal to the Local Government\r\n    Board to consider the evidence which he was to give before my\r\n    Commission. His view was mine--that in the Metropolis the housing of\r\n    the working classes could only be dealt with by imposing the most\r\n    stringent obligations on the owners of property on which artisans'\r\n    dwellings already existed; and Chamberlain was willing to go so far\r\n    as to reserve such property permanently for the object, with State\r\n    interference to secure fair rents. I argued with him that a strong\r\n    case could be made against him on such points as extension of trade\r\n    from the City into Whitechapel, extension of fashionable dwellings\r\n    from Mayfair into Chelsea, and so forth. He then fell back upon a\r\n    proposal for exchange, and said that at all events there was no\r\n    practical alternative to his view, an opinion in which I agreed. On\r\n    a later day in June the Cardinal wrote to me expressing his regret\r\n    for absence from the Commission, \"at which I should like to have\r\n    seen Lord Salisbury examine Mr. Chamberlain.\" But the Commission\r\n    kept up its character for dulness, and nothing noteworthy occurred.'\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Housing, to which so much of Sir Charles's time was\r\ndevoted, had an importance, now forgotten, in the modern development of\r\nSocial Reform.\r\n\r\n    'Up to five-and-twenty years ago,' said a writer in a daily\r\n    newspaper on Social Reform in 1910, 'when the living Sir Charles\r\n    Dilke was the President of the Local Government Board, no one cared\r\n    how the poor lived or fared. They could reside in the most\r\n    ramshackle tenements in insanitary slums, for which, by the way,\r\n    they were charged exorbitant rents, far higher than what they would\r\n    now pay for the well-ventilated and well-equipped self-contained\r\n    houses of the London County Council and building companies which\r\n    provide accommodation for the industrial classes. Sir Charles saw\r\n    the abject and helpless condition of the people of London, and\r\n    resolved, when he succeeded to office, to try and remedy the evils\r\n    under which they laboured. His enthusiasm in the cause of the poor\r\n    caught on, and in a short time \"slumming\" became a fashionable\r\n    craze. Committees were formed--the premier one being that which had\r\n    its headquarters at the Mansion House--to improve the dwellings of\r\n    the poor. In a short time the movement became a great success, and,\r\n    that there should be no falling back, medical officers of health,\r\n    whose sole time was to be devoted to their duties, and battalions of\r\n    sanitary inspectors, were appointed in every district in the\r\n    Metropolis.'\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that 'no one cared,' for outside the great official\r\nmovement which Sir Charles Dilke directed were the devoted social\r\nworkers on whom he called for evidence at the Commission, and to whose\r\nlabours he always paid tribute; nor must be forgotten the Queen's fine\r\nletter calling on her Ministers to act. But, as Miss Octavia Hill wrote\r\nto him on March 22nd, 1884, 'you among all men realize most clearly that\r\naction is more needed than words.'\r\n\r\nThe question of Housing is so inextricably bound up with all the\r\nconditions of the poor, with hours of work and with those questions of\r\nwages which Sir Charles had first studied with John Stuart Mill, that it\r\nis natural to find him presiding over another inquiry which, though\r\nprepared for in 1884, was carried out in the first weeks of 1885.\r\n\r\n    'At the beginning of the new year of 1885 there were completed the\r\n    final arrangements for my presidency of the Industrial Remuneration\r\n    Conference, which was held at the end of January at Prince's Hall,\r\n    Piccadilly, on three mornings and three afternoons. A large sum of\r\n    money had been given for the purpose of promoting the consideration\r\n    of the best means for bringing about a more equal division of the\r\n    products of industry between capital and labour, so that it might\r\n    become possible for all to enjoy a fair share of material comfort\r\n    and intellectual culture--possible for all to lead a dignified life,\r\n    and less difficult to lead a good life. The trustees who were\r\n    appointed decided to promote a conference on the present system\r\n    whereby the products of industry are distributed between the various\r\n    classes of the community, and the means whereby that system should\r\n    be improved. They then divided the subject into subheads, and asked\r\n    certain persons to read papers, and an extraordinarily interesting\r\n    series of discussions was the result. In my own speech in opening\r\n    the proceedings I called attention to the nature of the German\r\n    Governmental Socialism, and quoted Prince Bismarck's speeches,\r\n    showing what was the object which the Prussian Government had in\r\n    view--namely, to try experiments as to the labour of man with the\r\n    view \"to reach a state of things in which no man could say: 'I bear\r\n    the burden of society, but no one cares for me.'\" This Conference\r\n    first introduced to London audiences all the leaders of the new\r\n    Unionism, and future chiefs of the Dockers' Strike. Among the\r\n    speakers were Arthur Balfour and John Burns, who told us of his\r\n    dismissal from his employment as an engineer at Brotherhoods\r\n    [Footnote: A great engineering firm at Chippenham in Wiltshire.] for\r\n    attending as delegate of the \"S.D.F.\"'\r\n\r\n    'I am convinced,' wrote Mr. Burns in 1914 from the Office of the\r\n    Local Government Board, over which he then presided, 'that few, if\r\n    any, conferences held in London in recent years have done more good\r\n    for the cause of social progress than the Industrial Remuneration\r\n    Conference of 1885. The Conference focussed public opinion and\r\n    sympathy upon a large number of important questions, which have\r\n    since made greater headway than they would have done if the\r\n    Conference had not taken place. I have the highest opinion of the\r\n    value of its work, and of the good influence it exercised in\r\n    stimulating inquiry and action in many directions.'\r\n\r\nSix years later, when Sir Charles was before the electors of the Forest\r\nof Dean as their chosen candidate, he discussed the whole question of\r\nlimiting by law the hours of work; and he told them how his experience\r\nof those days spent in the chair of the Conference in 1885 had converted\r\nhim 'from a position of absolute impartiality to one strongly favourable\r\nto legislative limitation.'\r\n\r\nA speech delivered by him in January, 1884, to the Liberals of Bedford\r\nPark, brings together the two sides of his work. For him political\r\nreform lay at the very base of social reform; in his opinion the\r\ngovernment of London and extension of the franchise ought not to be\r\nparty questions at all; his desire was to call the whole people of the\r\ncountry into citizenship of the State, and he would make exercise of the\r\nvoting power compulsory and universal. People said there was no 'magic\r\nin the vote.' He wanted as many citizens as possible to have the right\r\nto consider 'the sort of magic by which many persons contrived to live\r\nat all under the existing social conditions.'\r\n\r\nA proof of his friendship for the cause of labour, and of his desire to\r\nassociate manual workers with the administration, was given by him in a\r\nuse of patronage, in which he departed from his principle of confining\r\nit to the men in his office, tendering the chance of official employment\r\nto two leading representatives of labour in August, 1884.\r\n\r\n    'I had a \"good\" appointment under the Local Government Board to\r\n    make, and I offered it not only to Broadhurst, but afterwards to\r\n    Burt. I expected both of them to decline, which both did, but I\r\n    should have been glad if either of them would have taken it, for\r\n    both were competent.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAs to his departmental work, Sir Charles notes in July, 1884:\r\n\r\n    'I have said but little of my work at the Local Government Board,\r\n    because, though heavy, it was of an uninteresting nature.'\r\n    [Footnote: There are, however, many entries, of which this for 1884\r\n    is typical:\r\n\r\n    'September 8th.--With the Local Government Board Inspectors Fleming\r\n    and Courtenay to the worst villages in England. I made my way from\r\n    Bridport to Yeovil, Nettlecombe, Powerstock, Maiden Newton, Taunton\r\n    and its neighbourhood, Wiveliscombe, Bridgwater, and North\r\n    Petherton.'\r\n\r\n    'Between September 21st and 27th I was visiting workhouses and\r\n    infirmaries every day, and on the 27th I completed my visits to\r\n    every workhouse, infirmary, and poor-law school in or belonging to\r\n    Metropolitan Unions.]\r\n\r\n    'My chief new departure was in connection with the emigration of\r\n    pauper children, which had been long virtually prohibited, and which\r\n    I once more authorized.'\r\n\r\nMr. Preston Thomas has fortunately preserved a note of another\r\ninnovation. The Guardians of a certain union in Cambridgeshire had\r\ncommitted the offence of spending three shillings and threepence of\r\npublic money on toys for sick pauper children in the workhouse\r\ninfirmary. The case had occurred before, and the Board's legal advisers\r\nhad held the expenditure to be unwarrantable, and had surcharged the\r\noffending Guardians. Dilke was questioned in the House about the matter,\r\nand admitted the previous decisions, but said that the Board had changed\r\nits mind. So the children at Wisbech kept their toys; and not only that,\r\nbut a circular went out from Whitehall suggesting that workhouse girls\r\nshould be supplied with a reasonable number of skipping-ropes and\r\nbattledores and shuttlecocks.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of cholera in French and Spanish ports disquieted the\r\npublic, and as early as July 25th, 1883,\r\n\r\n    'I circulated a draft of a Bill to meet the cholera scare, which I\r\n    carried into law as the Diseases Prevention Act. I did not much\r\n    believe in cholera, but I took advantage of the scare to carry some\r\n    useful clauses to deal with smallpox epidemics, the most important\r\n    clause being one giving compulsory powers for acquiring wharves, by\r\n    which we could clear the London smallpox hospitals, removing the\r\n    patients to the Atlas and Castalia floating hospitals on the Thames.\r\n    I was a strong partisan of the floating hospitals for smallpox. I\r\n    used to pay frequent visits to them, and in the early summer of 1885\r\n    stayed there from Saturday to Monday; and I used also to go to the\r\n    camp at Darenth to which we removed convalescents from the ships.'\r\n\r\nHe notes that he was revaccinated before one of these visits:\r\n\r\n    'September, 1884.--My arm was in a frightful condition from the\r\n    vaccine disease, though I was still a teetotaller, now of about ten\r\n    years' standing.'\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn recess:\r\n\r\n    'In the course of this week I was every day inspecting schools and\r\n    asylums, the imbecile asylums at Caterham, Leavesden, and many\r\n    others; and my smallpox wharves were also giving me much trouble, as\r\n    Rotherhithe and the other places showed strong objections to them,\r\n    which I was, however, able to remove.'\r\n\r\nBut the veteran official who has been already quoted attaches a very\r\ndifferent importance to this whole matter. In France and Spain, says Mr.\r\nPreston Thomas, the Governments were chiefly concerned to deny the\r\nexistence of any danger. In England the medical staff demanded such an\r\nincrease in the number of inspectors as would enable them to take proper\r\nprecautions at the ports.\r\n\r\n    'Fortunately, Sir Charles Dilke had become President of the Board,\r\n    and carried with him a political weight which his two worthy, but\r\n    not particularly influential, predecessors, Sclater-Booth and\r\n    Dodson, had not enjoyed. He had one or two passages of arms with\r\n    Childers, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when it was attempted to\r\n    interfere with the estimates which he had put forward, and which he\r\n    declined to defend in Parliament if they were curtailed. There was\r\n    an appeal to the Premier, and Sir Charles Dilke had come off\r\n    victorious. So when he proposed largely to increase the medical\r\n    staff in order to make a sanitary survey of the entire coast, the\r\n    Treasury's sanction was given, and the work was carried out with\r\n    far-reaching results. The authorities of the ports ... were\r\n    impressed with a sense of their responsibilities; not only did they\r\n    organize special arrangements for the inspection of ships from\r\n    infected countries, but they also recognized the necessity of\r\n    setting their own houses in order in a literal sense, and many of\r\n    them for the first time displayed activity in providing pure water,\r\n    efficient sewerage, and a prompt removal of nuisances.... The\r\n    communications of the Board's expert with the local authorities and\r\n    their officers ... did something more than lay the foundations of\r\n    that Public Health System ... which has saved us from any outbreak\r\n    of cholera for the last quarter of a century, [Footnote: Written in\r\n    1909.] and has reduced the mortality from preventable diseases to a\r\n    rate which such countries as France and Germany may well envy.'\r\n    (_Work and Play of a Government Inspector_, p. 148.)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, too, that the first definite action of the Housing\r\nCommission concerned the Local Government Board:\r\n\r\n    'It was decided to ask Parliament to alter its standing orders with\r\n    regard to persons of the labouring class displaced under\r\n    Parliamentary Powers, and to insist on local inquiry in such cases,\r\n    and the approval of the Local Government Board after it has been\r\n    shown that suitable accommodation had been found for the people\r\n    displaced. This was done by resolution of both Houses of\r\n    Parliament.'\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe friendliness which had grown up between Sir Charles and Lord\r\nSalisbury, and was later in this year to be of public service, is\r\nillustrated by an amusing note in the Memoir. Sir Charles Dilke was\r\nnever a clubman, and had incurred the remonstrances of Sir M. Grant Duff\r\nby refusing to take up membership of the Athenaeum, as he was entitled\r\nto do on entering the Cabinet. But there is a club more august than the\r\nAthenaeum, and here also Dilke showed indisposition to enter. He notes\r\nin May:\r\n\r\n    'Before this I had been much pressed to accept my election at\r\n    Grillion's Club on Lord Salisbury's nomination. The Club considers\r\n    itself such an illustrious body that it elects candidates without\r\n    telling them they are proposed, and I received notice of my election\r\n    accompanied by some congratulations. I at first refused to join, but\r\n    afterwards wrote to the secretary: \"Carlingford has been to see me\r\n    about Grillion's, and tells me that I should have the terrible\r\n    distinction of being the first man who ever declined to belong to\r\n    it, an oddity which I cannot face, so ... I will ask your leave to\r\n    withdraw my refusal.\" On May 3rd I breakfasted at the Club for the\r\n    first time, Mr. Gladstone and a good many other Front Bench people,\r\n    chiefly Conservatives, being present.'\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the Housing Commission had also increased the frequency\r\nof intercourse between Sir Charles Dilke and the Prince of Wales, who\r\nwas in this May\r\n\r\n    'showing a devotion to the work of my Commission which was quite\r\n    unusual with him, and he cut short his holiday and returned from\r\n    Royat to London on purpose for our meeting.'\r\n\r\nOn January 11th, 1884, the Duke of Albany wrote to Sir Charles that he\r\nhad hoped to call, but was not sure whether he had returned to England.\r\n'I write to express a hope that your opinions will coincide with the\r\nrequest which I have made to Lord Derby ... namely, to succeed Lord\r\nNormanby as Governor of Victoria.' He referred to their talk at\r\nClaremont of his 'hopes, which were not realized, of going to Canada.'\r\n'The Prince went on to say that, as I had been in Australia, I was \"a\r\nmore competent judge than some others of the Ministers as to the\r\nadvisability of my appointment.\"' He spoke of the matter as one in which\r\nhe was 'vitally interested,' and his 'sincere trust' in Sir Charles's\r\nsupport. The Cabinet agreed to the appointment,\r\n\r\n    'unless the Queen persisted in her opposition. The matter had been\r\n    discussed at Eastwell (where I stayed with the Duchess of Edinburgh\r\n    from the 19th to the 21st) by me with the Duchess as well as with\r\n    Princess Louise and Lorne, who were also there. The Duke of\r\n    Edinburgh was not there, but at Majorca in his ship. The party\r\n    consisted of Nigra, the Italian Ambassador, the Wolseleys, Lord\r\n    Baring and his sister Lady Emma, and Count Adlerberg of the Russian\r\n    Embassy, in addition to the Princess Louise and Lome already named.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 24th there was a regular Cabinet. The Queen had written\r\n    that she would not allow Prince Leopold to go to Victoria.'\r\n\r\nOn March 28th 'we heard of the death of Prince Leopold,' codicils to\r\nwhose will Sir Charles had witnessed in the preceding year. 'All\r\nnewspapers wrote of the pleasant boy as though he had been a man of\r\nliterary genius.'\r\n\r\nBut anxious as Sir Charles had been to further Prince Leopold's wishes,\r\nand in spite of his 'respect for his memory,' he could not allow a\r\nprinciple, for which he always fought, to be waived.\r\n\r\n    'The Queen wrote to Mr. Gladstone at this time (April 5th) with\r\n    regard to provision for the child and possible posthumous child of\r\n    the Duke of Albany, and I wrote to Mr. Gladstone that I could not\r\n    possibly agree to any provision for them, for which there was no\r\n    exact precedent, without the Select Committee which I had previously\r\n    been promised as regarded any new application.'\r\n\r\nOn April 22nd Mr. Gladstone alluded 'to a letter to the Queen, but he\r\ndid not read it to us,' and Sir Charles again insisted 'upon inquiry\r\nbefore the proposal of any provision for which there was no direct\r\nprecedent.'\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet of Monday, April 28th, we found that the Queen was\r\n    indignant with us for our refusal to make further provision for the\r\n    Duchess of Albany.... None of the precedents of the century\r\n    warranted provision for children in infancy. It was agreed that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was to write to the Queen again, but \"our negative answer\r\n    is only applicable to the case where the children are in infancy.\"\r\n    In other words, we did not wish to bind those who might come after\r\n    us, but the phrase was not to commit us as to what we would do in\r\n    five years' time.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\n\r\n1884\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1883 the destruction of Hicks's army had made clear to\r\nall that the Soudan was, for the time at least, lost to Egypt; and close\r\nupon this disaster in the central region had followed defeats on the Red\r\nSea coast. But Egyptian garrisons were holding out at Sinkat, some fifty\r\nmiles from the port of Suakim, and at Tokar, only twenty miles from the\r\ncoast. In October, 1883, a small force sent to relieve Sinkat was cut up\r\nby the Dervishes under Osman Digna; in November, a larger column of 500,\r\naccompanied by the British Consul, was utterly routed in an attempt to\r\nreach Tokar. General Baker, with his newly formed gendarmerie, was then\r\nordered to Suakim. He desired to enlist the services of Zebehr Pasha, a\r\nfamous leader of men, but a former dealer in slaves. To this the British\r\nauthorities objected, and Zebehr was not sent. Baker went, attempted\r\nwith 3,500 troops to reach Tokar, and on February 2nd, 1884, lost 2,000\r\nof them near the wells of El Teb. Both Tokar and Sinkat soon after fell\r\ninto the hands of the Dervishes.\r\n\r\nLong before this event, the evacuation of the Soudan had been decreed. A\r\nperemptory mandate from the British Government was sent to Cherif Pasha,\r\nthe Egyptian Prime Minister, who, as he had intimated that he would do,\r\nresigned rather than be responsible for giving up so vast a possession.\r\nOn January 8th, Nubar took office to carry out the prescribed policy.\r\nBut the problem was how to get away the garrisons, and, since England\r\nhad ordered evacuation, the Egyptian Government looked to England for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n    'On January 16th I noted: \"Baring wants to make us send a British\r\n    officer to conduct the retreat from Khartoum. I have written to Lord\r\n    Granville to protest.\" Baring had been pressing for an answer to his\r\n    suggestion named above. I had all along fought against the \"Hicks\r\n    Expedition,\" and this seemed a consequence. The Egyptian Government\r\n    had resigned, and the sole supporter of the abandonment policy among\r\n    the Egyptians in Egypt was the Khedive himself; but Nubar was sent\r\n    for, and accepted office (with a number of cyphers) to carry it into\r\n    effect. On January 10th Lord Granville had telegraphed to Baring,\r\n    without my knowledge, \"Would Gordon or Wilson be of use?\" [Footnote:\r\n    Colonel Sir Charles Wilson. See his _Life_, by Sir Charles Watson,\r\n    p. 244.] On the 11th Baring replied, \"I do not think that the\r\n    services of Gordon or Wilson can be utilized at present\"; and after\r\n    a reply had been received I saw the telegrams. The earlier Gordon\r\n    suggestions by Granville, now revealed by E. Fitzmaurice from the\r\n    Granville Papers, and expounded in Cromer's (1908) book, were never\r\n    before the Cabinet. [Footnote: Life of Lord Granville, vol. ii., pp.\r\n    381, 382.]\r\n\r\n    'On the 14th Lord Granville telegraphed to Baring: \"Can you give\r\n    further information as to prospects of retreat from (? for) army and\r\n    residents at Khartoum, and measures taken? Can anything more be\r\n    done?\" Power, our Consular Agent at Khartoum, had also been told\r\n    that he might leave. On January 16th Baring telegraphed: \"The\r\n    Egyptian Government would feel obliged if Her Majesty's Government\r\n    would send out at once a qualified British officer to go to Khartoum\r\n    with full powers, civil and military, to conduct the retreat.\" Lord\r\n    Granville then telegraphed for Gordon, and on the 18th I was\r\n    summoned suddenly to a meeting at the War Office in Hartington's\r\n    room, at which were present, before I arrived, Hartington, Lord\r\n    Granville and Lord Northbrook, and Colonel Gordon. Gordon said that\r\n    he believed that the danger at Khartoum had been \"grossly\r\n    exaggerated,\" and that the two Englishmen there had \"lost their\r\n    heads\"; he would be able to bring away the garrisons without\r\n    difficulty. We decided that he should go to Suakim to collect\r\n    information and report on the situation in the Soudan. This was the\r\n    sole decision taken, but it was understood that if he found he could\r\n    get across he should go on to Berber. Gordon started at night on the\r\n    same day.\r\n\r\n    'On January 22nd the first subject mentioned was that of Egyptian\r\n    finance, a Rothschild loan for six months being suggested, but\r\n    nothing settled. The Cabinet approved our action in sending Gordon.\r\n    But they had before them a great deal more than what we had\r\n    done--namely, what he had done himself. On his road between London\r\n    and Brindisi he had prepared a series of decrees which he\r\n    telegraphed to us and which we telegraphed to Baring. In these he\r\n    announced the restoration to the various Sultans of the Soudan of\r\n    their independence, and he made the Khedive say: \"I have\r\n    commissioned General Gordon, late Governor-General of the Soudan, to\r\n    proceed there as my representative, and to arrange with you\" (the\r\n    peoples of the Soudan) \"for the evacuation of the country and the\r\n    withdrawal of my troops.\" He then made the Khedive appoint him\r\n    \"Governor-General for the time necessary to accomplish the\r\n    evacuation.\" He also telegraphed to the Hadendowa and Bishareen\r\n    Arabs of the desert between Suakim and Berber, directing them to\r\n    meet him at Suakim, and saying that he should be there in fourteen\r\n    days. In sending these we told Baring: \"Suggestions made by Gordon.\r\n    We have no local knowledge sufficient to judge. You may settle\r\n    terms, and act upon them at once, as time presses, or after\r\n    consultation with him.\" Mr. Gladstone did not object, although\r\n    strongly opposed to our undertaking responsibility in the Soudan,\r\n    because Gordon still spoke in every sentence of conducting the\r\n    evacuation; but reading his proclamations in the light of his\r\n    subsequent change of mind, and desire to stay in Khartoum and be\r\n    supported by force, it seems clear that he had deceived us and did\r\n    not really mean evacuation. This, however, could not yet be seen\r\n    from the words he used. I wrote to Lord Granville on January 22nd,\r\n    to point out that in addition to the danger in the Soudan, which had\r\n    been foreseen, there was a risk that Gordon might get himself\r\n    carried off alive into the desert by some of the Arab chiefs that he\r\n    was to meet, and that in that case we should have to send an\r\n    expedition after him.\r\n\r\n    'On January 31st there was a meeting at the War Office about Egypt\r\n    between Hartington, Lord Granville, Edmond Fitzmaurice and myself.\r\n    As the facts about Gordon were beginning to be misrepresented in the\r\n    Press, Lord Granville set them down in writing. [Footnote: See _Life\r\n    of Gladstone_, vol. iii., pp. 152-155; Life of Granville, vol. ii.,\r\n    pp. 381-385 and 512, where a letter from Lord Cromer on General\r\n    Gordon's instructions is printed; and chap. xvi. ('Gordon, and the\r\n    Soudan') in _The Development of the European Nations, 1870-1900_, by\r\n    Dr. J. Holland Rose.] It had been stated, and was afterwards\r\n    repeated by Justin McCarthy in his history, that the mission on\r\n    which we sent Gordon \"was in direct opposition to his own ideas. He\r\n    was not in favour of the abandonment of the Soudan or the evacuation\r\n    of Khartoum.\" It had also been said that the whole mission had been\r\n    forced upon us by the Press--i.e., by Stead, in the _Pall Mall\r\n    Gazette_. Lord Granville gave me a memorandum saying that Gordon had\r\n    acknowledged that the statements in the _Pall Mall_ were \"not\r\n    accurate.\" Lord Granville went on to say that he did not think that\r\n    Gordon could be said to have \"changed his mind. It appeared in his\r\n    conversation with Wolseley on the Tuesday that he (Gordon) was not\r\n    decided in his opinion, and that he was as likely to recommend one\r\n    course as another.... I told him that we would not send him out to\r\n    re-open the whole question, and he then declared himself ready to go\r\n    out merely to help in the evacuation of the interior of the Soudan.\r\n    He is not remarkably precise in conversation, though I found him\r\n    much more so than Wolseley had led me to expect.\"\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville had previously written to me on this point: \"The\r\n    papers seem to think that Gordon is a new discovery by the\r\n    Government under pressure of the Press. It happens that I consulted\r\n    Malet on the subject months ago. But after communicating with Cherif\r\n    he sent me an unfavourable reply. I subsequently consulted Baring,\r\n    who agreed with Cherif that it was best not to do so. I consulted\r\n    him again after the change of Ministry, with the same result. On the\r\n    other hand Gordon was in Syria, having declared before leaving\r\n    England that he would not enter the Egyptian service. It was only on\r\n    his return to England that I heard indirectly that, although he had\r\n    no wish to go, he would willingly obey the orders of Her Majesty's\r\n    Government and act under the instructions of Sir Evelyn Baring and\r\n    the orders of General Stephenson. Having got the full concurrence of\r\n    Sir E. Baring by telegraph, the matter was arranged.\"\r\n\r\n    'The fact was that it was Wolseley, Gordon's friend, who suggested\r\n    that he should be sent and who induced him to go; but Wolseley's\r\n    account of the matter could not, I fear, be trusted, as he is more\r\n    inclined to attack Gladstone than to let out anything which in the\r\n    light of subsequent events might be unpleasant to himself.\r\n\r\n    'Edmond Fitzmaurice had drawn up an elaborate memorandum for our\r\n    meeting at the War Office, which I have, with my own corrections. He\r\n    thought that the public was hostile to us on four grounds: our\r\n    non-interference to stop Hicks; [Footnote: General Hicks advanced\r\n    west of the Nile, contrary to the views of Lord Dufferin, who wished\r\n    him to limit his advance to the province lying between the\r\n    bifurcation of the Blue and White Nile. See the _Life of Dufferin_,\r\n    by Alfred Lyall, vol. ii., pp. 56, 57.] our failure to withdraw the\r\n    garrisons of Khartoum and of the Equatorial Provinces in time to\r\n    avoid disaster; our failure to relieve Sinkat; and, on the other\r\n    hand, our decision to force the Egyptians to evacuate the Soudan in\r\n    the face of defeat, a decision which had overturned Cherif Pasha.\r\n    With regard to Hicks, we could only tell the truth, which was that\r\n    our policy was to limit, not extend, the sphere of our\r\n    responsibilities in Egypt; that we followed the advice we got, which\r\n    was either for doing exactly what we did, or for a moderate support\r\n    of Hicks, which latter we declined. Our opponents were prophesying\r\n    after the event. We should have taken a great responsibility had we\r\n    absolutely forbidden the Egyptian Government to make use of their\r\n    own troops (not including any portion of the army officered by\r\n    English officers under Sir Evelyn Wood for the defence of Lower\r\n    Egypt) to crush the Mahdi. Hicks had at first defeated the Mahdi in\r\n    every encounter and cleared him out of the whole country east of the\r\n    Nile. [Footnote: Hicks Pasha complained that directly Lord Dufferin\r\n    had left Cairo for Constantinople, he ceased to received adequate\r\n    support from the Egyptian Government (_Life of Dufferin_. vol. ii.,\r\n    p. 55).] The main point, however, and that of present importance,\r\n    was our forcing upon the Egyptians the policy of evacuating the\r\n    Soudan after Hicks's defeat. Fitzmaurice wrote: \"The Soudan could\r\n    not be held without the assistance of England, and it is not a\r\n    British interest to hold the Soudan.... The cost of the Soudan is\r\n    one of the causes which ruin the Egyptian Treasury.\" Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice then went on to explain in his memorandum the reasons\r\n    which had forced us to wait until January 4th before we had told the\r\n    Egyptian Government as to withdrawal from the interior of the\r\n    Soudan, including Khartoum--\"that the Ministers must carry out the\r\n    advice offered them, or forfeit their places.\"\r\n\r\n    'On January 9th we had been told from Khartoum that, if a retreat\r\n    was ordered at once, it could be safely effected; and it was on the\r\n    next day, the 10th, that we offered the services of Colonels Gordon\r\n    and Sir Charles Wilson, which were declined. It was not till January\r\n    16th that we were able to induce the Egyptians, even under their new\r\n    withdrawal Government, to ask for a British officer, and on the 18th\r\n    Gordon was sent. Gordon, however--who had left us to go to Suakim,\r\n    and for whom we had drawn up a route from Suakim to Berber, in case\r\n    he should go forward, and negotiated with the tribes for his free\r\n    passage, and of whom we had telegraphed to Baring, \"He does not wish\r\n    to go to Cairo\"--went to Cairo, \"at Baring's\" suggestion. He did not\r\n    even land at Alexandria, but he was stopped by Baring at Port Said\r\n    when on his way to Suakim, Baring sending Sir Evelyn Wood to meet\r\n    him. Baring had already given orders, through Nubar, to commence the\r\n    evacuation. Gordon had telegraphed to us requesting us to send\r\n    Zebehr Pasha to Cyprus--that is, arbitrarily to arrest him and\r\n    deport him. Yet, when he reached Cairo, at his own wish he had had\r\n    an interview with this very man, and shortly afterwards he\r\n    telegraphed to us, asking leave to take him to Khartoum and to make\r\n    him virtually Governor of the Soudan, which, indeed, would have been\r\n    entirely outside our power; for Forster, supported by the Anti-\r\n    Slavery Society and the Conservatives, would at once have upset us\r\n    in the House of Commons and reversed the policy. Wolseley had\r\n    already begun to press as early as the 23rd for the sending of an\r\n    expedition via Suakim and Berber.\r\n\r\n    'On January 26th Gordon had left for Khartoum without any\r\n    communication with us upon the question whether he should go, and\r\n    the last thing we had from him before he started was a memorandum in\r\n    which, among other things, he said of the Soudan: \"Few men can stand\r\n    its fearful monotony and deadly climate.\" He insisted on absolute\r\n    authority, and Stewart, who was with him, did the same for him, and,\r\n    backing up his chief's arguments at this moment against Zebehr, said\r\n    that Zebehr's return would undoubtedly be a misfortune to the\r\n    Soudanese, and also a direct encouragement to the slave trade.\r\n\r\n    'On February 1st we received a telegram from Baring, telling us that\r\n    Gordon had taken with him proclamations of evacuation, and other\r\n    proclamations less direct, with authority to issue those which he\r\n    thought best; but \"he fully understands that he is to carry out the\r\n    policy of evacuation, in which he expressed to me his entire\r\n    agreement. I have sent home by last mail my instructions to him,\r\n    which leave no doubt on this point, and which were drafted at his\r\n    request and with his full approval.... There is no sort of\r\n    difference between his views and those entertained by Nubar Pasha\r\n    and myself.\" Here ended our responsibility, because it must be\r\n    remembered that Gordon at Khartoum was entirely outside our reach,\r\n    and openly told us that he should not obey our orders when he did\r\n    not choose to do so. From this moment we had only to please\r\n    ourselves as to whether we should disavow him and say that he was\r\n    acting in defiance of instructions, and must be left to his fate, or\r\n    whether we should send an expedition to get him out.\r\n\r\n    'Doubtless \"we\" wavered between these two opinions. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    from the first moment that Gordon broke his orders was for the\r\n    former view. Lord Hartington from the first moment was for the\r\n    latter. Chamberlain and I supported Hartington, although we fully\r\n    recognized Gordon's violations of his orders in much of his action\r\n    at Khartoum, where he changed the policy agreed upon with Baring and\r\n    with us to that expressed by him in the words, \"Smash the Mahdi.\"\r\n    Many members of the Cabinet went backwards and forwards in their\r\n    opinion, but the circumstances were of incredible difficulty, and it\r\n    must be remembered that we were not sure of being allowed to carry\r\n    out either policy; and not only was it difficult to decide which of\r\n    the two was right, but it was also difficult to decide whether\r\n    either policy was possible--that is to say, whether the one adopted\r\n    would not be immediately upset by a Parliamentary vote. The Liberal\r\n    party in the House of Commons was divided on the matter, the Whigs\r\n    generally wishing for an expedition, and the Radicals being hot for\r\n    immediate abandonment of the Soudan, which meant abandonment of\r\n    Gordon. The Conservatives were divided; most of them probably wished\r\n    for an expedition, but they were afraid to say so; and Randolph\r\n    Churchill, whose strength at this time was immense, was in full\r\n    agreement with Labouchere and Wilfrid Lawson, and was denouncing the\r\n    retention of the Soudan as a violation of the principles of freedom.\r\n\r\n    'Gordon on his way up and on his arrival at Khartoum issued\r\n    extraordinary proclamations. Arriving there alone, but with\r\n    incredible prestige, he was hailed as father of the people; he\r\n    burned the taxation books and the whips upon the public place; he\r\n    released the prisoners from the gaol; he sent away the commander of\r\n    the garrison with the words, \"Rest assured you leave this place as\r\n    safe as Kensington Park.\" He declared the Mahdi \"Sultan of\r\n    Kordofan.\" Gordon, of all men in the world, sanctioned slavery by\r\n    another written document; and he then asked us to send the arch\r\n    slave-driver Zebehr to his help, which we thought on Baring's\r\n    truthful opinion of the moment that we ought not to do, and which we\r\n    certainly could not have done. I thought and still think that Gordon\r\n    had lost his senses, as he had done on former critical occasions in\r\n    his life; but the romantic element in his nature appealed to me,\r\n    and, while I could not but admit that he had defied every\r\n    instruction which had been given to him, I should have sent an\r\n    expedition to bring him out, although thinking it probable that when\r\n    Wolseley reached him he would have refused to come.'\r\n\r\nWhile Gordon was on his way to Khartoum, which he reached on February\r\n18th, the defeat at El Teb had occurred, and the question arose as to\r\nwhat should be done in the Eastern Soudan.\r\n\r\n    'On February 6th the Cabinet met twice, and at our second meeting it\r\n    was decided to send marines to Suakim.\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, February 7th, I visited the Admiralty with Pauncefote\r\n    in order to take in hand the defence of the Red Sea coast against\r\n    the Arabs, and then I went to the War Office, where I met\r\n    Hartington, Northbrook, Wolseley, and Cooper Key, in order to\r\n    concert steps. When I passed through the Secretary's room after the\r\n    meeting, and stayed for a moment to talk with Hobart and Fleetwood\r\n    Wilson, the Duke of Cambridge (whose room opened into theirs, and\r\n    who had evidently been lying in wait for me) rushed out and carried\r\n    me off into his room, and made much of me, with an enthusiastic\r\n    desire to help an expedition. At night, Hartington, Chamberlain, and\r\n    I met in Hartington's room and decided to press for relief of\r\n    Gordon.\r\n\r\n    'On February 8th Chamberlain wrote to me, \"I should like to\r\n    telegraph to Baring, 'If you think that employment of British troops\r\n    could relieve beleaguered garrisons in Soudan without danger, you\r\n    are authorized to concert measures with Evelyn Wood.'\" A Cabinet was\r\n    called at the wish of Hartington, Chamberlain, and myself, for this\r\n    day upon this point. Hartington, Harcourt, Northbrook, Carlingford,\r\n    Chamberlain, and I, were for asking Gordon if a demonstration at\r\n    Suakim would help him. Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville, very strong\r\n    the other way, broke up the meeting sooner than agree.'\r\n\r\n    'Gordon had acted as Governor-General of the Soudan without having\r\n    told us that he had accepted this appointment, and we had had to ask\r\n    on February 4th a question which had been answered by Baring on the\r\n    5th, to the effect that Gordon had \"at his own request\" been\r\n    appointed Governor-General. On February 6th Baring had telegraphed\r\n    stating that Gordon had said that it was possible he might go to the\r\n    Mahdi and not be heard of for two months, as the Mahdi might keep\r\n    him as a hostage for Zebehr. On the same day we telegraphed to\r\n    Baring approving his having told Gordon that there would be the\r\n    strongest objections to his placing himself in the Mahdi's power. On\r\n    February 7th we received a despatch by post from Baring in which he\r\n    informed us that, while Gordon would probably ask for Zebehr, \"it\r\n    would certainly not be desirable to send him ... for he is\r\n    manifestly animated by a feeling of deep resentment against General\r\n    Gordon.\" At the same time Baring forwarded a shorthand report of the\r\n    meeting between Gordon, Zebehr, Baring, Stewart, Colonel Watson, Sir\r\n    Evelyn Wood, and Nubar, at which Zebehr had told Gordon that he had\r\n    entrusted his son to him, \"and told you he was thenceforth your son.\r\n    He was only sixteen years of age.... I entrusted my son to you....\r\n    But you killed my son whom I entrusted to you. He was as your own\r\n    son.\" _Gordon_: \"Well, well, I killed my own son. There is an end of\r\n    it.\" _Zebehr_: \"And then you brought my wives and women and children\r\n    in chains to Khartoum, a thing which for my name in the Soudan was\r\n    most degrading.\"\r\n\r\n    'By the same mail we received a despatch from Baring in which he\r\n    made it clear that Gordon's instructions had Gordon's full approval.\r\n    \"He expressed to me his entire concurrence in the instructions. The\r\n    only suggestion he made was in connection with the passage in which,\r\n    speaking of the policy of abandoning the Soudan, I had said, 'I\r\n    understand also that you entirely concur in the desirability of\r\n    adopting this policy.' General Gordon wished that I should add the\r\n    words 'and that you think it should on no account be changed.' These\r\n    words were accordingly added.\"\r\n\r\n    'Between this Cabinet and the next we received, on February 9th, a\r\n    telegram from Baring to the effect that he was sending home a letter\r\n    from Gordon to the King of the Belgians in which he urged the king\r\n    to appoint him Governor of the Equatorial Provinces, Gordon's idea\r\n    being to go there from Khartoum; and Baring stated his own view that\r\n    we should forbid Gordon to go south of Khartoum. In his letter,\r\n    which was dated February 1st, Gordon said that the King of the\r\n    Belgians had told him that he would take over the Provinces with the\r\n    troops in them, when Gordon had been at Brussels immediately before\r\n    we sent him out; but not one word had Gordon ever breathed of this;\r\n    and when we first heard of it he was virtually beyond our reach,\r\n    seated, when our answer arrived, at Khartoum, and little disposed to\r\n    listen to us, although on some points, for a few days, he pretended\r\n    to listen.\r\n\r\n    'On February 12th Baring telegraphed that he hoped that \"H.M.G. will\r\n    not change any of the main points of their policy\"; but, as will be\r\n    seen a little later, Baring soon changed his own, adopting the new\r\n    policy of Gordon, and pressing it upon us.\r\n\r\n    'On February 12th it was decided, against Mr. Gladstone, to send an\r\n    expedition to the Red Sea Coast.\r\n\r\n    'On February 13th we had before us a statement which had been made\r\n    the previous day by Randolph Churchill, to the effect that in the\r\n    summer of 1883 General Gordon had offered to go to the Soudan, and\r\n    that the Government had telegraphed to him accepting his offer, and\r\n    then written to him declining it. Lord Granville instructed me to\r\n    say that the whole story was one gigantic concoction. I then asked\r\n    Hartington if he knew anything about it; and Lord Wolseley\r\n    ultimately discovered that Randolph Churchill had confused the Congo\r\n    with the Nile, an amusing example of his harum-scarum recklessness.\r\n    Gordon had telegraphed from Syria in October for leave to accept\r\n    service under the King of the Belgians on the Congo, and the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief had replied by telegraph that the Secretary of\r\n    State declined to sanction his employment. In transmission the word\r\n    \"declines\" was changed into \"decides,\" which exactly reversed its\r\n    sense, so that Gordon had received a confirming letter consistent\r\n    with the telegram as sent, but exactly reversing the sense of the\r\n    telegram as received. He had told the story which Churchill had\r\n    heard, but altered from one side of Africa to the other.'\r\n\r\nOn February 14th Sir Charles made effective use of this blunder in the\r\ndebate upon the vote of censure concerning Egypt. It was a debating\r\nspeech which, he himself notes, 'had extraordinary success.' Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill had been more than usually aggressive, and Sir\r\nCharles hammered him with detailed facts. [Footnote: He comments on the\r\n20th on the opinions expressed to him as to his powers of debate: 'This\r\nis a curious position for a man who has no natural gift of speech. I can\r\nremember when I was the worst speaker that ever spoke at all.'] The\r\ndebate on this vote of censure, occasioned by the fall of Sinkat,\r\noccupied the House for five days. The motion was defeated by forty-nine.\r\n\r\n    'On February 14th I found that Lord Granville had not answered an\r\n    important question from Baring about Wood's Egyptians which had been\r\n    received by us on the 13th, and that because he had not seen it. We\r\n    had started a red label as a danger-signal for pressing notes; but\r\n    Lord Granville's room was full of red-labelled notes not touched.'\r\n\r\nHe records his remonstrances with Lord Granville as to the non-\r\nemployment of Sir Evelyn Wood's Egyptians. On February 18th there was a\r\nCabinet 'partly upon this subject. It was decided to send reinforcements\r\nto Egypt.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 21st there was another Cabinet which again discussed\r\n    the Egyptian question and decided to send Wood's Egyptians to\r\n    Assouan. On the 15th Gordon had reassured us by telling us that all\r\n    communication between Cairo and the Soudan would be finally at an\r\n    end within three months' (that is, that evacuation would be easily\r\n    carried out). 'On February 18th we had heard that on the 17th Gordon\r\n    had issued a proclamation saying that the Government would not\r\n    interfere with the buying and selling of slaves; and this telegram,\r\n    having got out from Cairo, produced a storm in England. On the 19th\r\n    there occurred another matter which was considered by the Cabinet at\r\n    the same time--the absolute refusal of Admiral Hewett, and very\r\n    proper refusal, to issue a proclamation calling on the chiefs from\r\n    Suakim to go peacefully to meet Gordon at Khartoum, inasmuch as the\r\n    Admiral knew \"that English troops are about to be sent against the\r\n    people in question.\" The issue of this proclamation had been\r\n    recommended by Wolseley, who thinks that Governments exist for the\r\n    purpose of deceiving enemies in war for the benefit of generals.\r\n\r\n    'On the same day, February 19th, we had received a telegram which\r\n    had been sent off from Khartoum by Gordon on the 18th, asking that\r\n    Zebehr should be sent to the Soudan, \"be made K.C.M.G., and given\r\n    presents.\" This was backed by Stewart, so far as that he said that\r\n    someone should be sent, adding that he was not sure whether Zebehr\r\n    was the best man. It was clear from Gordon's proposed conditions\r\n    that Zebehr was to be free to prosecute the slave trade. In another\r\n    memorandum on the same day Gordon said that we must \"give a\r\n    commission to some man and promise him the moral support of\r\n    H.M.G.... It may be argued that H.M.G. would thus be giving ...\r\n    moral support to a man who will rule over a slave state.... This\r\n    nomination of my successor must ... be direct from Her Majesty's\r\n    Government.... As for the man, H.M.G. should select one above all\r\n    others, namely Zebehr.\" Baring now backed this opinion up, so that\r\n    we were face to face with an absolute change of front on the part of\r\n    Gordon and Baring, and a partial change of front on the part of\r\n    Stewart. On the other hand, Baring, at the same time when he told us\r\n    to appoint Zebehr, added: \"I am quite certain that Zebehr hates\r\n    Gordon bitterly, and that he is very vindictive. I would not on any\r\n    account risk putting Gordon in his power.... He is, to my personal\r\n    knowledge, exceedingly untruthful.... I cannot recommend his being\r\n    promised the moral support of Her Majesty's Government. He would\r\n    scarcely understand the phrase, and, moreover, I do not think he\r\n    would attach importance to any support which was not material.... I\r\n    doubt the utility of making conditions. Zebehr would probably not\r\n    observe them long.\" Baring further proposed that Zebehr should be\r\n    given money, and he left us to judge of the effect of the whole\r\n    scheme on public opinion in England. Colonel Watson, who had been\r\n    present at the meeting between Zebehr and Gordon, informed us that\r\n    to let Gordon and Zebehr be together in the Soudan \"would entail the\r\n    death of either one or other of them.\" On the 21st Gordon\r\n    telegraphed to the newspapers explaining away his slave trade\r\n    proclamation, but its terms were even worse than could have been\r\n    gathered from the first summary, which was all that we had received.\r\n\r\n    'On February 21st we received the text of Gordon's proclamation,\r\n    which contained the words, \"I confer upon you these rights, that\r\n    henceforth none shall interfere with your property,\" and spoke with\r\n    apparent regret of \"severe measures taken by Government for the\r\n    suppression of slave traffic, and seizure and punishment of all\r\n    concerned.\"\r\n\r\n    'On February 26th there was a meeting of Mr. Gladstone, Hartington,\r\n    Childers, Chamberlain, Dodson, and myself, to approve a telegram\r\n    from Hartington to General Graham; [Footnote: General Graham was in\r\n    command of the expedition to Suakim.] and on the next day again, the\r\n    27th, a meeting of Lord Granville, Hartington, Northbrook, and\r\n    myself, which decided to invite the Turk to show himself at the Red\r\n    Sea ports. On the 29th there was a Cabinet at which it was decided\r\n    that the Turk must approve our future ruler of the Soudan, and that\r\n    British troops were to go as far as Assouan if Baring thought it\r\n    necessary.\r\n\r\n    'On February 27th Gordon had frightened us out of our senses by\r\n    telegraphing that, having put out his programme of peace, and\r\n    allowed time to elapse, he was now sending out his troops to show\r\n    his force; and another telegram from him said: \"Expedition starts at\r\n    once to attack rebels.\" On the same day he telegraphed that he had\r\n    issued a proclamation \"that British troops are now on their way, and\r\n    in a few days will reach Khartoum.\" It was very difficult to know\r\n    what to do with this amazing lie: solemnly to point out to him by\r\n    telegraph that it was a lie was hardly of much use with a man of\r\n    Gordon's stamp; and what was done was to send a strong private\r\n    telegram to Baring to communicate with him about it, but the result\r\n    was not encouraging, for it was the first ground for the desperate\r\n    quarrel which Gordon afterwards picked with Baring, and for his\r\n    charge against Baring of inciting the Government to drive him to his\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    'On the next day, February 28th, Gordon, having heard that Zebehr\r\n    was refused, telegraphed his policy of smashing up the Mahdi, which,\r\n    however, he seemed inclined to attempt with a most inadequate force.\r\n    \"Mahdi must be smashed up. Mahdi is most unpopular, and with care\r\n    and time could be smashed.... If you decide on smashing Mahdi, then\r\n    send another hundred thousand pounds, and send 200 Indian troops to\r\n    Wady Haifa, and an officer to Dongola under pretence to look out\r\n    quarters for troops.... At present it would be comparatively easy to\r\n    destroy Mahdi.\" Gordon had also telegraphed to Baring to recommend\r\n    that 3,000 black Egyptian troops should be kept in the Soudan, and\r\n    completely throwing over the evacuation policy. Baring added for\r\n    himself: \"There are obviously many contradictions in General\r\n    Gordon's different proposals\"; but he went on to express his\r\n    agreement in Gordon's new policy, strongly supported the selection\r\n    of Zebehr, and sneered at us for having regard to uninstructed\r\n    opinion in England. On the same day Gordon telegraphed: \"If a\r\n    hundred British troops were sent to Assouan or Wady Halfa, they\r\n    would run no more risk than Nile tourists, and would have the best\r\n    effect.\" At the same time Baring said: \"I certainly would not risk\r\n    sending so small a body as 100 men.\" It will be seen in how great a\r\n    difficulty the Government were placed; but Baring's position was, in\r\n    fact, as difficult as our own. We were evidently dealing with a wild\r\n    man under the influence of that climate of Central Africa which acts\r\n    even upon the sanest men like strong drink.\r\n\r\n    'On the same day Gordon telegraphed to us completely changing his\r\n    ground about Suakim. He had previously prevented our doing anything\r\n    except trying to relieve the towns blockaded, but on March 1st told\r\n    us to do something to draw the Hadendowa down to Suakim. On the 2nd,\r\n    General Graham having beaten the Arabs at Teb, the Admiral asked us\r\n    to send more troops and to threaten Osman Digna's main force, a\r\n    suggestion which concurred with Gordon's. And on March 5th the\r\n    Cabinet met and decided that, while it was impossible to send Zebehr\r\n    to the Soudan, General Graham was to be allowed to attack Osman\r\n    Digna's main force.... Chamberlain then suggested that I should go\r\n    to Egypt: Hartington evidently thought that somebody should go, and\r\n    thought he had better go himself. Lord Granville would not have\r\n    either, as might have been expected.... I suggested a way out of the\r\n    Zebehr difficulty, and wrote to Chamberlain: \"If I were sent out to\r\n    do this, I believe I should get away the forces from the interior\r\n    and have Zebehr elected, entirely without our action, by the\r\n    Notables at Khartoum. On the whole, this would do if we did not do\r\n    it. This would, in my opinion, be improved by Turkish approval under\r\n    Turkish suzerainty, but that you do not like.\" Chamberlain answered:\r\n    \"Perhaps we cannot help having Zebehr, but surely we ought not to\r\n    promote him, directly or indirectly; not only because he is a slave-\r\n    hunter, but also because he will probably attack Egypt sooner or\r\n    later, and very likely with the help of our subsidy.\" I replied: \"I\r\n    am quite clear that we must not set up Zebehr, but if we retire we\r\n    cannot prevent his election by the Notables; and they would elect\r\n    him.\" In the meantime Gordon had completely thrown over Baring's\r\n    suggestion that Zebehr should be sent (but so sent that he and\r\n    Gordon should not be in the Soudan together) by telegraphing that\r\n    the combination at Khartoum of Zebehr and himself was \"an absolute\r\n    necessity,\" and that it would be \"absolutely necessary\" for him to\r\n    stay at Khartoum with Zebehr for four months; and Stewart had now\r\n    completely come over to Gordon's policy about Zebehr personally. On\r\n    the other hand, Baring and the military authorities in Egypt were\r\n    unanimously opposed to the idea of sending a small British force to\r\n    Wady Halfa.\r\n\r\n    'On March 7th it was decided to give an inland district to the\r\n    Abyssinians, but not to offer them a port (which was what they\r\n    wanted), on account of its not being ours to give away from the\r\n    Turks. The Cabinet would not hear of receiving a Turkish\r\n    Commissioner at Cairo.\r\n\r\n    'On March 11th we further considered pressing demands from Gordon\r\n    and Baring for Zebehr. Mr. Gladstone had taken to his bed, but was\r\n    known to be strongly in favour of sending Zebehr. The Cabinet were\r\n    unanimous the other way, and Hartington was sent to see Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, we waiting till he returned. When he came back, he\r\n    laconically stated what had passed as follows: \"He thinks it very\r\n    likely that we cannot make the House swallow Zebehr, but he thinks\r\n    he could.\" Morley has told this, but the words which he took\r\n    verbally from me are less good. [Footnote: _Life of Gladstone_, vol.\r\n    iii., p. 159.] Baring on the 6th had recommended a further attack on\r\n    Osman Digna, which he thought might open the Berber route. On the\r\n    9th we received Gordon's replies to our telegrams of the 5th,\r\n    showing that he had done nothing towards the evacuation of Khartoum\r\n    except by sending away the sick. He admitted that it was possible\r\n    that \"Zebehr, who hates the tribes, did stir up the fires of revolt,\r\n    in hopes that he would be sent to quell it. It is the irony of fate\r\n    that he will get his wish if sent up.\" On the same day Baring\r\n    informed us that it was clear that Gordon now had no influence\r\n    outside Khartoum, and that he contemplated the despatch of British\r\n    troops. The Anti-Slavery Society had strongly protested against the\r\n    employment of Zebehr, and they pointed out to us the records of\r\n    murders \"in which this man has stood the foremost and the principal\r\n    actor.... Countenance ... of such an individual by the British\r\n    Government would be a degradation for England and a scandal to\r\n    Europe.\" W. E. Forster, amid loud cheers from the Conservatives,\r\n    protested in advance in the House of Commons against the policy of\r\n    sending Zebehr. On March 11th we had received in the morning from\r\n    Baring twelve telegrams from Gordon, of the most extraordinary\r\n    nature, which Baring had answered: \"I am most anxious to help and\r\n    support you in every way, but I find it very difficult to understand\r\n    exactly what it is you want.\" Besides deciding that Zebehr could not\r\n    be sent, the Cabinet changed its mind about the employment of Turks\r\n    in the Red Sea, and decided that they could not be allowed to go\r\n    there at present.\r\n\r\n    'On March 13th the matter was again considered by a Cabinet, which\r\n    was not called a Cabinet as Mr. Gladstone was in bed and Chamberlain\r\n    was at Birmingham, and on the 14th we met again, still retaining our\r\n    opinion; and on Sunday, the 16th, Mr. Gladstone at last unwillingly\r\n    gave up Zebehr as impossible. [Footnote: _Life of Granville_, vol.\r\n    ii., p. 388.]\r\n\r\n    'I had been at this time working out the facts connected with the\r\n    two routes to Khartoum in case an expedition should be sent, and had\r\n    made up my own mind in favour of the Nile route; Wolseley still\r\n    being the other way.\r\n\r\n    'On March 17th, I wrote to Lord Northbrook to protest against a\r\n    proclamation which had been issued by the Admiral and General at\r\n    Suakim offering a reward for Osman Digna, and I wrote also to\r\n    Hartington upon the same subject, stating that I would not defend\r\n    it, and that if it were \"not disapproved, and the disapproval made\r\n    public, I cannot remain a member of the Government.\" Northbrook\r\n    would not admit that he had disapproved it, but Hartington did, and\r\n    also informed me that Northbrook had telegraphed. Lord Granville\r\n    agreed with me that the proclamation was not defensible, and it was\r\n    as a fact withdrawn, although the Admiral was very angry.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone had gone down to Coombe, near Wimbledon. On March\r\n    22nd we held a Cabinet without him.... Harcourt was now writing to\r\n    me in favour of the view \"that we must get out of Egypt as soon as\r\n    possible at any price. The idea of our administering it or of the\r\n    Egyptian army defending it is equally out of the question.\" On the\r\n    25th we had another Cabinet without Mr. Gladstone. Turning to\r\n    Gordon, we decided that a force was not to be sent to Berber; but I\r\n    noted in my diary: \"It will _have_ to be sent next autumn, I\r\n    believe\"; but when I said to Berber, it must be remembered, of\r\n    course, that there were two ways of reaching Berber, and Lord\r\n    Hartington, Brett, and I, now turned steadily to the consideration\r\n    of which of those two ways should be taken. It will be remembered\r\n    that we already had a report in print as to the Suakim-Berber route.\r\n    [Footnote: See p. 33; 'We had drawn up a route from Suakim to\r\n    Berber.'] We now obtained from Wolseley a general report, which was\r\n    afterwards printed and circulated to the Cabinet on April 8th. Lord\r\n    Wolseley, preparing for the sending of a military force to Khartoum\r\n    this autumn, stated that his force must be exclusively British, for\r\n    he doubted whether the very best of our Indian regiments could stand\r\n    the charges of the Arabs, besides which our natives took the field\r\n    encumbered with followers. Lord Roberts, who was not given to\r\n    boasting, told me, long afterwards, that he, on the other hand, was\r\n    sure that he could have marched from Suakim to the Nile and Khartoum\r\n    with an exclusively Indian force. It is the case that our best\r\n    Gurkha troops have sometimes stood when white troops have run.\r\n    Wolseley had now come round to a boat expedition, which I had been\r\n    for a long time urging, upon information which I had obtained for\r\n    myself from the Admiralty, and which was afterwards printed by the\r\n    Foreign Intelligence Committee at the Admiralty, and circulated to\r\n    the Cabinet in April, a further document upon the subject being\r\n    circulated to the Cabinet in May. It must be remembered that the\r\n    date of passing the cataracts was settled for us by the high Nile,\r\n    and that there was only one time of year at which the expedition\r\n    could be safely sent.\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet of March 25th further decided that Graham must soon be\r\n    brought away from Suakim.\r\n\r\n    'On the next evening, March 26th, when the Ministers were dining\r\n    with the Speaker, we received a very unpleasant telegram from\r\n    Baring, pointing, we thought, to a possible resignation unless it\r\n    was promised to send an expedition to Khartoum. I suggested the\r\n    following answer: \"We adhere to our instructions of the 25th, 160\r\n    Secret. We cannot send an expedition now, and entertain the gravest\r\n    objection to contemplating an expedition in the autumn.\" This answer\r\n    was rejected in favour of one suggested by Mr. Gladstone and Lord\r\n    Granville. Our telegram 160 Secret had been an absolute refusal, and\r\n    my additional words had been intended by me slightly to open the\r\n    door, which was as much as I could hope that the Cabinet would do.\r\n    But the telegram actually sent on March 28th (165 Secret, extended\r\n    in 191) was to the effect that we were unable to alter the\r\n    instructions, and it was accompanied by two long despatches,\r\n    virtually written by Harcourt, and afterwards laid before\r\n    Parliament, explaining our reasons for not sending Zebehr and for\r\n    not sending an expedition. Gordon had been communicating with us\r\n    with difficulty, as the telegraph was broken from time to time, but\r\n    he had told us that if he was to evacuate Khartoum he wished to\r\n    resign his commission and to take all his steam vessels and stores\r\n    to the equatorial provinces, \"which he would consider under the King\r\n    of the Belgians.\" This Baring had told him he must not do. Baring\r\n    had rejected every possible alternative except the sending of\r\n    Zebehr, and Zebehr we could not have sent. In discussing the\r\n    question of an expedition to Khartoum, Baring had told us that\r\n    Gordon was \"not in any immediate danger. He has provisions for six\r\n    months.\" Gordon himself had telegraphed: \"As I have been\r\n    inconsistent about Zebehr, it is my fault, and I should bear the\r\n    blame if Zebehr is sent, and should put up with the inconvenience if\r\n    he is not.\" He had himself told us that he had provisions for six\r\n    months, but had after this informed us that provisions were still\r\n    coming in freely to Khartoum--as late as after March 15th, a week\r\n    later than the date at which he had told us that he had six months'\r\n    provisions in the town. I had made up my mind that we must send an\r\n    expedition, but I did not agree with Baring that it was physically\r\n    possible to send an expedition at this moment, and thought that if\r\n    sent at high Nile it would be in time. On the 23rd, after Gordon's\r\n    defeat, by treachery and shooting, of the two black Pashas, Gordon\r\n    telegraphed: \"I think we are now safe, and that as the Nile rises we\r\n    shall account for the rebels.\" This we received on March 31st.\r\n\r\n    'On March 27th there was a Cabinet without Chamberlain, who was\r\n    listening to George Russell's speech which I had got him leave to\r\n    make, and without Mr. Gladstone, who was still ill. The Cabinet\r\n    decided against an expedition to Khartoum, but the Chancellor' (Lord\r\n    Selborne) 'gave us to understand that he should resign if one were\r\n    not sent in the autumn, and Harcourt intimated that he should resign\r\n    if one were sent. Lord Granville observed that no Cabinet could last\r\n    a day if it was to be exposed to going to pieces on differences as\r\n    regards the future. Harcourt proposed to \"clear out\" of Egypt\r\n    immediately. Lord Granville won an easy victory over him by proving\r\n    that only three weeks ago he had wanted to take Egypt under our\r\n    protection. Harcourt then said that as long ago as November, 1883,\r\n    he had spoken in favour of clearing out. \"Yes,\" said Lord Granville,\r\n    \"so you did; but I said three weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n    'On March 29th there was a Cabinet at Coombe Warren. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    seemed pretty well, and had at least one good laugh. He still\r\n    regretted Zebehr. The Cabinet considered Gordon, what we should do\r\n    with slavery at Suakim, and House of Commons business.'\r\n\r\nAbout this date the main body of the British troops was withdrawn from\r\nSuakim in accordance with the decision of March 25th. They had inflicted\r\ndefeats on Osman Digna at El Teb, and again at Tamanieb; many Dervishes\r\nand not a few English had been killed, but no effect of moment had been\r\nproduced, and the road to Berber was not opened.\r\n\r\nA new complication now arose. Egypt was presented with Europe's total\r\nclaims for the losses to Europeans in the burnings at Alexandria. They\r\namounted to four millions and a half. How was this demand to be met?\r\nUnder the Law of Liquidation established in 1880, Egypt could not borrow\r\nwithout the consent of the five Powers who had constituted the\r\nCommission of Liquidation. The demand presented to Egypt had to be\r\nconsidered by the one Power which was now _de facto_ supreme in Egypt.\r\n\r\n    'On April 2nd there was an important Cabinet called on Egyptian\r\n    finance. It began, of course, on something else. We discussed the\r\n    future of Suakim; the replies to be given in the House on the next\r\n    day as to Gordon; and then Childers' views upon Egyptian finance;\r\n    while we were considering these, there came a letter from Northcote\r\n    with the questions that he intended to put on the next day'\r\n    (questions which could only be answered by a full statement of\r\n    policy on all the points of the Egyptian problem). 'After going back\r\n    to this, we went on again to finance, and decided to call a\r\n    conference of the Great Powers to alter the Law of Liquidation. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had unwillingly consented to meet the Powers by proposing\r\n    to reduce the charge for the British army; and he was anxious to get\r\n    the money for the British taxpayer out of a borrowing operation on\r\n    the future value of the Canal Shares. Chamberlain and I decided that\r\n    if he did this the Tories would declare that Mr. Gladstone had\r\n    become a pensioner on the bounty of Lord Beaconsfield. There was\r\n    some talk at this Cabinet as to whether we should guarantee the\r\n    Egyptian debt, to which I was opposed. Chamberlain had at one time\r\n    been friendly to such an operation, but had now \"gone round\" on the\r\n    ground that we could not \"carry it against the Tories and the\r\n    Radicals.\" \"Is there anything else?\" said Chamberlain to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone as the Cabinet was breaking up. \"No,\" said Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    \"we have done our Egyptian business and we are an Egyptian\r\n    Government.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the 'Egyptian Government' at Westminster had two\r\nmain subjects of concern--the question of extricating Gordon with the\r\ngarrisons, and the question of dealing with the international situation,\r\npartly diplomatic and partly financial. France, increasingly unfriendly\r\nto Great Britain, was above all unfriendly in regard to Egypt: while\r\nBismarck, doing his best to foment this quarrel, was at the same time\r\nweakening Great Britain by menaces in Africa and Australasia, and the\r\ndanger of a Russian advance in Central Asia hung like a thundercloud\r\nover the whole situation. [Footnote: Sir Charles wrote to Mr. Brett on\r\nNovember 15th, 1884: 'I told Herbert Bismarck when he was here that it\r\nwas very silly of his father to get in the way of our Egypt plans, for\r\nFrance would not go to war about them, and therefore, after threatening,\r\nhe would have to look on and see the things he had threatened against\r\ndone quietly.']\r\n\r\nThere were three groups of opinion in the Government in regard to the\r\nSoudan. The first was for an expedition which should carry with it the\r\nconsequence of occupation more or less prolonged. Another was against\r\nany expedition and in favour of immediate evacuation. A third section--\r\nincluding Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain--accepted the need of an\r\nexpedition, but was determined that occupation should not follow. It was\r\nincumbent on this last-named group to suggest a positive policy, and\r\nDilke, as will be seen, had his plan ready. There was a further decision\r\nto be taken. When once an expedition was in contemplation, the route and\r\nthe character of the expedition had to be fixed. On this matter also Sir\r\nCharles had early formed a resolve, but neither he nor anyone else could\r\npin the Cabinet to a clear course of action.\r\n\r\n    'At this time' (April 2nd) 'Chamberlain wrote to me of Egypt: \"Once\r\n    more Hartington, and you and I, are at opposite poles. For one, I do\r\n    not mean to be forced any further in the direction of protectorate.\"\r\n\r\n    'Although they would not admit it, the Cabinet were rapidly coming\r\n    round at this time to an autumn Gordon expedition, and Chamberlain\r\n    wrote to me: \"I believe it will come to this in the end\"; while\r\n    Northbrook was in favour of an expedition. I then made up a list\r\n    from private information showing that six of us were favourable to\r\n    an expedition, as against five the other way--several members having\r\n    made no statement either way. Those for an expedition were\r\n    Hartington, Northbrook, the Chancellor (Lord Selborne), Derby,\r\n    Chamberlain, and myself; and those against it, Mr. Gladstone, Lord\r\n    Granville, Harcourt, Kimberley, and Dodson. On April 21st, Egypt was\r\n    discussed without decision, though with the note by me: \"The\r\n    majority now begin to see that an October expedition is certain.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the 23rd a Cabinet ... considered the possibility of reaching\r\n    Berber.... After the Cabinet of April 23rd, I advocated a naval\r\n    expedition by the Nile on the ground that the Admiralty were likely\r\n    to do the thing better than the War Office. [Footnote: A review by\r\n    Sir Charles in the _Athenæum_ of October 24th, 1908, deals with the\r\n    _Life of Lord Northbrook_, by Sir Bernard Mallet, and his allusions\r\n    to Lord Northbrook's consideration, as early as April, of a 'rescue\r\n    and retire' expedition by the Nile route for the autumn, 'it being\r\n    assumed that the boats then ordered could not pass the various\r\n    cataracts before High Nile.' See _Life of Lord Northbrook_, pp.\r\n    185-186. A review by Sir Charles of March 28th, 1908, in the same\r\n    paper, of _Modern Egypt_, by the Earl of Cromer, also deals with\r\n    Lord Northbrook's pressure for a Nile Expedition in March, 1884.] On\r\n    April 28th, Berber, Khartoum, and Gordon, on which there was nothing\r\n    new, but Hartington insisted on a large and important military\r\n    expedition.'\r\n\r\n    'On April 29th Baring had now come over about Egypt, and attended a\r\n    Cabinet to state his views. I saw him privately, and settled with\r\n    him the details for a possible Nile expedition \"small and early.\"\r\n    The difficulty was at the sixth cataract. He also broached to me his\r\n    scheme for a new control by the four Powers already represented on\r\n    the Caisse de la Dette--namely, England, France, Austria, and Italy,\r\n    with an English president.'\r\n\r\n    'At the next Cabinet there was a proposal by Hartington that there\r\n    should be a vote of thanks to Sir Gerald Graham and Admiral Hewett\r\n    for the Suakim expedition--a proposal which the Cabinet rejected,\r\n    having had quite enough of votes of thanks on the former occasion\r\n    when Wolseley and Beauchamp Seymour were in question. The next\r\n    matter was what we should say about our Law of Liquidation\r\n    Conference, on which there arose an awkward question as to what\r\n    should happen in the probable case of the representatives of the\r\n    Powers not being unanimous. There was every reason to suppose that\r\n    the French would not agree to anything, and precedents went to show\r\n    that unanimity was necessary to render valid the decisions of a\r\n    conference. Indeed, there was no precedent as regards questions of\r\n    principle which told the other way; and at the Congress of Berlin\r\n    Prince Bismarck had stated, as recorded in the first protocol, that\r\n    as regarded substantive proposals it was an incontestable principle\r\n    that the minority should not be bound to acquiesce in a vote of a\r\n    majority.\r\n\r\n    'Then came the consideration of the action to be taken by the\r\n    Egyptian Government towards Mr. O'Kelly, M.P., [Footnote: Mr. James\r\n    O'Kelly, then M.P. for Koscommon, a very adventurous war\r\n    correspondent. He died in 1916.] Parnell's friend, who had been\r\n    trying to join the Mahdi. We next considered Lord Salisbury's\r\n    relations towards Tewfik as Khedive, as affected by the violent\r\n    attacks of many Conservative members, put up by Broadley, upon\r\n    Tewfik's character. Randolph Churchill had made a most ferocious\r\n    series of attacks upon the Khedive, without one atom of truth in\r\n    them. It is a curious example of his forgetful flightiness, that\r\n    when, a few years later, he went to Egypt, he was struck with wonder\r\n    at the Khedive's refusal to receive him. The terms of the French\r\n    acceptance of our invitation to the Conference were discussed, as\r\n    were the House of Commons questions as to Gordon, and the offer of\r\n    Mr. Guy Dawnay, M.P., to go as a messenger to Gordon at his own\r\n    cost. Then followed the internal condition of Egypt, as to which\r\n    Baring's views were stated by me; then Harrar; then the employment\r\n    of negroes or Turks for the Egyptian army; then the Turks at Suakim;\r\n    then the Somali coast.\r\n\r\n    'On the same day I had an interview with the ex-Khedive Ismail, who\r\n    had gone downhill. He always had a certain difficulty in collecting\r\n    his ideas and putting them into words, but on this occasion it went\r\n    farther than I had previously known. He wished to impress on me the\r\n    necessity for defending Egypt against the Mahdi at some given point\r\n    upon the Nile, when occurred that incident of his continually\r\n    working up to the name of the place and forgetting it. [Footnote:\r\n    See Chapter XXX., Vol. I., p. 487.]\r\n\r\n    'On May 5th there was a Cabinet. We considered the vote of censure\r\n    as to Gordon, and decided that time must be given for it; and I then\r\n    had some correspondence with Northbrook across the table as to an\r\n    expedition. I said: \"Northbrook, I should be glad to know all you\r\n    know against the Nile route. Ismail, who knows all about it, thinks\r\n    it quite possible.\" Northbrook replied: \"My objections are\r\n    uncertainty of getting steamers up at all (we know nothing of the\r\n    140 miles beyond Wady Halfa), and necessity of assistance from\r\n    natives, which may not be given. Key\" (Sir Cooper Key) \"is in rather\r\n    a delicate position, as he does not like to go against Wolseley,\r\n    whose opinion is for the Nile, and the responsibility is with the\r\n    W.O.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 7th there was another Cabinet. It was decided that Nubar\r\n    need not be brought to London for the Conference, that a fresh place\r\n    in some other unhappy portion of the world must be found for\r\n    Clifford Lloyd; [Footnote: A Resident Magistrate who had come\r\n    violently into collision with the Nationalists in Ireland, and who\r\n    had also proved himself a storm centre in Egypt, as he afterwards\r\n    did in Mauritius.] and one was found, and he again fought with the\r\n    local authorities as he had fought in Ireland and in Egypt. With\r\n    regard to the attitude of France, it was decided that we could not,\r\n    so long as we remained in Egypt, put up with a new international\r\n    control. It was decided to bring the Turks to Suakim, although this\r\n    decision was afterwards reversed. We then wasted much of our time on\r\n    the consideration of what should be our attitude on the vote of\r\n    censure which was pending in the House. Harcourt had drawn an\r\n    amendment for Mr. Gladstone on which they had agreed. Chamberlain\r\n    and I had agreed to support a mere negative, and we talked the\r\n    others over....\r\n\r\n    'On May 11th Fitzmaurice wrote to me complaining that no definite\r\n    instructions had been given him with regard to the conduct of the\r\n    Gordon debate' (on the vote of censure), [Footnote: See _Hansard_,\r\n    vol. cclxxxviii., 3rd series, debate of May 13th, 1884] 'as was\r\n    usual in such important cases, but stating that he expected me to\r\n    speak. On the next day, May 12th, I learnt that Hartington had\r\n    refused to speak, although he was finally made to do so by Mr.\r\n    Gladstone. On Tuesday, May 13th, I made a good speech from 12.10 to\r\n    1.10 a.m.--too late for the reporters. \"The debate has (I noted in\r\n    my diary) been the best I ever heard. Mr. Gladstone was not so good\r\n    as usual, while Hartington and I were neither better nor worse than\r\n    usual. But Churchill, Forster, Cowen, John Morley, and Beach, all\r\n    spoke far above their usual level; and the rest were good. A\r\n    memorable debate, which I do not expect to see excelled for interest\r\n    and fire, and I am glad to have had the honour to wind it up for the\r\n    Liberal party.\" Afterwards I noted that it \"does not read well.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 14th Cabinet again decided that Nubar must not come over for\r\n    the Conference; discussed internal affairs of Egypt, then the\r\n    Conference again; and then called in Sir Evelyn Baring and discussed\r\n    with him the same matters of Clifford Lloyd, Nubar, Conference, the\r\n    Turks and the Red Sea ports, what was to be said to Waddington about\r\n    the Conference, and the detail of a scheme of Childers upon Egyptian\r\n    finance, which was extraordinarily unpopular with the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'On May 17th at noon there was a full Cabinet (Spencer being\r\n    present), and a long one. The first matter discussed was the Queen\r\n    and Conference, [Footnote: Proposed Conference of the Powers on the\r\n    Law of Liquidation.] and a strong objection on the part of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to tell Parliament anything about the Conference.\r\n    Chamberlain wrote to me on this: \"What a queer twist this objection\r\n    of Mr. G. is!\" To which I replied: \"I really wish he would have gone\r\n    to Coombe for this lovely day and let us go on without him. He has\r\n    wasted an hour and a half. Mr. G. will fight a whole day in Cabinet\r\n    to avoid telling Parliament something, and then after all will tell\r\n    them twice as much in reply to Ashmead Bartlett.\" On this\r\n    Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies Mr. G., who has left us repining,\r\n    While he is, no doubt, still engaged in refining;\r\n    And explaining distinctions to Peter and Paul,\r\n    Who faintly protest that distinctions so small\r\n    Were never submitted to saints to perplex them,\r\n    Until the Prime Minister came up to vex them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: These were notes passed during the sitting of the Cabinet. On\r\nMr. Gladstone's inconvenient habit of giving information at question\r\ntime, see Vol. I., pp. 307, 384, 459, 535; and _infra_, p. 118.]\r\n\r\n    'The Cabinet decided to send a telegram to Gordon through Zebehr, in\r\n    order to obtain safe conveyance for it, offering free use of money\r\n    among the tribes.\r\n\r\n    'To Grant Duff I wrote on May 17th: \"The Queen is much against our\r\n    arrangements with France. If we 'let them out' we spoil them, and if\r\n    we don't we shall be condemned for a 'secret negotiation with France\r\n    by a moribund Cabinet.' Yet, though we look very wrong, we _are_\r\n    right.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On the 19th it was decided that the Nile was to be patrolled by the\r\n    Navy as far as Wady Halfa.'\r\n\r\nThis was in the direction of the military policy which Sir Charles\r\nfavoured, but in which he was not to succeed. His diplomatic proposals\r\nnow have to be considered.\r\n\r\n    'At this time I sent a box round the Cabinet as to the\r\n    neutralization of Egypt, Northbrook assenting. In a minute dated May\r\n    22nd, Lord Northbrook wrote: \"I am disposed to think it would be\r\n    wise to propose at once an international guarantee of the neutrality\r\n    of Egypt, (1) It would give a substance and solidity to the French\r\n    assurances.\" (To Grant Duff I wrote on the 22nd: \"We have got from\r\n    France an engagement not to go to Egypt when we come away, and never\r\n    at any future time, except by the authority of Europe.\") \"(2)\r\n    Without it I hardly see a chance of escaping from annexation.... All\r\n    the circumstances of Egypt ... point to this solution, and ... the\r\n    release of Egypt from the Soudan makes the solution possible.\"\r\n    Chamberlain wrote: \"I agree entirely with Dilke and Northbrook. (1)\r\n    As to the intrinsic importance of such a proposal. If adopted it\r\n    secures every essential British interest, and promises relief from\r\n    the intolerable burden of a continued occupation. I am strongly in\r\n    favour of making the proposal at once. It will give a real guarantee\r\n    to the Powers of our good faith and intention to clear out of the\r\n    country. (2) I attach great importance to it as forming a definite\r\n    policy.... To make Egypt the 'Belgium of the East' is an object\r\n    easily popularized. The phrase will carry the proposal.\" Kimberley\r\n    wrote: \"I agree with Northbrook and Dilke. The neutralization of\r\n    Egypt will be a gain in itself, irrespective altogether of the\r\n    question of its internal administration. It would also ... render it\r\n    easy to establish a firm domestic Government in so far as it would\r\n    put an end to the rivalries ... which exercise a very disturbing\r\n    influence on all Egyptian affairs.--K.\" This minute received the\r\n    support of the signatures of the Chancellor, Harcourt, and Childers.\r\n    Lord Derby wrote: \"I agree so entirely with the views of Lord\r\n    Northbrook and Sir Charles Dilke that I need add nothing to what\r\n    they have written. There is only one alternative in the long-run;\r\n    guaranteed neutrality or annexation.--D., May 23.\" Carlingford also\r\n    agreed, but Hartington strongly dissented; and although Lord\r\n    Granville agreed with us, Hartington's dissent was so fierce that he\r\n    succeeded in preventing Mr. Gladstone from expressing an opinion,\r\n    and the view taken by ten members of the Cabinet remained without\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n    '... On May 24th, the next matter discussed was the neutralization\r\n    of Egypt, which Mr. Gladstone decided, in face of Hartington's\r\n    minute, was \"not to be immediately proposed.\"' [Footnote: The offer\r\n    of neutralization was, however, made. See _infra_, Chapter XXXVIII.,\r\n    pp. 94, 97.]\r\n\r\n    'We then returned to our old business of Waddington and the\r\n    Conference. Mr. Gladstone next complained that he had been\r\n    catechized in the House of Commons on Monday, May 19th, as to\r\n    whether he \"told most lies on Monday or on Thursday.\" We then\r\n    discussed the desirability of making a statement in the House as to\r\n    the number of years that our troops would remain in Egypt;\r\n    Northbrook and Hartington suggesting either five years or three\r\n    years from January, 1885, and Carlingford suggesting one year, in\r\n    which he was supported by the Prime Minister and myself; but three\r\n    years prevailed. Next came Morocco; and then a Gordon\r\n    expedition--Mr. Gladstone speaking strongly against it.\r\n\r\n    'On May 27th there was a Cabinet before the Whitsuntide recess. It\r\n    was decided what statement was to be made to Parliament about the\r\n    Conference. Lord Granville had told Waddington that we should not\r\n    stay more than five years in Egypt at the outside, and Hartington,\r\n    who himself had been willing to limit our stay to three years, now\r\n    fought violently against a limitation even to five. Chamberlain\r\n    wrote to me: \"As usual--the question having been twice settled,\r\n    Hartington, in a minority of one, raises the whole question again.\r\n    It is direct, unmitigated, and unconcealed obstruction.\" We then\r\n    discussed the expedition to Khartoum and the making of a Suakim-\r\n    Berber railway, but it was decided that orders were not yet to be\r\n    given. On the next day Mr. Gladstone, who had gone to Hawarden,\r\n    wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Northbrook,\r\n\r\n    '\"I have received and read this morning Sir Cooper Key's very\r\n    interesting paper on an expedition to Khartoum. I write, however, to\r\n    suggest that it would be a great advantage if two suggestions it\r\n    contains were to be fully examined and developed. (1) The _small_\r\n    river expedition which he thinks practicable. (2) The small desert\r\n    expedition from Korosko to which he also adverts as an auxiliary\r\n    method.... Clear as is the case for the railway from Suakim, as\r\n    against the large expedition by the Nile, in every other view it is\r\n    attended with the most formidable difficulties of a moral and\r\n    political kind ... whether the 'turning of the first sod' of a\r\n    Soudan railway will not be the substitution for an Egyptian\r\n    domination there, of an English domination ... more unnatural, more\r\n    costly, more destructive, and altogether without foundation in\r\n    public right. It would be an immense advantage that the expedition\r\n    (should one be needed) should be one occupying little time, and\r\n    _leaving no trace behind it_.\r\n\r\n             '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n                   '\"W. E. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\n    'Of this letter a copy was made by Edward Hamilton, and enclosed to\r\n    me with an autograph letter from Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'On May 31st I had received a further letter from Mr. Gladstone\r\n    about the Soudan expedition, in which he said: \"Suakim and Berber\r\n    route has utterly beaten Nile route for a large expedition.... But\r\n    the question of a small expedition has hardly yet been touched,\r\n    while some believe Gordon is or will be free, and there need be no\r\n    expedition at all.\" I sent this letter to Lord Northbrook, and to\r\n    Lord Hartington, pointing out that Colonel Sartorius had written a\r\n    letter to the papers in favour of an expedition of a thousand picked\r\n    men armed with repeating rifles; and after receiving replies, I\r\n    wrote to Mr. Gladstone on June 4th that I had not had much\r\n    encouragement from Hartington and Northbrook, the fact being that\r\n    Hartington was determined on giving Wolseley his big job. [Footnote:\r\n    See _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p. 395.]\r\n\r\n    'On June 6th Lord Granville called a meeting to ask us whether,\r\n    Waddington having now agreed to all our demands, we could devise\r\n    some plan of getting out of them. He said that for his own part he\r\n    should not have asked the question, but that Hartington had\r\n    suggested it.... He said: \"I must rather complain of Hartington's\r\n    conduct--from so intimate a friend. If it had been Dodson I should\r\n    have been very angry.\" After such an introduction, the meeting could\r\n    hardly come to a conclusion favourable to Hartington's views.\r\n\r\n    'On June 9th Sir Henry Ponsonby came to see me before the Cabinet,\r\n    wishing to talk to me before he spoke to any other member, as the\r\n    Queen thought that I was the most in agreement with her views, which\r\n    was not the case, as regarded evacuation. He discussed with me two\r\n    points: First the term of years, as to which I explained that, under\r\n    the agreement, if at the end of three and a half years any one Power\r\n    thought we had better stay, and we ourselves wished to stay, then we\r\n    could stay. It was not my wish that we should. Secondly, as to the\r\n    union of Bulgaria and East Roumelia, about which I did not care, and\r\n    as to which I suggested that the Queen should propose to Lord\r\n    Granville to take counsel with Austria. [Footnote: The union took\r\n    place in 1885.] At the Cabinet which followed we discussed the words\r\n    of our promise to lay our French agreements before Parliament, and\r\n    also our answer as to the Turks and Suakim. The French having\r\n    written us a disagreeable despatch, we agreed that they must be made\r\n    to take it back.\r\n\r\n    'On the next day, June 10th, there was a Cabinet to begin the\r\n    railway from Suakim. and to consider the draft despatch to\r\n    Waddington, and as the Government at this time was not very strong,\r\n    it was decided to leave for our successors a Cabinet minute upon the\r\n    subject of our relations at this time with France. After the Cabinet\r\n    I had to see Mr. Gladstone from Lord Granville upon the question\r\n    whether we should insist on a casting vote on the Caisse. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, against the unanimous opinion of the Cabinet, replied:\r\n    \"No, not to the point of breaking off.\"'\r\n\r\nOn June 12th Sir Charles made two notes in his Diary of that date:\r\n\r\n    'I think that if Mr. Gladstone was to stay in, and live on, we\r\n    should come as regards Egypt to evacuation and neutralization. Under\r\n    the Tories, or under Hartington, the _status quo_ may be tried for a\r\n    long time.'\r\n\r\n    'When Bismarck offered Egypt to Dizzy, it was in order to embroil\r\n    England with France.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFrom this point onwards in the Memoir the focus of the Egyptian question\r\nchanges; attention is centred on the diplomatic questions arising out of\r\nthe financial problem.\r\n\r\nAs between England and France the issue concerned itself with the\r\nproposal to pay less than the promised interest on previously existing\r\nloans. The French view, expressed through M. Barrère, the French agent\r\nin Egypt, was that interest need not be reduced; the alternative view\r\nwas that the bondholders must make a sacrifice of part of their\r\ninterest, at any rate for some period of years, in return for the better\r\nsecurity they were obtaining.\r\n\r\n    'On July 3rd Barrère called and explained to me a scheme of his on\r\n    Egyptian finance, in which he was now highly skilled, having been\r\n    French Agent in Egypt for some time. I put the matter before Lord\r\n    Granville, who sent it to Mr. Gladstone and Childers. Barrère argued\r\n    that it was not necessary to reduce interest, or, to use the slang\r\n    of the moment, to \"cut the coupon.\" We called a meeting of the\r\n    Commons Ministers, and Chamberlain announced that he should resign\r\n    if the coupon were not cut.\r\n\r\n    'July 18th, 1884.--We had virtually decided on declaring Egypt\r\n    bankrupt in order to force the hands of the French, but Waddington,\r\n    at a meeting with Childers, had broached a plan, which had\r\n    originally been suggested by the Germans, for a temporary reduction\r\n    of interest, to be reconsidered at the end of a certain number of\r\n    years.' (These proposals were discussed at the Conference, which met\r\n    in the latter half of July, held seven sittings, and then broke down\r\n    without arriving at a conclusion on August 1st.) 'The question now\r\n    raised was--at the end of what number of years? The French said\r\n    three, and we decided to propose ten; but with a willingness to take\r\n    six or even five; we advancing 4 1/2 millions instead of 8, or, in\r\n    other words, leaving out the indemnities due by Egypt. If this\r\n    arrangement failed, then we were to fall back on bankruptcy.\r\n    Harcourt was much against declaring bankruptcy, and in favour of the\r\n    policy of \"scuttle.\" Hartington was against bankruptcy, and for\r\n    paying the differences ourselves; so as to force us into annexation.\r\n    Spencer, Childers, Chamberlain, and I, were for bankruptcy or for a\r\n    strong threat of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n    'On July 21st there was a meeting of members of the Cabinet after\r\n    questions, at which Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville, Hartington,\r\n    Harcourt, Childers, and I, were present. The French had backed out\r\n    of their proposals, and we considered a new scheme of Childers's to\r\n    put all administrative charges in Egypt before interest of debt, a\r\n    scheme which it was certain that the French would refuse. Harcourt\r\n    was again violent against bankruptcy, which he announced he thought\r\n    grossly \"illegal,\" as if there were such a thing as illegality in\r\n    such affairs.\r\n\r\n    'On August 2nd there was a full Cabinet, every member being present,\r\n    and we had to consider whether, the Conference having broken down,\r\n    Baring should go back to Egypt or remain at the Foreign Office and\r\n    continue to advise us. Lord Granville proposed that he should\r\n    remain, and that Malet should go to Egypt. Chamberlain proposed that\r\n    Goschen should go. Childers proposed J. K. Cross. [Footnote:\r\n    Under-Secretary for India.] Dufferin was mentioned; then Lord\r\n    Granville proposed Northbrook. All other names were immediately\r\n    withdrawn, and Northbrook took time to consider, but evidently meant\r\n    to go, and decided, I think, in the course of the same evening.\r\n    Baring was then called in, and we once more began to chop straw by\r\n    considering the \"ulterior consequences\" of the collapse of the\r\n    Conference--i.e., bankruptcy. Lastly, Gordon was dealt with, and\r\n    it was decided that a supplementary estimate should be proposed,\r\n    with the understanding that we should spend more if it was wanted. I\r\n    wrote to Chamberlain: \"We always have two subjects--(a) Conference,\r\n    (b) Gordon.\" And he wrote back: \"The first always taking up two or\r\n    three hours; and the second five minutes at the fag end of\r\n    business.\"\r\n\r\n    'On August 3rd I noted \"we are going to send Northbrook to Egypt to\r\n    put down Barrère.\"\r\n\r\n    'On August 5th we considered the instructions to Northbrook, or\r\n    rather whether he should have any at all, and if so, what they\r\n    should be. Northbrook read us a scheme which he had written, which\r\n    attempted to conciliate Turkey and Italy, so as to have great naval\r\n    strength in the Mediterranean and to prevent all chance of a sudden\r\n    occupation of Egypt by France. We were to express our continued\r\n    determination not to annex. We were to stay five years at the\r\n    request of the Sultan. We were again to propose to the Powers those\r\n    arrangements with regard to the Canal which we had proposed already.\r\n    We were to pay the indemnities in stock; and the next coupon in\r\n    full; and we were to promise for the future not less than 4 per\r\n    cent, on privileged stocks, and not less than 3 per cent, on the\r\n    Unified debt, while we were in Egypt. Indian troops were to hold\r\n    Massowah. Harcourt, in reply, read a written counter-statement,\r\n    again proposing to \"scuttle,\" and again threatening us that we\r\n    should have war with France. Hartington again spoke for a guarantee\r\n    by us of the whole Egyptian debt. After Hartington's observations\r\n    the discussion was, as usual, adjourned. Chamberlain and I decided\r\n    that we would ask for our old term of three and a half years'\r\n    occupation, as against Northbrook's five. Next came Gordon, and\r\n    Hartington proposed that we should embody some militia.\r\n\r\n    'On August 6th there was another Cabinet, and the first question was\r\n    that of Northbrook's scheme. Lord Granville agreed to a temporary\r\n    use of Turkish troops provided that they were to leave Egypt when we\r\n    left. Chamberlain would not agree, and wished to stick to\r\n    Northbrook's phrase only inviting \"co-operation.\" This view\r\n    prevailed, and it was decided that if the Turks proposed to send a\r\n    commissioner, we were to refuse. But the question of troops was\r\n    really left open for more discussion. Next came the question of an\r\n    advance of nearly a million which had been made by Rothschild to\r\n    Egypt, and we asked him, as a favour to ourselves, to let it run,\r\n    which was all he wanted us to do. Northbrook, who is not strong, had\r\n    been a good deal fatigued with the discussion on his scheme, and\r\n    instead of sleeping (his usual practice at a Cabinet) on this\r\n    occasion fainted, and we had to get up and look after him at this\r\n    point.\r\n\r\n    'On August 26th I received a letter from Hartington, saying that\r\n    Northbrook was going to Osborne at the end of the week, and starting\r\n    for Egypt from there. Hartington told me he was coming up to meet\r\n    him, and he afterwards wrote to me to fix an appointment at the War\r\n    Office on the 29th. This I kept. Northbrook was deplorably weak. He\r\n    had returned from Rosebery's completely under the influence of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's pro-French views. [Footnote: At Dalmeny Lord Northbrook\r\n    \"met Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone.\" See Life of Lord Northbrook, p. 190.]\r\n    He had settled to spend a day at Walmer, and had telegraphed to Lord\r\n    Lyons to meet him there. His plan now was to ask the French\r\n    Government to send a man to Egypt in order that he and the Frenchman\r\n    might settle matters together. Hartington and I pointed out to him\r\n    that the Frenchman's instructions from his Government must either be\r\n    to refuse all reduction of interest, or to consent to it upon\r\n    obtaining from us a better political position than that given to\r\n    France by the Anglo-French agreement. We explained to him that it\r\n    would be impossible for us to tolerate such proposals. I wrote to\r\n    Chamberlain a full account of the interview.\r\n\r\n    'September 22nd_.--We decided with reference to Egyptian finance\r\n    that Chamberlain should write a strong letter to Lord Granville\r\n    protesting against any British advance to Egypt, unless accompanied\r\n    by a cutting of the coupon. He did so, and on September 25th sent me\r\n    a copy, and I sent the copy to Childers, and wrote myself to Lord\r\n    Granville. On the 27th I received a memorandum from Chamberlain as\r\n    to Lord Granville, Lord Derby, and Bismarck.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain's memorandum was a fierce denunciation of the\r\n    principles laid down in Northbrook's despatch No. 4, dated September\r\n    13th, and received September 22nd.' [Footnote: Lord Northbrook had\r\n    arrived in Egypt.]\r\n\r\nControversy now raged over Lord Northbrook's scheme, and added to the\r\ndifficulties of the Cabinet, which was divided on the question of\r\nlowering or not lowering the rate of interest.\r\n\r\n    'On 19th November the second matter mentioned was Northbrook's\r\n    scheme, against which I fought hard.... I pointed out that early in\r\n    April, when Mr. Gladstone had wished to borrow on the future value\r\n    of the Canal shares, that proposal had not been accepted, and we\r\n    laid down the principle that it was for the bondholders to make\r\n    sacrifices. On July 3rd we had decided that the coupon must be\r\n    \"cut.\" On July 18th the whole Cabinet had taken the same view except\r\n    Harcourt and the Chancellor, and four members--Childers, Spencer,\r\n    Chamberlain, and I--had advocated distinct bankruptcy. On August 2nd\r\n    we had seen Baring to lay our plans for bankruptcy. On August 5th\r\n    Northbrook himself had proposed a reduction of the interest. On\r\n    August 29th there had been a general agreement to the same effect.\r\n    Northbrook's policy had enormously sent up Egyptian stocks. After my\r\n    strong observations the opinions stood: Mr. Gladstone, Childers,\r\n    Chamberlain, Harcourt, Trevelyan, and Dilke against Northbrook's\r\n    scheme; for it, Lord Granville, the Chancellor, Hartington, Spencer,\r\n    Kimberley, Derby, Carlingford, and Northbrook himself. All the Lords\r\n    on one side, curiously enough, and all the Sirs and Mr.'s on the\r\n    other; eight to six against us. But I noted: \"Mr. Gladstone is so\r\n    strong that we shall win.\" \"As we did.\"' [Footnote: Letter from Sir\r\n    Charles to Mr. Brett (afterwards Lord Esher):\r\n\r\n    Local Government Board,\r\n    Whitehall,\r\n    _November_ 19_th_, 1884.\r\n\r\n    '_My_ policy has always been bankruptcy and stand the shot, and if\r\n    we had stuck to that we should have had no trouble with the Powers;\r\n    but indiscretions have made that difficult. It is not pleasant to be\r\n    called in too late. I quite agree in your general view, but how can\r\n    the bondholder be got to make sacrifices without his consent?']\r\n\r\n    'At the meeting of the Cabinet of December 2nd, Egyptian finance\r\n    again came up. We were informed that Prince Bismarck suggested oral\r\n    communications among ambassadors. For this Malet proposed Paris, and\r\n    we replied Berlin.'\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Government continued to waver as to the Soudan\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st\r\n\r\n    'with regard to Gordon it was decided to wait ten days before\r\n    settling anything, and to see whether we heard from him in reply to\r\n    the silly questions which had been asked.'\r\n\r\nOn June 27th came the definitive news that Berber had fallen on May\r\n26th. On July 5th\r\n\r\n    'We discussed the Egyptian army of the future, and then the question\r\n    of whether we should send an expedition to Khartoum, as to which we\r\n    again could come to no decision; Mr. Gladstone still opposing.'\r\n\r\nDilke, backed by Chamberlain, was still pressing the military solution\r\nwhich he favoured. On July 16th\r\n\r\n    'Hartington on this occasion gave up the Berber-Suakim route, and\r\n    pressed for a decision as to an immediate expedition by the Nile. He\r\n    was supported by the Chancellor, Northbrook, Carlingford, and\r\n    Dodson. Mr. Gladstone, Harcourt, and Childers opposed.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain and I opposed a large expedition by the Nile, and\r\n    supported a small expedition, under the control of the navy, with a\r\n    body of picked men. Baring was called in about the police in Egypt,\r\n    and his views in support of Nubar were approved. Nubar was to have\r\n    his own way in the appointment of Inspectors of Police in Egypt.'\r\n\r\n    'On July 22nd we found that Mr. Gladstone had again taken up Zebehr,\r\n    and was anxious to send him to Khartoum in order to avoid a British\r\n    expedition.\r\n\r\n    'On July 25th there was a full Cabinet, Spencer being present, which\r\n    first discussed the Conference and then the Gordon expedition, for\r\n    which for the first time a large majority of the Cabinet pronounced.\r\n    The issue was narrowed down to that of sending some sort of British\r\n    force to or towards Dongola; and this was supported by Hartington,\r\n    the Chancellor, Derby, Northbrook, Spencer, Carlingford, Dodson,\r\n    Chamberlain, and me, while on the other side were only Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, Harcourt, and Kimberley. Lord Granville said nothing. By\r\n    the stoutness of their resistance the three for the moment prevailed\r\n    over the nine.\r\n\r\n    'On July 31st a storm was brewing about Gordon, and Harcourt went\r\n    about declaring that the Government would break up upon the\r\n    question. On the next day, August 1st, a way out of the difficulty\r\n    was found in an agreement that we should ask for a small vote of\r\n    credit, which we were to use or not as should be thought right\r\n    later.'\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that communications with Gordon were now\r\ninterrupted, though occasionally renewed, and this added to the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n    'On September 17th we received a telegram from Gordon which looked\r\n    as though he were perfectly mad, although some of the other\r\n    telegrams from him sent at the same time were sane enough.'\r\n\r\nSince Parliament had risen and the Cabinet scattered, preparations had\r\nbeen going on apace.\r\n\r\n    'When Hartington came to me on September 15th he told me that he had\r\n    already spent \"£750,000 out of the £300,000\" for the Gordon\r\n    expedition.' [Footnote: 'On August 9th Lord Hartington again asked\r\n    us for permission to embody militia or call out a portion of the\r\n    First-Class Army Reserve.']\r\n\r\n    'On October 4th Chamberlain had written strongly against Wolseley's\r\n    great expedition, Harcourt was still opposing the whole thing. After\r\n    this meeting of the Cabinet Northbrook wrote to Gordon a long letter\r\n    based on the Cabinet decision. He stated that the expedition under\r\n    Wolseley was not sent for the purpose of defeating the Mahdi, but\r\n    only of enabling the Egyptian garrison of Khartoum, the civil\r\n    employees and their families, with Gordon, to return to Egypt. He\r\n    offered the Grand Cross of the Bath' (to Gordon) 'as from the Queen\r\n    personally. He explained our refusal of Zebehr, and he suggested the\r\n    placing at Khartoum of the Mudir of Dongola. It was easy, however,\r\n    to write to Gordon, but it was not easy to get the letters to him;\r\n    and we had to attempt even to send them by Tripoli and the desert.'\r\n    [Footnote: As to the last communications with Gordon, see _Life of\r\n    Granville_, vol. ii., pp. 397-399. Besides the authorities already\r\n    quoted, the Parliamentary Papers Nos. 2, 6, 12, 13, and 25, for\r\n    1884, may be referred to.]\r\n\r\nThat is the last detailed reference to Gordon in the Memoir until\r\nFebruary 5th, 1885, when the news of the fall of Khartoum reached\r\nLondon. The matter had passed out of the hands of the Cabinet into those\r\nof the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis comment in the Diary may fitly end this chapter:\r\n\r\n    'On February 20th I noted (conversation, I think, not printed), Lord\r\n    Acton says of Gladstone: \"Cannot make up my mind whether he is not\r\n    wholly unconscious when working himself up to a change of position.\r\n    After watching him do it, I think that he is so. He lives completely\r\n    in what for the moment he chooses to believe.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE AND REDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nJULY TO DECEMBER, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1884 the Government Bill for extension of the franchise\r\nhad strong and even passionate support throughout the country; but that\r\npolicy threatened a breach with Lord Hartington, who in the opinion of\r\nmany was by prescriptive right Mr. Gladstone's successor. Still more\r\nentangling were the difficulties in respect of Egypt, over which the\r\nGovernment was so hopelessly divided that no coherent policy could be\r\npursued. Sir Charles notes that on July 18th Mr. Gladstone,\r\n\r\n    'who had the greatest abhorrence for City dinners, proposed the\r\n    extinction of the Lord Mayor's ministerial banquet; the fact being\r\n    that the Government of London Bill and the failure to send an\r\n    expedition to Khartoum had made the Ministry so unpopular in the\r\n    City that he did not think it wise to subject himself to the torture\r\n    which such banquets are to him.'\r\n\r\n    'The Tory game,' Sir Charles wrote on May 24th, 1884, to his agent,\r\n    'is to delay the franchise until they have upset us upon Egypt,\r\n    before the Franchise Bill has reached the Lords.' [Footnote: This\r\n    letter is also quoted in Chapter XXXIV.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Franchise Bill went up to the Lords in the first week of July,\r\nit was rejected for a reasoned amendment which declined to alter the\r\nfranchise except as part of a scheme dealing with redistribution of\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n    'On July 5th there was a Cabinet to consider what was called the\r\n    crisis--our relations with the House of Lords over the franchise,\r\n    and Spencer was present.... The question to be considered was that\r\n    of dissolution or an autumn Session. Lord Granville, Hartington, and\r\n    Lord Derby were for an immediate dissolution on the old franchise,\r\n    which was at once negatived.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 21st there was mentioned the attitude of the House of\r\n    Lords. Lord Granville said something in favour of life peerages. I\r\n    asked Chamberlain whether he thought that it was seriously meant,\r\n    and writing passed between us in which he replied: \"Serious, I\r\n    think\"; to which I answered: \"You won't have it, will you?\" Answer:\r\n    \"No.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On July 7th Mr. Gladstone explained to me his plan for dealing with\r\n    the House of Lords, which was not so objectionable to me as the\r\n    schemes known as \"Reform of the House of Lords.\" It was to imitate\r\n    the French constitution, and in cases of difference to make the two\r\n    Houses sit in Congress and vote together. From the practical point\r\n    of view it would be as difficult to carry as the abolition of the\r\n    House of Lords, and if carried would not be of much use to the\r\n    Liberal party except on occasions when their majority was absolutely\r\n    overwhelming.\r\n\r\n    'On July 8th offers of compromise came to us from the Lords, but\r\n    they would not offer terms which we could accept. We decided to\r\n    propose to them a solemn resolution by both Houses pledging us to\r\n    redistribution. This they refused.'\r\n\r\nThe extent of real agreement which existed between the two sides had not\r\nyet been divined; and it was Sir Charles who set on foot the work which\r\nfinally averted conflict.\r\n\r\n    'Early in July I began to take time by the forelock by preparing,\r\n    without instructions from the Cabinet, a Redistribution scheme; and\r\n    the first memoranda drawn up by Sir John Lambert for my use were\r\n    written in that month, although it was not till after Parliament had\r\n    separated for the recess that we got seriously to work. In the\r\n    evening of July 14th Mr. Gladstone broached to me his views on\r\n    Redistribution, and we practically hatched the Bill.'\r\n\r\nParty feeling ran high, and the Queen intervened.\r\n\r\n    'On July 9th in the morning Sir Henry Ponsonby came up to see the\r\n    Duke of Richmond and some of us, and tried to settle the deadlock,\r\n    but failed.... The Cabinet decided that Chamberlain must not take\r\n    the chair at a meeting at the Agricultural Hall to denounce the\r\n    House of Lords.'\r\n\r\nLiberals in general were, however, speaking out, and at a Cabinet a week\r\nlater they had 'some fun with Hartington concerning his Lancashire\r\nmeetings, with strong resolutions directed against the House of Lords\r\nfor doing that which he privately approved.' Also, there was a\r\ntremendous demonstration in the Metropolis.\r\n\r\n    'On July 21st I saw the Franchise Demonstration on this day from the\r\n    Speaker's window, the procession passing from three till six.'\r\n\r\n    'After the Cabinet on August 5th we congratulated Chamberlain upon\r\n    his Birmingham franchise meeting, and he told us that Birmingham was\r\n    \"thirsting for the blood of the Lords\"--saying to Bright: \"You are\r\n    too lenient with them. We won't stand them any longer.\" I told him\r\n    that as the _Times_ had said that he was too violent, I had no doubt\r\n    the Queen would say so also, to which he replied: \"Probably, and if\r\n    she does I shall most likely ... deny her right to criticise my\r\n    speeches, although she may, if she likes, dismiss me, in which case\r\n    I will lead an agitation against the Lords in the country.\" I\r\n    answered: \"Yes, but you cannot go alone in such a case, and\r\n    therefore should not appear to contemplate doing so.\" He replied: \"I\r\n    am not going, but perhaps she can dismiss me. What then? I am not\r\n    going to tie my tongue.\" I retorted: \"In that case it would surely\r\n    be even more essential than usual that I should go too.\" He closed\r\n    the matter by saying: \"If it really arose out of the agitation\r\n    against the Lords and the interference of the Crown with the liberty\r\n    of speech of ministers, I do not see how a Radical could stay in.\r\n    Remember, I have observed Mr. Gladstone's limits. I have said\r\n    nothing about the future; only denounced past action.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain's outside agitation coincided with Sir Charles's work\r\ntowards a peaceful solution. On August 9th\r\n\r\n    'A Committee of the Cabinet was appointed to deal with\r\n    Redistribution--to consist of Hartington, Kimberley, Childers,\r\n    Chamberlain, and me, with the addition of Lefevre. They forgot\r\n    James, who was anxious to be on it, [Footnote: Sir Charles wrote to\r\n    Sir Henry James on the matter, and received a reply admitting that\r\n    he had been \"slightly touched\" by the omission of his name, but\r\n    saying that he would still give his services.] but I soon got rid of\r\n    the Committee and went on by myself with Lambert.'\r\n\r\nParliament was prorogued on August 14th, but very soon compromise was in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n    'On August 21st and 22nd I had interviews with Hartington at his\r\n    wish, nominally to talk over the sending of Wolseley to Egypt, but\r\n    really to see what I thought of a compromise with the Lords on the\r\n    basis of Lord Cowper's letter in the _Times_--introduction of the\r\n    Redistribution Bill in October.'\r\n\r\nThe situation was profoundly modified by speeches from Lord Salisbury,\r\nwhich made it clear that the plan \"hatched\" between Mr. Gladstone and\r\nSir Charles was not likely to have any terrors for him. Lord Kimberley\r\nwrote in September:\r\n\r\n    'Now that Salisbury is going in for electoral districts, it will\r\n    become a sort of open competition which party can go furthest. I\r\n    should not be surprised if he were to trump us by proposing to\r\n    abolish the House of Lords.'\r\n\r\n    'I had now decided to agree with Lord Salisbury in advance, and\r\n    divide the counties into single-member districts if Mr. Gladstone\r\n    would let me; and Trevelyan, to whom I had broached my scheme,\r\n    wrote: \"I very much approve of the scheme of dividing counties. I\r\n    hope to goodness you will be able to carry it out.\"'\r\n\r\nThe original draft, completed on September 18th, followed the lines laid\r\ndown in consultation with Mr. Gladstone. The object of obtaining fair\r\nrepresentation, and doing away with over-representation of vested\r\ninterests, was thus attacked and began with two great industrial\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for England treated Lancashire and Yorkshire as urban\r\nthroughout, and divided them into single-member districts; but the\r\nremaining 'rural' counties of England were divided into two-member\r\ndistricts. Thus, 'the net increase of county members was 53.' Boroughs\r\nwhich had less than 10,000 inhabitants (53 in all) were merged into the\r\ncounties; those with a population of between 10,000 and under 40,000,\r\nwhich had two members, lost one. Thus, having added to the under-\r\nrepresented, Sir Charles took from the over-represented, and adds: 'this\r\ngave us 33 more seats.' Sir Charles in a secret memorandum added that he\r\nthought the fixing of so low a limit as 10,000 showed 'an altogether\r\nindefensible tenderness to vested interests.' 'I should carry the loss\r\nof one member far higher than the 40,000 line adopted, and should take\r\naway one member up to the point at which I began to give two' to a new\r\nconstituency. Dilke was in favour of carrying merger of small boroughs\r\nto a greater extent than was adopted in the Act.\r\n\r\n    'Summing up, on our English borough scheme,' he said, 'I am struck\r\n    by its _extreme_ timidity. I do not see how it is to stand the\r\n    revolutionary criticism of Lord Salisbury.' 'My plan for the\r\n    Metropolis gave to it its legitimate proportion of members: 55 in\r\n    all.... These figures should be compared with 22--the previous\r\n    number.'\r\n\r\nAs to Ireland, he admitted that 'if you take its population as a whole\r\nit was over-represented in our plan; yet the difference in favour of\r\nIreland is very small; moreover, Wales is vastly better treated than\r\nIreland.' Lord Spencer 'thought there would be a howl from Belfast,' and\r\nwished for the representation of minorities. 'But the Irish Government\r\nmade no practical proposal,' and the whole of this intricate business\r\nwas left almost entirely to Sir Charles.\r\n\r\n    'On September 29th Mr. Gladstone wrote at length conveying his\r\n    general approval of my plan, and stating that he did not intend to\r\n    \"handle\" the Bill in the House of Commons; and so wished to defer to\r\n    the opinions of his colleagues. He gave me leave to add 12 members\r\n    to the House for Scotland, instead of taking the 12 from England;\r\n    and he congratulated me upon the \"wonderful progress\" which I had\r\n    made.... On the same day on which I had received Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    letter I saw one from Sir Henry Ponsonby to Mr. Gladstone with Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's reply. Sir Henry Ponsonby made proposals.... Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had refused both for the present; the former with scorn\r\n    and the latter with argument. [Footnote: The first was \"that the\r\n    Lords should read the Franchise Bill a second time, and then pass a\r\n    resolution declaring that they would go into Committee as soon as\r\n    the Redistribution Bill reached them.\"]\r\n\r\n    'On September 30th further letters were circulated, one from Sir\r\n    Henry Ponsonby on the 27th, in which he said that the reform of the\r\n    House of Lords must in any case come, but must come later, and that\r\n    he would see the leaders of the Opposition about the second\r\n    suggestion of his previous letter as it had not been absolutely\r\n    refused (the suggestion being that the Lords should provide in the\r\n    Franchise Bill that it should come into force on January 1st, 1886,\r\n    unless the Redistribution Bill were sooner passed).\r\n\r\n    'On October 4th Hartington made a speech which produced a storm upon\r\n    this subject of Compromise as to Reform.' (He proposed that the\r\n    Lords should pass the Franchise Bill 'after seeing the conditions of\r\n    the Redistribution Bill and satisfying themselves that they were\r\n    fair.') 'But Mr. Gladstone went with Chamberlain and myself against\r\n    any compromise.'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain put the point that no bargain could be considered unless\r\nthe Franchise Bill were first passed without conditions very plainly in\r\na speech on October 7th, and next day at the Cabinet\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone expressed his approval of Chamberlain's speech of the\r\n    previous night, and attacked Hartington for his earlier one. It\r\n    seemed to me that at this moment Lord Salisbury might have caught\r\n    Hartington by offering the compromise which Hartington had\r\n    suggested.... I refused to discuss Redistribution with the Cabinet,\r\n    telling Chamberlain that they would \"drive me wild with little\r\n    peddling points.\"'\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of Sir Charles's competence was general. It was not\r\nlimited to Parliament, and he met the expression of it when he appeared\r\non the platform in three great centres of the Lancashire industrial\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, October 14th, I spoke at Oldham, and on October 15th at\r\n    the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and on the 16th at Stockport. I had\r\n    a wonderful reception at all these meetings, but especially at the\r\n    Manchester meeting.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's personal record served the party well, for the Tory cry\r\nwas that the Liberals wished to preserve the inequalities of the\r\nexisting divisions. To this he answered by appealing to the projects\r\nwhich he had introduced year after year, and recalling their reception\r\nfrom the Tory Government:\r\n\r\n    'I have preached for redistribution in the desert, I have advocated\r\n    it unceasingly for years, I have been a bore upon it in Parliament\r\n    and out; even the franchise is no less important in my eyes as being\r\n    that which I have a dozen times called \"the necessary first step to\r\n    a complete redistribution\" than in and for itself. Redistribution\r\n    is, however, if possible, of even more tremendous difficulty than\r\n    importance. It offers a greater hold than any other subject to the\r\n    arts of blocking and delay.' [Footnote: October 14th, at Oldham.]\r\n\r\n    'On October 17th Spencer reported from Balmoral that the Queen was\r\n    much pleased with her \"Speech\"; but not so with other people's\r\n    speeches, being angry at the violence of the language used.'\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury had declared that if Birmingham was going to march on\r\nLondon, he hoped Mr. Chamberlain would head the procession and get his\r\nhead broken for his pains. Mr. Chamberlain retorted that he would gladly\r\nhead the procession if Lord Salisbury would promise to come and meet it,\r\nand then, if his own head were broken, 'it should be broken in very good\r\ncompany.' On October 21st\r\n\r\n    'I was sent for by Mr. Gladstone about Chamberlain's speech, and\r\n    wrote to Chamberlain to ask him if he could tone it down a\r\n    little.... On October 22nd at the Cabinet Chamberlain told me that\r\n    he was willing to adopt the words of my letter in explanation of his\r\n    speech.'\r\n\r\nHe agreed to write for publication a letter to one of his Quaker\r\nconstituents; but it was judged insufficient.\r\n\r\n    'On October 28th Mr. Gladstone wrote to me: \"I thought you and I\r\n    were perfectly agreed about the unfortunate expressions in\r\n    Chamberlain's speech ... and in the expectation that his letter ...\r\n    would fully meet the case. I own that in my opinion it did not come\r\n    up to the mark. All I had really wished was a note conceived in the\r\n    same spirit as that in which he withdrew the 'jackal' because it\r\n    gave offence. Can nothing more be done? You saw a recent letter of\r\n    mine in defence, written when I thought the objections taken not to\r\n    be just. I am precluded from writing any such letter with the facts\r\n    as they now stand, but I hope that you may be able to bring them to\r\n    the standard of our reasonable expectations.\" I sent this letter to\r\n    Chamberlain, as was intended, with a note from me to say that it was\r\n    clear that the Queen had written Mr. Gladstone a second letter about\r\n    the matter, and asked whether I should say that I thought\r\n    Chamberlain's letter met the case; and Chamberlain replied: \"Yes. I\r\n    cannot and _will not_ do more.\" This I communicated to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone. Randolph Churchill had taken the matter up. He accused\r\n    Chamberlain of having advocated violence, and was loudly\r\n    threatening, even to me, that there should be \"somebody killed at\r\n    Birmingham next time.\" Chamberlain told me that Randolph had tried\r\n    to get up a march against Highbury on the part of the Birmingham\r\n    Tory roughs; but they were still on speaking terms, and often\r\n    chatting together at the smoking-room at the House. On the same day,\r\n    the 28th, late in the evening Mr. Gladstone sent for me about the\r\n    Chamberlain matter, and said of the Queen: \"She not only attacks him\r\n    but me through him, and says I pay a great deal too much attention\r\n    to him.\" When Chamberlain and I went home, as we almost always did,\r\n    together in one cab, he broke out, evidently much worried and\r\n    excited, against Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'Next day I warned Mr. Gladstone that it would not take much to make\r\n    a serious row.'\r\n\r\nOn October 15th Sir Charles wrote to Sir M. Grant Duff that he expected\r\n'they would sit till February, and send the Bill up a third time.' On\r\nOctober 24th Mr. Gladstone was inclined to resign at the second\r\nrejection, which was taken for a certainty. But as to the final issue,\r\nit was becoming daily clearer that the Commons were going to win against\r\nthe Lords. Even in the home counties Liberalism had become aggressive.\r\n\r\n    'October 24th.--Franchise and Redistribution seemed well in view\r\n    when I discovered on this day that Nathaniel Rothschild, who had\r\n    lately looked on Buckinghamshire as his own, was now down on his\r\n    knees to Carrington about it.' Work now began on the details of the\r\n    draft Bill.\r\n\r\n    'On October 25th there was a full meeting of my Committee of the\r\n    Cabinet on Redistribution. I took the chair, and Hartington,\r\n    Kimberley, Childers, Chamberlain, James, and Lefevre, sat round the\r\n    table. I got my own way in everything, and succeeded in raising the\r\n    10,000 limit of merger to 15,000. Mr. Gladstone, who disliked the\r\n    change, and who was the strongest Conservative living upon the\r\n    subject, yielded to it on the same night by letter.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles now threw himself into getting as big a measure as possible\r\nby a 'truce of God' between the parties.\r\n\r\n    'On October 29th Mr. Gladstone told me that Lord Carnarvon had\r\n    proposed to him that they should meet in order to come to some\r\n    conclusion about Redistribution. He had declined, but had tried,\r\n    through Sir Erskine May, to induce the Tories to appoint a Committee\r\n    of their own to draw up a scheme. I saw Sir Erskine May and told him\r\n    to tell Northcote that I would accept, and press the acceptance of,\r\n    any scheme not obviously unfair, and not containing minority\r\n    representation, which I should be unable to carry.'\r\n\r\n    'On October 31st there was a Cabinet which was Trevelyan's first,\r\n    and very glad he and his wife were to escape from Ireland,\r\n    [Footnote: The Chief Secretaryship was offered to Mr. Shaw Lefevre,\r\n    who refused on the same ground as had previously been taken by Sir\r\n    Charles. Without Cabinet rank he was not prepared to accept it. Sir\r\n    Henry Campbell-Bannerman was then appointed. Mr. Lefevre entered the\r\n    Cabinet as Postmaster-General after the death of Mr. Fawcett, which\r\n    occurred on November 6th, 1884.] which had aged him dreadfully....\r\n    On the question of Reform Hartington told us that he had had several\r\n    interviews with Sir Michael Beach, who had expressly stated that he\r\n    was not authorized by his party to make suggestions, but had\r\n    proposed total merger up to 25,000, and loss of the second seat up\r\n    to 80,000. I, to clinch the matter, at once volunteered to draw up a\r\n    scheme on this basis.'\r\n\r\n    'James called my attention to some communications in the\r\n    Conservative newspapers, stating that he had it on very high\r\n    authority (which with James always meant Randolph Churchill) that\r\n    the extremely large schemes hinted at were Lord Salisbury's, and\r\n    would be supported by the whole Conservative party; but these\r\n    schemes suggested minority-representation in urban districts, with\r\n    single-member constituencies in counties; or, as Chamberlain said,\r\n    \"Tory minority represented in towns, and Liberal minority\r\n    extinguished in county.\" Lord Salisbury, however, was only keeping\r\n    his friends in good humour with minority-representation. In the\r\n    evening Randolph Churchill sent me a message that he wished to have\r\n    a conference with me about Redistribution, and by an arrangement\r\n    made through Sir Erskine May, we met in the Office of the Serjeant-\r\n    at-Arms. He then told me that Beach's scheme was his, and that he\r\n    was convinced that an agreement might be come to on those lines. I\r\n    assured him of my warm support for a large scheme. I think this was\r\n    the occasion (about this time) when Randolph, who was thinking of\r\n    going to India, vented his anger as to Salisbury. Winston Churchill\r\n    told me in March, 1901, that his father had come to terms with\r\n    Salisbury as to the future Tory Government before he started for\r\n    India. I told him this could not be, as the possibility of forming\r\n    one depended on the Irish, and that Lord Salisbury could not at this\r\n    early date have agreed to buy them by the promises of (1) Enquiry\r\n    into Spencer's police, (2) no Coercion, (3) a Viceroy personally\r\n    favourable to Home Rule.\r\n\r\n    'In the evening I dined with the Duchess of Manchester to meet the\r\n    Dufferins, on which occasion Dufferin shone, but his health and\r\n    spirits were now beginning to decline. Hartington was at the dinner,\r\n    and told me that he had had a fresh interview with Beach, this time\r\n    at his (Hartington's) request.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, November 1st, I had some correspondence with\r\n    Hartington about these interviews, of which I warmly approved; and\r\n    on the 3rd Hartington wrote to me that he was going to see Beach\r\n    again that day, and I placed all my scheme before him for\r\n    communication to the Conservative front bench.'\r\n\r\nPublicly there was war.\r\n\r\n    'On November 4th was the laying of the foundation-stone of the\r\n    National Liberal Club, at which Harcourt, after saying that he was a\r\n    moderate politician, compared the House of Lords to Sodom and\r\n    Gomorrah.'\r\n\r\nBut privately\r\n\r\n    'on this day Hartington again saw Beach, and afterwards\r\n    Churchill.... Beach said that Lord Salisbury unreservedly accepted\r\n    the Queen's suggestion for a meeting of the leaders.... Conferences\r\n    went on, but all through the month Beach declined to take a\r\n    \"representative character, or negotiate in such a way as would\r\n    commit his party\"--to use Hartington's words. Hartington now thought\r\n    \"Mr. Gladstone would be able either to come to terms with Lord\r\n    Salisbury or to put him completely in the wrong.\" Hartington added:\r\n    \"Beach very much regrets the Lowther and John Manners speeches,\"'\r\n\r\nand probably Lord Hartington expressed regret for Sir William Harcourt's\r\nreferences to Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n    'On the 6th there was a meeting of my Committee on Redistribution to\r\n    consider Beach's proposals, at which I took the chair, but did\r\n    little else, and left all the talking to the others, and their view\r\n    came to this--that they were quite willing to agree to the Tory\r\n    revolutionary scheme, provided the Tories would take the odium with\r\n    the House of Commons of proposing it.'\r\n\r\n    'On November 7th the Cabinet decided that I should be joined to\r\n    Hartington as recognized plenipotentiary.'\r\n\r\nOn the 10th\r\n\r\n    'I proposed and Mr. Gladstone agreed to write to Lord Salisbury\r\n    \"distinctly accepting the Queen's offers.\" On November 11th we\r\n    confirmed our decisions at the last Cabinet as to completely taking\r\n    away from Lord Salisbury the power of saying that he had accepted\r\n    and we declined the Queen's proposals, by unreservedly supporting\r\n    Mr. Gladstone's letter to the Queen.'\r\n\r\nOn November 15th Mr. Gladstone informed the Cabinet that the Lords were\r\nunyielding.\r\n\r\n    'Northcote had taken tea with him on the previous evening. The Lords\r\n    would not part with the Franchise Bill till the Redistribution Bill\r\n    was in their House. As regarded Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford\r\n    Northcote, Mr. Gladstone considered the door absolutely closed, but\r\n    he was informed that the Duke of Richmond and Lord Cairns did not\r\n    agree with the leaders. We then drew up a statement to be made on\r\n    Monday, November 17th, in both Houses of Parliament as to the steps\r\n    we had taken to produce conciliation, Harcourt saying: \"This is the\r\n    apple-woman spitting on her old apples and shining 'em up!\"--the\r\n    fact being that it was only done to put the Lords in the wrong.'\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, November 17th, when I returned from Sandringham, I had\r\n    to see Lord Rowton, who had been sent to me by the Prince of Wales\r\n    to try and produce a settlement of the Redistribution difficulty,\r\n    but we only sat and smiled at one another; he saying that he had\r\n    come because he had been told to come, and I saying that I had\r\n    nothing new to tell him, for Lord Salisbury knew all we had to say.'\r\n\r\n    'On November 19th there was a Cabinet. The first matter mentioned\r\n    was the arrangement with the Conservatives for an interview, and at\r\n    four o'clock on this day, November 19th, occurred the first meeting\r\n    of the parties: an interview between Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford\r\n    Northcote on the one side, and Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville on\r\n    the other. Lord Salisbury had written to me about it already, and\r\n    had privately seen my papers the previous day at the Commission, and\r\n    had asked me a great number of questions, and I had given him my\r\n    division of the Metropolis and of Lancashire at his wish, and\r\n    received from him the following note: \"I do not know whether it will\r\n    be possible to discuss the application of the one-member principle\r\n    to the Counties and the Metropolitan Constituencies and the suburbs\r\n    of the larger towns.\" The hesitating way in which he asked shows\r\n    that we might have avoided the single-members had we fought upon the\r\n    point. But, as I liked them myself, I fought the other way, against\r\n    Mr. Gladstone. At the interview between the leaders of the two\r\n    parties and the two Houses it was merely decided that the real\r\n    interview should take place on Saturday, November 22nd, at noon\r\n    between the two Conservative chiefs and Mr. Gladstone, Lord\r\n    Hartington, and me, Lord Granville being left out as knowing nothing\r\n    of the subject. On November 21st I continued my private conference\r\n    with Lord Salisbury at the Royal Commission, and we settled who the\r\n    Boundary Commissioners should be. On Saturday, November 22nd, I had\r\n    a conference with Chamberlain before going to the meeting with Lord\r\n    Salisbury. Chamberlain was in favour of two-member seats as against\r\n    single members, especially for boroughs. He was as clear as was Lord\r\n    Salisbury that the single-member system would damage the Liberal\r\n    party in the Metropolis.\r\n\r\n    'In the afternoon the Conference took place, and there never was so\r\n    friendly and pleasant a meeting. I fully described it in three\r\n    letters to Chamberlain, in which I said, among other things: \"It\r\n    looks as though Lord Salisbury is really anxious that we should pass\r\n    our Bill.\" No memorandum on this day passed in writing, and the\r\n    written compact was concluded between Lord Salisbury and me only on\r\n    November 28th. The meeting of the 22nd was known at the time as the\r\n    Downing Street meeting; and the other as \"the Arlington Street\r\n    compact.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, November 23rd, Lord Salisbury wrote to me a letter which\r\n    I sent on to Mr. Gladstone and which he kept. Mr. Gladstone replied\r\n    on the same day undertaking to move the adjournment of the House for\r\n    a week, and showing that he was not at all sure that Lord Salisbury,\r\n    having got from us the whole of our scheme and given us nothing in\r\n    writing which was worth anything, did not mean to sell us.\r\n    Chamberlain wrote on the same day in reply to my letters, \"I cannot\r\n    make head or tail of Salisbury. He appears to be swallowing every\r\n    word that he has ever written or spoken about Redistribution.... I\r\n    wonder if he will carry his party with him.... On the whole, you\r\n    seem to be doing very well.\"'\r\n\r\nDiscussion now went on by correspondence between Sir Charles and Lord\r\nSalisbury, and it touched subjects which might easily have led to\r\nfriction. Lord Salisbury proposed to create a number of urban\r\nconstituencies by grouping; his plan being to get the small towns taken\r\nout of rural districts which he looked upon as otherwise Conservative,\r\nand to group them with small manufacturing boroughs:\r\n\r\n    'I was aghast at this suggestion, because it was a very difficult\r\n    thing, in a Parliamentary sense, to create a few such groups in\r\n    England; and if the thing was to be carried far and not confined to\r\n    a few cases only it would entirely have destroyed the whole of the\r\n    work that we had done, because all the counties would have had their\r\n    numbers altered. I therefore fought stoutly for my own scheme, which\r\n    I succeeded in carrying almost untouched. Lord Salisbury's letter\r\n    crossed one from me to him in which, after Mr. Gladstone's leave\r\n    (conveyed in the words \"I see no objection to sending him this\r\n    excellent and succinct paper marked Secret\"), I had communicated to\r\n    Lord Salisbury my views and the grounds on which they were based.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 26th, at four o'clock, we met at Downing Street, all five\r\n    being present.... Lord Salisbury, yielding to my reasoning, gave up\r\n    grouping,' on the understanding that the Boundary Commissioners were\r\n    'to keep the urban patches as far as possible by themselves....\r\n    Ultimately it was settled that single-member districts should be\r\n    universal in counties, and that we should leave open for the present\r\n    the question of how far it should be applied to boroughs.'\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury wished to retain the minority clause in places where he\r\nthought it had worked well, but he did not ask for it in Birmingham and\r\nGlasgow. 'All this showed great indecision,' says Sir Charles, and he\r\nobserves that 'Lord Salisbury did not seem to me thoroughly to\r\nunderstand his subject.' It is probable, at all events, that he was no\r\nmatch on the details either for Sir Charles or for Mr. Gladstone, who,\r\nafter the Conference, thus summed up his impressions in a letter dated\r\nNovember 26th:\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    'I send you herewith for your consideration a first sketch which I\r\n    have made of a possible communication to-morrow after the Cabinet\r\n    from us to the Legates of the opposite party. I think that if the\r\n    Cabinet make it an _ultimatum_ we should be safe with it. There was\r\n    a careful abstention to-day on their side from anything beyond\r\n    praising this or that, and at the outset they spoke of the\r\n    one-member system for boroughs \"with exceptions\" as what they\r\n    desired.\r\n\r\n    'Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    'W. E. Gladstone.'\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone's memorandum was on my lines. On the next morning,\r\n    November 27th, Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville, Hartington, I, and\r\n    Chamberlain met before the Cabinet at 11 o'clock, and kept the\r\n    Cabinet waiting, the Cabinet having been called for twelve, and\r\n    Redistribution alone being considered at it. I announced at the\r\n    Cabinet that the Tories proposed and we accepted single-member\r\n    districts universally in counties, boundaries to be drawn by a\r\n    commission who were to separate urban from rural as far as possible,\r\n    without grouping and without creating constituencies of utterly\r\n    eccentric shape. The names of the commissioners had been settled,\r\n    and both sides were pledged to accept their proposals, unless the\r\n    two sides agreed to differ from them. [Footnote: At the meeting of\r\n    the 26th 'it was agreed that the Boundary Commissioners should\r\n    consist of those gentlemen who had been advising me.']\r\n\r\n    'The Tories proposed single-member districts almost everywhere in\r\n    boroughs, and only positively named one exception--the City of\r\n    London--but were evidently prepared to make some exceptions. They\r\n    made our agreement on this point the condition of passing the\r\n    Franchise Bill, of giving up the decrease of the Irish members from\r\n    103 to 100 which they urged, of giving up all forms of minority\r\n    vote, and of giving up grouping. My own opinion and that of the\r\n    Prime Minister were in favour of agreement. Hartington, who much\r\n    disliked what he thought would be the extinction of the Whigs by an\r\n    omnipresent caucus for candidates' selection, was hostile to the\r\n    single-member system. I pointed out that we already proposed in our\r\n    amended scheme 120 single-member borough seats out of 284 borough\r\n    seats. We had thrown out to the Tories a question as to whether they\r\n    would accept, say, 184 single-borough seats, and give us, say, not\r\n    more than 100 for double-member seats; or, if they liked, two-thirds\r\n    and one-third; and they did not positively decline this suggestion.\r\n    Mr. Gladstone proposed to \"save from compulsory division those urban\r\n    constituencies, not Metropolitan, which, now possessing dual\r\n    representation, are to have their representation neither increased\r\n    nor diminished.\" (This was the ultimate agreement.) Also, that\r\n    \"cities and towns which are to receive four members and upwards, ten\r\n    in number, should have one central or principal area set apart with\r\n    two members.\" (This was purely personal on Mr. Gladstone's part and\r\n    was universally rejected.)\r\n\r\n    'I argued warmly in favour of supporting Lord Salisbury's scheme\r\n    (upon which he and I were absolutely agreed), I being delighted at\r\n    having got seven more members for the Metropolis than were given by\r\n    my scheme in its last form after the Cabinet had cut it down. In\r\n    order to secure Chamberlain's support I told him \"I might be able to\r\n    save a seat for you and give the extended Birmingham seven if you\r\n    liked to make that a condition, but in that case I must get one\r\n    somewhere for Glasgow also out of the rest of Scotland, which is\r\n    skinning flints.\"\r\n\r\n    'The reception of our proposals by the Cabinet, to which Grosvenor'\r\n    (the Chief Whip) 'had been called in, was not altogether favourable.\r\n    Childers talked about resigning, and Grosvenor was most hostile. We\r\n    had the enormous advantage, however, that Chamberlain and I and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone were the only three people who understood the subject, so\r\n    that the others were unable to fight except in the form known as\r\n    swearing at large. I was sent off from the Cabinet to Lord Salisbury\r\n    to tell him that we could agree. At three o'clock we had a further\r\n    conference with the Conservative leaders, and came to an agreement\r\n    on my base, Chamberlain, who was somewhat hostile, yielding to me, I\r\n    going in and out to him, for he was at Downing Street in another\r\n    room.'\r\n\r\nNext day memoranda were exchanged between the parties to the Conference,\r\nand Mr. Gladstone was pledged to stand by the heads set down in his\r\nmemoranda, and accept no provision outside of these without Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote's agreement. One detail is of interest as illustrating Mr.\r\nGladstone's inherited Conservatism, which comes out all through these\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone in sending this (memorandum) to me said: \"You will\r\n    see that Salisbury stands upon our printed statement as to\r\n    Universities.\" Mr. Gladstone, knowing that I was strongly opposed to\r\n    University representation, took this matter upon himself. He\r\n    proposed a more general form of words in place of Lord Salisbury's\r\n    pledge against new matters, and, as for Universities, wrote: \"Assure\r\n    Salisbury that I personally will _bind_ myself out and out to this\r\n    proposition.\"'\r\n\r\n    'In the afternoon I went to Lord Salisbury to settle the terms of\r\n    agreement, and had to go four times from him to Mr. Gladstone, and\r\n    four times back again, before we finished....\r\n\r\n    'The next day I lunched with Mr. Gladstone to meet Miss Mary\r\n    Anderson, the actress, and Princess Louise. I received at lunch a\r\n    letter from Lord Salisbury making a few reservations ... none of\r\n    them difficult of acceptance.\r\n\r\n    'On December 2nd I got a note from Harcourt--to ask what I had been\r\n    doing with the British Constitution in his absence. On December 8th\r\n    I had a serious grumble from Spencer from Dublin as to my having\r\n    settled with Salisbury who were to be the Irish Commissioners, and\r\n    only asked the Irish Government after the thing was done. I had\r\n    undoubtedly been wrong, and can only say that Spencer let me off\r\n    cheaply....'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's holiday in the South of France, whither he went on\r\nDecember 17th, was broken by copies of a correspondence between Lord\r\nSpencer and Lord Salisbury, the latter writing 'with much sound and\r\nfury' on the question of another Conservative Boundary Commissioner for\r\nIreland. 'Lord Salisbury had always been so extremely soft and sweet to\r\nme that it was a revelation to find him writing to Spencer in the style\r\nof Harcourt or of Chamberlain when in a passion.'\r\n\r\n    'Sir Stafford Northcote also wrote to me upon the subject, and\r\n    passing on to Scotland in his letter, added, \"It is, I think,\r\n    understood that we may have a free fight over the grouping of Scotch\r\n    boroughs.\" This question of the Scotch boroughs was afterwards\r\n    referred to me and Charles Dalrymple (M.P. for Buteshire), and I\r\n    gave Dalrymple one or two changes that he wanted, which, I think,\r\n    did not matter.'\r\n\r\nSuch difficulties were few and subordinate. The scheme was settled in\r\nprinciple, for after the Arlington Street compact\r\n\r\n    'I wrote the letter to the Boundary Commissioners the same night,\r\n    and after I had signed their instructions on December 5th I had a\r\n    pause in my Redistribution work for some time.'\r\n\r\nBut at the end of December Lord Hartington wrote:\r\n\r\n    'I think it will take two of us all our time to work the Bill\r\n    through; and you know so much more about it than anybody else that\r\n    you must necessarily take the greatest share of the details';\r\n\r\nand ended with an invitation to Sir Charles to stay at Hardwick to do\r\nsome preliminary work on the measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS IN 1884\r\n\r\nMrs. Mark Patterson\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nDuring 1884 'I warned Lord Granville, Mr. Gladstone, Fitzmaurice, and\r\nChilders, that I should not in future be able to speak on foreign\r\naffairs on account of the terrible work of the Redistribution Bill, and\r\nof the Royal Commission,' for 'I was now so busy with the preparation\r\nfor working the Redistribution Bill through the House, and with the\r\nReport of the Royal Commission, that I objected to receiving Foreign\r\nOffice papers not sent to other members of the Cabinet ... but Lord\r\nGranville insisted that I should still see them, and circulated a letter\r\nto that effect.'\r\n\r\nDuring 1884 and 1885 Foreign Office work was not only exacting, but was\r\nconnected with acute disagreements in the Ministry itself. It has been\r\nseen how closely Sir Charles was occupied with the Egyptian question,\r\nand how constantly he found himself opposed to Lord Hartington in his\r\nviews of policy. Moreover, out of the Egyptian difficulty there sprang a\r\ngeneral divergence from France, and this led to action by France in\r\nvarious quarters of the globe calculated to offend British\r\nsusceptibilities and to injure British prestige. Sir Charles, friend of\r\nFrance as he was, had been strong for resenting and resisting such\r\naction, and this attitude had brought him into conflict with those who\r\non the whole had supported him in Egyptian matters. A new factor was now\r\nintroduced. Bismarck had previously been content to urge on the French\r\nin their colonization policy, but in 1884 the German Chancellor, who in\r\n1883 had been working out his schemes of national insurance, found his\r\nhand forced by the Colonial party, and, in view of the coming German\r\nelections, could no longer afford to ignore them. Bismarck, 'contrary to\r\nhis conviction and his will,' said Lord Ampthill, accepted a policy of\r\ncolonization, which had the secondary effect of harassing and\r\nhumiliating the British Liberal Administration. [Footnote: _Life of\r\nGranville_, vol. ii., p. 355.] Sir Charles, who realized that every such\r\nannexation meant the exclusion of British trade from an actual or\r\npotential market, fought for strong British action, but he fought\r\nagainst the older Liberals of the Cabinet. Again and again the Radical\r\nleaders were overborne by Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThe German Government had demanded protection for a German firm of\r\ntraders who had established themselves in the territory of Angra\r\nPequena, on the west coast of Africa, 280 miles south of Walfisch Bay.\r\nLord Granville, after considerable delays, caused chiefly by the\r\nnecessity of consulting the Colonial Office, which in its turn had to\r\nconsult the Cape Government, where a change of Ministry was impending,\r\nobjected to the declaration of a German protectorate.\r\n\r\n    'June 14th, 1884.--At a Cabinet at Lord Granville's house on\r\n    Conference.... Waddington waiting in another room.\r\n\r\n    'H. Bismarck was also in the house, and had been very rude to Lord\r\n    Granville about Angra Pequena, which was mentioned to the Cabinet,\r\n    which would do nothing.\r\n\r\n    'June 2lth--... Angra Pequena was mentioned, and it was decided that\r\n    Bismarck, who was greatly irritated with the Government, was to have\r\n    all he wanted.\r\n\r\n    'On September 22nd Chamberlain came to me on his return from abroad.\r\n    He told me that H. Bismarck had told him that the German Chancellor\r\n    was very angry at having had no answer to a full statement of German\r\n    views as to Angra Pequena and other colonial matters, which had been\r\n    sent to Lord Granville on August 30th, and he was astonished to\r\n    learn that the Cabinet had not seen his letter....\r\n\r\n    'On the 27th Lord Granville had in the meantime written: \"I will\r\n    send you my letter and Bismarck's answer, but I do not wish the\r\n    correspondence to be mentioned.... My only excuse, but a good one,\r\n    for acting merely as a medium between the German Government and the\r\n    Colonial Office, was that I had continually the most positive\r\n    assurances in London, and still more in Berlin, that Bismarck was\r\n    dead against German colonization--as he _was_.\"' [Footnote: On this\r\n    chapter of African history, see _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., chap.\r\n    x., _passim_.]\r\n\r\nThis was the first of a series of instances in which, to Sir Charles's\r\ngreat disgust, the British Foreign and Colonial Offices 'lay down to\r\nGermany.'\r\n\r\nSince the annexation of part of New Guinea by Queensland had been\r\ndisavowed in April, 1883, all Australia was vehemently concerned over\r\nthe ultimate fate of this territory, and pressed the home Government to\r\nforestall other Powers by occupying it.\r\n\r\n    'June 27th we discussed New Guinea, as to which Lord Derby was\r\n    getting into serious trouble.\r\n\r\n    'On July 5th there was a Cabinet called to consider what was called\r\n    the \"crisis\"--our relation with the House of Lords over the\r\n    Franchise. But so peculiar is the British Empire that, although the\r\n    Cabinet was called upon this question, we immediately proceeded to\r\n    consider for the greater portion of the day matters in Sumatra, in\r\n    the Malay Archipelago, and the Pacific, and ... the affairs of New\r\n    Guinea and so forth. Harcourt, Lord Selborne, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    violently opposed the occupation of New Guinea--Harcourt and Mr.\r\n    Gladstone on anti-imperialistic grounds, and Lord Selborne on\r\n    grounds connected with the protection of the aborigines against the\r\n    rapacity and violence of the Queensland settlers. Hartington, Lord\r\n    Granville, Derby, Kimberley, Chamberlain, and I, took the Australian\r\n    view. The matter was adjourned, as matters always are adjourned when\r\n    the Prime Minister is against the Cabinet.'\r\n\r\n    'August 6th.--We then attacked New Guinea, most of us wanting\r\n    annexation, some protectorate, and decided on the latter to please\r\n    the Chancellor and Mr. Gladstone.'\r\n\r\n    'August 9th.--We first discussed German colonies in the South Seas.\r\n    Bismarck had seized North New Guinea, and we decided to stick to the\r\n    long peninsula which faces both north and south.'\r\n\r\nBismarck's immediate answer was to annex, not only the north coast, but\r\nwhat is now called the Bismarck Archipelago.\r\n\r\n    'October 4th.--Next came New Guinea. Were we to insist, as we had\r\n    done previously, on keeping the Germans off the north coast of the\r\n    long eastern peninsula? The previous decision was reversed. The\r\n    Cabinet, however, vetoed a suggestion for the joint commission with\r\n    Germany as to land claims in the Pacific Islands being allowed to\r\n    meddle in New Guinea. We then decided to annex one quarter, and\r\n    several members of the Cabinet expressed a hope that _this time_ the\r\n    thing would \"really be done.\"' [Footnote: A useful sketch of these\r\n    events has recently appeared in the paper read before the Royal\r\n    Geographical Society by Sir Everard Im Thurn, K.C.M.G. See\r\n    _Journal_, vol. xlv., No. 5, April, 1915.]\r\n\r\nThese instances did not stand alone. Two native chiefs in the Cameroons\r\nhad so far back as 1882 proposed to be taken under British protection,\r\nand Sir Charles had pressed acceptance of their offer. The matter had\r\nbeen discussed in the Cabinet, and Lord Derby and Lord Granville were\r\nstill debating what should be done, when a German expedition seized the\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n    'On September 18th I received from Chamberlain a letter from\r\n    Leipsic, in which he said: \"The Cameroons! It is enough to make one\r\n    sick. As you say, we decided to assume the protectorate eighteen\r\n    months ago, and I thought it was all settled. If the Board of Trade\r\n    or Local Government Board managed their business after the fashion\r\n    of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office, you and I would deserve\r\n    to be hung.\"'\r\n\r\nThose who thought with Sir Charles felt considerable anxiety about\r\npossibilities on the East Coast of Africa. The Cameroons were lost, but\r\na protectorate over Zanzibar had been offered, and Zanzibar was the\r\noutlet for an important trading district, which the forward party\r\nthought of securing. The Prime Minister was opposed to all such schemes.\r\n'On December 14th Mr. Gladstone broke out against the proposed\r\nannexations in what is now called the Kilimanjaro district.'\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Sir Charles: 'Terribly have I been puzzled and perplexed on\r\nfinding a group of the soberest men among us to have concocted a scheme\r\nsuch as that touching the mountain country behind Zanzibar with an\r\nunrememberable name. There _must_ somewhere or other be reasons for it\r\nwhich have not come before me. I have asked Granville whether it may not\r\nstand over for a while.' [Footnote: The allusion is to the treaties with\r\nnative chiefs which were negotiated by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Harry\r\nJohnston in 1883-84. These treaties were the foundation of what is now\r\nknown as British East Africa, and related mainly to the Kilimanjaro and\r\nTaveita districts. It would appear that Mr. Gladstone himself had at\r\nfirst expressed an interest in the development of British influence\r\n'over this hinterland of snow mountains and elevated plateaux,' to which\r\nhis attention had been drawn by the report of Mr. Joseph Thomson.\r\nSpeaking subsequently at the Colonial Institute, Sir Harry Johnston said\r\nthat 'about twenty years ago he was making preparations for his first\r\nexpedition to British Africa. He had a very distinguished predecessor,\r\nwhom he regarded as the real originator of British East Africa: Mr.\r\nJoseph Thomson, who died all too young in 1895. His great journey from\r\nMombasa was commenced in 1882 and finished in 1884.... His reports sent\r\nhome to the Royal Geographical Society had attracted the attention of\r\nMr. Gladstone; and there was another British statesman, Lord Edmond\r\nFitzmaurice, who perhaps more than most of his colleagues saw the\r\npossibility of a white man's settlement in Equatorial Africa, and who\r\nchose to select him (Sir H. Johnston) as one agency by which this work\r\nshould be commenced.' (_Journal_ of the Royal Colonial Institute,\r\n1903-04, No. 5, p. 317.) The territory covered by the Kilimanjaro\r\nTreaties was ceded to Germany under the arrangement made at the end of\r\n1885, but the remainder has continued to be British (see Sir Harry\r\nJohnston, _A History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races_, pp.\r\n376-409.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone could not bring himself to understand that the great\r\nStates of Europe had, almost without premeditation, moved into a field\r\nof policy which involved the apportionment of regions scarcely yet known\r\nin any detail to the geographers; nor did he realize the far-reaching\r\nconsequences of the acquisition or refusal of some of these districts.\r\nThe question of the Congo, for example, involved, as Sir Robert Morier\r\nhad foreseen, the settlement of the whole West African coast. In April\r\nSir Charles had recorded how he\r\n\r\n    'had to read up African papers, and found reason to fear that the\r\n    King of the Belgians was contemplating the sale of his Congo\r\n    dominions to France. We had a meeting at the Foreign Office in the\r\n    afternoon, [Footnote: April 26th, 1884.] at which were present Lord\r\n    Granville, Kimberley, Chamberlain, myself, and Fitzmaurice, and,\r\n    finding that we could not possibly carry our Congo Treaty with\r\n    Portugal, we determined to find a way out by referring it to the\r\n    Powers.' [Footnote: The following extract from an article in the\r\n    _Quarterly Review_ explains the importance attached by Sir Charles\r\n    to this Congo treaty, and the far-reaching results which it would\r\n    have had:\r\n\r\n    'In 1875 the results of Lieutenant Cameron's great journey across\r\n    Africa became known.... They revealed ... the material for a Central\r\n    African Empire awaiting the enterprise of a European or an Asiatic\r\n    power. There is now little doubt that, had the famous treaty\r\n    negotiated by Sir Charles Dilke, Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, and Sir\r\n    Robert Morier in 1884, been ratified and carried out ... the Congo\r\n    Basin would have been added to the British Empire, together with\r\n    Delagoa Bay and Nyasaland, before its time; with Dahomey also, and\r\n    an all-British West African Coast between Sierra Leone and the\r\n    Gaboon.' (_Quarterly Review_, January, 1906.)\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps have been more accurate had the author spoken of the\r\n'treaty proposed to be negotiated.' The original plan of Sir Robert\r\nMorier--part of a large scheme for the settlement of all outstanding\r\nquestions with Portugal--contemplated _inter alia_ some territorial\r\nacquisition on the Congo by Great Britain. But the Cabinet put a veto on\r\nthis. The Foreign Office had therefore to fall back on the alternative\r\nbut less ambitious plan contained in the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of\r\n1884, which was never ratified, owing to the opposition of Germany.\r\n(_Life of Granville_, vol. ii., chap. x.; and supra, I. 418. See also\r\non this subject the observations of Sir Harry Johnston in his _History_,\r\nquoted above, pp. 277, 278, 343, 405.)]\r\n\r\nIn October he goes on to relate how\r\n\r\n    'Lord Granville had been frightened by Plessen, the Prussian, coming\r\n    to invite him to a Conference at Berlin, but explained that he had\r\n    been much relieved on finding, as he put it, that it was only about\r\n    the Congo. It was, however, the famous Africa Conference which\r\n    virtually settled the whole future of the Dark Continent.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes the result in January, 1885:\r\n\r\n    'The sittings of the West African Conference, as it was called, were\r\n    at this time taking place at Berlin, and the General Act was signed\r\n    in the following month--that of February, 1885. [Footnote: He notes\r\n    in this month, February 4th, at \"a meeting at the Admiralty of all\r\n    the Ministers in town, Childers and I stand alone in support of\r\n    Portugal as regards the Congo. I stated very freely what I still\r\n    believe, that we had behaved shamefully to the Portuguese; but this\r\n    neither convinced Lord Granville at the time, nor excused the\r\n    subsequent behaviour of the Portuguese.\" On February 11th Sir\r\n    Charles wrote to a diplomatic friend: \"I cannot quite follow the\r\n    present phase of Congo, but I hope that nothing will be done to back\r\n    up the rascally association against Portugal. I believe that\r\n    Portugal will seize the disputed territory, and I certainly should\r\n    if I were the Portuguese Ministry.\"] I was very busy with this work,\r\n    in which I had long taken a deep interest, and was much relieved\r\n    when I found that what I thought the folly of the House of Commons\r\n    in upsetting our Congo Treaty, and preventing a general arrangement\r\n    with the Portuguese as regarded both West Africa and South-East\r\n    Africa, had turned out better than could have been anticipated,\r\n    owing to the interposition of the Germans. My joy was short-lived,\r\n    for King Leopold has not kept his promises.'\r\n\r\nThe interests thus claimed or created beyond the seas had to be defended\r\nupon the seas. Either Great Britain must be prepared to abate her\r\npretensions, or she must strengthen her power to enforce them. Dilke and\r\nChamberlain were strongly against giving way to anything which could be\r\nregarded as usurpation. Mr. Gladstone, on the other hand, pointed out\r\nthat to maintain a control, or veto, over the allocation of\r\nunappropriated portions of the globe meant large increase of naval\r\nexpenditure, and he set his face against both. On December 2nd\r\n\r\n    'Naval expenditure was mentioned. The Cabinet had been about to\r\n    agree both to Northbrook's proposals (for Egypt) and to the sums\r\n    suggested for the defence of coaling-stations, when Mr. Gladstone\r\n    suddenly broke out, told us that he did not much care for himself,\r\n    as he now intended to retire, but that had he been twenty-five years\r\n    younger nothing could have induced him to consent. A loan he would\r\n    not tolerate. Then there was a general veer round, and all went\r\n    against the fortifications. Mr. Gladstone, however, said that he\r\n    should retire as soon as the Redistribution Bill was carried.'\r\n\r\nThe affairs of South Africa, where Great Britain was consolidating her\r\nposition, are also touched on in 1884.\r\n\r\n    'On March 22nd we had another Cabinet without Mr. Gladstone. The\r\n    first matter discussed was Zululand, Chamberlain opposing Kimberley\r\n    and Derby, who wished to increase the British Protectorate. At last\r\n    Kimberley said: \"I see the Cabinet do not want more niggers,\" and\r\n    dropped the scheme.\r\n\r\n    'On May 17th ... we decided to defend the Zululand reserve against\r\n    all comers.'\r\n\r\nLater in the year there are entries as to the annexation of\r\nBechuanaland:\r\n\r\nOctober 4th, 'Bechuanaland was discussed, as to which Chamberlain wanted\r\nto go to war with the Boers, and had written to me.'\r\n\r\nAnd on November 11th 'there was a Cabinet called on the Bechuanaland\r\ntrouble, and we discussed votes of money for the Gordon and Bechuanaland\r\nexpeditions.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Central Asian question, always of first-rate\r\ninterest to Sir Charles, constantly claimed his attention.\r\n\r\n    'On February 22nd there was a meeting at the Foreign Office which\r\n    was intended to be a meeting about my Central Asian scheme, but\r\n    which developed into a virtual Cabinet. There were present Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, Hartington, Kimberley, Northbrook, myself, Fitzmaurice,\r\n    and J. K. Cross, Undersecretary of State for India. The delimitation\r\n    of the Afghan frontier was further considered and pretty much\r\n    decided.\r\n\r\n    'Pleasures of Office. I dined with the Dean of Westminster, and was\r\n    called away in the middle of dinner to make a speech about Central\r\n    Asia, and got back again for coffee.'\r\n\r\n    'On March 5th Hartington suggested that we should recommence the\r\n    Quetta railroad, and it was decided to give a hint to Lord Ripon to\r\n    ask for it.'\r\n\r\n    'August 5th.--Lord Granville informed us that the Shah was alarmed\r\n    at the Russian advance upon the Persian frontier, and asked us for\r\n    promises.\r\n\r\n    'August 7th.--There was a meeting of the Central Asian Committee....\r\n    Lord Granville, Hartington, Kimberley, I, and Fitzmaurice were\r\n    present, with Philip Currie. As to the amount of support to be given\r\n    to Persia Lord Granville wrote an excellent despatch, while we were\r\n    talking. It was settled that we were to repeat our statements at St.\r\n    Petersburg at a convenient opportunity, but to ask the Shah that, as\r\n    an earnest of his good intentions towards us, the Persian rivers\r\n    should be thrown open to our trade--not a bad touchstone. We\r\n    discussed the Afghan boundary, and decided that, if the Russians\r\n    would not agree to our proposed starting-point for the delimitation,\r\n    we would send an Afghan British Commission without them to make our\r\n    own, delimitation.'\r\n\r\n    'November 18th.--Edmond Fitzmaurice consulted me as to Central Asia.\r\n    The Russians had agreed in principle to the delimitation, but ...\r\n    had made much delay in questions of detail.'\r\n\r\nOn the Committee Sir Charles and Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice were unequally\r\nyoked with the lethargic Secretary of State for War. Lord Fitzmaurice\r\nhas vivid recollection of Lord Hartington's entry at one sitting half an\r\nhour late, after his fashion. The question turned on the probable action\r\nof some Afghan chiefs, whereupon Lord Hartington broke silence by\r\nobserving reflectively: \"I wonder what an Afghan chief is like.\" Sir\r\nCharles, with a glance at the high-nosed, bearded, deliberate face of\r\nhis colleague, pushed a scribbled note to Lord Edmond: \"I expect an\r\nAfghan chief is very like the Right Honourable the Marquis of\r\nHartington.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's interest in this Central Asian question, where political\r\nand military interests lay so close together, led to a correspondence,\r\nand the correspondence to a friendship, with Lord Roberts.\r\n\r\n    'In March I received a letter from Sir Frederick Roberts, not yet\r\n    personally known to me, in which he enclosed a memorandum by him\r\n    called \"Is an Invasion of India by Russia Possible?\" In his letter\r\n    he said that he had given up the idea of returning to Kandahar, and\r\n    only desired that we should make ourselves secure upon our new\r\n    frontier, improve our relations with the Afghans, and clearly show\r\n    that we could not allow the Russians to establish themselves in\r\n    Northern Afghanistan. In his printed paper he showed that Persia\r\n    might be looked upon as virtually Russian, and that what we had to\r\n    do was to prevent Afghanistan falling into the same position. He\r\n    incidentally admitted the strength of the view of those of us who\r\n    had advocated the evacuation of Kandahar by saying that the Afghans\r\n    \"must be assured that we have no designs upon their country, and\r\n    that even should circumstances require a British occupation of\r\n    Kandahar, the direction of all internal affairs would be left in\r\n    their hands; we must guarantee them the integrity of their kingdom.\"\r\n    He strongly supported my view that no time should be lost in\r\n    defining the northern boundary of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n    'Roberts went on to lay down the principle that the main body of a\r\n    Russian army destined for the invasion of India must advance by\r\n    Herat and Girishk on Kandahar, whence, if not defeated, the Russians\r\n    must move by Ghazni, Kabul, and the Khyber. Sir Frederick Roberts\r\n    pointed out that India could not place in the field, under the then\r\n    conditions, more than 40,000 men, with from 130 to 140 guns. Part of\r\n    the native army could be relied on, but, writing as Commander-in-\r\n    Chief in Madras, he pointed out that the Southern Indian Sepoys had\r\n    not the courage and physique to fight against Russian troops, or\r\n    even against natives from the north. On the other hand, many of our\r\n    northern native troops would be of doubtful loyalty in the event of\r\n    Russia becoming predominant in Afghanistan. \"Sir Fred\" laid down\r\n    the principle of completing railway communication to a point near\r\n    Kandahar, with a bridge across the Indus near Sukkur, and generally\r\n    described the plan of a vigorous offensive on the Kandahar side and\r\n    a defensive on the Khyber line, which has since been adopted.'\r\n\r\n    'At the end of May I received from Sir Frederick Roberts a letter in\r\n    reply to mine, acknowledging the receipt of the Defence of India\r\n    papers which I have named. I had told him that the real danger was\r\n    that Russia would detach Herat by local intrigue without appearing,\r\n    and that I did not see how we could prevent this alarming danger.\r\n    Sir Frederick admitted the truth of my view, and again pointed out\r\n    the importance of trying to win the friendship of the Afghans. He\r\n    favoured my proposals for the delimitation of the northern frontier\r\n    of Afghanistan. \"But I much doubt Russia's now agreeing to any\r\n    proposal of the sort.\" He ended by expressing his gratification at\r\n    our issue of the order for the completion of the railway to Quetta\r\n    and Pishin.'\r\n\r\nDiscussions preliminary to the Budget occupied the Cabinet in January,\r\n1884, and Mr. Childers announced that the Army and Navy Estimates would\r\nleave him with a deficit, chiefly because the newly introduced parcel\r\npost had been 'a disastrous failure.'\r\n\r\n    'In the course of this Cabinet of January 24th, I for the first time\r\n    stated my views on the subject of army reform. I have a slip of\r\n    paper which passed backwards and forwards between Chamberlain and\r\n    myself, headed \"The condition of the army.\" I wrote: \"Do you\r\n    remember my saying one night in our cab to you that I could not go\r\n    to the W.O. because of my views upon this very point?\" Chamberlain\r\n    wrote back: \"But that really is the reason why you should go. I have\r\n    the lowest opinion of army administration wherever I can test it--\r\n    contracts, for instance. It is most ludicrously inefficient.\" To\r\n    which I replied: \"The Duke of Cambridge and the old soldiers and the\r\n    Queen would make it very nearly hopeless.\"'\r\n\r\nThe War Office never tempted Sir Charles as did the Admiralty, where, he\r\nwrote to Lord Granville in 1885, 'I fear I should be extravagant.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nA holiday home in the South of France had ceased to be easily accessible\r\nto the 'most hard-worked member of the Government.' Though for many\r\nyears he retained his little villa of 'La Sainte Campagne' near Toulon,\r\nnestling in its olive groves with, from windows and cliff, the view of\r\nthe red porphyry rocks across the deep blue of the bay, he had for some\r\ntime been negotiating for the purchase of strips of land by the\r\nriverside near Shepperton, and among the pines at Pyrford.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the building of the cottage at Dockett Eddy was begun, over the\r\ndoor of which he set this inscription:\r\n\r\n\"Parva sed apta mihi, sed nulli obnoxia, sed non Sordida, parta meo sed\r\ntamen aere, domus.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Thus rendered in English by the Rev. W. Tuckwell:\r\n\r\n  ''Tis tiny, but it suits me quite,\r\n  Invades no jealous neighbour's right;\r\n  'Tis neat and clean, and--pleasant thought--\r\n  I earned the cash with which 'twas bought.'\r\n\r\n(It was bought out of his official salary.)]\r\n\r\nThis was to be always his riverside home, and in it he always slept,\r\neven after the larger house had been built near by. There he was one of\r\nthe river's most jealous guardians, and in this year notes that he\r\n\r\n    'gave evidence before the Select Committee on the River Thames, and\r\n    was instrumental in securing the insertion of a clause in the Bill,\r\n    afterwards produced by the Committee, which put an end to shooting\r\n    on the Thames, and did a great deal to protect the quiet of the\r\n    river.'\r\n\r\nThe Dockett cottage was not finished till 1885, and:\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, March 21st, I took a holiday on the river, starting\r\n    down with my punt from Taplow Court, and bringing her down to\r\n    Dockett Eddy, of which I now took possession, the little house being\r\n    now finished.'\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd, 1884,\r\n\r\n    'I settled to go on Whitsun Tuesday to look at Lord Onslow's land at\r\n    Pyrford, for a winter house. I had forgotten that my ancestor Sir R.\r\n    Parkhurst had been Lord of the Manor of Pyrford, and that my\r\n    ancestor Sir Edward Zouche had lived even nearer to my new purchase,\r\n    at old Woking St. Peter, whence I hear his bells.'\r\n\r\nLate in the year\r\n\r\n    'I settled on my motto for my cottage at Pyrford--a line of Ruskin,\r\n    \"This is the true nature of Home,--it is the place of Peace.\"\r\n\r\n    'The selection meant in my mind that home was about to exist once\r\n    more for me.'\r\n\r\n    'In July, 1884, Mrs. Mark Pattison had been left a widow by the\r\n    death of the Rector of Lincoln College. She went to live at The\r\n    Lodge, Headington, near Oxford.\r\n\r\n    'Later in the year we became privately engaged, and told Mr. and\r\n    Mrs. Frank Pattison, Mrs. Westlake, Mrs. Earle, and Mrs. Grant Duff,\r\n    as well as Chamberlain, but no one else. It was decided that others\r\n    should not be told until much later, and to Lord Granville, who\r\n    (without mentioning a name) congratulated me, I had to feign\r\n    ignorance of what he meant. Mrs. Pattison settled to go to India in\r\n    February, March, or April, 1885, to stay with the Governor of Madras\r\n    and Mrs. Grant Duff in the hills, and to return in September or\r\n    October for our wedding, which before her departure was fixed for\r\n    October. Before the return there happened Emilia's typhoid fever at\r\n    Ootacamund, and our terrible misfortunes; but the date of October,\r\n    1885, was fated to remain the date, and Chamberlain, who had, before\r\n    Emilia left, consented to be best man, was best man still. The place\r\n    of the wedding alone was changed--from Christ Church Cathedral,\r\n    Oxford, to the parish church of Chelsea. Mrs. Grant Duff wrote to us\r\n    on being told a most pleasant letter.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote the best letter of his life to her.'\r\n\r\nThis was the letter:\r\n\r\n    '40, Prince's Gardens, S.W.,\r\n\r\n    'November 5th, 1884.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Mrs. Pattison,\r\n\r\n    'Dilke has told me his great secret, and I sympathize with him so\r\n    warmly in the new prospects of happiness which are opening for him\r\n    that I have asked leave to write to you and to offer my hearty\r\n    congratulations.\r\n\r\n    'I venture to think that we are already friends, and this adds\r\n    greatly to the pleasure which this intelligence has given me.\r\n\r\n    'For many years I have been on the most intimate terms with your\r\n    future husband; and while I share the general opinion of the world\r\n    as to his talents and force of character, I have better reason than\r\n    any other man to appreciate his generosity and goodness, and the\r\n    chivalrous delicacy which a natural reserve conceals from casual\r\n    acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    'I prize his friendship as the best gift of my public life, and I\r\n    rejoice unfeignedly that he will have a companion so well able to\r\n    share his noblest ambitions and to brighten his life.\r\n\r\n    'I know that you will forgive me this intrusion, which is justified\r\n    by the fact that next to yourself I am more interested than anyone\r\n    in the change which will bring so much happiness to my dear friend.\r\n\r\n    'Believe me always,\r\n\r\n    'Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n    'J. Chamberlain.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nDIVIDED COUNSELS\r\n\r\nJANUARY AND FEBRUARY, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1884 Mr. Gladstone's colleagues expected that he would\r\nresign, and it appears that he had really thought of doing so, provided\r\nthat a ministry could be formed under Lord Hartington's leadership.\r\nFranchise and Redistribution were virtually settled, and there was no\r\nlegislative proposal before either the Cabinet or the country on which\r\nLord Hartington was in marked disagreement with his colleagues. But they\r\nwere still 'an Egyptian Government,' and here differences seemed to be\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\n    'The Egyptian policy of the Government had now become thoroughly\r\n    unpopular, and those of us who, although we had favoured\r\n    intervention as necessary at the time, had deplored alike the\r\n    engagements of our predecessors which had made it necessary, and the\r\n    occupation which, unnecessarily in my opinion, followed it, were as\r\n    unpopular as were those like Hartington, and the majority of the\r\n    peers in the Cabinet, who had insisted not only on going, but on\r\n    staying--at least in Cairo. It is curious to reflect how\r\n    intervention in the East is judged by subsequent complications which\r\n    do not affect the principle. The intervention of 1860-61 in Syria\r\n    gave considerable popularity to the Government who agreed to it, and\r\n    to Lord Dufferin who conducted it on the spot; and it was as popular\r\n    in France which found the troops, as in England which found the man.\r\n    By that intervention Syria was pacified and war in the East\r\n    prevented, and ultimately it was followed by evacuation and\r\n    reversion to what diplomatists style in their jargon \"an improved\r\n    _status quo_.\"\r\n\r\n    'It is too often now (1891) forgotten that we actually proposed in\r\n    1884 to France (in connection with a Conference which took place,\r\n    obtaining therefore to some extent, it might be contended, valuable\r\n    consideration for our proposal) that we would, at or before the\r\n    expiration of our occupation, propose to the Powers and to the Porte\r\n    a scheme for the neutralization of Egypt on the basis of the\r\n    principles applied to Belgium. A document which we printed at the\r\n    beginning of 1885 gave our suggested wording for the neutralization\r\n    treaty, declaring that Egypt should be an independent and\r\n    perpetually neutral State under the guarantee of the contracting\r\n    parties; limiting the strength of the Egyptian army, the claim of\r\n    Turkey to military aid from Egypt, and so forth.'\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was not welcomed by the Powers.\r\n\r\n    'On New Year's Day I left Antibes for Paris, which I reached on\r\n    Friday, the 2nd January, and quitted for London on Saturday, the\r\n    3rd.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote to me that Mr. Gladstone was threatened with a\r\n    return of his illness, that he required rest, that Egypt had been\r\n    for the moment tided over, though it might at any moment break up\r\n    the Government. It had been decided to send a firm but courteous\r\n    despatch to France demanding immediate consideration of our\r\n    proposals, failing which we should \"take our own course.\"\r\n    Chamberlain, however, added, \"What that course is to be is the\r\n    question on which agreement appears impossible. It is 'scuttle and\r\n    bankruptcy' against 'protectorate and guarantee.' Sufficient unto\r\n    the day is the evil thereof.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was with Dilke and Chamberlain in opposing protectorate or\r\nguarantee in any shape. But there were other questions of Imperial\r\npolicy upon which the Imperialism of these two Ministers divided them\r\nfrom Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'New Guinea had also been discussed, and Chamberlain was for\r\n    demanding explanations from the Germans. Zululand had been\r\n    mentioned. Chamberlain supported the annexation of the coast of\r\n    Pondoland: Mr. Gladstone, with the support of Trevelyan, \"opposing\r\n    any attempt to anticipate Germany.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, January 4th, Chamberlain wrote again from Birmingham.\r\n    His letter shows that I was anxious for resignation on the Egyptian\r\n    question, and Chamberlain replied that he could not find a\r\n    satisfactory boat to leave the ship in, and that he thought that the\r\n    Government had more lives than a cat. Chamberlain added that he had\r\n    to speak on January 5th, and should find it difficult to steer\r\n    between Jingoism and peace-at-any-price.'\r\n\r\n    'He also was engaged in preparing a programme for the future to be\r\n    set forth at Ipswich. This last was the memorable \"Unauthorized\r\n    Programme.\"'\r\n\r\nA first instalment of this programme was given by Mr. Chamberlain in a\r\nspeech at Birmingham, which advocated restriction of game-preserving,\r\nprovision of land for agricultural labourers, and better housing. The\r\naccusations of Communism brought against Mr. Chamberlain began at this\r\npoint; and they, of course, redoubled after he had proposed on January\r\n10th at Ipswich to give local bodies power for compulsory acquisition of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Mr. Chamberlain was absent from London, and\r\ncommunicating only by letter with Sir Charles, whom he had not seen\r\nsince the middle of December, when Sir Charles crossed to Paris, on his\r\nway to Toulon; and before the unauthorized programme was launched Lord\r\nHartington contemplated forming a Government which would have given the\r\nforemost positions to Dilke and Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of January 5th Harcourt had told me that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone intended to resign, and that Lord Granville would follow\r\n    Mr. Gladstone, in which case Hartington intended to make him,\r\n    Harcourt, Chancellor, to move Lord Derby and Childers, to put in\r\n    Rosebery, [Footnote: As Secretary for the Colonies.] to offer\r\n    Chamberlain the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, and me the\r\n    Secretaryship of State for Foreign Affairs. But, great as were the\r\n    offices proposed, Chamberlain and I could not have consented to\r\n    remain in if Mr. Gladstone had gone out notoriously dissatisfied. If\r\n    he had gone out on grounds of health alone, it would, of course,\r\n    have been another matter.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter,\r\n\r\n    'probably of Monday morning, January 5th, Chamberlain said that Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's retirement was possible, and might be necessary; that\r\n    Hartington and Harcourt could bring it about; but that we must be\r\n    most careful not to allow them to say that we had been engaged in an\r\n    intrigue with them against Mr. Gladstone. He thought that we ought\r\n    to tell them frankly that we could enter into no negotiations with\r\n    them, and to put this in a Memorandum to which we could afterwards\r\n    appeal. On the other hand, he was willing to state his views as to\r\n    policy, provided all reference to personal questions was avoided. As\r\n    his Egyptian policy, he stated \"immediate bankruptcy, communication\r\n    to the Powers of our fixed intention to leave, declaration that we\r\n    would not allow intervention by other Powers in our place, and\r\n    Conference to settle details of neutralization.\" As to domestic\r\n    policy, he agreed in my suggestion that we should insist upon an\r\n    immediate Civil List Committee, and proposed an inquiry into labour.\r\n    He gave me leave to discuss his letter with Harcourt (\"the latter\r\n    has always been a most loyal friend, though he can not be expected\r\n    to agree with us in everything\"), and I did so before the Cabinet of\r\n    January 7th.'\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Chamberlain had come to London, and there is no\r\nindication that his speech at Birmingham had created friction. But the\r\nparty which wished to offer resistance to Germany's high-handed policy\r\nhad been strengthened by a new instance of usurpation.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone was absent from this Cabinet. The first matter\r\n    discussed was that of Samoa raised by me. There had been received on\r\n    the night of the 6th from the Governor of New Zealand a telegram\r\n    saying that the Germans had made a treaty giving the whole authority\r\n    of Government to the German Consul. While Münster had been telling\r\n    Lord Granville that Germany would take no step hostile to Samoan\r\n    independence, the Germans had sent warships there with secret\r\n    orders, and had hoisted their flag in various parts of the islands.\r\n    The next subject mentioned was that of Zanzibar, and it was decided\r\n    that we should warn Germany that we would not brook interference\r\n    there. At the same time I had much doubt whether Lord Granville\r\n    would act upon the instructions of the Cabinet in this matter, and\r\n    my doubts were justified. The third matter was that of the Pondo\r\n    coast, and also the coast of Zululand. Mr. Gladstone alone objecting\r\n    to a protectorate and being absent, it was decided to have one.'\r\n\r\n    'Then came the old question of sending troops to Suakim; [Footnote:\r\n    Colonial troops were offered about this time, and the Diary contains\r\n    the entry, February 20th: \"The sending of a Colonial force to\r\n    Suakim. Hartington and Derby had snubbed the Colonists, and were\r\n    snubbed by the Cabinet in consequence.\"] then that of Egyptian\r\n    Finance, on which Harcourt broached his scheme by which the United\r\n    Kingdom was to pay the difference caused by a reduction of the rate\r\n    of interest, to which scheme Chamberlain and I were opposed. We were\r\n    informed that the Queen \"most strongly protested against our binding\r\n    ourselves to leave Egypt.\"'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Radicals in the Cabinet considered their concerted action\r\nin view of a change of leadership.\r\n\r\n    'We settled during the Cabinet that Trevelyan, Chamberlain, and I\r\n    should meet at my room at the Local Government Board, directly the\r\n    Cabinet was over, to discuss the terms on which we would join a\r\n    Hartington administration; and we did so, finding Egypt and my\r\n    proposed inquiry into the Civil List the only real difficulties. The\r\n    Civil List could be got over, as it was certain that the Whigs would\r\n    give in to pressure from us upon this point. But Harcourt had\r\n    informed us that our Egyptian policy made the formation of a\r\n    Government impossible, as Hartington would not consent to accept\r\n    office on our Egyptian policy.'\r\n\r\nIt was very difficult to come to an agreement about Egypt. Lord Derby\r\nhad declared that the only alternatives were guaranteed neutrality or\r\nannexation. Dilke and Chamberlain stood for the former, considering\r\ntheir duty done if they prevented occupation by any other European\r\nPower, and took steps to establish internal order--which meant\r\ncompleting the organization of an Egyptian army. There was a third\r\npolicy; for Lord Hartington, who repeatedly in public repudiated the\r\nidea of annexation, insisted upon the retention of a single control\r\nduring a prolonged occupation. In this he had the strongest backing from\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain at our meeting added a fresh proviso--namely, that\r\n    Parnell or some other Irishman should be Chief Secretary. I\r\n    afterwards informed Harcourt of Chamberlain's views, adding that\r\n    Chamberlain was willing to avoid all personal questions, although he\r\n    much wished that John Morley should be in the Cabinet, [Footnote:\r\n    Sir Charles had noted his own strong wish to this effect in the\r\n    previous year.] that he wholly rejected Harcourt's plan for Egypt as\r\n    being a bribe to buy off the Powers, forced on us by unworthy fears.\r\n    Chamberlain wished, if his own Egyptian policy was not adopted, to\r\n    simply evacuate the country.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain, I was empowered to say, had also mentioned the English\r\n    land question, and was opposed to allowing Lord Salisbury to come\r\n    in,' as this, he said to Sir Charles, 'would surely be a hopeless\r\n    confession of weakness, and give him a chance with the new electors.\r\n\r\n    'I argued against Chamberlain's Egyptian policy, not on the merits,\r\n    but on the chances of our getting our own way.\r\n\r\n    '\"I doubt our getting our way as to bankruptcy, and am not sure that\r\n    we ought to put that forward as sole or chief cause for not joining\r\n    Hartington.\" To this Chamberlain replied: \"True. But how can we join\r\n    another Government without any settled policy about Egypt?\r\n    Harcourt's alternative is impossible; then what is there? I should\r\n    refuse to join Hartington unless we can agree as to Egypt policy,\r\n    and if we do agree, there can in that case be no reason for letting\r\n    Salisbury in.\"'\r\n\r\nEgypt was in Sir Charles's view the main, but not the only, difficulty.\r\nThe Government policy of 'lying down to Germany' was another. At the\r\nsame date:\r\n\r\n    'January 7th, Chamberlain and I had a conference with regard to\r\n    Samoa, in which I pointed out that if we quarrelled with France\r\n    about Egypt she would have all Europe behind her, whereas in our\r\n    dealings with Germany about Samoa, Zanzibar, and other matters,\r\n    Germany would stand alone.' [Footnote: A letter to Lord Hartington\r\n    from his secretary, Mr. Brett, which is quoted by Mr. Bernard\r\n    Holland (_Life of Duke of Devonshire_, vol. ii, pp. 38, 39),\r\n    suggests that the Hartington section had difficulty in reconciling\r\n    Sir Charles's attitude on other Imperial matters with his Egyptian\r\n    policy: \"It would indeed be a farce, after all the fuss about the\r\n    Cameroons and Angra Pequena, to allow Suakim, which is the port of\r\n    Khartoum, and the Nile to pass into the hands of foreigners.\" The\r\n    answer is, first, that Sir Charles would certainly never have\r\n    consented to let any port in Egypt or the Soudan pass into the hands\r\n    of any European Power: his proposal was neutralization of Egypt\r\n    under international guarantee; and, secondly, that the questions\r\n    were governed by different conditions, which he set out in\r\n    conference with Mr. Chamberlain about Samoa.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 'I had decided that if I resigned, or if I refused to join\r\na Hartington administration, I should mention four subjects--Egypt,\r\nSamoa, Zanzibar, and (probably) the Civil List inquiry (if I were not\r\ncompletely satisfied). On the same day I was at work on our draft\r\ndespatch to Sir Edward Malet as to Zanzibar, which had been settled on\r\nthe 8th after the Cabinet of the 7th, but which did not go off until the\r\n14th. On January 14th I noted in my Diary, \"The Zanzibar despatch went.\r\nSeven days' delay. I know that two days' delay was caused by the\r\nnecessity of sending to Osborne and to the Prime Minister, but why seven\r\ndays?\"\r\n\r\n    'On January 21st the first matter discussed was that of New Guinea,\r\n    in which we found ourselves in difficulties caused by absence of\r\n    jurisdiction over foreigners, and we agreed in consequence to\r\n    annexation.'\r\n\r\nThe situation with Germany was undoubtedly grave, but ought not, Sir\r\nCharles maintained, to entail the sacrifice of Zanzibar. On February\r\n24th Count Münster, the German Ambassador, told Mr. Alfred de Rothschild\r\nthat he expected to be withdrawn, but that New Guinea was the only\r\nserious matter in dispute.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, February 24th, I breakfasted at Alfred de Rothschild's\r\n    house, to meet the German Ambassador, Count Münster, at the latter's\r\n    wish. Alfred de Rothschild did not sit down with us, and we were\r\n    _tête-à-tête_. Münster was very free in his remarks about Bismarck.\r\n    \"No one ever contradicts him.\" \"He sees none but flatterers.\" \"His\r\n    life is a period to be got through.\"'\r\n\r\nTwo March entries are apposite here:\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, March 4th, Rosebery wrote to me to ask me to dine\r\n    with him to meet \"Herbert Bismarck,\" who had suddenly arrived, but I\r\n    was engaged to the Speaker's dinner, and had to put off seeing young\r\n    Bismarck till Thursday, the 5th. He had come over to try to force us\r\n    to dismiss Lord Granville and Lord Derby. I noted in my Diary:\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Charles's Diaries, to portions of which certain\r\n    biographers had access, are at this point quoted by Lord Edmond\r\n    Fitzmaurice in his _Life of Lord Granville_, vol. ii., p. 430. The\r\n    passage runs: \"Negotiations with Germany on the vexed colonial\r\n    questions were meanwhile proceeding, more particularly with regard\r\n    to New Guinea. Sir Julian Pauncefote proposed a plan which it was\r\n    hoped might satisfy the German Chancellor, and Count Herbert\r\n    Bismarck reappeared as co-negotiator with Count Münster in London.\r\n    Lord Rosebery, who had just joined the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal,\r\n    also took part in the negotiations. 'Herbert Bismarck came over\r\n    again,' Sir Charles Dilke noted; 'if at his former visit he had only\r\n    tried to get us to dismiss Lord Derby, on this occasion he wanted us\r\n    to dismiss Lord Granville and Lord Derby.'\"] \"He puts us in a\r\n    difficult position as individuals, for how can we say to this\r\n    personally friendly fellow that we do not think Lord Granville's\r\n    speech in the Lords on Friday foolish, or how say that we think that\r\n    the allusion to old Bismarck's dislike of Münster in a recent\r\n    despatch from Malet ought to have been published.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, March 6th, I saw Herbert Bismarck again twice.... I\r\n    having expressed anxiety about Zanzibar, he told me that his father\r\n    had directed him to say that he \"considered Zanzibar as independent\r\n    as Turkey or Russia.\" It is to my mind shameful that, after this,\r\n    Lord Granville should have begun and Lord Salisbury have rapidly\r\n    completed arrangements by which the Zanzibar mainland, the whole\r\n    trade of which was in our hands, was handed over to Germany.'\r\n\r\n    'On March 7th we discussed Herbert Bismarck's views on the\r\n    Cameroons, on German claims in New Guinea (on this head we settled\r\n    with him), and on Pondoland.'\r\n\r\nWhile the difficulties with Germany were being discussed, differences as\r\nto Egyptian policy and our relations with France continued.\r\n\r\nOn January 20th, Egypt once more threatened to break up the Government.\r\nFrance had proposed an international Commission of Inquiry into the\r\nfinancial situation.\r\n\r\n    'We discussed a French proposal which, as I wrote to the Chancellor,\r\n    had at least one advantage--namely, \"that it re-forms the majority\r\n    in the Cabinet by uniting two of the three parties--yours and mine.\"\r\n    Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville, Kimberley, Derby, Harcourt, the\r\n    Chancellor, Trevelyan, and Dilke, eight in all, supported taking the\r\n    new French proposals as a basis. Chamberlain was absent ill.\r\n    Northbrook, Hartington, Childers, to my astonishment, and\r\n    Carlingford were against us. After the Cabinet Hartington wrote to\r\n    Mr. Gladstone to say that he \"could not accept the decision,\" and\r\n    Northbrook supported him.' Next day, however, 'when we turned to\r\n    Egyptian finance, Trevelyan went over from our side to the other.\r\n    Mr. Gladstone announced that what we had decided on the previous day\r\n    was not to prevent our arguing against the French proposed inquiry,\r\n    and thus Hartington was kept in.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 23rd I forwarded to Chamberlain a letter from\r\n    Sandringham, which showed that the Queen had been alarmed at the\r\n    possibility that my proposed Civil List inquiry might affect not\r\n    only new grants, but also the Civil List arrangements made at the\r\n    beginning of the reign. Chamberlain made a Delphic reply that, on\r\n    the one hand, inquiry would be a farce if it did not include the\r\n    existing Civil List, but that on the other hand there could be no\r\n    intention to make any change in the arrangements with the Queen.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 28th, I heard from Sandringham that the Prince of Wales\r\n    was going to Osborne the next day, and would broach to the Queen his\r\n    friendliness to the idea of a new settlement of the Civil List.\r\n    Chamberlain was anxious that no difficulty should be made by us on\r\n    the occasion of the marriage of Princess Beatrice. He wrote: \"_If\r\n    alone_, I should wait for something or somebody to turn up. Before\r\n    Prince Edward wants an allowance who knows what may happen? But I am\r\n    perfectly ready to follow your lead or to lead to your prompting.\"'\r\n\r\nAll arrangements were being made on the assumption that Lord Hartington\r\nwould become Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n    'I had been left by Mr. Gladstone in a certain doubt as to whether I\r\n    was to be completely responsible for the Redistribution Bill, or\r\n    whether Hartington was to share the responsibility. I wrote to\r\n    Hartington: \"Mr. Gladstone sends me everything on Redistribution,\r\n    and expresses no opinion of his own. Northcote and Salisbury write\r\n    to me only, and the whole thing is more and more in my hands. If I\r\n    let things drift, it is clear that I shall practically have sole\r\n    charge of the Bill, for no one else will know anything about it. I\r\n    do not shrink from this at all. It is work I like. But, as you will\r\n    probably be called on to form an Administration immediately after\r\n    the passing of the Bill, don't you think it would look well, and\r\n    that our people and the Press and the country would like it, if you\r\n    were to take charge of the Bill? If so, I had better have two or\r\n    three days' work at it with you.\"\r\n\r\n    'Hartington had asked me to stay with him at Hardwick to talk it\r\n    over, but it was only a Saturday to Monday visit from January 10th\r\n    to 12th, and there were many people in the house, and our whole\r\n    conversation was but very short; and Hartington continued to show\r\n    but little desire to work at the detail, and the Bill could only be\r\n    handled by those who knew its detail.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the Opposition leaders had accepted the compact, it was at this\r\ntime quite uncertain whether the House of Commons would consent to the\r\nRedistribution scheme--affecting as it did the interests of every\r\nmember. The Fourth Party had not been consulted in the arrangement, and\r\ninevitable friction followed.\r\n\r\n    'On January 27th I had a correspondence with Northcote in reference\r\n    to some mischief which had been made by Randolph Churchill.\r\n    Northcote had been told by the Conservative Chief Whip, \"Dilke told\r\n    Randolph that the Government would have given more grouping if we\r\n    had pressed for it.\" The Conservative party being angry at the\r\n    absence of grouping of the boroughs, Northcote had taken up the\r\n    point, but he now wrote: \"Whatever Churchill said must have been in\r\n    the nature of an inference of his own from what had previously\r\n    passed, from which he had probably gathered that the Government were\r\n    ready to concede grouping.\" But there was a lady in the case who had\r\n    gossiped about what Northcote had said to her, and he promised to\r\n    write to the offender.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 13th Mr. Gladstone wrote as to the Redistribution Bill:\r\n    \"The difficulty as I see it about communication with Northcote is\r\n    that he seems to have little weight of influence, and to be afraid\r\n    or unwilling to assume any responsibility. I have usually found him\r\n    reasonable in his own views, but obliged to reserve his judgment\r\n    until after consulting his friends, which consultations I have found\r\n    always to end badly. On the other hand, it is, of course, necessary\r\n    to pay him due respect. What may prove to be best under these\r\n    circumstances is--(1) not to be bound always to consult HIM, (2) to\r\n    consult him freely on the easier and smaller matters, but (3) in a\r\n    stiff question, such as the numbers of the House may prove to be, to\r\n    get at Salisbury if possible, under whose wing Northcote will, I\r\n    think, mostly be content to walk, (4) Or, if Salisbury cannot be got\r\n    alone, then Northcote and Salisbury would be far preferable to\r\n    Northcote alone.\"'\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties had to be met by Sir Charles. When the Bill\r\nactually came before the House, 'Mr. Gladstone instructed James to\r\nassist me in the conduct of it. But practically I had it to myself.'\r\nLord Hartington had rendered invaluable service in the preliminary\r\nnegotiations. But for such laborious work of detail as was needed to\r\ncarry through this Bill, neither temperament nor surroundings had fitted\r\nhim. His Hardwick home is thus described by Sir Charles in a letter\r\nwhich he wrote to Mrs. Pattison:\r\n\r\n    'I am writing in my bedroom, which is--bed and all--that of Mary\r\n    Queen of Scots, who was the prisoner of Bess of Hardwick. It is a\r\n    wonderful house, indeed--enormous, and yet completely covered with\r\n    the tapestry and the pictures of the time.... The casement windows\r\n    have never been touched since Queen Elizabeth was here, and are\r\n    enormous. (There is a local proverb which speaks of the hall as \"all\r\n    window and no wall.\") The result is that, in spite of heavy hanging\r\n    curtains, the candles are blown out if you go near the windows....\r\n    The portrait of the first Cavendish--who was usher of Cardinal\r\n    Wolsey, and who married Bess of Hardwick, the richest lady of the\r\n    day--is exactly like Hartington, but a vulgar Hartington--fat and\r\n    greasy--a Hartington who might have kept a public-house.'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain wrote to Sir Charles at Hardwick concerning his host:\r\n\r\n    'The true Whig tradition is to keep abreast of the movement which\r\n    they would willingly restrain, and do nothing to quicken, but it is\r\n    difficult for a man of Hartington's temperament to make the\r\n    sacrifice of pride which these tactics require.'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain's Ipswich speech had made its mark, and Sir Charles\r\nnotes 'the beginning of the terror caused by the unauthorized programme'\r\nin 'a letter which I received from Lord Salisbury, who was at Florence,\r\nas to my draft Report of the Housing Commission.'\r\n\r\n    'Lord Salisbury had greatly changed his views since he had sketched\r\n    out socialistic proposals for me in his own hand. He now complained\r\n    of that which I had said on \"the burning questions of expropriation,\r\n    betterment, and land tenure,\" and thought that Chamberlain's\r\n    evidence had affected the report, and that such views \"must now be\r\n    considered in the light of the doctrines as to land he has recently\r\n    laid down.\"'\r\n\r\nThat letter, received on January 30th, must have been written two days\r\nearlier, and evidently at that moment there were plans of forming an\r\nadministration which should exclude the Radicals.\r\n\r\n    'On January 28th Harcourt told me that he had stopped the Queen\r\n    deciding to send for Goschen to form a Whig Ministry if we were\r\n    beaten or if Mr. Gladstone resigned by telling her that Goschen\r\n    would refuse, or that, if he consented, no one would join him.'\r\n\r\nOn January 29th, at Birmingham, Mr. Chamberlain made reply to his\r\ncritics in a speech which added to the Ipswich programme manhood\r\nsuffrage and payment of members, and which further declared that the\r\nsanctity of public property far exceeded that of private property. If\r\nland, for instance, had been 'lost or wasted or stolen,' some equivalent\r\nfor it must be found, and some compensation exacted from the wrongdoers.\r\n[Footnote: 'The ransom theory,' afterwards alluded to (see Chapter\r\nXLIV., p. 182).]\r\n\r\nThese utterances from a member of the Cabinet were not likely to pass\r\nunchallenged.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, February 2nd, Chamberlain telegraphed to me that he was\r\n    coming up on the next day, Tuesday, the 3rd, on purpose to see me on\r\n    an important matter; and on the morning of the 3rd I received in a\r\n    secret box the letters about which he was coming. There was one from\r\n    Mr. Gladstone complaining of the unauthorized programme, and a draft\r\n    proposed reply, and Chamberlain added: \"Take them (Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    letters and enclosures from the Whigs) in connection with the\r\n    _Times_ articles. There is to be a dead set evidently.... There are\r\n    three possibilities. (1) Mr. Gladstone may wish me to resign. (2) A\r\n    vote of censure may be proposed in the House of Commons and carried.\r\n    (3) Mr. Gladstone may defend me, and in so doing may to all intents\r\n    and purposes censure me in such a way as to entail my resignation.\r\n    The first would not, I think, do me any harm. The second would do me\r\n    good. The third would not be pleasant. My object in proposed reply\r\n    is to make Mr. G. speak more plainly, and to let me know where I\r\n    stand. I have spoken in the first person because (until I see you) I\r\n    have no right to assume that you will accept a joint responsibility.\r\n    But I think you will, and then if we go out or are forced out there\r\n    will be a devil of a row. I have been speaking to Schnadhorst to-day\r\n    on the possibility. He says (you must take the opinion for what it\r\n    is worth) that it would strengthen us in the country.... I assume\r\n    Trevelyan would go with Mr. G.... I shall want to know what you\r\n    think of it all, and whether you have any alterations to propose in\r\n    the reply.\"\r\n\r\n    'I noted: \"I, of course, make common cause. The Whigs want to force\r\n    him into a row with Mr. G., who, they think, will break him in place\r\n    of his breaking Hartington after Mr. G. is gone.\" I admitted to\r\n    Chamberlain when we met on February 3rd that there was, as he said,\r\n    a dead set at him, and that the _Pall Mall_ for a wonder was backing\r\n    it up. On his first point I was sure that Mr. Gladstone did not wish\r\n    for his resignation, and knew that I should go too. On the second, I\r\n    doubted any member being ready to bell the cat; and on the third\r\n    point I was sure that Mr. Gladstone's defence of Chamberlain would\r\n    not be such as to entail his resignation.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles thought, and told Chamberlain, that the object of the Whigs\r\nwas to force them 'to war with Mr. G. who is strong, and not with\r\nHartington,' against whom the Radicals would hold winning cards. 'We\r\ntherefore play into their hands by going NOW.' Meanwhile, he took up a\r\nfighting attitude towards the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n    'I had written to Mr. Gladstone very strongly backing up\r\n    Chamberlain's right to express his individual opinion upon the\r\n    questions of the future, and pointing out his patience in not\r\n    repudiating some of Hartington's remarks, and saying that I could\r\n    not let him go out alone.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 4th I heard from Chamberlain ... thanking me for\r\n    getting Carrington, who represented my Department in the Lords, to\r\n    make a pro-Chamberlain speech.'\r\n\r\nThis was the more valuable because the whole Press was against the\r\n\"unauthorized programme.\" At the same time, Sir Charles did not fail to\r\npoint out that their position was an unsound one, writing first:\r\n\r\n    'Our words as to the future are too wide. They would cover my\r\n    preaching a Republic for two years hence, or your preaching the\r\n    nationalization of land without compensation for the next\r\n    Parliament.'\r\n\r\nHe urged also that the precedent which Mr. Chamberlain sought to\r\nestablish was two-edged.\r\n\r\nFebruary 5th, 'At night I gave Chamberlain a hint that some day others\r\nmight turn against him that freedom of speech which he claimed as\r\nagainst Hartington; and he prepared a document which, under the form of\r\nstanding out for full right of free speech, really yielded the whole\r\npoint. He covered his retreat with great skill, and the document as\r\ncorrected by me would be valuable if it could be found. I have no copy,\r\nbut have memoranda which passed between us, in one of which I begged him\r\nto keep the draft with my corrections as representing our joint view,\r\ninasmuch as it might be important in the future. Chamberlain notes, in a\r\nminute which I have, his acceptance of the general doctrine, with a\r\ndeclaration that the present was an exceptional period; that there was a\r\nnew departure under the franchise reform, that it was essential to give\r\na general direction to the discussion, that his actual proposals were\r\nmoderate, and such as only to point to, firstly, a revision of taxation\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone himself had advocated, details being open, but the\r\nprinciple being to secure equality of sacrifice; secondly, the extension\r\nof power of local authorities on lines already conceded in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThe two allies were fighting a hard fight at a critical moment. At such\r\ntimes even the closest friends naturally seek to reassure each other,\r\nand to a letter from Sir Charles Mr. Chamberlain made this reply,\r\nJanuary 11th:\r\n\r\n    'The malice and ingenuity of men is so great that I should be afraid\r\n    they would some day break our friendship if it had not victoriously\r\n    stood the strain of public life for so many years. I will swear that\r\n    I will never do anything knowingly to imperil it, and I hope that we\r\n    are both agreed that if by any chance either of us should think that\r\n    he has the slightest cause of complaint he will not keep it to\r\n    himself for a day, but will have a frank explanation. In this case I\r\n    shall feel safe, for I am certain that any mistake would be\r\n    immediately repaired by whoever might be in fault.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF KHARTOUM AND THE PENJDEH INCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of Thursday, February 5th, 1885, at 3 a.m., Brett\r\n    went to Lord Granville with the news of the fall of Khartoum. He\r\n    used to tell how he had been wholly unable to find the old\r\n    gentleman, and how the servants had ultimately asserted that their\r\n    master was at Walmer--which he was not. At the same hour the news\r\n    was sold by a War Office messenger to one of the News Agencies. The\r\n    resident clerk at the War Office had written to Thompson, of the War\r\n    Office, in an unsealed envelope, instead of putting the despatch\r\n    into a box. It did not matter much on this occasion, but it might\r\n    matter in a great European war. A Cabinet was immediately summoned\r\n    for the next day. [Footnote: The following correspondence between\r\n    Mr. Brett (now Viscount Eslier) and Sir Charles throws light on the\r\n    summoning of the Cabinet:\r\n\r\n    War Office,\r\n\r\n    Thursday morning, 3 a.m.\r\n\r\n    Here is some bad news.\r\n\r\n    No Ministers in town, except you and Chamberlain!\r\n\r\n    Have tried Lord G. and Lord Northbrook.

C.\r\n\r\n    Local Government Board,\r\n\r\n    February 5th, 1885.\r\n\r\n    It is absurd not to make them come up _to-day_ in face of Wolseley's\r\n    \"_It is most essential that I shall have the earliest possible\r\n    decision._\"] Only three subjects were discussed: Khartoum, secrecy,\r\n    and the question of the Italians as against the Turks in the Red\r\n    Sea.'\r\n\r\nOn February 7th, 'The next matter was Wolseley, who had confused us by\r\ngreatly varying his statements.... Next came a proposal that Gordon\r\nshould be bought from the Mahdi.'\r\n\r\n    'On February 9th Mr. Gladstone mentioned his intention to bring in\r\n    Rosebery and Lefevre as members of the Cabinet. It was decided that\r\n    the Italians should be allowed to go to Kassala--a decision which\r\n    was afterwards reversed. The French views on Egyptian finance were\r\n    named, the despatch of Indian troops to Suakim again discussed.\r\n    Wolseley having asked that General Greaves should be sent to Suakim,\r\n    Childers said that the Queen and Duke of Cambridge had stopped that\r\n    officer's promotion because he \"belonged to the Ashantee gang\"\r\n    (Wolseley's friends), and that the Duke had now complained that he\r\n    did not know him. Chamberlain proposed that we should invite the\r\n    Canadian Government to send a force to Suakim; and, finally,\r\n    Childers was allowed to mention finance, which had been the object\r\n    for which the Cabinet was called.\r\n\r\n    'On February 10th I wrote to Chamberlain that Rosebery and Lefevre\r\n    would help the Cabinet with the public, but would weaken us in the\r\n    Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'On February 11th there was another Cabinet, five members being\r\n    absent--namely, the Chancellor, Carlingford, Spencer, Chamberlain,\r\n    and Trevelyan--owing to the suddenness of the call. It was on the\r\n    Suakim command, Mr. Gladstone being very obstinate for Greaves, as\r\n    against Graham with Greaves for Chief of Staff--a compromise. I\r\n    supported Hartington--I do not know why--and we beat Mr. Gladstone\r\n    by 5 to 4. Both officers were inferior men, and Graham did but\r\n    badly. Probably Greaves would have done no better....\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone complained that he and Hartington had received at\r\n    Carnforth on the 5th a disagreeable telegram _en clair_ from the\r\n    Queen, and Mr. Gladstone was very anxious to know whether the Tories\r\n    had found it out, asking anxiously, \"What are the station-master's\r\n    politics?\"\r\n\r\n    'February 13th ... I was with Harcourt when Rosebery came to be\r\n    sworn in, so I took the opportunity of making Rosebery help us to\r\n    make Lord Derby uncomfortable for proposing to refuse the troops\r\n    offered by the colony of New South Wales.\r\n\r\n    'We began to discuss our Soudan policy with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n    'Courtney and Morley had insisted in private letters that we should\r\n    only rescue, and not attack the rebels, and the _Times_ agreed with\r\n    them--unless we intended to stay in the country and establish a\r\n    Government. Wolseley's policy would be represented as one of \"smash\r\n    and retire,\" and it was for this reason that Chamberlain pressed\r\n    negotiations with the Mahdi, as he thought we should be stronger if\r\n    we could show that the Mahdi had rejected a fair offer. It was on\r\n    February 13th that Hartington most strongly pressed his proposal for\r\n    the Suakim railroad, and invited me to be a member of a Cabinet\r\n    Committee to consider the proposal.'\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, February 16th, the first matter discussed was the\r\n    Russian answer as regards Egyptian finance. The Soudan was put off\r\n    till the next day, Chamberlain making a strong speech first upon our\r\n    policy. Hartington asked for five million, to include the cost of\r\n    his Suakim-Berber railway, and for leave to call out reserves.\r\n\r\n    'On February 19th I had an interview with Mr. Gladstone, and found\r\n    him anxious to be turned out on the vote of censure. Indeed, he was\r\n    longing for it, in the firm belief that, if turned out, he would\r\n    come back after the dissolution in November, while, if not turned\r\n    out, he would be more likely to be beaten.\r\n\r\n    'On February 20th the subjects discussed were Egypt (Finance and\r\n    Suez Canal) and the sending a colonial force to Suakim. Chamberlain\r\n    had developed to Childers at the same meeting a proposal that\r\n    Hartington should form a Ministry to carry on the Soudan War, with\r\n    the loyal support of those of us who went out with Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'On February 25th, Goschen having asked for assurances as to the\r\n    Berber railway, Chamberlain wrote to me saying that if Hartington\r\n    gave them, it might be a sufficient cause for our resignation, as we\r\n    were not prepared to commit the country to establishing settled\r\n    government in any part of the Soudan. Chamberlain proposed that we\r\n    should resign before the division, and that the Government being\r\n    beaten, there should then be brought about the establishment of what\r\n    he called the combination or patriotic Government, which meant a\r\n    Hartington administration. I, on the whole, preferred to go on as we\r\n    were, so I stopped a box of Hartington's which was going round the\r\n    Cabinet, and proposed an alteration of form which prevented\r\n    Chamberlain going out on these assurances.\r\n\r\n    'During the debate I went away to dine, and, not having heard the\r\n    middle of Harcourt's speech, asked Chamberlain whether Harcourt had\r\n    tried to answer any of Goschen's questions, to which Chamberlain\r\n    answered, \"Not one. He asked questions in turn,\" which is a good\r\n    description of Harcourt's style. I then wrote on a slip of paper,\r\n    \"Forster is taking notes\"; and Chamberlain replied, \"Forster--\r\n    against slavery, against Zebehr, [Footnote: Zebehr was arrested in\r\n    Cairo on the ground of treasonable correspondence with the Mahdi,\r\n    and interned at Gibraltar, but later was allowed to return to Cairo.\r\n    He died in January, 1903.] and of course generally in favour of a\r\n    crusade,\" a note which is also characteristic--of both these men.\r\n\r\n    'At four o'clock in the morning of February 28th, when we got our\r\n    majority of 14, after the first division, Mr. Gladstone, who wanted\r\n    to go out, said to Childers and myself, \"That will do.\" This was\r\n    indeed a Delphic utterance.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles himself spoke, at Mr. Gladstone's request, at great length\r\nin the third day's debate on February 26th, but it was 'only a debating\r\nspeech.'\r\n\r\n    'After we had had a sleep, we met in Cabinet on Saturday, February\r\n    28th. Lord Granville and Childers now anxious to go. Harcourt, who\r\n    had at night been against going, was now anxious to go. This was a\r\n    curious and interesting Cabinet. Lord Granville and Lord Derby, who\r\n    were at loggerheads both with Bismarck and with their colleagues,\r\n    were strong that we should resign, and they got some support from\r\n    Chamberlain, Northbrook, Childers, and Hartington. Lefevre,\r\n    [Footnote: Lord Eversley, then Mr. Shaw Lefevre, had joined the\r\n    Cabinet after the news from Khartoum. Lord Rosebery had accepted the\r\n    Privy Seal. Lord Eversley says that on February 28th opinions were\r\n    evenly divided, but that one member refused to express an opinion on\r\n    the ground of his recent admission. See, too, _Life of Granville_,\r\n    vol. ii., pp. 421-422.] who had only just come in, and Trevelyan\r\n    were strong for staying in, as was Carlingford; but the other\r\n    members of the Cabinet either wobbled backwards and forwards, or did\r\n    not care. At last it was decided by the casting vote of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, if one may use the phrase when there was no actual\r\n    voting, that we should try to go on at present so as to carry the\r\n    Seats Bill ourselves.\r\n\r\n    'We then turned to the Berber railway, and decided that it should be\r\n    a temporary or contractor's line made only so far as might be\r\n    necessary for purely military reasons. We then decided that Wolseley\r\n    should not be allowed to make himself Governor-General of the\r\n    Soudan.\r\n\r\n    'After the Cabinet Chamberlain and I continued our discussion as to\r\n    his strong wish to resign. I told him that I wanted to finish the\r\n    Seats Bill, that I thought Lord Salisbury might refuse or make\r\n    conditions with regard to coming in, that Mr. Gladstone would not\r\n    lead in opposition, and that we should seem to be driving him into\r\n    complete retirement, and I asked whether we were justified in\r\n    running away.'\r\n\r\nMeantime the financial business of the year had to go on, and part of it\r\nwas a demand for increased naval expenditure, to which, as has been seen\r\nalready, Mr. Gladstone was opposed.\r\n\r\n    'The Navy Estimates were first discussed, and then the Army, and a\r\n    sum asked for for the fortification of coaling-stations was refused,\r\n    and also a sum asked for for defending the home merchant ports. We\r\n    all of us were guilty of unwise haste on this occasion, for the\r\n    demand was right; but the chief blame must fall rather on Childers,\r\n    Hartington, and the others who had been at the War Office than upon\r\n    those who sinned in ignorance.'\r\n\r\nThis decision against naval expenditure was a cause of embarrassment to\r\nthe Government in the country, for a strong 'big navy' campaign\r\nfollowed. The real question at issue in the Cabinet became that of\r\ntaxation. On March 2nd, and again in April, Sir Charles 'warned Mr.\r\nGladstone against Childers's proposed Budget'--the rock on which they\r\nfinally made shipwreck. 'Mr. Gladstone replied: \"The subject of your\r\nnote has weighed heavily on my mind, and I shall endeavour to be\r\nprepared for our meeting.\" I now sent him a memorandum after\r\nconsultation with Chamberlain.'\r\n\r\nWhat Sir Charles wrote in 1885 is nowadays matter of common argument; it\r\nwas novel then in the mouth of a practical politician:\r\n\r\n    'I stated at length that, as head of the Poor Law department, I\r\n    ought to have knowledge of the pressure of taxation upon the incomes\r\n    of the poor. As Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Housing of\r\n    the Working Classes, I had had to hear a great deal of evidence upon\r\n    the subject of the income of the working classes, and as Chairman of\r\n    the recent Conference on Industrial Remuneration had had special\r\n    opportunities of further examining the question. It was my opinion\r\n    that the position of the agricultural labourers had declined, and\r\n    that the Whig or Conservative minority on my Commission, represented\r\n    by Mr. Goschen and Lord Brownlow, admitted this contention of mine\r\n    as regarded the south of England. The labourers of the south were\r\n    unable to procure milk, and relied largely on beer as an article of\r\n    food. Their wages had but slightly increased in the twenty years\r\n    since 1865, and had decreased considerably since 1879. Food had\r\n    slightly risen in price, clothes were nominally cheaper, but the\r\n    same amount of wear for the money was not obtainable, and house rent\r\n    (where house rent was paid by the labourers) had greatly risen. An\r\n    enormous proportion of the income of the rich escaped taxation:\r\n    fifty millions a year of their foreign income at the least. The\r\n    uncertainty of employment placed the labourer even lower as a\r\n    partaker in the income of the country than the statisticians placed\r\n    him. The calculations of employers, upon which the estimates of\r\n    statisticians were based, were founded upon the higher earnings of\r\n    the best workers; and when the matter was examined, it was found\r\n    that variation of wages, loss of time, and failure of work, much\r\n    lowered the average earnings. The taxation of the working classes\r\n    rose to a higher percentage than that of the upper and middle\r\n    classes. Mr. Dudley Baxter, who was a Conservative, had admitted\r\n    this, and had advocated a reduction in the tobacco duty and the malt\r\n    tax. Since that time the tobacco duty had been raised, and the\r\n    duties pressing upon beer had been rather raised than lowered.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's insistence upon this matter is all the more notable\r\nbecause foreign complications were rapidly accumulating, and they were\r\nof a gravity which might well have seemed to dwarf all questions of the\r\nincidence of taxation.\r\n\r\nThere were not only the difficulties with Germany. There was also the\r\nSoudan, where a large body of British troops was engaged, in a country\r\nthe perils of which England had now to realize.\r\n\r\n    'On March 7th there was a Cabinet as to the Suakim-Berber railway.\r\n    Northbrook and I, soon joined by Harcourt and Chamberlain, were in\r\n    favour of stopping our impossible campaign. I argued that when we\r\n    decided to destroy the power of the Mahdi, it was on Wolseley's\r\n    telling us that he hoped possibly to take Khartoum at once. For some\r\n    weeks after that he had intended to take Berber. Then he had told us\r\n    that he at least could occupy Abu Hamed. Now he was in full retreat,\r\n    and both his lines of supply--namely, that up the Nile and that from\r\n    Suakim--seemed equally difficult. The Chancellor wrote on a slip of\r\n    paper for me: \"We seem to be fighting three enemies at once. (1) The\r\n    Mahdi; (2) certain of our people here; (3) Wolseley.\" Nothing was\r\n    settled, and we passed on to Egyptian finance.'\r\n\r\nMarch 11th, 'In the evening a despatch was circulated in which Wolseley\r\nsaid: \"Please tell Lord Granville that I cannot wait any longer, and I\r\nmust issue proclamation, and will do so on my own authority if I do not\r\nreceive answer to this by the 14th. I hope I may be allowed to issue it\r\nas Governor-General.\"\r\n\r\n    'I at once wrote, \"I understood that we had _decided_ that he was\r\n    not to be Governor-General, and that the proclamation should not be\r\n    issued in the terms proposed\"; on which Lord Granville wrote, \"Yes.\r\n    Cabinet to-morrow.--G.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, March 12th, the first matter discussed was that of the\r\n    arrest of Zebehr. Then came Wolseley's proclamation, which was\r\n    vetoed. We decided that he should not be allowed to make himself\r\n    Governor-General of the Soudan.'\r\n\r\nIt now seemed more than likely that the British Government would have\r\nwork on its hands which would render the employment of an army in the\r\nSoudan very undesirable; for more serious than the Mahdi's movements on\r\nthe Nile, more serious than the operations of German Admirals in the\r\nPacific, was the menace of a Russian advance upon Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nArrangements had been made for the demarcation of the Afghan frontier\r\nwhich Sir Charles had persistently urged. A British Commissioner had\r\nbeen appointed in July, 1884, but at the end of the following November\r\nRussia was still parleying on questions of detail. These, however,\r\nseemed to have been at length resolved; and in January, 1885, the\r\nBritish Commissioner was waiting in the neighbourhood of Herat for the\r\nRussian Commissioners to join in the work of fixing the boundaries. But\r\nthe Russians did not appear; they were, says Sir Charles, 'intriguing at\r\nPenjdeh, and preparing for the blow which later on they struck against\r\nthe Afghans.' The Amir evidently felt this, for he renewed the proposal\r\nthat he should pay a state visit to the Viceroy, and on January 23rd\r\nDilke wrote to Grant Duff that this had been accepted.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4th, 'On this day I received a letter from Sir Robert Sandeman\r\nat Quetta, in which he thanked me for the assistance that I had given\r\nhim in the retention of Sibi, Pishin, and the Khojak. \"It was greatly\r\ndue to your support of my representations on the subject that our\r\ninfluence on this frontier is at present all-powerful.\"'\r\n\r\nOn February 5th, a few hours after the fall of Khartoum was published,\r\n\r\n    'there was a meeting of Ministers as to Central Asia. We decided on\r\n    a reply to Russia drawn up by myself and Kimberley, Lord Granville\r\n    and Northbrook somewhat dissenting, and Fitzmaurice and Philip\r\n    Currie taking no part.\r\n\r\n    'On February 18th we had a meeting of the Central Asia Committee at\r\n    the Foreign Office with regard to the Russian advance in the\r\n    direction of Penjdeh, Lord Granville, Hartington, Northbrook,\r\n    Kimberley, myself, Fitzmaurice, and Currie. We ordered Sir Peter\r\n    Lumsden' (Chief of the Boundary Commission), 'in the event of a\r\n    Russian advance on Herat, to throw himself and escort into that\r\n    city, and to aid the Afghan defence.'\r\n\r\nOn March 12th, after deciding to limit Lord Wolseley's schemes in the\r\nSoudan, 'we took a decision that war preparations against Russia should\r\nbe made in India.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 20th we decided that if the Russians continued to advance,\r\n    20,000 troops should be concentrated at Quetta. We next gave\r\n    instructions to Lord Dufferin with regard to what he was to say to\r\n    the Amir of Afghanistan at the interview which was about to take\r\n    place between them, and authorized him to renew our guarantee. There\r\n    was either a regular or irregular Cabinet on March 24th. We decided\r\n    that if the Russians advanced upon Herat, the advance should be\r\n    treated as a _casus belli_, and orders to this effect were sent to\r\n    Dufferin. At the meeting on April 2nd the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin,\r\n    assured the Amir in the presence of his Prime Minister, of Mr.\r\n    Durand, and of Captain Talbot, \"that a Russian advance on Herat\r\n    should be met by war all over the world.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On April 8th, in public durbar, the Amir, without contradiction\r\n    from Lord Dufferin, said: \"The British Government has declared it\r\n    will assist me in repelling any foreign enemy.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was now discussing by letter with Sir Frederick Roberts the\r\nproposals which were preferred by the Defence Committee in India for the\r\ndefence of the North-West Frontier, with special emphasis on the further\r\nquestion whether there was any point at which England could strike at\r\nRussia. [Footnote: See Appendix following on this chapter, pp. 122,\r\n123.]\r\n\r\nEarly in April sittings of the Housing Commission in Scotland occasioned\r\nDilke's absence from a Cabinet at which important phases of the Central\r\nAsian question were discussed.\r\n\r\nApril 4th, 'Chamberlain wrote to me an account of all that passed,\r\npointing out that the Russian answer bade us \"give up everything, and\r\nthey offer us absolutely nothing by way of concession in return. This\r\nattitude really leaves us no alternative. I am very uncomfortable about\r\nit, because the more I study the matter the more I think that the\r\nRussians are right both in form and in substance--i.e., they have the\r\npretexts on their side, and they also have a strong argument in favour\r\nof their line, both on the matter of territorial right, and also on the\r\nground that this line is the only one which insures any chance of\r\npermanent peace. But we cannot have the pill forced down our throats by\r\nRussia without inquiry, or discussion on equal terms.... Harcourt\r\ndeclares that we have 'closed the door of Peace and opened the door of\r\nWar.' The only difference between us is that he is inclined to accept\r\nthe alternative of the Russian zone which has been already refused, and\r\nas to which the present Note says in effect that, though they are ready\r\nto go back to this zone, yet it will be of no use, as they are\r\ndetermined in the end to stick to their line.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, April 9th, there was a Cabinet, which I also missed,\r\n    and which considered the conflict at Penjdeh.' [Footnote: On March\r\n    20th, General Komarof with a Russian force had attacked and routed\r\n    an Afghan army in the valley of Penjdeh.]\r\n\r\nEvery day now had its Cabinet. On April 11th, 13th, and 14th evacuation\r\nof the Soudan was discussed, but Lord Hartington, by a threat of\r\nresignation, secured repeated postponements.\r\n\r\n    'This question was mixed up by some members of the Cabinet with that\r\n    of Afghanistan, inasmuch as they said that we could not fight Russia\r\n    in Afghanistan, and go on in the Soudan as well; upon which Mr.\r\n    Gladstone said of the Soudan, \"I am not prepared to go on upon any\r\n    terms, Russia or no Russia.\"\r\n\r\nA new trouble was added when the Egyptian Government suppressed the\r\n_Bosphore Égyptien_, a local paper published in French, and closed the\r\nprinting office. Against this the French protested, and in the course of\r\nthe quarrel actually broke off diplomatic relations with the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, which, considering the relations between that Ministry and\r\nthe protecting force of Great Britain, pushed unfriendliness very far.\r\nUltimately the _Bosphore_ was allowed to appear and to print what it\r\nchose, until it died a natural death.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, April 13th, came a proposal from the Russian Ambassador,\r\n    made through Lefevre and Brett, but which was really from Stead;\r\n    Brett meaning Stead. Curiously enough, it was a proposal of\r\n    Chamberlain's, of which he had previously told us, which had come\r\n    back to him in this way. Chamberlain consulted me as to whether he\r\n    should tell Mr. Gladstone that it was his, and I told him that I\r\n    thought he had better not, as I thought it was more likely to be\r\n    successful as coming from the Russian Ambassador and Stead than as\r\n    coming from him. It virtually amounted to the plan of Arbitration\r\n    which was ultimately adopted, although as a fact the Arbitration\r\n    never took place.'\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, 15th, there was an informal Cabinet, at which I was\r\n    not present, because the Seats Bill was in Committee in the House at\r\n    the same time. A form of words with regard to the Soudan was agreed\r\n    upon which united Hartington with the others.'\r\n\r\n    'On Thursday, the 16th, Mr. Gladstone misinformed the House of\r\n    Commons--the inevitable result from time to time of his habit of\r\n    answering without notice questions upon dangerous subjects. A\r\n    meeting had taken place between Lord Granville, Kimberley, and\r\n    Philip Currie on our side, and Staal, the Russian Ambassador, and\r\n    Lessar, the Russian expert, at which Lord Granville showed that we\r\n    meant to let Penjdeh go. Lessar paid a newspaper for its support by\r\n    telling them. Mr. Gladstone was asked, and replied that he knew\r\n    nothing about the matter, while he suggested that Penjdeh was not to\r\n    be given up.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 18th the Queen agreed to retirement from the Soudan, with\r\n    reservation of future liberty of action.' Whatever happened about\r\n    Penjdeh, it was certain that resistance would be offered to Russia.\r\n    'On this day, Monday, April 20th, there was a Cabinet, at which it\r\n    was decided to ask for eleven millions in the vote of credit. We\r\n    then discussed Lumsden's despatch of explanation as to the Penjdeh\r\n    incident, which we decided should be published. The vote of credit\r\n    was really partly for Russia and partly for the Soudan, and a\r\n    question arose whether it should be proposed as one or as two, and\r\n    we decided for one. After which we went back again to the Budget,\r\n    and the minority proposed a penny increase on the income tax as\r\n    against the increase on beer, after which the Budget was adjourned\r\n    to April 30th, it being decided then that the vote of credit should\r\n    be taken first.'\r\n\r\n    'On April 20th I received from the Communalist General Cluseret a\r\n    long letter in which he offered, on the ground of his profound\r\n    sympathy, his services to England against Russia in the event of\r\n    war--a document which would have done him little good had it seen\r\n    the light when he afterwards stood successfully for my electoral\r\n    division in the Var, at a time when French sympathy for Russia was\r\n    predominant.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, April 21st, after the Cabinet, I had told Mr. Gladstone\r\n    that I could not agree to the increase of the taxation on beer, and\r\n    Mr. Gladstone wrote to me twice on that day about the matter. I was\r\n    not very sure of Harcourt standing by us, and knew that the pressure\r\n    was great, inasmuch as, in addition to the two letters from Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, I received one from Edward Hamilton, also dated the 21st,\r\n    in which he made the strongest appeal to me on personal grounds not\r\n    to worry Mr. Gladstone by resignations. He said that Mr. Gladstone\r\n    was overburdened, and that it would take very little to break him\r\n    down. Edward Hamilton wrote: \"It is a peculiarity of his ... that,\r\n    while he can stand the strain of a grave political crisis such as a\r\n    question involving peace or war, he succumbs to the strain of a\r\n    personal question.... Mr. Gladstone, I know, feels that any\r\n    secession, especially of one who has a reputation not confined to\r\n    this country, would necessarily weaken greatly the Government, and\r\n    from a national point of view this is of all times a moment when\r\n    there ought to be a strong Government which can confront Europe and\r\n    face the varied difficulties. No one would more gladly escape from\r\n    office than Mr. G. himself; but the more attractive is the prospect\r\n    of freedom, the less does he dare allow himself to contemplate it.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote saying that such a secession at such a time would be\r\nserious for the Government, but also, he thought, serious for the\r\nseceder, and Sir Charles replied:\r\n\r\n  Local Government Board,\r\n    Whitehall,\r\n      April 21st, 1885.\r\n\r\n    'I should always let the consideration of what was due to my friends\r\n    weigh with me as much as any man, I feel sure, and I am also certain\r\n    that considerations of personal loyalty to yourself are as strong\r\n    with me now as they are with any member of the Cabinet. I should\r\n    never let the other class of considerations--i.e., those personal\r\n    to myself--weigh with me at all. Because I am fond of work I am\r\n    supposed to be ambitious; but I fancy few politicians are less so,\r\n    and I do not mind unpopularity, which, after all, generally rights\r\n    itself in the course of years. I knew that this matter would be a\r\n    very serious one before I went into it, and I should not have said\r\n    what I did had I not felt forced to do so.\r\n\r\n    'If others go with me, the extent of our unpopularity and consequent\r\n    loss of future usefulness will depend on our own conduct, and if we\r\n    do our duty by firmly supporting the Government through its foreign\r\n    and general difficulties, I do not think that even the party will be\r\n    ungenerous to us.'\r\n\r\nBut Sir Charles finally yielded, and drove a bargain.\r\n\r\n    'On April 24th I had decided at Chamberlain's strong wish to yield\r\n    to Childers as to the beer duty; Childers promising in return to\r\n    take the Princess Beatrice Committee of Inquiry demand upon himself.\r\n\r\n    'May 9th, the Queen now wished for immediate inquiry--that is, in\r\n    other words, preferred the Parliament she knew to the new\r\n    Parliament. The Government proposed \"next year.\" It was agreed that\r\n    the Government were to guide the Committee whenever it might sit,\r\n    and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be in the Chair.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone wrote me a letter to ease off my surrender on beer\r\n    duties, by pointing out the importance of the proposals which were\r\n    being made to put realty in the same position as personalty as to\r\n    Death Duties. \"This must in all likelihood lead to a very serious\r\n    struggle with the Tories, for it strikes at the very heart of\r\n    class-preference, which is the central point of what I call the\r\n    lower and what is now the prevalent Toryism.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the great debate of April 27th, in which Mr. Gladstone proposed a\r\nvote of credit for eleven millions, of which six and a half were for war\r\npreparation in view of the collision between the Afghans and Russians at\r\nPenjdeh,\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone made perhaps the most remarkable speech that even he\r\n    ever delivered, and I have his notes for it with a map I drew for\r\n    him before he spoke, to show him the position of the various places.\r\n    [Footnote: On this speech see the _Life of Gladstone_, vol. iii., p.\r\n    184; _Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p. 440.] At this time I wrote to\r\n    Hartington to suggest that if we were forced into war with Russia we\r\n    should attack the Russians at Vladivostock, and the Intelligence\r\n    Department wrote a memorandum upon the subject. I also sent round a\r\n    paper pointing out that we should fight at the greatest advantage\r\n    from a Pacific base, that the help of China would be of moment, and\r\n    that Chinese troops drilled and officered by Englishmen would be\r\n    irresistible; and Northbrook strongly backed me up. Lumsden was\r\n    sending us most violent telegrams, and while I was preparing for war\r\n    I was also asking for the recall of Lumsden in favour of Colonel\r\n    Stewart. Lord Granville wrote: \"Lumsden was a bad appointment, and I\r\n    for a moment wished to recall him. But it would be condemned here as\r\n    an immense knock-under.\" [Footnote: See the _Life of Granville_,\r\n    vol. ii., pp. 441, 442.] I also suggested that the engineers for\r\n    whom the Amir had asked should be carefully picked, and should have\r\n    a private Indian allowance for keeping us informed of what passed at\r\n    Kabul, and Lord Granville conveyed the suggestion by telegraph to\r\n    Lord Dufferin. (This was afterwards done.)'\r\n\r\nRussia unexpectedly withdrew.\r\n\r\n    'On May 2nd there was a sudden Cabinet on the Russian acceptance of\r\n    arbitration, Harcourt, Chamberlain, and Carlingford being absent.\r\n    Kimberley, the Chancellor, Northbrook, Derby, and I were for\r\n    immediate acceptance of the offer; Hartington against; Lord\r\n    Granville for amiably getting out of it; Trevelyan and Lefevre\r\n    silent; Rosebery late. Mr. Gladstone at first sided with Lord\r\n    Granville, then came half way to us, and then proposed that we\r\n    should wait a bit till Condie Stephen reached us. I replied by\r\n    showing that Condie Stephen was a Jingo, the friend of Drummond\r\n    Wolff and of Bowles of _Vanity Fair_, and would make things worse.\r\n    Then Mr. Gladstone came completely to our side. Childers drew up in\r\n    Cabinet the form for the declaration as to the Select Committee on\r\n    the Civil List, and I agreed to it. I wrote what had passed to\r\n    Chamberlain, who was at Birmingham, and he replied on the next day\r\n    that he trusted that the information about Russia would be\r\n    immediately communicated to the House, and went on: \"But, then, what\r\n    becomes of the vote of credit and the Budget? It seems cheeky to ask\r\n    for 6 1/2 millions of Preparations when the matter is practically\r\n    settled.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 7th the Herat boundary was discussed and a line settled, and\r\n    it was decided that either the German Emperor or the King of Denmark\r\n    should be named as the Arbitrator about Penjdeh.' Later, 'There was\r\n    a meeting of the Commons Ministers to discuss the situation created\r\n    by the refusal by Russia of the German Emperor as Arbitrator, the\r\n    Queen having previously refused the King of Denmark. The Queen had\r\n    ultimately to yield. But, as I have said, the arbitration, although\r\n    agreed on, never took place at all.'\r\n\r\nThe demarcation of frontier for which Sir Charles had so long contended\r\nwas carried through without any marked incident, largely owing to the\r\nskill of Sir J. West Ridgeway, who had succeeded Sir Peter Lumsden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Memoir gives the following account of the proposals made for defence\r\nof the North-West Frontier in India in the spring of 1885, and some\r\nobservations arising from them:\r\n\r\n    'The general idea was to hold the northern route by an entrenched\r\n    position, and, as regards the southern or flank road, to fortify the\r\n    mountains before Quetta. Roads and railways were to be made for\r\n    concentration in the direction of Kandahar, and Sir Frederick\r\n    Roberts afterwards very wisely noted, \"It is impossible to threaten\r\n    Russia's base, but we should do all in our power to keep it as far\r\n    away as possible.\" Unfortunately, Sir Frederick Roberts afterwards\r\n    forgot this, and suggested the possibility of advance upon Herat\r\n    with the view to attack Russia at her Sarakhs base. The suggestions\r\n    made in 1885 with regard to Kashmir and the Gromul Pass were acted\r\n    upon in 1890. Sir Donald Stewart, however, went on to recommend a\r\n    railway extension from Peshawur towards Kabul, and Sir Frederick\r\n    Roberts, with greater judgment, on succeeding him, vetoed this\r\n    scheme. Lord Kitchener revived it, but was not allowed to complete\r\n    his work. Sir Donald Stewart's committee recommended the tunnel at\r\n    the Khojak, which was carried out. Roberts reported against it, and\r\n    he was right.\r\n\r\n    'On the whole, when Sir Frederick Roberts sent me his view on the\r\n    defence proposals, I was struck with the contrast between the\r\n    completeness of the manner in which a defence scheme for India has\r\n    been considered, and the incompleteness, to say the least of it, of\r\n    all strategic plans at home. Sir Charles Macgregor put on record at\r\n    the same time his view that a mere offensive on the North-West\r\n    Frontier of India would be folly, if not madness, and that it would\r\n    be necessary also to undertake offensive operations against Russia.\r\n    Quite so, according to all rules of war, and if ultimate defeat is\r\n    to be avoided. Unfortunately, however, it is not easy to attack\r\n    Russia, and the proposals made by Sir Charles Macgregor would not\r\n    bear investigation. Sir Frederick Roberts himself afterwards tried\r\n    his hand at proposals of his own in a Memorandum entitled, \"What are\r\n    Russia's vulnerable points?\" But I do not know that he was more\r\n    successful, and I fear that his first question, \"Has Russia any\r\n    vulnerable points?\" must, if we are looking to permanency, and not\r\n    to merely temporary measures, be answered in the negative, except as\r\n    regards Vladivostock--a case I put. After much correspondence with\r\n    me on this last memorandum, Sir Frederick Roberts quoted me, without\r\n    naming me, as having, to his regret, informed him that English\r\n    public opinion would oppose a Turkish alliance, that a Turkish\r\n    alliance would not be of much use if we could obtain it, and that\r\n    apart even from these considerations we could not obtain it if we\r\n    wished.'\r\n\r\nThe importance which Sir Charles attached to Vladivostock, as the\r\nvulnerable point at which Russia could be attacked in time of war,\r\nexplains his regret when Port Hamilton, which threatened Vladivostock,\r\nwas abandoned. [Footnote: See _Life of Lord Granville_, vol. ii., p.\r\n440; and _Europe and the Far East_, by Sir Robert K. Douglas, pp. 190,\r\n248, 249.]\r\n\r\n    'May, 1885.--The Port Hamilton matter began about this time. We had\r\n    seized it, and, as Northbrook and I agreed, \"for naval reasons we\r\n    ought to keep it.\" Northbrook also wrote that he was laying a cable\r\n    from Shanghai to Port Hamilton, which he thought a most important\r\n    precaution in time of war; but Port Hamilton was afterwards given up\r\n    because the sailors found it dull--an insufficient reason.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nREDISTRIBUTION: COERCION AND DEVOLUTION\r\n\r\n1885\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe year 1885 saw the Seats Bill, with its numerous compromises in\r\ndetail, passed into law, but not without attendant difficulties.\r\n\r\n    'On Ash Wednesday, February 18th, I saw Sir Stafford Northcote, and\r\n    settled with him, in view of the meeting of the House on the next\r\n    day, the whole course of affairs for the 19th and 20th, under guise\r\n    of discussing details of the Seats Bill. After we had parted,\r\n    Northcote wrote to me that on consideration he had come to the\r\n    conclusion that he must give notice of a vote of censure, but our\r\n    amicable communication continued on the next day. \"On\r\n    consideration,\" with Northcote, always meant \"After bullying by\r\n    Randolph.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the process of settlement there were constant meetings with Lord\r\nSalisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote together, with Lord John Manners,\r\nwith Sir Michael Hicks Beach; while on the Conservative scheme for Irish\r\ngrouping\r\n\r\n    'I saw Healy for them, to discover if the thing could be done by\r\n    general consent; and, although Healy did not oppose right out, the\r\n    prospect of an agreement on details was far from promising. Healy\r\n    and I took the opportunity to discuss the Parnell-Chamberlain Irish\r\n    National Board scheme, of which I had written to Grant Duff on\r\n    January 23rd, \"Chamberlain has a grand scheme for an Irish Board.\"'\r\n\r\nMarch 6th.--'Healy having told me that he was sure Lord Salisbury had\r\n\"rigged\" the Irish Boundary Commission, and I having written this to\r\nSpencer, I received an indignant denial. \"If indignation were justified\r\nat anything that Healy says, I should indignantly deny his accusation.\"'\r\n\r\n    'Between March 11th and 13th the Conservatives had given me a good\r\n    deal of trouble by trying, under pressure from their friends, to\r\n    vary the Seats Agreement upon several points.... They then attacked\r\n    the two-member towns in England, which, it may be remembered, had\r\n    been insisted on by Mr. Gladstone against my wish; and Northcote\r\n    wrote: \"Lord Salisbury and I never liked that _privilegium_, and\r\n    wished to have single-member constituencies everywhere\"; he tried\r\n    hard to get me to reopen the question, knowing doubtless that I was\r\n    with him on the merits. He continued to press the question as late\r\n    as March 15th, when he wrote: \"Our men are getting hard to hold,\r\n    and, having twice walked through the lobby almost alone, I have no\r\n    taste for repeating the operation.\" Conference with Lord Salisbury\r\n    followed, and the final stages were reached: from Monday, March\r\n    23rd, I had the Seats Bill in Committee four days a week.'\r\n\r\nThe essential fact in these dealings is that emphasized by Mr. Howel\r\nThomas, Secretary to the Boundary Commission:\r\n\r\n    'No political or other pressure would induce Sir Charles--and the\r\n    strongest pressure was used again and again--even to contemplate a\r\n    departure from the spirit of the compact. When once an agreement\r\n    became possible, he would spare no trouble to modify details. But\r\n    without agreement, however strong the argument for a change, nothing\r\n    was listened to.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 6th I received from Sir John Lambert, the retired Permanent\r\n    Secretary of the Local Government Board, a most grateful letter\r\n    about the Privy Councillorship, which had been announced to him by\r\n    Mr. Gladstone, and which no man ever more greatly deserved as an\r\n    honour, or by his character more greatly honoured.' [Footnote: John\r\n    Lambert's letter to Sir Charles contained these words: 'I have had\r\n    the opportunity of assisting you in a work which has placed you in\r\n    the very foremost rank of statesmen, and I have formed a friendship\r\n    which is one of the most gratifying incidents of my declining\r\n    years.']\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of May 9th I received a letter from Northcote,\r\n    congratulating me on the manner in which I had conducted the\r\n    Redistribution Bill \"through its difficult stages.... Let me thank\r\n    you once more for the great consideration, as well as the perfect\r\n    loyalty, with which you have dealt with the numerous questions, and\r\n    congratulate you on having brought your ship so well into port.\"'\r\n    [Footnote: Upon a table in the larger drawing-room at 76, Sloane\r\n    Street there stood always a bronze 'Victory' sent by Sir George\r\n    Trevelyan to Sir Charles to celebrate the passing of the\r\n    Redistribution Bill, with these words:\r\n\r\n    'Dear Dilke,--The bronze is a Victory on a globe. The Victory is\r\n    obvious. The globe below signifies the manner in which your conduct\r\n    of the Redistribution Bill got the Tory Press under your feet. I am\r\n    pleased to think that, as a work of art, it may pass muster even\r\n    before such an artist as the future Lady Dilke.... It is a copy of a\r\n    Herculaneum bronze.... I cannot help hoping that you will think it\r\n    not unworthy of the event which it is meant to commemorate.']\r\n\r\nBut 'port' was not finally reached till after the fall of the Ministry\r\nin June.\r\n\r\nWork on the Housing Commission was also practically completed.\r\nThroughout the year the Report had been under discussion.\r\n\r\nOn February 16th 'I told Chamberlain that the Labourers' Ireland\r\nCommittee had \"advised taking of land under compulsory powers in order\r\nto attach it to cottages\"--a proposal which was afterwards carried; to\r\nwhich Chamberlain replied: \"And your Commission?\" and I answered: \"We\r\n_shall_, I hope, but Lord Salisbury is jibbing since your speeches\" (on\r\nthe unauthorized programme).\r\n\r\n    'On March 11th, at the meeting of my Housing Commission, Lord\r\n    Salisbury proposed what Goschen at once described as \"Revolution,\"\r\n    and Broadhurst \"Socialism.\" He wanted to give public money out of\r\n    taxes to London. It may have been silly, but it was not either\r\n    revolutionary or socialistic.'\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the point of acting on the Report, the Tory leader was\r\nvery far from revolutionary; on June 4th,\r\n\r\n    'I was also seeing Lord Salisbury as to the Housing Commission\r\n    Bills, which he was to introduce into the House of Lords, [Footnote:\r\n    Sir Charles was to take charge of the measures in the Commons.] He\r\n    was strongly opposed to putting it into the power of Boards of\r\n    Guardians \"to build out of the rates as many cottages, with half-\r\n    acres attached, as they like, taking for the purpose any land\r\n    they please.\" In another letter he wrote: \"I should provide that--\r\n    (1) The Local Authority must pass a petition to the Local Government\r\n    Board to apply the Acts. (2) The Local Government Board must send\r\n    down and inquire with a long notice. (3) If the Local Government\r\n    Board inspector reports (i.) that the poorer classes of the parish\r\n    are not, and are not likely to be, sufficiently housed without the\r\n    application of the Acts; (ii.) that the Acts can be applied without\r\n    ultimate loss to the ratepayers, then a vote of the local\r\n    authorities should be sufficient to apply the Acts. It would be\r\n    better that a sufficient interval should be passed in these\r\n    processes to insure that the second vote should be given by a newly\r\n    elected local authority.\"'\r\n\r\nOn April 4th to 9th the Housing Commission visited Scotland.\r\n\r\n    'On the evening of April 4th I dined with the Lord Provost of\r\n    Edinburgh. On Easter Day I attended the Kirk with the Lord Provost,\r\n    hearing a magnificent sermon by Principal Caird, and in the evening\r\n    dined with the Lord Advocate. On Easter Tuesday I dined with the\r\n    Convention of Royal Burghs. On Thursday, April 9th, we left\r\n    Edinburgh for London.'\r\n\r\nThere remained only the question of inquiring and reporting with regard\r\nto Ireland, and here perplexities abounded.\r\n\r\nAs far back as February 7th at the Cabinet, 'the third matter discussed\r\nwas that of the proposed visit of the Prince of Wales to Dublin as a\r\nmember of my Commission, or, by himself, in advance of the visit of the\r\nCommission. It was decided that Parliament could not be asked for his\r\nexpenses without trouble with the Irish.'\r\n\r\nApril 9th.--'I now began discussing with Spencer the conditions on which\r\nthe Commission was to appear at Dublin, with regard to which there were\r\ngreat difficulties. Gray was on the Commission, but could not be\r\nSpencer's guest in any way, although, on the other hand, he and his\r\nfriends were willing to receive me in spite of my being a member of the\r\nGovernment. [Footnote: Mr. Dwyer Gray, Nationalist member for Carlow in\r\n1885. In 1886 he represented St. Stephen's Green, Dublin.] Spencer, in\r\ninviting me to stay with him, wrote: \"I do not think you will fear the\r\ndenunciation of _United Ireland_.\"\r\n\r\n    'On April 17th I entered in my diary, after the meeting of the Royal\r\n    Commission at which we signed our report: \"Pleasures of Ireland. If\r\n    we stay with Spencer, the Irish witnesses say that they will not\r\n    appear before the Commission; and if we do not, I am told that the\r\n    'loyalists' will not appear.\" On this day I wrote to Grant Duff: \"I\r\n    may go\" (out) \"with Chamberlain over Budget [Footnote:\r\n    Correspondence with Mr. Gladstone on the Budget and the Beer Tax has\r\n    been given in the previous chapter, pp. 118-120.] or over Irish\r\n    Coercion.\" He replied, and my rejoinder will be found below.'\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Charles's summary of this letter will be found in\r\n    this chapter (p. 143).]\r\n\r\nTrouble had arisen also over Mr. Childers's wish to increase the duty on\r\nsparkling wines. This Sir Charles strongly opposed\r\n\r\n    'on the ground that it would upset the French and make them withdraw\r\n    the most favoured nation treatment which I had won, and the matter\r\n    was adjourned.'\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, May 16th, there was another Cabinet. Childers proposed\r\n    to raise the wine duties, to reduce by one-half his proposed\r\n    increase on spirits, and to limit to one year his increase on beer.\r\n    We all agreed, against Childers, to postpone any announcement of\r\n    changes for three weeks, and Childers, thinking that this meant that\r\n    we had agreed not to take his proposals, said that he would resign.'\r\n\r\nApril 24th.--'I had now received Spencer's consent to my quitting the\r\nViceregal Lodge, when at Dublin at Whitsuntide, for one evening, to\r\nattend a party at Gray's, which was the virtual condition of our not\r\nbeing boycotted by the Nationalists.'\r\n\r\nNegotiations between the Irish party and both English parties were at\r\nthis time in the air, and it will be seen that this visit to Ireland\r\nbecame connected with political issues quite different from its\r\nostensible and non-controversial object.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1885 anti-Irish feeling, which to some extent had been allayed,\r\nwas again roused by dynamite outrages. One bomb was exploded in the\r\nTower of London, and two in the precincts of Parliament. The general\r\ntemper may be judged by an entry of February 7th:\r\n\r\n    'I remonstrated with Harcourt as to the restrictions at the House,\r\n    which he and the Speaker had agreed on, so far as they affected the\r\n    Press. I said that it was ridiculous to shut out little Lucy, the\r\n    \"Toby\" of _Punch_, and Harcourt gravely assured me that Lucy was a\r\n    man who would willingly bring dynamite into the House himself; after\r\n    which I had no more to say.'\r\n\r\nIt was in face of this feeling that Mr. Chamberlain had drafted a scheme\r\ngiving very large powers of self-government to an Irish popularly\r\nelected body.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Charles was declaring for resignation, he received a\r\ncommunication which made the Irish matter pressing.\r\n\r\n    'On April 22nd Cardinal Manning wrote to me that he had some\r\n    information of importance which he wished for an opportunity of\r\n    making known to me, and he begged me to come to him on my way to\r\n    Whitehall on the morrow. I had to see Lord Salisbury and Sir\r\n    Stafford Northcote as to the Seats Bill, and it was not until the\r\n    afternoon that I was able to see the Cardinal. He spoke in the name\r\n    of Croke and another Roman Catholic Irish Archbishop, and of five\r\n    Irish Roman Catholic Bishops who had been staying with him, the\r\n    latter being a deputation of five to Rome who represented \"the 14\r\n    Bishops.\" He said that Croke had become frightened of the extreme\r\n    Nationalists. The Cardinal declared that the Roman Catholic clergy\r\n    were ready to pacify Ireland if we would pass Chamberlain's Local\r\n    Government Ireland Scheme, with a Central Board such as Chamberlain\r\n    proposed. The Bishops and clergy would be prepared to denounce, not\r\n    only separation, but also an Irish Parliament. I had reason to know\r\n    that Lord Spencer was unfavourable to any negotiation with Cardinal\r\n    Manning, but on the 24th, having that day again seen Manning, who\r\n    put the dots on the \"i's\" and volunteered that if the Irish Bishops\r\n    got the elective board for Ireland they would denounce as\r\n    revolutionary an Irish Parliament, I wrote to Mr. Gladstone stating\r\n    Manning's views, and suggesting that Chamberlain should see the\r\n    Cardinal on the morrow. [Footnote: See the next two pages, where\r\n    accounts of these interviews and correspondence occur.]\r\n\r\n    'I said in my letter to Mr. Gladstone: \"I knew that the Pope, in\r\n    sending for the Bishops to Rome, had acted on Manning's advice. I\r\n    also knew that Manning bitterly resented Errington's visits to Rome.\r\n    This was all I knew on the subject until to-day, when Manning\r\n    suddenly proposed to me to bring about peace and good-will in\r\n    Ireland on the basis of Chamberlain's Local Government and Central\r\n    Board Scheme.... Manning has got a pledge from the Roman Catholic\r\n    Bishops, including even Archbishop Croke ... and from Davitt, to\r\n    denounce separation. He has got from the Bishops, including Croke, a\r\n    declaration against an Irish Parliament, provided they obtain the\r\n    Local Government Central Board. I suggested that he should see\r\n    Chamberlain at once, and learn secretly the details of his\r\n    proposals. He said nothing of coercion, and I, of course, avoided\r\n    the subject, as I did not know whether a coercion Bill is to be\r\n    proposed. I should suggest that Manning be encouraged to let the\r\n    Pope have Chamberlain's scheme.\"\r\n\r\n    'I sent this memorandum to Chamberlain and to Lord Spencer, as well\r\n    as to Mr. Gladstone, and Chamberlain wrote: \"I am quite willing to\r\n    call on the Cardinal if Mr. Gladstone approves.\" Lord Spencer wrote:\r\n    \"The question of Mr. Chamberlain's seeing the Cardinal with a view\r\n    of his scheme being made known to the Pope is for Mr. Gladstone's\r\n    decision, but I would venture to say that he should not disclose his\r\n    plan to the Cardinal unless the Cabinet agree to it.\" This last\r\n    memorandum from Lord Spencer is dated the 25th, but on the 24th\r\n    Chamberlain, Mr. Gladstone having consented, had seen the Cardinal.\r\n    I also saw the Cardinal again on the 25th, and he told me that in\r\n    his opinion it was essential that Dr. Walsh should be made\r\n    Archbishop of Dublin. He also told me that he was going to see\r\n    Parnell on the Chamberlain scheme. On April 30th the Cardinal saw\r\n    Parnell, and told him that the Bishops would support Chamberlain in\r\n    the Local Government of Ireland scheme. Parnell promised that he\r\n    would support it, and would not obstruct the Crimes Bill. So O'Shea\r\n    told me, and showed me a paper unsigned, which purported to be, and\r\n    which, knowing the hand, I believe was, Parnell's writing, somewhat\r\n    to this effect. On the 28th a Committee of the Cabinet had been\r\n    appointed on Chamberlain's Irish Local Government and Central\r\n    Council scheme. On May 1st the Cardinal told me of his interview\r\n    with Parnell, and of a more completely satisfactory interview\r\n    between himself and Sexton.\r\n\r\n    'The scheme was one which proposed the establishment in Ireland of a\r\n    national elective Council, to which were to be referred matters at\r\n    present in the hands of some four Boards at Dublin Castle. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's consent to Chamberlain's interview with the Cardinal had\r\n    been given in conversation at the House of Commons on the 23rd, and\r\n    I have a letter from Mr. Gladstone stating this. I had probably, for\r\n    some reason which I forget, both written and spoken to him after my\r\n    first interview with Manning on the 22nd, and put the matter again\r\n    in a letter (possibly to go to Spencer) on the 24th. I have also a\r\n    letter from Chamberlain on the 24th, saying that his interview with\r\n    Manning \"quite confirms your minute, and the position is hopeful.\"\r\n    With regard to the Cardinal's insisting upon Walsh, and his anger at\r\n    Errington's interference, I had a letter which I sent to Lord\r\n    Spencer, and which he kept, but returned my minute referring to the\r\n    Cardinal's letter, endorsed only \"S. 25-4-85.\" Chamberlain also\r\n    wrote on the same day, again stating that his interview with the\r\n    Cardinal had been highly satisfactory, and adding: \"Do not let Mr.\r\n    Errington meddle with the Archbishopric of Dublin.\" On April 26th\r\n    the Cardinal had again written to me about the Errington business\r\n    and the See of Dublin, and this second letter on the subject I kept.\r\n    The only new point in it was that contained in the following phrase:\r\n    \"I have an impression that efforts have been made to represent Dr.\r\n    Walsh as a Nationalist. He is not more so than I am; and whether\r\n    that is excessive or obstructive you will judge.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, April 28th, the Cardinal again spoke to me as to the\r\n    archbishopric, expressing his great vexation as to Spencer's action\r\n    through Errington. I sent a minute to Spencer which he returned,\r\n    writing, with regard to Manning's moderate opinions: \"I wish it may\r\n    be so. Responsibility does wonders. Maynooth is so bad that the Pope\r\n    is now discussing it with the Bishops.\" Dr. Walsh, Manning's\r\n    candidate, was President of Maynooth. I sent Spencer's minute to\r\n    Chamberlain, who returned it with a strong minute of his own for\r\n    Spencer, who again wrote: \"H.E. the Cardinal is wrong in his\r\n    estimate of Dr. Walsh.\" On April 30th Manning wrote mentioning a\r\n    further conversation with Parnell, and adding: \"The result is that I\r\n    strongly advise the prompt introduction of the scheme I have in\r\n    writing. It cannot be known too soon. But both on general and on\r\n    particular reasons I hope that neither you nor your friend will\r\n    dream of the act you spoke of. Government are pledged in their first\r\n    Queen's Speech to county government in Ireland. Let them redeem\r\n    their pledge. All the rest will follow.\" The \"act,\" of course, was\r\n    resignation.'\r\n\r\n    'At the Cabinet Committee of May 1st on Ireland, Carlingford and\r\n    Harcourt, in Spencer's interest, violently attacked Chamberlain's\r\n    scheme; Hartington less violently; Childers, Lefevre, and Trevelyan\r\n    supported. Spencer seeming to waver, Harcourt rather turned round,\r\n    and Mr. Gladstone afterwards told Chamberlain that Carlingford's\r\n    opposition did not matter.\r\n\r\n    'On May 1st I again saw Manning, who told me of further interviews\r\n    with Parnell and Sexton. I noted in my diary: \"2nd to 6th. The Irish\r\n    row--Mr. Gladstone between Chamberlain and Spencer: the deep sea and\r\n    the devil, or the devil and the deep sea--continues.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 7th the Cardinal wrote: \"How can the _Standard_ have got the\r\n    Irish scheme? Nothing is secret and nobody is safe. My copy of it is\r\n    both safe and secret.\" On May 8th I wrote to Grant Duff:\r\n    \"Chamberlain and I have a big Irish Local Government scheme on hand,\r\n    which is backed by the R. C. Bishops--which may either pacify\r\n    Ireland or break up the Government.\" On the 9th, Harcourt having\r\n    come over, Chamberlain's scheme received the support of all the\r\n    Commoners except Hartington, and was opposed by all the peers except\r\n    Lord Granville. Mr. Gladstone said to me in leaving the room:\r\n    \"Within six years, if it pleases God to spare their lives, they will\r\n    be repenting in ashes.\" At night he wrote to Lord Spencer and to\r\n    Hartington that he intended to go out upon this question.\r\n\r\n    'During Sunday, May 10th, Harcourt tried hard to patch matters up on\r\n    the basis of \"No Home Rule, no coercion, no remedial legislation, no\r\n    Ireland at all.\"'\r\n\r\nOn May 13th 'Cardinal Manning dined with me, and we further discussed\r\nthe position of Chamberlain's scheme.'\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a new and complicating factor was introduced:\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, May 15th, there was another Cabinet, from which\r\n    Trevelyan was absent through illness. A Land Purchase Ireland Bill\r\n    was suddenly presented to us, to which I expressed strong\r\n    opposition, unless it were to be accompanied by \"Chamberlain's Local\r\n    Government scheme\"; and a Coercion Bill was also presented to us,\r\n    against which Chamberlain, Lefevre, and I, protested. We, however,\r\n    declared that we would yield as regards some points in the Coercion\r\n    Bill provided the Land Purchase Bill were dropped or the \"Local\r\n    Government measure\" introduced.' [Footnote: A Land Purchase Bill had\r\n    been proposed in the end of April, 1884, by Lord Spencer, which\r\n    after preliminary consideration by a Committee was discussed in\r\n    Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    'I opposed the whole thing. Lord Derby gave five reasons against it,\r\n    all five unanswerable, and then supported it. Northbrook agreed with\r\n    me. Childers, supported by a unanimous Cabinet committee, proposed a\r\n    scheme of Chamberlain's suggestion for advancing the whole purchase\r\n    money. Spencer proposed three-fourths. Mr. Gladstone had a scheme of\r\n    his own which nobody could understand. Spencer insisted on counting\r\n    heads. Lord Granville, who would, of course, have supported Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, had gone away. Trevelyan, who had been called in, was not\r\n    allowed to vote, and the result was that the majority pronounced\r\n    against Chamberlain's scheme; Spencer who was for three-fourths, and\r\n    I against the whole thing, voting together with Carlingford,\r\n    Northbrook, the Chancellor, Hartington, and Dodson--a scratch\r\n    lot--against Mr. Gladstone, Childers, Harcourt, Kimberley, Derby,\r\n    and Chamberlain.']\r\n\r\n    'On Sunday, May 17th, I dined with Edward Levy Lawson, [Footnote:\r\n    Afterwards the first Lord Burnham.] and met the Prince of Wales and\r\n    Randolph Churchill; and Randolph told the Prince and myself that\r\n    which he had previously told the Irish members--namely, that\r\n    Salisbury had promised to have no coercion; but I noted in my diary\r\n    that I did not believe this. I was wrong, for Salisbury afterwards\r\n    said at Newport that his mind had been made up against coercion long\r\n    before the change of Government. I knew that Randolph had seen\r\n    Parnell, as I had twice seen them together in Gosset's room, which\r\n    only Randolph and I ever used before 5 p m.'\r\n\r\nThere were now two separate subjects of division leading to resignations\r\nin the Cabinet. There were those who would resign unless coercion was\r\nrenewed, and there was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was\r\nresigning because he could not get his way as to the Budget. His\r\nresignation was 'suspended'; but Mr. Gladstone was evidently anxious to\r\nbe out of it all.\r\n\r\n    'On the Sunday Childers informed us that he would go on for three\r\n    weeks. On Wednesday afternoon, May 20th, Mr. Gladstone spoke to me\r\n    at the House, and told me that he would go on until the end of the\r\n    Session, and would then resign, and that Hartington would try to\r\n    form a Government, although he might fail in getting one that could\r\n    agree on Irish proposals. Mr. Gladstone said nothing about land\r\n    purchase, but in the course of the afternoon he suddenly announced\r\n    publicly the introduction of a Land Purchase Bill, thinking, I\r\n    believe, that he had Chamberlain's consent to a Bill limited to one\r\n    year. I at once wrote him a letter of resignation, and then sent off\r\n    for Chamberlain, Lefevre, and Trevelyan.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain's interview with Mr. Gladstone that had misled the\r\n    latter had taken place after the Cabinet of Saturday--I think on the\r\n    morning of Monday, the 18th--and their meeting was on the subject of\r\n    Childers's Budget proposals. Chamberlain, writing to me about it,\r\n    said: \"We are likely to want four millions less money. Therefore,\r\n    says Childers, let us have a new Budget and clap an additional tax\r\n    of £300,000 on wine.\" Chamberlain also wrote to me, after his\r\n    interview with Mr. Gladstone, on the Monday afternoon, telling me\r\n    that Randolph Churchill was going to give notice of a Committee to\r\n    inquire into the state of Ireland, that Churchill thought that we\r\n    should be out by that time and supporting him, and that he\r\n    contemplated a separation from his own leaders, and a union, on a\r\n    Radical Irish policy for \"Local Government,\" and against coercion,\r\n    of the two sides from below the gangway. Chamberlain added that, if\r\n    the Russian matter \"were out of the way, Mr. Gladstone would let us\r\n    go, and I think _we must go_.\" This correspondence had left me\r\n    unaware of any change in Chamberlain's view, if there was any, about\r\n    the Land Purchase Bill. As soon as Chamberlain reached the House on\r\n    the 20th, and heard from me what I had done, he also wrote a letter\r\n    of resignation; but he was not pleased, and perhaps rightly, at my\r\n    having taken so strong a step without consulting him on the precise\r\n    point.\r\n\r\n    'In Chamberlain's letter, which was sent at 6 p.m. on the 20th, he\r\n    said: \"Dear Mr. Gladstone,--I have heard with great surprise that\r\n    you have this afternoon given notice of the introduction of a Land\r\n    Purchase Bill for Ireland, unaccompanied by any reference to the\r\n    large scheme of Local Government, the promise of which for next year\r\n    was the condition of the assent given by Sir Charles Dilke and\r\n    myself to the proposal for dealing with Land Purchase during the\r\n    present Session. I am convinced that a measure of the kind suggested\r\n    by Lord Spencer will have a distinct tendency to increase the\r\n    agitation for a separation between the two countries, and at the\r\n    same time will seriously prejudice the success of any such scheme of\r\n    Local Government as I have submitted to the Cabinet.... In the\r\n    circumstances I feel that I have no alternative but to place my\r\n    resignation in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of May 21st Lefevre informed us that he should go\r\n    with us, and also wrote a letter of resignation, in which he said\r\n    that he did not agree with us as to Land Purchase, but that as we\r\n    went he must go, too, on coercion.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone sent for me on the 21st, and I suggested a way out,\r\n    in our acceptance of the Land Purchase Bill, with a promise of \"the\r\n    Local Government Scheme\" for 1886. Mr. Gladstone fell in with this\r\n    view, and proposed that at Dublin, for which I was starting on\r\n    Friday morning, May 22nd, I should try to get Spencer's consent to\r\n    the limitation of the new Coercion Bill to a single year, and the\r\n    promise of the \"Local Government Bill\" for 1886. On the 21st Mr.\r\n    Gladstone wrote to me several times, as did also Chamberlain. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had written to Chamberlain on the night of the 20th: \"I\r\n    have never been in greater surprise than at the fresh trouble\r\n    developed this afternoon. I believed myself to be acting entirely\r\n    within the lines of your and Dilke's concurrence, and surely I am\r\n    right in thinking that you could not have supposed that the notice\r\n    of an intention to bring in a Bill offered the occasion on which to\r\n    refer to the distinct though allied subject of Local Government.\r\n    What I understood to be your and Dilke's procedure was to agree to a\r\n    Land Purchase Bill with a provision of funds for one year, which\r\n    would leave the whole measure ... dependent on a fresh judgment\r\n    which might be associated with Local Government as its condition. It\r\n    seems to me to be a matter which we may perfectly well consider, and\r\n    hope to arrange, in what terms reference shall be made to Local\r\n    Government when the Bill is brought in. Will not that be the time to\r\n    part, if part we must, which I do not believe? I send a copy of this\r\n    to Dilke, and will only add, to the expression of my surprise, my\r\n    deep concern.\"\r\n\r\n    'When I received a letter from Mr. Gladstone, enclosing a copy of\r\n    his to Chamberlain, I replied (first showing my answer to Lefevre\r\n    and sending it to Chamberlain) to the effect that the proposal to\r\n    introduce a Land Purchase Bill had been discussed by and rejected by\r\n    the Cabinet, that I could not concur in the reversal of its\r\n    judgment, and that, thinking as I did that a deliberate opinion of\r\n    the Cabinet had been disregarded without warrant, and having, so\r\n    thinking, resigned, I should be unable to attend any meeting of the\r\n    Cabinet if one were summoned. I have a letter from Chamberlain to Mr\r\n    Gladstone dated 21st, and two later ones from Mr. Gladstone to\r\n    myself. Chamberlain said:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Mr. Gladstone,\r\n\r\n    '\"I fear there has been a serious misapprehension on both sides with\r\n    respect to a Land Purchase Bill, and I take blame to myself if I did\r\n    not express myself with sufficient clearness. I certainly never\r\n    imagined that the promise of introduction would be made without\r\n    further reference to the Cabinet, or without some definite decision\r\n    as to Local Government. I doubt very much if it is wise or even\r\n    right to attempt to cover over the serious differences of principle\r\n    that have lately disclosed themselves in the Cabinet. I think it is\r\n    now certain that they will cause a split in the new Parliament, and\r\n    it seems hardly fair to the constituencies that this should only be\r\n    admitted after they have discharged their functions, and when they\r\n    are unable to influence the result.\r\n\r\n    '\"I am,\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    '\"J. CHAMBERLAIN.\"\r\n\r\n    'They _did_ \"cause\" a split in the new Parliament, but Spencer the\r\n    Coercionist and Chamberlain the Nationalist had changed places!'\r\n\r\n    'I do not know which of Mr. Gladstone's two letters dated the 21st\r\n    is the earlier. In the one Mr. Gladstone wrote: \"I hope that my note\r\n    may have shown you that the time for considering your difficulty (if\r\n    there be one) has not arrived. Please to tell me if this is so, as\r\n    if it were not I should have to summon the Cabinet this afternoon to\r\n    report what has happened. The messenger will wait for an answer.--\r\n    Yours sincerely, W. E. Gladstone.--This is also for Chamberlain.\" I\r\n    replied somewhat curtly that if there were a Cabinet I could not\r\n    attend. The other letter referred to a conversation which had taken\r\n    place between Hamilton and Chamberlain, and said that the latter was\r\n    \"willing that his letter should stand as _non avenu_ until after the\r\n    recess--i.e. (so I understand it), we should, before the Bill is\r\n    introduced, consider in what terms the subject of Local Government\r\n    should be referred to when the Bill is introduced. I am not trying\r\n    to bind you to this understanding, but if you and he will come here\r\n    at 3.0 we will try to get at the bottom of the matter.\" My reply\r\n    was:\r\n\r\n    '\"21st May.\r\n\r\n    '\"I certainly cannot withdraw my resignation unless the incident is\r\n    explained to the whole of the members of the Cabinet. If you could\r\n    see your way to circulate a box explaining that we were not\r\n    consenting parties to the reversal of the opinion of the Cabinet,\r\n    then I would try to help find some way out. I am, however, hopeless\r\n    as to the wisdom of doing so. We differ so completely on the\r\n    questions which will occupy the time of Parliament for the remainder\r\n    of the Session that I feel that the Cabinet cannot hold together\r\n    with advantage to the country. Lefevre strongly agrees with this\r\n    view Northbrook and Hartington, who, with Lefevre, were against\r\n    Chamberlain and myself on the merits, evidently felt as amazed as we\r\n    were at the reversal of the decision.\"'\r\n\r\n    'At this moment Chamberlain wrote to Mrs. Pattison' (in India) 'to\r\n    say that the times were \"most anxious. Mr. Gladstone is certainly\r\n    going to retire soon, and the influence which has held together\r\n    discordant elements will be removed with him. Fortunately, we know\r\n    our own minds, and are not deficient in resolution, but it is not\r\n    always easy to see clearly the right times and way of giving effect\r\n    to our decisions. I do not myself believe that the struggle between\r\n    us and the Whigs can be long postponed. It has nearly come over the\r\n    question of Ireland, and even now we may be compelled to break off\r\n    on this vital point. In any case we shall not join another\r\n    Government nor meet another Parliament without a decision; and if it\r\n    is against our views, the split will be final and complete, and we\r\n    shall be out of office until we can lead a purely Radical\r\n    Administration. We must win in the end, but the contest will be a\r\n    bitter one, and may lead us farther than we contemplate at\r\n    present.... I was dining last Saturday with Lord Ripon, who\r\n    professed to be well pleased ... and declared his full adhesion to\r\n    the new gospel; but the majority of his class and school are getting\r\n    thoroughly frightened, and will probably quicken and intensify the\r\n    movement by setting themselves against it, instead of trying to\r\n    guide and direct it. A good deal depends on Lord Hartington. He is\r\n    constitutionally contemptuous of, and unsympathetic with, the\r\n    democratic sentiment of the times.\"\r\n\r\n    'By our telegrams of May 21st, I saw that on the 20th Sir John Kirk,\r\n    our man at Zanzibar, had been snubbed by Lord Granville, and I felt\r\n    that if I went out upon the Irish Question I should be able at least\r\n    to speak my mind as to the manner in which we had pandered to the\r\n    Germans on the Zanzibar coast.\r\n\r\n    'On May 21st I wrote to Grant Duff: \"Mr. G. will resign at the end\r\n    of the session. I rather doubt Hartington being able to form a\r\n    Government.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of Friday, May 22nd, I left for Dublin, and by\r\n    teatime was at the Viceregal Lodge.'\r\n\r\nOn the previous day Sir Charles had written:\r\n\r\n    'Local Government Board,\r\n     'May 21st, 1885.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Grant Duff,\r\n\r\n    'Off to Ireland, where I expect to be Boycotted by both sides\r\n    [Footnote: It turned out the other way.]--by the Nationalists\r\n    because I stay with Spencer, and by the Orangemen because we sit at\r\n    the Mansion House.\r\n\r\n        'Yours,\r\n        'Chs. W. D.'\r\n\r\n    'As Mr. Gladstone at our last interview had bid me convert Spencer\r\n    if I could, and virtually promised that he would support our views\r\n    if Spencer would, I had asked Trevelyan and Harcourt to back me up\r\n    in letters. Harcourt made delay. Trevelyan wrote on the 23rd: \"I am\r\n    sorry the whole thing is in the newspapers, and see in it another\r\n    reason for getting it settled. If you and Chamberlain make it a\r\n    point to have the Bill for a year, I should be glad to see the\r\n    concession made. The concession on the part of those who take\r\n    another view would not be greater than was made by those of us who\r\n    objected to have a Land Bill that was not based upon a new system of\r\n    Local Government.\"\r\n\r\n    'Early in the morning of Saturday, the 23rd, before the meeting of\r\n    my Commission at the City Hall, I had had a long talk with Spencer,\r\n    and I felt, more strongly than I ever had before, that his position\r\n    in Dublin was untenable, and that he ought to be allowed to go. On\r\n    Whit Sunday I attended church with Spencer, and in the afternoon\r\n    took him for the only walk which he had enjoyed for a long time. We\r\n    passed the spot where Lord Frederick Cavendish was killed, and\r\n    accompanied by a single aide-de-camp, but watched at a distance by\r\n    two policemen in plain clothes, and met at every street corner by\r\n    two others, walked to the strawberry gardens, and on our return, it\r\n    being a lovely Sunday when the Wicklow Mountains were at their best\r\n    and the hawthorn in bloom, met thousands of Dublin people driving\r\n    out to the strawberry gardens on cars. In the course of the whole\r\n    long walk but one man lifted his hat to Spencer, who was universally\r\n    recognized, but assailed by the majority of those we met with shouts\r\n    of, \"Who killed Myles Joyce?\" [Footnote: One of several men hanged\r\n    for the Maamtrasna murders. All the other men sentenced protested\r\n    that Myles Joyce was innocent, and died protesting it. Strong\r\n    efforts were made to gain a reprieve for this lad.] while some\r\n    varied the proceedings by calling \"Murderer!\" after him. A few days\r\n    later, when I was driving with Lady Spencer in an open carriage, a\r\n    well-dressed bicyclist came riding through the cavalry escort, and\r\n    in a quiet, conversational tone observed to us, \"Who killed Myles\r\n    Joyce?\" At his dinner-party on the Sunday evening Spencer told us\r\n    that a Roman Catholic priest [Footnote: Father Healy, parish priest\r\n    of Bray, and most famous of modern Irish talkers.] who was present\r\n    (the Vicar of Bray, I think, but not _the_ Bray) was the only priest\r\n    in Ireland who would enter his walls, while the Castle was boycotted\r\n    by every Archbishop and Bishop. On Monday morning, the 25th, Whit\r\n    Monday, I paid a visit to the Mansion House at the request of the\r\n    Lord Mayor of Dublin, taking by Spencer's leave the Viceregal\r\n    carriages there, where they had in his second viceroyalty not been\r\n    before, and was received by the Lord Mayor in state, which consisted\r\n    in much exhibition of the most gorgeous porter (in green and gold)\r\n    that my eyes had ever beheld. I afterwards went on to see Hamilton,\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Robert Hamilton, who had succeeded Mr. Bourke as the\r\n    permanent head of Dublin Castle.] the Under-Secretary. He offered us\r\n    as a maximum County Boards plus a Central Education Board for\r\n    Ireland, to administer all the grants with rating powers, and to be\r\n    called a great experiment to be extended if it answered. In the\r\n    evening I discussed this with Spencer, who went a little farther,\r\n    and offered, in addition to County Boards, four elective Central\r\n    Boards for Ireland, to discharge much the same duties which\r\n    Chamberlain's scheme gave to the Central Board; but Spencer\r\n    obstinately refused to take the plunge of making the four Boards\r\n    into one Board. It was on this point that we broke off; and he never\r\n    got farther forward until after the Government had gone out. He has\r\n    since declared that his conversion to a more advanced Home Rule\r\n    scheme than that of Chamberlain, which he had refused, was caused by\r\n    the return of a certain majority of Nationalist members; but he was\r\n    perfectly aware at this time what that majority would be, and I\r\n    confess that I have never been able to understand why Hamilton and\r\n    Spencer should have held out as they did in May against the moderate\r\n    scheme, and have supported the extreme one as early as July, which I\r\n    believe to have been the case. Had Spencer yielded at this moment,\r\n    it is at least possible that the Irish question would have been\r\n    settled. At all events, there has never been in our time so fair a\r\n    chance of settlement.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, the 26th, I heard from Lefevre, who wrote strongly\r\n    against the Coercion Bill for Spencer's benefit, but added in a\r\n    separate letter that he regarded the notice in the _Birmingham Post_\r\n    as indicating that Chamberlain had been talking freely about the\r\n    dissensions in the Cabinet, and that if this was so he considered it\r\n    unfortunate, as tending to increase the difficulty of getting any\r\n    further concessions from Spencer or other members of the Cabinet who\r\n    favoured coercion.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday evening the Commission dined with Gray, and met Dr.\r\n    Walsh, the new Archbishop; but at Dr. Walsh's wish I had gone to\r\n    Gray's house half an hour before dinner to see the Archbishop\r\n    privately, and to be thanked by him for the part that I had taken in\r\n    trying to prevent opposition to the choice. In the evening Gray had\r\n    a party at which both sides were represented, Chief Justice Morris\r\n    being among those present. Gray's house, although the Spencers\r\n    disliked him, was one at which the parties always met as much as is\r\n    possible at all in Ireland. When Gray came out of gaol after his\r\n    imprisonment he gave a small dinner, at which were present the Judge\r\n    who had sentenced him, the gaoler who had had him in custody, and\r\n    the prosecuting counsel. The most interesting man at Gray's was\r\n    Fottrell, the man whose memoirs ought to be interesting, for he had\r\n    acted as intermediary between the Castle (that is, Hamilton) and\r\n    Parnell at the time when secret communications were passing between\r\n    them, although openly they were at war.\r\n\r\n    'Dickson, the Ulster Liberal member, [Footnote: M.P. For Dungannon,\r\n    Tyrone, 1880-1885. He afterwards became a leading Unionist.] was at\r\n    Gray's, and he announced that he had at last come over to\r\n    Chamberlain's scheme. Now, Hartington was crossing the next day to\r\n    stay at the Viceregal Lodge, and was to speak at Belfast under\r\n    Dickson's auspices, and the announcement of Dickson's change of\r\n    front was a startling blow to him and Spencer.\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of Wednesday, the 27th, I wrote to Grant Duff: \"A\r\n    pretty pass you Whigs have brought this country to! I really think\r\n    we Radicals ought to be allowed to try. We certainly could not do it\r\n    _worse_. 'Poland' has been a byword, yet Poland is far less of a\r\n    weakness to Russia than Ireland to us, and the Russians have now the\r\n    Polish peasantry with them, if they have the towns and nobles\r\n    against them. _We_ have _no_ friends in Ireland. All our policy has\r\n    aimed at conciliating at least Ulster, and now Ulster is fast\r\n    becoming as Nationalist as Cork. The Liberals carried Belfast\r\n    freeholders in the late Antrim election to the cry of 'Down with\r\n    coercion!' and 'No special legislation!' Hartington comes to-night,\r\n    and I shall try to arrange some compromise with him and Spencer as\r\n    to the future--probably an Irish elective education Council.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the evening of the 27th I had a long conference with Hartington\r\n    and Spencer, in which I \"worked\" Dickson much. Before this I had had\r\n    the third meeting of my Commission, and then a public meeting in\r\n    connection with the Dublin Ladies' Central Association, a body\r\n    dealing with the Housing of the Working Classes. On the morning of\r\n    May 28th Spencer came into my bedroom before eight o'clock, and told\r\n    me that Hartington was very ill, suffering from sleeplessness and\r\n    fever, and that it would be quite impossible for him to make his\r\n    Belfast speech.... Dickson soon came to the Viceregal Lodge, and\r\n    earnestly begged me to go to Belfast in Hartington's place, but\r\n    under the circumstances I felt that it was impossible that I should\r\n    do so, although he promised me that a special train should be\r\n    waiting at the last moment if I would change my mind.\r\n\r\n    'I received this day a letter from Cardinal Manning strongly urging\r\n    that Chamberlain, Lefevre, and I, should stay in. \"If you and the\r\n    like of you leave the Whigs, they will fall back and unite in\r\n    resisting you. So long as you are in contact with them, they will\r\n    yield to reason. These are the thoughts of an Old Testament\r\n    Radical.\" But the Old Testament Radical went on to make proposals to\r\n    me with regard to the Roman Catholic vote in Chelsea which would\r\n    have astonished the Old Testament prophets.\r\n\r\n    'Another letter which I received this day was from O'Shea about\r\n    Parnell's opinions on the Coercion Bill, but it is so obscure that I\r\n    can make nothing of it. It was on a suggestion of Lefevre's with\r\n    regard to bringing the Coercion Bill into force only by\r\n    \"proclamation.\" It shows, however, if O'Shea is to be believed, that\r\n    Parnell was willing to accept a coercion measure of some kind, or,\r\n    at all events, to haggle about its terms, if publicly resisting it\r\n    as a whole.\r\n\r\n    'By the same post I received a letter from Heneage [Footnote: Mr.\r\n    Edward Heneage, for many years M.P. for Grimsby, and for a short\r\n    time Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1886. He was afterwards\r\n    a leading Unionist.] professing to state the general view of the\r\n    House of Commons, and pronouncing in favour of a liberal policy\r\n    towards Ireland. \"(1) Non-renewal of the Crimes Act. (2) Amendment\r\n    of the jury laws. (3) Amendment of the purchase clauses. (4)\r\n    Abolition of the Lord Lieutenancy. (5) Improvement of Local\r\n    Government.\" This I showed to Spencer, with a memorandum of my own\r\n    in which I said that it was \"a curious letter from a Whig.\" Spencer\r\n    wrote on my memorandum in returning the letter: \"It is an odd\r\n    letter.... He wrote to me the other day about the abolition of the\r\n    Lord Lieutenancy, rather apologizing for bringing it on. I replied\r\n    deprecating any movement which might not go with action. To denounce\r\n    an office without at once abolishing it would weaken the hands of\r\n    him who filled it.\"\r\n\r\n    'I wrote to Lefevre and Chamberlain that Hartington had come very\r\n    well, and was very well at dinner, but bored at having to speak.\r\n    \"Walker told him what I told him as to the unwisdom of speaking in\r\n    favour of coercion in Belfast immediately after the anti-coercion\r\n    speeches of the Liberals at the Antrim election; and to-day he is\r\n    ill. I do not know how far the two things are connected; but the\r\n    papers will _say_ they are.\"\r\n\r\n    'I lunched with Sir Edward Guinness and sat in the Speaker's chair\r\n    of the Irish Parliament; dined with Sir Robert Hamilton at the Yacht\r\n    Club at Kingstown; slept on board the boat and crossed next day;\r\n    spent Saturday to Tuesday at Dockett Eddy; and on Tuesday was at the\r\n    State Concert, where several of us tried to patch up some means of\r\n    being able to meet in Cabinet on June 5th. On Thursday, June 4th, I\r\n    had a long talk with Mr. Gladstone, and, on his agreeing to support\r\n    the Heneage-Lefevre-O'Shea proposal, now supported by Chamberlain,\r\n    for only bringing the Coercion Bill into force by a proclamation,\r\n    agreed to attend the Cabinet the next day, but without withdrawing\r\n    my resignation, which remained \"suspended.\"\r\n\r\n    'I began on the 3rd and ended on the 5th June a letter to Grant Duff\r\n    in reply to one from him bidding me not break off from the\r\n    Government on any but a clear and obvious issue. I told him that (1)\r\n    Radicals in a minority would only ever get their way by often\r\n    threatening to go, even on secondary points, and that they must not\r\n    threaten unless they \"meant it.\" (2) Mr. G. insisted he was \"going.\"\r\n    \"Therefore we have to count with Hartington. We doubt if we can form\r\n    part of a Hartington Government, and we can't do so if we do not ...\r\n    impose our terms by threats.... This is why I have been forcing the\r\n    pace of late.... Chamberlain is a little timid just now, in view of\r\n    the elections and the fury of the _Pall Mall_. I could not drive\r\n    Chamberlain out without his free consent, so I am rather tied.\r\n    Still, we shall (June 5th) get our own way, I fancy, at to-day's\r\n    Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the morning of June 5th my position in attending the Cabinet was\r\n    weakened, if not made ridiculous, by a letter from Spencer in which\r\n    he refused the Heneage-Lefevre-O'Shea compromise. But I went all the\r\n    same, for I was not supposed to know what he had written to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone. The first matter discussed was the Budget. I opposed the\r\n    proposed increase of the wine duties from 1s. to 1s. 3d., and from\r\n    2s. 6d. to 3s. (all bottled wine to be at the 3s. rate). I carried\r\n    with me at first all except Mr. Gladstone against Childers, and at\r\n    last Mr. Gladstone also. Childers then left the room; Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    Lord Granville, Harcourt, and the Chancellor, one by one, went after\r\n    him, but he would not come back. The Guards at Alexandria were\r\n    mentioned, and then Spencer's letter to Mr. Gladstone against the\r\n    proclamation clause read, whereon Chamberlain and I protested\r\n    against coercion as a whole, and no decision upon any point was come\r\n    to.\r\n\r\n    'On June 6th I dined at Harcourt's Queen's Birthday dinner, and\r\n    afterwards attended Lady Granville's Foreign Office party, but these\r\n    were expiring festivities.\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, June 8th, there was a Cabinet, at which the first matter\r\n    was Irish Coercion and the proclamation clause. Spencer now offered\r\n    proclamation by the Viceroy (i.e., not by the Government in\r\n    London, which was our proposal) for all the Bill except the\r\n    intimidation part, but refused to have it for the boycotting clause.\r\n    Trevelyan now joined Chamberlain, Lefevre, and myself, in opposing\r\n    Spencer; the others supported him, but tried to make him yield. We\r\n    decided that if he yielded we should ask that a statement to the\r\n    Cabinet should be promised to precede proclamation.'\r\n\r\nOn June 8th Mr. Childers moved the second reading of his Budget Bill,\r\nwhich was met by an amendment moved by Sir Michael Hicks Beach,\r\ncondemning the proposed increase upon beer and spirits without any\r\ncorresponding increase on wine, and declining to increase the duty on\r\nreal property until promised changes were made in regard to local\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n    'I made a good debating Budget speech, of which Sir John Lambert\r\n    wrote \"In Tea, Domine, spero,\" and I replied: \"Since the time of Sir\r\n    Thomas More all these profane 'good things' have come from devout\r\n    Catholics.\"'\r\n\r\nOther leading men followed, and Mr. Gladstone summed up by saying that\r\nyou must tax either alcohol or tea and sugar. But the division went\r\nagainst him: 6 Liberals voted with the Tories, and 76 were absent. The\r\nmajority against the Government was 12. The end had at length come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nFALL OF ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nJUNE TO JULY, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 8th, as has been seen, the Government were defeated by a\r\nmajority of 12.\r\n\r\n    'On June 9th there was a further Cabinet. We had been beaten on the\r\n    Budget, but in the meantime Spencer had yielded, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    was very anxious to be able to say that we were all agreed.\r\n    Therefore we discussed a Coercion Bill in the first place, but the\r\n    four of us at once refused to agree to Spencer's concession as\r\n    sufficient.' [Footnote: Namely, that the Coercion Bill should only\r\n    have effect after a special proclamation had been issued. Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke notes, September 20th, 1891, the receipt of a letter\r\n    from Mr. Chamberlain, thanking him for extracts from his Memoir of\r\n    1884-85 on Irish affairs, and saying that where it dealt with the\r\n    same points it tallied exactly with his recollections.] 'It passes\r\n    my understanding, therefore, how Mr. Gladstone is able to pronounce,\r\n    as he has done, \"unfounded\" the statement that the Cabinet was at\r\n    odds upon the Irish question at the moment of its defeat. Three of\r\n    us had resigned on it, and our letters were in his pocket. The next\r\n    matter discussed was resignation, which did not take a minute; and\r\n    then the question of what Customs dues should be levied....\r\n\r\n    'After the Cabinet there was a levee, at which I had some\r\n    conversation with Lord Salisbury as to the Redistribution Bill in\r\n    the Lords, and his reply showed that he meant to form a Government.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 10th my discussions with Lord Salisbury as to the\r\n    Redistribution Bill were continued, and it was decided that the Bill\r\n    was to go forward in spite of the Ministerial crisis, although this\r\n    was resisted by the Fourth Party in the House of Commons.'\r\n\r\nOn the previous evening Sir Charles Dilke addressed an audience at the\r\nCity Liberal Club in a speech of unwonted passion. Confidently\r\nanticipating that the Redistribution Bill would go through in spite of\r\nany change of Ministry and the resistance of the Fourth Party, he dwelt\r\non the magnitude of the change for which he had so long wrought. But the\r\ncentral point of the speech was a eulogy of Mr Gladstone, which\r\nreflected the temper of a scene that had passed in the House of Commons\r\nthe same day, and he demanded in the name of Liberalism that the battle\r\nshould be won, 'not only with his great name, but under his actual\r\nleadership.'\r\n\r\nThis was the declaration of the Radicals against all thought of a\r\nHartington Administration. Referring to the speech, he writes:\r\n\r\n    'I was greatly congratulated on this day on a speech which I had\r\n    made at a house dinner of the City Liberal Club on the 9th.\r\n    Chamberlain wrote: \"Your speech was admirable, and I have heard from\r\n    one who was present that the effect was electrical. You never did\r\n    better in your life.\" He went on to agree with me in my wish that\r\n    Herbert Gladstone should be appointed Chief Whip for the Opposition,\r\n    and then to say that we must be very careful what we did, or \"we\r\n    shall destroy the Tory Government before it has done our work.\" I\r\n    had asked him to sit to Holl for a portrait for me, and he said that\r\n    he would do so, but that he was going to speak all over the country\r\n    in support of the unauthorized programme. He did sit, and a very\r\n    fine picture was the result.' [Footnote: Now at the National\r\n    Portrait Gallery, to which Sir Charles bequeathed it.]\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, June 13th, I presided at the Cobden Club dinner, at\r\n    which Chamberlain was also present, and our speeches attracted some\r\n    attention.' [Footnote: Sir Charles from the chair advocated\r\n    'destroying the monopoly in land,' and 'establishing an Irish\r\n    control of Irish affairs.' Chamberlain advocated 'some great measure\r\n    of devolution by which the Imperial Parliament shall retain its\r\n    supremacy, but shall nevertheless relegate to subordinate\r\n    authorities the control and administration of their local business,'\r\n    and added: 'I think it is a consolation to my right hon. friend as\r\n    well as to myself that our hands are free, and that our voices may\r\n    now be lifted up in the cause of freedom and justice.']\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, the 16th, we had a meeting of the leaders, at which\r\n    were present Lords Selborne, Northbrook, Carlingford, Derby,\r\n    Kimberley, Mr. Gladstone, Harcourt, Childers, Chamberlain, Lefevre,\r\n    and myself. Salisbury, through Arthur Balfour, had verbally asked\r\n    for (1) priority for Supply; (2) if we would, supposing that we\r\n    opposed their Budget, support them in borrowing by Exchequer Bills.\r\n    We decided to make as little reply as possible. In Winston\r\n    Churchill's Life of his father he says we promised \"facilities,\" but\r\n    we refused.'\r\n\r\n    'Randolph Churchill sounded me to know if in the event of his taking\r\n    office he could sit for Birmingham, and Chamberlain answered: \"If R.\r\n    C. takes office _without_ coercion, we should not oppose him. If\r\n    _with_, I should certainly fight to accentuate the betrayal.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the afternoon of June 16th I had a serious talk with Chamberlain\r\n    about manhood suffrage, which he had advocated in a speech, pointing\r\n    out to him that this question of manhood as against adult suffrage\r\n    (i.e., including women) was the only one on which we differed, and\r\n    the only question which seemed likely to divide us. The outcome of\r\n    our talk was that we should postpone as long as possible the\r\n    inevitable difference, and make it last as short a time as possible\r\n    by postponing it till the very moment when the thing was likely to\r\n    be carried. When the time came that our people should be raving for\r\n    manhood suffrage, and that I should have to join the Tories in\r\n    carrying adult suffrage as against it, I might, if in office, have\r\n    to go out by myself, but this could not be avoided.' [Footnote: A\r\n    memorandum on this subject by Sir Charles, published by the Society\r\n    for Promoting Adult Suffrage, in the last years of his life, is\r\n    quoted on p. 409 of this volume.]\r\n\r\n    'On the 16th, also, I wrote to Grant Duff that there was \"no liking\r\n    for Ireland or the Irish,\" but \"an almost universal feeling now in\r\n    both parties that some form of Home Rule must be tried. My own\r\n    belief is that it will be tried too late, as all our remedies have\r\n    been.\"\r\n\r\n    'I told him how I had written to solicit a peerage for him, and that\r\n    the Liberals would be in office again in \"January,\" and when his\r\n    term of office was to expire--a true prophecy.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 18th there was another Cabinet of the outgoing Ministers,\r\n    although Hartington and Lord Granville were not present. There were\r\n    present Mr. Gladstone, Lord Selborne, Carlingford, Northbrook,\r\n    Kimberley, Derby, Rosebery, Harcourt, Childers, Trevelyan, Lefevre,\r\n    Chamberlain, and myself. Mr. Gladstone had heard on the previous\r\n    night from the Queen, enclosing a letter from Lord Salisbury to her,\r\n    asking for an undertaking that we would support him on his Budget\r\n    and in Supply, as he could not now dissolve. We again refused to\r\n    give any but very general assurances.\r\n\r\n    'On June 19th, Randolph Churchill having blown up Northcote' (who\r\n    had been removed to the Upper House), 'and shown his power by making\r\n    himself Dictator, now wished for freedom and some excuse for\r\n    preventing the formation of a Government, and a curious letter from\r\n    him was forwarded to me by Chamberlain. In Chamberlain's covering\r\n    letter there is the first allusion to our proposed tour in Ireland.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, June 20th, there was a last Cabinet or \"full meeting\"\r\n    of outgoing Ministers, all being present except Spencer and our two\r\n    racing men--Hartington and Rosebery. We further considered the\r\n    question of \"assurances,\" at the renewed suggestion of the Queen,\r\n    and finally declined to give them. Though this was called as a\r\n    Cabinet, Mrs. Gladstone was in the room. Saturday to Monday I spent\r\n    in a last visit to the smallpox camp at Darenth. On Monday, the\r\n    22nd, I made a fighting speech at a meeting at the Welsh chapel in\r\n    Radnor Street at Chelsea; [Footnote: The speech advocated not merely\r\n    Home Rule, but Home Rule all round. Sir Charles expressed a wish to\r\n    \"study in Ireland a plan for the devolution to Welsh, Scottish, and\r\n    Irish bodies of much business which Parliament is incompetent to\r\n    discharge, and which at the present time is badly done or not done\r\n    at all.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The principles of decentralization which ought to be applied are\r\n    clear to those who know the two kingdoms and the Principality, but\r\n    the details must be studied on the spot. As regards Wales and\r\n    Scotland, no great controversial questions are likely to arise. But\r\n    as regards the Irish details, it is the intention of Mr. Chamberlain\r\n    and myself to inquire in Ireland of those who know Ireland best.\r\n    Officials in Ireland, contrary to public belief, are many of them in\r\n    favour of decentralization, but still more are the Bishops and\r\n    clergy of various denominations, legal authorities, and the like.\r\n    Some writers who have recently attacked a proposal which has been\r\n    made to abolish in Ireland what is known as 'Dublin Castle' are\r\n    unaware, apparently, of the fact that not only officials of the\r\n    highest experience, and many statesmen on both sides who know\r\n    Ireland well, are agreed on the necessity for the abolition, but\r\n    that those who have had the most recent experience in the office of\r\n    Viceroy are themselves sharers in the decentralization view which\r\n    now prevails.\"] and on Wednesday, June 24th, I left my office.\r\n\r\n    'My successor was Arthur Balfour, and I initiated him into the\r\n    business of the Local Government Board at his request, after a first\r\n    interview at Sloane Street. As late as June 21st Harcourt had made\r\n    up his mind that the Tories would be unable to form a Government,\r\n    and that it was his painful duty to come back; and he wrote to me\r\n    that he had informed Mr. Gladstone that \"I would stand by him if he\r\n    agreed to come back _whatever might happen_.\" Chamberlain wrote on\r\n    this that it was impossible if Spencer remained. \"It will be bad for\r\n    us and for the settlement of the Irish question.\"\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain and I were now intending to visit Ireland, but Manning\r\n    declined to give us letters, and wrote on June 25th: \"What am I to\r\n    do? I am afraid of your Midlothian in Ireland. How can I be\r\n    godfather to Hengist and Horsa?\" I replied:\r\n\r\n    '\"Dear Cardinal Manning,\r\n\r\n    '\"I fear I have made myself far from clear. You speak of a\r\n    Midlothian. I should not for a moment have dreamt of asking you for\r\n    letters had not that been most carefully guarded against. We are not\r\n    going to make a single speech or to attend any dinner, meeting, or\r\n    reception, in any part of Ireland. Our journey is private, and our\r\n    wish is to visit the Catholic Archbishops and Bishops and to find\r\n    out what they want. It has sprung from your own suggestion, and from\r\n    my conversation, held also at your suggestion, with Dr. Walsh. It\r\n    would not conduce to any possibility of settlement and of future\r\n    peace if, after proposing, at your suggestion, to go to men like the\r\n    Archbishops Croke and Walsh, we should have to state that we\r\n    renounce our visit because they refuse to receive us. You know what\r\n    passed as to Dr. Walsh, and you know that if Mr. Gladstone had\r\n    reformed his Government we had made that matter one of our\r\n    conditions. Surely that was pretty clear evidence of our desire to\r\n    act with you in a matter which is certainly above all party. But it\r\n    is 'now or never.'\"\r\n\r\n    'On the same day Chamberlain wrote proposing that we should meet\r\n    Trevelyan and Lefevre at fixed and short intervals to produce\r\n    concerted action, and consulting me as to whether we should include\r\n    Morley. The first consultation took place at my Royal Commission\r\n    office at noon on July 4th, and Morley was present as well as\r\n    Trevelyan, and I think Lefevre.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 27th I had a last fight with Mr. Gladstone. The outgoing\r\n    Government had given a baronetcy to Errington, personally my friend,\r\n    but a baronetcy given under circumstances which I thought\r\n    politically discreditable, and I protested strongly. I told Mr.\r\n    Gladstone that it had long been my opinion that there is\r\n    insufficient consultation of the opinion of the party, as well as of\r\n    Cabinets and ex-Cabinets, on questions of the deepest moment. \"For\r\n    example, since I have been a member of the 'Inner Circle,' many\r\n    decisions of the gravest moment as to Irish affairs have been taken\r\n    without reference to the general opinion of the leaders or of the\r\n    party. When Mr. Forster first induced Lord Granville to give letters\r\n    to Mr. Errington, I stated my own view in favour of the appointment\r\n    of an official representative of this country to the Roman Church,\r\n    if there was work which must be done between the Government and that\r\n    Church. I always protested against the secret arrangement, and the\r\n    last straw has been the resistance to Walsh.\" Such was my private\r\n    note.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote: \"Mr. G. has yielded to Lord G., and has done an\r\n    act unfair to us and without notice. I have seen O'Shea. I think the\r\n    'visit' may yet be all right.\" I wrote to Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    '\"I feel bound to express my dismay at seeing this day that honours\r\n    have been conferred on that excellent fellow Errington at a moment\r\n    when it will be felt by the great majority of people who do not see\r\n    round corners that he is rewarded for the fight made by him on\r\n    behalf of the defeated policy of resistance to the selection as\r\n    Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin of the accomplished gentleman on\r\n    whom the whole Irish Roman Catholic clergy and people had set their\r\n    hearts. I have already described to Lord Granville in your presence\r\n    what I thought the fatal results of this policy of interference\r\n    against a unanimous Irish sentiment in the choice of the great Roman\r\n    Catholic dignitaries in Ireland--a policy which has, in the belief\r\n    of the thoughtful men of all parties, among whom I may name\r\n    privately the new Lord Chancellor of Ireland, [Footnote: Mr. Gibson,\r\n    afterwards created Lord Ashbourne.] undone the effects of your Land\r\n    Acts of 1871 and 1881, and made the resistance to the Union stronger\r\n    and more unanimous than it ever was before. Surely such an intention\r\n    as that to specially honour Mr. Errington at such a moment might\r\n    have been named to me when I so strongly expressed before you and\r\n    Lord Granville my opinion of the policy. Mr. Forster, the initiator\r\n    of the Errington policy, has returned to the Liberal front bench,\r\n    and sat next to me there. I fear I must take the opportunity of\r\n    leaving it, as I do not see how I can fail to express the opinion I\r\n    hold of the conferring of special honour at such a moment on Mr.\r\n    Errington.\" [Footnote: A letter from Mr. Gladstone to Mr, Errington,\r\n    dated June 30th, 1885, is given in the _Life of Granville_, vol.\r\n    ii., p. 292.]\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone replied:\r\n\r\n    '\"1, Richmond Terrace,\r\n\r\n    '\"_June 27th_, 1885.\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"I feel that the coincidence of the Walsh appointment with the\r\n    Errington baronetcy is unfortunate, but I think that the grant of\r\n    the baronetcy or of something in that sense is unavoidable. I regard\r\n    Gibson's confidential disclosure to you as an absurd exaggeration\r\n    indulged in for party purposes. The policy, and any ingratitude to\r\n    an agent of it, are wholly different matters; and your disapproval\r\n    of the first never conveyed to my mind the idea of speaking to you\r\n    about the second. You are aware of the immense stress laid by\r\n    Spencer on the Errington mission, which Granville more traditionally\r\n    (as I think) supported. For my part, I never did more than acquiesce\r\n    in it, and I think it highly probable that no such thing will be\r\n    renewed. As to 'diplomatic relations' with the Pope, I am entirely\r\n    opposed to them.\r\n\r\n    '\"Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    '\"W. E.

He began with a\r\n    laugh: \"I am popular with all parties. Whose congratulations do you\r\n    think were the first that I received?\" A happy inspiration struck\r\n    me, and I at once answered \"Walsh\"--a lucky guess which completely\r\n    puzzled him, for he said, \"Who told you?\"\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote the next day: \"Reflection confirms me in the\r\n    opinion that Mr. Gladstone has not treated us well. I cannot resist\r\n    the conclusion that on both occasions he concealed his intentions,\r\n    knowing that we disapproved of them, and in order to force our\r\n    hands. I would cordially join in a protest against this, although,\r\n    as I have already told you, I do not think the last proceeding--in\r\n    the matter of Errington--will justify a formal secession. People\r\n    generally, especially in the country, cannot understand the\r\n    importance of the matter, and would not back up our quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain, writing on June 27th or 28th, [Footnote: It was on\r\n    June 17th that Mr. Chamberlain had delivered his famous denunciation\r\n    of Dublin Castle, and had declared that \"the pacification of Ireland\r\n    depends, I believe, on the concession to Ireland of the right to\r\n    govern itself in the matter of its purely domestic government.\" He\r\n    went on to speak of an Irishman being at every step controlled by\r\n    \"an English official, appointed by a foreign Government.\"] said: \"On\r\n    the greatest issue between us and the Whigs Mr. G. is on our side,\r\n    and has told Harcourt that if he stands at the General Election he\r\n    will make this a prominent feature in his platform, and will adopt\r\n    in principle our scheme--Local Government and devolution. This will\r\n    immensely strengthen our position if we finally decide to press the\r\n    matter. I say 'if' because I wait to have more positive assurances\r\n    as to Parnell's present attitude. If he throws us over, I do not\r\n    believe that we can go farther at present, but O'Shea remains\r\n    confident that matters will come right.\"'\r\n\r\nOn June 29th, Sir Charles replied to Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    'Harcourt, Chamberlain, and Lefevre, have all lectured me, and the\r\n    former tells me that you have accepted a proposal to stand again for\r\n    Midlothian. This is so great a thing that smaller ones must not be\r\n    allowed to make even small discords, so please put my letter of\r\n    Saturday in the fire, and forgive me for having put you to the\r\n    trouble of reading and replying to it. I fancy that overwork and\r\n    long-continued loss of all holidays except Sundays have told upon\r\n    me, and that I must be inclined to take too serious a view of\r\n    things.\r\n\r\n    'Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    'Charles W. Dilke.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 30th Chamberlain wrote: \"Ireland. I heard some days ago\r\n    from the Duchess of St. Albans, and replied that we would certainly\r\n    call if anywhere in her neighbourhood\" (near Clonmel). \"Next time I\r\n    see you we may make some progress with our plans. I have a most\r\n    satisfactory letter from Davitt--voluntary on his part, and assuring\r\n    us that _United Ireland_ [Footnote: _United Ireland_, then edited by\r\n    Mr. William O'Brien and Mr. T. M. Healy, discouraged the visit.]\r\n    does not represent the views of the Nationalist party.

But the\r\n    decisive attitude was that of Mr. Parnell, whose power was then\r\n    paramount, not only in Cork, but throughout all Ireland. He\r\n    discussed the project with one of his colleagues, Mr. John O'Connor,\r\n    to whom he expressed the view that Mr. Chamberlain was aspiring to\r\n    replace Mr. Gladstone in the leadership, and that he would do\r\n    nothing which could assist him in this purpose, because he thought\r\n    that he \"could squeeze more out of Gladstone than he could out of\r\n    Chamberlain.\"] I shall reply rather effusively. I cannot altogether\r\n    acquit Parnell of duplicity. I think he fears our visit, and that we\r\n    may cut him out. I am sure that neither he nor anyone else will\r\n    succeed in boycotting us.

I\r\n    am assured that we (the Radicals) never held so strong a position--\r\n    that the counties will be swept for the Liberals, and that the whole\r\n    atmosphere of the House of Commons will be changed after November. I\r\n    firmly believe that this is true. A little patience, and we shall\r\n    secure all we have fought for.'\r\n\r\n    'On June 30th I wrote fully to Mrs. Pattison, who was ill of typhoid\r\n    in the Madras hills, but without my yet knowing it. \"I've been\r\n    thinking over grave words I would say to you about politics.\" I went\r\n    on to say that politics were not to me amusement. \"I could not have\r\n    heart to live such a life at all if the religion of life did not\r\n    surround my politics. I chat the chatter about persons and ambitions\r\n    that others chat, and, in my perpetual brain fatigue, shirk the\r\n    trouble of trying to put into words thoughts which I fancy you must\r\n    exactly share. How can you share them if you are never shown they're\r\n    there? Dear Lady, please to try and feel, however unable I am to\r\n    express it, that my life is now one, and that there are not things\r\n    to pick among, and things to be cast aside, but duties only, which\r\n    are pleasures in the doing of them well, and which you must help me\r\n    do. It is in old age that power comes. An old man in English\r\n    politics may exert enormous power without effort, and with no drain\r\n    at all upon his health and vital force. The work of thirty or forty\r\n    years of political life goes in England to the building-up of\r\n    political reputation and position. During that long period no power\r\n    is exercised except by irregular means, such as the use of threats\r\n    of resignation. It is in old age only that power comes that can be\r\n    used legitimately and peacefully by the once-strong man. I'm still\r\n    young enough, and have of illusions yearly crops sufficient to\r\n    believe that it can be used for good, and that it is a plain duty so\r\n    to use it, and I would not remain in political life did I not think\r\n    so.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nOUT OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nJULY, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Salisbury had formed, in June, 1885, what was called the\r\n'stop-gap Government,' charged with carrying on business till the\r\nGeneral Election fixed for the following winter, the heads of the\r\nLiberal party began to mature their plans. It soon became evident that\r\nthe cardinal fact to be decided was whether Mr. Gladstone should\r\ncontinue to lead. This, again, was found to depend upon the policy\r\nadopted in relation to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Question was at the moment in an extraordinary position. Lord\r\nSalisbury had appointed Lord Carnarvon, a known sympathizer with Home\r\nRule, as Viceroy. Further, the Tory leaders in the House of Commons were\r\nrefusing to take any responsibility for the actions of Lord Spencer,\r\nwhich were challenged especially in regard to the verdict upon one of\r\nthe men sentenced for the Maamtrasna murders. This put Sir Charles and\r\nMr. Chamberlain, who had always disapproved the policy of coercion, in a\r\nvery difficult position, the more difficult because Mr. Trevelyan, a\r\nmember of their inner Radical group, was jointly concerned with Lord\r\nSpencer to defend these actions.\r\n\r\n    'On July 4th I received from Maynooth a letter of thanks from Dr.\r\n    Walsh for my congratulations on his appointment to the Archbishopric\r\n    of Dublin, and he expressed the hope that we should meet in Dublin\r\n    when I came over with Chamberlain. On the same day, Saturday, July\r\n    4th, there took place at noon at my office a meeting of Chamberlain,\r\n    Trevelyan, Lefevre, John Morley, and myself, in which we discussed\r\n    the proposed mission of Wolff to Egypt, resolving that we would\r\n    oppose it unless the Conservative Government should drop it. We were\r\n    wrong, for it afterwards turned out that they meant evacuation. Next\r\n    the proposed movement on Dongola, which we did not believe to be\r\n    seriously intended; then the proposal to increase the wine duty,\r\n    which I was able to announce (on Foreign Office information) that I\r\n    knew that Lord Salisbury would drop; then the succession duties,\r\n    with regard to which we decided to support a motion to be brought\r\n    forward by Dillwyn; then police enfranchisement, we deciding that I\r\n    was to move an instruction on going into Committee to extend the\r\n    Bill, so as to shorten the period of residence for all electors.'\r\n\r\n    'Before we separated we discussed the inquiry proposed by the Irish\r\n    members into the Maamtrasna business. Trevelyan thought that he was\r\n    obliged in honour to speak against inquiry, but we decided that he\r\n    must not press for a division in resistance to the Irish demand.'\r\n\r\n    'On Monday, July 6th, I presided over my Royal Commission in the\r\n    morning, and in the evening dined at Grillion's Club. In the\r\n    afternoon Mr. Gladstone sent for me, and told me that whether he\r\n    would lead that party or would not, at the dissolution, or in the\r\n    new Parliament, would depend on whether the main plank in the\r\n    programme was what I called Home Rule or what Chamberlain called the\r\n    National Council scheme, or only the ordinary scheme of Local\r\n    Government for all parts of the United Kingdom. If the latter alone\r\n    was to be contemplated, he said that others would suffice for the\r\n    task. Parnell's acquiescence in the Home Rule scheme he thought\r\n    essential. If Parnell, having got more from the Tories, was going to\r\n    oppose, he, Mr. Gladstone, could not go on: and he evidently thought\r\n    that I should have the means of discovering what would be Parnell's\r\n    attitude. Parnell had, of course, been for what I believe was really\r\n    his own scheme, suggested to Chamberlain by O'Shea. But he was now\r\n    in league with R. Churchill and Lord Carnarvon. I advised Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to deal directly with Parnell, but he said that he would\r\n    not, and I noted in my diary that he and Parnell were equally\r\n    tortuous in their methods. Mr. Gladstone, failing me, as he said,\r\n    would deal with Grosvenor and Mrs. O'Shea. But it was clear to me\r\n    that he had already tried this channel.'\r\n\r\n    'On the next day I received interesting letters from Dr. Walsh and\r\n    Sir Frederick Roberts. The latter completely destroyed the foolish\r\n    War Office plan of preparing for a campaign in the Black Sea, and\r\n    once more laid down the principle that England must go to war with\r\n    Russia rather than permit her to occupy any portion of Afghanistan\r\n    in face of our interest and of our pledge to the contrary.\r\n\r\n    'Dr. Walsh wrote that in going to Rome he was by no means determined\r\n    to accept the archbishopric. \"I am not Archbishop; acceptance is an\r\n    essential point, and I have a view of certain matters to set before\r\n    His Holiness before that stage is reached. I have sent on to Rome a\r\n    written statement of my views, that the matter may be considered\r\n    before I arrive there. I am thoroughly convinced that there is\r\n    another position in which I could be far more useful both for Church\r\n    and country. The Archbishopric of Dublin, now that it can be dealt\r\n    with as a purely ecclesiastical matter, can be very easily provided\r\n    for.\"\r\n\r\n    'I suppose that Dr. Walsh wished to be Papal Legate. He went on to\r\n    say:\r\n\r\n    '\"As to the Bishops you should see, I would say, in the South, as\r\n    you begin there, Cashel and Limerick (Cloyne, unfortunately, is very\r\n    deaf; otherwise I should like you to meet him). In the West,\r\n    _Galway_, Elphin, Achonry. In the North, Raphoe (of whom Mr.\r\n    Childers can tell you something), Clogher, Ardagh, Meath, and Down\r\n    and Connor. In this province of Dublin our Bishops are either very\r\n    old or very young in the episcopacy: they could not give you much\r\n    information. All I have mentioned are generally on the popular side.\r\n    Of those on the less popular or nonpopular side, we have Cork,\r\n    Kerry, and _Coadjutor of Clonfert_. Clonfert himself is on the most\r\n    advanced National lines. But his views are rather general. It might\r\n    be well to see him. He is a great admirer of Davitt's.\r\n\r\n    '\"I remain, my dear Sir Charles,\r\n    '\"Sincerely yours,\r\n    '\"William J. Walsh.\"\r\n\r\n    'I sent this letter to Chamberlain, who replied that it was very\r\n    satisfactory.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, July 11th, we had another meeting of our \"party,\" I\r\n    again being in the chair, Chamberlain, Lefevre, and John Morley,\r\n    being present, and Trevelyan absent. We decided that Chamberlain,\r\n    Lefevre, and Dilke should see Mr. Gladstone as to the Maamtrasna\r\n    inquiry, in which we were strongly opposed to Spencer. With regard\r\n    to the organization of the Liberal party, which meant the adoption\r\n    of Schnadhorst by the party, Chamberlain, Lefevre, and Dilke, were\r\n    also to see Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday evening I went down to Dockett, where I stayed till\r\n    Monday, Cyril Flower spending with me the day of Sunday, July 12th.\r\n    On Monday, July 13th, I again presided at my Royal Commission, and\r\n    again dined at Grillion's.\r\n\r\n    'On the same day Chamberlain, Lefevre, and I, saw Mr. Gladstone.\r\n    After talking over Maamtrasna, I repeated a statement which O'Shea\r\n    had made to me, namely, that Fottrell [Footnote: Sir Charles, during\r\n    his visit to Dublin, had been much impressed by Mr. Fottrell, who\r\n    had acted as intermediary between the Castle and the Nationalists\r\n    (see p. 140). He wrote to Mrs. Pattison that Mr. Fottrell and Sir\r\n    Robert Hamilton were the only two men who counted in that city.] had\r\n    had a two-hours interview with Randolph Churchill on Home Rule. I\r\n    also informed Mr. Gladstone that O'Shea had shown me a letter from\r\n    Alfred Austin,' (afterwards Poet Laureate) 'a hot Tory leader-writer\r\n    on the _Standard_, asking to be introduced to Parnell for the\r\n    benefit of the country. Lefevre having gone away, Chamberlain and I\r\n    talked with Mr. Gladstone as to organization. It was decided that we\r\n    should have an interview with him on the subject (Grosvenor to be\r\n    present) the next day.\r\n\r\n    'I was going out a good deal this week, and on the Wednesday was at\r\n    parties at Lady Salisbury's, at the Austrian Embassy, and at the\r\n    Duchess of Westminster's, and at one of them met Harcourt and\r\n    arranged for a meeting on Thursday, July 16th, at my Commission\r\n    office in Parliament Street, with Chamberlain and Harcourt, to\r\n    discuss Schnadhorst; Harcourt favouring our view that he should be\r\n    adopted by the party, which was done, and the National Liberal\r\n    Federation installed at Parliament Street. But the Whips \"captured\"\r\n    it! On Friday, July 17th, Chamberlain and his son dined with me to\r\n    meet Harcourt and Gray of the Irish party and _Freeman's Journal_.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, July 18th, we had our usual cabal, Trevelyan being\r\n    again absent, and the same four present as on the previous Saturday.\r\n    We discussed the proposed Royal Commission on the depression of\r\n    trade; land purchase, Ireland; party organization; and the land\r\n    question.\r\n\r\n    'On July 22nd I heard from Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    '\"1, Richmond Terrace,\r\n\r\n    '\"_July 21st,_ 1885.\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"I cannot forbear writing to express the hope that you and\r\n    Chamberlain may be able to say or do something to remove the\r\n    appearance now presented to the world of a disposition on your parts\r\n    to sever yourselves from the executive, and especially from the\r\n    judicial administration of Ireland as it was carried on by Spencer\r\n    under the late Government. You may question my title to attempt\r\n    interference with your free action by the expression of such a hope,\r\n    and I am not careful to assure you in this matter or certain that I\r\n    can make good such a title in argument. But we have been for five\r\n    years in the same boat, on most troubled waters, without having\r\n    during the worst three years of the five a single man of the company\r\n    thrown overboard. I have _never_ in my life known the bonds of union\r\n    so strained by the pure stress of circumstances; a good intent on\r\n    all sides has enabled them to hold. Is there any reason why at this\r\n    moment they should part? A rupture may come on questions of future\r\n    policy; I am not sure that it will. But if it is to arrive, let it\r\n    come in the course of nature as events develop themselves. At the\r\n    present moment there appears to be set up an idea of difference\r\n    about matters which lie in the past, and for which we are all\r\n    plenarily responsible. The position is settled in all its elements,\r\n    and cannot be altered. The frightful discredit with which the new\r\n    Government has covered itself by its treatment of Spencer has drawn\r\n    attention away from the signs of at least passive discord among us,\r\n    signs which might otherwise have drawn upon us pretty sharp\r\n    criticism. It appears to me that hesitation on the part of any of us\r\n    as to our own responsibility for Spencer's acts can only be\r\n    mischievous to the party and the late Cabinet, but will and must be\r\n    far more mischievous to any who may betray such disinclination. Even\r\n    with the Irish party it can, I imagine, do nothing to atone for past\r\n    offences, inasmuch as it is but a negative proceeding; while from\r\n    Randolph, Hicks Beach, and Gorst, positive support is to be had in\r\n    what I cannot but consider a foolish as well as guilty crusade\r\n    against the administration of criminal justice in Ireland; which may\r\n    possibly be defective, but, with all its defects, whatever they may\r\n    be, is, I apprehend, the only defence of the life and property of\r\n    the poor. It will be the legislation of the future, and not this\r\n    most unjust attack upon Spencer, which will have to determine\r\n    hereafter your relations with Ireland, and the 'National' party. I\r\n    may be wrong, but it seems to me easy, and in some ways\r\n    advantageous, to say: 'My mind is open to consider at large any\r\n    proposals acceptable to Ireland for the development and security of\r\n    her liberties, but I will not sap the foundations of order and of\r\n    public right by unsettling rules, common to all parties, under which\r\n    criminal justice has been continuously administered, and dragging\r\n    for the first time the prerogative of mercy within the vortex of\r\n    party conflict.' I dare say I may have said too much in the way of\r\n    argument on a matter which seems to me hardly to call for argument,\r\n    but a naked suggestion would have appeared even less considerate\r\n    than the letter which I have written, prompted by strong feeling and\r\n    clear conviction.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n    '\"W. E. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\n    'I sent the letter to Chamberlain, asking whether he thought he\r\n    could say at Hackney, where he was about to speak, anything\r\n    flattering to Spencer, and he replied: \"I am not certain that I\r\n    shall say anything about Spencer; at most it would be only a\r\n    personal tribute.\"'\r\n\r\nWith these words ends the story of Sir Charles Dilke's official\r\nrelations with his party.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back on that story, Sir George Trevelyan writes: 'I never knew a\r\nman of his age--hardly ever a man of any age--more powerful and admired\r\nthan was Dilke during his management of the Redistribution Bill in\r\n1885.' This influence had been built up by the long years of sustained\r\nwork, of which the story has been told in his own words.\r\n\r\nHe combined two unusual characteristics: he was one of the Radical\r\nleaders at home, and he also carried extraordinary authority on the\r\nsubject of foreign affairs both here and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe depth of his convictions as a Radical is attested by a note to Mr.\r\nFrank Hill, [Footnote: Undated, but evidently written about this time.]\r\neditor of the _Daily News_: 'As a _man_ I feel going out on this\r\noccasion very much indeed, but Chamberlain and I are trustees for\r\nothers, and from the point of view of English Radicalism I have no\r\ndoubt.' Yet Radicalism never fettered his capacity for working with all\r\nmen for the great questions which are beyond party, and uniting their\r\nefforts on big issues of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt was this gift which frequently made him more the spokesman of the\r\nHouse of Commons than of party in Government counsels. The approval of\r\nthe House of Commons was, in his opinion, essential to the development\r\nof foreign policy, and his views as to the undesirability of unnecessary\r\nconcealment were strong. While recognizing that everything could not be\r\ndisclosed, he thought that the House of Commons should be in the\r\nGovernment's confidence as far as possible in diplomatic relations, and\r\nhe looked on the tendency to surround all official proceedings with\r\nsecrecy as more worthy of a bureaucrat than a statesman. Bismarck, Dilke\r\nsaid in 1876, was the diplomatist of foreign Europe who was never\r\nbelieved because he told the truth. He had no sympathy with the\r\nisolation of Great Britain, which had been a feature of our policy\r\nduring his early career. But when Lord Beaconsfield would have plunged\r\ninto a war with Russia in 1878, without an ally or a friend, he opposed\r\nthat policy as suicidal. Of that policy he said at that time: 'English\r\nRadicals of the present day do not bound their sympathies by the Channel\r\n... a Europe without England is as incomplete, and as badly balanced,\r\nand as heavily weighted against freedom, as that which I, two years ago,\r\ndenounced to you--a Europe without France. The time may come when\r\nEngland will have to fight for her existence, but for Heaven's sake let\r\nus not commit the folly of plunging into war at a moment when all Europe\r\nwould be hostile to our armies--not one Power allied to the English\r\ncause.' [Footnote: Vol. I., Chapter XVI., p. 239.] The keynote of his\r\npolicy was friendship with France. His experience in the Franco-German\r\nWar had for ever changed the friendly impression which led him first to\r\nfollow the German forces into the field.\r\n\r\nGermany at war and Germany in a conquered country taught him in 1870-71\r\na lesson never to be forgotten, and affected his whole attitude to that\r\nGreat Power. It has been seen how in the eighties he opposed, to the\r\npoint of contemplated resignation of office, the Governmental tendency\r\nto accept German aggression--'to lie down' under it, as he said; and he\r\nfought for the retention of the New Guinea Coast and Zanzibar in\r\n1884-85, as later he fought against Lord Salisbury as to the surrender\r\nof Heligoland. [Footnote: _Present Position of European Politics_, p.\r\n242.]\r\n\r\nIt was this courage as well as consistency of policy that bound Gambetta\r\nto him, and made Bismarck wish that he should be sent to Berlin at a\r\ncritical moment in 1885 'to have a talk.'

He was still\r\nyoung, not having completed his forty-second year; in the Cabinet only\r\nLord Rosebery was his junior; he had seventeen years of unremitting\r\nParliamentary service to his credit, and in the House of Commons his\r\nprestige was extraordinary. His own judgment and that of all skilled\r\nobservers regarded his party's abandonment of office as temporary: the\r\nGeneral Election would inevitably bring them back with a new lease of\r\npower, and with an Administration reorganized in such fashion that the\r\nRadicals would no longer find themselves overbalanced in the shaping of\r\npolicy. The Dilke-Chamberlain alliance, which had during the past five\r\nyears been increasingly influential, would in the next Parliament become\r\nopenly authoritative; and, as matters looked at the moment, it was Sir\r\nCharles, and not Mr. Chamberlain, who seemed likely to take the foremost\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nChamberlain's dazzling popular success had been of the kind to which a\r\ncertain unpopularity attaches. Moderate men of both parties were prone\r\nto impute it to demagogism, and Dilke was in the fortunate position of\r\nseeing those Radical principles for which he stood advocated by his ally\r\nwith a force of combined invective and argument which has had few\r\nparallels in political history, while to him fell the task, suited to\r\nhis temperament, of reasoned discussion. Those who denounced\r\nChamberlain's vehemence could hardly fail to point a comparison with\r\nDilke's unfailing courtesy, his steady adherence to argument, his\r\navoidance of the appeal to passion. Some strong natures have the quality\r\nof making enemies, some the gift for making friends, outside their own\r\nimmediate circle, and Sir Charles Dilke possessed the more genial\r\nendowment.\r\n\r\nThis capacity for engendering good-will in those whom he encountered\r\ncertainly did not spring from any undue respect of persons. Members of\r\nthe Royal Family, whose privileges he had assailed, were constant in\r\ntheir friendliness; high Tories such as Lord Salisbury, whose principles\r\nhe combated on every platform, liked him, and were not slow to show it.\r\nOn the other hand, the friendship which Sir Charles inspired did not\r\nproceed, as is sometimes the case, from a mere casual bounty of nature.\r\nIn Parliament his colleagues liked him, but this, assuredly, was not\r\nwithout cause. No member of the Ministry had given so much service\r\noutside his own department. Lord Granville wrote at this time: 'I have\r\nnot seen you alone since the smash, or I should have told you how much I\r\nfeel the support you have given me both when we were together at the\r\nF.O. and quite as much since. I shall not soon forget it.' Sir William\r\nHarcourt at the Home Office, Sir Henry James in the conduct of the\r\nCorrupt Practices Bill, had been beholden to him for no ordinary\r\nassistance. Moreover, as he was good to work with, so he was good to\r\nwork under. Those who served him at the Local Government Board remember\r\nhim as in no way prompt to praise; but if a suggestion was made to him,\r\nhe never failed to identify it with the suggester, recognizing its\r\nsource in adopting it. If he made a mistake and was set right, he\r\nadmitted his error--a trait very rare in Ministers, who feel that they\r\nhave constantly as amateurs to direct the decision of experts, and are\r\ntherefore chary of such admissions. Sir Charles always gave his men\r\ntheir due, and he took care that they should not be treated as machines.\r\nWhen colleagues called on him at his office, and found him with one of\r\nhis staff, he never allowed the subordinate to be ignored in greetings.\r\nThe Minister in a hurry would be stopped with, 'I think you know\r\nSo-and-so.' These are small matters to set down, but by such small\r\nthings men indicate their nature; and one of the oldest servants in that\r\noffice summed up the matter in a sentence which is not the less\r\ninteresting because it brings in another name. 'When Sir Charles Dilke\r\nwas at the Local Government Board,' he said, 'the feeling towards the\r\nPresident, from the heads of departments down to the messengers in the\r\nhall, was the same as it was in the time of Mr. Walter Long, and I can\r\nsay no more than that.'\r\n\r\nNobody, perhaps, has a better right to be counted fortunate than a man\r\nwho can feel that he is strong, that he is liked, and that he is\r\nsuccessfully promoting principles of government for his fellow-\r\ncountrymen in which he sincerely believes. In July, 1885, Sir Charles\r\nDilke had all these grounds for satisfaction, and in no common measure.\r\nOf course there were anxieties, politically speaking; Mr. Gladstone's\r\nfuture course of action was uncertain, and Mr. Gladstone was so great a\r\nforce that he might at any time derange all calculations--as, in point\r\nof fact, he did. Still, time was on the side of the Radicals, and from\r\nday to day they held what they called 'cabals' of the group formed by\r\nChamberlain, Shaw-Lefevre, Trevelyan, Morley, and Dilke himself. At\r\nthese meetings Sir Charles regularly presided.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Commission on Housing was in its last stages; its\r\nchairman was able to announce on July 1st, when laying the foundation-\r\nstone of some artisans' dwellings in Hoxton, that the Commission's Bill\r\nwould be introduced in the Lords by Lord Salisbury, and that he himself\r\nwould have charge of it in the Commons. For a man who had so laboured\r\nduring the past five years such duties as these were child's play, and\r\nSir Charles was able for the first time for many months to take his\r\nshare in social enjoyments. He dined repeatedly at Grillion's; he went\r\nto parties at famous houses both of his political allies and political\r\nopponents; above all, he found time for restful days upon his beloved\r\nriver. He went to Henley in that July with his old rowing comrade\r\nSteavenson 'to see Bristowe's fine Trinity Hall eight'; he spent Sunday,\r\nJuly 12th, at Dockett in company with Mr. Cyril Flower; and for the next\r\nSunday, the 19th, he was engaged to be at Taplow Court with Mr. W. H.\r\nGrenfell, famous among oarsmen. But of that day more has to be written.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month one dark cloud had hung over him: Mrs. Pattison was\r\ngrievously ill in the Madras hills, and not until the fourth week in\r\nJuly did he know even the nature of her illness. It was typhoid, and it\r\nleft her weak to face what had to come, like a 'bolt from the blue,'\r\nupon her and her future husband. Her first marriage had brought her\r\ndiscipline rather than happiness; now in the middle years of life her\r\nvivid nature was blossoming out again in the promise of union with a man\r\nbefore whom there lay open an illustrious career. Illness struck her\r\ndown, and while she lay convalescent there came to her as black a\r\nmessage as ever tried the heart of any woman.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Saturday, July 18th, Sir Charles Dilke was entertained\r\nat a dinner given by the Reform Club--a very rare distinction--to\r\ncelebrate the passing of the Redistribution Bill into law. From this\r\nceremony, which crowned and recognized his greatest personal\r\nachievement, he returned late, and found at his house a letter from an\r\nold family friend who asked him to call on the following Sunday morning\r\non grave business. He then learnt that the wife of a Liberal member of\r\nParliament had volunteered a 'confession' to her husband, in which she\r\nstated that she had been unfaithful to him with Sir Charles immediately\r\nafter her marriage.\r\n\r\nHis note in his private diary on Sunday is: '19th.--Early heard of the\r\ncharge against me. Put myself in hands of J. B. Balfour, and afterwards\r\nof Chamberlain and James.'\r\n\r\nLater Sir Charles Dilke went down to Taplow, and spent the day there.\r\nThis accusation found him separated from his future wife by many\r\nthousand miles; worse than that, she had been dangerously ill; the risk\r\nto her of a telegraphed message must be great; yet there was the chance\r\nfrom day to day that newspaper rumour might anticipate direct tidings\r\nfrom him to her. He was 'in as great misery as perhaps ever fell upon a\r\nman.'\r\n\r\nHe returned next morning to preside at the last meeting of the\r\nCommission on Housing, when, he says, 'the Prince of Wales proposed a\r\nvote of thanks to me in an extremely cordial speech.' From that attitude\r\nof friendliness the future King Edward never departed.\r\n\r\n    'I had a dinner-party in the evening, which was one of several in\r\n    preparation for our Ward meetings in Chelsea, which I had to\r\n    continue to hold in spite of my private miseries.\r\n\r\n    'I was engaged on the one night for which none of these dinners had\r\n    been fixed to dine with Lord and Lady Salisbury, and to attend the\r\n    Princess of Wales's Ball at Marlborough House, and I wrote to put\r\n    off my engagements, for which I was much blamed; but I think that I\r\n    was right.'\r\n\r\nFor three or four days Sir Henry James, Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. J. B.\r\nBalfour, the Lord Advocate of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry, moved to secure\r\na court of inquiry which would act without prejudice to the right of\r\nlegal action. But within the week it was certain that public proceedings\r\nwould be taken.\r\n\r\nThe blow had come suddenly; it came with dramatic incidence at the\r\nmoment when Sir Charles's prestige was most effectively recognized; and\r\nfrom the moment that it fell he knew that the whole tenor of his life\r\nwas altered. On Thursday, July 23rd, four days afterwards, he wrote in\r\nhis Diary of the time this judgment:\r\n\r\n    'Left for the last time the House of Commons, where I have attained\r\n    some distinction. It is curious that only a week ago Chamberlain and\r\n    I had agreed, at his wish and suggestion, that I should be the\r\n    future leader, as being more popular in the House, though less in\r\n    the country, than he was, and that only three days ago Mr. Gladstone\r\n    had expressed the same wish. Such a charge, even if disproved, which\r\n    is not easy against perjured evidence picked up with care, is fatal\r\n    to supreme usefulness in politics. In the case of a public man a\r\n    charge is always believed by many, even though disproved, and I\r\n    should be weighted by it through life. I prefer, therefore, at once\r\n    to contemplate leaving public life.'\r\n\r\nUpon the first sentence of this he added in a marginal note, written\r\nafter his marriage with Mrs. Mark Pattison, and after he had, in spite\r\nof that first decision, returned to the House of Commons: 'Chamberlain\r\noverpersuaded Emilia, and, through her, me, but he was wrong.'\r\n\r\nOf honourable ambition Sir Charles Dilke had as much as any man. Yet in\r\nthe innermost record of these days--in those letters which, not yet\r\ndaring to despatch them, he wrote to his future wife--there is not a\r\nhint of his personal loss, not a word of the career that he saw broken.\r\nThese things had no place in the rush of feeling which overwhelmed him,\r\nand left him for the moment unable to trust his own judgment or assert\r\nhis own will.\r\n\r\nThrough the months of Mrs. Pattison's absence in India one note had been\r\nconstant in his letters--the reiterated anticipation of what he hoped to\r\nbring her. Up to the middle of July his letters, apart from the news of\r\nhis daily life, are filled with joyful forecast, not of his own\r\nhappiness, but of his and hers together--of his happiness in seeing her\r\nhappy. When the stroke fell, the note, even though it changed, was the\r\nsame in essence: 'I feel this may kill you--and it will kill me either\r\nif it kills you or if you don't believe me.'\r\n\r\nThat was written down within an hour after he had the news. Never\r\nafterwards did he consider the possibility of her failing him.\r\n\r\nThe next day he wrote:\r\n\r\n          'Taplow Court, Taplow,\r\n          _July 20th._\r\n\r\n    'The only thing I can do in future is to devote myself entirely to\r\n    _you_ and helping in your work. To that the remainder of my life\r\n    must be dedicated. I fancy you will have the courage to believe me\r\n    whatever is by madness and malevolence brought against me....'\r\n\r\nHe wrote again:\r\n\r\n    'The less you turn from me, and the more you are true--and of course\r\n    you will be all true ... --the more misery and not the less is it to\r\n    me to bring these horrors on you. This thing is not true, but none\r\n    the less do I bring these horrors on you.'\r\n\r\nSo desperate was the tumult in Sir Charles Dilke's mind that Mr.\r\nChamberlain strove to tranquillize him by a change of scene. Some spot,\r\nsuch as is to be found in Sir Charles's own holiday land of Provence, at\r\nfirst occurred to his friend, though this would have meant the\r\ncancelling of all Mr. Chamberlain's public engagements at that most\r\ncritical moment in politics. But Sir Charles instead went down to\r\nHighbury, where he passed his days much in the open air, playing lawn\r\ntennis and riding with his host's son, Mr Austen Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nHere he rapidly came back to something of his normal self. As news had\r\nbeen telegraphed of Mrs. Pattison's gradual recovery, it was decided to\r\ninform her of what had happened. Mr. Chamberlain undertook the delicate\r\ntask of wording the communications. She telegraphed back at once that\r\nfull assurance of her trust and of her loyalty on which Sir Charles had\r\ncounted. But it was characteristic of her not to stop there. A telegram\r\nfrom Mrs. Pattison to the _Times_ announcing her engagement to Sir\r\nCharles Dilke immediately followed on public intimation of the\r\nproceedings for divorce. Lord Granville wrote to Sir Charles: 'I wish\r\nyou joy most sincerely. The announcement says much for the woman whom\r\nyou have chosen.'\r\n\r\nYet days were to come when the storm was so fierce about Sir Charles\r\nDilke and 'the woman whom he had chosen' that few cared to face it in\r\nsupport of the accused man and the wife who had claimed her share in his\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nWhen those days came, they found no broken spirit to meet them. Through\r\nhis affections, and only through his affections, this man could be\r\ndriven out of his strongholds of will and judgment; when that inner life\r\nwas assured, he faced the rest with equanimity. He writes:\r\n\r\n    '_August 28th._--I continue to be much better in health and spirit.\r\n    I was five and a half weeks more or less knocked over; I am strong\r\n    and well, and really happy in you and for you, and confident and all\r\n    that you could wish me to be these last few days.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Pattison, before she left Ceylon on her way to England, sent him a\r\ntelegram, the reply to which was written to meet her at Port Said:\r\n'Nothing ever made me so happy.... Though it has been a frightful blow,\r\nI am well now; and the blow was only a blow to me because of you.'\r\n\r\nAt first sympathy and support were proffered in ample measure. On being\r\nformally notified of proceedings in the divorce case, he wrote at once a\r\nletter to the Liberal Association of Chelsea, in which he declared that\r\nthe charge against him was untrue and that he looked forward with\r\nconfidence to the result of a judicial inquiry; but at the same time he\r\noffered to withdraw his candidature for the seat at the forthcoming\r\nelection, if the Council thought him in the circumstances an undesirable\r\ncandidate. To this offer the Council replied by reiterating their\r\nconfidence in him. About the same time, yielding to Chamberlain's\r\nadvice, he returned to the House of Commons while the Housing Bill was\r\nin Committee, and took part in the proceedings as usual.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, to whom he communicated news of his engagement\r\nbefore the public announcement, wrote warm congratulations and wishes\r\nfor dispersal of the overhanging trouble. Mr. Gladstone, who had\r\nfrequent occasion to write to him on public business, in one of these\r\npolitical letters added congratulations on the engagement, though he had\r\nmade no allusion to the Divorce Court proceedings. But Mr. Gladstone's\r\nchief private secretary, Sir Edward Hamilton, had written at the first\r\npublication of them this assurance:\r\n\r\n    'You may depend upon it that your friends (among whom I hope I may\r\n    be counted) are feeling for you and will stand by you; and, if I am\r\n    not mistaken, I believe your constituents will equally befriend you;\r\n    indeed, I am convinced that the masses are much more fair and just\r\n    than the upper classes. Anything that interfered with your political\r\n    career would not only be a political calamity, but a national one;\r\n    and I do not for a moment think that any such interference need be\r\n    apprehended.'\r\n\r\nThis letter represented the attitude that was generally observed towards\r\nSir Charles Dilke by political associates till after the first trial.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain's support was unwavering, though there were some who\r\nanticipated that the misfortunes of the one man might disastrously\r\naffect the political career of the other.\r\n\r\nIt is true that by the amazing irony of fate which interpenetrated this\r\nwhole situation the Tories gained in Mr. Chamberlain their most powerful\r\nally, and that Sir Charles had to encounter all the accumulated\r\nprejudice which the 'unauthorized programme' had gathered in Tory\r\nbosoms. But none of these things could be foreseen when Chamberlain,\r\nthen in the full flood of his Radical propaganda, invited Sir Charles to\r\nmake his temporary home at Highbury. Here, accordingly, he stayed on\r\nthrough August and the early part of September, breaking his stay only\r\nby two short absences. There still lived on at Chichester old Mr.\r\nDilke's brother, a survivor of the close-knit family group, preserving\r\nthe same intense affectionate interest in Charles Dilke's career. To him\r\nthis blow was mortal. Sir Charles paid him in the close of August his\r\nyearly visit: ten days later he was recalled to attend the old man's\r\nfuneral in the Cathedral cloisters.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of September he crossed to France, and waited at Saint\r\nGermain for Mrs. Pattison, who reached Paris in the last days of the\r\nmonth. On October 1st Sir Charles crossed to London; she followed the\r\nnext day, and on the 3rd they were married at Chelsea Parish Church. Mr.\r\nChamberlain acted as best man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nReturn to England meant a return to work. The General Election was fixed\r\nfor November; and from August onwards Dilke had been drawn back by\r\ncorrespondents and by consultations with Chamberlain into the stream of\r\npolitics, which then ran broken and turbulent with eddies and cross-\r\ncurrents innumerable. Chamberlain, sustaining alone the advanced\r\ncampaign, wrote even before the marriage to solicit help at the earliest\r\nmoment; and from October onwards the two Radicals were as closely\r\nassociated as ever--but with a difference. Circumstances had begun the\r\nwork of Sir Charles's effacement.\r\n\r\nWhen the election came, his success was personal; London went against\r\nthe Liberals, his old colleague Mr. Firth failed, so did Mr. George\r\nRussell in another part of the borough, which was now split into several\r\nconstituencies; but Chelsea itself stood to its own man. The elections\r\nwere over on December 19th. Before that date it was apparent that the\r\nIrish party held the balance of power, and Mr. Gladstone had already\r\nindicated his acceptance of Home Rule. [Footnote: Chapter XLV., p. 196.]\r\n\r\nParliament met early, and by January 28th, 1886, the Tory Government had\r\nresigned. Mr. Gladstone, in framing his new Administration, thought it\r\nimpossible to include a man suffering under a charge yet untried, and\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    '_February 2nd_, 1886\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    'I write you, on this first day of my going regularly to my arduous\r\n    work, to express my profound regret that any circumstances of the\r\n    moment should deprive me of the opportunity and the hope of\r\n    enlisting on behalf of a new Government the great capacity which you\r\n    have proved in a variety of spheres and forms for rendering good and\r\n    great service to Crown and country.\r\n\r\n    'You will understand how absolutely recognition on my part of an\r\n    external barrier is separate from any want of inward confidence, the\r\n    last idea I should wish to convey.\r\n\r\n    'Nor can I close without fervently expressing to you my desire that\r\n    there may be reserved you a long and honourable career of public\r\n    distinction.\r\n\r\n    'Believe me always,\r\n\r\n    'Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    'W. E. Gladstone.'\r\n\r\nLess than a fortnight later the divorce case was heard: the charge\r\nagainst Sir Charles was dismissed with costs, the Judge saying expressly\r\nthat there was no case for him to answer.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's attitude made it inevitable that while the case was\r\nuntried Sir Charles should be excluded from the new Ministry; but not\r\nless inevitably his position before the world was prejudiced by that\r\nexclusion. Had Parliament met, as it usually meets, in February; had the\r\nwhole thing so happened that the judgment had been given before the\r\nMinistry came to be formed, exclusion would have been all but\r\nimpossible. We may take it that Mr. Chamberlain would have insisted on\r\nSir Charles's inclusion as a condition of his own adherence; it would\r\nhave been to the interest of every Gladstonian and of every follower of\r\nChamberlain to maintain the judgment. As it was, the effect of Sir\r\nCharles's exclusion had been to prepare the way for a vehement campaign\r\ndirected against him by a section of the Press.\r\n\r\nBy the law a wife's confession of misconduct is evidence against\r\nherself, entitling the husband to a divorce; but if unsupported by other\r\nwitnesses it is no evidence against the co-respondent. But a question\r\narose which afterwards became of capital importance. Should Sir Charles\r\ngo into the witness-box, deny on oath the unsworn charges made against\r\nhim, and submit himself to cross-examination? His counsel decided that\r\nthere was no evidence to answer; they did not put their client into the\r\nbox, and the course was held by the Judge to be the correct one.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the Attorney-General's representation that there was no case\r\nwhatever which Sir Charles Dilke was called to answer, Mr. Justice Butt\r\nsaid that he could not see the shadow of a case. In his judgment he\r\nsaid: 'A statement such as has been made by the respondent in this case\r\nis not one of those things which in common fairness ought for one moment\r\nto be weighed in the balance against a person in the position of Sir\r\nCharles Dilke. Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation whatever\r\nin saying that counsel have been well advised in suggesting the course\r\nwhich they have induced Sir Charles Dilke to take, and the petition, as\r\nagainst him, must be dismissed with costs.'\r\n\r\nDilke himself notes: 'On Friday, February 12th, the trial took place,\r\nand lasted but a short time, Sir Henry James and Sir Charles Russell not\r\nputting me into the box, and Sir Charles Butt almost inviting them to\r\ntake that course. Lord Granville had written to me: \"Will you forgive my\r\nintruding two words of advice? Put yourself unreservedly into the hands\r\nof someone who, like our two law officers, unites sense with knowledge\r\nof the law.\" I had done this, and had throughout acted entirely through\r\nJames, Russell, and Chamberlain. In court and during the remainder of\r\nthe day, Chamberlain, James, and Russell, were triumphant....'\r\n\r\nFor the moment it seemed as if misfortune had ended in triumph.\r\nCongratulations poured in upon both Sir Charles and his wife; the\r\nofficial leaders welcomed the judgment. Mr. Chamberlain sent an express\r\nmessage to Downing Street: 'Case against Dilke dismissed with costs, but\r\nthe petitioner has got his divorce against his wife.' Mr. Gladstone\r\nanswered: 'My dear Chamberlain, I have received your prompt report with\r\nthe utmost pleasure.' Sir William Harcourt wrote direct:\r\n\r\n    'Dear Dilke,--So glad to hear of the result and of your relief from\r\n    your great trouble.--Yours ever, W. V. H.'\r\n\r\nLady Dilke's friends wrote to her, congratulating her on the reward that\r\nher courage and her loyalty had reaped.\r\n\r\nBut in Sir Charles's Diary of that date, where notes of any personal\r\ncharacter are few indeed, this is written on the day after the case was\r\nheard, in comment on the action of a certain section of the Press:\r\n\r\n    'Renewed attempt to drive me out of public life. But I won't go now.\r\n    In July I said to Emilia and to Chamberlain: \"Here is the whole\r\n    truth--and I am an innocent man; but let me go out quietly, and some\r\n    day people will be sorry and I shall recover a different sort of\r\n    usefulness.\" They would not let me go. Now I won't go.'\r\n\r\nA man other than innocent would have rested on the strong judgment in\r\nhis favour and let agitation die down, but the attacks continued and\r\nDilke would not wait their passing. Chamberlain was included in these\r\nattacks, 'for having kept me out of the box,' and wrote in reply to Sir\r\nCharles: 'I was only too glad to be able in any way to share your\r\nburdens, and if I can act as a lightning conductor, so much the\r\nbetter.... Of course, if _you_ were quite clear that you ought to go\r\ninto the box, it is still possible to do so, either by action for libel\r\nor probably by intervention of the Queen's Proctor.'\r\n\r\n'This was the first suggestion made to me of any possibility of a\r\nrehearing of the case ... and though Hartington, James, and Russell,\r\nwere all under the impression that I should find no further difficulty,\r\nit was the course which I ultimately took,' and which he pressed on with\r\ncharacteristic tenacity. And here laymen may be permitted to marvel at\r\nthe fallibility of eminent lawyers. 'No one, of all these great\r\nlawyers,' foresaw the position in which he would be placed as a result\r\nof his application. Yet from the moment that this procedure was adopted\r\nit was possible that he might be judged without those resources of\r\ndefence which are open to the meanest subject charged with an offence.\r\n\r\nIn March Sir Charles Dilke applied to the Queen's Proctor for his\r\nintervention in order that the case might be reheard. The application\r\nfailed. In April he moved again, this time by a public letter, and this\r\ntime the Queen's Proctor yielded. Application was made in the Court of\r\nProbate and Divorce to the President, Sir James Hannen, that Sir Charles\r\nDilke should be made a party to the intervention or reinstated in the\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nThe President laid down that Sir Charles was no party to the suit, and\r\nhad now no right to appear except as a witness, and might not be\r\nrepresented by counsel. The question was then taken to the Court of\r\nAppeal, but, on strictly technical grounds, the Court held that Sir\r\nCharles was no longer a party, and that he could not be allowed to\r\nintervene. Thus the first judgment, by declaring him innocent and\r\nawarding him costs as one unjustly accused, led straight to his undoing.\r\nHe had been struck out of the case; he was now a mere member of the\r\ngeneral public. There never were, probably, legal proceedings in which\r\nfrom first to last law and justice were more widely asunder.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke was, in fact, in the position from which Sir Henry\r\nJames had sought to protect him--the position described in the course of\r\nhis pleading for reinstatement:\r\n\r\n    'I have no desire to put forward any claim for my client other than\r\n    one founded on justice, but I cannot imagine a more cruel position\r\n    than that in which Sir Charles Dilke would be placed in having a\r\n    grave charge against him tried while the duty of defending his\r\n    interest was committed to hands other than those of his own\r\n    advisers.'\r\n\r\nThe consequences which flowed from the technical construction put upon\r\nthe situation were these: In reality Sir Charles Dilke was the defendant\r\non trial for his political life and his personal honour. Yet although\r\nSir Henry James and Sir Charles Russell were there in court ready\r\nbriefed, neither was allowed to speak. Dilke's case against his accuser\r\nhad to be dealt with by the counsel for the Queen's Proctor, Sir Walter\r\nPhillimore, who, though a skilled ecclesiastical lawyer, was\r\ncomparatively inexperienced in the cross-examination of witnesses and in\r\nNisi Prius procedure, and was opposed by Mr. Henry Matthews, the most\r\nskilled cross-examiner at the bar. Sir Walter Phillimore also stated\r\npublicly, and properly, that it was not his 'duty to represent and\r\ndefend Sir Charles Dilke.' So strictly was this view acted upon that Sir\r\nCharles did not once meet Sir Walter Phillimore in consultation; and\r\nwitnesses whom he believed to be essential to his case were never\r\ncalled. But that was not all. According to the practice of that court,\r\nall the information given by Dilke was at once communicated to the other\r\nside; but as Sir Charles was not a party to the suit, the Queen's\r\nProctor did not communicate to him what he learned from that other side.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary trial the witnesses of the accusers are heard first. And\r\nthis order is recognized as giving the greatest prospect of justice,\r\nsince if the defence is first disclosed the accuser may adjust details\r\nin the charge so as, at the last moment, to deprive the defence of that\r\nfair-play which the first order of hearing is designed to secure. The\r\nonly possible disproof which Sir Charles could offer was an alibi. It\r\nwas of vital importance to him that the accusation should be fixed to\r\ndates, places, days, hours, even minutes, with the utmost possible\r\nprecision. Then he might, even after the lapse of years, establish the\r\nfalsity of a charge by proof that he was elsewhere at the time\r\nspecified. But in this case, owing to the form that the proceedings\r\ntook, the opportunity which of right belongs to the defence was given to\r\nthe accuser. The accusation being technically brought by the Queen's\r\nProctor, who alleged that the divorce had been obtained by false\r\nevidence, Sir Charles Dilke was produced as his witness, and had at the\r\nbeginning of the proceedings to disclose his defence.\r\n\r\nFurther, and even more important, the issue put to the jury was limited\r\nin the most prejudicial way.\r\n\r\n    'On the former occasion,' said Sir James Hannen, 'it was for the\r\n    petitioner to prove that his wife had committed adultery with Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke.' (This, as has been seen, the petitioner failed to\r\n    prove against Sir Charles Dilke; the petitioner had to pay Sir\r\n    Charles's costs.) 'On this occasion it is for the Queen's Proctor to\r\n    prove that the respondent did not commit adultery with Sir Charles\r\n    Dilke.'\r\n\r\nHow this negative was to be proved in any circumstances it is difficult\r\nto see, and under the conditions Sir Charles had no chance to attack the\r\naccusation brought against him.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's own comment in his Diary of the time was:\r\n\r\n    '_July 16th_--My case tried again. I not a party, and--though really\r\n    tried by a kind of Star Chamber--not represented, not allowed to\r\n    cross-examine, not allowed to call witnesses; and under such\r\n    circumstances the trial could have but one result, which was that\r\n    the jury, directed to decide if they were in doubt that the Queen's\r\n    Proctor had not established his case, would take that negative\r\n    course. The trial lasted from Friday, 16th, to Friday, 23rd,\r\n    inclusive, and the jury decided, as they could not have helped\r\n    deciding, and as I should have decided had I been one of them.'\r\n\r\nThe situation may be thus summed up:\r\n\r\nIn the first trial the petitioner failed to produce any legal evidence\r\nwhatever of the guilt of Sir Charles Dilke; in the second the Queen's\r\nProctor failed to prove his innocence. [Footnote: Technically the\r\nverdict, by dismissing the Queen's Proctor's intervention, confirmed the\r\noriginal judgment, which dismissed Sir Charles from the case.]\r\n\r\nThe verdict of the jury at the second trial was not a verdict of Guilty\r\nagainst Sir Charles; it was a declaration that his innocence was not\r\nproven, the question put to the Jury by the clerk after their return\r\ninto Court following the words of the Act of Parliament, and being\r\nwhether the decree nisi for the dissolution of the marriage of the\r\npetitioner and the respondent was obtained contrary to the justice of\r\nthe case by reason of material facts not being brought to the knowledge\r\nof the Court. The Jury's answer followed the same words. [Footnote: See\r\nreport in _Daily News_, Saturday, July 24th, 1886.] When we add to that\r\nthe conditions under which the question was tried, we see that they were\r\nsuch as to make the proof of innocence impossible.\r\n\r\nThose about Sir Charles at this time remember how even at that bitter\r\nmoment he began to look round for any method by which his case might be\r\nreheard. He wrote to Sir Henry James that it would be a proper course\r\nfor himself to invite a trial for perjury; and though Lady Dilke was so\r\nill 'from sick and sleepless nights' that she had been ordered at once\r\nto Royat, he waited for three weeks before accompanying her abroad, to\r\ngive time for action to be taken, and wrote to Sir Richard Webster (then\r\nAttorney-General) practically inviting a prosecution.\r\n\r\nHe did not abandon hope of a rehearing, and worked for many years in the\r\ntrust that the evidence accumulated by himself and his friends might be\r\nso used, nor did he cease his efforts till counsel in consultation\r\nfinally assured him 'that no means were open to Sir Charles Dilke to\r\nretry his case.'\r\n\r\nSir Eyre Crowe, a friend valued for his own as well as for his father's\r\nsake (Sir Joseph Crowe, to whom Sir Charles was much attached), wrote at\r\nthe time of Sir Charles's death: 'How he bore for long years the sorrow\r\nand misfortunes of his lot had something heroic about it. I only once\r\ntalked to him about these things, and was intensely struck by his Roman\r\nattitude.' It was the only attitude possible to such a man. Placed by\r\nhis country's laws in the situation of one officially acquitted by a\r\ndecision which was interpreted into a charge of guilt; forced then, in\r\ndefence of his honour, into the position of a defendant who is debarred\r\nfrom means of defence; assured after long effort that no legal means\r\nwere open to him to attempt again that defence, he solemnly declared his\r\ninnocence, and was thereafter silent.\r\n\r\n'By-and-by it will be remembered that as a fact the issue was never\r\nfairly represented and never fairly met,' was the estimate of Sir\r\nFrancis Jeune, afterwards President of the Divorce Court. And from the\r\nfirst there were many lawyers and thinking men and women who would have\r\nendorsed it. From the first also there were those who believed Sir\r\nCharles's word. Among such faithful friends, Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice,\r\nSir Robert Collins, Mr. Cyril Flower, Mrs. Westlake and Mr. Westlake,\r\nQ.C., Mr. Thursfield of the _Times_, Mr. Chamberlain, Sir Francis and\r\nLady Jeune, Sir Charles's old college friend Judge Steavenson, stand out\r\nin memory. He himself says: 'I received after the trial ... a vast\r\nnumber of letters from people who wrote to express their belief in me.\r\nSome, as, for example, from Dr. Hatch' (the eminent Oxford theologian)\r\n'and his wife, and from Dr. Percival, Head-master of Rugby, [Footnote:\r\nDr. Percival was President of Trinity College, Oxford, till 1887, when\r\nhe went to Rugby. He became Bishop of Hereford.] and his wife, were from\r\nfirm friends of Emilia, brought to me by their belief in her; some from\r\nfriends, some from political foes, of all sorts--all breathing\r\nconfidence and devotion.'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain wrote: 'I feel bitterly my powerlessness to do or say\r\nanything useful at the present time.' In such a case the testimony of\r\nintimates is weighty, and Sir John Gorst sent in June, 1913, his\r\nrecollection of words used by Mr. Chamberlain in the autumn of 1886: 'I\r\nassure you that, as a man of honour, I don't believe the charges made\r\nagainst him. If you had been in and out of his house at all times as I\r\nhave been, you would see they were impossible.'\r\n\r\nThen as now there existed a certain body of opinion which would have\r\ndiscriminated between a man's private honour and his public usefulness,\r\nholding that the nation which throws aside a great public servant\r\nbecause of charges of personal immorality is confusing issues, and\r\nsacrificing the country's welfare to private questions. Whatever is to\r\nbe said for this view, it was one to which Sir Charles Dilke wished to\r\nowe nothing. He did not share it, and those whose adherence he\r\nacknowledged were those who believed his word. From different sources,\r\nthen, Sir Charles had found confidence and support, but they were small\r\nstay in that gradually accumulating torrent of misfortune.\r\n\r\nAs the Press campaign had developed in the spring, he found himself\r\navoided in Parliament and in society. In the House, where a few months\r\nbefore he had again and again been the Government spokesman and\r\nrepresentative, he was retired into the ranks of private members. This\r\nshort Parliament of 1886 came to an end in June, and, in the General\r\nElection which followed, London went solidly against Home Rule; and Sir\r\nCharles, though as compared with other Gladstonian Liberals he did well,\r\nfound himself rejected by the constituency which had stood by him in\r\nfour contests. Such a reverse occurs in the life of almost every\r\nprominent politician, and, though harassing, is of no determining\r\nimport. For Sir Charles Dilke at this moment it was a cruel blow. The\r\npersonal discredit against which he had to fight coincided with the\r\ndiscredit of his party; and when the jury came to their decision in\r\nJuly, after a week in which the newspapers had been filled daily with\r\ncolumns of scandalous detail, public feeling assumed a character of\r\nbitter personal hostility.\r\n\r\n'Sir Charles's fall,' says the chronicler of that period, Mr. Justin\r\nMcCarthy, 'is like that of a tower. He stood high above every rising\r\nEnglish statesman, and but for what has happened he must have been Prime\r\nMinister after Gladstone.' [Footnote: This article appeared in a\r\nCanadian journal after the second trial.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nTHE RADICAL PROGRAMME _VERSUS_ HOME RULE\r\n\r\nJULY TO DECEMBER, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This chapter and the next cover the same dates as the\r\npreceding chapter, which contains the record of other than political\r\nevents, while these deal with the political history of the time.]\r\n\r\nThe period between July, 1885, and July, 1886, determined the course of\r\nEnglish history for a generation. At the beginning of this period, Sir\r\nCharles Dilke was one of the three men on the Liberal side who, after\r\nMr. Gladstone, counted most, and he commanded more general approval than\r\neither Chamberlain or Hartington. But from the first rumour of his\r\npersonal misfortune his influence rapidly dwindled; when the period\r\nclosed, many of those who had been his political associates had left\r\nhim, and from Mr. Chamberlain, in political life, he was irretrievably\r\nsundered.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1885, the much-talked-of visit of the Radical leaders to\r\nIreland was abandoned, owing, it appears, to the change in Sir Charles's\r\npersonal fortunes. Meanwhile the first-fruits of the Tory alliance with\r\nParnellism had begun to appear, and on July 21st Mr. Gladstone had made,\r\nas has been seen, [Footnote: See p.158] a powerful appeal to his Radical\r\ncolleagues for support of Lord Spencer--addressing it, after his\r\ninvariable custom, to Dilke. It was the last time that he did so, and he\r\nwrote then without knowledge of the blow which had already fallen on Sir\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\nIn the end Mr. Gladstone's appeal was disregarded, and, when Lord\r\nSpencer's policy was assailed in the House, the Press noted the\r\nsignificant absence of Dilke and Chamberlain from the front bench. It\r\nwould have been more significant had not Sir Charles been then engrossed\r\nwith his personal concerns. Not until the last days of August was he\r\n'sufficiently recovered from the blow to be able to take some interest\r\nin politics'; and then it was merely to take an interest, not to take a\r\npart. Yet already the crucial question for Liberal policy had begun to\r\ndefine itself.\r\n\r\nOn August 24th, Parnell, speaking in Ireland, declared that the one\r\nplank in Ireland's platform was National independence. In reply, Lord\r\nHartington, speaking at Waterfoot in Lancashire, declared his confidence\r\nthat no British party would concede Parnell's demand. But Lord\r\nHartington did not confine his speech to this\r\n\r\n    'A speech by Hartington in Lancashire read to Chamberlain and myself\r\n    like a declaration of war against the unauthorized programme and its\r\n    author; and when Rosebery wrote to me to congratulate me on my\r\n    coming marriage, I replied in this sense. I had a good deal of\r\n    correspondence with James as to what should be the nature of\r\n    Chamberlain's reply at Warrington on Tuesday, September 8th, James\r\n    trying to patch up things: \"The ransom theory [Footnote: Mr.\r\n    Chamberlain on January 29th, 1885, at Birmingham: \"I hold that the\r\n    sanctity of public property is greater than even that of private\r\n    property, and that, if it has been lost or wasted or stolen, some\r\n    equivalent must be found for it, and some compensation may fairly be\r\n    exacted from the wrongdoer.\" See Chapter XXXVIII., p. 105.] startled\r\n    a good many people, and dissent from it was to be expected. But\r\n    surely such dissent does not cause a man to be unfit to be in the\r\n    Liberal ranks....\" James also sent me a memorandum from which I\r\n    extracted the following sentence: \"If it be once introduced as an\r\n    admitted principle that no man can take office without stipulating\r\n    for the success of every question to which he may have given a\r\n    support, and if every man in Government is to be bound to reject all\r\n    concessions to those with whom he has on any point ever differed,\r\n    the practical constitution of this country would be overthrown....\"\r\n    On September 5th Chamberlain had received a letter from Harcourt\r\n    which I afterwards considered with him \"I set store by your\r\n    declaration that you will try to be as moderate as you can. You have\r\n    no idea how moderate you can be till you try. I am not the least\r\n    despondent about the state of affairs. The Liberal party has a\r\n    Pentecostian gift of tongues, and the Parthians, Medes, Elamites,\r\n    and others, require to have the gospel preached to them in very\r\n    different languages.... I suppose that Bosebery reported to you his\r\n    phrase that 'he had expressed himself on the land question more\r\n    clumsily even than usual!' It is impossible to be angry with such\r\n    frankness....\"'\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery had written at the same time to Sir Charles that the real\r\ntrouble arose from 'clumsiness of arrangement,' and quoted Lord\r\nHartington's words as accepting this view.\r\n\r\n    'John Morley wrote also on September 4th to Chamberlain that Goschen\r\n    was rather wrathful that Hartington should be so slow and infrequent\r\n    in speaking while he, Chamberlain, was so active, but that he did\r\n    not believe Hartington meant war.'\r\n\r\nNone adverted to the difficulty, which was nevertheless the central one,\r\nof reaching an agreement concerning an Irish policy. Mr. Morley was\r\nright when he said that there was not going to be 'war' in the Liberal\r\nparty over questions of English reform. The question which was to split\r\nthe party was Ireland, and Chamberlain in his Warrington speech joined\r\nHartington in repudiating Parnell's demand. But Mr. Chamberlain saw what\r\nLord Hartington did not, that a Liberal party must have a positive\r\npolicy, and his conception of a Liberal policy during these months was\r\nto force the pace on social questions and leave Ireland alone.\r\n\r\nAt these critical moments of August and September, 1885, Sir Charles was\r\na guest in Mr. Chamberlain's house, and was in consultation with him;\r\nbut it was a consultation to which one of the two brought a mind\r\npreoccupied with his own most vital concerns. Scarcely a month had gone\r\nby since the petition had been filed, in July, 1885; much less than a\r\nmonth since he had been on the very edge of a complete breakdown. He had\r\nbeen dragged back, almost against his will and against his judgment,\r\ninto political life by that imperious personality with which he had been\r\nso long associated in equal comradeship. Under the old conditions Sir\r\nCharles and Mr. Chamberlain would have inevitably influenced each\r\nother's action, and it is at least possible that Sir Charles's gift for\r\nbringing men together and concentrating on essentials might have altered\r\nthe whole course of events. But it is clear, from what followed later,\r\nthat under the conditions which existed there was no thorough discussion\r\nbetween them, since the line which Sir Charles took on Ireland when the\r\ndividing of the ways came was a surprise to his friend.\r\n\r\n    'On September 10th, 1885, there came a letter from Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    addressed to Chamberlain and myself. Chamberlain replied, after\r\n    consultation, in our joint names.'\r\n\r\nThey developed their views as to their programme of English as distinct\r\nfrom Irish reforms.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Gladstone wished to issue an address (to his constituents with\r\n    a view to the General Election), and had got Hartington to ask him\r\n    to do so, and he now wanted us also to ask him. We stipulated that\r\n    we must have (1) power to local authorities to take land for\r\n    housing, allotments, and so forth, and (2) free schools: otherwise,\r\n    while we could not object to his issuing his own address, we could\r\n    not offer to support or join a future Government.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 15th Chamberlain wrote to me to Paris that he gathered Mr.\r\n    G. intended to issue immediately, without waiting his reply.'\r\n\r\nHe would write, however, asking for further allusions to compulsory\r\npowers for taking land, and asked Sir Charles to write direct about\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\nOn September 20th Mr. Chamberlain wrote again, enclosing a copy of his\r\nletter to Mr. Gladstone, and stating his opinion that the manifesto was\r\nbad, and that he regarded it, especially the part referring to free\r\nschools and education, [Footnote: Mr. Gladstone was never at any time in\r\nharmony with the views of the more advanced section of his own party on\r\neducation. See the account of the curious controversy between him and\r\nLord Russell during the last days of the latter's leadership of the\r\nLiberal party (_Life of Granville_, vol. i., pp. 516, 517).] as a slap\r\nin the face to himself and Sir Charles. He added that he had written\r\nfrankly to Mr. Gladstone, telling him that he was dissatisfied, and\r\nexpressed his opinion that Mr. Gladstone would give way, and that his\r\nreign could not last long. Through the somewhat involved phraseology of\r\nMr. Gladstone's letter, it seemed possible to extract some hope in\r\nregard to extra powers for local authorities, and a revision of taxation\r\nin favour of the working classes. He concluded by saying that if his\r\nparty could get a majority, he would make their terms on joining the\r\nGovernment, and regretting that Sir Charles was not still staying with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Mr. Gladstone spoke of the manifesto as a blow to the\r\nRadical party, and went on to say that, in the event of the Liberal\r\nparty returning in full power to office, he would offer loyal support,\r\nas far as possible, to any Government that might be formed, but that the\r\njoining any Administration formed on the narrow basis of the programme\r\nnow presented would be impossible. It ended with the words: 'Dilke has\r\nleft me, but, from a letter I have received from him, I am justified in\r\nsaying that he shares my views.'\r\n\r\n    'I told Chamberlain that in my first speech (and I had two to make\r\n    shortly after my proposed marriage in October) I intended to attack\r\n    Reform of the House of Lords from the Single Chamber point of view.'\r\n\r\nHe replied urging Sir Charles to give this question prominence and\r\nimportance, and to do so in the name of the Radical Party, as expressing\r\ntheir policy, for fear that even Radical candidates should be under some\r\nmisapprehension. He also authorized him to use his (Mr. Chamberlain's)\r\nname, as concurring in the views expressed.\r\n\r\n    'On the 25th I received a letter from Chamberlain containing Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's reply:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    '\"Were I engaged (which Heaven forfend) in the formation of a new\r\n    Liberal Government, and were your letter of yesterday an answer to\r\n    some invitation to join it, then _I_ should have read the letter\r\n    with great regret; but I pointed out to you (as I think), in a\r\n    previous letter, that it would (as far as I could judge) be an\r\n    entire mistake to lay down a _credo_ of Liberal policy for a new\r\n    Government at the present juncture. You and Hartington were both\r\n    demurring in opposite senses, and I made to each the same reply. My\r\n    aim was for the election only, in giving form to my address. As to\r\n    what lies beyond, I suppose the party will, so far as it has a\r\n    choice, set first about the matters on which it is agreed. But no\r\n    one is bound to this proposition.\r\n\r\n    '\"Bright once said, with much force and sense, that the average\r\n    opinion of the party ought to be the rule of immediate action.\r\n\r\n    '\"It is likely that there may be a split in the party in the far or\r\n    middle distance, but I shall have nothing to do with it, and you, I\r\n    am sure, do not wish to anticipate it or force it on. What I have\r\n    said may, I hope, mitigate any regret such as you seem to intimate.\r\n\r\n    '\"I am at present busy on private affairs and papers, to which for\r\n    six years past I have hardly given one continuous hour. Later on I\r\n    should like much to explain to you my personal views and intentions\r\n    in conversation. It would be difficult to do so in writing. They\r\n    turn very much upon Ireland--the one imperial question that seems at\r\n    present possible to be brought into immediate view. But, for\r\n    Liberals generally, I should have thought that there was work enough\r\n    for three or four years on which they might all agree. So far as my\r\n    observation and correspondence go, I have not found that non-Whig\r\n    opinion is offended.\r\n\r\n    '\"Sincerely yours,\r\n    '\"W. E. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    '\"P.S.--A letter received from Dilke speaks pleasingly about the\r\n    address.\r\n\r\n    '\"I may say that I was quite unconscious of interfering with your\r\n    present view, which I understood to be that none of your advanced\r\n    proposals were to be excluded, but all left open for discussion.--W.\r\n    E. G.\"\r\n\r\n    'On the passage with regard to Ireland I noted: \"He means that he\r\n    would go on as Prime Minister if he could see his way to carry the\r\n    larger Local Government (Ireland) scheme, and not otherwise.\" But he\r\n    meant more.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles also wrote suggesting that Mr. Chamberlain should, in his\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Gladstone, go into the question of the Whig\r\ncomposition of Liberal Cabinets, and the latter promised 'to say just\r\nwhat you suggest.'\r\n\r\nThose who occupied the centre position in the Liberal party were\r\nbewildered by divided counsels.\r\n\r\n    'On September 28th I received from Chamberlain a letter enclosing\r\n    one from Harcourt.... He (Harcourt) dwelt upon the delicacy of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's position. \"He (Mr. Gladstone) says, if he is not wanted,\r\n    he will 'cut out,' and he doubts, I think, if either you or\r\n    Hartington want him. But I hope in this he is mistaken; for he is\r\n    wanted, and neither section can do without him.... When I spoke at\r\n    Plymouth I knew nothing of the contents of his address, nor indeed,\r\n    that it was about to appear so soon, though, oddly enough, it came\r\n    out the next day. I therefore spoke like a cat in walnut shells, and\r\n    had, like a man who makes a miss at billiards, to 'play for safety.'\r\n    I am quite with you on the subject of the acquisition of land by\r\n    local authorities, and also on free education, which seem to be your\r\n    two _sine qua nons_. As to what you say about remaining outside a\r\n    new Liberal Government, forgive me for saying that is all nonsense.\r\n    If a Liberal Government cannot be formed with you and Dilke, it\r\n    certainly cannot be formed without you. You have acquired the right\r\n    and the power to make your own conditions, and I am sure they will\r\n    be reasonable ones.\"'\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt omitted to consider the possibility of a Government\r\nbeing formed--as actually happened--while the charges against Sir\r\nCharles were still untried. Politically, he made an omission which was\r\nless natural; once more there is no reference to the Irish problem and\r\nits effect. Yet in Mr. Gladstone's mind it was daily becoming more\r\ninsistent.\r\n\r\n    'On September 28th Chamberlain wrote enclosing a letter from Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, and his reply:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    '\"I felt well pleased and easy after receiving your note of the\r\n    21st, but there is a point I should like to put to you with\r\n    reference to your self-denying ordinance making the three points\r\n    conditions of office.\r\n\r\n    '\"Suppose Parnell to come back eighty to ninety strong, to keep them\r\n    together, to bring forward a plan which shall contain in your\r\n    opinion adequate securities for the union of the Empire, and to\r\n    press this plan, under whatever name, as having claims to precedence\r\n    (claims which could hardly be denied even by opponents), do you\r\n    think no Government should be formed to promote such a plan, unless\r\n    the three points were glued on to it at the same time? Do you not\r\n    think you would do well to reserve elbow-room for a case like this?\r\n    I hope you will not think my suggestion--it is not a question--\r\n    captious and a man-trap. It is meant in a very different sense. A\r\n    Liberal majority is assumed in it.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n    '\"W. E. Gladstone.\"'\r\n\r\nWhen that letter reached Highbury, Sir Charles was in France, awaiting\r\nMrs. Pattison's arrival from India. Mr. Chamberlain's reply was written\r\nwithout consultation on September 28th. In it he said that he had\r\nassumed that Local Government would be the first work of a Liberal\r\nGovernment, and that Bills for the three countries would be brought in\r\ntogether. Mr. Parnell's change of front would, he thought, have limited\r\nthe proposals to the establishment of County Councils, with certain\r\npowers for the acquisition of land by Local Authorities. He thought it\r\nunlikely that Parnell would bring forward a scheme that any Liberal\r\nGovernment could support; but if he did, he would do all he could to\r\nassist the Government in dealing with it, whether from inside or outside\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nChamberlain further urged Dilke to lay stress on the determination of\r\nhis party not to be 'mere lay figures in a Cabinet of Goschens.' He\r\nregarded his party as indispensable, and if the Government tried to do\r\nwithout them, they were determined to make trouble. He expressed an\r\nearnest wish that Sir Charles Dilke could be working with them; but he\r\ndid not press this at the moment, if Sir Charles was taking a holiday\r\nafter his marriage.\r\n\r\nDilke took the briefest of holidays; on October 6th, three days after\r\nhis wedding, he spoke at Chelsea. After dwelling at length on\r\nChamberlain's proposal to give powers of compulsory land purchase to\r\nlocal authorities, he asked for the widest form of elective self-\r\ngovernment for Ireland consistent with the integrity of the Empire,\r\n[Footnote: 'In my individual opinion, the natural crowning stone of any\r\nlarge edifice of local government must sooner or later be some such\r\nelective Local Government Board for each of the three principal parts of\r\nthe United Kingdom and for the Principality of Wales, as I have often\r\nsketched out to you. As regards Ireland, we all of us here, I think,\r\nagree that the widest form of elective self-government should be\r\nconferred which is consistent with the integrity of the Empire. No one\r\ncan justify the existence of the nominated official Boards which at\r\npresent attempt to govern Ireland. I care not whether the Irish people\r\nare or are not at the moment willing to accept the changes we have to\r\npropose. If the present system is as indefensible as I think it, we\r\nshould propose them all the same. If they are not at first accepted, our\r\nscheme will at least be seen and weighed, and we shall be freed from the\r\nnecessity of appearing to defend a system which is obnoxious to every\r\nLiberal principle. I would ask you to remember some words in Mr.\r\nRuskin's chapter on \"The Future of England,\" in his _Crown of Wild\r\nOlive_, which are very applicable to the situation:--\"In Ireland,\r\nespecially, a vicious system has been so long maintained that it has\r\nbecome impossible to give due support to the cause of order without\r\nseeming to countenance injury.\" The bodies which would deal with\r\neducation, with private Bills, with provisional order Bills, and with\r\nappeals from local authorities in matters too large for county\r\ntreatment, in Wales and Scotland and England itself, if I had my way, as\r\nwell as in Ireland, would, I believe, make the future government of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, as a United Kingdom, more easy than it is at present.']\r\nand went on to assume that the first session of the new Parliament would\r\nbe 'a Local Government session.' In the following week 'I made an\r\nimportant speech at Halifax on Local Government which attracted much\r\nattention.' 'Halifax will be all Local Government,' he wrote to Mr.\r\nFrank Hill, 'which is necessary, as it is clear that Balfour and\r\nSalisbury have cribbed my last year's Bill.'\r\n\r\n    'I may note here that on October 6th, at my Chelsea meeting, George\r\n    Russell told me that he had on the previous day induced Mr.\r\n    Gladstone to send for Chamberlain to Hawarden. On October 7th\r\n    Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"Hawarden Castle.\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"I was sent for here, but up to now I do not know why.... My\r\n    present object is to say that you made a capital speech, and that I\r\n    approve every word of it except the part about London Government.\r\n    But as to this I suppose that Londoners must have their way and\r\n    their own form of municipal government though I doubt if it will not\r\n    prove a fatal gift. Why will the papers invent differences between\r\n    you and me? I verily believe that if I spoke your speech, and you\r\n    spoke mine, they would still find the distinguishing characteristics\r\n    of each speaker unchanged. I thought your last part admirable and\r\n    just what I should have said. Yet the _Standard_ thinks it quite a\r\n    different note to the South London and Bradford speeches. Mr. G.\r\n    thinks Mr. Parnell's last speech more satisfactory I confess I had\r\n    not perceived the improvement. He (Mr. G.) is still very sweet on\r\n    National Councils.\"\r\n\r\n    'On October 9th Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I am not quite certain what was Mr. G.'s object in sending for me.\r\n    I suppose he desired to minimize our conditions as far as possible.\r\n    He was very pleasant and very well, with no apparent trace of his\r\n    hoarseness. He spoke at considerable length on the Irish Question;\r\n    said he was more than ever impressed with the advantages of the\r\n    Central Council scheme, and had written strongly to that effect to\r\n    Hartington. But I do not gather that he has any definite plan under\r\n    present circumstances. He thought Parnell's last speech was more\r\n    moderate (I confess I do not agree with him), and I suppose that if\r\n    we get a majority his first effort will be to find a _modus\r\n    vivendi_, and to enter into direct communications with this object.\r\n\r\n    '\"As regards Radical programme I stuck to the terms of your speech,\r\n    namely, first, compulsory powers for acquiring land to be inserted\r\n    in the Local Government Bill. Second, freedom to speak and vote as\r\n    we liked on questions of free schools. He boggled a good deal over\r\n    this, and said it was very weakening to a Government; but I told him\r\n    we could not honestly do less, and that I expected a large majority\r\n    of Liberals were in favour of the proposal. We did not come to any\r\n    positive conclusion, nor do I think that he has absolutely made up\r\n    his mind, but the tone of the conversation implied that he was\r\n    seeking to work with us, and had no idea of doing without us. At the\r\n    close he spoke of his intention to give up the leadership soon after\r\n    the new Parliament met. I protested, and said that if he did this\r\n    our whole attitude would be changed, and we must and should ask from\r\n    Hartington much larger concessions than we were prepared to accept\r\n    from him. I expect the force of circumstances will keep him in his\r\n    place till the end, though I believe he is sincerely anxious to be\r\n    free.\"' [Footnote: Mr. Gladstone's account of this interview is to\r\n    be found in Morley's _Life of Gladstone_, vol. iii., p. 224.]\r\n\r\nOn October 17th Chamberlain wrote 'on another letter of Mr. Gladstone's,\r\nwhich I do not possess:\r\n\r\n    '\"I do not think it is wise to do anything about Mr G.'s letter on\r\n    Ireland. I agree with your recollection of the matter. But Mr. G. is\r\n    not far wrong, and we have our hands full of other things. The Irish\r\n    business is not the first just now.\"\r\n\r\n    'About this time I was taken as arbitrator in a considerable number\r\n    of disputed candidatures, in most of which I acted by myself, and in\r\n    one, the Walworth case, with Chamberlain and John Morley.'\r\n\r\n    'I had been to see Manning, at his wish, with my wife, and he had\r\n    spoken kindly about Chamberlain, on which I wrote to Chamberlain\r\n    about him; and Chamberlain replied:\r\n\r\n    '\"Our experience in the Irish Question has not been encouraging. We\r\n    understood the Cardinal cordially to approve of my scheme of\r\n    National Councils and to be ready to use his influence in any way to\r\n    promote its acceptance. On our part we were prepared to press the\r\n    question at any sacrifice, and to make the adoption of our scheme a\r\n    condition of our membership of any future Government. And yet, when\r\n    the time came to ask the Cardinal for his help, he refused\r\n    categorically so small a matter as an introduction to the Irish\r\n    Bishops, and, as I understood, on the ground that the Conservatives\r\n    were in office. Would not the same influence prevail in the matter\r\n    of education? Besides, I do not see what Cardinal Manning has to\r\n    offer. The majority of English Catholics are Conservative, and no\r\n    concession that it is in our power to make would secure their\r\n    support for the Liberal party. I am therefore of opinion that the\r\n    differences between us can only be decided by the constituencies.\"\r\n\r\n    'The Cardinal wrote concerning Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n    '\"Mr. Chamberlain was good enough to send me his scheme for Local\r\n    Government in Ireland, in which in the main I agree, and did all in\r\n    my power to promote its acceptance. The Government went out, and you\r\n    asked of me to promote what I called a 'Midlothian in Ireland,'\r\n    under the eyes of the new Lord Lieutenant. (I wrote on this to\r\n    Chamberlain: 'I answered this at the time and have done so again\r\n    now.') Did Mr. Chamberlain understand my agreement with his scheme\r\n    as carrying any consequences beyond that scheme or any solidarity in\r\n    such an aggressive action against any party whatsoever in power?...\r\n    In the matter in which he was courteous enough to make known his\r\n    scheme to me, I have promoted it where and in ways he does not\r\n    know.\"\r\n\r\n    'In a day or two there came another letter from Manning:\r\n\r\n    '\"It is true you did disclaim a Midlothian; but I told you that I\r\n    know my Irishmen too well, and believe that even Paul and Barnabas\r\n    would have been carried away. Moreover, if you had been silent as\r\n    fishes, the moral effect would have been a counter-move. Your\r\n    humility does not admit this. So you must absolve me for my one\r\n    word.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain commented in strong terms on the diplomatic methods of\r\nthe great ecclesiastic. The 'countermove' implied that there had been a\r\nTory move in the direction of Home Rule with a view to securing Irish\r\nsupport. Manning believed, as Mr. Gladstone also believed, that the\r\nTories meant business; later it became clear that they had no\r\nconstructive Irish policy at all. Yet the question grew daily more\r\npressing.\r\n\r\n    'At the end of October Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I had a note from Mr. G. this morning urging unity, and saying he\r\n    had an instinct that Irish questions 'might elbow out all others.'\r\n    This makes me uneasy. I hear from another source that he is trying\r\n    to get Parnell's ideas in detail. It is no use.\"'\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Gladstone, Chamberlain wrote, on October 26th, that he could not\r\nsee his way at all about Ireland. He emphasized his view that Ireland\r\nhad better go altogether than the responsibilities of a nominal union be\r\naccepted, and that probably the majority of Liberals would not give more\r\nthan English Local Government; and that, if possible, Irish and English\r\nLocal Government should be dealt with together. Unless the principle of\r\nthe acquisition of land by local authorities was accepted, neither he\r\nnor Dilke nor Morley, nor probably Lefevre, could join the Government.\r\n\r\nThe strife between Chamberlain and Hartington was maintained, and Mr.\r\nGladstone interposed by a letter to the Chief Whip, in which he advised\r\nthe intervention of Lord Granville in view of 'his great tact, prudence,\r\nand experience.' On November 5th Mr. Chamberlain wrote to Sir Charles,\r\nenclosing Mr. Gladstone's letter, and adding:\r\n\r\n    'Mr. G.'s is the most definite proof I have had yet that he does not\r\n    mean to quarrel with us. Lord Granville has just been here. He told\r\n    me nothing about Ireland, but _I am convinced_ that Mr. Gladstone\r\n    has been trying to make a treaty all to himself. It must fail.'\r\n\r\nNo such treaty was made, and on the eve of the General Election of\r\nNovember, 1885, Parnell issued an instruction that the Irish in England\r\nshould vote Tory.\r\n\r\n    'On Tuesday, November 24th, our poll took place in Chelsea, and on\r\n    Wednesday, November 25th, the count, which showed that I was\r\n    returned, although only by a small majority.... The Irish had voted\r\n    for Whitmore, the Conservative candidate, my opponent, in\r\n    consequence of the issue at the last moment of the bill, \"Mr.\r\n    Parnell's order--Vote for the Conservative, Mr. Whitmore. Irishmen,\r\n    do your duty and obey your leader.\"'\r\n\r\n    'I had been summoned by Chamberlain, who desired a meeting of our\r\n    party within the party, in a letter in which he said:\r\n\r\n    '\"It does not look as if the Tories would have the chance of doing\r\n    much mischief; but I should much like them to be in for a couple of\r\n    years before we try again, and then I should 'go for the Church.'\"'\r\n\r\nDilke notes that Chamberlain was persuaded to drop this line of attack,\r\non which he had already embarked. Disestablishment of the Church of\r\nEngland had proved to be anything but a good election cry; the ransom\r\ndoctrine had not brought in more votes than it lost; and the 366 certain\r\nLiberal seats with twenty-six doubtful ones which Mr. Schnadhorst\r\ncounted up at the end of October were now an illusion of the past. The\r\nelection was generally taken as a set-back to the extreme Radicals.\r\n\r\n    'On Saturday, December 5th, we met at Highbury, and remained in\r\n    council until Monday, December 7th. Mr. Gladstone, we were informed\r\n    (that is Morley, Lefevre, and myself), had presented a Home Rule\r\n    scheme to the Queen, who had shown it to Lord Salisbury, and\r\n    Randolph Churchill had told Lady Dorothy Nevill, who had told\r\n    Chamberlain, but no statement had been made by Mr. Gladstone to his\r\n    former colleagues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF THE HOME RULE SPLIT\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1885, TO FEBRUARY, 1886\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting of Radicals, December 5th to 7th, at Highbury, Sir\r\nCharles went back to London.\r\n\r\n    'On Wednesday, December 9th, I spoke at the Central Poor Law\r\n    Conference.... I carried the assembly, which was one of Poor Law\r\n    Guardians, and therefore Conservative, along with me in the opinion\r\n    that it was desirable to elect directly the whole of the new bodies\r\n    in local government, instead of having either a special\r\n    representation of Magistrates or any system of indirect election or\r\n    choice of Aldermen.'\r\n\r\nHe argued in the belief that the next session might still see a Tory\r\nGovernment in power. 'If the Conservatives propose a Local Government\r\nBill,' he said at Chelsea, 'it will be our Local Government Bill which\r\nthey will propose.' He notes: 'They proposed two-thirds of it, and\r\ncarried one-third, in 1888.'\r\n\r\n    'At this moment, not knowing how far Mr. Gladstone was willing to go\r\n    in the Home Rule direction, and that there was, therefore, any\r\n    chance of his securing the real support of the Irish party, I was\r\n    opposed to the attempt to turn out the Government and form a Liberal\r\n    Administration resting on the support of a minority, and I spoke in\r\n    that sense to my constituents. My view was that it would be\r\n    disastrous to advanced Liberalism to form a Government resting on a\r\n    minority, as it would be impossible to carry any legislation not of\r\n    a Conservative type.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote to me on December 15th, with regard to one of my\r\n    speeches, that I was too polite to the Tories. \"This,\" he added, \"is\r\n    where I never err.\"\r\n\r\n    'On December 18th I received some copies of important letters. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's scheme had got out on the 16th, [Footnote: Lord Morley's\r\n    _Life of Gladstone_, vol. iii., pp. 264,265, shows that the \"scheme\r\n    got out\" owing to Sir Charles Dilke's speech to his constituents.\r\n    Mr. Herbert Gladstone came to town on the 14th partly in consequence\r\n    of a speech \"made a few days before by Sir Charles Dilke,\" and the\r\n    talk it caused. The speech was \"taken to mean\" that the two Radical\r\n    leaders preferred keeping the Tories in power \"in the expectation\r\n    that some moderate measures of reform might be got from them, and\r\n    that meanwhile they would become committed with the Irishmen.\r\n    Tactics of this kind were equivalent to the exclusion of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, for in every letter that he wrote he pronounced the Irish\r\n    Question urgent.\" Accordingly, on December 16th there came the\r\n    unauthorized version of Mr. Gladstone's scheme, given to the Press\r\n    through his son.] and on the 17th he wrote to Lord Hartington a\r\n    letter of which the latter sent me a long extract. [Footnote: The\r\n    letter, which has been printed both by Lord Morley and by Mr.\r\n    Bernard Holland, is that in which Mr. Gladstone detailed the\r\n    \"conditions of an admissible plan\" of Home Rule, and expressed a\r\n    determination \"on no account to do or say anything which would\r\n    enable the Nationalists to establish rival biddings between us.\" It\r\n    is so germane to this discussion that part of it is again printed in\r\n    the appendix following this chapter (p. 208).]\r\n\r\n    'At the same time I received a letter from Chamberlain in which he\r\n    said:\r\n\r\n    '\"Have I turned round? Perhaps I have, but it is unconsciously.\r\n    Honestly I thought you went beyond us in your speeches, but I feel\r\n    that your judgment is very likely better and certainly as good as\r\n    mine, and I should have said nothing but for the flood of letters I\r\n    received.\r\n\r\n    '\"The situation changes every minute. The announcement of Mr. G.'s\r\n    plan makes it much more serious; and I altered my speech somewhat\r\n    to-night to meet it, but unless I have failed in my endeavour I have\r\n    not said anything which will embarrass you, and I had you constantly\r\n    in mind throughout. Please read it carefully and let me know exactly\r\n    what you think and how far I have succeeded. I would not put you in\r\n    a hole for a King's ransom if I could avoid it.\r\n\r\n    '\"I agree entirely with you as to dissolution. The Tory game is to\r\n    exaggerate Mr. Gladstone's performance and to go to the country on\r\n    the 'integrity of the Empire.' I have endeavoured to reserve our\r\n    position, and, as to taking office, to make it clear that we are\r\n    opposed to it, unless we can get a big majority, which is\r\n    impossible. Unless I am mistaken, the Gladstone business will\r\n    exclusively occupy attention the next few days, and my speech will\r\n    pass without much notice. But again I say that I have tried (and I\r\n    hope and believe I have succeeded) to avoid anything which may\r\n    appear like contradiction or opposition to your line.\r\n\r\n    '\"Finally, my view is that Mr. G.'s Irish scheme is death and\r\n    damnation; that we must try and stop it; that we must not openly\r\n    commit ourselves against it yet; that we must let the situation\r\n    shape itself before we finally decide; that the Whigs are our\r\n    greatest enemies, and that we must not join them if we can help it;\r\n    that we cannot take office, but must not offer assistance to the\r\n    Tories publicly; that we must say all we can as to their shameful\r\n    bargain and surrender of principle; that even if they bring in good\r\n    measures they will also bring in bad, which we shall be forced to\r\n    oppose; and that the less we speak in public for the present, the\r\n    better.\"\r\n\r\n    'I had told Chamberlain that his speech had given the impression\r\n    that he had turned round.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles, in a further speech to his constituents at Chelsea,\r\nreaffirmed the principles which he had already publicly laid down.\r\n\r\n    'In speaking on the night of Friday, December 18th, at Chelsea, I\r\n    declared that we ought not to allow ourselves to be driven either\r\n    forward or backward from the principles that we had put forward with\r\n    regard to Ireland, and that our course should be to continue to\r\n    propose the measures which we had previously proposed without\r\n    reference to the Parnellite support of Conservative candidates. The\r\n    scheme which I had put forward at the General Election was the one\r\n    to which I adhered. If it had been generally adopted when first\r\n    suggested, it would have received very large support in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nHe then quotes from the report of his speech this sentence: 'We are told\r\nthat now it is too late, but for my part I should not be inclined to\r\nrecede from it because it does not meet with general support.'\r\n\r\nOn this Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '_December 19th_, 1885.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    'The papers this morning seem to show that I have succeeded in\r\n    avoiding any kind of conflict with you. Your own speech was most\r\n    judicious. What a mess Mr. G. has made of it! What will be the end\r\n    of it all? Why the d---- could he not wait till Parnell had\r\n    quarrelled with the Tories? I fancy that a large number, perhaps the\r\n    majority, of Liberals will support _any_ scheme of Mr. G.'s, but I\r\n    doubt if the country will endorse it. The Tories, if they are wise,\r\n    will throw everything else aside and go for the \"Empire in danger,\"\r\n    dissolving at the earliest possible opportunity. The Liberals would\r\n    be divided and distracted, and I think we shall be beaten into a\r\n    cocked hat. Our game--yours and mine--is to avoid definite committal\r\n    for the moment. Circumstances change every hour. Harcourt is coming\r\n    to me on Saturday and Sunday.'\r\n\r\n    'On the next day Chamberlain sent me a copy of a letter to him from\r\n    Mr. Gladstone:\r\n\r\n    '\"_December 18th_, 1885.\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    '\"I thank you very much for your references to me in your speech\r\n    last night.\r\n\r\n    '\"In this really serious crisis we must all make efforts to work\r\n    together; and I gladly recognize your effort.\r\n\r\n    '\"Moreover, reading as well as writing hastily, I think we are very\r\n    much in accord.\r\n\r\n    '\"Both reflection and information lead me to think that time is very\r\n    precious, and that the hour-glass has begun to run for a definitive\r\n    issue.\r\n\r\n    '\"But I am certainly and strongly of opinion that only a Government\r\n    can act, that especially this Government should act, and that we\r\n    should now be helping and encouraging them to act as far as we\r\n    legitimately can.\r\n\r\n    '\"In reply to a proposal of the Central News to send me an\r\n    interviewer, I have this morning telegraphed to London: 'From my\r\n    public declarations at Edinburgh _with respect to the Government_,\r\n    you will easily see that I have no communication to make.'\r\n\r\n    '\"Be _very incredulous_ as to any statements about my views and\r\n    opinions. Rest assured that I have done and said _nothing_ which in\r\n    any way points to negotiation or separate action. The time may come,\r\n    but I hope it will not. At present I think most men, but I do not\r\n    include you, are in too great a hurry to make up their minds. Much\r\n    may happen before (say) January 12th. The first thing of all is to\r\n    know _what will the Government do?_ I know they have been in\r\n    communication with Parnellites, and I hope with Parnell.\r\n\r\n    '\"I remain always,\r\n\r\n    '\"Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n    '\"W. E. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\n    'I fancy that I was the cause of Chamberlain receiving this letter,\r\n    as I had told Brett (who at once wrote to Hawarden) that Chamberlain\r\n    was angry at not having been consulted.'\r\n\r\n    'On December 21st we went down to Pyrford, which was now just\r\n    finished, to stay there for the first time, and remained until\r\n    Christmas Eve. On December 22nd I received a letter from Chamberlain\r\n    from Highbury.'\r\n\r\nIn this letter Mr. Chamberlain chronicled Sir William Harcourt's\r\nvisit--who, after 'raving against the old man and the old cause,' had\r\nleft in better spirits. Mr. Chamberlain was in much doubt whether Mr.\r\nGladstone would go on or would retire after Lord Hartington's letter to\r\nthe Press, [Footnote: This is a reference to Lord Hartington's letter in\r\nthe Press of December 21st, 1885, which he alludes to, in writing to Mr.\r\nGladstone, as \"published this morning\" (_Life of Duke of Devonshire_,\r\nvol. ii., p. 103).] and had written to Mr. Gladstone to say that he did\r\nnot think the country would stand an independent Parliament. He saw\r\nnothing between National Councils and Separation, and wondered whether\r\nMr. Gladstone thought that--in the event of a separate Irish\r\nLegislature--Ireland could be governed by a single Chamber, and England\r\nand Scotland by two.\r\n\r\n    'On December 26th Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I do not envy you the opportunity of speaking on the 31st. It is a\r\n    dangerous time, and I am inclined myself to 'lie low.' Is it\r\n    desirable to say anything? If it is right to speak at all, I think\r\n    something like a full expose of motifs is necessary, and I put the\r\n    following before you as the heads of a discourse.\r\n\r\n    '\"At present there are two different ideas, for settlement of\r\n    Ireland, before the public imagination, viz.: (A) National Councils;\r\n    (B) Separation.\r\n\r\n    '\"As to A, the fundamental principles are supremacy of Imperial\r\n    Parliament and extension of local liberties on municipal lines. It\r\n    is a feasible, practical plan. But it has the fatal objection that\r\n    the Nationalists will not accept it. It is worse than useless to\r\n    impose on them benefits which they repudiate. As to B, everyone\r\n    professes to reject the idea of separation. If it were adopted, I\r\n    have no doubt it would lead to the adoption of the conscription in\r\n    Ireland; then to the conscription in England, and increase of the\r\n    navy; fresh fortifications on the west coast, and finally a war in\r\n    which Ireland would have the support of some other Power, perhaps\r\n    America or France. Between these alternatives there is the hazy idea\r\n    of Home Rule visible in Morley's speech and Gladstone's assumed\r\n    intention. It is dangerous and mischievous to use vague language on\r\n    such a subject. Those who speak ought to say exactly what they mean.\r\n    It will be found that Home Rule includes an independent separate\r\n    Irish Parliament, and that all guarantees and securities, whether\r\n    for the protection of minorities or for the security of the Empire,\r\n    are absolutely illusory.\r\n\r\n    '\"At the same time we are to continue to receive Irish\r\n    representatives at Westminster in the Imperial Parliament, and we\r\n    shall not even get rid of their obstruction and interference here by\r\n    the concession of their independence in Ireland. To any arrangement\r\n    of this kind, unworkable as I believe it to be, I prefer\r\n    separation--to which, indeed, it is only a step.\r\n\r\n    '\"Is there any other possible arrangement which would secure the\r\n    real integrity of the Empire for Imperial purposes, while allowing\r\n    Irishmen to play the devil as they like in Ireland?\r\n\r\n    '\"Yes, there is. But it involves the entire recasting of the British\r\n    Constitution and the full and complete adoption of the American\r\n    system. According to this view you might have five Parliaments, for\r\n    England, Scotland, Wales, Ulster, [Footnote: This is the first\r\n    suggestion of a scheme under which part of Ireland would be\r\n    separated from the rest.] and the three other provinces combined.\r\n    Each Parliament to have its own Ministry, responsible to it and\r\n    dependent on its vote. In addition an Imperial Parliament or\r\n    Reichsrath with another Ministry dealing with foreign and colonial\r\n    affairs, army, navy, post-office, and customs.\r\n\r\n    '\"To carry out this arrangement a Supreme Court or similar tribunal\r\n    must be established, to decide on the respective attributes of the\r\n    several local legislatures and the limits of their authority.\r\n\r\n    '\"The House of Lords must go, or you must establish a separate\r\n    Second Chamber for each legislature.\r\n\r\n    '\"It is impossible to suppose that the authority of the Crown could\r\n    survive these changes for long. One or other of the local\r\n    legislatures would refuse to pay the expense, and, as it would have\r\n    some kind of local militia at its back, it is not likely that the\r\n    other legislatures would engage in civil war for the sake of\r\n    reimposing the nominal authority of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\n    '\"As a Radical all these changes have no terrors for me, but is it\r\n    conceivable that such a clean sweep of existing institutions could\r\n    be made in order to justify the Irish demand for Home Rule? Yet this\r\n    is the only form of federal government which offers any prospect of\r\n    permanence or union for Imperial purposes.\r\n\r\n    '\"If English Liberals once see clearly that indefinite talk about\r\n    Home Rule means either separation or the entire recasting of the\r\n    whole system of English as well as Irish government, they will then\r\n    be in a position to decide their policy. At present they are being\r\n    led by the _Daily News_ and Morley and Co. to commit themselves in\r\n    the dark.\"\r\n\r\n    'Next day, December 27th, Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"The situation (Irish) is now as follows:\r\n\r\n    '\"(1) The Government have been informed that Mr. Gladstone thinks\r\n    this great question should not be prejudiced by party feeling, and\r\n    that he will support them in any attempt they may make to give Home\r\n    Rule to Ireland.\r\n\r\n    '\"(2) Mr. Gladstone has been informed that the Government will see\r\n    him damned first.\r\n\r\n    '\"(3) The Irishmen have been informed that Mr. Gladstone will not\r\n    move a step till the Government have spoken or until the Irish have\r\n    put them in a minority.\r\n\r\n    '\"(4) In either of these events he will do his best to effect a\r\n    thorough settlement. 'He will go forward or fall.'\r\n\r\n    '\"(5) I gather that he will not, as he ought, challenge Parnell to\r\n    say publicly exactly what he wants, but that he will propose his own\r\n    scheme, which is an Irish legislature with a veto reserved to the\r\n    Crown--to be exercised on most questions on the advice of the Irish\r\n    Ministry, but on questions of religion, commerce, and taxation, on\r\n    the advice of the Imperial Ministry.\r\n\r\n    '\"(6) The Irish are suspicious, and have not made up their minds.\r\n    Parnell says nothing, but the rank and file are inclined to give Mr.\r\n    Gladstone his chance and turn him out again if they are not\r\n    satisfied with his proposals.\r\n\r\n    '\"The Tories hope to get out Mr. Gladstone's intentions in debate on\r\n    Address, and threaten another immediate dissolution if they are\r\n    placed in a minority; I think, however, their true policy is and\r\n    will be to let Mr. Gladstone come in and make his proposals. This\r\n    will divide the Liberal party, and in all probability alarm and\r\n    disgust the country.\r\n\r\n    '\"Was there ever such a situation? Test Mr. Gladstone's scheme in\r\n    practice. The Irish Ministry insist on necessity of restoring Irish\r\n    manufactures by protection. The Imperial Parliament veto their\r\n    proposals. Thereupon the Irish representatives join the Tories and\r\n    turn out the Government on a foreign and colonial debate, the same\r\n    Government being in a great majority on all English and Scotch\r\n    questions. How long can such a state of things last? Mr. Gladstone\r\n    will have the support of a portion of the Liberal party--Morley, for\r\n    instance, Storey, the Crofters' representatives, and probably some\r\n    of the Labour representatives. How many more will he get? Will he\r\n    have the majority of the Radicals? Will he have the majority of the\r\n    Liberals, following the party leader like sheep? It is curious to\r\n    see the _Scotsman_ and the _Leeds Mercury_ leading in this\r\n    direction. What are we to do? Certainly I will not join a Government\r\n    pledged to such a mad and dangerous proposal. But this may mean\r\n    isolation for a long time.\r\n\r\n    '\"The prospect is not an inviting one.\r\n\r\n    '\"I have told Harcourt the facts as in the numbered paragraphs. Do\r\n    not say a word to anyone else. Harcourt is perplexed and hesitating.\r\n    I think he is impressed with the danger of Fenian outrages,\r\n    dynamite, and assassination.\r\n\r\n    '\"For myself, I would sooner the Tories were in for the next ten\r\n    years than agree to what I think the ruin of the country.\"\r\n\r\n    'On New Year's Eve, the 31st, we went to Rugby, where I had to make\r\n    the speech alluded to in Chamberlain's letter. I had received an\r\n    invitation, dated December 29th, to a meeting at Devonshire House.\r\n    Hartington wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"You know, no doubt, that Harcourt has had a good deal of\r\n    communication with Chamberlain lately. I hear that Chamberlain will\r\n    be in town on Friday (New Year's Day), and it is proposed that he,\r\n    Harcourt, you, and I, should meet here on Friday at four to talk\r\n    over matters, especially Irish. I have asked Granville to come up if\r\n    he likes. I do not think there would be any advantage in having any\r\n    others, unless Rosebery?\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    '\"Hartington.\"\r\n\r\n    'I sent this letter to Chamberlain with an inquiry as to what he\r\n    knew about the meeting, and he replied on New Year's Eve:\r\n\r\n    '\"The meeting to-morrow was arranged by telegraph.... I suspect Mr.\r\n    Gladstone is inclined to hedge. He refuses to satisfy the Irish by\r\n    any definite statements. I hope they may continue suspicious and\r\n    keep the Tories in for some time.\"'\r\n\r\n    'Yet it was Chamberlain who was to turn out the Tories. On New\r\n    Year's Eve, at Rugby, referring to the Irish Question, I praised the\r\n    speech made by Trevelyan on the previous night as being \"a\r\n    declaration in favour of that scheme of National Councils which he\r\n    supports for Ireland at least, and which was recommended in an able\r\n    article in the _Fortnightly Review_ for Scotland, Ireland, and\r\n    Wales.\" I said: \"I am one of those who have never limited my views\r\n    upon the subject to Ireland. Mr. Trevelyan last night spoke as\r\n    though it were only in Ireland that it was necessary to institute\r\n    some local body to deal with purely local questions--with those\r\n    questions which now come before nominated boards or branches of the\r\n    Executive Government.\" I went on to speak in the sense of Mr.\r\n    Gladstone's letter, in favour of the Conservatives being encouraged\r\n    to propose such Irish remedial legislation.\r\n\r\n    'On New Year's Day, 1886, an important meeting took place at\r\n    Devonshire House between Hartington, Harcourt, Chamberlain, and\r\n    myself. I did not see my way clearly, and did not say much; the\r\n    other three arguing strongly against Mr. Gladstone's conduct in\r\n    having sent Herbert Gladstone to a news agency to let out his views\r\n    for the benefit of the provincial Press, in such a way as to put\r\n    pressure on his colleagues. It seemed to me that the pressure,\r\n    though no doubt unfair and indefensible, had nevertheless been\r\n    pretty successful, as neither Harcourt nor Chamberlain saw their way\r\n    to opposing Mr. Gladstone, although both of them disliked his\r\n    scheme. Hartington only said that he \"thought he could not join a\r\n    Government to promote any such scheme.\" But, then, he would not, I\r\n    pointed out, be asked to do so. He would be asked to join a\r\n    Government to consider something. The practical conclusion come to\r\n    was to write to Mr. Gladstone to urge him to come to London to\r\n    consult his colleagues. On January 4th I heard from Hartington that\r\n    Mr. Gladstone informed him that he had nothing to add to his\r\n    previous letter dated December 17th. Hartington wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I have heard from Mr. Gladstone. He declines to hasten his arrival\r\n    in London, but will be available on the 11th after 4 p.m. for any\r\n    who may wish to see him. He will be at my sister-in-law's (Lady F.\r\n    Cavendish), 21, Carlton House Terrace.... He has done nothing and\r\n    will do nothing to convert his opinions into intentions, for he has\r\n    not the material before him. There is besides the question of\r\n    Parliamentary procedure (this refers to action on the Address). For\r\n    considering this, he thinks the time available in London will be\r\n    ample.\"\r\n\r\n    'In forwarding the correspondence to Chamberlain with a copy of the\r\n    letter of December 17th, 1885, as I was requested by Hartington to\r\n    do, I added that Mr. Gladstone could hardly be said not to have done\r\n    anything which had enabled the Nationalists to establish rival\r\n    biddings between the two sides (to use his phrase), because we knew\r\n    that he had asked Arthur Balfour to go to Lord Salisbury with a\r\n    message from him promising his support if the Government would bring\r\n    in a Home Rule scheme. This he had let out to the Irish.\r\n\r\n    'After this we were in consultation as to whether we ought to see\r\n    Mr. Gladstone separately; and Hartington wrote to me on January\r\n    10th, 1886, from Hardwick, that he did not see how we could decline\r\n    to see Mr. Gladstone separately, but that we might be as reticent as\r\n    we pleased, and could all combine in urging further collective\r\n    consultations; and it was arranged that Hartington himself should\r\n    see Mr. Gladstone on January 12th--the day of the election of the\r\n    Speaker. Mr. Gladstone then informed us all that he would see such\r\n    of us as chose on the afternoon of January 11th, and Chamberlain\r\n    then wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"As far as I know, only Harcourt is going on Monday, and I on\r\n    Tuesday morning. If for _any_ reason you think it well to go, there\r\n    is really not the least objection.\"\r\n\r\n    'I went on the 11th, but nothing of the least importance passed, and\r\n    the same was the case with Chamberlain's interview on the 12th.\r\n    Harcourt was present on the 11th, and evidently in full support of\r\n    Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'On the 15th Labouchere gave a dinner to Chamberlain and Randolph\r\n    Churchill, but I do not think that anything very serious was\r\n    discussed. There was a sharp breach at this moment between\r\n    Chamberlain and Morley, Chamberlain telling Morley that his speeches\r\n    were \"foolish and mischievous,\" and that he was talking \"literary\r\n    nonsense--the worst of all.\"\r\n\r\n    'On January 21st we had a meeting of all the ex-Cabinet at Lord\r\n    Granville's. Chamberlain breakfasted with me before the meeting, and\r\n    he drew and I corrected the amendment which was afterwards accepted\r\n    at the meeting as that which should be supported by the party on the\r\n    Queen's Speech, and which was that moved by Jesse Collings by which\r\n    the Government were turned out on the 26th. The adoption of our\r\n    amendment was very sudden. The leaders had met apparently without\r\n    any policy, and the moment Chamberlain read our \"three acres and a\r\n    cow\" amendment, they at once adopted it without discussion as a way\r\n    out of all their difficulties and differences. [Footnote: This\r\n    amendment was carried by seventy-nine votes, and the Government thus\r\n    overthrown.] The Government resigned on the 28th, and on the 29th I\r\n    had an interview with Chamberlain as to what he should do about\r\n    taking office.\r\n\r\n    'On January 30th Mr. Gladstone offered Chamberlain the Admiralty,\r\n    after Hartington had refused to join the Government. Chamberlain\r\n    came and saw me, and was to go back to Mr. Gladstone at six. He\r\n    thought he had no alternative but to accept a place in the\r\n    Government, although he did not like the Admiralty. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    showed him a form of words as to Irish Home Rule. It was equivalent\r\n    to a passage in Sexton's [Footnote: Home Rule M.P. for S. Sligo,\r\n    1885-1886; Belfast W., 1886-1892.] speech on the 22nd, at which Mr.\r\n    Gladstone had been seen to nod in a manner which implied that he had\r\n    suggested the words. The proposal was, as we knew it would be, for\r\n    inquiry. Chamberlain did not object to the inquiry, but objected to\r\n    the Home Rule. Chamberlain, before returning to Mr. Gladstone, wrote\r\n    him a very stiff letter against Home Rule, which somewhat angered\r\n    him. On Sunday, January 31st, Chamberlain wrote that for personal\r\n    reasons he had sooner not accept the Admiralty. Mr. Gladstone saw\r\n    Chamberlain again later in the day, on the Sunday, and asked what it\r\n    was then that he wanted; to which Chamberlain replied, \"The\r\n    Colonies,\" and Mr. Gladstone answered, \"Oh! A Secretary of State.\"\r\n    Chamberlain was naturally angry at this slight, and being offered by\r\n    Mr. Gladstone the Board of Trade, then refused to return to it.\r\n    After leaving Mr. Gladstone he went to Harcourt, and told Harcourt\r\n    that he would take the Local Government Board, \"but not very\r\n    willingly.\" On Monday, February 1st, I asked Chamberlain to\r\n    reconsider his decision about the Admiralty, and found that he would\r\n    have been willing to have done so, but that it was now too late. On\r\n    the 2nd Mr. Gladstone wrote me a very nice letter quoted above,\r\n    [Footnote: Chapter XLII., p.172.] about the circumstances relating\r\n    to the trial then coming on which made it impossible for him to\r\n    include me in the Ministry. Morley wrote: \"Half my satisfaction and\r\n    confidence are extinguished by your absence. It may and will make\r\n    all the difference.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Morley's apprehension was justified by events.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the position of the Radical leaders, while only private members,\r\nhad been of such strength that Sir Charles had been able to secure, from\r\na reluctant Prime Minister, the terms agreed on between Mr. Chamberlain\r\nand himself. He had obtained for both positions in the Government, and\r\nprocured Cabinet rank for Chamberlain. Now that the power of one of the\r\nallies was demolished, and Mr. Chamberlain stood alone, Mr. Gladstone's\r\nview of the changed situation was apparent. The 'slight' to Chamberlain\r\nwas followed by that course of action which resulted in his breach with\r\nthe Liberal party. Together the two men could, from a far stronger point\r\nof vantage than in 1880, have made their terms; with Mr. Chamberlain\r\nisolated Mr. Gladstone could impose his own. The alteration in the\r\ncourse of English political history which the next few months were to\r\neffect was made finally certain by Sir Charles Dilke's fall.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery wrote on February 3rd to say that he had been appointed\r\nForeign Secretary, an office which in happier circumstances would, he\r\nsaid to Sir Charles, 'have been yours by universal consent.' The letter\r\nwent on to state in very sympathetic words how 'constantly present to\r\nhis mind' was his own inferiority in knowledge and ability to the man\r\nwho had been set aside.\r\n\r\n    'I had written to Rosebery at the same moment, and our letters had\r\n    crossed. I replied to his:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Rosebery,\r\n\r\n    '\"Our letters crossed, but mine was a wretched scrawl by the side of\r\n    yours. I do not know how, with those terrible telegrams beginning to\r\n    fly round you, you find time to write such letters. I could never\r\n    have taken the Foreign Office without the heaviest misgiving, and I\r\n    hope that whenever the Liberals are in, up to the close of my life,\r\n    you may hold it. My 'knowledge' of foreign affairs _is_, I admit to\r\n    you, great, and I can answer questions in the Commons, and I can\r\n    negotiate with foreigners. But these are _not_ the most important\r\n    points. As to the excess of 'ability' with which you kindly and\r\n    modestly credit me, I do not admit it for a moment. I should say\r\n    that you are far more competent to advise and carry through a\r\n    policy--far more competent to send the right replies to those\r\n    telegrams which are the Foreign Office curse. As to questions, these\r\n    are a mere second curse, but form a serious reason why the Secretary\r\n    of State should be in the Lords.\r\n\r\n    '\"I have always said that, if kept for no other reason, the Lords\r\n    should remain as a place for the Secretary of State for the Foreign\r\n    Department, and _I_ think also for the Prime Minister. Between\r\n    ourselves, you will not have quite a fair chance in being Secretary\r\n    of State for the Foreign Department under Mr. Gladstone, because Mr.\r\n    Gladstone _will_ trust to his skill in the House of Commons, and\r\n    _will_ speak and reply when the prudent Under-Secretary would ask\r\n    for long notice or be silent. Lord Granville was always complaining,\r\n    and Mr. Gladstone always promising never to do it again, and always\r\n    doing it every day. [Footnote: See supra, p. 51 and note.] I am\r\n    going to put down a notice to-day to strengthen your hands against\r\n    France in _re_ Diego Suarez.\"\r\n\r\n    'From Bryce I heard that he had been appointed Under-Secretary of\r\n    State for the Foreign Department, and asking me whom he should take\r\n    as his private secretary; and I told him Austin Lee, and he took him\r\n    at once.'\r\n\r\n    'To the Prince of Wales I wrote to say that I should not attend the\r\n    Levee, and had from him a reply marked by that great personal\r\n    courtesy which he always shows.'\r\n\r\nThus came into being Mr. Gladstone's third Administration. In 1885 the\r\ncontinuance of Mr. Gladstone's leadership had seemed necessary in order\r\nto bridge the gap between Lord Hartington and the Radicals. Now in 1886\r\nLord Hartington was out, to mark his opposition, not to Chamberlain, but\r\nto Gladstone; and Chamberlain was in, though heavily handicapped. Yet\r\nnone of these contradictions which had defied anticipation was so\r\nunforeseen as the exclusion of Sir Charles Dilke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSee p. 196. Letter of Mr. Gladstone to Lord Hartington, December 17th,\r\n1885:\r\n\r\n    'The whole stream of public excitement is now turned upon me, and I\r\n    am pestered with incessant telegrams which I have no defence against\r\n    but either suicide or Parnell's method of self-concealment. The\r\n    truth is I have more or less of opinions and ideas, but no\r\n    intentions or negotiations. In these ideas and opinions there is, I\r\n    think, little that I have not more or less conveyed in public\r\n    declarations: in principle, nothing. I will try to lay them before\r\n    you. I consider that Ireland has now spoken, and that an effort\r\n    ought to be made by the _Government_ without delay to meet her\r\n    demand for the management, by an Irish legislative body, of Irish as\r\n    distinct from Imperial affairs. Only a Government can do it, and a\r\n    Tory Government can do it more easily and safely than any other.\r\n\r\n    'There is first a postulate--that the state of Ireland shall be such\r\n    as to warrant it.\r\n\r\n    'The conditions of an admissible plan, I think, are--\r\n\r\n    '(1) Union of the Empire and due supremacy of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    '(2) Protection for the minority. A difficult matter on which I have\r\n    talked much with Spencer, certain points, however, remaining to be\r\n    considered.\r\n\r\n    '(3) Fair allocation of Imperial charges.\r\n\r\n    '(4) A statutory basis seems to me to be better and safer than the\r\n    revival of Grattan's Parliament, but I wish to hear more upon this,\r\n    as the minds of men are still in so crude a state on the whole\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    '(5) Neither as opinions nor as intentions have I to anyone alive\r\n    promulgated these ideas as decided on by me.\r\n\r\n    '(6) As to intentions, I am determined to have none at present--to\r\n    leave space to the Government--I should wish to encourage them if I\r\n    properly could--above all, on no account to say or do anything which\r\n    would enable the Nationalists to establish rival biddings between\r\n    us.\r\n\r\n    'If this storm of rumours continues to rage, it may be necessary for\r\n    me to write some new letter to my constituents, but I am desirous to\r\n    do nothing, simply leaving the field open for the Government, until\r\n    time makes it necessary to decide. Of our late colleagues, I have\r\n    had most communication with Granville, Spencer, and Rosebery. Would\r\n    you kindly send this on to Granville? I think you will find it in\r\n    conformity with my public declarations, though some blanks are\r\n    filled up. I have in truth thought it my duty, without in the least\r\n    committing myself or anyone else, to think through the subject as\r\n    well as I could, being equally convinced of its urgency and its\r\n    bigness.'\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this letter is not quoted in the Memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST HOME RULE BILL\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY TO JULY, 1886\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acute political crisis now maturing within the Liberal party had a\r\nspecial menace for Sir Charles Dilke. It threatened to affect a personal\r\ntie cemented by his friend's stanchness through these months of trouble.\r\n\r\nOn January 31st, 1886, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    'I feel that our friendship is going to be subjected to the heaviest\r\n    strain it has ever borne, and I wish to minimize any risks to it, in\r\n    which, however, I don't believe. I am determined that it shall not\r\n    dwindle into a form or pretence of friendship of which the substance\r\n    has departed. It will be a great change if I do not feel that I can\r\n    go to your house or to your room as freely as ever. At the same time\r\n    confidence from one in the inner circle of the Cabinet to one wholly\r\n    outside the Government is not easy, and reserve makes all\r\n    conversation untrue. I think the awkwardness will be less if I\r\n    abstain from taking part in home affairs (unless, indeed, in\r\n    supporting my Local Government Bill, should that come up). In\r\n    Foreign Affairs we shall not be brought into conflict, and to\r\n    Foreign and Colonial affairs I propose to return.\r\n\r\n    'I intend to sit behind (in Forster's seat), not below the gangway,\r\n    as long as you are in the Government.\r\n\r\n    'There is one great favour which I think you will be able to do me\r\n    without any trouble to yourself, and that is to let my wife come to\r\n    your room to see me _between_ her lunch and the meeting of the\r\n    House. The greatest nuisance about being out is that I shall have to\r\n    go down in the mornings to get my place, and to sit in the library\r\n    all day....\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    'Chs. W. D'\r\n\r\nWhen the first trial of the divorce case was over (almost before Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government had fairly assumed office), in the period during\r\nwhich Sir Charles designedly absented himself from the House of Commons,\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain asked me to act on the Committee to revise my Local\r\n    Government Bill, and to put it into a form for introduction to the\r\n    House; and I attended at the Local Government Board throughout the\r\n    spring at meetings at which Chamberlain, if present, presided.... It\r\n    is a curious fact that I often presided over this Cabinet Committee,\r\n    though not a member of the Government.'\r\n\r\n    During the month of February, while the Press campaign against him\r\n    was ripening, Sir Charles had little freedom of mind for politics.\r\n    Yet this was the moment when Mr. Chamberlain's action, decisive for\r\n    the immediate fate of a great question, had to be determined. Sir\r\n    Charles had been a conducting medium between Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\n    Chamberlain. He was so no longer. \"I wonder,\" wrote Chamberlain,\r\n    years after, on reading Dilke's Memoir, \"what passed in that most\r\n    intricate and Jesuitical mind in the months between June and\r\n    December, 1885.\" Perhaps the breach that came was unavoidable. But\r\n    at all events the one man who might have prevented it was at the\r\n    critical moment hopelessly involved in the endeavour to combat the\r\n    scandal that assailed him. [Footnote: There is a letter of this date\r\n    to Mr. John Morley:\r\n\r\n    '76, Sloane Street, S.W.,\r\n\r\n    '_February 2nd_.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Morley,\r\n\r\n    'As I must not yet congratulate you on becoming at a bound Privy\r\n    Councillor and member of the Cabinet, let me in the meantime\r\n    congratulate you on your election as a V.P. of the Chelsea Liberal\r\n    Association. But seriously, there can be no doubt that you now have\r\n    sealed the great position which you had already won. My _one_ hope\r\n    is that you will work;--my hope, not for your own sake, but for the\r\n    sake of Radical principles--as completely with Chamberlain as I did.\r\n    It is the only way to stand against the overwhelming numbers of the\r\n    Whig peers. I fear Mr. Gladstone will find his new lot of Whig peers\r\n    just as troublesome as the old.\r\n\r\n    'As long as I am out and _my friends_ are in, I shall sit, not in my\r\n    old place below the gangway, but behind, and do anything and\r\n    everything that I can do to help.\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    'Chs. W. D.\r\n\r\n    'I _hope_ it is true that Stansfeld is back?'\r\n\r\nIt was not till March 3rd, 1886, that\r\n\r\n    'I resumed my attendance at the House of Commons, and Joseph Cowen,\r\n    the member for Newcastle, did what he could to make it pleasant. I\r\n    wrote to him, and he replied: \"It is a man's duty to stick to his\r\n    friends when they are 'run at' as you have been.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On March 4th a meeting of the Local Government Committee at\r\n    Chamberlain's was put off by the absence of Thring, who had been\r\n    sent for by Mr. Gladstone with instructions to draw a Home Rule\r\n    Bill. I went to Chamberlain's house, he being too cross to come to\r\n    the House of Commons, and held with him an important conversation as\r\n    to his future. I tried to point out to him that if he went out, as\r\n    he was thinking of doing, he would wreck the party, who would put up\r\n    with the Whigs going out against Mr. Gladstone on Home Rule, but who\r\n    would be rent in twain by a Radical secession. He would do this, I\r\n    told him, without much popular sympathy, and it was a terrible\r\n    position to face. He told me that he had said so much in the autumn\r\n    that he felt he _must_ do it. I said, \"Certainly. But do not go out\r\n    and fight. Go out and lie low. If honesty forces you out, well and\r\n    good, but it does not force you to fight.\" He seemed to agree, at\r\n    all events at the moment.\r\n\r\n    'On March 13th there was a Cabinet, an account of which I had from\r\n    Chamberlain, who was consulting me daily as to his position. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone expounded his land proposals, which ran to 120 millions of\r\n    loan, and on which Chamberlain wrote: \"As a result of yesterday's\r\n    Council, I think Trevelyan and I will be out on Tuesday. If you are\r\n    at the House, come to my room after questions.\" I went to\r\n    Chamberlain's room and met Bright with him. But real consultation in\r\n    presence of Bright was impossible, because Bright was merely\r\n    disagreeable. On Monday, the 15th, Chamberlain and Trevelyan wrote\r\n    their letters of resignation, and late at night Chamberlain showed\r\n    me the reply to his. On the same day James told me that the old and\r\n    close friendship between Harcourt and himself was at an end, they\r\n    having taken opposite sides with some warmth. On the 16th\r\n    Chamberlain wrote to Mr. Gladstone that he thought he had better\r\n    leave him, as he could only attend his Cabinets in order to gather\r\n    arguments against his schemes; and Mr. Gladstone replied that he had\r\n    better come all the same.\r\n\r\n    'On the 22nd I had an interesting talk with Sexton about the events\r\n    of the period between April and June, 1885. Sexton said that he had\r\n    agreed to the Chamberlain plan in conversation with Manning, but it\r\n    was as a Local Government plan, not to prevent, so far as he was\r\n    concerned, the subsequent adoption of a Parliament. It was on this\r\n    day that Chamberlain's resignation became final. On March 26th I,\r\n    having to attend a meeting on the Irish question under the auspices\r\n    of the Chelsea Liberal Association, showed Chamberlain a draft of\r\n    the resolution which I proposed for it. I had written: \"That while\r\n    this meeting is firmly resolved on the maintenance of the Union\r\n    between Great Britain and Ireland, it is of opinion that the wishes\r\n    of the Irish people in favour of self-government, as expressed at\r\n    the last election, should receive satisfaction.\" Chamberlain wrote\r\n    back that the two things were inconsistent, and that the Irish\r\n    wishes as expressed by Parnell were for separation. But his only\r\n    suggestion was that I should insert \"favourable consideration\" in\r\n    place of \"satisfaction,\" which did not seem much change. This,\r\n    however, was the form in which the resolution was carried by an open\r\n    Liberal public meeting, and it is an interesting example of the\r\n    fluidity of opinion in the Liberal party generally at the moment. A\r\n    rider to the effect that the meeting had complete confidence in Mr.\r\n    Gladstone was moved, but from want of adequate support was not put\r\n    to the meeting. I violently attacked the land purchase scheme in my\r\n    speech, suspended my judgment upon the Home Rule scheme until I saw\r\n    it, but declared that it was \"one which, generally speaking, so far\r\n    as I know it, I fancy I should be able to support.\" On this same day\r\n    Cyril Flower told me that on the previous day the Irish members had\r\n    informed Mr. Gladstone that it was their wish that he should\r\n    entirely abandon that land purchase scheme which he had adopted for\r\n    the sake of conciliating Lord Spencer. On March 27th Chamberlain\r\n    wrote: \"My resignation has been accepted by the Queen, and is now\r\n    therefore public property. We have a devil of a time before us.\"\r\n\r\n    'On April 5th there was a misunderstanding between Hartington and\r\n    Chamberlain which almost shivered to pieces the newborn Liberal\r\n    Unionist party. Hartington had taken to having meetings of James and\r\n    some of the other more Whiggish men who were acting with him, which\r\n    meetings Chamberlain would not attend, and at these meetings\r\n    resolutions were arrived at to which Chamberlain paid no attention.\r\n    Chamberlain consulted me as to the personal question between\r\n    Hartington and himself, and placed in my hands the letters which\r\n    passed.'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was to introduce his Home Rule Bill on April 8th, and on\r\nthe 5th Lord Hartington wrote to Chamberlain announcing that he had\r\n'very unwillingly' decided to follow Mr. Gladstone immediately, 'not, of\r\ncourse, for the purpose of answering his speech, but to state in general\r\nterms why that part of the party which generally approves of my course\r\nin declining to join the Government is unable to accept the measure\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone will describe to us.'\r\n\r\nChamberlain replied on April 6th to Lord Hartington that his letter had\r\nsurprised him. Having tendered his resignation on March 15th, he had\r\nkept silence as to his motives and intentions. He said he thought that\r\nit was understood that retiring Ministers were expected to take the\r\nfirst opportunity of explaining their resignations, and Trevelyan and he\r\nwere alone in a position to say how far Mr. Gladstone might have\r\nmodified his proposals since their resignations, and thus to initiate\r\nthe subsequent debate. He objected to what he understood to be Lord\r\nHartington's proposed course--namely, formally to oppose Mr. Gladstone's\r\nscheme immediately on its announcement; and this he thought not only a\r\ntactical error, but also discourteous to Trevelyan and himself.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain went on, however, virtually to accept Hartington's\r\n    suggestion, and the real reason was that he had not received the\r\n    Queen's permission to speak upon the land purchase scheme, and that\r\n    he did not want to make his real statement until he was in a\r\n    position to do this. Chamberlain, in sending me this correspondence,\r\n    said that Hartington's proposal was \"dictated by Goschen's uneasy\r\n    jealousy.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles at this moment believed it possible that Mr. Chamberlain\r\nmight carry his point against Mr. Gladstone as to the continued\r\nrepresentation of Ireland at Westminster, and, although he disliked this\r\nproposal, desired its success because it would retain Mr. Chamberlain in\r\nthe party. This is the moment at which Dilke's influence, had he\r\nretained his old position, would probably have proved decisive. What Mr.\r\nGladstone would not yield to Chamberlain alone he would probably have\r\nyielded to the two Radicals combined; and Mr. Chamberlain, deprived of\r\nthe argument to which he gave special prominence, could scarcely have\r\nresisted his friend's wish that he should support the second reading.\r\nSir Charles wrote, April 7th, 1886:\r\n\r\n    'I don't like the idea of the Irish throwing all their ferocity\r\n    against you, and treating you as they treated Forster. Unless you\r\n    are given a very large share in the direction of the business, I\r\n    think you must let it be known that you are not satisfied with the\r\n    Whig line. I hate the prospect of your being driven into coercion as\r\n    a follower of a Goschen-Hartington-James-Brand-Albert Grey clique,\r\n    and yet treated by the Irish as the Forster of the clique. I believe\r\n    from what I see of my caucus, and from the two large _public_\r\n    meetings we have held for discussion, that the great mass of the\r\n    party will go for Repeal, though fiercely against the land. Enough\r\n    will go the other way to risk all the seats, but the party will go\r\n    for Repeal, and sooner or later now Repeal will come, whether or not\r\n    we have a dreary period of coercion first. I should decidedly let it\r\n    be known that you won't stand airs from Goschen.\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    'Chs. W. D.'\r\n\r\n    'Another meeting on the Irish Question in Chelsea led to no clearer\r\n    expression of opinion than had the previous one, for it was\r\n    concluded by Mr. Westlake, Q.C., M.P., who afterwards voted against\r\n    the Home Rule Bill, moving that the meeting suspend its judgment,\r\n    and Mr. Firth, who was a Gladstonian candidate and afterwards a Home\r\n    Rule member, seconding this resolution, which was carried\r\n    unanimously.'\r\n\r\n    'On April 20th Labouchere wrote to me as to an attempt which he was\r\n    making to heal the breach between Mr. Gladstone and Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote on April 22nd from Highbury: \"I got through my\r\n    meeting last night splendidly. Schnadhorst has been doing everything\r\n    to thwart me, but the whole conspiracy broke down completely in face\r\n    of the meeting, which was most cordially enthusiastic. The feeling\r\n    against the Land Bill was overwhelming. As regards Home Rule, there\r\n    is no love for the Bill, but only a willingness to accept the\r\n    principle as a necessity, and to hope for a recasting of the\r\n    provisions. There is great sympathy with the old man personally, and\r\n    at the same time a soreness that he did not consult his colleagues\r\n    and party. Hartington's name was hissed. They cannot forgive him for\r\n    going to the Opera House with Salisbury. I continue to receive many\r\n    letters of sympathy from Radicals and Liberals, and invitations to\r\n    address meetings, but I shall lie low now for some time. The\r\n    Caucuses in the country are generally with the Government, but there\r\n    will be a great number of abstentions at an election.... Parnell is\r\n    apparently telling a good many lies just now. He told W. Kenrick the\r\n    other day, not knowing his relationship at first, that I had made\r\n    overtures to him for Home Rule, which showed my opposition to Mr. G.\r\n    to be purely personal. I have sent him word that he has my leave to\r\n    publish anything ever written or said by me on the Irish Question,\r\n    either to him or to anyone else.... I have a list of 109 men who at\r\n    one time or another have promised to vote against the second\r\n    reading, but they are not all stanch, and I do not think any\r\n    calculation is to be relied on.\"\r\n\r\n    'On April 24th Labouchere wrote that Chamberlain and Morley could\r\n    not be got together, Chamberlain sticking to his phrases, and Morley\r\n    writing that Chamberlain's speech is an attempt to coerce the\r\n    Government, and they won't stand coercion.\r\n\r\n    'On April 30th Chamberlain wrote to me from Birmingham to get me to\r\n    vote with him against the second reading. \"The Bill is doomed. I\r\n    have a list of 111 Liberals pledged against the second reading. Of\r\n    these I know that fifty-nine have publicly announced their\r\n    intentions to their constituents. I believe that almost all the rest\r\n    are certain; but making every allowance for desertions, the Home\r\n    Rule Bill cannot pass without the changes I have asked for. If these\r\n    were made, I reckon that at least fifty of the malcontents would\r\n    vote for the second reading. Besides my 111 there are many more who\r\n    intend to vote for amendments in Committee. The Land Bill has hardly\r\n    any friends;\" and then he strongly pressed me to go down to Highbury\r\n    upon the subject.'\r\n\r\nTo this Sir Charles replied:\r\n\r\n    'Pyrford,\r\n\r\n    '_May Day_, 1886.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    'Lots of people have written to me, confident statements having been\r\n    made that I was against the Bills, which I see Heneage repeats in\r\n    the _Times_ to-day. I have replied that I was strongly against the\r\n    Bill for land purchase, but that as regards the chief Bill I had\r\n    said nothing, and was free to vote as I thought right when the time\r\n    came. I have called my caucus for Friday. We don't have reporters,\r\n    but I think I ought to tell them what I mean to do, and why.\r\n\r\n    'As to our being separated, I am most anxious, as you know, that you\r\n    should not vote against the second reading. I know the Bill is\r\n    doomed, but I fancy the Government know that, too, and that some\r\n    change will be made or promised, and it is a question of how much.\r\n    My difficulty in being one to _ask_ for those changes you want is\r\n    that I am against the chief change, as you know. If it is made--as\r\n    seems likely--I shall keep quiet and not say I am against it, but go\r\n    with you and the rest. But--what if it is not made? You see, I have\r\n    said over and over again that, if forced to have a big scheme, I had\r\n    sooner get rid of the Irish members, and that, if forced to choose\r\n    between Repeal and Federation, I prefer Repeal to any scheme of\r\n    Federation I have ever heard of. Now, all this I can swallow\r\n    quietly--yielding my own judgment--if I go with the party; but I\r\n    can't well fight against the party for a policy which is opposed to\r\n    my view of the national interest. If it is of any use that I should\r\n    remain free up to the last instant, I can manage this. I can explain\r\n    my views in detail to the caucus, and not say which way I intend to\r\n    vote; but I do not well see how, when it comes to the vote, I can\r\n    fail to vote for the second reading.\r\n\r\n    'The reason, as you know, why I am so anxious for YOU (which matters\r\n    more than I matter at present or shall for a long time) to find\r\n    yourself able if possible to take the offers made you, and vote for\r\n    the second reading, is that the dissolution will wreck the party,\r\n    but yet leave _a_ party--democratic, because all the moderates will\r\n    go over to the Tories: poor, because all the subscribers will go\r\n    over to the Tories; more Radical than the party has ever been; and\r\n    yet, as things now stand, with you outside of it.'\r\n\r\nChamberlain wrote on May 3rd from Highbury:\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    'Your letter has greatly troubled me. My pleasure in politics has\r\n    gone, and I hold very loosely to public life just now.\r\n\r\n    'The friends with whom I have worked so long are many of them\r\n    separated from me. The party is going blindly to its ruin, and\r\n    everywhere there seems a want of courage and decision and principle\r\n    which almost causes one to despair. I have hesitated to write to you\r\n    again, but perhaps it is better that I should say what is in my\r\n    mind. During all our years of intimacy I have never had a suspicion,\r\n    until the last few weeks, that we differed on the Irish Question.\r\n    You voted for Butt, and I assumed that, like myself, you were in\r\n    favour of the principle of federation, although probably, like\r\n    myself also, you did not think the time had come to give practical\r\n    effect to it. The retention of the Irish representatives is clearly\r\n    the touchstone. If they go, separation must follow. If they remain,\r\n    federation is possible whenever local assemblies are established in\r\n    England and Scotland. Without the positive and absolute promise of\r\n    the Government that the Irish representation will be maintained, I\r\n    shall vote against the second reading. You must do what your\r\n    conscience tells you to be right, and, having decided, I should\r\n    declare the situation publicly at once.\r\n\r\n    'It will do you harm on the whole, but that cannot be helped, if you\r\n    have made up your mind that it is right. But you must be prepared\r\n    for unkind things said by those who know how closely we have been\r\n    united hitherto. The present crisis is, of course, life and death to\r\n    me. I shall win if I can, and if I cannot I will cultivate my\r\n    garden. I do not care for the leadership of a party which should\r\n    prove itself so fickle and so careless of national interests as to\r\n    sacrifice the unity of the Empire to the precipitate impatience of\r\n    an old man--careless of the future in which he can have no part--and\r\n    to an uninstructed instinct which will not take the trouble to\r\n    exercise judgment and criticism.\r\n\r\n    'I hope you have got well through your meeting to-night. I send this\r\n    by early post to-morrow before I can see the papers.\r\n\r\n    'Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    'J. Chamberlain.'\r\n\r\n    'The meeting to which Chamberlain in his letter referred was that at\r\n    Preece's Riding School, in which I announced that I had succeeded in\r\n    inducing the Queen's Proctor to intervene.... The meeting was a very\r\n    fine one, and the next day Chamberlain wrote to congratulate me on\r\n    it and on my speech, and added: \"Labouchere writes me that the\r\n    Government are at last alive to the fact that they cannot carry the\r\n    second reading without me, and that Mr. G. is going to give way. I\r\n    hope it is true, but I shall not believe it till he has made a\r\n    public declaration.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles replied:\r\n\r\n    '76, Sloane Street, S.W.,\r\n\r\n    '_Wednesday, May 5th_, 1886.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    '... It is a curious fact that we should without a difference have\r\n    gone through the trials of the years in which we were rivals, and\r\n    that the differences and the break should have come now that I\r\n    have--at least in my own belief, and that of most people--ceased for\r\n    ever to count at all in politics.... The fall was, as you know, in\r\n    my opinion final and irretrievable on the day on which the charge\r\n    was made in July last--as would be that, in these days, of any man\r\n    against whom such a false charge was made by conspiracy and careful\r\n    preparation. I think, as I have always thought, that the day will\r\n    come when all will know, but it will come too late for political\r\n    life to be resumed with power or real use....\r\n\r\n    'You say you never had a suspicion that we differed on the Irish\r\n    Question. As to land purchase--yes: we used to differ about it; and\r\n    we do not differ about the present Bill. As to the larger question--\r\n    when Morley and I talked it over with you in the autumn, I said\r\n    that, if I had to take a large scheme, I inclined rather to Repeal,\r\n    or getting rid of the Irish members, than to Home Rule. I don't\r\n    think, however, that I or you had either of us very clear or\r\n    definite views, and I am sure that Morley hadn't. You inclined to\r\n    stick to National Councils only, and I never heard you speak of\r\n    Federation until just before you spoke on the Bill in Parliament. I\r\n    spoke in public against Federation in the autumn in reply to\r\n    Rosebery.\r\n\r\n    'I do not pretend to have clear and definite views now, any more\r\n    than I had then. I am so anxious, for you personally, and for the\r\n    Radical cause, that anything shall be done by the Government that\r\n    will allow you to vote for the second reading, and so succeed to the\r\n    head of the party purged of the Whig element; so anxious, that,\r\n    while I don't really see my way about Federation, and on the whole\r\n    am opposed to it, I will pretend to see my way, and try and find\r\n    hope about it; so anxious, that, though I still incline to think (in\r\n    great doubt) that it would be better to get rid of the Irish\r\n    members, I said in my last, I think, I would be silent as to this,\r\n    and joyfully see the Government wholly alter their scheme in your\r\n    sense. I still hope for the Government giving the promise that you\r\n    ask. Labouchere has kept me informed of all that has passed, and I\r\n    have strongly urged your view on Henry Fowler, who agrees with you,\r\n    and on the few who have spoken to me. I care (in great doubt as to\r\n    the future of Ireland and as to that of the Empire) more about the\r\n    future of Radicalism, and about your return to the party and escape\r\n    from the Whigs, than about anything else as to which I am clear and\r\n    free from doubt. I don't think that my circumstances make any\r\n    declaration or any act of mine necessary, and on Friday at the\r\n    private meeting I need not declare myself, and can perhaps best help\r\n    bring about the promise which you want by not doing so. Why don't\r\n    you deal with the Chancellor (Lord Herschell), instead of with\r\n    Labouchere, O'Shea, and so forth?\r\n\r\n    'I care so much (not about what you name, and it is a pity you\r\n    should do so, for one word of yourself is worth more with me than\r\n    the opinion of the whole world)--not about what people will say, but\r\n    about what you think, that I am driven distracted by your tone. I\r\n    beg you to think that I do not consider myself in this at all,\r\n    except that I should wish to so act as to act rightly. Personal\r\n    policy I should not consider for myself. My seat here will go,\r\n    either way, for certain, as it is a Tory seat now, and will become a\r\n    more and more Tory seat with each fresh registration. If I should\r\n    make any attempt to remain at all in political life, I do not think\r\n    that my finding another seat would depend on the course I take in\r\n    this present Irish matter. This thing will be forgotten in the\r\n    common resistance of the Radicals to Tory coercion. I think, then,\r\n    that by the nature of things I am not influenced by selfish\r\n    considerations. As to inclination, I feel as strongly as any man can\r\n    as to the _way_ in which Mr. Gladstone has done this thing, and all\r\n    my inclination is therefore to follow you, where affection also\r\n    leads. But if this is to be--what it will be--a fight, not as to the\r\n    way and the man, and the past, but as to the future, the second\r\n    reading will be a choice between acceptance of a vast change which\r\n    has in one form or the other become inevitable, and on the other\r\n    side Hartington-Goschen opposition, with coercion behind it. I am\r\n    only a camp follower now, but my place is not in the camp of the\r\n    Goschens, Hartingtons, Brands, Heneages, Greys. I owe something,\r\n    too, to my constituents. There can be no doubt as to the feeling of\r\n    the rank and file, from whom I have received such hearty support and\r\n    following. If I voted against the second reading, unable as I should\r\n    be honestly to defend my vote as you could and would honestly defend\r\n    yours, by saying that all turned on the promise as to the retention\r\n    of the Irish members, I should be voting without a ground or a\r\n    defence, except that of personal affection for you, which is one\r\n    which it is wholly impossible to put forward. If I voted against the\r\n    second reading, I should vote like a peer, with total disregard to\r\n    the opinion of those who sent me to Parliament. Their overwhelming\r\n    feeling--and they never cared for Mr. Gladstone, and do not care for\r\n    him--is, hatred of the Land Bill, but determination to have done\r\n    with coercion. They look on the second reading as a declaration for\r\n    or against large change. They believe that the Irish members will be\r\n    kept, though they differ as to whether they want it. Both you and I\r\n    regard large change as inevitable, and it is certain that as to the\r\n    form of it you must win. The exclusion of the Irish has no powerful\r\n    friends, save Morley, and he knows he is beaten and must give way. I\r\n    still in my heart think the case for the exclusion better than the\r\n    case against it, but all the talk is the other way. The _Pall Mall_\r\n    is helping you very powerfully, for it _is_ a tremendous power, and\r\n    even Mr. G., I fancy, is really with you about it, and not with\r\n    Morley. It seems to me that they must accept your own terms.\r\n\r\n    'The meeting was a most wonderful success.\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    'Chs. W. D.\r\n\r\n    'Since I nearly finished this, your other has come, and I have now\r\n    read it. I have only to repeat that I should not negotiate through\r\n    Labouchere, but through a member of the Cabinet of high character\r\n    who agrees in your view. L. is very able and very pleasant, but\r\n    still a little too fond of fun, which often, in delicate matters,\r\n    means mischief.\r\n\r\n    'I have kept no copy of this letter. When one has a \"difference with\r\n    a friend,\" I believe \"prudence dictates\" that one should keep a\r\n    record of what one writes. I have not done so. I can't really\r\n    believe that you would, however worried and badgered and\r\n    misrepresented, grow hard or unkind under torture, any more than I\r\n    have; but you are stronger than I am, and perhaps my weakness helps\r\n    me in this way. I don't believe in the difference, and I have merely\r\n    scribbled all I think in the old way.'\r\n\r\nChamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '_May 6th_, 1886.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    'The strain of the political situation is very great and the best\r\n    and strongest of us may well find it difficult to keep an even mind.\r\n\r\n    'I thank you for writing so fully and freely. It is evident that,\r\n    without meaning it, I must have said more than I supposed, and\r\n    perhaps in the worry of my own mind I did not allow enough for the\r\n    tension of yours.\r\n\r\n    'We never have been rivals. Such an idea has not at any time entered\r\n    my mind, and consequently, whether your position is as desperate as\r\n    you suppose or as completely retrievable as I hope and believe, it\r\n    is not from this point of view that I regard any differences, but\r\n    entirely as questions affecting our long friendship and absolute\r\n    mutual confidence. If we differ now at this supreme moment, it is\r\n    just as painful to me to lose your entire sympathy as if you could\r\n    bring to me an influence as great as Gladstone's himself.\r\n\r\n    'I feel bitterly the action of some of these men ... who have left\r\n    my side at this time, although many of them owe much to me, and\r\n    certainly cannot pretend to have worked out for themselves the\r\n    policy which for various reasons they have adopted. On the\r\n    whole--and in spite of unfavourable symptoms--I think I shall win\r\n    this fight, and shall have in the long-run an increase of public\r\n    influence; but even if this should be the case I cannot forget what\r\n    has been said and done by those who were among my most intimate\r\n    associates, and I shall never work with them again with the\r\n    slightest real pleasure or real confidence. With you it is\r\n    different. We have been so closely connected that I cannot\r\n    contemplate any severance. I hope, as I have said, that this\r\n    infernal cloud on your public life will be dispersed; and if it is\r\n    not I feel that half my usefulness and more--much more--than half my\r\n    interest in politics are gone.... As to the course to be taken, it\r\n    is clear. You must do what you believe to be right, even though it\r\n    sends us for once into opposite lobbies.\r\n\r\n    'I do not really expect the Government to give way, and, indeed, I\r\n    do not wish it. To satisfy others I have talked about conciliation,\r\n    and have consented to make advances, but on the whole I would rather\r\n    vote against the Bill than not, and the retention of the Irish\r\n    members is only, with me, the flag that covers other objections. I\r\n    want to see the whole Bill recast and brought back to the National\r\n    Council proposals, with the changes justified by the altered public\r\n    opinion. I have no objection to call them Parliaments and to give\r\n    them some legislative powers, but I have as strong a dislike as ever\r\n    to anything like a really co-ordinate authority in Ireland, and if\r\n    one is ever set up I should not like to take the responsibility of\r\n    governing England.\r\n\r\n    'I heartily wish I could clear out of the whole busine&s for the\r\n    next twelve months at least. I feel that there is no longer any\r\n    security for anything while Mr. Gladstone remains the foremost\r\n    figure in politics. But as between us two let nothing come.\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever sincerely,\r\n\r\n    'J. Chamberlain.'\r\n\r\n    'On May 7th Chamberlain wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"I hope it will all come right in the end, and though not so\r\n    optimist as I was, I do believe that 'le jour se fera.'\r\n\r\n    '\"I got more names yesterday against the Bill. I have ninety-three\r\n    now. Labouchere declares still that Mr. G. means to give way, and\r\n    has now a plan for the retention of Irish members which is to go to\r\n    Cabinet to-day or to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n    'On May 18th I presided at the special meeting of the London Liberal\r\n    and Radical Council, of which I was President, which discussed the\r\n    Home Rule Bill; but I merely presided without expressing opinions,\r\n    and I discouraged the denunciations of Hartington and Chamberlain,\r\n    which, however, began to be heard, their names being loudly hissed.\r\n    On May 27th we had the meeting of the party on the Bill at the\r\n    Foreign Office, which I attended. But there was no expression of the\r\n    views of the minority.'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain wrote to the Press some phrases of biting comment\r\nconcerning the meeting of the 18th, and Sir Charles made protest in a\r\nprivate letter.\r\n\r\n    'It is a great pity,' he wrote to Chamberlain, 'that you should not\r\n    have done justice to the efforts and speeches of your friends at\r\n    that meeting. Many were there (and the seven delegates from almost\r\n    every association attended, which made the meeting by far the most\r\n    complete representation of the party ever held) simply for the\r\n    purpose of preventing and replying to attacks on you. For every\r\n    attack on you there was a reply; the amendments attacking you were\r\n    both defeated, and a colourless resolution carried, and Claydon,\r\n    Osborn, Hardcastle and others, defended you with the utmost warmth\r\n    and vigour.'\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain wrote to me (May 20th, 1886) about the attacks which\r\n    were being made on him:\r\n\r\n    '\"I was disgusted at the brutality of some of the attacks. I am only\r\n    human, and I cannot stand the persistent malignity of interpretation\r\n    of all my actions and motives without lashing out occasionally. You\r\n    will see that I met your letter with an apology. I might complain of\r\n    its tone, but I don't. This strain and tension is bad for all of us.\r\n    I do not know where it will ultimately lead us, but I fear that the\r\n    mischief already done is irretrievable.\r\n\r\n    '\"I shall fight this matter out to the bitter end, but I am getting\r\n    more and more doubtful whether, when it is out of the way, I shall\r\n    continue in politics. I am 'wounded in the house of my friends,' and\r\n    I have lost my interest in the business.\"\r\n\r\n    'In another letter (May 21st) Chamberlain said: \"Your note makes\r\n    everything right between us. Let us agree to consider everything\r\n    which is said and done for the next few weeks as a dream.\r\n\r\n    '\"I suppose the party must go to smash and the Tories come in. After\r\n    a few years those of us who remain will be able to pick up the\r\n    pieces. It is a hard saying, but apparently Mr. Gladstone is bent on\r\n    crowning his life by the destruction of the most devoted and loyal\r\n    instrument by which a great Minister was ever served.\" [Footnote: In\r\n    a letter of January 2nd, 1886, Lord Hartington, writing to Lord\r\n    Granville, said: \"Did any leader ever treat a party in such a way as\r\n    he (Mr. Gladstone) has done?\" (_Life of Granville_, vol. ii., p.\r\n    478).]\r\n\r\n    'On June 2nd Chamberlain wrote: \"I suppose we shall have a\r\n    dissolution immediately and an awful smash.\" On that day I spoke on\r\n    the Irish Registration Bills in the House of Commons--almost the\r\n    only utterance which I made in the course of this short Parliament.\r\n\r\n    'On June 4th Sir Robert Sandeman, who had sought an interview with\r\n    me to thank me for what I had done previously about the assigned\r\n    districts on the Quetta frontier, came to see me, to tell me the\r\n    present position and to discuss with me Sir Frederick Roberts's\r\n    plans for defence against the eventuality of a Russian advance.'\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Home Rule Bill by a majority of thirty came on June\r\n8th, and the General Election followed. [Footnote: See Morley's _Life of\r\nGladstone_, vol. iii., p. 337, which gives one o'clock on the morning of\r\nthe 8th as the time of decision. Sir Charles's Memoir contains among its\r\npages an article from _Truth_ of October 14th, 1908, marked by him. The\r\narticle, which is called 'The Secret History of the First Home Rule\r\nBill,' states that Mr. Gladstone's language did not make clear that the\r\nproposal to exclude Irish representatives from the Imperial Parliament\r\nwas given up. Mr. Chamberlain, who had made the retention of the Irish\r\nmembers a condition of giving his vote for the second reading, left the\r\nHouse, declaring that his decision to vote against the Bill was final.\r\nThe _Life of Labouchere_, by Algar Thorold, chap, xii., p. 272 _et\r\nseq_., gives the long correspondence between Mr. Chamberlain and Mr.\r\nLabouchere prior to this event.] Sir Charles voted for the Bill.\r\n\r\n    'On July 5th I was beaten at Chelsea, and so left Parliament in\r\n    which I had sat from November, 1868.\r\n\r\n    'The turn-over in Chelsea was very small, smaller than anywhere else\r\n    in the neighbourhood, and showed that personal considerations had\r\n    told in my favour, inasmuch as we gained but a small number of\r\n    Irish, it not being an Irish district, and had it not been for\r\n    personal considerations should have lost more Liberal Unionists than\r\n    we did.\r\n\r\n    'Some of my warmest private and personal friends were forced to work\r\n    and vote against me (on the Irish Question), as, for example, John\r\n    Westlake, Q.C., and Dr. Robert Cust, the learned Secretary of the\r\n    Royal Asiatic Society, and Sir Henry Gordon--General Charles\r\n    Gordon's brother--who soon afterwards died, remaining my strong\r\n    friend, as did these others.\r\n\r\n    'James wrote to Lady Dilke, July 26th:\r\n\r\n    '\"No one but your husband could have polled so many Gladstonian\r\n    votes. London is dead against the Prime Minister.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain wrote of his deep regret and sympathy that the one\r\nMinisterialist seat which he had earnestly hoped would be kept should\r\nhave gone. He pointed out that the falling off in this case was less\r\nthan in other London polls; but the reactionary period would continue\r\nwhile Mr. Gladstone was in politics. If he retired, Mr. Chamberlain\r\nthought the party would recover in a year or two.\r\n\r\nThere is a warm letter from Mr. Joseph Cowen of Newcastle, who wrote:\r\n\r\n    'Chelsea has been going Tory for some time past, and only you would\r\n    have kept it Liberal at the last election.... If you had not been\r\n    one of the bravest men that ever lived, you would have been driven\r\n    away long ago. I admire your courage and sincerely sympathize with\r\n    your misfortunes.... I always believed you would achieve the highest\r\n    position in English statesmanship, and I don't despair of your doing\r\n    so still.'\r\n\r\nFor a final word in this chapter of discouragement may be given a letter\r\nfrom Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, who wrote from a detached position, having\r\nbeen prevented by illness from standing both in 1885 and 1886:\r\n\r\n    'What a delightful leader of a party is the G.O.M.! It is an\r\n    interesting subject of speculation, though, thank God, it is one of\r\n    speculation only, what might happen to this country if, like the old\r\n    Red Indian in Hawthorne's novel, he lived to be 300 years old.... My\r\n    own opinions about setting up a Parliament in Dublin are quite\r\n    unchanged, but I look on the G.O.M. as the great obstacle to any\r\n    satisfactory settlement. I see nothing but pandemonium ahead of us.'\r\n\r\nThe question was whether the future Assembly in Dublin was to be called\r\na 'Legislature' or a 'Parliament.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles, as a Gladstonian Liberal politician, was involved in the\r\nmisfortune of his party. But in the first weeks of July he hoped that\r\njustice in the court of law might soon relieve his personal misfortunes.\r\nThat anticipation was rudely falsified. Within a fortnight after he had\r\nlost the seat which had been won and held by him triumphantly in four\r\nGeneral Elections, the second trial of his case was over, and had\r\nfollowed the course which has been already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nLADY DILKE--76, SLOANE STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's marriage in 1885 extended rather than modified his\r\nsphere of work. Lady Dilke, the Emilia Strong who was studying drawing\r\nin 1859 at South Kensington, [Footnote: See Chapter 11. (Vol. 1., p.\r\n17).] had submitted herself in these long intervening years to such\r\nscholarly training and discipline as gave her weight and authority on\r\nthe subjects which she handled.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant girl's desire to take all knowledge for her kingdom had\r\nbeen intensified by her marriage at twenty-one to the scholar more than\r\ntwice her age. In the words of Sir Charles's Memoir: 'She widened her\r\nconception of art by the teaching of the philosopher and by the study of\r\nthe literatures to which the schooling of Mark Pattison admitted her.\r\nShe saw, too, men and things, travelled largely with him, became\r\nmistress of many tongues, and gained above all a breadth of desire for\r\nhuman knowledge, destined only to grow with the advance of years.'\r\n[Footnote: _The Book of the Spiritual Life_, by the late Lady Dilke,\r\nwith a Memoir of the Author by Sir Charles W. Dilke, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five years of age she was contributing philosophical articles\r\nto the _Westminster Review_, and for years she wrote the review of\r\nforeign politics for the _Annual Register_. Later she furnished art\r\ncriticisms to the _Portfolio_, the _Saturday Review_, and the _Academy_,\r\nof which last she was art editor. It was as an art critic that she had\r\ncome to be known, and to this work she brought a remarkable equipment;\r\nfor to her technical knowledge and artist's training was added a deep\r\nstudy of the tendencies of history and of human thought. _Art in the\r\nModern State_, in which she wrote of the art of the 'Grand Siècle' in\r\nits bearing on modern political and social organizations, has been\r\nquoted as the book most characteristic of the philosophical tendency of\r\nher writing, but this did not appear till 1888. The _Renaissance of Art\r\nin France_, which had been published in 1879, was illustrated by\r\ndrawings from her own pencil, and in 1884 had appeared _Claude Lorrain_,\r\nwritten by herself in the pure and graceful French of which she was\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nShe had been a pupil of Mulready, whose portrait still decorates the\r\nmantelpiece of her Pyrford home, and in the early South Kensington days\r\nhad come much under the influence of Watts and Ruskin. There were\r\nnumbered among her friends many who had achieved distinction in the art,\r\nliterature, or politics of Europe. Her letters on art to Eugène Müntz,\r\npreserved in the Manuscript Department of the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\ncommemorate the friendship and assistance given to her by the author of\r\nthe _History of the Italian Renaissance_, whose admiration for her work\r\nmade him persuade her to undertake her _Claude_. It was Taine who bore\r\nwitness to her 'veritable erudition on the fine arts of the\r\nRenaissance,' when in 1871, lecturing in Oxford, he used to visit Mark\r\nPattison and his young wife at Lincoln College, and described the 'toute\r\njeune femme, charmante, gracieuse, à visage frais et presque mutin, dans\r\nle plus joli nid de vieille architecture, avec lierre et grands arbres.'\r\n[Footnote: 'The Art Work of Lady Dilke,' _Quarterly Review_, October,\r\n1906.] It was Renan, a friend of later years, whom as yet she did not\r\nknow, who 'presented' her _Renaissance_ to the Académie des Inscriptions\r\net Belles-Lettres.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to her activities, as intense. Public service\r\nwas to her a duty of citizenship, and her keen sympathy with suffering\r\nhad inspired her to such study of economic and industrial questions\r\nthat, in her effort for the development of organization among women\r\nworkers, she was for years 'the practical director of a considerable\r\nsocial movement.' Her four volumes on Art in France in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury, which occupied her from this time onwards, were not more\r\nabsorbing to her than was the growth of the Women's Trade Union League.\r\n\r\nShe had concentrated her powers on a special period of French art, just\r\nas she concentrated them on a certain phase of industrial development;\r\nbut her reverence for and pursuit of all learning persisted, and, in the\r\nwords of the Memoir written by Sir Charles, 'she was master enough of\r\nhuman knowledge in its principal branches to know the relation of almost\r\nevery part of it to every other.' [Footnote: _Book of the Spiritual\r\nLife,_ Memoir, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe intense mental training of the years of her first marriage had given\r\nher a grasp of essential facts and a breadth of outlook most unusual in\r\nwomen, and rare among men. She always correlated her own special work to\r\nthat of the larger world. She found in the Women's Protective and\r\nProvident Union a little close corporation, full of sex antagonism and\r\nopposition to legislative protection, but under her sway these\r\nlimitations gradually disappeared, and the Women's Trade Union movement\r\nbecame an integral part of industrial progress. It is difficult to\r\nrealize now the breadth of vision which was then required to see that\r\nthe industrial interests of the sexes are identical, and that protective\r\nlegislation does not hamper, but emancipates. It was this attitude which\r\nbrought to her in this field of work the friendship and support of all\r\nthat was best in the Labour world of her day henceforth to the end.\r\n\r\n'It is delightful to talk to Mrs. Mark Pattison,' said Sir Charles Dilke\r\nyears before to Sir Henry James. 'She says such wonderful things.' She\r\nhad the rare power of revealing to others by a few words things in their\r\ntrue values, and those who came within the sphere of her influence try\r\nstill to recover the attitude of mind which she inspired, to remember\r\nhow she would have looked at the fresh problems which confront them, and\r\nto view them in relation to all work and life.\r\n\r\nIt was this knowledge and breadth of view which told. A perfect speaker,\r\nwith tremendous force of personality, charm of manner, beauty of voice,\r\nand command of emotional oratory, her power was greatest when she\r\npreferred to these methods the force of a reasoned appeal. Conviction\r\nwaited on these appeals, and in early days, at a public meeting, a group\r\nof youthful cynics, 'out' for entertainment, dispersed with the comment:\r\n'That was wonderful--you couldn't heckle a woman like that.'\r\n\r\nHer serious work never detracted from her social charm, which was\r\ninfluenced by her love and study of eighteenth century French art. Her\r\nwit, gaiety, and the sensitive fancy which manifested itself in her\r\nstories, [Footnote: _The Shrine of Love, and Other Stories_; and _The\r\nShrine of Death, and Other Stories_.] made up this charm, which was\r\nreflected in the distinction and finish of her appearance. Some touches\r\nseemed subtly to differentiate her dress from the prevailing fashion,\r\nand to make it the expression of a personality which belonged to a\r\ncentury more dignified, more leisured, and less superficial, than our\r\nown. [Footnote: _Book of the Spiritual Life,_ p. 120.] Her dress\r\nrecalled the canvases of Boucher, Van Loo, and Watteau, which she loved.\r\n\r\nShe played as she worked, with all her heart, delivering herself\r\ncompletely to the enjoyment of the moment. 'Vous devez bien vous amuser,\r\nMonsieur, tous les jours chez vous,' said a Frenchwoman to Sir Charles\r\none night at a dinner in Paris. [Footnote: _Book of the Spiritual Life,_\r\nMemoir, p. 96.] In this power of complete relaxation their natures\r\ncoincided. Her gaiety matched Sir Charles's own. This perhaps was the\r\nleast of the bonds between them. The same high courage, the same\r\ncapacity for tireless work, the same sense of public duty, characterized\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's real home was the home of all his life, of his father and\r\ngrandfather--No. 76, Sloane Street. Pyrford and Dockett were, like La\r\nSainte Campagne at Toulon, mainly places for rest and play. This home\r\nwas a house of treasures--of many things precious in themselves, and\r\nmore that were precious to the owners from memory and association.\r\nThrough successive generations one member of the family after another\r\nhad added to the collection. Many had been accumulated by the last\r\nowner, who slept always in the room that had been his nursery. He\r\nbelieved he would die, and desired to die, in the house where he was\r\nborn. The desire was accomplished, for he died there, on January 26th,\r\n1911, a few months before the long lease expired.\r\n\r\nPartly from its dull rich colouring of deep blues and reds and greens,\r\nits old carpets and tapestries, partly from the pictures that crowded\r\nits walls, the interior had the air rather of a family country-house\r\nthan of a London dwelling in a busy street.\r\n\r\nPictures, lining the walls from top to bottom of the staircase,\r\nrepresented a medley of date and association. Byng's Fleet at Naples on\r\nAugust 1st, 1718, with Sir Thomas Dilkes second in command, hung next to\r\na view of the Château de la Garde, near Toulon. This picturesque ruin\r\nrose clear in the view from Sir Charles's house at Cap Brun, 'La Sainte\r\nCampagne,' and figures as an illustration in one of Lady Dilke's\r\nstories; 'Reeds and Umbrella Pines' at Carqueiranne, by Pownoll\r\nWilliams, kept another memory of Provence. Next to a painting, by Horace\r\nVernet, of a scene on the Mediterranean coast, little Anne Fisher, born\r\n1588, exhibited herself in hooped and embroidered petticoat, quaint cap\r\nand costly laces, a person of great dignity at six years old. She was to\r\nbe Lady Dilke of Maxstoke Castle and a shrewd termagant, mother of two\r\nsons who sided, one with the Commonwealth, the other with the King. The\r\nRoyalist Sir Peter Wentworth was a great friend of Milton, with whom he\r\ncame in contact on the Committee of State when Milton was Secretary for\r\nthe Council of Foreign Tongues. But Cromwell turned him off the Council,\r\nand he was arrested and brought to London for abetting his Warwickshire\r\ntenantry in refusal to pay the Protector's war-taxes. Her Puritan son,\r\nFisher Dilke, followed, with a sour-faced Puritan divine, and then came\r\na group of water-colours by Thomas Hood, the author of 'The Song of the\r\nShirt,' and an intimate friend of the Dilkes.\r\n\r\nOne of the ancestors, an earlier Peter Wentworth, son of Sir Nicholas\r\nWentworth (who was Chief Porter of Calais, and knighted by Henry VIII.\r\nat the siege of Boulogne), bore the distinction of having been three\r\ntimes sent to the Tower. The first was for a memorable speech on behalf\r\nof the liberties of the House of Commons, in 1575. Imprisonment does not\r\nseem to have taught him caution, for he was last imprisoned in 1593,\r\nbecause he had 'offended Her Majesty,' and a prisoner he remained till\r\nhis death in 1596, occupying the period by writing a _Pithie Exhortation\r\nto Her Majesty for Establishing her Successor to the Crowne_.\r\n\r\nEngravings of Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir Harry Vane,\r\nFulk Greville, Lord Burleigh, William Warham (the friend of Erasmus,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and Chancellor), Queen Katharine Parr, Robert\r\nDevereux (Earl of Essex), who all came into the Dilke pedigree, hung on\r\nthe walls. But the most interesting portrait might have been that of Sir\r\nCharles himself in fancy dress, the Sir Charles of the early eighties\r\nbefore trouble had lined his face or silvered his hair. This was the\r\npainting of Sir Thomas, afterwards Lord Wentworth, who died in 1551 and\r\nlies in Westminster Abbey. The reversion to type was so striking that\r\nguests would often ask to see again 'the best portrait of Sir Charles.'\r\n[Footnote: This first Baron Wentworth had been knighted for his bravery\r\nin the taking of Braye and Montdidier in the expedition to France of\r\n1523, and in 1529 was summoned to Parliament under the title of Lord\r\nWentworth of Nettlestead. He attended Henry VIII. in his interview with\r\nthe French King at Calais, and under Edward VI. was Lord Chamberlain of\r\nthe Household and a member of the Privy Council.]\r\n\r\nAmong more recent portraits and drawings were a group of trophies,\r\nillustrating Sir Charles's experiences in the Franco-German War. Of\r\nthree passes, the first was carried when he was with the Crown Prince\r\nFrederick and the Knights of St. John; the other two showed the change\r\nin his sympathies from Germany to France--one from the Commune, the\r\nother from the national headquarters at Versailles. Here lay a bullet\r\nwhich struck the wall beside him at Clamart Railway Station, just\r\nmissing him; pens taken from the table of the Procureur Impérial at\r\nWissembourg when the first French town was entered by the Germans; and a\r\ntrophy of his birthday in 1871, a bit of the Napoleonic Eagle from the\r\nGuard-room at the Tuileries, smashed by the crowd on that day, September\r\n4th, when the Third Republic was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen followed old photographs of members of Parliament and Cabinet\r\nMinisters; pictures of Maxstoke Castle, where the elder branch of the\r\nDilkes had its home; etchings by Rajon; framed numbers of _Le Vengeur_,\r\nprinted after the entry of the Versailles army into Paris during the\r\n'semaine sang-lante'; addresses, including some in Greek, presented to\r\nSir Charles on various occasions. In the double dining-room a famous\r\nportrait of Gambetta--the only portrait taken from life--hung over one\r\nmantelpiece. A favourite citation might have been upon the lips: 'La\r\nFrance était à genoux. Je lui ai dit, \"Lève-toi\".' In 1875 Sir Charles\r\nasked Professor Legros to go to Paris and paint Gambetta, who never sat\r\nto any other artist. This portrait hangs now in the Luxembourg, and will\r\nultimately be transferred to the Louvre, its destination by Sir\r\nCharles's bequest. The only other portrait of Gambetta is that by\r\nBonnat, painted after death. It was the property of Dilke's friend M.\r\nJoseph Reinach, and the two had agreed to bequeath these treasured\r\npossessions to the Louvre. But the Legros was the more authentic. M.\r\nBonnat said to Sir Charles: 'Mine is black and white; I never saw him.\r\nYours is red as a lobster. Mais il paraît qu'il était rouge comme un\r\nhomard.' Sir Charles himself wrote: 'It is Gambetta as he lives and\r\nmoves and has his being. What more can I ask for or expect?' He always\r\npredicted that its painter, whose merit had never in his opinion been\r\nadequately recognized, would after death come to his due place.\r\n\r\nThe rooms had been lined with the grandfather's books, but soon after he\r\ncame into possession Sir Charles disposed of them. He had a strong\r\nbelief in keeping round him only the necessary tools for his work, and a\r\nlarge library was an encumbrance to him. But sentiment was strong, and\r\nfor some time they remained, till a comment of George Odger's sealed\r\ntheir fate. Looking round the shelves, he remarked with wonderment on\r\nthe number of the books and the wisdom of the friend who had read them\r\nall. Sir Charles, conscious that he had not done so, and that he never\r\nshould lead the life of a purely literary man, gave away the more\r\nvaluable, and sold the rest of the collection. Lord Carlingford profited\r\nby the Junius papers; Mr. John Murray by the Pope manuscripts; the\r\nBritish Museum by the Caryll papers; and pictures took the place of\r\nshelves. [Footnote: See Chapter XI. (Vol. I., pp. 161, 162).]\r\n\r\nA number of fine old prints after Raphael were there, and also a\r\nphotograph of the head of Fortune in Burne-Jones's 'Wheel.' Sir Charles\r\nhad commissioned Burne-Jones to paint a head of Fortune, and the\r\ncorrespondence on the subject was sufficiently complete to suggest that\r\nthe commission had been executed, though as a fact it was never carried\r\nout. Sir Charles, who knew something of the difficulty of tracing and\r\nattributing pictures, used to declare laughingly that the correspondence\r\nmight go far to mislead some critic of the future into search after a\r\nnon-existent original. Anyway, the beautiful head with its closed eyes\r\nhung there always, presiding over the varying fortunes of the last\r\ntenants of the house.\r\n\r\nThe far dining-room opened with French windows on a paved terrace, which\r\nled by steps to a little garden and to the stables beyond. This terrace\r\nwas the scene of the morning fencing, when the clashing of foils and Sir\r\nCharles's shouts of laughter resounded to the neighbouring gardens. Lord\r\nHarcourt recalls the parties in the eighties, as one of the\r\ncharacteristic features of life at 76, Sloane Street. Lord Desborough,\r\nthen Mr. W. Grenfell, a first-rate fencer, came frequently, and he\r\nchronicles the 'deadly riposte' of Sir Julian Pauncefote, a regular\r\nattendant when he was in town. Mr. R. C. Lehmann, best known as oarsman\r\nand boxer, but a fencer as well, came whenever he could. A great St.\r\nBernard, lying waiting for him in the entrance hall, announced his\r\nmaster's presence.\r\n\r\nBaron d'Estournelles de Constant, of the French Embassy, was one of the\r\nmost regular attendants. When M. d'Estournelles left London it was to go\r\nto Tunis; and further reference in one of Sir Charles's letters betrays\r\nthe pride with which he learnt that this frequenter of his school had\r\ndone it credit by 'pinking his man' in a duel. M. Joseph Reinach came to\r\nfence whenever he was in London; so did Italian masters--for example,\r\nthe Marchese Fabrizio Panluoci de' Calboli, 'who wants to set up here.'\r\n\r\nThe _maitre d'armes_ was senior master at the London Fencing Club, and\r\nmany young fencers joined these parties to gain experience. Sir Charles\r\nwas one of the first Englishmen to use the épée; he fenced always when\r\nin Paris, as in London, and any famous French fencer who visited this\r\ncountry received as a matter of course an invitation to the morning\r\nmeetings at No. 76. [Footnote: Sir Charles fenced whenever he was\r\nabroad, if he could get an opponent. There is a note of 1881: 'August\r\n29th-September 3rd, fenced with de Clairval at La Bourboule.' As late as\r\n1907 he was fencing at Hyères with a master who came over from Toulon on\r\ncertain days in the week. Also at the end of 1881 he 'started a local\r\nfencing club in my own street, and trained some good fencers there, and\r\nused to get away to fence there whenever I could find time in the\r\nevening hours.' He took part in a competition at this club, and 'won the\r\nprize for rapier fencing, being beaten, of course, for foil fencing.']\r\nSir Theodoré Cook, now editor of the _Field_, an antagonist of a later\r\ndate, and captain of the first international fencing team of 1903,\r\nspeaks of the considerable reputation of Sir Charles as a fencer,\r\n'taking the same place in a quiet way as that Lord Howard de Walden\r\ntakes towards the public now' (1913).\r\n\r\nIt was the 'unconventional style and the boyish enjoyment of his\r\npastime'--to use Lord Desborough's words--which were characteristic of\r\nSir Charles. His mischievous attempts to distract his adversary's\r\nattention, his sudden drops to the ground and bewildering recoveries,\r\nhis delight at the success of his feints, and contagious merriment, must\r\nhave gained the sympathy of even the most formal fencer. Many stories of\r\nthese bouts are told. One is that, having driven an antagonist from the\r\nterrace into the Garden Room, into which he was followed by his\r\nfavourite cat, Sir Charles caught up and threw the protesting animal at\r\nhis opponent, and dealt his final blow at a foe embarrassed by the\r\ndouble onslaught. Those, however, who know his respect for the dignity\r\nof cats will always regard the story as apocryphal.\r\n\r\nHe delighted in having near him the pictures of his friends, and there\r\nwere many on the next landing, in the vestibule and the Blue Room to\r\nwhich it led. Mr. Chamberlain, keen-eyed and alert, looked out from\r\nFrank Holl's canvas. Fawcett, [Footnote: Now in the National Portrait\r\nGallery, as also Holl's 'Chamberlain,' by Sir Charles's bequest.]\r\npainted by Ford Madox Brown in 1871, recalled an earlier friendship, as\r\ndid the portrait of John Stuart Mill, who, never having sat to any\r\npainter, just before his death allowed Watts to paint this for Sir\r\nCharles. The picture came home on the day Mill died, and is the\r\noriginal. It was left by will to the Westminster Town Hall. The picture\r\nin the National Portrait Gallery is a replica, painted by Sir Charles's\r\nleave. By Watts was also a beautiful portrait of Sir Charles himself,\r\nthe pendant to another which has gone. He and his first wife were\r\npainted for each other, but the portrait of her seemed to him so\r\ninadequately to render the 'real charm' of the dead woman that he\r\ndestroyed it. The illustrations of this book contain some reproductions\r\nof pictures mentioned here.\r\n\r\nReminiscent of earlier family friendships were the Keats relics here and\r\nin Sir Charles's own study. Many of these had been bought by old Mr.\r\nDilke from Keats's love, Fanny Brawne, to save them from the indignity\r\nof an auction.\r\n\r\nIn the Blue Room also hung some extraordinarily fine pictures by Blake,\r\nwho was the friend of Sir Charles's grandfather--among them 'The\r\nCrucifixion,' 'The Blasphemer,' and 'The Devil,' [Footnote: 'I gave four\r\nof my Blakes to the South Kensington Museum in 1884.'] The best loved\r\nboth by the grandfather and by Sir Charles was the beautiful 'Queen\r\nCatherine's Dream.' A precious copy of _The Songs of Innocence_,\r\nhand-painted by Blake and his wife, completed the collection. There were\r\nseveral reliefs by Dalou in the house, the finest let in over the\r\nmantelpiece of the Blue Room, a copy of Flaxman's Mercury and Pandora.\r\nThey were executed for Sir Charles when the sculptor was in London in\r\ngreat distress after the Commune, before the amnesty which retrieved his\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nHere also were reminiscences of Provence. One side of the wall was\r\nlargely covered by a picture of Fréjus by Wislin, painted in the days\r\nwhen St. Raphael and Valescure did not exist, and when the old town rose\r\nclear from the low ground as Rome rises from the Campagna, the beautiful\r\nRoquebrune, a spur of Sir Charles's beloved Mountains of the Moors,\r\nbehind it. Sèvres china, vases, bronzes, filled the window ledges,\r\npresents to the first Baronet from the Emperor of Austria, Napoleon\r\nIII., the Crown Prince of Prussia (afterwards the Emperor Frederick),\r\nand other royal persons and Governments, with whom his Exhibition work\r\nbrought him into touch.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Horace Walpole's collection at Strawberry Hill was\r\nsold, Sir Charles's grandfather had stayed at Twickenham, and had\r\nbrought away many purchases, which peopled the Red and Green\r\nDrawing-rooms on the next landing. There was a little group of\r\nminiatures in which the 'Beautiful Gunnings' and a charming 'Miss\r\nTemple' figured; in another group, miniatures of Addison, of Mme. Le\r\nBrun, of Molière, came from Lady Morgan, whose pen of bog-oak and gold,\r\na gift to her from the Irish people, hung in Sir Charles's own study.\r\nThe best of the miniatures were those by Peter Oliver, and portrayed\r\nFrederick of Bohemia, Elector Palatine, and his wife Elizabeth, Princess\r\nRoyal of England, afterwards married to Lord Craven; while the finest of\r\nall was 'a son of Sir Kenelm Digby, 1632.' It was one of 'several\r\nothers' which Walpole 'purchased at a great price,' a purchase which was\r\nthus chronicled 'by Mason (Junius) in a letter to Walpole: 'I\r\ncongratulate you on the new miniatures, though I know one day they will\r\nbecome Court property and dangle under the crimson-coloured shop-glasses\r\nof our gracious Queen Charlotte.' The set were all brought together for\r\nthe first time since 1842 at the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn these two drawing-rooms, among the medley of enamelled and inlaid\r\ntables, royal gifts and collectors' purchases, pictures by Cranach,\r\nMabuse, Van Goyen, Mignard, and many more, some special objects stood\r\nout. These were a beautiful Madonna by Memling, on a circular panel,\r\nfrom Lord Northwick's collection; the Strawberry Hill marble version of\r\nthe famous Bargello relief by Donatello, of the head of the infant St.\r\nJohn the Baptist; and a portrait ascribed to Cornelius Jansen, which,\r\nowing to the fleurs-de-lis on the chair, passed by the name of 'the\r\nDuchess,' a portly lady of some dignity, with beautiful white hands and\r\ntapering fingers. Lady Dilke's researches, however, placed the lady as\r\nAnne Dujardin, an innkeeper of Lyons. The painter, young Karl Dujardin,\r\nunable to pay his reckoning, had settled it by marrying his hostess and\r\ntaking her to Amsterdam, and the fleurs-de-lis on the chair explained\r\nthat the lady was of French extraction. A Flemish head of Margaret of\r\nAustria, Regent of the Netherlands, had come from the Gwydyr Collection.\r\nShe was much exhibited, but her main interest was due to Sir Charles's\r\nintense admiration for the governing capacity and the overshadowed life\r\nof the woman. He made two pilgrimages to the church at Brou, near\r\nBourg-en-Bresse, where her sculptured face, closely resembling that of\r\nthe portrait, looks out from tomb and windows, as she lies side by side\r\nwith Philibert le Beau, the husband of her love and of her youth, in the\r\nmagnificent shrine she built for him.\r\n\r\nTapestry hangings divided the rooms from each other, and in many cases\r\nonly heavy curtains divided them from the stairs.\r\n\r\nAbove these rooms, Sir Charles's little study, occupied all day by his\r\nsecretary or himself, was lined with books of reference and piles of\r\ndespatch-boxes, while every spare foot on the wall held relics of the\r\npast. There was the Herkomer portrait of his second wife, there also a\r\ncopy of a favourite picture, Bellini's Doge Leonardo Loredano; the\r\nportrait of Keats, the only one Severn did from the life--now on loan at\r\nthe National Portrait Gallery--old political cartoons of Chelsea days,\r\nportraits and prints of John Wilkes, and a head of Mazzini. Felix\r\nMoscheles (the nephew of Mendelssohn and baby of the Cradle Song)\r\npainted Mazzini. Concerning its subject the Memoir notes: 'In the course\r\nof 1872 I lost a good friend in Mazzini, whose enthusiasms, Italian and\r\nreligious, I at that time scarcely shared, but whose conversation and\r\nclose friendship I deeply valued.... The modernness of the Universal\r\nCigarette Smoking Craze may be judged by the fact that Mazzini was the\r\nfirst man I ever knew who was constantly smoking cigarettes.'\r\n\r\nThe rest was a medley impossible to catalogue: portraits of Charles\r\nLamb, who had been the grandfather's friend; a scarce proclamation by\r\nthe Pretender; medals and other 'Caryll' relics; rapiers, pistols which\r\nhad travelled with Sir Charles through America; a section of the Trinity\r\nHall boat which was head of the river in 1862 and 1864; seven cups,\r\ntrophies of rowing, walking, fencing, and shooting matches, with shots\r\ndug up on his Toulon estate which were mementoes of the British\r\nblockades of the town. Apart from works of reference, a special case was\r\ngiven to autographed books from Hood, Rogers the poet, Gambetta,\r\nLaveleye, Louis Blanc, Castelar, Cardinal Manning, Queen Victoria, and\r\nmany more. In this collection figured all Sir Charles's college prizes,\r\ncarefully preserved; the family Bible of Lord Leicester, uncle to Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney, with Dilke family entries; and a little volume in which\r\nhis second wife had written for him some of the most beautiful passages\r\nfrom 'Queens' Gardens' in _Sesame and Lilies_; it was bound in white\r\nvellum and 'blessed by Ruskin.' Here, too, were many Keats letters and\r\nbooks afterwards left by will to Hampstead.\r\n\r\nA hoard of treasures filled a little book-room above--his mother's\r\nsketches, drawings of his first wife driving her ponies in Sloane\r\nStreet, photographs and trinkets of hers, old family caricatures, and\r\nalso some original sketches by Leech. In the room next to it, occupied\r\nby his grandmother till her death in 1882, was a John Collier of the\r\nfirst Lady Dilke.\r\n\r\nWhen the grandmother's sitting-room was used later by Sir Charles's\r\nsecond wife, its main features were a small reference library of French\r\nart and a collection of books on Labour. Before the fireplace, on the\r\nwriting-table as it was in 1885, were bowls of French porcelain filled\r\nonce a week with fresh flowers from the Toulon garden--paper white\r\nnarcissus and purple anemones or big violets of Provençal growth.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's bedroom above was the old nursery, connected with his\r\nmother's room, in which he was born, and out of which opened a little\r\nroom where as a child he slept. His memories of that room were the\r\nterrors of a nervous boy, lying alone in the dark, creeping downstairs\r\nto sit--a tiny white-robed figure--as near as possible to the\r\ndrawing-room door, to get comfort from the hum of talk or thunder of the\r\nfour-handed piano pieces of the period.\r\n\r\nHis own room for many years was full of drawings by his second wife--her\r\nstudies under Mulready, her drawings for her _Renaissance_, and other\r\npen-and-ink sketches by her hand, as well as two miniatures of her by\r\nPollet. Some of Frank Dicey's Thames water-colours, one showing Sir\r\nCharles's river house at Dockett Eddy, and sketches from his own pen or\r\nbrush made in his Russian, American, and world-wide wanderings, were\r\nhere also. In a tiny glazed bookcase by the fire were some 'favourite\r\nbooks,' a volume or two of Kipling, two volumes of Anatole France, next\r\nto a cookery book of 1600, Renan's _Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse_,\r\nand a volume of Aubanel. The place of honour was given to a deeply\r\nscored copy of Jeremy Taylor's _Golden Grove_.\r\n\r\nBeside his great-uncle's Peninsular medal and clasps hung one of Roty's\r\nmedals, a present from the artist. There were several of Roty's\r\nbeautiful medallions in the house, the finest one of Sir Charles\r\nhimself, explained by the legend on the back as 'done for his wife.' She\r\nhad it made, and it was always with her.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many of W. E. F. Britten's pictures, painted for Sir\r\nCharles; the finest was that of 'St. Francis preaching to the Birds,' a\r\nthing of delicate colour and taste, which fitted with his love of the\r\nUmbrian Holy Land and went later to the country cottage at Pyrford.\r\nThere was more force in a large crayon drawing of the Earl of\r\nSouthampton in the Tower: 'his cat had just arrived down the chimney,\r\nprobably saving his master's reason by relief of the intolerable tension\r\nof lonely confinement.'\r\n\r\nThe painted cats, or Miss Chaplin's modelled pussies, of which there\r\nwere many, were seldom without some magnificent living representative at\r\n76, Sloane Street. Zulu, an enormous dark long-haired cat, was very\r\npopular; but the last of the 'Head Cats,' Calino, was so engaging that,\r\nat his death about 1908, Sir Charles decided that he should never be\r\nreplaced. The sway of these cats was despotic, but there were occasions\r\non which their own territory was too limited for them, and messages\r\nwould come from far down the street demanding the removal of the\r\nreigning favourite from some article of furniture where it had ensconced\r\nitself with such majesty that a show of violence was out of the\r\nquestion. Among his precious books was a cat story--privately printed\r\nand bound--which his second wife had gradually evolved among the\r\nwonderful essays in story-telling with which, when he was jaded, she\r\ndiverted him. This held so large a share in his affection that it nearly\r\ndisplaced his little French copy of the _Contes de Perrault_, containing\r\nthe adventures of the Marquis of Carabas and Puss in Boots. At the\r\nwinter cottage at Pyrford, among the pines, was a cattery, where Persian\r\ntailless cats, some ginger and some white, were bred. A list of names\r\nwas kept ready for them, and Babettes, Papillons, Pierrots and\r\nPierrettes, Mistigrises and Beelzebubs, were distributed to friends and\r\nacquaintances. Among the treasured pathetic scraps kept in his father's\r\ndesk, his executors found a pencil drawing by his wife, the closed\r\nwindow of a silent house, into which the perfectly sketched figure of a\r\nlittle kitten was trying to enter.\r\n\r\nIn the gracious setting of this house the pervading atmosphere was that\r\nof work. The three generations of Dilkes whom it had sheltered had each\r\nfound the sphere for which he was best fitted, and pursued it\r\ntirelessly. The grandfather, beloved old scholar and critic; the father,\r\nindefatigable organizer of international exhibitions, horticulturist,\r\nnewspaper proprietor, member of Parliament--both passed on the\r\ntraditions of strenuous labour to the great Parliamentarian who was now\r\nthe occupant of the house. He had absorbed those traditions and far\r\noutvied his predecessors, working day and night, bringing down from his\r\nbedroom almost illegible memoranda to be deciphered by his secretary in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880 to 1885 his accession to public office had intensified the\r\nwork. Messengers with official boxes waited in the hall; callers on\r\npolitical or electoral business, to be interviewed by him or his\r\nsecretaries, filled the Blue and Red Rooms. After the morning's fencing\r\nhe passed rapidly from letters to interviews till the Office or the\r\nHouse of Commons claimed him, and his faithful coachman, Charles Grant,\r\nwho when he died in 1901 had served his master for thirty years, waited\r\nfor him at the door. Yet with all this the house continued, as in his\r\nfather's day, to be noted for its hospitality, and the lists of guests\r\nin the tattered diaries bear witness to the enormous and varied circle\r\nof Sir Charles's friends. Here met foreign diplomatists and artists,\r\nEnglish statesmen, and men of letters. Even Cardinal Manning broke his\r\nrule against dining out, as 'yours is a Cabinet dinner,' to come to 76,\r\nSloane Street; but as he met M. de Franqueville, Baron Ferdinand de\r\nRothschild, and the friend whom the Cardinal designated to be his\r\nbiographer, the future author of _France_, J. E. C. Bodley, there must\r\nhave been talk of other subjects than 'Housing of the Poor.' Indeed,\r\nabsence of 'shop' seems to have been one of the charms of these dinners,\r\nand Mr. G. W. Osborn, the Chairman of the Chelsea Liberal Association,\r\nrecords that, even when the local leaders met there, some outside\r\nelement was always introduced which made the talk general.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Sir Charles notes: 'July 9th, 1884. On this day\r\nCardinal Manning dined with me, and gave me, in return for a Spanish\r\ncrucifix with which I had presented him, a miniature of \"our patron, St.\r\nCharles,\"' which now, he adds, '(1891 and 1903) hangs in my bedroom.\r\nManning and H. von Bismarck met at my table--I think for the first\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\nHis first invitation to Mr. Gladstone, of October 26th, 1882, was to\r\nmeet the Duc de Broglie: 'the leader of the Conservative party in France\r\nis at this moment a sufficiently interesting figure for me to think you\r\nmay like to come to meet him, if you are not engaged.'\r\n\r\nSuch social life, like the morning's rapid turn with the foils or the\r\nSunday afternoon on the river, helped to save him from breakdown under a\r\nstrain of work persistently intense. Another quality which saved him was\r\nhis power of turning at once and completely from one occupation to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nA friend thus describes him as he appeared in 1885: 'There was in him a\r\nquality of boyishness I have never seen in any other man, coupled with\r\ndeep gravity and seriousness, and the transition from one mood to the\r\nother came with lightning rapidity. Appeal to him on some question of\r\nhigh politics, even at a moment of the most joyous relaxation, and his\r\nface gravened, his bearing changed; he pulled himself together with a\r\ntrick of manner habitual to the end, and the 'boy' became the statesman\r\nbefore it seemed the last echoes of his laughter had died away. We all\r\nprophesied for him accession to the highest offices of the State; for\r\nthough so far the offices which he had held had been of but minor rank,\r\nyet he had magnified these offices till they became of the first\r\nimportance, and his knowledge and authority were as great as were his\r\ncharm and his power of gathering round him supporters and friends. He\r\nspoke with the authority of one who knows his value to the nation which\r\nhe serves.'\r\n\r\nSo with Sir Charles's second marriage the house entered on its last\r\nphase, and the dark days which followed were lightened for its two\r\noccupants by mutual confidence and the support of an abiding love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stay at Royat, whither doctor's orders had sent Lady\r\nDilke, Sir Charles returned with her, in September, 1886, to the little\r\nriverside cottage at Dockett. Thence, as autumn drew on, they moved to\r\nthe other cottage that had been built among the pines on the sandy ridge\r\nnear Woking.\r\n\r\nNo longer having a seat in the House of Commons, Sir Charles again\r\nresumed the pen, by which he had first gained distinction.\r\n\r\nIn the English home politics of 1887, the Irish Question predominated as\r\nit had never done before: Home Rule was being thrashed out on every\r\nplatform. This was a matter on which Sir Charles, to use his own words,\r\n'never clearly saw his way'; it was one that he naturally avoided, for\r\nit had separated him from his most intimate political associate, and he\r\nturned to the field of foreign affairs which had continuously occupied\r\nhim during his tenure of office, and which, save during the episode of\r\nthe franchise negotiations, had been his central concern.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had the notion of entering into the business of\r\nnewspaper management. His object was not to secure literary reputation,\r\nbut to direct and influence public opinion. Early in 1887 he wrote to\r\nhis friend Mr. Thursfield of the _Times_:\r\n\r\n    'What I want is work on foreign affairs, or rather external affairs,\r\n    or foreign and colonial. I would prefer not to write, but to suggest\r\n    and supervise foreign news, and to work up the subjects of the\r\n    leaders which others would write. If I wrote, I think I should write\r\n    less well than other people, because I always write as I speak, and\r\n    not as people are taught to write.'\r\n\r\nNothing came of this idea; but it was a proposal remarkable in its\r\nself-depreciation, because it was made when work from his pen was\r\nalready having a conspicuous success. Beginning in January, 1887, a\r\nseries of six articles dealing with the existing position of the six\r\nGreat Powers appeared in the _Fortnightly Review_, anonymously, but the\r\nauthor was at once identified. They sent the _Review_ into repeated\r\neditions. They appeared translated into French in the _Nouvelle Revue_,\r\nand were discussed all over Europe. Later in the summer they were\r\npublished in book form, and called in English _The Present Position of\r\nEuropean Politics_ and in French _L'Europe en 1887_.\r\n\r\nIn the author's own words, the articles dealt with 'facts and\r\ntendencies'; and though he would have been the last to hold himself a\r\nprophet, saying that in the nature of things 'two years meant for ever\r\nin politics,' much that he wrote is still of interest, and the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Erskine Childers' hero that we should 'Read Dilke' is\r\nnot yet out of date. [Footnote: _Riddle of the Sands_, by Erskine\r\nChilders, popular edition, p. 127. First published March, 1903.]\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the book is contained in the opening words, 'The present\r\nposition of the European world is one in which sheer force holds a\r\nlarger place than it has held in modern times since the fall of\r\nNapoleon.' This reign of force the author traced back to 1878, the date\r\nof the Treaty of Berlin, but it was originally due, as he pointed out,\r\nto the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, which had left a permanent\r\nsource of irritation in the European States system. Nevertheless, he\r\nrecognized that for the time the continuance of Prince Bismarck's\r\npolicy, based as it was on the maintenance of the Treaty, meant peace,\r\nbecause Prince Bismarck believed peace to be necessary for the\r\nmaintenance in undiminished strength of the German Empire, wedged in\r\nbetween France and Russia, the former always hostile, the latter an\r\nuncertain quantity. An alliance with Austria-Hungary was necessary to\r\nthis policy: an alliance dictated by the fact that no other was likely\r\nto be permanent. Italy, it was true, had recently joined the alliance;\r\nbut Italy, like Russia, was an uncertain factor, and Sir Charles Dilke\r\nbelieved that, if a critical moment were to come, the desire to get the\r\nTrentino would be stronger than the ties of any alliance. The policy of\r\nPrince Bismarck was accordingly to prevent a Russo-French alliance, and\r\nto help Russia to push into the Far East; to help her also in the\r\nBalkans, but not beyond the point at which Austria might remonstrate;\r\nand to prevent Austria from seeking anything calculated to precipitate a\r\nwar between herself and Russia, such as an attempt to add to the\r\nposition which she had obtained in the Balkan Peninsula under the Treaty\r\nof Berlin. This policy also involved keeping Turkey quiet and preventing\r\na league of the Balkan States, lest such a league should irritate Russia\r\nand Austria and produce a European conflagration.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fadejew, in a celebrated pamphlet [Footnote: General Fadejew,\r\n_Über Russland's Kriegsmacht und Kriegspolitik_, Leipzig, 1870,\r\ntranslated from the Russian.] which fluttered all the Chancelleries of\r\nEurope in the early seventies, had said that the road from Russia to\r\nConstantinople lay through Vienna; and Vienna, Sir Charles agreed with\r\nthe Russian general, was the centre to be watched, for it was there that\r\nthe key of European policy was to be found. 'Austria interests me,' he\r\nwrote, when preparing his book, to Sir William White, the Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. 'I can't leave London, but I'm thinking of sending a man\r\nto Vienna to tell me certain things. If so, to whom should he go?' And\r\nhe watched the strange development of events in Bulgaria. Early in\r\nJanuary he notes an interview with 'Dr. Stoiloff, the ablest man except\r\nthe brutal Stambuloff, and the leader of the Conservative party' in\r\nBulgaria, where the perpetual intrigues of Russian agents, official and\r\nunofficial, had recently culminated, in August, 1886, in the kidnapping\r\nof the reigning chief of the State, Prince Alexander of Battenberg, and\r\nhad thereby created an Austrian party: events which were to have many\r\nlong-drawn-out consequences, as the following century to its own cost\r\nwas to find out. Bulgaria from this time began to move in an orbit of\r\nher own, distinct from, and often unfriendly to, the other Balkan\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 it was still a current belief--especially on the part of many of\r\nSir Charles's own political friends--that Germany was eagerly watching\r\nfor an opportunity to seize the German provinces of Austria, and that\r\nAustria was eagerly watching for an opportunity 'to go to Salonica,' as\r\nthe current phrase had it. The two propositions were almost mutually\r\ndestructive, but, without insisting on this rather obvious\r\nconsideration, Sir Charles was well aware that (even apart from reasons\r\nof international policy) Germany could not desire the disruption of\r\nAustria, because the German provinces of Upper and Lower Austria and\r\nStyria did not lie next to North Germany, but were cut off from it by\r\ncountries in which the most enterprising of all Slavonic peoples--the\r\nCzechs of Bohemia--'hated the Germans with a deadly hatred,' and\r\nalready, even in 1887, had got the upper hand. Count Bismarck himself\r\nhad resisted--and successfully--the desire of the military party to\r\nannex Bohemia in 1866 after Sadowa. The permanent exclusion of Austria\r\nand the House of Hapsburg from Germany was also no sudden or ephemeral\r\npolicy. In the middle of the seventeenth century, as the author of the\r\n_Holy Roman Empire_ had reminded his readers, it had been proposed by\r\nthe famous publicist Philippe Chemnitz, who wrote under the name of\r\n'Hippolytus à Lapide,' as the surest means of securing a permanent unity\r\nof some kind in Germany. [Footnote: See Bryce, _Holy Roman Empire_,\r\nchap. xx., p. 386; Louis Léger, _Histoire de l'Autriche-Hongrie_, chap.\r\nxv., p. 258.] It had been adopted by the leaders in the Frankfurt\r\nParliament of 1848-49, and Count Bismarck was the inheritor of these\r\ntraditions when he finally expelled the House of Hapsburg in 1866, and\r\nthus translated ancient theories into modern facts. It was therefore\r\nhighly improbable, to say the least, that only a few years after the\r\nTreaty of Berlin he should be engaged in an attempt to nullify his own\r\nwork. [Footnote: On January 14th, 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament voted\r\nthe exclusion of Austria from Germany.]\r\n\r\nAustria, Sir Charles Dilke pointed out, some day by mere competition\r\nwith Russia, if that Power made further advances, might perhaps be\r\nforced forward unwillingly to Salonica; but by thus seizing Macedonia--a\r\nfar larger proposition than that of the annexation of Bosnia and the\r\nHerzegovina, and in many respects a different one--it was clear she\r\nwould 'increase her military weakness, would deeply offend the Servians,\r\nthe Greeks, and the Bulgarians, and by increasing the number of her\r\nSlavonic subjects would only hasten her own break-up.' Here, in fact,\r\nlay the real danger to the 'Eastern Empire.' Prince Bismarck, as a\r\nmatter of fact, was of all men in Europe the man who most desired to\r\nkeep Austria alive. 'It is a necessity to him that she should continue\r\nto exist. Once destroy Austria, and Germany is left to fight it out with\r\nFrance and Russia without assistance, for in this case Italy would not\r\nmove,' notwithstanding the recently renewed Triple Alliance. That a\r\nmilitary party existed in Austria which might desire to go to Salonica,\r\nand would also rejoice in a war with Italy, Sir Charles was well aware;\r\nbut he saw no reason to believe that it would succeed in forcing these\r\nadventures on the Ballplatz, or on the statesmen of Hungary, who above\r\nall things dreaded an increase of the Slavonic elements in the Empire.\r\nThe Austria-Hungary of 1887 was the Austria-Hungary of the long rule of\r\nCount Taafe at Vienna, of M. Koloman Tisza at Buda-Pesth, and of Count\r\nKalnoky at the Ballplatz; and it was not unreasonable at that time to\r\nconsider it possible that, 'after the division of the respective spheres\r\nof influence of Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia, in Macedonia, Austria\r\nmight gradually increase her influence in the Balkan States; and if she\r\nwould take the bold step of making up an arrangement for evacuating part\r\nof Bosnia and the Herzegovina, so as to show she had no intention of\r\ngoing southwards to Salonica, she might bring together in a general\r\nunderstanding with herself the small States and the Turks.' This,\r\nhowever, Sir Charles admitted, was probably impracticable, 'as Austro-\r\nHungarian pride would effectually prevent the abandonment of any portion\r\nof Bosnia.' But so late as 1909 Dilke told Lord Fitzmaurice, when, at\r\nthe time of her final annexation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina,\r\nAustria-Hungary had retired from the Sandjak of Novi Bazar, that he\r\nthought the British Foreign Office 'had made too great a fuss' over the\r\nannexation, which had been certain to come, sooner or later. [Footnote:\r\nLord Fitzmaurice was then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and\r\nrepresented the Foreign Office in the House of Lords. See further as to\r\nSir Charles Dilke's' views on the events of 1908, Chapter LVIII.]\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Lowe is credited with having said that a metaphysician\r\nresembled a blind man groping in a dark room for a black hat that was\r\nnot there. The comparison might almost have been applied to the Foreign\r\nMinister of the Dual Empire, vainly seeking for a coherent policy among\r\nthe mists and cross-currents of rival nationalities. The charge to be\r\nmade against the foreign policy of Austria-Hungary was, in fact, not\r\nthat she had got a policy--good or bad, ambitious or the reverse--but\r\nthat it was almost impossible as a rule to ascertain whether she had any\r\npolicy at all: the explanation being that her internal problems\r\nparalyzed her action abroad. 'It was difficult to be a patriot in\r\nAustria, for nobody exactly knew to the representatives of what race,\r\ntongue, or language, his allegiance was due.' 'Austria was indeed of all\r\ncountries in the world by far the most difficult to govern, and as a\r\nnecessity of her condition she must before all things long for peace....\r\nUnder her many difficulties caused by racial divisions she had become\r\nconstitutionally timid and naturally slow to move, and the outlook was\r\nfar from promising ... nor had Prince Bismarck'--notwithstanding the\r\nterms of the Triple Alliance--'bound Germany to espouse all the quarrels\r\nof Austria, no matter where and with whom.' It had been said, and by\r\nPrince Bismarck himself, that the bones of not a single Pomeranian\r\ngrenadier should be allowed to whiten in a Balkan quarrel. [Footnote:\r\nSpeech in the Reichstag, December 16th, 1876.] 'The only real question\r\nworth asking was: Will Austria resist Russian pretensions, and will she,\r\nif in danger of conquest, be supported by allies, or will she yield and\r\ntake her share of the spoils?' [Footnote: _The Present Position of\r\nEuropean Politics_, pp. 185, 193, 194, 205, 206, 219, 221-224.]\r\n\r\nThe long-standing jealousies, also, of Austria-Hungary, Italy, and\r\nGreece, in regard to the future of the Adriatic coast, Sir Charles Dilke\r\nfelt were not sufficiently appreciated in England, where public opinion\r\nwas too much inclined to see the Turk and the Slav only in every\r\nquestion concerned with the Balkan Peninsula. When Under-Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs in 1880-81, he had given a strong support to the\r\nproposals in regard to Albania of Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, which had the\r\napproval of Mr. Goschen, then Special Ambassador to the Porte--proposals\r\nwhich were framed with a view to the ultimate autonomy of the country,\r\nand were not accepted by the European Commission of Reforms, mainly\r\nowing to the opposition of Austria-Hungary. [Footnote: See _Life of Lord\r\nGoschen_, vol. i, p. 215. These proposals were revived in 1912, and,\r\nwhich is remarkable, by Count Berchtold, the Foreign Minister of\r\nAustria-Hungary, in a despatch in favour of 'progressive\r\ndecentralization.' See an article in the _Edinburgh Review_, April,\r\n1913: 'Austria and Italy have been rivals for influence in Albania, as\r\nAustria and Russia were rivals in Macedonia. It was because of this\r\nrivalry that the Treaty of Berlin, so far as it applied to the European\r\nprovinces of Turkey, was never properly carried into effect. For the\r\nsame reason the Fitzmaurice proposal of 1880 was defeated by the\r\nopposition of Vienna. The suggestion was that a greater Albania should\r\nbe created, which would have been autonomous under a European guarantee.\r\nIt is among the ironies of history that this scheme, rejected by Austria\r\nwhen it came from a friendly and neutral source, should have been put\r\nforward by the Austrian Foreign Office itself thirty-two years later.\r\nCount Berchtold's Circular Note of August 14th, 1912, revived the\r\nFitzmaurice programme. The proposition came too late.'] But in _The\r\nPresent Position of European Politics_ it is seen how the author's\r\nincreasing confidence in the future of Greece led to a change of opinion\r\non this, the most intricate, perhaps, of all diplomatic questions\r\nconnected with the Near East. He now advocated as large an extension as\r\npossible of the existing northern boundary of Greece, and held that the\r\nrest of Albania should be joined to Greece by some form of personal\r\nunion, which ultimately might grow into a closer tie, bearing in mind\r\nthe friendly cooperation of Greeks and Albanians in the War of\r\nIndependence against Turkey, and the fact that a strong Albanian element\r\nalready existed in the Greek kingdom. [Footnote: _The Present Position\r\nof European Politics_, pp. 146, 148, 193, 206, 214-217, 232, 237, 238.]\r\nA European Congress seemed to him the only method to avoid the ultimate\r\narbitrament of war in this mass of tangled questions, but experience had\r\nshown that a Congress was useless unless the Great Powers had settled\r\nthe main questions beforehand in agreement among themselves. Experience\r\nhad unfortunately also shown the extreme difficulty of obtaining any\r\nsuch agreement.\r\n\r\n'Austria ought to have been the heir of Turkey; the protector of a\r\nGreece extended to include Albania, Macedonia, the Islands, and the\r\ncoast to Constantinople and down to Asia Minor; the friend of Servia and\r\nRoumania, and what not.' But these things remained in the class of\r\nvisions, even if occasionally some Austrian or Hungarian statesman, like\r\nHerr von Kallay, seemed disposed to grasp them, and to renew the\r\ntradition of the forward policy attributed to Prince Eugène of Savoy and\r\nthe Archduke Charles. Hungary also had made Roumania her antagonist by\r\nher illiberal policy in regard to the navigation of the Danube. Any\r\npermanent confederation of the Balkan States as distinct from a\r\ntemporary alliance for some special and defined object, such as a\r\npossible attack on Turkey, seemed therefore no longer possible,\r\nespecially after the recent events in Bulgaria. Meanwhile there was to\r\nbe peace, because Prince Bismarck so willed it. [Footnote: See _Der\r\nKrimkrieg und die Österreichische Politik_, von Heinrich Friedjung,\r\nchap, ii., p. 16 (Stuttgart und Berlin, 1907); Louis Léger, _Études\r\nSlaves: L'Autriche-Hongrie et la Question d'Orient_, p. 395.]\r\n\r\nThe overmastering sense of the importance of whatever happened at Vienna\r\nand Constantinople--of which every page of _The Present Position of\r\nEuropean Politics_ is the evidence--will largely explain Sir Charles\r\nDilke's views on another question. It has been seen that he was amongst\r\nthe strongest advocates of an active policy in Egypt in 1882, agreeing\r\nin this with Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Hartington. But at an early period\r\nafter the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir he pronounced himself, when the\r\nquestion arose, in favour of the earliest possible evacuation of the\r\ncountry, and contemplated it as a possibility of the immediate future.\r\n[Footnote: Sir Charles wrote in the _Speaker_ of January 23rd, 1892, in\r\nreply to Admiral Maxse: 'Admiral Maxse appears to think that my views in\r\nfavour of evacuation have been recently formed....' 'There was a time,\r\n_before_ the intervention of the condominium with France by Lord Derby,\r\nwhen I held a different view; but it was not only formed under\r\ncircumstances very different from those which have now existed for\r\nfourteen years, but also at a time when I had not given special\r\nconsideration to our probable naval and military position in the event\r\nof war.'] Egypt to him, considered from the point of view of British\r\ninterests, was subsidiary to Constantinople. All that really signified\r\nwas the right of passage through the Suez Canal, which could, he\r\nbelieved, be secured by international arrangement and the neutralization\r\nof the country, a plan for which, as already seen, was being actually\r\ndiscussed by Mr. Gladstone's Government when it fell. Egypt, in fact, he\r\nregarded as part of Asia rather than of Africa, and he believed that\r\ntime would make this more clear than ever, in proportion as railways\r\nwere developed in Syria, Arabia, and Asia Minor. In this connection\r\nConstantinople, not Alexandria or Cairo, seemed to him the decisive\r\nfactor: an opinion which brought him into opposition with those who held\r\nthe view that since the occupation of Egypt by British troops events at\r\nConstantinople had become comparatively unimportant to this country. He\r\nalso feared that if some great European crisis were to arise, in which\r\nGreat Britain was involved, the occupation of Egypt might be a hindrance\r\nrather than a source of strength, and might hamper our exertions in\r\nother lands.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, no fear of allowing the Bosporus and the Dardanelles to\r\nbe opened under suitable conditions to the passage of Russian ships of\r\nwar, but only on the condition laid down by Sir William White, that the\r\nright accorded to Russia must be accorded to the ships of war of other\r\nnations; and this partly out of regard to the dignity of the British\r\nflag, and partly because any exclusive right accorded to Russia would be\r\nresisted by the States bordering on the Black Sea and by those\r\ninterested in the trade and navigation of the Danube. But the opening of\r\nthe Straits was one thing, the possession of Constantinople by Russia\r\nwas another, and in his opinion would cause a European convulsion; for\r\nhe saw in Constantinople what has since been termed 'the great strategic\r\ncentre of the world': [Footnote: The expression was used by Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill in a speech on November 15th, 1915, in the House of Commons.]\r\nthe meeting-place and clearing-house of the trade and politics of three\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n'Russia at Constantinople,' he wrote, 'would mean the destruction of\r\nAustria and the Russification of a large portion of her Slavs. When\r\nAustria had disappeared or had been transformed out of all knowledge,\r\nGermany, placed between France and Russia, would be still weaker in her\r\nmilitary position than she is at present. It is no doubt impossible that\r\nGermany can really contemplate that contingency with complete\r\nsatisfaction. And if she cannot get other people to help Austria to keep\r\nRussia away from Constantinople, it is probable that she would be forced\r\nto interfere to help to do so, however stoutly her rulers may make the\r\nopposite declaration. One of my most valued correspondents, whose\r\ncriticisms have been of the highest use to me, admits that to place\r\nTurkey at the head of a Balkan Confederation would be \"adding a badger\r\nto your three unfriendly cats and altogether hostile dog\"; but,\r\nnevertheless, he thinks that such a combination would be possible on\r\naccount of the overwhelming dread of the danger of absorption by Russia;\r\nand I think it right to state his view, although I am unable to modify\r\nthat which I have said as to the difficulties which the dispute for\r\nMacedonia causes.' [Footnote: _The Present Position of European\r\nPolitics_, pp. 372, 373.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1891 this note occurs in the Memoir: 'John Morley\r\nhaving made a speech in favour of the cessation of the Egyptian\r\noccupation, I wrote to tell him how pleased I was, and in his reply he\r\nasked why we should go on mechanically applauding Lord Salisbury's\r\nforeign policy, which left this danger standing.'\r\n\r\nMr. Morley's satisfaction was, however, not shared by Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nwho wrote in January, 1892, 'to implore me to have regard to the opinion\r\nof society about Egypt.'\r\n\r\n'I do not mean fashionable society,' he added, 'but political society,\r\nand the great majority of cultivated politicians. I think you do go out\r\nof your way to offend them when you advocate evacuation of Egypt, and I\r\nask you to consider if it is worth your while. It is not necessary for\r\nyour constituents, and with regard to the others, there is no need to\r\nadd to their causes of anger against you. My advice is, \"Be as Radical\r\nas you like, be Home Ruler if you must, but be a little Jingo if you\r\ncan.\"'\r\n\r\nThe correspondence had begun in the autumn of 1891, when Sir Charles\r\nwrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n    'Pyrford by Maybury,\r\n    'Near Woking,\r\n    '_October_ 19_th_, 1891.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Chamberlain,\r\n\r\n    'I have never said that there are not conceivable circumstances in\r\n    which it would be better for us to be in Egypt. I'm going to try and\r\n    discuss them in the book I am at work on. _Re_ command of the sea\r\n    against France. We have not quite a sufficient force to blockade\r\n    Brest and Toulon. Lefevre and most of our sailors contemplate only\r\n    \"masking\" Toulon by a fleet at Gibraltar, and using the Cape route.\r\n    In this case we could not reinforce Egypt except from India, and\r\n    not, of course, from India if we were at war with Russia too.\r\n\r\n    'I am in favour of a stronger navy, and attempting blockade, though\r\n    it is not _certain_ that it can be made _for certain_ successful.\r\n    Still Colomb is a better authority than Beresford, etc. I mean\r\n    \"Admiral Colomb,\" not Sir John. The difficulty, even if blockades\r\n    are possible, is that France keeps building after us so as always to\r\n    be without the limits which would make it possible. Lefevre will\r\n    support Mr. G. in cutting down the navy on this ground--i.e., will\r\n    prove by figures that every time we lay down nine ships the French\r\n    lay down six or seven.\r\n\r\n    'I think that in the long-run France will beat Germany. She will\r\n    fight her some day single-handed on a point in which Austria and\r\n    Italy will not move, nor Russia either. Then, if Germany gets the\r\n    best of it, the others will \"mediate.\"\r\n\r\n    'Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    'Chs. W. D.'\r\n\r\n    'November, 1891, we spent in France.... While I was away I had a\r\n    correspondence with Chamberlain about his speech on Egypt' (in reply\r\n    to Morley), 'and pointed out to him,' says the Memoir,' that he had\r\n    changed his mind so completely about evacuation that it was hardly\r\n    prudent in him not frankly to admit the change of mind, as he had\r\n    done in at least one speech previously.' He replied:\r\n\r\n    '\"I have looked the matter up, and I think it is quite true that in\r\n    1884 we were all for evacuation as early as possible. But I did not\r\n    then estimate properly the magnitude of the task we had undertaken,\r\n    nor did I know how splendidly it would be performed by Baring and\r\n    his colleagues. Baring himself began as a strong advocate for\r\n    evacuation.\"\r\n\r\n    'In my answer, I said that Baring had only changed his mind in the\r\n    way in which all people are apt to change their minds when they are\r\n    employed as the agents of a policy, and I combated Chamberlain's\r\n    military views, which were, in fact, for defending Egypt by the\r\n    fleet--that fleet which is expected to do everything!'\r\n\r\nSir Charles set out in an article in the _Speaker_ all the pledges to\r\nevacuate which had been given by the Liberal Government and repeated by\r\nLord Salisbury. Thereupon Mr. Morley, whose general views on foreign\r\npolicy were not as a rule at all the same as those of Sir Charles, wrote\r\nfrom Biarritz, where he was in Mr. Gladstone's company, that he had read\r\nthe _Speaker_ with enormous satisfaction. It would have a stimulating\r\neffect in quarters where a little stimulus was much needed, and had\r\ngiven much satisfaction to other people in Biarritz besides himself.\r\n\r\n'\"Quarters\" of course meant Rosebery,' is Sir Charles's comment, and he\r\nadds:\r\n\r\n    'In order to meet the Rosebery objection to evacuation, I wrote an\r\n    article for the January _Fortnightly_, of which the editor changed\r\n    nothing but the title. I had called it \"Lords Salisbury and\r\n    Rosebery,\" and he changed it to \"Conservative Foreign Policy.\"'\r\n\r\nAt a later date, in a letter [Footnote: This letter was apparently\r\nwritten on April 14th, 1893:\r\n\r\n    'Those of us who bitterly dislike the occupation of Egypt by a\r\n    British force have been both to add to your work before and during a\r\n    session in which, not to speak of the ordinary demand on the time of\r\n    a Prime Minister, your unprecedented relation to the chief measure\r\n    makes it the duty of your supporters to confine themselves to\r\n    helping clear the road. Naught else could have excused us from\r\n    having hitherto refrained from pressing the state of Egypt on the\r\n    consideration of yourself, or of the House of Commons. It is only\r\n    because since the publication of a recent despatch we feel that the\r\n    time has nearly come for making up one's mind to be for ever silent\r\n    upon the question, and because I cannot do so, given the strong\r\n    feeling that I have with regard to it, without one last attempt to\r\n    cause some change in a \"temporary\" situation now crystallizing into\r\n    permanency, that I venture to address you. I ask for no reply. I\r\n    shall have to bring the question before the House of Commons. I have\r\n    no illusions as to what is likely to be the result of so doing. Sir\r\n    E. Grey will tell us that the occupation is still \"temporary,\" but\r\n    must last, \"for the sake of Egypt,\" till we can \"with safety\" leave:\r\n    and so it will continue, with all its dangers to ourselves, till the\r\n    next great war. Whoever else may again raise the Egyptian question\r\n    in the future, I shall not. Vote I must, whenever it comes before\r\n    the House, but I need not do more.\r\n\r\n    'Not one word of blame of anyone will fall from me when I raise the\r\n    question on first going into Committee on Civil Estimates. It seems\r\n    to me, I confess--but I shall try to keep the opinion to myself--\r\n    that it would have been, on the whole, the safest course to have\r\n    done in 1892 that which Lord Granville, under your guidance, did in\r\n    1880, and to have ourselves proposed, on the very day of the\r\n    accession to office of the new Government, the policy which we\r\n    thought best in the interest of the country and had supported in\r\n    Opposition. Lord Granville congratulated himself, and with justice,\r\n    on the promptitude with which, before the Russians could say a word\r\n    to him as to the complete fulfilment of the Treaty of Berlin, he had\r\n    told the Ambassador, in the first minute of their first interview,\r\n    that the Government would insist on that fulfilment. Had the present\r\n    Secretary of State, at his first interview with the French\r\n    Ambassador, made a similar communication with regard to Egypt (at\r\n    least so far as to propose to resume the negotiations of 1887), we\r\n    should, perhaps, have avoided many evils. I share to the full the\r\n    belief, which you expressed in such admirable terms a couple of\r\n    years ago, that the long-lasting occupation of Egypt by our forces\r\n    is the cause of all the difficulties by which our foreign policy,\r\n    and even our position in Europe, are oppressed. Our hands are not\r\n    free, and never will be free, so long as the occupation continues.\r\n    But ills more direct are likely to fall upon us; and no one can look\r\n    forward without the gravest dread to the prospect of our being\r\n    drawn, step by step, into a situation in which we shall be driven to\r\n    arrest the persons of the young Khedive and those of his advisers\r\n    who possess the confidence of all that is intelligent among the\r\n    Egyptian people; or (as seems hinted in Lord Bosebery's despatch) to\r\n    insist upon a deposition.\r\n\r\n    'In the discussions as to the occupation of Egypt which occurred in\r\n    the Cabinet, before I was a member of it, in 1882, even before the\r\n    expedition (for the occupation was foreseen), I took a share, as\r\n    Lord Granville was good enough to consult me on the papers\r\n    circulated by his colleagues. As far as I am concerned, I have never\r\n    budged from the principles of a memorandum which I wrote on July\r\n    4th, 1882; but those principles were far more excellently stated by\r\n    you in a memorandum of the beginning of September, 1882--before\r\n    Tel-el-Kebir--a memorandum which was approved by men now so hostile\r\n    to your views as Sir Auckland Colvin and Sir Edward Malet. Sir E.\r\n    Baring, now, as Lord Cromer, so bitterly opposed to us, in a paper\r\n    of September or October, 1882, and Chamberlain in his paper of about\r\n    October 21st, 1882, both pointed out how essential it was that our\r\n    occupation should be really temporary, and that our condition--that\r\n    we should leave behind us a \"stable\" state of things--depended on\r\n    and meant what Chamberlain called \"the extension of Egyptian\r\n    liberties\": the convoking, if not of a truly representative\r\n    Assembly, at least of the Notables. Lord Dufferin, in December 1882,\r\n    wrote to me that he would sooner run any risk than abandon the\r\n    representative institutions proposed for Egypt in his famous scheme.\r\n    Yet now the French are bidding the Khedive call together, against\r\n    Lord Dufferin's virtual successor, this very Assembly of Notables,\r\n    which Lord Cromer, such is his present policy, dare not call. The\r\n    conception of this Assembly was the act of yourself, supported by\r\n    Lord Granville and Sir William Harcourt and supported on paper by\r\n    Lord Dufferin and Sir E. Baring, and opposed by Lord Hartington, by\r\n    the then Chancellor, and by Lord Northbrook. This \"extension of\r\n    Egyptian liberties,\" which was our pride, which was our excuse for\r\n    that \"short prolongation\" of the occupation, to which I was myself\r\n    opposed--an extension of liberties which has not been carried into\r\n    practical effect by us--is certain to result in a declaration by the\r\n    Notables, when they meet, as within this year, through the French\r\n    Agent's influence, they will, that they are rootedly opposed to our\r\n    presence in their land.\r\n\r\n    'It may be said that neither the Turks nor the French have pressed\r\n    us, directly, to come out. The Turks will never really press us. The\r\n    Sultan is forced by Moslem public opinion to ask us to leave Egypt,\r\n    but he is in fact personally anxious that we should stay there to\r\n    keep Mahdism in the desert and representative institutions in the\r\n    shade. The French have also their inner policy--their Rothschilds to\r\n    keep in good humour--and two currents, one political and one\r\n    financial, with which to deal. M. Waddington expressed to you at\r\n    Hawarden a mere desire for exchange of views between the Cabinets.\r\n    He was naturally anxious not to be refused in any direct request.\r\n    But French public opinion is exasperated against us; only one man in\r\n    France believes a word we say, and our diplomatists and admirals\r\n    behave as though they represented German instead of neutral\r\n    interests. We are responsible for tempting Italy to stay in the\r\n    alliance of the Central Powers, to her own hurt.\r\n\r\n    'None of these things shall I be able to say when I bring the\r\n    question before the House of Commons. To do so would involve\r\n    statements based on private letters and statements as to Cabinet\r\n    differences of 1882, which I cannot make. We shall be compelled to\r\n    rely chiefly upon the declarations of Lord Salisbury, which were\r\n    summed up in his words of May, 1887, to the effect that the\r\n    occupation entails on us \"heavy sacrifices, without adequate return\r\n    either in peace or in war.\"\r\n\r\n    'Having given attention for some years past to our general position\r\n    as a nation, feeling as I do, with you, how adversely it is affected\r\n    by the prolongation of the \"temporary\" occupation, which, as matters\r\n    stand, seems likely to endure till the next war, even should it be\r\n    postponed till half a century hence, I cannot but feel miserable at\r\n    the situation of this affair, and I once more ask your pardon for in\r\n    this way liberating my mind, or, I fear, rather discharging upon\r\n    you, regardless of your prodigious avocations, this last expression\r\n    of a regret deeper than that which I have previously entertained on\r\n    any public question.\r\n\r\n    'Through the mischiefs of the occupation there now seems to come no\r\n    single ray of light. The present year will not pass over without a\r\n    change in the local situation at Cairo, from which a conference is\r\n    likely to result. A passage near the end of Lord Rosebery's despatch\r\n    shows that he is prepared to have a conference forced upon him. Had\r\n    we invited it, such a conference would be to us the blessing that it\r\n    will be to others. Would it not at least be best that we should call\r\n    that conference on the first opportunity rather than have it thrust\r\n    down our throats?\r\n\r\n    'This letter has not been shown to anyone, and needs, as I said, no\r\n    reply, but I should be glad if it were not handed to anyone outside\r\n    of your own circle. It has not been mentioned to anyone except Mr.\r\n    Herbert Gladstone.']\r\n\r\nto Mr. Gladstone during his last Premiership, Dilke summed up his views\r\nwhen a debate was about to take place in the House of Commons, and four\r\ndays later he notes: 'On April 18th I had a long interview with Mr.\r\nGladstone, who sent for me, on my letter. The only thing he said worth\r\nremembering was, \"Jingoism is stronger than ever. It is no longer war\r\nfever, but earth hunger.\"'\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the possibility of a German attempt to violate the neutrality of\r\nBelgian territory, notwithstanding the treaty of guarantee of 1839,\r\nwhich Prussia herself had signed, was again attracting attention owing\r\nto a sudden renewal of warlike apprehensions on the Continent. The\r\nposition of Luxemburg was a kindred question, though the international\r\nguarantee was of a far more uncertain character than in the case of\r\nBelgium. Sir Charles, as already related, had returned from his work in\r\nFrance during the war of 1870 with a profound conviction that a spirit\r\nof reckless violence was abroad in Germany, which would stop at nothing\r\nif favourable circumstances offered a temptation to action; and in his\r\nopinion the absence of any fortifications at Liége and Namur afforded\r\nsuch a temptation. The point had been till then little discussed in\r\nEngland, though General Brialmont had written in the _Revue de Belgique_\r\non the subject. Sir Charles's view having been questioned, that the\r\ndanger to Belgium's neutrality for military and other reasons was from\r\nGermany alone, he drew attention to the enormous accumulation of\r\nsupplies of every kind in the entrenched camp of Cologne as of itself\r\nsufficient in military eyes to prove the truth of what he said. He\r\nconsidered also that the reduction of our horse artillery greatly\r\nimpaired the possibility of Great Britain affording really effectual\r\nmilitary assistance to Belgium, and that the recent utterances of the\r\nprincipal organ of the Conservative party, the _Standard_, and of the\r\nwriters in the _National Review_, that intervention in support of\r\nBelgium 'would be not only insane but impossible,' showed that the\r\npublic opinion of Great Britain was no longer unanimous as it had been\r\nin 1870-71. [Footnote: The questions connected with the Belgian and\r\nLuxemburg guarantees are very fully discussed in a recent work,\r\n_England's Guarantee to Belgium and Luxemburg_, by C. P. Sanger and H.\r\nT. J. Norton. See also chapter i. of _War: Its Conduct and Legal\r\nResults_, by Dr. Baty and Prof. J. H. Morgan; _The Present Position of\r\nEuropean Politics_, pp. 42-48, 73, 321-323.] This dispassionate\r\nconsideration of the chances of England's intervening single-handed and\r\nwithout allies, in the case of a European war, to protect the neutrality\r\nof an unfortified Belgium, led to statements that he was opposed to such\r\na step, and he had to point out in reply that for years he had\r\nconsistently expressed the contrary view, but that he was now dealing\r\nwith facts and tendencies, not with his own wishes. [Footnote: _British\r\nArmy_, chap. ii., p. 55.] Shortly after the appearance of this article,\r\ndiscussion in Belgium led to the introduction of a Government Bill for\r\nthe fortification of the towns upon the Meuse, and it was afterwards\r\ndecided to fortify Namur and Liége.\r\n\r\nEstimating the probabilities of a Continental war, he thought that\r\nRussia came next to England in staying power, because her enormous army\r\nformed a smaller proportion of her working class than in the case of any\r\nother great Continental Power. Notwithstanding his suspicions of her\r\npolicy, he spoke of Russia with a deep and discriminating interest born\r\nof numerous visits to all parts of her dominions, and deprecated the\r\nattitude of those Englishmen whose dislike of Russia had done harm to\r\nthe cause of sense and truth by exaggeration, and had led them to ignore\r\n'her power and the marvellous patriotism of her people.' 'In the union\r\nof patriotism with religion I know no nation which can approach them.'\r\nThere could be no doubt in any reasonable mind of her real and lasting\r\nstrength. But her unlimited power of self-deception; the necessary\r\ninstability of a policy resting upon the will of a single man; her\r\nmisgovernment of Poland and her alienation of Bulgaria, constituted\r\ndangers which it was idle to ignore. He, however, set against these\r\nweaknesses her popularity with all the Slav nations; her influence in\r\nthe Baltic provinces of Germany, and even with the Poles, 'who, like\r\neveryone else of Slavonic race, seem born with a hatred of the Teutons.'\r\n\r\n    'The only foreigner who is known to the Russian peasantry is the\r\n    German, and the name for German and for foreigner with the peasantry\r\n    is the same, and the hatred of the \"dumb men,\" as they call their\r\n    German neighbours, is intense. The peasantry know little of the\r\n    English, and if you listen to their sentiments you discover that it\r\n    is their belief that one day there will be between _them_ and\r\n    Germany a war compared with which, their soldiers say, that of 1870\r\n    will be child's play, and that if Germany wins this will not be the\r\n    end, but that war after war will follow until Germany is destroyed.'\r\n\r\n    'Because Russia is very violent in her language and her acts, we\r\n    often fail to see how a peasantry, which an aristocratic government\r\n    or a government of political economists could never win, is won over\r\n    by her to her rule. The Moscow men failed in Bulgaria, but in Poland\r\n    they succeeded, and in the Baltic provinces, too, their methods and\r\n    their policy have not been wanting, and the problems that have so\r\n    long perplexed this country in her relations with Ireland would have\r\n    been solved in a week by Samarin, or Miliutin, or Prince\r\n    Teherkasky.' [Footnote: _Present Position of European Politics_, pp.\r\n    125, 134.]\r\n\r\nThe popular phrases which dubbed Sir Charles Dilke as 'anti-German' or\r\n'anti-Russian' were never more curiously misapplied. The flaw to be\r\nfound even in the mental constitution of Gambetta's great personality,\r\nas shown by his antagonism to Russia, had no part in his friend's\r\noutlook; nor did Sir Charles's friendship for all things French make him\r\nan enemy to Germany, though the possibility of conjuring 'the German\r\nperil' was ever in his mind. But he doubted the wisdom of the wavering\r\ncounsels which began with 'lying down to Germany,' and were to be marked\r\nby the cession of Heligoland. Strong men and strong Governments\r\nrecognize and respect one another; and in dealing with Germany he\r\nbelieved that it was necessary never to forget this trite yet valuable\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nIf personal friendships and political sympathy made Sir Charles, as the\r\nprevious chapters have shown, look constantly to France as the natural\r\nally of Great Britain, and also her most desirable ally, neither\r\nfriendships nor sympathies could blind him to the constant danger\r\narising from the instability of French Administrations, and the\r\nconsequent difficulty of relying on any certainty in arrangements\r\nprojected for joint action. Of this the events connected with Egypt had\r\nbeen a most conspicuous illustration. Nor were these the only dangers:\r\nfor the best friends of France were painfully aware of the immense\r\ninfluence exercised by powerful financial interests both in her domestic\r\nand in her foreign affairs, and by the growth of fierce antagonisms on\r\nhome questions which seemed to tear the country asunder and paralyze her\r\nposition abroad. Numerous questions, not only in Egypt, but elsewhere in\r\nAfrica; the old quarrels about the Newfoundland fisheries, on which Sir\r\nCharles was constantly putting his finger as a possible cause of a\r\nserious quarrel; and increasing jealousies in the Pacific, contributed\r\nto produce a condition of permanent tension for many years in the\r\nrelations of the two countries, until the Fashoda incident in 1898\r\nbrought a crisis which cleared the air. Two of the ablest men in France,\r\nM. Jules Ferry and M. Hanotaux, were, to say the least, not friendly to\r\nGreat Britain, and a plan which Sir Julian Pauncefote [Footnote: Then\r\nPermanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and afterwards Lord\r\nPauncefote and Ambassador at Washington.] had suggested in 1884, of\r\nattempting to bring all outstanding questions with France into one great\r\nsettlement, fell still-born, to be vivified, but twenty years later, by\r\nLord Lansdowne in more favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn all possible complications Sir Charles relied much on Italy's close\r\nfriendship for England--notwithstanding her entry into the Triple\r\nAlliance--a friendship due to permanent gratitude for the support which\r\nshe had received from Lord Russell, Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Palmerston,\r\nat the crisis of her fate in 1859; and also to the offer to her of a\r\njoint occupation of Egypt in 1882--an offer rejected indeed, but\r\nfruitful of good feeling.\r\n\r\nBut more important even than any question of alliances was, he insisted,\r\nthe necessity that Great Britain should know her own mind, and have a\r\ndefinite policy in regard to the future of Constantinople and of Egypt,\r\nand in regard to the Belgian guarantee. Army organization itself\r\nobviously depended on policy, and in this connection there was a danger\r\nat home greater, perhaps, than any originating abroad.\r\n\r\n    'It is too much the case with us in England,' he wrote, 'that when\r\n    we are occupied with the consideration of the Irish problem, or\r\n    dealing with the circumstances which most often lead to the rise and\r\n    fall of Ministries, we allow the foreign affairs of the country to\r\n    be transacted in the dark: with an absence of control which, owing\r\n    to the efficiency of our Foreign Office, may produce no ill, but\r\n    also with an absence of knowledge which cannot be advantageous. On\r\n    the other hand, when some awkward circumstance arises, a\r\n    disproportionate weight is attached to it by those who have wilfully\r\n    remained in ignorance of the true position, and the diplomacy of the\r\n    country is suddenly unduly hampered by criticism which rests on no\r\n    foundation of fact.'\r\n\r\nSpeaking from experience, he uttered a warning as to the danger of\r\nuninstructed debates and foolish questions--then so frequent--on foreign\r\naffairs in the House of Commons, and the harm done by them abroad. He\r\nspoke of the tendency to take advantage of some rebuff in foreign\r\naffairs for party motives, and urged that, as secrecy was not to be\r\nhoped for, members should at least try to inform themselves and the\r\nelectorate, and avoid 'periods of ignorant calm' or 'equally ignorant\r\npanic.' In this connection he never ceased to insist on the weakness of\r\nour position abroad, owing to the deficient strength and want of\r\norganization of our army; the small results shown for the immense amount\r\nspent; the insufficient stock of arms and ammunition, and the poor\r\nreserves of rifles; and he urged that, whatever our economies, none\r\nshould fall upon equipment or reserves of material. Such economies he\r\nstigmatized as a 'horrible treachery to the interests of the country.'\r\n[Footnote: The military situation as a whole is discussed in chapter vi.\r\nof _The Present Position of European Politics_, 'The United Kingdom.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LIFE AND RETURN TO PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n1886-1894\r\n\r\n\r\nPathways of return to political life soon began to open to Sir Charles\r\nDilke. In November, 1886, Mr. Labouchere wrote:\r\n\r\n    'It looks as though Chamberlain will be the scapegoat. At present\r\n    his going over bag and baggage to the Whigs has utterly disgusted\r\n    the Radicals. As long as Gladstone lives things will go on fairly\r\n    with us, but after--the deluge. The Radical M.P.'s are regretting\r\n    your not being in, as they would have accepted you as the leader.'\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1886 the Council of the Chelsea Liberal Association\r\nunanimously asked him to be their candidate (for Parliament), but he\r\nreplied that he could not serve the borough to his own satisfaction\r\nwhile so large a section of the public still attached weight to the\r\n'gross calumnies' with which he had been assailed. He was, however, from\r\nthe autumn of 1887, increasingly active in local affairs, both on the\r\nVestry and the Board of Guardians, [Footnote: In the winter of 1888, Sir\r\nCharles was unanimously elected Chairman of the Board of Guardians, as\r\nalso of the Vestry ('as was the case in subsequent years'). He wrote to\r\nMr. Chamberlain: 'I've taken the chairmanship of the Chelsea Board of\r\nGuardians, so am keeping my hand in on the prevention of obstruction. I\r\nam forced to begin gradually with them, and have only as yet ruled that\r\nI cannot _let two speak at once_.'] and also on the newly formed Library\r\nCommittee, on which he served for three years, till both the local\r\nlibraries were established and opened.\r\n\r\nTo M. Joseph Reinach he wrote in April, 1887: 'I have a splendid\r\nposition as a writer, and writing projects which will occupy me for\r\nthree years at least; and if any great calamity should occur which would\r\nforce me back into public life--such as war with Russia, for example--I\r\ndo not know that I should like the change.' Nor was the political scene\r\nattractive at this moment. His friends were tearing each other asunder;\r\nand not only his political friends--both parties were rent with faction.\r\n\r\n    'On October 1st, 1886, Chamberlain called and gave me an interesting\r\n    picture of the political state. He seemed to think that he could\r\n    keep Mr. Gladstone out for life, and was persuaded that Randolph\r\n    would give him all he wanted and leave Hartington and Salisbury in\r\n    the lurch. Randolph had promised him to have an anti-Jingo foreign\r\n    policy, leaving Turkey to her fate, and to pacify Ireland with the\r\n    National Councils scheme, modified into two Councils, or into\r\n    Provincial Councils, to suit Ulster; and Churchill had also promised\r\n    him procedure reform--that is, a sharper closure--and a three-acres-\r\n    and-a-cow policy for England.\r\n\r\n    'There was an article in the _Morning Post_, October 2nd,\r\n    representing Churchill's democratic views, but in the later autumn\r\n    (while Chamberlain was away abroad) Churchill was beaten in the\r\n    Cabinet both on his Irish scheme and also on the amendments which he\r\n    proposed to make in the Local Government (England) Bill in the\r\n    three-acres-and-a-cow direction. On December 17th Chamberlain, who\r\n    had returned from abroad, came to lunch with me, furious at the\r\n    defeat of Randolph Churchill. He found no fault with the Irish\r\n    policy' (which was strongly coercionist), 'or with the foreign\r\n    policy of the Cabinet; but he was anxious to defeat them on their\r\n    Local Government (England) Bill, if it was not altered back again to\r\n    suit his policy. Ultimately a compromise on this matter was\r\n    arranged.'\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed as if Chamberlain's anger with the Tory party was\r\ngoing to drive him back into his old associations. On December 31st,\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain and John Morley came in together to lunch, Chamberlain\r\n    having been asked and Morley not, and it was somewhat startling.\r\n    \"Chamberlain thinks that he can get Mr. Gladstone by the bait of\r\n    'Four times Prime Minister' to accept his terms. On the other hand,\r\n    Mr. Gladstone thinks that he can detach Chamberlain from Hartington.\r\n    Conferences are sitting: Harcourt, Herschell, and Morley, meeting\r\n    Chamberlain and Trevelyan. Hartington is crusty at this. Chamberlain\r\n    has threatened Hartington with the consequences if he, as he wants\r\n    to, supports a reactionary Local Government Bill of Salisbury's.\r\n    Chamberlain has written to Salisbury as to this Local Government\r\n    Bill, and received a dilatory reply.\" He told me the whole long\r\n    history of Randolph's troubles with the Cabinet which preceded his\r\n    resignation; first on procedure, as to which he finally obtained his\r\n    own way, secondly as to foreign affairs, thirdly as to allotments,\r\n    fourthly as to Local Government, and fifthly as to finance.\r\n    Churchill always stood absolutely alone, and, being in a minority of\r\n    one, could only get his way at all by continually tendering his\r\n    resignation. At last he resigned once too often, as it was of course\r\n    on the wrong subject; Salisbury jumped at it, and accepted it in a\r\n    cool letter when Churchill did not mean it in the least. It was only\r\n    the classical annual resignation of a Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\n    against his colleagues of the army and navy. The Budget always\r\n    involves the resignation either of the Secretary of State for War\r\n    and First Lord of the Admiralty, or else of the Chancellor of the\r\n    Exchequer, but hitherto they have always managed to make it up.'\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight Sir Charles 'was hearing from all sides about the\r\nRound Table Conferences which were intended to reunite the Liberal\r\nparty.... From Chamberlain I heard that his view was to bring about a\r\n_modus vivendi_ only, under which the Conservative Government was to be\r\nturned out on some side-issue. Mr. Gladstone would become Prime Minister\r\nfor the fourth time, if the Irish would consent to take Local Government\r\nand a Land Bill first, and to leave Home Rule over. He thought that Mr.\r\nGladstone was not unwilling, but that there would be difficulty in\r\ngetting the Irish to consent. Morley and Harcourt were, according to\r\nChamberlain, friendly to his suggestions, and Hartington hostile, not\r\ntrusting Mr. Gladstone.'\r\n\r\nOn January 15th, 1887, Sir Charles wrote to Mr. Chesson [Footnote: See\r\nnote, p. 273.] that\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain and Morley were both going to make conciliatory\r\n    speeches, but that nothing had really been done at Harcourt's house,\r\n    every difficulty having been \"reserved.\" There could be no doubt\r\n    that several of the five who were there meeting were anxious to keep\r\n    things open, on the chance of Mr. Gladstone not remaining in\r\n    sufficiently good health to continue to lead the party. The\r\n    independent Liberals were vexed at the Conferences. Willy Bright\r\n    called on me, and said that obviously the great difficulty of the\r\n    moment was \"to keep Mr. Gladstone in the Gladstonian party.\" Morley,\r\n    who also called on me, casually observed, \"Harcourt was never a Home\r\n    Ruler. The only Home Rulers in the last Cabinet were Lord Granville\r\n    and Spencer, in addition to myself and Mr. Gladstone.\" When we\r\n    remember the views of Spencer in May, 1885, his violent Home Rule,\r\n    which dates from July, 1885, is laughable.'\r\n\r\n    'On the 15th I had a long and curious conversation with Chamberlain\r\n    about the matter. He said that the articles which had been appearing\r\n    in the _Birmingham Post_ about his own position were inspired by\r\n    him--that he and the other members of the Conference were telling\r\n    the newspapers that everything was going on swimmingly, but that the\r\n    whole thing was in reality a sham on both sides. Parnell was\r\n    frightened at Mr. Gladstone's declining health, and Mr. Gladstone\r\n    did not wish to end his life by having smashed his party, so that\r\n    the Conference was willingly continued, although it was doing\r\n    nothing. It was the wish of all concerned in it to be at the point\r\n    of an apparent reconciliation whenever Mr. Gladstone might become\r\n    incapacitated, but he, Chamberlain, was firmly decided not to take\r\n    office under Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain said that Randolph Churchill on the previous night had\r\n    asked him, \"Shall I come over?\" but that he, Chamberlain, had\r\n    replied that he advised him not to, being afraid that Randolph would\r\n    play for the lead of the party, and not liking the notion of having\r\n    him for leader. He had advised Randolph to simulate moderation\r\n    towards Lord Salisbury, in spite of his anger at the Duke of Norfolk\r\n    and the members of the Conservative party who, since his quarrel\r\n    with the Government, had been \"attacking his private character.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On February 4th, 1887, Chamberlain again came to see me, and I\r\n    noted in my diary that he was \"very sore against Labouchere and\r\n    others.\"\r\n\r\n    'On February 13th, Morley called and said that the Round Table\r\n    Conference was hopeless, although they were to meet at dinner on the\r\n    14th, and once again after that. He said, \"Both sides are very\r\n    cross, and each side asks, 'What is to become of the other?'\"\r\n\r\n    'On the same day Chance, M.P., told me, he being the attorney of the\r\n    Nationalist party, that O'Shea was going forward with his divorce\r\n    case against Parnell, and that Parnell had no defence possible. I\r\n    have never known what was the reason of the immense delays which\r\n    afterwards occurred.'\r\n\r\nParties now began to settle into their new groupings.\r\n\r\n    'On March 2nd, 1887, Chamberlain came to lunch, and told me a good\r\n    deal about the failure of the Round Table Conference, but it was not\r\n    till April 3rd that he told me the whole story. On this latter day\r\n    Deakin, the Chief Secretary of Victoria, and most interesting of\r\n    Colonists, was with me; and Chamberlain came in before Deakin had\r\n    gone, and, talking with his customary frankness, discussed the whole\r\n    matter before the astonished Victorian. There had been a sad split\r\n    caused by a letter which he had written, and which he admitted was\r\n    an indiscreet one, to the _Baptist_, as to Welsh Disestablishment. A\r\n    hint was then let fall that the Gladstonians were going to negotiate\r\n    with Hartington direct. On this Chamberlain went off to Hartington\r\n    and got from him a letter to say that Hartington would not negotiate\r\n    himself, but that Chamberlain was in possession of his views.\r\n    Efforts were then made to get Chamberlain to meet Mr. Gladstone.\r\n    Chamberlain agreed to do so, but not to ask for the meeting. At\r\n    length a meeting was fixed at Mr. Gladstone's request for the\r\n    morrow, Monday, April 4th. It was settled that at this Mr. Gladstone\r\n    would ask what Chamberlain had to propose. Chamberlain was going to\r\n    reply that Mr. Gladstone knew his views, and to then ask whether\r\n    they were accepted, and he knew perfectly that nothing would come of\r\n    it. He had on the same day, April 3rd, met Randolph at Mrs. Jeune's\r\n    at lunch. They had walked away together, when Randolph had proposed\r\n    a Chamberlain-Hartington-Randolph league against both parties. This\r\n    had tempted Chamberlain, but was an idle suggestion, as Hartington\r\n    and Randolph could never work together.'\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1887 Sir Charles and Lady Dilke went to Constantinople,\r\nand he writes:\r\n\r\n    'I had received at this time a letter from James, in which he said\r\n    that Mr. Gladstone had sent for him to talk to him about me in the\r\n    friendliest way, and, Mr. Gladstone having called, I wrote to him,\r\n    and transmitted some messages from the Sultan, in the following\r\n    letter:\r\n\r\n    \"Athens,\r\n    \"_October 14th_.\r\n\r\n    '\"I have never thanked you except verbally through James for a kind\r\n    and pleasant message which I had from you by James and Chamberlain\r\n    last session.\r\n\r\n    '\"At Constantinople last Friday, and again to Lady Dilke last\r\n    Monday, the Sultan said that he wished complimentary messages\r\n    conveyed to you. The Greek Patriarch said the same thing to us on\r\n    Tuesday and Wednesday. My wife told both that she hardly knew you,\r\n    and I replied that I was unlikely to see you for some time, but\r\n    would see that the messages reached you.\r\n\r\n    '\"The Greeks on the one hand, and the Bulgarians on the other, are\r\n    now very friendly with the Sultan, but I regret to find that the\r\n    dislike between the Greeks and the Bulgarians is as strong as ever.\r\n    The common preference of both for the Sultan over Russia has not\r\n    sufficed to draw them together. The split between the Bulgarian\r\n    Government and the Exarch of Bulgaria will, however, probably draw\r\n    Bulgaria closer to the Phanar.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone replied, on October 24th, that his message to Sir Charles\r\nexpressed his real feeling, which he should have been glad to find other\r\nmodes of expressing. He added that if the Sultan spoke sincerely in the\r\nmessage which Sir Charles transmitted,\r\n\r\n    'he must be acting as a good Christian: for Hobart Pasha when here,\r\n    as a spy on Fehmi, told me the Sultan believed I was his greatest\r\n    enemy. I have never been so great an enemy to him as he to himself.\r\n    I have never had extreme views about Turkey. Had I the settling of\r\n    the affair, I should be disposed to keep the Turks in\r\n    Constantinople, and not to let Home Rule when freely and honestly\r\n    given mean total severance. But the materials of convulsion are, I\r\n    fear, slowly gathering in that quarter, and Russia, shut out from\r\n    her just claim to the passage of the Straits, means to have the\r\n    mastery of them. I always grieve over the feud of Hellene and Slav,\r\n    out of which much mischief may come. The situation here is\r\n    favourable to those who view the Irish Question as you do. The\r\n    relations with Chamberlain have been rather painful. I think he has\r\n    developed since the schism of March, 1886, even greater speaking and\r\n    debating talents than he had shown before. I think also that the\r\n    organization of dissentient Liberalism, in which he has borne so\r\n    large a part, has been enormously favourable to his general creed as\r\n    an advanced Radical, whereas Hartington with his weak-kneed men has\r\n    been utterly hoodwinked, and hoodwinked by himself. On the other\r\n    hand, I own myself amazed at Chamberlain's proceedings during the\r\n    last month. Everyone took a favourable view of his accepting the\r\n    American mission; [Footnote: Mr. Chamberlain was corresponding with\r\n    Sir Charles in regard to his mission, for which he started on\r\n    October 29th, 1887. It had for its object the negotiation of a\r\n    treaty with America on several outstanding questions.] but a man of\r\n    one-tenth of his talent ought to have seen the folly of widening\r\n    breaches and exasperating all passions as a preliminary to charging\r\n    himself with a business that eminently requires a serene atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    'We witnessed at Nottingham an enthusiasm literally the greatest I\r\n    have ever seen.'\r\n\r\n    'On my return to England before the middle of November, 1887, I\r\n    received a letter from the Cinderford Liberal Association, in the\r\n    Forest of Dean, in which they referred to an attempt which had been\r\n    made to induce me to stand for the Forest of Dean when Blake retired\r\n    in July, 1887, and went on to press me to go there to speak....\r\n    After the completion of the army articles and of the book, I\r\n    intended to set to work on a new version of my _Greater Britain_.\r\n    This afterwards became the book published under the title of\r\n    _Problems of Greater Britain_.'\r\n\r\nOn October 28th, 1887, 'Chamberlain wrote ... \"Mr. Gladstone's last\r\nspeech shows distinct signs of old age. I think matters cannot long\r\nremain in their present state, and the whole policy of England--both\r\nforeign and domestic--may be greatly altered.\"'\r\n\r\nOn reaching Washington, Chamberlain wrote: 'I do not find the \"civilized\r\nworld\" so much pro-Irish as Mr. Gladstone would have us believe. On the\r\ncontrary, I have as yet only met two Americans who have expressed\r\nthemselves favourable to Mr. Gladstone's policy. They are, generally\r\nspeaking, inclined to some concession in the direction of State rights,\r\nbut they are entirely opposed to anything in the nature of a self-\r\ngoverning colony, and they have no personal liking for the Irish. Above\r\nall, they are horrified at Mr. Gladstone's recent utterances about law\r\nand order, and say openly that he must have lost his head.'\r\n\r\n    'On January 4th, 1888, I made a speech in which I laid down my\r\n    position as regarded Parliamentary candidature. It was made in\r\n    presiding at the first dinner of the Hammersmith Central Liberal\r\n    Club. About the same time I received requests to stand as candidate\r\n    for Merthyr and for the northern division of the borough of West\r\n    Ham, which I declined, pointing to my Hammersmith speech without\r\n    giving further reasons.'\r\n\r\n    'About this time, my son being now at Rugby, we went down to see him\r\n    and lunched with the Percivals.'\r\n\r\nIn the new session of 1888 Mr. Ritchie introduced his Local Government\r\nBill, which (as Sir Charles had predicted to the Chelsea electors in\r\n1885) was much influenced by the Liberal scheme that lay accessible in\r\nan official pigeonhole. The outline given by the new President of the\r\nLocal Government Board in introducing the measure showed, however, that\r\nit fell short of expectation, and Sir Charles immediately criticized the\r\nproject in an evening paper without waiting for publication of the text.\r\nWhen the Bill was published, he issued notes upon it, in concert with\r\nMr. Cobb, M.P. for the Rugby Division, condemning the absence of any\r\nattempt to 'reform and revivify the parish.'\r\n\r\n    'My main objection to Mr. Ritchie's scheme was that, whereas in my\r\n    scheme the District Councils had been more highly organized than the\r\n    County Councils, in his scheme the reverse was the case. [Footnote:\r\n    The allusion is here, apparently, to the Bill which Mr. Chamberlain\r\n    prepared in 1886, but with considerable help from Sir Charles.]\r\n    There was no building up out of the smaller districts, giving the\r\n    work as far as possible to the smallest, where the people were at\r\n    their homes; but Mr. Ritchie's unit was the county, and the smaller\r\n    bodies were neglected.\r\n\r\n    'The Liberal leaders took a short-sighted course in recommending\r\n    their friends to allow the Bill to pass almost without discussion.'\r\n    [Footnote: In 1892 he again notes his intervention on this question.\r\n    'On November 9th, 1892, I had a long interview at the Local\r\n    Government Board with Henry Fowler, the President, at his request,\r\n    before I went down to the Chelsea Board of Guardians for the last\r\n    time. He consulted me as to all his Bills, especially as to that on\r\n    Local Government.']\r\n\r\nThere were, however, friends who considered that the new institutions\r\nestablished by Mr. Ritchie's Act opened a way back into public life for\r\nSir Charles. Among these was Mr. Chamberlain. He was, as usual,\r\ncorresponding with Sir Charles, during his absence abroad, on all\r\nmatters, and an interesting letter is noted here.\r\n\r\n    'In, I think, May, 1888, while we were at Royal, I received a letter\r\n    from Chamberlain in which he indicated a change in his views upon\r\n    the South Africa question. Ultimately he completely turned round\r\n    from his old position, which was violently anti-Dutch, and, like\r\n    everyone else, fell into line upon the principle of the fusion of\r\n    race interests in South Africa.'\r\n\r\n    'On our return Chamberlain came down to Dockett and spent the\r\n    afternoon, bringing Austen with him, and very strongly urged that\r\n    the time had now come when I should stand for Parliament. I said\r\n    that I thought that the time would come, but that, after India, I\r\n    had _Problems of Greater Britain_ to write before I thought about\r\n    it. He then urged that I should stand for the County Council in my\r\n    absence in India, and as to this point a great difference of opinion\r\n    arose, I being inclined to accept his advice, which was also very\r\n    strongly pressed upon me by my former colleague Firth; my wife and\r\n    G. W. Osborn strongly took the opposite view, to which I yielded. I\r\n    afterwards came to think it had been the right view. Chamberlain\r\n    pressed his opinion very hotly to the last. I received a deputation\r\n    from Fulham which represented the entire Liberal and a portion of\r\n    the Conservative party, and the seat would certainly have been won;\r\n    but I declined, and Chamberlain then wrote: \"You must be the judge,\r\n    and are probably the best one. But I yield reluctantly.\"'\r\n\r\nThis decision was made public in answer to the Fulham deputation just\r\nbefore Sir Charles started on a journey to India.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1889, after his return to England, he was confronted with a\r\nnew proposal. The Progressive party now in power on the London County\r\nCouncil desired to put him forward as one of the first Aldermen. Sir\r\nCharles refused; but a preliminary circular in reference to his\r\ncandidature had been issued, and a protest was immediately organized by\r\nthe section which desired his permanent ostracism. This opposition was\r\nthen formidable in its proportions, and it never wholly disappeared. It\r\nwas, however, increasingly clear that a much stronger body of public\r\nopinion desired his return to public and Parliamentary life.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1889, he was elected Honorary President of the Liberal Four\r\nHundred in the Forest of Dean. The election did not pass without\r\nchallenge, and one of the objectors was the Rector of Newent (Canon\r\nWood). Sir Charles sent this clergyman the papers in the divorce case,\r\nwhich had been collected by Mr. Chesson [Footnote: Mr. Chesson had died\r\nearlier in this year; and the token of Sir Charles Dilke's gratitude to\r\nthis defender of unpopular causes is commemorated in the High-Altar of\r\nHoly Trinity Church, Upper Chelsea, which he presented in memory of his\r\nfriend. Sir Charles wrote: 'He had been for many years a useful man in\r\npolitics, and he was to me at this period a very precious friend; one of\r\nthe best and truest men I ever knew; he had been the most helpful man in\r\nEngland to the anti-slavery cause of the Northern Abolitionists, the\r\nworking man of the Jamaica Committee, and, many years afterwards, of the\r\nEastern Question Association, and of the Greek Committee; and since his\r\ndeath no one has taken his place.'] and his associates, and a study of\r\nthem turned the Rector of Newent into a strong supporter of the man whom\r\nhe had at first denounced.\r\n\r\nDilke's first visit to the Forest of Dean took place in May, 1889. By\r\nthis time it was clear that his absence from Parliament could be\r\nterminated at his own pleasure. Mr. Gladstone had intervened almost\r\nofficially in the matter. In June, 1889, he again sent for Sir Henry\r\nJames, who transmitted the purport of his talk: which was that, while\r\nMr. Gladstone was most anxious to see Sir Charles back, his opinion was\r\nthat steps should not be too quickly taken. Sir Henry thought that Mr.\r\nGladstone would willingly give his opinion and advice if Sir Charles\r\nthought that would be of any value to him. A few weeks later Mr.\r\nGladstone called at 76, Sloane Street, but missed Sir Charles.\r\n\r\n    'In August he wrote to me in regard to his correspondence with\r\n    James. The most important passage in the letter was:\r\n\r\n    '\"I deeply feel the loss we sustain in your absence from public\r\n    life, after you had given such varied and conclusive proof of high\r\n    capacity to serve your country; and I have almost taken it for\r\n    granted that with the end of this Parliament, after anything\r\n    approaching the usual full term, the ostracism could die a kind of\r\n    natural death. And I heartily wish and hope that you may have lying\r\n    before you a happy period of public usefulness.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was in no hurry. Another invitation had reached him, from\r\nDundee, and 'on November 4th a unanimous request to contest the borough\r\nof Fulham.'\r\n\r\nBut his determination was to let nothing interrupt the work on his book;\r\nafter that, various promises both of writing and speaking had to be\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he remained in touch with the political world. 'I carried on a\r\ncontroversy with Labouchere about his views in favour of reforming the\r\nHouse of Lords, to which I was bitterly opposed, preferring, if we could\r\nnot get rid of it, to go on as we are.' All Labouchere's letters were\r\nfull of references to the position of Chamberlain, and Chamberlain\r\nhimself came from time to time to discuss that point.\r\n\r\n    'On December 2nd, 1889, I saw Chamberlain. On October 10th he had\r\n    told me that he was clear that ultimately he should join the\r\n    Conservatives, unless Mr. Gladstone were soon to go and a\r\n    Rosebery-Harcourt combination would come to terms with him about\r\n    Ulster. On December 2nd I found a little change back from his\r\n    general attitude, and in face of the probable break-up of the\r\n    Parnellite party over the O'Shea case, which was beginning to be\r\n    talked of in detail, Chamberlain was undecided, he said, and no\r\n    doubt thought, between the two parties. But I noted in my diary:\r\n    \"Labouchere sets him against the Liberals, and Balfour attracts him\r\n    to the Tories.\" It was clear that I thought that the change was but\r\n    a temporary one, and that he was certain to return to his attitude\r\n    of October, as in fact he did.'\r\n\r\n_Problems of Greater Britain_ appeared at the end of January, 1890, and\r\nwithin a month the edition was exhausted. In America, Sir Charles,\r\nexpecting censure, had arranged to reply in the _North American Review_\r\nto his censors; but there was so little adverse comment that he chose\r\nanother subject.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of military problems abounded in the book, but the 'Problems'\r\ntreated were by no means only those which concerned military experts.\r\nMr. Deakin wrote:\r\n\r\n    'It will not merely be the one book treating authoritatively of the\r\n    Empire, and the one book making it known to Britons in Europe, but\r\n    it will also be the first book enabling the various groups of\r\n    colonies to understand each other, and their individual relation to\r\n    the whole of which they form a part.... Knowing some of the\r\n    difficulties you encountered ... I have been completely amazed at\r\n    the skill or the intuition with which you have caught the right tone\r\n    of local colours and the true tendency of our political and social\r\n    life.'\r\n\r\n    'On July 23rd, 1890, I lunched with McArthur [Footnote: Mr. W. A.\r\n    McArthur, Liberal Whip and member of Parliament, who had made Sir\r\n    Charles's acquaintance in 1886, and become a warm personal friend.]\r\n    to meet Schnadhorst, who had returned from South Africa, and who\r\n    warmly pressed my standing at the General Election, and I allowed\r\n    myself to be persuaded so far as to promise that I would consider\r\n    the matter in connection with the offer of any first-rate seat.'\r\n\r\nDifferent constituencies were mentioned; but in the following October,\r\nwhen it became known that the then member for the Forest of Dean would\r\nnot stand again, Mr. Schnadhorst wrote at once to Sir Charles urging him\r\nto let his name be put forward. He added, as an indication of the\r\ngeneral feeling, that the adjacent constituency of South Monmouthshire\r\nhad also sent in a request for Sir Charles's services--'which should\r\nassure you that popular support will overwhelm any other influence.'\r\nAccordingly, at the end of this year Sir Charles saw a deputation of\r\nleading men from the Forest, and fixed a date on which he would give a\r\nreply to a formal invitation. Having spent Christmas in his house at\r\nToulon, he returned thence in February, 1891, met a further deputation,\r\nand agreed to give his public reply in the Forest in March.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1890, Chamberlain had concurred in the decision that,\r\nbefore Dilke accepted any candidature, there should be published a\r\ndigest of the case with annotation and with the new evidence, 'which had\r\ngrown up out of Chesson's notes, and which was largely the work of Howel\r\nThomas, Clarence Smith, Steavenson, and McArthur. This was published in\r\nFebruary, 1891, on my return.' [Footnote: In 1886 he had written: 'In\r\nthe course of this winter a committee of friends of mine, got together\r\nby Chesson, and containing Steavenson (afterwards Judge Steavenson), and\r\nHowel Thomas of the Local Government Board, but also containing W. A.\r\nMcArthur, M.P., Clarence Smith, ex-Sheriff of London and Middlesex,\r\nafterwards M.P., and Canon MacColl, who were mere acquaintances, or\r\nless, had begun to investigate my case with a view of getting further\r\nevidence.']\r\n\r\n    'The Cinderford meeting (the central town of the Forest) on March\r\n    9th, 1891, was unanimous, and after it we remained chiefly in the\r\n    Forest of Dean for a long time. I had promised to give my final\r\n    reply in June. At the meeting of March I had only stated that if,\r\n    after all the attacks which might be made upon me, they should\r\n    remain in the same mind, I would accept.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles was fortunate in his new constituency. Throughout England\r\nthere was no other so suited to him; he desired contact with large\r\nbodies of labouring men, and the Forest made him a representative of\r\nthat great and typical British Labour group, the miners. He loved 'each\r\nsimple joy the country yields,' and, whereas almost everywhere else a\r\nmining district is scarred, defaced, and blackened, here pit-shafts were\r\nsunk into glades as beautiful as any park could show, forest stretches\r\nof oak and beech enveloped that ugliness in green and gold, and from\r\nmany a rising ground you might look over the broad vale where the wide\r\nSevern sweeps round a horseshoe curve and the little, unspoilt town of\r\nNewnham stands set in beauty, winter or summer.\r\n\r\nNewnham was dear to Sir Charles, and there he stayed for visits in\r\nwinter. But the place of his most frequent and prolonged abode in his\r\nconstituency was the Speech House, built in the very heart of the\r\nwoodland, remote from any town, yet at a centre of the communal life;\r\nfor outside it, on a wide space of sward, the Forest miners held their\r\nyearly meeting, their 'speech-day.' The miners' interest, which he\r\nrepresented, was not of recent growth, nor arising out of some great\r\nenterprise of capital; it linked itself with those rights of commonage\r\nof which he had always been a chief champion, and appealed not only to\r\nthe radical but to the antiquarian in him. The 'free miners' privileges\r\nmarked only one of many ancient customs in that Crown domain which he\r\nstudied and guarded.\r\n\r\nAs in 1867 and 1868 he had made it his business to be sure that the\r\nelectors whose votes he sought should know his opinions, so far as\r\npossible, not on one subject, but on all, so now in 1891, at his\r\nmeetings throughout the constituency, he unfolded the whole of his\r\npolitical faith.\r\n\r\nHe developed in speech after speech the views which he had put forward\r\nin _A Radical Programme_, published in 1890, and in a great speech at\r\nGlasgow on March 11th of that year. His views on Housing, as given in\r\nhis Glasgow speech and afterwards dealt with in his Forest campaign,\r\nshow how far he was in advance of the recommendations made in the Report\r\nof the Royal Commission on Housing of the Poor.\r\n\r\n    'As chairman of that Commission, I had to instruct the secretary\r\n    working with myself to draw such a report as would at least obtain a\r\n    majority upon the Commission, and we succeeded in drawing a report\r\n    that obtained a unanimity of votes; but, of course, to do so we had\r\n    to put forward the points in which we felt that many would concur,\r\n    and to keep out our most extreme suggestions. I personally would go\r\n    much farther, and would allow towns to build or hire or buy, and\r\n    would encourage them to solve the problem for themselves, and not\r\n    ask the State to help them, except by setting free their hands and\r\n    allowing them to obtain land cheaply and to tax themselves freely\r\n    for the purpose.... Gladly would I see towns armed with the powers\r\n    to destroy, without compensation, in extreme cases, filthy\r\n    dwellings, where it is proved to the satisfaction of the magistrates\r\n    that the owners are in fault, and the sites of such dwellings might\r\n    be obtained by a cheap process. In all cases we ought to give powers\r\n    to public bodies to take land for public purposes at a fair price\r\n    ... and by the adoption of the principle of betterment ... owners\r\n    would be called upon to make special contribution towards schemes\r\n    which would improve their property at large.'\r\n\r\nHe dwelt on the sufferings of the working classes owing to improvements\r\nwhich ejected them from their dwellings, and urged that the Local\r\nAuthority should in all cases come to terms as to rehousing before\r\ngranting any facilities for improvements.\r\n\r\nFor land he advocated taxation of unearned increment and fixity of\r\ntenure under fair rents fixed by judicial courts, with power to the\r\ncommunity to buy up land at its real price.\r\n\r\nHe also advocated, not only the limitation of hours of work, a principle\r\nto which he had been converted by the Industrial Remuneration Conference\r\nof 1885, but that the workers should be qualified for the enjoyment of\r\ntheir leisure by educational opportunities. He urged the example of\r\nSwitzerland in making education compulsory up to sixteen years of age,\r\nand that of Ontario in granting free education up to the age of\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nHe advocated municipal Socialism, by giving to municipalities the widest\r\npossible power to deal with local needs, and, passing from local\r\nexpenditure to that of the State, he dealt with the need for graduation\r\nof Imperial taxation, and urged the equalization of the death duties (as\r\nbetween real and personal estate) and making these duties progressive.\r\nHe would raise them gradually to 25 per cent. By such means we should\r\nattain the double purpose of raising money and discouraging the\r\npossession of large estates, which are the cause of the existence of a\r\ntoo numerous idle class.\r\n\r\nAdult suffrage and one man or woman, one vote, was always a part of his\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\nIn his utterances the change from individualism to collectivism is\r\nmarked. 'We were all Tory anarchists once,' he used to say in reviewing\r\neconomic theories of the sixties, and the change which had come over the\r\nattitude of economists to social questions. His own conversion was so\r\nthorough that in industrial questions he acted often as a pioneer, and\r\nhis constituency adopted his views on the limitation of hours by\r\nlegislation as in the demand for a legal eight-hour day. [Footnote:\r\nSpeeches in Forest of Dean and elsewhere (1890-1891). _Radical\r\nProgramme_, 1890.]\r\n\r\nHe had laid it down as a condition of acceptance of the candidature for\r\nthe Forest that there must be 'full and absolute belief' in him and in\r\nhis word. Time was given for the personal attack to develop, and it was\r\nmade by pamphlet propaganda with unsparing virulence, but entirely\r\nwithout result. Not a dozen Liberals in the division declared themselves\r\naffected by it; and 'on June 11th, 1891, I gave my consent to stand for\r\nParliament at a meeting held at Lydney, which was extraordinarily\r\nsuccessful and unanimous.'\r\n\r\nThe chair was taken by Mr. Thomas Blake, who had been member for the\r\ndivision, and who in the darkest hour of Sir Charles's political life\r\nhad come forward with a proposal to resign and make way for him. He was\r\nthere now to say that, if Sir Charles would stand, he himself would act\r\nas unpaid election agent. On the platform were all the leading Liberals\r\nof the Forest, among them Canon Wood of Newent, whose opposition had\r\nbeen turned into strenuous advocacy. There also was 'Mabon' to speak for\r\nhimself and the Welsh miners, and from the outside world Mr. Reginald\r\nMcKenna, an inseparable friend. Sir Charles's speech, which he counted\r\nto have been the best of his life, dealt briefly with the leading\r\npolitical topics of the day--Home Rule and the Radical programme--but\r\nsoon passed to the personal issue. He recalled the change from the murky\r\ndreariness of March to the height of summer loveliness which reigned\r\nabout them, and the change no less great in the moral atmosphere. He\r\nreviewed the history of the attacks that had been made, the avowed\r\ndetermination to prevent his being their member; and at the close he\r\ndeclared himself satisfied that their trust was fully his. 'My\r\nconditions have been fulfilled. I accept the confidence you have reposed\r\nin me. I trust that strength may be given to me to justify that\r\nconfidence, and I reply--not for a day, nor for a year, but from this\r\nday forward, for better for worse; and thereto I plight my troth.\r\nTo-morrow we go forth from among you and commit our honour to your\r\ncharge.'\r\n\r\nHe was justified in the confidence which he reposed in them. One attempt\r\nwas made to raise the personal issue against him; and its result showed\r\nthat any man would be imprudent who sought to oppose Sir Charles Dilke\r\nin the Forest of Dean except on strictly political grounds. First and\r\nlast no member of Parliament ever got more loyal support; but no man\r\never trusted less to personal popularity. He carefully developed the\r\nwhole electoral machinery. The month which he spent every autumn in the\r\nForest was very largely a month of work on the detail of registration,\r\nand the register as he caused it to be kept might be put forward as an\r\nexample of perfection unapproached elsewhere in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    'A day or two afterwards I received at a public meeting at Chelsea\r\n    Town Hall an address signed by 11,000 inhabitants of Chelsea,\r\n    congratulating me on my return to public life. It was signed by\r\n    persons on both sides of politics. In reply, I made another good\r\n    speech; but it was a great occasion.'\r\n\r\nAmong the letters which reached him from all quarters was one from Sir\r\nHenry Parkes, who wrote:\r\n\r\n    'Chief Secretary, New South Wales,\r\n    'Sydney, _March 9th_, 1891.\r\n\r\n    'I still hold the belief that few men have before them a broader\r\n    path of honourable usefulness than you. May you succeed in nobly\r\n    serving the dear old country!'\r\n\r\nHe received now and henceforward many invitations to address labouring\r\nmen, especially from the miners of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAt Cannock Chase, in August, 1890, he attended his first miners'\r\nmeeting. How rapidly the list increased may be judged by the fact that,\r\nspeaking in July, 1891, at Ilkeston, he alluded to his conferences with\r\nminers of Yorkshire, of Lancashire, of Cheshire, Somerset,\r\nGloucestershire, Monmouthshire, Staffordshire, and the Swansea and Neath\r\ndistricts in England and Wales, and of Fife and Ayrshire in Scotland.\r\nAttempts had not been wanting to stimulate against him the strong\r\npuritanism of these people, especially in South Wales; the answer had\r\ncome from men like Tom Ellis, [Footnote: Mr. Thomas E. Ellis was a\r\nLiberal Whip at this time.] who brought him to address the quarrymen of\r\nBlaenau Festiniog, or like Mabon--William Abraham--miner, bard, and\r\norator, who organized a gigantic torchlight procession of his own\r\nconstituents in the Rhondda Valley to welcome Sir Charles and Lady\r\nDilke, and who, at Lydney, when Sir Charles finally accepted their\r\ninvitation, congratulated the Forest of Dean on having secured the\r\nservices of 'one who was not only a political leader, but a real Labour\r\nleader.'\r\n\r\nParliamentary action in favour of an Eight Hours Bill formed the burden\r\nof Sir Charles's discourse at all these meetings. Accepting a special\r\ninvitation to the annual conference of miners in the beginning of 1892,\r\nhe dealt with the proposal, then strongly advocated, of a general\r\ninternational strike, pointing out that this measure 'should not be even\r\ntalked about until they had seen the exhaustion of all other means of\r\nobtaining what they wanted.' It meant civil war; would 'disorganize the\r\nwhole economic condition of the country and the trade of the Empire, and\r\nproduce also a great feeling of exasperation between classes.' He\r\npressed them to consider whether, in the event of such an international\r\nconflict, the whole brunt would not fall on Great Britain. In Belgium\r\nand in France there was no such strength of organization as among them;\r\nand a general strike succeeding in Great Britain, but failing on the\r\nContinent, would be a national danger. He proposed, as an alternative,\r\nco-operation with the British representatives of other trades, for whom\r\nalso Parliamentary interference was demanded. In the discussion which\r\nfollowed, the weight of his argument was fully recognized, and a\r\nresolution favouring the international strike was amended into one\r\ncalling for Parliamentary action.\r\n\r\nIn the following June Sir Charles Dilke attended the Miners'\r\nInternational Congress, and spoke at the banquet given to foreign\r\ndelegates. A month later, when the General Election came on, 'thousands\r\nof handbills and posters,' says Mr. Thomas Ashton, 'were sent to the\r\nForest of Dean by our federation recommending the workers to vote for\r\nthe working man's candidate.'\r\n\r\nNor were his public utterances on Labour questions limited to Great\r\nBritain; request came from a society of the Belgian economists for a\r\nlecture on some subject connected with Greater Britain, and he chose the\r\nAustralian strike and the position of Labour in the Colonies. This\r\ndiscourse was delivered by Sir Charles in Brussels on his way back from\r\nFrance at the beginning of 1891, and he then, he says, 'made the\r\nacquaintance of all the leading people on both sides in that city.'\r\n\r\nAs early as May, 1891, Dilke had made up his mind (and stated it in a\r\nletter to Count Herbert Bismarck) that the Liberal party would win the\r\nnext election. The question of the Leadership was raised at the end of\r\nthe session in a letter from Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n    'I am told that Mr. Gladstone is much shaken by his late illness,\r\n    and I cannot see how he can ever lead the House again, though his\r\n    name will always be a tower of strength in the constituencies.'\r\n\r\nBut in December Mr. Chamberlain said that he did not think the prospects\r\nof a General Election were so good for Mr. Gladstone as they had been\r\nsix months ago.\r\n\r\n    'James, dining at my house, had said a long time before this that\r\n    the prospects of the Liberals might look rosy, but that they had not\r\n    realized the extent to which the Liberal Unionists intended to spend\r\n    their money upon Labour candidates;' and this danger 'began to show\r\n    itself more clearly about this time.' On December 28th 'I had an\r\n    amusing letter from Cyril Flower:\r\n\r\n    '\"Surely for a real good muddle in political affairs, Welsh, Irish,\r\n    Scotch, and English, there has never been a bigger, and what with\r\n    Pamellites and anti-Parnellites (Christian and anti-Christian)\r\n    Whigs, Labour candidates, Radicals, Tories, Jacobites, and Liberal\r\n    Unionists, the next House will be as rum a kettle of fish as ever\r\n    stewed since George III. The worst of it is, as the House gets more\r\n    and more divided (like the French Chambers) into sets, it also\r\n    becomes more and more incapable of getting through its business, and\r\n    the littleness of the individual members becomes daily more\r\n    apparent.\"'\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty for the Liberals was, however, the question of\r\nleadership; and Sir Charles wrote an article in the _Speaker_ [Footnote:\r\nSeptember 5th, 1891.] in support of one of his few paradoxes--that Great\r\nBritain would be better off without a Second Chamber, but that, given a\r\nHouse of Lords, the Prime Minister should be a member of it. For this\r\nreason he urged that though, 'when the moment has come for Mr. Gladstone\r\nto think that he has earned a change into the position of adviser from\r\nthat of military chief, Sir William Harcourt will occupy the place he\r\npleases to assume--he will be able to make himself Prime Minister if he\r\nchooses'--yet 'the party would be strongest with Mr. Gladstone for\r\nadviser, Sir William Harcourt, as fighting chief, sharing the\r\nresponsibility with the leader in the Lords more fully than he would if\r\nhe were Prime Minister in the Lower House'; and he named Lord Spencer as\r\npossible Prime Minister, since Lord Rosebery should be Foreign\r\nSecretary, and the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister should not be\r\nthe same man, 'so heavy is the work of each of these two offices.'\r\n\r\nWith the opening of 1892 Parliament entered on its sixth, and last,\r\nsession, and 'on April 1st I received a letter from Chamberlain, in\r\nwhich he said:\r\n\r\n    '\"My own firm conviction is that parties will be nearly divided, and\r\n    if Mr. G. has a majority nothing will be done either in regard to\r\n    Ireland or to social questions in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    '\"I do not _expect_ the election till late in the autumn, and,\r\n    judging from appearances, the Opposition are much divided and rather\r\n    depressed in spirit. My prediction is that, unless the Gladstonians\r\n    give up the idea of a separate Parliament (I do not say extended\r\n    local government), they will not obtain power--though they may\r\n    obtain office--for this generation.\r\n\r\n    '\"This is a bold prophecy for you, but it is my sincere opinion.\"'\r\n\r\nRight essentially--for there was a very small Liberal majority--Mr.\r\nChamberlain was wrong on the point of date: the election came in July,\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nIn the Forest proper, the local war-chant, 'Yaller for iver, an' Blue in\r\nthe river!' was shouted everywhere. But the constituency, 'a microcosm\r\nof England, industrial and agricultural,' as Sir Charles had called it,\r\nhad districts where support of the 'working man's candidate' could only\r\nbe whispered; where closed hands were furtively opened to show a\r\nmarigold clasped in them; where perhaps, as a farmer's trap drove by\r\ncarrying voters to the poll, the voters, outwardly blue-ribboned, would\r\nopen their coats a little and show where the yellow was pinned. Lady\r\nDilke on polling-day took charge of these districts. Yellow flowers from\r\nevery garden were heaped into her carriage as she passed; and when votes\r\ncame to be counted, more than one had been spoilt by too enthusiastic\r\nvotaries who wrote across their paper, 'For Lady Dilke.' Her courage and\r\ndevotion had touched the loyalty of the Forest people, and she received\r\nfrom them a tribute of genuine love. One who accompanied her tells of a\r\nlater day when, after a terrible mine accident, Lady Dilke came down to\r\nvisit the homes on which that blow had fallen. In one a young widow sat\r\nstaring dry-eyed at the fire or turning tearless looks on the child that\r\nplayed near her. But when Lady Dilke entered, the woman rose from her\r\nchair, and, running to her visitor, put her arms about her neck, and as\r\nthe two held each other, tears came at last.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke was returned by a majority of two to one, and, he\r\nwrites laconically, 'in August was well received in the House of\r\nCommons.'\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Sir Charles had expressed some surprise at hostile comment in\r\nthe _Times_ and other important organs on his selection as candidate for\r\nthe Forest of Dean, and Mr. Chamberlain told him candidly that opinion\r\nin society and in the House itself was hostile to his candidature, and\r\nthat he must look forward to a 'mauvais quart d'heure.' But it was\r\notherwise. After his election there appears to have been a general\r\nexpectation that he would be silent, and keep out of the range of\r\nhostile criticism. As a fact, he fell directly into his old habit of\r\nraising every subject which interested him. Parliament met again on\r\nJanuary 31st, 1893, and as soon as notice of questions could be given,\r\nSir Charles was reviving interest in a subject familiar to him of old,\r\nby asking the new Liberal Government to issue papers which had been\r\nomitted from the official publications of France and Great Britain, but\r\nhad been published in the Madagascar Red Book.\r\n\r\nAmongst congratulations on his election came one from the Prime Minister\r\nat Antananarivo, rejoicing that the threatened freedom of Madagascar\r\nwould again have his support, and transmitting the Red Book just named.\r\nWithin the first week of the session Sir Charles had questioned\r\nGovernment about the arbitration as to the Newfoundland fisheries; and\r\nconcerning a vacancy in the Bombay command, with inquiry as to whether\r\namalgamation of the Indian armies would be considered [Footnote: The\r\namalgamation of the Indian armies was achieved by abolition, in 1894, of\r\nthe separate military commands of the Presidencies.]--a change which he\r\nhad long advocated. He also reappeared in a different field, but one\r\nfamiliar to him, by introducing a Bill to amend the system of voting in\r\nlocal elections. Then, on February 11th, while the Address to the Crown\r\nwas still under discussion, he took part in a full-dress debate.\r\n\r\nMr. James Lowther, the leading Protectionist of days when Protection was\r\nnot a fashionable creed, proposed an amendment seeking to restrict the\r\nimmigration of destitute aliens; and he found a seconder in a trade-\r\nunionist, Mr. Havelock Wilson, who spoke for the seamen. After Mr.\r\nGladstone had argued strongly against the proposal, but had shown his\r\nperception of the widespread support which it received by expressing\r\nwillingness to appoint a committee of inquiry, Sir Charles Dilke rose,\r\nand, claiming to speak for a small minority, opposed legislation and\r\ncommittee alike.\r\n\r\nThe force of his appeal to the House lay in the description which he\r\ngave of persecution directed against the Jews in Russia, coupled with\r\ncitation of many previous instances in which England had afforded\r\nasylum, and had gained both advantage and respect by so doing. First-\r\nhand knowledge of Russian conditions and detailed mastery of the\r\nhistorical case were combined in what one of the more important speakers\r\nfor the motion (Sir William Marriott) called a 'magnificent speech'; and\r\nSir Charles himself observes that it turned many votes. Mr. Mundella\r\nwrote to him after the debate: 'I think it was the best I ever heard\r\nfrom you, and, moreover, was courageous and just.'\r\n\r\nMr. Mundella was no doubt struck by the fact that a man coming in, as\r\nSir Charles did, specially dependent on the support of organized Labour,\r\nhad in his first speech combated the view of Labour interests which was\r\nput forward by trade-unionists. Sir Charles's reply to the trade-\r\nunionists ran thus: If these aliens come to England, they very often\r\njoin trade-unions, and so accept the higher standard; if they do not,\r\nthe products of their work come in and compete even more disastrously.\r\nFrom this there lay an argument against Free Trade, and this he\r\ncharacteristically admitted. Free Trade was only a balance of\r\nadvantages, and Labour politicians, he pointed out, considered that the\r\narguments against it were outweighed by countervailing considerations.\r\nTo exclude the immigrants and not to exclude the products of their\r\nlabour would be inconsistent, and also it would lower the nation's\r\nstandard of humanity.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session he spoke again on the qualifications for membership\r\nof local elective bodies, and incidentally condemned the proposed\r\nMinistry of Labour as 'a sham remedy.' [Footnote: See \"Labour,\" Chapter\r\nLII., pp. 347, 348.] Not to create new Ministries, but to reorganize and\r\nredistribute their work, was his policy, advocated repeatedly both in\r\nthe House of Commons and from the chair of the Statistical Society. He\r\nspoke also on redistribution in this session, and these speeches were\r\n'successful in their business way. Thus I regained influence of a quiet\r\nsort.'\r\n\r\n    'For the first time' (1893) 'I dined at the Speaker's third dinner,\r\n    or \"dinner of the discontented.\" The first dinner each year is to\r\n    the Government, the second to the late Government, and the third to\r\n    the Privy Councillors who were not of either of the others, and to a\r\n    few other leading members. Little Northcote was on the Speaker's\r\n    left, parted only by the Speaker from Randolph. I was opposite,\r\n    reflecting, whenever Jim Lowther would leave off slapping me on the\r\n    back.'\r\n\r\nOn January 29th, 1893, Sir Charles noted in his diary:\r\n\r\n    'There is a league between Harcourt and Labouchere against the\r\n    Rosebery-Asquith combination. Labouchere showed me a letter from\r\n    Harcourt: \"Hell would be pleasant compared to the present\r\n    situation.\"'\r\n\r\n    'On my return to the House of Commons,' notes Sir Charles, 'I found\r\n    Chamberlain's debating power marvellous, but, while his method has\r\n    improved, it ... no longer carries the conviction of conviction with\r\n    it, which, to me, is everything.\r\n\r\n    'Asquith is the only new man who is \"any good\"--a bold, strong man,\r\n    of great intellectual power. Sir E. Grey is able, but terribly\r\n    Whiggish. Hanbury has improved, and so has Harcourt. The others are\r\n    where they were.'\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith he had met for the first time in 1891, at Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nhouse, and found him 'much more intelligent than the ordinary run of\r\npoliticians.'\r\n\r\nDilke and Chamberlain, once closely united through a long period of\r\npublic life, had now been working apart for more than seven years.\r\nStrong minds, that in the collaboration of their earlier policy mutually\r\ninfluenced each other, had by a turn of personal fortune combining with\r\na great political change followed divided destinies; and their evolution\r\ncarried them far apart. They had met in private, had maintained the\r\npersonal bond, [Footnote: 'At this time I was searching for a secretary,\r\nand Chamberlain found me Hudson, who, as he said, \"fulfils all your\r\nrequirements.\"' The connection between the secretary and his chief ended\r\nonly with Sir Charles's death.] and in so meeting must inevitably have\r\nbeen prompted by a desire to minimize differences. But now they stood\r\nboth again in the public arena--the one returning after the lapse of\r\nyears, the other sustained by an unbroken continuance of Parliamentary\r\nactivity--and the situation became difficult.\r\n\r\nThere were not many men who could work with Mr. Chamberlain in equal\r\nalliance. For that a man was needed, confident enough in his own weight\r\nnot to fear being overbalanced in the combination; great enough in\r\nnature to be devoid of jealousy; and wise enough to understand that\r\nrestless activity was the law of his ally's being. Upon those conditions\r\nonly was it possible for a cooler, more temperate, and, on some\r\nsubjects, better instructed politician to steer the tremendous motive\r\npower which Mr. Chamberlain's personal force afforded. What was lost to\r\nthe world when the crippling of Sir Charles disjointed that alliance can\r\nnever be reckoned. Not only the alliance, but the personal intimacy, was\r\nbroken when their political ways sundered on the Home Rule division.\r\nFriendship remained; but it was not possible that men of that mark, who\r\nhad met incessantly in the closest confederacy, could meet easily when\r\nthe very groundwork of their intimacy was gone.\r\n\r\nSir Charles worked hard for a Bill specially interesting now to his\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nOn April 18th, 1893, 'I wrote to Chamberlain and to Randolph Churchill\r\nas to the Miners Bill, as its authors had asked me to lay plans for the\r\ndebate. From both I had replies favourable to local option, and on my\r\nwriting again to Chamberlain he answered: \"The sentence about the Labour\r\nleaders escaped me because I am, I confess, impatient of their extremely\r\nunpractical policy, and also because I believe their real influence is\r\nimmensely exaggerated. A political leader having genuine sympathy with\r\nthe working classes and a practical programme could, in my opinion,\r\nafford to set them aside. Mr. Gladstone has no real sympathy with the\r\nworking classes, and a perfect hatred for all forms of Socialism. His\r\nconcessions are extorted from him, and are the price paid for votes, and\r\ntherefore I do not wonder at the pressure put upon him.\"'\r\n\r\nIn the first week in May, 1893, 'I brought forward my Egypt motion,\r\nspoke for the Miners Bill, and carried a resolution, drawn for us by the\r\nLord Chancellor himself, as to the appointment of the magistrates for\r\ncounties. From this time forward I shall not name my speeches and\r\nordinary action in the House, as I had now regained the position which I\r\nhad held in it up to 1878, though not my position of 1878-1880, nor that\r\nof 1884-85.'\r\n\r\nNo Parliament is exactly like its predecessor, and changed conditions\r\nhad also changed the character of Sir Charles Dilke's Parliamentary\r\npersonal surroundings; but they were drawn now, as of old, from neither\r\nparty exclusively. The group comprised several young supporters of the\r\nGovernment, like Mr. McKenna, who, having failed in Clapham, wrote to\r\nSir Charles on July 7th, 1892, of his regret at not being near him in\r\nthe House of Commons 'to go on learning from you--I don't mean\r\ninformation, but patience and judgment and steadfastness.' Mr. McKenna\r\nhad now been returned for South Monmouthshire, one of the constituencies\r\nwhich had been anxious to secure Sir Charles himself. Here Sir Charles\r\nhad many devoted friends, who gave introductions to Mr. McKenna, which\r\nled to his adoption as candidate, and he wrote again to Sir Charles on\r\nhis election: 'I am glad to owe it to you.' Old friends--as, for\r\nexample, Mr. Morley--remained, and from the ranks of the Opposition at\r\nleast one rarely interesting figure stands out, that of H. O.\r\nArnold-Forster, who with Mrs. Arnold-Forster came to rank among the\r\nnearest friends of Sir Charles and Lady Dilke. The political tie was\r\nhere due to common advocacy of army reform, and it took shape in a kind\r\nof formal alliance.\r\n\r\n    'In November, 1893, in the debates on the Local Government Bill, I\r\n    carried a good deal of weight, and was able greatly to improve the\r\n    measure. I also in December made a speech in a naval debate which\r\n    was as successful as my Zulu speech--with as little reason, except\r\n    its opportuneness.'\r\n\r\nIn the Home Rule portion of the session of 1893, Sir Charles was mostly\r\nsilent, being, in his own words, inclined to 'keep still' on the main\r\nissue. His only contributions to the long debates were made during the\r\nCommittee stage, and concerned the electoral arrangements--a matter upon\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone was quick to acknowledge his high competence. When\r\nat last, in 1894, the Bill reached the Lords, it was rejected; and then\r\nthe foreseen change of leadership came to pass, and Lord Rosebery was\r\n'popped into Mr. Gladstone's place by an intrigue.' Sir Charles\r\ndiscussed in the _North American Review_ the result, which his Memoir\r\ndescribes thus. Admitting that the choice, which 'came as a surprise to\r\nthe Liberal party in the country,' would strengthen the Government in\r\nScotland and in London by Lord Rosebery's personal prestige, he none the\r\nless foresaw that the new leader would come into conflict 'with all that\r\nis active in the Liberal party,' unless he could renounce 'his personal\r\nwishes in favour of a reformed but a strong and indeed strengthened\r\nSecond Chamber.' His chance of success lay in putting himself as a peer\r\nat the head of a movement against the veto of the House of Lords. 'The\r\nchance is before him, but he is a cautious Scotchman who seldom makes up\r\nhis mind too soon, and who may possibly make it up too late.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile 'I was pressed to join Labouchere and Storey in opposing him,\r\nwhich I declined to do, on the ground that I was concerned with the\r\nmeasures proposed, but not with the men.'\r\n\r\nSpeaking in the Potteries on November 22nd, 'to a big audience which\r\ntook it well,' he 'attacked Rosebery about the Lords.'\r\n\r\n    'He would like to see Lord Rosebery in the popular House in which he\r\n    had never sat, and he would like to see Lord Salisbury back again.\r\n    Their ideas would undergo a change. The reform of the Upper House\r\n    was now not a Liberal but a Conservative nostrum.... It would be\r\n    necessary for the Radicals to fight even against their Liberal\r\n    leaders to prevent lengthening the life of the Parliamentary sick\r\n    man.... The Liberal party was still hampered by men who wanted\r\n    peerages for themselves and their sons, and he should not believe\r\n    that the leaders were in earnest until the Liberal party gave over\r\n    making peers. Moderate men must be warned by the example of what had\r\n    recently happened in Belgium, where the moderate Liberals had been\r\n    promptly suffocated between the two opposing forces of Toryism and\r\n    Socialism, as they were too pretentious to submit to Tory discipline\r\n    and too slavish to become frankly democratic.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nINDIA AND FRANCE--RHODES AND BISMARCK\r\n\r\n1886-1892\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the period covered by the earlier portion of the previous chapter,\r\nSir Charles Dilke had used his freedom as an opportunity for travel.\r\n\r\n    'During a visit to Paris, in the winter of 1886, paid in order to\r\n    discuss the question of the work which ultimately appeared in France\r\n    as _L'Europe en 1887_, I saw a good deal of Castelar, who was\r\n    visiting Paris at the same time; and it was to us that he made a\r\n    speech, which has become famous, about Boulanger, who was beginning\r\n    to attract great notice, declaring in French, \"I know that General\r\n    Boulanger--he is a Spanish General;\" meaning that the Spanish habit\r\n    of the military insurrection under the leadership of a showy General\r\n    was extending to France. [Footnote: In 1889 Sir Charles notes: 'My\r\n    wife and I were asked to dinner to meet General Boulanger; and I\r\n    decided that I would not go, neither did she.']\r\n\r\n    'Chamberlain, during his journey abroad, had seen a good deal of Sir\r\n    William White, the Ambassador at Constantinople, who wrote to me\r\n    about him: \"We became friends, and spoke naturally of you, our\r\n    mutual friend. I could not help seeing Chamberlain's immense\r\n    quickness of observation and talents. In foreign politics he\r\n    appeared to me to be beginning his ABC, but disposed to learn....\"\r\n    The Ambassador went on to say that the intimacy between France and\r\n    Russia was coming to the front at Constantinople, and that\r\n    Bismarck's Ambassador did not seem to take umbrage at it.\r\n\r\n    'In September, 1887, we went to France, where our journey had\r\n    nothing of great interest, except a visit to Vaux-le-Vicomte,\r\n    Fouquet's house, [Footnote: Near Melun, in the Seine-et-Marne, where\r\n    Fouquet gave the celebrated fête referred to. See _Mémoires de\r\n    Fouquet_, by A. Chéruel, vol. ii., chap. xxxv.] which remains very\r\n    much as Fouquet left it, although the gardens in which he received\r\n    Louis XIV. in the great féte recounted by Dumas have been completed\r\n    by their present proprietor, with whom we stayed. We afterwards\r\n    visited Constantinople, and stayed for ten days at Therapia, and\r\n    then at Athens, where I had a great reception, as indeed throughout\r\n    Greece, on account of my previous services to the Greek cause; in\r\n    some cases payment was refused on this ground. [Footnote: A letter\r\n    from Lady Dilke of October 29th, 1887, written to Cardinal Manning,\r\n    a constant correspondent, deals with one of these episodes:\r\n\r\n    \"We were received at the Piraeus by an order not to open our boxes,\r\n    an ignorant underling being severely rebuked, and bid to 'look at\r\n    the name on the boxes. Would you ask money from one who has done so\r\n    much for Greece?' In short, we had a royal reception. The Prime\r\n    Minister, the Metropolitan, and the other Ministers and their\r\n    families, and all dignitaries, ecclesiastical, academical,\r\n    political, military, all vied in showing Charles honour. The crowd\r\n    watched outside for a glimpse of him, and M. Ralli, when I said how\r\n    touched he was at their faithful gratitude, said: 'It is not only\r\n    our gratitude we wish to show him. You have no idea of the intense\r\n    sympathy felt for him in Athens.' We had but three days to give, and\r\n    so missed the great public banquet and the torchlight procession\r\n    which the students wished to organize. At Corinth the King and Queen\r\n    were equally kind.\"]\r\n\r\n    'Our journey to Turkey and Greece was full of interest. The Sultan\r\n    showed us immense courtesy. Greece after twenty-five years seemed to\r\n    me as lovely as ever. The Eastern Church were very civil to us, and\r\n    the reception at the Phanar at Constantinople by the Oecumenical\r\n    Patriarch, the Archbishop of Constantinople, Dionysius V., in Synod\r\n    was striking. I wrote from Constantinople to Chesson: \"The\r\n    Bulgarians and the Greeks are both now on excellent terms with the\r\n    Turks, although, unfortunately, they still detest one another. The\r\n    Sultan does not care two straws about Bulgaria now, and will do\r\n    nothing in the matter except mark time. The Greek Patriarch gave us\r\n    an official reception, with some Archbishops present, who\r\n    represented the Churches of Asia and of the Islands, and showed us\r\n    their splendid Byzantine treasures. It is extraordinarily\r\n    interesting to see all the effects of St. Chrysostom; but I cannot\r\n    help feeling that the Church sold the Empire to the Turks, and would\r\n    have been more estimable had it _lost_ its jewels. The last\r\n    Constantine tried to reunite the Eastern and Western Churches, and\r\n    the poor man was denounced as a heretic, and surrounded only by\r\n    Latins when he was killed on the breach. The Church, however, went\r\n    through a small martyrdom later on, and was glorified by suffering\r\n    at the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, when the then\r\n    Patriarch was hanged by the Turks and dragged about for three days\r\n    by the Jews. They all seem on very good terms now, and the Patriarch\r\n    sang the praises of the present Sultan loudly. The Sultan has been\r\n    very civil. I did not want to see him, which doubtless made him the\r\n    more anxious to see me. He sent for me twice, and, besides the\r\n    audience at the Selamlik, had us to a state dinner given in our\r\n    honour at the Haremlik. I refused the Grand Cordon of the Médjidieh,\r\n    but Emilia accepted the Grand Cordon of the Chefkat for herself. He\r\n    is very anxious to make a good impression, and is having the _Shrine\r\n    of Death_ done into Turk!\"\r\n\r\n    'I received a letter of thanks from the Secretary of the Trustees of\r\n    the National Portrait Gallery for having obtained for them from the\r\n    Sultan a copy of the portrait of Nelson which is in the Treasury at\r\n    Constantinople; but what I really tried to obtain was the original,\r\n    inasmuch as no one ever sees it where it is.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke, writing to Mr. Chamberlain an amused account of the\r\nSultan's advances, says: 'Lady White told Emilia that she heard I was to\r\nbe Grand Vizier.'\r\n\r\n    'My riding tour along the Baluch and Afghan frontiers was,' Sir\r\n    Charles notes, 'one of the pleasantest and most interesting\r\n    experiences of my life.' [Footnote: He adds, 'I described so fully\r\n    in the _Fortnightly Review_, in two articles of March 1st and April\r\n    1st, 1889, my riding tour ... that I shall say no more about it.'\r\n    This account of the journey is summarized from those articles, the\r\n    criticism on military questions being dealt with by Mr. Spenser\r\n    Wilkinson in the chapter on Defence (LV.).] Leaving England in\r\n    October, 1888, he landed with Lady Dilke at Karachi in November.\r\n    They were met by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Frederick Roberts, and\r\n    went on over the broad-gauge line, then not officially open, through\r\n    the Bolan Pass to Quetta. 'When we reached the picturesque portion\r\n    of the pass, we left our carriages for an open truck placed at the\r\n    head of the train, in front of two engines, and there we sat with\r\n    the fore part of the truck occupied by the paws and head of His\r\n    Excellency's dog; next came the one lady of the party and Sir\r\n    Frederick Roberts, and then myself and all the staff. The long-\r\n    haired warriors and tribesmen, who occupied every point of vantage\r\n    on the crags, doubtless thought, and have since told their tribesmen\r\n    on their return, that the whole scene was devised to do honour to a\r\n    dog.'\r\n\r\nThey were travelling over part of 'the great strategic railroad\r\nconstructed after the Penjdeh incident, on orders given by the\r\nGovernment of which I was a member.'\r\n\r\nAt Quetta he was among the guests of Sir Robert Sandeman, Agent for\r\nBritish Baluchistan, ruler in all but name of those nominally\r\nindependent frontier principalities and clans. 'Quetta conversations\r\nsoon brought back reminiscences of far-off days. When I had last seen\r\nSir Robert Sandeman it had been in London, during the discussion of the\r\noccupation of the Khojak position, in which I sided with him.... We\r\nbrought with us or found gathered here all the men who best understood\r\nthe problem of frontier defence--a very grave problem, too.'\r\n\r\nThe party assembled under the roof of the Residency included the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, of whom Sir Charles says: 'Sir Frederick Roberts\r\nknows India as no one else knows it, and knows the Indian Army as no one\r\nelse has ever known it'; the Adjutant-General; the Quartermaster-\r\nGeneral, who was Director of Military Intelligence; the Military Member\r\nof Council, General Chesney; and Sir Charles Elliott, the Member of\r\nCouncil for Public Works, who had charge of the strategic railways. With\r\nthem were the Inspectors-General of Artillery and of Military Works, the\r\nSecretary of the Defence Commission, and the General in Command at\r\nQuetta, as well as his predecessor, who had not yet vacated the post.\r\n\r\nHe saw manoeuvres outside Quetta in the valleys that lead from the\r\nAfghan side, and he had the experience of riding up and down those stony\r\nhill slopes beside the Commander-in-Chief. He explored the Khojak\r\ntunnel, then under process of construction, running through 'a wall-like\r\nrange which reminds one of the solitude of Sainte-Baume in Provence,'\r\nsurveyed all the defences of Quetta, and then, while Lady Dilke went on\r\nby rail to Simla, he set out to ride, in company with Sir Frederick\r\nRoberts and Sir Robert Sandeman, from Harnai, through the Bori and Zhob\r\nValleys, towards the Gomul Pass. On that journey he saw great gatherings\r\nof chiefs and tribesmen come in to meet and salute the representatives\r\nof British rule. He watched Sir Robert Sandeman parleying with the\r\nborderers, and was introduced to them as the statesman who had\r\nsanctioned the new road. These were regions beyond the reach of\r\ntelegraph, where outposts maintained communications by a pigeon post, of\r\nwhich the mountain hawk took heavy toll; and each day's journey was a\r\nhard and heavy ride.\r\n\r\nThe ride continued for twelve days, through scorching sun by day and\r\nbitter cold at night; and every march brought its full portion of\r\nstrange and beautiful sights. All the romance of border rule, outposts\r\namong robber tribes, order maintained through the agency of subsidized\r\nchiefs, were disclosed; and even when the conditions of travel changed,\r\nwhen a train took them from the Upper Indus to Nowshera and Peshawur, it\r\nbrought to Sir Charles the opportunity of seeing what interested him no\r\nless than the wild tribal levies--namely, the pick of British regulars\r\nin India, both native and European.\r\n\r\nThe splendour and beauty of the pageant pleased the eye, and there was\r\nnot lacking a dramatic interest. He had seen by Sir Frederick Roberts's\r\nside the mountain battle-ground where the day of Maiwand was avenged and\r\nBritish prestige restored; now he was present when Ayub Khan, the victor\r\nof Maiwand, voluntarily came forward to hold speech for the first time\r\nwith the conqueror who so swiftly blotted out the Afghan's victory.\r\n\r\n    'On our way back (from India) we stayed at Cairo, and saw much of\r\n    Sir Evelyn Baring, Riaz, Mustapha Fehmy, the Khedive, Tigrane,\r\n    Yakoub Artin, and the other leading men. At Rome, as we passed\r\n    through Italy, I made the acquaintance of many of my wife's friends,\r\n    the most interesting of whom was, perhaps, Madame Minghetti, known\r\n    to her friends as Donna Laura, and previously Princess Camporeale;\r\n    and I obtained through Bonghi, whom we saw both at Naples and at\r\n    Rome, an order to see Spezia--an order which was refused by the War\r\n    Office, and granted by the Admiralty. The Admiral commanding the\r\n    Fleet and the Préfet Maritime were both very kind, and I thoroughly\r\n    saw the arsenal, fleet, and forts, with the two Admirals.'\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Sir Charles writes:\r\n\r\n    'On September 7th in the year 1891 I started for the French\r\n    manoeuvres, to which I had been invited by Galliffet. By sending\r\n    over my horses I was able to see the manoeuvres extremely well....\r\n\r\n    'The Marquis de Galliffet was an interesting figure, a soldier of\r\n    the time of Louis XV., who, however, had thoroughly learned his\r\n    modern work. There were 125,000 men in the field, but, looking back\r\n    to my adventures, I am now more struck by the strange future of the\r\n    friends I made than by the interest, great as it was, of the\r\n    tactics. We had on the staff almost all those who afterwards became\r\n    leading men in the Dreyfus case, on both sides of that affair.\r\n    Saussier, the Generalissimo, had with him, to look after the foreign\r\n    officers, Colonel (afterwards Sir) Reginald Talbot, Huehne' (German\r\n    Military Attaché), 'and others--Maurice Weil (the Jew friend of\r\n    Esterhazy), who was in the Rennes trial named by the defence as the\r\n    real spy, though, I am convinced, innocent. We now know, of course,\r\n    that Esterhazy should have been the villain of the play.... General\r\n    Billot, afterwards Minister of War, was present, living with\r\n    Saussier, as a spectator. Galliffet had under him nearly 120,000\r\n    men, but the skeleton enemy was commanded by General Boisdeffre,\r\n    afterwards Chief of the Staff, and the leader of the clerical party\r\n    in the Ministry of War, and friend, throughout the \"affair,\" of\r\n    Billot. General Brault, also afterwards Chief of the Staff, was in\r\n    the manoeuvres Chief of the Staff to Galliffet. He, it will be\r\n    remembered, also played his part in the \"affair,\" as did Huehne,\r\n    named above. On Galliffet's staff, besides General Brault, were\r\n    Colonel Bailloud, also concerned in the Dreyfus case; Captain\r\n    Picquart, afterwards the youngest Lieutenant-Colonel in the French\r\n    army, a brilliant and most thoughtful military scholar, the hero of\r\n    the Dreyfus case in its later aspects; the Comte d'Alsace,\r\n    afterwards a deputy, and, although a clerical Conservative, a\r\n    witness for Dreyfus; and Joseph Reinach, the real author of the\r\n    virtual rehabilitation of Dreyfus. It was a singularly brilliant\r\n    staff. Bailloud, it may be remembered, afterwards became\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of the China Expedition.\r\n\r\n    'Of those who have not been named, in addition to the remarkable men\r\n    who figured in the Dreyfus case, and among the few on this staff who\r\n    were not concerned in it, were other interesting persons: the Prince\r\n    d'Hénin, M. de la Guiche, and a man who was interesting, and figures\r\n    largely in memoirs, Galliffet's bosom friend, the Marquis du Lau\r\n    d'Allemans. \"Old Du Lau,\" as he is generally called, was a rich _bon\r\n    vivant_, with a big house in Paris, who throughout life has been a\r\n    sort of perpetual \"providence\" to Galliffet, going with him\r\n    everywhere, even to the Courts where Galliffet was a favourite\r\n    guest. Reinach and Du Lau were not soldiers in the strict sense of\r\n    the term, although members of Galliffet's staff. Maurice Weil,\r\n    though a great military writer, was himself not a soldier, although\r\n    on Saussier's headquarters staff in Paris and in the field. Weil and\r\n    Reinach were both officers of the territorial army: Weil a Colonel\r\n    of artillery, Reinach a Lieutenant of Chasseurs à Cheval. Du Lau was\r\n    a dragoon Lieutenant of stupendous age--possibly an ex-Lieutenant,\r\n    with the right to wear his uniform when out as a volunteer on\r\n    service. I was walking with him one day in a village, when a small\r\n    boy passing said to a companion \"What a jolly old chap for a\r\n    Lieutenant!\" And it was strange indeed to see the long white hair of\r\n    the old Marquis streaming from beneath his helmet. He was older, I\r\n    think, than Galliffet, who was retiring, and who received during\r\n    these manoeuvres the plain military medal, which is the joy of\r\n    French hall-porters, but the highest distinction which can be\r\n    conferred by the Republic on a General who is a member of the\r\n    Supreme Council of War and at the top of the tree in the Legion of\r\n    Honour. Joseph Reinach was, of course, young enough to be the son of\r\n    old Du Lau, but since leaving the regular regiment of Chasseurs--in\r\n    which he had done his service at Nancy, while Gyp (his future enemy\r\n    and that of his race) was the reigning Nancy beauty--he had expanded\r\n    in figure so that his sky-blue-and-silver and fine horse did not\r\n    save him from comments by the children who had noted Du Lau's age.\r\n    The Duc d'Aumale was also present on horseback as a spectator, but\r\n    his official friends, and their friends, were forced to ignore him,\r\n    as he had not yet made his peace with the Republic.\r\n\r\n    'As soon as I had joined Galliffet, I wrote to my wife: \"Conduct of\r\n    troops most orderly. It is now, of course, here, as it was already\r\n    in 1870 with the Germans, that, the soldier being Guy Boys\r\n    [Footnote: Guy Boys was Lady Dilke's nephew; Jim Haslett the\r\n    ferryman at Dockett. Sir Charles was illustrating the fact that all\r\n    classes serve together both in the ranks and as officers.] and Jim\r\n    Haslett and all of us, and not a class apart, there is no 'military\r\n    tone.' Discipline, nevertheless, seems perfect, but are the officers\r\n    as good as the non-commissioned officers and the men? I doubt.\r\n    Promotion from the ranks combined with special promotion to the\r\n    highest ranks for birth of all nobles who have any brains at all is\r\n    a combination which gives results inferior to either the Swiss\r\n    democratic plan or the Prussian aristocratic. Perhaps a fifth of the\r\n    officers are noble, but more than half the powerful officers are\r\n    noble; and here we are with the sides commanded by the Prince\r\n    d'Eckmühl and the Prince de Sartigues.\" (During the first days of\r\n    the manoeuvres the four army corps and the two cavalry divisions\r\n    were combined under Galliffet; half the army was commanded by\r\n    General Davoust, who, of course, is the first of these two Princes;\r\n    and Galliffet had for \"second title\" the name of his Provençal\r\n    principality near Marseilles.) \"You may say, 'The Generalissimo,\r\n    sausage-maker, restores the balance.' But the real Generalissimo is\r\n    Miribel, Aristo of the Aristos--for he is a poor noble of the South.\r\n    Another of the army corps is commanded by a Breton, Kerhuel, and the\r\n    other by a man of army descent for ever and ever, Négrier, son and\r\n    nephew of Napoleonic Generals.\"'\r\n\r\n    'An amusing billet adventure was named in another letter to my wife:\r\n\r\n    '\"I am in a Legitimist chàteau: one side of the room, Callots; the\r\n    other, Comte de Chambord. Over the bed a large crucifix. The room\r\n    belongs to 'Mathilde.' But as I live with the staff I do not see the\r\n    family. The butler is charming, and the fat coachman turned out two\r\n    of _his_ horses to make room for 'Madame' and 'W'f'd'r.' I had to\r\n    write a letter to a French newspaper, which had charged me with\r\n    turning my back on the standard of a regiment instead of bowing to\r\n    it, and dated from this place: 'Château de Boussencourt.'\"'\r\n\r\nHis observations were summed up in an article for the _Fortnightly_,\r\nwhich was later translated into French by an officer on the staff of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, and, after appearing in a review, was published\r\nseparately by the military library. His strictures on the handling of\r\nthe cavalry led to a controversy in France into which he was obliged\r\nlater to enter.\r\n\r\n    'As I passed through Paris on my return, Galliffet wrote: \"You are\r\n    as a writer full of kindness, but very dangerous as an observer, and\r\n    next time I shall certainly put you on the treatment of the military\r\n    attachés--plenty of dinners, plenty of close carriages, plenty of\r\n    gendarmes, no information, and a total privation of field-glasses.\r\n    This will be a change for you, especially in the matter of dinners.\r\n    Lady Dilke cannot have forgiven me for sending you back in such\r\n    wretched condition.\"'\r\n\r\nM. Joseph Beinach wrote in 1911:\r\n\r\n    'Nous recommandions tous deux le rajeunissement des cadres. II s'est\r\n    trouvé enfin un ministre de la guerre, M. le général Brun, pour\r\n    aborder résolument le problème. Comme nos souvenirs revenaient\r\n    fréquemment aux belles journées de ces manoeuvres de l'Est! Je\r\n    revois encore Dilke chevauchant avec nous dans l'état-major de\r\n    Gallififet. II y avait la le général Brault, le général Darras, le\r\n    général Zurlinden, le \"commandant\" Picquart, Thierry d'Alsace, le\r\n    marquis Du Lau.... Ah! la \"bataille\" de Margerie-Haucourt, sous le\r\n    grand soleil qui, dissipant les nuages de la matinée, fit scintiller\r\n    tout à coup comme une moisson d'acier les milliers de fusils des\r\n    armées réunies! Comme c'est loin! Que de tombeaux!... Mais nous\r\n    sommes bien encore quelques-uns à avoir gardé intactes nos âmes\r\n    d'alors!' [Footnote: An article in the _Figaro_ written after Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke's death.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1889 that Sir Charles Dilke came into touch with Cecil Rhodes\r\nduring a visit paid by the latter to England.\r\n\r\n    'In July, 1889, I saw a good deal of Cecil Rhodes, who was brought\r\n    to my house by Sir Charles Mills, [Footnote: Then Agent-General for\r\n    the Cape and a great personal friend.] and afterwards came back\r\n    several times. He was at this moment interesting, full of life and\r\n    vigour, but when he returned to England after the British South\r\n    Africa Company had been started he seemed to have become half torpid\r\n    and at the same time dogmatic. The simplicity which had\r\n    distinguished him up to the end of his visit of 1889 seemed to have\r\n    disappeared when he came back in 1891; and his avowed intention of\r\n    ultimately coming to England to take part in English politics seemed\r\n    also a strange mistake, as he was essentially a man fitted for\r\n    colonial life, and had none of the knowledge, or the mode of\r\n    concealing want of knowledge, one or other of which is required for\r\n    English public work.'\r\n\r\n    'In August, 1889, I received a note from Rhodes from Lisbon which\r\n    constitutes, I believe, a valuable autograph, for his friends all\r\n    say he \"never writes.\" I had asked him to clear up an extraordinary\r\n    passage in one of Kruger's speeches (on which I afterwards commented\r\n    in _Problems of Greater Britain_), and Rhodes wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"The fates were unpropitious to my day on the river, as matters\r\n    required me in South Africa, from which place I propose to send you\r\n    the famous speech you want. I quite see the importance, if true, of\r\n    his utterance, but I can hardly think Kruger would have said it. I\r\n    hope you will still hold to your intention of visiting the Cape, and\r\n    I can only say I will do all I can to assist you in seeing those\r\n    parts with which I am connected. I am afraid Matabeleland will be in\r\n    too chaotic a state to share in your visit, but between the diamonds\r\n    and the gold there is a good extent to travel over. I am doubtful\r\n    about your getting Kruger's speech before you publish, but it will\r\n    be the first thing I will attend to on my arrival at the Cape.\r\n    Kindly remember me to Lady Dilke.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    '\"C. J. Rhodes.\"\r\n\r\n    'At the beginning of November, 1889, I heard again from Rhodes, who\r\n    wrote from Kimberley:\r\n\r\n    '\"Dear Sir Charles Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"I have come to the conclusion that Kruger never made use of the\r\n    expression attributed to him, as I can find no trace of it in the\r\n    reports of his speech on the Second Chamber. I send you a copy of\r\n    the draft law....\r\n\r\n    '\"Thanks for your news of Bismarck's map. Their true boundary is the\r\n    20th degree of longitude, and it will take them all their time to\r\n    retain even that, as the Damaras are entirely opposed to them, and\r\n    the German company which nominally holds that territory will soon\r\n    have to liquidate for lack of funds. It is one thing to paint a map,\r\n    and it is quite another to really occupy and govern a new territory.\r\n    I am still waiting for the news of the signature of the charter,\r\n    which I hope will not be much longer delayed. I think Kruger will\r\n    find his hands quite full enough without interfering with me. He is\r\n    still trying to get them to give him Swaziland in return for\r\n    non-interference in Matabeleland. The Matabele King (Lobengula)\r\n    still continues to slaughter his subjects, and makes the minds of\r\n    our representatives at times very uncomfortable. It is undoubtedly a\r\n    difficult problem to solve; but the plain fact remains that a savage\r\n    chief with about 8,000 warriors is not going to keep out the huge\r\n    wave of white men now moving north, and so I feel it will come all\r\n    right.\r\n\r\n    '\"Yours,\r\n    '\"C. J. Rhodes.\"\r\n\r\n    'In March, 1890, I received a letter from Rhodes from the Kimberley\r\n    Club, in which, after giving some facts with regard to the state of\r\n    South Africa, he went on: \"I see that Home Rule is gaining ground.\r\n    [Footnote: Rhodes had given Mr. Parnell a subscription of £10,000.]\r\n    It really means the American Constitution. It is rather a big\r\n    change, and the doubt is whether the conservative nature of the\r\n    English people will face it when they understand what Home Rule\r\n    means. Schnadhorst is here, but is still suffering very acutely from\r\n    rheumatism.\"'\r\n\r\nThe reference to 'Bismarck's map' in the second of these communications\r\nshows that Sir Charles had reported to Rhodes some of the observations\r\nmade by the Chancellor in the course of the visit of which an account\r\nhere follows.\r\n\r\n    'In September, 1889, having settled to take my son to Germany to a\r\n    gymnasium, and having told Herbert Bismarck my intention when he was\r\n    in London, I was asked by him in his father's name to stay at\r\n    Friedrichsruh with the Prince. I started for Germany with my son at\r\n    the same moment at which my wife started for the Trades Congress at\r\n    Dundee.'\r\n\r\nHe wrote to M. Joseph Reinach in August, 1889: 'I'm going to\r\nFriedrichsruh the week after next to stay with Prince Bismarck, who\r\nseems very anxious to see me--about colonial matters, I think. I will\r\ntell you what he says, for your private information, if he talks of\r\nanything else, which is not, however, likely, as he knows my views about\r\nthat Alsace question which lies at the root of all others. But I had\r\nsooner my going there was not mentioned in advance, and I shall not be\r\nthere until September 7th-9th.'\r\n\r\n    'Herbert Bismarck wrote: \"I hope you will accept my father's\r\n    invitation, because he is anxious to make your personal\r\n    acquaintance. I am greatly disappointed that I shall be deprived of\r\n    the pleasure of introducing you myself to my father, owing to my\r\n    absence, but, then, I am sure that you will find yourself at your\r\n    ease in Friedrichsruh, whether I am there or not. Hoping to see you\r\n    before long in England, believe me,\r\n\r\n      '\"Very truly yours,\r\n        '\"H. Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\n    'The son was still called Count von Bismarck by himself, and\r\n    popularly Herbert Bismarck, but shortly afterwards his father gave\r\n    him the family castle of Schoenhausen, and from that time forward he\r\n    used on his cards the name of Graf Bismarck-Schoenhausen. When I got\r\n    to Ratzeburg, where I left my son, I found a telegram from\r\n    Friedrichsruh: \"Prince Bismarck looks forward to your visit\r\n    to-morrow with great pleasure\"; and then it went on to tell me about\r\n    trains.\r\n\r\n    'I was met at the station by Prince Bismarck's official\r\n    secretary--Rottenburg of the Foreign Office--with an open carriage,\r\n    although the house was formerly the railway hotel (Frascati) and\r\n    adjoins the station. I wrote to my wife on Saturday, September 7th:\r\n    \"The great man has been very sweet to me, though he is in pain from\r\n    his sinews. We had an hour's walk before lunch together. Then\r\n    Hatzfeldt, the Ambassador in London, came, and all the afternoon we\r\n    have been driving, and went to the harvest-home, where the Bismarck\r\n    grandchildren danced with the peasants on the grass. The daughter,\r\n    and mother of these children, does the honours, and is the only\r\n    lady; and at dinner we shall be the Prince, Hatzfeldt, self,\r\n    Countess von Rantzau, Count von Rantzau, Rottenburg the secretary, a\r\n    tutor and another secretary, the two last 'dumb persons.' The forest\r\n    is a Pyrford of 25,000 acres, but the house is in the situation of a\r\n    Dockett, and must be damp in winter till the great January frost\r\n    sets in, when the Baltic is hard frozen.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes upon this: 'Hatzfeldt was the Chancellor's right-hand\r\nman--of action. But Bismarck did not consult him: he said, \"Do,\" and\r\nHatzfeldt did.'\r\n\r\nThe letter continues:\r\n\r\n    '\"When Bismarck's Reichshund died, a successor was appointed, but\r\n    the Emperor, who had heard of the death and not of the appointment\r\n    to fill the vacancy, gave another, and the Prince says: 'Courtier as\r\n    I am, I sent away my dog to my head-forester's and kept the gift\r\n    one, but as I do not like him I leave him at Berlin.' Here the\r\n    favourite reigns, and her name is Rebekkah, and she answers very\r\n    prettily to the name of Bex. The old gentleman is dear in his polite\r\n    ways.... The daughter is equally pleasant, and the son-in-law as\r\n    well. We were loudly cheered at the harvest festival, of course....\r\n    You can write to our friend J. R. [Reinach] of the R.F. [_République\r\n    Française_] that I found the Chancellor very determined on peace as\r\n    long as he lives, which he fears will not be long, and afraid of\r\n    Prussian action after his death.\"\r\n\r\n    'In another letter the next day, Sunday, September 8th 1889, I\r\n    wrote: \"I expected the extreme simplicity of life. The coachman\r\n    alone wears livery, and that only a plain blue with ordinary black\r\n    trousers and ordinary black hat--no cockades and no stripes. There\r\n    are only two indoor men-servants: a groom of the chambers, and one\r\n    other not in livery--the one shown in the photograph of Bismarck\r\n    receiving the Emperor, but there, for this occasion only, dressed in\r\n    a state livery. [Footnote: Photographs which Bismarck gave Sir\r\n    Charles, showing the Chancellor with his hound receiving the young\r\n    Kaiser, and Bismarck alone with his dog, always hung on the wall at\r\n    Dockett.] The family all drink beer at lunch, and offer the thinnest\r\n    of thin Mosel. Bismarck has never put on a swallow-tail coat but\r\n    once, which he says was in 1835, and which is of peculiar shape. A\r\n    tall hat he does not possess, and he proscribes tall hats and\r\n    evening dress among his guests. His view is that a Court and an army\r\n    should be in uniform, but that when people are not on duty at Court\r\n    or in war, or preparation for war, they should wear a comfortable\r\n    dress, and each man that form of dress that he finds most agreeable\r\n    to himself, provided that it be not that which he calls evening\r\n    dress and tall hats--a sort of 'sham uniform.' Countess von Rantzau,\r\n    however, dresses in a high, short evening gown like other people.\r\n    The Prince eats nothing at all except young partridges and\r\n    salt-herring, and the result is that the cookery is feeble, though\r\n    for game-eaters there is no hardship. The table groans with red-deer\r\n    venison, ham, grouse, woodcock, and the inevitable partridges--\r\n    roast, boiled, with white sauce, cold, pickled in vinegar. A French\r\n    cook would hang himself. There is no sweet at dinner except fruit,\r\n    stewed German fashion with the game. Trout, which the family\r\n    themselves replace by raw salt-herring, and game, form the whole\r\n    dinner. Of wines and beer they drink at dinner a most extraordinary\r\n    mixture, but as the wine is all the gift of Emperors and merchant\r\n    princes it is good. The cellar card was handed to the Prince with\r\n    the fish, and, after consultation with me, and with Hatzfeldt, we\r\n    started on sweet champagne, not suggested by me, followed by\r\n    Bordeaux, followed by still Mosel, followed by Johannesberg (which I\r\n    did suggest), followed by black beer, followed by corn brandy. When\r\n    I reached the Johannesberg I stopped, and went on with that only, so\r\n    that I got a second bottle drawn for dessert. When the Chancellor\r\n    got to his row of great pipes, standing against the wall ready\r\n    stuffed for him, we went back to black beer. The railway-station is\r\n    in the garden, and the expresses shake the house.\"\r\n\r\n    'Other points which struck me in the manners and customs of\r\n    Friedrichsruh were that the Chancellor invariably took a barrel of\r\n    beer out driving, and stopped halfway in the afternoon and insisted\r\n    on his guests consuming it out of a two-handled mug which appeared\r\n    from under the coachman's seat. I had some talk with him about the\r\n    wisdom of his going unprotected for great distances through the\r\n    woods, and he answered, \"But I am not unprotected,\" and showed me a\r\n    pistol which he carried, but, of course, a man with a blunderbuss\r\n    behind a tree might easily have killed him. He never takes a servant\r\n    on the box by the side of the coachman, and generally drives\r\n    entirely alone. He rides alone without a groom, and walks alone with\r\n    only his dog, or rather the forester's dog, the daughter of the\r\n    Reichshund, who walks six or seven miles every morning to go out\r\n    with him, and six or seven miles every night to come to dinner.\r\n\r\n    'The Prince was evidently discontented with the Emperor, but wholly\r\n    unable to believe that he himself could be done without. He told me\r\n    that he must work each day and could never take a holiday, but that\r\n    even a few minutes' work was sufficient, as all that was necessary\r\n    was that he should keep an eye on what was going on. All was now so\r\n    well arranged that the only thing which gave him trouble was the\r\n    internal condition of Alsace, which as a Reichsland had him alone as\r\n    a Minister. In the evening he chatted much about the past; told me\r\n    of his visit to London in 1842, of how a cabman tried to cheat him,\r\n    and how at last he held out all his money in his hand and said to\r\n    the man, \"Pay yourself\"; how then the man took less than that which\r\n    he had refused, his right fare, and then with every sign of scorn\r\n    ejaculated, \"What I say is, God damn all Frenchmen!\" Bismarck speaks\r\n    admirable English, with hardly any trace of accent, but spoken very\r\n    slowly. French he speaks more rapidly but less well; and of Russian\r\n    he has a fair knowledge. He told me how (also in 1842) he had\r\n    visited Barclay and Perkins's, and had been offered an enormous\r\n    tankard of their strongest ale. \"Thinking of my country, I drank it\r\n    slowly to the last drop, and then left them, courteously I hope; I\r\n    got as far as London Bridge, and there I sat down in a recess, and\r\n    for hours the bridge went round.\" He told me how he had striven to\r\n    keep the peace through the time of Napoleon III., but finding it\r\n    useless had prepared for war; and he made no secret of the fact that\r\n    he had brought the war about. He told me himself, in so many words,\r\n    that at the last moment he had made war by cutting down a telegram\r\n    from the King of Prussia, as I have said above; [Footnote: See\r\n    Chapter XL (Vol. I., p. 157).] \"the alteration of the telegram from\r\n    one of two hundred words to one of twenty words\" had \"made it into a\r\n    trumpet blast\"--as Moltke and Von Roon, who were with him at dinner\r\n    when it came, had said--\"a trumpet blast which\" had \"roused all\r\n    Germany.\" As he mellowed with his pipes he told me that, though he\r\n    was a high Tory, he had come to see the ills of absolutism, which,\r\n    to work, required the King to be an angel. \"Now,\" he said, \"Kings,\r\n    even when good, have women round them, who, even if Queens, govern\r\n    them to their personal ends.\" It was very plain that he was on bad\r\n    terms with the Emperor, and equally clear that he did not believe\r\n    that the Emperor would dare dismiss him.'\r\n\r\n    A commentary on the last sentence follows at no long interval, when\r\n    _Problems of Greater Britain_ appeared and 'Herbert Bismarck, in\r\n    thanking me for a copy of my book, said: \"My father ... sends you\r\n    his kindest regards. He is just going to disentangle himself from\r\n    the Prussian administration altogether, and will resign the post as\r\n    Prime Minister, so that he will only remain Chancellor of the\r\n    Empire.\" This was on February 10th, 1890, and before long Bismarck\r\n    had been still further \"disentangled,\" not by his own act,' but by a\r\n    blow almost as sudden and dramatic as that which, in 1661, had\r\n    struck down the owner of Vaux. [Footnote: See the _Mémoires de\r\n    Fouquet_, by A. Chéruel, vol.ii., chap, xxxviii.]\r\n\r\n    'In a second letter that young Bismarck wrote, he thanked me for\r\n    sending him the famous sketch from _Punch_ (Tenniel's cartoon) of\r\n    the captain of the ship sending away the pilot. He wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"I thank you very much for your kind note, which warmed my heart,\r\n    and for the sketch you have cut out of _Punch_. It is indeed a fine\r\n    one, and my father, to whom I showed it yesterday when your letter\r\n    reached me, was pleased with its acuteness, as well as with the kind\r\n    messages you sent him and which he requites. He has left last night\r\n    for good, and I follow to-night to Friedrichsruh. It was a rather\r\n    melancholy historical event, when my father stepped out of the house\r\n    in which he has lived for the benefit of my country for nearly\r\n    twenty-eight years. When I wrote you last, my father thought only of\r\n    leaving the offices he held in Prussia, but things went on so\r\n    rapidly that he did not see his way to remain as Chancellor in\r\n    Berlin after the Emperor had let him know that His Majesty wished\r\n    him to resign. I had no choice what course to take after he had been\r\n    dismissed. My health is so much shaken that I am not able to take\r\n    upon my shoulders alone the tremendous amount of responsibility for\r\n    the foreign affairs of Germany which hitherto fell upon my father.\r\n    When we drove to the station yesterday, our carriage was almost\r\n    upset by the enthusiastic crowd of many thousand people who thronged\r\n    the streets and cheered him on his passage in a deafening way; but\r\n    it was satisfactory for my father to see that there are people left\r\n    who regret his departure. I shall come back to Berlin after April\r\n    1st to clear my house and to pack my things, and then I shall stay\r\n    with my father till the end of April. In May I hope to come to\r\n    England, and I look forward to the pleasure of seeing you then.\r\n\r\n    '\"Believe me,\r\n\r\n    '\"Ever yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    '\"H. Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\n    'He dined with me on May 15th, 1890, when Arnold Morley, Borthwick,\r\n    Jeune, Fitzmaurice, Harry Lawson, and others, came to meet him; and\r\n    from this time forward he came frequently to England.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles, while meeting the younger man thus often, never again had\r\nsight or speech of the old Chancellor. 'In Christmas week [1892] I had a\r\ngeneral invitation from Prince Bismarck to stay with him again at\r\nFriedrichsruh. But the chance never came.' Immediately on his return\r\nfrom Germany Sir Charles wrote to his friend Reinach:\r\n\r\n      'Pyrford by Maybury,\r\n        'Near Woking,\r\n          '_September_ l3_th_, 1889.\r\n\r\n    'My Dear Reinach,\r\n\r\n    'Bismarck c'est la paix. As long as he lives, which he thinks will\r\n    not be long, he expects no movement. He agrees with me that the\r\n    first movement will come from Russia. He expects the Republic to\r\n    last in France. Bleichröder tells him that Ferry is the one man of\r\n    energy and power.\r\n\r\n      'Yours,\r\n        'Chs. W. D.'\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, in answer to a question by M. Reinach, this is added:\r\n\r\n    'Health as good as he says. But he does _not_ say that. He says he\r\n    suffers very much. The fact is that he looks very much older than he\r\n    is, and his hands look like ninety instead of seventy-four.'\r\n\r\nWhat Bismarck thought of his guest may be gathered from a saying quoted\r\nin public by Dr. Stephen Bauer. Baron Rottenburg, Bismarck's first\r\nsecretary, had told him that, after Sir Charles's visit to\r\nFriedrichsruh, the Chancellor spoke of him as 'the most interesting of\r\nliving English statesmen.' [Footnote: At the banquet given to Sir\r\nCharles Dilke in April, 1910.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of Bismarck's efforts to bring about another meeting, this\r\nvisit was the only occasion on which the two men met. It was at a time\r\nwhen the great maker of United Germany was nearing his fall. He was\r\nbecoming the bitter adversary of the Kaiser and of his policy, a policy\r\nwhich he foresaw might imperil 'the strength and glory of the German\r\nEmpire.' In the often-quoted words of his instructions to diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives abroad--'Do all in your power to keep up good\r\nrelationship with the English. You need not even use a secret cipher in\r\ncabling. We have nothing to conceal from the English, for it would be\r\nthe greatest possible folly to antagonize England'--is to be found one\r\nmain point of Bismarck's diplomacy; and feeling thus, he welcomed a\r\nconference with the English statesman of that generation whom he had\r\nlooked upon as certain to be a force in the approaching years. When at\r\nlast the meeting took place, Dilke had been overtaken by circumstances\r\nwhich altered his political position in England. But neither Bismarck\r\nnor any other statesman on the Continent anticipated that they could\r\npossibly have the result of excluding permanently from office one of the\r\nvery few English statesmen whose names carried weight with foreign\r\nPowers on military and international politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nPERSONAL LIFE--IN OPPOSITION\r\n\r\n1895 TO 1904\r\n\r\n\r\nFew members of the House of Commons can have been sorry to see the last\r\nof the Parliament which ended in June, 1895; and Sir Charles had nothing\r\nto regret in its disappearance. In respect of foreign affairs, he saw\r\nlittle to choose between the Liberal and Tory Ministers except that, of\r\nthe two, Lord Salisbury was 'the less wildly Jingo.' On questions of\r\nImperial Defence many of his old friends in the Liberal Government were\r\narrayed against him; and with matters standing as they stood between the\r\ntwo Houses, there was no hope of any important Labour legislation. Lord\r\nSalisbury had again become Prime Minister, and under the new\r\nConservative Administration everything went more easily. Sir Charles\r\ntestified in one of his speeches that Mr. Balfour's leadership, 'by his\r\nunfailing courtesy to all members, made the House of Commons a pleasant\r\nplace'; and Mr. Balfour's leadership was well assured of several years'\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nA great Parliamentarian, Sir Charles nevertheless held no brief for\r\nParliament. As a practical statesman, he realized the advantages in a\r\nstrong hand of such a machine as Bismarck controlled; while his\r\ndemocratic instincts made him favour the Swiss methods, with direct\r\nintervention of the people through the Referendum.\r\n\r\n'I trained a whole generation of professional politicians to respect the\r\nHouse of Commons,' he said, 'but I was never favourable to the\r\nParliamentary, and I was even hostile to the Party, system.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, since England was wedded to its traditional system, to\r\nwork this efficiently was the first duty of an English politician. A\r\nnote from Sir Reginald Palgrave in 1893 acknowledges gratefully some\r\ncriticisms of the tenth edition of the classical work which deals with\r\nthis subject. No one was ever better qualified than Sir Charles to say\r\nwhat could or could not be done by the rules of order, and he would\r\ncertainly have inculcated upon every politician the necessity of this\r\nknowledge as a practical equipment.\r\n\r\n'What Dilke did,' writes Mr. McKenna, 'was to impress upon me the\r\nimportance of a thorough understanding of the procedure and business of\r\nthe House of Commons, a branch of knowledge in which he was an\r\naccomplished master.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles's whole scheme of existence was arranged with reference to\r\nthe work of Parliament. Of it he wrote on December 15th, 1905, in reply\r\nto Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, who had dwelt on the interest of county\r\ngovernment:\r\n\r\n    'The development of character in politics and the human side of the\r\n    House of Commons have an extraordinary dramatic interest for me, and\r\n    an attraction so strong that Harcourt told me that, knowing it, he\r\n    did not see how I could live out of the House of Commons. I managed\r\n    to do so, but only by shutting it for a time absolutely out of my\r\n    mind, as though it did not exist. Having the happiness of being able\r\n    to interest myself in everything, I suppose I am born to be\r\n    generally happy. You have known me so long and so closely that few\r\n    men are more aware of the kind of suffering I have gone through, but\r\n    the happiness of interest in life has rarely been wanting for long\r\n    in me, and if it were, I should go out--not of Parliament--but of\r\n    life.' [Footnote: Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice was Chairman of the\r\n    Wiltshire County Council. He had re-entered Parliament as M.P. for\r\n    North Wilts in 1898.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles never left London while the House was sitting, except for\r\nthe annual gathering of the Forest miners at the Speech House. On all\r\nother working days of the session he was to be found in the House of\r\nCommons. He held that the House offered the extremest form of interest\r\nor of boredom, according as a man did or did not follow closely all that\r\nwas going on. For this reason, the smoking-room, where most\r\nParliamentary idling is transacted, saw little of him; cigars, of which\r\nhe was a great consumer, were for periods of leisure, and he was at the\r\nHouse for business. He might be seen in the passages, going by with\r\ncoat-tails streaming behind him, most often in the members' lobby on his\r\nway to the first corridor, where was his locker--marvellously stuffed\r\nwith papers, yet kept in a methodical order that made it a general\r\ncentre of reference for himself and his colleagues, who consulted him on\r\nall subjects; or sometimes in the library, with multifarious\r\ncorrespondence and documents outspread, snipping away with a pair of\r\nscissors, after his habit, all in them that was not vitally important.\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Hudson tells how in February, 1911, after Sir Charles's\r\ndeath, he went down to clear his locker in the House of Commons, and\r\nfound it empty. Mr. Hudson surmised that, foreseeing his need for it was\r\nover, Sir Charles had himself prepared it for his successor in its use.]\r\nAgain, since one form of relaxation which he permitted himself was his\r\nafternoon cup--or cups, for they were many--of tea, the tea-room also\r\noffered a chance to those who sought him. But whoever wanted Sir Charles\r\nwent first into the Chamber itself, and in five cases out of six would\r\nfind him there alert in his corner seat below the gangway, primed and\r\narmed with documented information, and ready at any minute to interpose.\r\nEvery day he went through the whole bewildering mass of papers from\r\nwhich members are presumed to instruct themselves concerning the\r\nbusiness of the sittings and to keep a check upon the general\r\nproceedings of Government. In his case the presumption was realized.\r\nProbably no private member ever equalled him in demands for 'papers to\r\nbe laid,' and certainly none was ever better able to justify his\r\nrequests for additional information. If these requests were refused, it\r\nwas never because he wanted what was superfluous, but that which, in his\r\nhands, might become inconveniently serviceable.\r\n\r\nOne habit of his may be traced to his hatred of wasting time. The\r\ninstant a division was announced he was on his feet, hurrying so as to\r\navoid long minutes of waiting in a crush; and it came to be regarded as\r\npart of the natural order that Sir Charles should be first through the\r\nlobby.\r\n\r\nWith all this industry, the record of divisions so carefully chronicled\r\nby the hard-working M.P. was not of moment to him. If the business did\r\nnot seem to him important, he had no objection to absent himself and\r\ndine at home. He was weatherwise in the assembly, and knew the\r\nconditions which might lead to unforeseen disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn questions raised by alteration of rules or standing orders, he was\r\nnever averse from innovation, and even generally an advocate of change.\r\nBut while the rules were there he insisted rigorously on their\r\nobservance, in so far as they affected the larger interests of division\r\nor debate. Also he fulfilled punctiliously the prescribed courtesies,\r\nmaking it a usage to be down early and to secure his place, although no\r\none ever thought of appropriating it. He rigidly observed the rule,\r\ntransgressed by others, which prescribes the wearing of a tall hat by\r\nmembers in the House. The hat which was thus endeared to him by\r\ntraditional usage is therefore inseparable from Parliamentary memory of\r\nhim. He was generally to be seen handling a sheaf of papers more than\r\nMinisterial in dimensions; and he made his hat the receptacle for them;\r\noften it would be crammed to bursting before the speech had concluded.\r\nYet there remained with him always the trace of his younger days of\r\ngrave dandyism; he never abandoned the Parliamentary frock-coat, and\r\nsketches of him in the illustrated papers convey the austere correctness\r\nof its folds; and the hat from which so much service was exacted\r\nappeared each day unsurpassable in gloss.\r\n\r\nThe intricate mass of historical associations delighted his imagination\r\nat Westminster. He took pleasure in all the quaint survivals, from the\r\nlong-transmitted ceremonial of the Speaker's entrance, the formal\r\nknockings of Black Rod, the cry of 'Who goes home?' down to the still\r\ncontinued search before each session for some possible Guy Fawkes.\r\nKeenly alive to the past and to the present, he saw with special\r\npleasure any happy grafting of a new usage on to that old stock of\r\nmemories. Speaking in his constituency after the lying in state of King\r\nEdward, which he had attended (standing next to the Prime Minister as\r\nthe senior Privy Councillor present), he welcomed the precedent which\r\ngave a new association to Westminster Hall--that 'epitome of English\r\nhistory.' He recalled to his hearers the outstanding incidents and\r\npersons whose record had then come into his mind. His habit of tracing\r\nout links with the past made him at Westminster the best and most\r\nanimated of guides.\r\n\r\nSo it was in Provence, in the Forest of Dean, on the road down from\r\nLondon to Surrey; so it was always in the neighbourhood of his Chelsea\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThere could be no such companion for a ramble through its streets. His\r\nmemory, astounding in its recollections of his own time, held stories of\r\nolder records; in his eager, vivid talk the past lived again. As we\r\npassed along Cheyne Walk, George Eliot held court in her house once\r\nmore, while a few doors off Rossetti's servant pushed aside the little\r\ngrating to inspect his visitors before admission. Carlyle dwelt again in\r\nthe house in Cheyne Row, with Whistler for his neighbour. Sir Charles\r\nwould tell how earlier the Kingsley brothers lived with their father in\r\nthe old rectory, and one at least of their novels was founded afterwards\r\non the traditions of the place. Then, as layer after layer of history\r\nwas lifted, Smollett wrote his novels or walked the Chelsea streets with\r\nJohn Wilkes; Sir Richard Steele and 'his dear Prue' reinhabited their\r\nhouse, and Dr. Johnson worked at the furnaces in the cellars where\r\nChelsea china was made. [Footnote: 'Sir Charles Dilke, in hunting about\r\nfor materials for his lecture on \"Old Chelsea\" to-morrow, has made some\r\nvery interesting discoveries. He has found that part of the building\r\nonce occupied by the famous Chelsea china works, which was thought to\r\nhave gone for ever, exists as part of a public-house with a modern\r\nfrontage looking out on the Embankment. The cellars are in an admirable\r\nstate of preservation. Another interesting point has been the\r\nexploration of the old Moravian cemetery, which is now completely\r\nenclosed by houses, the ironwork of the gate worn, and, as it were,\r\neaten out by age. Here lie the bones of Count von Zinzendorf, one of the\r\nfounders of the Moravian sect, and many other famous folk. This, again,\r\nhas led to some interesting discoveries about Sir Thomas More, all of\r\nwhich will find a place in Wednesday's lecture' (Extract from _Leicester\r\nDaily Post_, January 11th, 1888, on lecture to be delivered in Town\r\nHall, Chelsea).]\r\n\r\nHe would give, as a curious illustration of the way in which many years\r\nmay be covered by a few generations, the fact that he himself had known\r\nintimately the daughter of Woodfall, printer of the _Letters of Junius_;\r\nwhile Woodfall's acquaintance included Smollett as a resident, and Pope\r\nas a visitor to Chelsea. He would talk long of Sir Thomas More,\r\n[Footnote: He writes: 'On December 18th, 1886, Cardinal Manning wrote to\r\nme: \"On Saturday last Sir Thomas More was declared both martyr and\r\nsaint, to my great joy. We have bought a house and garden, 28, Beaufort\r\nStreet, which is said to be a piece of Sir Thomas More's garden. The\r\ntradition seems probable. If you can give me any light about it, I shall\r\nbe very thankful.\"' Later (January, 1888) Sir Charles writes: 'In the\r\ncourse of this same month I lectured on Old Chelsea, and made a\r\nconsiderable attempt to clear up some points in the life of Sir Thomas\r\nMore, for whom I have a great admiration. The result was that Cardinal\r\nManning asked me to visit Father Vaughan at the house which stands on\r\nthe site of Old Beaufort House, which the Roman Catholics have purchased\r\nas a house of expiation for the martyrdom of Sir Thomas More.'] 'the\r\nfirst of Chelsea worthies,' whose memory is loved and commemorated by\r\nevery true inhabitant, and to whose voluntary poorhouse for the parish\r\nhe pointed, as the direct progenitor of the Chelsea Benevolent Society\r\nand the Board of Guardians. But one episode in More's career specially\r\nfascinated him: it was when two great lives touched, and More,\r\njourneying to Calais, met that famous lady, Margaret of Austria, the\r\nfirst Governess of the Netherlands, and negotiated the treaty between\r\nthe Emperor, England, and France, 1527. Great as was his respect for Sir\r\nHans Sloane, after whom the street in which he lived was named, and who\r\ngave to Chelsea its beautiful Physic Garden, he never forgave him the\r\ndestruction of More's house or the removal of its water gateway.\r\n\r\nHe would describe the tidal shore, as it lies in the picture which he\r\nbequeathed to the Chelsea Free Library, and which hangs on its\r\nstaircase, when below the old church the bank sloped to the water's\r\nedge; or he would pass back to the earlier time when the boats of the\r\nnobles lay there in such numbers that Charles II. described the river as\r\n'Hyde Park upon the Thames.' Once more Bess of Hardwick lived at\r\nShrewsbury House, Princess Elizabeth sheltered under the Queen's Elm; at\r\nthe old Swan in Swan Walk, Doggett founded the coat and badge to be\r\nrowed for by the watermen's apprentices 'when the tide shall be full.'\r\nThese things may be found in many a guide-book and in the lectures which\r\nhe delivered more than once in Chelsea, but told as he told them they\r\nwill never be told again.\r\n\r\nThis habit of associating the prosaic business of his daily work in\r\nParliament with picturesque traditions, and of peopling the dingy\r\nstreets of London with great figures of the past, gave colour and\r\ncharacter to his town life. He entertained still--at 76, Sloane Street,\r\nor at the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFor exercise he relied on fencing, rowing, and his morning ride. Busy\r\nmen, he held, needed what 'good exercise as contrasted with mere chamber\r\ngymnastics' could give them: 'a second life, a life in another world--\r\none which takes them entirely out of themselves, and causes them to\r\ncease to trouble others or to be troubled by the vexations of working\r\nlife.' [Footnote: _Athletics for Politicians_, reprinted from _North\r\nAmerican Review_.]\r\n\r\nHe was nowhere more characteristically English than through his faith in\r\nthis regimen, and in the pages of the _North American Review_ he\r\naddressed to American public men in 1900 an advocacy of 'Athletics for\r\nPoliticians.' This exists as a pamphlet, and some of the friends who\r\nreceived it were surprised to find themselves cited in confirmation of\r\nthe theory that nearly all English politicians, 'having been athletes as\r\nboys, have found it wise as well as pleasant to keep to some sport in\r\nlater life.' But Mr. Chamberlain, 'the most distinguished debater in the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom, who has an excellent seat on a horse,\r\nbut is never now seen on one, and who is no mean hand at lawn tennis,\r\nwhich he scarcely ever plays,' had to be cited as a heretic who thought\r\nhimself 'better without such gymnastics.'\r\n\r\nSculling on sliding-seats [Footnote: In 1873 'sliding-seats' had just\r\ntaken the place of fixed ones, and Sir Charles, having gone as usual to\r\nsee the Boat Race, criticized the crews, in a notice which he wrote, as\r\nnot having yet learnt to make the best possible use of the slide.] and\r\nrapier fencing were the exercises which Sir Charles recommended to men\r\nno longer young. He continued his fencing in London and Paris. In Paris\r\nhe frequented chiefly the school of Leconte in the Rue Saint Lazare, and\r\nalways kept an outfit there. Teachers of this school remember with\r\nwonder Sir Charles's habit of announcing, at the termination of each\r\nstay in Paris, the precise day and hour, perhaps many months ahead, at\r\nwhich he would appear--and at which, like Monte Cristo, he never failed\r\nto be exactly punctual--to the joy and amusement of the expectant\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIt was at his riverside home that he found the exercise which beyond all\r\nothers pleased him best.\r\n\r\n    '1890 I took a good deal of holiday in the summer and early autumn,\r\n    doing much rowing with McKenna and others in a racing pair; we\r\n    challenged any pair of our united ages.'\r\n\r\n'On my fifty-third birthday,' he notes, 'I began to learn sculling. My\r\nrowing, to judge by the \"clock,\" still improves. Fencing, stationary or\r\ndeclining.'\r\n\r\nHe timed himself regularly in his daily burst up and down the reach with\r\nsome first-rate oarsman, very often 'Bill' East, now the King's\r\nWaterman, whose photograph stood with one or two others on the\r\nmantelpiece of his study in Sloane Street. In the same way he kept a\r\ndaily record of his weight, which up to 1904 ranged between fourteen\r\nstone and thirteen.\r\n\r\nDockett was essentially a boating-place, a place for sun and air, where\r\nlife was lived in the open or in the wide verandah hailed by Cecil\r\nRhodes and others as the only 'stoep' in England. His son, who was\r\ntravelling abroad much at this time, shared Sir Charles Dilke's love for\r\nDockett, and was frequently there in the intervals of his journeyings.\r\nOther than boating friends came to lunch or to dine and sleep, for the\r\nmere pleasure of talk. Such were the Arnold-Forsters, the H. J.\r\nTennants, Lady Abinger (the daughter of his old friend Sir William\r\nWhite) and her husband: and there came also members of Parliament--Mr.\r\nLloyd George, or in a later day Mr. Masterman; and the knights errant of\r\npolitics, Mr. Cunninghame Graham and Mr. Schreiner. Many nationalities\r\nwere represented--often, indeed, through official personages such as M.\r\nCambon, the French Ambassador, or some member of the French Embassy.\r\nBaron Hayashi and his wife came with many other Japanese friends, and\r\nthe various representatives of the Balkan States met in pleasant\r\nconverse. It was one of these who afterwards wrote: 'I never pass the\r\nhouse in Sloane Street without raising my hat to the memory of its\r\nformer inmates.' That close friend M. Gennadius came also, and his\r\npredecessors in the Greek Legation, M. Metaxas, M. Athos Romanes, and\r\nhalf a score of other diplomatists, including Tigrane Pasha, and even\r\nRas Makonnen, who was brought to Dockett by the British representative\r\nin Abyssinia, Sir John Harrington, a friend and correspondent of Dilke.\r\nThither also for leisure, not for athletics, came Cecil Rhodes,\r\ndescribed in _Problems of Greater Britain_ as a 'modest, strong man';\r\nthere came Prince Roland Bonaparte, Coquelin, and Jules Claretie, with a\r\nhost of others, politicians, wits, and artists, English and foreign. M.\r\nClaretie thus, after Sir Charles's death, chronicled one visit:\r\n\r\n    'Nous avons canoté, mon fils et moi, sur la Tamise avec Sir Charles,\r\n    un de ces \"Sundays\" de liberté. Quand il avait bien ramé, il\r\n    rentrait au logis, et s'étendant en un petit kiosque au seuil duquel\r\n    il plaçait des sandales, l'homme d'état, ami du sport, accrochait à\r\n    la porte un écriteau où se lisait ces mots: \"Prière de faire\r\n    silence. Je dors.\" Hélas! Il dort à tout jamais maintenant le cher\r\n    Sir Charles. Ce fut une énergie, un cerveau, un coeur, une force.'\r\n    [Footnote: _Le Temps_, February, 1911.]\r\n\r\nThen there were men illustrious in another sphere, the famous oars of\r\ntheir generation. Mr. S. D. Muttlebury, most illustrious of them all,\r\nhas compiled a list of Cambridge 'blues,' young and old, who rowed with\r\nSir Charles at his riverside home. These were--\r\n\r\n                         _School_            _College_\r\nBell, A. S. ..    ..        Eton      ..   ..       Trinity Hall.\r\nBristowe, C. J.   ..

F. ..          --                         \"\r\nWauchope, D. A.   ..        Repton    ..   ..            \"\r\nWood, W. W.       ..        Eton      ..   ..       University\r\n                                                    College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn the list here given, Judge Steavenson was Sir Charles's contemporary.\r\nJudge Wood, [Footnote: He was the son of Dilke's friend and constituent,\r\nthe Rector of Newent.] his neighbour at Chertsey, known among Etonians\r\nas 'Sheep' Wood, was a University oar of the sixties, and rowed for Eton\r\nat Henley against the Trinity Hall crew which included Steavenson and\r\nDilke. But most of the others were young. Mr. Charles Boyd [Footnote:\r\nMr. Charles Boyd, C.M.G., sometime political secretary to Cecil Rhodes.]\r\nsketched the life in an article written just after Sir Charles's death:\r\n\r\n    'To know Dilke as he was you had to be with him at Dockett Eddy, on\r\n    the river. Dilke's ability is praised everywhere, but almost, one\r\n    thinks, his manly, ungushing kindness exceeded it. He could never do\r\n    enough for people, or too stealthily, as it were. He had a special\r\n    kindness for young men, for Trinity Hall men perhaps by preference;\r\n    the black and white blazer of his old college carried a certain\r\n    prescriptive right to share in every belonging of the most famous of\r\n    old Hall men. But many, oars or others, at different times in the\r\n    past fifteen to twenty years, as sons of the house, spent between\r\n    Shepperton and Chertsey Locks, or on the tennis lawns among Sir\r\n    Charles's famous willows, or lying on deck-chairs on the long, deep\r\n    verandah, the happiest and healthiest of week-ends or more extended\r\n    summer holidays. There are few pleasanter reaches of our river, and\r\n    none quieter, than this, for the rush and the intolerable crowds are\r\n    above stream or below stream, but not here. And there is no such\r\n    holiday house for young men as Dockett, hidden in its willow walks\r\n    and islanded by the Thames in front and by the expanse of Chertsey\r\n    Mead behind.\r\n\r\n    'Less a country-house, indeed, than a camp of exercise. You did as\r\n    you pleased, but under Sir Charles's guidance you were pleased to be\r\n    strenuous. He called everybody to bathe at 7 a.m., and where was\r\n    ever better fresh-water bathing-place than the floating raft below\r\n    the boat-house at Dockett? Etiquette required you to dive in and go\r\n    straight across to the other bank, touch, and return; when, like as\r\n    not, Sir Charles, in shorts and sweater, might be seen very\r\n    precisely preparing tea on the landing-stage for the deserving\r\n    valiant. His little kindnesses had an added and affecting quality\r\n    from his reserve and sternness. A rare figure of an athlete he was,\r\n    and a rare athlete's day his was in that retreat. For hours before\r\n    he called and turned out the morning guard he had been up busy\r\n    gardening, or reading, or writing. At a quarter to nine he\r\n    breakfasted. Very shortly after breakfast an ex-champion sculler the\r\n    admirable Bill East, would arrive from Richmond, and he and Sir\r\n    Charles would row in a racing skiff a measured mile or more of the\r\n    river. One summer at least he changed from rowing kit to boots and\r\n    breeches after his rowing, and rode till luncheon. At four o'clock\r\n    there would be a second bout with East, and thereafter, having\r\n    changed from his rowing kit into flannels and his Hall cap, he would\r\n    take Lady Dilke in her dinghy, which nobody else has ever used or\r\n    will use.\r\n\r\n    'After these exercises came dinner, and after dinner talk; and what\r\n    talk! How his intellectual weight and equipment affected those who\r\n    were much with him as young men, and who had a chance to revise\r\n    their impressions after years of close observation of the world and\r\n    its big men, a scrap of dialogue may illustrate. One who in his\r\n    \"twenties\" was much at Sloane Street and Dockett, and who passed\r\n    later into close working relations with several at least of the most\r\n    conspicuous, so to say, of Front Bench men in the Empire, after an\r\n    interval of thirteen years sat once more for a whole long evening\r\n    with three others at the feet of Gamaliel. A well-known scholar and\r\n    historian put questions which drew Sir Charles out; and all were\r\n    amazed and delighted by the result. After Sir Charles had gone, one\r\n    of the others, a distinguished editor, said to the wanderer: \"Come,\r\n    you have known the Mandarins as well as anybody. Where do you put\r\n    Dilke with them?\" \"Well, I rule Lord Milner out,\" said ----: \"but\r\n    all the others, compared to Sir Charles, strike me in point of\r\n    knowledge, if you must know, as insufficiently informed school-\r\n    boys.\" That is how his brain struck this contemporary. As for the\r\n    moral qualities observed, you get to know a man well when you see\r\n    him constantly and over years at play. And what intimate's affection\r\n    and respect for Sir Charles, and confidence in him, did not grow\r\n    greater with every year? It seems admitted that he was a great man.\r\n    Well, if there is anything in the intimate, not undiscerning\r\n    impression of nearly eighteen years, he was a good man, or goodness\r\n    is an empty name.'\r\n\r\nAnother account of his talk and ways comes from Mr. Spenser Wilkinson:\r\n\r\n    'I moved to London in 1892, and from that time on found the intimacy\r\n    with Dilke one of the delights of life. We used always to meet,\r\n    either for breakfast or lunch, at Dilke's house in Sloane Street, or\r\n    for lunch at the Prince's Restaurant in Piccadilly, or at 2.30 in\r\n    the lobby of the House of Commons. I was also frequently a guest at\r\n    the dinner-parties either at Sloane Street on Wednesdays, when Lady\r\n    Dilke was alive, or at the House of Commons. Then there were small\r\n    house-parties on Saturday and Sunday at Dockett Eddy, near\r\n    Shepperton on the Thames, where Sir Charles had built two cottages,\r\n    and where a guest was expected to do exactly what he pleased from\r\n    the time when he was punted across the river on arrival until he\r\n    left the punt on departing. In winter I used to bicycle over to the\r\n    cottage at Pyrford, where Dilke and his wife were always to be found\r\n    alone and where I spent many a charming afternoon.\r\n\r\n    'Every man takes a certain tinge from the medium in which he is, and\r\n    is therefore different in different company and different\r\n    surroundings. I knew three Dilkes. First there was the statesman,\r\n    the man of infinite information which he was ever working to\r\n    increase. When you went to see him it was on some particular\r\n    subject; he wanted precise information, and knew exactly what he\r\n    wanted. With him my business was always finished in five minutes,\r\n    after which I used to feel that I should be wasting his time if I\r\n    stayed. This Dilke, in this particular form of intercourse, was by\r\n    far the ablest man I ever met.\r\n\r\n    'Then came Dilke the host, the Dilke of general conversation. Here\r\n    again he towered above his fellows. The man who had been everywhere\r\n    and knew everybody--for there seemed to be no public man of great\r\n    importance in any country with whom Dilke was not acquainted and\r\n    with whom he had not corresponded--a man who was almost always in\r\n    high spirits and full of fun, had an inexhaustible fund of\r\n    delightful conversation, about which the only drawback was that, in\r\n    order to appreciate it, you had to be uncommonly well informed\r\n    yourself.\r\n\r\n    'But the Dilke I liked best was the one I used to have to myself\r\n    when I spent a day with him either in the country or on the river,\r\n    when neither of us had anything to do, when there was no business in\r\n    hand, and when we either talked or were silent according to the\r\n    mood. In these circumstances Dilke was as natural and simple as a\r\n    civilized man can be. If one started an uncongenial subject, he\r\n    would say. \"It does not interest me,\" but the moment one approached\r\n    any of the matters he cared for he mobilized all his resources and\r\n    gave himself with as little reserve as possible.\r\n\r\n    'Dilke was a past-master in the art of ordering his time, and this\r\n    was the secret of the vast quantity of work which he was able to do.\r\n    He was a voracious and quick reader, as is proved by the number of\r\n    books which he used to review for the _Athenaeum_, of which he was\r\n    proprietor. Yet he was an early riser and went to bed early, and a\r\n    part of his day was given to exercise.\r\n\r\n    'A great deal of time was consumed in interviews with all sorts and\r\n    conditions of men, and his attendance at the House of Commons,\r\n    constant and assiduous, accounted for a large part of half the days\r\n    in the year. But everything was mapped out in advance; he would make\r\n    appointments weeks, or even months, in advance, and keep them to the\r\n    minute. His self-control was complete, his courtesy constant and\r\n    unvarying; he was entirely free from sentimentality and the least\r\n    demonstrative of mankind, yet he was capable of delicate and tender\r\n    feelings, not always detected by those towards whom they were\r\n    directed. He was simple, straightforward, frank, and generous. It\r\n    was delightful to do business with him, for he never hesitated nor\r\n    went back upon himself. Modest and free from self-consciousness, he\r\n    was aware both of his powers and of their limitations. I once tried\r\n    to persuade him to change the manner of his Parliamentary speeches,\r\n    to stop his minute expositions of facts and to make some appeal to\r\n    the emotions of his hearers--at any rate in cases where he had\r\n    strong feelings of his own. He made one experiment in accord with\r\n    this suggestion, and told me that it had been most successful; but\r\n    he said that he would not try it again, because it was not in accord\r\n    with his natural bent, and he was unwilling to be anything but\r\n    himself.'\r\n\r\nDockett was the home of the Birds. Sir Charles's evidence before the\r\nSelect Committee on the Thames as to the destruction of kingfishers led\r\nto a prohibition of all shooting on the river, and to an increase of\r\nthese lovely birds. In 1897 he had two of their nests at Dockett Eddy.\r\nHis acres of willow-grown all-but-island were made a sanctuary for\r\nbirds, and therefore from Dockett only, of all his homes, cats were kept\r\naway. Nests were counted and cherished; it was a great year when a\r\ncuckoo's egg was discovered among the linnet's clutch, and its\r\ndevelopment was watched in breathless interest. Owls were welcome\r\nvisitors; and the swans had no better nesting-place on the Thames than\r\nthe lower end of Dockett. They and their annual progeny of cygnets were\r\nthe appointed charge of Jim Haslett, Dilke's ferryman and friend.\r\nPensioners upon the house, they used to appear in stately progress\r\nbefore the landing raft--the mother perhaps with several little ones\r\nswarming on her back or nestling in her wings, and from time to time\r\nsplashing off into the water. Always at their appearance, in answer to\r\nSir Charles's special call, a cry of 'Swan's bread' would be raised, and\r\nloaf after loaf would disappear down their capacious throats. A place\r\nwith such privileges was not likely to be undisputed, and many times\r\nthere were battles royal against 'invaders from the north,' as Sir\r\nCharles called the Chertsey swans who came to possess themselves of the\r\nDockett reach and its amenities. Swan charged swan, with plumage\r\nbristling and wings dilated, but not alone they fought; Jim Haslett and\r\nhis employer took part against the invaders, beating them off with\r\nsticks; and even in the night, when sound of that warfare rose, the\r\nmaster of Dockett was known to scull out in a dinghy, in his night gear,\r\ncarrying a bedroom candlestick to guide his blows in the fray.\r\n\r\nEvening and morning he would steal along the bank in his dinghy,\r\ncounting and observing the water-voles, which he was accustomed to feed\r\nwith stewed prunes and other dishes, while they sat nibbling,\r\nsquirrel-like, with the dainty clasped in their hands.\r\n\r\nA few gay beds of annuals by the house, a purple clematis on the\r\nverandah, and a mass of syringa at the landing-stage, were all the\r\ngarden permitted; roughly mown grass paths here and there led through\r\nthe wild growth of nature, where the willows met overhead.\r\n\r\nSuch was his summer home, described in the lines of Tibullus which were\r\ncarved on the doorway of the larger house:\r\n\r\n  'Jam modo iners possim epntentus vivere parvo\r\n  Nec semper longae deditus esse viae,\r\n  Sed canis aestivos ortus vitare sub umbra\r\n  Arboris, ad rivos praetereuntis aquae.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Thus translated by the Rev. W. Tuckwell:\r\n\r\n  'Here, fancy-free, and scorning needless show,\r\n    Let me from Life's dull round awhile retreat,\r\n  Lulled by the full-charged stream's unceasing flow,\r\n    Screened by tall willows from the dog-star's heat.']\r\n\r\nHe guarded its quiet, and, champion as he had always been of the public\r\nright of common on land and on the river, he was resentful when its\r\nprivilege was carelessly abused. He rebuked those who broke the rules of\r\nthe river in his marches--above all, such as disturbed swans or pulled\r\nwater-lilies. After every Bank Holiday he would spend a laborious day\r\ngathering up the ugly leavings.\r\n\r\nMany associations endeared to him what he thus defended. When he was out\r\nin the skiff, darting here and there, Lady Dilke, in the little dinghy\r\nwhich he had caused to be built for her--called from its pleasant round\r\nlines the _Bumble Bee_--would paddle about the reach. After her death he\r\nwould paddle out in the dinghy which no one else might take out, and lie\r\nfor hours watching the light change on that familiar and tranquil beauty\r\nof green mead and shining water, of high-waving poplar and willow, with\r\ndrooping boughs awash. When he also was gone, the little boat was not\r\nsuffered to pass into the use of strangers, but burnt there on the bank.\r\n\r\nIn his other home at Pyrford, all the day's relaxations were of this\r\nintimate kind. [Footnote: Here, too, work was disturbed by his natural\r\nhistory researches. He writes apologetically to Mr. Hudson as to some\r\nmistake in a letter: 'I can plead as a disturbing cause three young\r\nbrown owls, quite tame; one barks, and two whistle, squeak--between a\r\nrailway guard and a door-hinge. The barker lets me get within four or\r\nfive feet before he leaves off yapping. He worries the cuckoo into\r\nshouting very late. I leave the owls unwillingly, late--one night 1 a.m.\r\nThey are still going strong.'] Here also was no formal garden; Nature\r\nhad her way, but under superintendence of a student of forestry. Sir\r\nCharles was a planter of pines; great notebooks carefully filled tell\r\nhow he studied, before the planting, the history of each species, how he\r\nwatched over the experiments and extended them. [Footnote: Here is a\r\ndetail entered concerning Lawson's cypress--_Erecta vividis_: 'I\r\nremember Andrew Murray, of the Royal Horticultural, first describing\r\nLawson's cypress, introduced by his brother in 1862, when my father was\r\nchairman of the society of which Murray was secretary. Our two are\r\ngardener's varieties, one greener and the other bluer than the true\r\nLawson. The American name is Port Orford cedar. It will not do very well\r\non our bad soil, but I've given it a pretty good place. It is said that\r\nMurray _first_ sent it to Lawson of Edinburgh in 1854. This variety was\r\nmade by A. Waterer in 1870.']\r\n\r\nIn summer, on the dry heathy commons of Surrey, there is always danger\r\nof a chance fire spreading, and it was part of his care to maintain a\r\ncleared belt for fending off this danger. Much of his day went in\r\ngathering débris and undergrowth, so as to keep clear ground about the\r\ntrees, and then the heaped-up gatherings rewarded him with a bonfire in\r\nwhich he had a child's pleasure, mingled with an artist's appreciation\r\nof the shapes and colours of flame. It was for praise of this beauty\r\nthat he specially loved Anatole France's _Rôtisserie de la Reine\r\nPédauque_, with its celebrations of the salamanders and their vivid\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nThe heath blossom in all its kinds was cultivated, and it was his\r\ninvariable custom to come up on a Monday from Pyrford with a spray of\r\nhis favourite white heather in his buttonhole.\r\n\r\nHere, too, were associations, interesting if not exactly historic. The\r\nBattle of Dorking was fought close by, and in this neighbourhood the\r\nMartians descended.\r\n\r\nChief of Pyrford's distinctions was the discovery on Sir Charles's own\r\nland, by Mr. Horace Donisthorpe, of a beetle (Lomechusa) which in Queen\r\nAnne's day Sir Hans Sloane had first identified in Hampstead, parasitic\r\nin a nest of red ants. A second specimen was found in 1710 in the mail-\r\ncoach between Gloucester and Cheltenham; but from Queen Anne's day till\r\n1906 it was regarded as extinct, until once more it was discovered, and\r\ndiscovered in its true place among the ants, on whose gestures and\r\nbehaviour towards it, whether as indicating worship or serfdom, Sir\r\nCharles dilated with such rhetoric of description that the beetle\r\nassumed dimensions in the mind disappointing when it was viewed in\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nAnother rarity of insect life at Pyrford was a spider whose appearances\r\nhave been oftenest noted at Hampton Court. These creatures, large,\r\nblack, and horrific, were accordingly known as 'Hampton Courters,' but\r\nreceived no welcome, being slain on sight, their slayer quoting a\r\ncharacteristic saying which he had heard from Anatole France:\r\n\r\n    'We all know of dangers which seem more terrible than they are. The\r\n    spider alone suffers death for his carelessness as to this habit of\r\n    exaggeration. Many an uncle spider walks about by candlelight, and\r\n    is slain by us on account of his monstrous shadow, whereas his body,\r\n    being but small, would have escaped our rage.'\r\n\r\nIt was here that much of his Memoir was dictated, based on an enormous\r\nmass of letters, papers, and private diaries, kept throughout his\r\nGovernment career. After 1891 there is only a scattered series of\r\nentries, increasingly sparse as time went on. Mr. Hudson recalls their\r\nwalks from the station at Woking to Pyrford across the then open common,\r\nthe lunch of eggs and milk, and the hours of work, during the period\r\nbetween the publication of _Problems of Greater Britain_ and Sir\r\nCharles's return to Parliament for the Forest of Dean.\r\n\r\nThese two country homes, Pyrford and Dockett, held Sir Charles so fast\r\nwith their simple pleasures that the once insatiable traveller ceased to\r\nroam. At the close of 1892, after his return to Parliament, he sold his\r\nhouse and garden at Toulon. Pyrford to a great extent had come to take\r\nits place. But to the end of his days he was a constant visitor to that\r\nProvençal country which he loved. Apart from them there was another\r\nplace where, though he neither owned nor rented house or land, he was no\r\nless at home than among his willows or his pines. No resident in the\r\nForest of Dean was better known in it than its member, and nowhere had\r\nSir Charles more real friends. For many years he spent three periods\r\namong them: his Whitsun holiday, which was very much a visit of\r\npleasure; a visit in autumn, when he attended all meetings of the\r\nRevision Courts; and finally a month in the dead of winter, when he went\r\nround to meetings in each polling district, at night educating his\r\nelectors in the political questions of the time, and in the day working\r\nwith his local friends at the register till it became the most accurate\r\nrecord of its kind in all Great Britain--so perfect, indeed, that he was\r\nat last able to discontinue his attendance at the Revision Courts,\r\nthough never relaxing his keen personal interest in every change.\r\n\r\nHis friendships in the Forest were not bounded by class or party. He had\r\nthe support, not merely of the Liberal and Labour groups, but of many\r\nstrong Conservatives, here as before at Chelsea. Mention has been made\r\nof Mr. Blake, and another friend was Mr. John Probyn, who had stood as a\r\nLiberal candidate for Devizes as far back as 1868, and had not changed\r\nhis views. Of his many faithful friends and supporters, one, the\r\nhonorary secretary of the Liberal Association for all Sir Charles's\r\nyears of membership, had as far back as 1886 proclaimed his faith in\r\nhim. [Footnote: Mr. John Cooksey, formerly proprietor of the _Dean\r\nForest Mercury_.] Another equally active in conveying the original\r\ninvitation to Sir Charles was the agent of the Forest miners, a Labour\r\nleader of the wisest type, [Footnote: Mr. G. H. Rowlinson.] who writes:\r\n\r\n    'He did not live for himself; it was always others first. I never\r\n    made an appeal to him for any case of need in vain. With regard to\r\n    local matters, he seemed at the beck and call of nearly everyone.\r\n    Nothing was too small or too large for him to undertake to assist\r\n    any constituent, and oftentimes an avowed and lifelong political\r\n    opponent. In a multitude of ways he did us service with his\r\n    knowledge of affairs, his influence, his experience, his ability and\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    'In the matters of commoners' right, the right of \"turnout\" on the\r\n    Forest, free miners' rights, questions of colliery owners, matters\r\n    relating to the Crown, the development of the lower coal seams--in\r\n    all these (and many of them are local intricate historical questions\r\n    involving a mass of detail) he rendered valuable service.\r\n\r\n    'In his electoral battles he was always a keen fighter and a\r\n    courteous opponent. In every campaign he seemed more anxious to beat\r\n    his opponent by sheer weight of reason and argument, and intellect\r\n    and knowledge, than by any appeal to party passion or feeling.\r\n\r\n    'I have been at a great many of his meetings, and never saw him\r\n    shirk a question, nor saw one put to him that he did not, nine times\r\n    out of ten, know more about than the questioner, however local the\r\n    point might be.\r\n\r\n    'As an example, he was holding a meeting at Newnham. Questions were\r\n    invited; none asked. Sir Charles looked disappointed; so Mr. King,\r\n    of the \"Victoria,\" in a friendly way, thought he would put him a\r\n    poser, and asked his opinion about Sir Cuthbert Quilter's Pure Beer\r\n    Bill.\r\n\r\n    'For about twenty minutes Sir Charles talked beer--the origin,\r\n    ingredients, what it should be, what it often is and what it is not,\r\n    what it is in other countries. As Mr. King remarked afterwards, he\r\n    told him more about beer than he ever knew before, though he had\r\n    been in the trade all his life.'\r\n\r\nProbably none was more rejoiced at the unexpected display than the\r\ngenial Tory host of the Victoria, who lived to deplore his friend and to\r\nquote especially one of his observations: 'If you see a man put on\r\n\"side,\" Sir Charles once said to me, you may be sure he feels the need\r\nof it.' [Footnote: Among those who worked with him and for him best and\r\nlongest should be named at least Mr. Charles Ridler and Mr. T. A. H.\r\nSmith of Lydney, Mr. Henry Davis of Newent, Mr. B. H. Taylor, and Mr. S.\r\nJ. Elsom.]\r\n\r\nPart of the service which he rendered to the constituency was by means\r\nof the honorary presidency of the Liberal Four Hundred, first created,\r\nto be held by himself, in 1889. Under this title the foremost spokesmen\r\nof Liberalism were in successive years brought into the Forest;\r\n[Footnote: The list included Mr. Asquith, Lord Morley, Mr. McKenna, Mr.\r\nLloyd George, and Lord Loreburn.] and thus member and constituents\r\nworked together alike in political and in personal friendship. He hailed\r\nthe little clump of trees on the conical top of Mayhill, the first\r\nlandmark which indicated the Forest, almost as if it stood above his\r\nhome. All was homelike to him as he drove from the pastoral country by\r\nthe Severn, with its apple and pear orchards, to the typical mining town\r\nof Cinderford, and on to the great expanse of Forest in whose midmost\r\nglade was the Speech House Hotel, more ancient than the hollies about\r\nit, which had been planted to mark Charles II.'s Restoration. The\r\nPanelled Room, always reserved for his use during his stay there, had\r\nbeen for many generations the place in which the free miners met to hold\r\ntheir courts; it had been built for the purpose, as the gallery for\r\nspeakers showed.\r\n\r\nHe loved the Forest--not only the distant spots of interest, but every\r\ntree, delighting to act as guide to all its pleasant places. So each new\r\nguest was taken to see High Beeches and the great wind-swept row of\r\nScots firs by Clearwell Court. The aged oak-tree, which at a distance\r\nresembled a barn--for nothing was left but its great trunk above the\r\nroots--was another point of pilgrimage; so were the dwarf thorns on\r\nWigpool Common, which reminded him of the tiny Japanese trees centuries\r\nold, as, indeed, probably were these.\r\n\r\nThen there were the expeditions to the rocking stone called the\r\nBuckstone, a relic of the Druids; to the Scowles, the wonderful Roman\r\niron workings like the Syracusan quarries; to Symons Yat, where the old\r\nmilitary earthworks ended in a triple dyke, with the Severn and the Wye\r\non either side; to Newland Church, in which a fifteenth-century brass\r\nshows the free miner of those days equipped for work; or to the lovely\r\nvalley by Flaxley Abbey, once in the precincts of the Forest, where the\r\nmonks had their fish-ponds, and where on the side of the hills their old\r\nironworks may still be seen.\r\n\r\nHe and Lady Dilke rode early in their stay to all these outlying places,\r\nwith Miss Monck as their constant companion. She was President of the\r\nWomen's Liberal Association, stayed with them during their long visits\r\nto the Forest, and was with him for the election at the end. [Footnote:\r\nMiss Emilia Monck, sister of Mr. Berkeley Monck, of Coley Park, Heading,\r\nof which he was several times Mayor, and which he contested as a Liberal\r\nin 1886.]\r\n\r\nThese were far rides, but close about the Speech House the place teems\r\nwith interest. In the last years he would walk every evening to look at\r\nthe great stag-headed ruins of the oaks, which thrust their gnarled and\r\ncrooked limbs fantastically into the closing night, or stand watching\r\nthe shadows fall on the spruce rides which stretch out near the old inn,\r\ntill, in the fading light, it seemed as though figures were moving in\r\nand out on the greensward of the great vistas. In the bright sunshine,\r\nimposing silence on himself and his companions, he would watch for long\r\ntogether the life in one of the forest glades, the moving creatures in\r\nthe grass, the tits playing on the branches of a silver birch\r\nsilhouetted against the sky, the little blue butterflies chasing each\r\nother over the pink crab-apple bloom. He would follow the tapping of a\r\nwoodpecker, and wait in the evening for the owl's cry to begin; and\r\nhere, as elsewhere, to be with him was to see in everything unsuspected\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, Speech House was at first Sir Charles's headquarters for\r\npart of January, but there, 500 feet above the sea, the roads were\r\nsometimes impassable from snow. At last Lady Dilke became too delicate\r\nto face the mid-winter visit, and, except for elections, Whitsuntide and\r\nthe autumn were the two occasions for their stay. He went also each year\r\nto the miners' demonstration--in 1908 so ill that it seemed impossible\r\nthat even his power of endurance could enable him to bear the strain,\r\nand in 1910 again because he said he 'would not fail Rowlinson and the\r\nminers,' though he fainted after the meeting there.\r\n\r\nOne of their early headquarters in the Forest was Lindors, the home of\r\ntwo among their first and warmest friends--Mr. Frederick Martin and his\r\nwife. It is in a lovely little valley with sheltered lawns, the rush of\r\nthe water sounding always behind the house, above which the old castle\r\nof St. Briavels stands. The ancient prison is still there, and the\r\ncastle dates back to the thirteenth century, and claims an almost\r\nunbroken succession of Constables of the Castle and Wardens of the\r\nForest of Dean, beginning with John de Monmouth.\r\n\r\nAfter Speech House the Victoria at Newnham saw them oftenest. Its\r\ninterior is fascinating, with a low hall and fine old oak stairway,\r\nbroad and shallow; a bit of quaint French glass let into the staircase\r\nwindow bears an illustrated version of La Fourmi et la Cigale. Lady\r\nDilke found there a remnant of fine tapestry--a battle scene with a bold\r\npicture of horses and their riders. She traced and located this as\r\nbelonging to a great panel which is in the Palace at Madrid. At each\r\nelection, after the declaration of the poll, Sir Charles made from a\r\nbalcony of the Victoria or from a motor-car his speech to the cheering\r\nconstituents, who had followed him from the town-hall, first under\r\nhappiest circumstance, with his wife waiting for him in the porch, later\r\nalone, till the last occasion, in December, 1910, when he fought and won\r\nthe election, dying, but with dogged courage; and as he spoke of the\r\nlong term of Liberal government which would ensue before a new electoral\r\nstruggle, friends standing near caught the words, 'When I shall not be\r\nhere.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Charles had given up the habit of travel except for some special\r\npurpose, as when in 1897 he journeyed with Lady Dilke to see the\r\nNattiers at Stockholm, or in another year to Bordeaux for her work on\r\nFrench Art in the Eighteenth Century. But every Christmas they went for\r\na month to Paris. It was the great holiday of their year, and all the\r\nengagements were made far ahead. There was interest in their Parisian\r\nassociations, for their differing attainments made them part of various\r\nseparate coteries not familiarly accessible to English people.\r\n\r\nTheir friends were of all worlds, political, literary, artistic, and\r\nsocial; and since Sir Charles's intimacy with France dated back to\r\nboyhood, and Lady Dilke's to the days of her first close study of French\r\nart, which, beginning in the sixties with the French Renaissance,\r\nterminated in her big work on French Art in the Eighteenth Century,\r\ntheir friendships extended over a long period of years, though each\r\nfresh visit enlarged their circle of friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nIn the memoir prefixed to her _Book of the Spiritual Life_ Sir Charles\r\nsays of his wife:\r\n\r\n'Those who are familiar with several languages learn instinctively to\r\ntake the natural manners of the people who are for the moment their\r\ncompanions. So it was with Lady Dilke.... In Paris she was French with\r\nsufficient difference to give distinction.' As to himself, his great\r\nfriend M. Joseph Reinach wrote, 'Dilke connaissait la France mieux que\r\nbeaucoup d'entre nous.' But while his command of the French language and\r\nhis knowledge of many sides of French life quickened his genial\r\nintercourse with the French, he never failed to impress them as an\r\nEnglish statesman. He paid his French friends the compliment of adopting\r\nmany little mannerisms; and however pure the French he spoke, he always\r\nentertained himself by keeping up to date his acquaintance with French\r\nslang, so that the latest developments of fashionable Paris jargon were\r\nfamiliar to him. Yet that never could be said of him which he himself\r\nnoted of his friend M. Richard Waddington, brother to William\r\nWaddington, for many years Ambassador in London, and, in Sir Charles's\r\nopinion, a man of even higher ability than the Ambassador. Of this\r\nfriend, half French, half English, he said that he had two mentalities,\r\nand that among Englishmen he was English, among Frenchmen French. Sir\r\nCharles's talk with Frenchmen was unrestrained; as Bismarck felt of\r\nEngland, so he of France: 'We have nothing to conceal from the French;\r\nthey are our natural allies.' But it was always the Englishman who\r\nspoke; no slight veneer of manner in his social intercourse could\r\nconceal that.\r\n\r\nThere are many scattered entries in his Diary which show how great a\r\nrelaxation the Paris holiday yielded.\r\n\r\n    'At Christmas at Paris we were always gay, though often among the\r\n    aged. The gayest dinner I remember was at Henri Germain's with\r\n    Gérôme, Gaston Boissier, Laboulaye, and others, all about eighty, I\r\n    being the chicken of the party.'\r\n\r\nGérôme, the painter, is often mentioned. Laboulaye must have been Paul\r\nLaboulaye, born 1833, the diplomatist who had been Ambassador to St.\r\nPetersburg in 1886. It was during his embassy that the _rapprochement_\r\ntook place between France and Russia which was announced to Europe by\r\nthe welcome of the French fleet to Cronstadt.\r\n\r\nGaston Boissier, Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy, and a great\r\nclassical scholar, figures again with another friend, M. Bonnat, in Sir\r\nCharles's memoir of his wife; for he notes that during their last\r\nChristmas in Paris, in 1903, 'the gaiety of their meetings' with these\r\ntwo friends and others 'had been as unrestrained as ever.' Earlier\r\nmemories recall the sculptors Christophe and Gustave Moreau.\r\nChristophe's beautiful 'Mask,' of which Lady Dilke had written, stands\r\nin the Tuileries Garden, and was some time ago horribly disfigured by\r\ninkstain. One of Sir Charles's late letters was written to M. Joseph\r\nReinach, to ask whether anything had yet been done to cleanse this work\r\nof the sculptor she venerated. Only two small casts were made by\r\nChristophe from the statue, and one of these, given to her by him,\r\ndecorated the Pyrford home. So did a picture by François Louis Français,\r\nanother artist friend, chief in his day of the water-colour school, a\r\npicture which had inspired one of her stories, and gave the motto,\r\n'Dites-moi un Pater,' to her _Shrine of Death_. In all the later and in\r\nsome of the earlier friendships Sir Charles shared, as he did in those\r\nof the great custodians of art treasures. M. de Nolhac, the poet and the\r\nCurator of Versailles, was prominent among them, and Eugène Müntz, head\r\nof the École des Beaux Arts. Lady Dilke's correspondence with the\r\nlatter, extending over a period of twenty-three years, is preserved at\r\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\nOne great friend among collectors was M. Gustave Dreyfus, a high\r\nauthority on Donatello and on the medallists of the Italian Renaissance.\r\nAt his house there was another attraction in the shape of the\r\nconcierge's cat, on whom Sir Charles would call before paying his\r\nrespects upstairs. At another house a cat named Pouf was held in great\r\nhonour by him, and his feelings were deeply wounded when, with feline\r\ncapriciousness, it turned, on Paul Hervieu's entrance, to bestow all its\r\nblandishments on the writer. His love of cats was as well known to his\r\nFrench as to his English friends, Émile Ollivier writes in 1891 from La\r\nMoutte: 'Campion lui-même cherche d'un regard affligé son protecteur\r\ndisparu'; and M. André Chevrillon, being 'touché par la façon dont je\r\nvous ai entendu parler de ce divin animal,' sent him Taine's sonnets 'A\r\ntrois chats, Puss, Ébène, et Mitonne, dédiés par leur ami, maître, et\r\nserviteur.'\r\n\r\nMemorials of dinners with the well-known collector Camille Groult were\r\npreserved in the shape of some sketches, one of a cavalier in peruke and\r\ncravat, another an excellent crayon head of the host, by Domingo, the\r\nSpanish artist, drawn on the back of a torn menu and given by him to\r\nLady Dilke.\r\n\r\nThe Groults' admiration of the beauty of Dockett Eddy was testified in\r\nthe gift of a little reflecting mirror, a 'camera obscura,' which, held\r\nto the light, made exquisite vignettes of river, clematis, and syringa;\r\nand a dinner at 76, Sloane Street was marked by the gift of little\r\ncopies of M. Groult's famous lately acquired Fragonard, in which Cupid\r\nlevels his arrows at the dainty feet of a well-known dancer of the time.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor Rodin was an acquaintance of late years, and a Christmas\r\ncard sent to 76, Sloane Street, in the form of a framed and signed\r\npencil sketch of a female head, was that master's tribute to Sir\r\nCharles's heresy that Rodin drew much better than he sculptured.\r\n\r\n'For old Français,' says Sir Charles, 'Lady Dilke had the veneration she\r\nfelt for Christophe among sculptors,' and for a few women, such as Mme.\r\nRenan. To both the Renans they were bound by ties of familiar\r\nfriendship, and some of their pleasantest hours were spent at the\r\nCollège de France. On November 11th, 1880, there is a note of Sir\r\nCharles's of a talk with Gambetta: 'They discussed Renan's \"Souvenirs,\"\r\nwhich were appearing in the _Revue_ for November, wonderfully\r\nentertaining, and perfectly beautiful in style.' It was Renan who had\r\npresented Lady Dilke's two volumes on the French Renaissance, in 1880,\r\nto the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, with an admiring\r\nreport, and Sir Charles's admiration for Renan's writing was great. Of\r\nMme. Renan he says: 'This homely-looking old dame was not only a good\r\nwife, but a woman of the soundest sense and the most upright judgment.'\r\n\r\nThe same feeling of attachment and respect bound them to Mme. de\r\nFranqueville, [Footnote: Mlle. Érard.] the first wife of Sir Charles's\r\nold friend M. de Franqueville, whom he saw often both in Paris and\r\nLondon. They visited them at La Muette, famous for its memories of Marie\r\nAntoinette, where in the early years of her prosperity she would take\r\nher companions to play at dairying with dainty emblazoned milkpails.\r\n\r\nOne whose friendship dated far back was Émile Ollivier, and with him Sir\r\nCharles often discussed, both in Paris and at St. Tropez, a vanished era\r\nin France's history, that of the 'Liberal Empire.' To these talks the\r\nPrime Minister of Napoleon III. would bring such wealth of oratory and\r\nsuch fertility of gesticulation that his hearers felt themselves\r\ntransported to a crowded chamber, of which he occupied the rostrum, and\r\nwoke with bewilderment to find themselves in the tranquil calm of his\r\nsun-flooded Southern home. There were those who said that the point of\r\nview urged with such conviction varied, and Sir Charles retains a _mot_\r\nof M. Jusserand: 'Émile Ollivier change souvent d'idée fixe.' Mme. Émile\r\nOllivier, his devoted second wife and helper, was also a great friend,\r\nand her photograph was one of those which Lady Dilke kept near her.\r\n\r\n'Relations of the pleasantest kind,' says Sir Charles, were formed with\r\nthe Due d'Aumale, in Mr. Bodley's phrase 'last of the grands seigneurs\r\nof France.' On September 25th, 1895, the Duke wrote asking them 'to\r\nspend a whole day going through the books at Chantilly.' 'The charm of\r\nthese books, however, and of these repeated visits of 1895 and 1896, lay\r\nin the fact that books and drawings alike excited historic memory.'\r\n\r\n    'In October, 1895, we were in Paris, and took Went [Footnote: Sir\r\n    Charles Dilke's son, the present Sir C. Wentworth Dilke.] to stay at\r\n    Vaux, that he might see the finest of the châteaux, and also the\r\n    room where, according to Dumas, Aramis and Porthos carried off Louis\r\n    XIV., though d'Artagnan saved him again. We also went ourselves to\r\n    lunch at Chantilly with the Due d'Aumale, who told us how Mme.\r\n    Adélaïde, his aunt, used to slap his brother, the Prince de\r\n    Joinville, already a distinguished naval officer, and stop his\r\n    talking politics with, \"Tais-toi, méchant morveux, qui oses\r\n    critiquer la politique de ton père.\" Comtesse Berthe de Clinchamp\r\n    has looked after the house since the days of the Duchesse d'Aumale,\r\n    though she lives in another house. This distinguished old dame was\r\n    also there. A daughter of the Due de Chartres was once slapped by\r\n    her aunt, the Comtesse de Paris, in public, for asking to be taken\r\n    to stay at Chantilly with \"tante de Clinchamp.\" In 1896 to 1897 we\r\n    were a great deal at Chantilly, finding the Duke interesting with\r\n    his reminiscences of his father's account of the Court of Louis XVI.\r\n    With the ex-King of Westphalia, and Bismarck, the Duc d'Aumale was\r\n    in old age the most interesting companion that I have known. It was\r\n    the projecting of his stories into a newer generation that made them\r\n    good. Sir S. Smith (\"Long Acre\") was a bore at the Congress of\r\n    Vienna, but would have been delightful to us could we have known\r\n    him.' [Footnote: Sir Sidney Smith must have been prolix over his\r\n    achievements at the siege of Acre and elsewhere. It is certain that\r\n    a reputation for bombast injured his career and caused his\r\n    remarkable achievements to be underrated.]\r\n\r\nWhen in May, 1897, the Duke suddenly died, Lady Dilke wrote a little\r\narticle which, in spite of the sadness of the circumstances of his death\r\nand the consequent deep note of pathos, in certain parts of the obituary\r\nrecalled very happily the brightness of their talks. Letters of the time\r\nspeak of the losses which the Dilkes and their friends had sustained by\r\nthe fire at the charity bazaar which had indirectly caused the Duke's\r\ndeath, through that of the Duchesse d'Alençon, his favourite niece. One\r\nof Lady Dilke's dearest friends in France, the Marquise de Sassenaye,\r\nhad escaped, but several of her relations who were with her had died a\r\ndreadful death. The tie with these friends was very close, and the\r\ndaughter of the Marquise de Sassenaye, the Baronne de Laumont, and her\r\ngranddaughter, the Comtesse Marquiset, were among Sir Charles's last\r\nguests at the House of Commons. But he did not live to know that his\r\nfriend the Baron de Laumont and his only son laid down their lives for\r\nFrance in 1915.\r\n\r\nColonel Picquart Sir Charles had met in 1891 during the 'belles journees\r\nde ces manoeuvres de l'Est,' chronicled by M. Joseph Reinach. He deeply\r\nadmired the character of this noble and chivalrous gentleman, who,\r\nconvinced that wrong had been done to an innocent man, sacrificed his\r\nfine career to save him, and suffered for his Dreyfusism by imprisonment\r\nand military degradation. Sir Charles met Picquart often at the table of\r\nM. Labori and elsewhere, and at one dinner when Emile Zola was present\r\nin 1899 there were also two English friends, the genial Sir Campbell\r\nClarke, Paris correspondent of the _Daily Telegraph_, and his kind wife,\r\nat whose house in Paris the Dilkes dined almost every Christmas Day. He\r\ntouched in this way the struggle over the Dreyfus affair, and his\r\nattitude is summed up in a letter conveying through M. Reinach to\r\nColonel Picquart 'that intense sympathy which I do not express publicly\r\nonly because all we English say does more harm than good.' [Footnote:\r\n'At Christmas, 1900, in Paris we met Labori and Colonel Picquart two\r\nnights running, and heard fully the reasons of their quarrel with the\r\nDreyfus family, which will probably all come out. Labori with great\r\neloquence, and Picquart quietly, developed the view that Dreyfus, by\r\nvirtually accepting the amnesty along with his own freedom, has taken up\r\nthe position of a guilty man and sacrificed all those who have\r\nsacrificed everything for him. When, during the season of 1901, Labori\r\ncame to London, and we saw much of him, he had toned down this view, or\r\ndid not think it wise to express it. But it came out in November,\r\n1901.']\r\n\r\nHis friendship with M. Joseph Reinach, so often mentioned, dates back to\r\nthe days when the latter was Gambetta's secretary. 'C'est par Gambetta\r\nque j'ai connu Dilke,' says M. Reinach. 'Gambetta avait pour lui une\r\nvive affection.' In London and in Paris they met and talked and fenced,\r\nand kept in touch by close political correspondence. 'Dilke was a great\r\nfriend of mine, and I thought him a true and intrepid patriot and\r\ncitizen,' said M. Reinach; and perhaps of all M. Reinach's great\r\nqualities it was his courage which most provoked the admiration of Sir\r\nCharles and of his wife. They knew all the three brothers, and M.\r\nSalomon Reinach, asking Sir Charles to come and discuss manuscripts,\r\nsigns himself 'in admiration of your enormous knowledge'--a happy\r\ntribute from one of whom it was said 'il sait tout.' 'Salomon Reinach,\r\nthe outgoing President of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles\r\nLettres,' writes Sir Charles in 1908 to Lord Fitzmaurice, 'is what\r\nArthur Strong (Librarian of House of Lords) was, and Acton tried to be,\r\n\"universal.\" He asked me to listen to him for two whole evenings, till\r\nwe became a nuisance to our hosts--on the way in which, despite our\r\nHistorical Manuscripts Commission, we still lock up papers. His\r\nstrongest examples were Horace Mann's letters to Horace Walpole, and the\r\nletters received by the Duke of Wellington (the loss of nearly all the\r\nletters written by J. S. Mill moves me more).'\r\n\r\nM. Pallain, Regent of the Bank of France, was another friend whose\r\nacquaintance with Sir Charles dated back to the days when he was\r\nGambetta's secretary. His book on Talleyrand, the 'fameux livre de\r\nPallain,' as Sir Charles calls it in a letter to M. Jusserand, was\r\nhardly less interesting to him than his mastership of French finance.\r\n\r\nThe Siegfrieds, representatives of the wealthy and serious Protestant\r\nworld, were friends who shared Sir Charles' interest in questions of\r\nsocial reform, as was that wisest of permanent officials, M. Fontaine,\r\nhead of the French Labour Department; and he discussed these matters\r\nalso with the great representative of Roman Catholic Socialism, Count\r\nAlbert de Mun. The list of his Diary engagements, ranging over a long\r\nperiod of time, is filled with the names of French writers, from Ludovic\r\nHalevy, the novelist and dramatist (passages from whose _Belle Helene_\r\nhe would recite and whistle), to Anatole France; and of politicians of\r\nevery school of thought, from Leon Say, 'a statesman of rare\r\ncompetence,' to M. Delcasse, whom he saw often, Deschanel, Leon\r\nBourgeois, Millerand, Viviani, and that great friend of Greece--M. Denys\r\nCochin; Calmette, the editor of the _Figaro_, assassinated by Mme.\r\nCaillaux; and Lepine, the Prefect of Police; while Jaures was a London\r\nas well as a Paris guest.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of much French acting attracted Sir Charles and his wife\r\nto the theatre in Paris, though in London their visits to a play were\r\nrare. M. Jules Claretie, the Academician, and for nearly thirty years,\r\ntill his death in 1913, the distinguished Director of the Theatre\r\nFrancais, constantly put his box at their disposal, and rarely failed to\r\njoin them for a talk between the acts.\r\n\r\nThere is a reply from General de Galliffet, the 'beau sabreur'--that\r\nbrilliant soldier whom Sir Charles had followed through the French\r\nmanoeuvres accepting a theatre invitation in 1892: 'J'ai, en principe,\r\nl'horreur du theatre; j'en benis le ciel puisque je pourrai ainsi mieux\r\njouir de votre societe et de celle de Lady Dilke.'\r\n\r\nIn these visits to Paris they went always to the Hotel St. James, in the\r\nRue St. Honore, attracted by the beauty and interest of their rooms\r\nthere. It is the old Hotel de Noailles, and the staircase and landing,\r\nand several of the rooms, are still as they were when three members of\r\nthe family--grandmother, mother, and daughter--were guillotined at the\r\ntime of the French Revolution. The guardroom at the head of the stairs,\r\nwith its great folding doors, and the paved landing with its old\r\n_dalles_, are intact, as are some of the state-rooms. Their sitting-room\r\nand the great bedroom opening from it looked out on to the courtyard,\r\nwhere in old days, before it became a courtyard and when the garden\r\nstretched away to the Seine, Marie Antoinette walked and talked, the\r\nstory goes, with La Fayette, with whom her friend Mme. de Noailles had\r\narranged an interview. The windows and balconies here, and part of the\r\ngarden front, resemble exactly their representations in pictures of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThey saw many of their friends during the year both at the House of\r\nCommons and at Dockett. Describing them in London, dining in the room\r\ndecorated by Gambetta's portrait, M. Jules Claretie writes: 'La premiere\r\nfois que j'eus l'honneur d'etre l'hote de Sir Charles la charmante Lady\r\nDilke me dit, souriante, \"Ici vous êtes en France. Savez-vous qui est\r\nnotre cuisinier? L'ancien brosseur de Général Chanzy.\"' And among Sir\r\nCharles's collection of Dockett photographs was one in which the chef,\r\naccompanied by the greater artist, the elder Coquelin, was fishing from\r\na punt on the Thames.\r\n\r\n'Je me rappelle avec tristesse,' says the same friend in February, 1911,\r\n'les beaux soirs où, sur la terrasse du Parlement, en regardant, de\r\nl'autre côté de la Tamise, les silhouettes des hauts monuments, là-bas,\r\nsous les étoiles, dans la nuit, nous causions avec Sir Charles de cet\r\n_Athenæum_, la revue hebdomadaire oú il accumulait tant de science, et\r\ndont j'avais été un moment, après Philarète Chasles et Edmond About, le\r\ncorrespondant Parisien; puis de Paris, de la France de Pavenir-du passé\r\naussi.'\r\n\r\nWhen M. Jules Claretie came to London to deliver a lecture in 1899 on\r\nthe French and English theatre, Sir Charles was asked to preside, and\r\nalso to assist in welcoming him at the Ambassador's table. The charming\r\nand unfailing friendship of that Ambassador, M. Paul Cambon, is worthy\r\nof record, and Sir Charles's admiration for him was very marked. He used\r\nto say that so long as a great Ambassador, either French or English,\r\nrepresented his nation in Paris or London, the other representative\r\nmight be a cipher, and M. Cambon's embassy in London sufficed for both\r\ncountries. 'He is a man,' he wrote to Mr. Morley in 1892, 'who (with his\r\nbrother Jules) will survive Ribot, and even Freycinet.'\r\n\r\nAnother close friend was M. Jusserand, whose graceful studies of English\r\nliterary history adorned the Pyrford bookshelves. While he was\r\ncounsellor to the Embassy in London he was a frequent guest at 76,\r\nSloane Street, and when he became Ambassador at Washington he still kept\r\nin constant touch with Sir Charles.\r\n\r\n'Dès qu'on nous parle d'un homme d'état étranger, ministre ou\r\ndiplomate,' says M. Joseph Reinach, writing of Sir Charles, 'c'est notre\r\npremière question: Aime-t-il la France? C'est une sottise. Un Italien\r\nn'aime que l'Italie, un Russe n'aime que la Russie, un Anglais n'aime\r\nque l'Angleterre.' It may be so. In 1887 Sir Charles wrote to M. Reinach\r\nconcerning the possibility that Bismarck would attack France, which, he\r\nadded, 'everybody thinks likely except your humble servant, Lord Lyons,\r\nand Sir E. Malet, our new man at Berlin.' If it did happen, said he,\r\n'whatever use I can be I shall be, either if I can best serve France by\r\nwriting here, or by coming to be a private of volunteers and by giving\r\nall I can to the French ambulances.' Some there are who can recall Sir\r\nCharles's face as he turned over the pages of M. Boutet de Monvel's\r\n_Jeanne d'Arc_, and dwelt on that first picture in which the little\r\n'piou-pious' of the modern army advance, under the flag on which are\r\ninscribed the battles of the past; while the Old Guard rises from the\r\nearth to reinforce their ranks, and the ghostly figure of Jeanne d'Arc,\r\nsymbolizing the spirit of France, leads on to victory. Listening as he\r\ntalked, his hearers became infected with Sir Charles's spirit, and\r\nthinking of the past, looking to the future, he so kindled them that\r\nwhen he closed the book they all were 'lovers of France.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nLABOUR\r\n\r\n1870-1911\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n'From 1870 to this date one man has stood for all the great causes of\r\nindustrial progress, whether for the agricultural labourers, or in the\r\ntextile trades, or in the mining industries, or with the shop\r\nassistants. That man is Sir Charles Dilke.' So, in 1910, spoke Dr. Gore,\r\nthe present Bishop of Oxford, at that time Bishop of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Charles's early days, economists were still governed by\r\nindividualist doctrines. The school of _laissez faire_ was the\r\nprevailing school of thought, and in its teaching he was trained. \"We\r\nwere all Tory anarchists once,\" was his own summary of the views which\r\ncharacterized that economic theory. But to \"let alone\" industrial misery\r\nearly became for Sir Charles a counsel of despair. _Greater Britain_,\r\npublished in 1868, when he was twenty-five, gave indications of a change\r\nof view, and his close friendship with John Stuart Mill directly\r\nfurthered this development. Mill's lapses into heresy from the orthodox\r\neconomics of the day were notable, and Sir Charles was wont to point to\r\na passage written by Mill in the forties showing that sweated wages\r\ndepressed all wages, and to claim him as the pioneer of the minimum\r\nwage.\r\n\r\nIt was left for Mill's disciple to become one of the foremost champions\r\nof the legislation which now protects the industrial conditions of the\r\nworker, and also the guardian of its effective administration.\r\n\r\nHis policy was distinguished by his determination to act with those for\r\nwhom the legislation was created, and to induce them to inspire and to\r\ndemand measures for their own protection. The education of the\r\nindustrial class, the object of \"helping the workers to help\r\nthemselves,\" was never absent from his mind. This view went farther than\r\nthe interest of a class: he held the stability of the State itself to be\r\nmenaced by the existence of an unorganized and depressed body of\r\nworkers. An organized and intelligent corporate demand put forward by\r\ntrained leaders chosen from the workers' own ranks was essential to the\r\ndevelopment and stability of industrial conditions and to appropriate\r\nlegislation. Sir Charles was therefore the unwavering advocate of\r\ntrade-unionism. It is worth while to emphasize his attitude, since views\r\nnow generally accepted were not popular in the sixties. His first speech\r\nto his Chelsea electors in 1867 dealt with his trade-union position, as\r\nit did with the need for strengthening the Factory Acts.\r\n\r\nViolent utterances on the part of certain sections of Labour did not\r\naffect his advocacy of its claims, for he would have endorsed the words\r\nof Cardinal Manning written to him on September 13th, 1884: \"It is the\r\ncause of the people mismanaged by imprudent and rough words and deeds;\r\nbut a people suffering long and stung by want of sympathy cannot speak\r\nlike county magistrates.\" During the later period of his life he tried,\r\nat innumerable meetings all over Great Britain, to help trade-unionists\r\nto make their claims understood. So he came to fill \"a unique position\r\nas counsellor, friend, and adviser to the Labour cause.\" [Footnote:\r\nLetter from the Rt. Hon. George Barnes, Labour M.P. for the Blackfriars\r\ndivision of Glasgow, and Minister for Pensions in Mr. Lloyd George's\r\nGovernment of 1916, once general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers.]\r\n\r\nHis belief in trade-unionism was never shaken; for though he did not\r\npretend that in the distant future trade-unionism would be sufficient to\r\nredress all social ills, holding it, as Lady Dilke did, to be, not \"the\r\ngospel of the future, but salvation for the present,\" he believed that\r\nduring his lifetime it was far from having perfected its work. He was a\r\nstrong municipal Socialist, but with regard to State Socialism he would\r\nnever bind himself to any general theory; he was in favour of large\r\nexperiments and of noting those made elsewhere; beyond this he \"did not\r\nsee his way.\"\r\n\r\nHis faith in the maintenance of all safeguards for trade-unions was well\r\ndemonstrated by his action on the occasion of the Taff Vale judgment and\r\nits sequel. [Footnote: _Taff Vale Judgment_.--As trade-unions were not\r\nincorporated, it was generally assumed that they could not be sued, but\r\nin 1900 Mr. Justice Farwell decided that a trade-union registered under\r\nthe Trade-Union Acts, 1871 and 1876, might be sued in its registered\r\nname; and this decision, after being reversed in the Court of Appeal,\r\nwas restored by the House of Lords in 1901. The result of this case (the\r\nTaff Vale Railway Company _v_. the Amalgamated Society of Railway\r\nServants) was that damages could be obtained against a trade-union for\r\nthe acts of their officials in \"picketing\" during a strike; and by\r\nmaking the trustees in whom the funds were vested defendants, an order\r\ncould be obtained for the payment of damages and costs out of the\r\naccumulated funds of the trade-union.] He wished to keep for them the\r\ninviolability of corporate funds which formed their strength and staying\r\npower. While he admitted that theoretically a good case could be made\r\nout against such inviolability, he was clear that in practice it was\r\nessential to the continued existence of Labour as an organized force,\r\ncapable of self-defensive action. The conference on the effect of the\r\nTaff Vale decision held in October, 1901, was arranged by him after\r\nconsultation with Mr. Asquith, who suggested Sir Robert Reid and Mr.\r\nHaldane as legal assessors. How grave was the position which the\r\njudgment had created may be gathered from the declaration of Mr. Asquith\r\nin a letter to Sir Charles written on December 5th, 1901: \"How to\r\nconduct a strike legally now, I do not know.\" He advised the\r\nintroduction of two Bills, one to deal with the question of trade-union\r\nfunds, the other with picketing, etc. In April, 1902, Sir Charles Dilke\r\nintroduced the deputation, organized to ask for special facilities for\r\ndiscussion, to Lord James of Hereford, who received it on behalf of the\r\nCabinet, and to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as Leader of the\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\nIn an article contributed by him to the _Independent Review_ of June,\r\n1904, he notes a private offer of the Government for dealing with the\r\nmatter by a small Royal Commission of experts, whose recommendations\r\nshould be immediately followed by legislation. This was refused by the\r\nLabour leaders, and he thought it a lost opportunity for what might have\r\nbeen a favourable settlement. [Footnote: Mr. D. J. Shackleton, an\r\nInsurance Commissioner, and appointed Permanent Under-Secretary of the\r\nMinistry of Labour in December, 1916, was in 1906 M.P. for Clitheroe,\r\nand a prominent member of the Labour party. He writes of the passing of\r\nthe Trade Disputes Act, which reversed the Taff Vale judgment: \"It was\r\nmy privilege to be the spokesman for the Labour party and Joint Board on\r\nthe Trade Disputes Bill in the House of Commons. On the evening when the\r\nBill was read a third time in the House of Lords, the three National\r\nCommittees gave me a complimentary dinner at the House of Commons. In\r\nthe course of my speech in reply to the toast, I expressed, on behalf of\r\nthe Labour movement and myself, our sincere and grateful thanks to Sir\r\nCharles for the very valuable help he had given us through all our\r\nParliamentary fights. My consultations with him whilst the Bill was\r\nbefore the House were almost daily. On many occasions he crossed the\r\nfloor to give me points in answer to speeches that were made in\r\nopposition to the Labour position.\"] But at the same time 'the Taff Vale\r\njudgment virtually brought the separate Labour party into existence, and\r\nthe difficulty of upsetting the judgment and of amending the law of\r\nconspiracy will,' he said, 'nurture, develop, and fortify it in the\r\nfuture.' To him this was matter for satisfaction. [Footnote: A full\r\naccount of the action taken by Sir Charles on the Taff Vale judgment and\r\nthe Trade Disputes Act which reversed its decision will be found in\r\nAppendix II. to this chapter, furnished by Miss Mary Macarthur (now Mrs.\r\nW. C. Anderson). Miss Macarthur, secretary of the Women's Trade-Union\r\nLeague from 1903, worked with Sir Charles on many questions.]\r\n\r\nHis absence from the House of Commons from 1886 to 1892 gave him leisure\r\nfor deep study of industrial questions, and he drew much of illustration\r\nand advice from his knowledge of colonial enterprise in social reform.\r\nThus, in his advocacy of a general eight-hour day, observation of\r\ncolonial politics largely guided his suggestions. In his first speech in\r\nthe Forest of Dean in 1889, he said: \"Australia has tried experiments\r\nfor us, and we have the advantage of being able to note their success or\r\nfailure before we imitate or vary them at home.\" The experiments in\r\nregard to regulation of hours and wages which colonial analogy justified\r\nshould, he urged, be carried out by Government and by the municipalities\r\nas employers and in their contracts. His visits to our Colonies were\r\nfollowed by constant correspondence with Colonial statesmen, especially\r\nwith Mr. Deakin, and the introduction here of minimum-wage legislation\r\nmay be traced to Sir Charles's close study of Colonial experiment.\r\n\r\nBut he never narrowed his policy to developments which would confine the\r\nleaders of Labour to the management of the internal affairs of their\r\ntrade-unions; he early urged the representation of Labour by Labour in\r\nParliament, where its influence on legislation affecting its interests\r\nwould be direct, and there is a note in his Diary in 1906, when the\r\n\"Labour party\" in Parliament came into existence, chronicling the\r\n\"triumph of the principles\" to which during his life that part of his\r\nactivities devoted to Labour had been given.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, when the Independent Labour party was emerging into light, he\r\nhad advocated in talks with Labour friends its development into the\r\nLabour party of later days. But he noted the limits which bounded his\r\nown co-operation except as an adviser: \"My willingness to sink home\r\nquestions and join the Tories in the event of a war, and my wish to\r\nincrease the white army in India and the fleet--even as matters\r\nstand--are a bar.\"\r\n\r\nThere were those who prophesied that the Labour party's appearance had\r\nno permanent interest; that it owed its existence to political crises,\r\nand would soon fade out of the life of Parliament. Sir Charles, on the\r\ncontrary, was clear that it constituted a definite and permanent feature\r\nin Parliamentary life. It might vary in number and in efficiency; it\r\nmight, like other parties, have periods of depression; but it was\r\nhenceforth a factor to be reckoned with in politics. Its power, however,\r\nmust largely depend upon its independence. The point to which an\r\nindependent party can carry its support of the Government in power must\r\nnot be overstepped, and when, as in 1910, in the case of the \"Osborne\r\njudgment\" [Footnote: Mr. Osborne was a member of the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Railway Servants. He brought an action against them for a declaration\r\nthat the rule providing contribution for Parliamentary representation is\r\ninvalid, and for an injunction to restrain the funds being used in this\r\nway. He was successful in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords\r\n(A.S. of R.S. _v_. Osborne, 1910, A.C., 87). This practically made it\r\nimpossible for trade-unions to support the Labour party.] or the\r\nUnemployed Bill, he thought that he detected weakening in the ranks of\r\nthe Labour party in their fight for these Bills, he noted it gravely.\r\n\r\nHis view that Labour should find its leaders in its own ranks was not\r\nshared by Chamberlain and others who initiated Labour legislation;\r\n[Footnote: April, 1893, letter to Dilke from Chamberlain: \"A political\r\nleader having genuine sympathy with the working classes and a political\r\nprogramme could, in my opinion, afford to set them [Labour leaders]\r\naside.\" Reference to this letter has been made also in Chapter XLIX., p.\r\n288.] but Dilke's principle was to act as spokesman for Labour only so\r\nlong as it stood in need of an interpreter; when the movement had\r\nattained stability and become articulate, his work as the advocate who\r\nhad expressed its aspirations and compelled public attention for them\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nHis policy did not involve his silence on points in which he differed\r\nfrom the Labour party. In his first speech in the House of Commons in\r\n1893, on the question of the destitute alien, he did not agree with some\r\ntrade representatives, who would in those days have excluded aliens, in\r\nfear of their competition. His dissection of the figures on which the\r\nplea of exclusion was based showed that they were misleading, since\r\nemigration and immigration were not accurately compared. He maintained\r\nthat protective legislation with regard to conditions and wages would\r\ndeal with the danger from competition which the trades feared, and he\r\npointed out that anti-alien legislation must strike at the root of that\r\nright of asylum which had always been a distinguishing feature of\r\nBritish policy.\r\n\r\nHe met the contention of those who wished for a Labour Ministry by\r\npointing out that co-ordination and readjustment, not addition to the\r\nnumber of Ministers, was needed. The size of our Cabinets was\r\nresponsible for many governmental weaknesses in a country where\r\nMinisters were already far more numerous than was the case in other\r\ngreat European countries; too numerous to be accommodated on the\r\nTreasury Bench, and with salaries which would almost have met the cost\r\nof payment of members.\r\n\r\nFrom Labour developments everything was to be hoped, and nothing to be\r\nfeared, in the interests of the State or community. The only danger\r\nwhich menaced the gradual and wise evolution of Labour was \"an\r\nunsuccessful war.\" The danger to peaceful evolution from such a war\r\nwould be great indeed. He warned those who advocated the settlement of\r\ninternational difficulties by arbitration, that this result could only\r\nbe obtained when the workers of the different countries were in a\r\nposition to arrive at settlement by this means. Till then we could not\r\nneglect any precaution for Imperial Defence.\r\n\r\nComplete data are needed to carry out efficient work, and to Sir\r\nCharles's orderly mind the confusion of our Labour and other statistics,\r\nand the absence of correlation arising from their production by\r\ndifferent departments, were a source of constant irritation. Both by\r\nquestion and speech in the House of Commons and as President of the\r\nStatistical Society he laboured to obtain inquiry into \"this\r\noverlapping, to obtain co-ordination of statistics and the possibility\r\nof combining enforcement with economy under one department,\" instead of\r\nunder three or four. [Footnote: Sir Bernard Mallet, Registrar-General,\r\ngives an account of Sir Charles's work in this direction. See Appendix\r\nI. to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nTrade-unionism had by no means achieved \"its perfected work,\" and\r\noutside the highly organized trades there was a vast unorganized mass of\r\nlabour, largely that of women. The existence of such a body of workers\r\nundermined the Labour position, and of all Sir Charles's efforts to\r\nimprove industrial conditions none is more noteworthy than that which\r\nwas done by himself and Lady Dilke for women and children. His wife's\r\nwork for the Women's Trade-Union League, to which are affiliated women's\r\ntrade-unions (the League increased its membership from ten to seventy\r\nthousand during her lifetime), brought him increasingly in touch with\r\nwomen's work; and, from his return to Parliament in 1892 to the end,\r\nscarcely a month in any Session passed without many questions being put\r\nby him in the House of Commons on points dealing with their needs. These\r\nquestions tell in themselves a history of a long campaign; sometimes\r\ndealing with isolated cases of suffering, such as accident or death from\r\nill-guarded machinery, or a miscarriage of justice through the hide-\r\nbound conservatism of some country bench; sometimes forming part of a\r\nlong series of interrogatories, representing persistent pressure\r\nextending over many years, directed to increased inspection, to the\r\nenforcement of already existing legislation, or to the promotion of new.\r\nThe results were shown not only by redress of individual hardships and\r\nby the general strengthening of administration, but by the higher\r\nstandard reached in the various measures of protective legislation which\r\nwere passed during his lifetime. Nearly every Bill for improving Labour\r\nconditions, for dealing with fines and deductions, for procuring\r\ncompensation for accident, bore the stamp of his work. [Footnote: As\r\nMinister he helped in measures far outside his department. Mr. W. J.\r\nDavis, father of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade-Union\r\nCongress, tells how once, at Dilke's own suggestion, he and Mr.\r\nBroadhurst came to see Sir Charles, then Under-Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, about the Employers' Liability Bill and the Contracting-out\r\nClause. \"We spent an hour with him in the smoking-room,\" says Mr. Davis,\r\n\"and left, Sir Charles having agreed to see the full Committee at 9.30\r\nnext morning. The House did not rise until 3 a.m., but Sir Charles was\r\nat our offices in Buckingham Street prompt to time. In the afternoon he\r\nmet a few of us again, to consider an amendment for extending the time\r\nfor the commencement of an action to six months instead of six weeks.\r\nThis desirable alteration he succeeded in obtaining. When the Bill was\r\npassed--which, with all its faults, restored the workers' rights to\r\ncompensation for life and limb--there was no member of the Government,\r\neven including the Home Secretary (Sir William Harcourt), from whom the\r\nParliamentary Committee had received such valuable help as from the\r\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\"]\r\n\r\nCharacteristically he mustered for use every scrap of information\r\navailable on a subject. Thus, he detected in the Employment of Children\r\nAct (1903) powers which neither the framers nor the promoters of the Act\r\nhad foreseen, and, by speech and question, pressed their use till these\r\npreviously unknown powers of protection for children were exercised by\r\nthe officials to the full. Equally characteristic was his fashion of\r\nutilizing his specialized knowledge of regulations in one department in\r\norder to drive home his point in another. Thus, having cited the case of\r\na stunted child told off to carry loads amounting to 107 pounds, he was\r\nable to add the information that, \"in regulating the weight to be lifted\r\nby blue-jackets in working quick-firing guns, the limit was put at 100\r\npounds.\"\r\n\r\nHis care for women workers was not confined to public advocacy; it\r\nshowed itself in unostentatious and unremitting help to those who worked\r\nwith him or came to him for advice. Such advice was not confined to\r\nlarge questions of policy: he spent himself as faithfully on the\r\nsmallest points of detail which made for the efficiency of the work. His\r\nknowledge furnished \"briefs\" for that group of workers which his wife's\r\ncare for the Women's Trade-Union League drew round them both, and it\r\nguided and inspired their campaign. He watched every publication of the\r\nLeague. However busy, he would find time to correct the proofs of\r\narticles brought to him, to dissect Blue-books and suggest new points;\r\neach quarter he read the review which was issued of the League's work.\r\n\r\nThe man who knows, and is ready to help, is early surrounded by clients.\r\nTributes from the organizers and leaders of the great trades are as\r\nfrequent as the testimony to his help which came from workers in\r\nunorganized and sweated trades. The representative of a mining\r\nconstituency in later years, his work for the miners was great, and\r\nrepaid by their trust and support. [Footnote: \"During the whole of his\r\nParliamentary life he was always ready and willing to help the miners,\r\nassist in preparing and drafting Mines Bills, regulations for increased\r\nsafety in mines, and the eight hours. He was in charge of the Mines\r\nRegulation Amendment Bill, bringing it before the House every Session\r\nuntil the Government appointed a Royal Commission, and ultimately\r\nbrought in a Bill which became an Act of Parliament. By his tact and\r\ninfluence he managed some years ago to get a short Bill passed raising\r\nthe working age underground from twelve to thirteen,\" writes Mr. T.\r\nAshton, secretary of the Miners' Federation.] From a standpoint which\r\ngives an estimate of all his Labour work come these words from Mr.\r\nSidney Webb:\r\n\r\n    \"He was an unfailing resource in every emergency. No one will ever\r\n    know how much the Progressive Movement, in all its manifestations,\r\n    owed to his counsel, his great knowledge, and his unsparing\r\n    helpfulness. Trade-unionism among women as well as men; the movement\r\n    for amending and extending factory legislation; the organization of\r\n    the Labour forces in the House of Commons, are only some of the\r\n    causes in which I have myself witnessed the extraordinary\r\n    effectiveness which his participation added. There has probably been\r\n    no other instance in which the workmen alike in the difficulties of\r\n    trade-union organization and amid the complications of Parliamentary\r\n    tactics have had constantly at their service the services of a man\r\n    of so much knowledge and such extensive experience of men and\r\n    affairs. But the quality that more than any other impressed me in\r\n    Sir Charles Dilke as I knew him was his self-effacement. He seemed\r\n    to have freed himself, not only from personal ambitions, but also\r\n    from personal resentments and personal vanity. What was remarkable\r\n    was that this 'selflessness' had in it no element of 'quietism.' He\r\n    retained all the keenness of desire for reform, all the zest of\r\n    intellectual striving, and all the optimism, of the enthusiast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThat \"true Imperialism\" which Sir Charles advocated was never more\r\nclearly shown than in matters of Social Reform. His demand that we\r\nshould learn from the example of our Colonies was dictated by his desire\r\nto promote the homogeneity of the Empire. He believed in developing our\r\ninstitutions according to the national genius, and he viewed, for\r\nexample, with distrust the tendency to import into this country such\r\nschemes as that of contributory National Sickness Insurance on a German\r\npattern. His attitude during the early debates on Old-Age Pensions\r\nhelped to secure a non-contributory scheme. He laid, then as always,\r\nspecial stress on the position of those workers who never receive a\r\nliving wage and already suffer from heavy indirect taxation, holding\r\nthat to take from such as these is to reduce still further their\r\nvitality and efficiency. During the debates on the Workmen's\r\nCompensation Act he urged the extension of the principle to out-workers\r\nand to all trades. The protection should be universal and compulsory.\r\n\r\nIn a speech of April 27th, 1907, he promised to \"fight to the death any\r\nscheme of Old-Age Pensions based on thrift or on the workers'\r\ncontributions.\" Later, when the proposals as to workmen's insurance were\r\nnebulous, but nevertheless pointed to a contributory scheme, he,\r\ncriticizing some words of Mr. Haldane's, spoke his anxiety lest \"to have\r\na system for all labour, including the underpaid labour of unskilled\r\nwomen, based on contributions by the individual, might involve the\r\ndifficulty expressly avoided by the Government in the case of pensions--\r\nnamely, the use of public money to benefit the better-paid class of\r\nlabour, inapplicable to the worst-paid class, but largely based on\r\ntaxation which the latter paid.\" One of his last pencillings on the\r\nmargin of an article reviewing the Government's forecast of the scheme\r\nfor sickness insurance includes a note of regret and indignation at the\r\napparent omission to make any special provision for the lowest-paid\r\nclasses of workers.\r\n\r\nOne neglected class of Labour whose grievances he sought to remedy by a\r\nmeasure which has not yet reached fulfilment was that of the shop\r\nassistants. Year after year, from 1896, he spoke at their meetings,\r\nintroduced their Bill in the House of Commons, urged its points,\r\ninspired its introduction in the Lords, till at last the Liberal\r\nGovernment, in 1909, introduced proposals embodying its main features.\r\nThe question of the representation of the shop assistants on the Grand\r\nCommittee when the Bill should reach that stage was discussed by him\r\njust five days before his death, and many attributed very largely to his\r\nabsence the fact that the Government were obliged to permit mutilation\r\nof their proposals before they became law in 1911. The National Union of\r\nShop Assistants have commemorated his work for them by giving his name\r\nto their new headquarter offices in London.\r\n\r\nAn amusing tribute to his legislative activities and the effect they\r\nproduced on reactionaries is to be found in a speech by that famous\r\n\"die-hard\" of the individualist school, the late Lord Wemyss, who warned\r\nthe House of Lords that their lordships should always scrutinize the\r\nmeasures that came from \"another place,\" and \"beware of Bills which bear\r\non their backs the name of that great municipal Socialist, Sir Charles\r\nDilke.\"\r\n\r\nA minor but important characteristic of Sir Charles's views as an\r\nadministrator was his conviction that wherever the interests of women\r\nand children are concerned the inspectorate should include an effective\r\nwomen's staff. The appointment of women inspectors for the Local\r\nGovernment Board made by him in 1883 was a pioneer experiment, which he\r\nvainly urged Sir William Harcourt to follow in the Home Department--a\r\nreform delayed till twelve years later, when Mr. Asquith as Home\r\nSecretary carried it out.\r\n\r\nBut his most important service to Labour in the direction of\r\nadministration is connected with the Home Office Vote. Though Bills were\r\nclosely followed by him in Committee, he refused to take part in any\r\nobstruction upon them, holding that \"all obstruction is opposed to the\r\ninterests of Radicalism, in the long-run.\" Acting on this view, he with\r\nothers helped the Government to get votes in Supply. The true policy\r\nwas, in his view, to obtain \"ample opportunity for the discussion of\r\nimportant votes at those times of the Session when we desire to discuss\r\nthem.\" So he dealt with Home Office administration on its industrial\r\nside. Some more marked and centralized criticism of the workings of this\r\ngreat department was necessary than that supplied by questions in\r\nParliament, correspondence, and private interviews. The administration\r\nof the War Office, the conduct of Foreign Affairs, or of the Admiralty,\r\nclaimed the attention of the House of Commons as the annual vote on the\r\nEstimates came round. It was not so with the \"Ministry of the Interior,\"\r\nand it was practically left to Sir Charles to create that annual debate\r\non the Home Office Vote, which dealt with the industrial side of that\r\ndepartment's administration. Year after year he reviewed its work,\r\nforcing into prominence the Chief Inspector's Report on Factories and\r\nWorkshops; examining the orders, exemptions, exceptions, and\r\nregulations, by which the Home Office legislates under the head of\r\nadministration, always with a view to the levelling up of industrial\r\nconditions and the promotion of a universal incidence of protection for\r\nthe workers. \"We can trust no one but Sir Charles Dilke in Parliament to\r\nunderstand the principles of factory legislation,\" wrote Mr. Sidney Webb\r\nin comment on some destructive Government proposals as to industrial\r\nlaw. This appreciation of the fundamental ideal underlying our\r\nlegislative patchwork of eccentricities went hand in hand with a half-\r\nhumorous and half-lenient understanding of his countrymen's attitude to\r\nsuch questions. \"We passed Acts in advance of other nations,\" he said,\r\n\"before we began to look for the doctrines that underlay our action, and\r\nlong before we possessed the knowledge on which it was said to have been\r\nbased.\" But for one afternoon in the year the attention of the House of\r\nCommons was intelligently focussed on the details of the suffering of\r\nthose, the weakest workers of all, on whose shoulders the fabric of our\r\nindustrial system rests. Matters left previously to the agitation of\r\nsome voluntary society or to the pages of the \"novel with a purpose\"\r\nwere marshalled according to their bearing on different administrative\r\npoints, and discussed in orderly detail. The overwork of women and girls\r\nin factory or workshop; the injury to health and the risks that spring\r\nfrom employment in dangerous trades; poor wages further reduced by fines\r\nand deductions; the employment of children often sent to work at too\r\nearly an age, to stagger under loads too heavy for them to bear; the\r\nliability to accident consequent on long hours of labour--these were the\r\nthemes brought forward on the Home Office Vote, not for rhetorical\r\ndisplay, but as arguments tending to a practical conclusion, such as the\r\ninadequacy of inspection or the insufficient numbers of the available\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nIn the atmosphere thus created much progress was possible. Take, for\r\nexample, one dangerous trade, that of the manufacture of china and\r\nearthenware, in which during the early nineties suffering which caused\r\nparalysis, blindness, and death, was frequent and acute. Speaking as\r\nlate as 1898 on the Home Office Vote, and quoting from the official\r\nreports, Sir Charles showed that the cases for the whole country\r\namounted to between four and five hundred out of the five to six\r\nthousand persons exposed to danger. Under his persistent pressure\r\nCommittee after Committee inquired into this question and promulgated\r\nspecial rules; attention was focussed on the suffering, and this evil,\r\nthough still unfortunately existing, abated both in numbers and\r\nacuteness, till at his death the cases had fallen to about a fifth of\r\nthose notified in 1898.\r\n\r\nHis standpoint was one which raised industrial matters out of the arena\r\nof party fight, and on both sides of the House he found willing\r\nco-operators.\r\n\r\nHelp came not from the House of Commons alone. Lord James of Hereford,\r\nLord Beauchamp, Lord Milner, lent their aid on different occasions, and\r\nLord Lytton paid generous tribute to one \"who was always ready to place\r\nhis vast knowledge and experience, his energy and industry, at the\r\nservice of any cause which has for its object the social well-being of\r\nthe people of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sir Charles's crowded day, the early luncheon at half-past twelve\r\nwhich allowed time for talk before the House met was often set aside for\r\ninterviews. During the meal itself conversation for the greater part\r\nranged wide, but towards the end he would turn to his guest with a\r\ndemand for information on the point at issue, or, if his advice were\r\nneeded, with an appeal for questions. The mass of information which he\r\nelicited was due to the simplicity of his talk with all who came to him.\r\n\"He asked me my views as if I were of his own standing,\" said the young\r\nsecretary of the Anti-Sweating League after his first interview.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Apart from these scattered conversations, Sir Charles met the\r\nunited representatives of trade-unionism once a year at the opening of\r\nParliament, for then the Trade-Union Congress Parliamentary Committee\r\nlunched with him and talked over Labour questions at the House of\r\nCommons. This custom, which began in 1880 and lasted through Mr.\r\nBroadhurst's secretaryship, was resumed in 1898, and was continued to\r\nthe end, and the meeting was fruitful of results. \"These annual\r\nconversations,\" says Mr. Davis, \"had much more to do with the policy of\r\nthe legislative Labour party than could be understood by the party as a\r\nwhole, but always the object was to aid the main aspirations of the\r\nTrade-Union Congress; indeed, from 1901 to 1906 the luncheons were\r\nfollowed by a conference of Labour and Radical members in one of the\r\nconference-rooms, where arrangements were made to support Labour Bills\r\nor to oppose reactionary proposals made by a reactionary Government.\r\nThis would have continued, but in 1906 the larger Labour party returned\r\nto Parliament made it unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe advent of the \"larger Labour party,\" though it affected the\r\nconferences, did not affect the social meetings, which ceased only with\r\nSir Charles Dilke's death. The last of these dinners was one at which\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee in their turn entertained him, paying warm\r\ntribute to the years of help he had given to the trade-union movement.\r\nIt was in the vacation, but there was a full attendance, all the\r\nprovincial members of the Parliamentary Committee without exception\r\ncoming up or staying in London for the dinner. One of his prized\r\npossessions in the after-months was the gold matchbox they gave him,\r\ninscribed with the badge of the Trade-Union Congress and the word\r\n\"Labour.\" Round it were engraved his name and the date of the\r\nParliamentary Committee's presentation.]\r\n\r\nThe reformer does not generally count on the aid of representatives of\r\nthe great Government departments, yet the independent and non-party\r\nattitude of Sir Charles and the friends who worked with him for Social\r\nReform secured not only the attention of successive Ministers, but also\r\nthe help of those permanent officials who finally came to do him honour\r\nat the dinner which commemorated the passing of the Trade Boards Act in\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the friends who worked with him in the House of\r\nCommons for the promotion of Social Reform in different directions were\r\nMr. H. J. Tennant (afterwards Secretary for Scotland in Mr. Asquith's\r\nCoalition Government), Captain Norton (now Lord Rathcreedan), Mr.\r\nMasterman, and Mr. J. W. Hills, member for Durham, a leader of the\r\nSocial Reform group among the Conservatives. Mr. Hills's estimate of\r\nthis side of Sir Charles's Parliamentary achievements may fitly be given\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n    \"Dilke's interest in Labour questions sprang not only from his sense\r\n    of justice and sympathy with the unfortunate, but also from his\r\n    clear and logical mind, which recognized that starvation,\r\n    underpayment, and servile conditions are the negation of that\r\n    democracy in which he believed for the United Kingdom and the\r\n    Empire. For this reason he was the admitted champion of the coloured\r\n    races; and he was the originator of a growing school of reformers of\r\n    all countries, who realize that the nations of the world must\r\n    advance together, for if one lags behind all suffer. He therefore\r\n    took a most active interest in the International Association for\r\n    Labour Legislation; he was the mainstay of the English branch, and\r\n    he kept closely in touch with men like Dr. Bauer of Switzerland, M.\r\n    Fontaine of France, and M. Vandervelde of Brussels, who were working\r\n    on the same lines in other countries. Of the earlier and more\r\n    difficult part of the work I saw nothing, for when I joined the\r\n    association it had an assured position, and had behind it two great\r\n    outstanding successes--the abolition of white phosphorus in the\r\n    making of matches, and the regulation of nightwork for women. His\r\n    knowledge of foreign countries, his familiarity with their\r\n    industrial questions and modes of thought, and his facility in their\r\n    languages, gave him, by common consent, a position such as no one\r\n    holds now. The work has been little recognized in England; our\r\n    Government, unlike foreign Governments, was slow to give help to the\r\n    association, and it was only Dilke's unbounded energy that compelled\r\n    them to support this important and hopeful movement.\r\n\r\n    \"What struck me about his position in domestic Labour questions was\r\n    that his support or opposition was always the dominating fact of the\r\n    situation. What his relations were with Labour I do not know--he\r\n    never talked about it; but I have no doubt that he was their\r\n    counsellor and adviser throughout their history.\r\n\r\n    \"Dilke had a deeper hold on Labour than his knowledge and ability\r\n    alone would have given him. He held their hearts and affection as\r\n    well. They looked upon him as the one man who had always stood up\r\n    for the workers, through bad and good report, whether they had votes\r\n    or had not. He had championed their cause when they were voiceless,\r\n    when it had little support in Parliament and gave little advantage\r\n    at elections. Nowadays such championship is both easy and\r\n    profitable, but that was by no means the case in the sixties and\r\n    seventies. It was exceedingly unpopular, and out of touch with the\r\n    political philosophy of all except a few. I was greatly struck with\r\n    this at the dinner given to Dilke in 1910 to celebrate the passing\r\n    of the Trade Boards Act. I realized that many had come there to do\r\n    honour to the one man who had always fought for them. They knew that\r\n    so long as he was alive there was someone who would support them,\r\n    regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Of his activities in Parliament, I remember most vividly those in\r\n    which I was personally concerned. In two such cases I was on the\r\n    opposite side; in two I worked with him. The Trade Disputes Act of\r\n    1906 was in reality carried by Dilke and Shackleton, for the\r\n    Government were hopelessly compromised by the two voices with which\r\n    nearly all their leaders had spoken. Again in 1907, when I was\r\n    trying to plead for Preferential Trade, he marshalled against it all\r\n    the force of his wide knowledge and ripe experience.\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand, in 1909 the luck of the ballot enabled me to\r\n    bring in a private member's Bill, and I introduced Dilke's Sweated\r\n    Industries Bill. Dilke was to second it. When the Bill came on I was\r\n    laid up with influenza, but I was determined to go to the House, and\r\n    got out of bed to do so, though when I got there I was only capable\r\n    of a few sentences and had to return to bed. But the effect of the\r\n    introduction of Dilke's Bill was to stir up the Government, so much\r\n    so that a few days later Winston Churchill introduced his Bill,\r\n    which, being a Government Bill, took precedence of ours and became\r\n    law as the Trade Boards Act. In 1910 again, on the Home Office Vote,\r\n    an occasion on which Dilke always made a masterly review of the\r\n    industrial history of the year, he asked me to second him, and to\r\n    deal particularly with lead-poisoning in the Potteries. He always\r\n    tried to detach Labour questions from party. It was entirely owing\r\n    to him that I took an interest in the subject.\r\n\r\n    \"I never actually worked with him, but I should imagine that he\r\n    worked at a pace that few could follow. He was wonderful at\r\n    mastering facts, and he had the instinct of knowing what facts were\r\n    important. His method must have been somewhat unconventional, for\r\n    not only did he tear the heart out of a book, but he frequently tore\r\n    pages out as well. He had got what he wanted, and the rest was waste\r\n    paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. Hills has touched on several objects for which Sir\r\nCharles worked till his death, but of these one upon which he struggled\r\nto establish an international understanding--that of the minimum wage--\r\nclaims a fuller consideration. The interdependence of Labour was always\r\napparent to him, and under the sympathy for suffering which inspired his\r\naction on such questions as the native races or the treatment of the\r\nalien Jew, there lay the sense that the degradation of any class of\r\nlabour in one country affected its status in all, and that to be insular\r\non industrial questions was to undermine everything that the pioneers of\r\nEnglish Labour had fought for and achieved.\r\n\r\nThe wages of many workers were left untouched by the imperfect\r\ndevelopment of trade-unionism. Sweating was the result. To check this\r\nevil, machinery must be created by legislation to deal with low wages,\r\nwhile international understanding was essential here, as in other\r\nquestions of Social Reform, to enable the democracies of the various\r\ncountries to keep abreast.\r\n\r\nThe question of the minimum wage had occupied Sir Charles Dilke's\r\nattention from the days of his discipleship to John Stuart Mill. He had\r\nbeen much impressed by the debates which took place during his\r\npresidency in 1885 at the Conference on Industrial Remuneration. A few\r\nyears later he had been present at a meeting convened by the Women's\r\nTrade-Union League during the Trade-Union Congress at Glasgow, and the\r\nimpression made on him by that meeting he thus described:\r\n\r\n    \"I had long been used to Labour meetings, but was then brought face\r\n    to face with hopeless difficulties, heartbreaking to the organizer,\r\n    because of a rooted disbelief among the workers in the possibility\r\n    of improvement. There is a stage in which there is hope--hope for\r\n    the improvement of wages and of conditions, possibly to be won by\r\n    combined effort. There is a stage, familiar in the East End of\r\n    London, when there is no hope for anything, except, perhaps, a hired\r\n    feather and the off-chance of an outing. Yet even the roughest\r\n    trades employing women and children in factories or large workshops,\r\n    to be found in the East End or in the outskirts of Glasgow, have in\r\n    them the remote possibility of organization. Home industries in many\r\n    cases have not even that bare chance. There is in them a misery\r\n    which depresses both the workers and those who would help them. The\r\n    home life of the poorest class of factory workers is not much, but\r\n    it means, nevertheless, a great deal to them. The home life of the\r\n    home worker is often nothing. The home becomes the grinding shop.\r\n    Factory slavery finds a refuge even in a hard home. 'Home' slavery\r\n    has none.... It is in this class, utterly incapable of fixing a\r\n    minimum wage for itself, that the evil of its absence stands\r\n    revealed in its worst form.\"\r\n\r\nTurning, as was his custom, to our colonies for successful experiment\r\nand example, he discussed with Mr. Deakin (the Victorian Minister of\r\nwhom he prophesied in 1887 that he would be the First Prime Minister of\r\nthat federated Australia which was then called \"Deakin's Dream\") the\r\nexample of a Wages Board which was being introduced in Victoria. An\r\nAnti-Sweating League had been formed in 1893 in Victoria, and had\r\nadopted this scheme, carrying it into law in 1895. The vital part of the\r\nscheme was the creation of Conciliation Boards on which representatives\r\nof employers and employed were represented--Boards which should discuss\r\nwages and fix a minimum rate in the trade concerned.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to any larger scheme of conciliation for all trades, this\r\nplan had to Sir Charles's mind certain marked advantages: it would not\r\ninterfere with the activities of the great trade-unions which already\r\nstood possessed of similar voluntary machinery, while its application\r\nonly to those whose depressed and miserable condition invoked public\r\nsympathy would create an atmosphere likely to induce successful and\r\nharmonious development.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 he introduced his Wages Boards Bill, from that time annually\r\nlaid before Parliament; but it made no progress, and there were moments\r\nwhen even his optimism almost failed. It was not till 1906, when a\r\nSweated Industries Exhibition was organized by the _Daily News_, that a\r\nstep forward was made. The sight of the workers, engaged in their\r\nill-remunerated toil, brought home to the public an evil till then too\r\nlittle realized. The movement was international. A similar exhibition in\r\nBerlin had already been held, and others now followed in America, in\r\nContinental countries, in Scotland, and in various parts of England. In\r\nthis country a National Anti-Sweating League came into existence. A\r\ngreat meeting of trade-unionists and Labour representatives was held at\r\nthe Guildhall, Sir Charles Dilke presiding on the first day, and the\r\nquestion of the minimum wage was debated by Labour; Sir George Askwith,\r\nMr. Sidney Webb, and Mr. W. P. Reeves, with other Colonial\r\nrepresentatives, speaking from the platform. Many conferences followed,\r\nand M. Vandervelde came from Belgium, M. Arthur Fontaine from France, to\r\ncombat insular and Tariff Reform arguments, and to point out that the\r\nmovement was not confined to our own shores. A great deputation\r\nrepresentative of every shade of political opinion, introduced by Sir\r\nCharles Dilke and the Archbishop of Canterbury, waited on the Prime\r\nMinister on December 4th, 1908, and laid their views before him. Sir\r\nCharles put the Bill into the hands of the Labour party in Parliament. A\r\nCommittee of the House was appointed to consider the question of home\r\nwork and the proposed measure, and, after the stages which Mr. Hills has\r\ndescribed, it became law as the Trade Boards Act in 1909. The Act at\r\nfirst applied to only four trades, but there have been several\r\nadditions. Of the first extension made after Sir Charles's death, and of\r\nthe probability of the adoption of the scheme by other countries, Sir\r\nGeorge Askwith wrote: \"It will be the first stone on Sir Charles's\r\ncairn. I can see them all coming up the hill, nation by nation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: France, the first nation to reach the hill-top, passed her\r\nMinimum Wage Act for home workers in 1915.\r\n\r\nMinimum rates of wages under the Trade Boards Act were in operation in\r\nGreat Britain (February, 1915) as follows:\r\n\r\n                                        _Female Persons over 18_\r\n                                         _per Week of 52 Hours._\r\n                                                  Per Hour. Per Week.\r\n\r\n  Ready-made and wholesale bespoke tailoring,\r\n    and shirt-making                               3-1/2d. 15s. 2d.\r\n  Chain-making                                     2-3/4d. 11s. 11d.\r\n  Paper-box-making                                 3-1/4d. 14s. 1d.\r\n  Lace-finishing                                   2-3/4d. 11s. 11d.\r\n  Sugar confectionery and food-preserving          3d.     13s. 0d.\r\n  Tin-box-making                                   3-1/4d. 14s. 1d.\r\n  Metal hollow-ware                                3d.     13s. 0d.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that these rates of wages, which are in every case\r\nmuch higher than those they supplanted, were fixed before or in the\r\nearly part of the War, and owe nothing to the general inflation of\r\nearnings which took place at a later stage. From the figures of the\r\nBoard of Trade Enquiry into Earnings and Hours of Labour, published in\r\n1909, it appears that about one-third of the women employed in factories\r\nand workshops were at the time of the Enquiry in receipt of wages of\r\nless than 10s. per week, and the minimum rates above mentioned must be\r\nconsidered in relation to these, and not to later figures.\r\n\r\nIn the various trades, shirt-making and lace-finishing excepted, minimum\r\nrates of wages have also been fixed for adult male persons. These rates\r\nbefore the War were, save in one case, 6d. per hour or upwards, and\r\nprobably one-quarter of the adult male workers in the trades benefited\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nThe relief given by the Boards to groups of particularly ill-paid women,\r\nsuch as the chain-makers, the matchbox-makers in East London, and the\r\nlace-finishers, has been the subject of many articles in the Press.\r\n\r\nIn the chain-making trade, where the Board affected both wives and\r\nhusbands, the family income increased, in many cases, by 15s. and\r\nupwards per week. The bearing of these higher rates of wages on the food\r\nand clothing of those who received them, the physical condition of the\r\nschool-children, and personal and social habits, forms part of the story\r\nwhich Mr. R. H. Tawney tells in _Minimum Rates in the Chain-making\r\nTrade_.]\r\n\r\nOn April 14th, 1910, there followed the dinner to celebrate the passing\r\ninto law of his favourite project, and at that dinner, under the\r\npresidency of Dr. Gore, then Bishop of Birmingham, representatives of\r\nLiberalism, Labour, and Conservatism met to do Sir Charles honour. There\r\nwere many tributes paid to one whom Mr. Will Crooks dubbed \"the greatest\r\nof anti-sweaters,\" and of them the happiest was, probably, that of Dr.\r\nGore:\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Charles has played a great part publicly. In finding out,\r\n    however, what has been going on behind the scenes, I am led to know\r\n    that, great as has been the public part, there is a greater part Sir\r\n    Charles has played in that region which the newspapers do not\r\n    penetrate--the region where important decisions are hatched and\r\n    matured, and differences made up, before appearances are made in\r\n    public. His zeal has been unquenchable and consistent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Charles's death, the same friend described his knowledge as\r\n\"supreme and incomparable in all matters relating to industries and\r\nindustrial law, transcending that of any of his contemporaries.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's nature led him to discount personal tributes, and\r\nhis verdict on the triumph of the minimum-wage principle is best summed\r\nup in the words of Renan which he sent to one who worked with him:\r\n\"C'est ainsi qu'il se fait que le vrai, quoique n'étant compris que d'un\r\ntrès petit nombre, surnage toujours, et finit par l'emporter.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no part of his work which brings out more the quality of\r\n\"self-effacement\" to which Mr. Sidney Webb alludes. The cause of Labour\r\nis not even yet a popular one, and there are many who held and hold that\r\nhis interest in it was not calculated to strengthen the political\r\nposition of one to whom men looked as a military expert, or an authority\r\non foreign affairs. But to him a grasp of social questions and a full\r\nrecognition of the place which Labour should hold in the modern State\r\nwere essential parts of a statesman's equipment, and appeals on the\r\nground of a weakening of his position by his unremitting care for Labour\r\ninterests could not have a feather's weight in the balance for one in\r\nwhom the chord of self had long since been struck and passed in music\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nStatistics by Sir Bernard Mallet, Registrar-General\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Sir Charles Dilke, who had been a member of the Royal\r\nStatistical Society since 1866, accepted an invitation to become its\r\nPresident, in which capacity he served for two years, with notable\r\nadvantage to the society. As the writer of the notice which appeared in\r\nthe journal on the occasion of his death observed:\r\n\r\n    \"While Sir Charles Dilke would have declined the title of\r\n    statistician, and, indeed, frequently referred to himself as a 'mere\r\n    user' of statistics, he possessed in a high degree what may be\r\n    termed the statistical instinct. His genius for marshalling facts in\r\n    orderly sequence, his passion for precision of statement even in\r\n    minute detail, his accurate recollection of figures, as, indeed, of\r\n    everything which he stored in the chamber of his encyclopædic\r\n    memory, are all primary attributes of the ideal statistician, though\r\n    in his case the wide range and magnitude of the subjects in which he\r\n    was interested led far beyond the field of statistical\r\n    investigation.\" [Footnote: _Journal of the Royal Statistical\r\n    Society_, February, 1911 p. 320]\r\n\r\nHis assumption of this office was thus specially appropriate on general\r\ngrounds; but it was connected in his mind, as he more than once\r\nexplained, with certain definite and practical objects. He had been\r\nimpressed, during his chairmanship of the Income Tax Committee, with the\r\ninadequacy of the published statistics on finance, and he hoped to\r\nsignalize his period of office by the promotion of the better\r\norganization of Government statistics. He chose this subject,\r\naccordingly, for the presidential address which he delivered before the\r\nsociety in December, 1907, [Footnote: Ibid., December, 1907, pp.\r\n553-582.] and which Mr. Arthur Bowley, in his address to the society in\r\nfurtherance of the same crusade a few months later, described as a\r\n\"terrible indictment\" of the existing system, or want of system. To a\r\nlarge extent this address consisted of illustrations of the lack of\r\nco-ordination in the collection and issue of these statistics, and the\r\ndifficulties which confronted the student who desired to make use of\r\nthem. But he did not confine himself to criticism. Although no definite\r\nscheme for dealing with this large and difficult matter could be\r\nusefully put forward without a searching official inquiry, Sir Charles\r\nwas willing to support any proposal which would assist the object in\r\nview, from the institution of an advisory or consultative committee of\r\nexpert statisticians, to that of a central statistical bureau on the\r\nContinental model. He induced the council to enlarge the scope of the\r\nsociety's Census Committee, then sitting to advise on measures to\r\nimprove the census to be taken in 1911, so as to include official\r\nstatistics generally; and he persuaded the Select Committee of the House\r\nof Commons on Publications to hear evidence on the subject. [Footnote:\r\n_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, September, 1908, p. 459] He\r\nsecured the consideration of his suggestions in several official\r\nquarters, and his criticisms undoubtedly led to some improvements in\r\ndetail. It would have been a miracle if Sir Charles Dilke's vigorous\r\ncampaign had attained a more obvious measure of success, and he himself\r\nwas well aware of the extreme difficulty of securing attention in this\r\ncountry to a mere question of administrative reform as distinguished\r\nfrom one of political or party interest--a question, moreover, which\r\naroused many departmental susceptibilities. But it would be a mistake to\r\nignore the utility of such efforts as his in stimulating interest in the\r\nsubject and assisting those whose labours have resulted in material\r\nimprovements in recent years.\r\n\r\nNever had the society enjoyed the advantage of a President who took so\r\nmuch interest in its proceedings. He regularly attended the meetings of\r\nthe committees. He was almost invariably in the chair at the society's\r\nmeetings, and rarely failed to add to the interest of the discussion by\r\nsome illuminating comment, and he was the life and soul of the dinners\r\nof the Statistical Club which followed the meetings.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to exaggerate the encouragement which a President of Sir\r\nCharles Dilke's distinction can give in these various ways to workers in\r\nthe unpopular and unattractive paths of statistical science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nBy Miss Mary Macarthur\r\n\r\nThe Taff Vale decision struck a vital blow at trade-union organization,\r\nand while the case was still finally undecided the leaders of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants called on Sir Charles for\r\nadvice. Afterwards, when the judgment was upheld, his services were\r\nunreservedly at the command of the Parliamentary Committee of the\r\nTrade-Union Congress.\r\n\r\nHe assisted the committee in 1901 at a conference in which Mr. Asquith,\r\nSir Robert Reid, and Mr. Haldane, committed the Liberal party to the\r\ninitiation of legislation to reverse the Taff Vale decision, and shortly\r\nafterwards played a similar part in an interview with Lord James of\r\nHereford and the late Lord Ritchie, who spoke as representing the then\r\nGovernment. The second conference was also satisfactory, since it drew\r\nfrom Lord James the emphatic opinion that workmen on strike were\r\nentitled in their own interest to use moral suasion to prevent their\r\nplaces being taken by others.\r\n\r\nThe Tory party did not, however, take Lord James's view, and a\r\nresolution proposing the restoration of the _status quo_ before the Taff\r\nVale judgment was defeated in the House of Commons by a majority of 29.\r\nIn May, 1903, a Bill introduced by Mr. D. J. Shackleton to legalize\r\npicketing shared the same fate; while an even more ominous event was the\r\nappointment by the Government of a Royal Commission on which Labour was\r\nunrepresented, and before which the leaders of the trade-union movement\r\nrefused to appear.\r\n\r\nArguments in favour of compromise were put forward at the Trade-Union\r\nCongress of 1903, which followed closely on the rejection of Mr.\r\nShackleton's Bill, and during the next three years the position of the\r\nunions became continuously more precarious. It looked as though trade-\r\nunions were beginning, in the phrase of Mr. Bell, to \"exist very much on\r\nsufferance.\"\r\n\r\nIn this crisis Sir Charles was an inexhaustible source of strength. On\r\neveryone he could reach and influence he pressed the policy of standing\r\nfirm, and the continuing reverses of the Tory party at by-elections\r\nplayed into his hands.\r\n\r\nThe Tories accepted the decision of their constituents to the extent\r\nthat Mr. Shackleton's Bill, rejected in 1903, obtained second reading by\r\n39 votes in 1904, and by 122 in 1905. But dislike of the measure had not\r\nabated; so many vexatious amendments were embodied in the Bill in\r\nCommittee as to render it worse than useless; and at last all but the\r\nTory members retired from the Grand Committee in disgust, and the Bill\r\nwas discharged from the House. But in 1906 came the General Election, by\r\nwhich the Labour party found itself abruptly in the enjoyment of\r\nprominence and power.\r\n\r\nFaced with responsibility for legislation, the Liberal Government abated\r\nsomething of their pre-election zeal, and introduced a measure which\r\nwould have given only conditional immunity to the trade-unions; but an\r\nindignant Labour party, having secured a majority of 300 for a\r\nthoroughgoing measure of their own, were prepared to oppose the Bill of\r\nthe Government, and this Bill was remodelled on Labour party lines.\r\n\r\nThe result was seen by everyone, but very few people understood how at\r\nevery stage the member for the Forest of Dean had intervened, using to\r\nthe utmost his powerful influence in the one camp to fix the trade-\r\nunionists in their demand for complete reversal of the Taff Vale\r\njudgment and the prevention of its recurrence, and in the other to bring\r\nabout an unequivocal acceptance of the demand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The Trade Disputes Act, 1906, got rid of the Taff Vale\r\ndecision by Section 4. It also legalized peaceful picketing (Section 2),\r\nand made certain acts done in furtherance of a trade dispute not\r\nactionable on the ground merely that they interfered with business\r\n(Section 4). Its sections dealt with the following subjects:\r\n\r\nSection 1 amended the law of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nSection 2 made peaceful picketing legal.\r\n\r\nSection 3: \"An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a\r\ntrade dispute shall not be actionable on the ground only that it is an\r\ninterference with the trade, business, or employment, of some other\r\nperson, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his capital\r\nor his labour as he wills.\"\r\n\r\nSection 4: \"An action against a trade-union, whether of workmen or\r\nmasters, or against any members or officials thereof, on behalf of\r\nthemselves and all other members of the trade-union, in respect of any\r\ntortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the\r\ntrade-union, shall not be entertained by any court.\"]\r\n\r\nNor after this major issue was settled triumphantly did his anxiety and\r\nwatchfulness abate. He scrutinized the provisions of the Bill with\r\njealous care. He desired to exclude every ambiguous word. \"Too easily\r\nsatisfied,\" he scribbled to me after Labour members had neglected to\r\npress an amendment he considered of importance, and as the Bill slowly\r\nmoved forward several such criticisms came into my hands.\r\n\r\nHis own work in Committee on the Bill is indicated by his summary of the\r\nrisks confronting those who took part in trade disputes:\r\n\r\n1. The liability to be hit in respect of molestation.\r\n\r\n2. Under the word \"reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n3. Under the Law of Nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe first danger he diminished in an amendment accepted by the\r\nGovernment. The second he tried to lessen by moving the omission of the\r\nwords \"peaceably and in a reasonable manner.\" Unsuccessfully, for his\r\nLabour colleagues inclined to think him extreme, and intimated their\r\nconsent to retain \"peaceably.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third question he was supported by almost half the Committee, and\r\nonly failed to carry his amendment against the Government through a\r\ndictum of the then Attorney-General, that the Law of Nuisance could not\r\nbe invoked to stop picketing. This law has, however, since been invoked\r\nagainst the pickets of the Hotel, Club, and Restaurant Workers' Union,\r\nand under it several members of the union have been fined, and one or\r\ntwo committed to gaol. The instance is a final proof, if one were\r\nneeded, of Sir Charles's prescience. The fame of Sir Charles Dilke in\r\nthe realm of industrial legislation will mount high, but to trade-\r\nunionists nothing will endear his memory more than the knowledge that,\r\nif and in so far as they have now a charter invulnerable alike to the\r\nprejudice and the caprice of those who administer the law, it is largely\r\ndue to the clear vision of Sir Charles Dilke, and to the skill and\r\ninvincible courage with which he followed his aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nWORK FOR NATIVE RACES\r\n\r\n1870-1911\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one of Sir Charles Dilke's eager activities won for him more\r\npublic and private affection and regard than the part which he took both\r\nin and out of Parliament as a defender of the weaker races against\r\nEuropean oppression.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset of his career, John Stuart Mill's admiring sympathy\r\nfor the youthful author of _Greater Britain_ was specially called forth\r\nby chapters which made a natural appeal to the son of the historian of\r\nBritish India. More than twenty years later, Sir Charles, revising his\r\nwork in the full maturity of his power and knowledge, emphasized again\r\nthe first precept of his policy, which enjoined not only justice, but\r\ncourtesy:\r\n\r\n    \"Above all it is essential to the continuation of our rule under the\r\n    changed conditions that the individual Englishman in India should\r\n    behave towards the people as the best behave at present.\"\r\n\r\nInto the question whether India would be better or worse off under some\r\nother system he never entered; British control was accepted by him as a\r\nfact; but, so accepting it, he insisted that justice should be done to\r\nthe Crown's Asiatic subjects.\r\n\r\n    \"Men who speak better English than most Englishmen; who conduct able\r\n    newspapers in our tongue; who form the majority on town councils\r\n    which admirably supervise the affairs of great cities; who, as\r\n    Native Judges, have reached the highest judicial posts; who occupy\r\n    seats in the Provincial, the Presidency, and the Viceregal Councils,\r\n    or as powerful Ministers excellently rule vast Native States, can no\r\n    longer be treated as hopelessly inferior to ourselves in\r\n    governmental power. These men look upon the Queen's proclamations as\r\n    their charters, and point out that, while there is no legal reason\r\n    against their filling some proportion, at all events, of the highest\r\n    executive posts, there are as a fact virtually no natives high up in\r\n    the covenanted Civil Service.\"\r\n\r\nControl of the military power, control of the Budget, must remain with\r\nthe governing race. But \"provided war and finance are in those single\r\nhands, autocratic or despotic if you will, which must exist for India as\r\na whole, in the absence of any other authority, the less we interfere in\r\nthe details of administration, to my mind, the better both for India and\r\nfor ourselves.\" [Footnote: _East and West_, November, 1901.]\r\n\r\nLocal self-government would give to the leading natives more opportunity\r\nfor a career, and to the governed a rule more closely in touch with\r\ntheir sympathies and traditions. But there could be no general formula.\r\n\"Roughly speaking,\" he said, \"my views are hostile to the treating of\r\nIndia as a single State, and favourable to a legislative recognition of\r\nthe diversity of conditions which undoubtedly exist in India.\" He\r\ncontemplated administration in some parts of India by hereditary chiefs\r\nand princes, in some cities by elective representatives of the\r\nmunicipalities, in other portions of the country by a mixed system. But,\r\nby whatever method, he was for recognizing the fact that in India we\r\nwere at many points controlling a developed though a different\r\ncivilization; that trained men were to be had in numbers; and that the\r\neducated natives' claim for an increased and increasing part in the task\r\nof government must be recognized.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter from him to Mr. Morley in 1897, when he thought that\r\nfreedom for the Indian Press was threatened by \"blind reaction\" after\r\nthe Poona murder: \"The state of things in Poona has grown out of the\r\nCommittee, under the man who was stabbed but is not dead, employing\r\nBritish privates (instead of employing native troops, as did General\r\nGatacre at Bombay) to search the houses for plague patients.\" The whole\r\nposition appeared to him \"more dangerous than it has been at any time\r\nsince the recall of Lytton in 1880.\"\r\n\r\nA policy of repression would set back the progress of liberalizing\r\nIndian government. No one insisted more strongly on the maintenance of\r\nsufficient force to defend the Indian Empire; but he believed that there\r\nwas a second \"greatest duty\" in learning \"how to live with the\r\ndevelopment of that new India which we ourselves have created.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking on July 13th, 1909, when the murder of Mr. A. M. T. Jackson at\r\nNasik was fresh in all minds, he urged continued \"measures of amnesty\r\nand appeasement,\" and deprecated the policy of deporting leading members\r\nof the National Congress. \"If reform was dangerous,\" he said, \"it was\r\nless dangerous than leaving things alone.\" Describing Lord Ripon, whose\r\ndeath had only just taken place, as \"the Viceroy who more than any other\r\nhad touched the imagination of the people of India,\" he added: \"If our\r\nrule, excellent in intention, but rather wooden, is to be made\r\nacceptable, imagination must play its part.\"\r\n\r\nThis lifelong advocacy of generous principles was not unrecognized. In\r\nthe last autumn of his life he was pressed in flattering terms to attend\r\nthe twenty-fifth National Congress; and for some time he entertained the\r\nidea, which was specially urged on him by his friend and honorary agent\r\nfor the Forest of Dean, Sir William Wedderburn, who was presiding over\r\nthe Congress that year.\r\n\r\nThe project was finally set aside in view of the momentous autumn\r\nsession of 1910; but he did not feel equal to the journey. When the end\r\ncame, India mourned for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's concern with the vast network of problems arising\r\nthroughout Africa and the Pacific Islands from the contact of white men\r\nwith natives was infinitely detailed; yet more and more it tended to\r\nreduce itself to one broad issue. In this relation the coloured man is\r\neverywhere the white man's labourer; Dilke's object was to insure that\r\nhe should not be his slave. Against actual slavery he was always a\r\ncrusader, and for long years he contended against the recognition of it\r\nimplied by the practice of restoring runaway slaves in Zanzibar. Under a\r\nLiberal Government, he carried his point at last. A letter written on\r\nAugust 17th, 1907, fitly sums up this matter:\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir Charles Dilke,\r\n\r\n    \"I have just heard, on arriving here, that the announcement has been\r\n    made in the House of Commons of the intention of the Government to\r\n    abolish the legal status of slavery in Mombasa and the Coast\r\n    District on October 1st. I can hardly say how much pleasure this has\r\n    given me, nor can I refrain from writing to say how much we out here\r\n    are indebted to you for the part you have taken in bringing the\r\n    Government to this decision. I feel that without your assistance the\r\n    affair would have dragged on, possibly, for years. With many and\r\n    grateful thanks,\r\n\r\n    \"Believe me, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n    \"Alfred R. Tucker,\r\n\r\n    \"_Bishop of Uganda_\"\r\n\r\nTo Sir Charles men turned if protest had to be made against the illegal\r\nflogging of natives, or against those punitive expeditions which under a\r\nLiberal Government were often called military patrols.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1870 he had become a correspondent of the Aborigines'\r\nProtection Society; in 1871 he supported their action in defence of the\r\nDemerara negroes; and to the end of his life he was in constant\r\ncommunication with their leading men.\r\n\r\nHis brief tenure of office gave him power to put in force principles for\r\nwhich he had contended as a private member. In 1877 he wrote to Mr.\r\nChesson that since 1868 he had been interested to secure fair treatment\r\nfor China, [Footnote: In 1869 Sir Charles wrote letters to the _Times_\r\non Chinese affairs, which, says the Memoir, 'possess a certain interest\r\nas showing that I held the same views as to China which I have always\r\ncontinued to have at heart,' and which may be sufficiently illustrated\r\nby quotation of a single phrase. He condemned \"the old, bad, world-wide\r\nparty ... which never admits that weak races have rights as against the\r\nstrong.\"] but China's friends must bring pressure to bear to limit the\r\nuse of torture. In 1880, having become Under-Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, he was able to inform the same correspondent that he had\r\n\"succeeded in making it certain that a strong direction would be made on\r\nthe subject of Chinese torture.\"\r\n\r\nCases of gross barbarity, cases of actual slave trading, always found\r\nhim ready to act, but his great object was to check the growth of all\r\nsystems and institutions which made for industrial servitude--to his\r\nmind a graver peril than direct slavery. Thus, in 1878 he was in\r\ncorrespondence with the Aborigines' Protection Society concerning the\r\nproposed establishment of a Chartered Company in Borneo, and observed\r\nthat such arrangements could not be justified by proving the existence\r\nof bad government in independent Native States. \"The worse the\r\ngovernment of these States, the greater the difficulties which crop up\r\nwhen we intermeddle.\" In 1881 as a Minister he resisted the grant of\r\nthat charter. All these surrenders of territory and jurisdiction to\r\ncommercial associations filled him with suspicion. He knew that\r\nexpedients lay ready to the white man's hand by which the native\r\npopulation could easily be enslaved; and to these even the best\r\nrepresentatives of direct colonial government under the Crown were prone\r\nto resort. In 1878 he had written anxiously to Mr. Chesson concerning\r\nthe labour tax in Fiji, which, although instituted by a Governor in whom\r\nthe society had special trust, seemed \"opposed to all the principles for\r\nwhich you have hitherto contended.\" Nearly twenty years later he was\r\nmaintaining this vigilance. \"I am always uneasy about Fiji,\" he wrote to\r\nMr. Fox Bourne in August, 1896. \"I attacked the labour system when it\r\nwas instituted, and continue to hold the strongest opinion against it.\"\r\nBut by that time the new developments which he had resisted in the\r\nseventies had spread fast and far.\r\n\r\n\"The fashion of the day,\" he wrote in September, 1895, \"sets so strongly\r\ntowards veiled slavery that there is nothing now to be done by\r\ndeputation to Ministers. We ought to appeal to the conscience of the\r\nelectorate, and I am willing greatly to increase my little gifts to your\r\nsociety if that is done.\"\r\n\r\nPart of his concern was engendered by the revelation, then recent, that\r\nthe Chartered Niger Company imposed by contract a fine of £1,000 on any\r\nagent or ex-agent of theirs who should publish any statement respecting\r\nthe company's methods, even after his employment was ended. \"I am\r\nconvinced,\" Sir Charles wrote, \"that the secrecy which it has been\r\nattempted to maintain puts them wholly in the wrong, even if they are\r\nangels;\" and upon this ground he kept up a steady campaign against the\r\nNiger Company by question and debate in Parliament until Government\r\nbought the company out and assumed direct responsibility for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa was a graver centre of disquietude, for there commercial\r\nenterprise was on a greater scale. He wrote in December, 1900, after\r\nGreat Britain had occupied the Transvaal: \"My point is that the Rand\r\nJews have already got slavery, and our Government must repeal the laws\r\nthey have. Reading together the Pass Law and the coloured labour clause,\r\nwhich you will find was the end of the latest Gold Law, we have slavery\r\nby law.\"\r\n\r\nThe remedy lay, for him, in the guarantee of citizenship, at least in\r\nsome degree, to this class of labour; and with that object he put\r\nhimself at the centre of a concerted movement as soon as opportunity\r\noffered. When, after the Boer War, the mine owners returned to the Rand,\r\nand, pleading shortage of Kaffir labour, demanded the introduction of\r\nindentured Chinese coolies, Sir Charles vigorously protested. The\r\nquestion played a considerable part in the elections which returned the\r\nLiberals to power with an enormous majority. It was not, however, as the\r\nparty man that Sir Charles made his protest, but as the upholder of\r\nhuman rights. He feared lest \"South Africa is to become the home of a\r\ngreat proletariat, forbidden by law to rise above the present\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Union of South Africa was proposed, it became manifest that\r\ndivision existed as to the status of non-European citizens. In 1906,\r\nwhen the Liberals came into power, immediate action was taken by a small\r\ngroup of members, who addressed a letter to the Prime Minister begging\r\nthat, in view of the contemplated federation, steps should be taken to\r\nsafeguard such political rights as natives actually enjoyed in the\r\nvarious colonies, and also the tribal institutions of separate native\r\ncommunities. The letter advocated also an extension of Native Reserves,\r\nand it was promptly followed (on February 28th) by a motion, brought\r\nforward by Mr. Byles, which declared that \"in any settlement of South\r\nAfrican affairs this House desires a recognition of Imperial\r\nresponsibility for the protection of all races excluded from equal\r\npolitical rights, the safeguarding of all immigrants against servile\r\nconditions of labour, and the guarantee to the native populations of at\r\nleast their existing status, with the unbroken possession of their\r\nliberties in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and other tribal countries and\r\nreservations.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles himself took no part in the debate; but he notes: 'I am\r\nproud to have planned this letter and drawn the motion for Byles so that\r\nit was carried unanimously by the House.' A resolution much stronger in\r\nterms could easily have been carried in that Parliament; but it would\r\nnot have been unanimous, and it could hardly have been enforced later\r\non. Here a principle was so firmly laid down that the House could not\r\nrecede from it; and the importance of the step soon became apparent.\r\nWhen the Bill for the South African Union came before Parliament in\r\n1909, Colonel Seely, who had been one of the signatories to the letter\r\nof 1906, represented the Colonial Office in the Commons; and Sir\r\nCharles, warned by friends of the natives in South Africa, questioned\r\nhim as to whether the Bill as drafted empowered the self-governing\r\ncolonies to alter the existing boundaries of the Protectorates. He\r\nreceived a private promise that the matter should be put beyond doubt;\r\nand this was done in the Committee stage by a solemn declaration that\r\nthe Imperial Government absolutely reserved its right of veto upon the\r\nalienation of native lands. As soon as the text of the proposed\r\nConstitution became known, he raised his protest against what he\r\nconsidered a permanent disfranchisement of labour; for labour in South\r\nAfrica, he held, must for all time be coloured labour. Six weeks later,\r\nwhen the Bill was brought to Westminster, Mr. W. P. Schreiner, who came\r\nspecially to plead the rights of the civilized men of colour, was in\r\nconstant intercourse with Sir Charles, and scores of letters on detailed\r\nproposals for amendment attest the thoroughness of that co-operation.\r\nDilke, with the support of some Labour men and Radicals, fought\r\nstrenuously against the clauses which recognized a colour-bar, and in\r\nthe opinion of some at least in South Africa, the essence of the\r\nposition was secured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Drew, editor of the _Transvaal Leader_, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I am truly glad that (if my view of the somewhat vague cablegram is\r\n    correct) you have alienation of native lands reserved everywhere in\r\n    South Africa. This provision, together with the entrenchment of the\r\n    Cape Franchise, will form a solution of the question not\r\n    unfavourable to the natives. It gives the natives and their friends\r\n    something to bargain with. If the Cape Franchise should ever go, its\r\n    place will be taken by something which will benefit all the natives\r\n    and be acceptable to all.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a different quarter came even stronger expression of gratitude.\r\nM. Jacottet, of the Swiss Mission, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I beg on behalf of all my fellow-missionaries in Basutoland, as\r\n    well as of all the friends of justice and liberty in this territory,\r\n    to thank you most sincerely for your courageous and strong advocacy\r\n    of the rights and interests of Basutoland and the other territories.\r\n    All thoughtful and civilized Basutos know how much they are indebted\r\n    to you, and your name is held in reverence by them.\"]\r\n\r\nSir Charles, always a strong advocate of colonial autonomy, nevertheless\r\ndid not go to extreme lengths in this doctrine. An Imperialist first, he\r\nwas fully prepared to say to the colonies, So long as you claim Imperial\r\nprotection, you must recognize the full rights of citizenship within the\r\nEmpire. He feared gravely the tendencies which might develop under the\r\nBritish flag, if uncontrolled liberty of action were given to the\r\nColonial Parliaments in dealing with such questions as forced labour.\r\n\"The Australian rule in New Guinea is going to be terrible,\" is a stray\r\nnote on one of his communications with the Aborigines' Protection\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nThis labour question was to him essentially the problem of the future,\r\nand he watched its developments with ceaseless anxiety. At the annual\r\nmeeting of the society in April, 1910, he spoke of the energy which the\r\nColonial Office displayed in promoting the growing of cotton as laudable\r\nbut dangerous. \"The chiefs had sometimes exercised compulsion to make\r\ntheir tribes cultivate the unfamiliar product.\" More generally he felt\r\nthat wherever the white man introduced taxation there would be a\r\ntendency to requisition labour, and that all such projects would\r\ninevitably generate an interested commercial support. The Portuguese\r\nsystem of recruiting for the cocoa plantations might be barbarous; but\r\nif it were pleaded in defence that without it the supply of cocoa must\r\nfail, Sir Charles foresaw the gravest difficulties with the House of\r\nCommons. \"How are we to make that 'would-be' practical Assembly tell the\r\nGovernment to induce Portugal to put an end to so enormous a\r\ncultivation?\" The only method of avoiding these evils was to prevent\r\ntheir growth; and the soundest plan was to insure that the natives\r\nretained their own familiar means of livelihood, and so could not be\r\nbrought down to the choice between starvation and selling their labour\r\nin a restricted market. For that reason he fiercely opposed the whole\r\npolicy of concessions, and by public and private representations he\r\npressed the Colonial Office to reject every such alienation of native\r\nrights in the land.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to read a paper on Indentured and Forced Labour at the\r\nNative Races Conference held in July, 1911. It reviewed all the facts of\r\nthe situation as they existed--the growing demand for indentured\r\nservice, the respective record of the European Powers, and the varying\r\nresults produced by varying methods which the same Power has adopted in\r\ndifferent regions. It was, he thought, not easy to decide whether the\r\nanti-slavery cause had lost or gained ground in his lifetime; new\r\ninsidious and widespread forms of the evil had taken a hold. Great\r\nBritain's escutcheon was marred by the inclusion of a colour-bar in the\r\nmost recent Constitution of her oversea dominions; and the Government of\r\nIndia had recently failed to obtain from some British States that\r\nmeasure of rights for emigrating British Indian subjects which it had\r\nformerly been able to secure. Forced labour was being employed under\r\nBritish auspices in Egypt; while the French, who had \"more nearly than\r\nany other nation\" done away with this evil in colonies, were open to\r\ngrave reproach in the matter of concessions--especially in that region\r\nwhere French administration was affected by the neighbouring example of\r\nthe Congo Free State. The danger both of forced labour and of\r\nconcessions was that they alike tended to destroy native law and tribal\r\ncustom, and so to create 'one universal black proletariat'--a vast\r\nreservoir of cheap defenceless labour.\r\n\r\nWhat he wrote was duly read at the Conference, and is included in the\r\nvolume of their proceedings called _Inter-Racial Problems_. But before\r\nthe Conference took place, silence had been imposed for ever on this\r\nadvocate of equal justice. Among his papers is the manuscript of this\r\ncomposition corrected for the press by him within a week of his death--\r\nwork done against the entreaty of those who cared for him, but work that\r\nhe would not leave undone.\r\n\r\nIn defending the interest of the native races, Dilke always felt himself\r\nto be defending the dignity and the safety of labour at home--even\r\nthough the representatives of European labour did not recognize the\r\ncommon concern. He was defending labour where it was weakest; and it is\r\nin his championship of the weak that one of the younger men who worked\r\nwith him and learnt from him sees the characteristic note of his life.\r\nGeneral Seely writes:\r\n\r\n    \"To many of the younger men who found themselves in the Parliament\r\n    of 1900 Dilke was an enigma. We could all appreciate his immense\r\n    store of knowledge, his untiring industry, his courtesy to younger\r\n    men, and his striking personality. But what the real purpose was to\r\n    which he was devoting these talents, what was the end in view--put\r\n    shortly, 'what he was at'--was to us a puzzle.\r\n\r\n    \"Clearly, it was no bitter hostility either to a Government with\r\n    which as a Radical he profoundly disagreed, or to an Opposition\r\n    amongst whom he sat, but whose chiefs had not restored him to their\r\n    inner councils. Not the former, for in matters of foreign policy and\r\n    in Imperial Defence, where his unrivalled knowledge gave him\r\n    powerful weapons of attack, he never pursued an advantage he had\r\n    gained beyond very moderate limits. Not the second, for no man was\r\n    more steadfast in his attendance and in his support, given by speech\r\n    and in the lobby, to those of his own political faith.\r\n\r\n    \"Still less was it personal ambition or self-seeking; for if he\r\n    spoke often, it was only to put forward some definite point of view,\r\n    and not for the purpose of taking part in a debate just because the\r\n    House was crowded and the occasion important.\r\n\r\n    \"Least of all was his constant attendance in the House of Commons\r\n    the refuge of a man with no other object in life, for no man was\r\n    more many-sided or had so many and such varied interests.\r\n\r\n    \"His Parliamentary action was often baffling to the observer,\r\n    especially in its restraint. It was only after many years that the\r\n    present writer found the master-key to Dilke's actions, and it was\r\n    revealed in a flash at the time of the passing of the South Africa\r\n    Union Act. The question was the representation of the native\r\n    population in the Union, and the cognate questions of their\r\n    treatment and status. Dilke came to see me. He pleaded the native\r\n    cause with earnestness, with eloquence, with passion. The man was\r\n    transfigured as the emotions of pity and love of justice swept over\r\n    him. No record could be kept of what he said; there could have been\r\n    no thought of using his eloquence to enlist popular support or\r\n    improve a Parliamentary position, for we were alone. And so I came\r\n    to see that the mainspring of all his actions was the intense desire\r\n    to help those who could not help themselves--to defend the\r\n    under-dog.\r\n\r\n    \"Looking through the long list of the speeches he made, and of the\r\n    questions he asked, from the beginning of the Parliament of 1900\r\n    until the time of his death, one sees plainly that this was his\r\n    guiding motive. No detail was so small as to escape his attention if\r\n    the people he was endeavouring to protect were poor and helpless.\r\n\r\n    \"On the wider questions of the general treatment of natives he\r\n    displayed the same meticulous care in finding out the true facts of\r\n    the case. In the controversy that raged round the administration of\r\n    the Congo, he would not move until he had ascertained the facts, not\r\n    only from official documents, but from inquiries he himself had set\r\n    on foot. Indians, Africans, Chinese, as well as his own countrymen\r\n    and countrywomen, all would find in him a champion and defender,\r\n    provided only that they were poor, unrepresented, or oppressed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the defence of the \"under-dog\" was a duty imposed by our\r\nacknowledged sovereignty or by international obligations.\r\n\r\nWhat might follow from the growing rush for tropical products, capital\r\npursuing large returns \"into every jungle in the world,\" was shown to\r\nEurope, in the last months of Sir Charles's life, by the revelations\r\nfrom the Amazon Valley, a scandal to which he was among the first to\r\ncall attention. This was a region where Great Britain had no special\r\nduty. But a series of facts not less horrible, on a scale infinitely\r\nvaster, and affecting a population which, originally, could not have\r\nnumbered less than thirty millions, had, long before the Putumayo\r\nrevelations, been proved to exist throughout the basin of a great\r\nAfrican river. No labour of Sir Charles's later years was more\r\ncontinuous and persistent than his effort to fix on the Imperial\r\nParliament the responsibility for what was done in the Congo Free State,\r\nand the duty of putting an end to it.\r\n\r\n    \"He perceived with increasing clearness of vision, as the years went\r\n    on,\" says Mr. Morel, \"that the future relationship between the white\r\n    and coloured races in the tropical regions of the globe was bound up\r\n    with the problem of the Congo, and that the effects of the success\r\n    or the failure of the movement for Congo reform would govern in\r\n    great measure the attitude of Europe towards these questions for\r\n    very many years.\"\r\n\r\nA State that had been brought into being by England's express sanction,\r\nfor solemnly defined purposes of civilization in Africa, was proved by\r\nits own agent to be employing cannibal troops. That was the circumstance\r\nwhich most impressed a startled House of Commons when, on April 2nd,\r\n1897, Sir Charles raised the first of many discussions upon the question\r\nof the Congo.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 a violent action had brought home to England what had been the\r\nfulfilment of the promised free trade for all nations, and of King\r\nLeopold's protestations in 1884. Mr. Stokes, a British trader, was\r\narrested and shot by the order of a Belgian officer, Major Lothaire. His\r\noffence was trading in ivory. Sir Charles, when he raised the debate in\r\nApril, 1897, combined then as always the diplomatic with the\r\nhumanitarian aspect of the case; and brought before the House the\r\nexistence of the secret decree of September, 1891, declaring a State\r\nmonopoly of all rubber and ivory, for violation of which Mr. Stokes had\r\nbeen executed. [Footnote: Stokes was also accused of bartering guns to\r\nthe Arabs for that ivory. This, true or not, does not affect the initial\r\noutrage, that, though he was entitled to a proper trial, he was trapped\r\nand summarily executed without trial of any kind.] But it was the\r\npublication of Captain Hinde's book, [Footnote: _The Fall of the Congo\r\nArabs_.] with its revelation of the fact that European officers had\r\ncommanded an army fed for long periods by organized cannibalism, which\r\ngave authority to Sir Charles's demand for a new conference of the\r\nPowers. \"We should take action,\" he said, \"to remove from ourselves the\r\ndisgrace which had fallen upon our declarations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Curzon, who as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs then spoke for\r\nLord Salisbury's Government, treated the matter coolly enough, though\r\nadmitting that the agents of the Congo State had sometimes adopted\r\nmethods repugnant to Christian feeling; and so for the moment the\r\ncontroversy ended, but Sir Charles with persistent application returned\r\nto the question again and again, although his efforts were hampered by\r\nlack of information. So well was the secret of those dark places kept\r\nthat even he, with his widespread net of acquaintance in many capitals,\r\nfound facts hard to gather; and he was naturally attracted by the\r\nappearance in 1900 of a series of anonymous articles in the _Speaker_,\r\nwhich dealt with the system set up in the Congo, and its inevitable\r\nresults. These articles displayed an unusual knowledge of the whole\r\ncomplicated subject, and revealed aspects of it which had previously\r\nbaffled inquiry. The writer proved to be Mr. E. D. Morel. So began a\r\nco-operation whose influence upon the administration of African races\r\nwas destined to be far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was steadily pressed. Within the House of Commons, Sir\r\nCharles spoke session after session, using language of a vehemence that\r\nstartled in one so moderate. He organized representations to the Senate\r\nand Chamber in Belgium, summarizing what was being done in the Congo and\r\nurging Belgium's moral responsibility. Out of doors, the Press campaign\r\nwas vigorous--so vigorous that no Government could disregard it; and at\r\nthe beginning of 1903, in reply to a question from Sir Charles, Mr.\r\nBalfour promised a formal debate \"on the position of the signatories to\r\nthe Berlin General Act of 1885, in regard to the abuses which had grown\r\nup under the Congo Free State's rule in violation of that Act.\" The\r\ndebate, on May 20th, 1903, was opened by Mr. Herbert Samuel. Sir\r\nCharles, following him, was in turn supported by Sir John Gorst, an old\r\nally in such causes. Mr. Balfour, in face of a unanimous House,\r\naccepted, not without reluctance, the motion which asked him to consult\r\nthe co-signatories of the Berlin Act, and thus committed Great Britain\r\nto a diplomatic re-opening of the case. Inquiry necessarily followed,\r\nand with the publication of our Consul's report in December, 1903, the\r\naffair reached a new phase.\r\n\r\nWhen the Foreign Office vote came to be discussed in the Session of\r\n1904, Sir Charles, basing himself on that report, delivered what Sir\r\nJohn Gorst called a \"terrible speech.\" Replying for the Government, Lord\r\nPercy used these words: \"There never has been a policy of which it might\r\nbe said as truly as of this one that it was the policy not so much of\r\nHis Majesty's Government as of the House of Commons.\" Not less is it\r\ntrue that Sir Charles had guided the House to the adoption of that\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nBy this time the cause commanded popular interest. The questioning of\r\nMinisters was frequent, and it was done by men from all camps. Sir\r\nCharles could afford henceforward to select his portion of the work. He\r\nlimited himself as far as possible to the diplomatic aspect of the case,\r\nmore technical and less popular in its appeal, but giving the surest\r\nright of intervention.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office does not naturally look with favour upon policies\r\nforced upon it by the House of Commons, and perhaps for this reason the\r\npermanent officials proved opponents very difficult for the House of\r\nCommons to control. But Sir Charles's knowledge gave him the necessary\r\nadvantage. For instance, on November 22nd, 1906, he asked if the United\r\nStates had not expressed a desire to co-operate with Great Britain in\r\nthis matter. An official denial was given. On December 16th the question\r\nwas put again, and the admission made that \"the United States have\r\nrecently expressed\" such a desire.\r\n\r\nAfter various obscure negotiations on the part of King Leopold to secure\r\nGerman support for his personal rule, there came at length with the\r\nbeginning of 1907 the announcement that Belgium would annex the Free\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The delay which took place in the transference of the Congo\r\nFree State from the personal rule of King Leopold to the rule of the\r\nBelgian Government is dealt with in the following letter from Lord\r\nFitzmaurice from the Foreign Office to Sir Charles:\r\n\r\n\"_February_ 16th, 1906.--The King of the Belgians puts about these\r\nstories for the same sort of reason which made the German Emperor put\r\nabout the story that there was a change of policy in regard to France.\r\nAt the same time there must be a little 'law' given to the King while\r\nhis second Commission is reporting on the methods of carrying out the\r\nreforms indicated in the first Commission's report. As you know, I am\r\nnot a believer in the King 'at all, at all,' but one has to observe the\r\nforms of diplomacy. It is, perhaps, not unfortunate that this pause\r\ncoincides with a moment when it is not our interest to be having a row\r\nwith Belgium also, if perchance we were having a row with Germany.\" This\r\nletter was written while the Algeciras Conference was sitting.]\r\n\r\nYet the matter was not allowed to sleep in either House of Parliament;\r\nit was raised by Sir Charles on the Whitsuntide adjournment, and again\r\nin August. In 1908 the subject was mentioned in the King's Speech. But\r\nby this time a \"Colonial Law\" had been proposed in Belgium, which went\r\nfar to re-establish King Leopold's power under the new system and\r\ncreated new difficulties. Sir Charles's allies now were not in England\r\nonly. He had made friends with M. Vandervelde, leader of the Socialist\r\nparty in Belgium, and the one Socialist who had ventured to vote for\r\nannexation. They met during Sir Charles's Christmas stay in Paris in\r\n1907, and had \"two days' thorough discussion of Congo.\" The result was\r\nwritten to Lord Fitzmaurice (then Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs)\r\non January 6th, 1908: \"I tell you confidentially that, after seeing\r\nVandervelde, I cease to advise moderation, and shall say so to the\r\nprivate Congo Reform meeting called for the 21st.\" This tone made itself\r\nfelt in the debate on the Address, and in two subsequent discussions.\r\nThe points pressed for were, first, that Belgium in taking over the\r\nCongo should take over fully and honor the Free State's treaty\r\nobligations, and, secondly, that full guarantees should be given for\r\nnative rights. [Footnote: On Sir Charles Dilke's action in regard to the\r\nCongo, see also _Red Rubber_ (T. Fisher Unwin), pp. 4, 11, 177, 195; and\r\n_Great Britain and the Congo_ (Smith, Elder and Co.), pp. 122, 124, 138,\r\n142, 193, by Mr. E. D. Morel. The official organs of the Congo Reform\r\nAssociation from 1904 until Sir Charles's death contain a complete\r\nrecord of his speeches, both in the House and outside, during this\r\nperiod.]\r\n\r\nBut discussion in the Belgian Parliament showed reluctance to accept\r\nthis view, and on November 4th, 1908, a strong memorandum was despatched\r\nby Great Britain. When Parliament reassembled in 1909, a question put by\r\nSir Charles elicited the fact that no answer had been returned to this\r\ndespatch, and an amendment to the Address was put down by a Unionist,\r\nSir Gilbert Parker. Sir Charles, in supporting it, laid special stress\r\non backing from America, being well aware that relations were strained\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nHis speech indicated some fear that the question might be submitted to\r\nthe Hague Conference.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"is not our intention. That is not what Parliament\r\nmeant. That is not the policy which successive Governments have given\r\ntheir adhesion to. In a state of Europe far more disturbed, even Lord\r\nCastlereagh several times took in similar matters far stronger action\r\nthan is now necessary.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Parliament elected in 1906 did not see the end of this affair;\r\nand when they next met in February, 1910, King Leopold had died, and\r\nthere was a new King of the Belgians. On March 10th, Sir George White\r\nmoved upon the matter, pointing out that there was no improvement in the\r\ntreatment of the natives and no extension of freedom for trade; and the\r\nForeign Secretary replied in a somewhat ambiguous speech. Annexation, he\r\nsaid, had not yet received the sanction of Great Britain, and could not\r\nuntil improvement in the administration had taken place. But beyond this\r\nnegative attitude of disapproval, Sir Edward Grey seemed to think that\r\nGreat Britain could not wisely act alone, and that under the Berlin Act\r\nisolated action was in some measure barred. This, in the temper of the\r\nmoment, was construed as a hint that insistence on reform might drive\r\nBelgium into the arms of Germany. Sir Charles said in this debate:\r\n\r\n    \"There is one case, and one only, where I think we see very distinct\r\n    signs of weakening in our policy, a weakening caused by terror, and\r\n    undue terror, of the risks which may follow. The papers issued by\r\n    the Belgian Government with regard to the Congo show a distinct\r\n    weakening of attitude on our part.... In the Belgian despatch they\r\n    treat us with contempt, with a sort of lofty scorn which is almost\r\n    inconceivable. I have never known such a thing before; it is an\r\n    entirely new departure.\r\n\r\n    \"I believe the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has been here\r\n    to-day, knowing that many members in all quarters of the House have\r\n    incurred a certain disappointment, which is reflected in the letter\r\n    in to-day's papers from the Archbishop of Canterbury, with regard to\r\n    the speech with which he wound up the other night the short debate\r\n    upon the Congo question.... He says that we have not weakened our\r\n    position, that we have given nothing away, that we have not\r\n    'recognized.' But it is not a mere paper recognition or a paper\r\n    non-recognition to which we attach high importance and which we\r\n    formerly thought we understood from his speeches.... We have before\r\n    us a Bill for the largest naval expenditure that our country has\r\n    ever incurred in time of peace. We add for the first time to that\r\n    expenditure colonial expenditure which swells out beyond that of our\r\n    own Estimates. The House has supported those Estimates, and the\r\n    Empire is spending on land forces even a larger amount than it is\r\n    spending on the fleet. None of us believe that war is probable, but\r\n    we do think, and many of us in this House believe, that the\r\n    armaments of this country, if they are to have weight in time of\r\n    peace, ought to have weight behind our diplomacy; and if they are to\r\n    be justified by many of the arguments put before this House, there\r\n    is no reason why at this moment we should be afraid of our own\r\n    shadow. We have been afraid of our own shadow on the Congo question.\r\n    I think there can be no doubt that we have received from M. Renkin,\r\n    the Colonial Minister, such treatment as we have never had to put up\r\n    with from any Power, at all events in recent years.\" Dilke warned\r\n    members not to be silenced by unnecessary fears on these matters.\r\n    \"Not even a single question was asked in the far more dangerous case\r\n    of the ultimatum which we now know was sent to the Turkish\r\n    Government when they came into office in the beginning of 1906, in\r\n    regard to the occupation of the village of Tabah. That ultimatum\r\n    might have raised serious questions in that part of Europe. I think\r\n    a little more courage would be desirable in a case like that of the\r\n    Congo. It is not a question of ten pounds or one hundred pounds of\r\n    somebody's property. We are shocked in the case of the Congo because\r\n    that which would never happen is put as a conceivable danger at the\r\n    end of a long train of hypothetical events. It is said that there\r\n    might be an act of violence.... There would not be an act of\r\n    violence, and I beg the House not to be led away by the fear of\r\n    trifling complications following upon our insisting, not upon\r\n    anything new, but upon that which we have been insisting upon for\r\n    years past in a matter in which our moral obligation is very\r\n    weighty.\"\r\n\r\nYet it was not Sir Charles's fortune to see the fulfilment of the long\r\nlabour in which he had played so great a part. Not till three years\r\nlater--in June, 19l3--did the Congo Reform Association feel that its\r\nwork was completed, and that it could disband its forces.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's part had been to apply in Parliament the force that was\r\ngenerated outside. From a private position to have guided without\r\nseeming to dictate; to have inspired common action among colleagues\r\nholding all shades of political thought; to have avoided miscarriage by\r\ninfinite tact and patience; to have possessed so wide a knowledge of all\r\nthe complicated issues involved that official reluctance could never\r\navoid action by mysterious pretexts; to have been always so moderate in\r\nexpression that strong condemnation from him, when it came, was indeed\r\nweighty; to have watched time and opportunity, the dispositions of men,\r\nthe temper of the assembly--all this was necessary to carry through such\r\na Parliamentary task without the power of office, and all this Sir\r\nCharles performed. No finer example has been given of what in the\r\nImperial Parliament a member of Parliament can do; and Sir Charles Dilke\r\ncould well afford to be judged by it, and it alone, as typical of his\r\nlife-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ARMY\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This and the two following chapters are by Mr. Spenser\r\nWilkinson.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, 1885, in the course of a speech delivered to his\r\nconstituents, Dilke expressed his opinion on the subject of the reform\r\nof the army, then generally regarded as desirable, but also as so\r\nextremely difficult that the old Parliamentary hands shrank from\r\ngrappling with it. \"Everybody was agreed,\" he said, \"upon this point,\r\nthat we ought to have a strong navy, but there was more difference of\r\nopinion as to the army.\" Speaking personally, and without any authority\r\nfrom others, he felt desirous of throwing out a suggestion whether it\r\nwould not be possible to have a separate army for India and the\r\ncolonies, the army being treated as any other trade, and the men being\r\npermitted to withdraw when they pleased, with safeguards against the\r\ncountry being involved in loss when men came home prematurely. It would\r\nbe necessary, of course, to have special training for cavalry,\r\nengineers, and artillery, as well as officers and non-commissioned\r\nofficers; but he believed that for the great mass of the infantry, apart\r\nfrom the Indian and colonial army, we might safely rely upon the\r\nvolunteers, and encourage volunteering by special advantages.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion thus modestly thrown out in 1885 proved to be the prelude\r\nof the effort of Dilke's later life--to prepare the country and the\r\nEmpire for the times of storm and stress that were to come. His travels\r\nas a young man had given him an unrivalled acquaintance with the chief\r\ncountries of the world, and especially with those which constitute the\r\nBritish Empire. In the spring of 1887, in his articles on \"The Present\r\nPosition of European Politics,\" as already seen, he passed in review the\r\naims of the several Powers of Europe, and the military means which were\r\navailable for their furtherance. His conclusion, expressed in the first\r\nsentence of the first article, was that \"the present position of the\r\nEuropean world is one in which sheer force holds a larger place than it\r\nhas held in modern times since the fall of Napoleon.\" In this condition\r\nof Europe, the phenomenon that most impressed him was that \"England is\r\nof all Powers the most unprepared for war.\" That being the case, it\r\nseemed to him to be the first duty of a British Government to set in\r\norder the nation's defences. The next five years he devoted chiefly to\r\nan effort to master the subject, to which he gave the name of Imperial\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\nThe spirit and method of Dilke's work on the subject of preparation for\r\nwar mark him off from all his Parliamentary contemporaries into a class\r\nby himself. He took the subject of war seriously. He would not speak of\r\nit without knowledge, and, as he had not had the professional education\r\nof a naval or military officer, he associated himself as closely as\r\npossible in this part of his work with those who appeared to him the\r\nmost completely to command the subject. His own words were: \"Writing on\r\nthe British Army as a civilian, I am only accepting an invitation which\r\nsoldiers have often given to their fellow-countrymen. At the same time I\r\nhave not the presumption to write without military help.\" [Footnote:\r\n_The British Army_, p. 1.]\r\n\r\nHe diligently studied the military literature of the day, English and\r\nforeign, treating of the questions he was considering, and collected a\r\ngreat number of official reports and other documents which he digested.\r\nAt the same time he entered into correspondence with the best soldiers,\r\nin order to learn and appreciate their views. Prominent among these was\r\nSir Frederick Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief in India, with whom\r\nduring the whole period he was in constant communication. He also sought\r\nthe collaboration of some congenial student of the problems of war,\r\norganization, and national defence, in order to insure the thorough\r\ndiscussion of all points, and to guard himself against the temptation to\r\nattach too much importance to his own impressions. He wished to acquaint\r\nhimself with, and to reproduce in his writings, the best that was known\r\nand thought in the military world. In 1887, while writing his articles\r\non European Politics, he frequently consulted in this way Colonel\r\nCharles Brackenbury, R.A., one of the most accomplished officers of the\r\nprogressive school, a master of his profession and a clear exponent of\r\nits principles.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit and in these conditions was written the sixth article of\r\nthe series on European Politics, published in June, 1887, and entitled\r\n\"The United Kingdom.\" It was an account of the country's military\r\nweakness and a plea for a much-needed improvement of the army. \"We spend\r\nmore upon war services than does any other empire in the world.... It is\r\nbelieved abroad, and I fear with reason, that even within the last two\r\nyears our stock of rifles was so small that there were only enough guns\r\nin store to arm the first-class army reserve, so that, in fact, there\r\nwas from the military point of view no reserve of rifles, and that our\r\nammunition stood at about a similar point of exhaustion.... The most\r\ncapable men of the army tell us very frankly that they are almost in\r\ndespair at its condition.\"\r\n\r\nAssuming for the moment that all idea were given up of fulfilling the\r\nnation's treaty obligations for the defence of Turkey and of Belgium,\r\nand that no more were aimed at than the defence of India, of England,\r\nand of the colonies, \"even upon this reduced estimate of our\r\nresponsibilities, in the opinion of all competent men, we fall short of\r\npower to accomplish our task.\" In view of this state of things Dilke\r\nsuggested methods of increasing the strength of the nation, and of\r\nobtaining value for the money spent. In the first place, \"it is\r\nnecessary for the statesmen, or if the statesmen will not, then for the\r\npublic, to lay down for the soldiers a basis of military policy.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It certainly seems clear, even to those who are not great\r\n    scientific soldiers, that there is sufficient risk of invasion to\r\n    make it essential to our position that we should have plenty of\r\n    cavalry and artillery, plenty of officers, plenty of guns,\r\n    ammunition, and other stores, always in readiness to supplement the\r\n    large force of infantry which is provided for us by the militia and\r\n    volunteers.... The things we need to keep in hand are the things\r\n    which cannot be suddenly improvised--cavalry, artillery, transport,\r\n    officers, and stores. We can, whatever some soldiers may say, make\r\n    effective infantry of our volunteers in a short space of time.\"\r\n\r\n    \"What we have to look to are, mainly, the defence of India, the\r\n    defence of England, and the supply of a possible expeditionary\r\n    force. For the defence of India we need, according to an opinion\r\n    which I expressed at the date of the first introduction of short\r\n    service, a long-service army.\" Dilke quoted Major Buxton's words:\r\n    \"For home service and European warfare we need a reserve, and\r\n    therefore a short-service army. What difficulties do not hamper us\r\n    in striving to reconcile short service with foreign service! Divide\r\n    the two services and all becomes simple. The foreign service army\r\n    ... requires yearly fewer recruits, becomes acclimatized, and has\r\n    fewer green young men in its ranks; it is never relieved home,\r\n    though it moves about abroad. The question of home and foreign\r\n    reliefs is closed for ever. Recruits go out, and time-expired men\r\n    come home; that is all.\" \"On the other hand, for the home army,\"\r\n    Dilke wrote, \"I would rely very largely upon the militia or\r\n    volunteers, and for the infantry privates of the expeditionary army,\r\n    upon special volunteers from the militia or volunteers.... I am\r\n    convinced that the time required, provided that your officers and\r\n    non-commissioned officers are well trained, to make an infantry\r\n    private is not very great.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Instead of trying to imitate at one time the Prussians, and at\r\n    another the French, we ought, in my belief, to strike out a\r\n    thoroughly national system for ourselves\"--the direction to be taken\r\n    being that of \"giving high efficiency to the elements which cannot\r\n    be rapidly created in the home army, and the loyal adoption for the\r\n    infantry of the principle of localization and of union with the\r\n    militia and volunteers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and winter, with Brackenbury's collaboration, which was\r\nnot disclosed, as Brackenbury was an officer on the active list, Dilke\r\nwrote for the _Fortnightly Review_ a second series of articles,\r\nentitled, like the volume in which they were afterwards collected, _The\r\nBritish Army_. The first article appeared in November. After its\r\npublication, Lord Wolseley wrote: \"I have at this moment finished what I\r\nmay be allowed to call your very interesting military article in the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_. I trust it may be read by every voter, and may\r\nturn public opinion to the shortcomings of our army and of our military\r\nestablishments.\" Dilke thereupon wrote to ask Wolseley for some account,\r\nof which public use might be made, of his views upon the condition of\r\nthe army and of the necessary reforms. Wolseley replied at some length,\r\nand said: \"I should not like any quotation made from this very hurriedly\r\nwritten letter, but if you care to do so you may say in any of your\r\narticles that I entertain these views and opinions.\" Wolseley's views\r\nwere given, accordingly, in the third article, in a paraphrase of his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nA more complete exposition of England's unreadiness for war has never\r\nbeen written than was contained in _The British Army_. It revealed the\r\nneglect of successive Governments to ascertain and determine the\r\npurposes for which in war the army would be employed, and the standards,\r\nquantitative and qualitative, of the military forces which ought to be\r\nkept ready. It showed the evils of excessive centralization. For an\r\nexpenditure as great as that of a Continental military Power the War\r\nOffice maintained a regular army, as to which it was doubtful whether it\r\ncould mobilize, in a condition to take the field, a single army corps.\r\nThe militia was imperfectly officered. The volunteer force was of\r\nunequal quality, and the mass of its officers inadequately trained for\r\nwar. It was without field artillery, and the guns with which in case of\r\nwar it ought to be accompanied did not exist. The regular army at home\r\nwas sacrificed to the necessity of furnishing reliefs to the army in\r\nIndia, which, however, was not in a condition to defend that country\r\nagainst serious attack.\r\n\r\nThe system on which Continental armies were raised, organized, and\r\ntrained, was explained, and proposals were made for reform of the\r\nBritish system. The suggestion was repeated that the British army in\r\nIndia should be rendered independent of the military administration at\r\nhome, and the home army be relieved of the burden of supplying reliefs\r\nto India. This would render possible the introduction of true short\r\nservice at home, and the enlistment for the Indian army of men willing\r\nto serve for comparatively long periods as professional soldiers. It was\r\nmaintained that for national defence it would be found necessary to rely\r\nmainly upon the volunteers, and that therefore they should be given a\r\nplace in the system corresponding to the call which would have to be\r\nmade upon them in case of war. In the regular army those elements should\r\nbe specially maintained which least admit of rapid training--cavalry,\r\nfield and horse artillery--and a General Staff of an English type ought\r\nto be developed.\r\n\r\nThe cogency of Sir Charles Dilke's appeal to his countrymen to attend to\r\nthe subject of defence, the weight of authority behind his exposition of\r\nthe failure of the military administration, and the appropriateness of\r\nthe reforms which he suggested, will be better conveyed by the quotation\r\nof a few passages than by a summary:\r\n\r\n\"The reign of force of which I have often spoken is so marked at present\r\nthat no Power can consider itself safe unless it is ready at any time to\r\ndefend its interests.\" \"Humanly speaking, we can trust for our\r\nprotection in the last resort only to our strong right arm.\" \"Time is\r\nslipping by, and the unreadiness of England is a danger to the peace of\r\nthe world.\" \"It is time that party politics should be put aside on\r\nquestions relating to the national defence.\" He pointed out how\r\ndangerous was the influence of those \"who may almost be said to oppose\r\nall military expenditure, and yet whose ability and honesty gave them a\r\ndeserved influence with the electors.\" \"It was impossible to adopt a\r\npolicy of disarmament without grave danger for the future;\" but if it\r\nwas to be prevented, \"the people have to be shown that large\r\nexpenditure, not only upon naval but also upon military purposes, is a\r\nnecessity of the time.\" He deprecated \"the unwisdom of those who,\r\nthinking our present position unsatisfactory, and more or less agreeing\r\nabout the main lines of the remedies to be applied, fight among\r\nthemselves.... The points which have a real importance are not those on\r\nwhich we differ, but those upon which we are agreed.\"\r\n\r\nThe first question that he wished to have cleared up was what the\r\ncountry would fight for. He pointed out that England was bound by treaty\r\nto support the defence of Turkey against Russia, though he doubted\r\nwhether English opinion would support that policy, and to defend the\r\nneutrality of Belgium, as to which he thought the attitude of\r\nGovernments had been ambiguous. He would himself approve of fulfilling\r\nour treaty obligations as regards that country, but he said: \"If indeed\r\nwe are to defend the neutrality of Belgium, we may at any time find\r\nourselves involved in a Continental war against Germany, with France and\r\nBelgium for our Allies.\" He was prepared to accept as a minimum basis\r\nfor preparation the assumption \"that we ought to defend the\r\ncoaling-stations, to be in a position to defend ourselves in India and\r\nat home, and to send, if need were, two army corps abroad as an\r\nexpeditionary force.\"\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty of proving a case against the sufficiency and\r\nefficiency of the army lay in the fact \"that, while soldiers are very\r\nwilling to communicate information in their possession as to our present\r\nweakness, to those who, they think may help in any degree to set things\r\nstraight, they not unnaturally shrink from the publication of their\r\nnames.\" Yet Dilke was able to express the views of Sir Frederick\r\nRoberts, communicated to him very fully, and more briefly those of Lord\r\nWolseley. He was also able to quote Wolseley's statement to a Royal\r\nCommission, that \"if a hostile force of, say, 100,000 men were to land\r\nupon our shores, there is no reason whatever, if that 100,000 were\r\nproperly led, why they should not take possession of London.... We are\r\nnot in the position we ought to be in, nor do I believe we are in the\r\nposition we should be in if the English people were told the whole\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The inefficiency of our present organization, and its wastefulness,\r\n    are admitted by persons who differ as greatly the one from the other\r\n    as, on the one hand, the chief of the 'Economists,' Lord Randolph\r\n    Churchill, and, on the other, the soldiers who are the object of his\r\n    scorn--Lord Wolseley, Sir Frederick Roberts, and General\r\n    Brackenbury. [Footnote: General Sir Henry Brackenbury, brother of\r\n    Colonel Charles Brackenbury.] Our present position is, therefore,\r\n    condemned all round, and the day has come when it behoves every\r\n    Englishman to have an opinion as to the direction in which the\r\n    remedy is to be sought.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To form armies which will be of any value against the power of\r\n    'armed nations,' it is necessary to provide modern weapons, and here\r\n    again we are weak just where we should be strong.... It is one of\r\n    the most astonishing features of our 'system' that, with all our\r\n    enormous expenditure, we manage to drop behind other nations both in\r\n    the quality of our weapons and the proportional number of them to\r\n    the hands that would have to use them. The reason probably is that\r\n    the country has gradually arrived at the absurd belief that Great\r\n    Britain alone of all nations in the world can by prudence escape the\r\n    common lot, and never have war again except with savages. From this\r\n    unfounded and unwise opinion springs grave carelessness as to the\r\n    condition of the military forces, and Governments desirous of\r\n    presenting a comparatively small Budget fail to keep up the\r\n    necessary quantity of arms and stores, because deficiency in these\r\n    is a weakness easy to conceal.... Thus we, who should always be in a\r\n    state of readiness to supply arms to improvised forces, and to\r\n    colonial levies, have never enough for the purposes of the home\r\n    army. We are always compromising between the popularity of a\r\n    Government and the safety of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be shown later on how Dilke, when the time came, upheld this\r\nopinion by his vote in Parliament, even against his own party and to the\r\nsacrifice of his own political interests.\r\n\r\n    \"For an expenditure of nineteen millions the Germans can put into\r\n    the field nineteen army corps of 37,000 men each, besides an\r\n    enormous force of garrison troops and a territorial army, of which\r\n    they could rapidly make a field army of thirty-five army corps in\r\n    all. For an expenditure of twice nineteen millions we can put into\r\n    the field in India two army corps, of which one is composed of\r\n    native troops, but in the United Kingdom, in General Brackenbury's\r\n    words, owing to our defective organization, we should scarcely be\r\n    able to put one; but if the army were properly organized we should\r\n    be able to put two into the field.\"\r\n\r\nYet it could not be said that the British army fell short in numbers:\r\n\r\n    \"The army proper, the militia, the army reserve and militia reserve,\r\n    the volunteers, the native troops in India, the 36,000 Canadian\r\n    militia of the first line, about 16,000 men in Australia and New\r\n    Zealand, the South African local forces of between six and seven\r\n    thousand well-trained men, the Irish constabulary, the armed and\r\n    drilled portion of the Indian constabulary, the Hyderabad\r\n    contingent, and the marines, easily make up a total of a million of\r\n    men fit for some kind of land service, of whom very nearly the whole\r\n    are supposed to serve even in time of peace.\"\r\n\r\n    \"We are more saving of peace taxes than of war debt.... If the\r\n    arrangement for strict saving in time of peace and for wild waste in\r\n    time of war was ever a wise one, which in my opinion it was not,\r\n    even in the days of old-fashioned armies, it is certainly foolish in\r\n    these times of rapid mobilization.... We are in these times exposed\r\n    to war at a day's notice, and to invasion at very short notice, if\r\n    our fleet can be divided or drawn away and beaten in detail.\"\r\n\r\n    \"We are not without men who could reduce our non-system to system.\r\n    Sir F. Roberts, who has partly done this in India so far as the\r\n    white army goes, and has attempted, in spite of resistance at home,\r\n    to reform the native force--Sir F. Roberts could do it. Lord\r\n    Wolseley, whose organization of each of his expeditions has been\r\n    careful, energetic, and in every way remarkable, and who in his\r\n    _Soldier's Pocket-Book_ has produced the best of all handbooks to\r\n    the elements of the art of war--Lord Wolseley could do it. But the\r\n    existing system does not do it.\"\r\n\r\nIn examining the Continental system, Dilke enumerated what he thought\r\nthe principal points. They were, first of all, personal service by all\r\nmen, which produced an enormous trained reserve; then complete\r\nlocalization both of troops and stores; fully worked out plans of\r\nmobilization and arrangements for obtaining horses instantly on the\r\noutbreak of war; and last, but not least, \"the organization of a General\r\nStaff which shall act as the brain and nervous system of the army, and\r\nshall draw to it and pass through its training as large a number of\r\nofficers as possible, so that experienced staff officers shall be\r\nnumerous in the event of war.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his appreciation of the Continental system, Dilke did not\r\nadvocate universal compulsory service:\r\n\r\n    \"Many of my correspondents cannot understand why I do not advocate\r\n    for the British army that same general service which now prevails\r\n    almost universally on the Continent, and brings with it so many good\r\n    fruits both for the nation and the army. I have, as I have shown, no\r\n    personal objection to it, but I have pointed out the existence of a\r\n    fatal obstacle in certain forms of English and Scotch religious and\r\n    certain forms of English commercial thought. It would be unpractical\r\n    to consider at length a measure which stands no present chance of\r\n    adoption. The time may come when we shall be drawn into a struggle\r\n    for life or death, and it seems to me that it will very probably\r\n    come within the next ten years, and maybe bring with it the\r\n    necessity for that general service which would now be impossible of\r\n    attainment. For our present ideas of the imperial position general\r\n    service is not necessary, and, moreover, until some capacity is\r\n    shown for organizing the troops which we already possess, I do not\r\n    see the slightest use in obtaining a large number of fresh men. But,\r\n    in view of the reign of force which now exists in Europe, and of\r\n    slowly but surely advancing danger in the East, it is impossible to\r\n    contemplate an ideal defence of the Empire without supposing that\r\n    the inhabitants of Great Britain and all her colonies may arrive at\r\n    a condition in which every strong man shall recognize that he owes\r\n    to the State some kind of defensive military service. I have tried\r\n    to make it plain that such service need not be in the regular army;\r\n    still less need any man with us be taken against his will to fight\r\n    outside the limits of his own country. But there can be no ideal\r\n    defence in which the bulk of the population is not trained, however\r\n    slightly, in the handling of military weapons, and the individual\r\n    man trained in spirit to believe that the hearths and homes where\r\n    his sisters or his wife live free from danger owe their immunity\r\n    from attack, not merely to a half-despised 'mercenary army,' but to\r\n    the strength and the skill of his own right arm.\"\r\n\r\n    \"My first condition for an ideal British organization would be\r\n    freedom of the fleet from the calls of local defence. The maritime\r\n    fortresses and coaling-stations should all be capable of defending\r\n    themselves.\" This meant, of course, guns and garrisons. \"My second\r\n    ideal principle would be to look to local help for all garrisons\r\n    where that system is possible, we retaining always a large staff of\r\n    specially well-trained officers for the purpose of organizing and\r\n    commanding local levies in war.\"\r\n\r\nDilke thought it needful for England to train as many officers as\r\npossible, especially as she had an ample supply of men capable, if\r\ntrained, of being good officers.\r\n\r\n    \"Is it possible to conceive a more absurd situation than that of the\r\n    wealthiest country in the world, with a vast reserve of high-blooded\r\n    youth lying idle, and enormous masses of warlike people, Sikhs,\r\n    Goorkhas, Mahrattas, Zulus, Arabs, Malays, and what not, under our\r\n    hands 'spoiling for a fight,' while this nation is unprepared to\r\n    defend its own possessions and its very existence in circumstances\r\n    which all know to be more than likely to occur? This nation, our\r\n    nation, might absolutely keep the peace of the world, yet shivers at\r\n    every breeze of Continental politics.\"\r\n\r\nDilke's scheme was for a professional army for India and for a citizen\r\narmy at home, in which the bulk of the infantry would be volunteers,\r\nwhile the special arms and the infantry of two army corps, destined to\r\nbe an expeditionary force, would be short-service soldiers. It was in\r\nits broad outlines a forecast of the actual development that has taken\r\nplace. In particular he proposed, what was carried out by Lord Haldane's\r\nAct, that \"the militia should become liable to general service in war,\r\nand should be organized and equipped accordingly. The volunteers should\r\nbe liable to be called out for home defence whenever the two army corps\r\nwere sent out of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n    \"My first object,\" he said in conclusion, \"has been to point out how\r\n    seriously our national military strength falls behind our\r\n    requirements, and how unready we always are, in spite of our huge\r\n    expenditure. My second object was to show that what we want most is,\r\n    not a great and expensive increase of the regular army, but an\r\n    endeavour to make the best possible use of what we have already, by\r\n    proper organization and by utilizing to the utmost the voluntary\r\n    principle, which best suits our national temper and that of the\r\n    colonies.... We stand in presence of new forces the power of which\r\n    is almost incalculable, and, while I admit that there are in the\r\n    army a great number of able men, perhaps more than there ever were,\r\n    capable both of creating new systems and of leading us to victory, I\r\n    am inclined to think that their characters have been formed in spite\r\n    of an obsolete and decaying system, and that they are restrained by\r\n    the incapacity of others and the carelessness of the country from\r\n    exercising the influence which their talents and energy ought to\r\n    command. If the question were one of commerce, liberty, or progress\r\n    in civil affairs, the nation would be interested, and would bring\r\n    the resources of its accumulated knowledge to bear on the subject.\r\n    But being, as it is, a question without the right settlement of\r\n    which neither commerce nor liberty is safe, the public is so little\r\n    in earnest about it that politicians are allowed to play with it,\r\n    and the serious needs of self-defence are sacrificed to the poor aim\r\n    of keeping constituencies in good-humour. Nothing can or will be\r\n    done by Governments of any party till the nation can be roused to\r\n    some expression of public opinion; and that opinion has to be formed\r\n    before it can be expressed. In the reign of force which now prevails\r\n    throughout Europe, carelessness as to our power of defence is\r\n    culpable beyond possibility of exaggeration, for we may have to\r\n    defend not only our individual interests as a nation, but all that\r\n    enormous influence for the good of mankind which is at present\r\n    exercised in the remotest parts of the earth by an enormous Empire\r\n    bent on preventing war and on spreading the blessings of peace.\"\r\n\r\nComing when it did, _The British Army_ made an impression on the\r\neducated public. It followed soon after the report of Sir James\r\nStephen's Commission, which had exposed the chaotic condition of the\r\nadministration of the army. Dilke revealed a grasp of every branch of\r\nthe subject. His criticisms reflected the judgment of officers familiar\r\nwith the branch of service discussed. His proposals were modest and\r\nintelligible, and in every case represented some body of competent\r\nmilitary opinion. He told the public much that none of his readers fully\r\nappreciated at the time. The German army had been largely increased in\r\nthe spring of 1887, and in the beginning of 1888 a Bill passed the\r\nReichstag which increased by a further 700,000 men the numbers available\r\nin case of war. Dilke explained in one of his chapters that, \"according\r\nto the calculations of the French Staff, the total number of armed men\r\nupon which Germany would be able to draw for all purposes would exceed\r\n7,000,000.\" [Footnote: The British Army, p. 161.] This and other\r\nforecasts may startle those readers whose curiosity tempts them to read\r\nthe volume again in 1917. But the work produced no practical result\r\nexcept to put Dilke into the front rank of army reformers. The\r\nGovernment took no action to remedy the military weakness which everyone\r\nrecognized. The report of the Stephen Commission remained a dead letter.\r\nIn June, 1888, a new Royal Commission was issued, in which the Marquis\r\nof Hartington, associated with a number of colleagues of Cabinet rank\r\nand with a General and an Admiral, was instructed to inquire into the\r\nadministration of the naval and military departments. The attempt at\r\nreform was postponed until these Commissioners should have made their\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL DEFENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's visit to India in 1888-1889 convinced him that he\r\nhad been right in believing the Indian army to be better prepared for\r\nwar than the portion of the army which was kept at home. A great\r\ndifficulty he now saw was that there were two rival plans of campaign,\r\nthe one cherished in India, the other by officers at home. \"The greater\r\nnumber of Indian officers expect to march with a large force into\r\nAfghanistan to meet the Russians, and believe that reinforcements will\r\nbe sent from England to swell their armies and to make up for losses in\r\nthe field. On the other hand, the dominant school in England expect to\r\nsend an expedition from England, in combination with Turkey or some\r\nother allied Power, to attack Russia in other quarters.\" Dilke was led\r\naccordingly to the general conclusion that the one thing needful was\r\n\"that we should try to remove the consideration of these subjects from\r\nthe home or the Indian or the Canadian point of view, and should take a\r\ngeneral view of the possibilities of Imperial defence.\"\r\n\r\nThe attempt to take this imperial view was made in _Problems of Greater\r\nBritain_, which Dilke wrote during the remainder of the year 1889. In\r\nthis work he discussed the defence of the North-West Frontier of India\r\nas a prelude to the examination of the defence of the British Empire.\r\nHis reason for this separate treatment was that \"only on this one of all\r\nthe frontiers of the Empire the British dominion is virtually\r\nconterminous with the continental possessions of a great military\r\nPower.\" He showed that the serious import of this condition was\r\nunderstood by all who knew India well and by both the political parties\r\nin England. He dissented from the view that security could be obtained\r\nby an agreement with Russia, because it was not easy to see \"how Russia\r\ncould put it out of her own power at any moment to threaten us on the\r\nNorth-West Frontier.\" The suggestion that Russia should be allowed to\r\noccupy the northern portion of Afghanistan he rejected, first because it\r\nwould have been a flagrant breach of faith with the Amir, and secondly\r\nbecause it would give to Russia territory which she could quickly\r\ntransform into a base of operations against India.\r\n\r\nHe thought that Russia could not invade India with a good chance of\r\nsuccess if she started from her present frontier, but that if she were\r\nallowed to occupy the northern portion of Afghanistan the Indian\r\nGovernment would be put to ruinous expense for the defensive\r\npreparations which would then be required. [Footnote: 'Lord Dufferin\r\nwrote to me from the Embassy at Rome to express his satisfaction with\r\nthe Indian portion of my book, and especially those passages in which I\r\ndemonstrated the exceeding folly of which we should be guilty if ever we\r\nconsented to a partition of Afghanistan with Russia.'] He noted that the\r\npolicy of advance upon our left, which he had recommended in 1868, had\r\nbeen adopted with success, chiefly by the efficacy of the Sandeman\r\nsystem of recognizing and supporting the tribal chiefs and requiring\r\nthem to maintain order, and also by the occupation and fortification of\r\nthe position of Quetta and by the opening of roads from Quetta through\r\nthe Gomul and other passes to the Indus at Dera Ismail Khan and Dera\r\nGhazi Khan. This would enable an Indian army to attack the right flank\r\nof any Russian force attempting to advance along the Khyber line, which\r\nwould be resisted in the Khyber hills and at Attock, and be stopped at\r\nthe fortress of Rawal Pindi. Generally speaking, he held that Indian\r\n\"defence must be by the offensive with the field army, and the less we\r\nhave to do with fortifications, the better.\" He urged the extension\r\nnorthwards of the Sandeman system to all the independent tribes between\r\nthe Indian and the Afghan borders. If the separate armies for the\r\nPresidencies were to be united under a single Commander-in-Chief, as the\r\nIndian Government had long desired, and if the principle of enlisting in\r\nthe native army only men of fighting races were fully adopted, and the\r\nnative Princes induced to place effective contingents at the disposal of\r\nthe Government, he thought that India with reinforcements from home\r\nwould be well able to resist a Russian attack starting from the frontier\r\nthat Russia then possessed.\r\n\r\nBut if Russia should once be established at Herat, with railway\r\ncommunications to that point, there would be hardly any limit to the\r\nforce with which it would become necessary to resist her. He therefore\r\nurged that the Russian Government should be given to understand that any\r\nadvance of her forces into Afghanistan would be regarded by England as a\r\nhostile act. At the same time he admitted that it was difficult to see\r\nhow Russia was in that event to be fought. He still thought that she\r\nwould be vulnerable at Vladivostock--at any rate until her railway to\r\nthe Pacific should be completed [Footnote: He considered that, with a\r\nview to any future struggle with Russia, the abandonment of Port\r\nHamilton in 1886 by Lord Salisbury had been unfortunate. See, as to Port\r\nHamilton, _Life of Granville_, ii. 440; _Europe and the Far East_, by\r\nSir Robert Douglas, pp. 190, 248]--but he was aware that this view was\r\nshared neither by the Indian nor the British officers likely to be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on Indian Defence Dilke had exhausted the subject from\r\nthe Indian point of view. He was fully acquainted with the ideas of all\r\nthose who had been seriously concerned with the problem, of which he had\r\ndiscussed every aspect with them, and his exposition was complete. When\r\nin his last chapter he came to \"examine the conditions of the defence of\r\nthe Empire as a whole, and to try to find some general principle for our\r\nguidance,\" he was to a great extent breaking new ground. The subject had\r\nbeen treated in 1888 by Colonel Maurice, afterwards General Sir\r\nFrederick Maurice, in his essay on the Balance of Military Power in\r\nEurope, but Maurice based his scheme on the assumption of a Continental\r\nalliance which Dilke thought impracticable. It had also been treated\r\nwith great insight as early as 1880 by Sir John Colomb in his _Defence\r\nof Great and Greater Britain_. His brother Admiral Philip Colomb had\r\nmore recently expounded the view that the right plan was to make the\r\nenemy's coasts our frontier, and to blockade the whole of his ports, so\r\nthat it would be impossible for his fleets to issue forth. This seemed\r\nto Dilke to imply a superiority of naval force which England did not\r\npossess, and was not then intending to create. But Sir John Colomb in\r\n1880 had admitted the absolute necessity of being prepared to render\r\ninvasion impossible by purely military forces. \"It was necessary,\" he\r\nhad said, \"that invasion be efficiently guarded against, so that, should\r\nour home fleet be temporarily disabled, we may, under cover of our army,\r\nprepare and strengthen it to regain lost ground and renew the struggle\r\nfor that which is essential to our life as a nation and our existence as\r\nan Empire.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke thought this sound sense, and that it was rash, in\r\nview of the inadequate strength of the actual navy and of the\r\nuncertainty as to the effect of new inventions on naval warfare, to\r\ncount upon beginning a future war with a repetition of Trafalgar. He\r\nadmitted that the navy, if concentrated in home waters, would be fully\r\nable to defend the United Kingdom, but that the fleets if so\r\nconcentrated must abandon the remainder of the Empire, and that this\r\nwould involve the destruction of our commerce and would be as severe a\r\nblow to the Empire as the invasion of England. He inferred that the navy\r\nmust be the chief agent in defence, but backed by fortification and by\r\nland forces. There ought to be squadrons in distant seas strong enough\r\nto hold their own, without reinforcements, against probable enemies on\r\nthe same stations. The coaling ports must be suitably fortified and have\r\nall the troops necessary for their garrisons on the spot in time of\r\npeace. [Footnote: Autumn of 1889: 'Among those with whom I corresponded\r\nabout my book was Lord Charles Beresford, who gave me a great deal of\r\ninformation about coaling-stations for my chapter on Imperial Defence,\r\nin which I also had Charles Brackenbury's help to a considerable\r\nextent.'] He carefully considered the question of food-supply at home\r\nand the possibility of a commercial blockade of the United Kingdom. He\r\ndid not think that such a blockade could be established or maintained.\r\n\"Our manufactures would be seriously assailed, our food-supply would\r\nbecome precarious, but we should not be brought to the point of\r\nsurrender by absolute starvation, and the possibility of invasion is not\r\nexcluded, as some of the naval school pretend, by the fact that it would\r\nbe unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand, a defeat or a temporary absence of the fleet\r\n    might lead to bombardments, attacks upon arsenals, and even to\r\n    invasion, if our mobile land forces, our fortifications and their\r\n    garrisons, were not such as to render attacks of any kind too\r\n    dangerous to be worth attempting. In the absence of the fleet a\r\n    landing could not be prevented. But the troops landed ought to be\r\n    attacked. For this purpose we do not need an immense number of\r\n    ill-trained, badly-equipped, and unorganized troops, but an army\r\n    completely ready to take the field and fight in the open, supplied\r\n    with a well-trained field artillery.\"\r\n\r\nBut the mere protection of Great and Greater Britain was not enough. \"It\r\nis idle to suppose that war could be brought to a termination unless we\r\nare prepared in some way to obtain advantages over the enemy such as to\r\ncause him to weary of the struggle. The _riposte_ is as necessary in\r\nwarfare as in fencing, and defence must include the possibility of\r\ncounter-attack.\" \"In view of almost any conceivable hostilities, we\r\nought to be prepared to supply arms and officers to native levies which\r\nwould support our Empire in various portions of the globe.\" But we had\r\ntoo few officers for our own troops at home, in India, and in the\r\nauxiliary forces. The stocks of arms ought to be larger than they were,\r\nand there ought to be centres of production for them in various parts of\r\nthe Empire. \"The moneys that the British Empire spends upon defence are\r\nimmensely great, and what is wanted is that those moneys should be spent\r\nas is decided by the best advisers who can be obtained.\" \"The main thing\r\nneeded for a joint organization of the whole of the defensive forces of\r\nthe Empire is the creation of a body of men whose duty it would be to\r\nconsider the questions raised, and to work out the answers.\" For this\r\npurpose he thought the one thing needful was a General Staff, an\r\ninstitution of which he gave a brief account, based on Mr. Spenser\r\nWilkinson's essay _The Brain of an Army_, of which the author had sent\r\nhim the proofs. \"A General Staff,\" Dilke wrote, \"would neither inspect\r\ntroops nor regulate the promotion of the army, but it would decide the\r\nprinciples which would arrange the distribution of the Imperial\r\nforces.... The very existence of a General Staff would constitute a form\r\nof Imperial military federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1890, Dilke read before the Statistical Society a paper on\r\nthe Defence Expenditure of the Chief Military and Naval Powers. He had\r\ntaken great pains to ascertain what each Power spent on its army and\r\nnavy, and what return it obtained for its money. The net result was\r\nthat, while France and Germany for an expenditure of about 28 millions\r\nsterling could each of them put into the field a mobile force of two\r\nmillion men, the British Empire, at a cost of 35-1/2 millions, had \"a\r\nnominal force of 850,000 of various degrees of training wholly\r\nunorganized, and supplied only with the professional artillery needed\r\nfor a force of about 150,000 men.\" The British navy was more formidable\r\nthan the French, and \"the German navy does not as yet exist. I say 'as\r\nyet,' for the Germans mean business with their navy, and have begun, in\r\na businesslike manner, at the top, putting at the head of it their best\r\nadministrators.\" The French were spending altogether on defence a total\r\nof 36 to 36-1/2 millions, the Germans 38, and the British Empire 57\r\nmillions. The moral was that, \"whatever the peace expenditure, war\r\ncannot be commenced with a fair chance of winning by a nation which\r\nwaits until war to make her organization perfect. Germany before 1870\r\nprepared in time of peace her corps, her armies, and provided them all\r\nwith officers for the various commands, who knew what their duties would\r\nbe in war. All countries spending much on their armies now do the same,\r\nexcept the United Kingdom, which stands alone in having still\r\npractically little but a regimental system in existence. But although we\r\nare old-fashioned, to the point of being utterly unprepared (except in\r\nIndia) for the stress of war, we nevertheless spend sums so vast as to\r\nstagger and amaze even the French and German critics, who ought to be\r\npretty well used, one would think, to large sums for military\r\nexpenditure.\" [Footnote: Sir Charles notes in 1893: 'Sir William\r\nHarcourt on the British Army: \"One knows a man who has ten thousand a\r\nyear, sixteen horses, and ten carriages, and yet if one guest comes he\r\nhas difficulty to find a dogcart to meet him, and if two come a fly has\r\nto be hired. The British nation also spends its money freely, and has\r\nequal difficulty in meeting the slightest emergency.\"']\r\n\r\nEarly in 1891 Dilke proposed to Spenser Wilkinson that they should join\r\nin writing a new popular book on Imperial Defence. During that year the\r\ntwo men kept up a constant correspondence, and Wilkinson was frequently\r\nDilke's guest in London, at Dockett and Pyrford, and in the Forest of\r\nDean. At Whitsuntide Dilke stayed at Aldershot (where Wilkinson was in\r\ncamp with his old volunteer battalion, the 2nd Manchester), and went\r\nevery day to see the regiment at work.\r\n\r\nIn September, on the eve of Dilke's starting for the French manoeuvres,\r\nWilkinson sent him the draft of an introduction to the proposed book. It\r\nchallenged the widely-held opinion that war is wicked in itself, and\r\nmight by political arrangement be rendered unnecessary, and deprecated\r\nthe abstention from inquiry into its methods which this opinion\r\nencouraged. It challenged the maxim 'No foreign policy,' which meant\r\neither having no relations with other countries, or, having such\r\nrelations, conducting them without system. War should be conceived of as\r\nimposed upon States by an irreconcilable opposition of purposes, and was\r\nalways a means to an end. Peace could not be secured by a policy which\r\nadopts it as a supreme end. The confusion between defence as a political\r\nattitude and defence as an operation of war had led to the neglect, by\r\nEnglish public opinion, of all naval and military preparations that\r\nmight be available for attack. But the essential elements of defensive\r\nstrength, fleets and armies, were mobile and equally available for\r\noffensive operations, and no efficient preparation for defence was\r\npossible that would not also serve for attack. Without a clear and true\r\nconception of the character of war as a conflict of national purposes,\r\nproper conduct of military operations and of defensive preparations was\r\nimpossible, and to its absence was due the unorganized condition of the\r\ndefence of the Empire. Dilke, in acknowledging the manuscript, wrote:\r\n\"I've read it all and like it, but shall shorten it a little,\" and in\r\nreturning the manuscript, with his modifications, wrote: \"The\r\nintroduction is most excellent--stately and interesting: I can say this,\r\nas it is almost all yours.\" Wilkinson then sent a chapter entitled \"The\r\nPrimacy of the Navy.\"\r\n\r\n    \"An attack on land conducted across the sea is a most hazardous\r\n    speculation so long as there exists anywhere a hostile fleet that is\r\n    able to fight. In order to make such an attack safe, it is\r\n    indispensable that the attacker should secure himself from all\r\n    interruption by destroying or driving from the sea any hostile\r\n    fleet. The Power which should succeed in doing this would have 'the\r\n    command of the sea' as against its particular enemy.... The\r\n    territories of the Power having command of the sea are virtually\r\n    safe against attack by sea.... The British navy, then, so long as it\r\n    maintains the superiority at sea is a sufficient protection against\r\n    invasion for every part of the Empire except India and Canada. If,\r\n    however, the navy were to suffer decisive defeat, if it were driven\r\n    to seek the shelter of its fortified harbours and kept there, or if\r\n    it were destroyed--then, not only would every part of the Empire be\r\n    open to invasion, but the communication between the several parts\r\n    would be cut, and no mutual succour would be possible.\r\n\r\n    \"The defeat of the British fleet or fleets would, of course, be\r\n    effected by purely naval operations; but the acquiescence in its\r\n    destruction could, perhaps, only be secured by a blow affecting the\r\n    British power at its source, and therefore the establishment by an\r\n    enemy of his naval superiority would almost certainly be followed by\r\n    an invasion of Great Britain. So long, then, as the British navy can\r\n    be maintained invincible, the Empire could be adequately defended\r\n    against attack of any European Power other than Russia, and for such\r\n    a defence, therefore, no more is needed than complete naval\r\n    preparation, and such military preparation as is required for the\r\n    full efficiency of the navy. Any additional military preparation is,\r\n    as against attack of this nature, merely an insurance to cover the\r\n    possibility of the failure of the navy. After such failure, it might\r\n    save the British Islands, but it could not save the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nDilke wrote that this doctrine was the opposite of what he had\r\npreviously held and preached, and expressed a doubt whether, that being\r\nthe case, the book could go on as a joint work. Wilkinson replied that\r\nthe first question was whether the doctrine of the chapter was sound,\r\nand that the question of the names on the title-page could wait till the\r\nwork was done.\r\n\r\nIn _Problems of Greater Britain_ Dilke had discussed the view of Sir\r\nJohn Colomb and of his brother, Admiral Colomb. The Admiral appeared to\r\nrely upon \"blockade,\" which required a navy much stronger than Great\r\nBritain possessed, and might, with modern weapons and the torpedo, be\r\nimpracticable of execution, while Sir John Colomb appeared to admit the\r\nnecessity of purely military forces to prevent invasion. Dilke, looking\r\nat the extent of the Empire to be defended, had thought that the\r\nconcentration of the navy in home waters must involve the abandonment of\r\nthe rest of the Empire. This is the view usually held by those who are\r\nthinking of what they have to protect. Wilkinson thought first of the\r\nenemy's forces and how to destroy them. If they can be destroyed, the\r\nenemy is helpless and the territories of the victor are safe, because\r\nthe enemy has no force with which to molest them. On the appearance of\r\n_Problems_, Dilke, as the extracts from his Diary at that time show, had\r\nbegun to doubt whether this view was not the right one; Wilkinson's\r\nexposition and the discussion which accompanied it completed his\r\nconversion. This was the turning-point of his studies of Imperial\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter was headed \"The Command of the Sea.\" Here the debated\r\ndoctrine was applied.\r\n\r\n    \"The purpose of Great Britain to render her territories secure would\r\n    be perfectly accomplished by the destruction of the enemy's navy, as\r\n    this would render any attempt at the transport of troops\r\n    impracticable. The destruction of the enemy's navy would, of course,\r\n    also be the best possible protection for England's sea-borne trade\r\n    (though, no doubt, for this purpose additional measures would be\r\n    required), and for her communications with every part of her Empire.\r\n    Thus, in every possible war in which Great Britain could engage, the\r\n    prime function of the British navy is to attack, and if possible to\r\n    destroy, the organized naval forces of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose the enemy sought battle, the question would soon be decided, but\r\nif he wished to avoid it the difficulty would be to find him and to\r\ncompel him to accept it. For this purpose the best plan was that adopted\r\nin 1803 by Lord St. Vincent, which consisted in placing at the outset,\r\nin front of every one of the enemy's military ports, a British squadron\r\nsuperior to that which the enemy had within it. This was incorrectly\r\ntermed \"blockade,\" as the object was not to prevent the issue of the\r\nFrench fleets from their ports, but to prevent their exit unwatched and\r\nto fight them when they should come out. This plan must be supplemented\r\nby a reserve fleet, and by numerous cruisers to hunt such of the enemy's\r\ncruisers as might be at large. The alternative plan of Lord Howe, of\r\nconcentrating the fleet at one of the home ports, was also discussed,\r\nbut considered less advantageous, as it left the enemy's fleet free to\r\nproceed to sea. But it was shown that the navy of 1891 was twenty\r\nbattleships short of the number believed by naval officers to be\r\nrequired for the successful adoption of St. Vincent's plan against the\r\nFrench navy alone.\r\n\r\nThe defence of India was treated in two chapters entitled \"The Peace of\r\nIndia\" and \"The North-West Frontier,\" which were in substance a\r\nrestatement of the view expressed in _Problems of Greater Britain_.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on \"The Armies\" was a translation into specific shape, with\r\nfull details and calculations, of Dilke's idea of a separation between\r\nthe British and Indian systems. It was argued that the militia and\r\nvolunteers should be organized into army corps with permanent fully paid\r\ncommanders and the necessary auxiliary troops, and it was pointed out\r\nthat the volunteer department of the War Office ought to be entrusted to\r\nvolunteer officers. A chapter on \"The Management of the Home Army\"\r\nasserted that \"Any system proposed for the better management of the army\r\nmust satisfy three distinct conditions: It must be framed with a view to\r\nthe preparation of the army for war; it must secure unimpaired the\r\nauthority of the Cabinet; and it must provide for an efficient control\r\nover expenditure by the House of Commons.\" The first requirement of a\r\nsound system was a general who could be entrusted with the duty of\r\nadvising the Cabinet upon the conduct of war and with the actual\r\nmanagement of campaigns. He ought to have a proper general staff and the\r\nfield troops at home should be organized into localized autonomous army\r\ncorps. \"The British army at home has no generals, and can have none\r\nuntil its battalions are settled and grouped into brigades, divisions,\r\nand army corps.\" There must be a second general charged with all\r\nbranches of supply.\r\n\r\nAny satisfactory Admiralty system, it was pointed out, would provide a\r\ncompetent naval adviser for the Cabinet. But it was doubted \"whether it\r\nwill be possible to secure unity of design in defence so long as the War\r\nOffice and the Admiralty are separately represented in the Cabinet. The\r\ndifficulty would be overcome if it became the practice for one Minister\r\nto hold both offices.\" Dilke had long had the common-sense idea that a\r\nsingle Minister ought to have general charge of all the preparations for\r\nwar and its conduct by sea and land.\r\n\r\nHe had made excisions and additions in the chapters as they had reached\r\nhim, and had closely scrutinized the expression throughout. The whole\r\nbook was read through by the two men together, and each point discussed\r\nto complete agreement. Dilke then proposed that it should appear in\r\nWilkinson's name, as it was substantially Wilkinson's work, and that he\r\nhimself might write a preface. Wilkinison said that it was a joint work,\r\nthat the idea of the book was Dilke's, that its substance was the\r\noutcome of the intimate exchange of views between them, and that it\r\nought to bear both their names. In his diary Dilke wrote: \"Wilkinson's\r\npart in it was far greater than mine, though we argued out the whole.\"\r\nWhen the book appeared, Admiral Colomb wrote to Dilke: \"On reading the\r\nintroduction and the first and second chapters, I am inclined to sing\r\n'Nunc dimittis,' for, as far as I can understand the matter, you put\r\nforward all the views for which I have contended; and coming thus from\r\nyour hands, I think they will henceforth be current views.\" Dilke sent\r\nthe letter to Wilkinson, noting on it: \"Colomb thinks _he_ has converted\r\nme. I reply, _he couldn't_. You did--after he had failed.\" He regarded\r\nhis collaboration with Wilkinson as an intellectual partnership in\r\nregard to defence, and hardly ever spoke or wrote on the subject without\r\nreferring to it.\r\n\r\nThe development of Sir Charles Dilke's thoughts on defence has now been\r\nfully traced and his method of work revealed. His mind was unreservedly\r\nopen to take in the thoughts of others, and he was incessantly trying to\r\nknow the best that was thought and said concerning the subjects that\r\ninterested him. He assimilated the substance of a vast correspondence,\r\nand on every topic the ideas which he received became a part of him. His\r\nintellectual life was thus an incessant dialectic with the best minds of\r\nhis time. But he never accepted ideas from others without the most\r\ngenerous acknowledgment, and did not, as so many men do, proceed, after\r\nassimilating another man's thought, to imagine that it was his own\r\ninvention. This intellectual candour, involving a rare modesty and\r\nabsence of affectation, was one of his finest characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, when Sir Charles Dilke returned to the House of Commons as\r\nmember for the Forest of Dean, his mind was made up in regard to the\r\nsubject of national defence, and from that time on he worked in and out\r\nof Parliament to bring about an organization for war of the resources of\r\nthe nation and of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAt that time the management of both services was hampered by the\r\naccumulated changes made by three generations of statesmen intent upon\r\nhome affairs, under which were buried and hidden the traditions of an\r\nearlier period of wars. In 1857 the Duke of Cambridge had been appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief in deference to the belief of the Prince Consort,\r\ninspired by Baron Stockmar, that in order to avert revolution the royal\r\nauthority over the army must be exercised through a Prince, and not\r\nthrough the channel of a Minister responsible to Parliament. The Duke\r\nthought it his mission to resist changes, and his obstruction had been\r\nthe bane of successive Ministers. Accordingly, the statesmen of Cabinet\r\nrank and experience were anxious at all cost to establish the supremacy\r\nof the Cabinet over the army, and for this purpose had welcomed the\r\nproposal of the Hartington Commission to abolish the office of\r\nCommander-in-Chief whenever the Duke of Cambridge should cease to hold\r\nthat post. The Commission had not considered that a change of persons\r\nmight solve the difficulty, and was led astray by the proposal to\r\nappoint \"a Chief of the Staff,\" who was to be, not the strategical\r\nadviser of the head of the army, but rather its administrator in chief.\r\nIn every modern army there is a Chief of the General Staff to assist the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, the principal executive officer, as well as an\r\nAdministrator-General to manage the business of supply. The Hartington\r\nCommission proposed to give the name \"Chief of the Staff\" to an\r\nAdministrator-General. It further proposed the creation of a Committee\r\nof the Cabinet to hold the balance between the requirements of the War\r\nOffice and those of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nDilke recognized as fully as the occupants of either front bench the\r\nnecessity for the paramount authority of the Cabinet. He also felt the\r\nneed for co-ordination between the War Office and the Admiralty, and\r\nconsidered that both these needs would best be met by a single Minister,\r\nthe Prime Minister, supervising or taking charge of both offices. The\r\nessence of co-ordination would consist in framing the arrangements for\r\nboth services with a single eye to victory in war.\r\n\r\nDilke's first step was to get into touch with those members of\r\nParliament who were most keenly interested in the army and navy.\r\n\r\n    'On February 21st (1893) I had a meeting, which I had suggested,\r\n    with Lord Wolmer, General Sir George Chesney, and H. O.\r\n    Arnold-Forster, and agreed on joint action in all service matters,\r\n    and to attend the meeting of the service members fixed for the next\r\n    day, to which, although civilians, Arnold-Forster and I were asked.\r\n    We wrote Wolmer's motion for him.'\r\n\r\nAt this time Campbell-Bannerman was Secretary of State for War. On March\r\n9th the House was to go into Committee of Supply, and on the motion\r\n\"that Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair\" Lord Wolmer moved \"that in the\r\nopinion of this House the present system of military administration\r\nfails to secure either due economy in time of peace or efficiency for\r\nnational defence.\" Lord Wolmer in his speech referred to the breakdown\r\nin the system of recruiting which had been disclosed in the report of\r\nLord Wantage's Committee. He was supported by Sir George Chesney, who\r\nreferred to the report of Sir James Stephen's Commission as \"a scathing\r\nexposure of mismanagement,\" and to that of the Hartington Commission as\r\n\"an unqualified and alarming denunciation of our military system.\"\r\nArnold-Forster also supported the resolution, in favour of which Dilke\r\nmade a short and incisive speech. Campbell-Bannerman declined to take\r\nthe discussion seriously. \"The first observation,\" he said, \"that must\r\noccur to anyone reading the motion is, What in the world has the report\r\nof Lord Wantage's Committee to do with the present system of military\r\nadministration? It is as if the noble lord were to call attention to the\r\nTenterden Steeple, and to move that the Goodwin Sands are a danger to\r\nnavigation.\" But the breakdown of recruiting was the crucial evidence of\r\nthe weakness of the military administration.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1893, the question of the then recent appointment of the\r\nDuke of Connaught to the command at Aldershot was raised in the House of\r\nCommons by Mr. Dalziel. It was defended by Campbell-Bannerman on the\r\nground that the Duke possessed sufficient qualifications for the post.\r\nIf that had been the sole question, said Dilke, he should have supported\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n    \"But there was another point. Aldershot was a training-school not\r\n    only for the men and regimental officers there employed, but also\r\n    for the Generals commanding. It might be said to be the only school\r\n    in the United Kingdom where a general officer could obtain\r\n    experience in commanding men in battle, and therefore only officers\r\n    who were likely to command armies in case of serious war ought to be\r\n    put in command of such a place. Was it likely that the Duke of\r\n    Connaught, under the circumstances, would be called upon to take the\r\n    chief command against a European enemy in case of war?\"\r\n\r\nIn the division Dilke voted against the appointment.\r\n\r\nOn December 19th Lord George Hamilton moved a resolution \"that a\r\nconsiderable addition should at once be made to the navy.\" Mr. Gladstone\r\nregarded this proposal as a vote of censure on the Government, and\r\ndelivered an indignant reply. Dilke deprecated making the navy a subject\r\nof party controversy, and made an appeal to his Liberal friends:\r\n\r\n    \"All naval experts who have been consulted on the question have\r\n    always laid it down that, for safety, you must have a supremacy of\r\n    five to three in battleships, that you require that supremacy for\r\n    the policy of blockade.... If ever we engage in war ... it is a\r\n    necessity of the position of this country that our frontiers should\r\n    be at the enemy's ports.... I know this is not a popular policy, but\r\n    the existence of the Empire depends upon it.... Liberals should give\r\n    up thinking of this question of national defence as a hateful one,\r\n    and as one against which they ought to close their eyes and ears. I\r\n    know that, in these days of great armaments on the Continent, the\r\n    old tradition of the Liberal party, that they should look to the\r\n    possibility of using the forces of this country on behalf of\r\n    Continental freedom, has become a dream of the past. They must\r\n    remember that our liberties at home depend upon the efficiency of\r\n    our fleet, and that, beyond this, the very existence of our Empire\r\n    is concerned in the question which the House is at this moment\r\n    debating.\"\r\n\r\nThe sequel to this debate was Mr. Gladstone's retirement in February,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nEarly in the autumn of 1893 Dilke had talked over with Spenser Wilkinson\r\nthe line to be taken in Parliament by the service members. Wilkinson had\r\nurged as a preliminary some effort to obtain agreement among the\r\n\"experts,\" suggesting that Chesney as the ablest of them all should\r\nfirst be approached. On November 8th Chesney and Wilkinson dined at\r\nSloane Street, and, Chesney having expressed his general concurrence in\r\nthe views as to administration explained in _Imperial Defence_, Dilke\r\nproposed that Wilkinson should draft a letter to the Prime Minister,\r\nembodying the main points, to be signed by all three and by Arnold-\r\nForster, if he should be in accord with them, and to be sent not only to\r\nMr. Gladstone, but to the leaders of the Opposition. The result was the\r\nfollowing letter, which was eventually signed and sent on February 12th,\r\n1894, to Mr. Gladstone (then Prime Minister), to Lord Salisbury, the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, Mr. Balfour, and Mr. Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n    Sir,\r\n\r\n    The late debate in the House of Commons on the subject of the navy\r\n    was one of many symptoms of a widespread uneasiness with regard to\r\n    the defences of the Empire. There is a doubt of the sufficiency of\r\n    the naval establishments and of the efficiency in some respects of\r\n    the systems under which the navy and the army are administered. This\r\n    failure of confidence has been of gradual growth. Those who think it\r\n    justified do not attribute the responsibility for it to any one\r\n    administration or to either party in the State. Yet it seems\r\n    difficult to discuss these doubts in Parliament without, at least,\r\n    the appearance of censure upon the Government of the day, a result\r\n    which is unfortunate, for the subject should unite rather than\r\n    divide parties, and upon its paramount importance there is no\r\n    difference of opinion.\r\n\r\n    For this reason a service may perhaps be rendered by the\r\n    communication to the Prime Minister and to the leaders of the\r\n    Opposition of suggestions which commend themselves to men of\r\n    different parties who have from different points of view for many\r\n    years given attention to questions relating to national defence.\r\n\r\n    No arrangements which aimed at or resulted in a subversion of the\r\n    principles which experience has shown to be essential to the working\r\n    of constitutional government could be seriously considered. But no\r\n    system of defence, however constitutional, can avail unless it be\r\n    shaped with a view to war. It is to the conciliation of these two\r\n    necessities, that of compatibility with the constitution and that of\r\n    adaptation to the purpose of war, that our attention has been\r\n    directed.\r\n\r\n    If the preservation of peace depended upon the goodwill of the\r\n    British Government, there would perhaps be little need for a navy or\r\n    an army. The existence of these services implies that this is not\r\n    the case, and that safety in time of war depends upon forethought\r\n    and preparation in advance. Such preparation involves a view of the\r\n    nature of a possible war and an estimate of the intensity of the\r\n    effort it would impose, this view and this estimate furnishing the\r\n    standard for the quantity and quality of the means to be kept\r\n    available.\r\n\r\n    The design, without which even a defensive war cannot be carried on,\r\n    and in the absence of which preparations made during peace must fail\r\n    to serve their purpose, is properly the secret of the Government.\r\n    Yet, where the Government is responsible to a Parliament, it is\r\n    indispensable either that so much of the design should be\r\n    communicated to Parliament as will enable it to judge of the\r\n    necessity and of the sufficiency of the preparations for which\r\n    supplies must be voted, or that Parliament should know who are the\r\n    professional advisers upon whose judgment the Government relies.\r\n    Neither of these conditions seems to us at present to be fulfilled,\r\n    and as a consequence of the omission there has arisen in the public\r\n    mind that distrust to which we have alluded.\r\n\r\n    The leading decision in the administration of the national defence,\r\n    governing the whole course and character of any future war, is that\r\n    which settles the total amount of expenditure upon preparation and\r\n    apportions it between the naval and military services. For this\r\n    decision the Cabinet is, and must ever be, responsible. Yet in the\r\n    distribution of the business of the Cabinet into departments there\r\n    appears to be no office specially entrusted with the consideration\r\n    of war as a whole, embracing the functions both of the navy and of\r\n    the army. Of the sums usually devoted each year to warlike\r\n    preparations, the larger part is spent upon the army, and only a\r\n    lesser part upon the navy, upon which the maintenance of the Empire\r\n    and the security of Great Britain must ever chiefly depend. It is\r\n    difficult to believe that this apportionment is the result of\r\n    deliberate examination of the requirements of war. It would seem\r\n    more probable that the separate existence of a department of the\r\n    navy and a department of the army leads in practice to the\r\n    management of each for its own sake rather than as an instrument\r\n    serving a more general purpose.\r\n\r\n    In order to secure the special consideration by the Cabinet of\r\n    national defence as distinct from and superior to the administration\r\n    either of the navy or of the army, we would suggest the appointment\r\n    of one and the same Minister to the two offices of Secretary of\r\n    State for War and First Lord of the Admiralty, or the amalgamation,\r\n    with the consent of Parliament, of these two offices.\r\n\r\n    We would further suggest that the Cabinet should select for each\r\n    service an officer whose professional judgment commands its\r\n    confidence, to be at once the responsible adviser of the Cabinet\r\n    upon all questions regarding the conduct of war so far as his own\r\n    service is concerned, and the principal executive officer of that\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n    We understand by a responsible adviser one who stands or falls by\r\n    the advice which he gives. He would, of course, have at his\r\n    disposal, in the formation of his views, the best assistance which\r\n    the professional staff of the navy or of the army could supply. But\r\n    the opinion which, after mature consideration, he would submit to\r\n    the Cabinet, and formally record, would be his own and would be\r\n    given in his own name. It follows that a difference of opinion\r\n    between the Cabinet and its naval or its military adviser upon any\r\n    important matter of naval or military policy would lead to the\r\n    resignation of the latter. In our view, the essence of\r\n    responsibility for advice is that the officer giving it is\r\n    identified with it, and remains in the post only so long as his\r\n    judgment upon the professional matters with reference to which he is\r\n    consulted is acceptable to the Cabinet which he serves. In order to\r\n    facilitate his independence in this respect, provision should be\r\n    made, in case of his resignation, for his employment in another post\r\n    or for his honourable retirement.\r\n\r\n    If these suggestions were adopted, the passage in case of need from\r\n    peace to war would take place without personal or administrative\r\n    change. The adaptation of the whole service, whether naval or\r\n    military, to the necessities of war, as understood by a competent\r\n    officer studying them with full responsibility, would be assured.\r\n    The House of Commons and the public would have in the person of the\r\n    naval and of the military adviser a guarantee of the sufficiency and\r\n    of the efficiency of the navy and of the army. The authority of the\r\n    Cabinet and the control of the House of Commons would be unimpaired.\r\n\r\n    We are, sir,\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n    Charles W. Dilke.\r\n\r\n    George Chesney.\r\n\r\n    H. O. Arnold-Foster.\r\n\r\n    Spenser Wilkenson.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1893, Dilke had communicated to Mr. Balfour the draft of\r\nthis letter and his plan for sending it to the leaders of both parties.\r\nMr. Balfour thought the best plan for co-ordinating the two services\r\nwould be by a Defence Committee of the Cabinet, of which Dilke put his\r\nfinger on the weak point, that it gave no guarantee of meeting the\r\nrequirements of war. [Footnote: The letters printed in Appendix I., p.\r\n451, embody the substance of previous conversations between Dilke and\r\nMr. Balfour. In Appendix II., p. 456, are given the replies of Mr.\r\nGladstone and the other leaders to the joint letter, which was\r\nafterwards published in the newspapers.--Ed.] It was after these\r\ncommunications that Mr. Balfour made his speech at Manchester on January\r\n22nd, 1894, in which he said:\r\n\r\n    \"It is responsibility which is chiefly lacking in our present\r\n    system. If anything goes wrong with the navy, you attack the First\r\n    Lord of the Admiralty. If anything goes wrong in the army, you\r\n    attack the Secretary for War. If anything goes wrong in the Home\r\n    Department, you attack the Secretary to the Home Department. But if\r\n    the general scheme of national and imperial defence is not properly\r\n    managed, there is nobody to attack but the whole Cabinet; and the\r\n    Cabinet as a whole is not, in my opinion, a very good body to carry\r\n    on the detailed work of that, any more than of any other, department\r\n    of the State.\"\r\n\r\nThese private discussions between Dilke and Mr. Balfour foreshadowed the\r\nactual course which reform was to take. It began in 1895 with the\r\nadoption of Mr. Balfour's plan of a Committee of the Cabinet; it ended\r\nin 1904 by Mr. Balfour as Prime Minister adopting Dilke's plan, and\r\nundertaking himself, as chairman of that Committee, the co-ordination of\r\nthe two services. Then and not till then the fundamental principle of\r\nthe primacy of the navy in the defence of the Empire was formally\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe next step of the signatories to the joint letter was action in\r\nParliament. Dilke gave notice that, on the introduction of the Army\r\nEstimates, he would move the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    \"That this House, before voting supplies for the maintenance of\r\n    military establishments in the United Kingdom, seeks an assurance\r\n    from Her Majesty's Government that the estimates for that purpose\r\n    submitted to it are framed upon consideration of possible war by sea\r\n    and land, and upon a consideration of advice tendered in that behalf\r\n    by such officer of either service as is fitted to command in war Her\r\n    Majesty's forces of that service.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate took place on March 16th, 1894. In the course of his speech\r\nDilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"What I want to know, and what the Cabinet in framing the estimates\r\n    ought to know, is this: Are the proposals before the House those\r\n    which alone are capable of securing the safety of the country and of\r\n    the Empire?... I wish to know whether the Government present these\r\n    estimates as representing the least, but still what is sufficient,\r\n    for the needs of the country for the next twelve months, not only\r\n    for the protection of the whole country and the Empire, but for the\r\n    protection of our trade in all parts of the world....\r\n\r\n    \"The Cabinet must obtain the best advice possible. I, for my part,\r\n    should prefer that the advice should be concentrated for each\r\n    service, because I think it is far more responsible advice if it\r\n    comes mainly on the responsibility of a single man as regards the\r\n    army and navy respectively than if you dispersed it among a great\r\n    number of people.... As far as I am concerned, form in this matter\r\n    is immaterial. I have stated what I want to secure, and I will put\r\n    two or three different ways of securing it which would very often\r\n    come to the same thing. What I ventured to suggest at first was that\r\n    the Prime Minister should be brought to take more personal concern\r\n    in the defence of the country than is the case at the present time;\r\n    that he should consider himself mainly responsible for the joint\r\n    consideration of the whole defence proposals; that he should hear\r\n    the Secretary for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and their\r\n    advisers, if he is doubtful, and that they together, more seriously\r\n    than has been the case in the past, should go into the difficulties\r\n    of the problem, and he should then advise with them as to the\r\n    estimates.... There was another suggestion made--that a Defence\r\n    Minister, a Minister who should represent the army and navy, should\r\n    be the person charged specially with the responsibility to this\r\n    House.... But I am not wedded to any particular form. Whether the\r\n    Prime Minister specially undertakes the duty, whether it is\r\n    undertaken by a Defence Minister, or whether the suggestion is\r\n    adopted--which, I believe, is that of the Leader of the Opposition\r\n    (Mr. Balfour)--that a Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which I have\r\n    heard was instituted by the late Government, should be provided with\r\n    a more avowed and distinct position, armed with permanent\r\n    responsible advisers, and equipped with records so as to hand over\r\n    its work to those by whom they might be succeeded in office--all\r\n    these plans would come at the present moment to very much the same\r\n    thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was seconded by Arnold-Forster, and supported in a clear\r\nand relevant speech by Sir George Chesney. In the debate which followed,\r\nMr. Balfour expressed his adherence to the third of the plans described\r\nby Sir Charles Dilke. \"I rather contemplate,\" he said, \"that the Prime\r\nMinister, with or without his colleagues, or a Committee of the Cabinet,\r\nwith or without the Prime Minister, should constitute themselves a body\r\nwith permanent records and confidential advisers.\" Campbell-Bannerman\r\nexpressed general agreement with the object Dilke had in view, and\r\nadded: \"I entertain almost identically the opinion which has been\r\nexpressed by the Leader of the Opposition.\" Having thus obtained the\r\nconcurrence of both parties to one of the plans which, it was thought,\r\nmight fulfil the purpose in view, Dilke withdrew the motion.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 (March 11th) a resolution couched in the precise words of that\r\nof 1894 was moved by Mr. Arnold-Forster on the introduction of the Navy\r\nEstimates. In supporting it Dilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"The sole purpose of all this very large expenditure was to enable\r\n    us to achieve victory at sea, which was essential to our very\r\n    existence as a nation; and what the resolution asked was an\r\n    assurance that the Government had had under its consideration the\r\n    nature of the efforts that would be called for to secure victory and\r\n    the distribution of these efforts between the land and sea forces.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 15th, in the discussion of the Army Estimates, Dilke raised a\r\ndoubt \"whether there was in our system of military administration any\r\nsecurity that those we put into positions of high command, where they\r\nwere able to get military experience, were only those men who were\r\nfitted for such posts and would hold command in time of war.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, 1895, Campbell-Bannerman announced the retirement of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge, and his own intention to\r\nadopt the main lines of the scheme of the Hartington Committee. He would\r\nappoint a Commander-in-Chief with reduced powers who would be the\r\nprincipal military adviser of the Secretary of State, and he, with the\r\nother heads of departments, who would each be directly responsible to\r\nthe Minister, would constitute a deliberative Council, so that the\r\nSecretary of State, when he gave his decisions, would be guided and\r\nsupported by the express opinions of all the experienced officers by\r\nwhom he was surrounded.\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Brodrick, now Lord Midleton, moved to reduce the salary of\r\nthe Secretary of State by way of a vote of censure on the insufficiency\r\nof the supply of cordite ammunition. A brief debate followed in which\r\nCampbell-Bannerman failed to convince the House that the supply was\r\nadequate, and in the division this vote of censure was carried by 132\r\nagainst 125. This division overthrew the Liberal Ministry. Dilke took no\r\npart in the debate, but voted in the majority. For this vote\r\nCampbell-Bannerman never forgave him.\r\n\r\nIn the new Ministry formed by Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister, Mr.\r\nBalfour became First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of\r\nCommons, Lord Lansdowne Secretary of State for War, Mr. Brodrick\r\nUnder-Secretary of State for War, and Mr. Goschen First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty. The first act of the new Government was to remodel the\r\ngeneral arrangements for national and imperial defence. The scheme was\r\ndescribed in general terms by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords on\r\nAugust 26th, and more specifically by Mr. Brodrick in the House of\r\nCommons on August 31st. There was to be a Defence Committee of the\r\nCabinet under the presidency of the Duke of Devonshire. Mr. Brodrick's\r\nwords implied that the creation of this body was due to the action of\r\nSir Charles Dilke, who, in the debate on the Address, had again urged\r\nhis views on this subject.\r\n\r\nOf the army Lord Wolseley was to be the new Commander-in-Chief. But,\r\ninstead of being at the head of the military departments of the War\r\nOffice, he was to have charge only of the intelligence and mobilization\r\ndepartments, and to be the President of an Army Board of which the other\r\nmembers were to be the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, the\r\nDirector of Artillery, and the Inspector-General of Fortifications, each\r\nof whom was to be directly responsible for his own department to the\r\nSecretary of State. \"The main principle of the change,\" said Mr.\r\nBrodrick, \"is the separate responsibility of the military heads of\r\ndepartments to the Secretary of State for their departments, and the\r\nfocussing of military opinion by means of the Army Board presided over\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief.\" When Mr. Brodrick had finished his\r\nstatement, Dilke immediately rose and said that\r\n\r\n    \"he had listened to the statement with something like dismay, for\r\n    some of the changes made had been in his view entirely in the wrong\r\n    direction.... There certainly had not been, during the many years he\r\n    had been in the House, any debate in which the issues presented to\r\n    the House had been so momentous.... To that portion of the\r\n    Government's scheme which involved the position of the Duke of\r\n    Devonshire in relation to Imperial defence he was fully favourable.\r\n    He believed he was the original suggester of the proposal in 1888.\r\n    What had been said by the Undersecretary went to suggest the\r\n    creation of a Committee of the Cabinet only, which had been formed,\r\n    they were told, by the late Government. If so, the matter was\r\n    minimized, and there was less security given to the country than\r\n    they had hoped. The first thing to be secured was that there should\r\n    be the individual responsibility of one great member of the Cabinet\r\n    rather than the collective responsibility of a considerable number.\r\n\r\n    \"In regard to the reorganization of the War Office itself, he viewed\r\n    with dismay the further explanations given to-day by the\r\n    Under-Secretary. What had been the main objection to the past\r\n    management of the army in this country? It had been that\r\n    responsibility had been frittered away among a great number of\r\n    different Boards.... He hoped that the new man chosen to be the head\r\n    of the army would be in practice the real head of the army and the\r\n    real adviser of the Secretary of State. What he feared they were\r\n    doing was to create a copy of the Admiralty in those particular\r\n    points in which the Admiralty itself had been the subject of\r\n    criticism.... The Government, he contended, ought to recommend the\r\n    one man, the Commander-in-Chief, and in the first instance take his\r\n    opinion and regard him as ultimately responsible. Having picked out\r\n    the most competent man, he hoped the Government would put the\r\n    arrangement under that man and not under the civilian Secretary of\r\n    State.... It was a mistake to give the Commander-in-Chief a\r\n    department; he ought to be above the departments, and the\r\n    departments ought to report to him. He had ventured for many years\r\n    to ask in the first place that the Cabinet should consider the whole\r\n    problem of Imperial defence, and in the second place that they\r\n    should pick out the best man and trust him.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to Dilke, Mr. Balfour said:\r\n\r\n    \"If you put the Secretary of State for War in direct communication\r\n    with the Commander-in-Chief alone, I do not see how the Secretary of\r\n    State for War can be anything else than the administrative puppet of\r\n    the great soldier who is at the head of the army. He may come down\r\n    to the House and express the views of that great officer; but if he\r\n    is to take official advice from the Commander-in-Chief alone, it is\r\n    absolutely impossible that the Secretary of State should be really\r\n    responsible, and in this House the Secretary of State will be no\r\n    more than the mouthpiece of the Commander-in-Chief. It seems to me\r\n    that the differences in this branch of the subject between the right\r\n    hon. gentleman (Sir Charles Dilke) and the Government are of a more\r\n    fundamental character than I anticipated.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference was indeed fundamental, for Dilke was thinking about war,\r\nand Mr. Balfour was thinking only of Ministerial responsibility. In case\r\nof a war in which the welfare, possibly the independence, of the nation\r\nwould be at stake, what civilian Secretary of State would wish to be\r\npersonally responsible for victory or defeat, or to be more than the\r\nmouthpiece of a great soldier at the head of the army?\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief had been a military officer whose function was to\r\nco-ordinate the work of the heads of the several military departments.\r\nThe change made in 1895 transferred to the Secretary of State this duty\r\npreviously performed by the Commander-in-Chief. Sir James Stephen's\r\nCommission had reported in 1887 that it was morally and physically\r\nimpossible that any one man should satisfactorily discharge the\r\nfunctions which at that time belonged to the Secretary of State. To them\r\nin 1895 the Government added those of the Commander-in-Chief. The result\r\nwas that in 1899 the Secretary of State failed to fulfil the most\r\nimportant of all his functions, that of maintaining accord between the\r\npolicy of the Cabinet and the military preparations. The Committee of\r\nDefence, which was appointed in 1895, might perhaps have performed this\r\nessential function if it had ever taken a serious view of its work. But\r\nit in doubtful whether it ever did any work at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn the new Parliament, Dilke moved on March 5th, 1896, for a return of\r\nthe number of British seamen available for service in the navy in time\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\"One difficulty,\" he said, \"that had to be faced was that in debates\r\nlike the present they had no real opportunity of engaging in a\r\ncollective review of the whole defensive expenditure of the country on\r\nthe army and navy taken together.... They expected from the Government a\r\npolicy which could be explained to the House--either a policy of\r\nalliances, to which he himself was rootedly opposed; or the policy,\r\nwhich was the only true policy for this country, of keeping up such a\r\nfleet as would make us safe against any probable combination. The point\r\nto which he wished to draw most urgent attention was that the real\r\nreserve of England was disappearing very fast. The British sailor was\r\nbecoming more and more a rare article of luxury. He was used on the\r\nfirst-class liners, and not used elsewhere.... There was another point\r\nof importance. Among these foreigners there were many masters of ships,\r\nand they were taught the pilotage of our rivers. That was a very serious\r\nmatter, and might become a great danger in time of war.\"\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the changes made in 1895 had not produced\r\nimprovement either in the Government's arrangements for national defence\r\nor in the management of the army. In November, 1896, Lord Lansdowne,\r\nSecretary of State for War, and Sir Michael Hicks Beach, Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, made speeches the same evening at Bristol. The Secretary\r\nof State expressed the intention to make a slight increase in the number\r\nof battalions in the army, while the Chancellor declared that he would\r\nconsent to no increase in the Army Estimates until he could feel more\r\nconfidence in the manner in which the money was expended. This\r\ndisagreement between members of the Cabinet led to inquiries, through\r\nwhich Dilke became aware that the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Wolseley,\r\nwished for a larger increase in the number of battalions than the\r\nSecretary of State was willing to propose. The opportunity seemed\r\nsuitable for raising the question whether or not the military measures\r\nproposed by the Government were those suggested by their military\r\nadviser--a fundamental question. Lord Lansdowne having explained in the\r\nHouse of Lords in February, 1897, that his proposal was to add two\r\nbattalions to the Guards and one to the Cameron Highlanders, and that he\r\nhoped in this way to restore the equilibrium between the number of\r\nbattalions at home and the number abroad, Dilke in the House of Commons\r\npointed out (February 8th) that the measure proposed would not establish\r\nthe desired equilibrium, and that the proposal was anonymous. Who, he\r\nasked, were the military authorities on whose advice the Government\r\nrelied? Mr. Brodrick, in reply, said that the proposals of the\r\nGovernment, taken as a whole, had been gratefully accepted by one and\r\nall of the military heads of the War Office, as, in the words of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, \"such a step forward as has not been made for many\r\nyears.\" Thus it became clear that the military heads, including the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, were as ready to be overruled in regard to their\r\nviews as to what was necessary for the army as the civilian Minister was\r\nto overrule them.\r\n\r\nIn the Christmas recess of 1897-98 Dilke prepared for the next Session\r\nby writing a pamphlet on Army Reform in which he reviewed the position.\r\nHe and the other reformers had steadily asserted that the home army\r\ncould not take the field until it had drawn heavily on the reserve; that\r\nit was terribly short of artillery; that the seven to eight years'\r\nenlistment was a hybrid, and that the sound course was to have a\r\nshort-term service with the colours at home followed by a choice between\r\na long term in the reserve and a long term in the Indian or Colonial\r\narmy; and, lastly, that the administration was over-centralized at the\r\nWar Office, to the detriment of the authority, the efficiency, and the\r\ncharacter, of the generals. The critics had further urged that the\r\nlinked-battalion system and the hybrid term, bad as they were, could not\r\nbe worked at all without a large increase of the number of battalions at\r\nhome. In 1897 the War Office had replied that an increase of three\r\nbattalions would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe new estimates were introduced in the House of Commons on February\r\n25th, 1898, by Mr. Brodrick, who admitted that, in order to put 50,000\r\ninfantry into the field, it would be necessary to call out 28,000\r\nreservists. In order to have artillery enough for a fraction of the army\r\nhe asked for fifteen more batteries. He had to admit that the three\r\nbattalions added in 1897 were not enough, and to ask for six more. The\r\nspeech was an admission of all the contentions of the critics, though it\r\nbegan by abusing them.\r\n\r\nIn the debate Dilke moved: \"That no scheme for the reorganization of the\r\narmy will be satisfactory which involves the sacrifice of one unit to\r\nsecure the efficiency of any other.\" He referred to the admitted\r\nbreakdown of the eight-years and linked-battalion system. Mr. Brodrick,\r\nquoting Lord Wolseley, had reassured the country by telling them that\r\nthey could despatch two army corps abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Two army corps!\" exclaimed Dilke, \"when it is twenty army corps which\r\nthis country pays for!... Out of the men at home, if cavalry and\r\nartillery were provided, twenty corps instead of two corps might be\r\nmade.... In the last three years the cost of the army has been\r\nconsiderably increased, and there has been an increase in numbers voted.\r\nYet there has been a decrease not only in the militia, but also in the\r\nregular army and in the army reserve as well during that period--an\r\nadditional evidence of breakdown.... The territorial system here can\r\nnever be anything more than a sham so long as we have to provide for\r\nIndia and garrison coaling-stations, and so long as the battalions are\r\nconstantly moved about.... We have year by year made our statements with\r\nregard to artillery to the House. Nobody believed a word we said, and it\r\nwas only last year, when three batteries were sent out to the Cape, and\r\ntwenty batteries wrecked in men and horses to provide them, that the War\r\nOffice at last admitted that we had all along been right.... On this\r\noccasion we see some results, in the speech of the right hon. gentleman\r\nto-night, of our action in the past.\"\r\n\r\nThe Navy Estimates were introduced in July. Lord Charles Beresford in\r\nhis argument had pointed out that the cost of the navy bore a much\r\nsmaller proportion to our mercantile marine than that of the navies of\r\nother countries. Dilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"The position of the British Empire is such that, if by the\r\n    mercantile policy of other countries our mercantile marine were\r\n    wholly to disappear, or if it were to disappear as the result of a\r\n    war in which our carrying trade passed, say, to the United States,\r\n    it would be just as necessary as now for us to have a predominant\r\n    fleet.... If the pressure of taxation on the poorer classes, if the\r\n    unrest in this country on the subject, were so great that it was not\r\n    possible to make the sacrifices which I for one think it necessary\r\n    to make, I would sooner give up the whole expenditure on the army\r\n    than give way upon this naval programme.... This matter of the fleet\r\n    is vital to our position in the world. The army is an arguable\r\n    question.\"\r\n\r\nDilke continued steadily to press for a strong navy. In 1899 he once\r\nmore supported Mr. Goschen's proposals, and again urged that, if the\r\ncost of the army and navy should be too great, we must save on the army,\r\nbut not on the navy. His chief criticism of the Admiralty was that \"we\r\nhave got into the vicious position of beginning our building programme\r\neach year at the extreme end of the financial year.\"\r\n\r\nThe keynote of his speech was: \"This Empire is an Empire of the seas,\r\nand the navy is vital to our existence, but our army is not. Our Indian\r\narmy is vital to our possession of India, but India pays the full cost\r\nof it, perhaps rather more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1898-99 the opposition of purposes between the\r\nBritish Government and the Government of the South African Republic was\r\ncausing grave apprehension to public men. The High Commissioner, Sir\r\nAlfred Milner, paid a visit to England, and on his return to the Cape\r\nwas authorized in May, 1899, to meet President Kruger in a Conference at\r\nBloemfontein. On June 7th the failure of the Conference was announced,\r\nand was thought by many to be the equivalent of a diplomatic rupture,\r\nthe prelude to hostilities. No serious military preparations were made\r\nby the British Government, though various measures were suggested by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Lord Wolseley, and by Sir Redvers Buller. It was not\r\nuntil September 10th that 10,000 men were ordered from India to Natal,\r\nand not until October 7th that orders were issued for the calling out of\r\nthe reserve and for the mobilization of an army corps and other troops\r\nfor South Africa. The Boers began hostilities on October 11th, and the\r\noperations were unfavourable to the British until the middle of\r\nFebruary, when Lord Roberts began the advance towards Kimberley.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, 1900, the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, said in\r\nthe House of Lords: \"I do not believe in the perfection of the British\r\nConstitution as an instrument of war ... it is evident that there is\r\nsomething in your machinery that is wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the Army Estimates on February 1st, Dilke, with his\r\nusual courage, raised the question of responsibility, in a speech to\r\nwhich little attention was paid at the time, but which will now, in the\r\nlight of subsequent events, be better appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"The country,\" he said, \"has gone through an awful winter, and under our\r\nconstitutional system there are persons responsible, and we have to\r\nexamine the nature of their responsibility. Some Government speakers,\r\nwho during the recess have addressed the country, have drawn certain\r\ncomparisons between the occurrences in this war and those of the Crimean\r\nWar.... I confess that I believe the present war has been far more\r\ndisgracefully conducted than the Crimean War had been, and that the\r\nmourning is far more applicable to this case. Now, with regard to the\r\nchecks or reverses--that is the accepted phrase--we are really afraid in\r\nthese days to talk about 'disasters.' The First Lord of the Treasury at\r\nManchester distinctly stated there had been 'no disaster.' There has\r\nbeen no single great engagement in which we have met with an absolute\r\ndisaster, but for the first time in our military history there has been\r\na succession of checks or reverses--unredeemed as they have been by a\r\nsingle great military success in the whole course of the war--in many of\r\nwhich we have left prisoners in the enemy's hands. We began with the\r\nabandonment of the entrenched camp at Dundee, and of the great\r\naccumulation of stores that had been made there, of the wounded, and of\r\nthe dying General, and we lost the headquarters of a regiment of cavalry\r\nthat tried a cavalry pursuit. We lost the headquarters of two battalions\r\nat Nicholson's Nek; we lost the headquarters of one battalion and a very\r\nlarge portion of another battalion in the repulse at Stormberg; we lost\r\nthe Colonel, most of the field officers, and the whole of one company of\r\nthe Suffolks, on another occasion. These headquarters of cavalry, and\r\nthe principal portion of the remaining men of five battalions of British\r\ninfantry, are now prisoners at Pretoria--not to speak of what happened\r\nto the Highland Brigade at Magersfontein, or of the loss of the guns in\r\nthe repulse at the Tugela, or of the fact that thirteen of our field\r\nguns, besides a mountain battery, are now in the enemy's hands. The loss\r\nof guns in proportion to our small strength of guns is equivalent to the\r\nloss of some 300 guns by the German army. None of these events\r\nconstitutes what the First Lord of the Treasury calls a disaster.\r\nProbably he is right. But can any member of this House deny that the net\r\nresult of these proceedings has been disastrous to the belief of the\r\nworld in our ability to conduct a war? Therefore, if there has been, as\r\nthe right hon. gentleman says, not one disaster, surely the result of\r\nthe proceedings has been one disastrous to the credit of this country.\r\nThere has been one immense redemption of that disaster, which is that\r\nall the Powers, however hostile, have very frankly acknowledged on these\r\noccasions the heroism of the officers and men. Our military reputation,\r\nwhich undoubtedly never stood lower in the eyes of the world than at the\r\npresent moment, is redeemed in that respect, and the individual courage\r\nof officers and men never stood higher in the estimate of the world than\r\nit does now. It seems to me to be a patriotic duty of those who have in\r\nthe past discussed in this House the question of Cabinet responsibility\r\nfor military preparations to discuss the question now; to see who is\r\nresponsible, whom--I will not say we will hang, but whom we are to hold\r\nblameworthy in the highest degree for what has occurred. I believe that\r\nthe opinion is attributed to the Prime Minister that the British\r\nConstitution is not a fighting machine. I am told that he has thrown\r\ndoubt upon the working of the British Constitution as a Constitution\r\nwhich will allow this country successfully to go to war. That is a very\r\nserious matter. The Constitution of this country has been maintained as\r\na fighting machine by the members of this House who are now responsible\r\nfor the Administration. No one has ever put the doctrine of Cabinet\r\nresponsibility for the preparation for war higher than it has always\r\nbeen put by the present Leader of the House (Mr. Balfour), and anything\r\nmore direct than the conflict on that point, as on many others, between\r\nhis opinion and the opinion of the Prime Minister it is impossible to\r\nconceive.... On Thursday last the right hon. member who preceded me in\r\nthis debate--the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr.\r\nBrodrick)--delivered a speech and said that all that had been done in\r\nthis war had been 'solely dictated by military advice,' and 'military\r\nadvice alone determined all that had been done.' I should like the House\r\nto consider what that statement means. The right hon. gentleman was the\r\nmember who, on three occasions, brought the question of the ammunition\r\nsupplies of this country before the House: it was he who moved the\r\namendment which turned out the Rosebery Administration on the cordite\r\nvote, and he led the discussion on two subsequent occasions on which we\r\ndebated the same question. At the opening of the next Parliament the\r\nwhole question of Ministerial responsibility for war preparation was\r\nthoroughly and exhaustively considered by this House. I confess that I\r\ndid not expect to hear the right hon. gentleman--who on those three\r\noccasions so firmly pressed, to the very extinction of the Government\r\nitself, the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility--as it were sheltering\r\nthe Cabinet behind military advice, advice which he rejected, as also\r\ndid the Leader of the House, with scorn upon that occasion.... I feel it\r\na duty to myself, and to all who hold the same opinion, to press home\r\nthis doctrine of Cabinet responsibility on this occasion. In that debate\r\nthe hon. member who seems likely to follow me in this debate--the\r\npresent Under-Secretary for War (Mr. Wyndham)--took part. He was then a\r\nprivate member and warmly occupied his mind upon this question, and he\r\nused these words: 'If they were overwhelmed by disasters, the Minister\r\nfor War would be held responsible.' Not only he, but the whole Cabinet\r\nare responsible, and the present Leader of the House, in following the\r\nhon. member in that debate, emphasized that fact, and pointed out the\r\nimportance of complete Cabinet responsibility. That doctrine was\r\nemphatically maintained. There are practical reasons why this question\r\nshould be pressed home on this occasion. This is obviously the time to\r\npress it home if ever it should be done, and it seems to me that such\r\npractical reasons are to be found in two considerations. We have been\r\ntold that at the beginning of every war it is always fated that there\r\nshould be muddling. We have been told it from both sides of the House,\r\nthat we always begin by muddling our wars. If there is one fact more\r\ncertain than another, it is that in future wars, not with Boer\r\nRepublics, but with Great Powers, there will be no time for muddling at\r\nthe beginning of war, and it is vital that this muddling should be\r\nguarded against. If we are to look forward as a matter of certainty that\r\nthis country is always to muddle at the beginning of a war, then we may\r\nlook forward with almost certainty to defeat.\"\r\n\r\nDilke then examined the excuses that had been made for the Government,\r\nto the effect that the war took them by surprise and that they had no\r\nknowledge of the Boer preparations. He showed that both these pleas were\r\ninconsistent with the facts. Mr. Balfour had said that the Government\r\nhad thought it their duty, during the negotiations which preceded the\r\nwar, to abstain from unnecessary menace. Dilke pointed out that they did\r\nnot so abstain. Lord Salisbury had said on July 28th, 1899, \"the\r\nConventions are mortal ... they are liable to be destroyed.\" That could\r\nonly be understood by the Boers as holding out the prospect of a war in\r\nwhich the independence of their country would be taken away. Were these\r\nwords wise when used without the smallest preparation for war having\r\nbeen made? As regards knowledge of the Boer preparations, the\r\nIntelligence Department had admirably done its work. No Government was\r\never so well informed as to the resources of its opponents as the\r\nBritish Government in entering upon this war. Dilke went on to say:\r\n\r\n    \"Both by those who would have anticipated war and by the Government\r\n    it has been alleged that the existence of a Parliamentary Opposition\r\n    was the reason why the military precautions of the Government were\r\n    inefficacious. But the Government has been in power since July,\r\n    1895, and has been supported by overwhelming majorities, and it\r\n    would have had the cheerful acquiescence of the House of Commons for\r\n    every measure of military precaution and all the military\r\n    expenditure which was asked. The Cabinet are responsible; but if\r\n    there is to be any difficulty on account of the existence of a\r\n    constitutional Opposition--even a weak one--I say that by that\r\n    doctrine we are fated to be beaten on every occasion we go to war.\r\n    The time for the reform of our military system will come when this\r\n    war has ended. We cannot reform it in a time of war. We have often\r\n    addressed the House upon this subject. We preached to deaf ears. We\r\n    were not listened to before war. Shall we be listened to when war is\r\n    over? While I admit that in a time of war you cannot reform your\r\n    military system, what you can do is to press home to the Cabinet the\r\n    responsibility.... For some years past there have been discussions\r\n    as to Empire expansion which have divided some of us from others on\r\n    military questions. There are some of us, who are strong supporters\r\n    of the Government in preparing for war in the present situation of\r\n    the world, who are not in favour of what is called the expansion of\r\n    the Empire. We have resisted it because we believed the military\r\n    requirements of the Empire were greater--as it was put by Lord\r\n    Charles Beresford, whom we see here no longer--than we were prepared\r\n    to meet. And the Government now come down to the House and quietly\r\n    tell us that that is so. They have put it in the Queen's Speech. We\r\n    have it stated that, although the money we have to spend in military\r\n    preparations is more than that of any other Power in the world, we\r\n    are going to be asked to spend more. I should hope that good may\r\n    come out of evil, and that a result of this sad war may be the\r\n    proper utilization of our resources in preparing, in times of peace,\r\n    all the military forces of what people call Greater Britain.... I\r\n    venture to say that the Government went into this war without the\r\n    preparation they should have made. Their neglect of that precaution\r\n    has brought about the reverses we have met with, and the natural\r\n    consequence is the failure of our arms I have described. As regards\r\n    the Crimean War, which in some respects has been compared with this,\r\n    one is reminded of the present Commander-in-Chief, who has written\r\n    these momentous words: The history of the Crimean War shows 'how an\r\n    army may be destroyed by a Ministry through want of ordinary\r\n    forethought.' I confess that I think there is only one point in\r\n    which the two cases are exactly parallel--for there are many\r\n    distinctions between them--and that is in the heroism of officers\r\n    and men.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 27th, 1900, on the occasion of a supplementary estimate for the\r\nSouth African War, Dilke criticized the censorship of letters from the\r\nfront, in consequence of which the truth about the military mistakes\r\nmade remained unknown. He reviewed a series of blunders that had been\r\nmade in the war, and quoted the opinion of an eminent foreign strategist\r\nto the effect that \"the mistakes which had been made were mistakes on\r\nimmutable and permanent principles.\" Thus, there was a doubt whether the\r\narmy had been properly trained for war in the past and was being\r\nproperly trained at that moment. He asked for a full inquiry into these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThat inquiry was never made. The Royal Commission appointed after the\r\nwar to inquire into its conduct began by disclaiming authority to\r\ninquire into the policy out of which the war arose, and by asserting its\r\nown incompetence to discuss the military operations.\r\n\r\nIn a paper contributed to the _New Liberal Review_ of February, 1901,\r\nDilke reviewed the South African War, and summed up:\r\n\r\n    \"The war, then, has revealed deficiency in the war training of the\r\n    Staff in particular, and of the army generally. It has shown that\r\n    the recommendations of the Commander-in-Chief to the Cabinet for the\r\n    nomination of Generals to high commands were not based on real\r\n    tests. It has called attention to the amateurishness of portions of\r\n    our forces. It has proved that for years the reformers have been\r\n    right, and the War Office wrong, as regards the number and\r\n    proportion of guns needed by us and the rapidity of the mobilization\r\n    of our artillery.\r\n\r\n    \"Remedies which will certainly be attempted are--Better training of\r\n    the Staff, especially in the thinking out and writing of orders;\r\n    weeding out of incompetent amateurs from among our officers; better\r\n    pay for the men; careful preparation in time of peace of a picked\r\n    Imperial force of mounted infantry from all parts of the Empire. But\r\n    greater changes, urgently as they are demanded by the national\r\n    interest, will not be accomplished, as public excitement will die\r\n    down, and triflers and obstructives will remain at the head of\r\n    affairs, in place of the Carnot who is needed as organizer to back\r\n    the best General that can be found for the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n    \"The greatest of the lessons of the war was the revelation of the\r\n    neglect, by statesmen, to prepare for wars which their policy must\r\n    lead them to contemplate as possible.... The long duration of the\r\n    war, with all its risks to our Imperial interests, is to be laid at\r\n    the door of the politicians rather than of the Generals. This, the\r\n    greatest lesson, has not been learnt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAfter the General Election of December, 1900, there was a shifting of\r\noffices in the Cabinet, by which Mr. Brodrick succeeded Lord Lansdowne\r\nas Secretary of State for War, and Lord Selborne became First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty instead of Mr. Goschen. Lord Roberts was brought home from\r\nSouth Africa to become Commander-in-Chief, and the direction of the war\r\nwas left in the hands of Lord Kitchener. The first important event in\r\nthe new Parliament was a speech by Lord Wolseley in the House of Lords,\r\nin which he warned the nation against the dangerous consequences of the\r\nsystem introduced in 1895, which failed to give its proper place to the\r\nmilitary judgment in regard to preparations for war. The warning was\r\ndisregarded. Mr. Brodrick announced the determination of the Government\r\nto maintain the system set up in 1895, and to give to Lord Roberts as\r\nCommander-in-Chief the same position of maimed and crippled authority as\r\nhad been given to Lord Wolseley six years before.\r\n\r\nMr. Brodrick, while carrying on the war in South Africa, attempted at\r\nthe same time to reform the army. The results were the more unfortunate\r\nbecause on vital matters, both of organization at the War Office and of\r\nthe reorganization of the army, Mr. Brodrick insisted on overriding the\r\ngreat soldier to whom, as Commander-in-Chief, was due whatever\r\nconfidence the country gave to the military administration. Mr. Brodrick\r\nwas much preoccupied with the defence of the United Kingdom against\r\ninvasion. In the debate on the Army Estimates of 1901, Dilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"I am one of those who hold that the command of the seas is the\r\n    defence of this country. I believe that the British Army exists\r\n    mainly for the reinforcement of the Indian garrison, and, if\r\n    necessary, as the rudiment of that army which, in the event of a\r\n    great war, would be necessary.\"\r\n\r\nDilke continued to support the Admiralty in its endeavours to strengthen\r\nthe navy. In the debate on the Navy Estimates of 1901 (March 22nd) he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"The Secretary of State for the Colonies a few years ago made a\r\n    speech in favour of an alliance with a military Power. [Footnote:\r\n    See _infra_, p. 491.] He said that the alternative was to build up\r\n    so as to make ourselves safe against a combination of three Powers,\r\n    and that that would entail an addition of fifty per cent. to the\r\n    estimates. Since that time we have added more than fifty per cent.\r\n    to our estimates. Of course the expenditure is very great; but is\r\n    there a man in this House who believes that it is not necessary for\r\n    us to maintain that practical standard which would lead even three\r\n    Powers to hesitate before attacking? During the last year we have,\r\n    happily, had friendship between ourselves and Germany; I believe\r\n    that friendship may long continue, and I hope it will. But it is\r\n    impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that there have been\r\n    distinctly proposed to the German Houses, by Admiral Tirpitz,\r\n    estimates which are based on the possibility of a war with England.\r\n    Von der Goltz, who is the highest literary authority on this\r\n    subject, has said the same thing. We have seen also that remarkable\r\n    preparation of strategic cables on the part of Germany ... in order\r\n    to be entirely independent of British cables in the event of a\r\n    possible naval war. In face of facts of that kind, which can be\r\n    infinitely multiplied, it seems to me it would be monstrous on our\r\n    part to fail to maintain that standard, and that it is our bounden\r\n    duty to make up for the delays which have occurred, and to vote\r\n    programmes for the future which should be sufficient to keep up that\r\n    standard.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Navy Estimates for 1902 were introduced into the House of\r\nCommons by Arnold-Forster as Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty,\r\nMr. Lough moved an amendment: \"That the growing expenditure on the naval\r\ndefences of the Empire imposes under the existing conditions an undue\r\nburden on the taxpayers of the United Kingdom.\" Dilke, in opposing the\r\namendment, deprecated the introduction of party considerations into a\r\ndiscussion concerning the navy. The time taken to build ships ought to\r\nbe borne in mind. The usual period had lately been four years; many of\r\nthe ships of the 1897 programme had not yet been commissioned; therefore\r\nit was necessary to remember that the country would go into a naval war\r\nwith ships according to the programme of four or five years before war\r\nwas declared. Mr. Goschen was a careful First Lord of the Admiralty, yet\r\nMr. Goschen in his programme year after year alluded to the necessity of\r\nmaintaining a fleet which would cause not two but three Powers to pause\r\nbefore they attacked us. To his (Dilke's) mind, it was infinitely more\r\nimportant to the country that its expenditure should be shaped, not\r\ntowards meeting a sudden attack by two Powers, which was not going to\r\noccur, but towards meeting--not immediately, but in time to come--the\r\npossibility of an eventual joining together of three Powers, one of\r\nwhich was very rapidly building a magnificent fleet. From that point of\r\nview the programme of the Government this year was a beggarly programme.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the Navy Estimates for 1903 Arnold-Forster said that they\r\nwere of a magnitude unparalleled in peace or war. Dilke, in supporting\r\nthem, said (March 17th):\r\n\r\n    \"The standard which Lord Spencer gave to this House was not a fleet\r\n    equivalent to three fleets--not a fleet, certainly, on all points\r\n    equivalent to the fleets of France, Germany, and Russia--but a\r\n    standard which gave us such a position in the world of fleets as\r\n    would cause three Powers to pause before they entered into a\r\n    coalition against us. That was a position he had always contended\r\n    was necessary for the safety of this country.... The only weak point\r\n    that one could discern as really dangerous in the future was the\r\n    training of the officers for high command and the selection of\r\n    officers, which would give this country, in the event of war, that\r\n    real unity of operations which ought to be our advantage against any\r\n    allied Powers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nOn June 20th, 1902, Lord Charles Beresford had raised the question of\r\nthe organization of the Admiralty, which he held to be defective for the\r\npurpose of preparation for war. \"The administrative faculty,\" he said,\r\n\"should be absolutely separate from the executive faculty, but at\r\npresent they were mixed up.\" Campbell-Bannerman held that no change was\r\nnecessary. Dilke supported Lord Charles Beresford, and after reviewing\r\nthe cordite debates of 1895, to which both the previous speakers had\r\nreferred, gave his reasons for holding that the duty of the Cabinet was\r\nto control both services in order to secure that each should take its\r\nproper share in defence. \"If there was a very strong man, or even one\r\nwho thought himself very strong, at the head of either department, the\r\npresent system tended to break down, because, unless there was some\r\njoint authority in the Cabinet strong enough to control even a strong\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, no joint consideration of the views of the\r\ntwo departments could be obtained. At the present moment the two\r\nservices competed.\" Lord Charles Beresford and Dilke were supported by\r\nSir John Colomb, and in his reply Arnold-Forster said: \"I cannot but\r\nreaffirm the belief I held before I stood at this table, and since I\r\nhave stood here, that there is a need for some reinforcement of the\r\nintellectual equipment which directs or ought to direct the enormous\r\nforces of our Empire.\" The question was raised again on August 6th by\r\nMajor Seely, in a speech in which he commented on the lack of a body\r\ncharged with the duty of studying strategical questions. Mr. Balfour\r\nthereupon said:\r\n\r\n    \"We cannot leave this matter to one department or two departments\r\n    acting separately. It is a joint matter; it must be a joint matter.\r\n    I hope my honourable friend will take it from me that the Government\r\n    are fully alive, and have, if I may say so, long been fully alive,\r\n    to the difficulty of the problem which presents itself to his mind\r\n    and which he has explained to the House; and that that problem is\r\n    one always present to our minds. It is one which we certainly do not\r\n    mean to neglect to meet and grapple with to the best of our\r\n    ability.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1903, in an article contributed to the Northern Newspaper Syndicate,\r\nDilke wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"We are face to face with the fact that Mr. Brodrick's scheme is\r\n    admitted from all sides, except by those actually responsible for it\r\n    who are still holding office, to be a failure; that under this\r\n    scheme the charge on the British Empire for defence in time of peace\r\n    stands at eighty-six millions sterling, of which fifty-two millions\r\n    at least are for land defence, nevertheless ill secured; that\r\n    without a complete change of system these gigantic figures must\r\n    rapidly increase; and that, while all agree that in our case the\r\n    navy ought to be predominant, no one seems to be able to control the\r\n    War Office, or to limit the expenditure upon land defence as\r\n    contrasted with naval preparations. The service members of the House\r\n    of Commons, who used to be charged with wasting their own and the\r\n    nation's time upon military details, or upon proposals for increase\r\n    of expenditure, have shown their patriotism and their intelligence\r\n    by going to the root of this great question. They brought about the\r\n    declaration of the Secretary of the Admiralty, Mr. Arnold-Forster,\r\n    on June 20th, 1902, and the complete acceptance of that declaration\r\n    by the Prime Minister on August 6th. They have now forced on\r\n    Parliament and on the Prime Minister the necessity of taking real\r\n    action upon his declaration that 'the problem of Imperial defence\r\n    cannot be left to one department or two departments acting\r\n    separately.' The utilization of the resources of the British Empire\r\n    for war must be the business of the Prime Minister, who is above the\r\n    War Office and the Admiralty, and who alone can lead the Cabinet to\r\n    co-ordinate the efforts of the two services.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1903, Arnold-Forster was appointed to succeed Mr. Brodrick\r\nas Secretary of State for War. He had previously expressed, in\r\nconversation, his wish to see the whole subject of Imperial defence\r\nentrusted to a Committee of three men conversant with it, and had named\r\nSir Charles Dilke and Sir John Colomb as two of the three whom he would\r\nchoose if he had the power. In November a Committee of three was\r\nappointed by Mr. Balfour to report on the organization of the War\r\nOffice. Its members were Lord Esher, Admiral Sir John (now Lord) Fisher,\r\nand Sir George Sydenham Clarke (now Lord Sydenham). The first instalment\r\nof this Committee's report, published on February 1st, 1904, proposed\r\nthe reconstitution of the War Office on the model of the Board of\r\nAdmiralty, and as a preliminary the dismissal of the Commander-in-Chief\r\nand the heads of the great departments at the War Office.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Cabinet Committee of Defence was reconstituted\r\nunder the presidency of the Prime Minister (Mr. Balfour). Thus at\r\nlength, eleven years after Sir Charles Dilke's first conversations with\r\nMr. Balfour on the subject, was adopted the suggestion he had urged for\r\nso many years, and so fully explained in his speech of March 16th, 1894,\r\nthat a Prime Minister should undertake to consider the needs both of the\r\narmy and navy, and the probable functions of both in war.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThe result was very soon manifest in a complete change of policy, which\r\nwas no doubt facilitated by the presence in the Cabinet, as Secretary of\r\nState for War, of Mr. Arnold-Forster, one of the signatories of the\r\njoint letter of 1894.\r\n\r\nOn March 28th, 1905, Arnold-Forster said:\r\n\r\n    \"We have been adding million after million to our naval expenditure.\r\n    Are all these millions wasted? If it be true, as we are told by\r\n    representatives of the Admiralty, that the navy is in a position\r\n    such as it has never occupied before--that it is now not only our\r\n    first line of defence, but our guarantee for the possession of our\r\n    own islands--is that to make no difference to a system which has\r\n    grown up avowedly and confessedly on the basis of defending these\r\n    islands by an armed land force against an invasion? Is that to make\r\n    no difference? Is this view some invention of my own imagination?\r\n    No, sir, that is the deliberate conclusion of the Government,\r\n    advised by a body which has been called into, I believe, a useful\r\n    existence during the last eighteen months, and which I regret was\r\n    not called into existence much longer ago--the Committee of\r\n    Defence.... I have seen it stated that, provided our navy is\r\n    sufficient, the greatest anticipation we can form in the way of a\r\n    landing of a hostile army would be a force of 5,000. I should be\r\n    deceiving the House if I thought that represented the extreme naval\r\n    view. The extreme naval view is that the crew of a dinghy could not\r\n    land in this country in the face of the navy.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech showed the conversion of the Government, for which Sir\r\nCharles Dilke had laboured so long, to the doctrine of the primacy of\r\nthe navy and of defence by the command of the sea.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th, Mr. Balfour in the name of the Committee of Defence put\r\nforth the general view which that body had reached. In the first place,\r\nprovided the navy was efficient, a successful invasion of the country\r\nupon a large scale need not be contemplated. Secondly, the Committee had\r\ngone on the broad line that our force should as far as possible be\r\nconcentrated at the centre of the Empire. This had rendered unnecessary\r\nexpenditure which had been undertaken under a different view of our\r\nneeds, the most notable case being the works at St. Lucia, which had\r\nbeen made by Lord Carnarvon into a great naval base. Lastly, with regard\r\nto India, the Government adopted Lord Kitchener's view that in addition\r\nto drafts there should be available in the relatively early stages of\r\nthe war eight divisions of infantry and other corresponding arms.\r\n\r\nDilke, who had described himself as a constant supporter of the\r\nblue-water view, agreed with the Government with regard to invasion, and\r\nwelcomed Mr. Balfour's moderate view with regard to the needs of India.\r\nBut he pointed out that vast sums of money had been spent in the\r\nfortification of places which were now discovered to be unnecessary.\r\n\r\n    \"He asked the Committee to remember how far the responsibility of\r\n    all this expenditure had been on the present occupants of office. He\r\n    believed that the Defence Committee of the Cabinet was created by\r\n    Lord Rosebery at the end of his Administration in 1895. That was the\r\n    first form of the Committee. Immediately the new Government came in\r\n    it assumed its second form, and the Defence Committee of the\r\n    Conservative Government, formed in 1895 under the presidency of the\r\n    Duke of Devonshire, lasted for many years, and was composed of\r\n    substantially the same gentlemen as were in power now. It was\r\n    constantly vouched to the House as the great co-ordinating\r\n    authority, and as the body responsible for expenditure on an\r\n    enormous scale on principles diametrically opposed to those now\r\n    held. The third form of the Committee was that which was adopted\r\n    when the Prime Minister acceded to his present office. The right\r\n    hon. gentleman came to this House and at once explained the new form\r\n    of the Committee on March 5th, 1903.... The Committee had heard\r\n    to-day the extent to which invasion at home was believed in by the\r\n    Defence Committee.... It was firmly expected from the moment that\r\n    the Government announced their naval view that the reduction would\r\n    be under the military head. But instead of that the reduction had\r\n    been on the Navy Estimates, and that had not been accompanied by a\r\n    reduction on the army votes. That had been the amazing effect of the\r\n    co-ordination. Had any member of the Committee calculated how much\r\n    money had been wasted in the last nine and a half years by the\r\n    non-adoption in 1895, when virtually the present Government came\r\n    into office, of the policy which had been adopted now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe Government which had thus tardily followed Sir Charles Dilke's lead\r\nhad lost the confidence of the country. The General Election of 1905\r\ngave the Liberals a large majority. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the\r\nnew Prime Minister, had not forgotten Dilke's vote in the cordite\r\ndivision of 1895, and did not share his view of the necessity to be\r\nready for war, and to rely, not upon arbitration, but upon the\r\norganization of defensive preparations. Dilke was not included in the\r\nnew Ministry, in which Mr. (now Lord) Haldane was appointed Secretary of\r\nState for War. Mr. Haldane undertook a fresh reorganization of the\r\nmilitary forces of the country, taking the Committee of Defence and the\r\nArmy Council as they were left by Mr. Balfour after the changes proposed\r\nby the Esher Committee. The Order in Council gave the Secretary of State\r\nthe power to reserve for his own decision any matter whatever, and to\r\nimpose that decision upon the Army Council, a power not contemplated by\r\nthe Esher Committee's report. Mr. Haldane availed himself of this power\r\nand of the assistance of Colonel Ellison, who had been Secretary to the\r\nEsher Committee, but was not a member of the Army Council, to prepare\r\nhis scheme. It consisted in the organization of an expeditionary force,\r\nwhich was to be composed of six divisions and a cavalry division, with a\r\ntotal field strength of 160,000 men, fully equipped for war, together\r\nwith additional troops at home to make good the losses of a campaign.\r\nThis force was to be made up of the regular army (of which the\r\nestablishments were reduced by some 20,000 of all arms), of its reserve,\r\nand of the militia, renamed special reserve, also with a reduced\r\nestablishment, and with a liability to serve abroad in case of war. The\r\nVolunteer force was to be renamed the Territorial force, and its\r\nofficers and men to be brought under the Army Act, the men to be\r\nenlisted for a term of years and paid. It was to be organized, as the\r\nNorfolk Commission had suggested, into brigades and divisions. But the\r\nfurther suggestion of the same Commission, that a member of the Army\r\nCouncil familiar with the volunteer system should be charged with its\r\nsupervision, was not adopted. Mr. Haldane's view was that the\r\nterritorial troops could not in peace receive a training which would\r\nprepare them for war, but that, as England was not a Continental Power\r\nand was protected by her navy, there would be six months' time, after a\r\nwar had begun, to give them a training for war. The force was to be\r\nadministered by County Associations to be constituted for the purpose.\r\nThe scheme was gradually elaborated, and in its later stage improved by\r\nthe transformation of the University and some other volunteer and cadet\r\ncorps into officers' training corps. The works which, at the suggestion\r\nof Sir John Ardagh, had been prepared for the defence of London were\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nMr. Haldane first expounded his plans in March, 1906, and in the debate\r\nof March 15th Dilke said:\r\n\r\n    \"There was a little too much depreciation of the Volunteers; and\r\n    although he had always been considered a strong supporter of the\r\n    'blue-water' view, yet he had always believed in accepting from the\r\n    Volunteers all the service they could give, as he believed they\r\n    would give an enormous potential supply of men.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Haldane explained (February 25th, 1907) that the expeditionary force\r\nwould require only seventy-two batteries, while the army actually had a\r\nhundred and five; there was therefore a surplus of thirty-three\r\nbatteries which he would use as training batteries in which to train men\r\nfor divisional ammunition columns. Upon this Dilke's comment was that\r\n\"if the officer difficulty could be solved, then the real military\r\nproblem would be solved.\" We could raise men fast enough through the\r\nvolunteer system, and turn them into good infantry, provided there was a\r\nsufficient supply of officers qualified to train them; but the infantry\r\nwhich could thus be produced in a few months would require to be\r\nsupplemented by artillery and cavalry which could not be improvised. He\r\nwould have faced the cost of keeping up these arms, and would not have\r\nsaved by turning batteries into ammunition columns.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on Mr. Haldane's Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill (June\r\n3rd), Dilke voted for an amendment of which the purpose was to establish\r\na department at the War Office under an officer having special knowledge\r\nand experience with the militia, yeomanry, and volunteers, ranking as\r\nthird member of the Army Council. This amendment, however, was not\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the _Manchester Guardian_ of June 6th, 1907, Dilke\r\nexplained his main objections to Mr. Haldane's scheme and to the Bill\r\nwhich was to lay its foundation.\r\n\r\n\"The cost,\" he wrote, \"must undoubtedly be large, and it is difficult to\r\nsee where the substantial saving on Army Estimates, twice promised by\r\nMr. Ritchie when Chancellor of the Exchequer, but not yet secured, is to\r\nbe obtained. As an advocate of a strong fleet, I have a special reason,\r\nequivalent to that of the most rigid economist, for insisting upon the\r\nreduction in our enormous military charge, inasmuch as the money\r\nunexpectedly needed for the army will come off the fleet.\"\r\n\r\nDilke thought that the defence of Great Britain depended upon the navy;\r\nthat so long as the navy was equal to its task invasion was not to be\r\nfeared. The function of the military forces would be to fight an enemy\r\nabroad. He, therefore, held it a mistake to increase expenditure on\r\ntroops which it was not proposed to train to meet foreign regulars. The\r\nTerritorial army would be the volunteers under a new name, but without\r\nan improved training. As the linked-battalion system and the long term\r\nof service were retained, the regular army would still be costly, and\r\nits reserves or power of quick expansion less than they might be. Mr.\r\nHaldane would be compelled to retain a high rate of War Office\r\nexpenditure, and this would involve a reduction on the outlay for the\r\nnavy, which was all-important. Mr. Haldane, however, had the support of\r\na very large majority, and argument was of little avail. Sir Charles\r\nDilke therefore threw his weight into the debates on the Navy estimates,\r\nin which he consistently supported the Admiralty in every increase.\r\n\r\nYear after year he persevered in the effort to counteract the tendency\r\nto exaggerate the importance of military schemes and military\r\nexpenditure, especially upon troops not fully trained and not kept ready\r\nfor action abroad, and to point out that the effect of such schemes\r\ncould not but be to reduce the amount of attention and of money devoted\r\nto the navy. In 1904 (March 1st) he had said:\r\n\r\n    \"It was an extraordinary fact that, in all calculations on the\r\n    subject of the expenditure of the army, the cost of the army outside\r\n    the United Kingdom was never taken into account. We were spending\r\n    vastly more upon the land services than we were upon our naval\r\n    services, and so long as that was so he confessed that he should\r\n    view with more than indulgence what was called the extravagant\r\n    policy in regard to the navy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1907 (March 5th) he expressed his disapproval of the sweeping change\r\nby which the defence of ports by submarine mines had been abolished.\r\n\"Newcastle had been defended by means of an admirable system of\r\nsubmarine mines which had no equal in the world. So good was it that the\r\nvolunteer submarine miners of the Tyne division were employed to do the\r\nlaying of electric mines at Portsmouth and other naval ports. Newcastle\r\nwas now without that defence.\" He explained that these mines, which had\r\ncost a million, had been sold. Had they fetched £50,000? He was not\r\ncontent with Mr. Haldane's account of the steps taken to prepare for\r\ndefence against possible raid. On this subject, writing for the _United\r\nService Magazine_ of May, 1908, a paper entitled \"Strong at all Points,\"\r\nwhich enforced his view of the supreme importance of the navy, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"The provision for time of war, after complete mobilization of the\r\n    Territorial army, may be perfect upon paper; but the real question\r\n    is, how to obtain the manning of the quick-firing guns, say on the\r\n    Tyne, in time of political complication, by trained men, who sleep\r\n    by the guns and are able to use them when awakened suddenly in the\r\n    dead of night.\"\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the estimates of July 31st, 1907, he said that,\r\n\"bearing in mind the enormous importance in naval matters of a steady\r\npolicy, he should resist any reduction that might be moved.\" On the same\r\noccasion he pointed out that, \"if there was any danger from Germany, it\r\nwas not the danger of invasion or from the fleet, but it was her growing\r\nsuperiority in the scientific equipment of her people.\" Yet he declined\r\nto encourage panic, and in the debate of March 22nd, 1909, when the\r\nOpposition moved a vote of censure because of a supposed unforeseen\r\nstart gained by Germany in shipbuilding, pointed out the reasons for not\r\nindulging in a scare.\r\n\r\nDilke closely watched the new developments in armament and construction,\r\nand from time to time pressed them upon the attention of the Government.\r\nAs early as 1901, in an article reviewing the progress of war in the\r\nnineteenth century, he had said: \"The greatest change in the\r\nbattlefields of the future, as compared with those of a few years ago,\r\nwill be found in the developments and increased strength of the\r\nartillery.\" In 1907, in the debate on the Navy estimates, he suggested\r\nthat \"the reserve of guns was a matter which needed the utmost\r\ndiligence.\" Docks, he thought, were proportionately more important than\r\nbattleships. In 1907 (April 25th) he said: \"A base was needed east of\r\nDover--Rosyth or Chatham: he need not suggest or criticize the spot that\r\nshould be chosen. Whether the Hague Conference prohibited floating mines\r\nor not, they would be used; and that being so, they must contemplate\r\neither the extension of Chatham or the creation of an establishment at a\r\ndifferent point of the east coast.\" To this subject he repeatedly\r\nreturned. In 1908 (March 3rd): \"The necessity for a large establishment\r\nin a safer place than the Channel had been raised for many years, and\r\nwas fully recognized when Rosyth was brought before them. Both parties\r\nhad shirked the expenditure which both declared necessary.\" On March\r\n10th: \"There were important works, docks and basins in which big ships\r\ncould be accommodated, and these by universal admission should be made\r\nas rapidly as possible. Big ships were worse than useless if there was\r\nno dock or basin accommodation for them.... The limited instalment of\r\none dock and one basin contemplated was only to be completed in eleven\r\nyears. He believed that was bad economy.... The need for this\r\nexpenditure had long been foreseen.\" Again, in 1909, on July 1st, he\r\npointed out that the Governments of both parties had shirked the\r\nexpenditure on Rosyth, of which the need had been known as early as\r\n1902. The delay had been enormously grave. The report which contained\r\nthe whole scheme had been presented to Parliament in January, 1902; the\r\nland had been bought in 1903, and the contract was made only in March,\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nSir Charles's command of detail made his hearers apt to suppose that he\r\nwas mainly concerned with technical matters. But no impression could be\r\nfarther from the truth. Never for a moment did he lose sight of the\r\nlarge issues, and of the purpose to which all measures of naval and\r\nmilitary preparation are directed. It was to the large issues that his\r\nlast important Parliamentary speech on the subject of defence was\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\"We talk a little,\" he said on March 7th, 1910, \"about the possibility\r\nof invasion when we talk of our Territorial army, but we do not--the\r\noverwhelming majority of us--believe the country is open to invasion, or\r\nthat the fleet has fallen off in its power of doing its duty as compared\r\nwith days past.... No one of us who is prepared to pay his part, and to\r\ncall upon others to pay their part, to keep the fleet up to the highest\r\nstandard of efficiency and safety which we at present enjoy--no one of\r\nus ought to be prepared to run the Territorial army on this occasion as\r\nthough it were the main and most costly portion of the estimates that\r\nare put before the House. The Territorial army is defensible as the\r\nVolunteers were defensible. It is an improvement on the volunteer\r\nsystem, and it might have been made without the statute on which it is\r\nbased, but that it will add an enormous expenditure to our army is not\r\nthe case. Our Territorial army, in fact, cannot be kept in view as the\r\nfirst object which we have to consider in the course of these\r\ndebates.... It is supposed to be the one certain result of the last\r\nGeneral Election that there is a large majority in favour of maintaining\r\nour naval position; but we cannot maintain that naval position without\r\nstraining every nerve to do it, and we shall not be able to put all our\r\nenergy into maintaining that position if we talk about invasion, and\r\ntell the people of this country that the fleet cannot do its duty.... If\r\nyou put the doctrine of invasion so high, and if you tell them that in\r\nany degree their safety depends upon the Territorial army trained and\r\nserving here at home, then you run a great risk of compromising your\r\nnaval defence and taking money out of one pocket and putting it into\r\nanother, and of being weak at both points, and creating a Territorial\r\narmy which could not face a great Continental force landed on our\r\nshores, and at the same time detracting from the power of your fleet....\r\nThe Territorial army, like the Volunteers, is really defended by most of\r\nus, in our hearts if not in our speech, as a reserve of the regular,\r\nexpeditionary, offensive army for fighting across the seas.... My right\r\nhon. friend Mr. Haldane has always maintained the view that your army\r\nand army expenditure must depend upon policy. It is no good fighting\r\nhim; he has both Houses of Parliament and both parties in his pocket. He\r\nis a man of legions political as well as military. The school\r\nrepresented by myself and the dominant school represented by him have\r\ndiffered, not upon the question of policy dictating your armaments, but\r\nupon the question of how your policy and your armaments together would\r\nwork out.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's last utterance on defence was a review of Sir\r\nCyprian Bridge's _Sea-Power, and Other Studies_, in July, 1910. It was a\r\nplea for reliance upon the navy to prevent invasion and upon a mobile\r\nmilitary force for a counter-stroke. \"I confess,\" Dilke ended, \"that, as\r\none interested in complete efficiency rather than especially in economy\r\nto the national purse, I join Sir Cyprian Bridge in asking to be shown,\r\nat least, the mobile, efficient, regular force ready for immediate\r\nservice across the seas.\"\r\n\r\nIn the effort of a quarter of a century to have his country prepared for\r\nthe struggle which was to come Dilke was associated with others, many of\r\nthem conspicuous for knowledge and zeal; the services of Arnold-Forster,\r\nof John and Philip Colomb, and of Chesney, have been too little\r\nappreciated by their countrymen. Of their common endeavour Dilke was the\r\nchief exponent. At every stage of the movement his was its most\r\ncharacteristic and most comprehensive expression, marking the central\r\nline of thought. Some of the dominant ideas were his own. From him came\r\nthe conception of defence as not merely national but imperial. He first\r\npointed out the true function of the Prime Minister in relation to it.\r\nThe actual development proceeded along the lines which he drew--a strong\r\nnavy; a general staff at the War Office; a regular army of first-rate\r\nquality, that could be sent abroad at short notice, most likely for the\r\ndefence of Belgium against attacks from Germany; expansion to be sought,\r\nin the first instance, from the numbers furnished by the volunteer\r\nsystem. There were points which he failed to carry--the provision of\r\narms and ammunition for the multitude of soldiers who would be\r\nforthcoming from the Empire, as well as of that modern artillery which\r\nmust play so great a part in a future campaign; the search for generals\r\ncapable of command in war; the enforcement of the responsibility of\r\nMinisters for preparations neglected. What was accomplished and what was\r\nleft undone give the measure of Sir Charles Dilke as the statesman of\r\nImperial Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\n    '\"_December 21st_, 1893.\r\n\r\n    '\"Dear Mr. Balfour,\r\n\r\n    '\"I have been thinking over the matter which you mentioned in the\r\n    tea-room yesterday. I am absolutely convinced of your own detachment\r\n    from party in connection with it, and I write as one not likely at\r\n    any time to act generally in connection with your party, unless in\r\n    the (I hope most improbable) event of doubtful or unfortunate war.\r\n\r\n    '\"The suggestion that I am inclined to make is that a letter should\r\n    be written, to be signed by Sir George Chesney as a Conservative, by\r\n    myself as a Gladstonian Liberal, by Arnold-Forster as a Liberal\r\n    Unionist, and Spenser Wilkinson as a civilian expert, to Mr.\r\n    Gladstone as Prime Minister, you and Chamberlain as leaders of your\r\n    parties in the House of Commons, and Lord Salisbury and the Duke of\r\n    Devonshire as leaders of the same parties in the House of Lords;\r\n    that a copy should be sent by me confidentially to the Prince of\r\n    Wales, it not being right, of course, that we should in any way\r\n    address the Queen; that this letter should not be made public either\r\n    at the time or later; that this letter should press for the joint\r\n    consideration of the naval and military problem, and should point to\r\n    the creation of a Defence Ministry, of which the War Office and the\r\n    Admiralty would be the branches, or to a more active control of the\r\n    Secretary of State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty by\r\n    the Prime Minister personally. We should be put in our places by Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, but I fancy, probably, not by the other four.\r\n\r\n    '\"I had sooner discuss this matter first with you, if you think\r\n    there is anything in it, than with Chamberlain, because he is, oddly\r\n    enough, a much stronger party man than you are, and would be less\r\n    inclined (on account of national objects which to him are\r\n    predominant) to keep party out of his mind in connection with it. I\r\n    have not, therefore, as yet mentioned the matter to him. If you\r\n    think ill of the whole suggestion, and are not even disposed to\r\n    suggest modification of it, it can be stopped at the present point.\r\n\r\n    '\"The addition of Spenser Wilkinson to a member of each party is\r\n    because I owe to him the clearing of my own mind, and believe that\r\n    he is probably the best man on such questions who ever lived, except\r\n    Clausewitz. When I first wrote upon them in _The Present Position of\r\n    European Politics_ in 1886-87, and in _The British Army_ in 1887-88,\r\n    I was in a fog--seeing the existing evils, but not clearly seeing\r\n    the way out. In the Defence chapter of _Problems of Greater Britain_\r\n    I began to see my way. Admiral Colomb, and Thursfield of _The\r\n    Times_, who are really expositors of the application to our naval\r\n    position of the general principles of military strategy of\r\n    Clausewitz, helped me by their writings to find a road. I then set\r\n    to work with Spenser Wilkinson, whose leaders in the _Manchester\r\n    Guardian_ (which he has now quitted, except as an amateur) struck me\r\n    as being perfect, to think out the whole question; and we succeeded,\r\n    by means of a little book we wrote together--_Imperial Defence_,\r\n    published in February, 1892--in afterwards procuring the agreement\r\n    of Lord Roberts in views widely different in many points from those\r\n    which Lord Roberts had previously held. We are now in the position\r\n    of being able to declare that in naval particulars there is no\r\n    difference of opinion among the experts, and that in military there\r\n    is so little upon points of importance that the experts are\r\n    virtually agreed. This is a great point, never reached before last\r\n    year, and it is owing to Spenser Wilkinson, and in a less degree to\r\n    Arnold-Forster, that it has been reached.\r\n\r\n    '\"The question of the length at which the proposed letter should\r\n    develop the existing dangers and the remedies is, of course,\r\n    secondary.\r\n\r\n    '\"The dangers are much greater than even the alarmist section of the\r\n    public supposes. For example, the public have not in the least\r\n    grasped the fact that we were on the brink of war with France at the\r\n    moment of the Siam blockade, nor have they realized the great risk\r\n    of the fall of the monarchy in Italy and of a complete change in\r\n    Italian policy, leading more or less rapidly to an alliance with\r\n    France and Russia. The adoption of Lefevre's policy by the Liberal\r\n    party, which is possible at any time, and the announcement that we\r\n    do not hope to hold the Mediterranean, might attach to the Franco-\r\n    Russian combination even the present advisers of King Humbert.\r\n\r\n    '\"With regard to Siam, neither the English nor the French Government\r\n    dare publish the despatches which passed about the blockade, and\r\n    they have not been able to come to an agreement as to what portion\r\n    of the papers should be published, although both Governments have\r\n    long since promised publication. The words used in the House of\r\n    Commons by Sir Edward Grey were altered by the French Government\r\n    into meaningless words, and the words actually used excluded by\r\n    Governmental action from every newspaper in France.\"'\r\n\r\n    [Footnote: On December 25th, 1913, M. d'Estournelles de Constant\r\n    wrote to the _Frankfurter Zeitung_ an article warning Europe against\r\n    the chance of war breaking out, not because it is desired, but \"by\r\n    chance, by mistake, by stupidity,\" and he cited an instance from his\r\n    experiences in 1893:\r\n\r\n    \"The stage was Siam, where British India and French Indo-China were\r\n    seeking to push, one against the other, their rival spheres of\r\n    influence. Lord Dufferin, British Ambassador in Paris and ex-Viceroy\r\n    of India, was upholding the British claim, but it was in London that\r\n    the negotiations were carried on. The irreparable conflict broke out\r\n    on the day when the French Admiral, the bearer of an ultimatum,\r\n    anchored his ships in the very river of Bangkok. I was negotiating,\r\n    but during this time the British Government telegraphed to the\r\n    Admiral commanding the Pacific station to proceed also to Bangkok\r\n    with his whole fleet, which was far superior in numbers to ours.\r\n\r\n    \"I knew nothing about it; no one knew anything about it. I was\r\n    negotiating, and it was war almost to a certainty without anybody\r\n    suspecting it. I only knew this later. Happily, wireless telegraphy\r\n    did not then exist, and the orders of the Admiralty did not reach in\r\n    time the British squadron, which was then sailing somewhere in the\r\n    Pacific. Thanks to this chance delay, the negotiations had time to\r\n    come to a successful conclusion, and the agreement was concluded.\"]\r\n\r\n    On the same day Dilke received the following reply:\r\n\r\n    \"I shall be most pleased to have a further conversation with you on\r\n    the all-important subject on which we had a brief talk yesterday,\r\n    and which is dealt with in your letter of to-day.\r\n\r\n    \"I should like, however, to discuss the matter first with Lord\r\n    Salisbury (whom I shall see to-morrow), and, if you will allow me,\r\n    to show him your letter.\r\n\r\n    \"I may, however, say at once that I have _always_ been in favour of\r\n    a Defence Committee of Cabinet, with expert advisers and permanent\r\n    records carrying on the work from Government to Government; and\r\n    that, oddly enough, I pressed the idea on Asquith last week. I think\r\n    he and Rosebery would be in favour of the plan; not so the older\r\n    members of the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n    'On Friday, January 5th, 1894, I had a long interview with Balfour\r\n    upon my letter, and wrote on it to Wilkinson as follows:\r\n\r\n    '\"_Confidential_.\r\n\r\n      '\"76, Sloane Street, S.W.,\r\n        '\"_January_ 5_th_, 1894.\r\n\r\n    '\"Dear Wilkinson,\r\n\r\n    '\"I saw Balfour (in a full discussion) this afternoon. We\r\n    provisionally agreed, with Lord Salisbury's consent, that Sir George\r\n    Chesney, Arnold-Forster (if he agrees), you, and I, should sign a\r\n    letter which we should address (with the view to publishing it with\r\n    the replies) to Mr. Gladstone as Prime Minister and leader of my\r\n    party, to Lord Salisbury and to Balfour as leaders of Sir George\r\n    Chesney's party, and to the Duke of Devonshire and Chamberlain as\r\n    leaders of Arnold-Forster's party, and of which I should privately\r\n    send a copy to the Prince of Wales in the hope of its reaching the\r\n    Queen. In this letter we should press for the joint consideration of\r\n    the naval and military problem, and point either to the creation of\r\n    a Defence Ministry, of which the War Office and Admiralty would be\r\n    the branches--to which the objection is that Parliamentary consent\r\n    would be necessary--or to a more active control over the Secretary\r\n    of State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty, and their\r\n    Estimates, by the Prime Minister personally, or to that which is\r\n    Balfour's own scheme and which has the support, among our people, of\r\n    Rosebery and Asquith: the creation of a Defence Committee of the\r\n    Cabinet, ordinarily to consist of the Prime Minister, of the leader\r\n    of the other House, of the Secretary of State for War, the First\r\n    Lord, and (doubtless) the Chancellor of the Exchequer (?), with\r\n    expert advisers and permanent records which would carry on their\r\n    work from Government to Government. Mr. Gladstone would snub us. The\r\n    other four would not, and our proposal (that is, our third proposal,\r\n    which is Balfour's) would probably be adopted when the Conservatives\r\n    came in, and continued by the Liberals.\r\n\r\n    '\"Balfour would be very willing to express his favourable opinion of\r\n    our view in debate in the House of Commons, should we raise one next\r\n    Session, and Lord Salisbury is less inclined to make a strong and\r\n    distinctly favourable reply to our letter than is Balfour.\r\n\r\n    '\"Balfour would go more willingly, if possible, than he does into\r\n    the schemes if he could see his way beforehand to the saving of\r\n    money on the army for the purpose of devoting it to the navy. He\r\n    says that he himself cannot put his finger on the waste which he\r\n    knows must exist, that Buller has to some extent his confidence and\r\n    tells him that there is none, although Balfour is not convinced by\r\n    this. We discussed our Indian army scheme, to which he sees no\r\n    objection, and (very fully) the Duke of Cambridge and the extent to\r\n    which he will be supported by the Queen.\r\n\r\n    '\"Balfour sees immense difficulty in the absence of a sufficiently\r\n    commanding expert, and in the consequent jealousy between the\r\n    Admiralty and War Office officials.\r\n\r\n    '\"Will the letter which Sir George Chesney has do as a base, or\r\n    would it be better to write a shorter and a fresh letter? If the\r\n    latter, will you try your hand at it, if you approve? And after\r\n    noting this will you return it to me, that I may send it to Sir\r\n    George Chesney and then to Arnold-Forster?\r\n\r\n    '\"Balfour had in reading _us_ [Footnote: \"Us\" refers to the joint\r\n    work on Imperial Defence. One of the recommendations was to\r\n    substitute marines for soldiers in the small garrisons, such as\r\n    Bermuda.] asked questions through George Hamilton, who agrees with\r\n    us, on the point of further employment of marines, and has been told\r\n    that they would be sadly costly.\r\n\r\n                          '\"Yours very truly,\r\n                                     '\"Charles W. Dilke.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nIn reply to the joint letter, Chamberlain wrote to Dilke:\r\n\r\n    \"I have received the interesting paper on the subject of National\r\n    Defence which you have communicated to me on behalf of yourself and\r\n    the other signatories. One of the greatest difficulties which any\r\n    politician must feel in dealing with this question has been the\r\n    apparent difference of opinion among those best qualified to speak\r\n    authoritatively on the subject, and it is an important advance to\r\n    find practical proposals agreed to by some of those who have given\r\n    special study to the problems involved. Without venturing at the\r\n    present state of the inquiry to commit myself to any specific\r\n    proposal, I may say that I am favourably inclined to the main lines\r\n    laid down in your paper--namely, the closer union between the two\r\n    great departments of national defence, and the recognition of the\r\n    responsibility of the professional advisers of the Cabinet on all\r\n    questions of military and naval provision and administration.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 12th,\r\n    dealing with certain very important points connected with the\r\n    problem of National Defence. Though it would be inopportune for me\r\n    to pass any detailed judgment upon the scheme which you have laid\r\n    before me in outline, and though it is evident that difficulties of\r\n    a serious kind must attend any effort to carry out so important a\r\n    change in our traditional methods of dealing with the Admiralty and\r\n    the War Office, I may yet be permitted to express my own conviction\r\n    that the evils that you indicate are real evils, and that the\r\n    imperfections in our existing system, on which you insist, might\r\n    under certain not impossible contingencies seriously imperil our\r\n    most important national interests.\r\n\r\n    \"That four gentlemen of different training, belonging to different\r\n    parties in the State, approaching this subject from different points\r\n    of view, and having little, perhaps, in common except a very\r\n    intimate knowledge of the questions connected with National Defence,\r\n    should be in entire agreement as to the general lines along which\r\n    future reformation should proceed, is a fact of which the public\r\n    will doubtless take note, and which is not likely to be ignored by\r\n    those responsible for the preservation of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n    'Our letter was in all the papers about February 28th (1894), with\r\n    replies from Balfour and Chamberlain. Mr. Gladstone's reply, written\r\n    just before he resigned, was in his own hand, and more than usually\r\n    legible. Though it was not marked \"Private,\" I did not print it, as\r\n    it seemed too personal and playful. It meant that he had resigned,\r\n    but I did not know this till an hour after I had received it:\r\n\r\n    '\"You will forgive my pleading eyesight, which demanded the help of\r\n    others and thereby retarded operations, as an excuse for my having\r\n    failed to acknowledge the paper on Naval Defence which you were so\r\n    good as to send me. You will, I fear, find me a less interesting\r\n    correspondent than some who have replied at length, for I fear I\r\n    ought to confine myself to assuring you that I have taken care it\r\n    should come to the notice of my colleagues.\"\r\n\r\n    'On March 9th I sat near to Asquith at a dinner, and he told me that\r\n    his Defence Committee of the Cabinet, favoured by Balfour and\r\n    Rosebery, would soon be \"a fact.\" The decision was made known in a\r\n    debate which I raised on the 16th.'\r\n\r\nA note adds: 'When the Tories came in in June, 1895, they adopted the\r\nscheme of a Minister (the Duke of Devonshire) over both army and navy,\r\nwhich had been put forward in the Dilke--Chesney--Arnold-Forster--\r\nWilkinson correspondence with Balfour and Chamberlain, and originally\r\ninvented by me. On the night of the Government (Liberal) defeat\r\nCampbell-Bannerman had promised a Commander-in-Chief who should be the\r\nChief Military Adviser, a double triumph for my view.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nDEATH OF LADY DILKE--PARLIAMENT OF 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Chamberlain, by raising the question of Tariff Reform and\r\nputting himself at the head of a movement for revising the Free Trade\r\npolicy which had been accepted by both the great political parties since\r\n1846, practically broke up the Conservative Government. It survived,\r\nindeed, under the leadership of Mr. Balfour; but it was only a feeble\r\nshadow of the powerful Administration which Lord Salisbury had formed in\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nOn the motion for adjournment before the Whitsuntide recess (May 28th,\r\n1903), Sir Charles raised the whole question of commercial policy,\r\ndirecting himself chiefly to the speeches that had been made by Mr.\r\nBalfour and by Mr. Bonar Law. But it was Mr. Chamberlain's policy that\r\nwas in question. Years later, after the whole subject has been\r\nincessantly discussed, it is difficult to realize the effect produced by\r\nthe sudden and unexpected onset of that redoubtable champion. Free Trade\r\nhad been so long taken for granted that the case for it had become\r\nunfamiliar; what remained was an academic conviction, and against that\r\nChamberlain arrayed an extraordinary personal prestige backed by a\r\nboldness of assertion to which his position as a business man lent\r\nauthority. To meet an onset so sudden and so ably conducted was no easy\r\ntask, and for Dilke there was the unhappy personal element of a first\r\nangry confrontation with his old ally. Mr. Chamberlain described Sir\r\nCharles's motion as gratuitous and harassing, \"an affair of spies,\" for\r\na day had been fixed for the regular encounter. Yet what was needed then\r\nwas to show on the Liberal side that confidence which anticipates the\r\ncombat. The temper of the time is well indicated by a letter from an old\r\nfriend, the Bishop of Hereford:\r\n\r\n    \"I hope you will stick to the business, and protect ordinary people\r\n    from the new sophistry both by speech and writing. So few people\r\n    have any intellectual grip that everything may depend on the\r\n    leadership of a few men like yourself, who can speak with knowledge\r\n    and authority, and will take the trouble to put concrete facts\r\n    before the public.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tariff Reform had begun to act as a disintegrant on the\r\nUnionist party, and by the end of October, 1903, Lord James was writing\r\nto Sir Charles Dilke as to the position of Unionist Free Traders: \"Can\r\nnothing be done for these unfortunate men?\" There is no evidence that\r\ntheir state moved Sir Charles to compassion, but it is clear that he\r\nfeared lest a regrouping of parties should destroy the commanding\r\nposition which Radicals had gained, and as soon as Parliament\r\nreassembled he took action.\r\n\r\n    '_Thursday, February 11th_, 1904.--I sought an interview with John\r\n    Redmond, to whom I said that there seemed a rapidly increasing risk\r\n    of the speedy formation of a Whig Administration dominated by\r\n    Devonshire influence, and that it might be wise that he, with or\r\n    without Blake, should meet myself and Lloyd George for the Radicals,\r\n    J. R. Macdonald for the Labour Representation Committee, and with\r\n    him either Snowden or Keir Hardie. Redmond assented, and I then saw\r\n    Lloyd George. Lloyd George was at first inclined to assent, but on\r\n    second thoughts asked for time, which I think meant to see Dr.\r\n    Clifford.\r\n\r\n    '_Friday, February 12th_, 1904.--Lloyd George had not made up his\r\n    mind either way, but thought that it would be wise to meet except\r\n    for the fact that trouble might happen afterwards as to what had\r\n    passed. I pointed out that this could be easily guarded against by\r\n    his writing me a letter making any conditions or reservations which\r\n    he thought necessary, which I should show to Redmond, and write to\r\n    him that I had so shown. On this he promised to let me know on\r\n    Monday what he thought, and probably would prepare a draft letter.\r\n\r\n    '_February 18th, 1904.--Further talk with George. A little afraid of\r\n    being attacked by Perks for selling the pass on education. I said\r\n    that I must go on alone to a certain extent, and he then consented\r\n    to come in, and on my suggesting reservations--as, for example, on\r\n    education--he said: \"No, I can trust the Irish as regards the\r\n    personal matter, and, as I come in, I will come in freely without\r\n    any reservations.\"'\r\n\r\nThrough the general unsettlement which Chamberlain's new policy had\r\ncreated, a dissolution and a change of Government were now possibilities\r\nof a not distant future, and speculations were rife as to the future\r\nposition of Sir Charles. Lady Dilke, who regarded the admission of her\r\nhusband to office as a proof of his public exoneration from the charges\r\nbrought against his character, was ardently desirous that he should\r\naccept without reserve any offer of a place in the Cabinet, and it was\r\nmuch against her wish that Sir Charles imposed conditions, in\r\nconversation with a political friend who had been a member of the last\r\nLiberal Cabinet. So far as anxiety again to hold office existed on his\r\npart, it was more because of her wishes in the matter than from any\r\nstrong political ambition of his own. [Footnote: He wrote to Mr. Deakin\r\nfrom Geneva, December 9th, 1904: \"Only one word of what you say on 'too\r\ntardy rewards in higher responsibilities'! I was in the inner ring of\r\nthe Cabinet before I was either a Cabinet Minister or a Privy\r\nCouncillor, 1880-1882, and I am not likely to have the offer of the\r\nplace the work of which would tempt me. The W.O. would kill me, but I\r\ncould not refuse it. I have been told on 'authority' that it will not\r\ncome to me.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the motive which in this, as in all else, swayed him so strongly was\r\nnow to be taken away.\r\n\r\nLady Dilke's wish for her husband's return to office was shared by many\r\nRadical politicians, and in the course of the summer Captain Cecil\r\nNorton, one of the Liberal Whips, in a speech expressed his opinion of\r\nthe value of Sir Charles Dilke's services, and his anticipation that the\r\nfall of the Tory Government would bring back the Radical leader of 1885\r\nto his full share of power. This utterance was enough to set the old\r\nmachinery in motion against him. A series of meetings had been organized\r\nby the advanced Radical section of the House of Commons, and the first\r\nwas to have been held in Newington, Captain Norton's constituency, with\r\nSir Charles for the chief speaker. Threats of a hostile demonstration\r\nreached the Newington committee, and it was decided--though Sir Charles\r\nDilke was opposed to any change--that the series should be opened with a\r\nspeech from him in his old constituency, the place where he was best\r\nknown and where he had most friends. It was fixed for October 20th,\r\n1904.\r\n\r\nNothing of the reason for this change was told to Lady Dilke. Her health\r\nhad given some cause for anxiety, though at Dockett Eddy in August and\r\nat Speech House in September she had been more bright, more gay, than\r\never. She herself wrote to friends that she had \"never been so happy in\r\nher life,\" but felt need of rest, and was going to Pyrford for a long\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nShe reached Pyrford with her husband on October 15th, and he wished her\r\nto see a doctor, but she refused. \"He would stop my going up with you on\r\nThursday, and I want to go. I think I ought to be there.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long since Dilke had stood before those whom he once represented,\r\nand she was determined to be with him; she assisted at the triumphant\r\nsuccess of this meeting; but the strain of coming up to London and the\r\nexcitement justified her forecast of the doctor's opinion. That night\r\nshe was taken ill, yet till the morning would make no sign, for fear of\r\ndisturbing her husband. She admitted then that she was very ill; to\r\nPyrford, however, she was set on returning; in London she \"could not\r\nrest.\" By Sunday she seemed to be on the highroad to recovery, but on\r\nthat Sunday night the end came.\r\n\r\nThose last days and hours have been fully described by Sir Charles in\r\nthe memoir prefixed to her posthumous book. All that he has written in\r\nhis own Memoir is this: 'October 23rd, 1904: Emilia died in my arms\r\nafter one of our happiest Sunday afternoons.'\r\n\r\nSo ended the marriage which, contracted under gloomy auspices in 1885,\r\nhad resulted in nineteen years of unbroken felicity. Her praise has been\r\nwritten in love and reverence by her husband, who was her equal comrade.\r\nThe union between them was so complete as to exclude the thought of\r\ngratitude, but whatever man can owe to a woman Sir Charles Dilke owed to\r\nhis wife; and though she died without achieving that end on which she\r\nhad set her heart, of utterly and explicitly cancelling by public assent\r\nall the charges that had been brought against him, yet she had so lived\r\nand so helped him to live that he was heedless of this matter, except\r\nfor her sake.\r\n\r\nOver her grave many hands were stretched out to him. Chamberlain wrote\r\nfrom Italy:\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    \"I have just seen with the deepest sympathy and sorrow the news of\r\n    the terrible loss you have sustained.\r\n\r\n    \"Consolation would be idle in presence of such a blow, but I should\r\n    like you to feel that as an old friend, separated by the unhappy\r\n    political differences of these later years, I still share your\r\n    personal grief in losing a companion so devoted to you, and so well\r\n    qualified to aid and strengthen you in all the work and anxiety of\r\n    your active life.\r\n\r\n    \"When the first great shock is past, I earnestly trust that you may\r\n    find in the continued performance of your public duties some\r\n    alleviation of your private sorrow, and I assure you most earnestly\r\n    of my sympathy in this time of trial.\r\n                                \"Believe me,\r\n                                      \"Yours very truly,\r\n                                             \"J. Chamberlain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morley wrote also:\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    \"I did not hear the news of the unhappy stroke that has befallen you\r\n    until it was a fortnight old. You need not to be told what a shock\r\n    it was. I think that I had known her longer than anybody--from the\r\n    time of a college ball at Oxford in 1859; a radiant creature she\r\n    then was. To me her friendship was unwavering, down to the last time\r\n    I saw her, when she gave me a long and _intime_ talk about the\r\n    things that, as you know, she had most at heart. I am deeply and\r\n    sincerely sorry and full of sympathy with you. Words count little in\r\n    such a disaster, but this I hope you will believe.\r\n                                     \"Ever yours,\r\n                                          \"John Morley.\"\r\n\r\nWhen after his wife's death Sir Charles again took up his life in\r\nLondon, those who saw him off his guard recognized keenly the effect of\r\nthis last sudden blow, heavier because unexpected. The very mainspring\r\nof his life had been weakened. But he exerted himself to prepare Lady\r\nDilke's unpublished writings, and to write the memoir which prefaced\r\nthem. Of this he says:\r\n\r\n    'I put my whole soul into the work of bringing out her posthumous\r\n    book with a proper memoir, and it nearly killed me. I was never so\r\n    pleased with anything as with the success of the book. To hundreds\r\n    of the best people it seems to have meant and said all that I wished\r\n    it to say and mean.'\r\n\r\nProbably, also, to many readers it gave for the first time a true image,\r\nnot of her only for whose sake it was written, but of him who wrote. One\r\nletter of this moment deserves to be put on record. Mr. Arnold-Forster\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\n    \"In a very few days the Session, with all its conflicts, its\r\n    misunderstandings, and its boredom, will be upon us. Before it comes\r\n    let me take advantage of one of the few remaining days of calm to\r\n    write a line to you.\r\n\r\n    \"It is inevitable, and no doubt right, that you and I should find\r\n    ourselves on different sides; we shall probably differ on a good\r\n    many points, and on some we shall very likely express our\r\n    differences. But I trust that nothing in the rough and tumble of\r\n    public work will interrupt the pleasant relations which have so long\r\n    existed between yourself and me, and the existence of which I have\r\n    so greatly valued.\r\n\r\n    \"You have been a good and kind friend to me ever since I entered the\r\n    House, and I have always valued both your friendship and your good\r\n    opinion, when you could give it me. I have known well enough that I\r\n    owed much to Lady Dilke's friendship and affection for my wife; but\r\n    I shall never forget how generously that friendship was extended to\r\n    me. I was very deeply sensible of the privilege of receiving the\r\n    confidence and the good-will of a very noble and wonderfully able\r\n    woman.\r\n\r\n    \"But I must not weary you with too long a letter. All I want to tell\r\n    you is that I cherish the hope that even now that this bond of\r\n    union, this comprehending and reconciling presence, is no longer\r\n    here to keep our tempers wise and sweet, you may still count me\r\n    among your warm friends, and--despite the estrangement of party\r\n    politics--may continue to give me your good-will and may believe in\r\n    the continuance of mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Mr. Balfour fell in the last days of 1905. Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman was entrusted with the formation of a Liberal\r\nGovernment, and the question was at once eagerly asked, in political\r\ncircles, whether Sir Charles Dilke would be a member of it. In February,\r\n1905, he had written to Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice expressing a hope that\r\nhe would be outside the next Government, so as to be free to oppose the\r\ndeal with Russia which in his opinion Sir E. Grey was contemplating.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the Conservative party on the question of his return to\r\nofficial life is sufficiently shown by the fact that he had previously\r\nbeen sounded as to his willingness to accept the chairmanship of the\r\nRoyal Commission on the Poor Law. That the attitude of the Court towards\r\nhim had changed is also clear. Not only was his attendance at Levees\r\napproved, but he and Lady Dilke had received the royal command to the\r\nQueen's Garden Party at Windsor. The attitude of his own party was,\r\nhowever, the determining factor.\r\n\r\nBefore the critical time actually arrived, there had been tentative\r\nconversations, and, although Sir Charles did not expect that any\r\ninvitation would come to him, Mr. Labouchere thought otherwise, and a\r\nletter from him describes conversations which he had held with Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman: \"I thought then from his general observations that\r\nyou would be War Minister.\"\r\n\r\nIn Labouchere's opinion the determining factor was a public\r\ncorrespondence in which Dr. Talbot, then Bishop of Southwark, took the\r\nlead in protesting against any such appointment. But this was probably a\r\nmistaken view. There is no reason to believe that the Liberal leader had\r\nany wish to include Sir Charles in his Ministry. The Cordite vote was\r\nnot forgotten by the members of the Liberal Administration of 1892-1895.\r\nNo office was offered to Sir Charles. His answer to the letter written\r\nby Labouchere on January 6th was:\r\n\r\n    \"I never thought C.-B. could possibly offer me the War Office, and I\r\n    could not have refused it or made conditions for the post, and it\r\n    would have killed me. I did not expect him to offer me any place.\r\n    Had my wife lived, that would have hurt her, and, through her, me.\r\n    As it is, I prefer to be outside--a thing which, though often true,\r\n    no one ever believes of others.\r\n\r\n    \"But when in office--April, 1880, to June, 1885--I was exceptionally\r\n    powerful, and nearly always got my own way in my department. That\r\n    could never have been repeated--a strong reason why I have all along\r\n    preferred the pleasant front seat in the house to a less commanding\r\n    position on the stage.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Haldane's name was announced for the War Office, Mr. Arnold-\r\nForster sent a message agreeing with Sir Charles's high estimate of the\r\nnew War Minister's abilities. \"By far the best appointment they could\r\npossibly make--with the one exception.\" And Mr. T. R. Buchanan,\r\nFinancial Secretary to the War Office, wrote in reply to Sir Charles's\r\ncongratulations:\r\n\r\n    \"I have taken the liberty of showing your letter to Haldane, and he\r\n    desires me to thank you for what you say about him, and he values it\r\n    all the more highly because of your generosity. You would certainly\r\n    have been the natural man to be now in his place, and it is a public\r\n    loss that you are not in it.\"\r\n\r\nAt the election which followed Sir Charles was re-elected by an enormous\r\nmajority for his old constituency, after issuing this, the shortest of\r\nall his habitually short addresses:\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen,--I solicit with confidence the renewal of your trust.\r\n\r\n      \"Believe me, your devoted servant,\r\n        \"Charles W. Dilke.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1905 he had delivered a series of addresses, mainly to\r\naudiences of Labour men, advocating a general co-operation of Radicals\r\nwith the Irish and Labour groups. For Ireland he urged a return to the\r\n\"Parnell-Chamberlain scheme of 1885,\" but applied as a part of Home Rule\r\nall round. His proposal was that the Irish members should in the autumn\r\nsit in Dublin, the Scottish members in Edinburgh, the Welsh in Wales,\r\nand the English at Westminster, and should then transact local affairs,\r\ntheir decisions being ratified or rejected by the United House when it\r\nmet in spring as an Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1905, he wrote to Mr. Deakin:\r\n\r\n    \"The composition of the new Ministry seems to me, as to everybody\r\n    else, good. The Imperial question will slumber, I think, until the\r\n    Irish question has become again acute. The Ministry ought to be able\r\n    to do very well in 1906; two Sessions up to Christmas. In 1907 I\r\n    expect a row with Redmond, in which I shall be more or less on\r\n    Redmond's side. The Liberal party will not face the fact that they\r\n    cannot avoid dealing with the Irish question without the certainty\r\n    of the Irish moderates, of whom Redmond is the most moderate, being\r\n    forced to say: 'We can no longer keep Ireland quiet for you.' The\r\n    Liberal party will not have coercion, and, that being so, they have\r\n    no alternative except to do what they ought to do. It would be wiser\r\n    to do it before they are compelled; and if they did it before\r\n    compulsion was applied, they would have more chance of carrying the\r\n    country with them.\"\r\n\r\nIn a lighter vein he wrote to Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, commenting on the\r\nextraordinary predominance of Scottish members in the Cabinet, on\r\nDecember 15th, 1905:\r\n\r\n    \"I had already, before I received your criticism on the Scotch,\r\n    suggested to Hudson (who is with me) the things that Labouchere is\r\n    likely to say about his friends, and had yesterday got as far as his\r\n    turning round and asking us in a loud whisper: 'Who is it who\r\n    represents _England_ in this Government?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The Cabinet consisted of nineteen persons. Of these, the\r\nPrime Minister (Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman); the Chancellor (Lord\r\nLoreburn); the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Asquith); the Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies (Lord Elgin); the Secretary of State for India\r\n(Lord Morley); the Secretary of State for War (Mr. Haldane); the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty (Lord Tweedmouth); the Chief Secretary for Ireland\r\n(Mr. Bryce); the Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Sinclair)--nine in\r\nall--were Scottish Peers or represented Scottish constituencies. It was\r\nalso observed that Sir Edward Grey's constituency was the Scottish\r\nBorderland; and it was jestingly said that John Burns was put into the\r\nCabinet because he had persuaded the Premier that he descended from the\r\npoet!\r\n\r\nMr. Birrell, when the Government was formed, was not in Parliament, but\r\nhis last constituency had been Scotch, The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\r\nwas Lord Aberdeen.]\r\n\r\n    \"We used to think that the value of Randolph was that he gave to\r\n    politics the constant pleasure of the unexpected. Rosebery now does\r\n    this in the Lords, and Charles II.'s truthful saying about the House\r\n    of Commons, 'It is as good as a play,' becomes on account of\r\n    Rosebery temporarily true of the House of Lords. We shall all of us\r\n    be drawn there very often, and even such a House of Commons man as\r\n    your humble servant, grumbling the while, will nevertheless find\r\n    himself attracted to that 'throne.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the new Parliament met in 1906, Labour had for the first time a\r\nreally important representation. [Footnote: See Chapter LII., \"Labour,\"\r\np. 346.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles noted in his Diary: 'The Labour party was my original scheme\r\nfor the I.L.P. as developed in talks at Pyrford, before its formation,\r\nwith Champion and with Ben Tillett. To join it or lead it was never my\r\nthought.'\r\n\r\nHis purpose was rather to be a connecting link between the varying\r\ngroups in the development of a legislative programme which he forecast\r\nwith shrewd prevision. On January 6th, 1906, he wrote to Labouchere:\r\n\r\n    \"As I now seem to have the confidence of Balfour, Redmond, and Keir\r\n    Hardie, the position will be difficult; but in the present year\r\n    Redmond and Keir Hardie will, I think, join with me in supporting\r\n    Government. Next year it will be different, unless, as I expect,\r\n    Grey goes for H.R. The small Budget of 1906 will be a\r\n    disappointment, and so, I fear, will be the big one of 1907.\r\n\r\n    \"The really weak point is that the Government is damned unless it\r\n    fights the Lords in 1907, and that the promise of 'five years in\r\n    power' will prevent the hacks from fighting.\"\r\n\r\nHolding these views, it was natural that he should seek to maintain that\r\norganization of a Radical group which had existed continuously since\r\nFawcett established, or rather revived, it on first entering the\r\nParliament of 1865-1868. The Radical Club, of which Sir Charles himself\r\nwas the first secretary, grew out of this, and was largely directed by\r\nhim till 1880, when he ceased, on taking office, to be a member.\r\n[Footnote: For earlier mention of the Radical Club, see Vol. I., Chapter\r\nVIII., p. 100.] His brother succeeded him in the secretaryship; but with\r\nAshton Dilke's death the club died also, being replaced by a loose\r\ncommittee organization which lasted till 1893, and then came to an\r\nuntimely end because the party Whips attempted to pack the meeting which\r\nelected this committee. The elected body was then replaced by a\r\nvirtually self-chosen group. In 1904 an emergency committee of this\r\ngroup was appointed; and when the new Parliament met, Sir Charles was\r\nthe only member of the committee left. Mr. Harcourt and Captain Norton\r\nhad taken office, Mr. Stanhope had gone to the Lords, Mr. Labouchere had\r\nretired. It therefore fell to Sir Charles to reassemble surviving atoms\r\nof this organism, to attract new ones, and to make known its nature and\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt had always been essential, in his view, that there should be no\r\n\"party,\" no chairman, and no whips; but simply a grouping for the\r\npurpose of stimulating the Government by pressure as to practical and\r\nimmediate Parliamentary objects on which advanced men think alike or\r\nharmoniously, and for current arrangements, such as balloting for\r\nmotions and generally making the best use of private members' time.\r\n\r\nThere was at the outset a great influx of members, and three secretaries\r\nwere appointed. At all meetings at which he was present Sir Charles took\r\nthe chair, and through this centre exercised much influence, committing\r\nthe House of Commons to a series of resolutions--abstract indeed, but\r\nnone the less important.\r\n\r\nThe various objects which Radicalism should have before it in 1906 are\r\nsketched in a kind of shorthand summary:\r\n\r\n    \"Good understanding with Irish Nationalist members, based on at\r\n    least the Parnell-Chamberlain National Council scheme of 1885, and\r\n    with the Labour party for common objects.\r\n\r\n    \"So far as further political reforms are needed no registration\r\n    reform worth having, but principle of adult suffrage of all grown\r\n    men and women carries simplification and single vote.\r\n\r\n    \"Payment of members and expenses.\r\n\r\n    \"Single Chamber, or restriction of power of House of Lords (i.e., no\r\n    'Reform' of = stronger). [Footnote: Sir Charles always maintained\r\n    that \"Reform\" of the House of Lords would result in strengthening\r\n    its position.]\r\n\r\n    \"Fiscal reform, capable of being dealt with by Budget or\r\n    administratively, and money to be saved by ... increased revenue\r\n    provided by increased graduation of death duties and by relieving\r\n    the Imperial Exchequer of the local grants, substituting taxation of\r\n    land values by the local authorities for the latter.\r\n\r\n    \"This last point is closely connected with full power to local\r\n    authorities to acquire land for all purposes, and this with\r\n    municipal trading and other forms of municipal Socialism. The heads\r\n    of the Labour policy are now so universally embraced as not to be\r\n    specially Radical; Taff Vale, for example, being supported by all\r\n    Liberals and some Tories, and the Miners' Eight Hours receiving the\r\n    support of nearly all Liberals and of some Tories.\"\r\n\r\nOn the question of electoral reform, and specially of woman's suffrage,\r\nall his action was guided by one conclusion thus expressed, and embodied\r\nin the Franchise Bill introduced by him each Session:\r\n\r\n    \"The limited franchise, if it is ever carried, will be carried as a\r\n    party Conservative measure intended to aid Conservative opinions and\r\n    to rest the franchise upon an unassailable limited base, and it will\r\n    be carried in that case against the counter-proposal of the suffrage\r\n    of all grown men and women, made by those representing the advanced\r\n    thought of the country.\" [Footnote: Memorandum by Sir Charles Dilke\r\n    on \"Suffrage of All Grown Men and Women,\" issued by the People's\r\n    Suffrage Federation.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to emphasize the completeness with which political\r\nevolution has followed the lines here marked out by him. Others reaped\r\nthe harvest. But no man then living had done more to sow the seed.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament in which he found himself was one of singular interest.\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"The old form of party divisions is, in the great majority of\r\n    constituencies, not yet much affected by recent events. In the House\r\n    of Commons it is almost dead for the present year....\r\n\r\n    \"The future cannot be foreseen, and in politics it is always foolish\r\n    to attempt to prophesy. I have frequently myself made or quoted the\r\n    remark that in politics a year is equivalent to eternity. I have now\r\n    limited myself to 1906. Whether the party system, in which British\r\n    statesmen of our time and of past generations have been nurtured,\r\n    will ever be restored is another matter. Whether the birth of a\r\n    definite Labour party, in addition to a definite Irish Nationalist\r\n    party, will be followed by any further division, or whether, as I\r\n    expect, it will not, yet the division into four parties--of which\r\n    three will compete actively for the favour of the British\r\n    electorate--will, I think, continue, and we follow here the line of\r\n    political development in which first the Australian Colonies, and\r\n    now the Commonwealth, have led the way.\" [Footnote: _Potentia_,\r\n    1906.]\r\n\r\nWriting in the _Financial Review of Reviews_ for April, 1906, he spoke\r\nof the \"extraordinarily interesting nature of the debates,\" of which\r\nexample had already been given, and he foreshadowed no less interesting\r\naction. The changes which he had in view, mainly financial, were \"not\r\nlikely to be popular in the City, with solicitors, with the organized\r\nrepresentatives of the employing class,\" but none the less they would\r\nprobably be carried into law. The old assumption that democratic\r\nmovements would be carried into legislation \"by capitalist members\r\nsteeped in Radical pledges\" had ceased to correspond with the facts. A\r\nnew type of member of Parliament had appeared, and Sir Charles welcomed\r\nthe change.\r\n\r\n    \"It is possible that the members are more Radical than the\r\n    constituencies. This is an arguable question; but that they are\r\n    convinced upon such questions, not by pressure, but by training and\r\n    by thought, is a conclusion which no one who knows the present House\r\n    of Commons can resist.\r\n\r\n    \"There has probably never sat so interesting a House of Commons in\r\n    the history of this country. With a good deal of experience of\r\n    Parliaments and of their inner life and thought, and with the\r\n    opportunity of frequent discussion with those who, like Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, remembered all the Parliaments back to the early\r\n    thirties, and those, like Mr. Vernon Harcourt, [Footnote: George\r\n    Granville Vernon Harcourt, elected to the House of Commons as member\r\n    for Oxford in 1831. He held his seat till 1859.] who remembered much\r\n    earlier Parliaments, I am certain that there has never met at\r\n    Westminster an assembly so able and at the same time so widely\r\n    different in intellectual composition from its predecessors as that\r\n    which is now there gathered. The development of opinion, however, is\r\n    less of a surprise to those who have watched Australia and New\r\n    Zealand than to those who have confined their studies to the United\r\n    Kingdom and the Continent.\" [Footnote: In 1911, when Lord Hugh Cecil\r\n    described with violent rhetoric the alleged degradation of the House\r\n    of Commons, Mr. Balfour was moved to protest, and cited in support\r\n    of his own view \"a man whose authority had always been admitted.\" \"I\r\n    remember,\" he said, \"talking over with Sir Charles Dilke the\r\n    question of general Parliamentary practice, and he said, and I\r\n    agree, that there has been no deterioration either in his or in my\r\n    Parliamentary experience.\"]\r\n\r\nPayment of members he did not live to see, but he always regarded it as\r\n\"an extraordinary anomaly that payment should have been discontinued in\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Members are paid in every other country in the world, and in every\r\n    British colony (I believe without exception). Non-payment means\r\n    deliberate preference for moneyed oligarchy, as only rare exceptions\r\n    can produce a democratic member under such a system. It excludes all\r\n    poor men of genius unless they can get themselves paid by parties\r\n    like the Irish, which makes them slaves. It throws undue power into\r\n    the hands of the capital as the seat of the legislature, and it\r\n    leads to poor members selling their souls to rotten compromises.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the advance of age and a growing weakness of the heart, the\r\nimpression which he produced was always one of commanding vigour. His\r\nhabit of fencing kept him alert and supple in all his movements.\r\nNotwithstanding his elaborate preparation for the work, no man's\r\nappearances in debate were less premeditated; he spoke when he felt\r\ninclined: had he spoken for effect, his interpositions would have been\r\nmuch less frequent. But when tactics required it, no man was more\r\nwilling to efface himself. Especially was this so in all his relations\r\nwith Labour; when he could leave to the Labour party the credit of\r\nmoving an important amendment, he gladly left it to them. Yet when he\r\nwas more likely than they to secure Liberal support, he was prepared to\r\nmove against the Government, and in one notable amendment on the Trade\r\nDisputes Bill brought down their vast majority to the bare figure of\r\nfive. [Footnote: For a fuller account of Sir Charles's work connected\r\nwith the Taff Vale Decision and the Trade Disputes Act, see \"Labour,\"\r\nChapter LII, pp. 345 and 365.]\r\n\r\nThe work which in these last years cost him most labour--in view of his\r\nfailing health, it would have been well for his friends had he never\r\nundertaken it--was that given to the Committee on the Income Tax, of\r\nwhich he became chairman in 1906. Sir Bernard Mallet (now Registrar-\r\nGeneral) writes in 1916:\r\n\r\n    \"In the spring of 1906 the Government decided to appoint a strong\r\n    Committee to inquire into the questions of graduation and\r\n    differentiation of the income tax, which had for some Sessions been\r\n    coming into prominence in consequence of the financial difficulties\r\n    caused by the South African War. Mr. Asquith, then Chancellor of the\r\n    Exchequer, offered the chairmanship to Sir Charles Dilke, who had\r\n    never claimed to be an expert in finance, and only accepted it after\r\n    strong pressure, and the Select Committee set to work accordingly\r\n    early in May. Having taken up the work, which occupied most of the\r\n    summer, Sir Charles threw himself into it with immense energy. He\r\n    familiarized himself with all the literature bearing on the\r\n    question, and he made a point of calling, as witnesses, not only the\r\n    usual officials, but also as many outside economists and\r\n    statisticians as might be able to throw light upon questions which,\r\n    as he rightly conceived, lay at the root of any proper consideration\r\n    of the problem before the Committee. He attached special importance\r\n    to all the evidence bearing upon foreign and colonial methods and\r\n    principles in the taxation of income and property, and to the\r\n    endeavour he made to get at statistics bearing on the distribution\r\n    of income--two vitally important factors introduced by him, for the\r\n    first time, into any official handling of the subject.\r\n\r\n    \"But the result of all the knowledge, thoroughness, and enthusiasm,\r\n    which, as his friends could testify, he lavished without stint (and,\r\n    it is to be feared, to the serious detriment of his health) upon the\r\n    work, must have somewhat disappointed him. Sir Charles's attempts to\r\n    deal with the matter in a comprehensive spirit and produce a report\r\n    which would rival in interest the famous reports of two previous\r\n    Select Committees on the subject, those of 1851 and 1861, were\r\n    hampered by the necessity, under which the Committee lay, of\r\n    devising a means to increase the yield of the income tax with the\r\n    least political friction. The two expedients which came most\r\n    prominently before the Committee were those of differentiating the\r\n    rate of the income tax in favour of earned or precarious incomes,\r\n    and of imposing a supertax upon the larger incomes. Both of these\r\n    were included in the recommendations of the report which was\r\n    ultimately adopted, [Footnote: Report of the Select Committee on\r\n    Income Tax, II. of C. 365 of 1906.] and carried into effect in the\r\n    Budgets of 1907 and 1909 respectively. [Footnote: See _British\r\n    Budgets_, by Bernard Mallet (1913), pp. 262, 263, 274, 277-281, and\r\n    305, where also some comments on the recommendations of the\r\n    Committee are to be found.] Sir Charles's own view was opposed to\r\n    both these methods. He would have preferred to differentiation, even\r\n    in the limited form (up to £2,000 a year) in which it became law,\r\n    the method of separate taxation of property, or income from\r\n    property, as in Prussia and Holland, if death duties were not\r\n    considered as sufficient taxation upon property.\r\n\r\n    \"He was certainly impressed by the unscientific character of the\r\n    proposed differentiation; by the difficulty of distinguishing\r\n    between 'earned' and 'unearned' incomes, and by the possibilities of\r\n    abuse which this method of dealing with the question offered.\r\n    Supertax he would have reserved for a national emergency, but it\r\n    should not be supposed that his opposition to it implied opposition\r\n    to graduation either in principle or in practice. He was, indeed,\r\n    strongly in favour of a graduated income tax, but, in his judgment,\r\n    a supertax was a somewhat clumsy way of effecting the purpose aimed\r\n    at. In his opinion the universal declaration of all taxable incomes\r\n    was an indispensable preliminary to the full and just graduation of\r\n    the income tax, and written notes of his are in existence showing\r\n    how much importance he attached to this point.\r\n\r\n    \"Holding these views, he could not produce a report sufficiently\r\n    decisive in its acceptance of the methods favoured by the majority\r\n    of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n    \"The stupendous increases which have taken place in the rates of the\r\n    income tax owing to the present war, increases far surpassing\r\n    anything contemplated by the Committee over which Sir Charles\r\n    presided ten years ago, have thrown all such controversies as these\r\n    into the shade; but apart from the practical results of its\r\n    recommendations, which for good or ill left at the time a very\r\n    decided mark on fiscal legislation, this investigation succeeded,\r\n    owing mainly to his influence, in eliciting a quantity of evidence\r\n    which will always make it of historical interest to students of\r\n    taxation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS: 1890 TO 1910\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before his return, in July, 1892, to Parliament, Sir Charles Dilke\r\nwas still a powerful critic of the country's foreign policy. It is a\r\ncurious commentary on the wisdom of those who believe that, except at\r\nmoments of special excitement or of public danger, it is impossible to\r\ninterest the electorate in foreign affairs, that during this period he\r\nwas constantly able to gather large public audiences in the North of\r\nEngland and in Wales, and induce them to listen to careful criticisms on\r\nquestions such as the delimitation of the African continent, the\r\nNewfoundland fisheries, British policy in the Pacific, and the future of\r\nthe Congo State. This was achieved, although no party appeal could be\r\nmade or was attempted, and although there was a deliberate effort by an\r\ninfluential section of the London Press to boycott the speaker. In these\r\nspeeches Sir Charles pointed out that a perhaps too general acquiescence\r\nexisted on the part of most Liberals in the foreign policy of the\r\nGovernment, merely because Lord Salisbury had made no attempt to\r\ncontinue or to revive the pro-Turkish and warlike policy which had\r\ndistinguished the Government of Lord Beaconsfield in 1878. Lord\r\nSalisbury was now mainly intent on settling outstanding questions with\r\nFrance and Germany, especially in Africa, dealing with them one by one.\r\nThe ordinary Conservative partisan still said in public that nothing\r\ncould be worse than the foreign policy and practice of the Liberal\r\nparty; but he was also saying in private that the policy of his own\r\nparty was little better, that the army both at home and in India was\r\nneglected, and that the fleet was probably insufficient. Dread, however,\r\nof Mr. Gladstone and of the possible return of the Liberal party to\r\npower, made him with rare exceptions silent in Parliament; while, on the\r\nother hand, the mass of the Liberal party had become supporters of Lord\r\nSalisbury's foreign and colonial policy. \"The fact that Lord Salisbury\r\nhad not been an active Turk or an active Jingo had proved enough to\r\ncover everything.\" [Footnote: \"The Conservative Foreign Policy,\"\r\n_Fortnightly Review_, January, 1892, by Sir Charles Dilke.] But the\r\nabsence of any well-sustained criticism in Parliament had evident\r\ndisadvantages, and Sir Charles's speeches at this time supplied the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nThe political fortunes of France between 1887 and 1895 were at a low\r\nebb. The financial scandals which led to the resignation of President\r\nGrevy in 1887, the serio-comic political career of General Boulanger,\r\ndangerous and constant labour disturbances in the great centres of\r\nindustry, the Panama financial scandals of 1893, the assassination of\r\nPresident Carnot in 1894, and the impossibility of forming stable\r\nMinistries, caused a general lack of confidence in the future of the\r\nRepublic both at home and abroad, which the facile glories of the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1889 could not conceal. The foreign policy of the country\r\nseemed to consist in a system of \"pin-pricks\" directed against Great\r\nBritain, and in hostility to Italy, which culminated in anti-Italian\r\nriots in the South of France, a tariff war, and the entry of Italy into\r\nthe alliance of the Central Powers. The letters of Sir Charles during\r\nthis period are full of expressions of despair at the condition of\r\nFrench politics and at the general lack of statesmanship. The suspicion\r\nwhich he entertained of Russian intentions caused him also to look\r\naskance at the newly formed friendship of France with Russia, which,\r\ncommencing with the visit of a French naval squadron under Admiral\r\nGervais to Cronstadt in August, 1891, was finally sealed by a treaty of\r\nalliance signed in March, 1895, though the precise terms were not known.\r\n[Footnote: In a letter to M. Joseph Reinach written after the appearance\r\nof _The Present Position of European Politics_, Sir Charles says: \"I did\r\n_not_ say Gambetta had been a great friend to the Poles. I said he hated\r\nthe Russians. He told me so over and over again. He held the same view\r\nas Napoleon I. as to Russia, and said, 'J'irais chercher mes alliances\r\nn'importe oui--meme a Berlin,' and, 'La Russie me tire le pan de\r\nl'habit, mais jamais je n'ecouterais ce qu'on me fait dire.' But, in\r\nsearching for my own reasons for this in the first article, I said that\r\nas a law student he had been brought up with a generation which had had\r\nPolish sympathies, and that perhaps this had caused (unconsciously, I\r\nmeant) his anti-Russian views. I know he did not believe in setting up a\r\nPoland.\"]\r\n\r\nIn Germany the position was different. The Dual Alliance devised by\r\nPrince Bismarck between Germany and Austria-Hungary had become the\r\nTriple Alliance by the accession of Italy, and had been further\r\nstrengthened by an assurance of naval support given to Italy by Lord\r\nSalisbury in the event of the _status quo_ in the Mediterranean being\r\ndisturbed. The presumable disturber aimed at was evidently France.\r\n[Footnote: \"In 1903 Lord Lansdowne explained that in February, 1887,\r\nthere had been that exchange of notes between Italy and ourselves of\r\nwhich I had written in that year. In _The Present Position of European\r\nPolitics_ I made allusion to Disraeli's proposal, before his defeat in\r\n1880, of a league of the Powers for the defence of the _status quo_ in\r\nthe Mediterranean. The notes of February, 1887, nominally dealt only\r\nwith the Mediterranean _status quo_ desired in common, it was said, by\r\nItaly and Great Britain. Cynics might be tempted to ask whether all\r\nItalian Ministers desired the maintenance of a _status quo_ in a\r\n'Mediterranean' which included the coast of Tunis, the coast of Tripoli,\r\nand even, Lord Lansdowne added, the Adriatic.\" (Sir Charles Dilke in the\r\n_English Review_, October, 1909: \"On the Relations of the Powers.\") On\r\nthis subject see _Crispi Memoirs_, vol. ii., chap. v.] The meddlesome\r\nintrigues of Russian partisans, and a long series of political outrages\r\nculminating in the murder of M. Stambouloff, were gradually forming an\r\nAustro-German party in Bulgaria; while the wise and progressive\r\nadministration of Bosnia and the Herzegovina by Herr von Kallay had\r\nencouraged a belief that some good thing might even yet come out of\r\nAustria, notwithstanding the famous expression of a belief to the\r\ncontrary by Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances Lord Salisbury determined to base his policy on a\r\ngood understanding with Germany, and he had his reward. The African\r\nsettlement of 1890 was a comprehensive scheme which undoubtedly made\r\ngreat concessions to German wishes, but, taken in connection with\r\nsubsequent enlargements and additions, it was hoped that it had at least\r\nremoved any real danger of collision between the two Powers principally\r\nconcerned. A treaty with France, recognizing a French protectorate over\r\nMadagascar, was defended by its authors as the complement of the\r\narrangements of 1890, as to Zanzibar, with Germany. Subsequent treaties\r\nwith Portugal and Italy made the period decisive as to the future\r\ndivision of the African continent. Both in Great Britain and Germany the\r\narrangements of 1890 were attacked as having yielded too much to the\r\nother side. But looking at the treaty from an English point of view, Sir\r\nCharles said there had been too many graceful \"concessions\" all round,\r\nand of these he made himself the critic. He did not, however, identify\r\nhimself with the extreme school of so-called \"Imperial\" thought, which\r\nseemed to consider that in some unexplained manner Great Britain had\r\nacquired a prior lien on the whole unoccupied portion of the vast\r\nAfrican continent.\r\n\r\nBut in the treaty of 1890 there was one clause--the last--which stood\r\nout by itself in conspicuous isolation, and this Sir Charles never\r\nceased to attack and denounce. It decreed the transfer of Heligoland to\r\nGermany. The importance of the acquisition was not fully appreciated at\r\nthe time even in Germany. What the surrender might some day mean was not\r\nunderstood in Great Britain. On both sides the tendency was to belittle\r\nthe transaction. [Footnote: Reventlow, 38-51. _Hohenlohe Memoirs_, ii.\r\n470-471.] Apart from some minor interests possessed by British\r\nfishermen, Lord Salisbury described the value of the island as mainly\r\n\"sentimental,\" in the speech in which on July 10th he defended the\r\ntransaction in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nHe supported the proposal by arguing that the island was unfortified,\r\nthat it was within a few hours' steam of the greatest arsenal of\r\nGermany, that if the island remained in our possession an expedition\r\nwould be despatched to capture it on \"the day of the declaration of war,\r\nand would arrive considerably before any relieving force could arrive\r\nfrom our side.\" \"It would expose us to a blow which would be a\r\nconsiderable humiliation.\" \"If we were at war with any other Power it\r\nwould be necessary for us to lock up a naval force for the purpose of\r\ndefending this island, unless we intended to expose ourselves to the\r\nhumiliation of having it taken.\" This argument, Sir Charles Dilke showed\r\nby a powerful criticism of the whole treaty in the columns of the\r\n_Melbourne Argus_, went a great deal too far. It could be used for the\r\npurpose of defending the cession of the Channel Islands to France. \"The\r\nChannel Islands lie close to a French stronghold, Cherbourg, and not\r\nvery far from the greatest of French arsenals, at Brest. They are\r\nfortified and garrisoned, but they are feebly garrisoned, and they have\r\nnot been refortified in recent times, and could not be held without\r\nnaval assistance, and the argument about locking up our fleet applies in\r\nthe case of the Channel Islands, and in the case of many other of our\r\nstations abroad, as it was said to apply in the case of Heligoland.\"\r\n[Footnote: _Melbourne Argus_, September 10th, 1890. As to Heligoland,\r\nsee _Life of Granville_, ii, 362, 363, 425; Holland Rose, _Origins of\r\nthe War_, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury went on to point out that we had obtained a consideration\r\nfor the transfer of Heligoland to Germany \"on the east coast of Africa,\"\r\na consideration which consisted mainly in an undertaking from Germany\r\nthat she would not oppose our assumption of the protectorate of\r\nZanzibar. But, said Sir Charles, the protectorate, when it included not\r\nonly the island of Zanzibar, but the strip of coast now forming the\r\nmaritime fringe both of British and of German East Africa, had been over\r\nand over again refused by us. \"I was one of those,\" Sir Charles\r\ncontinued, referring to a still earlier chapter of Lord Salisbury's\r\npolicy during the short-lived Government of 1885-86, \"who thought that\r\nthe policy of 1885 with regard to Zanzibar was a mistaken policy, and\r\nthat we should have insisted on supporting our East Indian subjects, who\r\nhad and have the trade on that coast and island in their hands. We had\r\njoined with France in arrangements with regard to the whole Zanzibar\r\ncoast, and when we concluded an agreement with Germany about that coast\r\nit became necessary for us to force that agreement upon the French on\r\nbehalf of Germany. A most mistaken policy, in my opinion, as we should\r\notherwise have had the support of France in resisting a German\r\noccupation of any portion of the coast, an occupation which it is safe\r\nto say would not have been attempted in face of a distinct statement on\r\nour part.\"\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury expressed his inability to understand on what ground\r\nthose interested in South Africa objected to our recognizing an\r\nimaginary German right over a strip of territory giving the Germans\r\naccess to the upper waters of the Zambesi. He said that our chief\r\ndifficulty about this territory was that we knew nothing about it; but\r\nthis consideration, Sir Charles said, \"told against the agreement,\r\ninasmuch as we had given up a territory which seemed naturally to go\r\nwith those which have been assigned to the South Africa Company, and\r\nwhich might, for anything we knew to the contrary, be of high value in\r\nthe future.\" It was amazing to note how obediently the great majority of\r\nthe Conservative party followed Lord Salisbury's lead in accepting the\r\ncession of Heligoland for no consideration at all, as Sir Charles\r\nthought--in any case, for a consideration which must seem inadequate.\r\nContrast, he said, the grounds upon which the cession of Heligoland was\r\ndefended with those, welcomed by shouts of triumph from the\r\nConservatives, upon which the occupation of Cyprus was justified. It was\r\ninconceivable that any man possessed of reasoning powers could support\r\nholding Cyprus (which must be a weakness in time of war), and yet argue\r\nthat Heligoland must be a weakness of a similar kind, and therefore had\r\nbetter be ceded. In the case of Heligoland the vast majority of the\r\nislanders were opposed to union with Germany. In the case of Cyprus the\r\nvast majority of the islanders were hostile to our rule, while the\r\nmajority of Heligolanders were favourable to our rule. To cede it\r\nagainst the wish of the population was a step which should not be taken,\r\nexcept for overwhelming national advantage, and that advantage most\r\ncertainly could not be shown.\r\n\r\n\"I am one of those,\" Dilke wrote, summarizing the argument of his\r\nspeeches, \"who are sometimes thought by my own party to be somewhat\r\nunduly friendly to the foreign policy of our opponents, a fact which I\r\nmention only to show that I do not come to the present matter with\r\nstrong prejudice. I had heard during the negotiations in Berlin, and\r\nsome weeks before the publication of the agreement, the whole of its\r\ncontents with the exception of the cession of Heligoland, and I had\r\nformed a strong opinion upon the facts then known to me--that it was a\r\nthoroughly bad agreement, most unfavourable to British interests. The\r\nonly change since that time has been that Heligoland has been thrown in,\r\nso that to my mind we are ceding that British possession, for which a\r\nvery high value might have been obtained, against the wish of the\r\ninhabitants, and ceding it for less than no consideration. Lord\r\nSalisbury seems to be subject to strange dimness of vision when Africa\r\nis concerned. He positively claimed it as a merit, in the course of his\r\nspeech to the South African deputation, that while the Germans demanded\r\nan enormous slice of our Bechuanaland sphere of influence, he had\r\ninduced them to put back their frontier; but I need hardly point out\r\nthat no German traveller had ever entered the country in dispute, that\r\nwe had for years acted on the assumption that it was within our sphere,\r\nand that the Germans might as reasonably have set up a claim to the\r\nwhole sphere of influence and to all the territories previously assigned\r\nby us to the British South Africa Company....\"\r\n\r\nIn South-East Africa, too, it was to be remembered that we were dealing\r\nwith a country which is far less populated by natives and more open to\r\nEuropean settlement than was the case with Central Africa. [Footnote:\r\nSee supra, p. 84, as to the differences which had arisen in Mr.\r\nGladstone's Cabinet on this subject in 1884-85.]\r\n\r\n\"There has been in the whole matter,\" he declared, \"a deplorable absence\r\nof decision. If, when Lord Salisbury came into power in 1885,\r\nimmediately after the occupation by Germany of a slice of South Africa\r\nand of the Cameroons, and at the moment of German activity at Zanzibar,\r\nhe had let it be clearly understood that we should support the policy of\r\nSir John Kirk, our Consul, and the Zanzibar Sultan's rule, and had at\r\nthe same time abstained from taking steps to facilitate the operations\r\nof the Germans in Damaraland, we certainly should have occupied at the\r\npresent moment a stronger position than we do. But, instead of this,\r\nLord Salisbury allowed our Indian subjects established along the coast\r\nto be ruined by German bombardments to which the British fleet was sent\r\nto give some sort of moral support. Our explorers have carried the\r\nBritish flag throughout what is now German East Africa and the Congo\r\nState. They had made treaties by which the leading native sovereigns of\r\nthese countries had submitted to our rule, and the Germans are too\r\nanxious for our countenance in Europe to have been willing to have\r\nrisked the loss of Lord Salisbury's friendship had he taken a very\r\ndifferent line.\" [Footnote: _Melbourne Argus_, September 6th, 1890.]\r\n\r\nThough not professing to be himself an \"African,\" Sir Charles also asked\r\nhow those who professed to come within that description, and speak as\r\nadvocates of an Imperial policy in the vast and undeveloped regions of\r\nthe Dark Continent, could quietly accept, as they seemed prepared to do,\r\nthe break in the so-called Cape to Cairo route which had been allowed to\r\nform part of the great agreement of 1890.\r\n\r\n\"What, then,\" he asked in 1902, \"have the Tories done with the free hand\r\nthat has been given them? Above all, they have 'made up to' Germany, and\r\nthis apparently for no definite object and with no definite result. They\r\nhave given to Germany as far as they could give; they have certainly\r\nhelped her to procure the renewal of the Triple Alliance, by inducing\r\nsanguine Italians to believe that the British fleet will protect them\r\nagainst France, though as a fact we all know that the House of Commons\r\nwill not allow a British fleet to do anything of the kind. France has\r\nwholly given up the Temporal Power, and would not have threatened Italy\r\nhad Italy held aloof from the Triple Alliance; and, in spite of a recent\r\nspeech by the Minister of Austria-Hungary which was intended to 'pay\r\nout' Italy for her talks with Russia, it is not Austria that would have\r\nraised the question. Our Government have given Germany, so far as they\r\ncould give, a vast tract in Africa in which British subjects had traded,\r\nbut in most of which no German had ever been. They have also given\r\nGermany Heligoland, which they might have sold dear, and which, if Mr.\r\nGladstone had given, they would have destroyed him for giving.... All\r\nthis for what? What have we gained by it?\" [Footnote: _Fortnightly\r\nReview_, January, 1902.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of Lord Rosebery and Lord Kimberley from 1892 to 1895\r\nresembled that of Lord Salisbury in so far as it aimed at the settlement\r\nof outstanding questions with Germany and France. The apprehensions of\r\ntrouble with France were still serious, because a constant succession of\r\nshort Ministries at Paris made any permanent agreement difficult if not\r\nimpossible. The few Foreign Ministers who were occasionally able to keep\r\ntheir place for any length of time at the Quai d'Orsay were also\r\ngenerally those who as a rule were indifferent, if not actually hostile,\r\nto friendship with this country, such as the Duc Decazes in the early\r\ndays of the Republic, and M. Hanotaux at a later period, who, however,\r\nwas quite ready to invite Great Britain to join in reckless adventures.\r\n[Footnote: Sir Charles notes in November, 1896, that Mr. Morley reported\r\nthat 'Hanotaux had told him that he could not understand why England had\r\nrefused to join in a France, Russia, and England partition of China.\r\n\"China is a dead man in the house who stinks.\"'] Towards France Lord\r\nRosebery's Government twice took up a firm stand: first in regard to her\r\naggressive action in Siam; and secondly by the clear warning, given\r\nthrough Sir Edward Grey in the House of Commons, that if the expedition\r\nof Major Marchand, which was known to be crossing Africa from west to\r\neast, reached the Nile Valley, as it eventually did at Fashoda, British\r\ninterests would be held to be affected. The gravity of this warning was\r\nat the moment very inadequately comprehended by the House and by the\r\ncountry, notwithstanding the repeated attempts of Sir Charles to\r\nreinforce it before rather unconvinced audiences.\r\n\r\nA firm attitude towards France was greatly facilitated through the\r\nfriendly position adopted towards Great Britain by Count Caprivi (the\r\nsuccessor in 1890 of Prince Bismarck in the Chancellorship of the German\r\nEmpire) and his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baron Marschall. This\r\nperiod indicates the high-water mark of friendly relations between\r\nGermany and Great Britain; and though Count Caprivi retired in 1894,\r\nwhen he was succeeded by Prince Hohenlohe, who had special ties with\r\nRussia, these friendly relations may be said to have been prolonged, so\r\nfar as the official relations of the two Governments were concerned,\r\nthough with ever-diminishing vitality, up to the retirement of Baron\r\nMarschall from the Foreign Office in 1897. [Footnote: See the\r\nobservations of Reventlow, 115-118, and Büllow, _Imperial Germany_, 31,\r\n34.] In this period German commercial policy took a strong turn towards\r\nfreer trade, to the great wrath of the feudal and military parties in\r\nPrussia, who were the centre of the forces hostile to a good\r\nunderstanding with Great Britain. The secret treaty also which Bismarck\r\nhad negotiated with Russia, behind the back of his allies, was allowed\r\nto lapse, and a more conciliatory attitude was adopted towards the\r\nPoles, which gratified Liberal opinion, especially in this country. But\r\neven in the time of Baron Marschall there were evidences of the\r\nexistence in Germany of currents of opinion of a less friendly\r\ncharacter, which were able from time to time to assert themselves in\r\nAfrican affairs. As Sir Charles Dilke pointed out, Germany had joined\r\nwith France in 1894 in objecting to, and thereby nullifying, the Congo\r\nTreaty of that year with Belgium; and some of the territories which had\r\nbeen handed over to Germany in the neighbourhood of the Cameroons in\r\n1893, with the express object, apparently, of barring a French advance\r\nin that region, had been handed over by Germany to France by another\r\ntreaty in 1895. [Footnote: Reventlow, pp. 52, 53, admits this. For the\r\ntreaties themselves, see Hertslet, _The Map of Africa by Treaty_, ii.\r\n658, in. 999, 1008.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the period from 1892 to 1895 a Liberal Ministry was in\r\noffice, but hardly in power. For the next ten years a strong Tory\r\nAdministration possessing unfettered freedom of action was in real\r\npower, with an Opposition weakened by internal dissension. It was not\r\nunnatural that, under such discouraging conditions as to home affairs,\r\nSir Charles should have again devoted most of his time to foreign\r\nquestions and army reform.\r\n\r\n\"I recognize,\" Mr. Balfour wrote to him, in regard to some arrangements\r\nas to the business of the House, \"that no man in the House speaks with\r\ngreater authority or knowledge on foreign affairs than yourself, and\r\nthat no man has a better right to ask for opportunities for criticizing\r\nthe course in respect of foreign affairs adopted by this or any other\r\nGovernment.\" [Footnote: March 31st, 1897.]\r\n\r\nThis recognition was general, so much so that what he spoke or wrote on\r\nforeign affairs was constantly translated, reproduced verbatim and\r\ncommented upon in foreign newspapers--a distinction enjoyed as a rule\r\nonly by official speakers, and not always by them; while original\r\ncontributions from his pen were eagerly sought for not only at home, but\r\nabroad, especially in France and in the colonies, \"Il a pesé constamment\r\nsur l'opinion française,\" the _Figaro_ wrote at the time of his death;\r\nand his known friendship for France and everything French made plain-\r\nspeaking at times possible without exciting resentment. Even those--and\r\nthere were many in England--who disagreed with his criticisms of the\r\ndetails of Lord Salisbury's policy, felt the comprehensive grasp of his\r\nfacts, and the vast store of knowledge on which he drew; and the members\r\nof his own party, many of whom did not altogether go with him, or\r\nsometimes, perhaps, quite grasp his standpoint, nevertheless enjoyed,\r\nespecially while their own oracles were dumb, the sound of the heavy\r\nguns which, after his return to Parliament, from time to time poured\r\npolitical shot and shell into the ranks of the self-complacent\r\nrepresentatives of the party opposite. In those ranks, too, there were\r\nmen who at heart agreed very largely with the speaker, while compelled\r\nby party discipline to maintain silence. On the other hand, there nearly\r\nalways came a moment when Conservative approval passed into the\r\nopposite, for Sir Charles had no sympathy with the vast if rather\r\nconfused ideas of general annexation which prevailed in Conservative\r\ncircles: the policy of mere earth-hunger which Mr. Gladstone had\r\ndenounced in 1893.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: See above, p. 256.]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Salisbury returned to the Foreign Office in 1895, the policy\r\nof \"graceful concessions\" to France seemed to Sir Charles to have begun\r\nagain--concessions in Tunis, concessions in Siam, concessions all\r\nround--and he returned to the attack. Tunis, he again pointed out, dated\r\nback to 1878, when M. Waddington received, in his own words as given in\r\nhis own statement, a spontaneous offer of that country in the words\r\n\"Take Tunis. England will offer no opposition.\" But at least certain\r\ncommercial rights and privileges were then reserved. Now they were gone.\r\nEven the nominal independence of Madagascar had finally disappeared.\r\n\r\nSir Charles also drew attention to the one subject of foreign affairs\r\nupon which, during the last Parliament, Mr. Curzon never tired of\r\nattacking, first Mr. Gladstone's and then Lord Rosebery's Government:\r\nthis was the advance of the French in Siam. Lord Rosebery had gone to\r\nthe verge of war with France in checking the French proceedings, and\r\nwhen he left office France was under a promise to evacuate Chantaboon\r\nand the provinces of Batambong and Siamrep, and to set up a buffer State\r\non the Mekong. We were then in military occupation of British Trans-\r\nMekong Keng-Cheng. Lord Salisbury came to an arrangement which left\r\nFrance in Chantaboon and these provinces, thus giving away, against our\r\ninterests, what was not ours to give--as he had done in Tunis--and he\r\nevacuated and left to France British Trans-Mekong Keng-Cheng, in which a\r\n50 per cent, _ad valorem_ duty had just been put on British goods (from\r\nBurmah), a duty from which French goods were free. Not only did Lord\r\nSalisbury himself make this arrangement, but he had to submit when\r\nFrance, in alliance with Russia, forced the Government of China to yield\r\nterritory to France, in direct derogation of China's treaty engagements.\r\nLord Salisbury had since made what was known as the Kiang-Hung\r\nConvention with China; and it commenced by setting forth the cession by\r\nChina to France of territory which had been ceded to China on the\r\nexpress condition that it should not be so ceded to France. This action\r\non the part of China was brought about by the violent pressure of France\r\nand Russia at Pekin, which Lord Salisbury passed over. \"The defence of\r\nhis Siam arrangements in the House of Commons consisted in Mr. Curzon,\r\nwho had become the representative of the Foreign Office, informing the\r\nHouse that the provinces (which he had formerly declared most valuable)\r\nwere unimportant to British trade, and in pacifying assurances that the\r\nUpper Mekong was not navigable, although a French steamer was actually\r\nworking on it where Mr. Curzon said no ship could go.\" [Footnote: Letter\r\nto the _Liverpool Daily Post_, December 2nd and 5th, 1898.]\r\n\r\nIn the days of these petty collisions in West Africa and all the world\r\nover--the \"policy of pin-pricks\" to which at this time Mr. Chamberlain\r\nmade fierce allusion in a public speech--Sir Charles arranged to publish\r\na dialogue between himself and M. Lavisse of the French Academy\r\ndiscussing the international situation. \"I shall be answering the\r\n_Temps_ article which replies to you,\" he wrote to Chamberlain on\r\nDecember 26th, 1898. \"Lavisse, being of the Academy, wants a month to\r\npolish his style. The dialogue will not appear till February 1st or\r\n15th. There will be nothing in it new to you. What is new and important\r\nis that the French, impressed by the fleet, and pressed by their men of\r\nbusiness, such as Henri Germain, the Director of the Credit Lyonnais,\r\nand Pallain, now Governor of the Bank of France, want to be friends.\r\nI've told these two and others that it is useless to try and settle\r\nthings unless they will settle Newfoundland. These two came back after\r\nseeing Ministers, including the Foreign Minister and the Minister for\r\nWar, Freycinet, and independently said that they want to settle\r\nNewfoundland. They've quite made up their minds that Germany does not\r\nwant them and will not buy their friendship. I have not seen Monson (the\r\nBritish Ambassador) since my second interview with them, but I told\r\nAustin Lee last night to tell him the terms on which I thought that\r\nNewfoundland could be settled if you want to settle it. I do not put\r\nthem on paper as I am sending this by post.\"\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland dispute as to rights of fishing under the Treaties of\r\nUtrecht and Paris was one to which Dilke always attached special\r\nimportance, and immediately after this letter to Chamberlain he wrote\r\nupon it in the _Pall Mall Magazine_ (February, 1899), describing it as\r\n\"the most dangerous of all international questions, as it is also one of\r\nthe most difficult.\" [Footnote: This dispute was mainly concerned with\r\nthe question whether the French fishermen possessed an \"exclusive\" or\r\nonly a concurrent right in the so-called French shore, under the above-\r\nmentioned treaties (see Fitzmaurice, _Life of Shelburne_, 2nd ed., ii.\r\n218). It was finally settled in the Lansdowne-Delcassé agreement of\r\n1904, with other then pending questions. Sir Charles Dilke gave a useful\r\nsummary of the history of the question and its numerous developments\r\nafter 1783, in a small volume entitled _The British Empire_, published\r\nin 1899.] Great Britain appeared to him to \"have gone infinitely beyond\r\nthe strict terms of the treaty in the concessions to France made for the\r\nsake of peace,\" and to have made proposals which \"would not be tolerated\r\nfor an instant if any of the other ten self-governing colonies were in\r\nquestion,\" and were only considered because of the \"poverty and\r\nfeebleness of Newfoundland.\" Lord Salisbury was, in his eyes, no worse a\r\nsinner in this respect than the Liberal Government of 1893, except that\r\nLord Salisbury had also made concessions in giving up the existing\r\nsituation secured by treaty in Madagascar, in Tunis, and in Siam,\r\nagainst which there might have been set off a settlement of this \"really\r\ndangerous question.\" He said that in Newfoundland the British navy was\r\nbeing used to coerce British colonists into submission to the French\r\ndemands; and he foresaw peril to the colonial relation, as well as peril\r\nin the international field.\r\n\r\nWhether it was possible during the period now under consideration to\r\nmake an alliance, or even to establish friendly relations with Germany\r\non a solid and permanent basis, is a question which will never fail to\r\nbe the subject of discussion and controversy: for on it hinged the\r\nfuture of Europe. With an unfriendly France and a German Chancellor--\r\nPrince Hohenlohe--aiming, and for a time with some partial success, at\r\nre-establishing friendly relations with Russia, the advantages of a good\r\nunderstanding between Great Britain and Germany were obvious; for hardly\r\nhad the difficulties on the North-West frontiers of India been for the\r\ntime quieted by the \"Pamir\" Treaty of 1895, [Footnote: This Treaty was\r\nmade while Lord Kimberley was Foreign Secretary.] when the war between\r\nJapan and China opened up the long series of events in the Far East\r\nwhich culminated later on in the Russo-Japanese War. In those events all\r\nor nearly all the European Great Powers were taking a hand; Germany was\r\naspiring to take a leading part, and had to a certain extent obtained it\r\nby the command-in-chief of the Allied Forces being given to Count\r\nWaldersee, and by the expedition to relieve the Legations in Pekin. But\r\nthe Jameson Raid and the congratulatory telegram of the Emperor to\r\nPresident Kruger in January, 1896, showed that Germany might intend also\r\nto have a South African policy, which in the hands of a less skilful or\r\na less friendly Foreign Secretary than Baron Marschall might open,\r\nnotwithstanding all the previous treaties, a new chapter of diplomacy.\r\nMeanwhile Baron Marschall, with the hand of a skilful jurist, softened\r\ndown the meaning of the famous telegram, by a close and minimizing\r\ninterpretation of the words, and, as a practised diplomatist, went out\r\nof his way to meet the wishes of Lord Salisbury, who had proposed that\r\nthe cost of the recent British Expedition to Dongola should be a charge\r\non the funds of the Egyptian Caisse.\r\n\r\nBut Baron Marschall's tenure of his post was becoming precarious, and\r\nSir Charles did not believe in the possibility of any alliance or\r\npermanent understanding with Germany. He feared, on the contrary, that\r\none result of the policy of concession might be ultimately to tempt\r\nFrance, Germany, and Russia, to form a practical and informal union\r\nagainst Great Britain, similar to that which had proved so great a cause\r\nof anxiety in 1884-85. This, though not a formal alliance, had been\r\nalmost as dangerous as one more specific and avowed, and it was now, he\r\nthought, likely to be found to exist with reference to events in China.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of China by Japan in 1895, every year brought some new\r\nand dangerous development, and the break-up of the Chinese Empire seemed\r\nnear. Any understanding on the part of Great Britain with Russia, in\r\nregard to China, Sir Charles believed to be unreliable, and probably\r\nimpossible, and Lord Salisbury's policy, which seemed to have gone out\r\nof its way to let Russia into Port Arthur, showed in his opinion\r\ndeplorable weakness.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain in a speech in the winter of 1898--which was followed by\r\nothers in the same strain--had seemed almost to propose an alliance with\r\nGermany. Following him at Birmingham, Sir Charles pointed out that the\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies had said: \"If the policy of\r\nisolation which has hitherto been the policy of this country is to be\r\nmaintained in the future, then the fate of the Chinese Empire may\r\nbe--probably will be--hereafter decided without reference to our wishes\r\nand in defiance of our interests;\" and went on to say: \"If, on the other\r\nhand, we are determined to enforce the policy of the open door, to\r\npreserve an equal opportunity for trade with all our rivals, then we\r\nmust not allow jingoes to drive us into a quarrel with all the world at\r\nthe same time, and we must not reject the idea of an alliance with those\r\nPowers whose interests most closely approximate to our own.\" No doubt,\r\nSir Charles replied, the Government were pledged to pursue the policy of\r\n\"equal opportunity for trade,\" but they had not successfully maintained\r\nthat policy in action. What were the Powers, he asked, which Mr.\r\nChamberlain had in view when he went on to say: \"Unless we are allied to\r\nsome great military Power, as we were in the Crimean War, when we had\r\nFrance and Turkey as our allies, we cannot seriously injure Russia\"? Mr.\r\nChamberlain must have referred to an alliance with Germany. Personally,\r\nDilke said that he \"was entirely opposed to a policy of standing and\r\npermanent alliances; but was there any prospect that Germany would ever\r\nagree to bear in Europe the brunt of defending for us--for that was what\r\nit would come to--the most dangerous of our responsibilities? Prince\r\nBismarck's policy on the subject had been avowed over and over again; he\r\nhad foreseen these suggestions, and had rejected them in advance.\r\nSpeaking in 1887, Prince Bismarck said: 'Our friendship for Russia\r\nsuffered no interruption during the time of our wars, and stands to-day\r\nbeyond all doubt.... We shall not ... let anyone throw his lasso round\r\nour neck in order to embroil us with Russia.' And again in 1888: 'No\r\nGreat Power can, in the long-run, cling to the wording of any treaty in\r\ncontradiction to the interests of its own people. It is sooner or later\r\ncompelled to say, \"We cannot keep to that,\" and must justify this\r\nannouncement as well as it can.' [Footnote: See, too, _Bismarck\r\nMemoirs_, ii., pp. 258, 259.] In 1890 the present German Emperor renewed\r\nthe Triple Alliance, and the relations also of Germany and Russia had\r\nnever, he believed, been closer than they were at the present time. Any\r\nnotion of a permanent or standing alliance with Germany against Russia\r\nwas, in short, a Will-o'-the-wisp. Opposed as he was to the whole policy\r\nof alliances as contrary to the true interests of this country, he was\r\nspecially opposed to this particular proposal, because it was calculated\r\nto lead our people to think that they could rely on the strong arm of\r\nanother Power instead of only on their own strong arm.\" [Footnote: The\r\nspeech of Mr. Chamberlain referred to above was made at Birmingham. It\r\nwas followed by speeches at Wakefield on December 8th, 1898, and at\r\nLeicester on November 20th, 1899.]\r\n\r\nYet a strong action in the Near East, Sir Charles thought, might have\r\ncompensated for a feebler policy on the Pacific Coast. In Armenia,\r\nChristians for whom Great Britain was answerable under the Treaty of\r\nBerlin were being massacred, but Lord Salisbury did nothing to help\r\nthem. In November, 1896, there was a faint stir of public opinion, but\r\nmany of the suggestions made in regard to what ought to be done were\r\nunwise. [Footnote: _November 4th_, 1896.--'Morley told me that in order\r\nto force the hand of the Turks, before July, 1895, Kimberley had\r\nproposed to force the Dardanelles, and that Harcourt had stopped it. Mr.\r\nGladstone had written to Morley to insist on his speaking about Armenia\r\nand to complain of his lukewarmness. I said: \"But Mr. G. in 1880, when\r\nsomething could have been done, confined himself to what he called\r\n'friendly' words to the Sultan.'\" See on the whole subject _Crispi\r\nMemoirs_, vol. ii., chap. ix.]\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" Sir Charles had said in 1896, \"would protest more emphatically\r\nthan he did against some of the advice which had been given. One of the\r\nablest journalists and highest of financial authorities, Mr. Wilson, had\r\nsuggested the landing of a few troops and the deportation of the Sultan\r\nto Cyprus. The defences of the Dardanelles were not such as could be\r\nvery easily forced even by the British fleet.... No British Admiral,\r\neven if he succeeded in forcing the Dardanelles, would have troops to\r\nland who could overcome the Turkish guard, an army corps, and the\r\nexcited Turkish population.\" Elsewhere, with prophetic foresight, he\r\nshowed that the forcing of the Dardanelles could not be carried out\r\nwithout \"heavy loss, possibly tremendous loss, and that the loss of a\r\nfirst-class British ironclad is equivalent to the loss of an army corps\r\nwith all its guns.\" [Footnote: Letter to the _Macclesfield Chronicle_,\r\nSeptember 19th, 1896.]\r\n\r\nCrete was now again in a state of chronic rebellion against Turkish\r\nrule; and Turkish methods of repression only stimulated the popular\r\ndemand to be joined to Greece. Sir Charles Dilke thought that, if the\r\nPowers really wished to coerce Turkey to bring about better government\r\nwithin its dominions, coercion could most safely begin in the Greek\r\nislands, where European fleets could absolutely control the issue and no\r\nquestion of Continental partition need arise. In Crete the Sultan could,\r\nSir Charles believed, have been compelled to accept a nominal\r\nsovereignty, such as he retained over Cyprus; and the aspiration towards\r\nHellenic unity, the need for Hellenic expansion, might thus have been\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nIf England had taken \"instant and even isolated action,\" France would,\r\nhe thought, not have thwarted British policy. \"The effect would\r\nultimately have been the addition of Crete to the Greek kingdom under\r\nthe auspices, perhaps, of all the Powers, perhaps of the Powers less\r\nGermany, perhaps of only three or four of them.\" [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nThe occasion was missed, and war, declared by Turkey against Greece,\r\nfollowed, and years of anarchy in Crete. The Ministers of the Powers\r\n\"even in the free Parliaments of the United Kingdom and France\" \"used\r\npro-Turkish language,\" and attacked those who, because they upheld the\r\ntraditional Liberal policy of both countries, were accused of abetting\r\nthe Greeks.\r\n\r\n    \"The blockade by the fleets of the Powers became pro-Turkish, and\r\n    Europe took sides against Greece in the war. If Greece had been\r\n    allowed to hold Crete, she could have exchanged it against Thessaly,\r\n    if the worst had come to the worst, without those financial\r\n    sacrifices which are now necessary. [Footnote: Such a proposal had\r\n    actually been made in 1881 by Prince Bismarck. _Life of Goschen_, i.\r\n    214; _Life of Granville_, ii. 226.] The very claim of the Powers to\r\n    have localized the war by stopping the Slav States from attacking\r\n    Turkey is in itself a claim to have interfered on one side.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Greece was defeated, \"the majority in the Parliament of the United\r\nKingdom, if not of the British people,\" Sir Charles wrote, \"professed\r\nthat their burning sympathies for Greece had been destroyed by Greek\r\ncowardice, although the stand, at Domoko, of ill-supplied young troops\r\nagainst an overwhelmingly superior force of Turkish veterans deserved\r\nfairer criticism.\" He interpreted his own duty differently, and when the\r\nHellenic cause was most unpopular he continued to express his faith in\r\nthe \"rising nationalities of the Eastern Mediterranean,\" and looked\r\nforward with confidence to a future in which Palmerston's generous\r\nsurrender of the Ionian Islands should be emulated by a new act of\r\nLiberal statesmanship. \"There can be little doubt that Cyprus, as a part\r\nof a great scheme for strengthening the elements of the Eastern\r\nMediterranean that are hopeful for the future, will not be kept out of\r\nthe arrangement by any reluctance on the part of the United Kingdom to\r\nlet its inhabitants follow the tendencies of their race!\" [Footnote: The\r\nabove Notes on Crete relate to the period when war broke out, in 1897,\r\nbetween Greece and Turkey, and the Turks invaded Thessaly.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh for an hour of Canning or of Palmerston!\" he said, at a great public\r\nmeeting in the North in October, 1898. \"Canning was a Tory, a Tory\r\nForeign Secretary of State, a Tory Prime Minister, although at odds with\r\nthe Duke of Wellington upon some subjects. Lord Palmerston was looked\r\nupon by many Radicals as a Whig, but in foreign affairs he had never\r\nexhibited that carelessness and that absence of a willingness to run\r\nrisks for the sake of freedom which no doubt marred his conduct of home\r\naffairs. Canning had seen the interest of Great Britain in maintaining\r\nthe Greek cause, as Palmerston had seen her interest in strengthening\r\nGreece by allowing the Republic of the Ionian Isles, of which we had the\r\nprotectorate, to join her after the downfall of the Prince called by\r\nPalmerston 'the spoilt child of autocracy, King Otho.' Canning had\r\nconsistently refused in circumstances of far greater difficulty and\r\ndanger than those which attended the Greek or Cretan questions in our\r\ntimes, to be dragged at the heels of the great despotic Powers. Canning\r\nresolved not only to assist the Greek cause, but in doing so to maintain\r\nthe superiority of British influence in the Eastern Mediterranean; and,\r\nseeing the course which was clear in the interest of Europe and in our\r\nown interest, he determined to settle the question in his own way, as he\r\nat the same time settled that of South America to the immense advantage\r\nof this country, which now had found in South America one of the best of\r\nall markets for her trade. There never was a greater loss to England\r\nthan when Canning died as Prime Minister and was succeeded in office by\r\none of those fleeting figures who, in the language of Disraeli, were but\r\ntransient and embarrassed phantoms. [Footnote: Lord Goderich, Prime\r\nMinister from August 8th, 1827, to January 8th, 1828.] The deeds of\r\nCanning in the questions of Greece and South America, his regard at once\r\nfor liberty and for Britain, might be read in all the lives of that\r\ngreat Minister, and what Palmerston did of the same kind in the case of\r\nItaly was perfectly known.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of observations of this kind, he had to defend himself\r\nmore than once against the charge of \"Jingoism,\" as the cant term of the\r\nday had it; and more particularly in the debate on foreign policy on\r\nJune 10th, 1898, when it was made by an old political friend, Mr.\r\nLeonard Courtney.\r\n\r\n\"I am one of those,\" Dilke replied, \"who are in favour of large\r\narmaments for this country, and believe in increasing the strength of\r\nour defences for the sake of peace; and one of the very reasons why I\r\ndesire that is because I repudiate the idea of making our policy depend\r\nupon the policy of others. I have always repudiated, and never ceased to\r\nrepudiate, the policy of grab which is commonly associated with the name\r\nof Jingo.... I submit that the worst policy in these matters is to have\r\nregard to our own rights only, and not to the rights of others. We want\r\nour country to be viewed with that respect which men will ever cherish\r\nfor unbending integrity of purpose. We should be more scrupulous with\r\nregard to asserting nominal rights which we do not intend to maintain.\r\n\r\n    \"When such transactions are criticized, the Government always reply\r\n    by asking: 'Would you have gone to war at this or that particular\r\n    point, for this or that particular object?' It always appears to me\r\n    in these cases that there is some confusion in our minds about this\r\n    risk of war on such occasions. If the intention of the other Power\r\n    is to avoid war, war will be avoided when you quietly hold your own.\r\n    But if the intention of the other Power is war, there will be no\r\n    lack of pretexts to bring it about.\"\r\n\r\nHis policy, therefore, would have been to advance no claims but such as\r\ncould be made good, if need arose, by England's own carefully measured\r\nresources in connection with those of France.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, impossible at this time to focus public attention upon\r\nevents in the Mediterranean, or even in the Nile Valley. The eyes of all\r\npoliticians alike were becoming fixed upon a different part of the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain had taken the Colonial Office in 1895, and it was in\r\nreply to a short speech from Sir Charles Dilke during the brief Autumn\r\nSession of that year that he expressed himself glad to outline his\r\ngeneral policy, and spoke of finding in the Colonies an undeveloped\r\nestate, which he was determined to develop. His phrases caught the\r\npopular imagination then as always. Colonial enterprise was the theme of\r\nall pens and tongues. Then on New Year's Day of 1896 had come the\r\nJameson Raid. But in the stormy chapters of Parliamentary life which\r\nfollowed Sir Charles took little part, beyond commending Mr.\r\nChamberlain's promptitude in condemning the Raid. The speech which he\r\nmade in the vote of censure on the colonial policy of Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nmoved on January 30th, 1900, as an amendment to the Address, by Lord\r\nEdmond Fitzmaurice on behalf of the Opposition, was of an independent\r\ncharacter, dealing more with the military and naval aspects of the\r\nposition than those purely political. But, though standing rather apart\r\nfrom the general line of attack, the speech was recognized as one of the\r\nmost weighty contributions to the debate, as it brought home to the\r\ncountry on how dangerously narrow a margin of strength the policy of Mr.\r\nChamberlain rested, and how entirely it owed its success to the\r\nmaintenance of the navy of this country, which German Navy Bills were\r\nabout to threaten. Four years later, when the German naval preparations\r\nwere assuming a definite shape, he repeated these warnings in a still\r\nmore decisive manner by a speech which attracted great attention in\r\nGermany itself, as well as at home. [Footnote: \"Der frühere\r\nUnterstaatsecretär des Auswärtigen, und sehr angesehene Sir Charles\r\nDilke, wies damals auf Deutschland bin und sagte: man vergrössere dort\r\ndie Flotte mit einer ausgewohnten Schnelligkeit und richte sich damit\r\nöffentlich gegen England.\" (Reventlow, p. 242).]\r\n\r\nSir Charles disapproved of the Boer War, [Footnote: \"I am myself opposed\r\nto the Milner policy, which led up to the South African War. But in\r\nspite of the Natal events I do not share the opinion either that the war\r\nitself will be a long one, or that foreign complications will arise.\"\r\n(\"Risk of European Coalition,\" _Review of the Week_, November 4th,\r\n1899).] but he held that when the country was seized by the war-fever\r\ninterposition was useless: it did more harm than good both at home and\r\nabroad. Staying in Paris, in the early days of the contest, when we were\r\nsuffering and beaten for the moment, he told those who commiserated us\r\nand threatened European complications to \"wait and see,\" laughing at the\r\nidea that England could be permanently at a disadvantage, but not\r\nentering into the abstract merits of the question. If forced to speak,\r\nhe admitted that the war was \"unwise,\" but his utterances were very few.\r\nIt, however, raised a general principle, inducing him to recall facts\r\nwhich had been too frequently forgotten. The party which was now\r\nopposing government by Chartered Company was, he said, the party which\r\nhad revived it in 1881 in the case of North Borneo; while the Tories,\r\nwho then had condemned that method of colonization, were now\r\nenthusiastic for it. Sir Charles, who had opposed the system in regard\r\nto Borneo, where it was attended by little danger, now pointed out that\r\nnot only had it produced the Jameson Raid in South Africa, but that on\r\nthe West Coast the Niger Company threatened to involve England in\r\ndifferences with France by action which England could not control. These\r\nwere conclusive proofs that the principle which in 1881 he had resisted\r\nto the point of seriously differing from his official chief was fraught\r\nwith inconvenience and dangers. The Niger Company's position, however,\r\nwas the affair of political specialists; South African policy was\r\nembroiled with the fortunes of a gigantic gambling speculation.\r\n[Footnote: This is recalled by a fact in Sir Charles's personal history.\r\nHis son became entitled on coming of age in September, 1895, to a legacy\r\nof £1,000. Sir Charles offered him in lieu of that bequest 2,000\r\n\"Chartered South African shares.\" Had he accepted, he could, when the\r\nlegacy became due, 'have sold them for £17,000 and cleared £16,000\r\nprofit! But he refused them when offered, and,' says Dilke, 'not\r\nthinking them things for a politician, I sold them, and (purposely) at a\r\nloss.']\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal War destroyed whatever prospects there might have been of\r\na permanent understanding with Germany, and Mr. Chamberlain before the\r\nwar was over had to make at least one speech which brought on himself\r\nthe fiercest denunciations of the German Press, when he replied in\r\nvigorous language to the charge of cruelty brought against the British\r\nmilitary authorities in Africa. The absolute mastery of the sea\r\npossessed by Great Britain probably alone prevented the Emperor forcing\r\nhis Ministers into some imprudent act; and it was clearly seen that\r\nCount von Bülow, who had succeeded Baron Marschall as Foreign Secretary\r\nin June, 1897, and afterwards succeeded Prince Hohenlohe as Chancellor\r\nin 1900, though not desiring a conflict, and convinced, as he has since\r\ntold the world, that none need come, was nevertheless less friendly than\r\nhis predecessors, and intended to pursue rigidly the policy of a free\r\nhand with a strong navy behind it. [Footnote: Bülow, _Imperial Germany_\r\n(English translation), p. 47. A later edition, with considerable\r\nalterations and additions, was published in 1916.] Events were visibly\r\nfighting on the side of those who saw that France was the only possible\r\nally of Great Britain, and that the only other alternative was, not an\r\nalliance with Germany, but a return to the policy of \"splendid\r\nisolation.\" The apologist of Prince von Bülow has himself told the world\r\nthat the policy of an absolutely \"free hand\" now inaugurated by the new\r\nChancellor was evidently one, in itself, of great difficulty, because\r\nGermany might frequently be compelled to change front; and, to use an\r\nexpression attributed to Bismarck, might have to \"face about\" until\r\nfriendship with this country became impossible. The prognostication was\r\nsoon to be justified. [Footnote: Reventlow, p. 159.]\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps the decisive moment in the relations of Great Britain and\r\nGermany, when Count von Bülow, with the ink hardly dry on the Anglo-\r\nGerman treaty of October, 1900, which was supposed to be intended to\r\nprotect China against further Russian advances on the north, cynically\r\nwent out of his way to make a statement in the German Parliament that\r\nthe treaty did not apply to Manchuria. The reply of the British\r\nGovernment was the Anglo-Japanese treaty of February 11th, 1902.\r\n[Footnote: Reventlow (_German Foreign Policy_, 1888-1914) speaks of this\r\nincident as the \"Wendepunkt der Britischen Politik und der Deutsch-\r\nEnglischen Beziehungen.\" (p. 168). See, too, Bérard, _La Révolte de\r\nl'Asie_, pp. 192-194, 208, 209, 293.]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1901, a typical article from Sir Charles's pen appeared in\r\nthe _Figaro_, strongly urging the absolute necessity for the creation of\r\nreally cordial relations between Great Britain and France, which he\r\nconsidered were the sure and sufficient guarantee of European peace. It\r\nwas true, no doubt, that the increasing strength and efficiency of the\r\nFrench army were a guarantee, up to a certain point, of peace with\r\nGermany, just as the weakness of the French army had been an active\r\ntemptation to Germany in 1870 to attack France. The joint action of the\r\nPowers in China at the moment was also itself a sign of improved\r\nrelations. Nevertheless, as Moltke had said, Germany would remain armed\r\nfor half a century after 1870, if she intended, as she did intend, to\r\nkeep Alsace-Lorraine; and as Europe had for the present to remain an\r\narmed camp, more could hardly be hoped than to maintain peace, however\r\nburdensome the cost. Europe, Sir Charles urged, should try to realize\r\nthat a great war would probably be fatal, whoever might be the victor,\r\nto her commercial world-supremacy--as the great and ruinous burdens,\r\nwhich would everywhere result, would surely cause that supremacy to pass\r\nto America. There the development of the resources, not of the United\r\nStates only, but also of the Argentine Confederation, ought to give\r\npause to those who did not look beyond the immediate future and seemed\r\nunable to realize that a Europe laden with all the effects of some\r\ngigantic struggle would prove a weak competitor with the New World on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. To remind Frenchmen that the English\r\nhave not always been victorious in war was no very difficult task; but\r\nhe ventured to remind Englishmen also that, as the English army was\r\nquite inadequate to take a large part in a Continental war under the\r\nchanged conditions of modern warfare, Great Britain and France, while\r\nunited, should more than ever walk warily, and distrust the counsels of\r\nthose who occasionally in Great Britain spoke lightly of war. It was\r\neasy to talk about the victories of Marlborough and Wellington; but the\r\nmilitary history of England was really a very chequered one, and of this\r\nEnglishmen were, unfortunately, mostly unaware. Our military prestige\r\nhad never been great in the commencement of our wars, and, as he had\r\nsaid in the recent debates on the Boer War, [Footnote: House of Commons,\r\nFebruary 1st, 1900] we had too often had to \"muddle through.\" On more\r\nthan one occasion--in America, for example, during the Seven Years' War,\r\nand more recently in New Zealand--we had only been got out of our\r\ndifficulties by the help of our own colonists. Here at least was a great\r\nfuture source of as yet undeveloped strength. The disastrous Walcheren\r\nExpedition was on record; even Wellington had had to retire over and\r\nover again in the earlier period of the Peninsular War; in the Crimea we\r\nhad not shown any great military quality beyond the bravery of our\r\ntroops. These were truths, unpalatable truths, but they had to be\r\nuttered, if on the one hand the cause of army reform in Great Britain\r\nwas to prosper, and if on the other France was not to reckon too much on\r\nthe assistance of a British army on the Continent of Europe, especially\r\nin the earlier stages of a war. [Footnote: _Figaro_, February 11th,\r\n1901.]\r\n\r\nIn a cordial understanding with France, therefore, Sir Charles Dilke\r\nconsidered to lie the sheet-anchor of British foreign policy and the\r\nbest guarantee of peace. In 1898 the arrival of the French force at\r\nFashoda, on the Nile, had brought things to a crisis, and the firm\r\nattitude then adopted by Lord Salisbury at length convinced France, as\r\nSir Charles always believed it would, that she must make her choice\r\nbetween Germany and Great Britain. In the action of Lord Lansdowne, who\r\nhad succeeded Lord Salisbury at the Foreign Office in 1900, and in the\r\npolicy eventually embodied in the Anglo-French agreement of 1904, Sir\r\nCharles recognized the views which persistently, but not always\r\nsuccessfully, he had urged for many years on his own friends in France\r\nand England. But the new departure was only rendered possible by the\r\nappearance at the French Foreign Office of a statesman who, after the\r\nbitter experience of the final failure of the policy of \"pin-pricks\"\r\nbefore Lord Salisbury's firm stand in the Fashoda affair, boldly threw\r\nhis predecessors overboard, and managed to make himself the inevitable\r\nForeign Minister of France for a long period of years, successfully\r\nmaintaining himself in office against every competitor and every rival,\r\nwhile other Ministers came and went. Late, perhaps too late, the policy\r\nof Gambetta was revived by M. Delcassé, and it held its own.\r\n\r\nBy 1903, owing to the complete change in the attitude of France, matters\r\nhad so much improved as between England and the Republic that Sir\r\nCharles could write in the _Empire Review_ of \"An Arrangement with\r\nFrance\" as possible, basing himself on recent articles in _La Dépêche\r\nColoniale_, which had been the extreme anti-British organ. \"That the\r\nFrench colonial party should have come frankly to express the desire\r\nwhich they now entertain for an arrangement of all pending questions\r\nbetween the English and the French is indeed a return towards relations\r\nbetter than any which have existed since Gambetta's fall from power.\"\r\nBut this improvement in the relations of the two countries was\r\nmaterially aided by the influence of the personality of King Edward\r\nVII., which Sir Charles fully recognized, as he also did one of the\r\nconsequences, which was perhaps not so fully seen by others. \"The wearer\r\nof the crown of England plays in foreign affairs,\" he wrote, \"a part\r\nmore personal than in other matters is that of the constitutional King.\r\nNo one can deny that there are advantages, and no one can pretend that\r\nthere are never drawbacks, attendant on this system. It is not my\r\npurpose to discuss it, but it makes the adoption in this country of\r\ncontrol by a Parliamentary Committee difficult, if not impossible.\"\r\n[Footnote: _English Review_, October, 1909. Article by Sir C. Dilke.]\r\n\"The great and sudden improvement in the relations between the\r\nEnglish-speaking world and France is largely due to the wisdom and\r\ncourtesy with which the King made clear to France that there was no\r\nground for the suspicions which prevailed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: _Quarterly Review_, July, 1905, p. 313. Article by Sir C.\r\nDilke. With France Sir Charles had for the moment again a certain\r\nofficial relation, having been placed on the Royal Commission charged\r\nwith British interests at the Paris Exhibition--an honour due to him not\r\nonly in his own right, but as his father's son. At this moment also,\r\nwhen relations between the neighbouring countries were severely\r\nstrained, he gave to the Luxembourg the reversion of Gambetta's\r\nportrait, and sent the portrait itself to be placed among the works of\r\nLegros on exhibition in June, 1900. M. Léonce Bénédez, curator of the\r\nLuxembourg, in writing to press for the chance of exhibiting the\r\npicture, said:\r\n\r\n    \"Je m'excuse vivement de mon importunité, mais je serais très\r\n    désireux que notre public peut être admis à juger Legros sur cette\r\n    belle oeuvre. De plus, je serais, en meme temps, très heureux que\r\n    les amis de votre grande nation, plus nombreux que la sottise de\r\n    quelques journalistes ne voudrait le laisser croire, fussent à même\r\n    d'apprécier la pensée élevée et délicate de l'illustre homme d'état\r\n    anglais qui, au milieu des circonstances présentes, a tenu à donner\r\n    à notre pays une marque si touchante de sympathie en lui offrant le\r\n    portrait d'un de ses plus glorieux serviteurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe exhibition drew Sir Charles and Lady Dilke for a summer visit to\r\nParis, and it was during this visit that the sculptor Roty executed his\r\nmedallion of Sir Charles.]\r\n\r\nBut wisdom and courtesy were not a little aided by the royal habit of\r\nmixing easily with men at home and abroad, just as, on the other hand,\r\nthe long retirement of Queen Victoria had been injurious in an opposite\r\ndirection. This feeling finds expression in the fragment of commentary\r\nin which Sir Charles dealt with the change of Sovereigns:\r\n\r\n    'The Accession Council after the Queen's death was a curious comment\r\n    on history. History will tell that Victoria's death plunged the\r\n    Empire into mourning, and that favourable opinion is more general of\r\n    her than of her successor. Yet the Accession Council, attended\r\n    almost solely by those who had reached power under her reign, was a\r\n    meeting of men with a load off them. Had the King died in 1902, the\r\n    Accession Council of his successor would not have been thus gay;\r\n    there would have been real sorrow.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles thought hopefully of the situation at this moment, and there\r\nis a letter dated as far back as 1900 in which Mr. Hyndman noted the\r\n\"unusual experience\" of finding an Englishman who took a more favourable\r\nview of France than he himself, and expressed his fear that Sir Charles\r\nunderrated \"the strength of the National party.\" [Footnote: How well he\r\nunderstood France may perhaps best be judged by an article written, at\r\nthe desire of M. Labori, for the _Grande Revue_ in December, 1901. It is\r\ncalled \"Torpeur Républicaine,\" and begins with the observation that\r\nEnglish Radicals are tempted to think French Republicans more\r\nreactionary than any English Tories, for the reason that all English\r\nparties had practically, if not in theory, accepted municipal Socialism.\r\n\"In France,\" he said, \"the electors of certain cities return Socialist\r\nmunicipal councils. They are all but absolutely powerless. We, on the\r\nother hand, elect Tory or Whig municipalities, and they do the best of\r\nSocialist work.\"] But, notwithstanding the alliance of France with\r\nRussia, the action of Russia in the Far East in the period covered by\r\nthe events which ended in the Japanese War had not diminished Sir\r\nCharles's rooted dislike of any idea of _entente_ or alliance between\r\nRussia and Great Britain. He considered that Sir Edward Grey meant to be\r\nForeign Secretary in the next Liberal Government, and was intent on\r\nmaking an arrangement or alliance with Russia to which he would\r\nsubordinate every other consideration. \"Grey,\" he wrote early in 1905 to\r\nLord Edmond Fitzmaurice, \"has always favoured the deal with Russia. I\r\nhope I may be able to stay outside the next Government to kill it, which\r\nI would do if outside, not within. This,\" he said, alluding to the\r\nrecent death of Lady Dilke, \"assumes that I regain an interest in\r\naffairs which I have wholly lost. I am well, but can at present think of\r\nnothing but of the great person who is gone from my side.\" [Footnote:\r\nFebruary 2nd, 1905.] At this time the old controversy was again raging,\r\nboth at home and in India, over the question of the defence of the\r\nNorth-Western Frontier of India; and a recent Governor-General and his\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India, it was believed, had not altogether seen\r\neye to eye. The latter was credited with very extensive views as to the\r\nnecessity of an increase in the number of British troops, with a view to\r\nthe defence of the frontier against Russian attack. Sir Charles put\r\nneither the danger of a Russian invasion nor the general strength of\r\nRussia as a military nation so high as did some who claimed to speak\r\nwith authority; and he did not believe that we had any reason for\r\nconstant fear in India or elsewhere, or to seek alliances, in order to\r\navoid a Russian attack on India. The vulnerability of Russia on the\r\nPacific, which he had always pointed to, was demonstrated in the\r\nJapanese War; as well as the miserable military administration of\r\nRussia, which he had indicated thirty-eight years before as a permanent\r\nsource of weakness, certain to be exposed whenever Russia undertook\r\noperations on a large scale at any great distance from her base.\r\n[Footnote: In _Greater Britain_, ii. 299-312.] The Japanese alliance, he\r\nbelieved, could never be directly utilized for resisting in Afghanistan\r\nan attack by Russia on India. Happily, as he considered, the facts had\r\ndemonstrated that there was no need for such a display of timidity as\r\nwould be involved in marching foreign troops across India to defend it\r\non the frontier. [Footnote: _Monthly Review_, December, 1905. It is to\r\nbe observed that this argument does not involve any criticism of the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Treaty considered as a defensive measure elsewhere.]\r\n\r\nBut if he thought that an alliance with Russia was not a necessity for a\r\nsound British foreign policy, on the other hand he was equally convinced\r\nthat a good understanding with the United States of America was such a\r\nnecessity. He believed that if fresh subjects of difference were not\r\ncreated, and any remaining questions of difference--like the Fisheries--\r\nwere settled, as the _Alabama_ and Alaska questions had been settled,\r\nthe old Jeffersonian tradition of suspicion of English policy would die\r\nout, even in the Democratic party, and that no obstacle would then\r\nremain to prevent the co-operation of all the branches of the race in a\r\ncommon policy.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in June, 1898, he had referred to the improved\r\nrelations with the United States in terms which gave credit for the\r\nimprovement mainly to Sir Julian Pauncefote, then Ambassador at\r\nWashington, for whose services he had the greatest admiration.\r\n[Footnote: Sir Julian Pauncefote had previously been Permanent Under-\r\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs for many years.] When, in 1896, the\r\nquestion of Venezuela had threatened to make trouble between the two\r\nEnglish-speaking Powers, he counted the claims of Great Britain in\r\nrespect of the frontiers of Guiana as \"dust in the balance\" when weighed\r\nagainst the advantage of not \"running across the national line of policy\r\nof the United States.\" He desired to sink all such petty affairs in a\r\npolicy of Anglo-American co-operation in the Far East. Rivals for trade\r\nin China they must be, but the interest of both lay in working for the\r\n\"open door\" which admitted a friendly rivalry. He wrote in the _American\r\nIndependent_ for May 1st, 1899: \"The will of the United States, if it be\r\nin accordance with the will of Great Britain and of the Australian\r\nCommonwealth--the will, in other words, of the English-speaking\r\npeoples--will be paramount in the Pacific if they are united\"; and he\r\nwas never weary of urging the improvement in England's relations with\r\nthe United States which would follow from a friendly settlement with\r\nIreland. [Footnote: In _Present Position of European Politics_, 1887, he\r\nhad said: \"I, for one, still have hope that the causes of strangement\r\nbetween Great Britain and the chief of her daughter-countries, which are\r\nmainly to be found in the friction produced by the Irish Question, may\r\neven within our lifetime be removed, and the tie of blood, and tongue,\r\nand history and letters, again drawn close.\" And in a note written later\r\nin his own copy are the words: \"It is for the Americans of the United\r\nStates to decide how far towards firm alliance this shall be carried.\"\r\nCf. _Life of Beaconsfield_, iv. 231.]\r\n\r\nBearing in mind all these considerations, he believed, notwithstanding\r\nall the wars and the rumours of wars, that the Great Armageddon so much\r\ndreaded could be avoided by diplomacy combined with proper measures of\r\ndefence. The long chain of events formed by the Sino-Japanese War, the\r\nBoer War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and the Russo-\r\nJapanese War, were in his opinion \"secondary events,\" however important,\r\nappearing to threaten the peace of Europe from time to time--very\r\ndisquieting, no doubt, and ominous occasionally of yet worse things--but\r\nthings such as diplomacy had conjured away before, and ought to be able\r\nto conjure away again. He did not think that Morocco, long regarded at\r\nthe Foreign Office as a danger-point, would ever prove a sufficient\r\nobject to induce Germany to break the general peace. She would threaten,\r\ntake all she could get, and then withdraw with the spoils, just avoiding\r\nthe danger-point; and so it no doubt turned out to be in 1905-06 at the\r\ntime of the troubles which ended in the Algeciras Conference. But he\r\nrecognized the personal character of the German Emperor as a new factor\r\nof danger in the situation.\r\n\r\nThe essential point since 1871, he wrote in 1905, had been that there\r\nnever had existed a serious and settled intention of making the much-\r\ndreaded \"European War\" on the part of any of those with whom the great\r\ndecision rested. There was, he said, to the good this main\r\nconsideration--that, if any Power had intended war, a sufficient\r\npretext could always have been found, yet the war had not come. The\r\nsecurity for the maintenance of the long \"armed peace\" was, in fact,\r\nthis: that no Power had really intended war, or intended it now. What\r\nthe consequences would be was too well known by the responsible leaders.\r\nThe sudden heats which most seemed to jeopardize peace had arisen in\r\nregard to questions not of European importance, mostly outside Europe,\r\nwhere sometimes on one side or the other, and sometimes upon both,\r\ntactful treatment in advance, and what might be styled \"a long view,\"\r\nwould have saved the world from trouble altogether, and ought to do so\r\nin future under analogous circumstances, whenever the question of the\r\nBagdad Railway and the remaining questions relating to Africa came up\r\nfor final settlement. [Footnote: _English Review_, October, 1909.]\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of peace he believed to lie in the policy of _ententes_,\r\nbut on condition that the policy begun by Lord Lansdowne and M. Delcassé\r\nshould aim at agreement between two Powers only, and be limited to\r\nspecific objects. [Footnote: See the same opinion expressed in 1871,\r\nVol. I., p. 133.] Beyond this it was dangerous to go. An _entente_\r\nbetween more than two Powers, as distinct from one between two only,\r\nreminded him of an American game of cards which he had seen played in\r\nthe Far West. This game when played by two persons was called _euchre_,\r\nbut when played by three persons was called by another and very\r\ndisagreeable name, because it so frequently ended in the use of knives.\r\nThe Franco-Italian agreements of 1898 and 1900, the Anglo-French\r\nagreement of 1904, the Franco-Spanish agreement of 1904, the agreements\r\nbetween Japan and Russia which had followed and grown out of the\r\nPortsmouth Treaty of September, 1905, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty which\r\nfollowed, and the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 as to Persia, were\r\nguarantees for peace, because they came within the above definition. It\r\ndoes not appear, however, that he considered the alliance of France and\r\nRussia, dating so far as was then known from 1895, as a real guarantee\r\nfor peace, or that he shared the later views attributed to Gambetta, of\r\nthe desirability of an _entente_ between Great Britain, France, and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"M. Gaston Thomson publishes in the _Matin_ extracts from\r\nletters by Gambetta to M. Ranc. In one letter, written apparently at the\r\ntime of the crisis of 1875, Gambetta says:\r\n\r\n    \"'You must know that the forger of the Ems despatch is about to\r\n    commit another act of treachery. But our calmness and\r\n    self-possession will prevent us from falling into the same trap as\r\n    in 1870. The croakings of a sinister raven will not plunge us into\r\n    folly this time. He has understood his mistake. He has been able to\r\n    transform a divided and impotent Germany into a great, strong,\r\n    disciplined Empire. For us and for himself he was less well inspired\r\n    when he exacted the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, which was the\r\n    germ of death for his work.... Until they have remedied this error\r\n    no one will disarm. The world's peace, which is so necessary for all\r\n    peoples, will remain always at the mercy of an incident.' In order\r\n    to prepare France to meet the future, Gambetta strove to bring about\r\n    the alliance which to-day unites France, Great Britain, and Russia.\r\n    In a striking passage he writes:\r\n\r\n    \"'The number and importance of Russia's difficulties grow every day.\r\n    L---- keeps the Prince of Wales informed day by day of the\r\n    difficulties of that Power. The political ambitions of Russia will\r\n    be impeded by Austria, who is already assuming a hostile attitude.\r\n    She is exerting pressure upon Rumania. Do you see, as a consequence,\r\n    Austria allying herself with Rumania and Turkey against Russia? What\r\n    a conflict!\r\n\r\n    \"'The Prince of Wales, however, foresees it. He does not share the\r\n    hostility of a section of the English nation against Russia. With\r\n    all his young authority he fights against measures which may be\r\n    prejudicial to Russia. I see in him the makings of a great\r\n    statesman....\r\n\r\n    \"'I desire that our enemies should be Russia's enemies. It is clear\r\n    that Bismarck wants an alliance with the Austrians. Russia must\r\n    therefore be made to see that we might be her ally.... Since the\r\n    Revolution our country exerts great influence in Europe. Before long\r\n    I see Russia and England at our side, if we only have a proper\r\n    internal policy.'\" (_Times_, December 30th, 1915).]\r\n\r\nHe was strongly convinced that the improvement of the French army since\r\n1871 had been so great that it afforded by itself a sufficient reason to\r\ngive Germany pause, and he believed that the German Emperor considered\r\nthe French army better in some respects than his own. [Footnote: Baron\r\nBeyens says that in 1911 it was the general opinion that in many\r\nrespects the French was in advance of the German army (_L'Allemagne\r\navant la Guerre_, p. 229). Ibid., p. 220.] An alliance between the two\r\nWestern Powers and Russia might, in given circumstances, on the one hand\r\nencourage the party of _revanche_ and push the country into dangerous\r\nadventures, and on the other tempt the war party in Germany to try again\r\nsome extreme course, as it had in 1875.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view Dilke regarded with suspicion and anxiety the\r\njourneys of the King on the Continent after 1905, unaccompanied by a\r\nSecretary of State according to the ancient constitutional practice, but\r\naccompanied by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State from the Foreign\r\nOffice, a former Ambassador to St. Petersburg. This gave plausible\r\nopportunities for encouraging the belief then prevalent in Germany that\r\nsome mysterious policy was being devised, outside the ordinary channels\r\nof diplomacy and Parliamentary knowledge--a policy which, with the aid\r\nof France and Russia, was to take the shape of encircling Germany with\r\nenemies, and cutting her off from legitimate development. These\r\nanxieties were stimulated by a considerable amount of foolish writing in\r\nLondon newspapers, and still more foolish and unauthorized talk.\r\n\r\n\"France and Russia,\" he wrote in 1908, \"are drawn together by\r\ngeographical considerations--given the detachment of French territory to\r\nthe benefit of Germany in 1871. It did not need the parade of an\r\nalliance to cause Kings and statesmen to recognize the fact. War was\r\nmade impossible in 1875--the last occasion when the well-informed\r\nthought renewed German attack on France probable--by the absolute\r\nrefusal of the German Emperor; but behind that refusal lay the certainty\r\nthat Russia would not forward the aims of the Prussian military party,\r\nas she had done, for a consideration, in 1870. It is, perhaps, too\r\ntrivial a suggestion, but one which comes inevitably to the mind, that\r\nthe householder is apt to be friendly with the man who lives next door\r\nbut one, on account of their common dislike of their next-door\r\nneighbour. During the 'reign of force,' still extant upon the Continent\r\nof Europe, a more appropriate simile may be found in the proverbial\r\nhabit of each of two men, in a street fight, frightening his opponent by\r\nrecognition of a personage in the background. That Germany, however\r\nambitious, and however boastful of her military strength, should be\r\nrendered nervous by the menace of Franco-Russian co-operation is a\r\nconsideration modified only by the universal recognition of the desire\r\nof France for self-respecting peace. As soon as another Power is\r\nsuspected of any intention of making use of the Franco-Russian\r\nco-operation for the purpose of isolating Germany, a dangerous situation\r\nhas arisen.\r\n\r\n    \"We are so confident in our own profound knowledge of our wish for\r\n    European peace that we hardly realize the extreme danger for the\r\n    future which is caused by all suggestion that we have succeeded in\r\n    isolating Germany, or are striving to bring about that result. The\r\n    London articles written in violent support of a supposed alliance\r\n    did the harm; and to anyone who keeps touch for himself of\r\n    Continental opinion the harm was undoubted, and tended to produce\r\n    several undesirable results.\r\n\r\n    \"There is a word to be addressed to those who believe that our navy\r\n    is our true defence, until the progress of pacific thought in the\r\n    working classes of all countries has rendered the other Powers as\r\n    peaceful as France. Those who crowed over the isolation of Germany\r\n    took the best means of increasing the German Fleet, and contributed\r\n    at the same time, by the proposed inflation of our expeditionary\r\n    force, to the weakening of the British Navy.\r\n\r\n    \"The true explanation of the _entente_, and it needs no better, is\r\n    to be found in the defence of its essentially pacific nature by one\r\n    of its original authors, M. Delcassé. [Footnote: M. Delcassé had to\r\n    resign office in 1905, under German pressure, in connection with the\r\n    controversies about Morocco.] He had his faults as a Minister, and\r\n    on two occasions provoked alarms or dangers, which afterwards,\r\n    however, he did more than any other man to allay. Should\r\n    circumstances change and European war become likely, as it has not\r\n    in fact been likely since 1871, the basis for our alliances, if we\r\n    needs must have them, lies in our peaceful policy, our vigour, and\r\n    our fleet.\r\n\r\n    \"Thanks to the alarm itself, which the harum-scarum articles\r\n    excited, prudence will once more gain control of our foreign\r\n    affairs. The _entente_ will continue: Italy, we may hope, will not\r\n    once more be scared out of her improved relations with Powers\r\n    outside the Triplice. Recent occurrences may be turned to useful\r\n    end, by courage in speaking out displayed by those who insist that a\r\n    policy, profoundly peaceful in fact, shall not be exposed to being\r\n    represented as directed against any one of the European Powers.\"\r\n\r\nItaly, he believed--and events have justified the forecast--would be\r\ncompelled by the pressure of circumstances to leave the Triple Alliance.\r\nHow far Germany would be able to keep a permanent hold on Austria-\r\nHungary might also, he thought, be doubtful, as it would largely depend\r\non the developments of home issues in Austria itself, as to which\r\nprophecy was always rash. Like other statesmen of an older school, he\r\nstill probably clung to the hope that the Dual Empire might yet be\r\ngradually converted into a Federal State, in which the Slavonic\r\npopulations of the Empire would play a larger part and would not submit\r\nto take marching orders from Berlin in regard to policy in the Balkans.\r\n[Footnote: A short time before his death, in 1902, Lord Kimberley said\r\nto Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice: \"If ever there is another Liberal\r\nGovernment--which is perhaps doubtful--Grey or you, or both of you, may\r\nhave something to say to foreign affairs. Now, remember, there is on no\r\naccount to be any quarrelling with Austria. She has been the only steady\r\nfriend we have had in Europe--I mean since 1866. The Hungarians have\r\nalways been our friends. So, I repeat, _no quarrelling with Austria_. I\r\nhave said the same thing to Grey.\" (Notes communicated by Lord\r\nFitzmaurice). See, too, the opinion of M. Ribot, cited in René Henry's\r\n_Questions d'Autriche-Hongrie_, pp. 176-178: \"Quant à l'Autriche, nos\r\nrapports avec elle ont toujours été bons; ils ont été pleins, non\r\nseulement de courtoisie, mais de quelque chose de plus; parceque\r\nl'Autriche sait que, de toutes les puissances européennes, la France est\r\nla dernière qui pourrait souhaiter que l'Empire d'Autriche, garantie\r\nnécessaire de l'équilibre européen, se brisat et disparût pour le\r\nmalheur de l'Europe.\" (Speech in the Senate, March 11th, 1903). An\r\ninteresting collection of opinions on the development of Austria into a\r\nfederal State, and the probable results on the Balkan Peninsula, will be\r\nfound in the last chapter of the work of Dr. Aurel Popovici, _Die\r\nVereinigten Staaten von Gross-Oesterreich_ (Leipzig, 1906).]\r\n\r\nBoth in 1908 and 1909, in the debates on the Foreign Office Votes in the\r\nHouse of Commons, Sir Charles had expressed apprehensions of the\r\ndevelopment of Great Britain's _entente_ with Russia, in regard to\r\nPersia, into something far more extensive, and therefore dangerous--into\r\nsomething, in fact, very like an \"alliance.\" He feared that in the\r\nBosnian question it had been pushed to extreme limits. The result, he\r\nsaid, had been to lead to a diplomatic humiliation. He claimed also that\r\nrecent debates in the French Chamber, which had taken place at the time\r\nof the fall of M. Clemenceau's Ministry in the later half of 1909,\r\nshowed that a large body of French opinion shared this view. [Footnote:\r\nSee, for a summary of these views, an article by Sir C. Dilke in the\r\n_English Review_ of October, 1909, p. 495; and Hansard for 1908,\r\ncxviii., 955-970; and for 1909, vol. viii., 621-635.]\r\n\r\nWith these preoccupations present to his mind he spoke on the last\r\noccasion on which he addressed the House of Commons at any length on\r\nforeign affairs--on July 22nd, 1909--when the policy of Sir Edward Grey\r\nin regard to the final annexation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina by\r\nAustria-Hungary was discussed on the Foreign Office Vote. He attacked\r\nthis policy because it seemed to confirm the belief in the alleged\r\ntendency of the Foreign Office to extend the Anglo-Russian arrangement\r\nin regard to Persia into a general _entente_, with the probable result\r\nof producing exactly the opposite of the result intended, and of thereby\r\nstrengthening the consolidation of the Central Powers. The diplomatic\r\nadmissions and confessions of Lord Salisbury, both before and at the\r\ntime of the Berlin Congress of 1878, had, he thought, made it difficult\r\nfor the Foreign Office to take any decided stand against the final\r\nannexation, which the existing position had been certain to cause sooner\r\nor later. Turkey and Servia both complained. He did not deny that the\r\nTurkish Revolution brought about by the so-called \"Young Turks,\" who\r\nwere the cause of the crisis in the Balkans, held out some possible\r\nprospect of a future less hopeless than the previous state of things;\r\nbut this might have been conceded without expressing \"unreserved\r\napproval of a military pronouncement attended by a good deal of\r\nhanging.\" Servia also, no doubt, might be said in some degree to\r\nrepresent democratic principles upon the banks of the Danube; but he\r\nthought it difficult to reconcile the expression before a rather cynical\r\nEurope--and in very strong language, too--of our official horror at the\r\nconduct of the Servians in the barbarous murder of their King and Queen,\r\nwith our joining Russia so very soon afterwards in a support of Servia\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary too absolute even for French concurrence.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury, he fully believed, had become acquainted in 1877, if not\r\nbefore, with the substance of an agreement between Russia and Austria\r\nwhich contemplated, amongst other things, the annexation by the latter\r\nof the Provinces; and it was perfectly clear, from what passed at the\r\nBerlin Congress, that in 1878, before the meeting, Lord Salisbury must\r\nhimself have concluded an engagement with Austria-Hungary, though the\r\nword \"annexation,\" no doubt, did not appear in it, and more general\r\nterms probably were used, but containing no reservation, and promising\r\nsupport to the Austrian policy in those Provinces. Technically the\r\nengagement might have lapsed with the treaty, and probably it had; but\r\nthe fact remained, with its moral consequences. Meanwhile Lord\r\nBeaconsfield had taken Cyprus from Turkey, and had given a greater shock\r\nto Europe, by the form and the secrecy of the proceedings, than could\r\npossibly attach to the recent unilateral action of Austria-Hungary.\r\nDuring the proceedings at Berlin, it must also be remembered, Lord\r\nSalisbury had practically promised Tunis to France. Turkish sovereignty\r\nwas technically, indeed, still maintained in Cyprus, as it also had been\r\nfor thirty years in Bosnia and the Herzegovina, [Footnote: See, on the\r\nwhole subject. Hanotaux, _La France Contemporaine_, vol. iv., pp. 314,\r\n363-370; _Etudes Diplomatiques: La Politique de l'Équilibre_, by the\r\nsame author, p. 184. A secret clause was signed on July 13th, 1878, by\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Plenipotentiaries, in which the occupation was\r\ndescribed as temporary and ordered to be the subject of a special\r\narrangement with Turkey. The secret clause was really made to save the\r\nface of the Turkish Plenipotentiaries on their return to\r\nConstantinople.] and as it was at that time in the Sudan; but at no time\r\ndid the Turks expect to see those territories again under their\r\neffective sovereignty. Insistence on the letter of the treaty also\r\nweakened our position in regard to Crete, where, as he had so frequently\r\ncontended, nobody could wish or believe the position made by the treaty\r\nto be permanent. Lastly, he insisted that the policy into which we had\r\nbeen drawn by M. Isvolski had been damaging to our interests, not only\r\nbecause it had strengthened the ties between the members of the Triple\r\nAlliance, but because it assisted the popularity in Germany of a naval\r\nrivalry, which oppressed us with the cost of ever-increased armaments at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey, he went on to say, had taken for his text the\r\ndeclaration of the London Conference of 1871 as to the denunciation by\r\nRussia, in 1870, of the Black Sea clauses of the treaty of 1856. But\r\nRussia got her way, and had practically been told she would get it on\r\nthe main question before the Conference met. When in 1885 Eastern\r\nRoumelia was swallowed by Bulgaria, all the Great Powers theoretically\r\nprotested, but nothing came of their remonstrance. In 1886 Russia broke\r\nthe article of the treaty which related to the port of Batoum; and Lord\r\nRosebery, no doubt, wrote a despatch based on the same doctrine as that\r\nnow adopted by Sir Edward Grey. But Lord Rosebery at least avoided\r\nintroducing new matters. His final despatch concluded with the words:\r\n\"It must be for other Powers to judge how far they can acquiesce in this\r\nbreach of an international engagement.\" Russia again succeeded. Why,\r\nthen, have complicated the original issue in the present case by joining\r\nwith Russia and France, at the instigation of the former, in putting\r\nforward suggestions to be considered at a European Conference for the\r\nterritorial expansion of Servia, if possible to the Adriatic, and in\r\nregard to the Danube, that thorniest of diplomatic subjects? [Footnote:\r\n\"L'indépendance des bouches du Danube est pour nous un dogme\" were the\r\nwords attributed to Count Andrassy in June, 1877 (Hanotaux, _La France\r\nContemporaine_, iv. 315). See, too, the opinion of Radetzki, quoted by\r\nRené Henry, _Questions d'Autriche-Hongrie_, p. 128.]\r\n\r\n\"Our action,\" Dilke argued, \"in such matters ought to be, as it\r\ngenerally is, to bring people together for public peace, and not to\r\ninterfere with matters where our interfering in details is certain to be\r\nresented. Of course, there was more than this in the German resistance.\r\nThat resistance was always, I think, certain. It was certain to be\r\nprovoked by common action on the part of the three Powers in such\r\nmatters, but it was doubly caused by the indiscreet language used, not\r\nby us, but by the Press, in support of the three Governments, and\r\nofficially in Russia. We heard talk about Russia having at last\r\ncompletely joined two Western Powers in an anti-Austrian movement, and\r\narticles headed 'Revelations of a New Triple Alliance' were calculated\r\nto intensify opposition on the part of Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\n    \"The net result has been a set-back, not so much for us as for our\r\n    supposed and suspected client, Servia. Servia has had her position\r\n    very much worsened by our interference on her behalf. It is\r\n    unfortunate that small Provinces in the Balkans should be in this\r\n    position, that when Powers who are not going to fight appear to take\r\n    up their cause against neighbouring Powers, however natural and wise\r\n    it may be in the abstract, the result is almost certain to be to\r\n    make their position worse; and undoubtedly there has been a set-\r\n    back, caused by us and Russia, to Servia. We have not even with us\r\n    our Mediterranean ally Italy, because Italy herself abstained from\r\n    supporting us in this matter, as she was bound to abstain under her\r\n    engagements. I therefore end this part of the matter by saying I\r\n    think we have set the doctrine of the sacredness of the Treaty of\r\n    Berlin, in the circumstances, too high. We have had two previous\r\n    examples of the risk of setting up that doctrine, and pressing it\r\n    too far, in such a case. We have tried to set it up on two previous\r\n    occasions, and have failed. The second of those two occasions, in\r\n    1886, is very clear. There was a distinct violation of an article of\r\n    the Treaty of Berlin, and of the protocol outside that article. Lord\r\n    Rosebery wrote a strong despatch with regard to that violation, and\r\n    he raised the same comparison of 1871 as we raised on this question,\r\n    but nothing happened. That is a very long time ago, and the Treaty\r\n    of Berlin has not become more sacrosanct since 1886 than it was at\r\n    that time, which was more near its conclusion. My main point is, we\r\n    have supported principles that we could not justifiably or wisely\r\n    support. If we had had any political or European idea behind us, any\r\n    idea of improving the conditions of peoples, or of giving greater\r\n    liberty to the peoples, the country would have been more inclined to\r\n    give support than it is on the mere bare doctrine of the sacredness\r\n    of a treaty. On the last occasion when these matters were discussed,\r\n    the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a most brilliant\r\n    speech on the Naval Vote of Censure. In that speech he defended what\r\n    is very near the old doctrine of the balance of power in Europe. No\r\n    one will take exception to his statement of the effect of the\r\n    existing balance upon our position in Europe. The danger is now, as\r\n    it was 100 years ago, and still more 120 or 130 years ago, that you\r\n    may be tempted by these understandings, which are good, to convert\r\n    them into something very near, but not quite, an alliance, and to\r\n    pursue a policy in support of the balance of power which will keep\r\n    you in permanent hot water all round with everybody, and will risk\r\n    war.\"\r\n\r\nHow far the belief in the existence of a policy of encirclement, as the\r\ncurrent phrase went, which existed in Germany from 1905 to 1909,\r\n[Footnote: See Hanotaux, _La Politique de l'Équilibre_, chap, xxiii.;\r\nReventlow, 279, 296-305; Baron Beyens, _L'Allemagne avant la Guerre_,\r\npp. 220-221.] was justified is a matter which the historian of the\r\nfuture will have to discuss. Certain it is, however, that the British\r\nForeign Office after 1909 gave no just cause of offence to Germany. The\r\ndisappointing outcome of supporting Russia in the negotiations connected\r\nwith Bosnia; the failure at this time of the Entente to produce any\r\nsatisfactory results in Crete and in various negotiations at\r\nConstantinople, where French policy was deemed to be influenced by\r\nconsiderations more financial than political; the friendly reception of\r\nKing Edward VII. at Berlin in February, 1909, and the great changes\r\nwhich death or retirement brought about, in the years immediately\r\nsucceeding, in the personnel of the Ministries of Germany, France,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy--amongst others the retirement of the\r\nGerman Chancellor--produced a new situation. [Footnote: Hanotaux, _La\r\nPolitique de l'Équilibre_, chap, xviii.; Reventlow, p. 339. Prince von\r\nBülow resigned on July 20th, 1909; M. Clemenceau on July 14th, 1909; M.\r\nIsvolski and M. Tittoni in October, 1910; and Count Aerenthal in\r\nFebruary, 1912.]\r\n\r\nIn 1910 things seemed to point again to the possibility of clearer\r\nskies. The negotiations between Germany and Great Britain in regard to\r\nthe Bagdad Railway and the still outstanding African questions were\r\nresumed, and proceeded without any serious hindrance. Favourable results\r\nseemed, and with good reason, to be in sight. There were also\r\nnegotiations between Germany and Russia. Thus it was that, a few days\r\nbefore he passed away, Sir Charles was justified in still writing in a\r\nhopeful strain that the Great War could and would be avoided--fortunate\r\nat least in this, that he did not live to see the breaking up of the\r\nfoundations of the great deep. [Footnote: In his recently published\r\nwork, _England and Germany_, 1740-1914, Mr. Bernadotte Schmitt says,\r\nspeaking of the beginning of the year 1911--prior, it is to be\r\nremembered, to the Agadir incident: \"In the early summer of 1911,\r\nAnglo-German relations, if not cordial, had lost much of the animosity\r\nengendered by the Bosnian troubles of 1908 and the naval scare of 1909.\r\nThe German Emperor had been well received when he attended the obsequies\r\nof his uncle, Edward VII., and again on the occasion of the unveiling of\r\nthe national monument to Queen Victoria in May, 1911. On the 13th of\r\nMarch of the same year, Sir Edward Grey had remarked upon the friendly\r\nrelations obtaining with all the Powers.... In Germany the death of\r\nEdward VII., who passed for the inspirer of the _Einkreisungs Politik_,\r\ncaused a feeling of relief.\" Speaking of the period immediately\r\npreceding the outbreak of the war, the same author observes: \"Whatever\r\nGermany's motives may have been, the fact remained that in July, 1914,\r\nAnglo-German relations were more cordial than they had been at any time\r\nsince the Boer War.... The tragedy of the Great War lies in the fact\r\nthat early in the summer of 1914 a substantial agreement had been\r\nreached between Great Britain and Germany on those matters about which\r\nthey had previously disagreed\" (pp. 195, 373). This book, by an American\r\nRhodes Scholar of the Western Reserve University, is a very valuable and\r\nimpartial contribution to the history of recent events. On the condition\r\nof things in 1911 and 1912, see also the despatches of Count Lalaing and\r\nBaron Beyens, from London and Berlin, to M. Davignon, the Belgian\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, published in the official German White\r\nbook, _Belgische Actenstücke_, 1905-1914, pp. 85, 113.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nTHE LAST YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nCall no man happy or unhappy, said the philosopher, till you see his\r\nend. With Sir Charles Dilke's life clear before us, if the question be\r\nput, \"Was he happy?\" only one answer can be given. He was happy. With a\r\npower of suffering which made bereavement poignant, with tragic\r\nexperience of disappointment and distress, he never lost the faculty of\r\nenjoyment: he touched the world at many points, and his contact was\r\ncomplete and vital.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the life that he lived after his second wife's death there\r\nwas nothing gloomy or half-hearted. At Pyrford and Dockett the same\r\ninterests continued to hold their charm, though in his home of homes,\r\nthe home that he did not make, but was born into, there was a change. At\r\n76, Sloane Street, he still slept, breakfasted, and did his morning's\r\nwork; but he would never willingly return there for dinner, except on\r\nvery rare occasions when he entertained guests, or spend the evening\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe still enjoyed the life of the House of Commons. Old friends were a\r\npleasure, new-comers a fresh spring of interest, and the younger men\r\nnaturally drew round this most willing teacher. One of the young\r\nLiberals [Footnote: Mr. A. F. Whyte, M.P.] who came within his influence\r\ndescribes the amazing interest of his talk, with its personal memories\r\nof the leading personalities in Europe during half a century past. But\r\nthe true attraction was something simpler than that. \"He made you\r\nextraordinarily fond of him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is implied in that very simple phrase has been set out by another\r\nfriend of an opposing political school, brought into touch with him by a\r\ncommon interest in Social Reform: [Footnote: Mr. J. W. Hills, M.P.]\r\n\r\n    \"What first brought us together I forget; I think it was some action\r\n    I took with regard to sweated trades. At any rate he asked me to\r\n    stay for a Sunday at Dockett Eddy; and after my first visit I went\r\n    often. For one thing, we were both devoted to rowing; he was, of\r\n    course, a far more distinguished and accomplished oarsman than I,\r\n    but he and I went extraordinarily well together in a pair. Everyone\r\n    who has rowed knows that pair-oar rowing is the most difficult, as\r\n    it is the most fascinating, form of the art. We had many long rows\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    \"The life at Dockett Eddy had an atmosphere and a colour different\r\n    from that of other houses. Breakfast was at a fairly early hour.\r\n    After breakfast, Dilke was invisible till lunch. Lunch was at 12.30,\r\n    French in character, and always, wet or fine, took place on the\r\n    broad verandah which ran along one side of the house. During the\r\n    afternoon Dilke rowed on the river, walked about the green and\r\n    winding paths of his beloved willow-clad island, and talked to his\r\n    friends. The prevailing recollection that I shall always have of\r\n    Dockett Eddy is good talk. No one who did not talk to Dilke knew the\r\n    man. His speeches--at any rate, from 1906 to his death--did not give\r\n    all his qualities. These came out in his talk. His amazing\r\n    knowledge, which occasionally overloaded his speeches and diverted\r\n    them from their main argument, wove itself naturally into the\r\n    texture of his talk and gave it a wonderful richness and depth. And\r\n    he talked to everybody and on all subjects; and to all he brought\r\n    his tremendous vitality and his vivid and many-sided personality.\r\n    You always felt that the whole force of the man was behind what he\r\n    said--the active, eager, questioning mind, determined to master all\r\n    facts that gave true knowledge, and when this was done, when all\r\n    facts were noted and weighed, coming to a conclusion which was both\r\n    clear-cut and unalterable. He was most tolerant of the views of\r\n    others, and never overwhelmed with greater knowledge; but all that\r\n    he had in him he gave freely and without stint. The talks I\r\n    recollect best are either on industrial conditions in other\r\n    countries, or on French history from 1848 onwards, or on English\r\n    politics. On French history I always listened to him with delight;\r\n    he not only knew literally every fact and every date, but he also\r\n    knew personally most of the great men who had latterly played\r\n    leading parts. On English politics it was characteristic of the man\r\n    to have a tremendous belief in the present. For instance, I said\r\n    something about the decadence of Parliament and Parliamentary\r\n    speaking. He at once burst out: 'You are quite wrong. The men of\r\n    to-day are much greater than their predecessors'; and then he went\r\n    through all our prominent politicians and compared them with the men\r\n    of the past. The only comparisons I remember are Winston Churchill\r\n    with his father, and Asquith with Disraeli and Gladstone, in each\r\n    instance to the advantage of the present generation.\r\n\r\n    \"Dilke was a great man, if ever there was one. He was a man of big\r\n    ideas, too big for prejudice or suspicion or self-interest. His mind\r\n    was at once imaginative and matter-of-fact, making him that rare\r\n    combination, a practical idealist. But the abiding memory which I\r\n    shall retain of him as long as I live is not his wide knowledge, his\r\n    singleness of purpose, his vital energy and driving force, so much\r\n    as the friendship he gave me. He put the whole of himself into his\r\n    friendship, and gave himself abundantly and without reserve. He was\r\n    so great a man, and meant so much to his friends, that he played a\r\n    large part in the lives of all he honoured with his regard. Though I\r\n    only knew him during the last three years, he filled so big a place\r\n    in my life that his death left a wide and empty gap. I regarded him\r\n    with love and veneration.\"\r\n\r\n\"He talked to everybody and on all subjects,\" and he talked to everybody\r\non a common ground of fellowship. Newman, the cabdriver at Shepperton,\r\nbeside whom he always insisted on sitting when he came to Dockett; Jim\r\nHaslett, his ferryman; Busby, his old gardener and lodge-keeper at\r\nPyrford: these no less than \"Bill\" East who rowed with him, and \"Fred\"\r\nMacpherson with whom he fenced, keep the same memory of his friendliness\r\nand of the pleasure that they had in being with him. For his\r\nconstituents he was more than a representative: he was their friend, a\r\npersonal influence, a centre of affection in the lives of many among\r\nthem. \"I hardly know what to do or say,\" wrote one of them after his\r\ndeath. \"For one man to say of another it seems strange, but I _loved_\r\nSir Charles.\"\r\n\r\nInto this affection there entered that peculiar tenderness of loyalty to\r\nthe wronged which finds fit expression in these words of his old\r\ncomrade, Judge Steavenson, who had known his life since they were young\r\nathletes together in the Trinity Hall boat: \"I loved him, my oldest and\r\nbest friend, and how I mourn him! The tragedy of his life has been pain\r\nand suffering to me for more years than I care to remember. Some say a\r\nlittle band of friends never wavered in their belief in his innocence. I\r\nam one, and so believing in good time I shall go to my grave.\"\r\n\r\nMany a brave man has under the sense of injustice grown hard and bitter;\r\nit was not so with Sir Charles. After his death a friend's widow wrote\r\nto one who mourned him: \"I should like to tell you how divinely kind he\r\nwas to me in my great grief.\" A lady who for long years had been on a\r\nbed of pain said of his visits to her: \"He seems to take your suffering\r\nfrom you and give it back to you on a higher plane. I think he\r\nunderstands because he has suffered so much himself.\"\r\n\r\nIn these last years after Lady Dilke's death, Sir Charles resumed, in\r\nsome moderate degree, the old habit of travel. From 1906 it grew to be\r\nan institution that, when the Trade-Union Congress closed its sittings\r\nin autumn, he should meet the editor of this book and her friend Miss\r\nConstance Hinton Smith, [Footnote: Who attended these Congresses as\r\nvisitors representing the Women's Trade-Union League.] and with them\r\nproceed leisurely from the trysting-place to Dean Forest for his annual\r\nvisit to the constituency. Thus in different years they set out from\r\nTewkesbury, from Bath, from Leicester, from Ipswich, and explored towns\r\nand country places of beauty or historic interest, under the guidance of\r\none who had the gift for placing every detail in its setting, whether on\r\nthe physical map of England or on that crowded chart which depicts the\r\nlong course of British history. For him these journeys were each a\r\nrevisiting of places seen before--seen, as he would often recall, under\r\nhis grandfather's guidance in boyhood.\r\n\r\nThe annual Christmas visit to Paris, where his son often joined him, was\r\nrevived in company of his secretary, Mr. Hudson, and his wife. In more\r\nthan one autumn, after his stay in the Forest of Dean was completed, he\r\nmade a journey through Switzerland to the Italian lakes. He journeyed\r\nunder a resolution not to visit any gallery of pictures, for these must\r\nrecall too poignantly the companionship which had made the special joy\r\nof all his picture-seeing. But he sent his companions that they might\r\ncompare their impressions with his memory, always astonishingly vivid\r\nand exact. The sights to which he gave himself were sun and air,\r\nmountain and lake. Here, as in England, trees especially appealed to\r\nhim, and in the famous garden of the Isola Madre on Lago Maggiore he\r\namazed the gardener by his acquaintance with all the collection, from\r\nthe various kinds of cypress and cedar down to the least impressive\r\nshrub. But what gave him most pleasure was the actual journeying,\r\nawakening not only associations with the places seen, but memories of\r\nother places in far-off corners of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the last year of his life the International Association for Labour\r\nLegislation met at Lugano, and he stopped there on his autumn tour. His\r\nhealth was already failing, he attended no meetings and received few\r\nvisitors; but experts in the subject, Ministers and ex-Ministers of\r\nLabour from Prussia, France, Canada, and other countries, sought him, to\r\nconsult him on points of international policy. Two years later, when the\r\nCongress met again at Zurich, M. Fontaine recalled the memory of Sir\r\nCharles and the \"conseils précieux\" which other workers drew from him in\r\ntheir interviews. It was only when the Congress was over that the\r\nholiday really began, with a day on Maggiore and two days on Orta,\r\nbefore the travellers made for their real destination, Aosta among its\r\nhills, a scene new to him as to them, that filled him with fresh life.\r\nAll about it charmed him: the mountains, the Roman gateways, the\r\nmediaeval cloisters, the long procession of the cattle coming down from\r\nthe hill-slopes during the night; the keen air gave him energy to walk\r\nas he had never thought to walk again; and, for a touch of familiar\r\nhumours, the landlord of the rough little inn where they stayed had been\r\nin his day a waiter in Willis's Rooms and remembered his guest among the\r\ndiners there.\r\n\r\nAn accident to one of his companions had caused him to go on alone, and,\r\naccordingly, when he came back to Turin to fetch them it was as a guide\r\nalready fully qualified. On the drive up from Ivrea, in a valley whence\r\ncan be seen at the same moment Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, and the glacier\r\nof the Gran Paradiso, he could show them the fort of Bard, blocking the\r\ngorge just as in the days when it checked Napoleon on his road to\r\nMarengo. But the memories awakened in him were not only of Napoleon; the\r\nvalley of the Dora Baltea was a complete image of the Khyber Pass, and\r\nBard the very counterpart of Ali Musjid.\r\n\r\nAs they came home through France, halt was made at Lyons, and, though he\r\nrefused to see the gallery, he could describe almost every canvas and\r\nthe place where it hung; but best of all he remembered Charlet's great\r\npicture of the retreat from Moscow and the army that \"dragged itself\r\nalong like a wounded snake.\" In Paris, too, on that homeward journey a\r\nstop was made, and since few of his friends were yet back from the\r\ncountry, there was more theatre-going than usual. Guitry, his favourite\r\nactor, was not playing, but Brasseur and Eve la Vallière amused him, and\r\nhe found special delight in the _Mariage de Mademoiselle Beulemans_. Yet\r\nnot even the acting of Jaques as the good-natured, choleric old Belgian\r\nbrewer could induce him to depart from his practice of going away after\r\nthe first act.\r\n\r\nThree times in the last years of his life he went back to Provence. The\r\nfirst of these visits was in the January of 1909, and he with his\r\ncompanions set out from Paris on the last day of the old year,\r\ntravelling by motor-car in defiance of heavy snow and frost. These made\r\nobstacles which only gave piquancy to his journey through scenes where\r\nstories of the Franco-German War crowded to his tongue, and when\r\ndifficulties delayed the car he struck up wayside intimacies--once with\r\nan old non-commissioned officer now transformed into a _Garde\r\nChampêtre_, anon with a peasant couple from whose cottage he begged hot\r\nwater to make tea. In one such household, arriving with beard and\r\nmoustache frozen white, he announced himself to the children of the\r\nfamily group as Father Christmas, and made good his claim with\r\ndistribution of little gifts.\r\n\r\nAt Hyères he was rejoined by the old servant, once his gardener and\r\nvine-dresser, who had marketed the produce of La Sainte Campagne in the\r\ndays when Sir Charles was trading, like any other petty Provençal\r\nlandowner, in grapes and artichokes, mimosa and roses and violets, for\r\nthe Toulon market. That former life lived again in his talk as he\r\nrecalled those whom he had known in his Provençal home: neighbours,\r\nservants, local politicians; and from his hotel at Hyères he never\r\nfailed to make excursions to Toulon, and to visit his old friend and\r\nsometime man of business, M. Bertrand, who would carry him to the café\r\nfrequented by the leading citizens, to feast on a Provençal déjeuner\r\nwith red mullet and bouillabaisse. Another recurring visit was to Émile\r\nOllivier at La Moutte, his beautiful seaward-facing house on the\r\npromontory beyond Saint Tropez.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Dilke\" had friends everywhere in that corner of the world. His near\r\nneighbour at Cap Brun, M. Noël Blache, leader of the local bar, a famous\r\nteller of Provençal stories and declaimer of Provençal verse, said of\r\nhim: \"He knows our country and our legends better than we know them\r\nourselves.\" In the years during which he lived for part of the\r\ntwelvemonth at Toulon he had followed every winding of the coast, had\r\nexplored all the recesses of the hills.\r\n\r\n\"It is my boast, probably vain,\" he wrote to M. André Chevrillon in\r\n1909, \"to have invented the Mountains of the Moors. Sizeranne had been\r\nstaying there for six weeks before he came into the British Hyères, but,\r\n_he_, only on the coast. When I first showed that coast to Émile\r\nOllivier, Noël Blache, then President of the Conseil-Général of the Var,\r\nand Félix Martin, the latter advised the narrow-gauge railway which\r\nruined the politicians of the Var, and became 'le Panama du Midi.' My\r\njourney this time was to assure myself that the road and railway along\r\nthe coast had not spoilt the _interior_. They have improved indeed, and\r\nI was glad, a road from the entrance to the forest on the main road from\r\nHyères to Cogolin, turning to the north over two cols to Collobrières.\r\nThe T.C.F. has made a road from Collobrières up the hill to the\r\nsouth-east, whence the walk to La Chartreuse de la Verne is easy. I used\r\nto have to reach that spot from Campo, the police post on the stream,\r\ncalled Campeaux upon the maps. The whole forest is unharmed. It is\r\nunknown to the British inhabitants of Hyères. Not one had been there,\r\nor, I think, heard of it; and I met no human creature upon some twelve\r\nmiles of the finest parts of the improved road. Grimaud, at the other\r\nend, I have no doubt you know. It was the Moorish capital. I went there\r\nthe day that I lunched with Émile Ollivier this time. There was a foot\r\nof ice on the top, at La Garde-Freinet, and one looked back, down on to\r\nGrimaud, standing baked by an African sun, and could make out the ripe\r\noranges and the heads of the great cactus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does not someone 'discover' France?\" he writes to M. Joseph\r\nReinach. \"How few Frenchmen know the sunset view _north_ from St. Tropez\r\nin January!\" And again to M. Chevrillon in 1909: \"I adore the solitude\r\nof Sainte Baume, and believe in Marie Madeleine--except her head and\r\ntomb at St. Maxime, where Brutus Bonaparte helped keep the inn.\r\n[Footnote: The eldest of the Bonapartes was not the only person of the\r\nNapoleonic days as to whom stories were told in the neighbourhood.\r\nDésirée Clary was said to have lived at the inn of St. Maxime, and Sir\r\nCharles wrote to Mr. Morley concerning La Sainte Campagne: \"My old\r\ncottage is supposed to be that where Murat was concealed after the 100\r\ndays.\"] Intellect is represented here by Robert de la Sizeranne, _but_\r\nit is only two and a half hours in motor or two and a half by rail to La\r\nMoutte, where I make É. Ollivier read his fourteenth volume!\"\r\n\r\nAll the little hill towns were known to him, and their history; he could\r\nshow the spot at Cavalaire where the Moorish lords of Provence trained\r\ntheir famous horses; he knew the path at Le Lavandou, worn into the\r\nsolid rock by the bare feet of countless generations. It irked him that\r\nthe plain of Fréjus was spoilt by the intrusion of white villas on what\r\nhad once been called \"a better Campagna.\" But these changes were of the\r\nsurface only. Provence was still Provence, its people still unchanged\r\nfrom the days when Gambetta said to Sir Charles of one who projected a\r\nwatercourse at Nice: \"Jamais il ne coulera par cette rivière au tant\r\nd'eau qu'il n'en dépensera de salive à en parler.\" There was still the\r\nlocal vintage in every inn, still the _beurre du berger_, the cheese and\r\nthe conserves of fruit which every housewife in Provence sets out with\r\npride in her own making; still the thin breeze of the mistral through\r\nthe tree-tops, still the long white roads running between fields of\r\nviolets and narcissi, and still white farmhouses among the terraced\r\noliveyards and vines. All these things were an abiding joy, but a\r\ngreater joy than all, and still more unchangeable, was the daily\r\noncoming of light, the subtle flush and gradations of colour before the\r\nsun rose from that beloved sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1908 Sir Charles's health had been very bad, and he risked\r\nhis life in attending the annual miners' meeting at the Speech House,\r\nleaving Dockett Eddy, as his custom was, at six in the morning, and\r\nreturning home the same night. But by the following year he had regained\r\nhis physical condition and his cheerfulness. The aspect of politics,\r\ntoo, had been transfigured. Speaking to his constituents in September,\r\n1909, he reminded them how a year earlier the Liberal party had been\r\ndespondent.\r\n\r\n    'This year all of them felt that the Government, with the country\r\n    behind it--for the country was thoroughly behind the Government in\r\n    the matter of the Budget--had taken, not only a new lease of life,\r\n    but had adopted an attitude which on the whole, apart from any\r\n    little doubts in reference to particular details, commanded a\r\n    confident and an enthusiastic support on the part of a wider\r\n    majority of people than any other movement of modern times.'\r\n\r\nHe told them of his own objections to the famous Budget--one in regard\r\nto the cider duty, upon which he had carried his point, the other to the\r\nincreased tax on tobacco, which he had unsuccessfully resisted. So long\r\nas tea and tobacco were taxed as they were, the working classes, in his\r\njudgment, paid more than their just proportion. Still, a great stride\r\nforward had been taken. As for the House of Lords throwing out the\r\nBudget, \"those who did not like that Chamber wanted that fight, but it\r\ndid not seem to him natural that the House of Lords would desire it,\r\nbecause it appeared to him to be a fight in which the Peers were\r\nperfectly certain to be beaten.\" Nevertheless it came to pass, a General\r\nElection followed, and the huge independent Liberal majority\r\ndisappeared. Sir Charles was active to keep together the various\r\nsections which most desired to limit the power of the House of Lords,\r\nand on February 22nd, 1910, he, on behalf of the Radicals, held an\r\ninterview with the Labour and Irish leaders together, to ascertain and\r\ndiscuss the line of action contemplated. Also, since there was a\r\nproposal that Government should, as a matter of urgency, oust private\r\nmembers and take all the time of the House, he saw Mr. J. S. Sandars,\r\nMr. Balfour's chief private secretary, and in Sir Charles's phrase\r\n\"factotum,\" to find out what the Opposition was going to do.\r\n\r\nIn the debates upon the Government's Resolutions which laid the\r\nfoundation for the Parliament Act, Sir Charles took no part. The matter\r\nhad gone as he desired.\r\n\r\nBy April the Resolutions were adopted; but before action by Bill could\r\nbe begun, the Parliamentary struggle was suspended by the death of King\r\nEdward. In that national loss Sir Charles Dilke felt special sorrow.\r\nWhether as Prince of Wales or as King, the dead Sovereign had\r\nconsistently shown him, not merely consideration, but friendship. It was\r\namong the satisfactions of Sir Charles's last years of life that the\r\nprinciple, for which he had incurred odium by contending forty years\r\nearlier, now came to be fully recognized as that most respectful to the\r\nCrown. Lord Knollys writes that on the accession of King Edward VII.,\r\nSir Charles had called and \"offered to support any reasonable Civil List\r\nwhich might be proposed.\" A Civil List Committee was appointed, on which\r\nSir Charles served, and the result of its deliberations was to recommend\r\na discontinuance of occasional grants from Parliament to members of the\r\nRoyal Family. It did not, indeed, go to the length of making adequate\r\nprovision for the family and leaving its distribution to the King, which\r\nwas what Sir Charles always recommended; but it moved far in that\r\ndirection, and to that extent carried out his views.\r\n\r\nThe royal funeral brought to London another Sovereign with whom Sir\r\nCharles had friendly personal relations, and the last page in his Memoir\r\ntells of a 'long talk with King George of Greece at Buckingham Palace.'\r\nThe King was inclined to deprecate the summoning of a National Assembly\r\nfor that autumn. He called it \"stupid,\" whereat, says Sir Charles,\r\n'blank look on my part.' Then, after a pause ('whereas till then we had\r\ntalked in a perpetual duet'), the King went on to admit that the\r\nNational Assembly was his own creation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was against it at first because we can do by law already\r\neverything that is to be done by the National Assembly. But I saw that\r\nit was the only way out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad, Sir,\" Sir Charles quickly rejoined, \"that I was not\r\n'stupid,' for I attributed the invention to\" (and he pointed) \"its\r\nauthor.\"\r\n\r\nThe King, however, was afraid that some might \"blame him,\" and when Sir\r\nCharles answered, \"No one,\" he quoted the phrase once applied to him:\r\n\"Bon petit roi, manque d'énergie.\" The reply was: \"I don't know who said\r\nthat, Sir! Your prestige is exactly opposite to the German Emperor's\r\nprestige, but equally important to your country and to peace. It may\r\nhave been a fool who said it, but it was probably chaff.\"\r\n\r\n\"... My family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, that is chaff--that is what I meant by chaff.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Charles took occasion to tell a very important member of the\r\n\"family\" that \"Berlin and Athens were different.\"\r\n\r\nWhen autumn came, the sitting of the Constitutional Conference silenced\r\nSir Charles and all men who desired a fair field for that great\r\nexperiment. Its failure precipitated a new General Election.\r\n\r\nBy this time there was no doubt in Sir Charles's mind as to the gravity\r\nof his physical condition. To a friend, who in October was setting out\r\nfor extended travel in West Africa, he wrote these words in a letter\r\nwishing him God-speed:\r\n\r\n    \"You are much more likely to come back alive than I am to be alive\r\n    to welcome you. Yet I _hope_ that the less likely survival _may_ be,\r\n    and of the other I feel pretty sure.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing what he did of his own health, knowing the loyalty of his\r\nconstituents, who had within a few months returned him by a majority of\r\nover two thousand, he might well have consented, as his friends wished,\r\nto fight the new election by deputy. It was not his way. Haggard and\r\nphysically oppressed, he spent a fortnight in that bitter December going\r\nthe round of meetings, addressing his supporters as best his bodily\r\nweakness allowed that strong will and fine courage to have their way.\r\nThe result was foregone: his majority was triumphant; but the exertion\r\nkilled him. None the less, he came out of the fray jubilant; his side\r\nhad won, the victory had been decisive. In Paris, where he went with Mr.\r\nHudson, the journalists came to him for his accustomed review of the\r\ntotal situation. \"Depuis que je suis au Parlement, je n'ai pas connu un\r\nMinistère aussi solide que le Ministère présidé par M. Asquith,\" was his\r\nemphatic word to M. Leudet in the _Figaro_.\r\n\r\nThe strain had in no way impaired his intellectual vitality. Those of\r\nhis old friends who saw him, such as M. Reinach, had never known him\r\nmore animated. To M. André Chevrillon, a newer friend by whom he had\r\nbeen greatly attracted, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I see in the _Times_ that you are writing on Russian literature and\r\n    _music_. Please, then, include _Bell_ music: a saint's eve at\r\n    Troitsa Sergeifski! The silver notes floating in the dusty--or the\r\n    frozen--air. I've been there in September, and I've been there in\r\n    December.\r\n\r\n    \"Any chance of seeing you--without moving, for I'm suffering from\r\n    weak heart, after two winter-contested elections in one year? I'm\r\n    extraordinarily better to-day, but am apt to 'blow' in other than\r\n    the Australian sense.\"\r\n\r\nM. Chevrillon has written his impression of the gravity which lay behind\r\nthat cheery tone.\r\n\r\n    \"J'allai le voir à l'Hôtel St. James. Je n'oublierai jamais\r\n    l'impression que m'a laissée cette visite. II était d'une pâleur de\r\n    marbre; il m'a dit brièvement qu'il se savait en danger immédiat,\r\n    que le médecin l'avait averti; et tout de suite, quittant ce sujet,\r\n    il m'a parlé avec son animation, sa verve et sa précision habituelle\r\n    de la situation politique en Angleterre. II y avait ce jour--là sur\r\n    cette noble figure toute blême, une dignité, j'ose dire une majesté,\r\n    extraordinaire; il était déjà marqué par la mort; il la regardait\r\n    venir avec une tranquillité et un courage absolu; j'emportai de\r\n    cette visite le douloureux sentiment que je ne le reverrais pas, et\r\n    une admiration qui me restera toujours pour ce que je venais\r\n    d'entrevoir de son caractère.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Paris he insisted on moving South once more. He travelled now as an\r\ninvalid; but when morning light came into the compartment where he lay,\r\nhe made his way to the window and beheld again cypress and olive,\r\nsun-baked swarthy soil, little hills with rocky crests fantastically\r\nchiselled, all bathed in the dazzling sunshine of the South. Leaning his\r\nface against the window, he said: \"Provence always plays up.\"\r\n\r\nAt Hyères he was kept in bed. But he still read the books that came to\r\nhim by post, still dictated his reviews for the _Athenaeum_, and still\r\nenjoyed the reading aloud of French plays, which had become a habit of\r\nholiday time. And, above all, from his window as he lay he watched with\r\ndelight unjaded the spectacle of sea and sky. \"Am I not a fortunate\r\ninvalid,\" he said, \"to have the most beautiful view in the world to look\r\nat?\"\r\n\r\nNow and then his shout of laughter would be heard and the old spirit of\r\nfun would assert itself. When the journey home in January, 1911, had to\r\nbe faced, he rallied for it, came to the restaurant on the train, and\r\nduring the crossing sat on deck with Miss Constance Smith, who writes:\r\n\r\n    \"At that time his thoughts seemed to stray from this last journey\r\n    back to that which we had taken in the autumn. 'It is worth while,'\r\n    he said, 'to have seen Aosta. I am glad to have done it. It is not\r\n    often at my age that one can get so much pleasure out of a new\r\n    thing.' I think he had a double motive in mentioning Aosta. He put\r\n    it forward partly to obliterate for me the sadness of the past three\r\n    weeks by raising the memory of the pleasant times that lay behind.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he reached London he was happy to be again at home and he felt\r\nbetter. Those with him had no fear for the immediate future, and he\r\nhimself fully expected to take his place in Parliament when it met.\r\nFriends would have induced him to consider what part of his work could\r\nbe abandoned, but his answer was peremptory: \"I won't be kept alive to\r\ndo nothing.\" Confined to bed as he was, work still went on; he received\r\nand answered letters, read and annotated Blue-books. Curiously and\r\nalmost dramatically, the occupations of these last days sifted\r\nthemselves out in such fashion that the very latest things he handled\r\nbecame, in some sort, an epitome of his life's work. M. Michelidakis,\r\nPresident of the Cretan Executive Committee, had written to complain, on\r\nbehalf of the Cretan people, that the last note of the Powers seemed to\r\nreverse their policy of slowly transferring Crete to a local government.\r\nOn January 24th Sir Charles answered this appeal for his help. It was\r\nthe last letter that he signed with his own hand--fit close to a\r\nlifelong championship.\r\n\r\nOther clients were knocking at his door that same day, other voices from\r\nthat strange retinue of petitioners who brought from all quarters of the\r\nworld to this one man their cry for protection and redress. What they\r\nasked was no romantic action, nothing stirring or picturesque, but\r\nsimply the weight of his authority exhibited on their side, and the\r\nwisdom of his long practice in public life for their guidance. He was to\r\nfix a date for introducing a deputation concerning certain grievances of\r\nthe coloured people in Jamaica, and was to advise upon the best way to\r\nraise a number of minor West African questions in the new Parliament.\r\nHis answer was sent from 76, Sloane Street:\r\n\r\n    _January 24th_, 1911.\r\n\r\n    \"I am still lying up, but I think that I could answer any ordinary\r\n    call to duty, and I am trying a small private meeting to-morrow\r\n    afternoon, though I shall return to bed here.\r\n\r\n    \"I will note Thursday, 2nd, at noon, on the chance of being well\r\n    enough.\r\n\r\n    \"The questions which personally interest me the most are those\r\n    affecting the concessionary companies, and I should be glad if you\r\n    would ask Wedgwood to keep very close touch with me on these. He\r\n    likes me, and is quite willing to show me things; but he does too\r\n    much and, like myself, is always tired, and the result is that he\r\n    has to be reminded as to consultation in advance, though he does not\r\n    mind this being done.\r\n\r\n    \"I doubt there being much danger about the Gambia. As for the\r\n    Southern Nigerian ordinances, I am not competent, and have a general\r\n    impression that as a rule we do best on more general lines, though\r\n    some of the concessionary companies make such 'cases' as to form\r\n    exceptions.\"\r\n\r\nHis strength was far spent. This letter, says Mr. Hudson, writing two\r\ndays later to the President of the Aborigines' Protection Society, \"he\r\nasked me to sign, after wishing to sign himself.\"\r\n\r\nYet the brain was clear and the will unshaken. The \"small private\r\nmeeting\" of which he wrote was a committee of directors of the\r\n_Gardeners' Chronicle_, and on the 25th he was preparing to rise and\r\ndress to attend this, but was persuaded to go back to bed. In bed, he\r\nwas still busy reading and marking Blue-books which bore upon the case\r\nof the unorganized workers. The papers so prepared were, by his\r\ndirection, set aside for the service of the Women's Trade-Union League.\r\nThey were delivered next morning, but the messenger who took them\r\ncarried with them the tidings of Sir Charles Dilke's death. He had\r\nslipped suddenly out of life, his heart failing, soon after four o'clock\r\non the morning of Thursday, January 26th, 1911.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the funeral service at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, on January 30th,\r\nthere came from the House of Commons members of the Cabinet and of the\r\nMinistry, representatives of Liberalism and Labour, the Irish leader\r\nwith several of his colleagues, while from the Unionist benches also men\r\npaid this tribute to an honoured opponent. But the Parliamentary figure\r\nof most interest was Mr. Austen Chamberlain, who carried from a\r\nsick-room to the graveside the farewell of old comrade to old comrade.\r\n\r\nAmong the congregation were men who had been official representatives of\r\ngreat dominions of the Empire or of foreign Governments. These came in\r\ntheir private capacity, but one nation as a nation was represented\r\nthere. The King of the Hellenes sent his Minister in London to be his\r\ndeputy, and the Greek Government ordered a wreath, the token of their\r\nsorrow and gratitude, to be laid upon the bier.\r\n\r\nTributes poured in from the great mass of his fellow-countrymen; from\r\nphilanthropic societies; from those who, in or out of Parliament, had\r\nworked with his help and guidance. But above all there were messages\r\nfrom every trade union and organization of wage-earners, letters from\r\nmen and from women in every kind of employ, testifying of service done,\r\nof infinitely varied knowledge, of devotion that knew no limit, and that\r\nhad not gone without the one reward acceptable to the man they honoured,\r\ntheir responsive love and gratitude.\r\n\r\nSo closed a life across which many commentators of the moment wrote,\r\nsome lightly, some in sincere regret, the word Failure. It was\r\nill-chosen. They should have written Loss. His career had not fulfilled\r\nthe promise of its opening; his abilities had never found the full scope\r\nwhich once seemed assured to them; he had done for his country only what\r\nhis country permitted him to do. Over this it was natural, it was\r\nreasonable, to speak words of sorrow. Those who said--and there were not\r\na few who said it--that he had accomplished more out of office than he\r\ncould ever have achieved in office, paid a tribute to the greatness of\r\nhis work, but they did not understand the force which had been wasted.\r\nHe combined two gifts rarely found in combination--the gift of\r\nParliamentary leadership and a profound knowledge of foreign affairs.\r\nAmongst the men of his time he stood out as essentially a House of\r\nCommons man, but he was also a European personality. In these\r\ncharacteristics he recalls Lord Palmerston. Whether to foreign or to\r\ndomestic affairs, he brought a knowledge, a judgment, and a mastery of\r\ndetail, which none of his contemporaries surpassed and few equalled; and\r\nhe added to these the priceless gift of tact in dealing with men and\r\nwith bodies of men. In the only Parliament which knew him as an\r\nadministrator his advance was rapid and decisive: five years placed him\r\nby universal admission in the front rank; and yet the general opinion\r\nwas not less clear than that of the few great ones. Beaconsfield and\r\nBismarck singled him out by their special interest; Gladstone looked to\r\nhim as probably his own ultimate successor.\r\n\r\nThen came the day when there was taken from him for ever the opportunity\r\nof directing great affairs, and Sir Charles Dilke's career must be\r\nnumbered among things that might have been. Yet was his \"the failure\"?\r\n\"It was England's misfortune, and perhaps her fault,\" wrote one\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Spenser Wilkinson.] who knew him intimately and shared\r\nbut few of his political opinions, \"that she could thus have been\r\ndeprived of the services of one of her best statesmen.\"\r\n\r\nAll that he could do to repair the misfortune to his country was done\r\nwithout stint. Dismissed from his high command by a scandal, the truth\r\nof which he persistently denied, when a life of ease was open to him he\r\nchose, in spite of obloquy, to return to the ranks. Of what he\r\naccomplished in the ranks some outline has been given; its record stands\r\nas an answer to those who think, as many are tempted to think, that work\r\nin Parliament without office is, in these days, foredoomed to futility.\r\n\r\nYet not in the external results of his wisdom and his labour, but in\r\nanother sphere, lies his supreme achievement. The same fate which\r\nobscured the statesman's greatness revealed, what prosperity must have\r\nhidden, the full measure of the man. To have requited public contumely\r\nwith public service; in the midst of humiliation to have kept his nature\r\nunspoilt, unimbittered, every faculty bright and keen; to have abated no\r\njot of his happiness; and at the last to have passed away in serene\r\ndignity, all the voices of reproach hushed and overawed--this was not\r\ndefeat, but victory; this, complete in its fulfilment, was the triumph\r\nof Sir Charles Dilke's life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nLITERARY WORK AND INTERESTS\r\n\r\n[Footnote: By Miss Constance Hinton Smith.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo view of Sir Charles Dilke's life can be complete which fails to take\r\naccount of his literary interests and activities. He disclaimed the\r\ntitle of man of letters. [Footnote: 'Except in editing some of my\r\ngrandfather's papers, I never myself at all ventured into the paths of\r\npure literature; but I have lived near enough to it and them ... to be\r\nable to enjoy.'] Except for the little memoir of his second wife, all\r\nthe books he gave to the world, as well as the larger part of his\r\nperiodical writing, were inspired by political, though not by party,\r\nconsiderations. And throughout the years of his public career the\r\npressure of daily work inside and outside Parliament left him small\r\nleisure for reading other than that through which he kept himself\r\nacquainted with every movement, and as far as was humanly possible with\r\nevery fact, that seemed to bear upon the wide range of subjects handled\r\nby him. So prodigious was his industry, however--only Dominie Sampson's\r\nadjective will serve--and so quick his faculty for detecting at a glance\r\nthe quality of a book and extracting from it the pith and marrow, that\r\neven in the busiest periods of his life he contrived to keep abreast of\r\nthe things best worth knowing, not only in English, but also in French\r\nliterature. From the time when, by his father's death, he inherited the\r\nproprietorship of the _Athenaeum_, he exercised, through that journal, a\r\ndefinite if indirect influence in the maintenance of the high standards\r\nof literary honesty, accuracy, and taste in which he had been brought\r\nup. This was done partly by means of his own contributions to the paper,\r\nwhich covered a field which included history, travel, art, poetry, and\r\narchaeology in two languages, and partly through \"his comments and\r\nsuggestions on the proofs,\" of which Mr. C. A. Cook, a former acting\r\neditor, writes with abiding gratitude. Other newspaper proprietors have\r\ndoubtless done as much to preserve uniformity of tone and principle;\r\nfew, if any, have probably brought such close and unwearied care to bear\r\nupon those details in which tone is audible and principle expresses\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke's attitude towards literature, like his attitude to\r\npolitics and art, was peculiar to himself. He judged books, as he judged\r\nmen, not by the conventional verdict of the world--in this case the\r\nworld of critics--but by the quality his own mind discerned in them. His\r\njudgments, therefore, were personal judgments, uncoloured, as far as\r\nhuman judgments can be, by traditional respect or prejudice. This does\r\nnot mean that he had no literary canons: his grandfather's pupil could\r\nhardly have left old Mr. Dilke's hands so unfurnished; but he never\r\nbecame the slave of a rule or the docile worshipper of any reputation,\r\nhowever well established. This mental freedom was partly due to\r\nintellectual courage. The humour of Lamb, for example, delights the\r\nmajority of educated Englishmen: it had no charm for Sir Charles, and he\r\nwas not afraid to say so. But his liberty of appreciation owed something\r\nalso to the circumstances of his education. The fact that he had never\r\nbeen at a public school--thus missing, in the plastic years of a\r\nsensitive boyhood, the influences which make most strongly for\r\nconventionality of outlook among men of a certain class--made it easier\r\nfor him than it might otherwise have been to examine literary questions\r\nwith his own eyes, and not through the medium of special glasses imposed\r\nby authority. By the time he went up to Cambridge this habit of judging\r\nfor himself was already formed; and although Cambridge did much to\r\nmould, she did not remake him.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of his published writings, apart from those contributed to\r\nmagazines and newspapers, is brief. It consists practically of the early\r\nbook that made him famous as a political thinker, _Greater Britain_; the\r\nbrilliant satire, _Prince Florestan_, published anonymously in 1874, of\r\nwhich he subsequently acknowledged the authorship; and the few volumes\r\nwritten after the close of his official career, each of which deals with\r\nlarge questions of public and international interest. _Problems of\r\nGreater Britain_ and _Imperial Defence_ (the latter written in\r\ncollaboration with Mr. Spenser Wilkinson) were the most important of\r\nthese works, which do not represent fully the literary ambition of his\r\nearlier years. There is plenty of evidence in the Memoir to show that,\r\nat the time of that journey round the world of which _Greater Britain_\r\nwas the result, he had not only formed, but had begun to carry out,\r\nseveral literary projects. Some of these, essays in verse, story-\r\nwriting, and metaphysical speculation, belong to the category of\r\nexperiment or amusement, and represent nothing more than the natural\r\nactivity of a fertile mind trying its powers now in this direction, now\r\nin that. Others are more characteristic: a History of Radicalism, a\r\nPolitical Geography, a book to be called _The Anglo-Saxon Race_ or _The\r\nEnglish World_, and a work on _International Law_. [Footnote: See\r\nChapter VI. (Vol. I.)]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1878 he was 'working hard at' a _History of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ 'for three or four months' in Provence, 'besides managing to do\r\nsome little work towards it when I was in London.' At this time he was\r\nengaged upon the History of Germany in the early part of his chosen\r\nperiod, and was corresponding with Professor Seeley as the highest\r\nauthority on that subject.\r\n\r\n    'My history of events began with 1814. I showed that the doctrine of\r\n    nationality had been made use of for their own purposes by the Kings\r\n    in 1812-13, and crushed by them at congresses between 1814 and 1822,\r\n    and then appealed to by the revolutionary party in 1823, and in a\r\n    less degree in 1848. That doctrine of nationality was described even\r\n    in our own times by Heine as a dead thing, when it was yet destined\r\n    to prove, in 1859 and 1866 and 1870 and 1878, the phenomenon of the\r\n    century, and nowhere to work such change as in Heine's own Germany.\r\n    Heine thought that the idea of the emancipation of nationality had\r\n    already in his day been replaced by the emancipation of humanity;\r\n    but, whatever may be the case in the long-run, the emancipation of\r\n    nationalities was destined to prove the more lasting side of the\r\n    movement of 1848.'\r\n\r\nAfter stating that the nineteenth century must be held to have begun in\r\n1814, he writes:\r\n\r\n    'History to me was one and could know no commencements, yet in the\r\n    development of a concerted action of the Powers I found 1814 so\r\n    convenient a starting-point as to be as good as a real beginning. In\r\n    the rise of the new society, the social revolution,'\r\n\r\nhe found himself less fortunate. There was no clear starting-point, and\r\nwhen he selected August 4th, 1789, as his,\r\n\r\n    'I felt that I chose only the moment of the springing of the plant\r\n    from the soil ... and stood in some danger of neglecting the\r\n    previous germination of the seed beneath the soil.'\r\n\r\nAfter delivering a lecture on \"Old Chelsea,\" in which 'I made a\r\nconsiderable attempt to clear up some points in the life of Sir Thomas\r\nMore, for whom I have a great admiration ... I conceived ... the idea of\r\nwriting a Life of More, whose life has never been well told since it was\r\nwritten by his son-in-law at the time; but the immense difficulty of\r\nwriting any Life which would stand a comparison with the son-in-law's\r\nnotes ultimately deterred me.'\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why the foregoing projects were dropped; but\r\nwhy Sir Charles never published the book on Russia which he was known to\r\nhave had in preparation is not so apparent. He had paid four protracted\r\nvisits to the country, travelled over a great part of it, and was\r\nintimately acquainted with Russians of the most widely differing\r\nopinions. Obviously he would have enjoyed writing the book that he had\r\nplanned. He had actually fixed the date of publication, when he found\r\nthat Mr. Hepworth Dixon had come, almost at the same time, to a decision\r\nto write on his subject. On August 3rd, 1869, he wrote to Mr. Dixon:\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Dixon,\r\n\r\n    \"In reference to your request that in good feeling and friendship\r\n    towards you I should defer the publication of my _Russia_ from\r\n    February 1st, 1870 (the date fixed with Macmillan), to a later\r\n    period, I have carefully thought the matter over, and have decided\r\n    to do as you wish. The only condition that I make is that you will\r\n    write to me by return of post saying whether, if I fix January 1st,\r\n    1871, as my day, you will date your preface not later than February\r\n    1st, 1870, and issue your first edition not more than a week after\r\n    that date.\"\r\n\r\nDixon wrote back on the same day:\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Charles,\r\n\r\n    \"I am more pleased at your resolution than words can say. It is more\r\n    than right. It is friendly and noble.\"\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Dixon immediately went to Russia, where we met in the course of\r\n    the autumn, and speedily published his _New Russia_, a remarkable\r\n    book considering the haste with which it was prepared. After five\r\n    visits to Russia, I handed over the whole of my notes to my brother,\r\n    who spent two years at one time in that country, and who finished\r\n    the book.' [Footnote: Only two chapters ever appeared--in\r\n    magazines.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles's contributions to the _Athenaeum_ began while he was still\r\nat Cambridge. His article of October 22nd, 1864, [Footnote: See Chapter\r\nV. (Vol. I.)] was the first of a long series of reviews and notices,\r\nwhich continued unbrokenly till within a week of his death. It was\r\nnatural that, as years went by, his knowledge and experience should be\r\ndrawn upon for reviews of important political biographies, and of books\r\non imperial and colonial questions or military history. But he did not\r\nconfine himself entirely to such grave topics. The files of the\r\n_Athenaeum_ contain many columns from his hand dealing with the lighter\r\nmatters of topography (especially in France), travel, and fiction. The\r\nfiction was mainly French, modern English novels commending themselves\r\nlittle to his liking, though he was among the earliest and steadiest, if\r\nalso among the more discriminating, admirers of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, and\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson's _Prince Otto_ had a place with his favourite\r\nbooks. Another subject which attracted his pen was the local and\r\nlegendary history of his beloved Provence. His intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the beliefs and fancies of that region could be gathered from his\r\nslightest notice of an ephemeral book on the country, as readily as his\r\nstore of political knowledge and familiarity with the events that made\r\nhistory in his time from an extended review of a volume of _L'Empire\r\nLibéral_ or the life of a leading contemporary in the House of Commons.\r\nIn neither case could his hand be hid.\r\n\r\nIn influencing the choice of contributors to his paper, he threw his\r\nweight always on the side of the man who had complete knowledge of his\r\nsubject. No brilliancy of style could make up in his eyes for lack of\r\nprecision in thought or inaccuracy in statement. Next in order he\r\nappeared to value in a reviewer a judicial quality of mind, as essential\r\nto a sane and balanced criticism. \"He disapproved\"--to quote Mr. C. A.\r\nCook again--\"of anything fanciful in expression or any display of\r\nsentiment;\" but, so long as writers kept clear of these literary\r\npitfalls, he let them go their own road of style, with ready\r\nappreciation for any freshness or liveliness they exhibited on the\r\njourney. Reviews of French books were a special object of care, and for\r\nthe _Athenaeum's_ annual survey of French literature he bestirred\r\nhimself to secure the best hand available. In a letter to M. Joseph\r\nReinach, dated July, 1888, he gives a list of the distinguished\r\nmen--including MM. About, De Pressensé, and Sarrazin--who had written\r\nthis survey in past years, ending with a suggestion that M. Reinach\r\nhimself might perhaps be willing to undertake the task.\r\n\r\nIn his writing, as in his speaking, his object was always either to\r\nplace facts before his audience, or to develop a closely reasoned\r\nargument based upon the facts. He took no trouble to cultivate literary\r\ngraces in this connection; rather he seemed to distrust them, as in his\r\nspeeches he distrusted and avoided appeals to the feelings of his\r\nhearers. But it would be a great mistake to infer from his own practice\r\nthat he was insensible to beauty of form and style. The literature he\r\ncared for most, that which roused his enthusiasm and provoked the\r\nexpression of emotion so rare with him in the later years of his\r\nlife--the literature of France before the Renaissance, the poetry of\r\nKeats and Shelley, some of the lyrics of the Félibres--is of the kind in\r\nwhich content owes so much to beauty of form that it is impossible to\r\nconceive of the one without the other; and he certainly took quite as\r\nmuch delight in the sound as in the sense of his favourites. Even in\r\nthose favourites he was quick to detect a flaw. His grandfather's\r\nintroduction of him to the best in literature had not been wasted; and\r\nhis own early reading had given him a touchstone of taste which he used\r\nfreely as a standard, although it was powerless to obtain admission to\r\nhis accepted company of men of letters for those who made no appeal to\r\nhim individually. The Memoir shows that his self-training in literature\r\n(for the grandfather did no more than indicate the way) was carried out\r\nin youth; it was at Cambridge, while still an undergraduate, that he\r\nread Shakespeare 'for pleasure.' And this was true also of the great\r\nauthors of his own time. The results of that reading remained with him\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir dwells little upon his literary interests, and contains few\r\nliterary judgments. He himself gives the reason:\r\n\r\n    'They do not pretend to be critical memoirs.... I have known\r\n    everyone worth knowing from 1850 to my death; but, as I knew the\r\n    most distinguished of my own country in childhood or early manhood,\r\n    my judgments have changed. I have either to give crude judgments\r\n    from which I dissent, or later judgments which were not those of the\r\n    time. I have omitted both.... I knew the great Victorian authors.\r\n    Thackeray I loved: _Vanity Fair_ delighted me, and _Esmond_ was\r\n    obviously a great work of art; the giant charmed me by his kindness\r\n    to me as a boy. But Dickens was to me a sea-captain with a taste for\r\n    melodrama, and the author of _Pickwick_. It is only in old age that\r\n    I have learnt that there was real beauty and charm in _David\r\n    Copperfield_. So, too, Mill I worshipped; and Carlyle, though I knew\r\n    him, I despised--perhaps too much. Mat. Arnold was to me, in his day\r\n    and my day, only a society trifler, whereas now ... after for years\r\n    I have visited his tomb, I recognize him as a great writer of the\r\n    age in which he lived.'\r\n\r\nHere and there in the Memoir are glimpses of the world of literature\r\nwith which he was often in touch. He discusses with Swinburne a much-\r\ndisputed reference in Shelley's _Epipsychidion_. In 1872 Browning reads\r\nhis _Red Cotton Nightcap Country_ at 76, Sloane Street. There are\r\nadmiring references to the work of George Eliot, and to Mrs. Lynn\r\nLinton--'perhaps the cleverest woman I know.' When he goes to the United\r\nStates, we get his warmly drawn picture of the Boston group--Emerson,\r\nAgassiz, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Asa Gray, Longfellow, Lowell, Dr.\r\nCollyer, and Dr. Hedge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: See Chapter VI. (Vol. I., p. 60).]\r\n\r\nRecording Stepniak's suggestion that Bismarck, Mazzini, and Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes were the three greatest conversationalists of our times,\r\n'I said that, having known all three, I agreed that they were\r\nremarkable, although I myself found Mazzini a little of the bore.\r\nDisraeli was sometimes very good, although sometimes singularly silent;\r\nbut there were once two Russians that I put in the first rank--Herzen\r\nand Tourgénief.'\r\n\r\nQuestions relating to one literary personality alone receive full-length\r\ntreatment in the Memoir. On any point that concerned Keats Sir Charles\r\nwas always keenly interested. He may be said to have inherited the Keats\r\ntradition and the Keats devotion from his grandfather, and anyone\r\nconnected with Keats found easy way to his sympathy and attention. It\r\nwas his intervention which finally obtained for Keats's sister, Mme.\r\nLlanos, a regular Civil List pension in 1880. When the Lindon family\r\nsold to Mr. Buxton Forman Keats's letters to Miss Brawne, Mme. Llanos\r\nwrote 'from Madrid saying how greatly she was vexed that her brother's\r\nlove-letters should have been placed before the world,' and 'I had a\r\ngood deal of correspondence with Lord Houghton over this matter....\r\n[Lord Houghton] wrote:\r\n\r\n    '\"My Dear Dilke,\r\n\r\n    '\"Since the _Athenaeum_ fixed my place in poetical literature\r\n    between Rogers and Eliza Cook, I have naturally not read that\r\n    journal, but I have been shown a capital flagellation of those\r\n    unfilial wine-merchants. [Footnote: Miss Brawne married Louis\r\n    Lindon, a wine-merchant.] I thought I had even gone too far in my\r\n    elegant extracts--with which you furnished me. I have, alas! no\r\n    poetical amours to be recorded, out of which my family can make\r\n    anything handsome.\"'\r\n\r\nThe letter ends with an invitation to lunch and 'talk Keats.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles notes further:\r\n\r\n    'About this time (1878) Mr. Buxton Forman announced for publication\r\n    the Keats Love-Letters, which I certainly thought I had in a vague\r\n    way bought for the purpose of preventing publication. They had been\r\n    long in my possession, but the son of Fanny Brawne had claimed them,\r\n    and I, having no written agreement, had found it necessary to give\r\n    them up--although what I had bought and paid for, unless it was the\r\n    right to prevent publication, I do not know.'\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. John Morley proffered a request that Sir Charles\r\nwould write a monograph on Keats for his _English Men of Letters_. Lord\r\nHoughton thought that a \"new view\" from Sir Charles \"would have great\r\ninterest\"; but he decided to decline the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir records at length the course of a correspondence with Joseph\r\nSevern, on the subject of his portraits of Keats, about which the old\r\nman's memory, in his last days at Rome, had grown very hazy. He thought\r\nthat the miniature from which the engraving for Mr. Buxton Forman's\r\nedition had been made was the original presented to Fanny Brawne,\r\nwhereas it was the copy made for old Mr. Dilke from that original, which\r\nitself was afterwards 'bought by my grandfather to prevent its being\r\nsold by auction.' There was also at Pyrford a copy in oils made for Mr.\r\nMoxon, which Sir Charles had obtained by exchange from Mr. Frederick\r\nLocker-Lampson.\r\n\r\n    'After completing my investigations as to the portraits, I placed\r\n    them on record in a letter to my old friend Scharf, the Keeper of\r\n    the National Portrait Gallery, who replied: \"Thanks for your\r\n    interesting note, which we will duly place upon record. The portrait\r\n    which we have here is posthumous. Severn painted it in 1821, and we\r\n    hold a very curious letter from him describing the circumstances\r\n    under which he painted it.\" Here, therefore, is another undoubted\r\n    Severn in addition to the three which I possess. But I know myself\r\n    of at least one other.'\r\n\r\nThe gift of his collection of Keats relics to Hampstead has been\r\nelsewhere recorded. In deciding on Hampstead for its resting-place, he\r\nbrought it within the circle of local associations with Keats himself,\r\nand with the grandfather who had been Keats's friend. [Footnote: The\r\nMemoir records, in 1878, a visit paid with his great-uncle, William\r\nDilke, to Wentworth Place, 'the little house at Hampstead in which for a\r\ntime Mr. C. W. Dilke and his brother were Keats's next-door\r\nneighbours.']\r\n\r\nModern French authors interested him more than their English\r\ncontemporaries. In the former case he found, perhaps, less declension\r\nfrom the standard of the giants of whom he had been an eager student in\r\nhis early manhood, when he read \"all Balzac,\" and recorded his\r\nadmiration for the \"dignity\" of Mme. de Staël's _Germany_. Dumas he\r\nloved then and always, returning to him with ever new delight, and\r\nutilizing the rare periods of inaction imposed upon him at intervals by\r\nillness to read the whole of _The Three Musketeers_ series 'through\r\nagain--properly.' Where other writers who held sway over the mind of\r\nFrance during the nineteenth century were in question, his independence\r\nof taste came into play. Sainte-Beuve he could 'make nothing of.' For\r\nChateaubriand he felt something like contempt: 'Equally feeble as a\r\nmaker and a writer of history ... the inventor of a drawing-room\r\nChristianity without Christ;' but he recognized the high quality to be\r\nfound in the early writings of Sénancour. In later days the revival of a\r\nStendhal cult filled him with wondering amusement. To the best work of\r\nRenan his affections were always faithful: _Souvenirs d'Enfance et de\r\nJeunesse_ was among his favourite volumes. Anatole France gave him\r\nexquisite pleasure, and it is hard to say whether he most enjoyed the\r\nwit, the irony, or the style of that great writer. He had his\r\nfavourites, too, among the minor gods, and was always ready to introduce\r\na new-comer to the charms of _François de Barbizanges_ or the fun of\r\nAlfred Capus.\r\n\r\nIn French poetry his taste was eclectic. His feeling for Charles\r\nd'Orléans and his contemporaries barely stopped on this side idolatry;\r\nbut the classics of the seventeenth century had no message for him, and\r\nVictor Hugo as a poet left him, for the most part, unmoved. Indeed, he\r\nasserted that all French verse between Ronsard and Verlaine was purely\r\nrhetorical, and without genuine poetic quality. But in some modern\r\npoets, he thought, the true spirit of French poetry had revived. Early\r\nhe proclaimed the genius of Charles Guérin, whose claim to high place in\r\nhis country's literature remained unrecognized till after his death;\r\nearly, too, he hailed a new poetic star in François Porché. The star\r\nseemed to him later to wane in brilliancy, but the disappointment with\r\nwhich he read the poems of M. Porché's second period never weakened his\r\nadmiring recollection of the splendour of the poet's Russian verses and\r\nthe searching pathos of _Solitude au Loin_.\r\n\r\nHis familiarity with French literature, his hearty affection for it, his\r\nunderstanding of the national spirit by which it is informed and\r\nquickened, constituted one of the strongest ties which bound him in\r\nsympathy to his French friends. The literary forms which have had so\r\nmuch attraction for the best French minds both before and after 1789--\r\nthe chronicle and the memoir--were precisely those to which his\r\nunfailing interest in human nature led him by choice. Paradin and\r\nFroissart were companions of whom he never grew tired; and it would be\r\ndifficult to decide whether he found more absorbing matter of\r\nentertainment in Sully or Mme. de Dino.\r\n\r\nBut if he read these authors for delight, he read them also as a serious\r\nstudent. On this point the testimony of one of the most learned men in\r\ncontemporary France is clear. M. Salomon Reinach writes: [Footnote: In a\r\nletter addressed to the editor, and written in English.]\r\n\r\n    \"Talking with Sir Charles Dilke about Renaissance and modern\r\n    history, I soon perceived that he had taken the trouble of going to\r\n    the sources, and that he had read and knew many things of importance\r\n    which a man of letters, and even a scholar, are apt to ignore. It\r\n    was Sir Charles, to give only one instance, who revealed to me the\r\n    value of Guillaume Paradin's _Histoire de Notre Temps_ and\r\n    _Chronique de Savoie_, which he admired to such a degree that he put\r\n    the now forgotten author (the name of whom is not in the British\r\n    Encyclopaedia) on the same level as Guicciardini and the great\r\n    historians of antiquity. I would like to know how he discovered\r\n    Paradin, and if copies of his rare works were in his library. When I\r\n    happened to get hold of Major Frye's manuscript, afterwards\r\n    published by me (thanks to Sir Charles Dilke's recommendation) at\r\n    Heinemann's, he was the first to appreciate its interest, and gave\r\n    me much information about abbreviated names and other allusions\r\n    which occur in that diary. He chanced to dine with me the very\r\n    evening when I first had brought the manuscript to my house, and he\r\n    remained till past one in the morning, picturesquely seated on the\r\n    edge of a table, reading passages aloud and commenting upon them. He\r\n    also knew many secret and unrecorded facts about recent French\r\n    history; some of them have been given by him in unsigned articles of\r\n    the _Athenaeum_, in reviews of books relating to the Franco-German\r\n    War. I hope he may have left some more detailed notes on that\r\n    subject. I would have had the greatest pleasure in corresponding\r\n    with him, and regret I did not do so; but his handwriting was as\r\n    mysterious as his mind was clear, and I soon found that I could not\r\n    make it out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nTABLE TALK\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lady Dilke's death, the Rev. W. and Mrs. Tuckwell, her brother-\r\nin-law and her elder sister, made their home with Sir Charles Dilke at\r\nPyrford; and notes of his talk put together from memory and from diaries\r\nby the old scholar give a vivid impression of the statesman as seen in\r\nintimacy. Mr. Tuckwell says:\r\n\r\n    During the last five years of his life I breakfasted alone with Sir\r\n    Charles whenever he was at Pyrford. It was his \"softer hour,\" and\r\n    showed him in a specially endearing light. Not only was he fresh\r\n    from his night's rest, full, often, of matter interesting or amusing\r\n    in his letters which he had just read, but the tête-à-tête brought\r\n    out his finest social nature. In large companies, as we saw him at\r\n    Dockett, he was occasionally insistent, iterative, expressing\r\n    himself, to use a term of his own, with a \"fierceness\" corresponding\r\n    to the strength of his convictions. With me at our breakfasts he was\r\n    gentle, tolerant, what Sydney Smith called \"amoebean,\" talking and\r\n    listening alternately. I was told that before his death the two\r\n    experiences to which he referred in anticipating a return to his\r\n    Pyrford home were the forestry among his pines and the early\r\n    breakfast table.\r\n\r\n    Much of his talk was, of course, Parliamentary, bearing on incidents\r\n    or persons from the House. He often spoke of Harcourt, whom he\r\n    dearly loved. When Harcourt's death was announced to a party at\r\n    breakfast in Speech House, several in the company told anecdotes of\r\n    the dead man or commented on his character. One lady spoke of him\r\n    harshly. Sir Charles remained silent, but more than once during the\r\n    meal his eyes filled with tears. He told me on another occasion that\r\n    \"Lulu\" promised to be a greater man than his father, just as Winston\r\n    Churchill is a greater man than Randolph. Lulu resembles his father\r\n    curiously in all things except in the paternal habit of swearing.\r\n    Once, when an attempt by the Opposition to snatch a victory in a\r\n    thin House had been foiled, Harcourt said savagely across the table:\r\n    \"So that d----d dirty trick has failed!\" Hicks Beach sprang up to\r\n    ask the Speaker if such language were Parliamentary. Speaker Gully\r\n    was too discreet to have heard the words. Dilke remembered being in\r\n    company with Harcourt and Mrs. Procter, amongst several more. As she\r\n    left the room, Harcourt said: \"There goes one of the three most\r\n    charming women I ever knew; the other two\"--a pause, during which\r\n    the ladies present looked keenly expectant--\"the other two are\r\n    dead!\"\r\n\r\n    He turned to talk of Dizzy, to whom he had first been introduced in\r\n    his early days by Lady Lonsdale, the great man wishing to know him.\r\n    He quoted some of Dizzy's sayings. Dizzy called Spencer Walpole and\r\n    Russell Gurney \"those two whited sepulchres of the House of\r\n    Commons.\" Walpole, consequential and lugubrious, he spoke of as \"the\r\n    high-stepping hearse-horse of public life.\" Of deaf Mr. Thomasson,\r\n    who, ear-trumpet in hand, was wont to place himself near every\r\n    speaker, he said that \"no man had ever so neglected his natural\r\n    advantages.\"\r\n\r\n    Of Gladstone Dilke rarely spoke, but used to describe the periodical\r\n    entrance of Mrs. Gladstone into the meetings of the Cabinet with a\r\n    large basin of tea for the old man. [Footnote: In the last years of\r\n    Sir Charles's life, at a party given by Mr. and Mrs. Herbert\r\n    Gladstone at Downing Street, he stopped in the room where Cabinet\r\n    meetings used to be held, and pointed out to the editor of this book\r\n    the door through which Mrs. Gladstone used to enter bearing the bowl\r\n    of tea. For Sir Charles's recollections of Mr. Gladstone, see\r\n    appendix at end of this chapter.] Once he had to work out with his\r\n    chief some very difficult question. As they sat absorbed, Hamilton,\r\n    the private secretary, entered with an apologetic air to say that\r\n    ----, a well-known journalist, had called, pressingly anxious to see\r\n    the Prime Minister on an important subject. Without raising his\r\n    head, Gladstone said: \"Ask him what is his number in the lunatic\r\n    asylum.\"\r\n\r\n    He told of a Cabinet in 1883 at which ---- talked a great deal, \"and\r\n    I told Chamberlain that at the Political Economy Club, where I had\r\n    been dining on the previous night, there was a closure of debate in\r\n    the shape of the introduction of hot muffins, which I thought would\r\n    be excellent for Cabinets.\" At this Cabinet Lord Granville said: \"We\r\n    all agree that ---- is a bore, but I have never been able to make up\r\n    my mind whether that is a drawback or a qualification so far as\r\n    public service is concerned.\"\r\n\r\n    Asquith he looked upon as one of the greatest Parliamentarians he\r\n    had known, much superior in that capacity to Gladstone. His\r\n    allocution on the King's death was noble; still finer his\r\n    introduction of the Veto Bill in December, 1909. \"His speech was\r\n    perfect: forcible in manner, statesmanlike in argument, felicitous\r\n    in epithet and phrasing.\" Balfour on the same occasion was at his\r\n    worst: \"hampered by his former contrary declarations, trivial in\r\n    reasoning, feeble in delivery.\" He was ill, and ought not to have\r\n    come. I asked if Balfour's frequent inconsistencies and vacillations\r\n    were due to carelessness. He said no, but to the necessity imposed\r\n    upon him, not of proclaiming principles, but of keeping together a\r\n    divergent party. I asked what other notable recent speeches he could\r\n    recall. He said the Archbishop of Canterbury's [Footnote: Dr.\r\n    Randall Davidson.] on the Congo scandal, in the House of Lords: \"a\r\n    marvellous performance, nothing said which should not have been\r\n    said, everything said which required saying; the speech of a great\r\n    statesman.\" Bishop ---- followed him with a mere piece of missionary\r\n    claptrap. In the Commons on the same occasion our charming friend\r\n    Hugh Law distinguished himself, silencing some of his compatriots,\r\n    the Irish Roman Catholics, whose line was to support Leopold because\r\n    the Protestant missionaries abused him. Leopold II. Sir Charles\r\n    called \"the cleverest--and wickedest--man living.\" He broke off to\r\n    speak of the Archbishop, whom he met weekly at Grillion's, as a\r\n    delightfully instructive talker, not only full, that is, of light\r\n    agreeableness, but supporting the opinions he advances with\r\n    convincing, cogent, logical force, yet never boring his hearers. As\r\n    another powerful speech he instanced T. P. O'Connor on Sir R.\r\n    Anderson's indiscretions, \"most terribly crushing in its grim,\r\n    ruthless exposition,\" Anderson sitting in the Gallery to hear it.\r\n\r\n    In his own great speech on Army Reform in April, 1907, Sir Charles\r\n    said that Haldane was \"all things to all men.\" His hearers perceived\r\n    it to be a quotation (which in fact I had furnished), but no one\r\n    localized it! An amusing misquotation was Arnold-Forster's in the\r\n    same debate: he said that Haldane was like King David, who drilled\r\n    his men by fifties in a cave. In March, 1909, Sir Charles told me\r\n    sadly of Arnold-Forster's sudden death, which he had just learned.\r\n    \"With some defects of manner, he was very clever, writing and\r\n    speaking well. As War Minister Balfour gave him no chance. His last\r\n    speech in the House, a fortnight before his death, just preceded\r\n    mine. 'I must speak,' he said to me, 'on those damned Special\r\n    Reservists;' and speak he did for a good, well-sustained half-hour,\r\n    going out as soon as he had finished.\" He had been with us at\r\n    Dockett. He and Sir Charles sparred continually and amusingly, both\r\n    equally aggressive, imperious, stentorian, iterative, each insistent\r\n    on his own declamation and inattentive to his opponent's.\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles, while on this topic of oratory, went on to quote with\r\n    much hilarity a speech by Lord ---- in the Lords: \"This Liberal\r\n    Government injures friends no less than enemies. Look at me! I am a\r\n    passive resister; I belong to the National Liberal Club; I have\r\n    married my deceased wife's sister; and none of my children are\r\n    vaccinated; yet they are meddling with my rights as a landlord.\" The\r\n    Lords did not see the fun, the papers did not report it, but it is\r\n    to be found in Hansard.\r\n\r\n    I asked Dilke how my old pupil, Sir Richard Jebb, comported himself\r\n    in Parliament. He said: \"Handsome, beautifully groomed, with a\r\n    slight stoop, slow delivery, speaking rarely and on subjects which\r\n    he thoroughly understood, his phrasing perfect, manner engaging: a\r\n    man reserved and shy, not seeking acquaintance, but, if sought,\r\n    eminently agreeable.\" University members, he added, should come\r\n    always in pairs: one to represent the high University ideal,\r\n    embodied only in a very few; his colleague reflecting the mob of\r\n    country parsons who by an absurd paradox elect to Parliament. Jebb\r\n    was the ideal Cantab.; didactic, professorial, the Public Orator;\r\n    seeming incomplete without a gown: but for his rare and apt\r\n    appearances, he might have overdone the part.\r\n\r\n    He told a story of Major O'Gorman. A professed Roman Catholic, he\r\n    was dining in the House one Friday on a devilled chicken, when his\r\n    parish priest was announced. \"Waiter,\" he said, \"take away the\r\n    devil, and show in the priest.\"\r\n\r\n    When Sir Charles first took office, he was cautioned by his\r\n    colleague, Lord Tenterden, not to read the newspapers: \"If you do,\r\n    you will never distinguish between what you know and what you have\r\n    just read.\"\r\n\r\n    He mentioned ----. I said that his elaborate manners and bridegroom\r\n    dress marked him out as _natus convivio feminali_, meant by nature\r\n    to be a guest at ladies' tea-tables. Dilke assented, adding that he\r\n    was less bland to men than to women. \"Tommy\" Bowles said of him in\r\n    the House: \"The right honourable gentleman answers, or, rather, does\r\n    not answer, my questions with the pomposity of a Belgravian butler\r\n    refusing twopence to a beggar.\"\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the decadence in costume characteristic of the present\r\n    day. I said that, according to Wraxall, we must go back for its\r\n    beginnings to Charles Fox, who came down to the House in boots. I\r\n    added that, when I first went up to Oxford, a frock-coat and tall\r\n    hat were imperative in walking out; that a \"cut-away\" coat, as it\r\n    was called, would have been \"sconced\" in Hall; that men even kept\r\n    their boating-dresses at King's or Hall's, changing there; that a\r\n    blazer in the High would have drawn a crowd. He said that till very\r\n    lately--he was speaking in 1907--the custom of dress in Parliament\r\n    had been equally rigid; that Lord Minto had recently scandalized his\r\n    peers by wearing a straw hat; that when, some years before, a member\r\n    whose name I forget had taken the same liberty in the Commons, the\r\n    Speaker sent for him, and begged that he would not repeat the\r\n    offence.\r\n\r\n    In February, 1908, we talked of the Sweating Bill. Two years before,\r\n    he said, it could command so little support that, having obtained\r\n    for it the first private members' night, he withdrew it. Now it was\r\n    accepted with enthusiasm, and the second reading passed without a\r\n    division--the change, he added, entirely due to the Women's\r\n    Trade-Union League.\r\n\r\n    He expressed satisfaction with the stiffening procedure rules of\r\n    April, 1906, but added that they would make great Parliamentary\r\n    orations impossible. I said: \"All the better, we want business in\r\n    the Commons; for oratory there are other occasions.\" He said how\r\n    transient is the public interest in men and questions; the community\r\n    is like a kitten playing with a cork: so soon as it is tempted off\r\n    by something else, the cork becomes dead to it. He instanced\r\n    Rosebery; the Aliens Act; Tariff Reform, in spite of Chamberlain's\r\n    galvanizing efforts. Of Campbell-Bannerman, then alive and well, he\r\n    said that all his work was done for him by his subordinates: \"he had\r\n    only to read novels, prepare jokes, look inscrutable and fatherly.\"\r\n\r\n    In July, 1909, he attended the memorial service for Lord Ripon at\r\n    the Roman Catholic Cathedral. Knowing that the leading statesmen on\r\n    both sides, Protestant to a man, would be present, the ecclesiastics\r\n    made the show as fine as they could, bringing out all their\r\n    properties. All the monks and priests in London attended; the\r\n    Archbishop, in gorgeous attire, sat on a stool, with two boys behind\r\n    holding up his train. The music was exquisite; Sir Charles had never\r\n    heard anything so sweet as the warbling of the Requiem by the\r\n    chorister boys. But the whole was palpably a show, the actors intent\r\n    on their acting, never for a moment devotional; where changes in the\r\n    service involved changes in position, they were prepared while the\r\n    part before was still unfinished, so that the stage might never be\r\n    empty nor the transformations lag: the whole thing a Drury Lane\r\n    pageant; while the richly decorated catafalque in the centre, on\r\n    which the ceremonial supposed itself to converge, was empty--\r\n    _sepulchri supervacuos honores_--the body being at Studley. Of Ripon\r\n    himself, whom everyone loved, he spoke affectionately.\r\n\r\n    Of talks on miscellaneous topics I recall the following. We spoke of\r\n    the Tilsit Secret Articles, revealed mysteriously to the English\r\n    Government. Sir Charles thought the informant was a Russian officer,\r\n    betraying it with or without the connivance of the Tsar. Evidence\r\n    has since come out connecting the disclosure with a Mr. Mackenzie,\r\n    who is supposed to have obtained the secret from General Benningsen.\r\n    Or Canning may have learned it through the Russian Ambassador in\r\n    England, who was his intimate friend, and strongly adverse to his\r\n    master's French policy. [Footnote: See for a recent discussion of\r\n    the evidence J. Holland Rose's _Life of Napoleon_, ii. 135-140.] Sir\r\n    Charles went on to say that in history lies find easier credit than\r\n    truth. All the books have said and say that England refused to buy\r\n    Delagoa Bay from Portugal. He always denied this alleged refusal;\r\n    and now Lord Fitzmaurice has caused search to be made, and finds no\r\n    confirmatory evidence. Again, he maintained in Paris, against all\r\n    the experts, that Nigra engineered the Franco-Prussian War. His\r\n    words were repeated to the Empress Eugénie, who said, \"Yes, he is\r\n    right: Nigra was a false friend.\"\r\n\r\n    He talked of the Japanese, whom he had known in England and lived\r\n    with in Japan.... Their only religion is patriotism, and their\r\n    prayers to the Emperor are formal merely, yet they are reckless of\r\n    life and eager to die for Fatherland; indeed, so incapable of\r\n    retreating before an enemy as sometimes seriously to damage\r\n    strategic plans. Were they launched against the West, they would go\r\n    through any European army.\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the durability of the Third French Republic. It will be\r\n    unbroken while peace lasts. War may bring a temporary Dictatorship,\r\n    but the republic will of necessity revive again. The immense\r\n    majority of Frenchmen are opposed unalterably to a monarchy.\r\n\r\n    He quoted what was said to be Napoleon's only joke. In opening\r\n    negotiations with the British Government, he found it to be demanded\r\n    as a preliminary that, as matter of principle and without prejudice,\r\n    he should formally recognize the Bourbon rights, \"Most certainly,\"\r\n    he said, \"if, also as matter of principle and without prejudice, the\r\n    British Government would formally recognize the Stuart rights.\"\r\n\r\n    Dilke spoke of the old Political Economy Club, to which he was\r\n    introduced by John Stuart Mill. The President was Lord Bramwell; its\r\n    dominant member William Newmarch, a rough man of powerful intellect,\r\n    of whose ferocious criticisms everyone stood in awe, and who was\r\n    habitually hard on Mill.\r\n\r\n    He told a story of a well-known dandy, now a peer. The talk turned\r\n    on \"Society\" in the second intention of the word ---- had\r\n    enumerated certain houses in which you must be at home if pretending\r\n    to the exclusive social set. It was objected that the inmates of\r\n    some amongst these houses were persons whom the Queen (Victoria)\r\n    would not receive. \"The Queen!\" said ---- in a tone of pained\r\n    surprise--\"the Queen was _never_ in Society.\"\r\n\r\n    I had been to church unwittingly on \"Empire Day,\" and reported a\r\n    sermon stuffed with militarism. He poured cold water on the idea.\r\n    \"Ireland won't have it; Canada won't have it; South Africa loathes\r\n    it; India has an Empire Day of its own. Only Australia cares for it.\r\n    It is a vulgar piece of Tory bluff, and a device for annoying the\r\n    Dutch.\"\r\n\r\n    He had lately visited Dropmore: said how frequently the Dropmore\r\n    Papers upset accepted history, but that the historian will answer,\r\n    _Mon siege est fait_. He explained the phrase. A man had written a\r\n    history of some famous siege; after it was published fresh facts\r\n    were brought to his notice: he declined them--\"Mon siege est fait.\"\r\n    [Footnote: Ascribed to the Abbé Dubois.]\r\n\r\n    He talked of Marlborough's victories: he hummed the opening verse of\r\n    \"Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre.\" I said it was our \"For he's a jolly\r\n    good fellow\": he said yes, but the tune goes back to the time of the\r\n    Crusaders. I asked who wrote the words. He said an unknown French\r\n    soldier on the night of Malplaquet, when Marlborough was believed to\r\n    have been killed. Napoleon, who knew no music, often mounted his\r\n    horse at the opening of a campaign singing the first line as he put\r\n    his foot into the stirrup.\r\n\r\n    He spoke often of Grillion's which he habitually frequented and much\r\n    enjoyed. He told of its formation in 1812; of old members whom he\r\n    had known--Sir Robert Inglis, Chenery of the _Times_, regal old Sir\r\n    Thomas Acland, Fazakerley, Gally Knight, Wilmot Horton; of its\r\n    effect in socially harmonizing men bitterly opposed in politics. He\r\n    told the story of \"Mr. G.\" dining there by accident alone, and\r\n    entering himself in the club book as having drunk a bottle of sherry\r\n    and a bottle of champagne. He said what care was taken to exclude\r\n    undesirables, preserving thereby a high tone of company and of talk.\r\n    I asked him what was the finest conversation to which he had ever\r\n    listened. \"In Boston,\" he said; \"at Lowell's breakfast-table; the\r\n    company Lowell, Wendell Holmes, Longfellow, Agassiz, Asa Gray.\"\r\n    [Footnote: See Vol. I., Chapter VI.]\r\n\r\n    We talked of precious stones, recalling the Koh-i-noor in its small\r\n    gas-lighted tent at the 1851 Exhibition. He said that modern paste\r\n    is more beautiful and effective than diamonds. The finest pearls\r\n    known belonged to the Duchess of Edinburgh: she showed Sir Charles a\r\n    collar valued at two millions sterling. I named the Hope jewels,\r\n    shown also in 1851. He knew the \"rich Hope,\" Henry, who built the\r\n    house in Piccadilly. The \"poor Hope,\" Beresford, had only £30,000 a\r\n    year. They were a Dutch family, \"Hoop\" by name. Beresford's wife,\r\n    Lady Mildred, aped the Queen, driving in the Park dressed in black,\r\n    with a large hat, and finely mounted outriders. The same thing was\r\n    done by Mme. Van de Weyer. Beresford bought the _Morning Chronicle_\r\n    in order to promulgate his High Church views, writing under the\r\n    signature D.C.L. He ruined the paper.\r\n\r\n    He more than once sang the praises of Sir George Grey--honoured in\r\n    South Africa, Australia, New Zealand; statesman, aristocrat,\r\n    Radical, creator of the Australian Labour Party, terror of our\r\n    Colonial Office at home; one of the few men who have done great\r\n    things by themselves. Bismarck told Sir Charles that Cavour, Crispi,\r\n    Kruger, were greater than himself. \"I had the army and the State\r\n    behind me; these men had nothing.\" Amongst Bismarck's minor desires\r\n    was a hope that he might outlive his physician, Dr. Schweininger,\r\n    who plagued him with limitations as to diet. \"To-day potatoes will\r\n    we eat; to-morrow comes Schweininger.\" He owned to having over-eaten\r\n    himself once, and only once: \"Nine nine-eyes (lampreys) did I eat.\"\r\n    \"People,\" he said, \"look on me as a monarchist. Were it all to come\r\n    over again, I would be republican and democrat: the rule of kings is\r\n    the rule of women; the bad women are bad, the good are worse.\"\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles spoke of Botha, whom he met here in 1907. People were\r\n    unexpectedly charmed with him: they anticipated a replica of old\r\n    Kruger; instead of that they beheld a handsome man, with the most\r\n    beautiful eyes and mouth ever seen. His daughter with him was very\r\n    pretty; fashionably dressed, in the style of a French American.\r\n\r\n    He told of an Indian official under the old East India Company\r\n    stationed in a remote place, a \"Boggley Wallah,\" who for several\r\n    years sent in no reports, money, or accounts. An emissary,\r\n    commissioned to bring him to book, found him living in great luxury\r\n    on the borders of a lake. He said that he did his work and kept his\r\n    papers on an island in the lake, and sent a boat for them; but the\r\n    returning boat somehow sank in mid-water, and books and papers went\r\n    to the bottom. The Company dismissed him without a pension: he came\r\n    to London, took his seat daily in ragged clothes just outside the\r\n    offices in Leadenhall Street, standing up to salaam when any\r\n    Director or official passed in or out, but speaking no word. People\r\n    gathered to look at him, and at last the Company gave him £1,000 a\r\n    year. He drove down in a carriage and four, and handed in a letter\r\n    stating that he had already amassed £5,000 a year in their service,\r\n    that they had now raised it to £6,000, and that he desired to\r\n    express his gratitude.\r\n\r\n    I quoted from some book I was reading a dictum that no woman\r\n    nowadays can be called perfectly beautiful. He said he had known\r\n    only two, Lady Dudley and Madame Castiglione. The latter was in the\r\n    pay successively of Victor Emanuel and Louis Napoleon; in the second\r\n    capacity supposed to have been a spy employed by Cavour.\r\n\r\n    He spoke of John Forster, biographer of Dickens, an intimate friend\r\n    of his own grandfather and father, as a man of violent, noisy\r\n    passions, but very lovable; his attitude towards Dickens\r\n    pathetically affectionate.\r\n\r\n    He described two German Princesses whom he had met at lunch; dowdy\r\n    and of the ordinary Teutonic type, looking on their brother \"Billy\"\r\n    as the greatest of mortals. They had been shopping up and down\r\n    Oxford Street, delighted with their purchases, and with their escape\r\n    from Court ceremonial. He went on to say how common every Prussian\r\n    officer looks when in plain clothes. Wearing them very rarely, the\r\n    officers never look at ease in them; and the swagger which they\r\n    adopt in uniform is highly ridiculous in mufti.\r\n\r\n    When Napoleon's death was known, one of George IV.'s Ministers went\r\n    to his master with the news: \"Sir, your greatest enemy is dead.\"\r\n    \"Good G---! they told me she was better,\" was the royal answer. Sir\r\n    Charles spoke of Jerome Bonaparte, whom he knew; a dull man, a thorn\r\n    in the side of Napoleon III. \"You have nothing of the great Napoleon\r\n    about you,\" Jerome said one day. \"I have his family,\" answered the\r\n    worried Emperor. From him we passed to the death of the Duc\r\n    d'Enghien. The Princes were notoriously plotting against Napoleon's\r\n    life; by slaying a Prince of the blood he made it clear that two\r\n    could play the game. The first copy of Mme. de Rémusat's book was\r\n    thought to deal too plainly with this and other topics; it was\r\n    destroyed, and rewritten in a softer tone.\r\n\r\n    In November, 1909, Sir Charles spent some days in the Record Office,\r\n    coming back each time in much need of a bath, after rummaging\r\n    amongst papers which had not been disturbed for a century. He found\r\n    amongst other papers a letter from a Grand Duke of Modena to\r\n    Castlereagh, written just after Napoleon's fall, saying how exultant\r\n    were his subjects at his return to them, and asking Castlereagh to\r\n    lend him £14. With the letter was the draft of Castlereagh's answer,\r\n    congratulating the Duke's subjects and himself, but adding that\r\n    there would be difficulty in applying to Parliament for the loan.\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles remarked on my _Athenaeum_ review of Francis Newman's\r\n    Life. He said that when he himself was in bad odour for his early\r\n    Civil List speeches, so that he had been exposed to serious\r\n    disturbances, and a break-up of his intended meeting at Bristol was\r\n    threatened, Newman, from sheer dislike to mob tyranny, came forward\r\n    to take the chair; and through a tempest of shouts and rushes, and\r\n    amid the stifling smell of burnt Cayenne pepper, sat in lean\r\n    dignity, looking curiously out of place, but serene in vindication\r\n    of a principle. [Footnote: See Vol. I, Chapter IX.]\r\n\r\n    The publication of the Life of Goldwin Smith led us to talk of\r\n    University reform. I said how by means of it my own college had\r\n    become _ex humili potens_, had arisen from depths to heights, from\r\n    obscurity to fame. Of his, he said, the contrary was true: his\r\n    college had been ruined by Parliamentary interference. Trinity Hall\r\n    was founded for the study and teaching of jurisprudence, the old\r\n    Roman canon and civil law, on which all modern law is based. It was\r\n    the only institution of the kind, a magnificent and useful monopoly.\r\n    This exclusive character was destroyed by Parliament; scholarships\r\n    in mathematics and classics were instituted; it is now like other\r\n    colleges, and men who wish to study law at its source no longer\r\n    frequent it. He talked to me of Cambridge, and related with mimicry\r\n    anecdotes of \"Ben\" Latham, Master of Trinity Hall. Dining at Trinity\r\n    Hall one Sunday in 1883, he said Latham told him that he had lately\r\n    been sitting on an inter-University committee with Jowett, and that\r\n    Jowett was so sharp a man of business that \"it is like sitting to\r\n    represent the Great Northern against the London and North-Western.\r\n    His one idea is to draw away passengers from the rival line.\" Latham\r\n    went on to say that the students for India who were made to stay two\r\n    years at Cambridge or Oxford, under Jowett's scheme, \"the first year\r\n    learn _Sandford and Merton_ in Tamil, translated by a missionary;\r\n    and the second year _Sandford and Merton_ in Telugu, translated by\r\n    the same missionary. Thus they acquire a liberal education.\"\r\n\r\n    He talked of Waterloo, the battlefield being known to us both. It\r\n    was, he said, as the Duke always owned, a wonderfully near thing. If\r\n    Napoleon had had with him the two army corps left in France to\r\n    overawe insurrectionary districts, who would have joined him in a\r\n    week; and if at Ligny he had persevered in so smashing the Prussians\r\n    as to leave them powerless--if these two \"if's\" had become\r\n    realities, Napoleon must have driven Wellington back on Brussels.\r\n    Then the Belgians would have joined him, and the Austrians would\r\n    have forsaken the Allies, Metternich wishing well to Bonaparte for\r\n    the sake of his wife and child. The mystery of his escape from Elba,\r\n    which the English fleet might easily have prevented, remains still\r\n    to be explained: for the Vienna Congress was riddled with intrigue.\r\n    [Footnote: Sir Charles Dilke discussed the whole question of\r\n    Napoleon's escape from Elba in an article in the _Quarterly Review_,\r\n    January, 1910, entitled \"Before and After the Descent from Elba.\"]\r\n\r\n    He made me laugh at a parson who in moments of provocation used to\r\n    say \"Assouan!\" His friends at last remembered that at Assouan was\r\n    the biggest dam in the world.\r\n\r\n    He gave me a recipe for beefsteak pudding: _no beef_, fresh kidney,\r\n    fresh mushrooms, fresh oysters, great stress laid on the epithet:\r\n    serve the pudding in its basin.\r\n\r\n    He came in to breakfast one morning whistling an attractive air. I\r\n    asked what it was; he said from _Carmen_, and hummed the air\r\n    through. He went on to say that he had well known the composer,\r\n    Bizet, who founded his opera on Mérimée's romance. It fell flat, and\r\n    Bizet died believing it a failure; afterwards it became the rage.\r\n\r\n    This whistling of music was a favourite practice with him. His\r\n    accurate ear enabled him to reproduce any tune which had at any time\r\n    impressed him. He would give Chinese airs, would go through parts of\r\n    a Greek Church service, would sing words and music of the _Dies Iræ.\r\n    On the Sunday following the death of Florence Nightingale our\r\n    Chertsey organist played Chopin's Funeral March. Sir Charles said\r\n    its _motifs_ were Greek rustic popular airs, each of which he\r\n    hummed, showing how Chopin had worked them in.\r\n\r\n    The dinner given to him in April, 1910, in connection with the Trade\r\n    Boards Bill was a great success, and much delighted him. He said\r\n    Bishop Gore had made a splendid speech. Sir Charles had a long chat\r\n    with Gore, and was, as always, delighted with his information and\r\n    bonhomie.\r\n\r\n    He talked of a Parisian jeweller who lived by selling jewels and by\r\n    lending money to the great Indian native potentates, and had\r\n    establishments for that purpose in India. This man wished to be\r\n    employed by our Government as a spy: Sir Charles applied on his\r\n    behalf to Lord George Hamilton, who handed to him the man's\r\n    _dossier_, an appalling catalogue of crimes and misdemeanours. He\r\n    had an extraordinarily noble presence; Sir Charles said to him:\r\n    \"_You_ ought to be Amir of Afghanistan.\" \"No,\" he replied; \"I should\r\n    never have the patience to kill a sufficient number of people.\"\r\n\r\n    Of a French gentleman who had come to tea, recommended by the French\r\n    Ambassador, Sir Charles said that he was a French fool, the worst\r\n    kind of fool, _corruptio optimi_.\r\n\r\n    He showed the number of peerages having their origin in\r\n    illegitimacy, although the official books conceal the fact where\r\n    possible. The facts come out in such memoirs as Lady Dorothy\r\n    Nevill's. He went on to talk of divorce in the Roman Church, and to\r\n    scout their boast that with them marriage is an indissoluble\r\n    sacrament. The Prince of Monaco was for years the husband of Lady\r\n    Mary Hamilton. They tired of each other, wished for a divorce; the\r\n    Pope, with heavy fees for the transaction, declared the marriage to\r\n    have been for some ecclesiastical reason null and void. Each married\r\n    again; but the son of the nominally annulled union succeeded his\r\n    father as legitimate heir.\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles spoke--this was in 1906--of Bülow's speech in the German\r\n    Parliament, as one of the best ever made by any statesman, and\r\n    creating universal astonishment. Its appreciation of France and of\r\n    Gambetta was magnificent as well as generous. The French, after the\r\n    _débâcle_, behaved as a nation self-respecting and patriotic ought\r\n    to have behaved. His hint at the bad feeling between the Kaiser and\r\n    King Edward was dexterous; it was real and insuperable; none of our\r\n    Royal Family can forgive the seizure of Hanover by Prussia; and\r\n    added to this was our King's indignation at the Kaiser's treatment\r\n    of the Empress Frederick, a member of his family for whom he felt\r\n    strong affection.\r\n\r\n    Of Morny he said that he was very handsome, but in an inferior\r\n    style. His beautiful Russian wife never cared for him, but in\r\n    obedience to Russian custom cut off her wonderful hair to be laid\r\n    with him in his coffin.\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the brothers Chorley, one the supreme musical critic of\r\n    his time, the other a profound Spanish scholar, shut up through life\r\n    in his library of 7,300 volumes.\r\n\r\n    Dilke told me one morning that he had been writing since five\r\n    o'clock an article for the _United Service Gazette_, and had\r\n    finished it to his satisfaction, adding that papers dashed off under\r\n    an impulse were always the best. I demurred. \"Those papers of mine,\"\r\n    I said, \"specially praised by you have been always the fruit of long\r\n    labour.\" \"Ah!\" he answered, \"but you have style--a rare\r\n    accomplishment; that is what I have admired in yours.\" \"Would you,\"\r\n    I said, \"admire the style if the matter were ill considered?\" \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n    He often talked admiringly of the Provençal language, declaiming\r\n    more than once what he called a fine Homeric specimen:\r\n\r\n      \"Pesto, liona, sablas, famino, dardai fou,\r\n      Avie tout affronta.\"\r\n\r\n      (Pestilence, lions, sandy deserts, famine, maddening sun-heat,\r\n      Ye have all this faced.)\r\n\r\n    He was fond, too, of quoting Akbar's inscription on the Agra bridge:\r\n    \"Said Jesus, on whom be peace, Life is a bridge: pass over!\"\r\n\r\n    He described the French Foreign Legion: two regiments employed by\r\n    the French chiefly among the natives in the Tonquin settlement--\r\n    desperate men most of them, many of high social position and of army\r\n    rank, who had \"done something\" and had gone wrong; disgraced, hiding\r\n    from society, criminals escaped from justice, with a sprinkling of\r\n    young adventurers and riotous Germans. No enormity they would not\r\n    commit, no danger they would not court; some even seeking death; all\r\n    knowing that if left wounded in the bush by retreating comrades they\r\n    would be tortured horribly by the Tonquin women. They had a hospital\r\n    served by Roman Catholic nurses, to whom they paid every respect.\r\n    When a man newly joined once whistled rudely while the Sister was\r\n    praying, as was her custom before leaving the ward, his comrades\r\n    severely punished him. Intra-regimental offences, such as theft,\r\n    were visited with death.\r\n\r\n    He mentioned one morning that he had just received a Privy Council\r\n    summons. I asked why the Bidding Prayer held a petition for the\r\n    Lords _and others_ of Her Majesty's Privy Council: old Regius\r\n    Professor Jacobson used to tell us that it was a mistake, that all\r\n    Privy Councillors were \"Lords\" of the Privy Council. He thought that\r\n    the word \"others\" represented the Lord Mayor, who attends Accession\r\n    Councils and signs the parchment, but, not being a Lord of Council,\r\n    is then required to leave, while other business proceeds.\r\n\r\n    Twice in these years he dined at Oxford--once at All Souls as the\r\n    guest of Mr. Spenser Wilkinson, again on the invitation of some\r\n    undergraduates, sons mostly of his political acquaintances. He\r\n    greatly enjoyed both; the young men were the pick and flower of\r\n    Oxford; the All Souls high table was full of young teachers and\r\n    professors. What a change from the aristocratic college of my time,\r\n    whose head was Lewis Sneyd, its Fellows William Bathurst, Henry\r\n    Legge, Sir Charles Vaughan, Augustus Barrington, etc.! Anson very\r\n    charmingly presided; the talk was everything except political.\r\n\r\n    He was extraordinarily impressed by the funeral of the King--a\r\n    wonderful and novel ceremony he called it. As a senior Privy\r\n    Councillor he had an excellent place with Asquith close to the\r\n    coffin. The most magnificent figure in the show was Garter\r\n    King-of-Arms, but all the heralds were splendid. The Archbishop,\r\n    with the Dean of Westminster and a cross-bearer, was the only\r\n    prominent ecclesiastic, the Bishops in their places as peers being\r\n    crowded out of sight. The colouring was most effective, black\r\n    setting off the scarlet. The singing was somewhat drowned by the\r\n    Guards' bands, but the Dead March came in grandly through the\r\n    windows from Palace Yard. He mentioned a curious fact: that\r\n    Westminster Hall is controlled, not by Parliament, not by any\r\n    Government department, but by the Great Chamberlain. It is the sole\r\n    remaining part of the royal palace, which was lent to Parliament by\r\n    our early Kings. I said that it had not witnessed such a scene\r\n    since, on Mary's accession, the Sovereign and the two Houses met\r\n    there to receive Papal absolution from the Legate Pole. He wished I\r\n    had told him so before.\r\n\r\n    He recalled the Cambridge Union debates of his time: the best he\r\n    ever heard was on a personal question, the impeachment of a man\r\n    named Harris for some breach of rule. Henry Sidgwick was in the\r\n    chair, the speaking extraordinarily animated and well sustained. The\r\n    finest orator of his time was a man called Payne. [Footnote: Payne\r\n    belonged to the same college as Dilke, Trinity Hall, and was\r\n    bracketed Senior in the Law Tripos of 1868. He had begun to make his\r\n    mark both at the Bar and in the Press, when, still a very young man,\r\n    he was killed in a mountaineering accident in Wales.] I said our\r\n    best speaker in my day was Goschen; his Union reports caused\r\n    Gladstone to pick him out and bring him forward. He said yes, but\r\n    that Goschen never fulfilled his promise until his really powerful\r\n    speech on Free Trade in 1903.\r\n\r\n    He enumerated the Jewish types in England. There is (1) the sallow\r\n    Jew with a beak; (2) the same without a beak; (3) the \"hammy\" Jew,\r\n    with pink face like a _cochon-à-lait_. The Florentine type, with\r\n    fair hair and beautiful clear face, is not seen in England.\r\n\r\n    His criticism of a certain lady led me to ask who, of people he had\r\n    known, possessed the most perfect manners. He said Lord Clarendon,\r\n    who had the old carefully cultivated Whig manners, yet with the\r\n    faintest possible tendency to pomposity. This style became\r\n    unfashionable, and was succeeded by what he called the \"early\r\n    Christian\" or \"Apostolic\" manners, of which the late Lord Knutsford\r\n    was a perfect exemplar. The best-mannered woman he had known was the\r\n    late Lady Waterford. Domestic servants too, he said, have manners;\r\n    he instanced as magnificent specimens Turner, Lady Waldegrave's\r\n    groom of the chambers, and Miss Alice Rothschild's Jelf. Lady\r\n    Lonsdale once spoke of the latter as \"Guelph, or whatever member of\r\n    the Royal Family it is that waits on Alice.\"\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles talked about the Wallace Collection. Sir Richard was not\r\n    the natural son either of the fourth Lord Hertford, or of his father\r\n    the third Lord, Thackeray's Steyne and Disraeli's Monmouth. He was\r\n    brought up by the fourth Lord Hertford, under the name of Monsieur\r\n    Richard, not by any means as the expectant heir; yet, excepting the\r\n    settled estates, which went to the fifth Marquis, all was left to\r\n    him. Part of the great art collection remained at Bagatelle, which\r\n    became the property of a younger Wallace, an officer in the French\r\n    army; the rest has come to the English nation through Lady Wallace,\r\n    to whom her husband left the whole. Why Sir Richard assumed the name\r\n    Wallace no one knows. He was French, not English, speaking English\r\n    imperfectly: a kind, cheery, polished gentleman.\r\n\r\n    Apropos of the Education Bill: old Lady Wilde from her window in\r\n    Tite Street heard a woman bewailing herself in the street--her son\r\n    had been \"took away,\" to gaol that is. \"He was a good boy till the\r\n    Eddication came along;\" then, kneeling down on the pavement and\r\n    joining her hands, she prayed solemnly \"God damn Eddication.\"\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles contrasted the idiosyncrasies of some politicians: Grey\r\n    reserved, Balfour telling everything to everybody; Arnold-Forster\r\n    closely \"buttoned up,\" Gorst dangerously frank. On Gorst he\r\n    enlarged: a nominal Tory, in fact a Radical, ever battering his own\r\n    side for the mere fun of the operation; old in years, young in\r\n    activity of brain and body; a poor man all his life.\r\n\r\n    He said that the two incomparable sights which this country could\r\n    show to a foreigner were (1) Henley in regatta week; (2) the Park on\r\n    a fine summer day: everyone out riding, and the Life Guards' band\r\n    going down to a Drawing-room.\r\n\r\n    I asked if he had heard a certain London preacher who was drawing\r\n    large audiences. He said yes, and that he was well worth hearing.\r\n    \"He is High Church and anti-ritualist, Socialist and aristocrat,\r\n    orthodox while holding every heresy extant, not cultured or\r\n    literary, slovenly and almost coarse; yet grasping his listeners by\r\n    the feeling impressed on each that the preacher knows and is\r\n    describing his (the hearer's) experiences, troubles, hopes,\r\n    life-history.\"\r\n\r\n    I questioned him about Leonard Montefiore, a memoir of whom had\r\n    caught my eye in one of the bookcases. He was a man of brilliant\r\n    promise, unpopular at Balliol, giving himself intellectual airs;\r\n    went unwashed, with greenish complexion and generally repulsive\r\n    appearance; would have been prominent had he lived; was much petted\r\n    by Ruskin.\r\n\r\n    He said that, if London were destroyed to-morrow, in ten years' time\r\n    its site would be covered with a forest of maple, sycamore, robinia,\r\n    showing an undergrowth of Persian willow-herb.\r\n\r\n    He told of a man whom his groom pronounced to be \"the footiest gent\r\n    on a 'oss and the 'ossiest gent on foot as he ever see.\"\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the \"Local Veto Bill,\" forced by Harcourt on a reluctant\r\n    Cabinet; Harcourt was, he said, a genuine convert to the principle--\r\n    a curious intellectual phenomenon, this development of a belated\r\n    conviction in a mind hitherto essentially opportunist. It cost him\r\n    his seat later on.\r\n\r\n    Sir Charles described Speaker Peel's farewell to the House: said\r\n    that it was quite perfect in every way. He thought Gully undesirable\r\n    as his successor, and should not vote for him.\r\n\r\n    Of the rising I.L.P. he said once, in early days, they had done\r\n    wrongly in formulating a programme. Their name was a sufficient\r\n    programme; now they would indirectly help the Tories.\r\n\r\n    He had an extraordinary insight into the mental habits and emotions\r\n    of domestic animals, interpreting the feelings and opinions of his\r\n    horses when out riding, of his Pyrford dog Fafner, of his Sloane\r\n    Street cat Calino, in a manner at once graphic and convincing. His\r\n    love for cats amounted to a passion; a menagerie of eight or ten\r\n    tailless white or ginger Persians was kept in an enclosure, at\r\n    Pyrford. Once, when exploring a fine Ravenna church, we missed him,\r\n    returning from our round to find him near the door, caressing a cat\r\n    belonging to the custodian, which he had inveigled into his lap.\r\n\r\n    His literary dislikes and preferences were numerous and frankly\r\n    expressed, deeply interesting as the idiosyncrasies of a rich and\r\n    highly trained intelligence, even when to myself somewhat\r\n    unaccountable. While keenly appreciating the best in modern French\r\n    literature, he could see no charm in Corneille or Racine. Quite\r\n    lately Rabelais, reopened after many years, appealed to him\r\n    strongly, as keen satire and invective veiled by wit, and, so only,\r\n    tolerated by those scourged. To be laid hold of and temporarily\r\n    possessed by a book was as characteristic of him as of old\r\n    Gladstone; in their turn, _Pantagruel_, Anatole France's _Penguins_,\r\n    most of all _The Blue Bird_, which he read delightedly, but would\r\n    not see acted, formed of late the breakfast equipage as certainly as\r\n    the eggs and toast: any utterance of conventional apology or regret\r\n    was expressed by, \"Voulez-vous que j'embrasse le chat?\"\r\n\r\n    His acquaintance with English literature was intermittent. He was\r\n    apparently a stranger to our eighteenth-century authors, both in\r\n    poetry and prose; of those who followed them in time, he undervalued\r\n    Scott, disliked Macaulay, admired Napier, admired Trollope.\r\n    Wordsworth he condemned as puerile, inheriting the _Edinburgh\r\n    Review_ estimate of his poetry, and often called on me ecstatically\r\n    to repeat Hartley Coleridge's parody of _Lucy_. Of Keats he was\r\n    immeasurably fond, drawn to him by the poet's relation to his\r\n    family, declaiming his lines often--as he did sometimes those of\r\n    Shelley, whose verses in his own copy of the poems are heavily and\r\n    with wise selection scored--in tones which showed a capacity for\r\n    deep poetic feeling. A quotation would accidentally arrest him, and\r\n    he would call for the book, usually after short perusal discarding\r\n    the author as a \"poopstick,\" a favourite phrase with him. I remember\r\n    this occurring with the _Rejected Addresses_, though he knew and\r\n    loved James Smith. A travesty of Omar Khayyám, called _The Rubaiyat\r\n    of a Persian Kitten_, he read delightedly, much preferring it to the\r\n    original. He professed contempt for the study of English grammar,\r\n    more especially for the scientific analysis of English\r\n    sentence-structure, which plays so large a part in modern education.\r\n    The contempt was certainly, as Osborne Gordon said, not bred of\r\n    familiarity. I fear that, like most University or public school men,\r\n    he would have been foiled by the simplest Preliminary Grammar Paper\r\n    of a University Local Examination to-day.\r\n\r\n    But his knowledge of political history, foreign and domestic, during\r\n    the last centuries was marvellously extensive and minute. In earlier\r\n    history he was oblivious often of his own previous knowledge,\r\n    argumentatively maintaining untenable propositions. Though fortified\r\n    by Freeman and Bryce, I could never get him to admit that all the\r\n    historic \"Emperors,\" from Augustus Caesar in 27 B.C. down to\r\n    Francis, King of Germany, who gave up the Empire in A.D. 1806, were\r\n    Emperors, not of Germany or Austria, but of Rome; or that the\r\n    Reformed English Church of Tudor times, with all its servility, had\r\n    never relinquished, but steadily held and holds, its claim to\r\n    continuous Catholicity. But a query as to the French Revolution, the\r\n    Napoleonic dynasties, the Vienna Congress, the South African or\r\n    Franco-Prussian War, or the developments in India, Canada, Egypt,\r\n    would draw forth a stream of marshalled lucid information, which it\r\n    was indeed a privilege to hear.\r\n\r\n    \"Neque ille in luce modo atque in oculis civium magnus, sed intus\r\n    domique præstantior. Qui sermo! quæ præcepta! quanta notitia\r\n    antiquitatis! quæ scientia juris! Omnia memoria tenebat, non\r\n    domestica solum, sed etiam externa bella. Cujus sermone ita tunc\r\n    cupide tenebar, quasi jam divinarem, id quod evenit, illo exstincto\r\n    fore unde discerem neminem\" (Cicero, _De Senectute_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nPERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF MR. GLADSTONE BY\r\nSIR CHARLES DILKE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in the way of furnishing reminiscences of Mr. Gladstone\r\nin Cabinet is in part the Privy Council oath, but still more the fact\r\nthat, where the matters that would be touched are of interest, they\r\noften affect individuals or parties. I saw the most of Mr. Gladstone\r\nbetween 1880 and 1886, and to this period the restrictions imposed by\r\nthe considerations named are most highly applicable. In the earlier days\r\nwhen I sat in Parliament with him, from 1868 to 1880, we were, though\r\nsitting on the same side of the House, frequently opposed to one\r\nanother, for I was often fighting for the claims of independent\r\nRadicalism as against his commanding personality. This was especially\r\nthe case from 1868 to 1874; and his retirement after his defeat in 1874,\r\nwhen Lord Hartington became the leader of the Liberal party, was so\r\ncomplete that it was not until Mr. Gladstone was aroused by the\r\ndevelopment of the Eastern Question in 1877 that we again saw much of\r\nhim in the House of Commons. An interesting reminiscence of the great\r\nstruggle of 1878 is afforded by the copy in my possession of the Whips'\r\nlist of the Liberal party marked by Mr. Gladstone and myself. I was\r\nacting for him, against the party Whips, in the preparations for the\r\ndivision upon his famous Resolutions. We daily went through the promises\r\nof the members who had undertaken to support his Resolutions, of those\r\nwho remained steadfast in adhesion to Lord Hartington and who were\r\nprepared to vote against the Resolutions, and of those who would vote\r\nneither way. The changes from day to day in the ascertained opinions of\r\nthe party were most strange. Family was divided against family--for\r\ninstance the family of Cavendish--and the cleavage followed no line that\r\ncorresponded with shades of Liberalism. The pro-Turks upon the Liberal\r\nside were joined in their support of Lord Hartington by the \"peace at\r\nany price\" section of the Radicals. Curiously enough, the division of\r\nthe party was exactly equal, and remained equal through all the changes\r\nof individual promises. On the day on which peace was made, and (to Mr.\r\nGladstone's immense relief) the chances of a complete disruption\r\naverted, the number of members pledged to Mr. Gladstone was 110, and an\r\nexactly equal number of members was pledged to Lord Hartington and the\r\nWhips.\r\n\r\nComing to later times, a reminiscence is one of April, 1893, when Mr.\r\nGladstone sent for me to discuss a motion of which I had given notice\r\nupon the Egyptian occupation. He talked on that occasion with that\r\nabsolute frankness which accompanied the confidence he always placed in\r\nothers. It was not peculiar to him, but belongs more, perhaps, to the\r\nold days in which he received the training of his mind than to present\r\ntimes. We are told that democratic diplomacy is to be outspoken. But, so\r\nfar as Parliament is concerned, the older leaders were, I think, like\r\nMr. Gladstone, more given to outspokenness than the newer men, who find\r\nthemselves forced by the ubiquity of the Press to a greater reserve than\r\nwas formerly necessary to be maintained. Mr. Gladstone was always of a\r\nplayful mind, and it would be impossible ever to fully relate any of his\r\nconversations without recalling the manner in which, however absorbed in\r\nhis subject, he always would break off to discuss some amusing\r\ntriviality. Sir William Harcourt has touchingly recalled Mr. Gladstone's\r\nold-world courtesy, which was in private life his distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic.--_Daily News_, May 24_th_, 1898.",
